Johnson Space Center. He worked for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics from 1937 to 1958 and its successor NASA, until his retirement in 1973. He was involved with early research into supersonic flight and rocket-powered aircraft, and then with the United States manned space program, including the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs. Biography =Early life= Gilruth was born October 8, 1913, in Nashwauk, Minnesota, and moved to Duluth when he was nine years old. He graduated in 1931 from Duluth Central High School. As a teenager, Gilruth was fascinated by aeronautics and spent time building model airplanes. He was inspired to pursue a career in the field after reading about NACA‚Äôs Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory in Virginia. Gilruth received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Minnesota in 1935, and received his Master of Science degree in 1936. While there he was a member of the Professional Engineering Fraternity Theta Tau, of which he was later inducted as a Hall of Fame Alumnus. =Flight test career= In January 1937 Gilruth was hired at NACA‚Äôs Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, where he performed flight research. His research led to the NACA Report R755, Requirements for Satisfactory Flying Qualities of an Airplane, published in 1941, in which he defined a set of requirements for the handling characteristics of an aircraft. Until this point, no set of guidelines for pilots and aircraft designers existed. Gilruth also pioneered the recording of data from instruments during flight test, to be later correlated with the pilot's experience. This would go on to become the standard operating procedure. = NASA career = Gilruth had been working on hypersonic missile rockets as the assistant director of the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division of NACA. He and his team pushed their superiors to pursue a program to launch satellites into space, but he was rebuffed by administrators. The dynamic quickly changed after the Soviets succeeded in launching Sputnik, and Gilruth became involved in the transition of NACA into NASA. When NASA was created, Gilruth became head of the Space Task Group, tasked with putting a man in space before the Soviet Union. In 1961, when President John F. Kennedy announced that America would put a man on the Moon before the end of the decade (the 1960s), Gilruth was \\"aghast\\" and unsure that such a goal could be accomplished. He was integral to the creation of the Gemini program, which he advocated as a means for NASA to learn more about operating in space before attempting a lunar landing. Soon the Apollo program was born, and Gilruth was made head of the NASA center which ran it, the new Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) (now the Johnson Space Center). Gilruth was inducted into the National Space Hall of Fame in 1969 and served as director of the MSC until his retirement in 1972. He was inducted as a member of the inaugural class to the International Space Hall of Fame in 1976. He oversaw a total of 25 manned space flights, from Mercury-Redstone 3 to Apollo 15. In 1971, Gilruth, along with the Apollo 15 crew, was awarded the Collier Trophy. In 1992, Gilruth was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor.

Kaminaljuyu has been described as one of the greatest of all archaeological sites in the New World by Michael Coe,Coe (2005, p. 52) although its remains today ‚Äì a few mounds only ‚Äì are far less impressive than other Maya sites more frequented by tourists. When first mapped scientifically (by E. M. Shook over a period of decades from the 1930s on), it comprised some 200 platforms and pyramidal mounds, at least half of which were created before the end of the Preclassic period (250 AD). Debate continues about the size, scale, and degree by which, as an economic and political entity, it integrated both the immediate Valley of Guatemala and the Southern Maya area.Kaplan, Jonathan 2011 The known parts of Kaminaljuyu lie on a broad plain beneath roughly the western third of modern Guatemala City. The Valley of Guatemala is surrounded by hills which culminate in a string of lofty volcanoes to the south. At an altitude of about 2000 m (7000 feet) above sea level, the climate is temperate. Soils are rich because of frequent volcanic eruptions; volcanic ash in the form of hardened tuff reaches depths of several hundred meters in and around Kaminaljuyu, and deep clefts or barrancas mark the landscape. The Kaminaljuyu site was largely swallowed up by real estate developments in the late 20th century, although a portion of the Classic period center of Kaminaljuyu is preserved as a park. The distinctly unimpressive character of the extant remains is due not only to the location of the ancient city beneath a rapidly expanding Developing World capital city but also because the ancient architecture was constructed of hardened adobe, more perishable than the limestone used to build the cities in the Maya Lowlands. Because of these factors, the true size and scale of Kaminaljuyu is likely to be never known. The state of destruction and the almost daily erasure of archaeological context underscore the many mysteries, in addition to size and scale, that likely will remain unanswered about Kaminaljuyu. Principally these questions are posed about the role of the city as the greatest of the Southern Maya area (SMA) in Preclassic times, particularly during the \\"Miraflores\\" period, c. 400‚Äì100 BC;See Kaplan (2002, pp. 318‚Äì319) for a discussion of the \\"Miraflores\\"; the term is placed within quotation marks because it also refers to a sculptural carving style from Kaminaljuyu, described by Parsons (1986). the SMA is long believed from much and diverse evidence to have been seminal in the development of Maya civilization. Archaeological excavations Kaminaljuyu Monument 65, 290 by 200 by 33 cm Late Preclassic sculpted head, found in Kaminaljuy√∫. Currently on the Museo Nacional de Arqueolog√≠a (National Archaeological Museum, Guatemala). Over the past 100 years, more than fifty archaeological projects, large and small, have been mounted at Kaminaljuyu. In addition to excavations, scholars such as Alfred Maudslay and Samuel K. Lothrop have recorded sculpture and made maps of the site. In 1925 Manuel Gamio undertook limited excavations, finding deep cultural deposits yielding potsherds and clay figurines from what later was called the \\"Middle Cultures\\" of Mesoamerica (from 1500 BC to 150 AD).Gamio, Manuel (1926‚Äì27) Cultural Evolution in Guatemala. Art and Archaeology 22:202‚Äì222; 23; 16‚Äì32; 71‚Äì78; 129‚Äì133 A decade later, the importance of the site was confirmed when a local football club began cutting away the edges of two inconspicuous mounds to lengthen their practice field, discovering an impressive buried structure. Lic. J. Antonio Villacorta C., the Minister of Public Education in Guatemala City, requested archaeologists Alfred Kidder, Jesse Jennings and Edwin Shook to investigate. Villacorta gave the site its name from a K'iche' word meaning \\"mounds of the ancestors.\\" Kidder, Jennings, and Shook's monograph, published by the Carnegie Institution of Washington ‚Äì one of the most important archaeological research entities in the history of Maya scholarship ‚Äì brought excited attention by scholars to the significance of the SMA. This excitement turned to consensus about the priority of high social and cultural developments in the South when Shook and Kidder published their report on Mound E-III-3,Shook and Kidder (1952) a \\"Miraflores\\" mound and the largest known thus far from the site, and which contained seven structures built onion-skin fashion over and around each other through time. Two extraordinarily rich royal tombs were found within the edifices, probably representing consecutive rulers during the \\"Miraflores\\" Preclassic apogee of Kaminaljuyu. In the early 1950s Heinrich Berlin excavated a large mound in the ancient Preclassic core of the city. In the 1960s Pennsylvania State University undertook extensive excavations at Kaminaljuyu, under the direction of William T. Sanders and Joseph W. Michels. The processualist and unilineal cultural evolutionary theoretical orientation of the Penn State project were in sharp contrast to the Carnegie work before and to the historical, cultural-historical, sometimes epigraphy- and art- historically driven paradigm of Lowland Maya research after. In the 1990s, Marion Popenoe de Hatch and Juan Antonio Vald√©s conducted excavations in the southern districts of the site, and a Japanese team investigated a large mound near the modern archaeological park. Emphases since the 1970s on Classic Maya hieroglyphic texts and discoveries of great sites in the northern Pet√©n turned attention away from the SMA, and a long period ensued during which proponents of a Maya Lowlands origins for Maya civilization held sway. More recently, the debate was rejoined with discoveries along the southern Pacific coast of Mexico and in Guatemala that greatly antedate developments in the Lowlands. Occupation history Archeological site in 1890. Photograph by Alfred Percival Maudslay. =Ar√©valo and Las Charcas cultures= Kidder, Jennings, and Shook referred to Kaminaljuyu's artifacts as representative of what they called a \\"Middle Culture\\" which they believed represented the earliest phase of complex social and cultural development in Mesoamerica.They described this as \\"...the oldest known stage in the development of Mesoamerican civilization\\" (1946, p. 243). This reflected their conclusion about the great antiquity of developments at Kaminaljuyu and their belief that Kaminaljuyu was primordial for its cultural and social innovations. Since their work, investigations chiefly undertaken by scholars from the New World Archaeological Foundation on the southern Pacific coast of Mexico have greatly altered this view, deepening in time the incipience of complex social and cultural events in Mesoamerica. Cultures of this phase had a stable agricultural community organized probably as a simple chiefdom. Over many years Shook and Kidder developed the Kaminaljuyu ceramic sequence, and it remains, with refinements by Shook and Marion Popenoe de Hatch, one of the most secure and reliable ceramic chronologies in Mesoamerica, although some doubts remain about the absolute dates due to a paucity of radiocarbon anchors (a revision by Inomata, et al. to the following chronology, based on Bayesian analysis, would push forward the ceramic phases by as much as 300 years, setting the Miraflores apogee to a 100 BC ‚Äì AD 100 time frame). With Inomata, et al's revision in mind, the first significant settlement dates to the Ar√©valo phase, c. 900‚Äì800 BC, with indications of dense populations no later than c. 400 BC. By the end of the Las Charcas culture (800‚Äì350 BC), Kaminaljuyu was developing \\"religious and civic institutions.\\"Shook (1951, p. 98) Scattered Las Charcas remains throughout the Valley of Guatemala mark a major occupation of the area at sites such as El Naranjo;See Arroyo (2007a, b) at this latter site, as well as at El Port√≥nSee Sharer, Robert J. and David W. Sedat (1987) some 50 kilometers to the north and Takalik Abaj, about 130 kilometers to the west in the lower piedmont, plain uncarved upright shaft stones called stelae, mark the first appearance of a cult of time-reckoning and which became one of the bases for the institution of Maya kingship. The architecture of Middle Preclassic structures consisted of hardened adobe bricks that served, later, as foundations for raised platforms and pyramidal temples. Excavations indicate that from early in the Middle Preclassic the community was large enough to produce heavy refuse deposits. Cotton was grown as well as maize; palaeobotanical research also has identified annonas, avocados, cacao, black beans, palm nuts, plums, and sapodilla (zapote blanco). Arboriculture developed ‚Äì with groves of crop trees grown in terraces down to the edges of great ravines. Specialists practiced loom-weaving and were expert potters. Large-scale workshops for obsidian tool-making were spread around the ancient city. Religious practices that would later be further developed throughout Mesoamerica were elaborating during the early Middle Preclassic at Kaminaljuyu, including the erection of mounds to serve as substructures for small shrines or funerary/administrative temples, the development of a complex pantheon of deities ‚Äì probably based on some primordial mythology and cosmology of which the Popol Vuh represents a fragment ‚Äì and euhemerism, an incensario and stela cult, and warfare to procure captives for royal sacrifice. Many of the artifacts from Las Charcas not associated with burials were found in pits. There were principally two types of pits: shallow bowl- like pits and bottle-shaped pits. The shallow pits were possibly used for digging clay to be used in building and later to hold refuse. Carbonized avocado seeds, maize cobs and remnants of textiles, basketry, mats and rope fragments have been found in those that are bottle-shaped. It is thought these pits were used for cooking, storage and refuse containers. Hand-modeled clay female figurines are also highly characteristic of Las Charcas culture. Those found at Kaminaljuyu are generally of reddish brown clay and some have a white slip. The female figurines often depict pregnancy and are thought to have been offerings to promote fertility in the fields. Usually the arms and legs of the figures are mere stumps but some attempt at a realistic body shape has been made. The head has received the most attention to detail. The nose was pinched into the relief and nostrils were made by punctuating the clay. The eyes and the mouth were formed by strategically applied lumps. The figurines often have earplug flares. =The \\"Miraflores\\"= The apogee of Preclassic developments at Kaminaljuyu occurred during what scholars refer to as the \\"Miraflores\\" period ‚Äì once a name for a Late Preclassic ceramic phase, now split into two, the Verbena and Arenal. Preclassic remains, particularly from this epoch, are extremely abundant at Kaminaljuyu; Shook and Kidder noted that in Mound E-III-3 \\"...an average of...200 sherds per cubic meter [were found...the mound] in its final stage [having] a volume of some 75,000 cu. m [yielding] the astounding total of approximately 15,000,000 fragments...[A]llowing 30 sherds to represent one vessel ‚Äì a high average considering the abundance of small pre-Classic bowls...at least 500,000 complete vessels had been used, broken, and their fragments incidentally incorporated in the fill of this one mound.\\"Shook and Kidder (1952, p. 46) What Kidder, Jennings, and Shook referred to as the Middle Cultures are now understood as the Middle Preclassic period, which lasted from 1000 to 400 BC, and the Late Preclassic period, dating from 400 BC to 250 AD. In its \\"Miraflores\\" heyday, enormously eclectic sculpture was placed around the city, in plazas and in front of platforms and temples. Brightly colored murals and giant masks adorned the sides of edifices. Monuments included effigies of toads, bats, owls, jaguars, and serpents; particularly important was the Principal Bird Deity, a symbol of celestial power often invoked in the iconography of kingship. Early versions of other Classic Maya deities were depicted, including the maize god, the Hero Twins, and a merchant god. The sculptural eclecticism is another indication of the Preclassic cosmopolitan and \\"international\\" character of Kaminaljuyu, the role of \\"port-of-trade\\" or \\"gateway\\" capitalSee Brown (1977) and Hirth (1978), respectively continuing through Classic times despite a major change of cultural traditions and, possibly, ethnic affiliation at the end of the Preclassic.See Popenoe de Hatch (1993) Sacred Kingship Enormous thrones and stelae attest to the might and splendor of \\"Miraflores\\" Kaminaljuyu. Stela 10, a fragment of a gigantic throne, is carved with a decapitation narrative scene showing a ruler masked and attired to impersonate an underworld jaguar deity wielding a flint axe over what likely was a kneeling captive; the head of a euhemerized jaguar deity floats to the right of the ruler/protagonist, invoked by the burning of blood in a sacrificial plate. The similarly gigantic Monument 65 is carved, on the front, with three seated, throned rulers, each one framed by two bound, kneeling, nude captives, each ruler and his paired victims vertically positioned within a lower, a central, and an upper register.Kaplan (2000) Almost annually, fragments of once very large sculptural monuments are found in Guatemala City often during unregulated municipal demolition and construction.See, e.g., Stela 67 and Throne 68 (Ugarte Rivera 2001) Many monuments were carved with Preclassic hieroglyphic texts (Kaplan 2011), underscoring the fact that, as Coe observes, \\"the elite of [Kaminaljuyu] were fully literate at a time when other Maya were perhaps just learning that writing existed.\\"Coe (2005, p. 74) Hydraulics In the last twenty years, archaeologists have studied sophisticated water control systems in the southern precincts of \\"Miraflores\\" Kaminaljuyu, indicating an extensive bureaucracy and concomitant social hierarchical must have been in place to supervise and maintain the hydraulics.See Popenoe de Hatch (1997) and Valdes (1998) These systems date to the \\"Miraflores\\" and endured through to the end of the Preclassic. =Esperanza cultures and a Teotihuac√°n Intrusion?= Two major mounds excavated by Kidder, Jennings, and Shook contained tombs probably representing rulers from the Esperanza period. In Mound A the tomb is associated with a pit burial. All that remains in the pit burial of its original fill are worn igneous rocks, quantities of coarse sherds and human skull parts that had been cut through by the digging of the tomb. The tomb contains the remains of eight people. One corpse received special treatment, as evinced by the considerable amount of jewelry and the offerings left with it. The bodies were borne into the tomb on fabric mats or animal hides of which only traces remain. Among the objects found as offerings in the tomb were jade beads around the necks of two of the corpses, wafer-like disc shells forming a choker on one skeleton, jade earplug flares, an unusually large number of shells, a fine obsidian blade, a tortoise shell, metates, and various fine pottery pieces including a whistling jar and a carved tripod vessel. Several coarse brownware vessels heaped against the wall of the tomb probably originally contained food prepared for the after-life journey of the dead. The Esperanza tombs of Mounds A and B are notable because of the interment within them of elite-use ceramic vessels in unmistakable Teotihuac√°n style. Teotihuac√°n was the greatest ancient city in Mesoamerica, with far-flung hegemonic reach from its location in Central Mexico. During the Early Classic period in the Maya world, art and artifacts, as well as hieroglyphics, attest to specific intrusions by and influences from Teotihuac√°n at great Lowland cities such as Tikal, Piedras Negras, and Cop√°n, although the exact nature of this presence remains controversial.See papers in Braswell (2003) Teotihuac√°n, like the later Aztec empire, was drawn to the Southern area undoubtedly because of its rich resources of obsidian and cacao. Dating to Esperanza times and later in the Classic period, twelve ballcourts have been found, possibly indicating an emphasis on resolution of conflicts through ritual game-playing rather than war, which would underscore Kaminaljuyu's role as a nexus and intermediary between powerful foreign entities and as a religious \\"pilgrimage\\" site. Economics Enormous obsidian beds lying 20 km northeast of Guatemala City and known as El Chayal (Kakchikel Maya for \\"obsidian\\") are long presumed to have been the most important material basis for Kaminaljuyu's ascendance as the greatest polity in the SMA as well as its continuation as the preeminent city in the Southern Maya Area during the Classic period. Distinctively black in color, obsidian from the Chayal beds found at sites throughout the Lowlands as well as the Southern Maya Area supports this assumption, although the specifics of control, whether formally under Kaminaljuyu's hegemony or more informally representing a vital material resource whose wealth accrued to the city more or less in direct relation to proximity, remain in the realm of speculation. In addition to Chayal obsidian, the strategic location of Kaminaljuyu as a nexus for trade between the Pacific coast and piedmont and the Maya Lowlands ‚Äì salt, fish, and shells from the coast, cacao and other agricultural products from the piedmont, jaguar skins, feathers, and other commodities from the Lowland jungles ‚Äì underlay Kaminaljuyu's wealth and influence throughout the Maya world.

Seven days later, Arnold and 50 men raided Fort Saint-Jean on the Richelieu River in southern Quebec, seizing military supplies, cannons, and the largest military vessel on Lake Champlain. Although the scope of this military action was relatively minor, it had significant strategic importance. It impeded communication between northern and southern units of the British Army, and gave the nascent Continental Army a staging ground for the invasion of Quebec later in 1775. It also involved two larger-than-life personalities in Allen and Arnold, each of whom sought to gain as much credit and honor as possible for these events. Most significantly, in an effort led by Henry Knox, artillery from Ticonderoga would be dragged across Massachusetts to the heights commanding Boston Harbor, forcing the British to withdraw from that city. Background In 1775, Fort Ticonderoga's location did not appear to be as strategically important as it had been in the French and Indian War, when the French famously defended it against a much larger British force in the 1758 Battle of Carillon, and when the British captured it in 1759. After the 1763 Treaty of Paris, in which the French ceded their North American territories to the British, the fort was no longer on the frontier of two great empires, guarding the principal waterway between them.Randall (1990), p. 86. The French had blown up the fort's powder magazine when they abandoned the fort, and it had fallen further into disrepair since then. In 1775 it was garrisoned by only a small detachment of the 26th Regiment of Foot, consisting of two officers and forty-six men, with many of them \\"invalids\\" (soldiers with limited duties because of disability or illness). Twenty-five women and children lived there as well. Because of its former significance, Fort Ticonderoga still had a high reputation as the \\"gateway to the continent\\" or the \\"Gibraltar of America\\", but in 1775 it was, according to historian Christopher Ward, \\"more like a backwoods village than a fort.\\" Even before shooting started in the American Revolutionary War, American Patriots were concerned about Fort Ticonderoga. The fort was a valuable asset for several reasons. Within its walls was a collection of heavy artillery including cannons, howitzers, and mortars, armaments that the Americans had in short supply.Drake (1873), p. 130. The fort was situated on the shores of Lake Champlain, a strategically important route between the Thirteen Colonies and the British-controlled northern provinces. British forces placed there would expose the colonial forces in Boston to attack from the rear.Ward (1952), Volume 1, p. 64. After the war began with the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, the British General Thomas Gage realized the fort would require fortification, and several colonists had the idea of capturing the fort. Gage, writing from the besieged city of Boston following Lexington and Concord, instructed Quebec's governor, General Guy Carleton, to rehabilitate and refortify the forts at Ticonderoga and Crown Point.Gage (1917), p. 397. Carleton did not receive this letter until May 19, well after the fort had been captured.Lanctot (1967), p. 49. Benedict Arnold had frequently traveled through the area around the fort, and was familiar with its condition, manning, and armaments. En route to Boston following news of the events of April 19, he mentioned the fort and its condition to members of Silas Deane's militia.Randall (1990), p. 85. The Connecticut Committee of Correspondence acted on this information; money was \\"borrowed\\" from the provincial coffers and recruiters were sent into northwestern Connecticut, western Massachusetts, and the New Hampshire Grants (now Vermont) to raise volunteers for an attack on the fort.Randall (1990), p. 87. John Brown, an American spy from Pittsfield, Massachusetts who had carried correspondence between revolutionary committees in the Boston area and Patriot supporters in Montreal, was well aware of the fort and its strategic value. Ethan Allen and other Patriots in the disputed New Hampshire Grants territory also recognized the fort's value, as it played a role in the dispute over that area between New York and New Hampshire.Bellesiles (1995), p. 116. Whether either took or instigated action prior to the Connecticut Colony's recruitment efforts is unclear. Brown had notified the Massachusetts Committee of Safety in March of his opinion that Ticonderoga \\"must be seized as soon as possible should hostilities be committed by the King's Troops.\\"Boatner (1974), p. 1101. When Arnold arrived outside Boston, he told the Massachusetts Committee of Safety about the cannons and other military equipment at the lightly defended fort. On May 3, the Committee gave Arnold a colonel's commission and authorized him to command a \\"secret mission\\", which was to capture the fort.Ward (1952), Volume 1, p. 65. He was issued ¬£100, some gunpowder, ammunition, and horses, and instructed to recruit up to 400 men, march on the fort, and ship back to Massachusetts anything he thought useful.J. Nelson (2006), p. 15. Colonial forces assemble alt=The star-shaped fort is visible in the center of the photograph, with its inner buildings roofed in red. The fort is surrounded by forest, and a body of water (a portion of Lake Champlain) is visible behind the fort. Arnold departed immediately after receiving his instructions. He was accompanied by two captains, Eleazer Oswald and Jonathan Brown, who were charged with recruiting the necessary men. Arnold reached the border between Massachusetts and the Grants on May 6, where he learned of the recruitment efforts of the Connecticut Committee, and that Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys were already on their way north. Riding furiously northward (his horse was subsequently destroyed), he reached Allen's headquarters in Bennington the next day.Randall (1990), p. 86‚Äì89. Upon arrival, Arnold was told that Allen was in Castleton, to the north, awaiting supplies and more men. He was also warned that, although Allen's effort had no official sanction, his men were unlikely to serve under anyone else. Leaving early the next day, Arnold arrived in Castleton in time to join a war council, where he made a case to lead the expedition based on his formal authorization to act from the Massachusetts Committee.Randall (1990), p. 90. The force that Allen had assembled in Castleton included about 100 Green Mountain Boys, about 40 men raised by James Easton and John Brown at Pittsfield, and an additional 20 men from Connecticut.Smith (1907), pp. 124‚Äì125. Allen was elected colonel, with Easton and Seth Warner as his lieutenants. When Arnold arrived on the scene, Samuel Herrick had already been sent to Skenesboro and Asa Douglas to Panton with detachments to secure boats. Captain Noah Phelps, a member of the \\"Committee of War for the Expedition against Ticonderoga and Crown Point\\", had reconnoitered the fort disguised as a peddler seeking a shave. He saw that the fort walls were dilapidated, learned from the garrison commander that the soldiers' gunpowder was wet, and that they expected reinforcements at any time.Randall (1990), p. 91.Phelps (1899), p. 204. He reported this intelligence to Allen, following which they planned a dawn raid. Many of the Green Mountain Boys objected to Arnold's wish to command, insisting that they would go home rather than serve under anyone other than Ethan Allen. Arnold and Allen worked out an agreement, but no documented evidence exists concerning the deal. According to Arnold, he was given joint command of the operation. Some historians have supported Arnold's contention, while others suggest he was merely given the right to march next to Allen. Capture of the fort alt=A green flag with a blue canton. The canton has 13 stars scattered in it. By 11:30 pm on May 9, the men had assembled at Hand's Cove (in what is now Shoreham, Vermont) and were ready to cross the lake to Ticonderoga. However, boats did not arrive until 1:30 am, and they were inadequate to carry the whole force.Jellison (1969), pp. 114‚Äì115. Eighty-three of the Green Mountain Boys made the first crossing with Arnold and Allen, and Douglas went back for the rest. As dawn approached, Allen and Arnold became fearful of losing the element of surprise, so they decided to attack with the men at hand. The only sentry on duty at the south gate fled his post after his musket misfired, and the Americans rushed into the fort. The Patriots then roused the small number of sleeping troops at gunpoint and began confiscating their weapons. Allen, Arnold, and a few other men charged up the stairs toward the officers' quarters. Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham, the assistant to Captain William Delaplace, was awakened by the noise, and called to wake the captain.Randall (1990), p. 95. Stalling for time, Feltham demanded to know by what authority the fort was being entered. Allen, who later claimed that he said it to Captain Delaplace, replied, \\"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\\"Randall (1990), p. 96. Delaplace finally emerged from his chambers (fully clothed, not with \\"his breeches in his hand\\", as Allen would later say) and surrendered his sword. Nobody was killed in the war. The only injury was to one American, Gideon Warren,New York, Pension Claims by Disabled Revolutionary War Veterans, 1779‚Äì1789 who was slightly injured by a sentry with a bayonet.Ward (1952), Volume 1, p. 68. Eventually, as many as 400 men arrived at the fort, which they plundered for liquor and other provisions. Arnold, whose authority was not recognized by the Green Mountain Boys, was unable to stop the plunder. Frustrated, he retired to the captain's quarters to await forces that he had recruited, reporting to the Massachusetts Provincial Congress that Allen and his men were \\"governing by whim and caprice\\" at the fort, and that the plan to strip the fort and send armaments to Boston was in peril.Randall (1990), p. 97. When Delaplace protested the seizure of his private liquor stores, Allen issued him a receipt for the stores, which he later submitted to Connecticut for payment.Jellison (1969), p. 124. Arnold's disputes with Allen and his unruly men were severe enough that there were times when some of Allen's men drew weapons. On May 12, Allen sent the prisoners to Connecticut's Governor Jonathan Trumbull with a note saying \\"I make you a present of a Major, a Captain, and two Lieutenants of the regular Establishment of George the Third.\\"Chittenden (1872), p. 49. Arnold busied himself over the next few days with cataloging the military equipment at Ticonderoga and Crown Point, a task made difficult by the fact that walls had collapsed on some of the armaments.J. Nelson (2006), p. 40. Crown Point and the raid on Fort Saint-Jean alt=The map is oriented with north to the top. The lower section of the map shows Saratoga, New York, and Fort Edward, on the Hudson River. There are red markers depicting the position of John Burgoyne's army near Saratoga at the time of its surrender in 1777. A line of mountains is shown to the right of the Hudson, extending northward but eventually bending off the map to the east. North of Fort Edward are Fort George, at the southern end of Lake George, and Skenesborough, near the southern end of Lake Champlain. About one-third of the way up the map, Lake George joins with Champlain, and Fort Ticonderoga is shown at the northwest side of the junction, with Fort Crown Point a little further north. Lake Champlain extends to the north and is dotted with islands. There is a red line marking the boundary between New York and Quebec, and the upper third of the map shows the Richelieu River extending north to meet the Saint Lawrence River at Sorel, with Montreal southwest of that point. Fort Saint John and Fort Chambly are to the left of the Richelieu, about halfway between the boundary line and Montreal. Seth Warner sailed a detachment up the lake and captured nearby Fort Crown Point, garrisoned by only nine men. It is widely recorded that this capture occurred on May 10; this is attributed to a letter Arnold wrote to the Massachusetts Committee of Safety on May 11, claiming that an attempt to sail up to Crown Point was frustrated by headwinds. However, Warner claimed, in a letter dated May 12 from \\"Head Quarters, Crown Point\\", that he \\"took possession of this garrison\\" the day before. It appears likely that, having failed on May 10, the attempt was repeated the next day with success, as reported in Warner's memoir.Chipman (1848), p. 141 A small force was also sent to capture Fort George on Lake George, which was held by only two soldiers.Randall (1990), p. 98 Troops recruited by Arnold's captains began to arrive, some after seizing Philip Skene's schooner Katherine and several bateaux at Skenesboro.Smith (1907), p. 155Morrissey (2000), p. 10 Arnold rechristened the schooner . The prisoners had reported that the lone British warship on Lake Champlain was at Fort Saint-Jean, on the Richelieu River north of the lake. Arnold, uncertain whether word of Ticonderoga's capture had reached Saint-Jean, decided to attempt a raid to capture the ship. He had Liberty outfitted with guns, and sailed north with 50 of his men on May 14.Randall (1990), p. 101 Allen, not wanting Arnold to get the full glory for that capture, followed with some of his men in bateaux, but Arnold's small fleet had the advantage of sail, and pulled away from Allen's boats. By May 17, Arnold's small fleet was at the northern end of the lake. Seeking intelligence, Arnold sent a man to reconnoiter the situation at Fort Saint- Jean. The scout returned later that day, reporting that the British were aware of the fall of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and that troops were apparently on the move toward Saint-Jean. Arnold decided to act immediately.Randall (1990), p. 103 Rowing all night, Arnold and 35 of his men brought their bateaux near the fort. After a brief scouting excursion, they surprised the small garrison at the fort, and seized supplies there, along with , a seventy-ton sloop-of- war.Smith (1907), p. 157 Warned by their captives that several companies were on their way from Chambly, they loaded the more valuable supplies and cannons on the George, which Arnold renamed the . Boats that they could not take were sunk, and the enlarged fleet returned to Lake Champlain. This activity was observed by Moses Hazen, a retired British officer who lived near the fort. Hazen rode to Montreal to report the action to the local military commander, and then continued on to Quebec City, where he reported the news to General Carleton on May 20. Major Charles Preston and 140 men were immediately dispatched from Montreal to Saint-Jean in response to Hazen's warning.Lanctot (1967), pp. 44,50 Fifteen miles out on the lake, Arnold's fleet met Allen's, which was still heading north. After an exchange of celebratory gunfire, Arnold opened his stores to feed Allen's men, who had rowed in open boats without provisions. Allen, believing he could seize and hold Fort Saint-Jean, continued north, while Arnold sailed south.Randall (1990), p. 105 Allen arrived at Saint-Jean on May 19, where he was warned that British troops were approaching by a sympathetic Montreal merchant who had raced ahead of those troops on horseback.Lanctot (1967), p. 44 Allen, after penning a message for the merchant to deliver to the citizens of Montreal, returned to Ticonderoga on May 21, leaving Saint-Jean just as the British forces arrived.Randall (1990), p. 106 In Allen's haste to escape the arriving troops, three men were left behind; one was captured, but the other two eventually returned south by land.Jellison (1969), p. 131 Aftermath alt=A black-and-white photograph. Ruined wall sections are visible in the center, with a tree growing out of the center of one of the structures. The lake is visible in the background, and hazy land is visible even further back. Ethan Allen and his men eventually drifted away from Ticonderoga, especially once the alcohol began to run out, and Arnold largely controlled affairs from a base at Crown Point.J. Nelson (2006), p. 53. He oversaw the fitting of the two large ships, eventually taking command of Enterprise because of a lack of knowledgeable seamen. His men began rebuilding Ticonderoga's barracks, and worked to extract armaments from the rubble of the two forts and build gun carriages for them. Connecticut sent about 1,000 men under Colonel Benjamin Hinman to hold Ticonderoga, and New York also began to raise militia to defend Crown Point and Ticonderoga against a possible British attack from the north. When Hinman's troops arrived in June, there was once again a clash over leadership. None of the communications to Arnold from the Massachusetts committee indicated that he was to serve under Hinman; when Hinman attempted to assert authority over Crown Point, Arnold refused to accept it, as Hinman's instructions only included Ticonderoga.J. Nelson (2006), p. 61. The Massachusetts committee eventually sent a delegation to Ticonderoga. When they arrived on June 22 they made it clear to Arnold that he was to serve under Hinman. Arnold, after considering for two days, disbanded his command, resigned his commission, and went home, having spent more than ¬£1,000 of his own money in the effort to capture the fort.Randall (1990), pp. 128‚Äì129. When Congress received news of the events, it drafted a second letter to the inhabitants of Quebec, which was sent north in June with James Price, another sympathetic Montreal merchant. This letter, and other communications from the New York Congress, combined with the activities of vocal American supporters, stirred up the Quebec population in the summer of 1775.Lanctot (1967), pp. 55‚Äì60. When news of the fall of Ticonderoga reached England, Lord Dartmouth wrote that it was \\"very unfortunate; very unfortunate indeed\\".Jellison (1969), p. 120. =Repercussions in Quebec= News of the capture of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and especially the raids on Fort Saint-Jean, electrified the Quebec population. Colonel Dudley Templer, in charge of the garrison at Montreal, issued a call on May 19 to raise a militia for defense of the city, and requested Indians living nearby to also take up arms. Only 50 men, mostly French-speaking landowning seigneurs and petty nobility, were raised in and around Montreal, and they were sent to Saint-Jean; no Indians came to their aid. Templer also prevented merchants sympathetic to the American cause from sending supplies south in response to Allen's letter.Lanctot (1967), p. 45. General Carleton, notified by Hazen of the events on May 20, immediately ordered the garrisons of Montreal and Trois-Rivi√®res to fortify Saint-Jean. Some troops garrisoned at Quebec were also sent to Saint-Jean. Most of the remaining Quebec troops were dispatched to a variety of other points along the Saint Lawrence, as far west as Oswegatchie, to guard against potential invasion threats.Lanctot (1967), p. 50. Carleton then traveled to Montreal to oversee the defense of the province from there, leaving the city of Quebec in the hands of Lieutenant Governor Hector Cramah√©.Lanctot (1967), p. 53. Before leaving, Carleton prevailed on Monsignor Jean-Olivier Briand, the Bishop of Quebec, to issue his own call to arms in support of the provincial defense, which was circulated primarily in the areas around Montreal and Trois- Rivi√®res.Lanctot (1967), p. 52. =Later actions near Ticonderoga= \\"Knox entering camp with artillery\\" In July 1775, General Philip Schuyler began using the fort as the staging ground for the invasion of Quebec that was launched in late August.Smith (1907), p. 250. In the winter of 1775‚Äì1776, Henry Knox directed the transportation of the guns of Ticonderoga to Boston. The guns were placed upon Dorchester Heights overlooking the besieged city and the British ships in the harbor, prompting the British to evacuate their troops and Loyalist supporters from the city in March 1776.French (1911), pp. 387‚Äì419. Benedict Arnold again led a fleet of ships at the Battle of Valcour Island, and played other key roles in thwarting Britain's attempt to recapture the fort in 1776.Randall (1990), pp. 290‚Äì314. The British did recapture the fort in July 1777 during the Saratoga campaign, but had abandoned it by November after Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga.Morrissey (2000), p. 86. =Broken communications= Although Fort Ticonderoga was not at the time an important military post, its capture had several important results. Rebel control of the area meant that overland communications and supply lines between British forces in Quebec and those in Boston and later New York were severed, so the British military command made an adjustment to their command structure. This break in communication was highlighted by the fact that Arnold, on his way north to Saint-Jean, intercepted a message from Carleton to Gage, detailing the military troop strengths in Quebec.J. Nelson (2006), p. 42. Command of British forces in North America, previously under a single commander, was divided into two commands. General Carleton was given independent command of forces in Quebec and the northern frontier, while General William Howe was appointed Commander-in-Chief of forces along the Atlantic coast, an arrangement that had worked well between Generals Wolfe and Amherst in the French and Indian War.Mackesy (1993), p. 40. In this war, however, cooperation between the two forces would prove to be problematic and would play a role in the failure of the Saratoga campaign in 1777, as General Howe apparently abandoned an agreed-upon northern strategy, leaving General John Burgoyne without southern support in that campaign.Van Tyne (1905), pp. 161‚Äì162. =War of words between Allen and Arnold= alt=A black-and-white print of a head-and-shoulders portrait. Arnold faces left, with his light- colored hair tied back. He is wearing a dark military jacket with light- colored lapels, and the ruffles of his shirt are visible. The jacket has epaulets decorated with two stars. Beginning on the day of the fort's capture, Allen and Arnold began a war of words, each attempting to garner for himself as much credit for the operation as possible. Arnold, unable to exert any authority over Allen and his men, began to keep a diary of events and actions, which was highly critical and dismissive of Allen. Allen, in the days immediately after the action, also began to work on a memoir. Published several years later (see Further reading), the memoir fails to mention Arnold at all. Allen also wrote several versions of the events, which John Brown and James Easton brought to a variety of Congresses and committees in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Randall (1990) claims that Easton took accounts written by both Arnold and Allen to the Massachusetts committee, but conveniently lost Arnold's account on the way, ensuring that Allen's version, which greatly glorified his role in the affair, would be preferred.Randall (1990), p. 99. Smith (1907) indicates that it was highly likely that Easton was interested in claiming Arnold's command for himself.Smith (1907), p. 184. There was clearly no love lost between Easton and Arnold. Allen and Easton returned to Crown Point on June 10 and called a council of war while Arnold was with the fleet on the lake, a clear breach of military protocol. When Arnold, whose men now dominated the garrison, asserted his authority, Easton insulted Arnold, who responded by challenging Easton to a duel. Arnold later reported, \\"On refusing to draw like a gentleman, he having a [sword] by his side and cases of loaded pistols in his pockets, I kicked him very heartily and ordered him from the Point.\\"Randall (1990), p. 121.

History In the early 1940s, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company purchased, in a short time span, ten bush airlines: Ginger Coote Airways, Southern Air Transport, Wings, Prairie Airways, Mackenzie Air Services, Arrow Airways, Starratt Airways, Quebec Airways and Montreal & Dominion Skyways finishing with the purchase of Canadian Airways in 1942, to form Canadian Pacific Air Lines. Early management were largely bush flying pioneers, including president Grant McConachie, superintendent Punch Dickins, and Wop May, who would become a repair depot manager in Calgary. In 1968, Canadian Pacific Air Lines was rebranded as CP Air. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company (renamed Canadian Pacific Limited in 1971) had decided to align the airline's name and \\"Multimark\\" design to that of its other subsidiaries, including CP Hotels, CP Ships, and CP Transport (CP Rail was spun off from the parent company later). Battle with TCA CP Air battled with the government- owned (and government-financed) Trans-Canada Air Lines (TCA, later Air Canada) for international and transcontinental routes for much of its history. Despite early attempts to merge into one national carrier, CP Air continued to operate routes based on its previous bush flying heritage. The federal government established limits on domestic market share and, through international agreements, limits on which countries CP Air could fly to. This barred CP Air from the traditional routes such as London and Paris and limited their access to major Canadian routes such as Vancouver-Toronto and Toronto-New York. CP was forced to develop other overseas routes. Overseas and international routes Bristol Britannia 314 \\"Empress of Rome\\" at Manchester Airport in 1965 A Douglas DC-8 at London Gatwick Airport in 1977 The development of the great circle or polar route to the Far East from CP Air's Vancouver base would become one of the cornerstones of the airline. Grant McConachie managed to secure flights to Amsterdam, Australia, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, which helped the airline's revenue grow from $3 million in 1942 to $61 million by 1964. Flights to Sydney via stops in Honolulu, Kanton Island (which was a technical stop) and Fiji as well as to Hong Kong via Tokyo (preceded by a technical stop at Shemya Island in Alaska) started in 1949, with Canadair North Star aircraft (which was a version of the DC-4); Douglas DC-4s then took over in 1951 followed by Douglas DC-6Bs in 1953.http://www.timetableimages.com, Aug. 1, 1951 Canadian Pacific Air Lines system timetable Flights to Lima, Peru started in 1953 (extended to Buenos Aires in 1956) and to Amsterdam in 1955. In August 1956 three Douglas DC-6B flights a week departed Vancouver for Amsterdam, with two flights departing for Tokyo and Hong Kong, one flight to Auckland, one flight to Sydney, and one flight to Buenos Aires. Several of the key routes in the early days were as follows: * Flight numbers 1 & 2, flying Hong Kong - Tokyo - Vancouver - Edmonton - Winnipeg - Toronto - Montreal * Flights 301/302, flying Sydney - Nadi - Honolulu - Vancouver - Edmonton, and non-stop via the Polar route to Amsterdam. Other flights to Europe included Lisbon, Milan, Rome, and Athens. * Flights 401/402, flying Vancouver, Mexico City, Lima, Santiago and Buenos Aires * Flights 501/502, Mexico City - Toronto - Santa Maria (Azores) - Lisbon - Madrid Other routes duplicated parts of the above, but from the 1959 Intercontinental Timetable these appear to be the main routes, and show the inventiveness that Canadian Pacific Airlines needed to employ and how they developed other overseas routes for Canada. The airline was flying DC-4s and DC-6Bs internationally in the 1950s, introducing turboprop Bristol Britannia aircraft in 1958. Douglas DC-8 jetliners began to replace them from 1961, but the Britannias continued on routes that were unsuitable for the new jets well into the 1960s - for example on the route to New Zealand until Whenuapai closed to civil traffic in November 1965. The big Britannia propjet was also used to fly non-stop service from Windsor, Ontario to Mexico City with this flight originating in Toronto before being replaced by a DC-8.http://www.timetableimages.com, April 29, 1962 & Oct. 31, 1965 Canadian Pacific Air Lines system timetable Closer to home, non-stop Boeing 737-200 service from Vancouver to San Francisco was being flown by 1970 followed by non-stop Boeing 727-100 service from Vancouver to Los Angeles by the mid 1970s.http://www.timetableimages.com, Oct. 25, 1970 & April 25, 1976 CP Air system timetables Also during the mid 1970s, CP Air was operating stretched Douglas DC-8-63 jetliners (which the airline called the Super DC-8 \\"Spacemaster\\") on the Vancouver-Honolulu-Nandi-Sydney route twice a week.http://www.timetableimages.com, April 25, 1976 CP Air system timetable Service to New Zealand resumed in 1985 along with non-stop flights from Vancouver to Hong Kong, and in 1986 CP Air became the first North American airline with a non-stop flight between North America and Mainland China with a weekly flight to Shanghai. Flights to Beijing, Bangkok, Rio de Janeiro, and S√£o Paulo were added in 1987. CP Air Boeing 747, Boeing 737 and Boeing 727 Beautiful Orange Jets at Toronto International Airport in 1975 Although Canadian Pacific was not allowed scheduled routes to certain European countries, they were permitted to serve countries which Trans Canada Airlines/Air Canada did not choose to serve, so they developed schedules from 1960 onwards to Netherlands (Amsterdam), Italy (Milan and Rome), Greece (Athens), and later several other international destinations. Amsterdam was their principal European destination for these services, with direct flights to both Eastern and Western Canada, and connections were emphasized onwards to other countries. They also developed extensive charter flights (operated mainly in summertime) beginning in the mid-1960s and through the 1970s and 1980s to Britain, France, Germany and other European points which permitted them some access to these markets. Unusually for charter flights, they were listed in detail in their system timetables to show the full reach of the airline. Open skies A Boeing 737-200 at San Francisco International Airport in 1983 By the late 1970s and early 1980s, many of the routes CP Air had pioneered such as Vancouver‚ÄìTokyo were now very lucrative and the previous distribution of routes was considered unfair. In 1979, the federal government eliminated the fixed market share of transcontinental flights for Air Canada (the successor to TCA). While this was a condition that was pressed by CP Air for a long time, it now scrambled to upgrade its fleet to expand on newly available routes such as new nonstop service from Vancouver to Hong Kong and Shanghai to go along with adding more flights to its then current routes like Amsterdam, Rome, Tokyo and Sydney to prepare for increased competition from Air Canada in its traditional territory. This required massive fleet renewal and an associated debt of $1 billion. This debt load, the increased competition, and the economic downturn in Asia would all work against CP Air's future. Rebranding and sale A Boeing 737-200 in the 1986 rebrand livery, later used as the basis for the Canadian Airlines livery Having been renamed CP Air in 1968 with a new orange livery, the airline in 1986 reverted to its original name, Canadian Pacific Air Lines, with a new navy blue colour scheme and logo. This occurred shortly after the airline had taken over operations of Eastern Provincial Airways. This new incarnation, however, was short-lived. Less than a year later, in 1987, Canadian Pacific Air Lines was sold, along with Quebec's Nordair, to Calgary-based Pacific Western Airlines (PWA) for $300 million. PWA assumed the airline's debt of $600 million. In April 1987, PWA announced that the new name of the merged airline would be Canadian Airlines International. In 2000, Canadian Airlines was taken over by and merged into Air Canada.

Its headwaters also drain a small portion of southeastern Missouri. Via the White River, the Cache is part of the Mississippi River watershed, placing the river and surrounding watershed in the Arkansas Delta. Ecology The river supports 53 mammalian species, over 200 bird species, and nearly 50 species of reptiles and amphibians. The refuge is also the most important wintering area for mallard ducks and other migratory waterfowl on the continent. As a result, low-lying areas in the vicinity of the river's lower course are a popular destination for duck hunters. The area has the only remaining population of native black bears in the state. This is also where the ivory-billed woodpecker was recently speculated to have been sighted (after it was believed to be extinct for 60 years).Audubon Magazine, July‚ÄìAugust, 2007. Page 16. The Ivory Bill, Giving Up The Ghost? The watershed also contains the largest remaining tract of contiguous bottomland hardwood forest found in North America. Because of these combination of these unique features, the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge was created along approximately along the river's lower reaches this location was also used by team trees to plant some of there 20 million trees. Hydrology The Cache is formed by a confluence of agricultural ditches in Butler County, Missouri and soon enters Arkansas, flowing generally south- southwestwardly. Several portions of the river's upper course have been straightened and channelized. It joins the White River at the town of Clarendon, Arkansas. The river is a slow muddy river with meandering channels, sloughs, swampy areas, and oxbow lakes. History During the American Civil War, the Battle of Cotton Plant was fought along the Cache River at the town of Cotton Plant. =Etymology= The name of the river is probably a Picardie word meaning \\"hunt\\" as a reference to the abundant wildlife along the river. The first explorer into the area was Father Marquette, for whom Picard was the native tongue.

She was an independent candidate, placing tenth in a field of 135 candidates. She ran on an eleven- point platform that included somewhat tongue-in-cheek promises of taxing breast implants, making lap dances tax-deductible, and creating a \\"Porn for Pistols\\" exchange program. In June 2005, Carey announced her bid for Lieutenant Governor of California as an independent in 2006. She dropped out of the race in October 2006 to take care of her mother who had jumped off a building while off her medications. Mary Carey attending a website launch party in Hollywood, CA on May 2, 2009 Personal life In April 2005, Carey was arrested in connection with a Lakewood, Washington, cabaret sting operation, for violating a city strip club ordinance that forbids dancers from sexually touching themselves. She subsequently made a plea agreement and received a 19-month sentence, which was suspended on the condition that she was not charged with any other offense within one year. =VH1 appearance= Carey at an industry party in 2005In January/February 2008, Carey was featured on the VH1 reality TV series Celebrity Rehab, receiving treatment for alcoholism. While on Celebrity Rehab, she stated that she would leave the porn industry and straighten out her life because of her mother, who was hospitalized in Florida after jumping off a four-story building as a suicide attempt the previous month. In the reunion episode of the show taped approximately six months after leaving rehab, she claimed she had not made an adult movie since becoming sober and intends to never make another one. However, she continues to \\"feature dance\\" in clubs, saying that she needs the money to care for her mother, but also hopes to stop doing this. In an interview with AVN magazine, Carey stated that she had entered rehab to tackle an addiction to Xanax (which she had developed around the time she dropped out of her second run for governor) and that the focus on alcohol was created by the show. In 2009, she made a film titled Celebrity Pornhab with Dr. Screw. The film is a pornographic parody of the VH1 show, and includes a sex scene between Mary Carey and a female costar. Drew Pinsky commented in a January 2010 TV Guide story, \\"She puts together, like, six weeks at a time of sobriety, then drifts away.

They directly connect the cytoplasm of two cells, which allows various molecules, ions and electrical impulses to directly pass through a regulated gate between cells. One gap junction channel is composed of two connexons (or hemichannels), which connect across the intercellular space. Gap junctions are analogous to the plasmodesmata that join plant cells. Gap junctions occur in virtually all tissues of the body, with the exception of adult fully developed skeletal muscle and mobile cell types such as sperm or erythrocytes. Gap junctions, however, are not found in simpler organisms such as sponges and slime molds. A gap junction may also be called a nexus or macula communicans. While an ephapse has some similarities to a gap junction, by modern definition the two are different. Structure In vertebrates, gap junction hemichannels are primarily homo- or hetero-hexamers of connexin proteins. Invertebrate gap junctions comprise proteins from the innexin family. Innexins have no significant sequence homology with connexins. Though differing in sequence to connexins, innexins are similar enough to connexins to state that innexins form gap junctions in vivo in the same way connexins do. The recently characterized pannexin family, which was originally thought to form inter-cellular channels (with an amino acid sequence similar to innexins), in fact functions as a single-membrane channel that communicates with the extracellular environment, and has been shown to pass calcium and ATP. At gap junctions, the intercellular space is between 2 and 4 nm and unit connexons in the membrane of each cell are aligned with one another. Gap junction channels formed from two identical hemichannels are called homotypic, while those with differing hemichannels are heterotypic. In turn, hemichannels of uniform connexin composition are called homomeric, while those with differing connexins are heteromeric. Channel composition is thought to influence the function of gap junction channels. Before innexins and pannexins were well characterized, the genes coding for connexin gap junction channels were classified in one of three groups, based on gene mapping and sequence similarity: A, B and C (for example, , ). However, connexin genes do not code directly for the expression of gap junction channels; genes can produce only the proteins that make up gap junction channels. An alternative naming system based on this protein's molecular weight is also popular (for example: connexin43=GJA1, connexin30.3=GJB4). Levels of organization # DNA to RNA to Connexin protein. # One connexin protein has four transmembrane domains # 6 Connexins create one Connexon (hemichannel). When different connexins join together to form one connexon, it is called a heteromeric connexon # Two hemichannels, joined together across a cell membrane comprise a Gap Junction channel. When two identical connexons come together to form a Gap junction channel, it is called a homotypic GJ channel. When one homomeric connexon and one heteromeric connexon come together, it is called a heterotypic gap junction channel. When two heteromeric connexons join, it is also called a heterotypic Gap Junction channel. # Several gap junction channels (hundreds) assemble within a macromolecular complex called a gap junction plaque. Properties of connexon channel pairs Light microscope images do not allow us to see connexons themselves but do let us see the fluorescing dye injected into one cell moving into neighboring cells when gap junctions are known to be present A connexon channel pair: # Allows for direct electrical communication between cells, although different connexin subunits can impart different single channel conductances, from about 30 pS to 500 pS. # Allows for chemical communication between cells, through the transmission of small second messengers, such as inositol triphosphate () and calcium (), although different connexin subunits can impart different selectivity for particular small molecules. # In general, allows transmembrane movement of molecules smaller than 485 Daltons (1,100 Daltons through invertebrate gap junctions ), although different connexin subunits may impart different pore sizes and different charge selectivity. Large biomolecules, for example, nucleic acid and protein, are precluded from cytoplasmic transfer between cells through gap junction connexin channels. # Ensures that molecules and current passing through the gap junction do not leak into the intercellular space. To date, five different functions have been ascribed to gap junction protein: # Electrical and metabolic coupling between cells # Electrical and metabolic exchange through hemichannels # Tumor suppressor genes (Cx43, Cx32 and Cx36) # Adhesive function independent of conductive gap junction channel (neural migration in neocortex) # Role of carboxyl-terminal in signaling cytoplasmic pathways (Cx43) Occurrence and distribution Gap Junctions have been observed in various animal organs and tissues where cells contact each other. From the 1950s to 1970s they were detected in crayfish nerves, rat pancreas, liver, adrenal cortex, epididymis, duodenum, muscle, Daphnia hepatic caecum, Hydra muscle, monkey retina, rabbit cornea, fish blastoderm, frog embryos,J. Cell Biol. 1974 Jul;62(1) 32-47.Assembly of gap junctions during amphibian neurulation. Decker RS, Friend DS. rabbit ovary, re-aggregating cells, cockroach hemocyte capsules, rabbit skin, chick embryos, human islet of Langerhans, goldfish and hamster pressure sensing acoustico-vestibular receptors, lamprey and tunicate heart, rat seminiferous tubules, myometrium, eye lens and cephalopod digestive epithelium. Since the 1970s gap junctions have continued to be found in nearly all animal cells that touch each other. By the 1990s new technology such as confocal microscopy allowed more rapid survey of large areas of tissue. Since the 1970s even tissues that were traditionally considered to possibly have isolated cells such as bone showed that the cells were still connected with gap junctions, however tenuously. Gap junctions appear to be in all animal organs and tissues and it will be interesting to find exceptions to this other than cells not normally in contact with neighboring cells. Adult skeletal muscle is a possible exception. It may be argued that if present in skeletal muscle, gap junctions might propagate contractions in an arbitrary way among cells making up the muscle. At least in some cases this may not be the case as shown in other muscle types that do have gap junctions. An indication of what results from reduction or absence of gap junctions may be indicated by analysis of cancers or the aging process. Functions Gap junctions may be seen to function at the simplest level as a direct cell to cell pathway for electrical currents, small molecules and ions. The control of this communication allows complex downstream effects on multicellular organisms as described below. =Embryonic, organ and tissue development= In the 1980s, more subtle but no less important roles of gap junction communication have been investigated. It was discovered that gap junction communication could be disrupted by adding anti-connexin antibodies into embryonic cells. Embryos with areas of blocked gap junctions failed to develop normally. The mechanism by which antibodies blocked the gap junctions was unclear but systematic studies were undertaken to elucidate the mechanism. Refinement of these studies showed that gap junctions appeared to be key to development of cell polarity and the left/right symmetry/asymmetry in animals. While signaling that determines the position of body organs appears to rely on gap junctions so does the more fundamental differentiation of cells at later stages of embryonic development. Gap junctions were also found to be responsible for the transmission of signals required for drugs to have an effect and conversely some drugs were shown to block gap junction channels. =Gap junctions and the \\"bystander effect\\"= Cell death The \\"bystander effect\\" with its connotations of the innocent bystander being killed is also mediated by gap junctions. When cells are compromised due to disease or injury and start to die messages are transmitted to neighboring cells connected to the dying cell by gap junctions. This can cause the otherwise unaffected healthy bystander cells to also die. The bystander effect is, therefore, important to consider in diseased cells, which opened an avenue for more funding and a flourish of research. Later the bystander effect was also researched with regard to cells damaged by radiation or mechanical injury and therefore wound healing. Disease also seems to have an effect on the ability of gap junctions to fulfill their roles in wound healing. Tissue restructuring While there has been a tendency to focus on the bystander effect in disease due to the possibility of therapeutic avenues there is evidence that there is a more central role in normal development of tissues. Death of some cells and their surrounding matrix may be required for a tissue to reach its final configuration and gap junctions also appear essential to this process. There are also more complex studies that try and combine our understanding of the simultaneous roles of gap junctions in both wound healing and tissue development. =Areas of electrical coupling= Gap junctions electrically and chemically couple cells throughout the body of most animals. Electrical coupling can be relatively fast acting. Tissues in this section have well known functions observed to be coordinated by gap junctions with inter-cellular signaling happening in time frames of micro-seconds or less. Heart Gap junctions are particularly important in cardiac muscle: the signal to contract is passed efficiently through gap junctions, allowing the heart muscle cells to contract in unison. Gap junctions are expressed in virtually all tissues of the body, with the exception of adult fully developed skeletal muscle and mobile cell types such as sperm or erythrocytes. Several human genetic disorders are associated with mutations in gap junction genes. Many of those affect the skin because this tissue is heavily dependent upon gap junction communication for the regulation of differentiation and proliferation. Cardiac gap junctions can pharmacologically be opened with rotigaptide. Neurons A gap junction located in neurons is often referred to as an electrical synapse. The electrical synapse was discovered using electrical measurements before the gap junction structure was described. Electrical synapses are present throughout the central nervous system and have been studied specifically in the neocortex, hippocampus, vestibular nucleus, thalamic reticular nucleus, locus coeruleus, inferior olivary nucleus, mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, ventral tegmental area, olfactory bulb, retina and spinal cord of vertebrates. There has been some observation of weak neuron to glial cell coupling in the locus coeruleus, and in the cerebellum between Purkinje neurons and Bergmann glial cells. It appears that astrocytes are coupled by gap junctions, both to other astrocytes and to oligodendrocytes. Moreover, mutations in the gap junction genes Cx43 and Cx56.6 cause white matter degeneration similar to that observed in Pelizaeus‚ÄìMerzbacher disease and multiple sclerosis. Connexin proteins expressed in neuronal gap junctions include: # mCX36 # mCX57 # mCX45 with mRNAs for at least five other connexins (mCx26, mCx30.2, mCx32, mCx43, mCx47) detected but without immunocytochemical evidence for the corresponding protein within ultrastructurally-defined gap junctions. Those mRNAs appear to be down-regulated or destroyed by micro interfering RNAs ( miRNAs ) that are cell-type and cell-lineage specific. Retina Neurons within the retina show extensive coupling, both within populations of one cell type, and between different cell types. Discovery =Naming= Gap junctions were so named because of the \\"gap\\" shown to be present at these special junctions between two cells. With the increased resolution of the transmission electron microscope (TEM) gap junction structures were first able to be seen and described in around 1953. Annular gap junction cross section in TEM thin section. Gap junctions are usually linear rather than annular in TEM thin sections. It is thought that annular gap junctions result from engulfment by one of the two cells of the membrane plaque to form a vesicle within the cell. This example shows three layers to the junction structure. The membrane from each cell is the dark line with the whiter narrow gap between the two darkly stained membranes. In such electron micrographs there may appear to be up to 7 layers. Two lipid mono-layers in each membrane can stain as 3 layers plus one layer from the gap between them, similar to two stacked bread sandwiches with space between them The term \\"gap junction\\" appeared to be coined about 16 years later circa 1969. A similar narrow regular gap was not demonstrated in other intercellular junctions photographed using the TEM at the time. =Form an indicator of function= Well before the demonstration of the \\"gap\\" in gap junctions they were seen at the junction of neighboring nerve cells. The close proximity of the neighboring cell membranes at the gap junction lead researchers to speculate that they had a role in intercellular communication, in particular the transmission of electrical signals. Gap junctions were also proven to be electrically rectifying and referred to as an electrical synapse. Later it was found that chemicals could also be transported between cells through gap junctions. Implicit or explicit in most of the early studies is that the area of the gap junction was different in structure to the surrounding membranes in a way that made it look different. The gap junction had been shown to create a micro-environment between the two cells in the extra-cellular space or \\"gap\\". This portion of extra-cellular space was somewhat isolated from the surrounding space and also bridged by what we now call connexon pairs which form even more tightly sealed bridges that cross the gap junction gap between two cells. When viewed in the plane of the membrane by freeze-fracture techniques, higher-resolution distribution of connexons within the gap junction plaque is possible. Connexin free islands are observed in some junctions. The observation was largely without explanation until vesicles were shown by Peracchia using TEM thin sections to be systematically associated with gap junction plaques. Peracchia's study was probably also the first study to describe paired connexon structures, which he called somewhat simply a \\"globule\\". Studies showing vesicles associated with gap junctions and proposing the vesicle contents may move across the junction plaques between two cells were rare, as most studies focused on the connexons rather than vesicles. A later study using a combination of microscopy techniques confirmed the early evidence of a probable function for gap junctions in intercellular vesicle transfer. Areas of vesicle transfer were associated with connexin free islands within gap junction plaques. =Electrical and chemical nerve synapses= Because of the widespread occurrence of gap junctions in cell types other than nerve cells the term gap junction became more generally used than terms such as electrical synapse or nexus. Another dimension in the relationship between nerve cells and gap junctions was revealed by studying chemical synapse formation and gap junction presence. By tracing nerve development in leeches with gap junction expression suppressed it was shown that the bidirectional gap junction (electrical nerve synapse) needs to form between two cells before they can grow to form a unidirectional \\"chemical nerve synapse\\". The chemical nerve synapse is the synapse most often truncated to the more ambiguous term \\"nerve synapse\\". =Composition= Connexins The purification of the intercellular gap junction plaques enriched in the channel forming protein (connexin) showed a protein forming hexagonal arrays in x-ray diffraction. Now systematic study and identification of the predominant gap junction protein became possible. Refined ultrastructural studies by TEM showed protein occurred in a complementary fashion in both cells participating in a gap junction plaque. The gap junction plaque is a relatively large area of membrane observed in TEM thin section and freeze fracture (FF) seen filled with trans-membrane proteins in both tissues and more gently treated gap junction preparations. With the apparent ability for one protein alone to enable intercellular communication seen in gap junctions the term gap junction tended to become synonymous with a group of assembled connexins though this was not shown in vivo. Biochemical analysis of gap junction rich isolates from various tissues demonstrated a family of connexins. Ultrastructure and biochemistry of isolated gap junctions already referenced had indicated the connexins preferentially group in gap junction plaques or domains and connexins were the best characterized constituent. It has been noted that the organisation of proteins into arrays with a gap junction plaque may be significant. It is likely this early work was already reflecting the presence of more than just connexins in gap junctions. Combining the emerging fields of freeze-fracture to see inside membranes and immunocytochemistry to label cell components (Freeze-fracture replica immunolabelling or FRIL and thin section immunolabelling) showed gap junction plaques in vivo contained the connexin protein. Later studies using immunofluorescence microscopy of larger areas of tissue clarified diversity in earlier results. Gap junction plaques were confirmed to have variable composition being home to connexon and non-connexin proteins as well making the modern usage of the terms \\"gap junction\\" and \\"gap junction plaque\\" non- interchangeable. In other words, the commonly used term \\"gap junction\\" always refers to a structure that contains connexins while a gap junction plaque may also contain other structural features that will define it. The \\"plaque\\" or \\"formation plaque\\" Immunofluorescence microscopy video of connexins being moved along microtubules to the surface of a cell. Early descriptions of \\"gap junctions\\" and \\"connexons\\" did not refer to them as such and many other terms were used. It is likely that \\"synaptic disks\\" were an accurate reference to gap junction plaques. While the detailed structure and function of the connexon was described in a limited way at the time the gross \\"disk\\" structure was relatively large and easily seen by various TEM techniques. Disks allowed researchers using TEM to easily locate the connexons contained within the disk like patches in vivo and in vitro. The disk or \\"plaque\\" appeared to have structural properties different from those imparted by the connexons alone. It was thought that if the area of membrane in the plaque transmitted signals the area of membrane would have to be sealed in some way to prevent leakage. Later studies showed gap junction plaques are home to non-connexin proteins making the modern usage of the terms \\"gap junction\\" and \\"gap junction plaque\\" non- interchangeable as the area of the gap junction plaque may contain proteins other than connexins. Just as connexins do not always occupy the entire area of the plaque the other components described in the literature may be only long term or short term residents. Studies allowing views inside the plane of the membrane of gap junctions during formation indicated that a \\"formation plaque\\" formed between two cells prior to the connexins moving in. They were particle free areas when observed by TEM FF indicating very small or no transmembrane proteins were likely present. Little is known about what structures make up the formation plaque or how the formation plaque's structure changes when connexins and other components move in or out. One of the earlier studies of the formation of small gap junctions describes rows of particles and particle free halos. With larger gap junctions they were described as formation plaques with connexins moving into them. The particulate gap junctions were thought to form 4‚Äì6 hours after the formation plaques appeared. How the connexins may be transported to the plaques using tubulin is becoming clearer. The formation plaque and non-connexin part of the classical gap junction plaque have been difficult for early researchers to analyse. It appears in TEM FF and thin section to be a lipid membrane domain that can somehow form a comparatively rigid barrier to other lipids and proteins. There has been indirect evidence for certain lipids being preferentially involved with the formation plaque but this cannot be considered definitive. It is difficult to envisage breaking up the membrane to analyse membrane plaques without affecting their composition. By study of connexins still in membranes lipids associated with the connexins have been studied. It was found that specific connexins tended to associate preferentially with specific phospholipids. As formation plaques precede connexins these results still give no certainty as to what is unique about the composition of plaques themselves. Other findings show connexins associate with protein scaffolds used in another junction, the zonula occludens ZO1.

A veteran of World War I, the Polish- Ukrainian and Polish‚ÄìSoviet Wars, Maczek was the commander of Poland's only major armoured formation during the September 1939 campaign, and later commanded a Polish armoured formation in France in 1940. He was the commander of the famous 1st Polish Armoured Division, and later of the I Polish Army Corps under Allied Command in 1942‚Äì45. Family Stanis≈Çaw W≈Çadys≈Çaw Maczek was born on 31 March 1892 in the Lw√≥w suburb of Szczerzec (now Ukrainian: Shchirets), then in Austro-Hungarian Galicia. His father was a lawyer, who after retiring opened chambers in Drohobycz. His family was of distant Croatian extraction; he was a cousin of the Croatian politician Vladko Maƒçek. Education After graduating from the grammar school at Drohobycz in 1910, he attended the philosophy faculty of Lw√≥w University where he studied Polish philologyEditor Zbigniew Mieczkowski The Soldiers of General Maczek in World War II Page 16 (i.e. language and literature). Among his tutors were the renowned Polish philologists and J√≥zef Kallenbach, He also attended lectures by Kazimierz Twardowski. During his studies he served in the Strzelec paramilitary organization, in which he received basic military training. After the outbreak of World War I, Maczek interrupted his studies, hoping to join J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's Polish Legions, but instead was drafted into the Austro- Hungarian Army. World War I After receiving a brief officer training, Maczek was sent to the Italian Front of World War I. Initially an NCO in the Tyrolean Regiment of the K.u.K. Army, he was promoted to second lieutenant in 1916 and then in 1918 to lieutenant. As the only Polish battalion commander in Austria-Hungary's Alpine regiments, Maczek gained experience in mountain warfare, which proved valuable in his later career. Poland's borders On 11 November 1918, after receiving news of the Armistice, Maczek disbanded his battalion and returned to the newly reborn Poland. Three days later he arrived at Krosno, where he joined the Polish Army. Assigned the command of a Krosno battalion, Maczek began a limited offensive against the forces of the West Ukrainian People's Republic (ZUNR) with the aim of relieving his besieged hometown. However, due to insufficient support, after initial successes at Ustrzyki, Chyr√≥w and Felsztyn, the Polish offensive got bogged down and the Polish-Ukrainian War turned into trench warfare for the rest of the winter. In April 1919 Maczek was withdrawn from his unit and became the organizer and commander of the so-called 'flying' company (') as part of Gen. Aleksandrowicz's 4th Infantry Division. This unit, created on Maczek's initiative, was modelled after the German Sturmbataillone of World War I and was highly mobile, with horse-drawn vehicles (in the singular, taczanka, podwoda) from Austrian Army depots, and well-equipped with heavy machine guns. The unit was formed mostly from battle-hardened troops of the Krosno battalion, and its combat value was well above the average of the Polish Army of the time. Hence it served in a \\"firefighter\\" capacity, plugging holes that appeared in defensive lines, but also fighting with distinction in the Polish spring offensive. It took part in some of the heaviest fighting of the war, including the battles for Drohobycz, Stanis≈Çaw√≥w, Buczacz, and finally the ZUNR capital, Stryj. After the end of the Polish-Ukrainian fighting, Maczek was confirmed in the rank of major with seniority from 1 June 1919. He was then attached to General 's Polish 2nd Army as a staff officer. Bored with staff duties, Maczek repeatedly asked his superiors to give him command over a front-line unit. His wish was fulfilled only after the start of the Polish- Bolshevik War, when the 2nd Army suffered a defeat in initial clashes with Semyon Budyonny's 1st Cavalry Army. In Jaros≈Çaw, Maczek formed a new 'flying' rifle battalion, mostly composed of fresh recruits and horseless uhlans. Despite insufficient training, the unit was moved to the front and Maczek again acted as a \\"firefighter\\", moving his unit quickly to wherever it was needed. His unit covered the retreat of the Polish forces at Mosty Wielkie, after which it was attached to Gen. Juliusz R√≥mmel's 1st Cavalry Division. It took part in the Polish assault on Warƒô≈º near Zamo≈õƒá, a tactical counter- assault on the rear of Budyonny's advancing Cossacks directly preceding the victorious battle of Komar√≥w. After the end of hostilities, Maczek's battalion was officially named after him, although it was disbanded shortly after the signing of the treaty of Riga. Interwar years Maczek decided not to resume his studies at Lw√≥w University and remained in active service. Between 1921 and 1923 he commanded an infantry battalion within the Lw√≥w-based 26th Infantry Regiment. On 1 August 1923 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and sent to the Higher Military School in Warsaw. He graduated the following year and served until 1927 as head of Section II (intelligence) in Lw√≥w. Later that year he moved to Grodno, where he became deputy commander of the 76th Infantry Regiment. In 1929, after finishing his training, he became commander of the Grodno-based 81st Infantry Regiment, holding that post until 1934. During that time, on 1 January 1931, he was promoted to colonel. In 1935 he was transferred to Czƒôstochowa, where he became commander of infantry (practically, deputy commander of the whole division) in the 7th Infantry Division. In October 1938 Maczek's experience as a commander of \\"flying\\" troops received recognition from his superiors, and he was given command of the Polish 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade, the first fully motorized formation in the Polish Army. September 1939 On the outbreak of war in September 1939, the 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade was attached to the Krak√≥w ArmyKrzysztof Barbarski Polish Armour 1939‚Äì1945 Page 8 defending Lesser Poland and Silesia. Equipped with only light tanks and tankettes and with only one artillery battery of just eight heavy cannons, the brigade went into battle on the first day of war. After the Battle of Jordan√≥w, Maczek's unit faced the entire German XVIII Corps of Gen. Eugen Beyer and successfully shielded the southern flank of the Polish forces, along the Beskids. Supported by only a few battalions of Border Guards and National Defence troops, Maczek's motorized brigade faced two Panzer divisions (4th Light Division under von Hubicki and 2nd Panzer Division under Veiel), as well as the 3rd Mountain Division under Eduard Dietl. For five days Maczek's brigade fought bravely and efficiently, slowing the pace of the German Blitzkrieg to a bloody crawl: despite numerical and technical superiority, the Germans were unable to make more than 10 kilometres headway per day. Maczek's men took maximum advantage of the mountainous terrain, halting many German attacks and occasionally counter-attacking. However, after the front of the Krak√≥w Army was broken to the north of the brigade's position, Maczek's formation was pulled out of the front line. The brigade then fought as a screening unit, defending the bridges and fords in Lesser Poland, until it arrived at Lw√≥w and joined the city's defences. It formed a mobile reserve during the battle for Lw√≥w, allowing other Polish units to withdraw towards the Romanian Bridgehead. However, the plan was made obsolete by the invasion of Poland by the Soviet Union on 17 September. After two days, Marshal of Poland Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy ordered the brigade to cross the Hungarian border. Maczek's brigade was interned in Hungary. Although the unit had lost about half of its men, it had not been defeated in open combat, and therefore gained respect even from the enemy. It is considered to be the only Polish unit not to have lost a single battle in 1939. Maczek was not only esteemed by his superiors but also loved by his soldiers, who referred to him as ', a traditional Polish highlanders' name for a shepherd.  France, 1940  Stanis≈Çaw Maczek, 1944 After the end of the September campaign Maczek made it to France, where he joined the re-created Polish Army and was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general. He was made the commanding officer of the Polish military camp in Co√´tquidan. He then prepared a detailed report on the workings of German Blitzkrieg tactics, and possible precautions against it. This report was, however, completely disregarded by the French general staff (the Germans captured it ‚Äì unopened). He also started gathering any 10th Brigade veterans who had reached France in two camps in Paimpont and Campeneac. His aim was to preserve the integrity of his former unit and prevent the conscription of some of the best-trained Polish soldiers into standard infantry formations, where their experience would probably have been wasted. However, the French command was initially not interested in the formation of a Polish armoured unit and the Polish 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade received almost no equipment. It was not until March 1940 that Maczek received a dozen obsolete FT-17 tanks for training, plus a few dozen cars and motorcycles. Everything changed when Germany invaded France in the spring of 1940, by simply bypassing the Maginot Line. General Maczek's unit suddenly received all the equipment that had been asked for, under one condition: they had to go into action immediately. That proved impossible, because many Polish soldiers had no idea how to use the new equipment and there was no time for training exercises. General Maczek decided to lead a small force of his best- trained men, hoping that the rest of his unit would join them later. That small force was called the 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade (') in honour of the \\"Black Brigade\\" from 1939. On 6 June, 10th Brigade had one tank battalion, two strong motorized cavalry squadrons, one anti-tank battery and one anti- aircraft battery. It was attached to the French 4th Army near Reims and ordered to cover its left flank.Stanislaw Mikolajczyk The Pattern of Soviet Domination Sampson Low, Marston & Co 1948 Page 8 However, Maczek's unit was much too weak to achieve success against German armoured divisions. Polish soldiers managed to cover only one retreating French infantry division by attacking German forces in Champaubert-Montgivroux. Later the brigade had to withdraw with the rest of the French troops and joined the French XXIII Corps. On 16 June the brigade attacked by night the town of Montbard over the Burgundy Canal. Maczek's soldiers achieved complete surprise and took many German prisoners. However, by then the brigade was fighting alone, with the French units on both flanks either routed or in retreat. There were no French forces to take advantage of that victory and the decimated Polish unit found itself surrounded and without fuel. On 18 June, Maczek decided to destroy unusable equipment and withdraw on foot. Later that day he had to split the remnants of his brigade into small groups, so they could pass through the enemy lines. Many of Maczek's men, including the general himself, found their way through Vichy France, North Africa and Portugal to the United Kingdom, where a Polish armored unit was recreated, while others joined the Polish and French resistance organizations in France and Belgium. Maczek relocated to London. Scotland Initially, the British high command wanted to use the recreated Polish Army solely for defence of the Scottish coastline between Aberdeen and Edinburgh, and the veterans of the Polish tank formations who arrived to the UK were pressed into the Polish 2nd Rifle Brigade under General Rudolf Orlicz-Dreszer. However, immediately on Maczek's arrival the idea was abandoned and General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski managed to persuade the British government to create instead a Polish armoured unit.Garlinski, Jozef. Poland in the Second World War, p. 235; After two years of training at the Blairgowrie training ground, in February 1942 General Maczek formed the 1st Polish Armoured Division. Initially serving in defence of the Scottish coast between Montrose and the Firth of Forth, the Division was equipped by the British authorities with state-of-the-art Churchill and M4 Sherman tanks in preparation for the Normandy landings. To Germany Towards the end of July 1944 the Polish 1st Armoured Division was transferred to Normandy, where it was to prove its worth during the 1944 invasion of Normandy. Attached to the First Canadian Army, Maczek's men entered combat on 8 August, seeing service during Operation Totalize. The division twice suffered attacks of friendly fire from U.S. Army Air Force aircraft, yet achieved a brilliant victory against the Wehrmacht in the battles for Mont Ormel, Hill 262 and the town of Chambois. In this series of offensive and defensive operations, which came to be known as the Battle of Falaise, 14 German Wehrmacht and SS divisions were trapped in the huge Chambois pocket and destroyed. Maczek's division had the crucial role of closing the pocket to block the escape route of the German divisions.John Keegan Six Armies in Normandy; , Chapter 7, \\"A Polish Battlefield\\" After this decisive battle, Maczek's Division continued to spearhead the Allied drive across the battlefields of northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands and finally Germany. During its progress it liberated Ypres, Oostnieuwkerke, Roeselare, Tielt, Ruislede and Ghent in Belgium. (Coincidentally, the Polish word maczek means \\"poppy\\" in English, the symbol of remembrance associated with the area around Ypres in the First World War.) Thanks to an outflanking manoeuvre, it proved possible to free Breda in the Netherlands after a hard fight but without incurring losses in the town's population. A petition on behalf of 40,000 inhabitants of Breda resulted in Maczek being made an honorary Dutch citizen after the war. The Division's finest hour came when its forces accepted the surrender of the German naval base of Wilhelmshaven, taking captive the entire garrison, together with some 200 vessels of Hitler's Kriegsmarine. Maczek commanded the 1st Armoured Division until the end of European hostilities and was promoted to major- general. After the capitulation of Germany he went on to command the Polish I Corps and became commanding officer of all Polish forces in the United Kingdom until their demobilization in 1947. Exile Breda, Netherlands After the war, Maczek was stripped of Polish citizenship by the Communist government of the People's Republic of Poland, and thus had to remain in Britain. He left the army on 9 September 1948The Poles in Britain 1940‚Äì2000 (ed. Peter Stachura), Chapter 6 (by Evan McGilvray), p. 64; but was for some reason denied a general's pension by the British government. As a result, Maczek worked as a bartender at an Edinburgh hotel until the 1960s.The Poles in Britain 1940‚Äì2000, ibid., p. 54. Although living in the United Kingdom, General Stanis≈Çaw Maczek had a strong connection to the Netherlands. Besides being a regional hero to the areas he liberated in World War II, he was awarded honorary citizenship of the city of Breda. Recently acquired archive documents show that the Polish general secretly received a yearly allowance from the Dutch government, for the rest of his life. He got his allowance, because Mayor Claudius Prinsen of Breda was worried in 1950,National Archives (Netherlands) NL-HaNA, Buitenlandse Zaken / Code-Archief 65‚Äì74, 2.05.313, inv.nr. 25330,brief van Prinsen aan de Nederlandse ambassadeur in Groot- Brittanni√´, 6 maart 1950 after receiving information that Maczek was in a 'difficult financial situation'. The Polish general was doing unskilled labor to make ends meet. He also had to take care of a chronically ill daughter who needed costly treatment. The mayor of Breda informed the Dutch national government that a war hero was in financial need. He made an appeal to the government to help the man that liberated the Netherlands.National Archives (Netherlands) NL-HaNA, Buitenlandse Zaken / Code-Archief 65‚Äì74, 2.05.313, inv.nr. 25330, Intern memorandum A.P. Hoevelaak t.b.v. dossier Maczek 726.2, onderwerp: ‚ÄòRadio-aktie ten behoeve van dochter Generaal Maczek‚Äô The government decided quickly and awarded Maczek an indexed general's pension, which was paid for by the Ministry of Foreign affairs from a secret budget. The Dutch government did not want this to be made public, due to its sensitive nature.National Archives (Netherlands) NL-HaNA, Buitenlandse Zaken / Code- Archief 65‚Äì74, 2.05.313, inv.nr. 25330, Verzoek van ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken (Mr. Simons) aan Binnenlandse Zaken omtrent de goedkeuring en geheimhouding van het verlenen van jaargeld aan generaal Maczek, 21 November 1951 In the Cold War period, announcing that the Dutch were paying a non-communist Polish ex-general, would certainly strain diplomatic relations with the communist Polish government and the Soviet Union. Not to mention, it would confront the British government with a not so proud moment in their history. Uninformed about his improved financial situation, the Dutch public responded at once in 1965 when news came that his chronically ill daughter needed costly medical treatment in Spain. The Dutch population raised a substantial amount of money following a national radio broadcast for the Maczek family, helping out the general that liberated them. In 1972 an appeal was made by the Poolse Katholieke Vereniging in Nederland to the Dutch Parliament. This organization became the voice for the remaining Polish veterans in the Netherlands and asked for compensation of pension lost due to the aftermath of the war.National Archives (Netherlands) NL-HaNA, Defensie / Militair Personeel, 2.13.5372, inv.nr. 165. Verzoekschrift van de Poolse Katholieke Vereniging in Nederland aan de voorzitter van de Tweede Kamer der Staten Generaal, 23 juni 1972 The Dutch Ministry of Defence did not meet this request, based upon the Algemene Militaire Pensioenwet (1966), which stipulates that non-Dutch persons needed to have been associated with the Dutch Armed Forces during the war period, in order to be entitled to a wartime pension.National Archives (Netherlands) NL-HaNA, Defensie / Militair Personeel, 2.13.5372, inv.nr. 165. Antwoord van het Ministerie van Defensie op het verzoekschrift van de Poolse Katholieke Vereniging in Nederland, 15 September 197 In 1989, the last Polish Communist Government of Prime Minister Mieczys≈Çaw Rakowski issued a public apology to the General, and in 1994 he was presented with Poland's highest state decoration, the Order of the White Eagle. Lieutenant General Stanis≈Çaw Maczek died on 11 December 1994, at the age of 102.The Poles in Britain 1940‚Äì2000, ibid., p. 67. According to his last wish, he was laid to rest among his soldiers at the Polish military cemetery in Breda, the Netherlands. Each year during Liberation Day festivities, Breda is visited by a large Polish contingent and the city devotes part of the festivities to the fallen Polish soldiers. Many artefacts and memorabilia belonging to Maczek and the 1st Polish Armoured Division are on display in the Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum in London. In 2018 a bronze statue was unveiled in honour of General Maczek in the quadrangle of the Edinburgh City Chambers. A footpath crossing Bruntsfield Links which leads to the general's former home in Arden Street in Marchmont, has been named General Maczek Walk.

The style uses Neoclassical architectural forms, minimal carving, planar expanses of highly grained veneers, and applied decorative painting. It is a style transitional between Louis XVI and Empire.

In its use of Neoclassical architectural form and decorative motifs the style anticipates the slightly later and more elaborate Empire style, which was introduced after Napoleon established the First French Empire. The Directoire style reflected the Revolutionary belief in the values of republican Rome: > \\"The stoic virtues of Republican Rome were upheld as standards not merely > for the arts but also for political behaviour and private morality. > Conventionels saw themselves as antique heroes.

He is a man with a large baseball for a head. He can be seen at Citi Field during Mets home games, has appeared in several commercials as part of ESPN's This is SportsCenter campaign, and has been elected into the Mascot Hall of Fame. On April 30, 2012, Forbes Magazine listed Mr. Met as the number one mascot in all of sports. History The second version of the Mr. Met head, as seen on display at the Mets Hall of Fame and Museum at Citi Field. Mr. Met was first introduced on the cover of game programs, yearbooks, and on scorecards in 1963, when the Mets were still playing at the Polo Grounds in northern Manhattan. Comic book artist Al Avison was at least one of the artists who contributed to the character's design. When the Mets moved to Shea Stadium in 1964, fans were introduced to a live costumed version, portrayed by team ticket office employee, Daniel J. Reilly. Mr. Met is believed to have been the first mascot in Major League Baseball to exist in human (as opposed to artistically rendered) form. He was also the first person on the Mets to be represented by a bobblehead doll. Mr. Met with Mrs. Met in 2013 In the 1960s, Mr. Met occasionally appeared in print with a female companion, Mrs. Met (originally called \\"Lady Met\\"), and less frequently with a group of three \\"little Mets\\" children; the smallest was a baby in Lady Met's arms. Mrs. Met was debuted in a short lived live costumed form in 1975 before being reintroduced in 2013. In the mid-1970s, the Metropolitans franchise began to dissolve the Mr. Met mascot. In 1976, he appeared on the cover of the New York Mets Official Yearbook. After that time, he was not utilized in their advertising and he remained absent for almost 20 years. He was phased out prior to the upsurge in mascot popularity caused by The Famous Chicken and the Phillie Phanatic in the late '70s. In 1979, after the Mets discontinued use of Mr. Met, the team briefly experimented with a new mascot named \\"Mettle the mule\\" that was a living animal that would parade along the foul lines prior to a game. In 1992, long time Mets fan, Lois Kaufmann of Queens, New York, wrote a compelling appeal for his reinstatement and asking the Mets to resurrect the mascot. The team did not act quickly or grant Lois her request to be Mr. Met. However, in 1994, they did follow her advice and revived Mr. Met as part of a promotion with Nickelodeon. After a long absence, Mr. Met was quickly reembraced by New York Mets fans and has since remained a constant part of the franchise. Mr. Met is prominently featured in signage all over Citi Field. He was also heavily used in Shea Stadium signage, as seen in this photo. On April 14, 2002, the Mets held a birthday party for Mr. Met at Shea Stadium. It was attended by costumed mascots from all around Major League Baseball and by Sandy the Seagull, mascot of the Brooklyn Cyclones, a Mets farm team. In the 2003 season, first baseman Tony Clark was the first Mets player ever to wear #00, Mr. Met's number. In June of that season, he switched to #52 when Queens schoolchildren asked him what had happened to Mr. Met. On September 14, 2007, Mr. Met was elected into the Mascot Hall of Fame. Beginning on August 14, 2009, throughout their series against the San Francisco Giants, the Mets wore throwback jerseys featuring a Mr. Met patch on the right sleeve. Currently, Mr. Met can be seen at Citi Field during and after games. He is usually found near Mr. Met's Kiddie Field where fans can meet and pose for pictures with him. He can be rented for special events and private parties. Mr. Met is also featured on Mets Money, which are $1, $5 and $10 denomination gift certificates accepted at concession stands and souvenir shops at Citi Field. The design is somewhat reminiscent of standard U.S. currency, but instead features images of Mr. Met attired and posed similarly to the historical official (Washington, Lincoln or Hamilton) featured on the respective bill. The second version of the Mr. Met head is now on display at the New York Mets Hall of Fame and Museum at Citi Field. He Is \\"Baseball's Favorite Mascot\\" In 2013, the Mets introduced batting practice caps featuring Mr. Met on the front. In 2014, a Mr. Met sleeve patch is featured on the Mets' blue alternate home and road jerseys. In 2015, a far more detailed Mr. Met backstory was written by a longtime fan in cooperation with the team and published by Mascot Books. Performers Mr. Met has been portrayed by many people over the years. Dan Reilly was the first person to wear the Mr. Met costume, starting in 1964. In 2007, Reilly wrote a book about his experiences with the team, called The Original Mr. Met Remembers. Mr. Met was portrayed from 1994 through 1997 by AJ Mass, currently a fantasy sports writer for ESPN and author of the book How Fantasy Sports Explains the World, published in August 2011. Aj also wrote a book on sport mascots in titiled, Yes, It's Hot in Here: Adventures in the Weird, Woolly World of Sports Mascots. The book explores the history of mascots, motivations for becoming a mascot and gender diversity in the world of mascots. He also talks to the pioneers among modern-day mascots like Dave Raymond (Phillie Phanatic), Dan Meers (K. C. Wolf), and Glenn Street (Harvey the Hound) and finds out what it is about being a mascot that simply won't leave the performer. AJ Mass also wrote an article for ESPN on June 1st, 2017, titled Take it from a former Mr. Met: It ain't easy being a mascot. In this article, Mass went into detail about the hardships of being a mascot. This article was written after Mr. Met gave the fan the finger during a game (see below). Matt Golden portrayed Mr. Met from 1999 to 2011. On May 31, 2017, Mr. Met was heading back to the clubhouse after a Mets loss when he engaged in a heated exchange with an opposing fan. The argument ended with Mr. Met giving the finger towards the fan, which was caught on video. The Mets then changed performers for Mr. Met. Inside Baseball Mr. Met at Fenway Park In a 2003 This is SportsCenter ad, when the show ends, everyone rushes out of the studio, creating a massive traffic jam. It then shows Mr. Met and Lady Met driving home on the freeway (with the Met children in the back), with Lady Met subtitled as saying they were glad to get out early. The New York Mets theme song, \\"Meet the Mets\\", is on their car radio. (A shorter version with just the Mets family has Mrs. Met accusing Mr. Met of making eyes at one of the female ESPN sportscasters.) In 2009, Mr. Met appeared in another This is SportsCenter ad, which Mr. Met is talking with Stuart Scott at a microwave. When Josh Hamilton shows up to use the microwave, Mr. Met angrily gestures at him and walks away. Hamilton is confused until Scott reveals that some of the balls Hamilton hit in the 2008 Home Run Derby were actually relatives of the mascot. In 2007, Mr. Met became a spokesman for MTA New York City Transit, appearing on several advertisements and safety messages within the New York City Subways and buses. He was also featured in commercials for MLB 06: The Show, a video game for Sony's PlayStation 2, where a camera crew followed him around as he performed his daily duties, such as buying coffee and picking up his laundry. In 2010, he began appearing in commercials for Citi Bank that aired during Mets broadcasts, inducing Mets fans to join him in a \\"Let's Go Mets\\" cheer during mundane activities such as business meetings. He has his own Build-A- Bear Workshop store, but instead of at Citi Field, it's located at the Mets' flagship store on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue. Mr. Met was featured on the remake of The Odd Couple. In it Oscar Madison was to throw out the first pitch. His estranged father (Garry Marshall) is with him and the senior Madison gets Oscar so mad that he hits Mr. Met in the head.The Odd Couple season 2 The Mets get Oscar to, as a publicity stunt, apologize to Mr. Met. In 2019, Mr. Met appeared in an episode of Madam Secretary. Newly elected President Elizabeth McCord, anxious about throwing a ceremonial pitch at a Mets game, dreams she knocks out Mr. Met instead. Mr. Met and the Phillie Phanatic did a MasterCard commercial in 2013 to raise money for ending cancer.

It is one of his most popular and melodious compositions, and has inspired a great many choreographers since its inception. The piece was composed between 1940 and 1944. Part way through writing it Prokofiev broke off to write his opera War and Peace. The premiere of Cinderella was conducted by Yuri Fayer on 21 November, 1945, at the Bolshoi Theatre, with choreography by Rostislav ZakharovProkofiev website and Galina Ulanova in the title role. Cinderella is notable for its jubilant music, lush scenery, and for the comic double-roles of the step-sisters (which can be performed in travesti), more mad than bad in this treatment. Story Act I Cinderella, a young woman whose domineering step-mother forces her to act as a servant in her own home, helps her step- mother and two step-sisters to prepare for the Spring Ball, at which it is rumoured that the Prince will choose his bride-to-be. As the two step-sisters work together to produce a new shawl, they get into an argument over who will wear it, and end up tearing it in two through their bickering. The pair storm off, while the step-mother orders Cinderella to clear up the remnants and finish her chores, as her father returns home from business. Since her father's remarriage, Cinderella has had to sleep by the kitchen fireplace, leaving her nothing to wear but rags covered in ashes. Her father has never moved past the grief of his first wife's death, and though he is concerned for his daughter, he is just as much under the step-mother's control as Cinderella herself is. Their brief peace is interrupted, however, as the mother and sisters reenter and begin ordering them about. During supper, a beggar woman turns up, asking for shelter. The sisters and mother try to chase her off, but Cinderella offers her a place by the kitchen fire and an old pair of slippers. The beggar thanks her for her kindness and departs, leaving the preparations for the ball to resume. After choosing dresses and a quick dancing lesson, the family finally sets off for the night with the father reluctantly in tow, leaving Cinderella behind. Although lonely at first, she cheers herself up by dancing with her broom, imagining the Prince himself has asked her for a dance. She is surprised, however, when the beggar woman appears out of nowhere, wishing to return the slippers with her thanks. To Cinderella's amazement, the shoes have been transformed into dancing slippers of glass. The beggar woman throws off her disguise and reveals herself as Cinderella's fairy godmother, come to grant her wish of going to the ball. Summoning the fairies of Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter for assistance, she turns Cinderella's rags into a beautiful dress, a pumpkin and mice into a carriage and horses, and grasshoppers and dragonflies into a retinue of footmen. As she is about to leave, however, the fairy godmother warns her that the magic will only last until midnight, at which time the spell will break, and everything will revert to its original form. Only the glass slippers will remain as a gift for her kindness. She then summons twelve dwarfs, who will appear to repeat her message if she has not left by midnight. With this warning in mind, Cinderella departs for the ball. Act II The Spring Ball is in full swing, with guests arriving from all over the kingdom and beyond to dance and pay respect to the Prince. The two step-sisters attempt to win favour with the royal court by showing off their dancing skills, but have less than successful results, much to their mother's dismay. The Prince then joins the celebrations, but finding state events such as the Spring Ball dull, and being reluctant to enter a marriage without love, he declines any offers for a dance, particularly in the case of the obnoxious step-sisters. Cinderella by Frederick Ashton, Polish National Ballet, Warsaw 2010 At this point, Cinderella arrives at the palace, transformed beyond recognition into a beautifully dressed princess. The Prince, along with everyone else, is entranced by her beauty and charm, and for the first time, he asks for a dance. As the evening passes, the two become inseparable; Cinderella quickly becomes beloved by the entire court for her graciousness and charm, while the Prince is unusually enthusiastic and cheery in her company. When refreshments are served, he gives her the honour of taking one of three oranges, a delicacy imported to the kingdom from a far-off land. Cinderella offers the other two oranges to her step-sisters, who are so flattered by the attention that they do not recognize the beautiful stranger as their sister. The Prince takes Cinderella out to the royal gardens for an evening walk, where they dance and proclaim the love blossoming between them. As they return to the ballroom for the next waltz, Cinderella has completely forgotten about the time in her happiness. However, at the first stroke of midnight, the twelve dwarfs spring from the great palace clock and remind Cinderella of her godmother's warning. Terrified of being unmasked as a lowly servant in rags, she flees from the ballroom to the astonishment of the other guests. Though the Prince pursues her, she vanishes into the night moments before the spell breaks, losing one of her glass slippers in her haste and panic. The Prince is heartbroken at the thought of losing his love so soon after discovering her, but upon finding the lost slipper, he vows not to rest until he is once again reunited with her. Act III The morning after the ball, the Prince summons every shoemaker in the kingdom, in order to find out who the slipper was made for. However, none of them claim to have crafted the shoe, or sold it to anybody recently, and he concludes that the princess must be from a foreign land. His desperate search brings him first to the Mediterranean, then to the Orient, and lands further beyond. After travelling across the world and meeting various beautiful princesses with no success, the Prince begins to search his own kingdom, trying the slipper on every maiden who attended the ball. Back at Cinderella's home, love has allowed the Prince to defy the laws of time and space; though she is only awakening the morning after the ball, he has already traveled the world and back again in search of his lost love. Upon waking, Cinderella initially believes that the events of the previous night were only a dream. As she relives some of the dances of the ball, she discovers the remaining glass slipper and realizes that it was all true. At breakfast, the step-sisters reminisce about the ball, and argue about who made the greater impression on the Prince at the ball. Their fighting is interrupted when the father and step-mother hurry in with the news that the Prince is on his way to their house, desperately trying a glass slipper on every girl he encounters. Upon his arrival, he tries the slipper on the two step-sisters, to no avail. The step-mother, however, demands to be given a chance and tries to force her foot into the shoe, ordering Cinderella to help her. As she bends down to assist, the remaining slipper falls from her pocket and the Prince finally recognizes Cinderella for who she is. As Cinderella successfully tries on both glass slippers, her step-family beg for her forgiveness, which she happily bestows upon them. Overjoyed to have rediscovered each other, Cinderella and the Prince are then transported away to a secret garden by the fairy godmother, where they confess their love for one another and are happily married.

He is considered one of the co-founders of the Town of York, Upper Canada, now Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Biography Berczy was born in Wallerstein, Swabia, Electorate of Bavaria (part of the Holy Roman Empire and now in Germany) as a son of the Wirklicher Hofrat (Albrecht Theodor Moll) and Johanna Josepha Walpurga Moll (n√©e Hefele). Berczy was originally named Johann Albrecht Ulrich Moll, but following marriage changed his name. He studied at the Akademie der bildenden K√ºnste in Vienna and at the University of Jena in Saxony. His early career was spent in several European countries, including Italy (meeting with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in Florence) and England, where he exhibited at the Royal Academy. In 1792 Berczy sailed for the Americas, settling in Philadelphia, then setting up a business in York, Upper Canada (now Toronto). A few years later, his work took him to Lower Canada (Quebec). Berczy married, on November 1, 1785, Jeanne-Charlotte Berczy n√©e Allamand (1760‚Äì1839) of Lausanne (canton of Bern, now - since 1803 - canton of Vaud), Switzerland. They had two sons, William Bent Berczy and Charles Albert Berczy. His son Charles Albert Berczy became the second postmaster of Toronto. Berczy helped John Graves Simcoe establish a settlement north of York, which became the town of Markham. Berczy built homes in York and Markham, including Russell Abbey in York. Berczy painted. His two best known pictures are a full-length portrait of the Mohawk chief Thayendanegea (Joseph Brant) (c. 1805) and a group portrait of the Woolsey FamilyWoolsey Family (1809). Although best known for his portraits, he also carried out religious paintings and architectural work, including plans for Christ Church Cathedral in Montreal in 1803, and was a surveyor. Berczy travelled to New York City during the War of 1812 and was stranded when attempting to travel. He first stayed in Middlebury, Vermont with friends, then to Albany, New York then to New York City from which he planned to travel to England. He fell ill while in New York and died while in the care of friends. He was buried in an unmarked grave at Trinity Church as William Burksay. His wife moved in with her son William and died on September 18, 1839 in Sainte-M√©lanie, Lower Canada. Berczy was also survived by his other son, Charles Albert Berczy. Legacy An elementary school in central Markham is named William Berczy Public School in his honour. The school, founded in 1967, has approximately 600 students in grades K-8. Current principal is Lindsey Rhamey. The Vice Principal is Alex Pasta. Also in honour of this founder, the then Town of Markham named one of its densely populated neighbourhoods after him, the Berczy Village. Berczy Creek is a tributary of the Rouge River in Markham. A bronze statue of Berczy will be situated in at Berczy Square, a park to be built at Berczy Village near Kennedy Road and 16th Avenue in Markham. Within Berczy Village is William Berczy Settlement Historical Cemetery. William Berczy Boulevard is a major road from Major Mackenzie Drive to 16th Avenue in Berczy Village, Berczy Gate is a short street near Highway 7 and Ninth Line and Berczy Creek Way is a short road near 16th Avenue and Warden Avenue in Markham. In Toronto a roadway called Leader Lane was renamed from Berczy Lane. There is also Berczy Street in Aurora running next to the train station. Berczy Park is a small park located behind the Gooderham Building at Front Street and Wellington Street in Toronto, Ontario. The park had been vacant for many decades and once used as a parking lot after the buildings on the site were demolished. A tree-lined city park emerged after the late 1980s and has undergone renovations from 2015 to 2016. Berczy Street Park and Berczy Street are found in Barrie, Ontario. Berczy- Strasse is a street named for him in Wallerstein, Bavaria. In 2016, Berczy was named a National Historic Person. =In fiction= Berczy is the subject of John Steffler's biographical novel German Mills: A Novel Pertaining to the Life and Times of William Berczy (Gaspereau Press, 2015).

Pictured here is a cross-section showing the gross anatomy of the human brain Neuroanatomy is the study of the structure and organization of the nervous system. In contrast to animals with radial symmetry, whose nervous system consists of a distributed network of cells, animals with bilateral symmetry have segregated, defined nervous systems. Their neuroanatomy is therefore better understood. In vertebrates, the nervous system is segregated into the internal structure of the brain and spinal cord (together called the central nervous system, or CNS) and the routes of the nerves that connect to the rest of the body (known as the peripheral nervous system, or PNS). The delineation of distinct structures and regions of the nervous system has been critical in investigating how it works. For example, much of what neuroscientists have learned comes from observing how damage or \\"lesions\\" to specific brain areas affects behavior or other neural functions. For information about the composition of non-human animal nervous systems, see nervous system. For information about the typical structure of the Homo sapiens nervous system, see human brain or peripheral nervous system. This article discusses information pertinent to the study of neuroanatomy.  History  J. M. Bourgery's anatomy of the brain, brainstem, and upper spinal column The first known written record of a study of the anatomy of the human brain is an ancient Egyptian document, the Edwin Smith Papyrus. The next major development in neuroanatomy came from the Greek Alcmaeon, who determined that the brain and not the heart ruled the body, and that the senses were dependent on the brain. After Alcmaeon‚Äôs findings, many scientists, philosophers, and physicians from around the world continued to contribute to the understanding of neuroanatomy, notably: Galen, Herophilus, Rhazes and Erasistratus. Herophilus and Erasistratus of Alexandria were perhaps the most influential Greek neuroscientists with their studies involving dissecting brains. For several hundred years afterward, with the cultural taboo of dissection, no major progress occurred in neuroscience. However, Pope Sixtus IV effectively revitalized the study of neuroanatomy by altering the papal policy and allowing human dissection. This resulted in a boom of research in neuroanatomy by artists and scientists of the Renaissance. In 1664, Thomas Willis, a physician and professor at Oxford University, coined the term neurology when he published his text Cerebri anatome which is considered the foundation of neuroanatomy. The subsequent three hundred and fifty some years has produced a great deal of documentation and study of the neural system.  Composition  At the tissue level, the nervous system is composed of neurons, glial cells, and extracellular matrix. Both neurons and glial cells come in many types (see, for example, the nervous system section of the list of distinct cell types in the adult human body). Neurons are the information-processing cells of the nervous system: they sense our environment, communicate with each other via electrical signals and chemicals called neurotransmitters which generally act across synapses (close contacts between two neurons, or between a neuron and a muscle cell; note also extrasynaptic effects are possible, as well as release of neurotransmitters into the neural extracellular space), and produce our memories, thoughts, and movements. Glial cells maintain homeostasis, produce myelin (oligodendrocytes), and provide support and protection for the brain's neurons. Some glial cells (astrocytes) can even propagate intercellular calcium waves over long distances in response to stimulation, and release gliotransmitters in response to changes in calcium concentration. Wound scars in the brain largely contain astrocytes. The extracellular matrix also provides support on the molecular level for the brain's cells, vehiculating substances to and from the blood vessels. At the organ level, the nervous system is composed of brain regions, such as the hippocampus in mammals or the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly.Mushroom Bodies of the Fruit Fly These regions are often modular and serve a particular role within the general systemic pathways of the nervous system. For example, the hippocampus is critical for forming memories in connection with many other cerebral regions. The peripheral nervous system also contains afferent or efferent nerves, which are bundles of fibers that originate from the brain and spinal cord, or from sensory or motor sorts of peripheral ganglia, and branch repeatedly to innervate every part of the body. Nerves are made primarily of the axons or dendrites of neurons (axons in case of efferent motor fibres, and dendrites in case of afferent sensory fibres of the nerves), along with a variety of membranes that wrap around and segregate them into nerve fascicles. The vertebrate nervous system is divided into the central and peripheral nervous systems. The central nervous system (CNS) consists of the brain, retina, and spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is made up of all the nerves and ganglia (packets of peripheral neurons) outside of the CNS that connect it to the rest of the body. The PNS is further subdivided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The somatic nervous system is made up of \\"afferent\\" neurons, which bring sensory information from the somatic (body) sense organs to the CNS, and \\"efferent\\" neurons, which carry motor instructions out to the voluntary muscles of the body. The autonomic nervous system can work with or without the control of the CNS (that's why it's called 'autonomous'), and also has two subdivisions, called sympathetic and parasympathetic, which are important for transmitting motor orders to the body's basic internal organs, thus controlling functions such as heartbeat, breathing, digestion, and salivation. Autonomic nerves, unlike somatic nerves, contain only efferent fibers. Sensory signals coming from the viscera course into the CNS through the somatic sensory nerves (e.g., visceral pain), or through some particular cranial nerves (e.g., chemosensitive or mechanic signals). = Orientation in neuroanatomy = Para-sagittal MRI of the head in a patient with benign familial macrocephaly. In anatomy in general and neuroanatomy in particular, several sets of topographic terms are used to denote orientation and location, which are generally referred to the body or brain axis (see Anatomical terms of location). The axis of the CNS is often wrongly assumed to be more or less straight, but it actually shows always two ventral flexures (cervical and cephalic flexures) and a dorsal flexure (pontine flexure), all due to differential growth during embryogenesis. The pairs of terms used most commonly in neuroanatomy are: * Dorsal and ventral: dorsal loosely refers to the top or upper side, represented by the roof plate of the brain, and ventral to the bottom or lower side, represented by the floor plate. These descriptors originally were used for dorsum and ventrum ‚Äì back and belly ‚Äì of the body; the belly of most animals is oriented towards the ground; the erect posture of humans places our ventral aspect anteriorly, and the dorsal aspect becomes posterior. The case of the head and the brain is peculiar, since the belly does not properly extend into the head, unless we assume that the mouth represents an extended belly element. Therefore, in common use, those brain parts that lie close to the base of the cranium, and through it to the mouth cavity, are called ventral ‚Äì i.e., at its bottom or lower side, as defined above ‚Äì whereas dorsal parts are closer to the enclosing cranial vault. Reference to the roof and floor plates of the brain is less prone to confusion, also allow us to keep an eye on the axial flexures mentioned above. Dorsal and ventral are thus relative terms in the brain, whose exact meaning depends on the specific location. * Rostral and caudal: rostral refers in general anatomy to the front of the body (towards the nose, or rostrum in Latin), and caudal refers to the tail end of the body (towards the tail; cauda in Latin). The rostrocaudal dimension of the brain corresponds to its length axis, which runs across the cited flexures from the caudal tip of the spinal cord into a rostral end roughly at the optic chiasma. In the erect Man, the directional terms \\"superior\\" and \\"inferior\\" essentially refer to this rostrocaudal dimension, because our body and brain axes are roughly oriented vertically in the erect position. However, all vertebrates develop a very marked ventral kink in the neural tube that is still detectable in the adult central nervous system, known as the cephalic flexure. The latter bends the rostral part of the CNS at a 180-degree angle relative to the caudal part, at the transition between the forebrain (axis ending rostrally at the optic chiasma) and the brainstem and spinal cord (axis roughly vertical, but including additional minor kinks at the pontine and cervical flexures) These flexural changes in axial dimension are problematic when trying to describe relative position and sectioning planes in the brain. There is abundant literature that wrongly disregards the axial flexures and assumes a relatively straight brain axis. * Medial and lateral: medial refers to being close, or relatively closer, to the midline (the descriptor median means a position precisely at the midline). Lateral is the opposite (a position more or less separated away from the midline). Note that such descriptors (dorsal/ventral, rostral/caudal; medial/lateral) are relative rather than absolute (e.g., a lateral structure may be said to lie medial to something else that lies even more laterally). Commonly used terms for planes of orientation or planes of section in neuroanatomy are \\"sagittal\\", \\"transverse\\" or \\"coronal\\", and \\"axial\\" or \\"horizontal\\". Again in this case, the situation is different for swimming, creeping or quadrupedal (prone) animals than for Man, or other erect species, due to the changed position of the axis. Due to the axial brain flexures, no section plane ever achieves a complete section series in a selected plane, because some sections inevitably result cut oblique or even perpendicular to it, as they pass through the flexures. Experience allows to discern the portions that result cut as desired. * A mid-sagittal plane divides the body and brain into left and right halves; sagittal sections, in general, are parallel to this median plane, moving along the medial-lateral dimension (see the image above). The term sagittal refers etymologically to the median suture between the right and left parietal bones of the cranium, known classically as sagittal suture, because it looks roughly like an arrow by its confluence with other sutures (sagitta; arrow in Latin). * A section plane orthogonal to the axis of any elongated form in principle is held to be transverse (e.g., a transverse section of a finger or of the vertebral column); if there is no length axis, there is no way to define such sections, or there are infinite possibilities). Therefore, transverse body sections in vertebrates are parallel to the ribs, which are orthogonal to the vertebral column, which represents the body axis both in animals and man. The brain also has an intrinsic longitudinal axis ‚Äì that of the primordial elongated neural tube ‚Äì which becomes largely vertical with the erect posture of Man, similarly as the body axis, except at its rostral end, as commented above. This explains that transverse spinal cord sections are roughly parallel to our ribs, or to the ground. However, this is only true for the spinal cord and the brainstem, since the forebrain end of the neural axis bends crook-like during early morphogenesis into the chiasmatic hypothalamus, where it ends; the orientation of true transverse sections accordingly changes, and is no longer parallel to the ribs and ground, but perpendicular to them; lack of awareness of this morphologic brain peculiarity (present in all vertebrate brains without exceptions) has caused and still causes much erroneous thinking on forebrain brain parts. Acknowledging the singularity of rostral transverse sections, tradition has introduced a different descriptor for them, namely coronal sections. Coronal sections divide the forebrain from rostral (front) to caudal (back), forming a series orthogonal (transverse) to the local bent axis. The concept cannot be applied meaningfully to the brainstem and spinal cord, since there the coronal sections become horizontal to the axial dimension, being parallel to the axis. In any case, the concept of 'coronal' sections is less precise than that of 'transverse', since often coronal section planes are used which are not truly orthogonal to the rostral end of the brain axis. The term is etymologically related to the coronal suture of the craneum and this to the position where crowns are worn (Latin corona means crown). It is not clear what sort of crown was meant originally (maybe just a diadema), and this leads unfortunately to ambiguity in the section plane defined merely as coronal. * A coronal plane across the human head and brain is modernly conceived to be parallel to the face (the plane in which a king's crown sits on his head is not exactly parallel to the face, and exportation of the concept to less frontally endowed animals than us is obviously even more conflictive, but there is an implicit reference to the coronal suture of the cranium, which forms between the frontal and temporal/parietal bones, giving a sort of diadema configuration which is roughly parallel to the face). Coronal section planes thus essentially refer only to the head and brain, where a diadema makes sense, and not to the neck and body below. * Horizontal sections by definition are aligned (parallel) with the horizon. In swimming, creeping and quadrupedal animals the body axis itself is horizontal, and, thus, horizontal sections run along the length of the spinal cord, separating ventral from dorsal parts. Horizontal sections are orthogonal to both transverse and sagittal sections, and in theory, are parallel to the length axis. Due to the axial bend in the brain (forebrain), true horizontal sections in that region are orthogonal to coronal (transverse) sections (as is the horizon relative to the face). According to these considerations, the three directions of space are represented precisely by the sagittal, transverse and horizontal planes, whereas coronal sections can be transverse, oblique or horizontal, depending on how they relate to the brain axis and its incurvations.  Tools  Modern developments in neuroanatomy are directly correlated to the technologies used to perform research. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss the various tools that are available. Many of the histological techniques used to study other tissues can be applied to the nervous system as well. However, there are some techniques that have been developed especially for the study of neuroanatomy. = Cell staining = In biological systems, staining is a technique used to enhance the contrast of particular features in microscopic images. Nissl staining uses aniline basic dyes to intensely stain the acidic polyribosomes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, which is abundant in neurons. This allows researchers to distinguish between different cell types (such as neurons and glia), and neuronal shapes and sizes, in various regions of the nervous system cytoarchitecture. The classic Golgi stain uses potassium dichromate and silver nitrate to fill selectively with a silver chromate precipitate a few neural cells (neurons or glia, but in principle, any cells can react similarly). This so-called silver chromate impregnation procedure stains entirely or partially the cell bodies and neurites of some neurons -dendrites, axon- in brown and black, allowing researchers to trace their paths up to their thinnest terminal branches in a slice of nervous tissue, thanks to the transparency consequent to the lack of staining in the majority of surrounding cells. Modernly, Golgi- impregnated material has been adapted for electron-microscopic visualization of the unstained elements surrounding the stained processes and cell bodies, thus adding further resolutive power. = Histochemistry = Histochemistry uses knowledge about biochemical reaction properties of the chemical constituents of the brain (including notably enzymes) to apply selective methods of reaction to visualize where they occur in the brain and any functional or pathological changes. This applies importantly to molecules related to neurotransmitter production and metabolism, but applies likewise in many other directions chemoarchitecture, or chemical neuroanatomy. Immunocytochemistry is a special case of histochemistry that uses selective antibodies against a variety of chemical epitopes of the nervous system to selectively stain particular cell types, axonal fascicles, neuropiles, glial processes or blood vessels, or specific intracytoplasmic or intranuclear proteins and other immunogenetic molecules, e.g., neurotransmitters. Immunoreacted transcription factor proteins reveal genomic readout in terms of translated protein. This immensely increases the capacity of researchers to distinguish between different cell types (such as neurons and glia) in various regions of the nervous system. In situ hybridization uses synthetic RNA probes that attach (hybridize) selectively to complementary mRNA transcripts of DNA exons in the cytoplasm, to visualize genomic readout, that is, distinguish active gene expression, in terms of mRNA rather than protein. This allows identification histologically (in situ) of the cells involved in the production of genetically-coded molecules, which often represent differentiation or functional traits, as well as the molecular boundaries separating distinct brain domains or cell populations. = Genetically encoded markers = By expressing variable amounts of red, green, and blue fluorescent proteins in the brain, the so-called \\"brainbow\\" mutant mouse allows the combinatorial visualization of many different colors in neurons. This tags neurons with enough unique colors that they can often be distinguished from their neighbors with fluorescence microscopy, enabling researchers to map the local connections or mutual arrangement (tiling) between neurons. Optogenetics uses transgenic constitutive and site-specific expression (normally in mice) of blocked markers that can be activated selectively by illumination with a light beam. This allows researchers to study axonal connectivity in the nervous system in a very discriminative way. = Non-invasive brain imaging = Magnetic resonance imaging has been used extensively to investigate brain structure and function non-invasively in healthy human subjects. An important example is diffusion tensor imaging, which relies on the restricted diffusion of water in tissue in order to produce axon images. In particular, water moves more quickly along the direction aligned with the axons, permitting the inference of their structure. = Viral-based methods = Certain viruses can replicate in brain cells and cross synapses. So, viruses modified to express markers (such as fluorescent proteins) can be used to trace connectivity between brain regions across multiple synapses. Two tracer viruses which replicate and spread transneuronal/transsynaptic are the Herpes simplex virus type1 (HSV) and the Rhabdoviruses. Herpes simplex virus was used to trace the connections between the brain and the stomach, in order to examine the brain areas involved in viscero-sensory processing. Another study injected herpes simplex virus into the eye, thus allowing the visualization of the optical pathway from the retina into the visual system. An example of a tracer virus which replicates from the synapse to the soma is the pseudorabies virus. By using pseudorabies viruses with different fluorescent reporters, dual infection models can parse complex synaptic architecture. = Dye-based methods = Axonal transport methods use a variety of dyes (horseradish peroxidase variants, fluorescent or radioactive markers, lectins, dextrans) that are more or less avidly absorbed by neurons or their processes. These molecules are selectively transported anterogradely (from soma to axon terminals) or retrogradely (from axon terminals to soma), thus providing evidence of primary and collateral connections in the brain. These 'physiologic' methods (because properties of living, unlesioned cells are used) can be combined with other procedures, and have essentially superseded the earlier procedures studying degeneration of lesioned neurons or axons. Detailed synaptic connections can be determined by correlative electron microscopy. = Connectomics = Serial section electron microscopy has been extensively developed for use in studying nervous systems. For example, the first application of serial block-face scanning electron microscopy was on rodent cortical tissue. Circuit reconstruction from data produced by this high-throughput method is challenging, and the Citizen science game EyeWire has been developed to aid research in that area. = Computational neuroanatomy = Is a field that utilizes various imaging modalities and computational techniques to model and quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuroanatomical structures in both normal and clinical populations.  Model systems  Aside from the human brain, there are many other animals whose brains and nervous systems have received extensive study as model systems, including mice, zebrafish, fruit fly, and a species of roundworm called C. elegans. Each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages as a model system. For example, the C. elegans nervous system is extremely stereotyped from one individual worm to the next. This has allowed researchers using electron microscopy to map the paths and connections of all of the approximately 300 neurons in this species. The fruit fly is widely studied in part because its genetics is very well understood and easily manipulated. The mouse is used because, as a mammal, its brain is more similar in structure to our own (e.g., it has a six-layered cortex, yet its genes can be easily modified and its reproductive cycle is relatively fast). = Caenorhabditis elegans = Nervous system of a generic bilaterian animal, in the form of a nerve cord with segmental enlargements, and a \\"brain\\" at the front The brain is small and simple in some species, such as the nematode worm, where the body plan is quite simple: a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from the mouth to the anus, and a nerve cord with an enlargement (a ganglion) for each body segment, with an especially large ganglion at the front, called the brain. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been studied because of its importance in genetics. In the early 1970s, Sydney Brenner chose it as a model system for studying the way that genes control development, including neuronal development. One advantage of working with this worm is that the nervous system of the hermaphrodite contains exactly 302 neurons, always in the same places, making identical synaptic connections in every worm. Brenner's team sliced worms into thousands of ultrathin sections and photographed every section under an electron microscope, then visually matched fibers from section to section, to map out every neuron and synapse in the entire body, to give a complete connectome of the nematode. Nothing approaching this level of detail is available for any other organism, and the information has been used to enable a multitude of studies that would not have been possible without it. = Drosophila melanogaster = Drosophila melanogaster is a popular experimental animal because it is easily cultured en masse from the wild, has a short generation time, and mutant animals are readily obtainable. Arthropods have a central brain with three divisions and large optical lobes behind each eye for visual processing. The brain of a fruit fly contains several million synapses, compared to at least 100 billion in the human brain. Approximately two-thirds of the Drosophila brain is dedicated to visual processing. Thomas Hunt Morgan started to work with Drosophila in 1906, and this work earned him the 1933 Nobel Prize in Medicine for identifying chromosomes as the vector of inheritance for genes. Because of the large array of tools available for studying Drosophila genetics, they have been a natural subject for studying the role of genes in the nervous system. The genome has been sequenced and published in 2000. About 75% of known human disease genes have a recognizable match in the genome of fruit flies. Drosophila is being used as a genetic model for several human neurological diseases including the neurodegenerative disorders Parkinson's, Huntington's, spinocerebellar ataxia and Alzheimer's disease. In spite of the large evolutionary distance between insects and mammals, many basic aspects of Drosophila neurogenetics have turned out to be relevant to humans. For instance, the first biological clock genes were identified by examining Drosophila mutants that showed disrupted daily activity cycles.

It was founded in 1949 as the merger of two major actuarial organizations in the United States: the Actuarial Society of America and the American Institute of Actuaries.SOA ‚Äì Society of Actuaries ‚Äì Historical Background It is a full member organization of the International Actuarial Association.About ‚Äì Members_Full (En) Through education and research, the SOA advances actuaries as leaders in measuring and managing risk to improve financial outcomes for individuals, organizations, and the public. The SOA‚Äôs vision is for actuaries to be highly sought-after professionals who develop and communicate solutions for complex financial issues. The SOA provides primary and continuing education for students and practicing actuaries, maintains high professional standards for actuaries, and conducts research on actuarial trends and public policy issues. A global organization, the SOA represents actuaries from all major areas of practice, including life and health insurance, retirement and pensions, investment and finance, enterprise risk management, and general insurance (property and casualty) insurance. The Casualty Actuarial Society also represents actuaries working with property and casualty. The SOA, along with its public relations firm Golin, won the PR Week Corporate Branding Campaign of the Year award for 2008. The award was given for the SOA's efforts to revitalize the actuarial profession's brand in the U.S., including the slogan \\"Risk is Opportunity.\\"\\"Corporate Branding Campaign of the Year 2008,\\" PR Week, March 06, 2008 History The Society was founded as a merger of two major American actuarial associations, as reflected in its logo: the Actuarial Society of America (ASA) and the American Institute of Actuaries (AIA). Shot of an old diploma issued by the AIA. The Actuarial Society of America was the first actuarial professional association in North America, founded in 1889 with only 38 members and headquartered in New York City. Initial members were included by invitation, but the organization soon adopted a system of examination for qualification, with the first Fellow to qualify via exams joining in 1900. The American Institute of Actuaries was founded in 1909. Based in Chicago, it attracted members from life insurance companies in the midwestern and southern United States. The formation of the AIA, which (like the ASA) was geared toward actuaries in the field of life insurance, was followed within the decade by the creation of two other specialized actuarial organizations: the Casualty Actuarial Society, which still exists today, and the Fraternal Actuarial Association which dissolved in 1980. Between the two organizations, which came to have some overlap in membership, the number of recognized professional actuaries climbed from the initial 38 to over 1000 by the time the two organizations merged in 1949 to form the SOA. The SOA has seen continued growth since then, now recognizing over 30,000 professional actuaries as active members. Leadership structure The SOA is headed by a board of directors, consisting of a president, president-elect, and eighteen other board members.SOA Bylaws In addition, the two most recent past presidents are members of the board. The board positions are filled by election. A member of the society is eligible to vote in board elections if they have the title of FSA, or if they have held the title of ASA for at least 5 years, and only FSAs can be elected to the board. (See the Membership section below for information on the professional titles granted by the society.) Regular board members are elected for terms of three years. The president-elect is elected for a term of one year, after which he or she becomes the president for a term of one year. The employees of the SOA are headed by the executive director, a salaried position appointed by the board of directors. =SOA Elections= The SOA holds its elections annually in late summer or early fall for its board of directors and the Section Councils. In the board of directors election, one president-elect, and six elected board members are elected each year. Elected board members serve three‚Äìyear terms. The president‚Äìelect serves three one‚Äìyear terms as president‚Äìelect, president and past president. In section elections, generally one third of the council is elected each year as members serve three‚Äìyear terms. Section councils select their officers (chair, vice chair, and secretary/treasurer). According to the SOA Bylaws, fellows and associates who have been members of the society for 5 years or more are entitled to vote in the board of directors' election. According to the Section Bylaws, all members of a Section are entitled to vote in the Section Council election. This includes ASAs, FSAs, and members of co‚Äìsponsoring organizations who are also members of a Section. SOA members with valid e‚Äìmail addresses in the SOA database are sent login credentials to vote online. Members without valid email addresses, or who notify the SOA of their request, receive paper ballots. Membership The society's members are involved in the life, health, pension and general insurance areas of the actuarial profession. There are three designations offered by the SOA. The two Associate-level designations are Associate of Society of Actuaries (ASA) and Chartered Enterprise Risk Analyst (CERA), which was introduced in 2007. The highest designation is Fellow of the Society of Actuaries (FSA). The SOA has more than 30,000 actuaries as members. Requirements for membership for the SOA include the actuarial exams, a comprehensive series of competitive exams. Topics covered in the exams include mathematics, finance, insurance, economics, interest theory, life models, and actuarial science. Non-members working in the actuarial profession and taking exams are often referred to as actuarial students or candidates. Members of the SOA who meet a professional experience requirement are eligible for membership in the American Academy of Actuaries, which represents United States actuaries from all practice areas. =Examination system= Professional designations in the Society are earned by completing a rigorous system of examinations. It is common for actuarial students to work full-time in the profession while studying for the exams. The first seven (\\"preliminary\\") exams consist mostly of core mathematics related to actuarial science including probability, statistics, interest theory, life contingencies, and risk models. In 2016, the SOA announced changes to the curriculum for candidates seeking the associate designation and the Chartered Enterprise Risk Analyst credential. In total, the number of components for Associateship from the SOA will increase from ten to twelve components, with three VEE subjects, seven formally examined subjects. These changes are in effect July 2018 and reflect an emphasis on predictive analytics, and also provides a curriculum balance between long-term and short-term insurance coverages. A series of online learning modules, called the Fundamentals of Actuarial Practice (FAP), are intended to be taken after the preliminary exams. They cover real-world topics such as insurance and professionalism with readings, case studies and projects. The preliminary exams and FAP modules comprise the majority of the education requirement for the ASA designation. Upper-level exam topics for the FSA designation include plan design, risk classification, enterprise risk management, ratemaking and valuation. Three fellowship exams are taken in one of six specialization tracks chosen by the candidate ‚Äì Finance & Enterprise Risk Management, Investments, Individual Life Insurance & Annuities, Retirement Benefits, Group & Health Insurance, or General Insurance. The SOA is updating the Fellowship tracks beginning in late 2018. Candidates completing the Finance & Enterprise Risk Management track will also earn the CERA designation. Candidates in any of the other five tracks have the option of replacing their track-specific Enterprise Risk Management exam with a more generalized ERM exam in order to obtain the CERA designation in addition to FSA.

Education Born in Melbourne, Australia, Chapman's family moved to Sydney while he was a child. After attending the Fort Street Opportunity School (which Douglas Mawson also attended), Chapman attended Parramatta High School. He went on to earn a B.S. in physics and mathematics from the University of Sydney, in 1956. He then attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, earning a M.S. in aeronautics and astronautics in 1964 and a Sc.D. in instrumentation in 1967. His doctoral thesis advisors included Nobel Laureates Steven Weinberg and Rainer Weiss.Astronaut Biographies, NASA Astronaut Office Work Chapman served with the Royal Australian Air Force Reserve from 1953 to 1955. He learned to fly (in a Tiger Moth) during Australian National Service. From 1956 to 1957, he worked for Philips Electronics Industries Proprietary Limited in Sydney, Australia. He then spent 15 months in Mawson Station, Antarctica with the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE), for the International Geophysical Year (IGY), 1958, as an auroral/radio physicist. The work required that he spend most of the winter at a remote, 2-man base, near the world's largest Emperor penguin rookery, near Taylor Glacier. From 1960 to 1961, he was an electro-optics staff engineer in flight simulators for Canadian Aviation Electronics Limited in Dorval, Quebec. His next assignment was as a staff physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he worked in electro-optics, inertial systems (at the Experimental Astronomy Lab, under the direction of Charles Stark \\"Doc\\" Draper), and gravitational theory with Rainer Weiss until the summer of 1967. After gaining U.S. citizenship, Chapman was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in August 1967. He trained as an astronaut, including jet pilot training with the USAF and the US Navy Underwater School, and served as the Apollo 14 Mission Scientist. He resigned from the program near the close of the Apollo Program in July 1972, largely because he strongly disagreed with the decision to build the Space Shuttle. Publicly, he said, \\"It appears that we have to make a choice between losing our competency as pilots or losing our competency as scientists.\\" After spending the next five years working on laser propulsion at Avco Everett Research Laboratory as the special assistant to Arthur Kantrowitz, he moved to Arthur D. Little to work with Peter Glaser, the inventor of the solar power satellite (SPS). Chapman was actively involved in the NASA/DOE SPS Concept Development and Evaluation Program (CDEP) in the late 1970s and early 1980s and has since continued to make contributions to the literature on power from space. In the mid-1980s, Chapman shifted his focus to commercial space‚Äîbuilding private companies that develop products and services for space-based, as well as Earth-oriented businesses. He served as president of the L5 Society (now the National Space Society) during the successful campaign to stop the US Senate from ratifying the Moon Treaty, which would have excluded any commercial activity on the Moon. Chapman is a member of the Citizens' Advisory Council on National Space Policy, which has advised several US Presidents on space-related issues. In particular, a position paper by the council was instrumental in convincing Ronald Reagan that it was technically feasible to intercept ballistic missiles in flight. Opponents thought the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was a fantasy, dubbing it \\"Star Wars\\". In 1989, Chapman led a privately funded scientific expedition by sea from Cape Town, South Africa to Enderby Land, Antarctica, to gather information about mineral resources before the Madrid Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty made prospecting illegal on the continent. From 1989‚Äì1994, Chapman was the president of Echo Canyon Software in Boston which produced the first visual programming environment for Windows, before Microsoft introduced Visual Basic. In 1998, Chapman was Chief Scientist of Rotary Rocket of San Mateo, California. Rotary Rocket built and flew atmospheric tests of the Roton, a novel manned, re-usable space launch vehicle. In 2004, Chapman presented two papers at the 55th International Astronautical Congress (Vancouver CANADA). The first, \\"Luces in the Sky with Diamonds,\\" presented a design for a gossamer, iso-inertial SPS using thin films of artificial diamond in thermionic conversion devices. The second paper, \\"Power from Space and the Hydrogen Economy,\\" discussed the implications of the recent discovery of vast deposits of methane hydrates under Arctic permafrost and on continental shelves, which may be sufficient to meet all world energy needs for many thousands of years. See the web address below for full text of this paper. Chapman was Chief Scientist of Transformational Space Corporation, \\"t/Space\\" of Reston, VA. Under a $6 million contract from NASA, t/Space has developed a plan and re-usable vehicle to support the International Space Station (ISS), after the shuttles retire in 2010. The Roton is a manned spacecraft that is owned and operated by private enterprise. NASA has now adopted commercial support as its baseline plan for the ISS. In 2009, Chapman formed the Solar High Study Group, \\"a team of senior managers and technologists with directly relevant experience who believe that space-based solar power can solve the problem of bringing clean, affordable energy to people anywhere on Earth or in space.\\" In July 2010, Chapman presented slides to the US Air Force on the topic of Tactical and Strategic Implications of Space Based Solar Power (SBSP). Main conclusions include the US is able to deploy SBSP within 7 years with technologies now at Technology Readiness Level 6+ and that a study of national security implications of SBSP is urgently needed. Information from this event will contribute to a USAF policy paper on its energy strategy. Views on global warming On 23 April 2008, Chapman authored an op-ed in The Australian newspaper, noting a new ice age will eventually occur, that based on current low solar activity it might even be imminent, and \\"It is time to put aside the global warming dogma, at least to begin contingency planning about what to do if we are moving into another little ice age, similar to the one that lasted from 1100 to 1850.\\". A response by IPCC affiliated meteorologist David Karoly was published a few days later. Chapman wrote a blog that included 17 entries categorized as Global Warming. Those entries presented much data and commentary to support his point of view.

It was founded in 1965 and graduated its first class in 1968. Lynbrook is in the Fremont Union High School District along with Monta Vista High School, Cupertino High School, Fremont High School, and Homestead High School. It is fairly close to Miller Middle School. It is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. Several measures rank Lynbrook as one of the best high schools in the San Francisco Bay Area, California and the nation. In 2016, Newsweek ranked Lynbrook as the 29th best high school in the United States. Another report of public and private high schools by Business Insider and Niche ranked the students' average SAT/ACT scores as 7th nationwide. The Los Angeles Times ranked Lynbrook first among all public high schools in California using a similar metric. Separately, U.S. News & World Report ranked the school as the 17th best in the nation for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). A larger percentage of its graduates are accepted into the University of California (UC) system than at any other school in the Fremont Union High School District. History Lynbrook High School opened on September 13, 1965, with an enrollment of 1,026 freshmen and sophomores. Because Cupertino High School had grown very large by that time, a new school in the West San Jose area was constructed. The District Board nominated Kendall Stanger as the first principal of the school. The school was technologically advanced around the time it was built and had closed-circuit television and air conditioning. During the first year, there was no gymnasium, locker room, or swimming pool. By the second school year, the gymnasium, locker room, and an Olympic-size swimming pool were built. Campus Many of Lynbrook's buildings and facilities are in their original state and have not been significantly renovated, until 2019, where the quad and cafeteria was under construction for a year and finished renovations 2019. Construction continues in 2020 for the gym and main student parking lot. However, the bleachers in the main gym were replaced between 2003 and 2006. Most of Lynbrook's buildings are constructed of old red brick exteriors. New structures and facilities built since 1990 include the library, swimming pool, field house, and special education buildings. During the summer in 2009, the parking lot was renovated and solar panels were added. In the fall of 2012, the football field and track was renovated, including new lights. The library has also been redesigned. Lynbrook has a football field with a synthetic track around, a baseball field, and a field hockey/soccer field, also known as Stober field. Lynbrook's Olympic-sized swimming pool is in excellent condition. During water polo season, Lynbrook's nine-lane swimming pool devotes about half of its area to non-lane-divided deep-water areas. The deep-water area is used mainly for water polo competitions. The pool was renovated in the summer of 2009, and no longer has diving boards. The softball and field hockey areas were renovated in 2006-2007. A new building that houses the new weight room and dance studio was added west of the Field House during the 2017-2018 school year and opened for use in May 2018. This construction is the first of three stages of campus renovation. Stage two began in the summer of 2018 with the demolition of the quad, cafeteria, and old dance studio building. The new quad and cafeteria have since opened and when they have completed stage 3 of the renovation will begin with an added gym lobby, new main office, and a widespread re-arranging of building usage. The classroom wings are on the back (east) side of the school and are numbered from 101-615. The 100 and 200 wings are on the north side, and the 500 and 600 wings are on the south side. The gymnasium, swimming pool, and tennis and basketball courts are situated on the southwest side of Lynbrook's campus. The western third of the campus consists of the Stober field (a large green lawn used primarily for field hockey practice and student events) and a football field. The visual and performing arts center is the school's easternmost building. The school's mural of the Viking, which faces the main parking lot, is painted on the building that houses the girls' locker rooms and the weight training room. The quad is the hub of student life at Lynbrook and is surrounded by the cafeteria, classroom wings, auditorium, and the gym. School-wide homecoming skits were performed in the quad until it was demolished, during construction they take place on the blacktop near the tennis courts. Other student activities that took place in the old quad, including \\"Club Food Day\\" and homecoming skits, are also now held near the tennis courts. On Club Food Day, participating clubs set up tables and fundraise by selling food and drinks. Spirit Weeks, week-long events put on by the Associated Student Body (ASB), were also held in the quad. Spirit weeks culminate in a school-wide rally at the end of the week, located in the main gym. While the bleachers in the main gym were being replaced, rallies were held outdoors in the quad. Academics Lynbrook has widely been known for consistently being one of the top 20 academic high schools in California for several years. Lynbrook's academic reputation has also influenced the real estate market in the surrounding neighborhood, causing home prices to rise higher than other neighborhoods in the San Jose area. As of 2011, Lynbrook High School's base Academic Performance Index (API) is 943, which is 201 points higher than the state average for high schools, and is similar to those of Saratoga, Mission San Jose, and Monta Vista. The API ranking for Lynbrook High School is 19 out of 19, which is the best rating possible for any school, and its similar-schools API ranking is 9 out of 10. In 2008, Lynbrook was ranked 6th out of all public schools in the state of California, excluding magnet schools, based on API scores. In 2009, the U.S. News & World Report ranked Lynbrook as the 98th best high school in the United States. In 2007, the school scored a 10 out of 10 in both API Statewide and Similar School ranking. Lynbrook students consistently receive high marks on standardized exams, including the SAT and Advanced Placement Exams. A report of public and private high schools by Business Insider and Niche ranked the students' average SAT/ACT scores as 7th nationwide. The Los Angeles Times ranked Lynbrook first among all public high schools in California using a similar metric. On the SAT Reasoning Test, the mean critical reading score for the class of 2012 was 636/800, the mean writing score was 668/800, and the mean mathematics score was 696/800. The mean composite score on the SAT was a 2000/2400. Out of 1585 tests taken by 672 students who took Advanced Placement Exams in May 2012, 57% scored a 5, the highest score possible, and 94% of the people passed by scoring a 3 or higher. Lynbrook produced 62 National Merit semifinalists, and 93 commended students from the class of 2013, which is the highest proportion based on the size of the graduating class (431) out of all of the high schools in the Fremont Union High School District. Between 1999 and 2018, Lynbrook High School students won 37 semi-finalist and 7 finalist awards in the Regeneron Science Talent Search. This was among the highest number of award winners of all high schools in the country. 93% of Lynbrook students passed the English-portion of the CAHSEE and 95% passed the mathematics portion. Lynbrook has a relatively high proportion of high student GPA's, and the top 10 percent of students have a GPA from 3.97 to 4.00. More than half of all Lynbrook graduates attend the University of California, making Lynbrook one of the university's largest feeders. Not all students attend four-year colleges; about one-fourth attend two-year colleges such as nearby De Anza College before transferring to other institutions. In 2009‚Äì2010, Lynbrook had a total of 6 semifinalists, two finalists, and one 2nd-place student from the Intel Science Talent Search, one of the most prestigious science competitions in America. In 2010, Lynbrook had 8 qualifiers for the USAMO (USA Mathematical Olympiad) and 8 for the USAJMO (USA Junior Mathematical Olympiad), some of the most prestigious math competitions in the nation. In 2011, Lynbrook was recognized at a Gala Dinner in Washington DC as an Intel School of Distinction Winner in science. Lynbrook is one of only six schools (two elementary, two middle and two high schools, each for either math or science) in the nation to receive this recognition. Athletics and extracurriculars =Sports= Lynbrook is a member of the California Interscholastic Federation. Its most notable athletic activity is Track and Field, especially jumps. It offers a total of 16 distinct varsity and JV sports, with sports split into two different seasons for girls and boys (such as tennis and volleyball) counted as one sport.Lynbrook High School, San Jose, CA Lynbrook has confirmed employment of the controversial judge in the Brock Turner case, Mr. Michael Aaron Persky, as the high school's new coach of the Junior Varsity Girls Tennis Team. Persky was recalled as a judge by Santa Clara County voters in 2018 for his handling of the Turner case (the first judge to be recalled in California since 1932). The school made the following statement regarding Persky's employment: \\"Mr. Persky is in his first year as an athletic coach in our District. He applied for the open coaching position over the summer and successfully completed all of the District‚Äôs hiring requirements before starting as a coach, including a fingerprint background check. He was a highly qualified applicant, having attended several tennis coaching clinics for youth and holds a high rating from the United States Tennis Association.\\" =ASB= The Lynbrook ASB (Associated Student Body) organizes student activities and is led by both student and administrative members. The ASB organizes many class competitions, brunch and lunch time entertainment, rallies, and also homecoming skits and dances. Homecoming is the largest event on the school calendar. During homecoming, classes hold \\"skits\\" and compete against each other during homecoming week. ASB cards, issued by the ASB, allow students to receive discounted prices on school merchandise, tickets, and activities. As of the 2011-2012 school year, an ASB card can be purchased for $85, with the cost of the yearbook included. Lynbrook holds school dances throughout the year, usually on Friday nights. The dances begin at 7:30 p.m. and end at 10:30 p.m. School rules are in effect during the dances, and only Lynbrook students are allowed in the dances unless a guest pass is obtained. There are four to six spirit weeks held throughout the school year. During these themed weeks, the ASB puts on spirit games in the quad that involve students and teachers in ridiculous but entertaining games and competitions. Usually these games involve one or more students from each class. Lynbrook ASB is responsible for hosting teacher appreciation week, mental health stress-free weeks, and holiday themed spirit weeks. The ASB students also plan, write, and announce the daily update news announcements projected to the students every morning. Demographics Like most other American high schools, Lynbrook is a four-year high school that consists of freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior classes. As of the 2016-2017 school year, Lynbrook High School had a total of 1,741 students, with 449 students belonging to the senior class of 2014. 87% of students are Asian, 9% are White, 4% are \\"Other\\", and the remaining are English learners. Like many top high schools in the Bay Area , Lynbrook's student body is primarily Chinese American, with a growing Indian American population.http://www.schoolmatters.com/schools.aspx/q/page=sp/sid=84426 =School boundaries= Lynbrook High School's boundaries comprise the western part of West San Jose and parts of northern Saratoga. The school's area is bound to the north by Bollinger Road, to the east by Saratoga Creek, to the south by Cox Avenue, and to the west by De Anza Boulevard. Currently, the Residency Verification policy states that all students who are enrolled in Lynbrook High School must be physically residing within the district's boundaries. The Residency Verification Anonymous Hotline is one of the district's ways of helping to enforce the policy (see Fremont Union High School District). However, a small number of students live elsewhere but are allowed enrollment due to lottery enrollment or by exceptions from the district. Curriculum =Policies and grading= Lynbrook High School's most important policies are covered by the Fremont Union High School District's main policies, including the Zero Tolerance Policy, Academic Code of Conduct, and Residency Verification. They are all stated in the first few pages of the Student Planner. Assistant principals and the Student Legislative Council set minor policies and school rules. =AP and honors courses= Lynbrook offers a total of 17 different AP courses (counting AP Calculus AB and BC as two separate courses) and 8 different honors courses. ;Laboratory science :AP Biology :AP Chemistry :AP Physics C: Mechanics :Chemistry Honors :Physics Honors ;Mathematics :AP Calculus AB :AP Calculus BC :AP Statistics :Pre-Calculus Honors :AP Computer Science AB ;English language :AP English Language and Composition (11th grade) :AP English Literature and Composition (12th grade) ;Foreign language :AP Spanish (level 5) :AP French (level 5) :AP Japanese (not available school year 2007-2008, available in 2008-2009) (level 5) :AP Chinese (level 5) :Spanish 4 Honors :French 4 Honors :Japanese 4 Honors :Chinese 4 Honors ;Social studies :AP U.S. History (11th grade) :AP U.S. Government and Politics (12th grade) ;Visual and performing arts :Advanced Drama Honors =Graduation requirements= A minimum of 220 semester units are required for graduation from Lynbrook High School.

Physical education is a required course for freshmen and sophomores. Sophomores also have the opportunity to take PE Athletics (Team Sports), Racquet Sports, PE Basketball, Weight Training, or Weight Training(For athletes) instead of PE 10. School technology Lynbrook considers itself a technology-literate school which uses the Internet as the primary means of communication. Like some schools within the Fremont Union High School District, teachers, administrators, and students use the School Loop for announcements, discussions, assignments and schedules. The School Loop can also be used for posting e-mail addresses and files. Teachers use turnitin.com, mygradebook.com, and other such websites to post grades and collect and evaluate papers. The school library also has 36 public terminals for student use. Two computer labs in Rooms 005 and 006 are only for use by classes that have made appointments with the school, but students may access the computers during Monday and Thursday tutorial periods. Many classrooms have surround sound systems and/or Smartboards. A flex lab also provides teachers a new technology-rich learning space.

The darkened paper flap prevents the number from being read by holding the unopened envelope to the light. A personal identification number (PIN), or sometimes redundantly a PIN number, is a numeric or alpha-numeric passcode used in the process of authenticating a user accessing a system. The personal identification number has been the key to flourishing the exchange of private data between different data-processing centers in computer networks for financial institutions, governments, and enterprises. PINs may be used to authenticate banking systems with cardholders, governments with citizens, enterprises with employees, and computers with users, among other uses. In common usage, PINs are used in ATM or POS transactions, secure access control (e.g. computer access, door access, car access), internet transactions or to log into a restricted website. History The PIN originated with the introduction of the automated teller machine (ATM) in 1967, as an efficient way for banks to dispense cash to their customers. The first ATM system was that of Barclays in London, in 1967; it accepted cheques with machine-readable encoding, rather than cards, and matched the PIN to the cheque.Jarunee Wonglimpiyara, Strategies of Competition in the Bank Card Business (2005), p. 1-3. 1972, Lloyds Bank issued the first bank card to feature an information- encoding magnetic strip, using a PIN for security.Jarunee Wonglimpiyara, Strategies of Competition in the Bank Card Business (2005), p. 5. James Goodfellow, the inventor who patented the first personal identification number, was awarded an OBE in the 2006 Queen's Birthday Honours. Mohamed M. Atalla invented the first PIN-based hardware security module (HSM), dubbed the \\"Atalla Box\\", a security system which encrypted PIN and ATM messages, and protected offline devices with an un-guessable PIN-generating key. In 1972, Atalla filed for his PIN verification system, which included an encoded card reader and described a system that utilized encryption techniques to assure telephone link security while entering personal ID information that was transmitted to a remote location for verification. He founded Atalla Corporation (now Utimaco Atalla) in 1972, and commercially launched the \\"Atalla Box\\" in 1973,. The product was released as the Identikey. It was a card reader and customer identification system, providing a terminal with plastic card and PIN capabilities. The system was designed to let banks and thrift institutions switch to a plastic card environment from a passbook program. The Identikey system consisted of a card reader console, two customer PIN pads, intelligent controller and built-in electronic interface package. The device consisted of two keypads, one for the customer and one for the teller. It allowed the customer to type in a secret code, which is transformed by the device, using a microprocessor, into another code for the teller. During a transaction, the customer's account number was read by the card reader. This process replaced manual entry and avoided possible key stroke errors. It allowed users to replace traditional customer verification methods such as signature verification and test questions with a secure PIN system. In recognition of his work on the PIN system of information security management, Atalla has been referred to as the \\"Father of the PIN\\". The success of the \\"Atalla Box\\" led to the wide adoption of PIN-based hardware security modules. Its PIN verification process was similar to the later IBM 3624. By 1998 an estimated 70% of all ATM transactions in the United States were routed through specialized Atalla hardware modules, and by 2003 the Atalla Box secured 80% of all ATM machines in the world, increasing to 85% as of 2006. Atalla's HSM products protect 250million card transactions every day as of 2013, and still secure the majority of the world's ATM transactions as of 2014. Financial services = PIN usage= In the context of a financial transaction, usually both a private \\"PIN code\\" and public user identifier is required to authenticate a user to the system. In these situations, typically the user is required to provide a non-confidential user identifier or token (the user ID) and a confidential PIN to gain access to the system. Upon receiving the user ID and PIN, the system looks up the PIN based upon the user ID and compares the looked-up PIN with the received PIN. The user is granted access only when the number entered matches with the number stored in the system. Hence, despite the name, a PIN does not personally identify the user.Your ID number is not a password, Webb-site.com, 8 November 2010 The PIN is not printed or embedded on the card but is manually entered by the cardholder during automated teller machine (ATM) and point of sale (POS) transactions (such as those that comply with EMV), and in card not present transactions, such as over the Internet or for phone banking. = PIN length= The international standard for financial services PIN management, ISO 9564-1, allows for PINs from four up to twelve digits, but recommends that for usability reasons the card issuer not assign a PIN longer than six digits.ISO 9564-1:2011 Financial services -- Personal Identification Number (PIN) management and security -- Part 1: Basic principles and requirements for PINs in card-based systems, clause 8.1 PIN length The inventor of the ATM, John Shepherd-Barron, had at first envisioned a six-digit numeric code, but his wife could only remember four digits, and that has become the most commonly used length in many places, although banks in Switzerland and many other countries require a six-digit PIN. = PIN validation = There are several main methods of validating PINs. The operations discussed below are usually performed within a hardware security module (HSM).  IBM 3624 method One of the earliest ATM models was the IBM 3624, which used the IBM method to generate what is termed a natural PIN. The natural PIN is generated by encrypting the primary account number (PAN), using an encryption key generated specifically for the purpose. This key is sometimes referred to as the PIN generation key (PGK). This PIN is directly related to the primary account number. To validate the PIN, the issuing bank regenerates the PIN using the above method, and compares this with the entered PIN. Natural PINs cannot be user selectable because they are derived from the PAN. If the card is reissued with a new PAN, a new PIN must be generated. Natural PINs allow banks to issue PIN reminder letters as the PIN can be generated.  IBM 3624 + offset method To allow user selectable PINs it is possible to store a PIN offset value. The offset is found by subtracting natural PIN from the customer selected PIN using modulo 10. For example, if the natural PIN is 1234, and the user wishes to have a PIN of 2345, the offset is 1111. The offset can be stored either on the card track data, or in a database at the card issuer. To validate the PIN, the issuing bank calculates the natural PIN as in the above method, then adds the offset and compares this value to the entered PIN.  VISA method  When using this credit card terminal, a VISA cardholder swipes or inserts their credit card, and enters their PIN on the keypad The VISA method is used by many card schemes and is not VISA-specific. The VISA method generates a PIN verification value (PVV). Similar to the offset value, it can be stored on the card's track data, or in a database at the card issuer. This is called the reference PVV. The VISA method takes the rightmost eleven digits of the PAN excluding the checksum value, a PIN validation key index (PVKI, chosen from one to six) and the required PIN value to make a 64 bit number, the PVKI selects a validation key (PVK, of 128 bits) to encrypt this number. From this encrypted value, the PVV is found. To validate the PIN, the issuing bank calculates a PVV value from the entered PIN and PAN and compares this value to the reference PVV. If the reference PVV and the calculated PVV match, the correct PIN was entered. Unlike the IBM method, the VISA method doesn't derive a PIN. The PVV value is used to confirm the PIN entered at the terminal, was also used to generate the reference PVV. The PIN used to generate a PVV can be randomly generated or user selected or even derived using the IBM method. PIN security Financial PINs are often four-digit numbers in the range 0000-9999, resulting in 10,000 possible combinations. Switzerland issues six-digit PINs by default. Some systems set up default PINs and most allow the customer to set up a PIN or to change the default one, and on some a change of PIN on first access is mandatory. Customers are usually advised not to set up a PIN based on their or their spouse's birthdays, on driver license numbers, consecutive or repetitive numbers, or some other schemes. Some financial institutions do not give out or permit PINs where all digits are identical (such as 1111, 2222, ...), consecutive (1234, 2345, ‚Ä¶), numbers that start with one or more zeroes, or the last four digits of the cardholder's social security number or birth date. Many PIN verification systems allow three attempts, thereby giving a card thief a putative 0.03% probability of guessing the correct PIN before the card is blocked. This holds only if all PINs are equally likely and the attacker has no further information available, which has not been the case with some of the many PIN generation and verification algorithms that financial institutions and ATM manufacturers have used in the past. Research has been done on commonly used PINs. The result is that without forethought, a sizable portion of users may find their PIN vulnerable. \\"Armed with only four possibilities, hackers can crack 20% of all PINs. Allow them no more than fifteen numbers, and they can tap the accounts of more than a quarter of card- holders.\\" Breakable PINs can worsen with length, to wit: =Implementation flaws= In 2002, two PhD students at Cambridge University, Piotr Zieli≈Ñski and Mike Bond, discovered a security flaw in the PIN generation system of the IBM 3624, which was duplicated in most later hardware. Known as the decimalization table attack, the flaw would allow someone who has access to a bank's computer system to determine the PIN for an ATM card in an average of 15 guesses. Reverse PIN hoax Rumours have been in e-mail circulation claiming that in the event of entering a PIN into an ATM backwards, police will be instantly alerted as well as money being ordinarily issued as if the PIN had been entered correctly. The intention of this scheme would be to protect victims of muggings; however, despite the system being proposed for use in some US states,Full Text of SB0562 Illinois General Assembly, accessed 2011-07-20sb379_SB_379_PF_2.html Senate Bill 379 Georgia General Assembly, published 2006, accessed 2011-07-20 there are no ATMs currently in existence that employ this software. Mobile phone passcodes A mobile phone may be PIN protected. If enabled, the PIN (also called a passcode) for GSM mobile phones can be between four and eight digits082251615790 GSM 02.17 Subscriber Identity Modules, Functional Characteristics, version 3.2.0, February 1992, clause 3.1.3 and is recorded in the SIM card. If such a PIN is entered incorrectly three times, the SIM card is blocked until a personal unblocking code (PUC or PUK), provided by the service operator, is entered. If the PUC is entered incorrectly ten times, the SIM card is permanently blocked, requiring a new SIM card from the mobile carrier service. PINs are also commonly used in smartphones, as a form of personal authentication, so that only those who know the PIN will be able to unlock the device. After a number of failed attempts of entering the correct PIN, the user may be blocked from trying again for an allocated amount of time, all of the data stored on the device may be deleted, or the user may be asked to enter alternate information that only the owner is expected to know to authenticate. Whether any of the former mentioned phenomenona occur after failed attempts of entering the PIN depends largely upon the device and the owner‚Äôs chosen preferences in its settings.

The series, animated by Toei Animation, consists of 52 half-hour episodes, which aired on TV Asahi in Japan from January 19, 1986 to January 11, 1987. The show focuses on the adventures of Patty Rabbit, Bobby Bear and their families, in a small utopian anthropomorphic city named Maple Town. The series was followed by a 50-episode sequel, New Maple Town Stories: Palm Town Chapter, which retained only Patty Rabbit (and her voice actor, Maya Okamoto) from both series, although Maple Town's citizens made cameos from time to time. To date, this has not had an official English release. The show was dubbed into English and syndicated in the United States in 1987. The program spawned collectable figurines with changeable clothing, as well as houses, furniture and vehicles. Tonka was the US licensee and manufacturer. VHS compilations of Maple Town appeared in North America, Europe and Japan during the late 1980s and early 1990s. As of 2013, official DVDs of the show had surfaced in Japan, Spain and Hungary, with no release plans announced for other territories. Plot summary Patty Hoperabbit, along with her family, arrives in Maple Town, a small town inhabited by friendly animals. However, in a train heist by the sly ‚Äì if usually \\"endearingly unsuccessful\\" ‚Äì thief, Wilde Wolf stole the mailbag from her father and escaped into the forest. Soon she followed after him to retrieve the mailbag. In the midst of getting the bag back from the thief, she befriends a boy of her age named Bobby Kumanoff who has the bag. After they escape from Wilde Wolf and outwit him, they deliver the mailbag safely to her father. Soon, the Rabbit Family settles in Maple Town as mail carriers and the bitter, yet sweet friendship of Patty and Bobby begins to blossom. At the same time they try to foil Wilde Wolf's plans. The series's setting is Canada around the 1920s, while the setting of Palm Town Chapter is based on the West Coast of the United States around the 1980s.

An English-dubbed version, airing in tandem with the toy promotion, starred actress Karen Hartman (credited as Janice Adams), known previously for her other children's TV role as Talkatoo Cockatoo on Zoobilee Zoo, as Mrs. Maple in its book-ending live-action segments. Mrs. Maple was the only human inhabitant of the title town in this version, and she offered each episode's moral lesson. The voice cast included Reba West as Patty Rabbit and Steve Kramer as Wilde Wolf. The English version of Maple Town was produced by Saban Entertainment and The Maltese Companies, the latter of which also produced Spiral Zone, another syndicated series with Tonka, and the 1988 animated feature Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw.

Sometimes confused with the Independent Baptist Fellowship International (IBFI), the IBFNA is a northern-oriented fellowship formed by individuals who left the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches (GARBC) due to what they felt was a drift of the association away from their original separatist position. The Fellowship was organized in October 1990 at Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Its constitution was ratified in 1993 at Providence, Rhode Island. It is composed of individuals rather than churches. Individuals must renew their membership annually; churches are recognized as 'supporting churches' by financially supporting the Fellowship. This body is very local church oriented, and all boards, institutions, and agencies remain in the hands of the churches. Articles of Faith have been adopted, containing statements on the Scriptures, the Triune God, Salvation, Sanctification, the Church, Biblical Separation, Civil Government, Creation, The Fall of Man, the Devil, and End times. The Review is a quarterly published by the IBFNA. A Conference is held annually. In 1994, the individual members of the Fellowship were from 106 different churches, 60 of which were not affiliated with other bodies and 46 were dually aligned with the IBFNA and the GARBC. The greatest strength of this group is in Pennsylvania. A few members are located in Canada.

A place of worship in Greater Vancouver, the cathedral is located at 690 Burrard Street on the north-east corner of West Georgia Street and Burrard Street, directly across from the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver.  History  Christ Church is a daughter church of St. James' Anglican Church. The first service was held, without a church building, on December 23, 1888, at 720 Granville Street. On February 14, 1889, a building committee was formed to collect the necessary funds for the erection of the church. It would be located on land bought from the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR); Henry John Cambie, chief engineer of CPR's Pacific Division and People's Warden of the new church, was a key negotiator in acquiring the property.Adams, Neal (1989). Living Stones. A Centennial History of Christ Church Cathedral, 1889-1989. Vancouver: Christ Church Cathedral. By October 1889, Christ Church's basement was built and on October 6, the opening service was held for 52 parishioners. The joy of a new church did not last forever. By 1891 the CPR objected to the unfinished building that had quickly been nicknamed the root house. It was viewed an \\"eyesore\\" and the parishioners feared they would lose their location due to lack of funds to complete the building. The architect Robert Mackay Fripp submitted a proposal for completion of the church, 1892. Robert Mackay Fripp A financing scheme was developed by a parishioner and the cornerstone was finally laid July 28, 1894, and the church dedicated on February 17, 1895. The church was built in the Gothic Style with ceiling made of cedar planking and ceiling beams and floor constructed out of old growth Douglas fir. By 1909 the first expansion was done and by 1911, the first organ had already worn out. It used a human blower hired at $5 per month and was replaced by a new organ manufactured by Wurlitzer. View of Christ Church Cathedral, c. 1920s In 1920, electricity replaced candles for lighting, and in 1930 the lanterns now in the church were installed. In 1929, the Archbishop of New Westminster constituted Christ Church as the Cathedral Church of the Diocese replacing Holy Trinity Cathedral located in the City of New Westminster. The church planned to build a bell tower, but in 1943, the city by-laws were changed to restrict church bells. In November 2016, a bell tower was inaugurated. Its four bells are rung daily at 8 am and 6 pm and before church services. In 1949, after many building alterations, the Casavant organ was installed. Constructed partially of war surplus parts and remnants of the Wurlitzer, the instrument served well but had a problematic history. In 1971, the church membership voted to demolish the building and replace it with a hi-rise tower complex designed by Arthur Erickson. The redevelopment was opposed by the public and in 1976 after much lobbying; the cathedral was named a Class A Heritage building in the municipality of Vancouver and the Province of British Columbia. In 1995, an eleven-year program of restoration and renewal was begun. Christ Church Cathedral is the Regimental Church of the Seaforth Highlanders and is in the process of being designated Regimental Church of the BC Regiment, Duke of Connaught's Own. Bishop Michael Ingham authorized a liturgy for the celebration of lesbian and gay covenants in December 2002. Christ Church Cathedral's Annual Vestry meeting in February 2003 gave approval for the ministry to be offered as part of the parish's pastoral care for the community. The spring and fall of 2004 saw the installation of a Kenneth Jones tracker organ in the south gallery of the renovated Cathedral. Comprising a three manual console and 2500 pipes, 1700 salvaged from the Casavant, it is the first Christ Church Cathedral organ custom built to speak with optimum effect in the sanctuary. On September 25, 2014, the parish submitted \\"A Statement in Favour of the Solemnization of Same Sex Matrimony in the Anglican Church of Canada\\" to the Anglican Church of Canada's commission on the marriage canon. This statement was submitted by the cathedral's clergy, wardens and parish council.Cathedral website. Worship View of the cathedral altar from the nave of the cathedral Holy Communion is celebrated using both the Book of Common Prayer and the Book of Alternative Services. Both a simple spoken celebration and a choral or sung eucharist celebrated with congregational hymns featuring an eclectic mix of Mass settings, psalmody, anthems and instrumental music are practised. Music in worship ranges from plainsong to motets from the baroque and classical periods to contemporary and world music. Cathedral musician, Rupert Lang is a prolific and respected composer and many of his sacred pieces debut during this liturgy. The cathedral clergy share preaching duties at services with guest preachers booked throughout the year. Guest preachers in the recent past have included a former Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, and the noted environmental scientist David Suzuki. It is also the church at which the royal family worships when in Vancouver.Adams, Neal (2006). Living Stones. A History of Christ Church Cathedral. 2nd Ed. Vancouver: Christ Church Cathedral. In May 2014, the cathedral formed St. Brigids, an emerging Christian community rooted in the Anglican tradition. The community identifies with the Emerging Church movement. Deans of New Westminster Holy Trinity Cathedral in New Westminster formerly housed the Dean of New Westminster, until that seat was moved to Christ Church Cathedral in Vancouver in 1929.

Dutch ovens are usually made of seasoned cast iron; however, some Dutch ovens are instead made of cast aluminium, or ceramic. Some metal varieties are enameled rather than being seasoned, and these are sometimes called French ovens. Dutch ovens have been used as cooking vessels for hundreds of years. They are called casserole dishes in English-speaking countries other than the United States ( means \\"pan\\" in French), and in French. They are similar to both the Japanese and the , a traditional Balkan cast-iron oven, and are related to the South African , the Australian Bedourie oven and Spanish . History =Early European history= During the 17th century, brass was the preferred metal for English cookware and domestic utensils, and the Dutch produced it at the lowest cost, which, however, was still expensive.Rosen, William, The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry, and Invention (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 2010),p. 145. In 1702, Abraham Darby was a partner in the Brass Works Company of Bristol, which made malt mills for breweries.See: * (Rosen, 2010), p. 145. * (Burwood, 1999), p. 396. Apparently in 1704, Darby visited the Netherlands, where he studied the Dutch methods of working brass, including the casting of brass pots.See: * (Rosen, 2010), p. 146. * (Burwood, 1999), p. 396. * (Ashton, 1924), p. 27. Darby learned that when making castings, the Dutch used molds made of sand, rather than the traditional loam and clay, and this innovation produced a finer finish on their brassware.See: * (Rosen, 2010), p. 146. * (Burwood, 1999), p. 396. * Ashton, Thomas Southcliffe, Iron and Steel in the Industrial Revolution (Manchester, England: Manchester University Press, 1924), pp. 26‚Äì27. In 1706 he started a new brass mill in the Baptist Mills section of Bristol.See: * (Percy, 1864), p. 887. * (Burwood, 1999), p. 396. There, Darby realized that he could sell more kitchen wares if he could replace brass with a cheaper metal, namely, cast iron.See: * (Rosen, 2010), p. 146. * (Percy, 1864), p. 887. Initial experiments to cast iron in sand molds were unsuccessful, but with the aid of one of his workers, James Thomas, a Welshman, he succeeded in casting iron cookware.See: * (Ashton, 1924), p. 27. * Burwood, Stephen, \\"Abraham Darby\\" in: Magill, Frank N., ed., The 17th and 18th Centuries: Dictionary of World Biography, vol. 4 (Ipswich, Massachusetts: Salem Press, Inc., 1999), pp. 396‚Äì398 ; see p. 396. * Percy, John, Metallurgy: The Art of Extracting Metals from Their Ores and Adapting Them to Various Purposes of Manufacture (London, England: John Murray, 1864), p. 887. In 1707 he obtained a patent for the process of casting iron in sand, which derived from the Dutch process.Darby, Abraham, \\"Casting iron bellied pots in sand only,\\" British patent no. 380 (issued: 1707), in: Woodcroft, Bennet, ed., Appendix to Reference Index of Patents of Invention, Containing Abstracts from such of the Early Patents ‚Ä¶ (London, England: Great Seal Patent Office, 1855), p. 46. Thus, the term \\"Dutch oven\\" has endured for over 300 years, since at least 1710.Dutch Ovens Chronicled 3‚Äì4The Merriam- Webster Dictionary states that the term \\"Dutch oven\\" first appeared in print in 1769. See: Merriam-Webster EtymologyOnLine also states that the first occurrence of the term \\"Dutch oven\\" was in 1769. See article: Dutch (adj.) Indeed, a \\"Dutch oven\\" is mentioned in the records of the Augusta county (Virginia) courthouse for October 20, 1769: Chalkley, Lyman, Chronicles of the Scotch-Irish settlement in Virginia ‚Ä¶ (Rosslyn, Virginia: Commonwealth Printing Co., 1912), vol. 1, p. 159. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Researching Food Historyhttp://researchingfoodhistory.blogspot.com/2014/09/dutch-oven-iron-or- tin-or-brick.html agree that several very different cooking devices were called \\"Dutch ovens\\" ‚Äî a cast-iron pan with legs and a lid; a roughly rectangular box that was open on one side and that was used to roast meats, and a compartment in a brick hearth that was used for baking. =American history= American Dutch ovens changed over time during the colonial era. These changes included a shallower pot, legs to hold the oven above the coals, and a lid flange to keep the coals on the lid and out of the food.Dutch Ovens Chronicled 11-14 Paul Revere is credited with the design of the flat lid with a ridge for holding coals as well as the addition of legs to the pots. Colonists and settlers valued cast-iron cookware because of its versatility and durability. Cooks used them to boil, bake, stew, fry, and roast. The ovens were so valuable that wills in the 18th and 19th centuries frequently spelled out the desired inheritor. For example, Mary Ball Washington (mother of President George Washington) specified in her will, dated 20 May 1788, that one-half of her \\"iron kitchen furniture\\" should go to her grandson, Fielding Lewis, and the other half to Betty Carter, a granddaughter. This bequest included several Dutch ovens.Dutch Ovens Chronicled 28 Westward-bound settlers took Dutch ovens with them. A Dutch oven was among the gear Lewis and Clark carried when they explored the great American Northwest between 1804 and 1806. Mormon pioneers who settled the American West also took along their Dutch ovens. In fact, a statue raised to honor the Mormon handcart companies who entered Utah‚Äôs Salt Lake Valley in the 1850s proudly displays a Dutch oven hanging from the front of the handcart. The Dutch oven is also the official state cooking pot of Texas,https://www.npr.org/2005/04/22/4616266/texas-pays- tribute-to-the-dutch-oven Utah, and Arkansas. Mountain men exploring the American frontier used Dutch ovens into the late 19th century. Chuckwagons accompanying western cattle drives also carried Dutch ovens from the mid-19th century into the early 20th century.Dutch Ovens Chronicled 33-54 =Dutch history= A Dutch oven, or braadpan, as it is used in the Netherlands today In the Netherlands, a Dutch oven is called a braadpan, which literally translates to roasting pan. Another name for it is sudderpan, which literally translates to \\"simmerpan\\" or \\"simmering pot\\". The design most used today is a black (with blue inside) enameled steel pan that is suitable for gas and induction heating. The model was introduced in 1891 by BK, a well-known Dutch manufacturer of cookware. Cheaper and lighter in weight than cast iron, it proved to be a revolution in the kitchen. A History of BK (De geschiedenis van BK) , Retrieved 15 September 2013 A braadpan is mainly used for frying meat only, but it can also be used for making traditional stews, such as hach√©e. Cast-iron models exist, but are used less frequently. Types =Camping= A camping, cowboy, or chuckwagon Dutch oven usually has three integral legs, a wire bail handle, and a slightly concave, rimmed lid so that coals from the cooking fire can be placed on top as well as below. This provides more uniform internal heat and lets the inside act as an oven. A Dutch oven without integral legs can be used as a conventional pot on a stove, or may be set on a separate welded steel or cast iron tripod stand or on small stones when cooking on hot coals. These ovens are typically made of bare cast iron, although some are aluminium. The bail handle facilitates lifting the Dutch oven onto and off the coals, using a metal hook. Dutch ovens are often used in Scouting outdoor activities. =Bedourie oven= In Australia, a bedourie camp oven is a steel cookpot, shaped and used like a Dutch oven. Named after Bedourie, Queensland, the Bedourie ovens were developed as a more robust, non- breakable alternative to the cast-iron Dutch ovens. =Potjie= A cast-iron potjie on a fire In South Africa, a potjie ( ), directly translated \\"pottle or little pot\\" from Afrikaans or Dutch, is unlike most other Dutch ovens, in that it is round-bottomed. Traditionally it is a single cast, cast-iron pot, reinforced with external double or triple circumscribing ribs, a bail handle for suspending the pot, and three short legs for resting the pot. It is similar in appearance to a cauldron. It has a matching handled lid, which is recessed, and convex to allow for hot coals to rest on top, providing additional heat from above. When the vessel is to be stored long term, care must be taken to avoid rust forming by seasoning. \\"Potjie\\" can also refer to the technique of cooking potjiekos. Among the recipes that require a potjie, there is one for a type of bread called \\"potbrood\\", which literally means \\"pot bread\\". Among the South African indigenous peoples, specifically Zulus, these pots also became known as phutu pots, after a popular food prepared in it. The larger pots are normally used for large gatherings, e.g., funerals or weddings, to prepare large quantities of food. Wooden spoons called kombe in the Tsonga language are used for mixing and stirring. This tradition originated in the Netherlands during the Siege of Leiden and was brought to South Africa by Dutch immigrants. It persisted over the years with the Voortrekkers and survives today as a traditional Afrikaner method of cooking. It is still in common use by South African campers, both domestic and international. = Chavunok or Chugunok= In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, a chavunok (chawoonok) or chugunok is a cast-iron pot used in a modern oven or in a traditional Russian oven, hearth, or a campfire. A chugunok is used in a variety of cooking methods, including high temperature cooking, low- temperature cooking, thermal cooking, slow cooking, smothering, roasting, baking, braising, and stewing. The shape of a chugunok is similar to a traditional crock with a narrow top and bottom and wider in the middle. When used inside a traditional oven, a long handled holding tool is used with a roller that serves as a lever to lift a heavy chugunok in and out of the oven. Since there are no handles, it's inconvenient to use a chugunok on a kitchen stove. Often several chugunoks of different sizes are used in the oven at the same time to prepare the entire meal. Dishes usually cooked in a chugunok are roast meat with vegetables called \\"zharkoye\\", holubtsi, potato babka, stuffed peppers, and baked milk. Use in cooking Dutch ovens are well suited for long, slow cooking, such as in making roasts, stews, and casseroles. Virtually any recipe that can be cooked in a conventional oven can be cooked in a Dutch oven. When cooking over a campfire, it is possible to use old-style lipped cast-iron Dutch ovens as true baking ovens, to prepare biscuits, cakes, breads, pizzas, and even pies. A smaller baking pan can be placed inside the ovens, used and replaced with another as the first batch is completed. It is also possible to stack Dutch ovens on top of each other, conserving the heat that would normally rise from the hot coals on the top. These stacks can be as high as five or six pots. Seasoning and care =Bare cast iron= Traditionally Dutch ovens are seasoned like other cast-iron cookware. After use Dutch ovens are typically cleaned like other cast-iron cookware: with boiling water, and a soft brush or sponge. Where possible, a cleaned and freshly oiled Dutch oven should be stored in a clean, dry location with the lid ajar or off to promote air circulation and to avoid the smell and taste of rancid oil. If the Dutch oven must be stored with the lid on, a paper towel or piece of newspaper should be placed inside the oven to absorb any moisture. With care, after much use the surfaces of the Dutch oven will become dark black, very smooth, shiny and non-stick. With proper care, a Dutch oven will provide long service. =Enameled ovens= Enameled ovens do not need to be seasoned before use. However, they lose some of the other advantages of bare cast iron. Enameled ovens can usually be cleaned like ordinary cookware, and some brands can be put in the dishwasher. However, enamel is not as resistant to scratches as iron.

Although theoretically independent, it largely came under the control of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), which envisaged it as a buffer state between the RSFSR and the territories occupied by Japan during the Russian Civil War of 1917‚Äì1922. Its first president was Alexander Krasnoshchyokov. The Far Eastern Republic occupied the territory of modern Zabaykalsky Krai, Amur Oblast, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, Khabarovsk Krai, and Primorsky Krai of Russia (the former Transbaikal and Amur oblasts and Primorsky krai). Its capital was established at Verkhneudinsk (now Ulan-Ude), but in October 1920 it moved to Chita. The Red Army occupied Vladivostok on 25 October 1922. Three weeks later, on 15 November 1922, the Far Eastern Republic merged with the RSFSR. History =Establishment= The Far Eastern Republic was established in the aftermath of the Russian Civil War. During the Civil War local authorities generally controlled the towns and cities of the Russian Far East, cooperating to a greater or lesser extent with the White Siberian government of Alexander Kolchak and with the succeeding invading forces of the Japanese Army. When the Japanese evacuated the Trans-Baikal and Amur oblasts in the spring of 1920, a political vacuum resulted. A new central authority was established at Chita to govern the Far Eastern Republic remaining in the Japanese wake.\\"The Far Eastern Republic,\\" Russian Information and Review, vol. 1, no. 10 (Feb. 15, 1922), pp. 232‚Äì233. The Far Eastern Republic was established comprising only the area around Verkhne-Udinsk, but during the summer of 1920, the Soviet government of the Amur territory agreed to join. The Far Eastern Republic was formed two months after Kolchak's death with the tacit support of the government of Soviet Russia, which saw it as a temporary buffer state between the RSFSR and the territories occupied by Japan.Alan Wood, \\"The Revolution and Civil War in Siberia,\\" in Edward Acton, Vladimir Iu. Cherniaev, and William G. Rosenberg (eds.), Critical Companion to the Russian Revolution, 1914‚Äì1921. Bloomington, Indiana University Press, 1997; pp. 716‚Äì717. Many members of the Russian Communist Party had disagreed with the decision to allow a new government in the region, believing that their approximately 4,000 members were capable of seizing power in their own right.George Jackson and Robert Devlin (eds.), Dictionary of the Russian Revolution. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1989; pp. 223‚Äì225. However, Vladimir Lenin and other party leaders in Moscow felt that the approximately 70,000 Japanese and 12,000 American troops might regard such an action as a provocation, which might spur a further attack that the Soviet Republic could ill afford. On 1 April 1920, American forces headed by General William S. Graves departed Siberia, leaving the Japanese the sole occupying power in the region with whom the Bolsheviks were forced to deal.N.G.O. Pereira, White Siberia: The Politics of Civil War. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1996; pg. 153. This detail did not change the basic equation for the Bolshevik government in Moscow, however, which continued to see the establishment of a Far Eastern Republic as a sort of Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in the east, providing the regime with a necessary breathing space that would allow it to recover economically and militarily.Pereira, White Siberia, pg. 152. On 6 April 1920, a hastily convened Constituent Assembly gathered at Verkhneudinsk and proclaimed the establishment of the Far Eastern Republic. Promises were made that the republic's new constitution would guarantee free elections under the principles of universal, direct, and equal suffrage and that foreign investment in the country would be encouraged. The Far Eastern Republic, controlled by moderate socialists, was only grudgingly recognized by the various cities of the region towards the end of 1920. Violence, atrocities, and reprisals continued to erupt periodically for the next 18 months. Japan agreed to recognize the new buffer state in a truce with the Red Army signed 15 July 1920, effectively abandoning Ataman Grigory Semenov and his Russia Eastern Outskirts. By October Semenov had been expelled from his base of operations in Chita. With Semenov out of the picture, the capital of the Far Eastern Republic moved to that city. On 11 November 1920 a provisional national assembly for the Far East met in Vladivostok. The gathering recognized the government at Chita and set 9 January 1921 as the date for new elections for the Constituent Assembly of the Far Eastern Republic. A new constitution closely resembling the United States Constitution was written and approved on 27 April 1921. =The 1921 coup= However, right-wing forces rejected the idea of a fledgling democratic republic. On 26 May 1921 a White coup took place in Vladivostok, backed by Japanese occupying forces. A cordon sanitaire of Japanese troops protected the insurgents, who sought to establish a new r√©gime known as the Provisional Government of the Priamur. Shortly after the coup, Ataman Semenov arrived in Vladivostok and attempted to proclaim himself commander-in-chief‚Äîan effort which failed when his Japanese benefactors forsook him.Pereira, White Siberia, pg. 155. The new Provisional Government of Priamur attempted‚Äîwith little success‚Äîto rally the various anti- Bolshevik forces to its banner.Pereira, White Siberia, pg. 156. Its leaders, two Vladivostok businessmen, the brothers S.D. and N.D. Merkulov found themselves left isolated when the Japanese Army announced on 24 June 1922 that it would remove all of its troops from Siberia by the end of October. A July Zemsky sobor deposed the Merkulov brothers and named a former officer of the Czechoslovak Legion, M.K. Dieterichs, as military dictator. With the Japanese exiting the country throughout the summer of 1922, panic swept through the White Russian community. As the Red Army, thinly disguised as the army of the Far Eastern Republic, approached, thousands of Russians fled abroad to escape the new r√©gime. The army of the Far Eastern Republic retook Vladivostok on 25 October 1922, effectively bringing the Russian Civil War to a close. With the Civil War finally over, Soviet Russia absorbed the Far Eastern Republic on 15 November 1922. The government of the Far Eastern Republic dissolved itself and transferred all its authority and territory to the Bolshevik government in Moscow. Japan retained the northern half of Sakhalin Island until 1925, ostensibly as compensation for the massacre of about 700 civilians and soldiers at the Japanese garrison at Nikolaevsk-na-Amure in January 1920. This \\"compensatory\\" motive for holding the territory was belied by the fact that Japanese retaliation for the actions of the Russian partisans had taken between two and three times as many Russian lives. Territory and resources Territory of the Far Eastern Republic in 1922. The Far Eastern Republic consisted of four provinces of the former Russian empire‚ÄîTrans-Baikal, Amur, the Maritime Province, and the northern half of Sakhalin island. Primarily, it represented the boundaries of the regions of Transbaikal and Outer Manchuria. The frontiers of the short-lived nation followed the western coastline of Lake Baikal along the northern borders of Mongolia and Manchuria to the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk. The total area of the Far Eastern Republic was reckoned at approximately and its population at about 3.5 million people. Of these an estimated 1.62 million were ethnic Russians and just over 1 million were of Asian extraction, with family lineages originating in China, Japan, Mongolia, and Korea. The Far Eastern Republic was an area of substantial mineral wealth, including territory which produced about one-third of the entire Russian output of gold as well as that country's only source of domestically produced tin. Other mineral reserves of the Far Eastern Republic included zinc, iron, and coal. The fishing industry of the former Maritime Province was substantial, with a total catch exceeding that of Iceland and featuring ample stocks of herring, salmon, and sturgeon. The Republic also boasted extensive forestry resources, including over of harvestable pine, fir, cedar, poplar, and birch.

The Canadian Encyclopedia, April 8, 2009. Education Christopher Pratt first started painting watercolours in 1952. In 1953 he attended Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick as a student in pre-medicine. At Mount Allison he quickly became interested in Fine Arts, especially painting. He was encouraged to paint by Lawren P. Harris and Alex Colville. From 1957 to 1959 Pratt studied at the Glasgow School of Art in Scotland. During the summers, he returned to Newfoundland to work as a construction surveyor at the American Naval Base at Argentia. The training he received in precise measuring was applied to his paintings. In 1959 Pratt returned to Mount Allison University to complete in 1961 a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. During this period he began to make silkscreen prints. The early screen print Boat in Sand, 1961 in the National Gallery's collection was produced at this time and included in the Gallery's fourth Biennial Exhibition. Career In 1961, Pratt accepted the position of curator at the newly opened Memorial University Art Gallery in St. John's. He remained at the gallery for two and a half years before deciding to concentrate on his painting full-time, moving his family to Salmonier, Newfoundland. Provincial flag of Newfoundland and Labrador, designed by Pratt and adopted in 1980 Pratt was the subject of a major touring retrospective organized by the Vancouver Art Gallery in 1985, a touring print retrospective and catalogue raisonn√©, The Prints of Christopher Pratt: 1958-1991 in 1992, a major traveling exhibition organized by the National Gallery of Canada in 2005, and a ten-year retrospective of his work at The Rooms in 2015. Pratt has served on the Canadian government's Stamp Design Advisory Committee from 1972 to 1975 and on the board of the Canada Council for the Arts from 1975 to 1981. In 1980, Pratt designed the Provincial Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador. His work is found in the public collections of the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Vancouver Art Gallery, The Rooms, and the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia.

While Pratt never thought of her work as being focused on one subject matter, her early works focus on domestic scenes, while some of her later work have a darker undertone, with people as the central subject matter. She painted what appealed to her, being emotionally connected to her subject. Pratt often spoke of conveying the sensuality of light in her paintings, and of the \\"erotic charge\\" her chosen subjects possessed. Career =Painting= Mary Pratt's work focused on her relationship with domestic life in rural Newfoundland and common household items: jars of jelly, apples, aluminum foil, brown paper bags. Using photographic projections while painting, Pratt's style was bold and flamboyant, rendering her subject vivid and realistic. Due to this transformation of the mundane into something aesthetic, \\"she may have had more influence on shaping the way we see things than any Canadian painter since the Group of Seven\\". Pratt arrived at her signature style in the late 1960s, after discovering that light was her central subject and deciding to incorporate photography into her artistic process. Her paintings The Bed (1968) and Supper Table (1969) are the earliest examples of her characteristic style. In 1978 Pratt's painting Girl in a Wicker Chair, created that year, was published on the cover of Saturday Night magazine. This was the first of an extended series of paintings on Donna Meaney, who first served as a model for Pratt's artist husband, Christopher Pratt, and later began an affair with him. Many of Pratt's paintings were based on earlier slides of Meaney that her husband had taken. Pratt's portraits of Meaney embody a noticeable tension that is absent in her husband's paintings of her. However, Pratt always regarded Meaney as a friend. In the 1980s Pratt continued exploring new subject matter and media. She created a series of paintings on weddings, including a portrait of her daughter Barbara, entitled Barby in the Dress She Made Herself (1986). Another series consists of paintings and mixed-media drawings of fires, which function as a metaphor for sacrifice. Using pastels and coloured pencils in this series enabled Pratt to work on a larger scale than she had previously done in oils. In the early 1990s Pratt and her husband separated, which lent her paintings of that period a darker, angry tone. For example, Pomegranates in Glass on Glass (1993) depicts the fruit torn apart into pieces, exposing its blood-red seeds. In a 2013 Globe and Mail article, responding to critics of her work as too commercial, she said, \\"People will find out that in each one of the paintings there is something that ought to disturb them, something upsetting. That is why I painted them.\\" =Exhibitions= Pratt's paintings have been exhibited in most major galleries in Canada, reproduced in magazines such as Saturday Night, Chatelaine, and Canadian Art. Her work is found in many prominent public, corporate, and private collections, including those of the National Gallery of Canada, The Rooms, Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, the New Brunswick Museum, Beaverbrook Art Gallery, Vancouver Art Gallery, Art Gallery of Ontario, and Canada House in England. Pratt's first solo exhibition was held at the Memorial University Art Gallery in St. John's in 1967. The first showing of her art outside Atlantic Canada was part of an exhibition at the Picture Loan Gallery in 1971 in Toronto. In 1973, Erindale College (Toronto) gave her a show of her own. The big breakthrough for wider notice of Pratt's work came when the National Gallery of Canada included many of her paintings and drawing in an exhibition in 1975. Her work also coincided with the upsurge of the women's movement (International Women's Year was in 1975 as well). Several colleges and universities began incorporating discussions of her works in their women's studies programs. In 1995, the touring exhibition The Art of Mary Pratt: The Substance of Light was organized by the Beaverbrook Art Gallery in Fredericton, New Brunswick. The accompanying catalogue won numerous awards and was included in Great Canadian Books of the Century. Other recent shows at commercial galleries include Inside Light at the Equinox Gallery in Vancouver, Canada (May/June 2011) and New Paintings and Works on Paper at the Mira Godard Gallery in Toronto, Canada (May/June 2012). The exhibition was curated by Tom Smart. The solo exhibition titled Mary Pratt toured throughout Canada from 2013 to January, 2015. It was organized by The Rooms Provincial Art Gallery and Art Gallery of Nova Scotia and curated by Mireille Eagan, Sarah Fillmore, and Caroline Stone. The accompanying catalogue was published by Goose Lane Editions. The tour traveled to the Art Gallery of Windsor in Windsor, Ontario; the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario; the MacKenzie Art Gallery in Regina, Saskatchewan; and the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The solo exhibition Mary Pratt: This Little Painting was on display at the National Gallery of Canada, running from April 4, 2015 to January 4, 2016. It toured to the Owens Art Gallery at Mount Allison University from March 11 to May 22, 2016. The exhibition was co- organized by the National Gallery of Canada and The Rooms Provincial Art Gallery. It was curated by Jonathan Shaughnessy and Mireille Eagan. Other major retrospectives include Museum London (1981) and the Robert McLaughlin Gallery, Oshawa (1983). =Advisory/Public Duty= Pratt served on the government Task Force for Education in Newfoundland in 1973, on the Fishery Industry Advisory Board from 1978 to 1979, and on the Board of Management of the Grace General Hospital in St. John's, Newfoundland. She also served on the Federal Cultural Policy Review Committee, which produced the Applebaum-H√©bert Report in 1981. Pratt chaired a committee to advise on the creation of the School of Fine Arts at Sir Wilfred Grenfell College in Corner Brook, Newfoundland in 1985. Pratt held numerous other positions, including a seat on the Canada Council from 1987 to 1993, and on the Board of Regents of Mount Allison University from 1983 to 1991. In the 1980s, Pratt began giving addresses and published essays in periodicals such as The Globe and Mail and Glass Gazette. Personal life Pratt was the daughter of Harvard-educated attorney William J. West, who served as the Minister of Justice of New Brunswick from 1952 to 1958 and Katherine West (born MacMurray). From as young as the age of 2, Pratt was intrigued by the relationship of light meeting a subject and started taking paint lessons by the age of 10. She had a younger sister, Barbara West Cross. She was strongly influenced by her maternal grandmother, Edna McMurray, who was the co-founder of the first IODE chapter in New Brunswick and served as its activist president for over 20 years. Pratt attended Mount Allison University, studying Fine Arts under Alex Colville, Ted Pulford, and Lawren P. Harris. , completing her degree in 1961. In her second year, she met the artist Christopher Pratt while they were both students there; they married on September 12, 1957. For many years Pratt did not paint as she was busy raising their 4 children and supporting her husbands career. Immediately after, they moved to Scotland, where Christopher had been accepted to the Glasgow School of Art. In 1964, they moved to Salmonier, in rural Newfoundland. Years later, they moved to St. Catherines, St. Mary's Bay, a small community south of St. John's. They had four children: John, Anne, Barbara, and Edwyn (Ned). She and Christopher separated in 2004. Awards and Honours In 1996, Pratt was named Companion of the Order of Canada. In 1997, she was awarded the $50,000 Molson Prize for visual artists from the Canada Council for the Arts. In 2013, she was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. Pratt was also awarded nine honorary degrees from various universities throughout Canada, including from Dalhousie University, Memorial University, and St. Thomas University. In 2006, Pratt was awarded the Long Haul Award presented at the EVA Awards ceremony, which recognizes her as an influential artist in Newfoundland visual culture. In 2007, Canada Post issued stamps in its \\"Art Canada\\" series in honour of Mary Pratt. The $0.52 (domestic rate) stamp featured her Jelly Shelf (1999). The souvenir sheet included the $0.52 stamp, as well as a $1.55 (international rate) stamp with her Iceberg in the North Atlantic (1991).

French stamp overprinted with Chinese currency face value in French and Chinese. The French post offices in China were among the post offices maintained by foreign powers in China from the mid-19th century until 1922. The first French Post Office in China opened in 1862. Initially, the French government used ordinary French postage stamps for these offices. These forerunner stamps can be shown to have been sold or used in China only by a postmark. Stamps used at Shanghai prior to 1876, for example, can only be identified by diamond-shaped cancel made of a type referred to (in French) as a ‚Äúlosange √† gros chiffres‚Äù with the numbers \\"5104\\" in the center of the cancel. Operation Unlike the other foreign post offices in China, the French operated two distinct types of post offices in China. Offices of the first type, typically located in French concessions and mostly in northern China, were run directly by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The offices of the second type, also referred to as the ‚ÄúIndochinese Offices‚Äù were located in southern China and operated under the direction of the postal administration of the nearby colony of French Indochina.Jacques Desrousseaux, \\"Bureaux Indochinois en Chine (Indochinese Offices in China, in French)\\". Colfra Editions, Paris, 2011. =Run by France= The Paris-run Post Offices in China and their opening dates are as follows:Dr. J√©r√¥me Chane- Tune, Bureaux fran√ßais et indochinois en Chine.

Stamp issues of the 20th century initially included overprints applied to some of the stamps issued for use in French Indochina, and continued with stamps printed specifically for use in China. Some earlier 20th century stamps were issued only with face values expressed in French francs, but all later issues were overprinted with the equivalent of the stamp‚Äôs Chinese currency face value expressed in both French and Chinese. In addition to ordinary postage stamps, France also issued postal stationery and postage due stamps for use at the Paris-run Chinese post offices. =Run by French Indochina= French Indochina stamp overprinted for use in Kouang-Tch√©ou-Wan. Two stamps of the French colony of Indochine overprinted for use in Pak-Hoi (Beihai). French Indochina stamp overprinted for use in Mongtseu. The post offices run by French Indochina differed from the other French Post Offices in China in a number of areas. Initially, the general issues of the Paris-run French Offices in China c. 1902-1904 were used, and these can be found with postmarks applied by the Indochinese offices. But shortly thereafter, stamps were issued with overprints specific to the office that issued them. For instance, the Canton office issued stamps overprinted ‚ÄúCANTON‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúCHINE.‚Äù Seven such Indochinese post offices had these overprints (here written as they appeared on the stamps) along with their opening dates: 1900 * Hoi Hao * Kouang Tch√©ou Wan * Yunnan Fou 1901 * Canton 1902 * Pakhoi 1903 * Mongtseu * Tchongking One additional way that the Indochinese offices differed from the other French Post Offices in China was that their issues were all overprints applied to the then-current stamps of French Indochina, rather than to the stamps of France. The Paris-run offices would not accept mail franked with unoverprinted stamps of French Indochina, but the Indochinese run-offices are known to have done so. For this reason, French Indochina stamps are sometimes found legitimately used with cancels from one of their Chinese offices. Stamps from the Indochinese offices in China can likewise be found with cancels from Indochina proper, although these were likely applied at Hanoi or other locations through which mail had to pass, (i.e. these are essentially paquebot cancels.) - From 1923, remainder stocks of the Indochinese office issues were used up in Indochina and Kouang Tch√©ou Wan, see below. The Indochinese Offices in France also sometimes opened sub-post offices within the area they served. For instance, the Canton office would eventually open six branches within the area it served. The specific branch a Canton stamp was used at can sometimes be seen in the postmark. Earlier Canton postmarks read ‚ÄúCanton / Chine‚Äù whereas later cancels include a letter from A to F to show at which branch of the Canton office they were used. Closure All foreign-run post offices in China permanently closed on 31 December 1922 √âditions Yvert & Tellier, \\"Catalogue de Timbres-Poste Tome 1\\". √âditions Yvert & Tellier, Paris, 2007. if they had not been closed earlier. \\\\- The remainder stocks of the Indochinese office issues were called back by the French Indochina postal authorities and used up in Indochina and Kouang Tch√©ou Wan. They are seen on commercially used covers, also used in mixed frank with regular issues, until the mid 1930s. Particular the stocks of high denomination stamps took a long time to be exhausted. Kwangchowan One notable exception to this were the post offices in Kouang Tch√©ou Wan (usually written in English as ‚ÄúKwangchowan‚Äù) which was a territory leased by treaty to France for a 99-year period starting in 1898. This was an arrangement essentially similar to that covering Hong Kong‚Äôs ‚ÄúNew Territories‚Äù from 1898 to 1997.Jacques Desrousseaux, \\"Territoire de Kouang Tch√©ou Wan (Territory of Kwangchowan, in French)\\". Colfra Editions, Paris, 2011. Due to its status as a leased territory still in existence after 1922, Kouang Tch√©ou was the only French postal entity in China to issue airmail stamps and semi-postal stamps, although most of these were issued by the government of Vichy France. Due to war-time conditions and to the fact that the colonial authorities in Kouang Tch√©ou did not recognize the Vichy government, Vichy-issued stamps for Kouang Tch√©ou were never placed in use there. French postal operations in Kouang-Tch√©ou continued until 1943, when the colony was occupied by the Japanese army. Although France resumed sovereignty briefly over the colony for a few months at the end of the Second World War the territory was returned to China in early 1946.

Early life Rochester was born in Westmoreland County, Virginia. His father, who owned Rochester House, died when he was two years old and five years later his mother remarried. In 1763, Rochester moved with all but his eldest brother to Granville County, North Carolina. Career At age 16, he found a job with a local Hillsborough merchant and became partner in the business within five years. In his early working years, Rochester also served as clerk for the local vestry, as a committee member for a civic organization, and, most notably, as a delegate to North Carolina's first Provincial Congress. =Military, politics, and business= Hailed as a leader in local political circles, Rochester was appointed a Major in the North Carolina militia and served as a paymaster. He suffered a physical breakdown (likely exhaustion), however, and was forced to resign from the service. Once recovered, Rochester returned to Hillsborough and was elected to the North Carolina General Assembly, where he served as county clerk. Also that year, Rochester was appointed Colonel of the North Carolina militia, and Commissioner in charge of building and managing an arms factory in Hillsborough. Once again, Rochester resigned from most of his duties (including vacating his Assembly seat) and entered into a business partnership with Thomas Hart, a notable and wealthy merchant and land speculator. Rochester and Hart relocated to Hagerstown, Maryland in 1780, taking up an estate on the southern edge of the town. He served on the vestry of Saint John's Church. Hart and Rochester owned and operated numerous businesses during their time in Hagerstown, including a slavery-dependent business, grist mill, nail and rope factory. Nathaniel Rochester was an early trucker taking wagon loads of goods up into New York State, where he located the land he bought that became Rochester. Although the partnership dissolved in 1792, Rochester continued to operate the mill. Rochester served one term in the Maryland General Assembly, and two years as postmaster. He was elected as a judge in 1797, but recognizing that he did not have the proper legal training, resigned the post. He served as Washington County's Sheriff from 1804 to 1806. In 1807, Rochester helped found the Hagerstown Bank, serving as its first president. =Land speculation= Rochester's house from Dansville, now at the Genesee Country Village and Museum Two of the directors of the Hagerstown Bank, Colonel William Fitzhugh and Major Charles Carroll were, like Rochester, wealthy landowners interested in acquiring land in the new \\"frontier\\" of the U.S. In 1800, Fitzhugh and Carroll convinced Rochester to travel with them on a prospecting visit to the frontier lands of New York State, and specifically to the lands along the upper portion of the Genesee River. Fitzhugh and Carroll acquired land along the river on their trip, but Rochester, sensing the opportunity to develop a town, chose a tract along Canaseragea Creek near the hamlet of Dansville. Upon a return trip to the area, they travelled farther up the river to a small abandoned tract of land near the river's Upper Falls. The men saw a business opportunity here as any goods which travelled up the river would need to be unloaded here and portage fees could be charged. They purchased of land around the falls for $1,750. Rochester's interest in the land he now owned along the Genesee, in part, prompted him to decide to relocate his family there in 1810. In early June of that year, the family reached Dansville and established a homestead. =Life on the Genesee= Rochester quickly became a leading citizen of Dansville upon his arrival, establishing numerous businesses and mills and playing an active role in the early politics of the town. So busy was his life in Dansville that he offered to sell his share of the Upper Falls tract to Major Carroll. Carroll, however, got Rochester to keep his interest. =Rochesterville= In 1811 Rochester began the process of establishing a town on the Upper Falls tract. He laid out streets and established plots of land for municipal, church, and business use. Later that year, he began to offer the plots for sale and named the would-be settlement \\"Rochesterville\\" after himself. The War of 1812 helped Rochesterville grow as settlers living along the coast of Lake Ontario sought to move farther inland. In 1812, Rochester moved his family from Dansville to Rochesterville to enable sale of the remaining Dansville property and to provide settlers in Rochesterville assurances that the settlement was here to stay. Numerous skirmishes and war activities were taking place throughout western New York and Rochesterville served as a waypoint for troops heading west as well as a depot for military supplies. The exposure was good for the settlement, as many people who had travelled through it bought lots or tracts in or near the village. Rochester was a presidential elector in 1816, voting for James Monroe and Daniel D. Tompkins. In 1817 Rochester served on a committee to petition the state to build what would become the Erie Canal on a proposed northern route that included a route across the Genesee River at Rochesterville. The eventual decision by the state's government to accept this northern route became a predominant factor in the growth of the future city. In late 1817, Rochester helped petition the state for the incorporation of Rochesterville. Although the first petition failed due to opposition from neighboring jurisdictions, a second petition passed. Rochester's village was incorporated that year. Also in 1817, Rochester was part of a group which organized St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Genesee Falls, with Rochester serving as its first Senior Warden. Eventually Rochester gave land for the building of the church on Fitzhugh St. In 1821 Rochester played a pivotal role in the creation of Monroe County, which Rochester named after President James Monroe. When the county was officially formed, Rochester became its first county clerk and was elected as the county's first representative to the New York State Assembly. =Later years= Rochester remained an active participant in the growth of the town and county he founded, playing many pivotal roles in the development of its economy and status. He played an active role in politics, helped found churches and banks, and served as the first president of the Rochester Athen√¶num (which would later become Rochester Institute of Technology). During the last two years of his life, Rochester made few public appearances, but rather spent most of his time with his now rather large family, including his 28 grandchildren still living at the Colonel's 79th birthday. Suffering from a protracted and painful illness, Rochester died May 17, 1831. He was interred at Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester. Personal life In 1788, he married Sophia Beatty (1768‚Äì1845) in Hagerstown, Maryland, and they had twelve children, among them Judge and Congressman William B. Rochester and Mayor Thomas H. Rochester. =Legacy= Rochester Institute of Technology has a dormitory named Nathaniel Rochester Hall, the third tallest of the campus' four dormitory towers. The intersection of South Avenue and Alexander Street in the South Wedge neighborhood is home to Nathaniel Square Park, which boasts a statue of Nathaniel Rochester sitting on a bench. There is also a school in the city of Rochester named Nathaniel Rochester Community School (School No. 3).

The two triangle-shaped arms form a shroud around the cold target to protect it until they open five seconds before a shot. The National Ignition Facility (NIF), is a large laser-based inertial confinement fusion (ICF) research device, located at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California. NIF uses lasers to heat and compress a small amount of hydrogen fuel with the goal of inducing nuclear fusion reactions. NIF's mission is to achieve fusion ignition with high energy gain, and to support nuclear weapon maintenance and design by studying the behavior of matter under the conditions found within nuclear weapons.\\"About NIF & Photon Science\\", Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory NIF is the largest and most energetic ICF device built to date, and the largest laser in the world. The basic concept of all ICF devices is to rapidly collapse a small amount of fuel so the pressure and temperature reach fusion-relevant conditions. NIF does this by heating the outer layer of a small plastic sphere with the world's most powerful laser. The energy from the laser is so intense that it causes the plastic to explode, squeezing down on the fuel inside. The speed of this process is enormous, with the fuel reaching a peak around 350 km/s, raising the density from about that of water to about 100 times that of lead. The delivery of energy and the adiabatic process during collapse raises the temperature of the fuel to hundreds of millions of degrees. At these temperatures, fusion processes occur very rapidly, before the energy generated in the fuel causes it to explode outward as well. Construction on the NIF began in 1997 but management problems and technical delays slowed progress into the early 2000s. Progress after 2000 was smoother, but compared to initial estimates, NIF was completed five years behind schedule and was almost four times more expensive than originally budgeted. Construction was certified complete on 31 March 2009 by the U.S. Department of Energy, and a dedication ceremony took place on 29 May 2009. The first large-scale laser target experiments were performed in June 2009 and the first \\"integrated ignition experiments\\" (which tested the laser's power) were declared completed in October 2010. Bringing the system to its full potential was a lengthy process that was carried out from 2009 to 2012. During this period a number of experiments were worked into the process under the National Ignition Campaign, with the goal of reaching ignition just after the laser reached full power, some time in the second half of 2012. The Campaign officially ended in September 2012, at about the conditions needed for ignition. Experiments since then have pushed this closer to , but considerable theoretical and practical work is required if the system is ever to reach ignition. Since 2012, NIF has been used primarily for materials science and weapons research. Description =ICF basics= Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) devices use drivers to rapidly heat the outer layers of a target in order to compress it. The target is a small spherical pellet containing a few milligrams of fusion fuel, typically a mix of deuterium (D) and tritium (T). The energy of the laser heats the surface of the pellet into a plasma, which explodes off the surface. The remaining portion of the target is driven inward, eventually compressing it into a small point of extremely high density. The rapid blowoff also creates a shock wave that travels toward the center of the compressed fuel from all sides. When it reaches the center of the fuel, a small volume is further heated and compressed to a greater degree. When the temperature and density of that small spot are raised high enough, fusion reactions occur and release energy.\\"How NIF works\\" , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Retrieved on October 2, 2007. The fusion reactions release high-energy particles, some of which, primarily alpha particles, collide with the surrounding high density fuel and heat it further. If this process deposits enough energy in a given area it can cause that fuel to undergo fusion as well. However, the fuel is also losing heat through x-ray losses and hot electrons leaving the fuel area, so the rate of alpha heating must be greater than these losses, a condition known as bootstrapping. Given the right overall conditions of the compressed fuel‚Äîhigh enough density and temperature‚Äîthis bootstrapping process will result in a chain reaction, burning outward from the center where the shock wave started the reaction. This is a condition known as ignition, which will lead to a significant portion of the fuel in the target undergoing fusion and releasing large amounts of energy. To date most ICF experiments have used lasers to heat the target. Calculations show that the energy must be delivered quickly in order to compress the core before it disassembles. The laser energy also must be focused extremely evenly across the target's outer surface in order to collapse the fuel into a symmetric core. Although other drivers have been suggested, notably heavy ions driven in particle accelerators, lasers are currently the only devices with the right combination of features.Per F.

The design uses 192 beamlines in a parallel system of flashlamp-pumped, neodymium-doped phosphate glass lasers. To ensure that the output of the beamlines is uniform, the initial laser light is amplified from a single source in the Injection Laser System (ILS). This starts with a low-power flash of 1053-nanometer (nm) infra-red light generated in an ytterbium-doped optical fiber laser known as the Master Oscillator.P.J. Wisoff et al., NIF Injection Laser System, Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 5341, pages 146‚Äì155 The light from the Master Oscillator is split and directed into 48 Preamplifier Modules (PAMs). Each PAM contains a two-stage amplification process. The first stage is a regenerative amplifier in which the pulse circulates 30 to 60 times, increasing in energy from nanojoules to tens of millijoules. The light then passes four times through a circuit containing a neodymium glass amplifier similar to (but much smaller than) the ones used in the main beamlines, boosting the nanojoules of light created in the Master Oscillator to about 6 joules. According to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), the design of the PAMs was one of the major challenges during construction. Improvements to the design since then have allowed them to surpass their initial design goals.Keeping Laser Development on Target for the NIF , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Retrieved on October 2, 2007 optical switch, and on the right is the final spatial filter, switchyard and optical frequency converter. The main amplification takes place in a series of glass amplifiers located at one end of the beamlines. Before firing, the amplifiers are first optically pumped by a total of 7,680 xenon flash lamps (the PAMs have their own smaller flash lamps as well). The lamps are powered by a capacitor bank which stores a total of 422 MJ (117 kWh) of electrical energy. When the wavefront passes through them, the amplifiers release some of the light energy stored in them into the beam. To improve the energy transfer the beams are sent through the main amplifier section four times, using an optical switch located in a mirrored cavity. In total these amplifiers boost the original 6 J provided by the PAMs to a nominal 4 MJ. Given the time scale of a few billionths of a second, the peak UV power delivered to the target is correspondingly very high, 500 TW. Near the center of each beamline, and taking up the majority of the total length, are spatial filters. These consist of long tubes with small telescopes at the end that focus the laser beam down to a tiny point in the center of the tube, where a mask cuts off any stray light outside the focal point. The filters ensure that the image of the beam when it reaches the target is extremely uniform, removing any light that was misfocused by imperfections in the optics upstream. Spatial filters were a major step forward in ICF work when they were introduced in the Cyclops laser, an earlier LLNL experiment. The total length of the path the laser beam propagates from one end to the other, including switches, is about . The various optical elements in the beamlines are generally packaged into Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), standardized boxes about the size of a vending machine that can be dropped out of the beamline for replacement from below. After the amplification is complete the light is switched back into the beamline, where it runs to the far end of the building to the target chamber. The target chamber is a multi- piece steel sphere weighing . Just before reaching the target chamber, the light is reflected off various mirrors in the switchyard and target area in order to impinge on the target from different directions. Since the length of the overall path from the Master Oscillator to the target is different for each of the beamlines, optics are used to delay the light in order to ensure all of them reach the center within a few picoseconds of each other.Arnie Heller, Orchestrating the World's Most Powerful Laser , Science & Technology Review, July/August 2005. Retrieved on May 7, 2008 NIF normally directs the laser into the chamber from the top and bottom. The target area and switchyard system can be reconfigured by moving half of the 48 beamlines to alternate positions closer to the equator of the target chamber. NIF's basic layout. The laser pulse is generated in the room just right of center, and is sent into the beamlines (blue) on either side. After several passes through the beamlines the light is sent into the \\"switchyard\\" (red) where it is aimed into the target chamber (silver). One of the last steps in the process before reaching the target chamber is to convert the infrared (IR) light at 1053 nm into the ultraviolet (UV) at 351 nm in a device known as a frequency converter.P.J. Wegner et al.,NIF final optics system: frequency conversion and beam conditioning, Proceedings of SPIE 5341, May 2004, pages 180‚Äì189. These are made of thin sheets (about 1 cm thick) cut from a single crystal of potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When the 1053 nm (IR) light passes through the first of two of these sheets, frequency addition converts a large fraction of the light into 527 nm light (green). On passing through the second sheet, frequency combination converts much of the 527 nm light and the remaining 1053 nm light into 351 nm (UV) light. Infrared (IR) light is much less effective than UV at heating the targets, because IR couples more strongly with hot electrons which will absorb a considerable amount of energy and interfere with compression. The conversion process can reach peak efficiencies of about 80 percent for a laser pulse that has a flat temporal shape, but the temporal shape needed for ignition varies significantly over the duration of the pulse. The actual conversion process is about 50 percent efficient, reducing delivered energy to a nominal 1.8 MJ.Bibeau, Camille; Paul J. Wegner, Ruth Hawley-Fedder (June 1, 2006). \\"UV SOURCES: World‚Äôs largest laser to generate powerful ultraviolet beams\\". Laser Focus World. Retrieved on May 7, 2008. One important aspect of any ICF research project is ensuring that experiments can actually be carried out on a timely basis. Previous devices generally had to cool down for many hours to allow the flashlamps and laser glass to regain their shapes after firing (due to thermal expansion), limiting use to one or fewer firings a day. One of the goals for NIF is to reduce this time to less than four hours, in order to allow 700 firings a year.NIF Project Sets Record for Laser Performance , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, June 5, 2003. Retrieved on May 7, 2008. =NIF and ICF= Sankey diagram of the laser energy to hohlraum x-ray to target capsule energy coupling efficiency. Note the \\"laser energy\\" is after conversion to UV, which loses about 50% of the original IR power. The conversion of x-ray heat to energy in the fuel loses another 90% - of the 1.9 MJ of laser light, only about 10 kJ ends up in the fuel itself. The name National Ignition Facility refers to the goal of igniting the fusion fuel, a long-sought threshold in fusion research. In existing (non-weapon) fusion experiments the heat produced by the fusion reactions rapidly escapes from the plasma, meaning that external heating must be applied continually in order to keep the reactions going. Ignition refers to the point at which the energy given off in the fusion reactions currently underway is high enough to sustain the temperature of the fuel against those losses. This causes a chain-reaction that allows the majority of the fuel to undergo a nuclear burn. Ignition is considered a key requirement if fusion power is to ever become practical. NIF is designed primarily to use the indirect drive method of operation, in which the laser heats a small metal cylinder instead of the capsule inside it. The heat causes the cylinder, known as a hohlraum (German for \\"hollow room\\", or cavity), to re-emit the energy as intense X-rays, which are more evenly distributed and symmetrical than the original laser beams. Experimental systems, including the OMEGA and Nova lasers, validated this approach through the late 1980s.J.D. Lindl et al., The physics basis for ignition using indirect-drive targets on the National Ignition Facility, Physics of Plasmas, Vol. 11, February 2004, page 339. Retrieved on May 7, 2008. In the case of the NIF, the large delivered power allows for the use of a much larger target; the baseline pellet design is about 2 mm in diameter, chilled to about 18 kelvins (‚àí255 ¬∞C) and lined with a layer of frozen DT fuel. The hollow interior also contains a small amount of DT gas. In a typical experiment, the laser will generate 3 MJ of infrared laser energy of a possible 4. About 1.5 MJ of this is left after conversion to UV, and about 15 percent of this is lost in the x-ray conversion in the hohlraum. About 15 percent of the resulting x-rays, about 150 kJ, will be absorbed by the outer layers of the target.Suter, L.; J. Rothenberg, D. Munro, et al., \\"Feasibility of High Yield/High Gain NIF Capsules\\", Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, December 6, 1999. Retrieved on May 7, 2008. The coupling between the capsule and the x-rays is lossy, and ultimately only about 10 to 14 kJ of energy is deposited in the fuel itself. The resulting inward directed compression is expected to compress the fuel in the center of the target to a density of about 1,000 g/cm3 (or 1,000,000 kg/m3);Lindl, John, \\"NIF Ignition Physics Program\\". Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, September 24, 2005. Retrieved on May 7, 2008. for comparison, lead has a normal density of about 11 g/cm3 (11,340 kg/m3). The pressure is the equivalent of 300 billion atmospheres. Based on simulations, it was expected this would produce about 20 MJ of fusion energy to be released, resulting in a net fusion energy gain of about 15 (G=Fusion energy/UV laser energy). Improvements in both the laser system and hohlraum design are expected to improve the energy absorbed by the capsule to about 420 kJ (and thus perhaps 40 to 50 in the fuel itself), which, in turn, could generate up to 100-150 MJ of fusion energy. However, the baseline design allows for a maximum of about 45 MJ of fusion energy release, due to the design of the target chamber.M. Tobin et all, Target Area Design Basis and System Performance for NIF, American Nuclear Society, June 1994. Retrieved on May 7, 2008. This is the equivalent of about 11 kg of TNT exploding. These output energies are still less than the 422 MJ of input energy required to charge the system's capacitors that power the laser amplifiers. The net wall-plug efficiency of NIF (UV laser energy out divided by the energy required to pump the lasers from an external source) would be less than one percent, and the total wall-to-fusion efficiency is under 10% at its maximum performance. An economical fusion reactor would require that the fusion output be at least an order of magnitude more than this input. Commercial laser fusion systems would use the much more efficient diode-pumped solid state lasers, where wall-plug efficiencies of 10 percent have been demonstrated, and efficiencies 16-18 percent are expected with advanced concepts under development.

The capsule is held in the hohlraum using thin plastic webbing. =Other concepts= NIF is also exploring new types of targets. Previous experiments generally used plastic ablators, typically polystyrene (CH). NIF's targets also are constructed by coating a plastic form with a layer of sputtered beryllium or beryllium-copper alloys, and then oxidizing the plastic out of the center.Meeting the Target Challenge , Science & Technology Review, July/August 2007. Retrieved on May 7, 2008. In comparison to traditional plastic targets, beryllium targets offer higher overall implosion efficiencies for the indirect-drive mode where the incoming energy is in the form of x-rays. Although NIF was primarily designed as an indirect drive device, the energy in the laser is high enough to be used as a direct drive system as well, where the laser shines directly on the target. Even at UV wavelengths the power delivered by NIF is estimated to be more than enough to cause ignition, resulting in fusion energy gains of about 40 times,S. V. Weber et all, Hydrodynamic Stability of NIF Direct Drive Capsules, MIXED session, November 08. Retrieved on May 7, 2008. somewhat higher than the indirect drive system. A more uniform beam layout suitable for direct drive experiments can be arranged through changes in the switchyard that move half of the beamlines to locations closer to the middle of the target chamber. It has been shown, using scaled implosions on the OMEGA laser and computer simulations, that NIF should also be capable of igniting a capsule using the so-called polar direct drive (PDD) configuration where the target is irradiated directly by the laser, but only from the top and bottom, with no changes to the NIF beamline layout.Yaakobi, B.; R.

Retrieved on May 7, 2008 In this configuration the target suffers either a \\"pancake\\" or \\"cigar\\" anisotropy on implosion, reducing the maximum temperature at the core. Other targets, called saturn targets, are specifically designed to reduce the anisotropy and improve the implosion.True, M. A.; J. R. Albritton, and E. A. Williams, \\"The Saturn Target for Polar Direct Drive on the National Ignition Facility, LLE Review, Vol. 102, January‚ÄìMarch 2005, pp. 61‚Äì6. Retrieved on May 7, 2008. They feature a small plastic ring around the \\"equator\\" of the target, which quickly vaporizes into a plasma when hit by the laser. Some of the laser light is refracted through this plasma back towards the equator of the target, evening out the heating. Ignition with gains of just over thirty-five times are thought to be possible using these targets at NIF, producing results almost as good as the fully symmetric direct drive approach. History =Impetus= Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (LLNL) history with the ICF program starts with physicist John Nuckolls, who started considering the problem after a 1957 meeting on the peaceful use of nuclear weapons arranged by Edward Teller at LLNL. During these meetings, the idea later known as PACER first developed. PACER envisioned the explosion of small hydrogen bombs in large caverns to generate steam that would be converted into electrical power. After identifying several problems with this approach, Nuckolls became interested in understanding how small a bomb could be made that would still generate net positive power. There are two parts to a typical hydrogen bomb, a plutonium- based fission bomb known as the primary, and a cylindrical arrangement of fusion fuels known as the secondary. The primary releases significant amounts of x-rays, which are trapped within the bomb casing and heat and compress the secondary until it undergoes ignition. The secondary consists of lithium deuteride fuel, which requires an external neutron source to begin the reaction. This is normally in the form of a small plutonium \\"spark plug\\" in the center of the fuel. Nuckolls's idea was to explore how small the secondary could be made, and what effects this would have on the energy needed from the primary to cause ignition. The simplest change is to replace the LiD fuel with D-T gas, removing the need for the spark plug. At that point there is no theoretical smallest size - as the secondary got smaller, so did the amount of energy needed to reach ignition. At the milligram level, the energy levels started to approach those available through several known devices.John Nuckolls, \\"Early Steps Toward Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE)\\", LLNL, 12 June 1998 By the early 1960s, Nuckolls and several other weapons designers had developed the outlines of the ICF approach. The D-T fuel would be placed in a small capsule, designed to rapidly ablate when heated and thereby maximize compression and shock wave formation. This capsule would be placed within an engineered shell, the hohlraum, which acted similar to the bomb casing. However, the hohlraum did not have to be heated by x-rays; any source of energy could be used as long as it delivered enough energy to cause the hohlraum itself to heat up and start giving off x-rays. Ideally the energy source would be located some distance away, to mechanically isolate both ends of the reaction. A small atomic bomb could be used as the energy source, as it is in a hydrogen bomb, but ideally smaller energy sources would be used. Using computer simulations, the teams estimated that about 5 MJ of energy would be needed from the primary, generating a 1 MJ beam. To put this in perspective, a small fission primary of 0.5 kt releases 2 million MJ in total.\\"Convert kilotons, to megajoules\\", Unit JugglerNuckolls et al., Laser Compression of Matter to Super-High Densities: Thermonuclear (CTR) Applications, Nature Vol. 239, 1972, p. 129John Lindl, The Edward Teller Medal Lecture: The Evolution Toward Indirect Drive and Two Decades of Progress Toward ICF Ignition and Burn, 11th International Workshop on Laser Interaction and Related Plasma Phenomena, December 1994. Retrieved on May 7, 2008. =ICF program begins= While Nuckolls and LLNL were working on hohlraum-based concepts, former weapon designer Ray Kidder was working on the direct drive concept, using a large number of laser beams to evenly heat the target capsule. In the early 1970s, Kidder formed KMS Fusion to directly commercialize this concept. This sparked off intense rivalry between Kidder and the weapons labs. Formerly ignored, ICF was now a hot topic and most of the labs soon started ICF efforts of their own. LLNL decided early on to concentrate on glass lasers, while other facilities studied gas lasers using carbon dioxide (e.g. ANTARES, Los Alamos National Laboratory) or KrF (e.g. Nike laser, Naval Research Laboratory). Throughout these early stages of development, much of the understanding of the fusion process was the result of computer simulations, primarily LASNEX. LASNEX greatly simplified the reaction to a 2-dimensional simulation, which was all that was possible given the amount of computing power at the time. According to LASNEX, laser drivers in the kJ range would have the required properties to reach low gain, which was just within the state of the art. This led to the Shiva laser project which was completed in 1977. Contrary to predictions, Shiva fell far short of its goals, and the densities reached were thousands of times smaller than predicted. This was traced to issues with the way the laser delivered heat to the target, which delivered most of its energy to electrons rather than the entire fuel mass. Further experiments and simulations demonstrated that this process could be dramatically improved by using shorter wavelengths of laser light. Further upgrades to the simulation programs, accounting for these effects, predicted a new design that would reach ignition. This new system emerged as the 20-beam 200 kJ Nova laser concept. During the initial construction phase, Nuckolls found an error in his calculations, and an October 1979 review chaired by John Foster Jr. of TRW confirmed that there was no way Nova would reach ignition. The Nova design was then modified into a smaller 10-beam design that added frequency conversion to 351 nm light, which would increase coupling efficiency. In operation, Nova was able to deliver about 30 kJ of UV laser energy, about half of what was initially expected, primarily due to limits set by optical damage to the final focusing optics. Even at those levels, it was clear that the predictions for fusion production were still wrong; even at the limited powers available, fusion yields were far below predictions. =Halite and Centurion= With each experiment, the predicted energy needed to reach ignition rose, and it was not clear that post-Nova predictions were any more accurate than earlier ones. The Department of Energy (DOE) decided that direct experimentation was the best way to settle the issue, and in 1978 they started a series of underground experiments at the Nevada Test Site that used small nuclear bombs to illuminate ICF targets. The tests were known as Halite or Centurion depending on which lab ran it, LLNL or LANL. Each test was able to simultaneously illuminate many targets, allowing them to test the amount of x-ray energy needed by placing the targets at different distances from the bomb. Another question was how large the fuel assembly had to be in order for the fuel to self-heat from the fusion reactions and thus reach ignition. Initial data were available by mid-1984, and the testing ceased in 1988. Ignition was achieved for the first time during these tests, but the amount of energy and the size of the fuel targets needed to reach ignition was far higher than predicted. During this same period, experiments began on Nova using similar targets to understand their behaviour under laser illumination, allowing direct comparison against the results obtained from the bomb tests.John Lindl, \\"A strategy for determining the driver requirements for high gain ICF implosions utilizing hydrodynamically equivalent capsules on Nova laser\\", Laser Annual Program Report, 1981, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, Livermore, CA, UCRL-50055-80/81, pp.2-29-2-57 (unpublished) Data from the tests suggested that about 10 MJ of x-ray energy would be needed to reach ignition.\\"Laser advance amid pros and con(fusion)s of DOE fusion path\\", Free Online Library, 1988John Lindl, Rober McCrory and Michael Campbell, \\"Progress Toward Ignition and Burn Propagation in Inertial Confinement Fusion\\", Physics Today, September 1992, pp. 32-40.Phillip Schewe and Ben Stein, \\"Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) Article Announcement\\", Physics News, 25 October 1995 If this energy is supplied by an IR laser to a hohlraum, as in Nova or NIF, this corresponds to an original laser energy on the order of 100 MJ, well beyond the reach of existing technologies. A great debate broke out in the ICF establishment as a result. One group suggested that they attempt to build a laser of this power; Leonardo Mascheroni and Claude Phipps designed a new type of hydrogen fluoride laser that was pumped by high-energy electrons that would be able to reach the 100 MJ limit. Others used the same data and new versions of their computer simulations based on these experiments that suggested that careful shaping of the laser pulse and using more beams spread more evenly showed that ignition and net energy gains could be achieved with a laser between 5 and 10 MJ.John Lindl, Development of the Indirect-Drive Approach to Inertial Confinement Fusion and the Target Physics Basis for Ignition and Gain, Physics of Plasmas Vol. 2, No. 11, November 1995; pp. 3933‚Äì4024 These results prompted the DOE to request a custom military ICF facility they called the \\"Laboratory Microfusion Facility\\" (LMF). LMF would use a driver on the order of 10 MJ, delivering fusion yields of between 100 and 1,000 MJ. A 1989/90 review of this concept by the National Academy of Sciences suggested that the LMF was too large a step to make at once, and that fundamental physics issues still needed to be explored. They recommended further experiments before attempting to move to a 10 MJ system. Nevertheless, the authors were aware of the potential for higher energy requirements, and noted \\"Indeed, if it did turn out that a 100 MJ driver were required for ignition and gain, one would have to rethink the entire approach to, and rationale for, ICF\\".Review of the Department of Energy's Inertial Confinement Fusion Program, Final Report, National Academy of Sciences =LMF and Nova Upgrade= Building the LMF was estimated to cost about $1 billion.Nova Upgrade - A Proposed ICF Facility to Demonstrate Ignition and Gain, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ICF Program, July 1992 LLNL initially submitted a design with a 5 MJ 350 nm (UV) driver laser that would be able to reach about 200 MJ yield, which was enough to attain the majority of the LMF goals. The program was estimated to cost about $600 million FY 1989 dollars, and an additional $250 million to upgrade it to a full 1,000 MJ if needed, and would grow to well over $1 billion if LMF was to meet all of the goals requested by the DOE. Other labs also proposed their own LMF designs using other technologies. The National Academy of Sciences review led to a reevaluation of these plans, and in July 1990, LLNL responded with the Nova Upgrade, which would reuse the majority of the existing Nova facility, along with the adjacent Shiva facility. The resulting system would be much lower power than the LMF concept, with a driver of about 1 MJ.Tobin, M.T et all, Target area for Nova Upgrade: containing ignition and beyond, Fusion Engineering, 1991, pg. 650‚Äì655. Retrieved on May 7, 2008. The new design included a number of features that advanced the state of the art in the driver section, including the multi-pass design in the main amplifiers, and 18 beamlines (up from 10) that were split into 288 \\"beamlets\\" as they entered the target area in order to improve the uniformity of illumination. The plans called for the installation of two main banks of laser beamlines, one in the existing Nova beamline room, and the other in the older Shiva building next door, extending through its laser bay and target area into an upgraded Nova target area. The lasers would deliver about 500 TW in a 4 ns pulse. The upgrades were expected to allow the new Nova to produce fusion yields of between 2 and 10 MJ. The initial estimates from 1992 estimated construction costs around $400 million, with construction taking place from 1995 to 1999. =NIF emerges= Throughout this period, the ending of the Cold War led to dramatic changes in defense funding and priorities. As the need for nuclear weapons was greatly reduced and various arms limitation agreements led to a reduction in warhead count, the US was faced with the prospect of losing a generation of nuclear weapon designers able to maintain the existing stockpiles, or design new weapons.William Broad, Vast Laser Plan Would Further Fusion and Keep Bomb Experts, New York Times, June 21, 1994. Retrieved on May 7, 2008. At the same time, progress was being made on what would become the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which would ban all criticality testing. This would make the reliable development of newer generations of nuclear weapons much more difficult. United States uses at any instant in time. Out of these changes came the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program (SSMP), which, among other things, included funds for the development of methods to design and build nuclear weapons that would work without having to be explosively tested. In a series of meetings that started in 1995, an agreement formed between the labs to divide up the SSMP efforts. An important part of this would be confirmation of computer models using low-yield ICF experiments. The Nova Upgrade was too small to use for these experiments,Letter from Charles Curtis, Undersecretary of Energy, June 15, 1995 and a redesign emerged as NIF in 1994. The estimated cost of the project remained just over $1 billion,1.9 Cost (NIF CDR, Chapter 9) with completion in 2002. In spite of the agreement, the large project cost combined with the ending of similar projects at other labs resulted in several highly critical comments by scientists at other weapons labs, Sandia National Laboratories in particular. In May 1997, Sandia fusion scientist Rick Spielman publicly stated that NIF had \\"virtually no internal peer review on the technical issues\\" and that \\"Livermore essentially picked the panel to review themselves\\".\\"Livermore's costly fusion laser won't fly, scientists say\\", Albuquerque Tribune, May 29, 1997, p. 1 A retired Sandia manager, Bob Puerifoy, was even more blunt than Spielman: \\"NIF is worthless ... it can't be used to maintain the stockpile, period\\".L. Spohn, \\"NIF opponents to cite criticism of laser in court battle\\", Albuquerque Tribune, June 13, 1997, p. A15. A contrasting view was expressed by Victor Reis, assistant secretary for Defense Programs within DOE and the chief architect of the Stockpile Stewardship Program. Reis told the U.S. House Armed Services Committee in 1997 that NIF was \\"designed to produce, for the first time in a laboratory setting, conditions of temperature and density of matter close to those that occur in the detonation of nuclear weapons. The ability to study the behavior of matter and the transfer of energy and radiation under these conditions is key to understanding the basic physics of nuclear weapons and predicting their performance without underground nuclear testing.Statement of Dr. Victor Reis, Assistant Secretary for Defense Programs, Department of Energy, before the Senate Armed Services Committee, March 19, 1997 (retrieved July 13, 2012 from http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/pa/Director/reisSASC97.html ) Two JASON panels, which are composed of scientific and technical national security experts, have stated that the NIF is the most scientifically valuable of all programs proposed for science-based stockpile stewardship.Statement of Federico Pe√±a, Secretary, US Dept of Energy, before the Committee on Armed Services, United States Senate, March 26, 1998 (retrieved July 13, 2012 from ) Despite the initial criticism, Sandia, as well as Los Alamos, provided support in the development of many NIF technologies, and both laboratories later became partners with NIF in the National Ignition Campaign. =Constructing NIF= The Beamlet laser tested the design and techniques that would be used on NIF. The NIF target chamber was so large it had to be built in sections. Work on the NIF started with a single beamline demonstrator, Beamlet. Beamlet operated between 1994 and 1997 and was entirely successful. It was then sent to Sandia National Laboratories as a light source in their Z machine. A full-sized demonstrator then followed, in AMPLAB, which started operations in 1997.J. A. Horvath, Assembly and Maintenance of Full Scale NIF Amplifiers in the Amplifier Module Prototype Laboratory (AMPLAB), Third Annual International Conference on Solid State Lasers for Application (SSLA) to Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF), July 16, 1998 The official groundbreaking on the main NIF site was on May 29, 1997. At the time, the DOE was estimating that the NIF would cost approximately $1.1 billion and another $1 billion for related research, and would be complete as early as 2002.NATIONAL IGNITION FACILITY, Management and Oversight Failures Caused Major Cost Overruns and Schedule Delays, GAO, August 2000 Later in 1997 the DOE approved an additional $100 million in funding and pushed the operational date back to 2004. As late as 1998 LLNL's public documents stated the overall price was $1.2 billion, with the first eight lasers coming online in 2001 and full completion in 2003.Howard T. Powell and Richard H. Sawicki, Keeping Laser Development on Target for the National Ignition Facility, S&TR;, March 1998. Retrieved on May 7, 2008. The physical scale of the facility alone made the construction project challenging. By the time the \\"conventional facility\\" (the shell for the laser) was complete in 2001, more than 210,000 cubic yards of soil had been excavated, more than 73,000 cubic yards of concrete had been poured, 7,600 tons of reinforcing steel rebar had been placed, and more than 5,000 tons of structural steel had been erected. In addition to its sheer size, building NIF presented a number of unique challenges. To isolate the laser system from vibration, the foundation of each laser bay was made independent of the rest of the structure. Three-foot-thick, 420-foot-long and 80-foot-wide slabs, each containing 3,800 cubic yards of concrete, required continuous concrete pours to achieve their specifications. There were also unexpected challenges to cope with: In November, 1997, an El Ni√±o weather front dumped two inches of rain in two hours, flooding the NIF site with 200,000 gallons of water just three days before the scheduled concrete foundation pour. The earth was so soaked that the framing for the retaining wall sank six inches, forcing the crew to disassemble and reassemble it in order to pour the concrete. Construction was halted in December, 1997, when 16,000-year-old mammoth bones were discovered on the construction site. Paleontologists were called in to remove and preserve the bones, and construction restarted within four days. A variety of research and development, technology and engineering challenges also had to be overcome, such as working with the optics industry to create a precision large optics fabrication capability to supply the laser glass for NIF's 7,500 meter-sized optics. State-of-the-art optics measurement, coating and finishing techniques were needed to withstand NIF's high-energy lasers, as were methods for amplifying the laser beams to the needed energy levels. Continuous-pour glass, rapid-growth crystals, innovative optical switches, and deformable mirrors were among the technology innovations developed for NIF. Sandia, with extensive experience in pulsed power delivery, designed the capacitor banks used to feed the flashlamps, completing the first unit in October 1998. To everyone's surprise, the Pulsed Power Conditioning Modules (PCMs) suffered capacitor failures that led to explosions. This required a redesign of the module to contain the debris, but since the concrete structure of the buildings holding them had already been poured, this left the new modules so tightly packed that there was no way to do maintenance in-place. Yet another redesign followed, this time allowing the modules to be removed from the bays for servicing. Continuing problems of this sort further delayed the operational start of the project, and in September 1999, an updated DOE report stated that NIF would require up to $350 million more and completion would be pushed back to 2006. =Re-baseline and GAO report= Bill Richardson began a review process that brought NIF construction back under control. Throughout this period the problems with NIF were not being reported up the management chain. In 1999 then Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson reported to Congress that the NIF project was on time and budget, following the information that had been passed onto him by NIF's management. In August that year it was revealed that NIF management had misled Richardson, and in fact neither claim was close to the truth.James Glanz, Laser Project Is Delayed and Over Budget, New York Times, August 19, 2000. Retrieved on May 7, 2008. As the GAO would later note, \\"Furthermore, the Laboratory's former laser director, who oversaw NIF and all other laser activities, assured Laboratory managers, DOE, the university, and the Congress that the NIF project was adequately funded and staffed and was continuing on cost and schedule, even while he was briefed on clear and growing evidence that NIF had serious problems\\". Richardson later commented \\"I have been very concerned about the management of this facility... bad management has overtaken good science. I don't want this to ever happen again\\". A DOE Task Force reporting to Richardson late in January 2000 summarized that \\"organizations of the NIF project failed to implement program and project management procedures and processes commensurate with a major research and development project... [and that] ...no one gets a passing grade on NIF Management: not the DOE's office of Defense Programs, not the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and not the University of California\\".Interim Report of the National Ignition Facility Laser System Task Force, Secretary of Energy Advisory Board, January 10, 2000. Retrieved on May 7, 2008. Given the budget problems, the US Congress requested an independent review by the General Accounting Office (GAO). They returned a highly critical report in August 2000 stating that the budget was likely $3.9 billion, including R&D;, and that the facility was unlikely to be completed anywhere near on time.GAO Report Cites New NIF Cost Estimate, FYI, American Institute of Physics, Number 101: August 30, 2000.

The report, \\"Management and Oversight Failures Caused Major Cost Overruns and Schedule Delays,\\" identified management problems for the overruns, and also criticized the program for failing to include a considerable amount of money dedicated to target fabrication in the budget, including it in operational costs instead of development. Early technical delays and project management issues caused the DOE to begin a comprehensive \\"Rebaseline Validation Review of the National Ignition Facility Project\\" in 2000, which took a critical look at the project, identifying areas of concern and adjusting the schedule and budget to ensure completion. John Gordon, National Nuclear Security Administrator, stated \\"We have prepared a detailed bottom-up cost and schedule to complete the NIF project...

Ed Moses, former head of the Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation (AVLIS) program at LLNL, became NIF project manager. Since the rebaselining, NIF's management has received many positive reviews and the project has met the budgets and schedules approved by Congress. In October 2010, the project was named \\"Project of the Year\\" by the Project Management Institute, which cited NIF as a \\"stellar example of how properly applied project management excellence can bring together global teams to deliver a project of this scale and importance efficiently.\\" Recent reviews of the project have been positive, generally in keeping with the post-GAO Rebaseline schedules and budgets. However, there were lingering concerns about the NIF's ability to reach ignition, at least in the short term. An independent review by the JASON Defense Advisory Group was generally positive about NIF's prospects over the long term, but concluded that \\"The scientific and technical challenges in such a complex activity suggest that success in the early attempts at ignition in 2010, while possible, is unlikely\\".NIF Ignition, JASON Program, June 29, 2005 The group suggested a number of changes to the completion timeline to bring NIF to its full design power as soon as possible, skipping over a testing period at lower powers that they felt had little value. =Early tests and construction completion = In May 2003, the NIF achieved \\"first light\\" on a bundle of four beams, producing a 10.4 kJ pulse of IR light in a single beamline. In 2005 the first eight beams (a full bundle) were fired producing 153 kJ of infrared light, thus eclipsing OMEGA as the highest energy laser (per pulse) on the planet. By January 2007 all of the LRUs in the Master Oscillator Room (MOOR) were complete and the computer room had been installed. By August 2007 96 laser lines were completed and commissioned, and \\"A total infrared energy of more than 2.5 megajoules has now been fired. This is more than 40 times what the Nova laser typically operated at the time it was the world's largest laser\\".World's largest laser picks up the pace , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, November 21, 2007. Retrieved on May 7, 2008. On January 26, 2009, the final line replaceable unit (LRU) was installed, completing one of the final major milestones of the NIF construction project and meaning that construction was unofficially completed. On February 26, 2009, for the first time NIF fired all 192 laser beams into the target chamber. On March 10, 2009, NIF became the first laser to break the megajoule barrier, firing all 192 beams and delivering 1.1 MJ of ultraviolet light, known as 3œâ, to the target chamber center in a shaped ignition pulse. The main laser delivered 1.952 MJ of infrared energy. Operations On 29 May 2009 the NIF was dedicated in a ceremony attended by thousands, including California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Senator Dianne Feinstein. The first laser shots into a hohlraum target were fired in late June 2009. =Buildup to main experiments= On January 28, 2010, the facility published a paper reporting the delivery of a 669 kJ pulse to a gold hohlraum, setting new records for power delivery by a laser, and leading to analysis suggesting that suspected interference by generated plasma would not be a problem in igniting a fusion reaction. Due to the size of the test hohlraums, laser/plasma interactions produced plasma-optics gratings, acting like tiny prisms, which produced symmetric X-ray drive on the capsule inside the hohlraum. After gradually altering the wavelength of the laser, scientists were able to compress a spherical capsule evenly and heat it up to 3.3 million kelvins (285 eV). The capsule contained cryogenically cooled gas, acting as a substitute for the deuterium and tritium fuel capsules that will be used later on. Plasma Physics Group Leader Dr. Siegfried Glenzer said they've shown they can maintain the precise fuel layers needed in the lab, but not yet within the laser system. As of January 2010, the NIF could run as high as 1.8 megajoules. Glenzer said that experiments with slightly larger hohlraums containing fusion-ready fuel pellets would begin before May 2010, slowly ramping up to 1.2 megajoules‚Äîenough for ignition according to calculations. But first the target chamber needed to be equipped with shields to block neutrons that a fusion reaction would produce. On June 5, 2010 the NIF team fired lasers at the target chamber for the first time in six months; realignment of the beams took place later in June in preparation for further high-energy operation. =National Ignition Campaign= Technician works on target positioner inside National Ignition Facility (NIF) target chamber. With the main construction complete, NIF started working on the \\"National Ignition Campaign\\" (NIC), the quest to reach ignition. By this time, so sure were the experimenters that ignition would be reached that articles began appearing in science magazines stating that it would be announced only a short time after the article was published. Scientific American started a 2010 review article with the statement \\"Ignition is close now. Within a year or two...\\" The first test was carried out on 8 October 2010 at slightly over 1 MJ. However, a number of problems slowed the drive toward ignition-level laser energies in the 1.4 to 1.5 MJ range. Progress was initially slowed by the potential for damage from overheating due to a concentration of energy on optical components that is greater than anything previously attempted. Other issues included problems layering the fuel inside the targets, and minute quantities of dust being found on the capsule surface.David Kramer, \\"NIF overcomes some problems, receives mixed review from its DOE overseer\\", Physics Today, 21 April 2011 As the power was increased and targets of increasing sophistication were used, another problem appeared that was causing an asymmetric implosion. This was eventually traced to minute amounts of water vapor in the target chamber which froze to the windows on the ends of the hohlraums. This was solved by re- designing the hohlraum with two layers of glass on either end, in effect creating a storm window. Steven Koonin, DOE undersecretary for science, visited the lab for an update on the NIC on 23 April, the day after the window problem was announced as solved. On 10 March he had described the NIC as \\"a goal of overriding importance for the DOE\\" and expressed that progress to date \\"was not as rapid as I had hoped\\". NIC shots halted in February 2011, as the machine was turned over to SSMP materials experiments. As these experiments wound down, a series of planned upgrades were carried out, notably a series of improved diagnostic and measurement instruments. Among these changes were the addition of the ARC (Advanced Radiographic Capability) system, which uses 4 of the NIF's 192 beams as a backlighting source for high-speed imaging of the implosion sequence. ARC is essentially a petawatt-class laser with peak power exceeding a quadrillion (1015) watts. It is designed to produce brighter, more penetrating, higher-energy x rays than can be obtained with conventional radiographic techniques. When complete, ARC will be the world's highest-energy short-pulse laser, capable of creating picosecond-duration laser pulses to produce energetic x rays in the range of 50-100 keV for backlighting NIF experiments. NIC runs restarted in May 2011 with the goal of timing the four laser shock waves that compress the fusion target to very high precision. The shots tested the symmetry of the X-ray drive during the first three nanoseconds. Full-system shots fired in the second half of May achieved unprecedented peak pressures of 50 megabars. In January 2012, Mike Dunne, director of NIF's laser fusion energy program, predicted in a Photonics West 2012 plenary talk that ignition would be achieved at NIF by October 2012. In the same month, the NIF fired a record high of 57 shots, more than in any month up to that point. On March 15, 2012, NIF produced a laser pulse with 411 trillion watts of peak power. On July 5, 2012, it produced a shorter pulse of 1.85 MJ and increased power of 500 TW. =DOE Report, July 19, 2012= The NIC campaign has been periodically reviewed by a team led by Steven E. Koonin, Under Secretary of Science. The 6th review, May 31, 2012 was chaired by David H. Crandall, Advisor on National Security and Inertial Fusion, Koonin being precluded to chair the review because of a conflict of interest. The review was conducted with the same external reviewers, who had previously served Koonin. Each provided their report independently, with their own estimate of the probability of achieving ignition within the plan, i.e. before December 31, 2012. The conclusion of the review was published on July 19, 2012. The previous review dated January 31, 2012, identified a number of experimental improvements that have been completed or are under way. The new report unanimously praised the quality of the installation: lasers, optics, targets, diagnostics, operations have all been outstanding, however: :The integrated conclusion based on this extensive period of experimentation, however, is that considerable hurdles must be overcome to reach ignition or the goal of observing unequivocal alpha heating. Indeed the reviewers note that given the unknowns with the present 'semi-empirical' approach, the probability of ignition before the end of December is extremely low and even the goal of demonstrating unambiguous alpha heating is challenging. (Crandall Memo 2012, p. 2) Further, the report members express deep concerns on the gaps between observed performance and ICF simulation codes such that the current codes are of a limited utility going forward. Specifically, they found a lack of predictive ability of the radiation drive to the capsule and inadequately modeled laser-plasma interactions. These effects lead to pressure being one half to one third of that required for ignition, far below the predicted values. The memo page 5 discusses the mix of ablator material and capsule fuel due likely to hydrodynamics instabilities in the outer surface of the ablator. The report goes on to suggest that using a thicker ablator may improve performance, but this increases its inertia. To keep the required implosion speed, they request that the NIF energy be increased to 2MJ. One must also keep in mind that neodymium lasers can withstand only a limited amount of energy or risk permanent damage to the optical quality of the lasing medium. The reviewers question whether or not the energy of NIF is sufficient to indirectly compress a large enough capsule to avoid the mix limit and reach ignition. The report concluded that ignition within the calendar year 2012 is 'highly unlikely'. =Ignition fails, focus shifts, LIFE ends= The NIF officially ended on September 30, 2012 without achieving ignition. According to numerous articles in the press, Congress was concerned about the project's progress and funding arguments may begin anew. These reports also suggested that NIF will shift its focus away from ignition back toward materials research. In 2008, as NIF was reaching completion, LLNL began the Laser Inertial Fusion Energy program, or LIFE, to explore ways to use the NIF technologies as the basis for a commercial power plant design. Early studies considered the fission-fusion hybrid concept, but from 2009 the focus was on pure fusion devices, incorporating a number of technologies that were being developed in parallel with NIF that would greatly improve the performance of the design. All of these, however, were based on the idea that NIF would achieve ignition, and that only minor changes to the basic design would be required to improve performance. In April 2014, Livermore decided to end the LIFE efforts. Bret Knapp, Livermore acting director was quoted as saying that \\"The focus of our inertial confinement fusion efforts is on understanding ignition on NIF rather than on the LIFE concept.\\" =Breakeven claims= A memo sent on 29 September 2013 by Ed Moses describes a fusion shot that took place at 5:15 a.m. on 28 September. It produced 5√ó1015 neutrons, 75% more than any previous shot. Alpha heating, a key component of ignition, was clearly seen. It also noted that the reaction released more energy than the \\"energy being absorbed by the fuel\\", a condition the memo referred to as \\"scientific breakeven\\". This received significant press coverage as it appeared to suggest a key threshold had been achieved, which was referred to as a \\"milestone\\". A number of researchers pointed out that the experiment was far below ignition, and did not represent a breakthrough as reported. Others noted that the definition of breakeven as recorded in many references, and directly stated by Moses in the past, was when the fusion output was equal to the laser input. In this release, the term was changed to refer only to the energy deposited in the fuel, not the energy of the laser as in previous statements. All of the upstream loss mechanisms were ignored, and the comparison was between the approximately 10 kJ that reaches the fuel and the 14 kJ that were produced, a Q of 1.4. Using the previous definition, this would be 1.8 MJ in and 14 kJ out, a Q of 0.008. The method used to reach these levels, known as the \\"high foot\\", is not suitable for general ignition, and as a result, it is still unclear whether NIF will ever reach this goal. Since 2013, improvements in controlling compression asymmetry have been made, with 1.9√ó1016 neutrons produced in 2018, resulting in 0.054 MJ of fusion energy released by 1.5 MJ laser pulse. =Stockpile experiments = Since 2013, NIF has shifted focus to materials studies. Experiments beginning in 2015 FY have used plutonium targets, with a schedule containing 10 to 12 shots for 2015, and as many as 120 over the next 10 years. Plutonium shots simulate the compression of the primary in a nuclear bomb by high explosives, which has not seen direct testing since the Comprehensive Test Ban. Tiny amounts of plutonium are used in these tests, ranging from less than a milligram to 10 milligrams. Similar experiments are also carried out on Sandia's Z machine. The director of LLNL's Primary Nuclear Design Program, Mike Dunning, noted that \\"This is an opportunity for us to get high-quality data using a regime that was previously unavailable to us\\". One key development on NIF since the Ignition Campaign has been an increase in the shot rate. Although designed to allow shots as often as every 4 hours, in 2014 FY NIF performed 191 shots, slightly more than one every two days. This has been continuously improved, and in April 2015 NIF was on track to meet its goal of 300 laser shots in 2015 FY, almost one a day. =MagLIF experiments= On 28 January 2016, NIF successfully executed its first gas pipe experiment intended to study the absorption of large amounts of laser light within long targets relevant to high-gain Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion (MagLIF). In order to investigate key aspects of the propagation, stability, and efficiency of laser energy coupling at full scale for high-gain MagLIF target designs, a single quad of NIF was used to deliver 30 kJ of energy to a target during a 13 nanosecond shaped pulse. Data return was very favorable and analysis is ongoing by scientific staff at Lawrence Livermore and Sandia National Laboratories.

The species has been recorded in Fernando de Noronha islands, and more rarely in mainland South America, as a vagrant. This is a stocky species with a short neck, short thick bill and buff-brown back. In summer, adults have long neck feathers. Its appearance is transformed in flight, when it looks very white due to the colour of the wings. The squacco heron's breeding habitat is marshy wetlands in warm countries. The birds nest in small colonies, often with other wading birds, usually on platforms of sticks in trees or shrubs. Three to four eggs are laid.

The object code is usually relocatable, and not usually directly executable. There are various formats for object files, and the same machine code can be packaged in different object file formats. An object file may also work like a shared library. In addition to the object code itself, object files may contain metadata used for linking or debugging, including: information to resolve symbolic cross- references between different modules, relocation information, stack unwinding information, comments, program symbols, debugging or profiling information. The term \\"object program\\" dates from at least the 1950s:  Object file formats  There are many different object file formats; originally each type of computer had its own unique format, but with the advent of Unix and other portable operating systems, some formats, such as COFF and ELF, have been defined and used on different kinds of systems. It is possible for the same file format to be used both as linker input and output, and thus as the library and executable file format. Some formats can contain machine code for different processors, with the correct one chosen by the operating system when the program is loaded. Some systems make a distinction between files which are directly executable and files which require processing by the linker. For example, OS/360 and successors call the first format a load module and the second an object module. In this case the files have entirely different formats. The design and/or choice of an object file format is a key part of overall system design. It affects the performance of the linker and thus programmer turnaround while a program is being developed. If the format is used for executables, the design also affects the time programs take to begin running, and thus the responsiveness for users. =Absolute object files= Many early computers, or small microcomputers, support only an absolute object format. Programs are not relocatable; they need to be assembled or compiled to execute at specific, predefined addresses. The file contains no relocation or linkage information. These files can be loaded into read/write memory, or stored in read-only memory. For example, the Motorola 6800 MIKBUG monitor contains a routine to read an absolute object file (SREC Format) from paper tape. DOS COM files are a more recent example of absolute object files. = Segmentation = Most object file formats are structured as separate sections of data, each section containing a certain type of data. These sections are known as \\"segments\\" due to the term \\"memory segment\\", which was previously a common form of memory management. When a program is loaded into memory by a loader, the loader allocates various regions of memory to the program. Some of these regions correspond to segments of the object file, and thus are usually known by the same names. Others, such as the stack, only exist at run time. In some cases, relocation is done by the loader (or linker) to specify the actual memory addresses. However, for many programs or architectures, relocation is not necessary, due to being handled by the memory management unit or by position-independent code. On some systems the segments of the object file can then be copied (paged) into memory and executed, without needing further processing. On these systems, this may be done lazily, that is, only when the segments are referenced during execution, for example via a memory-mapped file backed by the object file. Types of data supported by typical object file formats: * Header (descriptive and control information) * Code segment (\\"text segment\\", executable code) * Data segment (initialized static variables) * Read-only data segment (rodata, initialized static constants) * BSS segment (uninitialized static data, both variables and constants) * External definitions and references for linking * Relocation information * Dynamic linking information * Debugging information Segments in different object files may be combined by the linker according to rules specified when the segments are defined. Conventions exist for segments shared between object files; for instance, in DOS there are different memory models that specify the names of special segments and whether or not they may be combined. Debugging information may either be an integral part of the object file format, as in COFF, or a semi-independent format which may be used with several object formats, such as stabs or DWARF. The GNU Project's Binary File Descriptor library (BFD library) provides a common API for the manipulation of object files in a variety of formats.

Johnson and Thomas \\"Fats\\" Waller as the three greatest practitioners of the genre in its golden age, from about 1920 to 1943. Early life William Henry Joseph Bonaparte Bertholf was born in Goshen, New York. His mother and grandmother chose the names to reflect the different parts of his heritage: Joseph after Saint Joseph (Bible), Bonaparte (French), Bertholf (biological father's last name), Smith (added when he was three, his stepfather's name), and William and Henry which were added for \\"spiritual balance\\". In his memoir he reports that his father, Frank Bertholf (incorrectly spelled Bertholoff in many sources), was Jewish. Smith's New York birth record shows him as William H. Bertholf,New York State Birth Index, 1881-1942, accessed on Ancestry.com 4/2/2019 and his father, Frank Bertholf, was a white electrician from nearby Monroe, New York.Found in the 1880 census under the misspelled Bortholf and correctly in 1900 under Bertholf. He is shown as single in 1900, calling into question whether or not he was actually married to Ida Oliver. Willie was at least somewhat conversant in Yiddish, as he demonstrated in a television interview late in his life. Willie's mother, Ida Oliver, had \\"Spanish, Negro, and Mohawk Indian blood\\". Her mother, Ann Oliver, was a banjo player and had been in Primrose and West minstrel shows (Smith also had two cousins who were dancers in the shows, Etta and John Bloom).\\"Music on My Mind\\", p. 7 According to Ida, \\"Frank Bertholoff [sic] was a light-skinned playboy who loved his liquor, girls, and gambling.\\" His mother threw Frank out of the house when \\"The Lion\\" was two years old. When his father died in 1901, his mother married John Smith, a master mechanic from Paterson, New Jersey. The surname Smith was added to that of \\"The Lion\\" at age three. He grew up living at 76 Academy Street in Newark, New Jersey. John Smith worked for C.M. Bailey, Pork Packers, and he would leave the house around midnight to pick up the freshly killed pigs and bring them to the packing house. He was supposed to be home by 4 am, but would usually go to bars. Eventually, Willie's mother wanted him to accompany his stepfather to work to hopefully ensure that John Smith would come straight home and not go drinking. Willie said he actually enjoyed his job, but most of the time he would have to drive the horses home. He also could only work on Fridays and Saturdays, as his mother did not want him to miss school. He wrote about the experience of being at the slaughterhouse with his stepfather: > I couldn't stand to see what I saw at the slaughterhouse. I would watch > wide-eyed as the squealing pigs slid down the iron rails to the cutter where > they were slashed through the middle, with the two halves falling into a > tank of hot water. The kill sometimes went to as many as four hundred pigs a > night. It was a sickening sight to watch. But the cries from the pigs > brought forth an emotional excitement.

The squeaks, the squeals, the > dipping them in hot water, they put them on a hook, take off the head, the > legs, going down an aisle‚ÄîI hear it on an oboe. That's what you hear in a > symphony: destruction, war, peace, beauty, all mixed. In 1907, the family moved to 90 Bloome Street in Newark, but moved again around 1912. His stepfather got a new job at Crucible Steel Company, across the Passaic River in Harrison, New Jersey. The job paid more, and Willie would have to get him before his bosses got him drunk on his own money. He attended the Baxter School, rumored to be a school for bad children. The school was notorious for brawls between Irish, Italian, and African-American children. Willie was in Mrs. Black's fruit store and was caught with his hand in her register. According to Smith's memoirs, he had wanted to borrow a dime to see S.H. Dudley's traveling road show at Blaney's Theater. The thing that shocked Willie the most was the fact that she turned him over to the police. Mrs. Black's son-in-law was the number three tough guy in Newark, and their whole family hated policemen and wouldn't allow them into their store. Willie later wrote, \\"But they sure didn't mind turning over a 10 year old boy to the police.\\" He went to children's court and was sentenced to a ten dollar fine and probation. After that incident, he was transferred to Morton School, and began sixth grade at his new school (which had a lot less brawling). He would go on to attend Barringer High School (then known as Newark High School). In an effort to get the attention of the ladies, he attempted sports including swimming, skating, track, basketball, sledding, cycling, and boxing. He learned to swim in the Morris Canal. Prizefighting was the sport he was most interested in. Willie says that \\"maybe that because I've known most of the great fighters from way back. They liked to visit the night clubs ... \\". He got to kid around with Jack Johnson, Jack Dempsey, Battling Siki, Kid Chocolate, Sam Langford, Joe Gans, Bob Fitzsimmons, Harry Greb, Joe Louis, and Gene Tunney. Fitzsimmons owned a saloon on Market Street in Newark, and that is where Willie learned about Stanley Ketchel, Kid McCoy, Benny Leonard, Jimmy Britt, and Charlie Warner. Willie also belonged to a gang, and the gang had a club called The Ramblers (two members were Abner Zwillman and Niggy Rutman). Willie was one of two black men in the gang, the other being Louis Moss, who Willie referred to as a \\"sweet talker, who could take his foes apart\\". Moss later became known as \\"Big Sue\\" and owned a saloon in Tenderloin, Manhattan. Moss was his own bouncer at his club (according to Willie, Moss was 6'4\\" and about 240 pounds). Willie says he used to help him out by playing piano in his back room. Music career When Willie was about six, he went downstairs to the basement of his Academy Street home and found the organ his mother used to play. It was not in good shape, and nearly half of the keys were missing. After his mother discovered his interest in the instrument, she taught him the melodies she knew. One of the first songs he learned was Home! Sweet Home!. His uncle Rob, who was a bass singer and ran his own quartet, would teach Willie how to dance. Willie entered an amateur dance contest at the Arcadia Theater and won first place and the prize, ten dollars. After that, he focused more on playing music at the clubs. Willie had wanted a new piano very badly, but every time he thought his mother was able to afford it, there was a new mouth to feed. Willie got a job at Hauseman's Footwear store shining shoes and running errands, where he was paid five dollars a week. \\"Old Man\\" Hauseman paid that much because he liked the fact that Willie could speak Hebrew and also because Willie wanted to buy a piano with the money. As it turned out, Marshall & Wendell's was holding a contest: the object was to guess how many dots there were in a printed circle in their newspaper advertisement. Willie used arithmetic to help guess the number, and the upright piano was delivered the next day. From that day forth, he sat down at the piano and played. He would play songs he heard in the clubs, including Maple Leaf Rag by Scott Joplin, Cannonball Rag by Joe Northrup, Black and White Rag by George Botsford, and Don't Hit that Lady Dressed in Green, about which he said \\"the lyrics to this song were a sex education, especially for a twelve year old boy.\\". His other favorites picked up from the saloons were She's Got Good Booty and Baby, Let Your Drawers Hang Low. By the early 1910s he was playing in New York City and Atlantic City, New Jersey. Smith served in World War I, where he saw action in France, and played drum with the African-American regimental band led by Tim Brymn. He also played basketball with the regimental team. Legend has it that his nickname \\"The Lion\\" came from his reported bravery while serving as a heavy artillery gunner. He was a decorated veteran of the 350th Field Artillery, a regiment of the Buffalo Soldiers. Around 1915, he married Blanche Merrill (n√©e Howard). Smith and Merrill are thought to have separated before Smith joined the army in 1917, serving as a corporal (he claimed sergeant was his rank), but were still living together in Newark, New Jersey at the time of the 1920 census. Merrill was white and Smith was the only black man living in their apartment building at the time. He returned to working in Harlem clubs and in rent parties, where Smith and his contemporaries James P. Johnson and Fats Waller developed a new, more sophisticated piano style later called \\"stride\\". In the 1940s his music found appreciation with a wider audience, and he toured North America and Europe up to 1971. To leave the US, he needed a birth certificate. He went to the Orange County Courthouse and found it, but discovered that the birth certificate said he was born on November 25, in contradiction to his mother telling him he was born on November 23. Personal life Smith had 10 brothers and a sister (including half-siblings). His older brother Jerome died at the age of 15. His other older brother, George, became an officer in Atlantic City, and died in 1946. Willie said of George, \\"Our paths didn't cross very often in later life. His friends and connections were always on the other side of the fence from mine.\\" His half-brother Robert owned a bar on West Street in Newark. His half- brother Melvin lived on Mulberry Street in Manhattan. Smith had no idea what became of his other two half-brothers, Norman and Ralph. All of the other siblings lived to the ages of three to seven. According to Smith, Frank Bertholf (cited as Bertholoff in his autobiography), his birth father was Jewish. As a boy, he delivered clean clothes to his mother's clients, including to a prosperous Jewish family who invited him to sit in on Hebrew lessons on Saturday mornings. Willie was Bar-Mitzvahed in Newark at age thirteen, and later in life worked as a Hebrew cantor for a Black Jewish congregation in Harlem. Death In his later years, he received frequent honors for his life's work including a Willie \\"The Lion\\" Smith Day in Newark, New Jersey. Smith died at the age of 79, on April 18, 1973, in New York. Legacy The liner notes his 1958 LP The Legend of Willie \\"The Lion\\" Smith (Grand Awards Records GA 33-368) state: \\"Duke Ellington has never lost his awe of the Lion's prowess.\\" It quotes Ellington as saying, \\"Willie The Lion was the greatest influence of all the great jazz piano players who have come along. He has a beat that stays in the mind.\\" This LP is also noted for its album cover, featuring a painting of the Lion by Tracy Sugarman. Ellington attested to his admiration when he composed and recorded the highly regarded \\"Portrait of the Lion\\" in 1939. Orange County (NY) Executive Edward Diana issued a proclamation declaring September 18 Willie \\"The Lion\\" Smith Day in Orange County, the date of the first Goshen Jazz Festival.

Distribution The little bittern is native to the Old World, breeding in Africa, central and southern Europe, western and southern Asia, and Madagascar. Birds from temperate regions in Europe and western Asia are migratory, wintering in Africa and further south in Asia, while those nesting in the tropics are sedentary. It is rare north of its breeding range. In Britain there were intermittent reports of breeding in the nineteenth century, and again in 1946 and 1957, but none of these records were proven. The first proven British breeding record is from Yorkshire in 1984, and the second from the Avalon Marshes in Somerset in 2010, by 2017 this species had been present in this area for nine consecutive years. Taxonomy Carl Linnaeus described the little bittern in 1766. The three subspecies are: * I. m. minutus ‚Äì (Linnaeus, 1766): nominate, found in Europe, Asia, northern Africa; winters in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia * I. m. payesii ‚Äì (Hartlaub, 1858): found in sub-Saharan Africa, resident * I. m. podiceps ‚Äì (Bonaparte, 1855): found in Madagascar, resident The Australian little bittern (I. dubius) and the extinct New Zealand little bittern (I. novaezelandiae) were formerly considered subspecies of the little bittern. Description Egg, Collection Museum Wiesbaden Immature The little bittern has a length of and a wing span of . It is the smallest of the breeding herons of Europe and is characterised by its tiny size, long and sharp bull and thick neck. The male's are distinctively patterned and both sexes show pale forewing panels. The males have black with a faint green sheen on the crown, nape, back, tail and scapulars. The underparts are pale buff and the wing has a pinkish buff oval shaped panel which contrasts with the otherwise black wings and is formed by the inner wing coverts. The underwing is completely whiteish in colour. The female is duller than the male and has brownish black upperparts with paler feather margins visible at close range. The underparts of the female are not as clean as those of the male and are streaked with dark buff and brown. The female's wing panel is less obvious than the male's. The juveniles are duller and more rufous than the females and are more heavily streaked on both their upperparts and underparts, including their wing coverts. Status The little bittern is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds applies. Behaviour The little bittern is crepuscular, skulking and normally solitary. It feeds on fishes, amphibians and insects which are caught within reedbeds or at their edges by the bird slowly stalking the prey. The male claims a territory in the Spring, advertising his presence with a deep barking or croaking call and the monogamous pair remain together for at least one breeding season. Eggs are laid in a nest situated in dense reedbeds, rushes or bushes above the water from the middle of May and there is a single brood which is normally 5-6 eggs. These are incubated for 17‚Äì19 days and the chicks are fledged after 25‚Äì30 days. In Europe the little bittern is a migratory species, crossing the Mediterranean from Africa in the early Spring and arriving in their breeding wetlands from mid April onwards. The return to Africa occurs in August and September and there are normally only a few juveniles left in Europe by October. The European breeders migrate as far south as the Eastern Cape and Transvaal.

As with other pratincoles, it is native to the Old World. Etymology The genus name is a diminutive of Latin glarea, \\"gravel\\", referring to a typical nesting habitat for pratincoles. The species name pratincola means an inhabitant of meadows, from Latin pratum, prati, \\"meadow\\" and incola, \\"inhabitant\\", from incolere, \\"to inhabit\\". Description This pratincole is long with a wingspan. It has short legs, long pointed wings, a long forked tail, and a short bill, which is an adaptation to aerial feeding. The back and head are brown, and the wings are brown with darker flight feathers. The belly is white. The underwings are chestnut, but look dark below. Very good views are needed to distinguish this species from other pratincoles, such as the black-winged pratincole and the oriental pratincole, which may occur in its range. The latter species also has a chestnut underwing, but is shorter-tailed. =Subspecies= The collared pratincole is divided into two subspecies: * G. p. pratincola, (Linnaeus, 1766): southern Europe & North Africa to Pakistan * G. p. fuelleborni, (Neumann, 1910): sub- Saharan Africa Behaviour =Feeding= Pratincoles are unusual among waders in that they typically hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground. =Breeding= In flight, showing dark rufous underwing coverts and deeply forked tail Clutch in nest Glareola pratincola boweni The species lays 2‚Äì4 eggs on the ground. Distribution and habitat The collared pratincole is a bird of open country, and is often seen near water in the evening, hawking for insects. It is found in the warmer parts of Europe, southwest Asia and Africa. It is migratory, wintering in tropical Africa, and is rare north of the breeding range.

Early life Marable was born in Paducah, Kentucky to Elizabeth Lillian (Wharton) Marable, a piano teacher. Fate had five siblings, including two brothers, Harold and James, and three sisters, Mabel, Juanita, and Neona. Elizabeth Marable, known as \\"Lizzie,\\" gave her son music lessons, both in reading music and playing piano. Music career At the age of 17, Marable began playing on the steam boats plying the Mississippi River. John and Joseph Streckfus hired him to replace their piano player, Charles Mills, who had accepted an engagement in New York City.Kenney (2005), pp. 4041. There was a catch: Marable's responsibilities would include playing a large steam calliope. Steam streamed through the brass pipes and whistles at 80 pounds of pressure, the keys were hot and they were hard to hold down. Pitch varied with steam pressure, so there was a challenge of playing in tune. The calliope was designed to be clearly heard on shore, so the volume was overwhelming to the musician who was manipulating it. To prepare himself for playing the loud machine that spewed steam and water, Marable wore gloves, stuffed his ears with cotton,Kenney, (2005), pp. 4042. and donned raingear. Later in 1907, he became bandleader for a paddlewheeler on the Streckfus Line running between New Orleans, Louisiana and St. Paul, Minnesota, a position he retained for 33 years.Kenney (2005), p. 39. Later, he spent late nights in New Orleans' clubs scouting for talent and playing at jam sessions. There he discovered Louis Armstrong blowing cornet, and recruited him to play for his band on evening riverboat excursions cruising around the Crescent City. As a bandleader, Marable shared the lessons from his mother with his musicians. Many of the musicians he hired played by ear, and he augmented their skills by teaching them to read music, and expected them all to learn how to play from sheet music on sight.Kenney (2005), p. 38. As his one-time drummer, Zutty Singleton put it, \\"There was a saying in New Orleans. When some musician would get a job on the riverboats with Fate Marable, they'd say, 'Well, you're going to the conservatory.'\\" While he was training these musicians to better perform the dance arrangements for the steamboat passengers, he also boosted many of their careers when they were ready to move on. Streckfus Steamers' alumni went on to play with notable bands and bandleaders such as Cab Calloway, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunceford, Mills Blue Rhythm Band, Fats Waller, and Chick Webb. 1920 advertisement for \\"Moonlight Cruises De Luxe\\" on a steamer at New Orleans which featured Marable's band. Members of Marable's bands were expected to be able to play a wide variety of music, from hot numbers to light classics, playing by memory or ear, and from sheet music. Above all they were expected to keep the dancers happy. Marable was a strict bandleader, demanding musical proficiency and rigid discipline from all his bandmembers, yet allowing them to develop their individual strong points. For instance, Louis Armstrong's gift for improvisation was recognised as such by Marable, and he allowed him to improvise his breaks rather than play them note for note. Marable's band served as an early musical education for many other players who would later become prominent in jazz, including Red Allen, Baby Dodds, Johnny Dodds, Pops Foster, Errol Garner, Narvin Kimball, Al Morgan, Jimmy Blanton, Elbert Pee Wee Claybrook, , and Zutty Singleton. In 1916, Marable published the only original composition of his career, Barrell House Rag, co-written with Clarence Williams.Kenney (2005), 4344. A young George Russell, later notable for formulating the Lydian Concept, grew up listening to Marable's music. Death Fate Marable died of pneumonia in St. Louis, Missouri. He was 56 years old. He is buried in Oak Grove Cemetery in Paducah, Kentucky.

Abbreviated to \\"BFD\\", this became the library name. \\"Binary File Descriptor\\" was invented later as a backronym for \\"BFD\\".  Design  BFD works by presenting a common abstract view of object files. An object file has a \\"header\\" with descriptive info; a variable number of \\"sections\\" that each has a name, some attributes, and a block of data; a symbol table; relocation entries; and so forth. Internally, BFD translates the data from the abstract view into the details of the bit/byte layout required by the target processor and file format. Its key services include handling byte order differences, such as between a little- endian host and big-endian target, correct conversion between 32-bit and 64-bit data, and details of address arithmetic specified by relocation entries. Although BFD was originally designed to be a generic library usable by a wide variety of tools, the frequent need to tinker with the API to accommodate new systems' capabilities has tended to limit its use; BFD's main clients are the GNU Assembler (GAS), GNU Linker (GLD), and other GNU Binary Utilities (\\"binutils\\") tools, and the GNU Debugger (GDB). As a result, BFD is not distributed separately, but is always included with releases of binutils and GDB.

Etymology and Germanic paganism  The modern English language term bless likely derives from the 1225 term blessen, which developed from the Old English bl«£dsian (preserved in the Northumbrian dialect around 950 AD).Barnhart (1995:73). The term also appears in other forms, such as blƒìdsian (before 830), blƒìtsian from around 725 and ' from around 1000, all meaning to make sacred or holy by a sacrificial custom in the Anglo-Saxon pagan period, originating in Germanic paganism; to mark with blood. Due to this, the term is related to the term bl≈çd, meaning blood. References to this indigenous practice, Bl√≥t, exist in related Icelandic sources. The modern meaning of the term may have been influenced in translations of the Bible into Old English during the process of Christianization to translate the Latin term benedƒ´cere meaning to \\"speak well of\\", resulting in meanings such as to \\"praise\\" or \\"extol\\" or to speak of or to wish well. Abrahamic religions Isaac Blessing Jacob, painting by Govert Flinck (Rijksmuseum Amsterdam) 'To be blessed' means to be favored by God, the source of all blessing. Blessings, therefore, are directly associated with, and are believed to come from, God. Thus, to express a blessing is like bestowing a wish on someone that they experience the favor of God, and to acknowledge God as the source of all blessing. A biblical damnation, in its most formal sense, is a negative blessing. In the Bible, positive and negative blessings are related; the book of Deuteronomy prescribes that obedience to the Law of Moses brings God's blessing. One of the first incidences of blessing in the Bible is in Genesis, where Abram is ordered by the God to leave his country and is told: The Priestly Blessing is set forth at Numbers : : May Adonai bless you, and guard you; : May Adonai make His countenance shine upon you, and be gracious to you; : May Adonai turn His countenance to you and grant you peace. =Judaism= Position in which a Jewish kohen places his hands and fingers during the Priestly Blessing, detail of a mozaic in the Synagoge of Enschede, NetherlandsThe mosaic text reads \\"◊ë◊©◊û◊ê◊ú◊î ◊¢◊©◊® ◊ï◊õ◊ë◊ï◊ì\\" (\\"in her left hand riches and honor\\"), which is a part of Proverbs 3:16. In Rabbinic Judaism, a blessing (or berakhah) is recited at a specified moment during a prayer, ceremony or other activity, especially before and after partaking of food. The function of blessings is to acknowledge God as the source of all blessing.Sefer ha-Chinuch 430 A berakhah of rabbinic origin typically starts with the words, \\"Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe...\\" Rabbinic Judaism teaches that food ultimately is a gift of the one great Provider, God, and that to partake of food legitimately one should express gratitude to God by reciting the appropriate blessing of rabbinic origin prior, while torah mandates an informal blessing afterwards. Jewish law does not reserve recitation of blessings to only a specific class of Jews; but it does mandate specific blessings to specific occasions, so that, for example since medieval times, Jewish women chiefly recite a rabbinic blessing after lighting two Shabbat candles. =Christianity= First Communion Blessings and curses of Christ appear in the New Testament, as recounted in the Beatitudes of Luke 6:20-22. Within Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, Lutheranism, and similar traditions, formal blessings of the church are performed by bishops, priests, and deacons. Particular formulas may be associated with episcopal blessings and papal blessings. In Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, and Lutheran churches blessings are bestowed by bishops and priests in a liturgical context, raising their right hand and making the sign of the cross with it over persons or objects to be blessed. They also give blessings to begin divine services and at the dismissal at the end. In the Eastern Orthodox Church liturgical blessings are performed over people, objects, or are given at specific points during divine services. A priest or bishop usually blesses with his hand, but may use a blessing cross, candles, an icon, the Chalice or Gospel Book to bestow blessings, always making the Sign of the Cross therewith. When blessing with the hand, a priest uses his right hand, holding his fingers so that they form the Greek letters IC XC, the monogram of Jesus Christ. A bishop does the same, except he uses both hands, or may hold the crozier in his left hand, using both to make the Sign of the Cross. A bishop may also bless with special candlesticks known as the dikirion and trikirion. When blessing an object, the rubrics often instruct Orthodox bishops and priests to make use of such substances as incense and holy water. Also, formal ecclesiastical permission to undertake an action is referred to as a \\"blessing\\". The blessing may be bestowed by a bishop or priest, or by one's own spiritual father. When an Orthodox layperson bestows a blessing, he or she will hold the thumb and first two fingers of the right hand together (the same configuration used when making the Sign of the Cross on themselves), and make the sign of the cross over the person or object they are blessing. In the Methodist tradition, the minister blesses the congregation during the concluding part of the service of worship, known as the benediction. With regard to house blessings, the Methodist The Book of Worship for Church and Home (1965) contains \\"An Office for the Blessing of a Dwelling\\". In the Roman Catholic Church a priest or bishop blesses the faithful with the Blessed Sacrament in the monstrance during Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. According to the guidelines given by the Vatican's Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments that govern the procedures for liturgical ceremonies, if a Roman Catholic layperson (a lay acolyte or parish administrator, for example) or any non-ordained religious (who is not the superior of the congregation) leads a Sunday service (other than a Mass, which requires a priest to celebrate), such as Eucharistic adoration, the Rosary, or celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours, he or she does not perform rites or sacraments reserved to the clergy and does not solemnly bless the people as a bishop, priest, or deacon would at the end of the service; an alternative format is used instead. In the Lutheran Churches, priests are often asked to bless objects frequently used by or sacred to individuals, such as a cross necklace; in addition, Lutheran clergy also bless the homes of members of the congregations. In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, blessings are given by worthy, male members who hold the Melchizedek priesthood. =Islam= Blessings in Islam has twofold aspect, according to major scholars of Islam Blessings are given by Allah as a trial for mankind. Scholars of Islam believe that having fear of being gradually misled by blessings is an attribute of the pious and not having fear from such even though one is constantly misbehaving is an attribute of the impious. In Islam, blessings can be a source of success in afterlife if one is grateful to Allah for them and the same blessings can be a source for damnation in afterlife if one doesn't constantly be grateful to God for them. Islam has no clerical caste, and therefore no blessings reserved to specific individuals. Muslims will frequently pronounce \\"peace and blessings be upon him\\" when mentioning the name of Muhammad or indeed, any of the prophets. Muslims will also greet one another with a blessing every time they meet and depart (ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ ÿπŸÑŸäŸÉŸÖ Ÿàÿ±ÿ≠ŸÖÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá Ÿàÿ®ÿ±ŸÉÿßÿ™Ÿá as-salƒÅmu alaikum wa rahmatul-lƒÅhi wa barakƒÅtuh (meaning \\"may peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you\\")). Dharma religions Indian religions, which includes Hinduism and its offshoots Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, etc. are also called Dharma religions, all of which are based on the concept of dharma and karma and typical blessings are based on Adhi·π£·π≠hƒÅna, A√±jali MudrƒÅ, Dar≈õana and Mudra, etc. =Hinduism= Aarti. In Hinduism Puja is a religious ritual performed by Hindus as an offering to various deities, distinguished persons, or special guests. It is modeled on the idea of giving a gift or offering to a deity or important person and receiving their approval (\\"AshirvƒÅd\\"). During the Puja involves an 'Aarti plate' or 'Aarti lamp' is circulating around a deity or person and is generally accompanied by the singing of songs in praise of that deity or person (many versions exist). In doing so, the plate or lamp is supposed to acquire the power of the deity. The priest circulates the plate or lamp to all those present. They cup their down- turned hands over the flame and then raise their palms to their forehead - the purificatory blessing, passed from the deity's image to the flame, has now been passed to the devotee. During the naivedya ritual, a devotee makes an offering of a material substance such as flowers, fruits, or sweets. The deity then 'enjoys' or tastes a bit of the offering, which is then temporarily known as bhogya. This now-divinely invested substance is called prasƒÅda, and is received by the devotee to be ingested, worn, etc. It may be the same material that was originally offered, or material offered by others and then re- distributed to other devotees. In many temples, several kinds of prasada (e.g. nuts, sweets) are distributed to the devotees. Hindu priest giving blessing. Darshan is a term meaning \\"sight\\" (in the sense of an instance of seeing or beholding; from a root d·πõ≈õ \\"to see\\"), vision, apparition, or glimpse. It is most commonly used for \\"visions of the divine,\\" e.g., of a god or a very holy person or artifact. One could \\"receive darshana\\" of the deity in the temple, or from a great saintly person, such as a great guru. The touching of the feet (pranƒÅma) is a show of respect and it is often an integral part of darshan. Children touch the feet of their family elders while people of all ages will bend to touch the feet of a great guru, murti (icon) of a Deva (God) (such as Rama or Krishna). There is a special link between worshipper and guru during pujas, in which people may touch the guru's feet in respect (PranƒÅma), or remove the dust from a guru's feet before touching their own head. Another tradition is \\"VƒÅhan pujƒÅ\\" (Hindi) or \\"VƒÅgana poojai\\" (Tamil ‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æï‡Æ© ‡Æ™‡ØÇ‡Æú‡Øà) 'vehicle blessing'. This is a ritual that is performed when one purchases a new vehicle. =Buddhism= Replica of an image at the Sanchi gate at Chaitya Bhoomi, which shows a devotion scene involving a Buddhist stupa. Blessings in Buddhism, ceremonies are meant to provide a blessing. Other uses A traditional Hawaiian blessing during a groundbreaking ceremony A blessing can also be a request for permission, as in \\"gaining your parents' blessing\\" would consist of having been granted consent. Clergy will normally receive a blessing from their ecclesiastical superiors to begin their ministry. In the Russian Orthodox Church pious laymen would go to a starets (elder) to receive his or her blessing before embarking upon any important work or making a major decision in their life. In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a member may receive a special blessing, known as a patriarchal blessing, as guidance. In the U.S., there are sometimes ritual ceremonies to bless companion animals. In Spanish, there is a blessing which can be used as a tender farewell, especially from a parent: Vaya con Dios (\\"Go with God\\"), also Adi√≥s (A Dios, \\"to God\\"), similar to the French Adieu. Blessing is also a term used for marriage in the Unification Church, see: Blessing Ceremony of the Unification Church. In Hawaii anything new (a new building, a new stretch of road to be opened, a new garden) receives a blessing by a Hawaiian practitioner (or Kahuna) in a public ceremony (involving also the unwinding of e.g. a maile lei). In the Kyrgyz people's tradition, the blessing (bata or ak bata, \\"the right blessing\\" or \\"white blessing\\") might be a good wish to somebody by the elderly person or the person with a best reputation before the travel or launch of some activity of the person who seeks such a blessing and moral support. The procedure might be a trace of the pre-Islamic local nomadic traditions with deep family values. Some times, elderly might give a negative blessing (so called \\"teskeri bata\\" - \\"the opposite blessing\\" or \\"the black blessing\\").

A safety data sheet (SDS), material safety data sheet (MSDS), or product safety data sheet (PSDS) are documents that list information relating to occupational safety and health for the use of various substances and products. SDSs are a widely used system for cataloging information on chemicals, chemical compounds, and chemical mixtures. SDS information may include instructions for the safe use and potential hazards associated with a particular material or product, along with spill-handling procedures. The older MSDS formats could vary from source to source within a country depending on national requirements; however, the newer SDS format is internationally standardized. An SDS for a substance is not primarily intended for use by the general consumer, focusing instead on the hazards of working with the material in an occupational setting. There is also a duty to properly label substances on the basis of physico-chemical, health, or environmental risk. Labels can include hazard symbols such as the European Union standard symbols. The same product (e.g. paints sold under identical brand names by the same company) can have different formulations in different countries. The formulation and hazard of a product using a generic name may vary between manufacturers in the same country. Globally Harmonized System The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals contains a standard specification for safety data sheets.

Date of the latest revision of the SDS National and international requirements =Canada= In Canada, the program known as the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) establishes the requirements for SDSs in workplaces and is administered federally by Health Canada under the Hazardous Products Act, Part II, and the Controlled Products Regulations. =European Union= Safety data sheets have been made an integral part of the system of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (REACH).Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC,◊§2000/21/EC (OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, corrected version in OJ L136, 29.5.2007, p.3). The original requirements of REACH for SDSs have been further adapted to take into account the rules for safety data sheets of the Global Harmonised System (GHS) and the implementation of other elements of the GHS into EU legislation that were introduced by Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 (CLP)Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (OJ L 353, 31.12.2008, p.1) via an update to Annex II of REACH. The SDS must be supplied in an official language of the Member State(s) where the substance or mixture is placed on the market, unless the Member State(s) concerned provide(s) otherwise (Article 31(5) of REACH). The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) has published a guidance document on the compilation of safety data sheets. Germany In Germany Safety data sheets must be compiled in accordance with REACH Regulation No. 1907/2006. The requirements concerning national aspects are defined in the Technical Rule for Hazardous Substances (TRGS) 220 \\"National aspects when compiling safety data sheets\\". A national measure mentioned in SDS section 15 is as example the water hazard class (WGK) it is based on Regulations governing systems for handling substances hazardous to waters (AwSV). Umweltbundesamt: https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/421/dokumente/notification_draft_2015_394_d_en.pdf The Netherlands Dutch Safety Data Sheets are well known as veiligheidsinformatieblad or Chemiekaarten. This is a collection of Safety Data Sheets of the most widely used chemicals. The Chemiekaarten boek is commercially available, but also made available through educational institutes, such as the web site offered by the University of Groningen. = South Africa = This section contributes to a better understanding of the regulations governing SDS within the South African framework. As regulations may change, it is the responsibility of the reader to verify the validity of the regulations mentioned in text. As globalisation increased and countries engaged in cross-border trade, the quantity of hazardous material crossing international borders amplified. Realising the detrimental effects of hazardous trade, the United Nations established a committee of experts specialising in the transportation of hazardous goods. The committee provides best practises governing the conveyance of hazardous materials and goods for land including road and railway; air as well as sea transportation. These best practises are constantly updated to remain current and relevant. There are various other international bodies who provide greater detail and guidance for specific modes of transportation such as the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) by means of the International Maritime Code and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) via the Technical Instructions for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air as well as the International Air Transport Association (IATA) who provides regulations for the transport of dangerous goods. These guidelines prescribed by the international authorities are applicable to the South African land, sea and air transportation of hazardous materials and goods. In addition to these rules and regulations to International best practice, South Africa has also implemented common laws which are laws based on custom and practise. Common laws are a vital part of maintaining public order and forms the basis of case laws. Case laws, using the principles of common law are interpretations and decisions of statutes made by courts. Acts of parliament are determinations and regulations by parliament which form the foundation of statutory law. Statutory laws are published in the government gazette or on the official website. Lastly, subordinate legislation are the bylaws issued by local authorities and authorised by parliament. Statutory law gives effect to the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1993 and the National Road Traffic Act of 1996. The Occupational Health and Safety Act details the necessary provisions for the safe handling and storage of hazardous materials and goods whilst the transport act details with the necessary provisions for the transportation of the hazardous goods. Relevant South African legislation includes the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1993, the National Road Traffic Act of 1996, and the Standards Act of 2008. There has been selective incorporation of aspects of the Globally Harmonised System (GHS) of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals into South African legislation. At each point of the chemical value chain, there is a responsibility to manage chemicals in a safe and responsible manner. SDS is therefore required by law. A SDS is included in the requirements of Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 (Act No.85 of 1993) Regulation 1179 dated 25 August 1995. The categories of information supplied in the SDS are listed in SANS 11014:2010; dangerous goods standards ‚Äì Classification and information. SANS 11014:2010 supersedes the first edition SANS 11014-1:1994 and is an identical implementation of ISO 11014:2009. According to SANS 11014:2010: =United Kingdom= In the U.K., the Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2002 - known as CHIP Regulations - impose duties upon suppliers, and importers into the EU, of hazardous materials. NOTE: Safety data sheets (SDS) are no longer covered by the CHIP regulations. The laws that require a SDS to be provided have been transferred to the European REACH Regulations. The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations govern the use of hazardous substances in the workplace in the UK and specifically require an assessment of the use of a substance. Regulation 12 requires that an employer provides employees with information, instruction and training for people exposed to hazardous substances. This duty would be very nearly impossible without the data sheet as a starting point. It is important for employers therefore to insist on receiving a data sheet from a supplier of a substance. The duty to supply information is not confined to informing only business users of products. SDSs for retail products sold by large DIY shops are usually obtainable on those companies' web sites. Web sites of manufacturers and large suppliers do not always include them even if the information is obtainable from retailers but written or telephone requests for paper copies will usually be responded to favourably. =United Nations= The United Nations (UN) defines certain details used in SDSs such as the UN numbers used to identify some hazardous materials in a standard form while in international transit. =United States= In the U.S., the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires that SDSs be readily available to all employees for potentially harmful substances handled in the workplace under the Hazard Communication regulation. The SDS is also required to be made available to local fire departments and local and state emergency planning officials under Section 311 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. The American Chemical Society defines Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Numbers (CAS numbers) which provide a unique number for each chemical and are also used internationally in SDSs. Reviews of material safety data sheets by the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board have detected dangerous deficiencies. The board's Combustible Dust Hazard Study analyzed 140 data sheets of substances capable of producing combustible dusts. None of the SDSs contained all the information the board said was needed to work with the material safely, and 41 percent failed to even mention that the substance was combustible. As part of its study of an explosion and fire that destroyed the Barton Solvents facility in Valley Center, Kansas, in 2007, the safety board reviewed 62 material safety data sheets for commonly used nonconductive flammable liquids. As in the combustible dust study, the board found all the data sheets inadequate. In 2012, the US adopted the 16 section Safety Data Sheet to replace Material Safety Data Sheets. This became effective on December 1, 2013. These new Safety Data Sheets comply with the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS). By June 1, 2015, employers were required to have their workplace labeling and hazard communication programs updated as necessary ‚Äì including all MSDSs replaced with SDS-formatted documents. SDS authoring Many companies offer the service of collecting, or writing and revising, data sheets to ensure they are up to date and available for their subscribers or users. Some jurisdictions impose an explicit duty of care that each SDS be regularly updated, usually every three to five years. However, when new information becomes available, the SDS must be revised without delay. European Chemicals Agency (2013).

Born in Benediktbeuern, he lived in Rome from 1711-13 to study at the Accademia di San Luca with Carlo Maratta. In 1713, Asam won the Academy's first prize for his drawing of Miracle of Saint Pio. In Germany, he worked with his brother Egid Quirin, a sculptor and stucco worker, on building and decorating entirely new churches (such as the Asam Church in Munich) or redesigning churches in the Baroque style (Regensburg--Benedictine Monastery Church of St. Emmeram). Their joint projects are often attributed to the \\"Asam Brothers\\". Cosmas Damian died in Munich.

Pre-European settlement Aborigines on Merri Creek by Charles Troedel The area around Port Phillip and the Yarra valley, on which the city of Melbourne now stands, was the home of the Kulin people, an alliance of several language groups of Indigenous Australians, whose ancestors had lived in the area for an estimated 31,000 to 40,000 years.Gary Presland, The First Residents of Melbourne's Western Region, (revised edition), Harriland Press, 1997. . Presland says on page 1: \\"There is some evidence to show that people were living in the Maribyrnong River valley, near present day Keilor, about 40,000 years ago.\\" At the time of European settlement the population of indigenous inhabitants was estimated to be under 20,000, who were hunter- gatherers from three tribes: the Wurundjeri, Boonwurrung and Wathaurong.Gary Presland, Aboriginal Melbourne: The Lost Land of the Kulin People, Harriland Press (1985), Second edition 1994, . This book describes in some detail the archaeological evidence regarding aboriginal life, culture, food gathering and land management, particularly the period from the flooding of Bass Strait and Port Phillip from about 7‚Äì10,000 years ago, up to the European colonisation in the nineteenth century. The area was an important meeting place for the clans of the Kulin, as well as a vital source of food, water and a sheltered Bay Area for clan meetings and annual events.Isabel Ellender and Peter Christiansen, People of the Merri Merri. The Wurundjeri in Colonial Days, Merri Creek Management Committee, 2001 The Kulin lived by fishing, hunting and gathering, and made a good living from the rich food sources of Port Phillip and the surrounding grasslands.Gary Presland, Aboriginal Melbourne: The Lost Land of the Kulin People, Harriland Press (1985), Second edition 1994, . This book describes in some detail the archeological evidence regarding aboriginal life, culture, food gathering and land management, particularly the period from the flooding of Bass strait and Port Phillip from about 7-10,000 years ago up to the European colonisation in the nineteenth century. Many of the Aboriginal people who live in Melbourne today are descended from aboriginal groups from other parts of Victoria and Australia. However, there are still people who identify as Wurundjeri and Boon warung descendants of the original people who occupied the area of Melbourne prior to European settlement. While there are few overt signs of the Aboriginal past in the Melbourne area, there are a wealth of sites of cultural and spiritual significance.Meyer Eidelson, The Melbourne Dreaming.

A guide to the cultural landscapes of a City , Accessed 1 November 2008 European exploration The Enterprize, the ship of John Pascoe Fawkner landing at Melbourne In 1797 George Bass, in an open whaleboat with a crew of six, was the first European to enter what came to be called Bass Strait, the passage between the Australian mainland and Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania). He sailed westwards along what is now the coast of the Gippsland region of Victoria, as far west as Western Port. In 1802, John Murray in the entered Port Phillip, and he was followed shortly after by Matthew Flinders. In 1803, Charles Grimes, the deputy surveyor-general of New South Wales, was sent to Port Phillip to survey the area. Sailing on , under the command of Acting Lieutenant Charles Robbins, the party entered Port Phillip on 20 January 1803. On 30 January, Grimes and his party landed at Frankston and met around thirty of the local inhabitants. A plaque at the site marks the event. On 2 February, he entered the mouth of the Yarra River. On the next day, Grimes rowed up the river in a boat and explored what is now the Maribyrnong River for several miles. Returning to the Yarra he explored the river for several miles until he reached Dights Falls on 8 February. The journal of another member of the party, James Flemming, has been preserved, and in it he several times refers to finding good soil. Although it was evidently a dry season Flemming, who was described by King as \\"very intelligent\\", thought from the appearance of the herbage that \\"there is not often so great a scarcity of water as at present\\". He suggested that the \\"most eligible place for a settlement I have seen is on the Freshwater (Yarra) River\\". Grimes returned to Sydney on 7 March 1803 and, in spite of Flemming's opinions, reported adversely against a settlement at Port Phillip. Later in 1803 the British Governor of New South Wales, fearful that the French might try to occupy the Bass Strait area, sent Colonel David Collins with a party of 300 convicts to establish a settlement at Port Phillip. Collins arrived at the site of Sorrento, on the Mornington Peninsula, in October 1803, but was put off by the lack of fresh water. In May 1804 Collins moved the settlement to Tasmania, establishing Hobart. The northern shores of Bass Strait were then left to a few whalers and sealers. Among the convicts at Sorrento was a boy called John Pascoe Fawkner, who would later come back to settle in the Melbourne area. In 1824 Hamilton Hume and William Hovell came overland from New South Wales, failing to find Western Port, their destination, but instead reaching Corio Bay, where they found good grazing land. But it was another ten years before Edward Henty, a Tasmanian grazier, established an illegal sheep-run on crown land at Portland, in what is now western Victoria, in 1834. John Batman, a successful farmer in northern Tasmania, also desired more grazing land. He entered Port Phillip Bay on 29 May 1835, landing at Indented Head. Over the next week, he explored the area around the Bay, first at Corio Bay, near the present site of Geelong, and later moving up the Yarra and Maribyrnong rivers at the north of the Bay. He explored a large area in what is now the northern suburbs of Melbourne. Foundation of town 1880s Artist impression of Batman's Treaty being signed Collins Street, Melbourne, 1839. Watercolour by W. Knight Melbourne Landing,1840; watercolor by W. Liardet (1840) Lithograph of Melbourne from Princes Bridge in 1862. On 6 June 1835, Batman, as part of a Tasmanian business syndicate known as the Port Phillip Association, signed a treaty with eight Wurundjeri elders in which he purported to buy of land around Melbourne and another around Geelong on Corio Bay to the south-west. On 8 June he wrote in his journal: \\"So the boat went up the large river... and... I am glad to state about six miles up found the River all good water and very deep. This will be the place for a village.\\" The last sentence later became famous as the \\"founding charter\\" of Melbourne. Batman returned to Launceston in Tasmania (then known as Van Diemen's Land) and began plans to mount a large expedition to establish a settlement on the Yarra. But John Pascoe Fawkner, by now a businessman in Launceston, had the same idea. Fawkner bought a ship, the schooner Enterprize, which sailed on 4 August, with a party of intending settlers. When Batman's party reached the Yarra on 2 September, they were dismayed and angry to find Fawkner's people already in possession. The two groups decided that there was plenty of land for everybody, and when Fawkner arrived on 16 October with another party of settlers, they agreed to parcel out land and not dispute who was there first. Both Batman and Fawkner settled in the new town. Batman's Treaty with the Aborigines was annulled by the New South Wales government (which at the time governed all of eastern mainland Australia) on 26 August 1835 (and the annulment confirmed by the Colonial Office on 10 October 1835), but provided for compensation to the Association. Although this meant the settlers were now trespassing on Crown land, the government reluctantly accepted the settlers' fait accompli and allowed the town to remain. In September 1836, Governor Bourke established the Port Phillip District of New South Wales, though the borders had still not been determined, with the settlement as its administrative centre. (Bourke was authorized by London to establish a settlement in April 1836) Bourke also appointed Captain William Lonsdale as police magistrate, chief agent of the government and commandant of the district. Captain William Hobson (later Governor of New Zealand) was instructed to accompany Lonsdale, his family and public officers to Port Phillip. The presence of a warship together with the Governor's agent indicated the Governor's intention to re-take control of the situation in Port Phillip. Lonsdale arrived at Port Phillip with his wife Martha, 7-month-old daughter Alice and his one assigned servant, on board , commanded by Hobson. They anchored at the south end of the Bay on 27 September 1836, where Hobson despatched a cutter for survey work, and by 29th had proceeded north and anchored off Point Gellibrand, Hobsons Bay, near the mouth of the Yarra River. Lonsdale landed unofficially, distributing the official proclamation of the establishment of the new settlement, and did the same the next day. On 1 October 1836 Lonsdale was formally rowed up the Yarra River and was met by John Batman and Dr Thompson and other assembled settlers.B. R. Penny, 'Lonsdale, William (1799‚Äì1864)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 2, Melbourne University Press, 1967, pp 124‚Äì126 Bourke also commissioned Robert Hoddle to make the first plan for the town, completed on 25 March 1837, which came to be known as the Hoddle Grid. The surveys were intended to prepare for land sales by public auction. Bourke visited Port Phillip in March 1837, confirmed Lonsdale's choice of a site for the new town and named it Melbourne on 10 April 1837New South Wales Government Gazette, 12 April 1837 (No.271), p. 303. after the then British prime minister William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, who resided in the village of Melbourne in Derbyshire.

Accessed 7 July 2008 Public auctions for land began in June 1837. The compensation of the Port Phillip Association were only recognised to the extent of ¬£7,000, allowed as a reduction on the purchase price of land bought by the association. Most of the members sold their entitlements to Charles Swanston. George Gipps became Governor of New South Wales in 1838. In October 1839, he appointed Charles La Trobe as Superintendent of the district. He was a gifted man with artistic and scientific interests who did much to lay the foundations of Melbourne as a real city. La Trobe's most lasting contribution to the city was to reserve large areas as public parks: today these are the Treasury Gardens, the Carlton Gardens, the Flagstaff Gardens, Royal Park and the Royal Botanic Gardens. A Separation Association had been formed in 1840 wanting Port Phillip District to become a separate colony, and the first petition for the separation was drafted by Henry Fyshe Gisborne and presented by him to Governor Gipps. The entire population of Port Philip in 1841 was 11,738.Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Melbourne On 12 August 1842, Melbourne was incorporated as a \\"town\\" by Act 6 Victoria No. 7 of the Governor and Legislative Council of New South Wales. Accessed at State Library of Victoria, La Trobe Reading Room. On 25 June 1847, the City of Melbourne was declared by letters patent of Queen Victoria. In December 1842 Charles Dowling arrived in Melbourne and would soon be a merchant concentrating on 'the settlers' trade', providing merchandise for the squatters and buying their produce which he would ship to England. Richard Goldsbrough, a woolstapler, came to Melbourne in 1847. He bought a weatherboard building on the corner of William Street and Flinders Lane, and set up a business as a classer and packer of wool for sale in England. In 1850 he set up the first regular wool auction in Bourke Street. In 1843 there was a panic which was attributed to an influx of British capital being used for land speculations, with the money being deposited in banks at interest, lent to squatters, and its sudden withdrawal for the purpose of remitting to London in payment for immigration and other demands. The panic was also caused by low wool prices and the cessation of transportation. Early settlement Melbourne began as a collection of tents and huts on the banks of the Yarra River. The river was used for bathing and drinking water. The river had by the 1850s become quite polluted and was the cause of an epidemic of typhoid fever which hit the town resulting in many deaths.Melbourne City Baths Though the Melbourne City Council opened the first Melbourne City Baths on 9 January 1860,Melbourne City, Past and Present people continued to swim and drink the river water. Until the building boom which followed the gold rushes, most of Melbourne was built of timber, and almost nothing from this period survives. Two exceptions are St James Old Cathedral (1839) in Collins Street (now relocated to King Street opposite the Flagstaff Gardens), and St Francis Catholic Church (1841) in Elizabeth Street. Suburban development had already begun. The first sale of Crown lands in St Kilda took place on 7 December 1842, and the wealthy began building houses by the seashore, and a port developed at Williamstown. In 1844, a bridge was built to span the Yarra River at Swanston Street. The bridge replaced the privately operated punts. The bridge was a privately built wooden trestle toll bridge.\\"Some significant dates in the History of the City of Melbourne \\", City of Melbourne In 1850, a government-built sandstone free bridge replaced the wooden bridge. In 1848, Charles Perry became the first Anglican bishop for Melbourne,A. de Q.

Retrieved 5 November 2009 and James Alipius Goold became the Catholic Bishop of Melbourne. With the arrival of Europeans in the area, the local indigenous people were hard hit by introduced diseases, and their decline was hastened by mistreatment, alcohol and venereal disease. There were also frontier conflicts such as the Battle of Yering in 1840.Kath Gannaway, Important step for reconciliation Star News Group, 24 January 2007. Accessed 1 November 2008Isabel Ellender and Peter Christiansen, pp65-67 People of the Merri Merri. The Wurundjeri in Colonial Days, Merri Creek Management Committee, 2001 Simon Wonga made moves to reclaim land for Kulin people to settle on in 1859, but they were not successful until 1863 when the surviving members of the Wurundjeri and other Woiwurrung speakers were given 'permissive occupancy' of Coranderrk Station, near Healesville and forcibly resettled. In July 1851 the successful agitation of the Port Phillip settlers led to the establishment of Victoria as a separate colony, and La Trobe became its first Lieutenant- Governor. In 1851 the white population of the whole Port Phillip District was still only 77,000, and only 23,000 people lived in Melbourne. Melbourne had already become a centre of Australia's wool export trade. A few months after separation, gold was discovered at several locations around the colony, most notably at Ballarat and Bendigo. The ensuing gold rush radically transformed Victoria, and particularly Melbourne. During land speculation of the 1850s many stone and brick public and financial buildings were built. 1850s Gold Rush Map of Melbourne in 1855 The discovery of gold led to a huge influx of people to Victoria, most of them arriving by sea at Melbourne. The town's population doubled within a year. In 1852, 75,000 people arrived in the colony and this, combined with a very high birthrate, led to rapid population growth. The concurrent dispossession of the Aboriginal populations in those areas of inland Victoria which had not already been cleared for sheep runs was equally rapid. In 1853 work began on the Yan Yean Reservoir to provide water for Melbourne. Piped water started to flow in 1857. Victoria's population reached 400,000 in 1857 and 500,000 in 1860. As the easy gold ran out many of these people flooded into Melbourne or became a pool of unemployed in cities around Ballarat and Bendigo. There arose a huge wave of social unrest urging the opening of the lands in rural Victoria for small yeoman farming. In 1857 a Land Convention was held in Melbourne. Later a provisional government was formed by land hungry miners demanding land reform. The accelerated population growth and the enormous wealth of the goldfields fuelled a boom which lasted for forty years, and ushered in the era known as \\"marvellous Melbourne.\\" The city spread eastwards and northwards over the surrounding flat grasslands, and southwards down the eastern shore of Port Phillip. Wealthy new suburbs like South Yarra, Toorak, Kew and Malvern grew up, while the working classes settled in Richmond, Collingwood and Fitzroy. The influx of educated gold seekers from England led to rapid growth of schools, churches, learned societies, libraries and art galleries. Australia's first telegraph line was erected between Melbourne and Williamstown in 1853. The first railway in Australia was built in Melbourne in 1854 between the city and Port Melbourne, then known as Sandridge. Also in 1854, the government offered four religious groups land on which to build schools.A Great Australian School: Wesley College Examined, Andrew Lemon (2004) Helicon Press , p. 27 These included the Wesleyan Methodist Church,Wesley College ‚Äì The First Hundred Years, Geoffrey Blainey, James Morrisey and S.E.K. Hulme (1967) Robertson & Mullens, p. 21 and the Anglican Church. These resulted in Wesley College and Melbourne Grammar School being built in St Kilda Road a few years later. The University of Melbourne was founded in 1855 and the State Library of Victoria in 1856. The foundation stone of St Patrick's Catholic Cathedral was laid in 1858 and that of St Paul's Anglican Cathedral in 1880. The Philosophical Institute of Victoria received a Royal Charter in 1859 and became the Royal Society of Victoria. In 1860 this Society assembled Victoria's only organised attempt at inland exploration, the Burke and Wills expedition, with other exploration being more ad hoc. Lithograph of the original plans for Parliament House, Melbourne showing a grand dome which was not built. A Melbourne Town Council had been created in 1847, and one by one other suburbs also gained town status, complete with town councils and mayors. In 1851 a party-elected Legislative Council, dominated by squatter interests, opposed the notion of universal suffrage and the role of the Legislative Assembly. In December 1854 discontent with the licensing system on the goldfields led to the rising at the Eureka Stockade, one of only two armed rebellions in Australian history (the other being the Castle Hill convict rebellion of 1804). In November 1856, Victoria was given a constitution and in the following year full responsible government with a two house Parliament. For Melbourne, the major consequence was the magnificent edifice of Parliament House, Melbourne, which was started in December 1855 and extended to the present state between 1856 and 1929; it was not completed to the original design. The boom fuelled by gold and wool lasted through the 1860s and '70s. Victoria suffered from an acute labour shortage despite its steady influx of migrants, and this pushed up wages until they were the highest in the world. Victoria was known as \\"the working man's paradise\\" in these years. The Stonemasons Union won the eight-hour day in 1856 and celebrated by building the enormous Melbourne Trades Hall in Carlton. 1880s and 1890s expansion Lithograph of the building hosting the World's Fair of 1880 showing the rear wings which no longer exist.

During the boom, Melbourne had reputedly become the richest city in the world, In terms of area, Melbourne was already one of the largest cities in the world. Rather than building high-density apartment blocks like European cities, Melbourne expanded in all directions in the characteristic Australian suburban sprawl so Australians were afforded their Australian Dream of a \\"quarter acre block\\" in the suburbs, much like the American model. The middle classeshttp://gallery.slv.vic.gov.au/image.php?id=784 Doing the Block, Collins St, 1880. State Library of Victoria collection. lived in detached villas on large blocks of land, while the working class lived in reasonably comfortable cottages in the northern and western suburbs, and older areas like Fitzroy and Collingwood became slums. Most of the new heavy industry was concentrated in the western suburbs. The wealthy built huge mansions beside the sea or in the picturesque Yarra Valley. The new suburbs were serviced by networks of trains and trams which were among the largest and most modern in the world. Melbourne's civic pride was demonstrated by the huge edifice of the Royal Exhibition Building, built in 1880 to house the Melbourne International Exhibition. In the 1880s the long boom culminated in a frenzy of speculation and rapid inflation of land prices known as the Land Boom. Governments shared in the wealth and ploughed money into urban infrastructure, particularly railways. Huge fortunes were built on speculation, and Victorian business and politics became notorious for corruption. English banks lent freely to colonial speculators, adding to the mountain of debt on which the boom was built. 1891 economic bust In 1891 the inevitable happened: a spectacular crash brought the boom to an abrupt end. Banks and other businesses failed in large numbers, thousands of shareholders lost their money, tens of thousands of workers were put out of work. Although there are no reliable statistics, there was probably 20 percent unemployment in Melbourne throughout the 1890s. Melbourne had 490,000 people in 1890, and this figure scarcely changed for the next 15 years as a result of the crash and subsequent long slump. Immigration dried up, emigration to the goldfields of Western Australia and South Africa increased, and the high birthrate of the mid 19th century fell sharply and the city's growth continued, but very slowly. \\"Australia's capital\\": 1901-1927 The opening of the first Parliament of Australia on 9 May 1901, painted by Tom Roberts Melbourne's status as Australia's largest city lasted long enough, however, for it to become the seat of government of the new Commonwealth of Australia when the six colonies federated in 1901. Parliament House in Spring St was lent to the Parliament of Australia, while Victoria's Parliament found temporary accommodation in the Royal Exhibition Building. The city's growth stalled, and by 1905 Sydney had resumed its place as Australia's largest city. Economic growth slowly resumed from 1900, and Melbourne's population reached 670,000 by 1914. But the boom years did not return, and the level of wages remained far lower than it had been in the 1880s. As a result, urban poverty became a feature of city life, and the slum areas of the inner suburbs spread. Due to long delays in establishing a permanent capital at Canberra, Melbourne remained Australia's capital until 1927, when the parliament finally moved to the 'country capital'. Melbourne nevertheless remained the centre of the Commonwealth Public Service, the Australian Defence Forces, and as the location of the High Court of Australia for some time afterwards.

Melbourne's mood was also darkened by the terrible sacrifices of World War I, in which 112,000 Victorians enlisted and 16,000 were killed. There were bitter political divisions during the war, with Melbourne's Irish-born Catholic Archbishop Daniel Mannix leading opposition to conscription for the war and the Labor Party suffering a traumatic split. Another 4,000 Victorians died in the Spanish flu epidemic which followed the war. There was a modest revival of prosperity in the 1920s, and the population reached 1 million in 1930, but in 1929 the Wall Street Crash ushered in another Depression, which lasted until a return to prosperity in by the late 1930s, cut short by World War II. In 1934 Melbourne celebrated its centenary and acquired another great landmark, the Shrine of Remembrance in St Kilda Road. The population stagnated again, and was still only 1.1 million in 1940. Russell Street, with the spire of Scots' Church to the left, taken from the T & G Building circa April 1932. World War II During World War II, although Canberra was officially the capital, most of the military and civilian administration was centered in Melbourne, and the city's economy benefited from wartime full employment and the influx of American service personnel (including General Douglas MacArthur, who briefly made his headquarters in Collins St before relocating to Brisbane). Organised crime was rife, with gang fights in the streets of Collingwood and underworld figures like Squizzy Taylor legendary. The Labor Party was much less successful in Melbourne than it was in Sydney and other Australian cities. Labor did not form a majority government in Victoria until 1952. Post World War II Swanston Street from Princes Bridge in 1959 ICI House, built in 1955, was a powerful symbol of the Olympic city's modern aspirations. After World War II, a new era of increasing prosperity arrived, fuelled by high prices for Victoria's wool, increased government spending on transport and education, and the stimulus of renewed high immigration. Unlike prewar immigration, which had been mostly from the British Isles, the postwar program brought an influx of Europeans, at first mostly refugees from eastern and central Europe. A large proportion of these immigrants were Jews, and the Jewish population of Melbourne became the largest population proportionally of any Australian city, at about 1.4% in 1970. They were followed by migrants from Italy, Greece and the Netherlands. View of Melbourne's City Centre before the height boom, 1960. Brunswick Street, 1979. Later, in the 1960s, migrants came from Yugoslavia, Turkey, Hungary and Lebanon. These inflows rapidly transformed the city's demographic profile and many aspects of its life. This new growth required new spending on infrastructure such as roads, schools and hospitals, which had been neglected during the long decades of recession and low growth between 1890 and 1940. Henry Bolte, Premier from 1955 to 1972, was responsible for much of this rapid development of infrastructure. Under Bolte, some of the old inner-city slums were bulldozed and the dislocated tenants were housed in high-rise blocks of state-owned apartments. Since the 1970s, the pace of change in Melbourne has been increasingly rapid. The end of the White Australia Policy brought the first significant Asian migration to Melbourne since the gold rushes, with large numbers of people from Vietnam, Cambodia and China arriving. For the first time, Melbourne acquired a large Muslim population, and the official policy of multiculturalism encouraged Melbourne's various ethnic and religious minorities to maintain and celebrate their identities. At the same time, the practice of mainstream Christianity largely declined, leading to a secularisation of public life. State patronage of the arts led to a boom in festivals, theatre, music and the visual arts. Tourism became a major industry, bringing still more foreign faces to Melbourne's streets. In 1956, the city became the first in the Southern Hemisphere to host the Olympic Games. Two new universities opened, Monash University in 1961 and La Trobe University in 1967, followed by others in the 1980s, maintaining Melbourne's place as a leader in tertiary education. =1980s-1990s= Increasing urban sprawl spread from Werribee in the south- west to Healesville in the north-east and encompassing much of the Mornington Peninsula and Dandenong Ranges to the south and east. A program of freeway construction was fast tracked in the 1970s and 1980s, while the expansion of rail and tram networks were neglected, aside from the opening of the City Loop in 1981. These factors led to the rapid growth of the number and use of private cars. =1989 financial crash= High interest rates and poor governance contributed to a financial crash in 1989. The collapse of merchant bank Tricontinental, Pyramid Building Society, businesses, property values and the forced sale of State Bank of Victoria led to a deep recession. Melbourne's population growth slowed during the early 1990s as employment contracted, with a rise in migration to other states such as Queensland. In turn this recession contributed to the fall of Joan Kirner's Labor government and the election in 1992 of a radical free-market Liberal government under Jeff Kennett. Kennett's team restored Victoria's finances by making sweeping cuts to public expenditure, closing many schools, privatising the tramways and electricity infrastructure, reducing the size of the public service, and local government restructuring. These reforms came at a high social cost, but ultimately restored confidence in Melbourne's economy and led to a resumption of growth. In 1999 Kennett was voted out of office, but key landmarks that his government commissioned, such as the Melbourne Exhibition and Convention Centre and the new Melbourne Museum, remain, and many of his reforms have been maintained. Partly as a result of the increasing difficulty of travelling across the city, the central business centre declined, and satellite suburbs such as Frankston, Dandenong and Ringwood, and further out Melton, Sunbury and Werribee, became centres of manufacturing, retailing and administration. As a result, industrial employment in the old working class inner suburbs declined, with these areas rapidly gentrifying in the 1990s and 2000s. By the end of the 20th century Melbourne had a population of 3.8 million people. 2000s Melbourne from above, 2005.

Aerial view of Melbourne's central business district A view of the Yarra River at twilight, with Melbourne's central business district on the left and Southbank on the right In the early years of the 21st century, Melbourne entered a new period of high economic and population growth under the more cautious Labor government of Steve Bracks, which restored public expenditure on health and education. As the city's suburbs continued to sprawl outwards, the Bracks government sought to restrict new suburban growth to designated growth corridors and encourage higher-density apartment living in the city's main transport hubs. The city's Central Business District experienced a major resurgence in the 2000s, aided by a large increase in inner-city apartment living, the opening of new public spaces such as Federation Square and the new Southern Cross railway station, a determined marketing campaign by Lord Mayor John So's City Council and continuing development of the Southbank and Docklands precincts. Since the late 2000s, population growth in Melbourne has been accelerating. Since the early 20th century, the city has been expanding outwards with low-density suburban urban forms to accommodate population growth. As this urban form is unsustainable, many sustainable alternatives have been proposed and implemented into policy to limit suburban sprawl, create transit-oriented urban environments and affordable housing and rent. However, in 2009 the Victorian Government announced plans to extend the city's urban growth boundary, potentially rezoning green wedges and agricultural land for housing development. Since 1997, Melbourne has maintained significant population and employment growth. There has been substantial international investment in the city's industries and property market. Major inner-city urban renewal has occurred in areas such as Southbank, Port Melbourne, Melbourne Docklands and more recently, South Wharf. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Melbourne sustained the highest population increase and economic growth rate of any Australian capital city in the three years ended June 2004. Despite lack of a progressive economy, general lack of government funding for public services such as public transport, and continued unsustainable urban growth, the city has seen sustained growth in its cultural institutions such as art, music, literature, performance, etc., as many contributors to and patrons of the arts relocate to Melbourne amongst excellent independent community support structures such as press and radio and a thriving cultural community. In 2003, Melbourne was named as a UNESCO City of Literature and the city hosts the majority of Australia's contemporary festivals, events and institutions, new galleries, music venues, museums, of all shapes and sizes are opening across the city. From 2006, the growth of the city extended into \\"green wedges\\" and beyond the city's Urban growth boundary. Predictions of the city's population reaching 5 million people pushed the state government to review the growth boundary in 2008 as part of its Melbourne @ Five Million strategy. Melbourne survived the financial crisis of 2007-2010 better than any other Australian city. In 2009, more new jobs were created in Melbourne than any other Australian capital ‚Äì almost as many as the next two fastest growing cities, Brisbane and Perth, combined.The Age, 12 February 2010 and Melbourne's property market remained strong, resulting in historically high property prices and widespread rent increases. In February 2010, The Transition Decade, an initiative to transition human society, economics and environment towards sustainability, was launched in the city.Beyond Zero Emissions.org Melbourne was voted the world's most liveable city for seven consecutive years (2011‚Äì2017) by the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The show was inspired by the 1964 film The Time Travelers (AIP/Dobil), and was creator-producer Irwin Allen's third science-fiction television series, released by 20th Century Fox Television and broadcast on ABC. The show ran for one season of 30 episodes from 1966 to 1967. A pilot for a new series was produced in 2002, but did not proceed to a series. A history of the series by Martin Grams Jr., was published in 2012.Martin Grams, Jr., The Time Tunnel: A History of the Television Program, (Duncan, OK: BearManor Media, 2012) Premise Project Tic-Toc is a top-secret U.S. government effort to build an experimental time machine, known as \\"The Time Tunnel\\" due to its appearance as a cylindrical hallway. The base for Project Tic-Toc is a huge, hidden underground complex in Arizona, 800 floors deep and employing more than 12,000 specialized personnel. The directors of the project are Dr. Douglas Phillips (Robert Colbert), Dr. Anthony Newman (James Darren), and Lt. General Heywood Kirk (Whit Bissell). The specialists assisting them are Dr. Raymond Swain (John Zaremba), a foremost expert in electronics, and Dr. Ann MacGregor (Lee Meriwether), an electrobiologist supervising the unit that determines how much force and heat a time traveler is able to withstand. The series is set in 1968, two years into the future of the actual broadcast season, 1966-67.The Time Tunnel: Volume One and The Time Tunnel: Volume Two DVD sets Doctors Newman, McGregor, and Phillips, 1966. Project Tic-Toc is in its tenth year when United States Senator Leroy Clark (Gary Merrill) comes to investigate to determine whether the project, which has cost $7.5 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ), is worth continuing. Senator Clark feels the project is a waste of government funds. When speaking to Phillips, Kirk, and Newman in front of the Time Tunnel, he delivers an ultimatum: either they send someone into time and return him during the course of his visit or their funding will cease. Tony volunteers for this endeavor, but he is turned down by project director Doug Phillips. Defying this decision, Tony sends himself into time. Doug follows shortly after to rescue him, but they both continue to be lost in time. Senator Clark returns to Washington with the promise that funding will not be cut off to the project, leaving General Kirk in charge. The stage is set for the progress of the series as Tony and Doug are now \\"switched\\" from one period in history to another, allowing episodes to be set in the past and future. Episodes 2‚Äì23 begin with the following narration (voiced by Dick Tufeld): Tony and Doug become participants in past events such as the sinking of the Titanic, the attack on Pearl Harbor, the eruption of Krakatoa, Custer's Last Stand, and the Battle of the Alamo among others. General Kirk, Ray, and Ann in the control room are able to locate them in time and space, observe them, communicate with them through voice contact, and send help. When the series was abruptly cancelled in the summer of 1967 by ABC, they had not filmed an episode in which Tony and Doug are safely returned to the Time Tunnel complex. Possibility of time travel Lee Meriwether as Dr. Ann MacGregor Time travel is facilitated by time being portrayed as a static continuum, accessible at any point through the Time Tunnel as a corridor spanning its infinite reaches. When Senator Clark sees an image of the Titanic on the image screen in the course of episode one, he is told by Dr. Swain that he is seeing \\"the living past\\", and Althea Hall is told by Tony Newman that the past and the future are the same. The Time Tunnel is also a portal connecting the Time Tunnel \\"complex\\" with the same time periods in which Doug and Tony are located. Other people can also be relocated by the Time Tunnel from their time to another time as Machiavelli is switched from his own time to the time of the Gettysburg Campaign of 1863. Bringing people (other than Tony and Doug) to the present happens often in the series, but the only occasion in which Tony and Doug return to their own time occurs in \\"Merlin the Magician\\", when the great wizard uses magic to bring them home in suspended animation so that he may instruct them to perform a mission for him. In the course of the series, Doug, Tony, and the Time Tunnel personnel discover that events of the past can be altered to some extent by the intrusion of the time travelers, and in a few cases, their historical research allows for it. Episode 26 (\\"Attack of the Barbarians\\") explores the scenario of one of the time travelers falling in love with someone from the past: Tony and the Princess Serit, daughter of Kublai Khan. Marco Polo tells Doug, \\"Can they not touch each other?\\" History itself hints at the possibility of Serit marrying Tony as Ann informs General Kirk. The historical information on Billy the Kid's victims alarms Ann, Ray, and the General, as it records that he killed two strangers near Lincoln, New Mexico, in April 1881‚Äîjust when Tony, Doug, and Billy the Kid are brought together. Production The production used sets, stock footage, and props left over from the large number of period dramas made by the 20th Century Fox film company. Even black-and-white shots purporting to show the Titanic sinking were tinted for use in this color production. Only a few actors were costumed for a given episode, interspersed with cuts of great masses of people similarly dressed from original features. Only one set was constructed for the show, that of the Time Tunnel main control room. For the pilot episode, a large control room set was built, and a longer Time Tunnel was created using optical matte shots. After the pilot episode, location changes occurred for the production of the series; Colbert and Darren shot their scenes in another studio, on the 20th Century Fox backlot, or on location, while those who portrayed the Time Tunnel personnel filmed all their scenes on a revised and smaller Time Tunnel control room set (due to the production having to use a smaller sound stage than used during the pilot filming). Some episodes featured space aliens who wore costumes and carried props originally created for other Irwin Allen television and film productions. Prop sets were similarly reused. The prop computer looked realistic because it was an array of memory modules from the Air Force's recently decommissioned SAGE computer. Continuity errors and errors in historical fact occurred in the series. In the premiere episode, \\"Rendezvous with Yesterday\\", Captain Smith of the Titanic is called \\"Malcolm\\" when, historically, his name was \\"Edward\\". The names of the secondary officers are also fictitious, though Walter Lord's best-selling nonfiction book about the event, A Night to Remember, had been released nine years earlier. Tony states that he was born in 1938. A few episodes later in \\"The Day the Sky Fell in\\", he states he was seven when Pearl Harbor was attacked on 7 December 1941, which would make the year of his birth 1934, or possibly 1933, if later than 7 December. The theme song for The Time Tunnel was composed by John Williams (credited as \\"Johnny Williams\\"). GNP Crescendo later released an album featuring Williams' work and the score composed by George Duning for the episode \\"The Death Merchant\\". The series won an Emmy Award in 1967, for Individual Achievements in Cinematography. The award went to L.B. \\"Bill\\" Abbott, for his photographic special effects. Recurring themes * A short \\"teaser\\" from next week's episode was shown at the end of each episode as Doug and Tony arrived at their next destination. There was one episode with an intriguing teaser that did not have to do with the next episode: Episode 3's ending teaser has a scene where Tony lands 10 years before 1968 in the desert, at the time tunnel complex. He tries to tell Doug that he works there and he knows him. Nothing more was made of it. This same technique was used in other Irwin Allen shows. * The impressive introduction to the scale of the project (over 36,000 people and huge underground buildings) is never seen after the first episode except for two clips (used over and over) of the giant power generator flashing, and Tunnel Security running across a walkway. Some of these shots were homages to the Krell complex from the classic 1956 MGM film Forbidden Planet, but new matte paintings and models were created specifically for The Time Tunnel pilot episode. * Most episodes involved the capture or detention of Doug, Tony, or both, their escape, their recapture, and their escape again, before their move to the next episode. * Nearly all location shooting was filmed in and around southern California. This causes scenes set in different parts of the country (or the world) to have the same general hilly landscape with arid-type trees and brush typical to the local region where filming occurred. * The majority of episodes placed Tony and Doug in stories set in past historical contexts. * Aliens and people from the future were similarly dressed, often in metallic silver clothing, like other Irwin Allen television series of the same era. * Many episodes used stock footage from previous 20th Century-Fox and Irwin Allen productions. These shots ran the gamut from episodes on General Custer, to the sinking of the Titanic, and many other historical events. Episodes While the episodes were first shown in 1966, the show's setting begins in 1968, two years into the then-future.The Time Tunnel: Volume One and The Time Tunnel: Volume Six DVD sets { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; background:white\\" - style=\\"color:white\\" ! style=\\"background:#3198FF; width:20px\\" No. ! style=\\"background:#3198FF\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#3198FF\\" Arrival date ! style=\\"background:#3198FF\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background:#3198FF\\" Written by ! style=\\"background:#3198FF\\" Arrival location ! style=\\"background:#3198FF; width:135px\\" Original air date } Cancellation Although The Time Tunnel was scheduled on Fridays (often considered the \\"death zone\\" for TV programs), the ratings for the series were solid and it looked very likely that the series would be renewed. ABC pointed to The Time Tunnel as one of the few successes in a disastrous schedule. An ABC executive gathered support for a series titled The Legend of Custer that he was in favor of and, since the fall schedule hadn't been announced, he lobbied to drop The Time Tunnel in favor of Custer. The Legend of Custer was quickly cancelled after airing 17 low-rated episodes, skewered by critics and performed worse than The Time Tunnel. Media =Novels= Murray Leinster promotional novel In January 1967 a promotional novel, The Time Tunnel, was published by Pyramid Books.Murray Leinster, The Time Tunnel, (New York: Pyramid Books, 1966), 144 pages. The author was Murray Leinster, who had previously written a novel of the same name in 1964, completely unrelated to the television series. Leinster used four of the main characters: Tony Newman, Doug Phillips, General Kirk, and Ann MacGregor as well as the initial antagonist Senator Clark. Unlike the television series, Project Tic-Toc is secretly begun and financed through the Defense Department without the consent of Congress. General Kirk is a retired Air Force General rather than an active duty Army General. Senator Clark, rather than urging immediate human time travel as he does in the TV series, demands that Project Tic-Toc refrain from going forward with it. He does this in the interests of humanity, which, in his view, would be adversely affected by a person from the future intruding into the past: ancestors of persons now living could be killed by a time traveler resulting in their descendants now living ceasing to exist or inventions and developments of the past being changed resulting in the wiping out of what exists in the present day.Murray Leinster, The Time Tunnel, (New York: Pyramid Books, 1966), 19-20. Tony and Doug's relocation to Johnstown, Pennsylvania just before the Johnstown Flood of May 31, 1889 allows them the opportunity of saving the life of Senator Clark's grandmother, Julie Bowen.Murray Leinster, The Time Tunnel, (New York: Pyramid Books, 1966), 70-74. If Tony and Doug had not gone back in time and saved her, Senator Clark would have ceased to exist. The second time and place Tony and Doug are relocated to is the Texas prairie near Adobe Walls, Texas, June 26, 1874. They are picked up by a traveling group of hunters tracking bison at the scene of the massacre of another group of bison hunters by Comanche warriors. Tony and Doug travel with them to Adobe Walls just in time for the historic battle on June 27. Knowing about the impending attack and the incident of the cracking of the ridgepole of the sod roof of Hanrahan's saloon where Tony and Doug were staying, they caused the cracking themselves by shooting at the pole. This effectively awakened the sleeping hunters, making them ready to repulse the attack of the Native American warriors.Murray Leinster, The Time Tunnel, (New York: Pyramid Books, 1966), 102. Tony and Doug were able to assist the historic Bat Masterson in his exploits in the battle. Tony and Doug's final adventure before being returned to the Time Tunnel took them to Saint Louis, Missouri sometime in the distant future.Murray Leinster, The Time Tunnel, (New York: Pyramid Books, 1966), 131. The American populace is menaced by aliens setting up a force field. Tony and Doug were able to utilize a vehicle capable of moving in both time and space developed by the Time Tunnel while they were in Adobe Walls. It is a floating platform with rails operated by Ann MacGregor back in the Time Tunnel control room. They appear to anyone seeing them as people riding on a flying carpet. In the Saint Louis library Doug finds out that he will marry Ann MacGregor, who is in love with him, and they will have three children. With the help of the \\"time traveler\\" platform they are able to destroy the flimsy alien craft and return to the Time Tunnel complex. Other novelizations This was followed later in the year by Timeslip: Time Tunnel Adventure #2, the last novel based on the TV series. The front and back covers feature photos from the series. In Time Bomb, an experimental nuclear missile was sent through the Time Tunnel - but something went wrong, and it wound up at the bottom of a pond within Mexico City, in the 1840s. In the present (1968), excavation equipment was moving toward the site - any day a bulldozer blade might set it off, destroying a mighty city and plunging the world into war. Time travelers Tony Newman and Doug Phillips had only one chance to head off disaster - to go through the Time Tunnel and make the accident \\"unhappen.\\" The trouble was, there was a war on in the past - and the bomb was in enemy territory. =Comic books= There were two issues put out by Gold Key Comics (Western Publishing Co.) in 1966-1967. These were reprinted by Hermes Press in 2012. In Issue #1: * The Time Tunnel: The Assassins - April 14, 1865, Abe gets a second chance. * The Lion or the Volcano? - August 24, 79 A.D., Pompeii.

After the original run In 1982, five feature-length television films were assembled from 10 complete individual episodes with portions of the first episode as introductory material. Aliens From Another Planet, was produced using episodes 24 (\\"Chase Through Time\\") and 18 (\\"Visitors From Beyond The Stars\\"). Revenge Of The Gods was a compilation of episodes 7 (\\"Revenge of the Gods\\") and 20 (\\"The Walls Of Jericho). Old Legends Never Die edited together episodes 27 (\\"Merlin The Magician\\") and 16 (\\"The Revenge Of Robin Hood\\"). Kill Or Be Killed comprised episodes 4 (\\"The Day The Sky Fell In\\") and 17 (\\"Kill Two By Two\\"). Raiders From The Moon was compiled from episodes 28 (\\"The Kidnappers\\") and 2 (\\"One Way To The Moon\\"). In the U.S., they can now be seen on the Encore Action cable network at various times. The films were made available to stations in two formats, a 100 minute length for a 2-hour slot, and a 75-minute length for a 90 minute slot. The original series, from Labor Day 2016 to Memorial Day 2017, was shown on MeTV as part of their \\"Red-Eye Sci-Fi\\". Remakes To date, two attempts have been made to resurrect the show. One produced a pilot episode, and another got no further than a script. =2002 remake= In 2002, Fox showed interest in remaking this series. A pilot was produced by Twentieth Century Fox Television, Fox Television Studios, and Regency Television in association with Irwin Allen Properties. Kevin Burns and Jon Jashni were executive producers. Sheila Allen was credited as one of the producers. The series was not ordered by Fox so as to make room in its schedule for Joss Whedon's Firefly. The pilot had a darker and more serious tone than the original 1966 series. Doug Phillips (David Conrad) is the main character, and Tony Newman's character was replaced by Toni Newman, a minor female character. The unaired pilot episode is available on DVD from Fox Home Entertainment on The Time Tunnel: Volume Two, Disc Four. In this remake, the 2002 Time Tunnel is a Department of Energy research project into nuclear fusion, which produces nearly limitless energy. When the reactor was initiated (not shown in the episode), that caused an unintended \\"time storm\\" which uncontrollably changed history. The DOE was able to anchor one end of the storm by using the Tunnel like a lightning rod. On their way into the tunnel complex, Flynn tells Doug Phillips, a former friend, that the latter has been recruited because he has a detailed knowledge of the Battle of H√ºrtgen Forest. The head of the Time Tunnel project likens their team to FEMA‚Äîthey don't send a team back for a rain storm but they do for hurricanes. However, they can only go through time to where the other end of the storm is at the current moment, so they have a limited period to fix what is wrong and to be retrieved by the Time Tunnel. The team (Doug, Toni, Flynn, J.D., and Wix) must travel to the Battle of H√ºrtgen Forest in 1944 Germany during World War II. They plan to retrieve a person moved there by the time storm from 1546. During the mission, Doug Phillips meets his grandfather, a soldier who will be killed in the battle. Doug knows this, but cannot tell his ancestor and save his life because it would change history. Toni Newman tells Doug she used to have three brothers and two sisters before the time storm accident but is now an only child. The time travelers learn the displaced person is a now-confused medieval monk who carries bubonic plague. When the team is almost captured, two members switch to German uniforms and pretend to be Colonel Klink and (Sergeant) Schultz, complete with fake documents. Everyone who came in contact with the monk is given an antibiotic injection and the time ripples stop. But Flynn has been fatally stabbed, so he reveals Phillips was a bitter man before the time storm, but he now has a family. Flynn tells Phillips this information to give him an incentive to keep the timeline intact.The Time Tunnel: Volume Two, Disc Four, side B Reality changes due to the time storm There are some notable differences between the series world and the real world: *Traffic lights use red for \\"go\\" and green for \\"stop\\" while yellow retains its meaning. *There are 49 states in the United States. The title sequence shows New Jersey disappearing and the territory being divided between New York and Pennsylvania. *The title sequence shows the Soviet Union winning the race to the moon as the American flag dissolves into the Soviet flag. *The New York Yankees are now the Boston Yankees. =2006 remake= The SciFi Channel announced in 2005 it would create a new pilot for its 2006/07 season. Allen's wife, Sheila, and two producers of the 2002 FOX remake (Kevin Burns and Jon Jashni) began work on the new pilot. John Turman (Hulk) wrote the script.IMDb link for 2007 series The series never went beyond a pilot script. Parodies A recurring sketch called Drunk In Time starred Alexei Sayle and Peter Capaldi as two men so inebriated that they weren't aware they were time travellers. Featuring a mock up of the original Project Tic-Toc set and animated Time Tunnel-style title sequence, the main characters are also called Doug and Tony. The six sketches featured in The All New Alexei Sayle Show in 1995.

It was released in 1982. Overview The drive spins a PET film floppy disk at about 3000 rpm, 1 Œºm over a read-write head, using Bernoulli's principle to pull the flexible disk towards the head as long as the disk is spinning. In theory this makes the Bernoulli drive more reliable than a contemporary hard disk drive, since a head crash is impossible. The original Bernoulli disks came in capacities of 5, 10, and 20 MB. They are roughly 21 cm by 27.5 cm, similar to the size of a sheet of A4 paper. The most popular system was the Bernoulli Box II, whose disk cases are 13.6 cm wide, 14 cm long and 0.9 cm thick, somewhat resembling a 3-inch standard floppy disk but in 5-inch form factor. Bernoulli Box II disks came in the following capacities: 20 MB, 35 MB, 44 MB, 65 MB, 90 MB (late 1980s), 105 MB, 150 MB, and in 1993, 230 MB. There are five types of drives, grouped by the maximum readable capacity: 20 MB, 44 MB, 90 MB, 150 MB, and 230 MB. The interface is usually SCSI. Drives were available as either internal units, which fit into standard 5-inch drive bays, or as external units with one or two drives in a self- contained case connected to the host computer via external SCSI connector. The disks have a physical switch similar to that on 3-inch standard floppy disks to enable and disable write protection. Reception PC Magazine in 1984 stated that the Bernoulli Box \\"... combines the advantages of [standard] floppy- and hard-disk systems without their drawbacks.\\" It reported no software-compatibility problems and cited the box's durable design. Bruce Webster of BYTE wrote favorably of the peripheral in February 1986, reporting that \\"I have not had a single glitch or lost file\\" in nine months of constant use. Successors Iomega's later removable-storage products such as the Zip floppy disk and Jaz and Rev removable hard disks do not use the Bernoulli technology.

They most often occur at the back of the wrist followed by the front of the wrist. Onset is often over months. Typically there are no further symptoms. Occasionally pain or numbness may occur. Complications may include carpal tunnel syndrome. The cause is unknown. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve an outpouching of the synovial membrane. Risk factors include gymnastics. Diagnosis is typically based on examination with light shining through the lesion being supportive. Medical imaging may be done to rule out other potential causes. Treatment options include watchful waiting, splinting the affected joint, needle aspiration, or surgery. About half the time they resolve on their own. About 3 per 10,000 people newly develop ganglion of the wrist or hand a year. They most commonly occur in young and middle aged females. Trying to treat the lesion by hitting it with a book is discouraged. Signs and symptoms The average size of these cysts is 2.0 cm, but excised cysts of more than 5 cm have been reported. The size of the cyst may vary over time and may increase after activity. =Sites= These cysts most frequently occur around the dorsum of the wrist and on the fingers. A common site of the occurrence is along the extensor carpi radialis brevis, as it passes over the dorsum of the wrist joint. Although most commonly found in the wrist, ganglion cysts also may occur in the foot. Ganglion cysts are \\"commonly observed in association with the joints and tendons of the appendicular skeleton, with 88% 'in communication with the multiple small joints of the hand and wrist' and 11% with those of the foot and ankle.\\" They commonly are found near the wrist joint, especially at the scapho-lunate area. In a 2007 study of patients in Glasgow whose foot lumps were being removed surgically, 39 of 101 cases were ganglion cysts. The study replicated earlier findings that no ganglion cysts were found on the sole or heel of the foot; the authors wrote that \\"Although lumps in these areas may be ganglia, the surgeon should probably consider other diagnoses in the first instance.\\" The researchers also noted a marked preponderance of occurrence among females (85%) and that 11 of the other cases had been misdiagnosed as ganglion cysts before surgery. Ganglion cysts are not limited to the hands and feet. They may occur near the knee, commonly near the cruciate ligaments, but also they may occur at the origins of the gastrocnemius tendon and, anteriorly, on Hoffa's infrapatellar fat pad. At the shoulder, they typically occur at the acromioclavicular joint or along the biceps tendon.Arend CF. Ultrasound of the Shoulder. Master Medical Books, 2013. Sample chapter available on acromioclavicular joint ganglion . From their common origin at a joint or tendon, ganglion cysts may form in a wide range of locations. Rarely, intraosseous ganglion cysts occur, sometimes in combination with a cyst in the overlying soft tissue. (includes MRI images) Very rare cases of intramuscular ganglion cysts in the gastrocnemius muscle of the calf have been reported. It is possible for a cyst to be displaced considerably from its connection to the joint. In one extreme case, a ganglion cyst was observed to propagate extensively via the conduit of the common peroneal nerve sheath to a location in the thigh; in such cases surgery to the proximal joint to remove the articular connection may remove the need for a riskier, more extensive surgery in the neural tissue of the thigh. The cysts may intrude into the spine, which may cause pain and dysesthesia in distant extremities. It has been proposed recently that cystic adventitial disease, in which a cyst occurs within the popliteal artery near the knee, may occur by an articular mechanism, with a conduit leading from the joint, similar to the development of ganglion cysts, that spreads within the peroneal nerve. Cysts that were compressing one or more nerves and causing bone erosions have been reported to occur near the shoulder joint. Cyst_Profile2.JPGCyst on right wrist Ganglion Cyst on Foot.jpgCyst on dorsum of right foot Kyste420.jpgCyst on a finger Ganglion Cyst On Right Index Finger.jpgSmall cyst on right index finger Ganglion_cyst_lanced.JPGsmall cyst on thumb lanced with red-hot needle File:Ganglion Cyst on the palmar side of the left wrist.jpgGanglion cyst on the palmar side of the left wrist Cause The most commonly accepted probable cause of ganglion cysts is the \\"herniation hypothesis\\", by which they are thought to occur as \\"an out-pouching or distention of a weakened portion of a joint capsule or tendon sheath.\\" This description is based on the observations that the cysts occur close to tendons and joints. The microscopic anatomy of the cyst resembles that of tenosynovial tissue, the fluid being similar in composition to synovial fluid. Dye injected into the joint capsule frequently ends up in the cyst, which may become enlarged after activity. Dye injected into the cyst rarely enters the joint, however, which has been attributed to the apparent formation of an effective and one-way \\"check valve\\", allowing fluid out of the joint, but not back in. In synovials, posttraumatic degeneration of connective tissue and inflammation have been considered as causes. Other possible mechanisms for the development of ganglion cysts include repeated mechanical stress, facet arthrosis, myxoid degeneration of periarticular fibrous tissues and liquefaction with chronic damage, increased production of hyaluronic acid by fibroblasts, and a proliferation of mesenchymal cells. Ganglion cysts also may develop independently from a joint. (original source cites eight additional references for the quoted paragraph) Diagnosis Ganglion cyst of the hand with multiple cystic chambers containing glairy material - the walls are composed of bland fibrous tissue with no specialized lining Ganglion cysts are diagnosed easily, as they are visible and pliable to touch. Radiographs in AP and lateral views should be obtained to exclude any more serious underlying pathology. Ultrasonography (US) may be used to increase diagnostic confidence in clinically suspected lesions or to depict occult cysts, because intratendinous ganglia are readily distinguished from extratendinous ganglia during dynamic ultrasonography, as microscopically, ganglionic cysts are thin- walled cysts containing clear, mucinous fluid. Treatment If a person is not in pain, they should simply be reassured that the lump is not cancerous, and wait for the lump to disappear on its own. At least 33% resolve without treatment within six years, and 50% within 10 years. Surgical treatments remain the primary elective option for treatment of ganglion cysts. The progression of ganglion surgery worldwide is to use an arthroscopic or mini- opening method.Bismil MSK, Bismil QMK. The wide awake approach to hand and wrist ganglia: Ten-year experience, technical tips and review of macroscopic pathology and outcomes of 300 cases. OA Case Reports 2013 Nov 15;2(13):129. Alternatively, a hypodermic needle may be used to drain the fluid from the cyst (via aspiration) and a corticosteroid may be injected after the cyst is empty; however, if the fluid has thickened, owing to the passage of time, this treatment is not always effective. There is a recurrence rate of approximately 50% following needle drainage (via aspiration) of ganglion cysts. A historical method of treatment for a ganglion cyst was to strike the lump with a large and heavy book, causing the cyst to rupture and drain into the surrounding tissues. Historically, a Bible was the largest or only book in any given household, and was employed for this treatment. This led to the former nickname of \\"Bible bumps\\" or \\"Gideon's disease\\" for these cysts. This treatment risks injuring the person and thus is not recommended. =Complications= Complications of treatment may include joint stiffness and scar formation. Recurrence of the lesion is more common following excision of a volar ganglion cyst in the wrist. Incomplete excision that fails to include the stalk or pedicle also may lead to recurrence, as will failing to execute a layered closure of the incision.Camasta, Craig A., DPM, Excision of the Ganglion Cyst , podiatryinstitute.com, update 1993, 1993 33 pdf, pages 181‚Äì5 Prognosis Recurrence rate is higher in aspirated cysts than in excised ones. Ganglion cysts have been found to recur following surgery in 12% to 41% of patients. A six-year outcome study of the treatment of ganglion cysts on the dorsum (back) of the wrist compared excision, aspiration, and no treatment. Neither excision nor aspiration provided long-term benefit better than no treatment. Of the untreated ganglion cysts, 58% resolved spontaneously; the post-surgery recurrence rate in this study was 39%. A similar study in 2003 of ganglion cysts occurring on the palmar surface of the wrist states: \\"At 2 and 5 year follow-up, regardless of treatment, no difference in symptoms was found, regardless of whether the palmar wrist ganglion was excised, aspirated or left alone.\\" Etymology Being a misnomer that has persisted into modern times, (see the entry for aneurysmal bone cyst, which \\"like pyogenic granuloma and ganglion cyst, a misnomer that has withstood the sands of time and the dint of logic\\") the ganglion cyst is unrelated to the neural \\"ganglion\\" or \\"ganglion cell\\"; its etymology traces back to the ancient Greek Œ≥Œ¨Œ≥Œ≥ŒªŒπŒøŒΩ, a \\"knot\\" or \\"swelling beneath the skin\\", which extends to the neural masses by analogy. Generally, Hippocrates is credited with the description of these cysts.See Hippocrates' \\"On the Articulations\\" (part 40) at Wikisource The term \\"Bible cyst\\" (or \\"Bible bump\\") is derived from an urban legend or historical effort to hit the cyst with a Bible. Trying to treat the lesion by hitting it with a book is however discouraged.

Its buildings, in Greenwich, London, were later used by the Royal Naval College, Greenwich and the University of Greenwich, and are now known as the Old Royal Naval College. The word \\"hospital\\" was used in its original sense of a place providing hospitality for those in need of it, and did not refer to medical care, although the buildings included an infirmary which, after Greenwich Hospital closed, operated as Dreadnought Seaman's Hospital until 1986. The foundation which operated the hospital still exists, for the benefit of former Royal Navy personnel and their dependants. It now provides sheltered housing on other sites. History The hospital was created as the Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich on the instructions of Queen Mary II, who had been inspired by the sight of wounded sailors returning from the Battle of La Hogue in 1692. She ordered the King Charles wing of the palace‚Äîoriginally designed by architect John Webb for King Charles II in 1664‚Äîto be remodelled as a naval hospital to provide a counterpart for the Chelsea Hospital for soldiers. Sir Christopher Wren and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor gave their services free of charge as architects of the new Royal Hospital. Sir John Vanbrugh succeeded Wren as architect, completing the complex to Wren's original plans.J. Bold, P. Guillery, D. Kendall, Greenwich: an architectural history of the Royal Hospital for Seamen and the Queen's House (Yale University Press) 2001. The Painted Hall An early controversy arose when it emerged that the original plans for the hospital would have blocked the riverside view from the Queen's House. Queen Mary II therefore ordered that the buildings be split, providing an avenue leading from the river through the hospital grounds up to the Queen's House and Greenwich Hill beyond. This gave the hospital its distinctive look, with its buildings arranged in a number of quadrants. Its four main buildings (the \\"Courts\\") are bisected north‚Äìsouth by a Grand Square and processional route, and east‚Äìwest by an internal road from the East Gate (and gate-house) to the West Gate (and gate-house) by Greenwich Market in Greenwich town centre. The Grand Square and processional route running north‚Äìsouth maintained access to, and a river view from, the Queen's House and Greenwich Park beyond. Construction was financed through an endowment, financed through the transfer of ¬£19,500 in fines paid by merchants convicted of smuggling in 1695, a public fundraising appeal which brought in ¬£9,000, and a ¬£2,000 annual contribution from Treasury. Parliament passed the Greenwich Hospital, etc. Act 1695 (7 & 8 Will. 3 c. 21), long titled An Act for the Increase and Encouragement of Seamen, which established the basic rules of use and benefits for seamen, and amended it the following year by the Greenwich Hospital, etc. Act 1696. In 1705 an additional ¬£6,472 was paid into the fund, comprising the liquidated value of estates belonging to the recently hanged pirate Captain William Kidd. The first of the principal buildings constructed was the King Charles Court (the oldest part dating back to the restoration), completed in March 1705. The other principal buildings constructed included Queen Mary Court (planned by Wren and Hawksmoor, but not built until after Wren's death, by Thomas Ripley), completed in 1742, Queen Anne Court (architects: Wren and Hawksmoor), and King William Court (designed by Wren, but completed by Hawksmoor and Sir John Vanbrugh). James Stuart after a fire Queen Mary Court houses the hospital's chapel (designed by Wren but not completed until 1742). Its present appearance dates from 1779‚Äì89, when it was rebuilt to a design by James \\"Athenian\\" Stuart after a devastating fire. The ornate plasterwork was created by John Papworth. King William Court is famous for its baroque Painted Hall, which was painted by Sir James Thornhill in honour of King William III and Queen Mary II (the ceiling of the Lower Hall), of Queen Anne and her husband, Prince George of Denmark (the ceiling of the Upper Hall) and George I (the north wall of the Upper Hall). The Painted Hall was deemed too magnificent for the pensioned seamen's refectory and was never regularly used as such. It became a tourist destination, opened for viewing. On 5 January 1806, Lord Nelson's body lay in state in the Painted Hall of the Greenwich Hospital before being taken up the river Thames to St Paul's Cathedral for a state funeral. In 1824 a National Gallery of Naval Art was created in the Painted Hall, where it remained until 1936, when the collection was transferred to the National Maritime Museum, newly established in the Queen's House and adjacent buildings. On the riverside front of the north-east corner of King Charles Court is an obelisk, designed by Philip Hardwick and unveiled in 1855, erected in memory of the Arctic explorer Joseph Ren√© Bellot, who died in an unsuccessful attempt to rescue the members of John Franklin's ill-fated expedition to open a Northwest Passage in northern Canada. The first governor, Sir William Gifford, took up office in 1708. In 1774, the then Lieutenant Governor, Captain Thomas Baillie made allegations of mismanagement of the hospital's affairs, which led to a celebrated court case. A Royal Hospital School opened on the site in 1712 to provide assistance and education to the orphans of seafarers in the Royal and Merchant Navies. In 1933 it moved to Holbrook, Suffolk (where it remains today); the old school buildings were reopened the following year as the National Maritime Museum. The Greenwich Hospital buildings included an infirmary, constructed in the 1760s to a design also by James Stuart, where pensioners were attended by trained medical staff (Sir John Liddell was for a time senior medical officer). After some adaptation and rebuilding this became the Dreadnought Seamen's Hospital in 1870 (taking its name from a hospital ship moored off Greenwich). The treatment for tropical diseases moved in 1919 to the Seamen's Hospital Society hospital near Euston Square, in central London, to form the Hospital for Tropical Diseases. The Dreadnought Seaman's Hospital closed in 1986, with special services for seamen and their families then provided by the Dreadnought Unit at St Thomas's Hospital in Lambeth. Greenwich Hospital closed in 1869, with the buildings being taken over by the Royal Naval College, Greenwich until 1998. Due to railway construction, the remains of thousands of sailors and officers, including many of those who had fought in the Battle of Trafalgar, were removed from the hospital site in 1875 and reinterred in East Greenwich Pleasaunce also called Pleasaunce Park (named after the former Palace of Placentia which had been on the site of the hospital).Park Explorer- East Greenwich Pleasaunce ,‚Äì East Greenwich Pleasaunce Governors Sir Thomas Hardy in Chapel at Greenwich's Old Royal Naval College.

It is now a Royal Charity for the benefit of seafarers and their dependants, with the Secretary of State for Defence acting as The Crown's sole trustee. The charity now funds sheltered housing for former Royal Navy personnel and the school it spawned, the Royal Hospital School, now at Holbrook in Suffolk. The charity's head office is located in the City of London. Greenwich Hospital The charity derives some of its funds from properties in and around the hospital site. The core hospital buildings are let on a 150-year lease to the University of Greenwich and Trinity Laban College of Music. Greenwich Promenade is let to the Port of London Authority, while retail and residential properties in central Greenwich, including Greenwich Market, form the charity's core investment portfolio. In August 2020, several market traders warned they might have to cease trading after Greenwich Hospital's managing agent Knight Frank informed them of steep rent increases.

The bulk of the language in spoken and written texts is from this source. As a statistical rule, around 70 percent of words in any text are Anglo-Saxon. Moreover, the grammar is largely Anglo- Saxon.Fennell, Barbara 1998. A history of English. A sociolinguistic approach. Oxford: Blackwell. A significant portion of the English vocabulary comes from Romance and Latinate sources. Estimates of native words (derived from Old English) range from 20%-33%, with the rest made up of outside borrowings. A portion of these borrowings come directly from Latin, or through one of the Romance languages, particularly Anglo-Norman and French, but some also from Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish; or from other languages (such as Gothic, Frankish or Greek) into Latin and then into English. The influence of Latin in English, therefore, is primarily lexical in nature, being confined mainly to words derived from Latin roots.McWhorter, Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue, 2008, pp. 89‚Äì136. While some new words enter English as slang, most do not. Some words are adopted from other languages; some are mixtures of existing words (portmanteau words), and some are new creations made of roots from dead languages. Word origins  A computerized survey of about 80,000 words in the old Shorter Oxford Dictionary (3rd ed.) was published in Ordered Profusion by Thomas Finkenstaedt and Dieter Wolff (1973) that estimated the origin of English words as follows: * French: 28.30% * Latin, including modern scientific and technical Latin: 28.24% * Germanic languages ‚Äì inherited from Old English, from Proto-Germanic, or a more recent borrowing from a Germanic language such as Old Norse; does not include Germanic words borrowed from a Romance language, i.e., coming from the Germanic element in French, Latin or other Romance languages: 25% * Greek: 5.32% * No etymology given: 4.04% * Derived from proper names: 3.28% * All other languages: less than 1% A survey by Joseph M. Williams in Origins of the English Language of 10,000 words taken from several thousand business letters gave this set of statistics: * French (langue d'o√Øl): 41% * \\"Native\\" English: 33% * Latin: 15% * Old Norse: 5% * Dutch: 1% * Other: 5%Origins Languages influencing the English language Here is a list of the most common foreign language influences in English, where other languages have influenced or contributed words to English. =Celtic= Words are almost absent, except for dialectal words, such as the Yan Tan Tethera system of counting sheep. However, hypotheses have been made that English syntax was influenced by Celtic languages, such as the system of continuous tenses was a clich√© of similar Celtic phrasal structures; this is controversial, as the system has clear native English and other Germanic developments. =French= The French contributed legal, military, technological, and political terminology. Their language also contributed common words, such as the names of meats: veal, mutton, beef, pork, and how food was prepared: boil, broil, fry, roast, and stew; as well as words related to the nobility: prince, duke, marquess, viscount, baron, and their feminine equivalents. Nearly 30 percent of English words (in an 80,000 word dictionary) are of French origin. =Latin= Scientific and technical words, medical terminology, academic and legal terminology. =Greek= Scientific and medical terminology (for instance -phobias and -ologies), Christian theological terminology. =Norman= Castle, cauldron, kennel, catch, cater are among Norman words introduced into English. The Norman language also introduced (or reinforced) words of Norse origin such as mug. =Dutch= There are many ways through which Dutch words have entered the English language: via trade and navigation, such as skipper (from schipper), freebooter (from vrijbuiter), keelhauling (from kielhalen); via painting, such as landscape (from landschap), easel (from ezel), still life (from stilleven); warfare, such as forlorn hope (from verloren hoop), beleaguer (from beleger), to bicker (from bicken); via civil engineering, such as dam, polder, dune (from duin); via the New Netherland settlements in North America, such as cookie (from koekie), boss from baas, Santa Claus (from Sinterklaas); via Dutch/Afrikaans speakers with English speakers in South Africa, such as wildebeest, apartheid, boer; via French words of Dutch/Flemish origin that have subsequently been adopted into English, such as boulevard (from bolwerk), mannequin (from manneken), buoy (from boei). =Spanish= Words from Iberian Romance languages (aficionado, albino, alligator, cargo, cigar, embargo, guitar, jade, mesa, paella, platinum, plaza, renegade, rodeo, salsa, savvy, sierra, siesta, tilde, tornado, vanilla etc.). Words relating to warfare and tactics, for instance flotilla, and guerrilla; or related to science and culture. Words originated in Amerindian civilizations (Cariban: cannibal, hurricane; Mescalero: apache; Nahuatl: tomato, coyote, chocolate; Quechua: potato; Ta√≠no: tobacco), =Italian= Words relating to some music, piano, fortissimo. Or Italian culture, such as piazza, pizza, gondola, balcony, fascism. The English word umbrella comes from Italian ombrello. =Indian languages= Words relating to culture, originating from the colonial era. Many of these words are of Persian origin rather than Hindi because Persian was the official language of the Mughal courts. e.g., pyjamas, bungalow, verandah, jungle, curry, khaki. =German= English is a Germanic language. As a result, many words are distantly related to German. Most German words relating to World War I and World War II found their way into the English language, words such as Blitzkrieg, Anschluss, F√ºhrer, and Lebensraum; food terms, such as bratwurst, hamburger and frankfurter; words related to psychology and philosophy, such a gestalt, √úbermensch, zeitgeist, and realpolitik. From German origin are also: wanderlust, schadenfreude, kaputt, kindergarten, autobahn, rucksack. =Old Norse= Words of Old Norse origin have entered English primarily from the contact between Old Norse and Old English during colonisation of eastern and northern England between the mid 9th to the 11th centuries (see also Danelaw). Many of these words are part of English core vocabulary, such as they, egg, sky or knife. =Hebrew and Yiddish= Words used in religious contexts, like Sabbath, kosher, hallelujah, amen, and jubilee or words that have become slang like schmuck, shmooze, nosh, oy vey, and schmutz. =Arabic= Trade items such as borax, coffee, cotton, hashish, henna, mohair, muslin, saffron; Islamic religious terms such as jihad, hadith and sharia; scientific vocabulary borrowed into Latin in the 12th and 13th centuries (alcohol, alkali, algebra, azimuth, cipher, nadir); plants or plant products originating in tropical Asia and introduced to medieval Europe through Arabic intermediation (camphor, jasmine, lacquer, lemon, orange, sugar); Middle Eastern cuisine words (couscous, falafel, hummus, kebab, tahini). Counting Cardinal numbering in English follows two models, Germanic and Italic. The basic numbers are zero through ten. The numbers eleven through nineteen follow native Germanic style, as do twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, and ninety. Standard English, especially in very conservative formal contexts, continued to use native Germanic style as late as World War I for intermediate numbers greater than 20, viz., \\"one-and-twenty,\\" \\"five-and-thirty,\\" \\"seven-and-ninety,\\" and so on. But with the advent of the Industrial Revolution, the Latin tradition of counting as \\"twenty-one,\\" \\"thirty-five,\\" \\"ninety-seven,\\" etc., which is easier to say and was already common in non-standard regional dialects, gradually replaced the traditional Germanic style to become the dominant style by the end of nineteenth century.  Opposition  Linguistic purism in the English language is the belief that words of native origin should be used instead of foreign-derived ones (which are mainly Romantic, Latin and Greek). \\"Native\\" can mean \\"Anglo-Saxon\\" or it can be widened to include all Germanic words. In its mild form, it merely means using existing native words instead of foreign- derived ones (such as using \\"begin\\" instead of \\"commence\\"). In its more extreme form, it involves reviving native words that are no longer widely used (such as \\"ettle\\" for \\"intend\\") and/or coining new words from Germanic roots (such as word stock for vocabulary). This dates at least to the inkhorn term debate of the 16th and 17th century, where some authors rejected the foreign influence, and has continued to this day, being most prominent in Plain English advocacy to avoid Latinate terms if a simple native alternative exists.

In early 1997 it was claimed on ITV's World in Action McLagan & Lowles, Mr. Evil, pp. 63-64 that the original leader of Combat 18 Charlie Sargent, who at the time was on remand for the murder of fellow C18 member Chris Castle, had acted as a paid informant for the police, although no evidence for this allegation was provided. Whilst Sargent was disowned by some of the rank and file membership of C18, his brother Steve, also a C18 member, supported Sargent and together with David Myatt led away fifty or so like-minded members to form a separate group, the National Socialist Movement, in June 1997.

The stations grew out of imitations of Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem which is believed to be the actual path Jesus walked to Mount Calvary. The object of the stations is to help the Christian faithful to make a spiritual pilgrimage through contemplation of the Passion of Christ. It has become one of the most popular devotions and the stations can be found in many Western Christian churches, including Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Roman Catholic. Commonly, a series of 14 images will be arranged in numbered order along a path and the faithful travel from image to image, in order, stopping at each station to say the selected prayers and reflections. This will be done individually or in a procession most commonly during Lent, especially on Good Friday, in a spirit of reparation for the sufferings and insults that Jesus endured during his passion.Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices The style, form, and placement of the stations vary widely. The typical stations are small plaques with reliefs or paintings placed around a church nave. Modern minimalist stations can be simple crosses with a numeral in the centre. Occasionally the faithful might say the stations of the cross without there being any image, such as when the pope leads the stations of the cross around the Colosseum in Rome on Good Friday.  History  Three chapels of Verkiai Calvary Shrine of Our Lady of F√°tima, in Portugal Gennadiy Jerszow - 15 relief images (bronze) Basilica of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. Gda≈Ñsk, Poland Outdoor station in Ji≈ôet√≠n pod Jedlovou Typical indoor placement along the nave (Hong Kong Catholic Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception) The Stations of the Cross originated in pilgrimage to Jerusalem and a desire to reproduce the Via Dolorosa. Imitating holy places was not a new concept. For example, the religious complex of Santo Stefano in Bologna, Italy, replicated the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and other religious sites, including Mount of Olives and Valley of Josaphat. After the siege of 1187, Jerusalem fell to the forces of Saladin, the first sultan of Egypt and Syria. Forty years later Franciscans were allowed back into the Holy Land. Their founder, Saint Francis of Assisi, held the Passion of Christ in special veneration and is said to have been the first person to receive stigmata. In 1217, St. Francis also founded the Custody of the Holy Land to guard and promote the devotion to holy places. Their efforts were recognized when Franciscans were officially proclaimed custodians of holy places by Pope Clement VI in 1342. Although several travelers who visited the Holy Land during the 12‚Äì14th centuries (e.g. Riccoldo da Monte di Croce, Burchard of Mount Sion, James of Verona), mention a \\"Via Sacra\\", i.e. a settled route that pilgrims followed, there is nothing in their accounts to identify this with the Way of the Cross, as we understand it. The earliest use of the word \\"stations\\", as applied to the accustomed halting-places in the Via Sacra at Jerusalem, occurs in the narrative of an English pilgrim, William Wey, who visited the Holy Land in the mid-15th century, and described pilgrims following the footsteps of Christ to the cross. In 1521, a book called Geystlich Strass (German: \\"spiritual road\\") was printed with illustrations of the stations in the Holy Land. During the 15th and 16th centuries the Franciscans began to build a series of outdoor shrines in Europe to duplicate their counterparts in the Holy Land. The number of stations varied between seven and thirty; seven was common. These were usually placed, often in small buildings, along the approach to a church, as in a set of 1490 by Adam Kraft, leading to the Johanniskirche in Nuremberg.Schiller, Gertrud, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II, p. 82, 1972 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, A number of rural examples were established as attractions in their own right, usually on attractive wooded hills. These include the Sacro Monte di Domodossola (1657) and Sacro Monte di Belmonte (1712), and form part of the Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy World Heritage Site, together with other examples on different devotional themes. In these the sculptures are often approaching life-size and very elaborate. Remnants of these are often referred to as calvary hills. In 1686, in answer to their petition, Pope Innocent XI granted to the Franciscans the right to erect stations within their churches. In 1731, Pope Clement XII extended to all churches the right to have the stations, provided that a Franciscan father erected them, with the consent of the local bishop. At the same time the number was fixed at fourteen. In 1857, the bishops of England were allowed to erect the stations by themselves, without the intervention of a Franciscan priest, and in 1862 this right was extended to bishops throughout the church.The Catholic Encyclopedia (1907). s.v. \\"The Way of the Cross\\". Stations Portuguese Church, Kolkata A set of the traditional 14 scenes in Limoges enamel The Resurrection of Jesus at the Saint Mary Rawaseneng Prayer Garden, in the Rawaseneng Monastery, Indonesia The early set of seven scenes was usually numbers 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11 and 14 from the list below. The standard set from the 17th to 20th centuries has consisted of 14 pictures or sculptures depicting the following scenes: # Jesus is condemned to death # Jesus takes up his Cross # Jesus falls for the first time # Jesus meets his Mother # Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus carry the Cross # Veronica wipes the face of Jesus # Jesus falls for the second time # Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem # Jesus falls for the third time # Jesus is stripped of his garments (sometimes called the \\"Division of Robes\\") # Jesus is nailed to the Cross # Jesus dies on the Cross # Jesus is taken down from the Cross # Jesus is laid in the tomb Although not traditionally part of the Stations, the Resurrection of Jesus is sometimes included as an unofficial fifteenth station. One very different version, called the Via Lucis (\\"Way of Light\\"), comprising the Fourteen \\"Stations of Light\\" or \\"Stations of the Resurrection\\", starts Jesus rising from the dead and ends with Pentecost. =Scriptural form= Out of the fourteen traditional Stations of the Cross, only eight have a clear scriptural foundation. Stations 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9 are not specifically attested to in the gospels (Roman Catholics believe in Holy Tradition and this is the Holy Tradition not written but practiced for centuries and therefore valid) and Station 13 (representing Jesus's body being taken down off the cross and laid in the arms of his mother Mary) seems to embellish the gospels' record, which states that Joseph of Arimathea took Jesus down from the cross and buried him. To provide a version of this devotion more closely aligned with the biblical accounts, Pope John Paul II introduced a new form of devotion, called the Scriptural Way of the Cross, on Good Friday 1991. He celebrated that form many times but not exclusively at the Colosseum in Rome,Joseph M Champlin, The Stations of the Cross With Pope John Paul II Liguori Publications, 1994, Pope John Paul II, Meditation and Prayers for the Stations of the Cross at the Colosseum, Good Friday, 2000 using the following sequence (as published by the United States Catholic Conference of Bishops): # Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane; # Jesus is betrayed by Judas and arrested; # Jesus is condemned by the Sanhedrin; # Jesus is denied by Peter; # Jesus is judged by Pilate; # Jesus is scourged and crowned with thorns; # Jesus takes up his cross; # Jesus is helped by Simon of Cyrene to carry his cross; # Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem; # Jesus is crucified; # Jesus promises his kingdom to the repentant thief; # Jesus entrusts Mary and John to each other; # Jesus dies on the cross; and # Jesus is laid in the tomb. In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI approved this set of stations for meditation and public celebration. Modern usage Station 5: Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus carry the Cross, Good Friday procession 2011 at Ulm, Germany In the Roman Catholic Church, the devotion may be conducted personally by the faithful, making their way from one station to another and saying the prayers, or by having an officiating celebrant move from cross to cross while the faithful make the responses. The stations themselves must consist of, at the very least, fourteen wooden crosses‚Äîpictures alone do not suffice‚Äîand they must be blessed by someone with the authority to erect stations. Pope John Paul II led an annual public prayer of the Stations of the Cross at the Roman Colosseum on Good Friday. Originally, the pope himself carried the cross from station to station, but in his last years when age and infirmity limited his strength, John Paul presided over the celebration from a stage on the Palatine Hill, while others carried the cross. Just days prior to his death in 2005, Pope John Paul II observed the Stations of the Cross from his private chapel. Each year a different person is invited to write the meditation texts for the Stations. Past composers of the Papal Stations include several non-Catholics. The pope himself wrote the texts for the Great Jubilee in 2000 and used the traditional Stations. The celebration of the Stations of the Cross is especially common on the Fridays of Lent, especially Good Friday. Community celebrations are usually accompanied by various songs and prayers. Particularly common as musical accompaniment is the Stabat Mater. At the end of each station the Adoramus Te is sometimes sung. The Alleluia is also sung, except during Lent. Structurally, Mel Gibson's 2004 film, The Passion of the Christ, follows the Stations of the Cross.Review , United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, 2004 The fifteenth and last station, the Resurrection, is not prominently depicted (compared to the other fourteen) but it is implied since the last shot before credit titles is Jesus resurrected and about to leave the tomb. Debates =Place of Christ's resurrection= Some modern liturgists say the traditional Stations of the Cross are incomplete without a final scene depicting the empty tomb and the resurrection of Jesus because Jesus' rising from the dead was an integral part of his salvific work on Earth. Advocates of the traditional form of the Stations ending with the body of Jesus being placed in the tomb say the Stations are intended as a meditation on the atoning death of Jesus, and not as a complete picture of his life, death, and resurrection. Another point of contention, at least between some ranking liturgists and traditionalists, is (the use of) the \\"New Way of the Cross\\" being recited exclusively in the Philippines and by Filipinos abroad. The Stations of the Resurrection (also known by the Latin name of Via Lucis, Way of Light) are used in some churches at Eastertide to meditate on the Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus Christ. Music Franz Liszt wrote a Via Crucis for choir, soloists and piano or organ or harmonium in 1879. In 1931, French organist Marcel Dupr√© improvised and transcribed musical meditations based on fourteen poems by Paul Claudel, one for each station. Peter Maxwell Davies's Vesalii Icones (1969), for male dancer, solo cello and instrumental ensemble, brings together the Stations of the Cross and a series of drawings from the anatomical treatise De humani corporis fabrica (1543) by the Belgian physician Andreas van Wesel (Vesalius). In Davies's sequence, the final \\"station\\" represents the Resurrection, but of Antichrist, the composer's moral point being the need to distinguish what is false from what is real.Composer's note in the published score (Boosey and Hawkes, B & H 20286). David Bowie regarded his 1976 song \\"Station to Station\\" as \\"very much concerned with the stations of the cross\\". Pawe≈Ç ≈Åukaszewski wrote Via Crucis in 2000 and it was premiered by the Wroc≈Çaw Opera on Good Friday March 30, 2018, and transmitted on TVP Kultura. Stefano Vagnini's 2002 modular oratorio, Via Crucis,Falcon Valley Music Ed., Stefano Vagnini, Via Crucis, Rome, 2002. is a composition for organ, computer, choir, string orchestra and brass quartet. As the Stations of the Cross are prayed during the season of Lent in Catholic churches, each station is traditionally followed by a verse of the Stabat Mater, composed in the 13th century by Franciscan Jacopone da Todi. James Matthew Wilson's poetic sequence, The Stations of the Cross, is written in the same meter as da Todi's poem. Literature Dimitris Lyacos' third part of the Poena Damni trilogy, The First Death, is divided in fourteen sections in order to emphasise the \\"Via Dolorosa\\" of its marooned protagonist during his ascent on the mount of the island which constitutes the setting of the work.

It stretches along the foot of the left bank of the Longyear Valley and on the shore of , the short estuary leading into on the west coast of , the island's broadest inlet. Since 2002 Longyearbyen Community Council has had many of the same responsibilities as a Norwegian municipality, including utilities, education, cultural facilities, fire brigade, roads and ports. The town is the seat of the Governor of Svalbard. It is the world's northernmost settlement of any kind with more than 1,000 permanent residents. Since 2015 Arild Olsen has served as Mayor. Known as Longyear City until 1926, the town was established by and named after American John Munro Longyear, whose Arctic Coal Company started coal-mining there in 1906. took over the mining operations in 1916, and still conducts mining. The German ' almost completely destroyed the town on 8 September 1943, but rebuilding took place after the Second World War. Historically, Longyearbyen was a company town, but most mining operations moved to during the 1990s, and production ceased in 2017 due to immense financial losses suffered by SNSK since 2014 due to market conditions. Meanwhile, the town has seen a large increase in tourism and research. This includes the arrival of institutions such as the University Centre in Svalbard, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault and Svalbard Satellite Station. Svalbard Airport and Svalbard Church serve the community. History Longyear City in 1908 Summer 1925 at Longyearbyen. In 1896, Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab started tours to Hotellneset. To accommodate tourists, they built a prefabricated hotel, but it was not profitable and was closed after the 1897 season. However, two families overwintered in 1898‚Äì99Holm (1999): 55 and Norway Post operated a post office at Hotellneset from 1897 to 1899.Holm (1999): 104 The first commercially viable coal on Svalbard was harvested by S√∏ren Zakariassen in 1899.Holm (1999): 45 In 1901, Bergen-Spitsbergen Kullgrube-kompani started mining coal in Adventtoppen.Holm (1999): 46 The American industrialist John Munro Longyear visited Spitsbergen as a tourist in 1901, and met with an expedition prospecting for coal. In 1903 he returned to Spitsbergen, where he met Henrik B. N√¶ss in Adventfjorden, who gave him samples and information on coal fields. Along with his associate Frederick Ayer, Longyear bought the Norwegian claims on the west side of Adventfjorden, and expanded the claims significantly the following year. In 1906, the Boston- based Arctic Coal Company, with Ayer and Longyear as the main shareholders, started mining in Mine 1a, after building docks and housing. The company had American administration, but mostly Norwegian labourers, and named the town Longyear City. Coal was transported the from the mine to the port using an aerial tramway built by the former world leading aerial cableway company Adolf Bleichert & Co. of Leipzig, Germany.Holm (1999): 148 In 1913, the company started preliminary work to open Mine 2a.Holm (1999): 47 Mine 2b was mined from 1938 to 1969 and today it is a heritage site. Following financial difficulties during the First World War, the mining operations were bought by Store Norske, which was incorporated in Oslo on 30 November 1916.Holm (1999): 119 That year, SNSK built five new barracks, including one that was made into a hospital.Holm (1999): 83 SNSK introduced its own money with the approval of Norges Bank, consisting entirely of banknotes at par with Norwegian krone.Holm (1999): 116 The American community buried their dead at Hotellneset. In 1918, eleven people were killed by the Spanish flu and a graveyard was established in Longyear City.Holm (1999): 64 Two years later, 26 men were killed in a coal dust explosion in Mine 1. This resulted in the mine being closed and electric operation being taken into use in Mine 2. The same year, the first truck was delivered for use in the mining operations.Holm (1999): 69 The Church of Norway appointed Thorleif √òstenstad as Svalbard's first vicar and teacher in 1920.Holm (1999): 126 A school was established as a cooperation between the church and SNSK and had an inaugural eight pupils.Holm (1999): 114 The first church in Svalbard opened on 28 August 1921, and the church's reading room was from then on used as a school. Longyear City was renamed Longyearbyen in 1926.Holm (1999): 85 The Norwegian Telecommunications Administration established a coast radio station, Svalbard Radio, at Finneset in 1911, which was moved to Longyearbyen in 1930.Holm (1999): 149 The town's tourist industry started in 1935, when SS Lyngen started calling regularly during the summer season.Holm (1999): 153 In 1937, SNSK established Sverdrupbyen to house workers for Mine 1b, and operation of the mine started in 1939.Holm (1999): 143 In 1938, Longyearbyen's first road was completed, between the town centre and Sverdrupbyen.Holm (1999): 166 Operations at Mine 2b, a different entrance to Mine 2a, started in 1939. The old power station, one of a handful of buildings that survived the Second World War, and the cable centre Svalbard remained unaffected by the German occupation of Norway in 1940. However, from 1941 the archipelago became of strategic importance in the supply chain between the Allied powers, as well as a source of badly needed coal. The Norwegian government-in-exile rejected a Soviet‚ÄìBritish occupation;Arlov (1994): 74 instead the British Army started Operation Gauntlet to evacuate Spitsbergen. On 29 August 1941, the entire population of Ny-√Ölesund was evacuated to Longyearbyen, and on 3 September 765 people were evacuated from Longyearbyen to Scotland. Later the last 150 men were also evacuated.Holm (1999): 73 With Longyearbyen depopulated, a small German garrison and air strip were established in Adventdalen, mostly to provide meteorological data. After the British Operation Fritham regained control of Barentsburg, the German forces left Longyearbyen without combat.Arlov (1994): 75 In September 1943, the Kriegsmarine dispatched two battleships, Tirpitz and Scharnhorst, and nine destroyers to bombard Longyearbyen, Barentsburg and Grumant. Only four buildings in Longyearbyen survived: the hospital, the power station, an office building and a residential building, in addition to Sverdrupbyen. Longyearbyen remained unsettled until the end of the war, with the first ship from the mainland leaving on 27 June 1945.Holm (1999): 74 =Post-Second World War= Plans were laid during the war to ensure a quick reconstruction and restarting of mining. By 1948, coal production had reached the pre-war level of per year.Arlov (1994): 79 Nybyen was established in 1946 and consisted of five barracks, each housing 72 people.Holm (1999): 94 The first issue of Svalbardposten was published in November 1948. Until then, various wall newspapers had been published irregularly.Holm (1999): 133 In 1949, Longyearbyen received a telephone connection with the mainland via a radio connection between Svalbard Radio and Harstad. In 1949, a farm was built in Longyearbyen to hold cattle for milk, pigs and hens.Holm (1999): 37 A local radio station started broadcasting in 1950.Holm (1999): 150 The burial ground remained in use until 1950, with 44 people buried.Holm (1999): 65 However, it was discovered that the bodies were failing to decompose because of the permafrost, and that they could be preserving various microorganisms. Bodies have since been sent to the mainland for burial. The community centre Huset opened in 1951.Holm (1999): 57 Mining in Mine 1b was terminated in 1958, but operation in Mine 5 started the following year. Preliminary work on Mine 4 started in 1954, and from 1960 it was used as a reserve mine.Holm (1999): 48 The Norwegian Air Force started serving Longyearbyen with postal flights in the 1950s. In 1959, a man fell seriously ill, so a landing strip was prepared in Adventdalen. From the same year, Braathens SAFE started serving the tundra airport with irregular winter flights.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1996: 154‚Äì158 In 1957, a principal was hired at the primary school and a new church was opened on 24 August 1958. From 1961, the primary school was supplemented by a private middle school. A branch of Troms√∏ Sparebank opened in 1959.Holm (1999): 16 In the 1960s, the town's farm was closed and replaced by industrial liquefaction of powdered milk.Holm (1999): 86 The first serial-produced snowmobile was taken into use in 1961. By 1969, there were 140 registered snowmobiles and only 33 registered cars. From 1962 to 1984, a recreational centre was run at Sverdrupbyen. Ordinary operation in Mine 4 started in 1966 but was terminated by 1970, two years after Mine 2b closed. Operations in Mine 6 commenced in 1969. Television broadcasting equipment was installed in 1969, with the schedule of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation being aired with a two-week delay. In 1971, a new school building, with a combined primary and lower secondary school, was opened, along with a new gymnasium and a swimming pool. The Svalbard Council was established on 1 November 1971. It consisted of 17 non-partisan members who were elected or appointed in three different groups: SNSK employees, government employees and others, although the ratio changed several times.Holm (1999): 134 Operations of Mine 3 started in March 1971 and operations in Mine 7 commenced the following year. In 1973, the Ministry of Trade and Industry bought a third of SNSK. It continued buying additional shares until it reached a 99.94 percent ownership in 1976. The airport was opened in 1975 and initially provided four weekly services to mainland Norway and semi-weekly services to Russia.Holm (1999): 129 In 1978, the community received satellite communications with the mainland. The same year, an upper secondary program was introduced at the public school. From 1984, television programmes were broadcast live via satellite. University Centre in Svalbard Store Norske underwent a gradual change during the 1980s. Since 1980, Spitsbergen money has been taken out of circulation and replaced with ordinary Norwegian currency. Mine 6 closed the following year. From 1982, SNSK permitted private individuals to own and operate cars. By 1990, there were 353 registered cars and 883 snowscooters.Holm (1999): 70 On 1 July 1983, SNSK moved its head office from Bergen to Longyearbyen. Svalbard Samfunnsdrift (SSD), a limited company that was responsible for public infrastructure and services, was established by SNSK on 1 January 1989. Responsibilities included healthcare, the fire brigade, the kindergarten, roads, rubbish disposal, power production, the water and sewer system, the cinema, cultural activities and the library. Ownership was taken over by the Ministry of Trade and Industry on 1 January 1993. During the 1990s, the authorities started a process to \\"normalise\\" Longyearbyen by abolishing the company town scheme and introducing a full range of services, a varied economy and local democracy.Arlov (1994): 86 Commercial enterprises included a shopping mall replacing SNSK's provision store in 1992.Holm (1999): 125 Similarly, Esso opened a commercial fuel station in 1994. The Svalbard Council changed its regulations from 1993 and allowed parties to run for election.Holm (1999): 136 In a step to increase tourism, Svalbard Polar Hotel opened in 1995,Holm (1999): 132 and a year later mining of Mine 3 terminated. Longyearbyen Community Council was established in 2002, replacing the Svalbard Council and assimilating SSD, and took on many of the responsibilities and the structure of a municipality. This period also saw the rise of a number of scientific establishments. The Agricultural University of Norway had established a primitive seed bank in 1984.Holm (1999): 44 The University Centre in Svalbard opened on 6 September 1993 and had 30 students in its inaugural semester.Holm (1999): 164 Telenor Mobil established GSM coverage in 1995,Holm (1999): 151 and in 2004 the Svalbard Undersea Cable System opened, providing fiber optic cable connection to the mainland. The European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association (EISCAT) opened a radar in 1996,Holm (1999): 36 followed by Svalbard Satellite Station in 1999Holm (1999): 141 and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in 2008. Geography View of the central parts of Longyearbyen from Plat√•berget. The body of water is Adventfjorden while the valley up to the right is Adventdalen. Longyearbyen seen from the top of the hill Longyearbyen is located in the lower portion of the Longyear Valley, along the Longyear River. The lower parts of the town lie along the southwestern shore of the bay of Adventfjorden, a branch of Isfjorden. Longyearbyen is on the Nordenski√∂ld Land peninsula of Spitsbergen, the largest island of the Svalbard archipelago. Across the bay lie the ghost towns of Advent City and Hiorthhamn. It is the world's northernmost town, with all settlements further north being research or meteorological outposts. The northernmost settlement in the world is Alert, Canada, located in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut.https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart- news/worlds-most-northerly-permanent-settlement-set-record-high- temperature-180972702/ Longyearbyen is divided into several neighbourhoods. On the west side of the river, along the bay, lies the port and affiliated utility and industrial services. The western part of this area is called Bykaia and the eastern part Sj√∏omr√•det. Above lies Skj√¶ringa, the site of the Governor's offices. Slightly up the valley on the west side lies Gamle Longyearbyen (\\"Old Longyearbyen\\") and the church. Even further up lies the graveyard, then Huset and the cinema, and finally Sverdrupbyen. Most of the residential, commercial and cultural institutions are located on the east side of the river. Along the bay the area is called Sj√∏skrenten. Further up lies the university centre and Gruvedalen, the largest residential area. Southwards from there is the main shopping area as well as the town hall. To the east is the residential area Lia and further up Haugen, which is also the location of the school. Furthest up in the valley is Mine 2b and Nybyen, which is mostly used as student housing. Westwards out of town towards Hotellneset is the airport and Mine 3. The remaining mines are located in Adventdalen, to the east of town. = Climate = Svalbard's climate is a combination of an Arctic climate (K√∂ppen: ET) tempered by the North Atlantic Current. Nordenski√∂ld Land is the warmest and wettest part of the archipelago, caused by the convergence of mild and humid air from the south and cold air from the north. Average summer highs are typically while average winter highs are . Longyearbyen experiences midnight sun from between 18 April and 23 August (127 days), polar night from 27 October to 15 February (111 days) and civil polar night from 13 November to 29 January. However, due to shading from mountains, the sun is not visible in Longyearbyen until around 8 March. Snow typically covers the town from November to March. The warmest temperature ever recorded in Longyearbyen was in July 2020 and the coldest was in March 1986. Svalbard and Longyearbyen are among the places in the world that have warmed fastest in the latest decades. The average temperatures in the table below are based on 1961‚Äì90. In the more recent period 1981‚Äì2010, winter has warmed and summer compared to 1961‚Äì90.http://www.hindawi.com/journals/amete/2011/893790/ ‚Äì recent warming on Svalbard With the sea surface temperatures warming, ice formation takes longer in the surrounding waters and thus especially early winter under the polar night warms the fastest due to the shorter ice season. Although Alert, Canada probably has a lower UV index, Longyearbyen has the lowest known ultraviolet rate for an inhabited place on Earth, ranging from 2 in summer to 0 in mid- year, averaging 1 over 12 months. Demographics Tourists visit the main street, with a shopping mall closest and the town hall further down , Longyearbyen had a population of 2,368 people. The largest regional group of Norwegians are from Northern Norway, particularly Nordland and Troms, who make up more than 40 percent of the population. Roughly 300 people (16 percent) are non-Norwegian citizens, with the largest nationalities being from Thailand, Sweden, Russia and Ukraine. Because of the dominance of the mining industry, the gender distribution is skewed with 60 percent of adults being males. Longyearbyen has an over-average share of its population between 25 and 44 years old, but nearly no residents over 66. The number of children in relation to the population is at the national average, but Longyearbyen has significantly fewer teenagers than the national average. As of 2014 Thai people, numbering 120, were the second largest group of residents after Norwegians; there were 60 in 2006. Thais first came to Svalbard when men brought their wives from Thailand during the 1970s. An RT (Russia Today) article stated that a Thai √©migr√© named Sompong Haug, who married a man and arrived in Svalbard in the 1980s, was \\"the founder of the Thai community\\" in Longyearbyen and \\"the unofficial president of the burgeoning Thai community.\\" In 2006, most of the Thai residents worked as cleaners, and as of 2011 most stay for terms of two to three years to save funds. In 2007, 10 students at the Longyearbyen School were Thai. The Thai community is active in numerous cultural events annually and motivated the establishment of a Thai supermarket. Longyearbyen experiences a very high turnover; in 2008, 427 people (23 percent) moved away from the town. The average person lived in Longyearbyen for 6.3 years, although it is 6.6 years for Norwegians and 4.3 years for foreigners. In 2009, about a quarter of the population had lived in the town since before 2000, and can thus be regarded as its permanent population. The longest-residing people tend to work in the mining industry, followed by local government employees. The shortest tenures are held by students and employees in higher education, tourism and the state. Seventy percent of households consist of a single person, compared to forty-one percent on the mainland, giving an average 1.6 people per household. The difference is largely caused by persons working on Svalbard while their family remains on the mainland. Longyearbyen's population is more highly educated than the national average: 54 percent compared to 43 percent have upper secondary education and 30 percent compared to 26 percent have tertiary education. Among women, 40 percent have higher education. Politics and government Longyearbyen seen from the bay Longyearbyen Community Council has many of the same responsibilities as a municipality. It is organised with a 15-member council that since 2015 has been led by Mayor Arild Olsen of the Labour Party. The council's main responsibilities are infrastructure and utilities, including power, land-use and community planning, education from kindergarten to upper secondary level and child welfare. It operates three kindergartens in addition to the 13-grade Longyearbyen School. No care or nursing services and welfare payments are available. Norwegian residents retain pension and medical rights through their mainland municipalities. The University Hospital of North Norway operates a clinic, Longyearbyen Hospital. Other public offices with a presence on Longyearbyen are the Norwegian Directorate of Mining, the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Tax Administration and the Church of Norway. Longyearbyen is subordinate to Nord- Troms District Court and H√•logaland Court of Appeal, both located in Troms√∏. The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 established full Norwegian sovereignty over the archipelago. The treaty came into effect in 1925, following the Svalbard Act that established the institution of the Governor of Svalbard. The governor holds responsibility as both county governor and chief of police, as well as holding other authority granted from the executive branch. Duties include environmental policy, family law, law enforcement, search and rescue, tourism management, information services, contact with foreign settlements and judge in some areas of maritime inquiries and judicial examinations‚Äîalbeit never in the same cases as acting as police. Kjerstin Askholt has been governor since 2015; she is assisted by a staff of 26 professionals. The institution is subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and the Police, but reports to other ministries in matters within their portfolio. Upper part of the Longyear Valley, with the buildings of Sverdrupbyen to the left, Huset to the right and an aerial tramway in the background Because of the special treaty status of Svalbard, Longyearbyen is subject to Norwegian legislation, but citizens of any signatory country may conduct commercial activities and live in town. However, people without a source of income can be rejected by the governor. The treaty limits Norway's right to collect taxes to that of financing services on Svalbard. Therefore, Longyearbyen has a lower income tax than mainland Norway, and there is no value added tax. The treaty has resulted in Longyearbyen being a demilitarized zone and it is not part of the European Economic Area nor of the Schengen Area like the rest of Norway. = Unique laws = Because of the town's remoteness, there are laws that are found in few, if any, other places in the world. Notable examples of such laws include a ban on cats, a restriction on how much alcohol an individual can purchase on a monthly basis, and a requirement that any individuals venturing outside carry a rifle for protection against polar bears. A popular claim made about the town is that it is illegal to die there but the wording in such a claim is misleading. While it is not actually illegal to die in Longyearbyen, there are no options for burial of bodies there (ashes can be buried with permission from the government) and residents considered terminally ill are typically required to move away. The decision to disallow burials came in 1950, when it was discovered that the bodies of residents who had died as a result of the 1918 flu pandemic had not begun to decompose. Today, scientists fear that the corpses, having been preserved by the permafrost in which they were buried, may still contain live strains of that same virus that killed 5% of the world's population in the 20th century.https://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/themes/adventure/103873808/svalbard- norway-the-island-where-no-one-is-allowed-to-die-or-give-birth Culture The community council runs a number of cultural activities, such as a cinema, a youth club, a library and a gallery. The town's sports club is Svalbard Turn.Holm (1999): 139 Svalbardhallen is an indoor sport centre that includes a multi-sport hall large enough for handball or three badminton courts, a shooting range, a climbing wall and a swimming pool. Svalbard Church of the Church of Norway has the entire archipelago as its parish. The congregational hall is while the sitting room is . The church is built in half-timber. Svalbardposten is a weekly newspaper published on Friday. Printing takes place in Troms√∏ and the majority of subscribers live on the mainland. Icepeople, an alternative newspaper in English, is also published weekly. There are two museums in town, Svalbard Museum and the Spitsbergen Airship Museum. Solfestuka (\\"Sun Festival Week\\") takes place each year during the week surrounding March 8, the date sunlight is first visible in most of the town after the polar night that began the previous October (the first official sunrise is usually Feb. 16, but most of the town is still in shadow due to the surrounding mountains). Dark Season Blues has been held annually in October since 2003. Polarjazz has been held in late January/early February since 1998. Twenty residents of the town are members of the Liverbirds Svalbard and regularly meet in the Svalbar on match days during the winter months. Arctic Film Festival is a film festival which held annually in the city's screening venue, Kulturhuset. Longyearbyen is served by Arctic Outpost AM radio 1270. Link to radio AM1270 livestream and map of town. Economy Old coal filling station. Drawing by Max Presnyakov, 2014. The only mining still taking place in Longyearbyen is at Mine 7, located up Adventdalen. It produces of coal annually, of which is used to fuel Longyear Power Station, Norway's only coal- fueled power station. Most of Store Norske's production is done at Sveagruva, located on Van Mijenfjorden, south of Longyearbyen. No roads connect the communities; instead, workers live in dormitories in Svea. Seventy percent commute home to the mainland while thirty percent commute to Longyearbyen. Mining has not been profitable and Store Norske relies on state subsidies to retain production. The University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) has 350 students and a permanent faculty of 40 professors and assistants and 120 guest lecturers. UNIS does not offer degrees, but instead offers semester courses in biology, physics and geology. Student housing is located at Nybyen. The college is part of the Svalbard Science Centre, which also features the Norwegian Polar Institute, EISCAT and Svalbard Science Forum. In 2006, about 9,000 research days were spent in Longyearbyen, most of which were by Norwegians. This made Longyearbyen the second-largest research outpost on Svalbard, marginally below Ny-√Ölesund. In contrast, Longyearbyen has almost only Norwegian research, while Ny-√Ölesund is roughly evenly split between Norwegian and foreign. The EISCAT radar Svalbard Satellite Station was built because of Longyearbyen's excellent location to download data from satellites in polar orbit. Located at Plat√•berget above Hotellneset, it was built as a cooperation between NASA and the Norwegian Space Centre, but has since 2001 been operated by Kongsberg Satellite Services. EISCAT operates an incoherent scatter radar to study the northern lights. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, administered by the Global Crop Diversity Trust, is a secure underground facility capable of storing millions of crop seeds. The facility has been designed to protect against natural and human disasters, including global warming, floods and fires and nuclear holocaust. The site was chosen for a number of factors including its remoteness, sound geology and the ambient temperature of the permafrost. Longyearbyen is the centre of tourism on the archipelago, although most tourism is generated based on natural experiences rather than visiting the town itself. However, Longyearbyen does provide supplies, accommodation and several museums. In 2008, Longyearbyen experienced 89,000 guest-nights, up from 30,000 in 1995. The average guest stayed 2.2 nights and 60 percent of the capacity was used by tourists. About 40,000 tourists flew into Longyearbyen. Two-thirds of the tourists come from Norway. In 2007, the tourism industry had a revenue of NOK 291 million and produced 200 man-years.  Education  Longyearbyen School Until 1987, a series of aerial tramways were used to haul coal from the mines to the port University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) Longyearbyen School serves ages 6‚Äì18. It is the primary and secondary school in the northernmost location on Earth. Once pupils reach ages 16 or 17 many families move to mainland Norway. There is a non-degree offering tertiary educational institution in Longyearbyen, University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS), the tertiary school in the northernmost location on Earth, co-located with the Norwegian Polar Institute, Svalbard Museum and Svalbard Science Forum. Transport Longyearbyen has a road network stretching , but the network does not extend to any other communities.Umbriet (1997): 63‚Äì67 In 2008 there were 1,481 registered road vehicles and 49 percent of all households had a car. Cars are registered with ZN on the registration plates. There is a single dealer which sells Toyotas, Svalbard Auto, which is also one of two businesses providing repair service. Snowmobiles are a popular mode of transport and there are more snowmobiles than residents. In 2008 there were registered 2,672 snowmobiles and 69 percent of households owned at least one. Off-road motorised transport is prohibited on bare ground, but snowmobiles are used extensively during winter‚Äîboth for commercial and recreational activities. Transport from Longyearbyen to Barentsburg () and Pyramiden () is possible by snowmobile by winter, or by ship all year round. Svalbard Airport, Longyear is located at Hotellneset, northwest of town. It has a long runway and is the only airport that is permitted to serve aircraft from off the archipelago.

He was the Stasi's number two for 34 years, which spanned most of the Cold War. He is often regarded as one of the most well known spymasters during the Cold War. In the West he was known as \\"the man without a face\\" due to his elusiveness. Life and career =Early life and education= Wolf was born 19 January 1923, in Hechingen, Province of Hohenzollern (now Baden- W√ºrttemberg), to a Jewish father and a non-Jewish mother. His father was the writer and physician Friedrich Wolf (1888‚Äì1953) and his mother was the teacher Else Wolf ( Dreibholz; 1898‚Äì1973). He had one brother, the film director Konrad Wolf (1925‚Äì1982). His father was a member of the Communist Party of Germany, and after the anti-socialist and anti-Semitic Nazi Party gained power in 1933, Wolf emigrated to Moscow with his father, via Switzerland and France, because of their communist convictions and because Wolf's father was Jewish. During his exile, Wolf first attended the German Karl Liebknecht School and later a Russian school. In 1936, at the age of 13, he obtained Soviet identity documents. =Career= After finishing school, Wolf entered the Moscow Institute of Airplane Engineering (Moscow Aviation Institute) in 1940, which was evacuated to Alma Ata after Nazi Germany's attack on the Soviet Union. There he was told to join the Comintern, where he among others was prepared for undercover work behind enemy lines. He also worked as a newsreader for German People's Radio after the dissolution of the Comintern, from 1943 until 1945. After the war he was sent to Berlin with the Ulbricht Group, led by Walter Ulbricht, to work as a journalist for a radio station in the Soviet Zone of occupation. He was among those journalists who observed the entire Nuremberg trials against the principal Nazi leaders. Between 1949 and 1951 Wolf worked at the East German embassy in the Soviet Union. That same year he joined the Ministry for State Security (Stasi). In December 1952, at the age of 29, Wolf was among the founding members of the foreign intelligence service within the Ministry for State Security. As intelligence chief, he achieved great success in penetrating the government, political and business circles of West Germany with spies. The most notable individual in this regard was G√ºnter Guillaume, who was secretary to and close friend of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, and whose exposure as an East German agent led to Brandt's resignation in 1974. For most of his career, Wolf was known as \\"the man without a face\\" due to his elusiveness. It was reported that Western agencies did not know what the East German spy chief looked like until 1978, when he was photographed by , Sweden's National Security Service, during a visit to Stockholm, Sweden. An East German defector, Werner Stiller, then identified Wolf to West German counter-intelligence as the man in the picture. It has also been suggested that elements within the CIA had identified him by 1959 from photographs of attendees at the Nuremberg trials. =Retirement= Wolf at the Alexanderplatz demonstration, 4 November 1989 He retired in 1986 with the rank of Generaloberst, being succeeded by Werner Grossmann as head of the East German foreign intelligence service. He continued the work of his late brother Konrad in writing the story of their upbringing in Moscow in the 1930s. The book Troika came out on the same day in East and West Germany. During the Peaceful Revolution, Wolf distanced himself from the hardline position taken by Erich Honecker, favouring reform. He spoke at the November 1989 Alexanderplatz demonstration, where he was booed during his speech. The dissident B√§rbel Bohley would later say: In September 1990, shortly before German reunification, Wolf fled the country, and sought political asylum in Russia and Austria. When denied, he returned to Germany where he was arrested by German police. Wolf claimed to have refused an offer of a large amount of money, a new identity with plastic surgery to change his features, and a home in California from the Central Intelligence Agency to defect to the United States. In 1993, he was convicted of treason by the D√ºsseldorf and sentenced to six years' imprisonment. This was later quashed by the German supreme court, because West Germany was a separate country at the time. In 1997, he was convicted of unlawful detention, coercion, and bodily harm, and was given a suspended sentence of two years' imprisonment. He was additionally sentenced to three days' imprisonment for refusing to testify against when the former West German (SPD) politician was accused in 1993 of atomic espionage. Wolf said that Fl√§mig was not the agent that he had mentioned in his memoirs. Markus Wolf died in his sleep at his Berlin home on 9 November 2006. Cultural impact Grave in Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde (Berlin) John le Carr√©'s fictional spymaster Karla, a Russian, who appears in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, The Honourable Schoolboy, and Smiley's People was believed by some readers to be modeled on Wolf. However, the writer has repeatedly denied it, and did so once again when interviewed on the occasion of Wolf's death. Le Carr√© has also stated that it is \\"sheer nonsense\\" to claim that Wolf was the inspiration for the character Fiedler in The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. Although Fiedler is a German Jew who spent World War II in exile and then gained a senior position in East Germany's Intelligence Service, Carr√© said he had no idea who Markus Wolf was at the time of the writing of the book. He added that he considered Wolf to be the moral equivalent of Albert Speer. He maintained that a character's code name Wolf in an early draft of the book was a coincidence and that the name came from the brand of his lawn mower. He renamed the character after being told that there was an actual Wolf in East German intelligence. Conversely, Wolf stated that The Spy Who Came In From the Cold was the only book he read for a period in the early 1960s, and was surprised how accurately it presented the reality within the East German security services. He wondered if le Carr√© had had special information about the situation within the Ministry of State Security. Wolf appears as a character in Frederick Forsyth's novel The Deceiver. In the section entitled \\"Pride and Extreme Prejudice\\", a KGB officer liaises with East German intelligence while tracking down a British agent in East Germany. Forsyth also mentions Wolf in his earlier novel The Fourth Protocol, describing him, and the East German intelligence service as a whole, as masters of the false flag recruitment technique.

Hitchings and Sir James Black for their use of innovative methods of rational drug design for the development of new drugs.Adams, Patrick, Meet the woman who gave the world antiviral drugs, National Geographic, August 31, 2020 This new method focused on understanding the target of the drug rather than simply using trial-and-error. Her work led to the creation of the AIDS drug AZT. Her well known works also include the development of the first immunosuppressive drug, azathioprine, used to fight rejection in organ transplants, and the first successful antiviral drug, acyclovir (ACV), used in the treatment of herpes infection. Early life and education Elion was born in New York City on January 23, 1918, to parents Robert Elion, a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant and a dentist, and Bertha Cohen, a Polish immigrant. Her family lost their wealth after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Elion was an excellent student who graduated from Walton High School at the age of 15. When she was 15, her grandfather died of stomach cancer, and being with him during his last moments inspired the multi talented Gertrude to pursue a career in science and medicine in college.Bertha and Gertrude Elion  Jewish Women's Archive. Jwa.org. Retrieved on May 12, 2014. She was Phi Beta Kappa at Hunter College, which she was able to attend for free due to her grades, graduating summa cum laude in 1937 with a degree in chemistry. Unable to find a paying research job after graduating because she was female, Gertrude worked as a secretary and high school teacher before working in an unpaid position at a chemistry lab. Eventually, she saved up enough money to attend New York University and she earned her M.Sc. in 1941, while working as a high school teacher during the day. In an interview after receiving her Nobel Prize, she stated that she believed the sole reason she was able to further her education as a young female was because she was able to attend Hunter College for free. Her fifteen financial aid applications for graduate school were turned down due to gender bias, so she enrolled in a secretarial school, where she attended only six weeks before she found a job. Unable to obtain a graduate research position, she worked as a food quality supervisor at A&P; supermarkets and for a food lab in New York, testing the acidity of pickles and the color of egg yolk going into mayonnaise. She moved to a position at Johnson & Johnson that she hoped would be more promising, but ultimately involved testing the strength of sutures. In 1944, she left to work as an assistant to George H. Hitchings at the Burroughs-Wellcome pharmaceutical company (now GlaxoSmithKline) in Tuckahoe, New York.Gertrude B. Elion, Biography of Gertrude B. Elion, Jewish Women Encyclopedia Hitchings was using a new way of developing drugs, by intentionally imitating natural compounds instead of through trial and error. Specifically, he was interested in synthesizing antagonists to nucleic acid derivatives, with the goal that these antagonists would integrate into biological pathways. He believed that if he could trick cancer cells into accepting artificial compounds for their growth, they could be destroyed without also destroying normal cells.Gertrude synthesized anti-metabolites of purines, and in 1950, she developed the anti- cancer drugs tioguanine and mercaptopurine. She pursued graduate studies at night school at New York University Tandon School of Engineering (then Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute), but after several years of long-range commuting, she was informed that she would no longer be able to continue her doctorate on a part-time basis, but would need to give up her job and go to school full-time. Elion made a critical decision in her life, and stayed with her job and give up the pursuit of her doctorate. She never obtained a formal Ph.D., but was later awarded an honorary Ph.D. from New York University Tandon School of Engineering (then Polytechnic University of New York) in 1989 and an honorary S.D. degree from Harvard University in 1998.  Personal life  Soon after graduating from Hunter College, Elion met Leonard Canter, an outstanding statistics student at City College of New York (CCNY). They planned to marry, but Leonard became ill. On June 25, 1941, he died from bacterial endocarditis, an infection of his heart valves. In her Nobel interview, she stated that this furthered her drive to become a research scientist and pharmacologist. Elion never married or had children. However, her brother, whom she was close with, married and had two sons and a daughter that she took pride in being able to watch grow. She listed her hobbies as photography, travel, opera and ballet, and listening to music. After Burroughs Wellcome moved to Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, Elion moved to nearby Chapel Hill. She retired in 1983 from Burroughs Wellcome to spend more time traveling and attending the opera. She continued to make important scientific contributions after her retirement. One of her passions during this time was encouraging other women to pursue a career in science. Gertrude Elion died in North Carolina in 1999, aged 81.  Career and research  While Elion had many jobs to support herself and put herself through school, Elion had also worked for the National Cancer Institute, American Association for Cancer Research, and World Health Organization, among other organizations. From 1967 to 1983, she was the Head of the Department of Experimental Therapy for Burroughs Wellcome. She officially retired from Burroughs and Wellcome in 1983. She was affiliated with Duke University as Adjunct Professor of Pharmacology and of Experimental Medicine from 1971 to 1983 and Research Professor from 1983 to 1999. During her time at Duke, she focused on mentoring medical and graduate students. She published more than 25 papers with the students she mentored at Duke. Even after her retirement from Burroughs Wellcome, Gertrude continued almost full time work at the lab. She played a significant role in the development of AZT, one of the first drugs used to treat HIV and AIDS. She also was crucial in the development of Nelarabine, which she worked on until her death in 1999. Rather than relying on trial-and-error, Elion and Hitchings discovered new drugs using rational drug design, which used the differences in biochemistry and metabolism between normal human cells and pathogens (disease-causing agents such as cancer cells, protozoa, bacteria, and viruses) to design drugs that could kill or inhibit the reproduction of particular pathogens without harming human cells. The drugs they developed are used to treat a variety of maladies, such as leukemia, malaria, lupus, hepatitis, arthritis, gout, organ transplant rejection (azathioprine), as well as herpes (acyclovir, which was the first selective and effective drug of its kind). Most of Elion's early work came from the use and development of purine derivatives. Elion's research contributed to the development of: * Mercaptopurine (Purinethol), the first treatment for leukemia, also used in organ transplantation. * Azathioprine (Imuran), the first immuno-suppressive agent, used for organ transplants. * Allopurinol (Zyloprim), for gout. * Pyrimethamine (Daraprim), for malaria. * Trimethoprim (Proloprim, Monoprim, others), for meningitis, sepsis, and bacterial infections of the urinary and respiratory tracts. * Acyclovir (Zovirax), for viral herpes. * Nelarabine for cancer treatment.

Awards and honors In 1988 Elion received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, together with Hitchings and Sir James Black for discoveries of \\"important new principles of drug treatment\\". Elion was the fifth female Nobel laureate in Medicine and the ninth in science in general, and one of only a handful of laureates without a doctoral degree. She was the only woman honored with a Nobel Prize that year. She was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1990, a member of the Institute of Medicine in 1991 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences also in 1991. Her awards include the Garvan-Olin Medal (1968), the Sloan-Kettering Institute Judd Award (1983), the American Chemical Society Distinguished Chemist Award (1985), the American Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award (1989), the American Association of Cancer Research Cain Award (1985), the American Cancer Society Medal of Honor (1990), the National Medal of Science (1991), and the Lemelson- MIT Lifetime Achievement Award (1997). In 1991 Elion became the first woman to be inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. She was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame also in 1991. In 1992, she was elected to the Engineering and Science Hall of Fame. She was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1995.

Black established a Veterinary Physiology department at the University of Glasgow, where he became interested in the effects of adrenaline on the human heart. He went to work for ICI Pharmaceuticals in 1958 and, while there, developed propranolol, a beta blocker used for the treatment of heart disease. Black was also responsible for the development of cimetidine, an H2 receptor antagonist, a drug used to treat stomach ulcers. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1988 for work leading to the development of propranolol and cimetidine.James Black tells his life story at Web of Stories  Early life and education  Black was born on 14 June 1924 in Uddingston, Lanarkshire, the fourth of five sons of a Baptist family which traced its origins to Balquhidder, Perthshire. His father was a mining engineer. He was brought up in Fife, educated at Beath High School, Cowdenbeath, and, at the age of 15, won a scholarship to the University of St Andrews. His family had been too poor to send him to university and he had been persuaded to sit the St Andrews entrance exam by his maths teacher at Beath. Until 1967, University College, Dundee was the site for all clinical medical activity for the University of St Andrews. He matriculated at University College (which eventually became the University of Dundee) in 1943 and graduated from University of St Andrews School of Medicine with an MB ChB in 1946. During his time at St Andrews, Black lived in St Salvator's Hall. After graduating, he stayed at University College to join the physiology department as an assistant lecturer before taking a lecturer position at King Edward VIII College of Medicine in Singapore that subsequently became part of the University of Malaya. Black had decided against a career as a medical practitioner as he objected to what he considered the insensitive treatment of patients at the time.  Career  Black had large debts upon his graduation from university, so he took a teaching job in Singapore for three years, before moving to London in 1950 and then on to join the University of Glasgow (Veterinary School) where he established the Veterinary Physiology Department and developed an interest in the way adrenaline affects the human heart, particularly in those suffering from angina. Having formulated a theory of an approach by which the effects of adrenaline might be annulled, he joined ICI Pharmaceuticals in 1958, remaining with the company until 1964, during which time he invented propranolol, which later became the world's best-selling drug. During this time Black pioneered a method of research whereby drug molecules were purposefully built instead of being synthesised first and then investigated for their potential medical uses. The discovery of propranolol was hailed as the greatest breakthrough in the treatment of heart disease since the discovery of digitalis. At the same time, Black was developing a similar method of inventing drugs for treatment of stomach ulcers, but ICI did not wish to pursue the idea so Black resigned in 1964 and joined Smith, Kline and French where he worked for nine years until 1973. While there, Black developed his second major drug, cimetidine, which was launched under the brand name Tagamet in 1975 and soon outsold propranolol to become the world's largest-selling prescription drug. Black was appointed professor, and head of department, of pharmacology at University College London in 1973 where he established a new undergraduate course in medicinal chemistry but he became frustrated by the lack of funding for research and accepted the post of director of therapeutic research at the Wellcome Research Laboratories in 1978. However he did not agree with his immediate boss there, Sir John Vane, and resigned in 1984. Black then became Professor of Analytical Pharmacology at the Rayne Institute of King's College London medical school, where he remained until 1992. He established the James Black Foundation in 1988 with funding from Johnson & Johnson and led a team of 25 scientists in drugs research, including work on gastrin inhibitors which can prevent some stomach cancers. Black contributed to basic scientific and clinical knowledge in cardiology, both as a physician and as a basic scientist. His invention of propranolol, the beta adrenergic receptor antagonist that revolutionised the medical management of angina pectoris, is considered to be one of the most important contributions to clinical medicine and pharmacology of the 20th century. Propranolol has been described as the greatest breakthrough in heart disease treatments since the 18th century discovery of digitalis and has benefited millions of people. Black's method of research, his discoveries about adrenergic pharmacology, and his clarification of the mechanisms of cardiac action are all strengths of his work. He was greatly involved in the synthesis of cimetidine, at the time a revolutionary drug for the treatment and prevention of peptic ulcers. Cimetidine was the first of a new class of drugs, the H2-receptor antagonists. = Chancellor of the University of Dundee = In 1980, Black's association with the University of Dundee was renewed when the institution recognised his many achievements by conferring him with the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws. In 1992 he accepted an offer to succeed the 16th Earl of Dalhousie as Chancellor of the University and was installed as Chancellor at the award ceremony held in Dundee Repertory Theatre on 29 April 1992. Appropriately the first degree he conferred was to Professor Robert Campbell Garry, who had been responsible for his original appointment at University College Dundee. Sir James remarked at this ceremony that by returning to Dundee he was \\"in a real sense, coming home\\". As Chancellor, Sir James Black did much to promote the University of Dundee and was a popular figure within the University. He was awarded a second honorary degree, that of Doctor of Science, in 2005. He retired from his post the following year, and his association with the University of Dundee was marked with launching of the ¬£20 million Sir James Black Centre. The centre, intended to promote interdisciplinary research in the life sciences, was opened by Sydney Brenner in 2006. Sir James Black himself visited the centre in October 2006 and was reportedly excited and pleased by what he saw. A portrait of Black in his chancellor's robes, by Helene Train, is held as part of the University's fine art collection.  Honours and awards  Black was made a Knight Bachelor on 10 February 1981 for services to medical research, receiving the honour from the Queen at Buckingham Palace. On 26 May 2000 he was appointed to the Order of Merit, of which there are only 24 members at any one time, by Queen Elizabeth II. Black was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1976 and the same year he was awarded the Lasker award. His certificate of election to the Royal Society reads: > Has made outstanding contributions, based on fundamental considerations of > receptor theory, to the development of new drugs of clinical importance. > Introduced the first effective beta blockers and analysed their > cardiovascular effects. These drugs have opened up new perspectives for the > treatment of angina pectoris, cardiac irregularities and hypertension. More > recently, in a concerted drive carried out with great vision, he has > developed a new type of histamine antagonist capable of inhibiting gastric > acid secretion induced by histamine or pentagastrin. Apart from its > practical implications this work has considerable fundamental importance > since it provided evidence for the existence of a new type of histamine > receptor. This work has also provided experimental support for the > hypothesis that endogenous histamine may be involved in the secretion of > acid in the stomach. In 1979, he was awarded the Artois-Baillet Latour Health Prize. Black was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh in 1980. In 1982 Black was awarded the Wolf Prize in Medicine, and the year after the Scheele Award. He was awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine along with Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings for their work on drug development. In 1994 he received the Ellison-Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine and in 2004 the Royal Medal from the Royal Society. In 2008, he was Awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Medical Futures Innovation Awards, accompanied by his wife Professor Rona Mackie Black, in front of a distinguished audience of one thousand guests. In the town of Lochgelly, Fife, there is a street called Sir James Black Gait. On 23 November 2018, the University of Glasgow renamed the West Medical Building in honour of Black. Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Glasgow, said: ‚ÄúSir James was undoubtedly one of the greatest scientists of the modern age. Through his commitment, intellect and insight he achieved a global impact and his discoveries continue to improve the lives of many.‚Äù The unveiling of a plaque was attended by Sir James Black‚Äôs wife, Professor Rona Mackie Black, Emeritus Professor and Senior Research Fellow in Public Health within the University's Institute of Health and Wellbeing. James Black Place at Ninewells Hospital is named in his honour. Personal life Black met Hilary Joan Vaughan (1924‚Äì1986) at a ball at university in 1944 and the couple married in 1946 upon his graduation. He described her as the \\"mainspring\\" of his life until she died aged 61 in Surrey. The couple had a daughter, Stephanie, born in 1951. Black remarried in 1994, to Professor Rona MacKie. Black was a very private man who was averse to publicity and was horrified to discover he had won the Nobel Prize. Black died, aged 85, on the morning of 22 March 2010 after a long illness. His death was announced by the University of Dundee, where Black served as Chancellor from 1992 to 2006. His funeral was held on 29 March at St. Columba's Church, London. He is buried at the Ardclach cemetery, a parish established in 1655, near Nairn, Scotland. Upon hearing of Black's death, Professor Pete Downes, Principal and Vice- Chancellor of the University of Dundee said Black \\"was a great scientist, but he was also a great man to know\\" while the BBC said he was \\"hailed as one of the great Scottish scientists of the 20th Century\\". He was described by The Daily Telegraph as the man who earned the most for the pharmaceutical industry through his drug development, though he received little personal financial gain from his work. Shortly after his death the Bute Medical School of the University of St Andrews, where Black had studied for his initial degree in medicine, announced that an honorary 'Sir James Black Chair of Medicine' would be created. In September 2010 the first Chair of Medicine at the University was given to Professor Stephen H Gillespie MD, DSc, FRCP (Edin), FRC Path, who left his post as Professor of Medical Microbiology at UCL.

The delivery from the pitcher has very low velocity and usually catches the hitter off-guard. Its invention is attributed to Rip Sewell of the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1940s, although according to historians John Thorn and John Holway, the first pitcher to throw a big blooper pitch was Bill Phillips, who played in the National League on and off from 1890 through 1903. The practice then lay dormant for nearly 40 years until Sewell resurrected it. According to manager Frankie Frisch, the pitch was named by outfielder Maurice Van Robays. When asked what it meant, Van Robays replied, \\"'Eephus ain't nothing, and that's a nothing pitch.\\" Although the origin is not known for certain, \\"eephus\\" may come from the Hebrew word (pronounced ), meaning \\"nothing\\". The eephus pitch is thrown overhand like most pitches, but is characterized by an unusual, high arcing trajectory. The corresponding slow velocity bears more resemblance to a slow-pitch softball delivery than to a traditional baseball pitch. It is considered a trick pitch because, in comparison to normal baseball pitches, which run from , an Eephus pitch appears to move in slow motion at or less, sometimes into the low-40s mph ().  Development and use in Major League Baseball  Sewell's earliest recorded use of the pitch came in a game against the Boston Braves at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh on June 1, 1943, although as early as the spring training season of 1942 Sewell may have been experimenting with the pitch. Sewell went on to win 20 games with the pitch in 1943. After appearing in over 300 major-league games, Rip Sewell gave up only one career home run off the Eephus, to Ted Williams in the 1946 All-Star Game. Williams challenged Sewell to throw the Eephus. Sewell obliged, and Williams fouled off the pitch. However, Sewell then announced that he was going to throw the pitch again, and Williams clobbered it for a home run. When describing the mechanics of the pitch and why he was able to succeed where others had failed, Williams remarked \\"A little girl could hit that pitch, but you had to provide all the power yourself.\\" Years later, however, Williams admitted that he had been running towards the pitcher's mound as he hit the ball, and photographs reveal that he was in fact a few feet in front of the batter's box when he made contact. Since under Rule 6.06(a) of the Official Baseball Rules, a batter is out for illegal action when he hits a ball with one or both feet on the ground entirely outside the batter's box, Williams would have been out had it been spotted by the home plate umpire. Bill \\"Spaceman\\" Lee threw an Eephus referred to as the \\"Leephus\\", \\"spaceball\\" or \\"moon ball\\". Pitching for the Boston Red Sox in Game 7 of the 1975 World Series, the Red Sox were up 3‚Äì0 when, on a 1‚Äì0 count, Lee threw an Eephus pitch to Tony P√©rez with a runner on base. The pitch resulted in a towering two-run home run over the Green Monster that Lee often said afterward \\"is still rising\\". The Red Sox would go on to lose the game 4‚Äì3, costing them the chance for their first World Series championship since 1918.

Although Almere Haven does not have its own railway station, it is well-connected to Amsterdam and the rest of Almere by a good bus rapid transit system.https://www.almere.nl/wonen/verkeer-en-vervoer/openbaar-vervoer/ Almere Haven has a small harbour, as well as a marinahttp://www.vvvalmere.nl/detail/wsv-almere- haven/81abc78d-850b-4dd1-b776-7f4b2daf61b7 and is surrounded by large forests of poplars containing buzzards, foxes, small deer, and owls. The closest forests are Beginbos and Waterlandsebos. Almere Haven features a mall that, for the most part, closely resembles the downtown area of a small town. Along the moat called Kerkgracht (inside the mall), it also features canal houses, which resemble old canal houses found in Downtown Amsterdam. This was done to make the first citizens (in 1975) feel at home, as they were people who had previously lived in Amsterdam. The first permanent building inside the mall was the multifunctional building De Roef,http://www.canonvanalmere.nl/de_roef which closed down a long time ago. The building is still actively used; currently it is home to a V√∂gele Mode store. The first permanent school of Almere (Haven) was built in 1978 in the neighborhood De Werven. Its name was De Bijenkorf. As more schools were built in Almere and younger people and families settled in other parts of the city, De Bijenkorf became less important and eventually ended up with just a handful of teachers. Therefore, it was up for closure. However, instead of closing, the building burned down in December 1993 because people threw firecrackers through the mailbox. The police found out who those people were, but they never prosecuted them.http://www.almeredezeweek.nl/nieuws/585422-terugblik-op-toenbasisschool- de-bijenkorf The building was never restored.http://digitaalerfgoed.almere.nl/detail.aspx?id=1491552 No trace of the building remains today because in the early 2000s, houses were built on top of the former school site. The first neighborhood of Almere Haven is De Werven. Among other houses and other things, it features a lot of greenery, a big park called Stadswerfpark, a sports center with an external playground (Playground Stadswerfpark) specifically for sports (like a soccer field and basketball court) and a public pool building. It also features a big supervised playground called De Speelhaven.http://www.deschoor.nl/html/index.php?paginaID=189 Almere Haven features the most idealistic architecture in Almere, when the goal was to build a model city on the newly reclaimed land of Flevoland. The city was planned before increasing population pressure in Almere and rising property prices caused compromises on the original vision. Almost all housing developments are built to provide views of greenery and open spaces, and each group of houses is clustered around a little park (although this concept has changed in newer areas), usually with easy access to the surrounding forests, so most residents of Almere Haven do not have the sense of living in a crowded urban area. The urban area of Almere Haven does not have the inconveniences of busy traffic, car pollution, and road noise because all roads are cul-de-sacs connecting to a well-hidden ring road that provides the only car access in and out of Almere Haven, although there are sometimes traffic jams in rush hours on said ring roads (especially on the ring road Noorderdreef). The bus rapid transit system contains a large loop throughout the borough with a bus stop in almost every neighborhood.

Fritz one of the founding fathers of the 1960s studio glass movement. Studio glass is the modern use of glass as an artistic medium to produce sculptures or three-dimensional artworks. The glass objects created are intended to make a sculptural or decorative statement. Their prices may range from a few hundred to hundreds of thousands of dollars (US). For the largest installations, the prices are in the millions. During the early 20th-century (before the early 1960s), contemporary glass art was generally made by teams of factory workers, taking glass from furnaces containing a thousand or more pounds. This form of glass art, of which Tiffany and Steuben in the U.S., Gall√© in France and Hoya Crystal in Japan, Royal Leerdam Crystal in the Netherlands and Orrefors and Kosta Boda in Sweden are perhaps the best known, grew out of the factory system in which all glass objects were hand or mold blown by teams. Modern glass studios use a great variety of techniques in creating glass artworks, including: * Glassblowing, * Flameworking, * Glass casting, * Coldworking, * Glass fusing, * P√¢te de verre, * Stained glass. History From the 19th century, various types of fancy glass started to become significant branches of the decorative arts. Cameo glass was revived for the first time since the Romans, initially mostly used for pieces in a neo-classical style. The Art Nouveau movement in particular made great use of glass, with Ren√© Lalique, √âmile Gall√©, and Daum of Nancy important names in the first French wave of the movement, producing colored vases and similar pieces, often in cameo glass, and also using lustre techniques. Louis Comfort Tiffany in America specialized in secular stained glass, mostly of plant subjects, both in panels and his famous lamps. From the 20th century, some glass artists began to class themselves as sculptors working in glass and as part of the fine arts. In the early 20th century, most glass production happened in factories. Even individual glassblowers making their own personalized designs would do their work in those large shared buildings. The idea of \\"art glass\\" grew ‚Äì small decorative works in small production runs, often with designs or objects inside. By the 1970s, there were good designs for smaller furnaces, and in the United States this gave rise to the \\"studio glass\\" movement of glassblowers, who worked outside of factories, often in their own buildings or studios. This coincided with a move towards smaller production runs of particular styles. This movement spread to other parts of the world as well.Paperweight with items inside the glass, Corning Museum of Glass =Techniques used in modern studios= Modern glass studios use a great variety of techniques in creating their pieces. The ancient technique of blown glass, where a glassblower works at a furnace full of molten glass using metal rods and hand tools to blow and shape almost any form of glass, is one of the more popular ways to work. Most large hollow pieces are made this way, and it allows the artist to be improvisational as they create their work. A vase being created at the Reijmyre glassworks, Sweden Another type is flame-worked glass, which uses torches and kilns in its production. The artist generally works at a bench using rods and tubes of glass, shaping with hand tools to create their work. Many forms can be achieved this way with little investment into money and space. Though the artist is somewhat limited in the size of the work that can be created, a great level of detail can be achieved with this technique. The paperweights by Paul Stankard are good examples of what can be achieved with flame-working techniques. In the 21st century, flame-worked glass became commonly used as adornments on functional items. The glass conductor's baton, commissioned by Chandler Bridges for Dr. Andre Thomas, is a clear example of flame-working being used to transform a traditional item into an artistic statement. Cast glass can be done at the furnace, at the torch or in a kiln. Generally the artist makes a mold out of refractory, sand, or plaster and silica which can be filled with either clear glass or colored or patterned glass, depending on the techniques and effects desired. Large scale sculpture is usually created this way. Slumped glass and fused glass is similar to cast glass, but it is not done at as high of a temperature. Usually the glass is only heated enough to impress a shape or a texture onto the piece, or to stick several pieces of glass together without a glue. The traditional technique of stained glass is still employed for the creation of studio glass. The artist cuts the glass into shapes and sets the pieces into lead cames which are soldered together. They artist can also use hot techniques in a kiln to create texture, patterns, or change the overall shape of the glass. Etched glass is created by dipping glass that has an acid resistant pattern applied to its surface into an acid solution. Also an artist can engrave it by hand using wheels. Sandblasting can create a similar effect. Cold glass is any glass worked without the use of heat. Glass may be cut, chiseled, sandblasted, and glued or bonded to form art objects ranging from small pieces to monumental sculpture.  The studio glass movement  The international studio glass movement originated in America, spreading to Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia and Asia. The emphasis of this movement was on the artist as the designer and maker of one-of-a-kind objects, in a small studio environment. This movement enabled the sharing of technical knowledge and ideas among artists and designers that, in industry, would not be possible. With the dominance of Modernism in the arts, there was a broadening of artistic media throughout the 20th century. Indeed, glass was part of the curriculum at art schools such as the Bauhaus. Frank Lloyd Wright's produced glass windows considered by some as masterpieces not only of design, but of painterly composition as well. During the 1950s, studio ceramics and other craft media in the U.S. began to gain in popularity and importance, and American artists interested in glass looked for new paths outside industry. Harvey Littleton, often referred to as the \\"Father of the Studio Glass Movement\\", was inspired to develop studio glassblowing in America by the great glass being designed and made in Italy, Sweden and many other places, and by the pioneering work in ceramics of the California potter Peter Voulkos. Harvey Littleton and Dominick Labino held the now-famous glass workshop at the Toledo Museum of Art in 1962. The goal was to melt glass in a small furnace so individual artists could use glass as an art medium in a non- industrial setting. This was the workshop that would stimulate the studio glass movement that spread around the world. Instead of the large, industrial settings of the past, a glass artist could now work with a small glass furnace in an individual setting and produce art from glass. Modern regional glass art =Australia= The early glass movement (studio glass) in Australia was spurred on by a visit to Australia by American artist Bill Boysen, who toured the country in the early seventies with a mobile studio. Boysen traveled to Australia in 1974, where he promoted glass artistry by presenting a \\"revolutionary demonstration of glass blowing\\"\\"Blow-in Bill leaves locals glassy-eyed.\\" Weekly Times (Australia), 31 August 2005: 95. to a gathering of around 250 attendees. Boysen's mobile studio \\"successfully toured eight eastern states‚Äô venues in ‚Äô74, thus greatly enhancing the credibility of hand crafted glass.\\" Boysen's visit is credited with helping \\"inspire a generation of [Australian] artists to work with glass and eventually led to the creation of the national glass art collection\\" in Wagga Wagga, Australia. This important collection includes over 450 works of art and is \\"the most comprehensive public collection of Australian studio glass anywhere.\\" Since that time Australian glass has gained worldwide recognition with Adelaide in South Australia, hosting the International Glass Art Society Conference in 2005 on only its third occasion outside of the U.S. The Ranamok Glass Prize, presented every year from 1994 to 2014, promotes contemporary glass artists living in Australia and New Zealand. =Belgium= Dani√´l Theys en Chris Miseur from the glass factory Theys & Miseur in , Belgium, which represent Belgian artistic glass work concerning the entire world. =China= In China, glass art first appeared in the Western Zhou period (1046‚Äì771 BC) and was called liuli. One of the oldest artifacts of Chinese liuli, a pair of burial ear cups, was retrieved from the archaeological site of Western Han Dynasty Prince Liu Sheng of Zhongshan in Hebei Province. Across thousands of years, the art gradually diminished until it was resurrected by artists Loretta H. Yang and Chang Yi in 1987 through the first contemporary Chinese liuli art studio Liuligongfang. In 1997, Yang and Chang released their technique and procedure to the public with the purpose of creating a diplomatic platform for education and advancement. The Liuligongfang technique has since become a key cornerstone upon which contemporary Chinese liuli is built with Yang and Chang widely recognized as the pioneers and founders of contemporary Chinese liuli. =Italy= Nuptial bowl by Angelo Barovier, Murano Glass Museum Glass blowing began in the Roman Empire, and Italy has refined the techniques of glass blowing ever since. Until the very recent explosion of glass shops in Seattle (US), there were more on the Island of Murano (Italy) than anywhere else in world. The majority of the refined artistic techniques of glassblowing (e.g., incalmo, reticello, zanfirico, latticino) were developed there. Moreover, generations of blowers passed on their techniques to family members. Boys would begin working at the fornace (actually \\"furnace\\"‚Äîcalled \\"the factory\\" in English). =Japan= Japanese glass art has a short history. The first independent glass studios were built by Saburo Funakoshi and Makoto Ito, and Shinzo Kotani in separate places. Yoshihiko Takahashi and Hiroshi Yamano show their works at galleries throughout the world and are arguably Japan's glass artists of note. Yoichi Ohira has worked with great success in Murano with Italian gaffers. The small Pacific island Niijima, administered by Tokyo. has a renowned glass art center, built and run by Osamu and Yumiko Noda, graduates of Illinois State University, where they studied with Joel Philip Myers. Every autumn, the Niijima International Glass Art Festival takes place inviting top international glass artists for demonstrations and seminars. Emerging glass artists, such as Yukako Kojima and Tomoe Shizumu, were featured at the 2007 Glass Art Society exhibition space at the Pittsburgh Glass Center. Kyohei Fujita was another noteworthy Japanese studio glass artist. ;See also *Satsuma Kiriko cut glass =Mexico= Mexico was the first country in Latin America to have a glass factory in the early sixteenth century brought by the Spanish conquerors. Although traditional glass in Mexico has prevailed over modern glass art, since the 1970s there have been a List of glass artists#Mexico that have given a place to that country in international glass art. =The Netherlands= Glass art in the Netherlands is mainly stimulated by the glass designing and glass blowing factory Royal Leerdam Crystal. Such notable designers as H.P. Berlage, Andries Copier and Sybren Valkema, Willem Heesen (Master Glassblower as well) had a major influence on Dutch glass art. Later the studio glass movement, inspired by the American Harvey Littleton and the new Workgroup Glass founded by Sybren Valkema at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam led to a new generation of glass artists. = United Kingdom = Wind Song Glass, Peter Newsome Notable centres of glass production in the UK have been St. Helens in Merseyside (the home of Pilkington Glass and the site on which lead crystal glass was first produced by George Ravenscroft), Stourbridge in the Midlands and Sunderland in the North East. Sunderland is now home to the National Glass Centre which houses a specialist glass art course. St. Helens boasts a similar establishment but without the educational body attached. Perthshire in Scotland was known internationally for its glass paperweights. It has always hosted the best glass artists working on small scales, but closed its factory in Crieff, Scotland in January 2002. Glass artists in the UK have a variety of exhibitions. The Scottish Glass Society hosts a yearly exhibition for members, the Guild of Glass Engravers exhibit every two years and the British Glass Biennale, begun in 2004 is now opening its third show. British Glass Art owes much to the long history of craft. The majority of its glass blowers who operate small studio furnaces produce aesthetically beautiful though primarily functional objects. Technical skill as a blower is given as much importance as the artistic intent. Other notable Glasshouse artists are Steven Newell, Catherine Hough, Annette Meech and of course Simon Moore. There are a growing number of glass studios in the UK. Many specialize in production glassware while others concentrate on one off or limited edition pieces. An Arts Council funded, non-profit making organisation, the Contemporary Glass Society, founded in 1976 as British Artists in Glass, exists to promote and support the work of glass artists in the UK. Other glass organisations in the UK are The Guild of Glass Engravers, the Scottish Glass Society and Cohesion. Cohesion is a different sort of entity to the other organisations in that it was specifically founded to promote and develop glass art as a commercial concern. It organises trade events in and around the UK and at the international level. Originally it focused only on artists based the north east of England but has since expanded its remit to cover the whole of the UK. The Northlands Glass School was established in late 1990s in the far north of Scotland and offers residencies and masterclasses to arts students and established glass artists. In November 2007 the glass sculpture Model for a Hotel was unveiled as an exhibit on the fourth plinth of Trafalgar Square, London. =United States= The United States has had two phases of development in glass. The first, in the early and mid-1900s, started in the cities of Toledo, Ohio, and Corning, New York, where factories such as Fenton and Steuben were making both functional and artistic glass pieces. Toledo‚Äôs rich history in glass goes back to the turn of the century when Libbey Glass, Owens-Illinois and Johns Manville led the world in the manufacturing of glass products. Their reputations earned Toledo the title of the \\"Glass Capital of the World.\\" These industry leaders, along with the Toledo Museum of Art, sponsored the first glass workshop in 1961. This workshop would lead to a new movement in American studio glass. Glass sculpture by Dale Chihuly at a 2005 exhibition in Kew Gardens, London, England. The piece is 13 feet (4 m) high The American Studio Glass Movement The second, and most prominent, phase in American glass began in 1962, when then-ceramics professor Harvey Littleton and chemist Dominick Labino began the contemporary glassblowing movement. The impetus for the movement consisted of their two workshops at the Toledo Museum of Art, during which they began experimenting with melting glass in a small furnace and creating blown glass art. Littleton and Labino were the first to make molten glass feasible for artists in private studios. Harvey Littleton extended his influence through his own important artistic contributions and through his teaching and training, including many of the most important contemporary glass artists, including Marvin Lipofsky, Sam Herman (Britain), Fritz Dreisbach and Dale Chihuly. In 1964, Tom McGlauchlin started one of the first accredited glass programs at the University of Iowa, and Marvin Lipofsky founded the university-level glass program at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1964, Dr. Robert C. Fritz founded a university-level glass program at San Jose State University in San Jose, California. As a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under Harvey Littleton, Bill H. Boysen built the first glass studio at Penland School of Crafts, in Penland, North Carolina, in 1965. After graduating in 1966, he started the graduate glass program at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, Illinois. Dale Chihuly initiated the glass program at the Rhode Island School of Design in 1969. Tom McGlauchlin joined the Toledo Museum of Art as Professor and Director of Glass in conjunction with the University of Toledo's Art program in 1971. American Glass Schools and Studios Glass studio in Brooklyn, New York in 2018 Glass sculpture by David Patchen from a show in San Francisco. The piece is 30\\" x 11\\" x 3\\" and comprises hundreds of murrine (patterned tiles of glass) and zanfirico cane (rods of woven colors). The growth of studio glass led to the formation of glass schools and art studios located across the country. The largest concentrations of glass artists are located in Seattle, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. San Francisco, Los Angeles/Orange County and Corning, New York also have sizable concentrations of artists working in glass. The Pilchuck Glass School near Seattle has become a mecca for glass artists from all over the world. Those who attend Pilchuck, either college students or established artists, have the opportunity to attend master classes and exchange skills and information in an environment dedicated solely to glass based arts. Pittsburgh Glass Center in Pittsburgh has residency programs for artists working in glass, as well as a facility for artists to make use of for their works. Pittsburgh Glass Center offers classes to the public on glassblowing and many other forms of glass art. Philadelphia hosts a small array of glass studios for artists that use glass. Home to the National Liberty Museum (featuring all exhibits by international glass artists), Philadelphia hosts the non-profit P.I.P.E. program, with residencies for artists that use glass as well as metal, electroforming on glass, and bronze casting. The state of Pennsylvania has a long tradition of the production of industrial glass and its influence has quickly been absorbed by artists working in glass. The Studio of The Corning Museum of Glass, established in 1996, is an internationally renowned teaching facility in Corning, NY. Classes and workshops are held for new and experienced glassworkers and artists. The Studio‚Äôs residency program brings artists from around the world to Corning for a month to work in The Studio facilities, where they can explore and develop new glassblowing techniques or expand on their current bodies of work; recipients of the Specialty Glass Residency include Beth Lipman, Mark Peiser, Karen LaMonte, and Anna Mlasowsky. Artists working in The Studio have access to the collections of The Corning Museum of Glass, and benefit from the resources of the Rakow Research Library, whose holdings cover the art and history of glass and glassmaking. Wheaton Arts and Cultural Center, located in the historic glass industry capital of Millville, New Jersey, is a nonprofit art and history education center that is home to the Museum of American Glass, which houses the largest collection of American glass objects in the world. The collection includes historical glass as well as contemporary work from some of the glass world's biggest names. In addition to the museum, WheatonArts operates a world-class glass studio under the creative direction of Hank Murta Adams. The Creative Glass Center of America, which is funded by WheatonArts and crucial to its mission of continuing Millville's legacy in the glass world, hosts a fellowship program exclusively for up-and-coming and mid- career artists working in glass. Well-known alumnae of the CGCA fellowship include Steve Tobin (1983) Kait Rhoads (1997 and 2008), Lino Tagliapietra (1989), Beth Lipman (2001), Gregory Nangle (2006), Deborah Czeresko (2006 and 2010), Angus Powers (2003), and Stephen Paul Day (1992, 1997, 2004, and 2009).

Contestants answered general knowledge questions, earning money which doubled as the questions became more difficult. The final question had a top prize of $64,000, hence the \\"$64,000 Question\\" in the show's title. The $64,000 Challenge (1956‚Äì1958) was its spin-off show, where contestants played against winners of at least $8,000 on The $64,000 Question. Origins The $64,000 Question was largely inspired by the earlier CBS and NBC radio program Take It or Leave It, which ran on CBS radio from 1940‚Äì1947, and then on NBC radio from 1947‚Äì1952. After 1950, the show was renamed The $64 question. The format of the show remained largely the same through its 12 year run; a contestant would be asked a series of progressively more difficult questions which began at $1 and ended at a top prize of $64.  Show creation  The $64,000 Question was created by Louis G. Cowan, formerly known for radio's Quiz Kids and the television series Stop the Music and Down You Go. Cowan drew the inspiration for the name from Take It or Leave It, and its $64 top prize offering. He decided to expand the figure to $64,000 for the new television program. Cowan had difficulty locating sponsorship for The $64,000 Question. Cosmetics giant Helena Rubenstein, which eventually did become a familiar television advertiser, rejected the idea, reportedly because its wealthy founding namesake did not own a television set at the time and had no idea of the medium's advertising potential. The Chrysler Corporation turned down the chance to launch the show because the automaker reportedly feared sponsoring a big-money quiz show would outrage company workers whose wages they were trying not to raise. A vacuum cleaner company also said no to Cowan, reportedly because the concept would be too glamorous for its product. Finally, Cowan convinced Revlon. The key: Revlon founder and chieftain Charles Revson knew top competitor Hazel Bishop had fattened its sales through sponsoring the popular This Is Your Life, and he wanted a piece of that action if he could have it. Revlon first signed a deal to sponsor Cowan's brainchild for 13 weeks with the right to withdraw when they expired. The $64,000 Question premiered June 7, 1955 on CBS-TV, sponsored by cosmetics maker Revlon and originating from the start live from CBS-TV Studio 52 in New York (later the disco-theater Studio 54). The first contestant on the show was Thelma Farrell Bennett, a NYC fashion model from Trenton, New Jersey who failed to make it to the first plateau but won a 1955 Cadillac convertible which she sold a month after taking delivery. To increase the show's drama and suspense, and because radio host Phil Baker had bombed earlier in the decade with his lone television effort Who's Whose, it was decided to use an actor rather than a broadcaster as the host. Television and film actor Hal March, familiar to TV viewers as a supporting regular on The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show and My Friend Irma, found instant fame as the quiz show's host, and Lynn Dollar stood nearby as his assistant. Author and TV panelist Dr. Bergen Evans was the show's expert authority, and actress Wendy Barrie did the \\"Living Lipstick\\" commercials. (Coincidentally, in 1978, Evans and Barrie died within 72 hours of each other.) To capitalize on the initial television success, the show was also simulcast for two months on CBS Radio where it was heard from October 4, 1955 to November 29, 1955. The J. Fred & Leslie W. MacDonald Collection of the Library of Congress contains one kinescoped episode from early 1958 featuring Virgil Earp, elderly nephew of Wyatt Earp, winning $32,000. Gameplay Contestants first chose a subject category (such as \\"Boxing\\", \\"Lincoln\\" or \\"Jazz\\") from the Category Board. Although this board was a large part of the set, it was seen only briefly, evidently to conceal the fact that categories were sometimes hastily added to match a new contestant's subject. The contestant would then be asked questions only in the chosen category, earning money which doubled ($64, $128, $256, $512; then $1,000, $2,000, $4,000, $8,000, $16,000, $32,000, and finally $64,000) as the questions became more difficult. At the $4,000 level, a contestant would return each week for only one question per week. They could quit at any time and retire with their money, but until they won $512, if they got a question wrong, they were eliminated without winning anything. Missing a $1,000, $2,000, or $4,000 question left the contestant with $512. Once the contestant won $4,000, if they missed a question they received a consolation prize of a new Cadillac. Starting with the $8,000 question, they were placed in the Revlon \\"isolation booth\\", where they could hear nothing but the host's words. As long as the contestant kept answering correctly, they could stay on the show until they had won $64,000. The first contestant to win the top prize money, on September 13, 1955, was Richard S. McCutchen, a Marine whose subject was cooking. McCutchen became an instant celebrity, with people stopping him in the street to ask for his autograph. Public reception Almost immediately, The $64,000 Question beat every other program on Tuesday nights in ratings. Broadcast historian Robert Metz, in CBS: Reflections in a Bloodshot Eye, claimed U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower himself did not want to be disturbed while the show was on and that the nation's crime rate, movie theater, and restaurant patronage dropped dramatically when the show aired. It earned the #1 rating spot for the 1955‚Äì56 season, holding the distinction of being the only television show to knock I Love Lucy out of the #1 spot, and finished at #4 in the 1956‚Äì57 season and #20 in 1957‚Äì58. Among its imitators or inspirations were The Big Surprise, Tic-Tac-Dough, and Twenty-One. =The $64,000 Challenge= Not only did Charles Revson not exercise his withdrawal right, but he wanted another way to take advantage of Question's swollen audience. April 8, 1956 saw the debut of The $64,000 Challenge (initially co-sponsored by Revlon and Lorillard Tobacco Company's Kent cigarettes), hosted through August 26 by future children's television star Sonny Fox and then, for the remainder of the show's life, Ralph Story. It pitted contestants against winners of at least $8,000 on The $64,000 Question in a new, continuing game where they could win another $64,000. The contestants took turns answering questions from the same category starting at the $1,000 level. If they each answered a question correctly, they advanced to the $2,000 level. Starting at the $4,000 level, both contestants answered the same question while each standing in their own isolation booth. If, at any given level, a contestant answered correctly with the other contestant missing a question, the winning contestant either kept the money and faced a new player, or continued playing against the same opponent at the next money level. In time, the sister show came to include various celebrities, including bandleader Xavier Cugat and child star Patty Duke, as well as former Question champions. The J. Fred & Leslie W. MacDonald Collection of the Library of Congress contains one kinescoped episode featuring Capt. Richard McCutchen as a contestant, broadcast July 1, 1956. =Everyday celebrities= Question contestants sometimes became celebrities themselves for a short while, including 11-year-old Robert Strom (who won $192,000, worth $ million today) and Teddy Nadler ($252,000 across both shows, worth $ million today), the two biggest winners in the show's history. Other such newly made celebrities included Italian-born Bronx shoemaker Gino Prato, who won $32,000 ($ today) for his encyclopedic knowledge of opera. The longest enduring of these newly made celebrities was psychologist Joyce Brothers. Answering questions about boxing, she became, after McCutchen, the second top winner, and went on to a career providing psychological advice in newspaper columns and TV shows for the next four decades. Another winner, Pennsylvania typist Catherine Kreitzer, read Shakespeare on The Ed Sullivan Show. TV Guide kept a running tally of the money won on the show, which hit $1 million by the end of November 1956 ($ million today). The American Experience (PBS) episode probing the scandal noted: > \\"All the big winners became instant celebrities and household names. For the > first time, America's heroes were intellectuals or experts‚Äìjockey Billy > Pearson on art, Marine Captain McCutchen on cooking‚Äìevery subject from the > Bible to baseball. Not only had the contestants become rich overnight, but > they were also treated to a whirlwind of publicity tours, awards, > endorsements and meetings with dignitaries. Cobbler Gino Prato, whose > category was opera, was brought to Italy for a special performance at la > Scala and honored by an audience with the Pope. After winning $64,000, > spelling whiz Gloria Lockerman, an African American, became a guest speaker > at the 1956 Democratic National Convention... Eleven-year-old stock market > expert Lenny Ross was asked to open up the New York Stock Exchange.\\" =Merchandising and parodies= One category on the Revlon Category Board was \\"Jazz\\", and within months of the premiere Columbia Records issued a 1955 album of various jazz artists under the tie-in title $64,000 Jazz (CL 777, also EP B-777), with the following tracks: \\"The Shrike\\" (Pete Rugolo), \\"Perdido\\" (J.J. Johnson, Kai Winding), \\"Laura\\" (Erroll Garner), \\"Honeysuckle Rose\\" (Benny Goodman), \\"Tawny\\" (Woody Herman), \\"One O'Clock Jump\\" (Harry James), \\"How Hi the Fi\\" (Buck Clayton), \\"I'm Comin', Virginia\\" (Eddie Condon), \\"A Fine Romance\\" (Dave Brubeck, Paul Desmond), \\"I Let A Song Go Out of My Heart\\" (Duke Ellington) and \\"Ain't Misbehavin'\\" (Louis Armstrong). Other musical tie-ins included the 1955 song \\"The $64,000 Question (Do You Love Me)\\", recorded by Bobby Tuggle (Checker 823), Jackie Brooks (Decca 29684) and the Burton Sisters (RCA Victor 47-6265). \\"Love Is the $64,000 Question\\" (1956), which used the show's theme music by Norman F. Leyden with added Fred Ebb lyrics, was recorded by Hal March (Columbia 40684), Karen Chandler (Decca 29881), Jim Lowe (Dot 15456) and Tony Travis (RCA Victor 47-6476). When the show was revived in 1976 as The $128,000 Question, its theme music and cues were performed (albeit with a new disco-style arrangement for the theme) by Charles Randolph Grean, who released a three-and-a-half-minute single, \\"The $128,000 Question\\" (the show's music and cues as an instrumental), with the B-side (\\"Sentimentale\\") on the Ranwood label (45rpm release R-1064). For the show's second season, Grean's music package was re-recorded by Guido Basso. There were numerous parodies of the program, including in the Foghorn Leghorn cartoon \\"Fox Terror\\", Bob and Ray's The 64-Cent Question. The Jack Benny Program featured Hal March as a contestant in an October 20, 1957 spoofThe Jack Benny Program episode guide with Benny asking the questions. As a gag, Benny actually appeared as a contestant on The $64,000 Question on October 8, 1957, but insisted on walking away with $64 after answering the first question. Hal March finally gave him $64 out of his own pocket. At the height of its popularity, The $64,000 Question was referenced in the scripts of other CBS shows, usually but not exclusively through punch lines that included references to \\"the isolation booth\\" or \\"reaching the first plateau.\\" Typical of these was spoken by The Honeymooners' Ed Norton (Art Carney), who identified three times in a man's life when he wants to be alone, with the third being \\"when he's in the isolation booth of The $64,000 Question.\\" At least three other Honeymooners episodes referenced Question: In A Woman's Work Is Never Done Ralph proposes to Alice that he go on the show because he's an expert in the \\"Aggravation\\" category. In Hello, Mom Norton tells Ralph that his mother-in-law's category on the show would be \\"Nasty\\". In The Worry Wart, Ralph advises Alice to become a contestant because she's an expert in the \\"Everything\\" category. Another episode of The Honeymooners, delivered one of the best known Question references ‚Äì a parody of the show itself, in one of the so-called \\"Original 39\\" episodes of the timeless situation comedy. In that episode, blustery bus driver Ralph Kramden becomes a contestant on the fictitious $99,000 Answer. Regarded as one of the Golden Age of Television's best quiz show parodies, the Honeymooners episode depicted Kramden spending a week intensively studying popular songs, only to blow the first question on the subject when he returned to play on the show. The host of the fictitious $99,000 Answer was one Herb Norris, played by former Twenty Questions emcee and future Tic-Tac-Dough host Jay Jackson. The show has been referenced on other game shows. On the U.S. version of Deal or No Deal, an episode aired January 15, 2007, in which the banker's offer was $64,000. Host Howie Mandel said, \\"This is the $64,000 question.\\" In many money trees of most variations of the television series Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, the amount of $64,000 is often included as the prize money awarded for correctly answering the 11th question. Scandal and cancellation In mid-August 1958, while both Question and Challenge had already been announced as part of CBS's fall lineup, the network's quiz show Dotto was cancelled without explanation. A federal investigation was launched by the end of August on the allegation that a Dotto contestant had been given answers in advance. The probe soon included NBC's Twenty-One, and was expected to expand further. In the first week of September, a contestant of Challenge, Rev. Charles Jackson, came forward to say he had been given answers in advance. On September 13, Lorillard Tobacco Company pulled its sponsorship of the show; this made the previous airing on September 7 the last for Challenge. The $64,000 Challenge was replaced on CBS with \\"a special news program\\" on September 14. The $64,000 Question, which had not yet begun airing for the new season, assumed Challenge's Sunday time slot on September 21. After the federal probe of quiz shows surfaced, quiz shows suffered badly in the Fall 1958 Nielsen ratings. In late October, strong rumors had surfaced that Question was slated for movement to a less desirable time slot, or cancellation. Cancellation was made official after Question's November 2 airing. =Scandal= The $64,000 Question was closely monitored by its sponsor's CEO, Revlon's Charles Revson, who often interfered with production of Question, especially attempting to bump contestants he himself disliked, regardless of audience reaction. Revson's brother, Martin, was assigned to oversee Question‚Äìincluding heavy discussions of feedback the show received. The would-be bumpees included Joyce Brothers herself, who managed to outwit the question writers and Revlon long enough to win the maximum prize. According to Question producer Joe Cates, an IBM sorting machine was used to present lower dollar value questions, to give the illusion that the questions were randomly selected ‚Äì in fact, all of the cards were identical. It was revealed during Congressional investigations into the quiz show scandal that Revlon was as determined to keep the show appealing to viewers as the producer of Twenty-One (albeit also under sponsor pressure) had been. Unlike Twenty-One and Dotto, where contestants got the answers in advance, Revlon was reportedly far more subtle, they may have depended less on asking questions on the air that a contestant had already heard in pre-air screenings than on switching the questions kept secure in a bank vault at the last minute, to make sure a contestant the sponsor liked would be suited according to his or her chosen expertise. Nadler's victory would be called into question when he failed a civil service exam in 1960 applying a job for the United States Census Bureau. The most prominent victim may have been the man who initially launched the franchise. Louis Cowan, made CBS Television president as a result of Question's fast success, was forced out of the network as the quiz scandal ramped up, even though it was NBC's quiz shows bearing most of the brunt of the scandal ‚Äì and even though CBS itself, with a little help from sponsor Colgate-Palmolive, had moved fast in cancelling the popular Dotto at almost the moment it was confirmed that that show had been rigged. Cowan had never been suspected of taking part in any attempt to rig either Question or Challenge; later CBS historians suggested his reputation as an administrative bottleneck may have had as much to do with his firing as his tie to the tainted shows. Cowan may have been a textbook sacrificial lamb, in a bid to preempt any further scandal while the network scrambled to recover, and while president Frank Stanton accepted complete responsibility for any wrongdoing committed under his watch. =Aftermath= By the end of 1959, all first generation big-money quizzes were gone, with single-sponsorship television following and a federal law against fixing television game shows (an amendment to the 1960 Communications Act) coming. Over the course of the early 1960s, the networks wound down their five-figure jackpot game shows; Jackpot Bowling (1959‚Äì1961) and Make That Spare (1960‚Äì1964), a period on Beat the Clock (1960) when its Bonus Stunt grew in $100 increments past the $10,000 mark until finally being won for $20,100 on September 23, You Bet Your Life (ended 1960) and the more lavish prize offerings on The Nighttime Price Is Right (1957‚Äì1964) were the few remaining shows offering large prizes. Only one traditional big-money quiz show, the short-lived ABC quiz 100 Grand (1963), would be attempted in the subsequent years; the networks stayed away from awarding five-figure cash jackpots until the premiere of The $10,000 Pyramid and Match Game 73 in 1973. The disappearance of the quiz shows gave rise to television's next big phenomenon‚ÄìWesterns. The scandals also resulted in a shift of the balance of power between networks and sponsors. The networks used the scandals to justify taking control of their programs away from sponsors, thereby eliminating any potential future manipulation in prime-time broadcasting, and giving the networks full autonomy over program content. None of the people directly involved in rigging any of the quiz shows faced any penalty more severe than suspended sentences for perjury before the federal grand jury that probed the scandal, even if many hosts and producers found themselves frozen out of television for many years. One Question contestant, Doll Goostree, sued both CBS and the producers in a bid to recoup $4,000 she said she might have won if her match of Question hadn't been rigged. Neither Goostree nor any other quiz contestant who similarly sued won their cases. * Louis Cowan ‚Äì In addition to Quiz Kids (1949‚Äì1951) and Stop the Music (1949‚Äì52, 1954‚Äì56), Cowan also created Down You Go (1951‚Äì1956) and the short- lived Ask Me Another (1952). Cowan briefly served as CBS Television Network president before leaving in the wake of the quiz show scandals. He later joined the faculty of the Columbia University school of journalism. He and his wife Polly were killed in an apartment fire in New York City in 1976. Lou Cowan's son Geoffrey later produced brief revivals of Quiz Kids in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s and is currently dean of the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication. * Hal March ‚Äì The former comic actor who became an overnight star on Question continued to appear as an actor in television and movies throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Shortly after he signed on as host of It's Your Bet in 1969, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and died in 1970, four months short of his 50th birthday. * Irwin \\"Sonny\\" Fox ‚Äì The first Challenge host was also known at the time for co-hosting the CBS children's travelogue Let's Take a Trip (Fox described it as \\"Taking two children on sort of an electronic field trip every week‚Äìlive, remote location, no audience, no sponsors\\"), but his fame rests predominantly on his eight-year (1959‚Äì1967) tour as the suave, congenial and dryly witty fourth host of New York's Sunday morning children's learn-and-laugh marathon, Wonderama. Fox hosted Way Out Games (1976‚Äì1977), a Saturday-morning series for CBS, then later spent a year (1977‚Äì1978) running children's programming for NBC and eventually became a chairman of the board for Population Communications International, a nonprofit dedicated to \\"technical assistance, research and training consultation to governments, NGOs and foundations on a wide range of social marketing and communications initiatives\\", for which he is still an honorary chairman. Fox has also been a board chairman for the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. * Patty Duke ‚Äì A child star (thanks to her Broadway portrayal of Helen Keller) when she appeared on Challenge, she eventually testified to Congressional investigators ‚Äì and broke to tears when she admitted she'd been coached to speak falsely, an incident Sonny Fox described when interviewed for the PBS program reviewing the quiz scandals. Duke survived to become a television star (The Patty Duke Show) in the early- to-mid-'60s, before moving on to more film and television work (including a memorable role in Valley of the Dolls), becoming an activist in the Screen Actors Guild, writing two memoirs (Call Me Anna and A Brilliant Madness) describing her troubled child acting career and her lifelong battle with manic depression, and becoming an advocate for better protection and benefits for child actors. She died on March 29, 2016, from Sepsis, resulting from a ruptured Intestine. * Charles Revson ‚Äì Inspired by cosmetics competitor Hazel Bishop (whose sponsoring of This Is Your Life provided big sales to Bishop) to think about television sponsorship in the first place, Revson was never investigated in his own right for his role in the quiz show scandals despite testifying (as did his brother, Martin) before Congress when the scandals broke in earnest. The cosmetics empire he founded, however, continued its success ‚Äì and continued to sponsor television programming ‚Äì for many years after the scandals faded away. Known as a hard-driving, hard-driven perfectionist whose overbearing manner usually alienated even his closest business partners, Revson's success left him a billionaire when he died in 1975. His charitable foundation has since given over $145 million in grants to schools, hospitals, and service organizations in various Jewish communities. * Dr. Joyce Brothers ‚Äì Only the second contestant to win the show's big prize (after expertly thwarting numerous attempts to bump her from the show because Martin Revson was said to have disliked her and doubted her credibility as a boxing expert), Brothers has enjoyed the most enduring fame and media success among anyone who rose to prominence by way of Question. Her championship as a boxing expert led to an invitation to become a commentator for CBS' telecast of a championship boxing match between Sugar Ray Robinson and Carmen Basilio. In August 1958, shortly after she earned her license to practice psychology in New York, Brothers was given her own television program, first locally in New York and then in national syndication. Making numerous television and radio appearances as a psychologist, not to mention numerous television comedy roles, Brothers has also written a long-running syndicated advice column in newspapers and magazines, which was used as a source for some questions on the 1998‚Äì2004 revival of Hollywood Squares. She is still considered, arguably, the first media psychologist. She died from respiratory failure on May 13, 2013 at age 85. * Ralph Story ‚Äì He became the much-loved host of Ralph Story's Los Angeles (1964‚Äì1970), still considered the highest-rated, best-loved local show in Los Angeles television history. Story has also hosted A.M. Los Angeles and was the narrator for the ABC series Alias Smith and Jones in 1972‚Äì1973. He died on September 26, 2006 at the age of 86. Revivals Selected PBS outlets showed surviving kinescopes of the original Question in Summer 1976, as a run- up to a new version of the show called The $128,000 Question, which ran for two years. The first season was hosted by Mike Darrow and produced at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City, while the second was produced at Global Television Network in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and hosted by Alex Trebek. In 1999, television producer Michael Davies attempted to revive Question as The $640,000 Question for ABC, before abandoning that project in favor of producing an American version of the British game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. Millionaire has a very similar format to The $64,000 Question ‚Äì 15 questions in which the contestant's money roughly doubles with each correct question until reaching the top prize. However, the questions in Millionaire are of a broader variety than Question's one-category line of questioning and have a different category for each question, contestants are allowed to leave the game with their money after a question is revealed but before it is answered, and Millionaire offers three chances for help (called \\"lifelines\\"), which were not present in Question. In 2000, responding to the success of Millionaire, CBS bought the rights to the property in a reported effort to produce another revival attempt, The $1,064,000 Question, to be hosted by sportscaster Greg Gumbel. Because of format issues similar to those encountered by Davies for ABC, this version was never broadcast.  United States broadcast history  *The $64,000 Question‚Äì CBS television; June 7, 1955‚Äì June 24, 1958 (Tuesday 10:00p.m.); September 14‚Äì November 9, 1958 (Sunday 10:00p.m.). Simulcast on CBS Radio from October 4 to November 29, 1955. *The $64,000 Challenge‚Äì CBS television; April 8, 1956‚Äì September 14, 1958; Sunday 10:00p.m. *The $128,000 Question‚Äì syndicated weekly television, September 18, 1976‚Äì September 1978. International versions =The $64,000 Question= Australia A similar version of The $64,000 Question was successful in Australia from 1960 to 1971 on Seven Network. Initially called Coles ¬£3000 Question, the show changed its name to Coles $6000 Question on February 14, 1966 (the date Australia converted to decimal currency) and was sponsored for most of its run by Coles Stores. In July 1971, Coles dropped its sponsorship and the show became The $7000 Question. It was hosted by Malcolm Searle (1960-1963) and Roland Strong (1963-1971). United Kingdom There were three derived versions in the UK: earlier, The 64,000 Question, Double Your Money (see above) and later, The $64,000 Question (despite the United Kingdom not using the dollar monitory system as their currency). Italy The Italian version of this quiz was 'Lascia o raddoppia?' (1956‚Äì1959). The prize money doubled from 2,500 lire to 5,120,000 lire. Mexico The Mexican version, \\"El Gran Premio de los 64,000 pesos\\" lasted from 1956 to 1994 with some interruptions, changes of name to compensate peso devaluation, and changes of TV network. Most of the time it was hosted by Pedro Ferriz. A movie was made in which Ferriz asks questions to a character played by Sara Garc√≠a, known then as \\"Mexican Cinema's Granny.\\" Poland The Polish version of this quiz was Wielka gra (The Great Game, 1962‚Äì2006). Initially studio and rules were identical as in original, but in 1975, the rules and studio became a bit changed by Wojciech Pijanowski, author and host of plenty of quiz shows in Poland in late 20th century, isolation booth was abandoned and there was set a big round in the center of studio with prizes for each round and envelopes with questions. After this year, categories became more accurate (e.g. Mozart - life and compositions, Muslim conquests in 7th - 8th century), limited to art, history (most categories), geography and zoology and were chosen by player during eliminations to the quiz. After 1975 game had following rounds: * First round was a duel of two players, who won eliminations, it consisted of 20 questions and lasted to two mistakes by a player. Players used special headphones with playing loud music to not hear each other. * Second round was \\"an exam\\", player, who won a duel, answered for questions of three experts of each category, each expert asked three questions. Player could make up to two mistakes. After that he received a prize. * In third, fourth round and a final round player drew envelopes with questions on the big round in the studio, prizes doubled by every next round. Main prize changed many times, primarily it were 25,000 z≈Çotys (it was equal to average annual wage), lately it were 40,000 z≈Çotys (ca. $12,000). Hosts were Ryszard Serafinowicz (1962‚Äì1969), Joanna Rostocka (1969‚Äì1973, previously hostess of Serafinowicz), Janusz Budzy≈Ñski (1973‚Äì1975) and Stanis≈Çawa Ryster (1975‚Äì2006). Despite show was cancelled due to low attendance, cancellation was considered as a scandal due to high value of this show by many people, especially attendants of the show, and leaving some non finished and not started planned games. Show had to be restored in 2016 as Wiƒôksza gra (The Greater Game) in changed formula, but eventually plans were cancelled. Sweden The Swedish version of this quiz was 'Kvitt eller dubbelt' (1957‚Äì1994).

He is known for normalizing hardcore pornography in the United States. He was described in his obituary in The New York Times as \\"a cartoonishly vituperative amalgam of Borscht Belt comic, free-range social critic and sex-obsessed loser who seemed to embody a moment in New York City's cultural history: the sleaze and decay of Times Square in the 1960s and ‚Äò70s.\\" Background Goldstein was born in Williamsburg, Brooklyn to a Jewish family. He attended Boys High. He served in the Army as a photographer (in the Signal Corps), captained the debate team at Pace College (for whose newspaper he interviewed Allen Ginsberg), and was a photojournalist, taking pictures of Jacqueline Kennedy on a 1962 state trip to Pakistan and spending several days in a Cuban jail for taking unauthorized photos of Fidel Castro's brother, Ra√∫l. He sold insurance; wrote freelance articles; ran a dime-pitch concession at the 1964-65 New York World's Fair; sold rugs, encyclopedias, and his own blood; drove a cab (he kept his hack [cab driver's] license active until his death); and landed a job as an industrial spy infiltrating a labor union, an experience that so appalled him he wrote an expos√© about it for the New York Free Press, a radical weekly. Print publications =Screw= In November 1968 in New York, Al and his partner Jim Buckley, investing $175 each, founded Screw, a weekly tabloid. It featured reviews of porn movies, peep shows, erotic massage parlors, brothels, escorts and other offerings of the adult entertainment industry. Such items were interspersed with sexual news, book reviews of sexual books, and hardcore \\"gynecological\\" pictorials. He regularly ran, without permission, photos and drawings of celebrities. \\"Screw grew from a combination of many factors, chief of which was my own dissatisfaction with the sex literature of 1968 and my yearning for a publication that reflected my sexual appetites,\\" he wrote. \\"I may be making a lot of money, but I really believe I'm doing some good by demythologizing a lot about sexuality\\", he said in a Playboy Interview. It was described as \\"raunchy, obnoxious, usually disgusting and sometimes political.\\" The initial price was 25¬¢. At its peak, Screw sold 140,000 copies a week. Arrested 19 times on obscenity charges, he spent millions on First Amendment lawsuits, ultimately scoring a major victory when a federal judge dismissed an obscenity case in 1974. (Goldstein believed that the case began as a result of Screws article, \\"Is J. Edgar Hoover a Fag?\\", the first published comment on Hoover's sexuality.) Venue-shopping prosecutors selected conservative Wichita, Kansas, to prosecute Goldstein for obscenity; when he was found not guilty, he flew the jury to New York to attend a party at the swing club Plato's Retreat. His long-term attorney was Herald Price Fahringer. According to Will Sloan, \\"Goldstein was the first journalist to seriously review porn films. Had he not written a rave review of a low-budget film called Deep Throat (‚ÄúI was never so moved by any theatrical performance since stuttering through my own bar mitzvah‚Äù), it would never have become a hit at New York's World Theater, would never have been targeted by the vice squad, would never have spawned a First Amendment cause c√©l√®bre, and might not have led to the modern porn industry.\\" =Bitch magazine= In the March 11, 1974, issue of Screw Goldstein ran an ad seeking subscribers to a new magazine, Bitch, which \\"brings women's sexuality out of the closet for the first time\\" and also \\"takes women out of politics and puts them back on their back where they belong.\\" (Note: there have been several other magazines also called Bitch.) The first issue \\"contain[ed] an explosive symposium about blowjobs by four women who talk about giving head and what they like and don't like about it\\". It also included an interview with actor James Caan, and a centerfold of a man shot by a female photographer. =Smut Magazine= In the same March 11, 1974, issue of Screw Goldstein also ran an ad seeking subscribers to Smut, a magazine \\"so filthy that not only do you have to wash after every page, but every reader must disinfect after reading! SMUT is so dirty, so scummy, that once you have it on your hands you can't get it off!\\" The magazine offered pornography in images and words, without the news articles found in Screw. =National Screw= In 1976-1977 National Screw was published; the place of publication was given as Secaucus, New Jersey. The June 1977 issue of the magazine contained, according to its cover, a new story by William Burroughs and an interview with Allen Ginsberg. It is known to have published five issues. =Death magazine= In 1979, Goldstein began Death magazine. It lasted four issues.A cover is reproduced at The February, 1980 issue had a picture of Elvis Presley on the cover, \\"Grim Reaper Awards\\", \\"Eulogy to a War Lover\\", \\"Death by Hanging\\", \\"Femme Fatales\\", and other articles. =Screw West= In 1979-1980 Goldstein's company, Milky Way Productions, published Screw West out of an office in Hollywood, California. According to an advertisement, it was intended to answer such questions as, \\"Where can I get laid in San Francisco? What's the best swinger's club in Los Angeles? How do I find all those out-of-the-way Pacific Coast nude beaches? And what are those bawdy brothels outside Las Vegas really like?\\" It is known to have published 54 issues. Movies and television =It Happened in Hollywood= In 1973, \\"Screw Magazine present[ed]\\" It Happened in Hollywood, a pornographic movie, produced by Goldstein's partner Jim Buckley. Goldstein played a character in the movie, and is also credited as \\"fourth unit director.\\" At the 2nd Annual New York Erotic Film Festival it won awards for Best Picture, Best Female Performance, and Best Supporting Actor.\\"Screw Film Sweeps Awards\\", Screw, March 26, 1973. =Midnight Blue= In 1974 Goldstein began Screw Magazine of the Air, soon renamed Midnight Blue, a thrice weekly hour-long adult-oriented public access television program that ran for nearly 30 years on Manhattan Cable's Channel J; federal regulations regarding public access to cable TV systems made it impossible for the cable system to refuse his program. (Similarly, Goldstein used a legal prohibition on the censorship of political advertisements to force television broadcast of pornography, under a transparent, but legal, veil of \\"political candidacy\\".) In it, he regularly interviewed porn stars, other adult industry figures, and sympathetic celebrities and \\"freaks\\", and ran advertisements for brothels and phone sex services. In the later years, after departure of original director Alex Bennett, Goldstein featured on each program a \\"Fuck You\\" segment, a few minutes in which he viciously attacked celebrities, politicians, the judge who presided over his latest trial, the New York County District Attorney, and businesses he felt had wronged him. In its early years, Midnight Blue presented porn star Georgina Spelvin doing her nude tap-dance act at the Melody Burlesque; Tara Alexander attempting the world's biggest gang bang at Plato's Retreat, the New York swing club; the 10th anniversary Screw party, where Buck Henry and Melvin Van Peebles hobnob with Goldstein's jurors; and an early look at the S&M; community in New York. Throughout its run, Midnight Blue interviewed almost every major porn star, and regularly hit the limits of what was acceptable for cable television.\\" Seven volumes of excerpts from the show have been reissued on DVD. =SOS: Screw on the Screen= In 1975, Goldstein issued SOS: Screw on the Screen, a stridently unsexy attempt at a cinematic newsmagazine that included a lot of goofy comedy, a gay scene, and several minutes of Goldstein ranting about America's sexual hypocrisy. Also appearing was Honeysuckle Divine (who often appeared in SCREW). A poster of her was on sale in the same issue. Honeysuckle Divine was a Times Square stripper whose specialty was inserting objects such as pickles in her vagina, shooting out many of them. She put the pickles in baggies and sold them to patrons. Goldstein said that her act \\"was unbelievably disgusting, so naturally, we made her our symbol.\\" Other business ventures =The Screw Store= In the May 17, 1976, issue of Screw Goldstein ran an ad for the \\"Screw Store\\", which offered dildos, including a \\"Bicentennial Dildo\\", vibrating Ben wa eggs, and a vibrating cock ring. Selling dildos brought one of Goldstein's many arrests.Josh Alan Friedman, \\"Al Goldstein's Personal Ephemera\\" ; accessed November 20, 2014. =Al Goldstein's Cinema= The October 17, 1977, issue of Screw contained an advertisement for \\"Al Goldstein's Cinema\\", located at 8th Avenue and 46th Street near Times Square. Admission was 99¬¢. In the same issue, in the movie listings, it is described as \\"a large, comfortable porn house which shows average hardcore features. Some of these are first-run features, some have already played theaters in the city.\\" The theater is not found in a listing of porn theaters from 1979. =Rabbit Ranch= In 2001, on Saint Martin, an island in the Lesser Antilles, Goldstein planned to open the Rabbit Ranch, the first of what he hoped would be a chain of 10 to 30 bordellos that would flourish wherever prostitution is legal. He intended to use the profits to finance his second run for sheriff. The brothel never opened; authorities refused to give him a license because he was not a citizen of that nation. \\"We didn't bribe the right people or something,\\" he said.Bob Whitby, \\"Undercurrents\\", Broward/Palm Beach New Times, May 3, 2001; retrieved October 30, 2014.  Political and religious views  = Free speech = In 1989, Goldstein ran a full page ad in Screw offering $1 million for the assassination of the Ayatollah Khomeini, in response to Khomeini's fatwa against novelist Salman Rushdie for allegedly blaspheming Islam. =View on Christianity= In his book XXX-Communicated: A Rebel Without a Shul, Luke Ford wrote about a conversation with Goldstein, in which Ford asked Goldstein why Jews were dramatically overrepresented in the porn industry. He answered, \\"The only reason that Jews are in pornography is that we think that Christ sucks. Catholicism sucks. We don't believe in authoritarianism. Pornography thus becomes a way of defiling Christian culture and, as it penetrates to the very heart of the American mainstream (and is no doubt consumed by those very same WASPs), its subversive character becomes more charged. \\" Ford then asked, \\"What does it mean to you to be a Jew?\\" To which Goldstein responded, \\"It doesn't mean anything. It means that I'm called a kike.\\" Ford also asked, \\"Do you believe in God?\\" Goldstein said, \\"I believe in me. I'm God. Screw God. God is your need to believe in some super being. I am the super being. I am your God, admit it. We're random. We're the flea on the butt of the dog.\\" Personal life =Friendship with Larry Flynt= One of Goldstein's best friends was Larry Flynt. Goldstein said that Flynt's Hustler magazine, founded seven years after Screw, stole the Hustler format from Screw, but that he was not angry. According to Goldstein, Flynt succeeded in creating a national publication, at which he had failed. =Family= Goldstein married five times and had a son, Jordan Ari Goldstein, with his third wife, Gina. According to Goldstein, he and Jordan had a close relationship until the Goldsteins' divorce. They became estranged after Al called Gina \\"a contemptible vagina\\".Al Goldstein and Josh Alan Friedman, I, Goldstein. My Screwed Life Life in Florida While mostly associated with the city of New York, Goldstein was also a well-known figure in Broward County, Florida, making the cover of a local alternative tabloid, New Times. He owned a 10,000-square-foot mansion in Pompano Beach, famous for its statue, high, of a raised middle finger on the back lawn, visible to boaters on the Intracoastal Waterway.Chris Joseph, \\"Al Goldstein, Publisher of Screw Magazine, Dies in New York at 77\\", Broward/Palm Beach New Times, December 19, 2013; retrieved October 30, 2014. In 1992, he filed to run for sheriff against Nick Navarro, who had gained Goldstein's enmity by arresting on obscenity charges 2 Live Crew members and a record dealer who sold their album As Nasty As They Wanna Be. (The accused were convicted, but won on appeal.) Goldstein withdrew before the election took place. In 2001 he spoke publicly of his intent to run a second time, against Ken Jenne, on a platform of \\"leaving folks the hell alone\\". He never filed, saying that he could not afford the campaign. Last years =Legal issues and financial woes= In 2002, Goldstein was found guilty of harassing a former employee, having published her telephone number and place of employment in Screw and encouraging readers to call her and tell her \\"to stop being such a cunt.\\" Goldstein was sentenced to 60 days in jail. He served six days before the charges were overturned on appeal. Goldstein apologized as part of a plea bargain.Albin, Stacy (October 23, 2003). \\"Pornographer In Plea Deal\\".

Goldstein's company, Milky Way Productions, which published Screw and Midnight Blue, entered bankruptcy in 2004, having lost sales and subscribers as a result of the proliferation of internet pornography, abetted by Goldstein's financial mismanagement.; Al Goldstein and Josh Alan Friedman, I, Goldstein. My Screwed Life Goldstein lost his Florida mansion and his townhouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Jobless and penniless, he ended up living briefly in a Manhattan homeless shelter.

He was financially supported in his last years by his friend the illusionist Penn Jillette, on whose floor he once slept, and who admired Goldstein for his First Amendment activism. His final residence, prior to a nursing home, was a small apartment in the Far Rockaway neighborhood of Queens, paid for by Jillette.Ashley West, \\"Remembering Al Goldstein: A Happy Jew\\", The Rialto Report, January 5, 2014; retrieved 10-30-2014. =Death= Goldstein died on December 19, 2013, aged 77, from renal failure at a nursing home in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. Legacy =Documentary= In 2003, Lancaster Pictures produced a documentary on Goldstein entitled Goldstein: The Trials of the Sultan of Smut. It focused on his legal troubles. Larry Flynt, Ron Jeremy, and Jimmy Breslin appeared in the movie.Dennis Harvey, Review: Goldstein: The Trials of the Sultan of Smut, Variety, May 27, 2004; retrieved January 20, 2005. He claimed to have had 7,000 sexual partners. Another writer called him \\"a hairy, sweaty, cigar- chomping, eczema-ridden fatso\\". =Retrospective= In his 2011 book Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! ‚Äì of Playboys, Pigs, and Penthouse Paupers, an American Tale of Sex and Wonder, former Screw writer and editor Mike Edison documents Goldstein's rise and fall against the successes of his peers Larry Flynt of Hustler, Bob Guccione of Penthouse, and Hugh Hefner of Playboy. Edison also lauds Goldstein as a staunch fighter for the First Amendment, quoting Gay Talese, who referred to Goldstein in his book Thy Neighbor's Wife, saying, \\"We need a free society, and freedom is not won by literary tea parties and well- meaning, virtuous publishers, it is won by disreputable people like Al Goldstein.\\" Edison also quotes the New York reporter Jimmy Breslin as saying, \\"Al Goldstein is one of four people in the last 35 years who has effectively protected the First Amendment rights of reporters who bring the news to you. The others are Ralph Ginzburg, Larry Flynt, and Lenny Bruce.

He was the founder of the Israelite Tribe of Naphtali. Some biblical commentators have suggested that the name Naphtali may refer to the struggle between Rachel and Leah for the favours of Jacob; Bilhah was the handmaid of Rachel, who was infertile at the time, and had persuaded Jacob to have a child with Bilhah as a proxy for having one with herself. Biblical references According to the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, Naphtali was a swift runner, though this appears to have been inferred from the Blessing of Jacob, which equates Naphtali to a hind. However, Biblical scholars believe this to actually be a description of the tribe of Naphtali. Naphtali is listed in Deuteronomy 34.2 when God takes Moses up to the mountain of Nebo and shows him the extent of the land which he had promised to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. See article on Tribe of Simeon for a map of the twelve tribes of Israel. Family According to , Naphtali had four sons: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. The name of his wife/wives are not given. He and his family migrated to Egypt, with the rest of the clan, where they remained until the Exodus. According to the apocryphal Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs, he died at 137 and was buried in Egypt. = Testament of Naphtali = In this apocryphal material, Naphtali gave his sons no commandment except regarding the fear of God, that they should serve Him and follow after Him, also admonished them not to join themselves unto the sons of Joseph but join the sons of Levi and Judah.

The older forms of Landsmannschaften were part of corporations and are closely aligned with the beginnings of universities in medieval times of the 12th and 13th centuries. The newer forms of Landsmannschaften are a kind of reform corps and most Landsmannschaften are members of the Coburger Convent.  History  In order to understand the history of German fraternities, it needs to be known that the first universities in Europe were established in the 12th and 13th century in Paris (France), Bologna and Padua (Italy), and later also in Oxford and Cambridge (England). Students joined groups in regards to region in order to have protection as well as support in being heard in their interests. The two early forms were called nations (Nationes) or colleges (Collegien) and organized not only the work but also social life and had major influence in universities as they elected the head of a university (magister) in some areas. Landsmannschaften formerly had the character of guilds. They were loosely organized bodies of students from the same region or nation naturally enough drawn together by their longings for companionship. A good example is the Mosellanerlandsmannschaft of the University of Jena. It contained members from the Rhineland, Palatinate, Swabia, and Alsace. The purposes of the organizations in general were: # to encourage friendship; # to compel the adjustment of difficulties arising among members; # to protect a ‚Äúbrother member‚Äù against slander or other attack from outsiders; # to share in social enjoyments; # to perform friendly services for one another; # to yield to the will of the majority; # to obey the president as long as he directs for the best interests of the organization.

Inc., 1963 also known as sexual continence, is a form of sexual intercourse in which the penetrative partner does not attempt to ejaculate within the receptive partner, but instead attempts to remain at the plateau phase of intercourse for as long as possible, avoiding the seminal emission. It is distinct from death grip syndrome wherein the male has no volition in his emissionless state.Levin, Roy J. \\"Male Sexual Arousal and Orgasms‚ÄîNew Enigmas of Their Activation.\\" Current Sexual Health Reports 10.3 (2018): 76-78. Alice Stockham coined the term karezza, derived from the Italian word \\"carezza\\" meaning \\"caress\\", to describe coitus reservatus, but the idea was already in practice at the Oneida Community. Alan Watts believed, in error, that karezza was a Persian word. The concept of karezza is loosely akin to maithuna in Hindu Tantra and Sahaja in Hindu Yoga. Control of ejaculation is contained in Taoist sexual practices (known as \\"cai Yin pu Yang\\" and \\"cai Yang pu Yin\\"), as well as Indian Tantra (known as \\"avagraha\\"), although conventional ejaculation is also endorsed in both.  Practice of Karezza and (sexual) continence  Stockham writes, \\"... Karezza signifies 'to express affection in both words and action,' and while it fittingly denotes the union that is the outcome of deepest human affection, love's consummation, it is used technically throughout this work to designate a controlled sexual union.\\" So that in practice, according to Stockham, it is more than just self-control, but mutual control where the penetrative partner helps the receptive partner and vice versa. According to Stockham this is the key to overcoming many difficulties encountered in trying to control sexual expression on an individual basis. Stockham's contribution was to apply this same philosophy of orgasm control to women as much as to men. A form of birth control, the technique also prolongs sexual pleasure to the point of achieving mystical ecstasy, according to J. William Lloyd, a practitioner of Karezza, whose own experience of cosmic consciousness appears in Cosmic Consciousness, a book written by the Canadian psychiatrist Richard M. Bucke, a friend of the American poet Walt Whitman.Bucke, Richard Maurice, M. D. Cosmic Consciousness, p. 284, Citadel Press, 1961, In this practice, orgasm is separated from ejaculation, making possible enjoyment of the pleasure of sexual intercourse without experiencing seminal ejaculation, while still experiencing orgasm. Some would have the principles of karezza applied to masturbation, whereby a person attempts to delay orgasm as long as possible to prolong pleasure in a process known as \\"orgasmic brinkmanship\\", \\"surfing\\", or \\"edging,\\" but this is different from the heterosexual practice of \\"karezza\\".Ruth Marie Griffith Born Again Bodies, p. 92, University of California Press, 2004 In Latin literature, this is known as coitus sine ejaculatione seminis.Lloyd, J. William The Karezza Method Health Research, 1964, Mokelumne Hill, California One purpose of karezza is the maintenance, and indeed, intensification of desire and enjoyment of sexual pleasure within the context of relationships. According to Stockham, it takes from two weeks to a month for the body to recover from ejaculation ... \\"Unless procreation is desired, let the final propagative orgasm be entirely avoided\\". Stockham advocated that the 'honeymoon period' of a relationship could be maintained in perpetuity by limiting the frequency of ejaculations, or, preferably avoiding them entirely. Kalman Andras Oszlar writes, \\"Inasmuch as sexual togetherness is not limited into the physical world and does not mean quick wasting of sexual energies, by this we give free way to higher dimensions in the relationship.\\" Affected by this, we may get into the state of flow, and in the course of this, the couple charges up with energy, while ‚Äì with focused attention (DhƒÅra·πáƒÅ) ‚Äì the couple is submerging in that in which they are having pleasure. This state of mind is connected with the achieved beneficial effects by tantric restraint and transformation. At first, the definition of positive philosophy was defined by Mih√°ly Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi, and since then it is referred beyond the professional line. According to the professor, the flow experience is an entirely focused and a motivationally intensified experience where in the course of this people can entirely focus and properly command their feelings for the best performance or learning. =General= There is a slight difference between karezza and coitus reservatus. In coitus reservatus, unlike karezza, a woman can enjoy a prolonged orgasm while a man exercises self-control. Like coitus interruptus, coitus reservatus is not a reliable form of preventing a sexually transmitted disease, as the penis leaks pre-ejaculate prior to ejaculation, which may contain all of the same infectious viral particles and bacteria as the semen. Although studies have not found sperm in pre-ejaculate fluid, the method is also unreliable for contraception because of the difficulty of controlling ejaculation beyond the point of no return. Additionally, it is possible for pre-ejaculate fluid to collect sperm from a previous ejaculation, leading to pregnancy even when performed correctly. =Views on coitus reservatus= The Oneida Community, founded in the 19th century by John Humphrey Noyes, experimented with coitus reservatus which was then called male continence in a religiously Christian communalist environment. The experiment lasted for about a quarter of a century and then Noyes went on to create Oneida silverware and establish the Oneida Silver Co. that grew into Oneida Limited. Noyes identified three functions of the sexual organs: the urinary, the propagative, and the amative. Noyes believed in the separation of the amative from the propagative, and he put amative sexual intercourse on the same footing with other ordinary forms of social interchange. Sexual intercourse as Noyes defines it is the insertion of the penis into the vagina; ejaculation is not a requirement for sexual intercourse. Alt URL English novelist Aldous Huxley, in his last novel Island wrote that Maithuna, the Yoga of Love is \\"the same as what Roman Catholicism means by coitus reservatus.\\"Huxley, Aldous Island, Harper & Row, 1962 Getting to the point by discussing coitus reservatus, Alan W. Watts in Nature, Man and Woman notes: \\"...I would like to see someone make a case for the idea that the Apostles really did hand down an inner tradition to the Church, and that through all these centuries the Church has managed to guard it from the public eye. If so, it has remained far more secret and \\"esoteric\\" than in any of the other great spiritual traditions of the world, so much so that its existence is highly doubtful...\\"\\"Watts, Alan W. Nature, Man and Woman, Ch 7, Pantheon Books Inc. 1958 The Welsh writer Norman Lewis, in his celebrated account of life in Naples in 1944, claimed that San Rocco was the patron saint of coitus reservatus: \\"I recommended him to drink -- as the locals did -- marsala with the yolk of eggs stirred into it, and to wear a medal of San Rocco, patron of coitus reservatus, which could be had in any religious-supplies shop\\". The psychologist Havelock Ellis writes: \\"Coitus Reservatus, ‚Äì in which intercourse is maintained even for very long periods, during which a woman may orgasm several times while the penetrative partner succeeds in holding back orgasm ‚Äì so far from being injurious to a woman, is probably the form of coitus which gives her the maximum gratification and relief\\". = Catholic Church and Coitus Reservatus = The Catholic Church does allow coitus reservatus: * In Moral Theology (Liguori), St. Alphonsus Liguori allows it in marriage, if mutual (when both spouses restrain themselves from orgasm). * The Holy See in volume number 44https://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-44-1952-ocr.pdf page 546 of Acta Apostolicae Sedis Admonishes 'amplexum reservatum (embracement reserved): Sacerdotes autem (Priests moreover), in cura animarum (in the care of souls) et in conscientiis dirigendis (and in the directing of consciences), numquam (never), sive sponte sive interrogati (if own initiative or if questioned), ita loqui praesumant quasi (presume to speak as if) ex parte legis christianae (on the part of the Christian law) contra ¬´ amplexum reservatum ¬ª nihil esset obiicendum (was no objection against ‚Äòamplexus reservatus‚Äô ). * John F. Harvey OSFS confirmed and explained coitus reservatus. The spouses should avoid undue frustration. They must not intend orgasm for either of them. If unintentionally one of them reaches the climax, then they must try to stimulate the other spouse to reach the climax, too.See http://www.twotlj.org/grisez_collaborators.html for the team credentials, http://www.twotlj.org for \\"Nihil obstat\\" and \\"Imprimatur\\". That differs from how one author uses the same term \\"amplexus reservatus\\" for non-penetrative, rubbing-only sex. The same source claims that coitus reservatus is subject to the same arguments as Coitus interruptus, but with no citation at all. Another author wrote that the Catholic Church condemned this practice. See official Catholic teaching referenced above.  Rosicrucians  The AMORC Rosicrucians declare openly that they do not engage in sexual practices of an occult nature. This has been so since their First Imperator H. Spencer Lewis, Ph. D. made it public knowledge.Lewis, H. Spencer Rosicrucian Manual, p. 5, Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC, 1978 Their rival organization Fraternitas Rosae Crucis led by Dr. R. Swinburne Clymer engages in sexual practices for the sake of race regeneration. Dr. Clymer is completely opposed to the practice of Karezza or coitus reservatus and advocates instead a form of sex intercourse in which the couple experiences the orgasm at the same time.Clymer, R. Swinburne MD, The Mystery of Sex and Race Regeneration, p. 223, The Philosophical Publishing Co., 1950 The Secretary of the FUDOSI instead heartily approves the practice of Karezza to establish harmony in the family as well as in the world by preventing the waste and misuse of sex energy.Marc Lanval, editor, Lumi√®re et Libert√©, Organe Officiel de la Ligue Belge de Propagande H√©liophile, Octobre-Novembre 1933 Dr. Arnold Krumm-Heller established the Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua (FRA), a Rosicrucian school in Germany with branches in South America, having the following formula of sexual conduct: \\"Immissio Membri Virile In Vaginae Sine Ejaculatio Seminis\\" (Introduce the penis in the vagina without ejaculating the semen). Samael Aun Weor experimented with that formula and developed the doctrine of The Perfect Matrimony.  \\"Dianism\\" in Sex Magick  Inspired by Ida Craddock's work Heavenly Bridegrooms, American occultist C.F. Russell developed his own curriculum of sex magick. In the 1960s, disciple Louis T. Culling published these in two works entitled The Complete Magickal Curriculum of the Secret Order G.'.B.'.G.'. and Sex Magick. The first two degrees are \\"Alphaism and Dianism\\"., Chappell, V. (2010). Sexual outlaw, erotic mystic: The essential Ida Craddock. San Francisco, CA: Red Wheel/Weiser. Culling writes that Dianism is \\"sexual congress without bringing it to climax\\" and that each participant is to regard their partner not as a \\"known earthly personality\\" but as a \\"visible manifestation of one's Holy Guardian Angel.  Controversy  Alice Stockham was taken to court and forced to give up teaching the practice of Karezza in the United States. Like many other sex reformers, Dr. Stockham was arrested by Anthony Comstock.John P. Deveney Paschal B. Randolph, p. 393, SUNY Press, 1997 He jailed for long terms a variety of spiritual marriage reformers including Paschal Beverly Randolph who had been a personal friend of Abraham Lincoln.Paschal B.

The taxonomy of the towhees has been under debate in recent decades, and formerly this bird and the spotted towhee were considered a single species, the rufous- sided towhee. Their breeding habitat is brushy areas across eastern North America. They nest either low in bushes or on the ground under shrubs. Northern birds migrate to the southern United States. There has been one record of this species as a vagrant to western Europe: a single bird in Great Britain in 1966. The song is a short drink your teeeeea lasting around one second, starting with a sharp call (\\"drink!\\") and ending with a short trill \\"teeeeea\\". The name \\"towhee\\" is onomatopoeic description of one of the towhee's most common calls, a short two-part call rising in pitch and sometimes also called a \\"chewink\\" call. Taxonomy The eastern towhee was described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae and given the binomial name Fringilla erythrophthalma. This species is now placed in the genus Pipilo that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816. The specific name erythrophthalmus/erythrophthalma combines the Ancient Greek words ŒµœÅœÖŒ∏œÅŒøœÇ eruthros \\"red\\" and ŒøœÜŒ∏Œ±ŒªŒºŒøœÇ ophthalmos \\"eye\\". Four subspecies are recognised: * P. e. erythrophalmus (Linnaeus, 1758), found south-central and southeast Canada to the eastern United States * P. e. canaster (Howell, AH, 1913), found in the interior southeast United States * P. e. rileyi (Koelz, 1939), found in the coastal southeast United States except for central and southern Florida * P. e. alleni (Coues, 1871) found in south and central Florida Description The eastern towhee is a large and striking species of sparrow.

Retrieved on 2013-01-05.Eastern Towhee Pipilo erythrophthalmus . Georgia Museum of Natural History (2008). Retrieved on 2013-01-05. The body of mass of this species ranges from , with an average of .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . Adults have rufous sides, a white belly, and a long dark tail with white edges. The eyes are red, white for birds in the southeast. Males have a black head, upper body, and tail; these parts are brown in the female. Juveniles are brown overall. Eastern towhees of all ages and both sexes generally are unmistakable and are not known to co- exist with the similar western spotted towhee. Distribution The eastern towhee occurs throughout the eastern United States and southeast Canada. Occurrences from southern Saskatchewan, southwest Ontario and Quebec south to Florida, and west to eastern Texas are noted in a literature review. Populations north of southern New England through northern Indiana and Illinois to southern Iowa primarily are summer residents. Pipilo e. erythrophthalmus occurs in the most northerly part of the eastern towhee's distribution in the summer, and in winter migrates to the southern and eastern portion of the range of the species. The other subspecies are largely residents. Pipilo e. canaster occurs from south-central Louisiana, north to northeastern Louisiana east through Mississippi, extreme southwestern Tennessee, northern Alabama and Georgia, central South Carolina to western North Carolina, and south to northwestern Florida and east along the Gulf Coast.American Ornithologists' Union. (1957). Checklist of North American birds. 5th ed. Baltimore, MD: The Lord Baltimore Press, Inc. The range of P. e. rileyi extends from northern Florida through southern Georgia and coastal South Carolina to east-central North Carolina. Pipilo e. alleni occurs in peninsular Florida. The eastern towhee occurs in vegetation of disturbed areas, such as old-field successional vegetation and shrubby areas of power line right-of-ways. In northwestern Arkansas, eastern towhees occurred in old- field vegetation where dwarf sumac (Rhus copallina) occurred at a frequency of 28.6%, winged elm (Ulmus alata) at a frequency of 21%, and black cherry (Prunus serotina) at a frequency of 19.2%. Shrubby vegetation along power lines is commonly used by eastern towhees.Gates, J. Edward; Dixon, Kenneth R. (1981). Right-of-way utilization by forest- and corridor-breeding bird populations. In: Arner, Dale, ed. Environmental concerns in right-of-way management: Proceeding of 2nd symposium; 1979 October 16‚Äì18; Ann Arbor, MI. Special Study Project WS-78-141: 66‚Äì1 to 66‚Äì7 For example, in Maryland, eastern towhee territories along a power line right-of-way corresponded with shrubby areas containing species such as Allegheny blackberry (Rubus allegheniensis) and blueberry (Vaccinium spp.). Other species included hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), red maple (Acer rubrum), black cherry, and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia). Timing of major life events Female Arrival and departure of eastern towhees into summer breeding grounds varies with location. According to a literature review, eastern towhees typically arrive in New York in early April and leave by the middle of November. A review of eastern towhees in New Hampshire describes arrival in late April to May with the majority departing in September. Further south, on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina, migration to high-elevation areas within the Great Smoky Mountains begins as early as March. Eastern towhees typically leave these sites in October. The Pipilo e. erythrophthalmus subspecies is the most migratory of the subspecies.National Geographic Society. (1999). Field guide to the birds of North America. 3rd ed. Washington, DC: The National Geographic Society . Breeding begins in spring and continues to late summer. Reports of eastern towhees nesting as early as late March in Florida and Georgia, in mid- to late April in some midwestern states, and as late as mid-May in northern New England were summarized in a literature review. Literature reviews also report nest construction by the female, which takes about three to five days. Egg laying typically occurs until August. For example, a review of eastern towhees in Indiana notes nesting from 15 April to 20 August. However, a literature review of eastern towhees in Florida included a report of a nest observed on 2 September 1983 that contained two eggs. According to several literature reviews, eastern towhees may renest after failed nesting attempts and can raise two, and in the south sometimes three, broods per season. In a literature review, Greenlaw reports mean breeding territory size of (range , n=24) in a mesic oak (Quercus species) forest where eastern towhees occurred at a density of 21 males/40 ha. In a xeric pine (Pinus species)-oak woodland where the eastern towhee density was 32 males/40 ha, mean eastern towhee territory size was (range , n=20). In Massachusetts, mean male eastern towhee territory size was about , and female eastern towhee territory size was . Territory size changed over the course of the breeding season and was not significantly (p>0.05) affected by reductions in food availability of 30% or less. During the winter eastern towhees are not as territorial and may be seen in mixed species flocks. Daily movement of eastern towhees in loblolly (P. taeda) and longleaf pine (P. palustris) forests and clearcuts in South Carolina averaged per day. Only 2 females, out of 11 females and 9 males, stayed within the stand where they were captured for the duration of a 10-week study. Eastern towhees have fairly strong fidelity to breeding territories. In an oak forest in New Jersey, adult eastern towhee return rates were 20% the 1st year after banding and 43% in subsequent years. Between 1960 and 1967, the maximum number of eastern towhee returns to the site was 5. In a Pennsylvania woodlot observed between 1962 and 1967, an eastern towhee returned to the site for 4 consecutive years. Several reviews report eastern towhee clutch sizes from 2 to 6 eggs, with means ranging from 2.45 to 3.6 eggs per nest. All 5 eastern towhee nests on Sanibel Island, Florida, contained 3 eggs. Eastern towhees in 2 pitch pine (P. rigida) barrens sites in New Jersey and New York had a later median egg laying date (mid-June) and significantly (p<0.05) smaller average early nest clutch sizes (NJ=2.67, NY=3.25) than those in an oak-hickory (Carya spp.) site, which had a median egg-laying date in early June and an average early nest clutch size of 3.88. Food availability likely explains at least some of the differences between the 2 habitat types. Eggs are incubated by the female for 12 or 13 days. After hatching both parents feed the young, which fledge 10 to 12 days later and are dependent on parental care for about another month.Foss, Carol R. (1994). Atlas of breeding birds in New Hampshire. Dover, NH: Audubon Society of New Hampshire . A wide range of eastern towhee nest success values have been reported. On Sanibel Island, 1 of the 5 eastern towhee nests observed was successful. In Louisiana, average daily nest success rate was 95.3% on a bottomland hardwood forest site. The same study found a 92.6% average daily nest success rate in a 6-year-old managed cottonwood (Populus spp.) plantation in Alabama. Average eastern towhee nest success across mixed bigtooth (P. grandidentata) and quaking aspen (P. tremuloides) stands of varying ages in Pennsylvania was 48.1%. In South Carolina, only 1 of 10 nests was successful, and the mean daily nest survival rate was 62.9%. This low value was explained by high levels of predation. Due to lower nest success rates of Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis) than the previous year, it is suggested that eastern towhee nest success may have been measured during a comparatively poor year. Compared to nests, adult towhee survival rates are high. Average weekly adult survival rate of eastern towhees in a South Carolina study area was 99.3%. This rate was obtained from radio-marked eastern towhees and represented the pooled survival of both sexes and from 2 South Carolina sites, young and mature stands of loblolly and longleaf pine. Between 1962 and 1967 in Pennsylvania, annual survival of breeding eastern towhees calculated from mistnetting recaptures was 58%. According to a literature review, both males and females become reproductively mature in their second year. Eastern towhees of over 12 years old have been reported in the wild. Preferred habitat Eastern towhee singing in Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge in New York Eastern towhees range from near sea level to as high as along the border of Tennessee and North Carolina during the summer.Stupka, Arthur. 1963. Notes on the birds of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Knoxville, TN: The University of Tennessee Press A literature review reports eastern towhees up to in New Hampshire. Eastern towhees spend the majority of their time near the ground. For instance, in Pennsylvania in spring, observations of eastern towhees below from the ground occurred significantly (p<0.05) more than expected based on random spatial distribution, and observations above occurred significantly (p<0.05) less than would be expected. In a Louisiana bottomland forest 62% of eastern towhee observations were within of the ground, and only 4% were observed above . In the spring this changed, with detections of eastern towhees below declining from 70% to 65% and detections in the canopy (>) increasing from 4% to 7%. Eastern towhees occur in many habitats, from tallgrass prairies and marshes to mature forests. However, eastern towhees are most common in early successional stands, habitat edges, and areas with similar vegetation structure throughout eastern forests. In most communities eastern towhees are more abundant in young successional stands. Several studies found increased eastern towhee abundance on early successional sites compared to later-successional sites. Mean number of breeding eastern towhees (0.70 bird/50-m radius) and nest success rate (58%) were higher in a 15-year-old clearcut in West Virginia, than in other treatments, including a stand of yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), black cherry, red maple, sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and white ash (Fraxinus americana) that was not harvested. In a southern Missouri oak- hickory forest, eastern towhees were not present before clearcutting or in the nearby uncut forest after cutting, but occurred at a mean density of 9.3 birds/10 ha in a 3-year-old clearcut. A study of stands of varying ages in central New York found that eastern towhee density peaked in early successional stands. Although eastern towhees generally prefer young successional sites, variation between habitat types and years has been observed. Krementz and Powell found higher relative abundance of eastern towhee in young (2‚Äì6 years old) stands of loblolly and longleaf pine than mature (32‚Äì98 years old) stands when investigated in 1995. However, in stands compared in 1996, the 95% confidence intervals of eastern towhee relative abundance on the 2 sites had a substantial degree of overlap. The degree to which eastern towhee responds to succession is influenced by habitat. For example, in Pennsylvania there was a significant (p<0.05) difference between eastern towhee densities (number/10 ha) between mature mixed-oak forest and stands that had been clearcut about 5 years previously. However, eastern towhee densities did not differ significantly between a 1-year old mixed aspen (Populus tremuloides, P. grandidentata) clearcut, a 5-year old aspen clearcut, and a mature aspen stand. Eastern towhee abundance has been shown to peak at different times in different habitats. For instance, although in central hardwood forests eastern towhees were most abundant in regenerating stands, in loblolly and shortleaf pine forest they were most common in pole timber and mature stands. In addition, Bell and Whitmore concluded that early successional is likely too broad of a term for describing optimal towhee habitat, since high density of small trees was negatively associated with eastern towhee density in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia. Eastern towhees seem to prefer sites with characteristics generally associated with early successional vegetation, such as low canopy cover and dense understory. Negative correlations between eastern towhee abundance and various measurements of overstory density have been found in several studies.Bay, Michael Daymon. (1994). Effects of area and vegetation on breeding bird communities in early successional oldfields. Fayetteville, AR: University of Arkansas. Dissertation. Average density of eastern towhees across 6 habitat types in Pennsylvania was significantly (p<0.05) negatively correlated with density of overstory trees and basal area of overstory trees. Number of eastern towhees in a western Virginia hardwood forest was also significantly (p<0.05) inversely correlated with total percent canopy cover. In a loblolly pine forest in South Carolina, the average number of eastern towhee breeding territories per experimental unit was significantly (p‚â§0.008) negatively correlated with mid-story () pine (Pinus spp.) and deciduous volume. Many studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between eastern towhee abundance and understory density. In a loblolly pine forest in South Carolina, understory () pine volume was significantly (p<0.001) positively correlated with the average number of eastern towhee territories per experimental unit. Yahner found the average density of eastern towhees over 6 habitat types was significantly (p<0.05) positively correlated with density of short (2‚Äì5-foot (0.5‚Äì1.5 m)) shrubs. In east-central Florida slash pine (P. elliottii) flatwoods with understories dominated by myrtle oak (Q. myrtifolia) and sand live oak (Q. geminata) and in scrub sites with scattered slash pine and cabbage palmetto (Sabal palmetto), eastern towhee densities were significantly (p=0.01) negatively correlated with mean shrub height. Eastern towhees may associate with and avoid certain plants. In Nevada, Towhees seem to prefer a habitat in which they are camouflaged such as flowering quince which matches their rufous coloration. In riparian vegetation in Iowa, eastern towhee density was significantly (p‚â§0.01) positively associated with total plant and vine species richness and negatively correlated with forb and deciduous tree species richness. In West Virginia, eastern towhees were associated with plant species that occurred on drier ridgetops, such as blackberry (p<0.02), black cherry (p<0.002), and black locust (p<0.04). These sites tended to have open canopies and low tree density. Eastern towhee density was negatively associated with plants of the moister parts of this study area, such as black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica, p<0.006), red maple (p<0.001), and witch hazel (p<0.03). In central New Jersey eastern towhees were significantly (p=0.03) more abundant in gray dogwood (Cornus racemosa) shrubland than either eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) or multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora) shrublands. Nesting habitat: Eastern towhees typically nest on or near the ground. Several literature reviews note the predominance of eastern towhee nests below .Mumford, Russell E.; Keller, Charles E. (1984). The birds of Indiana. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press . In a study of cowbird parasitism on Sanibel Island, all 5 eastern towhee nests located were within of the ground. Nests as high as have been reported in literature reviews.Greenlaw, Jon S. (1996). Easter towhee ‚Äì Pipilo erythrophthalmus. In: Poole, A.; Gill, F., eds. The birds of North America. No. 262: 1‚Äì32 Nests higher off the ground in mixed aspen stands of varying ages in Pennsylvania had significantly (p<0.001) lower nest success. Of 13 unsuccessful eastern towhee nests, 11 were greater than above the ground. In West Virginia, there were no significant (p>0.05) differences in habitat surrounding successful and unsuccessful nests. Large snags (‚â•9 inches diameter at breast height (‚â•22.9 cm)) did not have an effect on nesting success. Nesting success was not significantly (p>0.05) affected by stand age or distance to edge in even-aged mixed-aspen stands in Pennsylvania. Eastern towhees nest in a variety of species including grape and blueberry (Vaccinium spp.). The majority of nests observed in South Carolina loblolly and longleaf pine forests and clearcuts were located in grape, tree sparkleberry (V. arboreum), and oak (Quercus spp.). On an oak-hickory site in West Virginia, 27% of 41 eastern towhee nests were found in grape, 17% in blackberry (Rubus spp.), 12% in greenbrier (Smilax spp.), and 12% in mountain-laurel (Kalmia latifolia). Nests also occurred in Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), spice bush (Lindera benzoin), and azalea (Rhododendron spp.). In a power line right-of-way in Pennsylvania, the 6 eastern towhee nests observed occurred in Allegheny blackberry, witch- hazel (Hamamelis virginiana), blueberry (Vaccinium spp.), white oak (Q. alba), eastern hayscented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula) and sweetfern (Comptonia peregrina) combined, and on ground level. According to literature reviews, eastern towhee nests located on the ground are embedded in litter in dry areas and typically occur at the base of grasses, forbs, low shrubs, or small trees. Foraging habitat: Selection of foraging habitat by eastern towhees has been investigated in Massachusetts and New Jersey. When gleaning in a southeastern Massachusetts pitch pine barren, eastern towhees preferred species such as pitch pine, bear oak (Q. ilicifolia), and other deciduous trees, mainly oaks. Ericaceous species were avoided. Use differed significantly (p<0.001) from availability. On 2 New Jersey sites, eastern towhee foraging preference switched over the course of the breeding season. On a site dominated by oaks, primarily black oak (Q. velutina), eastern towhees used oaks in May, as would be expected due to their density. However, in June and July, as relative arthropod biomass declined in oaks, use of oaks was less than would be expected. On a pitch pine-dominated site, use of oaks (primarily bear oak and blackjack oak (Q. marilandica)) was greater than would be expected in May, but was proportionate to availability in June and July. These negative correlations between date and oak use were significant (p<0.025) for both sites. Use of the oak-dominated site also decreased significantly (p<0.05) through the summer. Effects of spatial area: Eastern towhees appear to prefer edge habitats in many areas. For instance, the mean abundance of eastern towhees in a baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) in northern Florida was 18, while eastern towhees did not occur in either the baldcypress forest or the clearcut. At the interface of the baldcypress stand and a 13-year-old planted slash pine stand, mean abundance of eastern towhees was 22 breeding birds, while in the planted slash pine stand the average abundance was 15 breeding birds. Density of eastern towhees was found to decline with distance from the edge of a power line right-of-way and an oak-hickory forest in eastern Tennessee. At the edge, eastern towhees occurred at a density of just over 10 pairs/40 ha, while from the edge eastern towhee density had dropped to 1 pair/40 ha. In addition, in experimentally clearcut Pennsylvanian forests composed of white oak, northern red oak (Q. rubra), chestnut oak (Q. prinus), scarlet oak (Q. coccinea), red maple, quaking aspen, bigtooth aspen, and pitch pine, male towhees were detected significantly (p<0.05) more often than expected in the areas where the spatial arrangement of clearcuts was most patchy. Several studies have addressed the effect of the size of habitat patches on eastern towhees. In mixed-oak forest in New Jersey, eastern towhee frequency generally increased with patch size, although eastern towhees were detected in all plot sizes () except 0.02‚Äìacre (0.01 ha) plots. On a site in South Carolina, eastern towhee frequency of occurrence increased as clearcut size increased from < to clearcut sizes from 21 to about 32 acres (8.5‚Äì12.8 ha). On another site eastern towhee frequency declined as clearcut size increased from . Eastern towhees only bred in riparian vegetation patches in Iowa that were at least wide. In southern and eastern Pennsylvania eastern towhee nest success was not significantly (p‚â•0.10) different on sites with gradual edges and those with more distinct edges between \\"wildlife habitat openings\\" and oak-hickory forest. Food habits Eastern towhees primarily eat on the ground, although they also glean from vegetation. In a southeastern Massachusetts pitch pine barren, 73.5% of male and 80.4% of female foraging observations were on the ground. When foraging on the ground eastern towhees use a scratching technique where both feet kick back simultaneously.Stevenson, Henry M.; Anderson, Bruce H. 1994. The birdlife of Florida. Gainesville, FL: University of Florida Press In a laboratory study 4 eastern towhees used this method to successfully obtain seed buried almost deep. When foraging above ground the majority of time is spent gleaning foliage. In Massachusetts, 22.5% of male and 16.3% of female foraging observations were of food being gleaned from foliage. Eastern towhees were also observed gleaning from twigs, branches, and trunks. When gleaning, eastern towhees occurred significantly (p<0.01) more often on the distal half of tree branches compared to using distal and proximal portions equally. In 0.5% of male and 0.3% of female foraging observations, eastern towhees hovered. Eastern towhees were never observed catching food out of the air. Eastern towhees eat a variety of plant and animal matter. In literature reviews, eastern towhees are reported to eat seeds and fruits, several invertebrates, and occasionally small amphibians, snakes, and lizards. Reviews report eastern towhees foraging at feeders. Reviews show that animal matter makes up a larger proportion of the diet in the breeding season. In fall and winter, plants make up 79% and 85% of the diet, respectively. This drops to 53% in spring and 43% in summer. Insects such as beetles (Coleoptera), grasshoppers and crickets (Orthoptera), ants, wasps, and bees (Hymenoptera), and moths and caterpillars (Lepidoptera) are common prey items. Eastern towhees eat other invertebrates such as spiders (Araneae), millipedes (Diplopoda), centipedes (Chilopoda), and snails (Gastropoda) to a lesser extent.Martin, Alexander C.; Zim, Herbert S.; Nelson, Arnold L. (1951). American wildlife and plants. New York: McGraw-Hill Bood Company, Inc. Plants that comprise at least 5% of the eastern towhee diet include ragweed (Ambrosia spp.), oak, smartweed (Polygonum spp.), and corn (Zea mays) in the Northeast and blackberry, oak, panicgrass (Panicum spp.), ragweed, and wax-myrtle (Morella cerifera) in the Southeast. Predators Many animals prey on eastern towhees and their eggs, including reptiles, mammals, and birds. A literature review summarizes several reports demonstrating that predators are a major cause of nest failure. The highest nest predation rate noted was 88% in a New York study. Mammals that are likely nest predators include northern raccoons (Procyon lotor), domestic cats (Felis catus), and eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus). Snakes such as bullsnakes (Pituophis catenifer), rat snakes (Elaphe spp.) and garter snakes (Thamnophis spp.) have been reported eating eastern towhee eggs. Weasels (Mustela spp.) and blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) are also likely nest predators. Several birds are known to prey on both young and adult eastern towhees, including northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Broad-winged (Buteo platypterus), short-tailed (Buteo brachyurus), sharp-shinned (Accipiter striatus) and Cooper's hawks (Accipiter cooperii). Other predators include barred (Strix varia), short-eared (Asio flammeus) and eastern screech-owls (Megascops asio) and even the loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), which is scarcely larger than a towhee.Ogden, J.

In Maryland, an eastern towhee was found in the stomach contents of a red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Brown- headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) parasitize eastern towhee nests. In a South Carolina old field, 5 of 19 eastern towhee nests were parasitized. Each parasitized nest contained 1 Brown-headed Cowbird egg. The desertion rate for parasitized nests was 20%, which was similar to nests that had not been parasitized (21%). Two of the five Brown-headed Cowbird eggs produced fledglings. The study did not determine if there was a difference in nest success between parasitized and nonparasitized nests. In West Virginia, only 3 of 41 eastern towhee nests were parasitized by the Brown-headed Cowbird. Average number of fledged young in nonparasitized nests was 2.8, which was similar to the average of 2.7 fledglings per parasitized nest. In a Pennsylvania study site, only 2 of 36 nests were parasitized and both produced eastern towhee fledglings.Diefenbach, Duane R. 1996. Abundance and nest success of songbirds in simple and complex edge habitats. Final Report Project 06510. Harrisburg, PA: Pennsylvania Game Commission In a study of nest parasitism on Sanibel Island, none of 5 eastern towhee nests found were parasitized.

A prolific session bassist, he has played bass for acts such as The Who, the John Mayer Trio, Nine Inch Nails, Gary Numan, Jeff Beck, D'Angelo and The Power Station.  Early life  The son of a Welsh mother and Italian father (from Campobasso), Giuseppe Henry Palladino was born in Cardiff on 17 October 1957. He attended a Catholic school. He began playing guitar at age 14 and bass guitar at 17. He bought his first fretless bass one year later, playing mostly R&B;, funk and Reggae Career Palladino was drawn to Motown and jazz at an early age, and took classical guitar lessons. He liked Led Zeppelin and Yes and started a rock band. In 1982, Palladino recorded with Gary Numan on the album I, Assassin. Following this, he was asked to contribute to Paul Young's debut album. Young's cover version of \\"Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)\\" by Marvin Gaye became a hit in Europe, and Palladino subsequently joined Young's band, the Royal family. He received offers to record with Joan Armatrading, Go West, and David Gilmour. He cites as early influences James Jamerson, Danny Thompson, and Norman Watt-Roy and also admires Jaco Pastorius, Stanley Clarke, Bootsy Collins, Larry Graham, Michael Henderson, Anthony Jackson, Marcus Miller, and Rocco Prestia. In 1991, he joined The Law with Paul Rodgers, formerly of Bad Company, and drummer Kenney Jones, who succeeded Keith Moon in The Who after Moon died, and recorded the album The Law. In the 1990s, Palladino alternated between fretless bass and fretted and 4-string and 6-string bass. He played with Melissa Etheridge, Richard Wright, Elton John, and Eric Clapton. Steve Jordan, John Mayer, and Pino Palladino He played on Mike Lindup's first solo album, Changes with Dominic Miller on guitar and Manu Katch√© on drums. In 1999, he began working with Richard Ashcroft of The Verve on Ashcroft's debut solo album, Alone With Everybody. The Who's bassist John Entwistle died the night before the start of their first tour in two years. Palladino became the band's bass guitarist on tour. In 2006, he joined the remaining band members on their first album in twenty-four years, Endless Wire. He played with The Who at the Super Bowl XLIV half-time show in 2010 with Simon Townshend on guitar, Zak Starkey on drums, and John \\"Rabbit\\" Bundrick on keyboards. In 2012, he toured with The Who on their Quadrophenia revival. He stopped touring with The Who in 2016, but is still occasionally involved in studio sessions, appearing on their 2019 album titled Who. Palladino met Steve Jordan in the mid-1980s while both were working as session musicians, which blossomed into a friendship. Jordan credits Palladino's apparent ability to \\"feel\\" changes in music, through melodies, basslines, and an embrace of genres of nearly every kind. According to Jordan, he had planned to meet up with John Mayer and Willie Weeks in January 2005 to perform Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope for victims of the tsunami that struck southeast Asia. Weeks was unable to make the performance, and Jordan suggested Palladino, who had heard some of Mayer's work and was willing to come. Beginning a set that included the Jimi Hendrix song \\"Bold as Love\\", the three found a chemistry together. They recorded an album and toured as a trio. At the Amarone in Jazz festival, San Pietro in Cariano, Italy, September 2008 They released the album Try!, on 22 November 2005. The eleven-track live album includes cover versions of \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\" by Jimi Hendrix and \\"I Got A Woman\\" by Ray Charles, two songs from Mayer's album Heavier Things, and new songs by Mayer. In addition, Mayer, Palladino, and Jordan are credited as songwriters on three songs: \\"Good Love Is on the Way\\", \\"Vultures\\", and \\"Try!\\". Palladino appeared on Mayer's third album Continuum, fourth album Battle Studies and seventh album The Search for Everything. In March and April 2006, Palladino toured with Jeff Beck and played with J. J. Cale, and Eric Clapton on their 2006 album The Road to Escondido. In 2009, he formed a trio with keyboardist Philippe Saisse and Simon Phillips. He played with Simon and Garfunkel on their Old Friends reunion tour. In January 2011, he entered the studio with D'Angelo to finish recording Black Messiah. In 2013, he played on the Nine Inch Nails album Hesitation Marks and was a member of the touring band. Additionally, he co-produced Jos√© James' album No Beginning No End (2013). Technique and equipment Palladino is noted for his use of the fretless bass on many albums. While it was typical for a bass guitar in a commercial track to have a rather generic sound and stay \\"playing the low notes\\", Palladino preferred a different sound, combining fretless tone with an octaver effect, and basslines that frequently added chords, lead lines, and counter- melodies in the higher range of the instrument. Typical of this style was his playing on Paul Young's Wherever I Lay My Hat. His equipment at that time included a fretless 1979 Music Man StingRay Bass and Boss octave pedal (OC-2). From the 1990s onward, Palladino has leaned mainly towards a Fender Precision Bass. He used his 1963 Sunburst Fender Precision on Voodoo, using heavy gauge LaBella strings (tuned down to DGCF), a foam mute, and an Ampeg B-15 amplifier. He has also played Fender Jaguar Bass, Lakland Jazz Bass, and Larry Graham Signature JJ-4B Bass. The Fender Pino Palladino Signature Precision Bass is modeled after two of Pino's Fender Precision Basses. The body features faded fiesta red paint over desert sand paint, based on Palladino's 1961 Precision Bass, while the neck shape and round-lam rosewood fretboard are based on his 1963 sunburst Precision Bass. Personal life In 1992, Pino married Marilyn \\"Maz\\" Roberts, a member of Paul Young's vocal group, the Fabulous Wealthy Tarts. They have three children: Fabiana, Giancarla, and Rocco, who are all involved in the music industry.

However, in Switzerland it is nowadays frowned upon to carry out this tradition, for it is considered unnecessary violence. It is a traditional, strictly regulated √©p√©e/rapier fight between two male members of different fraternities with sharp weapons. The German technical term (from Latin meaning 'dimension') in the 16th century referred to the specified distance between each of the fencers.Robert Paschke: Corpsstudentisches W√∂rterbuch. In: Handbuch des K√∂sener Corpsstudenten. Verband Alter Corpsstudenten e. V. Band I. W√ºrzburg 1985 (6. Aufl.)  Technique  An 1896 picture of , a German Corpsstudent, showing an extensive fresh fencing scar and some minor old ones. Student sabre duel, 1900 Mensur fencing with Korbschl√§gern in T√ºbingen in 1831 Modern academic fencing, the Mensur, is neither a duel nor a sport. It is a traditional way of training and educating character and personality; thus, in a mensur bout, there is neither winner nor loser. In contrast to sport fencing, the participants stand their ground at a fixed distance. At the beginning of the tradition, duelers wore only their normal clothing (as duels sometimes would arise spontaneously) or light-cloth armor on arm, torso, and throat. In recent years, fencers are protected by mail or padding for the body, fencing arm, fencing hand (gauntlet) and the throat, completed by steel goggles with a nose guard. In Austria and Switzerland a nose guard is uncommon. They fence at arm's length and stand more or less in one place, while attempting to hit the unprotected areas of their opponent's face and head. Flinching or dodging is not allowed, the goal being less to avoid injury than to endure it stoically. Two physicians are present (one for each opponent) to attend to injuries and stop the fight if necessary. The participants, or Paukanten, use specially developed swords. The so-called Mensurschl√§ger (or simply Schl√§ger), exists in two versions. The most common weapon is the Korbschl√§ger with a basket-type guard. Some universities use the so-called Glockenschl√§ger, which is equipped with a bell-shaped guard. These universities are Leipzig, Berlin, Greifswald, Dresden, Tharandt (in the Forestry College, which is now part of Technische Universit√§t Dresden), Halle on the Saale, Frankfurt-an-der-Oder, and Freiberg. In Jena, both Korbschl√§ger and Glockenschl√§ger are used. Studentenverbindungen from some western cities use Glockenschl√§ger because their tradition had its origin in one of the eastern universities but moved to West Germany after World War II. The scar resulting from a hit is called a \\"smite\\" (German Schmiss), and was seen as a badge of honour, especially in the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th. Today, it is not easy for an outsider to identify Mensur scars due to better medical treatment. Also the number of mandatory Mensuren were reduced in the second half of the 20th century. Most Mensur scars are located on the left temple of the forehead. Scars on the cheek and chin are rather uncommon today and sometimes due to accidents. History Timeline of academic fencing in Germany Marburg student of about 1700 Altdorf, 1725 Corporate student of the \\"Agronomia\\" in Bonn 1928/1929 Typical smallsword of the 1740s Starting in Spain at the end of the 15th century, the dueling sword (rapier) became a regular part of the attire of noblemen throughout Europe. In the Holy Roman Empire, this became usual among students, as well. Brawling and fighting were regular occupations of students in the German-speaking areas during the early modern period. In line with developments in the aristocracy and the military, regulated duels were introduced to the academic environment, as well. The basis of this was the conviction that being a student meant being something different from the rest of the population. Students wore special clothes, developed special kinds of festivities, sang student songs, and fought duels, sometimes spontaneously (so called rencontre, French \\"meeting\\" or \\"combat\\"), sometimes according to strict regulations called comment (French \\"how\\"). The weapons used were the same as those employed in civilian dueling, being at first the rapier and later the smallsword (court sword, dress sword, French l'√©p√©e de cour, German Kost√ºmdegen, Galanteriedegen), which was seen as part of the dress and always at hand as a side arm. Student life was quite unsafe in these years, especially in the 16th and 17th centuries during the Reformation wars and the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648), when a major part of the German population was killed. Public life was brutal and students killing each other in the street was not uncommon. A major step towards civilization was the introduction of the \\"regulated\\" duel, of which the first recordings exist from the 17th century. The fight was not decided on the spot, but the time and location were appointed and negotiations were done by officials. A so-called Kartelltr√§ger did the arrangements and a \\"second\\" represented the interests of the fighter during the duel and could even give physical protection from illegal actions. A kind of referee was present to make decisions, and eventually the practice of having an attending doctor became normal so as to give medical help in case of an injury. At the end of the 18th century (after the French Revolution), wearing of weapons in everyday life fell out of fashion and was more and more forbidden, even for students. This certainly reduced the number of spontaneous duels dramatically. The regulated duel remained in use, though still forbidden. foil The foil was invented in France as a training weapon in the middle of the 18th century to practice fast and elegant thrust fencing. Fencers blunted the point by wrapping a foil around the blade or fastening a knob on the point (\\"blossom\\", French fleuret). In addition to practising, some fencers took away the protection and used the sharp foil for duels. German students took up that practice and developed the Pariser (\\"Parisian\\") thrusting small sword for the Sto√ümensur (\\"thrusting mensur\\"). After the dress sword was abolished, the Pariser became the only weapon for academic thrust fencing in Germany. Since fencing on thrust with a sharp point is quite dangerous, many students died from their lungs being pierced (Lungenfuchser), which made breathing difficult or impossible. However, the counter movement had already started in G√∂ttingen in the 1760s. Here the G√∂ttinger Hieber was invented, the predecessor of the modern Korbschl√§ger, a new weapon for cut fencing. In the following years, the Glockenschl√§ger was invented in east German universities for cut fencing as well. Thrust fencing (using Pariser) and cut fencing using Korbschl√§ger or Glockenschl√§ger) existed in parallel in Germany during the first decades of the 19th century‚Äîwith local preferences. Thrust fencing was especially popular in Jena, Erlangen, W√ºrzburg, and Ingolstadt/Landshut, two towns where the predecessors of Munich University were located. The last thrust Mensur is recorded to have taken place in W√ºrzburg in 1860. Until the first half of the 19th century, all types of academic fencing can be seen as duels, since all fencing with sharp weapons was about honour. No combat with sharp blades took place without a formal insult. Compared to pistol duels, these events were relatively harmless. The fight regularly ended when a contestant received a wound at least one inch long that produced at least one drop of blood. It was not uncommon for students to have fought approximately 10 to 30 duels of that kind during their university years. The German student Fritz Bacmeister is the 19th century record holder, due to his estimated 100 mensur bouts fought in G√∂ttingen, Jena, and W√ºrzburg between 1860 and 1866.In G√∂ttingen only, 51 mensur bouts of Bacmeister are historically recorded, in Jena and W√ºrzburg, 15 bouts per student are regarded as average - and Bacmeister is seen as above average, so the number of 100 appears realistic. See also Frank Huss: Fritz Bacmeister ‚Äì Corpsstudent und Abenteurer. In: Einst und Jetzt. Jahrbuch 2008 des Vereins f√ºr corpsstudentische Geschichtsforschung. Volume 53, Neustadt an der Aisch 2008, pages 366f. In the 20th and 21st century it was Alexander Kliesch (Landsmannschaft Brandenburg Berlin) with 70. For duels with nonstudents, e.g., military officers, the \\"academic sabre\\" became usual, apparently derived from the military sabre. It was a heavy weapon with a curved blade and a hilt similar to the Korbschl√§ger. During the first half of the 19th century and some of the 18th century, students believed the character of a person could easily be judged by watching him fight with sharp blades under strict regulations. Academic fencing was more and more seen as a kind of personality training by showing countenance and fairness even in dangerous situations. Student corporations demanded their members fight at least one duel with sharp blades during their university time. The problem was that some peaceful students had nobody to offend them. The solution was a kind of formal insult that did not actually infringe honour, but was just seen as a challenge for fencing. The standard wording was dummer Junge (German for \\"stupid boy.\\") In the long term, this solution was unsatisfying. Around 1850, the Bestimmungsmensur (German bestimmen means \\"ascertain\\", \\"define\\" or \\"determine\\") was developed and introduced throughout Germany. This meant the opponents of a Mensur were determined by the fencing official of their corporations. These officials were regularly vice-chairmen (Consenior) and responsible for arranging Mensur bouts in cooperation with their colleagues from other corporations. Their objective was to find opponents of equal physical and fencing capabilities to make the event challenging for both participants. That is the way it is still done today, and is the concept of the Mensur in the modern sense of the word. Before the Communist revolution in Russia and before World War II, academic fencing was known in most countries of Eastern Europe, as well. Modern Mensur By the end of the 19th century, the dueling form evolved into the modern Mensur. In 1884, the British Saturday Review described the dueling as follows:The Saturday Review, \\"German Students' Duels,\\" in E. Littell and R. S. Littell, eds.,Littell's Living Age, Vol. 160, pp. 512-513, Jan.-Mar. 1884. > In the German Schl√§ger combat the position is the same as in back-swording, > save that the left arm is kept, as in sabre play, behind the body; commonly > the waistband of the trousers is grasped by the left hand. The weapon is a > long, narrow blade, like a pointless rapier, but much more flexible. It is > sharpened for a length of twenty centimetres (say eight inches) on the true > edge, and five on the false edge. For practice and instruction blunt and > rather stouter blades are used. The mask is like an English single-stick > mask, but stronger and heavier. A padded leather vest, coming almost down to > the knees, covers the body, and the right arm is encased in a sleeve > attached to a gauntlet, which may be compared to an elongated Rugby > football. In the actual duel there is an even more elaborate system of > defense ; the right wrist is guarded with a ring of mail, and the arm with > folds of silk, which, like the turban of the East, are enough to stop any > ordinary cut. Practically, though not according to strict rule, the body is > altogether covered. The eyes are protected by iron spectacles, with strong > wire net instead of glasses. During the times of the Third Reich, the national socialist leadership chose to forbid academic fencing. They had recognized that Mensur fencing was an integral part to the internal strength of the last still-existing independent Studentenverbindung fraternities during the later 1930s. As Nazi pressure increased and fraternities were forced to officially suspend their activities, so-called comradeships were founded. These provided means for practicing and organizing the Mensur among former fraternities while remaining undetected to the Nazi secret police. One such example was the SC-Comradeship Hermann L√∂ns initiated by members of the Corps Hubertia Freiburg and other fraternities in Freiburg, Germany. There, fencing Mensur \\"duels\\" continued and even intensified from 1941 on, with over 100 of such duels happening during World War II in Freiburg alone.Leo Alexander Ricker: Freiburger Mensuren in der nationalsozialistischen Verbotszeit. Einst und Jetzt 10 (1968), S. 70‚Äì82 Following the war, most of the formerly suspended fraternities were reactivated and resumed the traditions of Mensur fencing, if they had not continued throughout the time of Nazi occupation. Today, the Mensur is practiced by about 400 traditional Studentenverbindung fraternities in Germany, several of the Corps, Burschenschaften, Landsmannschaften, Turnerschaften and S√§ngerschaften. Menzura, as the Mensur is known in Poland, and is still practised, although its popularity has declined since the end of World War II. In literature Preparations for a mensur; here between members of a Polish Corporation Sarmatia and a German fraternity (Freiburg im Breisgau, 2004) American traveller Mark Twain devoted several chapters of A Tramp Abroad (1880) to Heidelberg students' fencing. In Three Men on the Bummel (1900), Jerome K. Jerome devoted a chapter to German student life, and describes the \\"German Mensur\\" in detail. While much of the book has a tone of admiration for the German people, he expressed extreme disapproval for this tradition. In George MacDonald Fraser's Royal Flash (1970), the protagonist Harry Flashman is scarred with a Schl√§ger as part of his disguise as a Danish prince. Mensur is featured in Heinrich Mann's novel Man of Straw (Der Untertan). Mensur scars are repeatedly noted and described as a sign of beauty and manliness by German characters in Katherine Anne Porter's novel Ship of Fools. Mensur scars are mentioned in passing in Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers when two German recruits are asked at the beginning of boot camp where they got their scars. The drill sergeant even uses the term Korpsbruder (as spelled in modern German). E. C. Gordon, the hero of Heinlein's Glory Road, mentions his desire for a degree from Heidelberg and the dueling scars to go with it. The opening scene of \\"The Mystery of the Spanish Chest,\\" in season three of Agatha Christie's Poirot, features two men fighting in the mensur style. The episode's dialogue implies that the fencers are English, rather than German, and that one fencer has challenged the other to a duel over a woman. In the James Bond books by Ian Fleming, the supervillain Ernst Stavro Blofeld has a dueling scar below his eye. In film The Mensur is featured in a number of German films, notably: * Hans Westmar - Einer von Vielen (\\"Hans Westmar - One of Many\\"), 1933 *Der Untertan, 1951 and less commonly in films outside Germany, such as *The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, 1943 *Royal Flash, 1975 In television * \\"The Mystery of the Spanish Chest\\" in series 3 of Agatha Christie's Poirot begins with a mensur. * In episode 77 of Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected, \\"The Vorpal Blade\\", the story revolves around duelling of this kind * In Freud, dueling is shown and many characters have scars from dueling.

Normally, the sphincter of the bladder contracts before ejaculation, sealing the bladder which besides inhibiting the release of urine also prevents a reflux of seminal fluids into the male bladder during ejaculation. The semen is forced to exit via the urethra, the path of least resistance. When the bladder sphincter does not function properly, retrograde ejaculation may occur. It can also be induced deliberately by a male as a primitive form of male birth control (known as coitus saxonicus) or as part of certain alternative medicine practices. The retrograde-ejaculated semen, which goes into the bladder, is excreted with the next urination. Signs and symptoms  Retrograde ejaculation is sometimes referred to as a \\"dry orgasm.\\" Retrograde ejaculation is one symptom of male infertility.Retrograde ejaculation treatments Infertility factors portal. Retrieved on 2010-03-02 Men often notice during masturbation that they do not have semen release but there is an orgasm.Explanation on Retrograde ejaculation MedlinePlus. Retrieved on 2010-03-02 Another underlying cause for this phenomenon may be ejaculatory duct obstruction. During a male orgasm, sperm are released from the epididymis and travel via small tubes called the vas deferens. The sperm mix with seminal fluid in the seminal vesicles, prostate fluid from the prostate gland, and lubricants from the bulbourethral gland. During climax, muscles at the end of the bladder neck tighten to prevent retrograde flow of semen. In retrograde ejaculation, these bladder neck muscles are either very weak or the nerves controlling the muscles have been damaged.The condition known as retrograde ejaculation Merck, Sharpe & Dohme. Retrieved on 2010-03-02 Causes A malfunctioning bladder sphincter, leading to retrograde ejaculation, may be a result either of: *Autonomic nervous system dysfunction. (Dysautonomia) *Operation on the prostate. It is a common complication of transurethral resection of the prostate, a procedure in which prostate tissue is removed, slice by slice, through a resectoscope passed along the urethra. It can also be caused by a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for testicular cancer if nerve pathways to the bladder sphincter are damaged, with the resulting retrograde ejaculation being either temporary or permanent. Modern nerve-sparing techniques seek to reduce this risk; however, it may also occur as the result of Green Light Laser prostate surgery. Surgery on the bladder neck accounted for about ten percent of the cases of retrograde ejaculation or anejaculation reported in a literature review.[Hum Reprod Update. 1999 Sep-Oct;5(5):448-74. Treatment of retrograde ejaculation and anejaculation. Kamischke A, Nieschlag E.] Retrograde ejaculation is a common side effect of medications, such as tamsulosin, that are used to relax the muscles of the urinary tract, treating conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia. By relaxing the bladder sphincter muscle, the likelihood of retrograde ejaculation is increased. The medications that mostly cause it are antidepressant and antipsychotic medication, as well as NRIs such as atomoxetine; patients experiencing this phenomenon tend to quit the medications. Retrograde ejaculation can also be a complication of diabetes, especially in cases of diabetics with long term poor blood sugar control. This is due to neuropathy of the bladder sphincter. Post-pubertal males (aged 17 to 20 years) who experience repeated episodes of retrograde ejaculation are often diagnosed with urethral stricture disease shortly after the initial complaint arises. It is currently not known whether a congenital malformation of the bulbous urethra is responsible, or if pressure applied to the base of the penis or perineum immediately preceding ejaculatory inevitability may have inadvertently damaged the urethra. This damage is most often seen within 0.5 cm of the ejaculatory duct (usually distal to the duct). Retrograde ejaculation can also result from pinching closed the urethral opening, to avoid creating a mess upon ejaculation (known as Hughes' technique). =Conditions which can affect bladder neck muscle= Medications to treat high blood pressure, benign prostate hyperplasia, mood disorders, surgery on the prostate and nerve injury (which may occur in multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or diabetes).Retrograde Ejaculation Causes, Symptoms and Treatment Retrieved on 2010-03-02 Diagnosis Diagnosis is usually by way of a urinalysis performed on a urine specimen that is obtained shortly after ejaculation. In cases of retrograde ejaculation, the specimen will contain an abnormal level of sperm. Especially in case of orgasmic anejaculation, anejaculation can often be confused with retrograde ejaculation, and they share some fundamental aspects of the cause. Urinalysis is used to distinguish between them. =Tests= A physical exam of the genitals is applied to ensure that there are no anatomical problems. The urine will be examined for the presence of semen. If there are no sperm in the urine, it may be due to damage to the prostate as a result of surgery or prior radiation therapy.What is Retrograde Ejaculation? Mama's Health portal. Retrieved on 2010-03-02  Treatments  The treatment depends on the cause. Medications may work for retrograde ejaculation but only in a few cases. Surgery rarely is the first option for retrograde ejaculation and the results have proven to be inconsistent.Retrograde ejaculation overview Mayo Clinic. Retrieved on 2010-03-02 Medications do not help retrograde ejaculation if there has been permanent damage to the prostate or the testes from radiation. Medications also do not help if prostate surgery has resulted in damage to the muscles or nerves. Medications only work if there has been mild nerve damage caused by diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or mild spinal cord injury. =Medications = * Tricyclic antidepressants like imipramine. * Antihistamines like chlorphenamine. * Decongestants like ephedrine and phenylephrine. These medications tighten the bladder neck muscles and prevent semen from going backwards into the bladder. However, the medications do have many side effects and they have to be taken at least 1‚Äì2 hours prior to sexual intercourse. In many cases, the medications fail to work at the right time because most men are not able to predict when they will have an orgasm. = Infertility treatments = If a couple is experiencing infertility as a result of retrograde ejaculation and medications are not helping, the collection of the semen collection may undergo a special procedure. First, the patient alkalinizes his urine by intake of sodium bicarbonate (3g dissolved in water in the evening before bed, and then another dose after complete bladder emptying right before going to the laboratory). Before semen collection the patient must empty his bladder. The patient then has to masturbate in one container and immediately after has to urinate in another container. The male's ejaculate may be centrifuged from urine voided, and the isolated sperm injected directly into the woman through the use of intrauterine insemination. In more severe cases, in-vitro fertilization with intracytoplasmic sperm injection may be used. Intentional induction Retrograde ejaculation can be deliberately induced by squeezing the urethra at the base or applying pressure to the perineum during orgasm. The retrograde-ejaculated sperm goes into the bladder and is excreted with the next urination. =Contraception= In certain cultures, such as in the Oneida Community, retrograde ejaculation is performed as a form of primitive male birth control (coitus saxonicus). However, the practice is not considered a reliable method compared to most modern types of birth control. Besides the lack of protection from STDs, the technique itself can be hard to execute correctly during the act of coitus, especially if the male does not fully understand the anatomy involved. Many doctors also do not recommend coitus saxonicus due to the risk of putting pressure on the pudendal nerve, which can cause numbness in the penis. =Taoism= Taoists and some fields of alternative medicine recommend and teach deliberate retrograde ejaculation as a way of \\"conserving the body's energy\\". It was believed that retrograde ejaculation caused the sperm to travel into the head and nourish the brain, or that energy is conserved physically by keeping the sperm (and thereby, the \\"intelligence\\" that created it) in the body. However, there are other Taoist perspectives on the general subject of ejaculation and techniques that do not involve retrograde ejaculation (see Taoist sexual practices).

He is best known for his Bott periodicity theorem, the Morse‚ÄìBott functions which he used in this context, and the Borel‚ÄìBott‚ÄìWeil theorem. Early life Bott was born in Budapest, Hungary, the son of Margit Kov√°cs and Rudolph Bott. His father was of Austrian descent, and his mother was of Hungarian Jewish descent; Bott was raised a Catholic by his mother and stepfather.http://www.ams.org/notices/200605/fea-bott-2.pdf Bott grew up in Czechoslovakia and spent his working life in the United States. His family emigrated to Canada in 1938, and subsequently he served in the Canadian Army in Europe during World War II. Career Bott later went to college at McGill University in Montreal, where he studied electrical engineering. He then earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh in 1949. His thesis, titled Electrical Network Theory, was written under the direction of Richard Duffin. Afterward, he began teaching at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Bott continued his study at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was a professor at Harvard University from 1959 to 1999. In 2005 Bott died of cancer in San Diego. With Richard Duffin at Carnegie Mellon, Bott studied existence of electronic filters corresponding to given positive-real functions. In 1949 they provedJohn H. Hubbard (2010) \\"The Bott-Duffin Synthesis of Electrical Circuits\\", pp 33 to 40 in A Celebration of the Mathematical Legacy of Raoul Bott, P. Robert Kotiuga editor, CRM Proceedings and Lecture Notes #50, American Mathematical Society a fundamental theorem of filter synthesis. Duffin and Bott extended earlier work by Otto Brune that requisite functions of complex frequency s could be realized by a passive network of inductors and capacitors. The proof, relying on induction on the sum of the degrees of the polynomials in the numerator and denominator of the rational function, was published in Journal of Applied Physics, volume 20, page 816. In his 2000 interviewJackson, Allyn, \\"Interview with Raoul Bott\\", Notices of the American Mathematical Society 48 (2001), no. 4, 374‚Äì382. with Allyn Jackson of the American Mathematical Society, he explained that he sees \\"networks as discrete versions of harmonic theory\\", so his experience with network synthesis and electronic filter topology introduced him to algebraic topology. Bott met Arnold S. Shapiro at the IAS and they worked together. He studied the homotopy theory of Lie groups, using methods from Morse theory, leading to the Bott periodicity theorem (1957). In the course of this work, he introduced Morse‚ÄìBott functions, an important generalization of Morse functions. This led to his role as collaborator over many years with Michael Atiyah, initially via the part played by periodicity in K-theory. Bott made important contributions towards the index theorem, especially in formulating related fixed-point theorems, in particular the so-called 'Woods Hole fixed-point theorem', a combination of the Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem and Lefschetz fixed-point theorem (it is named after Woods Hole, Massachusetts, the site of a conference at which collective discussion formulated it). The major Atiyah‚ÄìBott papers on what is now the Atiyah‚ÄìBott fixed-point theorem were written in the years up to 1968; they collaborated further in recovering in contemporary language Ivan Petrovsky on Petrovsky lacunas of hyperbolic partial differential equations, prompted by Lars G√•rding. In the 1980s, Atiyah and Bott investigated gauge theory, using the Yang‚ÄìMills equations on a Riemann surface to obtain topological information about the moduli spaces of stable bundles on Riemann surfaces. In 1983 he spoke to the Canadian Mathematical Society in a talk he called \\"A topologist marvels at Physics\\". He is also well known in connection with the Borel‚ÄìBott‚ÄìWeil theorem on representation theory of Lie groups via holomorphic sheaves and their cohomology groups; and for work on foliations. With Chern he worked on Nevanlinna theory, studied holomorphic vector bundles over complex analytic manifolds and introduced the Bott-Chern classes, useful in the theory of Arakelov geometry and also to algebraic number theory. He introduced Bott‚ÄìSamelson varieties and the Bott residue formula for complex manifolds and the Bott cannibalistic class. Awards In 1964, he was awarded the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry by the American Mathematical Society. In 1983, he was awarded the Jeffery‚ÄìWilliams Prize by the Canadian Mathematical Society. In 1987, he was awarded the National Medal of Science. In 2000, he received the Wolf Prize. In 2005, he was elected an Overseas Fellow of the Royal Society of London. Students Bott had 35 Ph.D. students, including Stephen Smale, Lawrence Conlon, Daniel Quillen, Peter Landweber, Robert MacPherson, Robert W. Brooks, Robin Forman, Rama Kocherlakota, Andr√°s Szenes, Kevin Corlette, and Eric Weinstein. Smale and Quillen won Fields Medals in 1966 and 1978 respectively. Publications * 1995: Collected Papers.

Biography Born in Vienna, Jurmann received a classical education, taking his Matura exams in 1921. For some time he studied medicine but in 1924, after working as a lounge pianist in a posh hotel in the Semmering area of Lower Austria, abandoned his studies altogether in order to pursue a career in music. He moved to Berlin and soon became successful with tunes such as \\"Du bist nicht die Erste\\". Probably his most famous 1920s song is \\"Veronika, der Lenz ist da\\", popularized by the all-male a cappella ensemble, the Comedian Harmonists. With the arrival of sound movies Jurmann also began writing film music, starting with Ihre Majest√§t, die Liebe (Her Majesty, Love) (1930). Jurman's melodies were so charming and easy to remember that a contemporary paper reported that cinemagoers were humming the new tunes already on the morning following the release of a new film. In 1933, after the Nazis had come to power, Jurmann left Berlin for Paris, France, where he continued writing songs, occasionally incorporating elements of the French chanson. In 1934 he met Louis B. Mayer, who offered him a seven-year contract with MGM. Subsequently, Jurmann and his partner, Polish-born composer Bronis≈Çaw Kaper (1902 - 1983), went to Hollywood. Jurmann's successful films include Mutiny on the Bounty (1935) (\\"Love Song of Tahiti\\"), the 1936 movie San Francisco (\\"Theme from San Francisco\\"), the 1937 Marx Brothers' A Day at the Races (\\"All God's Chillun Got Rhythm\\"), and Presenting Lily Mars (1943) starring Judy Garland. In the early 1940s Jurmann, who had settled down in Los Angeles, withdrew from the film business although he continued writing Ohrw√ºrmer up to his death. In 1953 he married Yvonne Jellinek, a Hungarian fashion designer whom he had met at a party in the U.S. In 1971, during a trip to Europe, he died unexpectedly of a heart attack in Budapest, his wife's home town.

Work in Paris In 1930 Bartosch moved to Paris and created the 30 minute film entitled 'L'Id√©e' (The Idea) to which he is most remembered for. The film is described as the first serious, poetic, tragic work in animation. The film's characters and backdrops were composed of several layers of different types of paper from semi-transparent to thick cardboard. Special effects like halos, smoke and fog were made with lather spread on glass plates and lit from behind. Bartosch based the film on a wordless novel of woodcuts by Frans Masereel, The Idea (1920). L'idee, when released in 1933, featured a score by composer Arthur Honegger, including an ondes Martenot, which is believed to be the very first use of an electronic musical instrument in film history. The following year, Franz Waxman's score for Liliom (1934) used a theremin. From 1933 to 1938, Bartosch worked on an anti-war film, St. Francis or Nightmare and Dreams, a 25-minute piece being financed by Thorold Dickinson. When the Nazis invaded Paris, he deposited the film at the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise. The film was destroyed during the Nazi occupation, and only a few still images exist. In 1948, he spent a year working for UNESCO in Paris mentoring George Dunning, a Canadian-born animator known for his involvement with the Beatles's animated feature, Yellow Submarine (1968).

The drama triangle model is a tool used in psychotherapy, specifically transactional analysis. The triangle of actors in the drama are oppressors, victims and rescuers. Use Through popular usage and the work of Karpman and others, Karpman's triangle has been adapted for use in structural analysis and transactional analysis. Theory Karpman used triangles to map conflicted or drama-intense relationship transactions. The Karpman Drama Triangle models the connection between personal responsibility and power in conflicts, and the destructive and shifting roles people play. He defined three roles in the conflict; Persecutor, Rescuer (the one up positions) and Victim (one down position). Karpman placed these three roles on an inverted triangle and referred to them as being the three aspects, or faces of drama. # The Victim: The Victim's stance is \\"Poor me!\\" The Victim feels victimized, oppressed, helpless, hopeless, powerless, ashamed, and seems unable to make decisions, solve problems, take pleasure in life, or achieve insight. The Victim, if not being persecuted, will seek out a Persecutor and also a Rescuer who will save the day but also perpetuate the Victim's negative feelings. # The Rescuer: The rescuer's line is \\"Let me help you.\\" A classic enabler, the Rescuer feels guilty if they don't go to the rescue. Yet their rescuing has negative effects: It keeps the Victim dependent and gives the Victim permission to fail. The rewards derived from this rescue role are that the focus is taken off of the rescuer. When they focus their energy on someone else, it enables them to ignore their own anxiety and issues. This rescue role is also pivotal because their actual primary interest is really an avoidance of their own problems disguised as concern for the victim‚Äôs needs. # The Persecutor: (a.k.a. Villain) The Persecutor insists, \\"It's all your fault.\\" The Persecutor is controlling, blaming, critical, oppressive, angry, authoritarian, rigid, and superior. Initially, a drama triangle arises when a person takes on the role of a victim or persecutor. This person then feels the need to enlist other players into the conflict. As often happens, a rescuer is encouraged to enter the situation. These enlisted players take on roles of their own that are not static, and therefore various scenarios can occur. The victim might turn on the rescuer, for example, while the rescuer then switches to persecution. The reason that the situation persist is that each participant has their (frequently unconscious) psychological wishes/needs met without having to acknowledge the broader dysfunction or harm done in the situation as a whole. Each participant is acting upon their own selfish needs, rather than acting in a genuinely responsible or altruistic manner. Any character might \\"ordinarily come on like a plaintive victim; it is now clear that the one can switch into the role of Persecutor providing it is 'accidental' and the one apologizes for it\\". The motivations of the rescuer are the least obvious. In the terms of the triangle, the rescuer has a mixed or covert motive and benefits egoically in some way from being \\"the one who rescues\\". The rescuer has a surface motive of resolving the problem and appears to make great efforts to solve it, but also has a hidden motive to not succeed, or to succeed in a way in which they benefit. They may get a self-esteem boost, for example, or receive respected rescue status, or derive enjoyment by having someone depend on them and trust them and act in a way that ostensibly seems to be trying to help, but at a deeper level plays upon the victim in order to continue getting a payoff.. The relationship between the victim and the rescuer may be one of codependency. The rescuer keeps the victim dependent by encouraging their victimhood. The victim gets their needs met by having the rescuer take care of them. Participants generally tend to have a primary or habitual role (victim, rescuer, persecutor) when they enter into drama triangles. Participants first learn their habitual role in their family of origin. Even though participants each have a role with which they most identify, once on the triangle, participants rotate through all the three positions. Each triangle has a \\"payoff\\" for those playing it. The \\"antithesis\\" of a drama triangle lies in discovering how to deprive the actors of their payoff. Historical context =Family therapy movement= After World War II, therapists observed that while many battle-torn veteran patients readjusted well after returning to their families, some patients did not; some even regressed when they returned to their home environment. Researchers felt that they needed an explanation for this and began to explore the dynamics of family life ‚Äì and thus began the family therapy movement. Prior to this time, psychiatrists and psychoanalysts focused on the patient‚Äôs already-developed psyche and downplayed outside detractors. Intrinsic factors were addressed and extrinsic reactions were considered as emanating from forces within the person. =Transactions analysis= In the 1950s, Eric Berne developed transactional analysis, a method for studying interactions between individuals. This approach was profoundly different than that of Freud. While Freud relied on asking patients about themselves, Berne felt that a therapist could learn by observing what was communicated (words, body language, facial expressions) in a transaction. So instead of directly asking the patient questions, Berne would frequently observe the patient in a group setting, noting all of the transactions that occurred between the patient and other individuals. =Triangles/triangulation= The theory of triangulation was originally published in 1966 by Murray Bowen as one of eight parts of Bowen's family systems theory. Murray Bowen, a pioneer in family systems theory, began his early work with schizophrenics at the Menninger Clinic, from 1946 to 1954. Triangulation is the ‚Äúprocess whereby a two-party relationship that is experiencing tension will naturally involve third parties to reduce tension‚Äù. Simply put, when people find themselves in conflict with another person, they will reach out to a third person. The resulting triangle is more comfortable as it can hold much more tension because the tension is being shifted around three people instead of two. Bowen studied the dyad of the mother and her schizophrenic child while he had them both living in a research unit at the Menninger clinic. Bowen then moved to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), where he resided from 1954 to 1959. At the NIMH Bowen extended his hypothesis to include the father-mother-child triad. Bowen considered differentiation and triangles the crux of his theory, Bowen Family Systems Theory. Bowen intentionally used the word triangle rather than triad. In Bowen Family Systems Theory, the triangle is an essential part of the relationship. Couples left to their own resources oscillate between closeness and distance. Two people having this imbalance often have difficulty resolving it by themselves. To stabilize the relationship, the couple often seek the aid of a third party to help re-establish closeness. A triangle is the smallest possible relationship system that can restore balance in a time of stress. The third person assumes an outside position. In periods of stress, the outside position is the most comfortable and desired position. The inside position is plagued by anxiety, along with its emotional closeness. The outsider serves to preserve the inside couple‚Äôs relationship. Bowen noted that not all triangles are constructive ‚Äì some are destructive. =Pathological/perverse triangles= In 1968, Nathan Ackerman conceptualized a destructive triangle. Ackerman stated ‚Äúwe observe certain constellations of family interactions which we have epitomized as the pattern of family interdependence, roles those of destroyer or persecutor, the victim of the scapegoating attack, and the family healer or the family doctor. Ackerman also recognize the pattern of attack, defense, and counterattack, as shifting roles. =Karpman triangle and Eric Berne= In 1968, Stephen Karpman, who had an interest in acting and was a member of the Screen Actors Guild, chose \\"drama triangle\\" rather than \\"conflict triangle\\" as, here, the Victim in his model is not intended to represent an actual victim, but rather someone feeling or acting like one. He first published his theory in an article entitled \\"Fairy Tales and Script Drama Analysis\\". His article, in part, examined the fairy tale \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" to illustrate its points. Karpman was, at the time, a recent graduate of Duke University School of Medicine and was doing post post-graduate studies under Berne. Berne, who founded the field transactional analysis, encouraged Karpman to publish what Berne referred to as \\"Karpman's triangle\\". Karpman's article was published in 1968. In 1972, Karpman received the Eric Berne Memorial Scientific Award for the work. Transactional analysis Eric Berne, a Canadian-born psychiatrist, created the theory of transactional analysis, in the middle of the 20th century, as a way of explaining human behavior. Berne's theory of transactional analysis was based on the ideas of Freud but was distinctly different. Freudian psychotherapists focused on talk therapy as a way of gaining insight to their patients' personalities. Berne believed that insight could be better discovered by analyzing patients‚Äô social transactions. Games in transactional analysis refers to a series of transactions that is complementary (reciprocal), ulterior, and proceeds towards a predictable outcome. In this context, the Karpman Drama Triangle is a \\"game\\". Games are often characterized by a switch in roles of players towards the end. The number of players may vary. Games in this sense are devices used (often unconsciously) by people to create a circumstance where they can justifiably feel certain resulting feelings (such as anger or superiority) or justifiably take or avoid taking certain actions where their own inner wishes differ from societal expectations. They are always a substitute for a more genuine and full adult emotion and response which would be more appropriate. Three quantitative variables are often useful to consider for games: : Flexibility: \\"The ability of the players to change the currency of the game (that is, the tools they use to play it). 'Some games...can be played properly with only one kind of currency, while others, such as exhibitionistic games, are more flexible\\", so that players may shift from words, to money, to parts of the body. : Tenacity: \\"Some people give up their games easily, others are more persistent\\", referring to the way people stick to their games and their resistance to breaking with them. : Intensity: \\"Some people play their games in a relaxed way, others are more tense and aggressive. Games so played are known as easy and hard games, respectively\\", the latter being played in a tense and aggressive way. The consequences of games may vary from small paybacks to paybacks built up over a long period to a major level. Based on the degree of acceptability and potential harm, games are classified into three categories, representing first degree games, second degree games, and third degree games: * socially acceptable, * undesirable but not irreversibly damaging * may result in drastic harm. The Karpman triangle was an adaptation of a model that was originally conceived to analyze the play-action pass and the draw play in American football and later adapted as a way to analyze movie scripts. Karpman is reported to have doodled thirty or more diagram types before settling on the triangle. Karpman credits the movie Valley of the Dolls as being a testbed for refining the model into what Berne coined as the Karpman Drama Triangle. Karpman now has many variables of the Karpman triangle in his fully developed theory, besides role switches. These include space switches (private-public, open-closed, near-far) which precede, cause, or follow role switches, and script velocity (number of role switches in a given unit of time). These include the Question Mark triangle, False Perception triangle, Double Bind triangle, The Indecision triangle, the Vicious Cycle triangle, Trapping triangle, Escape triangle, Triangles of Oppression, and Triangles of Liberation, Switching in the triangle, and the Alcoholic Family triangle. While transactional analysis is the method for studying interactions between individuals, one researcher postulates that drama-based leaders can instill an organizational culture of drama. Persecutors are more likely to be in leadership positions and a persecutor culture goes hand in hand with cutthroat competition, fear, blaming, manipulation, high turnover and an increased risk of lawsuits. There are also victim cultures which can lead to low morale and low engagement as well as an avoidance of conflict, and rescuer cultures which can be characterized as having a high dependence on the leader, low initiative and low innovation. Therapeutic models The Winner's Triangle was published by Acey Choy in 1990 as a therapeutic model for showing patients how to alter social transactions when entering a triangle at any of the three entry points. Choy recommends that anyone feeling like a victim think more in terms of being vulnerable and caring, that anyone cast as a persecutor adopt an assertive posture, and anyone recruited to be a rescuer should react by being \\"caring\\". * Vulnerable ‚Äì a victim should be encouraged to accept their vulnerability, problem solve, and be more self-aware. * Assertive ‚Äì a persecutor should be encouraged to ask for what they want, be assertive, but not be punishing. * Caring ‚Äì a rescuer should be encouraged to show concern and be caring, but not over-reach and problem solve for others. The Power of TED, first published in 2009, recommends that the \\"victim\\" adopt the alternative role of creator, view the persecutor as a challenger, and enlist a coach instead of a rescuer. * Creator ‚Äì victims are encouraged to be outcome-oriented as opposed to problem-oriented and take responsibility for choosing their response to life challenges. They should focus on resolving \\"dynamic tension\\" (the difference between current reality and the envisioned goal or outcome) by taking incremental steps toward the outcomes he or she is trying to achieve. * Challenger ‚Äì a victim is encouraged to see a persecutor as a person (or situation) that forces the creator to clarify his or her needs, and focus on their learning and growth. * Coach ‚Äì a rescuer should be encouraged to ask questions that are intended to help the individual to make informed choices. The key difference between a rescuer and a coach is that the coach sees the creator as capable of making choices and of solving his or her own problems. A coach asks questions that enable the creator to see the possibilities for positive action, and to focus on what he or she does want instead of what he or she does not want.

He was staying with two men (with his parents‚Äô permission) who bound, drugged, tortured, and repeatedly raped him. He died from drugging and positional asphyxia during the ordeal.Lieb\\"Lawyer to request...\\", The Washington Times, Nov. 20, 1999 Despite his being at their home with approval from his parents, the defense argued he was complicit in the sexual acts, and therefore the death was accidental. Considering how he was a minor and the men were adults, this was considered unlikely. Further details revealed in the court case depicted a gruesome death. Dirkhising's death received only regional media coverage until a Washington Times article ran a story nearly a month after his death, noting the lack of national coverage in contrast to that given to the 1998 death of Matthew Shepard.Kuypers The Shepard murder was approaching its first anniversary and was getting another round of national attention, coupled with updates on pending hate crime legislation. Prompted by coverage in The Washington Times, the Dirkhising case gained notoriety as conservative commentators compared media coverage of the two cases and explored the issues of what was considered a hate crime. The added attention resulted in mainstream media also reporting the Dirkhising case in relation to the coverage of the Shepard case, with many attempting to explain why the two were handled differently by the media, and perhaps received differently by readers.Bozell, \\"No Media Spotlight ...\\" The media coverage of the Dirkhising case was repeatedly and consistently contrasted with that of the high-profile Shepard case, although the cases were dissimilar in several important details. While both victims died as the result of assaults by two men, Dirkhising was a minor and the victim of a sex crime, while the adult Shepard was ostensibly murdered as part of a hate crime.Buchanan While both heterosexuality and homosexuality have been cited as issues in both cases, the circumstances were different and in contrast: Shepard was an openly gay man who was attacked by two heterosexual men, while Dirkhising was raped by two men who were described as lovers in a police affidavit.\\"Killer:Shephard ...\\"  Background  Dirkhising was the son of Tina and Miles Yates Jr. from the small town of Prairie Grove, Arkansas. At the time of his death he was 13 and in seventh grade.\\"Contrasts in Media Coverage\\", The Washington Times. Davis Carpenter, who was charged with his murder, was then 38, and lived about away in Rogers, a \\"small but booming northwest Arkansas town.\\" \\"Arkansas town still reeling\\", The Washington TimesDriving directions 22-year-old Joshua Macave Brown shared Carpenter's apartment. Carpenter, who managed a beauty salon, was a friend of Dirkhising's parents. Dirkhising had stayed with the two men at their apartment on weekends for two months prior to his death.Price Brown had been sexually molesting Dirkhising for two months before his death; he claimed that the boy was a willing participant. Jesse's family had been told that he was helping out at the salon.  Death and investigation  On September 26, 1999, Dirkhising's murder was brought to the attention of police at Rogers, Arkansas, when they responded to a 911 call. They went to the home of Davis Carpenter, where Joshua Brown was also present.McMath Police found that Dirkhising had been tied to a mattress and that his ankles, knees, and wrists had been bound with duct tape and belts. Dirkhising had been gagged with his own underwear, a bandana and duct tape. Brown told police they had given Dirkhising an enema of urine dosed with amitriptyline, an antidepressant and a sedative.\\"Did Media Hide Gay Murder Case?\\", ABC News, Apr. 10, 2001 Police determined that Dirkhising had been repeatedly raped over a period of several hours.\\"Media Tune Out ...\\" It was later revealed that over a two-day period Dirkhising had been repeatedly raped and sodomized with various objects. After the men took a break to eat, Brown noticed Dirkhising was not breathing and alerted Carpenter, who attempted to resuscitate the boy, then called 911. Dirkhising later died in the hospital, his death hastened apparently as the result of positional asphyxia. Police found in Carpenter's home material of a pedophile nature, including instructions on how to sedate a child, and a diagram of how to tie up and position the boy, as well as other notes of fantasies of molesting children. It was speculated that one of the men planned the assault and the other carried it out. The Arkansas State Police recorded in their affidavit a statement by Brown that he had been molesting Dirkhising for at least two months prior to Dirkhising's death. Brown called the molestation 'horseplay' and claimed that Dirkhising was a willing participant.Skoloff, March 22, 2001.Barak According to age of consent laws in Arkansas, Dirkhising was incapable of giving informed consent for sexual activity.Arkansas Code - Title 5. Criminal Offenses - Chapter 14. Sexual Offenses. Sections 5-14- 103 , 124 , 125 , 126 , 127 Brown also later claimed he himself was \\"under the influence of methamphetamine\\" when talking with his arresting officers.Skoloff, March 13, 2001.  Media coverage  Dirkhising's case initially was reported regionally by \\"news organizations in Arkansas and also covered by newspapers in Oklahoma and Tennessee,\\" yet almost no national press. The Associated Press ran the story on its local wires but not nationally until a month later when the story was focused on the lack of coverage rather than the crime itself. A LexisNexis search revealed only a few dozen articles that appeared only after The Washington Times story on the lack of coverage on October 22, 1999, a month after Dirkhising's death. = Accusations of liberal media bias = On October 22, 1999, approximately one month after his death, The Washington Times ran a story with the headline \\"Media tune out torture death of Arkansas boy.\\" The story contrasted the lack of coverage of the Dirkhising case with the treatment the murder of Matthew Shepard received. The story quoted Tim Graham, director of media studies at Media Research Center, a Conservative media watchdog group that frequently criticizes liberal bias, as saying, \\"Nobody wants to say anything negative about homosexuals. Nobody wants to be seen on the wrong side of that issue.\\" Brent Bozell, media critic and director of the Media Research Center, accused the media of deliberately spiking the story.Bozell, \\"Human Events\\" pp. 16-17 Bozell wrote, \\"Had he been openly gay and his attackers heterosexual, the crime would have led all the networks. But no liberal media outlet has as its villains two gay men.\\" After The Washington Times article, the lack of coverage of Dirkhising's case was noted by conservative commentators and was attributed to the homosexuality of the perpetrators as well as the nature of the crimes. Conservative political commentator Pat Buchanan noted that showing gay men as sadistic barbarians does not fit the \\"villain-victim script of our cultural elite.\\" The Dirkhising case was repeatedly compared with the media coverage of the murder of Matthew Shepard although Dirkhising was a minor in a sex crime and Shepard's murder was a hate crime involving adults. Also the sexualities of the victims and attackers differed somewhat with Shepard being an openly gay man attacked by two heterosexual men, while Dirkhising's attackers were lovers and presumed to be gay.\\"A Special Kind ...\\" Jonathan Gregg wrote in Time, \\"Matthew Shepard died not because of an all-too-common sex crime, but because of prejudice. Essentially, Shepard was lynched; taken from a bar, beaten and left to die because he was the vilified \\"other\\" whom society has often cast as an acceptable target of abuse; Dirkhising was just \\"another\\" to a pair of deviants. And while child abuse is unfortunately no big news, lynching still is.\\" In the month after Shepard's murder, LexisNexis recorded 3,007 stories about his death compared with only 46 in the month after the Dirkhising murder.Sullivan, page E1 However, once the media seized on the story, this count rapidly rose into the thousands.Sullivan, p8, 1p Many of the articles justified the lack of coverage, citing that the death did not justify national attention; initial reports failed to mention that the two perpetrators were gay, whereas the Shepard reports identified Shepard as gay and the crimes as hate crimes from the beginning. In a November 4, 1999, Time magazine article, Jonathan Gregg opined that accusations of liberal media bias were not justified because the two cases varied with the Dirkhising murder offering \\"no lessons,\\" whereas the Shepard murder \\"touches on a host of complex and timely issues: intolerance, society's attitudes toward gays and the pressure to conform, the use of violence as a means of confronting one's demons.\\"Gregg = Accusations of homophobia = Commentator Andrew Sullivan wrote an article in The New Republic accusing the liberal media of political correctness and using Dirkhising's death to attack the Human Rights Campaign for its support of hate-crime legislation.Limbaugh 2003 The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), however, complained that The Washington Times \\"omitted a key piece of information\\" for its front-page story on Dirkhising: The HRC had provided a statement strongly condemning the crime and called for the perpetrators to be punished \\"to the fullest extent of the law.\\"Smith Sullivan also criticized some aspects of the conservative coverage of the Dirkhising case equating gay sex with child molestation as \\"ugly nonsense\\". Sullivan squarely summed up the differences in media coverage as being due to political interests. Sullivan stated that whereas the Shepherd case was used to support including LGBT people in federal hate-crime law the Dirkhising case was ignored for concerns of inciting anti-gay prejudice. In November 1999, E. R. Shipp, ombudsman at The Washington Post, noted that \\"readers, prodded by commentators who are hostile to LGBT people and to what they view as a 'liberal' press\\" had raised questions about the Dirkhising case. Shipp said, however, that she \\"made a clear distinction\\" between the Dirkhising and Shepard cases: \\"Matthew Shepard's death sparked public expressions of outrage that themselves became news. . . . That Jesse Dirkhising's death has not done so is hardly the fault of The Washington Post.\\" Shipp also noted that the Shepherd story was newsworthy because of the debate it fostered on hate crimes and the level of intolerance towards LGBT people in the United States. The story of the September 26 death was transmitted by Associated Press national news wires on October 29, and The Post ran a news brief the following day. Jonathan Gregg, in a November 9 Time magazine editorial, asserted that \\"[the killing of Dirkhising] was the kind of depraved act that happens with even more regularity against young females and, indeed if the victim had been a 13-year-old girl, the story would probably never have gotten beyond Benton County, much less Arkansas. The same editorial also said: \\"A red herring worth addressing at the outset is the failure to distinguish between homosexuality and pedophilia, which creates a false parallel at the core of The Washington Times argument. But sex with children is a crime regardless of the sexes involved, and is not synonymous with homosexuality. . . . \\"The reason the Dirkhising story received so little play is [that] it offered no lessons. Shepard's murder touches on a host of complex and timely issues: intolerance, society's attitudes toward gays and the pressure to conform, the use of violence as a means of confronting one's demons. \\"Jesse Dirkhising's death gives us nothing except the depravity of two sick men.\\"\\"Why One Murder ...\\"  Trials and convictions  Davis Don Carpenter and Joshua Brown were each charged with capital murder and six counts of rape, and they faced the death penalty in Arkansas for the crimes. Neither man had any known prior convictions. The two men were tried separately, as it was believed \\"each of them will blame the other for the murder.\\"Bates The Arkansas state prosecutor \\"maintained that the older man had mapped out the assault and watched a portion of it\\" so chose to send Brown (the younger lover) to trial first. Carpenter's court-appointed attorney, criminal defense lawyer Tim Buckley, sought a change of venue from Benton County citing excessive pretrial publicity. \\"It's been on everyone's lips down here for a month and a half,\\" Buckley stated. The Washington Post was \\"almost alone among national newspapers\\" reporting on Brown's trial and Fox News was the only network to cover the murder trial and conviction. The prosecutors \\"argued that Jesse suffocated to death during the sexual assault because of a combination of the drugs and the way he was trussed up.\\" In March 2001, Brown was found guilty of first-degree murder and rape. He was sentenced to life in prison, and this sentence was upheld on appeal by the Arkansas Supreme Court in September 2003. In April 2001, Carpenter pleaded guilty to similar charges and was also sentenced to life. Subsequently, Carpenter said on the Fox News Channel that Brown was solely responsible for the rape and murder of Dirkhising while Brown said that Carpenter was the director.Edge with Paula Zahn Carpenter, Arkansas Department of Corrections (ADC)#120443 is in the Tucker Maximum Security Unit.

The Dragunov was designed as a squad support weapon since, according to Soviet and Soviet-derived military doctrines, the long-range engagement ability was lost to ordinary troops when submachine guns and assault rifles (which are optimized for close-range and medium-range, rapid- fire combat) were adopted. It was developed in 1957‚Äì1963 and selected as the winner of a contest that included three competing groups of designers: led by Sergei Simonov, Aleksandr Konstantinov and Yevgeny Dragunov. Extensive field testing of the rifles conducted in a wide range of environmental conditions resulted in Dragunov's proposal being accepted into service on 3 July 1963. An initial pre-production batch consisting of 200 rifles was assembled for evaluation purposes, and from 1964 serial production was carried out by Izhmash, later called Kalashnikov Concern. Since then, the Dragunov has become the standard squad support weapon of several countries, including those of the former Warsaw Pact. China produced an unlicensed copy of the SVD through reverse-engineered samples captured during the Sino-Vietnamese War as the Type 79 and 85. Iran also produced a clone, the Nakhjir 3, which was a direct copy of the Chinese Type 79. Design details =Operating mechanism= The Dragunov is a semi-automatic, gas-operated rifle with a short-stroke gas- piston system. The barrel breech is locked through a rotating bolt (left rotation) and uses three locking lugs to engage corresponding locking recesses in the barrel extension. The rifle has a manual, two-position gas regulator. A gas regulator meters the portion of the combustion gases fed into the action in order to cycle the weapon and sets the recoil velocity of the gas-piston system. The gas regulator can be set with the help of the rim of a cartridge. The normal position #1 leaves a gas escape port opened in the form of a hole that lets some combustion gas escape during cycling. Position #2 closes the gas escape port and directs extra combustion gas to the piston increasing the recoil velocity of the gas-piston system and felt recoil. It is used for when the rifle does not reliably cycle due to carbon fouling build-up in the gas port, when shooting in extreme cold or high altitude or using low-powered ammunition. After discharging the last cartridge from the magazine, the bolt carrier and bolt are held back on a bolt catch that is released by pulling the cocking handle to the rear. The rifle has a hammer-type striking mechanism and a manual lever safety selector. The firing pin is a \\"free-floating\\" type and, as a result, some soft-primered ammunition had the reputation of causing a \\"slam fire\\" event. Thus, military-grade ammunition with primers confirmed to be properly seated is recommended for the Dragunov and its variants. This appears to have solved the \\"slam fire\\" issue. The rifle's receiver is machined to provide additional accuracy and torsional strength. The Dragunov's receiver bears a number of similarities to the AK action, such as the large dust cover, iron sights and lever safety selector, but these similarities are primarily cosmetic in nature, because the Dragunov uses a short-stroke action as opposed to the long-stroke operating mechanism of the AK. These cosmetic similarities can lead to mis-categorization of the Dragunov as an AK variant. =Barrel= The barrel profile is relatively thin to save weight. Its bore is chrome-lined for increased corrosion resistance, and features 4 right-hand grooves. In the 1960s, the twist rate was 320 mm (1:12.6 in). During the 1970s, the twist rate was increased to 240 mm (1:9.4 in), which reduced the accuracy of fire with sniper cartridges by 19%. This adaptation was done in order to facilitate the use of tracer and armor-piercing incendiary ammunition, since these bullet types required a faster twist rate for adequate stabilization.Evgeniy Dragunov: Creator of Firepower (abstracts from a forthcoming book) The muzzle is equipped with a permanently affixed long slotted flash hider, front sight and bayonet lug which is pinned to the end of the barrel. =Ammunition feeding= The rifle is fed from a detachable curved box magazine with a 10-round capacity and the cartridges are double-stacked in a staggered zigzag pattern. =Sights= PSO-1's unique reticle. The rangefinder is in the lower left, chevrons for distances higher than 1km are found in the middle, and stadia marks for windage to the left and right of the center reticule. The reticule is illuminated by a small battery-powered lamp. The rifle features mechanically adjustable backup iron sights with a sliding tangent rear sight (the iron sight line can be adjusted from in increments). The iron sights can be used with or without the standard issue optical sight in place. This is possible because the scope mount does not block the area between the front and rear sights. The Dragunov is issued with a quick-detachable PSO-1 optical sight. The PSO-1 sight (at a total length of 375 mm with a lens cover and sun shade, 4 √ó magnification and 6¬∞ field of view) mounts to a proprietary side mount Warsaw Pact rail that does not block the view of the iron sight line. The PSO-1 sight includes a variety of features, such as a bullet drop compensation (BDC) elevation adjustment knob and an illuminated rangefinder grid that can be used up to , a reticle that enables target acquisition in low light conditions as well as an infrared charging screen that is used as a passive detection system. The current version of the sight is the PSO-1M2. This telescopic sight is different from the original PSO-1 only in that it lacks the now obsolete Infra-Red detector. The PSO-1 sight enables area targets to be engaged at ranges upwards of ; effective ranges in combat situations have been stated at between , depending on the nature of the target (point or area target) quality of ammunition and skill of the shooter. Several military issue alternative telescopic sights with varying levels of magnification and reticles are available for the Dragunov. Rifles designated SVDN come equipped with a night sight, such as the NSP-3, NSPU, PGN-1, NSPUM or the Polish passive PCS-5. Rifles designated SVDN-1 can use the passive night sight NSPU-3 (1PN51) and rifles designated SVDN2 can use the passive night sight NSPUM (1PN58). Commercial non military issue mounts that attach to the Warsaw Pact rail mount allow use of Picatinny rail-based aiming optics. =Stock= SVD rifle featuring a wooden handguard/gas tube cover and skeletonized stock used before the change to synthetic black furniture. The Dragunov has a vented, two-piece wooden handguard/gas tube cover and a skeletonized wooden thumbhole stock equipped with a detachable cheek rest; the latter is removed when using iron sights. Newer production models feature synthetic furniture made of a black polymer ‚Äì the handguard and gas tube cover are more or less identical in appearance, while the thumbhole stock is of a different shape. The barrel is semi free-floated, since it is connected by a spring-loaded mechanism to the handguard/gas tube cover so the handguard can move with the barrel during firing. =Ammunition= For precision shooting, specifically designed sniper cartridges are used, developed by V. M. Sabelnikov, P. P. Sazonov and V. M. Dvorianinov. The proprietary 7N1 load has a steel jacketed projectile with an air pocket, a steel core and a lead knocker in the base for maximum terminal effect. The 7N1 was replaced in 1999 by the 7N14 round. The 7N14 is a new load developed for the SVD. It consists of a 151 grain projectile that travels at the same 830 m/s, but it has a sharp hardened steel core projectile. The rifle can also fire standard 7.62√ó54mmR ammunition with either conventional, tracer or armor-piercing incendiary rounds. The Russian military has established accuracy standards that the SVD and its corresponding sniper grade ammunition have to meet. Manufacturers must perform firing tests to check if the rifles and sniper grade ammunition fulfill these standards. To comply to the standards, the SVD rifle with 7N1 sniper cartridges may not produce more than 1.24 MOA extreme vertical spread with 240 mm twist rate barrels and no more than 1.04 MOA extreme vertical spread with 320 mm twist rate barrels. When using standard grade 57-N-323S cartridges, the accuracy of the SVD is reduced to 2.21 MOA extreme vertical spread. The extreme vertical spreads for the SVD are established by shooting 5-shot groups at 300 m range. The accuracy requirements demanded of the SVD with sniper grade ammunition are similar to the American M24 Sniper Weapon System with M118SB cartridges (1.18 MOA extreme vertical spread) and the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System with M118LR ammunition (1.27 MOA extreme vertical spread). =Accessories= Russian PSO-1M2 military issue 4x24 telescopic sight with the Warsaw Pact rail mounting system. A number of accessories are provided with the rifle, including a blade-type bayonet (AKM clipped point or the AK-74 spear point bayonet), four spare magazines, a leather or nylon sling, magazine pouch, cleaning kit and an accessory/maintenance kit for the telescopic sight. Also included is a cold weather battery case with a \\"shirt clip\\", with a permanently attached cord [approximately 24\\" long] ending with another battery case cap that has an extension to press against the internal contact in lieu of the battery to complete the circuit. Placing the external battery case into the shooters' clothing close to the body keeps it from freezing; using the clip ensures it remains in place. The clamp-style bipod attaches to machined-out reliefs near the front of the receiver, it literally grabs the two cut out areas and securely mounts with a large round sized head on the clamp bolt able to tightly attach the bipod. The legs are individually adjustable [as opposed to fixed length found on many rifles and LMG's] and can be folded and stowed in a forward position negating the need to remove the bipod before placing the rifle into the canvas carrying case. The two legs are held close together with a \\"J\\" shaped clamp attached to one leg and swung over the other leg. Original Soviet/Russian SVD bipods fetch a very high price when they rarely appear on the market. Variants Pair of Dragunovs imported to the U.S. as Tigers. The top rifle has a cheek pad, two 10-round magazines, and a flash suppressor. The bottom rifle was marketed as a hunting \\"carbine\\". It has no cheek pad, two 5-round magazines, and no flash suppressor. Russian SVDK 9.3√ó64mm Brenneke chambered sniper rifle Russian SVDM sniper rifle In the early 1990s, a compact variant of the SVD designed for airborne infantry was introduced, known as the SVDS (Russian: —Å–Ω–∞–π–ø–µ—Ä—Å–∫–∞—è –≤–∏–Ω—Ç–æ–≤–∫–∞ –î—Ä–∞–≥—É–Ω–æ–≤–∞ —Å–∫–ª–∞–¥–Ω–∞—è, short for Snayperskaya Vintovka Dragunova Skladnaya, \\"Dragunov Sniper Rifle with folding stock\\"), which features a tubular metal stock that folds to the right side of the receiver (equipped with a synthetic shoulder pad and a fixed cheek riser) and a synthetic pistol grip. The barrel was also given a heavier profile, the receiver housing was strengthened, the gas cylinder block was improved and a ported, shorter conical flash suppressor was adopted. The SVDS also comes in a night-capable variant designated SVDSN. In 1994, the Russian TsKIB SOO company (currently, a division of the KBP Instrument Design Bureau) developed the SVU sniper rifle (short for Snayperskaya Vintovka Ukorochennaya, \\"Sniper Rifle, Shortened\\") offered to special units of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD). The SVU, compared to the SVD, has a considerably shorter overall length because of the bullpup layout and shortened barrel that also received a triple-baffle muzzle brake with an approx. 40% recoil reduction effectiveness. The rifle was equipped with folding iron sights (rear aperture sight in a rotating drum) and the PSO-1 telescopic sight. A variant of the SVU, designed with a selective- fire capability and using 20-round magazines, is called the SVU-A (A ‚Äì Avtomaticheskaya). The SVDK is a Russian SVD variant chambered for the 9.3√ó64mm 7N33 cartridge. The SVDK is mechanically adapted to use dimensionally larger 9.3√ó64mm Brenneke cartridges. An improved 7.62√ó54mmR version designated as SVDM entered service in June 2018. It is based on the SVDS, featuring a thicker and heavier long barrel, improved ergonomics, an adjustable side- folding shoulder stock, and an integrated length of Picatinny rail pinned to the redesigned top cover. This allows mounting various sighting optics. The variable power 1P88-4 (1–ü88-4) telescopic sight is used as the standard day optic. The SVDM rifle can be used with a detachable bipod, and with a quick- detachable suppressor. The iron sight line features a simplified rear sight element and a new front sight element located above the gas block. The SVDM has a length of ( with the stock folded) and weighs . In 1998, Poland adopted a modernized variant of the SVD designated the SWD-M, which uses a heavy barrel, bipod (mounted to the forearm) and LD-6 (6√ó42) telescopic sight. Another variant of the SVD is the Iraqi Al-Kadesih. The 7.62√ó54mmR Al-Kadesih rifle is not to be confused with the Iraqi 7.62√ó39mm Tabuk sniper rifle.American Rifleman, February 2010, page 59 . Retrieved 26 June 2014. The Al-Kadesih, while cosmetically similar to the SVD, is essentially a hybrid of the SVD and Romanian PSL rifles and has some key differences with the SVD that prevent parts interchangeability between the two rifles. The Al-Kadesih has a unique pressed-metal receiver which is longer than that of the SVD, although the overall length of the rifle is similar to that of the SVD. It is fitted for the Soviet-era PSO-1 optical sight. Further, the barrel is pinned, rather than screwed, to the receiver, although it is of the same length as that of the SVD. The fore-end has four longitudinal slots on each side instead of six short slots. Another readily visible distinguishing feature of the Al-Kadesih is that the magazine has an ornamental relief pattern showing a stylised palm tree. =Commercial variants= The Dragunov also served as the basis for several hunting rifles. In 1962, the state armory in Izhevsk developed the Medved (Bear) rifle, initially chambered first in the 9√ó53mm cartridge and later in the 7.62√ó51mm NATO round for export. In the early 1970s, Izhevsk introduced the Tigr (Tiger) hunting rifle with a fixed thumbhole stock without a cheekpiece. They were originally produced individually, but, since 1992, they have been made serially in batches. Today, they are available with shortened (520 mm) and full length (620 mm) barrel, different stocks (including SVDS style folding stock) and chambered in 7.62√ó54mmR, .308 Winchester, .30-06 Springfield or 9.3√ó64mm Brenneke. Deployment The Dragunov is an original rifle design for several reasons. First, it was not meant for highly trained and specialized sniper teams, but rather for designated marksmen. After the introduction of the SVD, the Soviet Army deployed designated marksmen at the basic motorized infantry rifle platoon level.US Army, FM 100-2-3 The Soviet Army: Troops, Organization and Equipment, 4-3 Those designated marksmen were often chosen from personnel who did well in terms of rifle marksmanship while members of DOSAAF. Such marksmen were estimated to have a 50% probability of hitting a standing, man-sized target at , and an 80% probability of hitting a standing, man-sized target at . For distances not exceeding the probability was estimated to be well above 90%. To attain this level of accuracy the sniper could not engage more than two such targets per minute. Once the rifle had been produced in sufficient numbers every platoon of Warsaw Pact troops included at least one Dragunov rifle marksman. In the German Democratic Republic arsenals alone, there were almost 2,000 Dragunov rifles. In Warsaw Pact troop formations, the Dragunov marksmen were widespread among the regular units. To fulfill this role, the SVD is relatively light for a sniper rifle, but well balanced, making it easier to use in a dynamic battle. It is also semi-automatic, a trait it shares with the German Heckler & Koch PSG1 and US M21, so as to allow rapid fire and quicker engagement of multiple targets. As with all precision-oriented rifles, the user has to take care not to overheat the barrel and limit the use of rapid fire. In order to fire effective Armor-piercing incendiary (API) ammunition, its accuracy potential was slightly downgraded by shortening the twist rate, another uncommon priority for a pure sniper rifle. It has a relatively light barrel profile; its precision is good, but not exceptional. Like an infantry rifle, there are mounts on the barrel to fix a bayonet. The standard AKM bayonet can even be used to cut electrified barbed wire. Lastly, the rifle was meant to be a relatively cheap mass-produced firearm. These features and unusual characteristics were driven by the tactical use doctrine of Dragunov armed marksmen, which was: from (just behind) the first line targeting high- value targets of opportunity and providing special long-distance disrupting and suppressive fire on the battlefield, even with sudden close encounters with enemy troops in mind. A relatively small number of marksmen could assist conventional troops by combating or harassing valuable targets and assets such as key enemy personnel like officers, non-commissioned officers and radio operators, exposed tank commanders, designated marksmen and snipers, machinegun teams, anti-tank warfare teams, etc.Po, Enrico: Dragunov, RID Magazine June 1997 p.49-52 Users Hungarian soldier takes aim with the SVD.

There he studied music with August Ferdinand Anacker, who encouraged him to devote himself to music more fully.David Ewen, \\"Robert Volkmann\\" Composers of Yesterday. New York: H. W. Wilson Company (1937): 452. \\"He was, however, not intended for music but for pedagogy.\\" From there he went on to Leipzig in 1836 to study with Carl Ferdinand Becker. In Leipzig he met Robert Schumann, who encouraged him in his studies. They met again several times after that. When he finished his studies, he began working as voice teacher at a music school in Prague. He did not stay there long, and in 1841 he moved to Budapest,Viktor von Herzfeld, \\"Robert Volkman\\" The Musical Quarterly 1 3 (1915): 336 - 349 where he was employed as a piano teacher and a reporter for the Allgemeine Wiener Musik- Zeitung. After a short period of freelance work, he became the choirmaster and organist of a Reform synagogue in 1848.Austrian Music Dictionary (German) He composed in virtual obscurity until 1852, when his Piano Trio in B-flat minor caught the ears of Franz Liszt and Hans von B√ºlow, who proceeded to play it several times all over Europe. In 1854 Volkmann moved to Vienna, only to return to Budapest in 1858. Thanks to the publisher Gustav Heckenast, who in 1857 bought the rights to publish all Volkmann's works in exchange for regular income regardless of sales, Volkmann was able to fully dedicate himself to composition, until Heckenast closed down his Budapest publishing house in the early 1870s. While visiting Vienna in 1864, Volkmann became acquainted with Johannes Brahms, and they became close friends. In letters they addressed each other as \\"lieber Freund\\" (\\"dear friend\\"). From the 1870s Volkmann slowed down and composed very little. From 1875 until his death, he was professor of harmony and counterpoint at Budapest's National Academy of Music, where Liszt was the director. Volkmann died in Budapest on 30 October 1883.

He played professional baseball for 19 years between 1913 and 1932, including 17 seasons in Major League Baseball with the Detroit Tigers (1914, 1916‚Äì1929) and Cincinnati Reds (1930, 1932). He was a play-by-play announcer for the Tigers for 17 years from 1934 to 1950. Heilmann won four American League batting championships, securing the honors in 1921, 1923, 1925 and 1927. He appeared in 2,147 major league games, including 1,525 games as a right fielder and 448 as a first baseman and compiled a career batting average of .342, the 12th highest in major league history, and third highest among right-handed batters. At the time of his retirement in 1932, Heilmann ranked sixth in major league history with 542 doubles and eighth with 1,543 RBIs. He remains one of only five players in American League history to hit .400 for a season, having accomplished the feat in 1923 with a .403 batting average. At his peak from 1921 to 1927, Heilmann compiled a .380 batting average, .452 on-base percentage, .583 slugging percentage, and averaged 116 RBI, 41 doubles, 11 triples, and 104 runs scored per season. After retiring from baseball, Heilmann ran unsuccessfully for the office of Detroit City Treasurer and operated a semipro baseball team in 1933 and, in 1934, began a career as a radio broadcaster. From 1934 to 1941, he was play-by-play announcer for the Tigers on station WXYZ and the Michigan Radio Network, covering parts of Michigan located outside metropolitan Detroit, while rival Ty Tyson called games for station WWJ in Detroit exclusively. From 1942 to 1950, Heilmann was the exclusive radio voice of the Tigers throughout the state. Heilmann died from lung cancer in July 1951; he was posthumously elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame six months later in January 1952 after garnering 86.75% of the votes. Early years Heilmann was born in San Francisco in 1894. His father, Richard W. Heilmann, was born in 1860 at Sacramento, California, the son of an Irish mother and a father from Saxony.California State Library; California History Section; Sacramento, California; Miscellaneous Card Indexes: Vital Statistics Index (1900-1951); Reel #: 17; California History Room: Microfilm # 734.

His mother, Mary (McVoy) Heilmann, sometimes referred to as Mollie, was born in 1864 in County Roscommon, Ireland.1910 Census entry of Mary Heilmann and family. Harry was the couple's fourth surviving child, having an older sister, May, and two older brothers, Richard, Jr., and Walter. Heilmann's father operated a soap business, ran as a Republican for the office of Supervisor of San Francisco's Ninth Ward in 1896, and died in June 1897 at age 36. As a boy in the 1890s and continuing at least through the time of the 1900 Census, Heilmann lived with his family at 708A Brannan Street in what is now the South of Market district of San Francisco.Year: 1900; Census Place: San Francisco, San Francisco, California; Roll: 101; Page: 6A; Enumeration District: 0067; FHL microfilm: 1240101.

Heilmann was 11 years old at the time of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake that killed approximately 3,000 people and left nearly 75% of the city's population homeless and living in refugee camps.Casualties and Damage after the 1906 earthquake USGS Earthquake Hazards Program ‚Äì Northern California, Accessed September 4, 2006Displays at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Museum in Sausalito, California Heilmann's older brother, Walter, was a gifted athlete who attended Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory (then \\"Sacred Heart College\\") in San Francisco. On June 3, 1908, a year after the city's devastation by earthquake, Walter died at age 16 while on a sailboat excursion with three schoolmates to visit the battleship USS Connecticut in drydock at the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, near the present site of Candlestick Park. The boat capsized in a squall, and Walter drowned while trying to swim to shore; the other three boys were rescued. As of 1910, Heilmann was living with his mother at 112 Sixteenth Street in the Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco. Heilmann followed his older brother to what is now Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory, where he played football, track and field, and basketball, but not baseball. He graduated from Sacred Heart in 1912 at age 17 with a collegiate certificate. After graduating from Sacred Heart, Heilmann worked as a bookkeeper for the Mutual Biscuit Company. Professional baseball career =Minor leagues= Heilmann appeared in a semipro baseball game in 1913 for a team from Hanford, California. While playing for Hanford, he was signed by a scout for the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). After being signed by the Beavers, Heilmann was assigned to the Portland Colts of the Northwestern League. He compiled a .305 batting average in 122 games for the Colts. =Detroit Tigers= 1914 to 1920 seasons Heilmann won the PCL batting title with the San Francisco Seals in 1915 In September 1913, Heilmann was drafted by the Detroit Tigers. He made his major league debut with the Tigers on May 16, 1914, and played in 68 games that year, batting .225 and committing six errors in 31 games in the outfield (29 games in center field) for an .870 fielding percentage. For the 1915 season, the Tigers sent Heilmann to the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). Heilmann missed the latter portion of the season after suffering from dizzy spells. Before the health problems sidelined him, Heilmann appeared in 98 games for the Seals and compiled a .364 batting average and .544 slugging percentage with 23 doubles and 12 home runs. His .364 batting average led the PCL for the 1915 season. Heilmann returned to the Tigers in 1916 and appeared in 136 games, including 30 games at first base and 77 as an outfielder. Although his .282 batting average was low by the standards he would set later, he ranked among the American League leaders with 30 doubles (seventh best), 77 RBIs (sixth best) and 43 extra base hits (eighth). He also became a favorite in Detroit for his actions off the field. On July 25, 1916, he saved a woman whose vehicle had rolled into the Detroit River, diving into the water to rescue her, although two others died in the accident. His heroic act was reported in the national press, and he was loudly applauded at the next day's game. He continued to improve at the plate in 1917, once again ranking among the American League leaders with 85 RBIs (fourth), five home runs (seventh) and 11 triples (eighth); but he was called \\"Slug\\" due to his notoriously slow running and difficulties in the field. In 1917, the Tigers tried playing him in right field (95 games), center field (28) and first base (27), but he was not particularly good at any of those positions. In 1918, Heilmann appeared in 79 games for the Tigers, 40 in right field and 37 at first base, compiling a .276 batting average. In mid-July 1918, he left the Tigers to enlist in the United States Navy during World War I. He served as a quartermaster on submarines off the West Coast of the United States. He returned to the Tigers in 1919 and had his best season to date, ranking among the American League leaders with a .320 batting average (10th best), .477 slugging percentage (seventh), 92 RBIs (fourth), 53 extra base hits (fourth again), 15 triples (second), 256 total bases (fifth), 172 hits (sixth) and eight home runs (eighth). He had another strong year in 1920 with a .309 average, 41 extra base hits and 89 RBIs, but he continued to fall short in the field in those two years. Detroit manager Hughie Jennings made him the Tigers' starting first baseman, and he led the league in errors at that position both years, including 31 in 1919 for a .979 fielding percentage. Heilmann was married on October 5, 1920, to Mary H. Maynes, commonly known as Mae.Ancestry.com. Michigan, Marriage Records, 1867-1952 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2015. They had a daughter, Mary Ellen, and a son, Harry, Jr., and lived in Detroit. 1921 season Heilmann circa 1914 In 1921, Heilmann appeared in 149 games, including 145 as the Tigers' starting right fielder. He won his first batting title, compiling a .394 batting average to outpace his manager and teammate Ty Cobb who hit .389. Unofficial figures released in October showed Cobb as the batting champion, but official figures released in December showed Heilmann to be the champion. He was the first right-handed batter to win the American League batting title since Nap Lajoie in 1905. Heilmann also led the American League in 1921 with 237 hits and ranked second behind Babe Ruth with 139 RBIs, 365 total bases, a .606 slugging percentage, 292 times on base, a 7.3 offensive wins above replacement (WAR) rating, and 159 runs created. He also ranked among the league leaders with a .444 on-base percentage (third behind Ruth and Cobb), 43 doubles (third behind Tris Speaker and Ruth), and 76 extra base hits (third behind Ruth and Bob Meusel). Heilmann's batting average in 1921 was 85 points higher than his 1920 average and 101 points higher than his career average prior to 1921. Some attributed Heilmann's dramatic improvement to the tutelage of Ty Cobb, who took over as the Tigers' manager in 1921. Others attributed Heilmann's improvement to the \\"live-ball era\\" that started in 1920 and forced outfielders to spread out and play deeper, allowing more of Heilmann's line drives to fall into the wider gaps. However, Frank G. Menke attributed his improvement to having learned the game, noting that the \\"lively ball\\" failed to account for the fact that those who outhit Heilmann from 1914 to 1920 were no longer outhitting him. Menke observed: > There is nothing picturesque, nothing highly colored, nothing bombastic or > spectacular about his methods. He is not a grandstander -- not theatrical. > And because he isn't, he does not get the acclaim and the plaudits which > men, less wonderful, but better showmen, achieve for themselves. Though primarily a line-drive hitter, Heilmann could also hit for power. His 19 home runs in 1921 ranked fifth in the American League, and he ranked among the league leaders in home runs 11 times. On July 8, 1921, Heilmann hit a home run off \\"Bullet Joe\\" Bush that traveled over the center field fence in Detroit and \\"actually made the patrons gasp in astonishment.\\" Heilmann's home run was widely reported to have traveled 610 feet, eclipsing Babe Ruth's longest home run of 465 feet. Detroit's grounds keeper was more conservative, reporting that no measurement was made, but estimating that it traveled more than 500 feet. In a column published after the 1921 season, Grantland Rice rated Heilmann as the premier scholar in the American League's School of Swat, ahead of Cobb and Ruth. The entire Tiger lineup hit remarkably well in 1921. In addition to Heilmann and Cobb's 1-2 finish for the batting title, Detroit's third outfielder, Bobby Veach, was also among the league's best at .338. The 1921 Tigers finished the season with a team batting average of .316, the highest in American League history and second highest in major league history. However, true to the baseball adage that good pitching beats good hitting, the 1921 Tigers lacked good pitching and finished in sixth place, 27 games behind the pennant-winning Yankees. The 1921 season marked the start of a seven-year stretch in which Heilmann compiled a .380 batting average, .452 on-base percentage, .583 slugging percentage, and averaged 116 RBIs, 41 doubles, 11 triples, 15 home runs, and 104 runs scored. Batting style and speed Heilmann was known as a line drive hitter who clubbed the ball harder than any batter of his era with the exception of Babe Ruth. His one major handicap as a player was a lack of speed that led to his being known by the nickname \\"Slug\\". He was long known as \\"one of the slowest men in baseball.\\" Hall of Fame sportswriter Tommy Holmes noted: \\"Heilmann was never much faster than an ice wagon on the base paths. Without doubt, he is the slowest moving great hitter who ever lived.\\" According to Holmes, Ty Cobb's speed added 50 hits a year to his output, while Heilmann's lack of speed robbed him of infield hits. Sportswriter Harry Grayson later wrote that Heilmann's inability to beat out infield hits was the one thing that kept Heilmann from matching Rogers Hornsby as the greatest right-handed batter in baseball history. 1922 season 1922 baseball card of Heilmann In February 1922, Heilmann refused to sign his contract, demanding to be paid $15,000. On March 3, 1922, Heilmann signed a contract for $12,500 with the Tigers, agreeing to report to spring training the following week. His spring training was then interrupted again in late March when he returned to Detroit to be with his wife for the birth of their son on March 28, 1922. By late June, Heilmann was batting .387 and battling George Sisler for the American League batting championship. On August 26, 1922, Heilman's season came to an end when he sustained a complete break of his collarbone when he crashed into Frank Brower while trying to beat out an infield hit. Heilmann had to have his collarbone rebroken and reset, and it was then discovered that Heilmann had also broken his shoulder. The injuries were so severe that Heilmann remained hospitalized until a week before the end of the season, and even after leaving the hospital, he feared he might never play again. Despite missing the last five weeks of the season, Heilmann hit a career high 21 home runs, fourth in the American League, and also ranked among the league leaders with a .356 batting average (fourth), a .432 on-base percentage (fifth) and a .598 slugging percentage (fourth). 1923 season In January 1923, while preparing for spring training and recuperating from his collar and shoulder injuries, Heilmann took up handball and quickly developed a reputation as one of the best players in the country. Heilmann's efforts at handball also helped him shed excess weight, reporting in spring training at 200 pounds, 30 pounds less than he had reported in 1922. During the 1923 season, Heilmann won his second batting title, hitting .403 for the season, edging out Babe Ruth who hit .393. Heilmann in 1923 became the fourth American League player to hit .400 or more for a season, joining Ty Cobb, Nap Lajoie and George Sisler. Only one other American League player, Ted Williams in 1941, has accomplished the feat since 1923. In addition to winning the 1923 batting crown, Heilmann had one of his best seasons as a slugger. He finished second to Ruth in on-base percentage (.481), slugging percentage (.632) and wins above replacement (9.3). He also ranked among the American League leaders with 115 RBIs (third), 211 hits (third), 18 home runs (third), 121 runs scored (fourth), 331 total bases (fourth), 44 doubles (fourth), and 73 extra base hits (fourth). Despite hitting over .400, he finished third in the 1923 American League Most Valuable Player voting behind Ruth and Eddie Collins. Heilmann in 1923 denied Ruth a Major League Baseball Triple Crown for the second time; Ruth led the league in home runs and RBIs in both 1921 and 1923, but was edged out in batting average in both years by Heilmann. In 1926, another Tiger, Heinie Manush, won the batting title to deny Ruth the triple crown a third time. Heilmann worked as a life insurance agent during the off- season in the 1920s. On October 16, 1923, after Ruth had received his World Series winner's share‚Äö Heilmann‚Äö who was friends with Ruth despite having beaten him for the batting title‚Äö sold Ruth a $50‚Äö000 life insurance policy. 1924 season In 1924, Heilmann's batting average dropped by 56 points to .346, which ranked sixth in the American League. Despite the \\"slump\\" in batting average, Heilmann led the league with 45 doubles and ranked second behind Babe Ruth with a .533 slugging percentage, a 6.4 wins above replacement rating among position players, and 130 runs created. He also ranked among the league leaders with 304 total bases (third), 71 extra base hits (third), 16 triples (third), 107 runs scored (fourth), 278 times on base (fourth), a .428 on-base percentage (fifth), and 114 RBIs (fifth). He appeared in 145 games as the Tigers' starting right fielder in 1924 and had his best defensive season, leading the league with 31 outfield assists; he never had more than 18 in any other season. He also led the league's right fielders with 263 putouts. Heilmann finished ninth in the voting for the 1924 American League Most Valuable Player award. 1925 season In 1925, Heilmann appeared in 150 games, 147 as Detroit's starting right fielder, and won his third batting title, this time in a close race with Tris Speaker. Going into the final day of the season, Heilmann trailed Speaker and needed a strong performance to pass him. On the last day, the Tigers played a doubleheader against the St. Louis Browns, and Heilmann had six hits, including a home run, in nine at bats. Heilmann finished with a .393 average, four points higher than Speaker. He was again among the American League leaders in most offensive categories, with 293 times on base (first), a 7.1 offensive wins above replacement rating (first), 134 RBIs (tied for first), 225 hits (third), a .457 on-base percentage (fourth), 326 total bases (fourth), a .569 slugging percentage (fifth), 40 doubles (fifth), and 64 extra base hits (fifth). Despite his accomplishments, the 1925 American League MVP award went to Roger Peckinpaugh, who hit almost 100 points below Heilmann and had 70 fewer RBIs than Heilmann but whose Senators repeated as pennant winners. 1926 season In 1926, Heilmann appeared in 141 games, 133 as the Tigers' starting right fielder, and compiled a .367 batting average, .445 on-base percentage, and .534 slugging percentage. Heilmann ranked fourth in batting average in the American League, and the Detroit outfield took three of the top four spots in the batting race, as center fielder Heinie Manush won the batting crown with a .378 average, and left fielder Bob Fothergill finished third with a .367 average. Heilmann's .445 on-base percentage was second best in the American League, and he once again hit more than 100 RBIs (had 101 RBIs) and finished fifth in American League MVP voting. On August 8, 1926, the Tigers held a Harry Heilmann Day at which Detroit Mayor John W. Smith presented Heilmann with a $5,000 Cadillac sports sedan, donated by Lawrence Fisher of Fisher Body, in front of a crowd of 40,000 spectators at Briggs Field. 1927 season In 1927, Heilmann again appeared in 141 games, 135 as the starter in right field. He won his fourth and final batting crown with a .398 batting average in a close race with Al Simmons who hit .392. On August 13, Simmons led Heilmann by 26 points, .393 to .367, but Heilmann took the lead after totaling 27 hits in 11 games in the latter half of August. He then slumped in early September to fall behind Simmons and trailed by one point going into the last day of the season. On the final day of the season, in a doubleheader at Cleveland, Heilmann had seven hits in nine at bats, including two home runs and three doubles, to add seven points to his average and overtake Simmons to win the batting championship. He also ranked among the league leaders with a .475 on-base percentage (second), 120 RBIs (third), 201 hits (third), 50 doubles (third), 73 extra base hits (third), .616 slugging percentage (fourth), 311 total bases (fourth) and 106 runs scored (fifth). Despite winning his fourth batting title, Heilmann still finished second in the American League MVP voting, this time behind Lou Gehrig of the Murderers' Row 1927 Yankees. When a reporter reminded him that he had won batting titles every odd-numbered year from 1921 to 1927, Heilmann replied: \\"Mr. Navin [Detroit owner] gives me contracts on a two-year basis. I always bear down real hard when a new contract is coming up.\\" 1928 and 1929 seasons In 1928, Heilmann appeared in 151 games for the Tigers, 125 as the team's starting right fielder and 24 as the starting first baseman. He compiled a .328 batting average, 70 points lower than his 1927 average of .398, but still seventh best in the American League. He also ranked among the American League leaders with 107 RBIs (fifth), 62 extra base hits (fifth), 283 total bases (fifth), 14 home runs (sixth), a .507 slugging percentage (eighth), 183 hits (eighth), and 38 doubles (eighth). In 1929, Heilmann was suspended in the spring for \\"indifferent training\\" and then finished the season on the bench. He ended up appearing in 125 games, 111 as the team's starting right fielder, and compiled a .344 batting average, ninth best in the American League. He again ranked among the league leaders with 120 RBIs (fifth), a .565 slugging percentage (seventh), 41 doubles (seventh), and a .412 on-base percentage (ninth). =Cincinnati Reds= In October 1929, the Tigers offered Heilmann on waivers to the other American League teams, but he went unclaimed, as no team was willing to pay the waiver price of $7,500. He was then sold by the Tigers to the Cincinnati Reds for a sum reported to be somewhat under $25,000. During the 1930 season, Heilmann appeared in 142 games with the Reds, 106 as the team's starting right fielder and 19 at first base. He compiled a .333 batting average and .416 on-base percentage, the highest on the Cincinnati club in 1930. He also totaled 68 extra base hits, 19 home runs and 91 RBIs and ranked among the National League leaders with 43 doubles (seventh) and 64 bases on balls (eighth). While not previously known for his fielding, his 2.78 range factor in 1930 remains the second highest in major league history for a right fielder. In March 1931, Heilmann was incapacitated by arthritis in his right wrist. The arthritis was so severe that he was hospitalized for a time in the spring. He ended up missing the entire 1931 season. In January 1932, Heilmann was reported by the Reds to be in \\"great shape\\". He trained himself in Hot Springs and reported in late February that he believed himself ready. However, he appeared in only 15 games for the Reds, primarily as a pinch hitter and in five games as the team's starting first baseman. He compiled a .258 batting average in 31 at bats and appeared in his last major league game on May 31, 1932. He was released by the Reds on June 6, 1932. It was reported at the time that his arthritic wrist had \\"lost its snap, and the power of his bat and throwing arm was gone.\\" Radio career Heilmann worked in the insurance business in Cincinnati while he played for the Reds. After retiring from baseball in 1932, Heilmann returned to Detroit and continued there in the insurance business. He also ran in 1933 for the office of Detroit City Treasurer, losing decisively to Charles L. Williams by a margin of 138,478 votes for Williams to 68,695 for Heilmann. He also played sandlot baseball briefly for the Tool Shop team in the Detroit Amateur Baseball Federation. On June 4, 1933, a crowd of more than 20,000 spectators watched Heilmann's return to baseball, as Heilmann had an RBI single in the first inning and made a \\"big league catch\\" in right field before a thunderstorm forced the cancellation of the game in the second inning. After a few games with Tool Shop, Heilmann organized his own team, known as Harry Heilmann's All-Stars and consisting of former major league players, including Bobby Veach, Oscar Stanage, \\"Leaping Mike\\" Menosky, Marty Kavanagh, and Frank Fuller, which played games throughout Michigan and Ohio in July, August and September 1933, including a game against an African-American team from Akron. In 1934, Heilman was hired by WXYZ to handle the play-by-play responsibility on broadcasts of Detroit Tigers games for the Michigan Radio Network. At the start of the 1934 season, he was paired with Harold True, but became a solo broadcaster by the end of the season and thereafter. During the Tigers' 1935 championship season, Heilmann broadcast all home games for the Tigers, while out-of-town games were relayed by telegraph with play-by-play being read by Bob Longstreet from the WXYZ studio in the Maccabees Building. In the fall of 1934, Heilmann also began broadcasting a football highlights show on Saturday evenings on the WXYZ and the Michigan Radio Network. In 1936, he also broadcast out-of-town Tigers games on CKLW radio. He also began broadcasting a sports interview show on WXYZ in 1936. In 1937, Heilmann further expanded his radio responsibilities with a daily recap of the day's baseball games, broadcast at 5:30 p.m. on WXYZ. In 1938, he continued his broadcasts of Tigers home and out-of-town games on WXYZ, and added a 12:45 p.m. interview show with the fan on the street, broadcast Monday through Saturday on WXYZ. As his popularity grew, Heilmann expanded outside the sports realm in 1939 with a new interview program co-hosted with WXYZ staff announcer John (Johnny) Slagle. The program was titled \\"Town Meeting\\" and was broadcast at 12:45 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays on WXYZ and the Michigan Radio Network. In the fall of 1939, Heilmann also joined Carl Gensel on broadcasts of Michigan State Spartans football games. Through the 1941 season, Heilmann was part of an unusual broadcasting arrangement. Heilmann's Tiger broadcasts for WXYZ anchored the Michigan Radio Network that stretched across Michigan, while Ty Tyson did play-by-play separately on WWJ for metropolitan Detroit. In the years of competing broadcasts, it took time for Heilmann to develop a following. One reporter noted: > A raspy voice, an Eastern accent and the contrast with Tyson's polished > delivery irritated some who listened to Harry. There was no such thing as a > Tiger fan who liked both announcers ‚Äî you were either a Tyson fan or a > Heilmann fan, never both. In 1942, the Tigers gave exclusive broadcast rights to WXYZ with Heilmann as the sole announcer. From 1942 until 1950, Heilmann became the exclusive radio voice of the Tigers in Detroit and throughout Michigan. He was the voice of the Tigers in 1940 and 1945 when the Tigers won the American League pennant and won the 1945 World Series over the Chicago Cubs. He became known for his gift as a story-teller and for his knowledge of the game. In 1951, Detroit Free Press sports editor Lyall Smith described Heilmann's broadcasting style: > In an era when radiomen frequently went into hysterics and fabricated spine- > tingling situations, Harry was content to inform his listeners merely what > actually happened on the diamond. These factual accounts were interspersed > with tips on inside baseball and stories from his vast fund of diamond lore. Baseball historian Marc Okkonen grew up listening to Heilmann's broadcasts and later recalled Heilmann's tendency to drop the letter \\"r\\" from the end of words, referring to Hal Newhouser as \\"Newhousa\\" and Bob Feller as \\"Fellah\\". He also recalled that one of Heilmann's sponsors was a fly spray called Bugaboo; when an outfielder would catch a fly ball, Heilmann would proclaim, \\"Bugaboo! Another dead fly!\\" Okkonenen also recalled Heilmann's most memorable line, uttered after outstanding plays, when he would remain silent to emphasize the crowd noise and say, \\"Listen ... to the voice of baseball.\\" In March 1946, Heilmann sustained five broken ribs and a broken chest bone in an automobile accident in Florida during spring training. Despite the injuries, he broadcast the Tigers games from opening day forward during the 1946 season. On September 11, 1948, the Tigers held a Harry Heilmann Day at Briggs Stadium. He was honored between games of a double-header and presented with a solid gold pass for all games played at Briggs Stadium. Death Heilmann was ill for much of the winter after the 1950 season. On March 14, 1951, he collapsed at the Tigers' spring training camp in Lakeland, Florida. He was hospitalized at Morrell Hospital in Lakeland, and the Detroit Free Press reported two days later that he was in critical condition with a lung condition. At the end of March, after two weeks in the Lakeland hospital, the Tigers' owner Walter O. Briggs flew Heilmann back to Detroit on his private plane. Heilmann was taken by ambulance from the airport to Henry Ford Hospital, where he remained hospitalized. He remained hospitalized through the month of April, and Ty Tyson was selected to fill in for Heilmann on Tiger broadcasts during Heilmann's illness. Heilmann was released from the hospital and returned home in May 1951. On June 1, 1951, he was greeted warmly by the crowd when he and his wife attended a game at Briggs Stadium. He also returned briefly to the Tiger broadcasts in early June, sharing the duties with Tyson and Paul Williams. Heilmann was hospitalized again at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit on June 24 as his condition worsened, and he died there on July 9, 1951. It was only after his death that it was disclosed that the nature of his illness was lung cancer. Detroit mayor Albert Cobo recalled that Heilmann's radio broadcasts made him \\"almost a member of the family\\" to Detroiters. Team owner Walter Briggs recalled Heilmann as one of his closest friends and said, \\"I doubt whether the death of any other person in the State of Michigan could cause more genuine regret.\\" The 1951 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was played in Detroit on the day after Heilmann died and began with a moment of silence in his honor. Heilmann's funeral mass was celebrated by Father Charles Coughlin at the Shrine of the Little Flower in Royal Oak, Michigan. He was buried at the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Southfield, Michigan. Career accomplishments and legacy Over the course of his major league career, Heilmann appeared in 2,147 games, including 1,525 games as a right fielder and 448 as a first baseman. He compiled a career batting average of .342 with a .410 on-base percentage and a .520 slugging percentage. Heilmann's notable accomplishments include the following: * Heilmann's .342 batting average ranks 12th in major league history. Among right-handed batters, his average ranks third behind only Rogers Hornsby and Ed Delahanty. His .410 on-base percentage ranks 35th in major league history, and his .520 slugging percentage ranks 58th. * Heilmann remains one of only six players in American League history to hit .400 for a season. The others are Nap Lajoie, Shoeless Joe Jackson, Ty Cobb, George Sisler, and Ted Williams. Heilmann accomplished the feat in 1923 with a .403 batting average. * He is one of six players to have won four or more American League batting titles. The others are Ty Cobb (twelve), Rod Carew (seven), Ted Williams (six), Wade Boggs (five), and Miguel Cabrera (four). * At the time of his retirement in 1932, his 542 doubles ranked sixth in major league history,(The only players who had hit more doubles at the end of the 1932 season were Tris Speaker, Ty Cobb, Nap Lajoie, Honus Wagner, and Cap Anson.) and his 1,543 RBIs ranked eighth in major league history.(The only players who had compiled more RBIs at the end of the 1932 season were Babe Ruth, Cap Anson, Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner, Nap Lajoie, Rogers Hornsby, and Jake Beckley.) * Heilmann's 164 home runs while playing for Detroit was a club record when he was sold to the Reds at the end of the 1929 season; his record was broken in 1938 by Hank Greenberg. In the weeks prior to Heilmann's death, Ty Cobb led a campaign, supported by Arthur Daley of The New York Times and H. G. Salsinger of The Detroit News, to hold a special election so that Heilmann could be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame before his death. Heilmann had received 87 of 167 ballots cast (52.1%) in 1950 and 153 of 226 ballots cast (67.7%) in 1951, below the 75% threshold. Heilmann died before action could be taken on the proposed special election, but on January 31, 1952, the National Baseball Hall of Fame announced that Heilmann would be inducted that summer, having garnered 203 of the 234 (86.75%) votes cast. He was represented by his widow at the induction ceremony in July 1952. Heilmann has continued to be recognized as one of the greatest players in the history of the game. Significant honors include the following: * In 1969, Heilmann was selected in fan voting as one of the three outfielders (Ty Cobb and Al Kaline were the others) on the all time Detroit Tigers team. * In 1994, fellow Hall of Fame slugger Ted Williams rated Heilmann as the 17th best overall hitter of all time. * In 1999, Heilmann was ranked 54th on The Sporting News list of 100 Greatest Baseball Players.100 Greatest Baseball Players by The Sporting News * In 1999, he was selected as one of the 100 greatest players as part of the voting process for Major League Baseball's All-Century Team.

But an old and corrupt Centaurian Empire is holding Terra down, as it encircles the Terran system and will not let the humans grow out of their current empire. For this reason Terra is at war with Proxima Centauri and is trying to find a way of breaking free from the Centaurian's hold upon them. In the war that results, Terra is continually coming up with new weapons to try and break the Centaurian defenses, but Proxima Centauri is also continually updating its defenses. Using spies and other such tactics, both parties find out about each other's advances, and no actual fighting ever occurs because both sides are too busy trying to beat each other with new technological developments. Terra even calculates their chances to win a war versus Centauri and updates these calculations with each new development, making their decision about a war rely on this calculation. Eventually Terra comes up with a concept for a bomb, called Icarus, that Proxima can not defend against because it travels at faster than light speeds, making use of the buildup of mass at near light speeds as a destructive agent when it slows down to below light speed. Then the odds start to side with Terra, and Terra prepares to fight with this new- found technology. There are two problems; the first is that Icarus does not yet work, which prevents Terra from using it against Proxima Centauri, and the second is the existence of a man from the past brought to the present. He is an \\"unknown variable\\" that confuses the almost prophetic SRB machines which calculate the probability of winning the war that all war decisions rely on. Hence, the book is titled \\"The Variable Man\\". This is where Thomas Cole, known as The Variable Man, comes in. Cole is a man from the past, from 1913, the time just before the First World War. He is brought into the present (or future depending on perspective) as an accident via a Time Bubble that was used for research about the past. He escapes from the authority in the future and spends a lot of time running from them afterwards. It is, however, discovered that this man has a certain genius to fix things and make things work. This is because he comes out of a period of time when humans had a natural genius and an ability to invent things and to solve problems. It is at this point that the man working on the FTL (Faster Than Light) bomb realizes that The Variable Man is the only person who can make Icarus work. As a result, the engineer working on Icarus convinces The Variable Man to help them out. Icarus does eventually work, although not in the way that anyone may have wanted. Instead of emerging from FTL speed in the middle of Centarus (the sun around which the Centaurian Empire is built) and blowing it, and the surrounding Centaurian system, out of existence, it turns out that Cole transformed (or fixed) Icarus into a working hyperdrive. However the order for Terra to launch a full-scale attack against the Centaurian Empire (under the assumption that the majority of the enemy ships and planets would have been destroyed in the Icarus explosion) had already been given. The forces of Terra suffered a terrible defeat, losing many of their ships, yet due to the Variable Man having successfully wired Icarus it was now possible for Terra to travel beyond the Centaurian Empire's perimeter. Terra was no longer blocked into their tiny system, and there was no further need for war. References External links  The Variable Man - PDF Version.

Crawford batted and threw left-handed, stood tall and weighed . Born in Wahoo, Nebraska, he had a short minor league baseball career before rapidly rising to the majors with the Cincinnati Reds in 1899. He played for the Reds until 1902. Taking advantage of the competition for players between the National League and the then-ascendant American League, Crawford then joined the Detroit Tigers and played for Detroit, primarily in right field, from 1903 to 1917. He was one of the greatest sluggers of his era, leading his league in home runs twice and in runs batted in three times. He still holds the MLB record for most career triples, with 309. While with the Tigers, Crawford played alongside superstar Ty Cobb, and the two had an intense rivalry while also helping Detroit win three American League championships from 1907 to 1909. After his MLB career ended, Crawford moved to California, where he lived the rest of his life. He was a player and umpire in the Pacific Coast League and was a coach at the University of Southern California. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1957. Early life Crawford was born in Wahoo, Nebraska, in 1880, the son of Stephen O. Crawford (born 1842 in Vermont) and Nellie Crawford (born 1855 in Iowa). In 1901, he married Ada M. Lattin, born circa 1881 in Nebraska. He was listed as a ballplayer in 1910, and had one daughter, Virginia, born circa 1905 in Michigan. Various ship records confirm his birthdate and that of wife Ada. As of the 1920 U.S. census the family was living in Los Angeles, with other records establishing Samuel having arrived March 15, 1918. According to a biography from the Nebraska Hall of Fame, Crawford was a star athlete at Wahoo High School, leading the team to two state football championships in 1896 and 1897 and was also noted for \\"foot racing\\" wherever he played. In 1898, he joined a traveling baseball team in Wahoo. They traveled on a lumber wagon from town to town for weeks at a time, challenging the locals to baseball games, and passing the hat to pay their expenses. Crawford was offered an opportunity in the spring of 1899 to play for the Chatham Reds of the Canadian League for $65 per month, plus board. Crawford seized the opportunity and left behind his job as a barber's apprentice. From Chatham, Crawford moved on to play for the Grand Rapids Prodigals in the Western League. Major League Baseball career =Cincinnati Reds= In September 1899, Grand Rapids sold Crawford to the Cincinnati Reds. Crawford played in 31 games for the Reds at the end of the 1899 season. At age 19, and one year removed from his days playing for Wahoo's traveling team, Crawford was playing in the major leagues with future Hall of Famers Jake Beckley and Bid McPhee. Crawford hit .307 in 31 games with the Reds in 1899. In 1900, at age 20, he played in 101 games and was among the National League leaders in triples with 15 and home runs with seven. Crawford was one of the best sluggers in baseball in 1901, batting .330 and hitting a major league leading 16 home runs. He was also third in the National League in triples (16), RBIs (104) and slugging percentage (.524). Crawford had another solid year in 1902, leading the National League in total bases (256) and triples (22), and placing second in batting average (.333), slugging percentage (.461) and extra base hits (43). He hit 12 inside-the-park home runs in 1901 ‚Äì a major league record that has never been equaled. =Detroit Tigers= 1911 baseball card of Crawford At the end of 1902, a bidding war for players developed between the National League and American League. Crawford signed contracts with both the Reds and the Detroit Tigers. The competing contracts led to a publicized legal dispute, with a judge ultimately awarding Crawford to the Tigers but requiring $3,000 in compensation to the Reds. Crawford joined the Tigers for the 1903 season and remained there until the end of his major league career in 1917. In 1903, he led the American League with 25 triples, and finished second in the batting race with a .335 batting average. With the addition of Ty Cobb at the end of the 1905 season, the Tigers had two of the best hitters in baseball. Cobb and Crawford led Detroit to three straight American League pennants in 1907, 1908 and 1909, but both of them slumped in their World Series appearances, as the Tigers lost all three. Crawford hit for a .243 average in three World Series, and Cobb hit an uncharacteristic .200 in the 1907 World Series and .231 in the 1909 World Series. Although Crawford never got to play in another World Series, he remained one of the most feared hitters in baseball through 1915. In 1911, he hit a career-high .378 with 115 RBIs and 57 extra base hits. From 1913 to 1915, Crawford played in 472 consecutive games for the Tigers. Crawford was among the American League leaders in hits, RBIs, extra base hits, slugging percentage and total bases every year from 1905 to 1915. He led the American League in triples five times, including an American League record 26 triples in 1914. Crawford remains the all-time major league leader with 309 triples in his career. Though his defense suffered in his later years, Crawford was a good fielder in his prime. In 1900, his range factor was 2.68 ‚Äì 55 points higher than the league average of 2.13. In 1905, he led all American League outfielders with a .988 fielding percentage ‚Äì 35 points higher than the league average. Despite Crawford leading the league in both RBI (112) and extra base hits (54) in 1915, the Tigers began transitioning the right field responsibilities from Crawford to their young hitting star, future Baseball Hall of Famer Harry Heilmann in 1916. That year, Crawford played 78 games in right field, and Heilmann played 66, with Crawford's plate appearances cut almost in half from 694 to 368. In 1917, Crawford lost his spot in the lineup altogether and was relegated principally to a pinch-hitting role. In his new limited role, Crawford hit .173 in 104 at bats. At the end of the 1917 season, Crawford was released and did not play in Major League Baseball again. =Career accomplishments= Crawford was one of the greatest sluggers of the dead-ball era. He still holds the major league records for triples in a career (309) and inside-the-park home runs in a season (12). He has the second most inside-the-park home runs in a career (51), and the remarkable distinction of hitting more triples than doubles four times in his career: 22 to 18 in 1902, 25 to 23 in 1903, 26 to 22 in 1914, and 13 to 11 in 1916, the last as at the ripe old age for a ballplayer of his era of 36. Crawford became the first player to lead both the National League and American League in home runs (1901 and 1908). He was among the AL leaders in hits, RBI, extra base hits, slugging percentage and total bases for 11 consecutive years, from 1905 to 1915. Using Baseball-Reference.com's \\"Gray Ink Test\\", which awards points based on how often a player is among the league batting leaders, Crawford ranks as the ninth in baseball history. He finished his career with 2,961 hits and a .309 batting average. He ranks fifth on the Detroit Tigers all-time hits list with 2,466 hits as a Tiger. Ed Barrow, who managed Crawford in his first two years with Detroit, and went on to convert Babe Ruth to an outfielder as general manager of the Yankees, once said that there never was a better hitter than Crawford. One of his contemporaries, Fielder Jones, said of Crawford: \\"None of them can hit quite as hard as Crawford. He stands up at the plate like a brick house and he hits all the pitchers, without playing favorites.\\" =Rivalry with Ty Cobb= Cobb and Crawford with a camera, circa 1914 Sam Crawford and Ty Cobb were teammates for parts of 13 seasons. They played beside each other in right and center field, and Crawford followed Cobb in the batting order year after year. Despite this, the two had a complicated relationship. When Cobb entered the major leagues with the Tigers in 1905, Crawford was one of the Detroit veterans who bullied Cobb. Cobb, a volatile personality, took it personally. However, Cobb soon became established as the best hitter in the game and became more accepted on the Tigers team as they won AL championships in 1907, 1908, and 1909. During this time, Cobb and Crawford had a student- teacher relationship. In interviews late in life with Al Stump, Cobb told of studying Crawford's base-stealing technique and of how Crawford would teach him about pursuing fly balls and throwing out base runners. Cobb said that he would always remember Crawford's kindness.Al Stump, Cobb: The Life and Times of the Meanest Man Who Ever Played Baseball (1994), pp. 58‚Äì60 The student- teacher relationship gradually changed to one of jealous rivals. Cobb was unpopular with his teammates, and as he became the biggest star in baseball, Crawford was unhappy with the preferential treatment given Cobb. Cobb was allowed to report late for spring training and given private quarters on the road ‚Äì privileges not offered to Crawford. The competition between the two was intense. Crawford recalled that, if he went three for four on a day when Cobb went hitless, Cobb would turn red and sometimes walk out of the park with the game still on. When it was initially (and erroneously) reported that Nap Lajoie had won the batting title, Crawford was alleged to have been one of several Tigers who sent a telegram to Lajoie congratulating him on beating Cobb. In retirement, Cobb wrote a letter to a writer for The Sporting News accusing Crawford of not helping in the outfield and of intentionally fouling off balls when Cobb was stealing a base. Crawford learned about the letter in 1946 and accused Cobb of being a \\"cheapskate\\" who never helped his teammates. He said that Cobb had not been a very good fielder, \\"so he blamed me.\\" Crawford denied intentionally trying to deprive Cobb of stolen bases, saying that Cobb had \\"dreamed that up.\\"Stump, Cobb, pp. 190‚Äì191 When asked about the feud, Cobb attributed it to jealousy. He felt that Crawford was \\"a hell of a good player\\", but he was \\"second best\\" on the Tigers and \\"hated to be an also ran.\\" Cobb biographer Richard Bak noted that the two \\"only barely tolerated each other\\" and agreed with Cobb that Crawford's attitude was driven by Cobb's having stolen Crawford's thunder.Richard Bak, Peach (2005), p. 38 Although they may not have spoken to each other, Cobb and Crawford developed an uncanny ability to communicate non-verbally with looks and nods on the base paths. They became one of the most successful double steal pairings in baseball history. After Cobb died, a reporter found hundreds of letters in his home responding to letters Cobb had written to influential people, lobbying for Crawford's induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Crawford was reportedly unaware of Cobb's efforts until after Cobb died.Richard Bak, Peach, p. 176 Later baseball career After being released by the Tigers Crawford joined the minor league Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League, helping them to win league championships in 1918 and 1921. In his first game he got two hits, stole a base and threw out two runners in his first game. Crawford played four seasons for the Angels (1918‚Äì1921). In 1918 he played in 96 games, got 104 hits, and batted .292. In 1919 he hit .360 with 239 hits, 41 doubles, 18 triples, 14 home runs and 14 stolen bases in 173 games. (The PCL played an irregular schedule, with substantially more games than the then 154-game Major League season.) In 1920 he batted .332 and had 239 hits, 46 doubles and 21 triples in 187 games. His last year, at 41 years-old in 1921, he hit .316 with 199 hits and 44 doubles in 175 games.Sam Crawford minor league record, baseball-reference.com Crawford decided to stay in Southern California, and in 1924 became the head coach of the University of Southern California (USC) baseball team, a position he held until 1929. He was instrumental in the development of the California Intercollegiate Baseball Association in 1927, and led USC to second-place finishes in his last two seasons. Crawford was 59‚Äì46‚Äì3 as the USC coach. He later worked as an umpire in the Pacific Coast League from 1935 to 1938, quitting after finding it a thankless job and lonely life.Lawrence Ritter, The Glory of Their Times, pp. 55‚Äì56 In 1927, Crawford had a role as the baseball coach in Buster Keaton's comedy film College. Later life In retirement, Crawford became somewhat reclusive, staying away from official baseball functions. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1957. At the time, he was living in a small cabin on the edge of the Mojave Desert near Pearblossom, California. Reporters showed up there with the news, shocking the locals, who were unaware that their neighbor had even played Major League Baseball. After his election, Crawford told the curator in Cooperstown that he wanted his plaque to read \\"Wahoo Sam.\\" He noted: \\"That's my hometown, and I'm proud of it.\\" Crawford spent much of his later years working in his garden and reading. In March 1964, in Baywood Park, California, he was interviewed by Lawrence Ritter for the 1966 book The Glory of Their Times, a series of interviews with the players of the early 20th century. Crawford's tales of teammates such as Cobb and deaf player Dummy Hoy, and opponents such as Honus Wagner, helped to make the book one of the most admired ever written about baseball. During the Ritter interviews, Crawford quoted from the works of philosopher George Santayana and agnostic Robert Ingersoll, and discussed the works of one of his favorite writers, Honor√© de Balzac. As for how he hoped to be remembered, he said: \\"When I kick off they'll say, 'Well, good old Sam, he wasn't such a bad guy after all. Everything considered, he was pretty fair and square. We'll miss him.'\\"Lawrence Ritter, \\"The Glory of Their Times\\" p. 69 Crawford suffered a stroke on May 26, 1968, and died two weeks later at Hollywood Community Hospital in Los Angeles at age 88. He was interred in the Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood. In 1999, Crawford was ranked number 84 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players,100 Greatest Baseball Players by The Sporting News : A Legendary List by Baseball Almanac and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

The company was founded in 1994 by Dr. Michael Doyle and three of his staff members from the UCSF Center for Knowledge Management. While the company has been labeled as a patent trollTimothy B. Lee (2012-02-09), , Ars Technica, retrieved 2012-02-09 by accused infringers of those patents, this narrative has been characterized by recent commentators as political propaganda by big-tech, since Eolas was created at the request of UCSF, and was founded by the inventors on the university's patents., RealClear Politics: Revisiting Big Tech's Patent Troll Boogeyman, retrieved 2020-10-13 In addition to the work done while at UCSF, Dr. Doyle has led work at Eolas to create new technologies ranging from spatial genomics, transient-key cryptography, and blockchain to mobile AI assistants and automated audio conversation annotation. Dr. Doyle's University of California, San Francisco team created an advanced early web browser that supported plugins, streaming media, and cloud computing. They demonstrated it at Xerox PARC, in November 1993, at the second Bay Area SIGWEB meeting. The claim that this was an innovation, advanced to justify their patent application, has been contested by Pei-Yuan Wei, who developed the earlier Viola browser, which added plugin capabilities in 1992, a claim supported by inventor of the WWW Sir Tim Berners-Lee and other Web pioneers. Given only a short time to prepare, Wei was only able to demonstrate Viola's equivalent capabilities for local rather than remote files at the 2003 Eolas v. Microsoft trial, and thus fell short of proving prior art to the trial court's satisfaction. {} The case with Microsoft over patent 5,838,906 was settled in 2007 for a confidential amount of money after an initial $565 million judgment was stayed on appeal, but the University of California disclosed its piece of the final settlement as $30.4 million. In 2009 Eolas sued numerous other companies over patent number 7,599,985 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. As of June 2011, a number of these companies, including Texas Instruments, Oracle and JPMorgan Chase, had signed licensing deals with Eolas, while the company continued to seek licenses from others.Nancy Gohring (June 17, 2011) TI Signs License Deal After Eolas Patent Lawsuit, IDG News In February 2012, an eight-person jury in the Eastern District of Texas invalidated some of the claims in the ‚Äô906 and ‚Äô985 patents, and in July 2012, Judge Leonard Davis ruled against Eolas. One year later, moreover, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sustained that ruling. However, after a new patent covering cloud computing on the Web was granted to Eolas in November of 2015, Eolas filed a new lawsuit against Google, Amazon and Walmart, which is currently underway in the Northern District of California. Products In September 1995, the founders of Eolas released WebRouser, an advanced Web browser based on Mosaic that implemented plugins, client-side image maps, web-page-defined browser buttons and menus, embedded streaming media, and cloud computing capabilities. In 2005, Eolas released 'Muse', a \\"multimedia doodling application,\\" which it later licensed to Iconicast LLC, to use as the basis for an iOS app called 'HueTunes'. The HueTunes app was featured at the DEMO conference in 2013. In 2012, Eolas developed the Einstein Brain Atlas iPad app for the National Museum of Health and Medicine Chicago, which was named the Gizmodo App of the Day. According to the Eolas Web site, their current products include two health-education systems: the AnatLab Visible Human, used to teach gross anatomy to medical students, and AnatLab Histology, an iOS and Android app that provides mobile access to a complete collection of ultra-high-resolution histology microscopic slide images. Patents US patent 5,838,906, titled \\"Distributed hypermedia method for automatically invoking external application providing interaction and display of embedded objects within a hypermedia document,\\" was filed on October 17, 1994 and granted on November 17, 1998. In Autumn 2003, the inventor of the World Wide Web and the Director of the W3C Consortium Tim Berners-Lee wrote to the Under Secretary of Commerce, asking for this patent to be invalidated, in order to \\"eliminate this major impediment to the operation of the Web\\". Leaders of Open Source Community sided with Microsoft in fighting the patent due to its threat to the free nature of the Web and to the basic established HTML standards. The specific concerns of having one company (Eolas) controlling a critical piece of the Web framework were cited. In March 2004, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) re- examined and initially rejected the patent. Eolas submitted a rebuttal in May 2004. On September 27, 2005, the USPTO upheld the validity of the patent. The PTO ruling rejected the relevance of Pei Wei's Viola code to the Eolas patent. According to the University of California press release, \\"In its 'Reasons for Patentability/Confirmation' notice, the patent examiner rejected the arguments for voiding UC's previously approved patent claims for the Web-browser technology as well as the evidence presented to suggest that the technology had been developed prior to the UC innovation. The examiner considered the Viola reference the primary reference asserted by Microsoft at trial as a prior art publication and found that Viola does 'not teach nor fairly suggest that instant 906 invention, as claimed.'\\" Eolas was granted a second patent in October 2009 related to the same technology. After considering the evidence asserted at the 2012 trial, including Viola, the US Patent Office granted Eolas a new patent in November 2015 with claims which generally cover cloud computing on the Web. Litigation Microsoft declined to license the technology when it was offered to them (and others) in 1994. In 1999, Eolas filed suit in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Microsoft over validity and use of the patent. Eolas won the initial case in August 2003 and was awarded damages of $ from Microsoft for infringement. The District Court reaffirmed the jury's decision in January 2004. In June 2004, Microsoft appealed the case to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2005, the District Court judgment was remanded, but the infringement and damages parts of the case were upheld. The appeals court ruled that the two Viola-related exhibits that had been thrown out of the original trial needed to be shown to a jury in a retrial. Microsoft quickly filed for a rehearing. In October 2005, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to hear Microsoft's appeal, leaving intact the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in favor of Eolas with respect to foreign sales of Microsoft Windows. However, the remand to District Court had not been heard yet. In May 2007, the USPTO agreed to allow Microsoft to argue ownership of the patent after they reissued a Microsoft patent that covers the same concepts as outlined in the Eolas patent, and contains wording that mirrors the Eolas patent. The USPTO ruled in favor of Eolas on that matter in September 2007. Microsoft and Eolas agreed in July 2007 to delay a pending re- trial, in order to negotiate a settlement. On August 27, 2007, Eolas reported to its shareholders that a settlement had been reached and that Eolas expected to pay a substantial dividend as a result; the exact amount and terms of the settlement were not disclosed. In October 2009, Eolas sued a number of large corporations for infringement of the same patent. The 22 sued corporations include Adobe, Amazon.com, Apple, Argosy Publishing, Blockbuster, CDW Corp., Citigroup, eBay, Frito-Lay, The Go Daddy Group, Google, J.C. Penney Co. Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., New Frontier Media Inc., Office Depot Inc., Perot Systems Corp., Playboy Enterprises International Inc., Rent-A-Center Inc., Staples Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc., Texas Instruments Inc., Yahoo! Inc., and YouTube LLC. Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, writing in Computerworld's opinion section, called Eolas a patent troll after these lawsuits were initiated. As of June 2011, a number of these companies, including Texas Instruments, Oracle and JPMorgan Chase have signed licensing deals with Eolas, while others are still litigating. In February 2012, a Texas jury found that some of the claims in two of Eolas' patents were invalid after testimony from several defendants including Tim Berners-Lee and Pei-Yuan Wei, credited as creator of the Viola browser. The testimony professed that the Viola browser included Eolas' claimed inventions before the filing date (September 7, 1993). There is \\"substantial evidence that Viola was publicly known and used\\" before the plaintiffs' alleged conception date, it added. The ruling effectively ended a pending lawsuit against Yahoo, Google, Amazon and JC Penney. In July 23, 2013, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which has nationwide jurisdiction, affirmed a Texas federal court which had ruled in July 2012 that several claims relating to the two patents in the suit were invalid, a ruling which Eolas had appealed. After the US Patent Office considered the evidence asserted at the 2012 trial, including Viola, it granted Eolas a new patent in November 2015 with claims which generally cover cloud computing on the Web. Eolas then filed a new lawsuit against Google, Amazon and Walmart, which is currently underway in the Northern District of California.  Effects on other browsers  In February 2006, Microsoft modified its Internet Explorer web browser to attempt to side-step the Eolas patent. The change, first discussed in 2003, requires users to click once on an ActiveX control to \\"activate\\" it before they can use its interface. The specific message is \\"Click to activate this control\\", shown as a tooltip when the cursor is held over the embedded object. However, following a November 2007 announcement that Microsoft had \\"licensed the technologies from Eolas\\", in April 2008, Microsoft released an update which removed the click-to-activate functionality, reverting the software to its original design. In June 2006, Opera Software released version 9 of its Opera browser for Windows and other operating systems, with modifications similar to Microsoft's. Doyle has stated that Eolas would offer royalty-free licenses to non-commercial entities. A statement on Eolas' web site clarifies the company's policy with regard to such licenses. , Mozilla Foundation which develops the open-source Mozilla Firefox browser, has not announced that it has requested any license to the Eolas patents. = Proposed Workarounds = Before some claims in the company's patents were invalidated in 2012, one proposed workaround was to dynamically create the HTML element containing the plug-in using JavaScript, rather than embedding it on the page. In this situation, Internet Explorer did not ask the user for an \\"activation\\" click because of the infringers' argument that the patent did not cover embedded scripting. Opera users could use User JavaScript functionality in the browser to attempt to work around this issue in a similar way with locally modified JavaScript.

Brown (1968). \\"Delphi Process: A Methodology Used for the Elicitation of Opinions of Experts.\\": An earlier paper published by RAND (Document No: P-3925, 1968, 15 pages)Sackman, H. (1974), \\"Delphi Assessment: Expert Opinion, Forecasting and Group Process\\", R-1283-PR, April 1974. Brown, Thomas, \\"An Experiment in Probabilistic Forecasting\\", R-944-ARPA, 1972 The technique can also be adapted for use in face-to-face meetings, and is then called mini-Delphi or Estimate-Talk-Estimate (ETE). Delphi has been widely used for business forecasting and has certain advantages over another structured forecasting approach, prediction markets. Delphi is based on the principle that forecasts (or decisions) from a structured group of individuals are more accurate than those from unstructured groups.Rowe and Wright (2001): Expert Opinions in Forecasting. Role of the Delphi Technique. In: Armstrong (Ed.): Principles of Forecasting: A Handbook of Researchers and Practitioners, Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers. The experts answer questionnaires in two or more rounds. After each round, a facilitator or change agent provides an anonymised summary of the experts' forecasts from the previous round as well as the reasons they provided for their judgments. Thus, experts are encouraged to revise their earlier answers in light of the replies of other members of their panel. It is believed that during this process the range of the answers will decrease and the group will converge towards the \\"correct\\" answer. Finally, the process is stopped after a predefined stop criterion (e.g., number of rounds, achievement of consensus, stability of results), and the mean or median scores of the final rounds determine the results.Rowe and Wright (1999): The Delphi technique as a forecasting tool: issues and analysis. International Journal of Forecasting, Volume 15, Issue 4, October 1999. History The name Delphi derives from the Oracle of Delphi, although the authors of the method were unhappy with the oracular connotation of the name, \\"smacking a little of the occult\\".Adler, Michael & Erio Ziglio (1996) Gazing Into the Oracle: The Delphi Method and Its Application to Social Policy and Public Health, (Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 1996). () The Delphi method assumes that group judgments are more valid than individual judgments. The Delphi method was developed at the beginning of the Cold War to forecast the impact of technology on warfare.\\"JVTE v15n2: The Modified Delphi Technique - A Rotational Modification,\\" Journal of Vocational and Technical Education, Volume 15 Number 2, Spring 1999, web: VT-edu-JVTE-v15n2: of Delphi Technique developed by Olaf Helmer and Norman Dalkey. In 1944, General Henry H. Arnold ordered the creation of the report for the U.S. Army Air Corps on the future technological capabilities that might be used by the military. Different approaches were tried, but the shortcomings of traditional forecasting methods, such as theoretical approach, quantitative models or trend extrapolation, quickly became apparent in areas where precise scientific laws have not been established yet. To combat these shortcomings, the Delphi method was developed by Project RAND during the 1950-1960s (1959) by Olaf Helmer, Norman Dalkey, and Nicholas Rescher.Rescher(1998): Predicting the Future, (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1998). (, , ) It has been used ever since, together with various modifications and reformulations, such as the Imen-Delphi procedure.Passig, David (1997) \\"Imen Delphi: A Delphi Variant Procedure for Emergence\\". Human Organization: Journal of the Society for Applied Anthropology, Southern Methodist University. Dallas, TX. Spring, 56(1), 53-63 Experts were asked to give their opinion on the probability, frequency, and intensity of possible enemy attacks. Other experts could anonymously give feedback. This process was repeated several times until a consensus emerged. Key characteristics The Delphi Method communication structure The following key characteristics of the Delphi method help the participants to focus on the issues at hand and separate Delphi from other methodologies: in this technique a panel of experts is drawn from both inside and outside the organisation. The panel consists of experts having knowledge of the area requiring decision making. Each expert is asked to make anonymous predictions. =Anonymity of the participants= Usually all participants remain anonymous. Their identity is not revealed, even after the completion of the final report. This prevents the authority, personality, or reputation of some participants from dominating others in the process. Arguably, it also frees participants (to some extent) from their personal biases, minimizes the \\"bandwagon effect\\" or \\"halo effect\\", allows free expression of opinions, encourages open critique, and facilitates admission of errors when revising earlier judgments. = Structuring of information flow = The initial contributions from the experts are collected in the form of answers to questionnaires and their comments to these answers. The panel director controls the interactions among the participants by processing the information and filtering out irrelevant content. This avoids the negative effects of face-to-face panel discussions and solves the usual problems of group dynamics. =Regular feedback= The Delphi Method allows participants to comment on the responses of others, the progress of the panel as a whole, and to revise their own forecasts and opinions in real time. =Role of the facilitator= The person coordinating the Delphi method is usually known as a facilitator or Leader, and facilitates the responses of their panel of experts, who are selected for a reason, usually that they hold knowledge on an opinion or view. The facilitator sends out questionnaires, surveys etc. and if the panel of experts accept, they follow instructions and present their views. Responses are collected and analyzed, then common and conflicting viewpoints are identified. If consensus is not reached, the process continues through thesis and antithesis, to gradually work towards synthesis, and building consensus. During the past decades, facilitators have used many different measures and thresholds to measure the degree of consensus or dissent. A comprehensive literature review and summary is compiled in an article by von der Gracht. Applications =Use in forecasting= First applications of the Delphi method were in the field of science and technology forecasting. The objective of the method was to combine expert opinions on likelihood and expected development time, of the particular technology, in a single indicator. One of the first such reports, prepared in 1964 by Gordon and Helmer, assessed the direction of long-term trends in science and technology development, covering such topics as scientific breakthroughs, population control, automation, space progress, war prevention and weapon systems. Other forecasts of technology were dealing with vehicle-highway systems, industrial robots, intelligent internet, broadband connections, and technology in education. Later the Delphi method was applied in other places, especially those related to public policy issues, such as economic trends, health and education. It was also applied successfully and with high accuracy in business forecasting. For example, in one case reported by Basu and Schroeder (1977), the Delphi method predicted the sales of a new product during the first two years with inaccuracy of 3‚Äì4% compared with actual sales. Quantitative methods produced errors of 10‚Äì15%, and traditional unstructured forecast methods had errors of about 20%. (This is only one example; the overall accuracy of the technique is mixed.) The Delphi method has also been used as a tool to implement multi-stakeholder approaches for participative policy-making in developing countries. The governments of Latin America and the Caribbean have successfully used the Delphi method as an open-ended public-private sector approach to identify the most urgent challenges for their regional ICT-for- development eLAC Action Plans. As a result, governments have widely acknowledged the value of collective intelligence from civil society, academic and private sector participants of the Delphi, especially in a field of rapid change, such as technology policies. = Use in patent participation identification = In the early 1980s Jackie Awerman of Jackie Awerman Associates, Inc. designed a modified Delphi method for identifying the roles of various contributors to the creation of a patent-eligible product. (Epsilon Corporation, Chemical Vapor Deposition Reactor) The results were then used by patent attorneys to determine bonus distribution percentage to the general satisfaction of all team members. =Use in policy-making= From the 1970s, the use of the Delphi technique in public policy-making introduces a number of methodological innovations. In particular: * the need to examine several types of items (not only forecasting items but, typically, issue items, goal items, and option items) leads to introducing different evaluation scales which are not used in the standard Delphi. These often include desirability, feasibility (technical and political) and probability, which the analysts can use to outline different scenarios: the desired scenario (from desirability), the potential scenario (from feasibility) and the expected scenario (from probability); * the complexity of issues posed in public policy-making tends to increased weighting of panelists‚Äô arguments, such often solicited pro and con each item along with new items for panel consideration; * likewise, methods measuring panel evaluations tend to increased sophistication such as multi-dimensional scaling. Further innovations come from the use of computer- based (and later web-based) Delphi conferences. According to Turoff and Hiltz,Murray Turoff, Starr Roxanne Hiltz, \\"Computer-based Delphi processes\\", in Michael Adler, Erio Ziglio (eds.), Gazing Into the Oracle, op. cit. in computer-based Delphis: * the iteration structure used in the paper Delphis, which is divided into three or more discrete rounds, can be replaced by a process of continuous (roundless) interaction, enabling panelists to change their evaluations at any time; * the statistical group response can be updated in real-time, and shown whenever a panelist provides a new evaluation. According to Bolognini,. A summary is also in , chap. 23. web-based Delphis offer two further possibilities, relevant in the context of interactive policy-making and e-democracy. These are: A web-based communication structure (Hyperdelphi). * the involvement of a large number of participants, * the use of two or more panels representing different groups (such as policy-makers, experts, citizens), which the administrator can give tasks reflecting their diverse roles and expertise, and make them to interact within ad hoc communication structures. For example, the policy community members (policy- makers and experts) may interact as part of the main conference panel, while they receive inputs from a virtual community (citizens, associations etc.) involved in a side conference. These web-based variable communication structures, which he calls Hyperdelphi (HD), are designed to make Delphi conferences \\"more fluid and adapted to the hypertextual and interactive nature of digital communication\\". One successful example of a (partially) web-based policy Delphi is the five-round Delphi exercise (with 1,454 contributions) for the creation of the eLAC Action Plans in Latin America. It is believed to be the most extensive online participatory policy-making foresight exercise in the history of intergovernmental processes in the developing world at this time. In addition to the specific policy guidance provided, the authors list the following lessons learned include \\"(1) the potential of Policy Delphi methods to introduce transparency and accountability into public decision- making, especially in developing countries; (2) the utility of foresight exercises to foster multi-agency networking in the development community; (3) the usefulness of embedding foresight exercises into established mechanisms of representative democracy and international multilateralism, such as the United Nations; (4) the potential of online tools to facilitate participation in resource-scarce developing countries; and (5) the resource-efficiency stemming from the scale of international foresight exercises, and therefore its adequacy for resource-scarce regions.\\" =Use in reporting guidelines= The guidance for developing reporting guidelines in 2010 recommended using the Delphi method for developing reporting guidelines. However, less than 30% of the reporting guidelines were developed with the Delphi method according to the systematic reviews in 2015 and 2020. The Delphi approach has been successfully employed to improve agreement between experts in iterative rating exercises on clinical test results using inter-rater kappa statistics as an outcome measure. = Online Delphi systems = A number of Delphi forecasts are conducted using web sites that allow the process to be conducted in real- time. For instance, the TechCast Project uses a panel of 100 experts worldwide to forecast breakthroughs in all fields of science and technology. Another example is the Horizon Project, where educational futurists collaborate online using the Delphi method to come up with the technological advancements to look out for in education for the next few years. Variations Traditionally the Delphi method has aimed at a consensus of the most probable future by iteration. Other versions, such as the Policy Delphi, is instead a decision support method aiming at structuring and discussing the diverse views of the preferred future. In Europe, more recent web-based experiments have used the Delphi method as a communication technique for interactive decision-making and e-democracy.. An example of e-democracy application is DEMOS (Delphi Mediation Online System), whose prototype was presented at the 3rd Worldwide Forum on Electronic Democracy, in 2002. The Argument Delphi, developed by Osmo Kuusi, focuses on ongoing discussion and finding relevant arguments rather than focusing on the output. The Disaggregative Policy Delphi, developed by Petri Tapio, uses cluster analysis as a systematic tool to construct various scenarios of the future in the latest Delphi round. The respondent's view on the probable and the preferable future are dealt with as separate cases. The computerization of Argument Delphi is relatively difficult because of several problems like argument resolution, argument aggregation and argument evaluation. The computerization of Argument Delphi, developed by Sadi Evren Seker, proposes solutions to such problems. Accuracy Today the Delphi method is a widely accepted forecasting tool and has been used successfully for thousands of studies in areas varying from technology forecasting to drug abuse.The Delphi Method:Techniques and Applications,Harold A. Linstone and Murray Turoff, Editors ¬© 2002, Murray Turoff and Harold Linstone, TOC III.B.3. The National Drug-Abuse Policy Delphi: Progress Report and Findings to Date, IRENE ANNE JILLSON {http://is.njit.edu/pubs/delphibook/ch3b3.html Overall the track record of the Delphi method is mixed. There have been many cases when the method produced poor results. Still, some authors attribute this to poor application of the method and not to the weaknesses of the method itself. It must also be realized that in areas such as science and technology forecasting, the degree of uncertainty is so great that exact and always correct predictions are impossible, so a high degree of error is to be expected. A particular weakness of the Delphi method is that future developments are not always predicted correctly by consensus of experts. This shortcoming concerning the issue of ignorance is important. If panelists are misinformed about a topic, the use of Delphi may only add confidence to their ignorance.Green, K. C., Armstrong, J. S., & Graefe, A. (2007). Methods to elicit forecasts from groups: Delphi and prediction markets compared. Foresight: The International Journal of Applied Forecasting, 8, 17‚Äì20. One of the initial problems of the method was its inability to make complex forecasts with multiple factors. Potential future outcomes were usually considered as if they had no effect on each other. Later on, several extensions to the Delphi method were developed to address this problem, such as cross impact analysis, that takes into consideration the possibility that the occurrence of one event may change probabilities of other events covered in the survey. Still the Delphi method can be used most successfully in forecasting single scalar indicators. =Delphi vs. prediction markets= Delphi has characteristics similar to prediction markets as both are structured approaches that aggregate diverse opinions from groups. Yet, there are differences that may be decisive for their relative applicability for different problems.Green, Armstrong, and Graefe (2007): Methods to Elicit Forecasts from Groups: Delphi and Prediction Markets Compared. Foresight: The International Journal of Applied Forecasting (Fall 2007). PDF format Some advantages of prediction markets derive from the possibility to provide incentives for participation. # They can motivate people to participate over a long period of time and to reveal their true beliefs. # They aggregate information automatically and instantly incorporate new information in the forecast. # Participants do not have to be selected and recruited manually by a facilitator. They themselves decide whether to participate if they think their private information is not yet incorporated in the forecast. Delphi seems to have these advantages over prediction markets: # Participants reveal their reasoning # It is easier to maintain confidentiality # Potentially quicker forecasts if experts are readily available. # Delphi is applicable in situations where the bets involved might affect the value of the currency used in bets (e.g. a bet on the collapse of the dollar made in dollars might have distorted odds). More recent research has also focused on combining both, the Delphi technique and prediction markets. More specifically, in a research study at Deutsche B√∂rse elements of the Delphi method had been integrated into a prediction market.

During the siege, Savicheva recorded the successive deaths of each member of her family in her diary, with her final entry indicating her belief to be the sole living family member. Although Savicheva was rescued and transferred to a hospital, she succumbed to intestinal tuberculosis in July 1944 at age 14. Savicheva's image and the pages from her diary became symbolic of the human cost of the Siege of Leningrad and she is remembered in St. Petersburg with a memorial complex on the Green Belt of Glory along the Road of Life. Her diary was used during the Nuremberg Trials as the evidence of the Nazis‚Äô crimes.https://russiapedia.rt.com/prominent-russians/history-and- mythology/tanya-savicheva/ Early life Savicheva was born on 23 January 1930, the youngest child in the family of a baker father, Nikolay Rodionovich Savichev, and a seamstress mother, Mariya Ignatievna Savicheva. Her father died when Tanya was six, leaving his widow with five children: three girls ‚Äî Tanya, Zhenya (Yevgenia) and Nina ‚Äî and two boys ‚Äî Mikhail and Leka (Leonid). Mikhail had left Leningrad before war broke out. Whilst in German-occupied territory at Kingisepp Mikhail had joined the partisans. Mikhail's story was not known to the rest of his family who presumed him to be dead. The family planned to spend the summer of 1941 in the countryside, but the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June disrupted their plans. All, except Mikhail (Misha), who had already left, decided to stay in Leningrad. Each of them worked to support the army: Mariya Ignatievna sewed uniforms, Leka worked as a plane operator in the Admiralty, Zhenya worked at the munitions factory, Nina helped in the construction of city defences and worked at the munitions factory with her sister, and her uncles Vasya and Lesha served in the anti- aircraft defence. Tanya, then 11 years old, dug trenches and put out firebombs. One day Nina went to work and never came back; she was sent to Lake Ladoga and then urgently evacuated. The family was unaware of this and presumed she had died. Origins of the diary Tanya had kept a real diary in previous months. This diary had been a large, thick notebook in which she recorded her day-to-day life, but the family had decided to burn it at some point early on in the siege when there was no fuel left to heat the stove. Some time after the burning of her diary Savicheva was given a small notebook that had belonged to her sister, Nina, which would later become her diary. The smaller notebook had been spared the fire and Nina had used it to make notes about the boiler equipment in the plant where she worked. Nina had not used the alphabetised portion of the notebook. Tanya wrote her first entry in the diary on or shortly after 28 December. This first entry concerned the death of her elder sister, Zhenya, which most likely occurred due to severe malnutrition exacerbated by her work at the munitions factory. Zhenya was born in 1909 and had left the family home when she married and had moved to Mokhovaya Street, where she continued to live after her divorce. Zhenya would regularly walk 7 kilometers to the factory where she worked sometimes two shifts a day making mine cases. After work she would donate blood. At this point during the siege of Leningrad food rationing had been reduced to starvation level, and only small but inadequate supplies were coming into Leningrad across Lake Ladoga along the Road of Life. It is estimated 100,000 people per month were dying from starvation, rations for an adult having been set at 250g of rye bread or half that for children and the elderly. Her weakened body was not strong enough to stand the blood donations and she died in her apartment, from complications resulting from exhaustion and malnutrition, in the arms of her sister Nina who had been worried when she had not turned up for her shift at the factory and had hurried round to Mokhovaya Street to check on her. Deaths Savicheva began to record the deaths of each family member in Tanya's half empty work notebook. Each page had a letter heading; Savicheva chose the page headed by Russian letter –∂ and recorded the death of her sister with the following statement written probably in blue pencil, in large handwriting which filled the page, \\"Zhenya died on December 28th at 12 noon, 1941.\\" From here on, most of Tanya's family also died in quick succession. Her grandmother, Yevdokiya Grigorievna, died a month later, two days after Savicheva's twelfth birthday, of heart failure, having lost a third of her body weight. Yevdokiya Grigorievna refused to go to hospital as she felt the hospitals were overrun enough already. She was buried in a mass grave in what is today's Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery where there is a memorial complex to the victims of the siege. Savicheva recorded her death under the page heading for the letter –ë with the words, \\"Grandma died on the 25th of January at 3 o'clock, 1942.\\" Tanya later admitted that at the behest of their grandmother they postponed the burial and kept grandmother's ration card until the end of the month, thus the official date of her death was recorded as February 1, 1942. On 28 February Nina disappeared. On the day of her disappearance Leningrad had come under heavy artillery fire and the remaining family presumed her to be dead. In fact Nina Savicheva had been evacuated without warning across Lake Ladoga on the dangerous Road of Life ice route. Nina had no opportunity to send word to any of her relatives, the ice route being reserved only for essential food, fuel, medicine and evacuation purposes. She remained ill for several months and was not able to return to Leningrad to find out what had happened to her family until 1945. Savicheva made no reference to Nina in the notebook. It was Nina who eventually found the diary on returning to Leningrad. Grandmother's death was followed by Savicheva's brother Leka in March 1942. He had tried earlier in the war to enlist in the military but had been turned down because of nearsightedness. Leka had become a promising engineer, and was also a talented musician. He worked long shifts at the Admiralty Shipyard, often working a second shift into the night. He died in the shipyard's hospital on March 17, Savicheva hurriedly recording this in her diary under the letter –õ, \\"Leka died March 17th, 1942, at 5 o'clock in the morning, 1942.\\" On April 13, Uncle Vasya (one of her father's brothers) died at the age of 56. Before the war three of Savicheva's uncles lived together in a nearby apartment but when the siege began the family moved in together. Uncle Vasya had served in the First World War but had been refused this time around on account of his age. Vasya and Tanya were said to be very close and Tanya spent many hours in Vasya's apartment which was filled with books. Savicheva recorded his death under the letter –≤, mixing up some of her grammar, with the words, \\"Uncle Vasya died on April 13th at 2 o'clock in the morning, 1942.\\" The death of her eldest uncle Lesha followed in May at the age of 71 from malnutrition. He too had tried to enlist in the military but was refused, being too old. Despite his age he remained active in the civilian effort in Leningrad. Savicheva recorded his death on the facing page of the letter –õ and missed off the word 'died'. \\"Uncle Lesha May 10th, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, 1942\\" Finally her mother died on the morning of May 13, 1942. Mariya Ignatievna Savicheva was born in 1889 and worked as a seamstress, which she continued during the civilian war effort by sewing soldiers' uniforms. Mariya had loved music and encouraged all her children to play in a family ensemble. Savicheva recorded her death under the letter –ú, again making grammatical errors and missing the word 'died', \\"Mama on May 13th at 7:30 in the morning, 1942.\\" Following the death of her mother it seems Savicheva lost hope and under three more letters: –°, –£ and –û she filled three more pages with the words, \\"The Savichevs are dead.\\" \\"Everyone is dead.\\" \\"Only Tanya is left.\\" After her rescue After the death of her mother, Savicheva stayed with a neighbour the next night and then, although severely weak, took the family personal belongings to the house of her aunt Evdokiya (Dusya). Her aunt, hoping Savicheva might receive urgent medical care, then transferred custody of Savicheva to public orphanage number 48 in the Smolny area of St. Petersburg. In August 1942, Tanya was one of the 140 children who were rescued from Leningrad and brought to the village of Krasny Bor. Anastasiya Karpova, a teacher in the Krasny Bor orphanage, wrote to Tanya's brother Mikhail, who happened to be outside of Leningrad in 1941: \\"Tanya is now alive, but she doesn't look healthy. A doctor, who visited her recently, says she is very ill. She needs rest, special care, nutrition, better climate and, most of all, tender motherly care.\\" In May 1944, Tanya was sent to a hospital in Shatki, where she died a month later, on 1 July, of intestinal tuberculosis. Nina Savicheva and Mikhail Savichev returned to Leningrad after World War II. Mikhail had continued fighting until 1944, sustaining injuries which led to him being discharged and transported back to Leningrad. Tanya's diary is now displayed at the Museum of Leningrad History, with a copy also on display at the Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery.encspb.ru The diary is on display in St. Petersburg, in the Museum of Leningrad History According to several sources, one of the documents presented by the Allied prosecutors during the Nuremberg Trials was the small notebook that once belonged to Tanya.

The Manual was prepared and published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  Contents  The Frascati Manual classifies budgets according to what is done, what is studied, and who is studying it. For example, an oral history project conducted by a religious organization would be classified as being basic research, in the field of humanities (the sub-category of history), and performed by a non-governmental, non-profit organization. = Three forms of research = The manual gives definitions for: basic research, applied research, Research and development; research personnel: researchers, technicians, auxiliary personnel. The Frascati Manual classifies research into three categories:Frascati Manual 2015: Guidelines for Collecting and Reporting Data on Research and Experimental Development p. 29 * Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge about observable phenomena and facts, not directed toward any particular use. * Applied research is original investigation to acquire new knowledge directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective. * Experimental development is systematic effort, based on existing knowledge from research or practical experience, directed toward creating novel or improved materials, products, devices, processes, systems, or services. These involve novelty, creativity, uncertainty, systematic, and reproducibility and transferability. =Research areas= It also organizes the fields of scholarly research endeavors, from mathematics to literature, into main and sub-categories. The 2002 Frascati Manual included a 'Field of Science' (FOS) classification. After several reviews, a Revised Fields of Science and Technology (FOS) classification was published in February 2007 consisting of the following high-level groupings:Revised Field of Science and Technology (FOS) Classification in the Frascati Manual, OECD # Natural sciences # Engineering and technology # Medical and Health sciences # Agricultural sciences # Social sciences # Humanities = Industry sectors = The Frascati Manual deals primarily with measuring the expenditure and personnel resources devoted to R&D; in the industry sectors performing it: higher education, government, business, and private non-profit organisations.  History  In June 1963, OECD experts met with the NESTI group (National Experts on Science and Technology Indicators) at the Villa Falconieri in Frascati, Italy. Based on a background document by Christopher Freeman they drafted the first version of Frascati Manual, which is officially known as The Proposed Standard Practice for Surveys of Research and Experimental Development. In 2002 the 6th edition was published.  Use  The definitions provided in the Frascati Manual have been adopted by many governments and serve as a common language for discussions of science and technology policy and economic development policy. Originally an OECD standard, it has become an acknowledged standard in R&D; studies all over the world and is widely used by various organisations associated with the United Nations and European Union. As of 2000, approximately 75% of countries used this method to share information about their budgets. Over the past 40 years, the NESTI group has developed a series of documents, known as the \\"Frascati Family\\", that includes manuals on R&D; (Frascati Manual), innovation (Oslo Manual), human resources (Canberra Manual), technology, balance of payments, and patents as indicators of science and technology.

Prior to Indian Independence, Kolhapur was a nineteen gun salute, princely state known as Kolhapur State and was ruled by the Bhosale Chhatrapati (Bhosale royal clan) of the Maratha Empire. History Mahalakshmi, Hindu goddess =Scriptural records= Kolhapur is mentioned in the Devi Gita, the final and key chapter of the Devi-Bhagavata Purana, a special text of Shaktism. Kolhapur is noted as a place of Kollamma worship. In the text, Devi says, :\\"O King of Mountains! Still I am now telling something out of My affection to My Bhaktas. Hear. There is a great place of pilgrimage named Kollapura in the southern country. Here the Devi Ambabai always dwells.\\"Chatterji H. P. \\"Devi Gita, the vow and the sacred places of the Devi.\\" The Devi Gita (Song of the Goddess), excerpt from Srimad Devi Bhagawatam, translated by the Vijnanananda (Hari Prasanna Chatterji), 1921, chapter 38 verse 3 - 10. \\"O King of Mountains! Still I am now telling something out of My affection to My Bhaktas. Hear. There is a great place of pilgrimage named Kolhapura in the southern country. Here the Devi Ambabai always dwells. The second place is Mahur, MaharashtraMatripura in the Sahyadri mountain; here the Devi Renuka dwells.\\" :The famous Jyotiba temple is also located in the Kolhapur. Kolhapur is famous in west Maharashtra for religious accounts. =Medieval era= The Shilahara family at Kolhapur was the latest of the three and was founded about the time of the downfall of the Rashtrakuta Empire. They ruled over southern Maharashtra; the modern districts of Satara, Kolhapur and Belagav (Karnataka) . Their family deity was the goddess Ambabai, whose blessing they claimed to have secured in their copperplate grants (Mahalakshmi-labdha-vara-prasada). Like their relatives of the northern branch of Konkan, the Shilaharas of Kolhapur claimed to be of the lineage of the Vidyadhara Jimutavahana. They carried the banner of golden Garuda. One of the many titles used by the Shilaharas was Tagarapuravaradhisvara, supreme sovereign ruler of Tagara. The first capital of the Shilaharas was probably at Karad during the reign of Jatiga-II as known from their copper plate grant of Miraj and 'Vikramankadevacharita' of Bilhana. Hence sometimes they are referred as 'Shilaharas of Karad'. Later, although the capital was shifted to Kolhapur, some of their grants mention Valavada, and the hill fort of Pranalaka or Padmanala,(Panhala) as the places of royal residence. Even though the capital was shifted to Kolhapur, Karhad retained its significance during the Shilahara period. This branch rose to power the latter part of the Rashtrakuta rule and so, unlike the kings of the other two branches, those of this branch do not mention the genealogy of the Rashtrakutas even in their early grants. Later they acknowledged the suzerainty of the later Chalukya for some time. They had used Kannada as the official language as can seen from their inscriptions. This branch continued to hold the Southern Maharashtra from circa 940 to 1220. From 940 to 1212 CE, Kolhapur was the centre of power of the Shilahara dynasty.Bhavan B. V. \\"Temples and legends of Maharashtra.\\" 1962 volume 97. An inscription at Teradal states that the king Gonka (1020 - 1050 CE) was bitten by a snake then healed by a Jain monk. Gonka then built a temple to Lord Neminath, the twenty- second Jain tirthankara (enlightened being). Jain temples in and around Kolhapur from this era are called Gonka-Jinalya, after the king. Around 1055 CE, during the reign of Bhoja I (Shilahara dynasty), a dynamic Acharya (spiritual guide) named Maghanandi (Kolapuriya), founded a religious institute at the Rupanarayana Jain temple (basadi). Maghanandi is also known as Siddhanta-chakravarti, that is, the great master of the scriptures. Kings and nobles of the Shilahara dynasty such as Gandaraditya I who succeeded Bhoja I, were disciples of Maghanandi. Kolhapur was the site of intense confrontation between rulers of the Western Chalukya Empire and the rulers of the Chola empire, Rajadhiraja Chola and his younger brother Rajendra Chola II. In 1052 CE, following the Battle of Koppam, the victor, Rajendra Chola II, marched on to Kolhapur and there he erected a jayastambha (victory pillar). Sastri K. A. N. \\"The C≈çƒªas.\\" 1935 p256 - 257 (University of Madras, 2000). Between 1109 and 1178 CE, the Kopeshwar temple to Lord Shiva was built by the Shilahara kings, Gandaraditya Chola, Vijayaditya and Bhoja II in Khidrapur, Kolhapur. =Kolhapur State= Maharajah of Kolhapur The state of Kolhapur was established by Tarabai in 1707 because of the succession dispute over the Maratha kingship. The Maratha throne was then governed by descendants of Tarabai. One of the prominent Kings was Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj (Shahu of Kolhapur). In his reign he promoted cost free education to people of all castes and fought against untouchability. The state was annexed by the British in the 19th century. After India's independence in 1947, the Maharaja of Kolhapur acceded to the Dominion of India on 14 August 1947 and merged with Bombay State on 1 March 1949. Kolhapur is sometimes found spelled as Colapore. Often, Kolhapur is also referred as Dakshin Kashi (Dakshin in Marathi/Hindi/Sanskrit means South, Kashi is a holy city in Northern India) due to its rich religious history. = Origin of name = According to the myth, Kolhapur (‡§ï‡•ã‡§≤‡•ç‡§π‡§æ‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞) was named after the demon Kolhasur. There are different stories behind the reason he was killed by the Goddess, but it was his dying wish to name the place where he was killed after him. Thus, Kolhapur comes from the name Kolhasur and, Pur which means a city.

Beverly Oliver's claim In 1970, a woman named Beverly Oliver told conspiracy researcher Gary Shaw at a church revival meeting in Joshua, Texas, that she was the Babushka Lady. Oliver stated that she filmed the assassination with a Super 8 film Yashica and that she turned the undeveloped film over to two men who identified themselves to her as FBI agents. According to Oliver, she obtained no receipt from the men who told her that they would return the film to her within ten days. She did not follow up with an inquiry. She reiterated her claims in the 1988 documentary The Men Who Killed Kennedy. According to Vincent Bugliosi, Oliver \\"has never proved to most people's satisfaction that she was in Dealey Plaza that day.\\" Confronted with the fact that the Yashica Super-8 camera was not made until 1969, she stated that she received the \\"experimental\\" camera from a friend and was not even sure the manufacturer's name was on it. Beverly Oliver's claims were the basis for a scene in Oliver Stone's 1991 film JFK, in which a character named \\"Beverly\\" meets Jim Garrison in a Dallas nightclub. Played by Lolita Davidovich, she is depicted in the director's cut as wearing a headscarf at Dealey Plaza and speaking of having given the film she shot to two men claiming to be FBI agents. House Select Committee on Assassinations report In March 1979, the Photographic Evidence Panel of the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations indicated that they were unable to locate any film attributed to the Babushka Lady. According to their report: \\"Initially, Robert Groden, a photographic consultant to the committee advised the panel as to pertinent photographic issues and related materials. Committee investigators located many of the suggested films and photographs, however, some items were never located, i.e. the Babushka Lady film, a color photograph by Norman Similas, and the original negative of the Betzner photograph.\\" Public hearings of the Assassination Records Review Board On November 18, 1994, assassination researcher Gary Mack testified before the Assassination Records Review Board that he had recently been told by an executive in Kodak's Dallas office that a woman in her early 30s with brunette hair brought in film purported to be of the assassination scene while they were processing the Zapruder film. According to Mack, the executive said the woman explained to federal investigators already at the film processing office that she ran from Main Street across the grass to Elm Street where she stopped and snapped a photo with some people in the foreground of the presidential limousine and the Texas School Book Depository. Mack said that he was told by the Kodak executive that the photo was extremely blurry and \\"virtually useless\\" and indicated that the woman likely went home without anyone recording her identity. After suggesting that the woman in the story may have been the Babushka Lady, Mack then told the Board: \\"I do not believe that Beverly Oliver is the Babushka Lady, or, let me rephrase that, she certainly could be but the rest of the story is a fabrication.\\" Also appearing that same day before the ARRB as \\"Beverly Oliver Massegee\\", Oliver stated that she was 17 years old at the time of the assassination. She told the Board that she was filming with an \\"experimental\\" 8 mm movie camera approximately from Kennedy when he was shot and that the film was confiscated by a man who identified himself as an FBI agent. According to Oliver, she handed over the camera because the man was an authority figure and because she feared being caught in possession of marijuana.

The theory is based on the assumption that, when searching for information, humans use \\"built-in\\" foraging mechanisms that evolved to help our animal ancestors find food. Importantly, better understanding of human search behavior can improve the usability of websites or any other user interface. History of the theory In the 1970s optimal foraging theory was developed by anthropologists and ecologists to explain how animals hunt for food. It suggested that the eating habits of animals revolve around maximizing energy intake over a given amount of time. For every predator, certain prey are worth pursuing, while others would result in a net loss of energy. In the early 1990s, Peter Pirolli and Stuart Card from PARC noticed the similarities between users' information searching patterns and animal food foraging strategies. Working together with psychologists to analyse users' actions and the information landscape that they navigated (links, descriptions, and other data), they showed that information seekers use the same strategies as food foragers. In the late 1990s, Ed H. Chi worked with Pirolli, Card and others at PARC to further develop information scent ideas and algorithms to actually use these concepts in real interactive systems, including the modeling of web user browsing behavior, the inference of information needs from web visit log files, and the use of information scent concepts in reading and browsing interfaces. Details of the theory \\"Informavores\\" constantly make decisions on what kind of information to look for, whether to stay at the current site to try to find additional information or whether they should move on to another site, which path or link to follow to the next information site, and when to finally stop the search. Although human cognition is not a result of evolutionary pressure to improve Web use, survival-related traits to respond quickly on partial information and reduce energy expenditures force them to optimise their searching behaviour and, simultaneously, to minimize the thinking required. =Information scent= The most important concept in the information foraging theory is information scent. As animals rely on scents to indicate the chances of finding prey in current area and guide them to other promising patches, so do humans rely on various cues in the information environment to get similar answers. Human users estimate how much useful information they are likely to get on a given path, and after seeking information compare the actual outcome with their predictions. When the information scent stops getting stronger (i.e., when users no longer expect to find useful additional information), the users move to a different information source. =Information diet= Some tendencies in the behaviour of web users are easily understood from the information foraging theory standpoint. On the Web, each site is a patch and information is the prey. Leaving a site is easy, but finding good sites has not always been as easy. Advanced search engines have changed this fact by reliably providing relevant links, altering the foraging strategies of the users. When users expect that sites with lots of information are easy to find, they have less incentive to stay in one place. The growing availability of broadband connections may have a similar effect: always-on connections encourage this behavior, short online visits to get specific answers. =Models= Attempts have been made to develop computational cognitive models to characterize information foraging behavior on the Web.

Modeling information navigation: Implications for information architecture. Human Computer Interaction, 19, 225‚Äì271. These models assume that users perceive relevance of information based on some measures of information scent, which are usually derived based on statistical techniques that extract semantic relatedness of words from large text databases. Recently these information foraging models have been extended to explain social information behavior. See also models of collaborative tagging.

It is one of the largest aluminium companies worldwide. It has operations in some 50 countries around the world and is active on all continents. The Norwegian state owns 34.3% of the company through the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries. A further 6.5% is owned by Folketrygdfond, which administers the Government Pension Fund of Norway. Norsk Hydro employs approximately 35,000 people. Hilde Merete Aasheim has been the CEO since May, 2019. Hydro had a significant presence in the oil and gas industry until October 2007, when these operations were merged with Statoil to form StatoilHydro (in 2009 changed back to Statoil, which is now called Equinor). History =First steps with fertilizer= Financed by the Swedish Wallenberg family and French banks, the company was founded on December 2, 1905 as Norsk hydro-elektrisk Kv√¶lstofaktieselskab (lit. Norwegian hydro- electric nitrogen limited) by Sam Eyde, exploiting a novel technology for producing artificial fertilizers by fixing nitrogen from air. The technology had been developed by the Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland. The method is still known as the Birkeland‚ÄìEyde process. The process required large amounts of electric energy, and for this, a power plant was built at the Svelgfossen waterfall near Notodden. Later also Rjukan Falls was developed and its power harnessed, in the process establishing the city of Rjukan, establishing the plant Norsk Hydro Rjukan. Hydro's first factory was built at Notodden (opened in 1907) followed up with another at Rjukan, Tinn (opened in 1911). Then in 1912 production is established at Glomfjord in Nordland. In 1930 Norsk Hydro opened a plant at Her√∏ya outside Porsgrunn. To begin with it was to function as a shipping port for the fertilizer as well as a point to import limestone. From 1936 Hydro also started producing fertilizer at Her√∏ya. There was also opened a railway, Rjukanbanen, connecting Rjukan with H√¶r√∏y. The railway opened in 1909 and consisted of a railway ferry across Lake Tinn, railway again with the Tinnoset Line and a barge ride from Borgestad to Her√∏ya with barge on the Telemark Canal. The canal was superseded by the Bratsberg Line in 1916. By the 1920s, Norsk Hydro's electric arc-based technology for manufacturing artificial fertilizer was no longer able to compete with the newly developed Haber-Bosch process, and in 1927 the company formed a partnership with the German company IG Farben in order to gain access to this process. By 1945, IG Farben had become a majority shareholder in Norsk Hydro. The plant at Her√∏ya was a direct result of no longer being dependent on immediate proximity to the power sources. This provided the advantage of being able to have the plants and the shipping port in the same location, as was the case with the Her√∏ya plant. =Heavy water production at Rjukan= Heavy water sample made by Norsk Hydro The Rjukan plant was the only location in Europe which produced heavy water, a component the Allied powers in World War II feared would be used as part of the German atomic bomb project. At the time, German industrial conglomerate I.G. Farben owned stock in Norsk Hydro, which then produced less than of heavy water per month, and the company was approached to increase its deuterium output to at least 30 gallons per month. Although Hydro's management had previously refused to supply the heavy water, the company relinquished its resistance and agreed to supply 1.5 tons of the material per year upon Norway's surrender to Nazi Germany. Consequently, Norsk Hydro's facilities were the target of several commando and air raids and a sabotage raid which eventually resulted in the plant's destruction and later reconstruction. =First metal production= The first steps towards light metal production came in 1940 when Hydro started construction of a magnesium carbonate plant at Her√∏ya, but the German invasion of Norway stopped the plans. In 1941 the Oslo Consortium (Norwegian: Oslo-konsortiet) invested money equivalent to year 2014 Norwegian kroner 172 million.Nazi-Tysklands venner ‚Äì Mange prominente herrer tjente store penger p√• tysk samarbeid under krigen. Etterp√• gikk de fri, mens ¬´tyskert√∏sene¬ª ble jaget. (Nazi Germany's friends ‚Äì Many prominent gentlemen earned great sums through cooperation with Germans during the war. Afterwards they walked free, while the ¬´tyskert√∏sene¬ª became hunted) (The consortium included Thomas Fearnley, Orkla, Fred Olsen, Storebrand, Jens P. Heyerdahl, Klaveness & Co, Christopher Kahrs Kielland.) Collaboration with the Nazi-German regime, did not result in any company employees being convicted (for collaboration) after the war. During the Second World War Norsk Hydro collaborated with IG Farben and Nordische Aluminium Aktiengesellschaft (Nordag) in building new aluminium and magnesium plants in support of the German war effort. The construction was however ended on July 24, 1943 when an allied bombardment completely destroyed the facilities, killing 55 construction workers. As Germany's defeat became more likely, Norsk Hydro started to tone down its collaborative relations with the occupier. In 1946 the √Ördal aluminium plant was opened, operated by the state owned company √Ördal og Sunndal Verk. In a merger Hydro acquired this company in 1986, in essence establishing the light metal division Hydro Aluminium. Since 1919 there had first been zinc, then aluminium production at Glomfjord in Northern Norway. Hydro bought the power plant in 1947 and started ammonia production there instead. In the 1950s Hydro opened a new magnesium plant in Her√∏ya and in 1963 Hydro started in cooperation with Harvey Aluminum a plant at Karm√∏y to produce aluminium. The plant, called Alnor, was purchased in whole by Hydro in 1973. In 2000, Hydro acquired Wells Aluminum, a network of aluminium extrusion plants in the United States. Two years later, the company acquired the leading German aluminium producer Vereinigte Aluminium Werke from the German utility company E.ON and the French building systems company Technal. Hydro became a truly integrated aluminium company in 2011, when it acquired the aluminium assets owned by Vale in Brazil. This made Hydro a significant player in bauxite mining and alumina refining. =Into the petroleum age= In 1965, Hydro joined Elf Aquitaine and six other French companies to form Petronord to perform search for oil and gas in the North Sea. Hydro soon became a large company in the North Sea petroleum industry, and also became operator of a number of fields, the first being Oseberg. In 1969, Hydro started its first international operations, with a 25% stake in a fertilizer plant in Qatar. Hydro acquired in the late 1980s the Mobil service stations in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, changing their name to Hydro. In 1995 Hydro merged its gas stations in Norway and Denmark with the Texaco, creating the joint venture HydroTexaco. The service station chain was sold in 2006 to Reitangruppen. In 1999 Hydro acquired Norway's third largest petroleum company Saga Petroleum, which had major upstream operations primarily in Norway and the United Kingdom. The British operations were later sold. Hydro's fertilizer business was spun off as a separately stock-listed company under the name of Yara International on March 26, 2004. Hydro distributed all its Yara shares to Hydro's shareholders and presently has no ownership in Yara. In December 2006 Norsk Hydro revealed a proposal to merge their oil business with compatriate oil and gas company Statoil.Hydro's oil and gas activities to merge with Statoil, Norsk Hydro, published 2006-12-18, accessed 2007-06-20 Under the rules of the EEA the proposal was approved by the European Union on May 3, 2007EU regulators approve Statoil, Norsk Hydro merger, EU Business, published 2007-05-03, accessed 2007-06-20 and by the Norwegian Parliament on June 8, 2007.Norwegian Parliament Okays Statoil-Hydro Merger , Ocean-Resources, published 2007-06-11, accessed 2007-06-20 The merger was completed by 1 October 2007. Hydro's shareholders took 32.7% of the new company‚ÄîStatoilHydro‚Äîshares. Operations =Aluminium= Hydro Aluminum plant in Commerce, Texas Hydro is one of the largest aluminium companies worldwide. In Norway, Hydro has plants in Magnor, Rjukan, Raufoss, Vennesla, Karm√∏y, H√∏yanger, √Ördal, Husnes, Sunndals√∏ra, and Holmestrand. Most of the employees in the company work in plants and offices located outside Norway, such as Germany and Brazil. Hydro has more employees in the United States than any other Norwegian company. In 2010, Hydro and Qatar Petroleum inaugurated their 50-50 joint venture Qatalum, located in Qatar. It was the largest aluminium plant ever launched in one step. Its annual capacity in September 2011 was 585,000 metric tons of primary aluminium, all to be shipped as value added aluminium casthouse products. A 1350 MW natural gas power plant was also built to ensure a stable supply of electricity. In 2010, Hydro acquired the Brazilian bauxite, alumina and aluminium production assets of Vale, an international mining and metals company. In September 2013, Hydro combined its aluminium extrusion operations with that of Sapa, making Sapa a 50/50 joint venture between Hydro and the Norwegian company Orkla. Hydro then acquired Orkla's 50% ownership in Sapa in October 2017, taking over the company and turning it into a new business area within Hydro, called Extruded Solutions. The agreed enterprise value for 100% of Sapa was NOK 27 billion. =Energy= Hydro is a major producer of hydroelectric power in Norway. To secure electricity for its aluminium production Hydro has signed a power purchase agreement with the Fosen Vind wind farm, which is scheduled to be fully operational in 2020. Under this agreement Fosen Vind will deliver around 0.6 TWh in 2020, around 1.0 TWh annually from 2021‚Äì2035 and 0.7 TWh annually from 2036‚Äì2039, for a total of about 18 TWh over a 20-year period. =Hydro Agri= Though Hydro started off as a fertilizer producer and agricultural products was for a long time one of the companies major ventures, the agricultural division was in 2004 demerged into the independent company Yara International, listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.  Environmental issues  In February 2018 Hydro was forced to cut aluminium production by 50% in its plant located in Par√°, Brazil (operated by the joint venture Albras). This followed after allegations had surfaced, stating that untreated and contaminated water had been released to the environment, resulting in water pollution. A team of local researchers found a clandestine waste pipe and highly elevated levels of aluminum in its proximity. Other substances such as nitrate, sulphate, chloride and lead were also found at abnormally high concentrations. Hydro has since claimed that while some unauthorized spills had happened, their own and independent reports showed no environmental pollution of the river but only a small change in pH.

The station is on the Circle and District lines, between Notting Hill Gate and Paddington stations and is in Travelcard Zone 1. It is less than away from the Central line's Queensway station. Location The station is located on the busy Queensway tourist street and is only a few metres from Bayswater Road. It is a short walk from Portobello Market. Further north along the street is the site of the former Whiteleys shopping centre, which is currently under redevelopment. Also nearby is Westbourne Grove, Queens ice rink and bowling centre, Kensington Gardens and St Sophia's Greek Orthodox Cathedral. It is less than away from Queensway station on the Central line. History The station was opened by the steam-operated Metropolitan Railway (MR) (now the Metropolitan line) on 1 October 1868 as Bayswater, as part of the railway's southern extension to South Kensington where it connected to the District Railway (DR). Construction of the railway line, through the already developed Bayswater area required the excavation of a tunnel using the cut and cover method: a trench deep was excavated between brick retaining walls which was then roofed-over with brick arches to allow building work above. Large compensation payments were made to landowners affected by the excavations and, in Leinster Gardens to the east, the frontages of two houses demolished to make way for the line were reconstructed to restore the appearance of a terrace of houses.The dummy frontages at 23 and 24 Leinster Gardens remain and feature blank windows and false front doors and small porticos matching the adjacent buildings. The platforms of Bayswater station were constructed in the trench and provided with a glazed roof. A short section of the trench was left unroofed to the west of the station to allow smoke and steam from the trains to escape from the tunnels. Even before the completion in 1884 of the continuous circuit of tracks which are now the Circle line, the MR and DR operated services through Bayswater as the Inner Circle. The MR originally provided all of the trains, but from 1871, each company operated half of the service. In 1905, to improve the conditions in the tunnels and stations and increase service frequencies, the MR electrified the tracks through Bayswater and, in conjunction with the DR, around the whole of the Inner Circle and across most of their routes. Electric trains began running on 1 July 1905, but the MR's poor coordination of the installation work with the DR led to disruption for several months. Exterior view in 1961 On 1 November 1926 the District line began a service between Edgware Road and Putney Bridge and the station was also renamed to Bayswater (Queen's Road) & Westbourne Grove. From this date the MR operated all Inner Circle services apart from a few District line operated Sunday services. The station was then renamed again to Bayswater (Queen's Road) in 1933. In 1946, it was renamed to Bayswater (Queensway) but the suffix was gradually dropped. In 1949, the service was separately identified on the tube map as the Circle line for the first time. The station was refurbished by Metronet in 2006. Services and connections =Services= Circle line The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is: *6tph clockwise to Edgware Road via Paddington (Praed Street) *6tph anti-clockwise to Hammersmith via High Street Kensington and Victoria District line The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is: *6tph eastbound to Edgware Road *6tph westbound to Wimbledon There is also a morning service every day from Acton Town (Ealing Broadway on Saturdays) to Edgware Road and a late evening service from Edgware Road to Ealing Broadway on Sundays only. =Connections= London Bus routes 7, 23, 27, 36 and 70, and night route N7 serve the station. Additionally, bus routes 23, 27 and 36 provide a 24-hour bus service. Incidents In November 2017, a 29-year-old man attempted to murder a 55-year-old man by pushing him in front of a District line train as it was pulling in to the platform. However, the victim survived by adopting a foetal position between the rails as the train passed over him. In popular culture Bayswater tube station is the subject of a painting by Walter Sickert dating from 1916, showing the platform-sign reading ‚ÄòQueen‚Äôs Road (Bayswater)‚Äô beside a big advertisement for Whiteley's department store. The station was later renamed Bayswater, to avoid confusion with Queensway station, which was also named ‚ÄòQueen‚Äôs Road‚Äô until 1946.

Health effects associated with alcohol intake in large amounts include an increased risk of alcoholism, malnutrition, chronic pancreatitis, alcoholic liver disease and cancer. In addition, damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from chronic alcohol abuse. Even light and moderate alcohol consumption increases risk for certain types of cancer. The long-term use of alcohol is capable of damaging nearly every organ and system in the body. The developing adolescent brain is particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of alcohol. In addition, the developing fetal brain is also vulnerable, and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) may result if pregnant mothers consume alcohol. The inverse relation in Western cultures between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular disease has been known for over 100 years. Many physicians do not promote alcohol consumption; however, given the many health concerns associated with it, some suggest that alcohol should be regarded as a recreational drug, and promote exercise and good nutrition to combat cardiovascular disease. Alcohol liver disease (ALD) accounted for four fifths of all chronic diseases in Ireland in 2013. Negative effects include increased risk of liver diseases, oropharyngeal cancer, esophageal cancer and pancreatitis. Conversely moderate intake of alcohol may have some beneficial effects on gastritis and cholelithiasis. Chronic alcohol misuse and abuse has serious effects on physical and mental health. Chronic excess alcohol intake, or alcohol dependence, can lead to a wide range of neuropsychiatric or neurological impairment, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and malignant neoplasms. The psychiatric disorders which are associated with alcoholism include major depression, dysthymia, depersonalization, mania, hypomania, panic disorder, phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, personality disorders, schizophrenia, suicide, neurologic deficits (e.g. impairments of working memory, emotions, executive functions, visuospatial abilities and gait and balance) and brain damage. Alcohol dependence is associated with hypertension, coronary heart disease, and ischemic stroke, cancer of the respiratory system, and also cancers of the digestive system, liver, breast and ovaries. Heavy drinking is associated with liver disease, such as cirrhosis. Excessive alcohol consumption can have a negative impact on aging. Some nations have introduced alcohol packaging warning messages that inform consumers about alcohol and cancer, and about risk of fetal alcohol syndrome for women who drink while pregnant. Mortality effects A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found that moderate ethanol consumption does not prolong life compared with lifetime abstention from ethanol consumption. A systematic analysis of data from the Global Burden of Disease study found that consumption of ethanol increases the risk of cancer and increases the risk of all-cause mortality, and that the level of ethanol consumption that minimizes disease is zero consumption. Some studies have concluded that drinking small quantities of alcohol (less than one drink in women and two in men) is associated with a decreased risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and early death. Some of these studies lumped former ethanol drinkers and life-long abstainers into a single group of nondrinkers, hiding the health benefits of life-long abstention from ethanol. Drinking more than this amount actually increases the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Maximum quantity recommended Total recorded alcohol per capita consumption (15+), in litres of pure alcohol Different countries recommend different maximum quantities. In the UK, the Chief Medical Officers' recommends men and women drink no more than 14 units per week. A single unit corresponds to 8 g of ethanol. For most countries, the maximum quantity for men is 140 g‚Äì210 g per week. For women, the range is 84 g‚Äì140 g per week. Most countries recommend total abstinence during pregnancy and lactation. Contradictory large-scale reviews were published in The Lancet in 2018. One reported a \\"safe\\" drinking limit of up to seven \\"standard\\" drinks per week, equivalent to 100 grams of pure alcohol per week. The other concluded that there is no safe level of alcohol, that \\"the level of consumption that minimises health loss is zero\\" and emphasized the need to revise alcohol control policies worldwide in order to reduce overall alcohol consumption. Alcohol-related death Disability-adjusted life year for alcohol use disorders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004. Over-consumption of alcohol causes many deaths worldwide. The overall mortality from alcohol use was found to be similar to that of the effect of physical inactivity. A review in 2009 found that \\"the net effect of alcohol consumption on health is detrimental, with an estimated 3.8% of all global deaths and 4.6% of global disability-adjusted life-years attributable to alcohol.\\" Extensive research of Western cultures has consistently shown increased survival associated with light to moderate alcohol consumption.Di Castelnuovo A, Costanzo S, Bagnardi V, Donati MB, Iacoviello L, de Gaetano G. Alcohol dosing and total mortality in men and women: an updated meta-analysis of 34 prospective studies. Arch Intern Med. 2006 Dec 11-25;166(22) 2437-45. A 23-year prospective study of 12,000 male British physicians aged 48‚Äì78, found that overall mortality was significantly lower in current drinkers compared to non-drinkers even after correction for ex-drinkers. This benefit was strongest for ischemic heart disease, but was also noted for other vascular disease and respiratory disease. Death rate amongst current drinkers was higher for 'alcohol augmentable' disease such as liver disease and oral cancers, but these deaths were much less common than cardiovascular and respiratory deaths. The lowest mortality rate was found for consumption of 8 to 14 'units' per week. In the UK a unit is defined as 10ml or 8g of pure alcohol. Higher consumption increased overall mortality rate, but not above that of non-drinkers. Other studies have found age-dependent mortality risks of low-to-moderate alcohol use: an increased risk for individuals aged 16‚Äì34 (due to increased risk of cancers, accidents, liver disease, and other factors), but a decreased risk for individuals ages 55+ (due to lower incidence of ischemic heart disease). This is consistent with other research that found a J-curve dependency between alcohol consumption and total mortality among middle aged and older men. While the mortality rates of ex-drinkers and heavy drinkers are significantly elevated, the all-cause mortality rates may be 15‚Äì18% lower among moderate drinkers. Although the definition of a drink varies between studies and countries, this meta-analysis found that low levels of alcohol intake, defined as 1‚Äì2 drinks per day for women and 2‚Äì4 drinks per day for men, was associated with lower mortality than abstainers. This claim was challenged by another study that found that in certain low quality studies occasional drinkers or ex-drinkers were included as abstainers, resulting in the increased mortality in that group. However, the J-curve for total and CHD mortality was reconfirmed by studies that took the mentioned confounders into account. There seems to be little discussion of what proportion of individuals classified as abstainers are those already at greater risk of mortality due to chronic conditions and do not or cannot consume alcohol for reasons of health or harmful interactions with medication. The observed decrease in mortality of light-to-moderate drinkers compared to never drinkers might be partially explained by superior health and social status of the drinking group; however, the protective effect of alcohol in light to moderate drinkers remains significant even after adjusting for these confounders. Additionally, confounders such as underreporting of alcohol intake might lead to the underestimation of how much mortality is reduced in light-to-moderate drinkers. A 2010 study confirmed the beneficial effect of moderate alcohol consumption on mortality. Subjects were grouped into abstainers, light, moderate, and heavy drinkers. The order of mortality rates from lowest to highest were moderate, light, heavy, and abstainers. The increased risk for abstainers was twice the mortality rate as for moderate drinkers. This study specifically sought to control for confounding factors including the problem of ex-drinkers considered as non-drinkers. According to another study, drinkers with heavy drinking occasions (six or more drinks at a time) have a 57% higher all-cause mortality than drinkers without heavy drinking occasions. Mortality is lowest among young abstainers and highest among young heavy drinkers. According to a 2018 study people who had more than seven and up to 14 standard drinks per week, were likely to have their life expectancy shortened by around 6 months. Those who consumed over 14 drinks and up to 25 per week were likely to have 1‚Äì2 years taken off their lifespan, and a consumption of over 25 standard drinks per week correlated with 4‚Äì5 fewer years. In contrast to studies of Western cultures, research in other cultures has yielded some opposite findings. The landmark INTERHEART Study has revealed that alcohol consumption in South Asians was not protective against CAD in sharp contrast to other populations who benefit from it. In fact Asian Indians who consume alcohol had a 60% higher risk of heart attack which was greater with local spirits (80%) than branded spirits (50%). The harm was observed in alcohol users classified as occasional as well as regular light, moderate, and heavy consumers. Another large study of 4465 subjects in India also confirmed the possible harm of alcohol consumption on coronary risk in men. Compared to lifetime abstainers, alcohol users had higher blood sugar (2 mg/dl), blood pressure (2 mm Hg) levels, and the HDL-C levels (2 mg/dl) and significantly higher tobacco use (63% vs. 21%). =Russia= One study claims that \\"excessive alcohol consumption in Russia, particularly by men, has in recent years caused more than half of all the deaths at ages 15‚Äì54 years.\\"IARC Alcohol causes more than half of all the premature deaths in Russian adults However, there are some difficulties with this study. For instance the same study also found a protective effect of heavy drinking on breast cancer mortality. This contradicts the well established scientific view that alcohol increases breast cancer risk. On this account in further correspondence it was advised that \\"careful interpretation of mortality statistics in relation to alcohol use is needed, taking into account other relevant risk factors, incidence, and survival.\\" =United Kingdom= A governmental report from Britain has found that \\"There were 8,724 alcohol-related deaths in 2007, lower than 2006, but more than double the 4,144 recorded in 1991. The alcohol- related death rate was 13.3 per 100,000 population in 2007, compared with 6.9 per 100,000 population in 1991.\\" In Scotland, the NHS estimate that in 2003 one in every 20 deaths could be attributed to alcohol.BBC Alcohol 'kills one in 20 Scots' 30 June 2009 A 2009 report noted that the death rate from alcohol-related disease was 9,000, a number three times that of 25 years previously.Sam Lister The price of alcohol: an extra 6,000 early deaths a year The Times, 19 October 2009 A UK report came to the result that the effects of low-to-moderate alcohol consumption on mortality are age-dependent. Low-to- moderate alcohol use increases the risk of death for individuals aged 16‚Äì34 (due to increased risk of cancers, accidents, liver disease, and other factors), but decreases the risk of death for individuals ages 55+ (due to decreased risk of ischemic heart disease). A study in the United Kingdom found that alcohol causes about 4% of cancer cases in the UK (12,500 cases per year). =United States= The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, \\"From 2001‚Äì2005, there were approximately 79,000 deaths annually attributable to excessive alcohol use. In fact, excessive alcohol use is the 3rd leading lifestyle-related cause of death for people in the United States each year.\\"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Alcohol and Public Health A 1993 study estimated US deaths through alcohol at 100,000. Another Centers for Disease Control report from 2001 estimated that medium and high consumption of alcohol led to 75,754 deaths in the United States in 2001. Low consumption of alcohol had some beneficial effects, so a net 59,180 deaths were attributed to alcohol. Longevity In 2016, a meta-analysis of 87 studies investigating alcohol use and mortality risk was conducted. The studies analyzed had shown the largest mortality risk reduction in moderate drinkers, but these studies did not correct for confounding variables common with certain abstainers, such as previous alcoholism, and chronic health issues. After adjusting these studies for abstainer biases, no reduction in mortality risk was found for low-volume drinkers. However, there have been individual studies that show abstainers and heavy drinkers have an increased mortality of about 50% over moderate drinkers after adjustment for confounding factors in individuals above the age of 55. Cardiovascular system Alcohol has been found to have anticoagulant properties. Thrombosis is lower among moderate drinkers than abstainers. A meta-analysis of randomized trials found that alcohol consumption in moderation decreases serum levels of fibrinogen, a protein that promotes clot formation, while it increases levels of tissue type plasminogen activator, an enzyme that helps dissolve clots. These changes were estimated to reduce coronary heart disease risk by about 24%. Another meta- analysis in 2011 found favorable changes in HDL cholesterol, adiponectin, and fibrinogen associated with moderate alcohol consumption. A systematic review based on 16,351 participants showed J-shaped curve for the overall relationship between cardiovascular mortality and alcohol intake. Maximal protective effect was shown with 5-10 g of alcohol consumption per day and the effect was significant up to 26 g/day alcohol consumption. Serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a putative marker of inflammation and predictor of CHD (coronary heart disease) risk, are lower in moderate drinkers than in those who abstain from alcohol, suggesting that alcohol consumption in moderation might have anti-inflammatory effects. Data from one prospective study suggest that, among men with initially low alcohol consumption ( Despite epidemiological evidence, many have cautioned against recommendations for the use of alcohol for health benefits. A physician from the World Health Organization labeled such alcohol promotion as \\"ridiculous and dangerous\\". One reviewer noted, \\"Despite the wealth of observational data, it is not absolutely clear that alcohol reduces cardiovascular risk, because no randomized controlled trials have been performed. Alcohol should never be recommended to patients to reduce cardiovascular risk as a substitute for the well-proven alternatives of appropriate diet, exercise, and drugs.\\" It has been argued that the health benefits from alcohol are at best debatable and may have been exaggerated by the alcohol industry, with investigators holding that alcohol should be regarded as a recreational drug with potentially serious adverse effects on health and should not be promoted for cardio- protection. =Peripheral arterial disease= A prospective study published in 1997 found \\"moderate alcohol consumption appears to decrease the risk of PAD in apparently healthy men.\\" In a large population-based study, moderate alcohol consumption was inversely associated with peripheral arterial disease in women but not in men. But when confounding by smoking was considered, the benefit extended to men. The study concluded \\"an inverse association between alcohol consumption and peripheral arterial disease was found in nonsmoking men and women.\\" =Intermittent claudication= A study found that moderate consumption of alcohol had a protective effect against intermittent claudication. The lowest risk was seen in men who drank 1 to 2 drinks per day and in women who drank half to 1 drink per day. =Heart attack and stroke= Drinking in moderation has been found to help those who have suffered a heart attack survive it. However, excessive alcohol consumption leads to an increased risk of heart failure. A review of the literature found that half a drink of alcohol offered the best level of protection. However, they noted that at present there have been no randomised trials to confirm the evidence which suggests a protective role of low doses of alcohol against heart attacks. There is an increased risk of hypertriglyceridemia, cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and stroke if 3 or more standard drinks of alcohol are taken per day. A systematic review reported that reducing alcohol intake lowers blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner in heavy drinkers. For people who drank two or fewer drinks per day, no difference was found. =Cardiomyopathy= Large amount of alcohol over the long term can lead to alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy presents in a manner clinically identical to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, involving hypertrophy of the musculature of the heart that can lead to congestive heart failure. =Hematologic diseases= Alcoholics may have anemia from several causes; they may also develop thrombocytopenia from direct toxic effect on megakaryocytes, or from hypersplenism. =Atrial fibrillation= Alcohol consumption increases the risk of atrial fibrillation, a type of abnormal heart rhythm. This remains true even at moderate levels of consumption. Nervous system ISCD 2010 study ranking the levels of damage caused by drugs, in the opinion of drug-harm experts. When harm to self and others is summed, alcohol was the most harmful of all drugs considered, scoring 72%. Chronic heavy alcohol consumption impairs brain development, causes alcohol dementia, brain shrinkage, physical dependence, alcoholic polyneuropathy (also known as 'alcohol leg'), increases neuropsychiatric and cognitive disorders and causes distortion of the brain chemistry. At present, due to poor study design and methodology, the literature is inconclusive on whether moderate alcohol consumption increases the risk of dementia or decreases it. Evidence for a protective effect of low to moderate alcohol consumption on age-related cognitive decline and dementia has been suggested by some research; however, other research has not found a protective effect of low to moderate alcohol consumption. Some evidence suggests that low to moderate alcohol consumption may speed up brain volume loss. Chronic consumption of alcohol may result in increased plasma levels of the toxic amino acid homocysteine; which may explain alcohol withdrawal seizures, alcohol-induced brain atrophy and alcohol-related cognitive disturbances. Alcohol's impact on the nervous system can also include disruptions of memory and learning (see Effects of alcohol on memory), such as resulting in a blackout phenomenon. =Strokes= Epidemiological studies of middle-aged populations generally find the relationship between alcohol intake and the risk of stroke to be either U- or J-shaped. There may be very different effects of alcohol based on the type of stroke studied. The predominant form of stroke in Western cultures is ischemic, whereas non-western cultures have more hemorrhagic stroke. In contrast to the beneficial effect of alcohol on ischemic stroke, consumption of more than 2 drinks per day increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. The National Stroke Association estimates this higher amount of alcohol increases stroke risk by 50%. \\"For stroke, the observed relationship between alcohol consumption and risk in a given population depends on the proportion of strokes that are hemorrhagic. Light-to-moderate alcohol intake is associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke which is likely to be, in part, causal. Hemorrhagic stroke, on the other hand, displays a loglinear relationship with alcohol intake.\\" =Brain= Alcohol abuse is associated with widespread and significant brain lesions. Alcohol related brain damage is not only due to the direct toxic effects of alcohol; alcohol withdrawal, nutritional deficiency, electrolyte disturbances, and liver damage are also believed to contribute to alcohol-related brain damage. =Cognition and dementia= Excessive alcohol intake is associated with impaired prospective memory. This impaired cognitive ability leads to increased failure to carry out an intended task at a later date, for example, forgetting to lock the door or to post a letter on time. The higher the volume of alcohol consumed and the longer consumed, the more severe the impairments. One of the organs most sensitive to the toxic effects of chronic alcohol consumption is the brain. In the United States approximately 20% of admissions to mental health facilities are related to alcohol-related cognitive impairment, most notably alcohol-related dementia. Chronic excessive alcohol intake is also associated with serious cognitive decline and a range of neuropsychiatric complications. The elderly are the most sensitive to the toxic effects of alcohol on the brain. There is some inconclusive evidence that small amounts of alcohol taken in earlier adult life is protective in later life against cognitive decline and dementia. However, a study concluded, \\"Our findings suggest that, despite previous suggestions, moderate alcohol consumption does not protect older people from cognitive decline.\\" Wernicke‚ÄìKorsakoff syndrome is a manifestation of thiamine deficiency, usually as a secondary effect of alcohol abuse. The syndrome is a combined manifestation of two eponymous disorders, Korsakoff's Psychosis and Wernicke's encephalopathy. Wernicke's encephalopathy is the acute presentation of the syndrome and is characterised by a confusional state while Korsakoff's psychosis main symptoms are amnesia and executive dysfunction. \\"Banana bags\\", intravenous fluid containers containing vitamins and minerals (bright yellow due to the vitamins), can be used to mitigate these outcomes. =Essential tremor= Essential tremors‚Äîor, in the case of essential tremors on a background of family history of essential tremors, familial tremors‚Äîcan be temporarily relieved in up to two-thirds of patients by drinking small amounts of alcohol. Ethanol is known to activate aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) and inhibit N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors, which are both implicated in essential tremor pathology and could underlie the ameliorative effects. Additionally, the effects of ethanol have been studied in different animal essential tremor models. (For more details on this topic, see Essential tremor.) =Sleep= Chronic use of alcohol used to induce sleep can lead to insomnia: frequent moving between sleep stages occurs, with awakenings due to headaches and diaphoresis. Stopping chronic alcohol abuse can also lead to profound disturbances of sleep with vivid dreams. Chronic alcohol abuse is associated with NREM stage 3 and 4 sleep as well as suppression of REM sleep and REM sleep fragmentation. During withdrawal REM sleep is typically exaggerated as part of a rebound effect. =Mental health effects= High rates of major depressive disorder occur in heavy drinkers and those who abuse alcohol. Whether it is more true that major depressive disorder causes self- medicating alcohol abuse, or the increased incidence of the disorder in alcohol abusers is caused by the drinking, is not known though some evidence suggests drinking causes the disorder. Alcohol misuse is associated with a number of mental health disorders and alcoholics have a very high suicide rate. A study of people hospitalised for suicide attempts found that those who were alcoholics were 75 times more likely to go on to successfully commit suicide than non-alcoholic suicide attempters. In the general alcoholic population the increased risk of suicide compared to the general public is 5-20 times greater. About 15 percent of alcoholics commit suicide. Abuse of other drugs is also associated with an increased risk of suicide. About 33 percent of suicides in the under 35s are correlated with alcohol or other substance misuse. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Studies have shown that alcohol dependence relates directly to cravings and irritability. Another study has shown that alcohol use is a significant predisposing factor towards antisocial behavior in children. Depression, anxiety and panic disorder are disorders commonly reported by alcohol dependent people. Alcoholism is associated with dampened activation in brain networks responsible for emotional processing (e.g. the amygdala and hippocampus). Evidence that the mental health disorders are often induced by alcohol misuse via distortion of brain neurochemistry is indicated by the improvement or disappearance of symptoms that occurs after prolonged abstinence, although problems may worsen in early withdrawal and recovery periods. Psychosis is secondary to several alcohol-related conditions including acute intoxication and withdrawal after significant exposure. Chronic alcohol misuse can cause psychotic type symptoms to develop, more so than with other drugs of abuse. Alcohol abuse has been shown to cause an 800% increased risk of psychotic disorders in men and a 300% increased risk of psychotic disorders in women which are not related to pre- existing psychiatric disorders. This is significantly higher than the increased risk of psychotic disorders seen from cannabis use making alcohol abuse a very significant cause of psychotic disorders. Approximately 3 percent of people who are alcohol dependent experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal. Alcohol-related psychosis may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism. The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis is due to distortions to neuronal membranes, gene expression, as well as thiamin deficiency. It is possible in some cases that alcohol abuse via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance-induced psychotic disorder, i.e. schizophrenia. The effects of an alcohol-related psychosis include an increased risk of depression and suicide as well as psychosocial impairments. However, moderate wine drinking has been shown to lower the risk for depression. While alcohol initially helps social phobia or panic symptoms, with longer term alcohol misuse can often worsen social phobia symptoms and can cause panic disorder to develop or worsen, during alcohol intoxication and especially during the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. This effect is not unique to alcohol but can also occur with long-term use of drugs which have a similar mechanism of action to alcohol such as the benzodiazepines, which are sometimes prescribed as tranquillizers to people with alcohol problems. Approximately half of patients attending mental health services for conditions including anxiety disorders such as panic disorder or social phobia suffer from alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence. It was noted that every individual has an individual sensitivity level to alcohol or sedative hypnotic drugs and what one person can tolerate without ill health another will suffer very ill health and that even moderate drinking can cause rebound anxiety syndromes and sleep disorders. A person who is suffering the toxic effects of alcohol will not benefit from other therapies or medications as they do not address the root cause of the symptoms. Addiction to alcohol, as with any drug of abuse tested so far, has been correlated with an enduring reduction in the expression of GLT1 (EAAT2) in the nucleus accumbens and is implicated in the drug-seeking behavior expressed nearly universally across all documented addiction syndromes. This long-term dysregulation of glutamate transmission is associated with an increase in vulnerability to both relapse-events after re- exposure to drug-use triggers as well as an overall increase in the likelihood of developing addiction to other reinforcing drugs. Drugs which help to re- stabilize the glutamate system such as N-acetylcysteine have been proposed for the treatment of addiction to cocaine, nicotine, and alcohol. Digestive system and weight gain The impact of alcohol on weight-gain is contentious: some studies find no effect, others find decreased or increased effect on weight gain. Alcohol use increases the risk of chronic gastritis (stomach inflammation); it is one cause of cirrhosis, hepatitis, and pancreatitis in both its chronic and acute forms. =Metabolic syndrome= A national survey (NHANES) conducted in the U.S. concluded, \\"Mild to moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a lower prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, with a favorable influence on lipids, waist circumference, and fasting insulin. This association was strongest among whites and among beer and wine drinkers.\\" Similarly, a national survey conducted in Korea reported a J-curve association between alcohol intake and metabolic syndrome: \\"The results of the present study suggest that the metabolic syndrome is negatively associated with light alcohol consumption (1‚Äì15 g alcohol/d) in Korean adults,\\" but risk increased at higher alcohol consumption. =Gallbladder effects= Research has found that drinking reduces the risk of developing gallstones. Compared with alcohol abstainers, the relative risk of gallstone disease, controlling for age, sex, education, smoking, and body mass index, is 0.83 for occasional and regular moderate drinkers (< 25 ml of ethanol per day), 0.67 for intermediate drinkers (25-50 ml per day), and 0.58 for heavy drinkers. This inverse association was consistent across strata of age, sex, and body mass index.\\" Frequency of drinking also appears to be a factor. \\"An increase in frequency of alcohol consumption also was related to decreased risk. Combining the reports of quantity and frequency of alcohol intake, a consumption pattern that reflected frequent intake (5‚Äì7 days/week) of any given amount of alcohol was associated with a decreased risk, as compared with nondrinkers. In contrast, infrequent alcohol intake (1‚Äì2 days/week) showed no significant association with risk.\\" A large self-reported study published in 1998 found no correlation between gallbladder disease and multiple factors including smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, and coffee consumption. A retrospective study from 1997 found vitamin C (ascorbic acid) supplement use in drinkers was associated with a lower prevalence of gallbladder disease, but this association was not seen in non-drinkers. =Liver disease= Alcoholic liver disease is a major public health problem. For example, in the United States up to two million people have alcohol-related liver disorders. Chronic alcohol abuse can cause fatty liver, cirrhosis and alcoholic hepatitis. Treatment options are limited and consist of most importantly discontinuing alcohol consumption. In cases of severe liver disease, the only treatment option may be a liver transplant from alcohol abstinent donors. Research is being conducted into the effectiveness of anti-TNFs. Certain complementary medications, e.g., milk thistle and silymarin, appear to offer some benefit. Alcohol is a leading cause of liver cancer in the Western world, accounting for 32-45% of hepatic cancers. Up to half a million people in the United States develop alcohol-related liver cancer. =Pancreatitis= Alcohol abuse is a leading cause of both acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis. Alcoholic pancreatitis can result in severe abdominal pain and may progress to pancreatic cancer. Chronic pancreatitis often results in intestinal malabsorption, and can result in diabetes. = Body composition= Alcohol affects the nutritional state of the chronic drinkers. It can decrease food consumption and lead to malabsorption. It can create imbalance in the skeletal muscle mass and cause muscle wasting. Chronic consumption alcohol can also increase breakdown of important proteins in our body which can affect gene expression. Other systems =Respiratory system= Chronic alcohol ingestion can impair multiple critical cellular functions in the lungs. These cellular impairments can lead to increased susceptibility to serious complications from lung disease. Recent research cites alcoholic lung disease as comparable to liver disease in alcohol-related mortality. Alcoholics have a higher risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and experience higher rates of mortality from ARDS when compared to non- alcoholics. In contrast to these findings, a large prospective study has shown a protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption on respiratory mortality. =Kidney stones= Research indicates that drinking beer or wine is associated with a lower risk of developing kidney stones. =Sexual dysfunction= Long term excessive intake of alcohol can lead to damage to the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system resulting in loss of sexual desire and impotence in men. This is caused by reduction of testosterone from ethanol-induced testicular atrophy, resulting in increased feminisation of males and is a clinical feature of alcohol abusing males who have cirrhosis of the liver. =Hormonal imbalance= Excessive alcohol intake can result in hyperoestrogenisation. It has been speculated that alcoholic beverages may contain estrogen-like compounds. In men, high levels of estrogen can lead to testicular failure and the development of feminine traits including development of male breasts, called gynecomastia. In women, increased levels of estrogen due to excessive alcohol intake have been related to an increased risk of breast cancer. =Diabetes mellitus= A meta-analysis determined the dose-response relationships by sex and end point using lifetime abstainers as the reference group. A U-shaped relationship was found for both sexes. Compared with lifetime abstainers, the relative risk (RR) for type 2 diabetes among men was most protective when consuming 22 g/day alcohol and became deleterious at just over 60 g/day alcohol. Among women, consumption of 24 g/day alcohol was most protective, and became deleterious at about 50 g/day alcohol. A systematic review on intervention studies in women also supported this finding. It reported that alcohol consumption in moderation improved insulin sensitivity among women. The way in which alcohol is consumed (i.e., with meals or binge drinking) affects various health outcomes. It may be the case that the risk of diabetes associated with heavy alcohol consumption is due to consumption mainly on the weekend as opposed to the same amount spread over a week. In the United Kingdom \\"advice on weekly consumption is avoided\\". A twenty-year twin study from Finland reported that moderate alcohol consumption may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in men and women. However, binge drinking and high alcohol consumption was found to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes in women. =Rheumatoid arthritis= Regular consumption of alcohol is associated with an increased risk of gouty arthritis and a decreased risk of rheumatoid arthritis. Two recent studies report that the more alcohol consumed, the lower the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. Among those who drank regularly, the one-quarter who drank the most were up to 50% less likely to develop the disease compared to the half who drank the least. The researchers noted that moderate alcohol consumption also reduces the risk of other inflammatory processes such as cardiovascular disease. Some of the biological mechanisms by which ethanol reduces the risk of destructive arthritis and prevents the loss of bone mineral density (BMD), which is part of the disease process. A study concluded, \\"Alcohol either protects from RA or, subjects with RA curtail their drinking after the manifestation of RA\\". Another study found, \\"Postmenopausal women who averaged more than 14 alcoholic drinks per week had a reduced risk of rheumatoid arthritis...\\" =Osteoporosis= Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with higher bone mineral density in postmenopausal women. \\"...Alcohol consumption significantly decreased the likelihood [of osteoporosis].\\" \\"Moderate alcohol intake was associated with higher BMD in postmenopausal elderly women.\\" \\"Social drinking is associated with higher bone mineral density in men and women [over 45].\\" However, alcohol abuse is associated with bone loss. =Skin= Chronic excessive alcohol abuse is associated with a wide range of skin disorders including urticaria, porphyria cutanea tarda, flushing, cutaneous stigmata of cirrhosis, psoriasis, pruritus, seborrheic dermatitis and rosacea. A 2010 study concluded, \\"Nonlight beer intake is associated with an increased risk of developing psoriasis among women. Other alcoholic beverages did not increase the risk of psoriasis in this study.\\" Immune system =Bacterial infection= There is a protective effect of alcohol consumption against active infection with H. pylori In contrast, alcohol intake (comparing those who drink > 30g of alcohol per day to non-drinkers) is not associated with higher risk of duodenal ulcer. Excessive alcohol consumption seen in alcoholics is a known risk factor for pneumonia. =Common cold= A study on the common cold found that \\"Greater numbers of alcoholic drinks (up to three or four per day) were associated with decreased risk for developing colds because drinking was associated with decreased illness following infection. However, the benefits of drinking occurred only among nonsmokers. [...] Although alcohol consumption did not influence risk of clinical illness for smokers, moderate alcohol consumption was associated with decreased risk for nonsmokers.\\" Another study concluded, \\"Findings suggest that wine intake, especially red wine, may have a protective effect against common cold. Beer, spirits, and total alcohol intakes do not seem to affect the incidence of common cold.\\" Cancer In 1988 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (Centre International de Recherche sur le Cancer) of the World Health Organization classified alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen, stating \\"There is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of alcoholic beverages in humans.... Alcoholic beverages are carcinogenic to humans (Group 1).\\"IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans: Volume 44 Alcohol Drinking: Summary of Data Reported and Evaluation The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services‚Äô National Toxicology Program in 2000 listed alcohol as a known carcinogen.National Toxicology Program Alcoholic Beverage Consumption: Known to be a human carcinogen First listed in the Ninth Report on Carcinogens (2000)(PDF) It was estimated in 2006 that \\"3.6% of all cancer cases worldwide are related to alcohol drinking, resulting in 3.5% of all cancer deaths.\\" A European study from 2011 found that one in 10 of all cancers in men and one in 33 in women were caused by past or current alcohol intake.BBC News Drinking over recommended limit 'raises cancer risk' 8 April 2011 The World Cancer Research Fund panel report Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective finds the evidence \\"convincing\\" that alcoholic drinks increase the risk of the following cancers: mouth, pharynx and larynx, oesophagus, colorectum (men), breast (pre- and postmenopause).WCRF World Cancer Research Fund / American Institute for Cancer Research. Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective. Washington DC: AICR, 2007 Even light and moderate alcohol consumption increases cancer risk in individuals, especially with respect to squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, oropharyngeal cancer, and breast cancer. Acetaldehyde, a metabolic product of alcohol, is suspected to promote cancer. Typically the liver eliminates 99% of acetaldehyde produced. However, liver disease and certain genetic enzyme deficiencies result in high acetaldehyde levels. Heavy drinkers who are exposed to high acetaldehyde levels due to a genetic defect in alcohol dehydrogenase have been found to be at greater risk of developing cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract and liver. A review in 2007 found \\"convincing evidence that acetaldehyde... is responsible for the carcinogenic effect of ethanol... owing to its multiple mutagenic effects on DNA.\\" Acetaldehyde can react with DNA to create DNA adducts including the Cr-Pdg adduct. This Cr-PdG adduct \\"is likely to play a central role in the mechanism of alcoholic beverage related carcinogenesis.\\" Alcohol's effect on the fetus Fetal alcohol syndrome or FAS is a birth defect that occurs in the offspring of women who drink alcohol during pregnancy. More risks than benefits according to a survey of current knowledge. Alcohol crosses the placental barrier and can stunt fetal growth or weight, create distinctive facial stigmata, damaged neurons and brain structures, and cause other physical, mental, or behavioural problems. Fetal alcohol exposure is the leading known cause of intellectual disability in the Western world. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associated with brain insulin and insulin-like growth factor resistance.  Long-term effects of alcoholism on family and children  Children raised in alcoholic families have the potential to suffer emotional distress as they move into their own committed relationships. These children are at a higher risk for divorce and separation, unstable marital conditions and fractured families. Feelings of depression and antisocial behaviors experienced in early childhood frequently contribute to marital conflict and domestic violence. Women are more likely than men to be victims of alcohol-related domestic violence. Children of alcoholics often incorporate behaviors learned as children into their marital relationships. These behaviors lead to poor parenting practices. For example, adult children of alcoholics may simultaneously express love and rejection toward a child or spouse. This is known as insecure attachment. Insecure attachment contributes to trust and bonding issues with intimate partners and offspring. In addition, prior parental emotional unavailability contributes to poor conflict resolution skills in adult relationships. Evidence shows a correlation between alcoholic fathers who display harsh and ineffective parenting practices with adolescent and adult alcohol dependence. Children of alcoholics are often unable to trust other adults due to fear of abandonment. Further, because children learn their bonding behaviors from watching their parents‚Äô interactions, daughters of alcoholic fathers may be unable to interact appropriately with men when they reach adulthood. Poor behavior modeling by alcoholic parents contributes to inadequate understanding of how to engage in opposite gender interactions. Sons of alcoholics are at risk for poor self-regulation that is often displayed in the preschool years. This leads to blaming others for behavioral problems and difficulties with impulse control. Poor decision-making correlates to early alcohol use, especially in sons of alcoholics. Sons often demonstrate thrill-seeking behavior, harm avoidance, and exhibit a low level of frustration tolerance.  Health risks and alcohol consumption  There are many short and long-term health conditions that are attributed to alcohol consumption. These harmful conditions over prolonged use are well documented to be hard to treat and as some of these health conditions result in permanent damage to several vital organs. There remains a very real implication of death due to one or more of these conditions. Approximately 88,000 deaths have been reported between the years 2006 to 2010 due to excessive alcohol consumption in the United States. Physicians often state alcohol consumption as a direct cause of several chronic conditions becoming harder to manage, thus recommending small quantities over a low frequency to limit further damaging impairments. Some physicians emphatically recommend giving up alcohol in order to prevent heart disease, brain impairment and liver disease. Centers for Disease Control defines a drink as 0.6 ounces of pure alcohol and heavy drinking as 8 or more drinks per week for women and 15 or more drinks per week for men. = Major health risks = Sexual functions Prolonged use of alcohol has been known to impair the nervous system, heart, liver and the reproductive organs resulting in reduced sexual abilities in adult males. Furthermore, due to the mental impairment often related to prolonged use can also lead to tendencies of practicing unprotected sexual intercourse and intercourse with multiple partners. This can result in sexually transmitted diseases along with unintended pregnancies. Effects on the unborn Women who continue to consume alcohol during pregnancy are highly likely to have offspring that have birth defects. As alcohol is able to get directly into the nutrition that the mother is passing on to the baby through her placenta, there is a direct effect to the development of the fetus resulting in damaged cells, birth defects, neurological disorders and miscarriage. Effects on the vital organs Studies have shown a damaging relation between higher amounts of alcohol consumption and organ damage. Cardiovascular problems like high blood pressure, cardiomyopathy and heart attacks have been attributed to excessive alcohol consumption. Beyond the circulatory system, kidney and liver disease are also attributed to alcohol consumption. Effects on brain function have been found, for example memory loss reduced intellectual ability, reduced brain size and coordination. Social effects Prolonged excessive use are known to induce many hard to treat conditions like depression, impulsive decision making, violent and abusive behavior, reduced cognitive abilities. All of these can limit the quality of interactions with family, friends and can lead to harmful behavior towards self and others.  Economic impact from long-term consumption of alcohol  There is currently no consistent approach to measuring the economic impact of alcohol consumption. The economic burden such as direct, indirect, and intangible cost of diseases can be estimated through cost-of-illness studies. Direct costs are estimated through prevalence and incidence studies, while indirect costs are estimated through the human capital method, the demographic method, and the friction cost method. However it is difficult to accurately measure the economic impact due to differences in methodologies, cost items related to alcohol consumption, and measurement techniques. Alcohol dependence has a far reaching impact on health outcomes. A study conducted in Germany in 2016 found the economic burden for those dependent on alcohol was 50% higher than those who were not. In the study, over half of the economic cost was due to lost productivity, and only 6% was due to alcohol treatment programs. The economic cost was mostly borne by individuals between 30‚Äì49 years old. In another study conducted with data from eight European countries, 77% of alcohol dependent patients suffered from psychiatric and somatic co- morbidity, which in turn increased systematic healthcare and economic cost. Alcohol consumption can also affect the immune system and produce complications in people suffering from HIV, pneumonia, and tuberculosis. Indirect costs due to alcohol dependence are significant. The biggest indirect cost comes from lost productivity, followed by premature mortality. Men with alcohol dependence in the U.S. have lower labor force participation by 2.5%, lower earnings by 5.0%, and higher absenteeism by 0.5‚Äì1.2 days. Female binge drinkers have higher absenteeism by 0.4‚Äì0.9 days. Premature mortality is another large contributor to indirect costs of alcohol dependence. In 2004, 3.8% of global deaths were attributable to alcohol (6.3% for men and 1.1 for women). Those under 60 years old have much higher prevalence in global deaths attributable to alcohol at 5.3%. In general, indirect costs such as premature mortality due to alcohol dependence, loss of productivity due to absenteeism and presenteeism, and cost of property damage and enforcement, far exceed the direct health care and law enforcement costs. Aggregating the economic cost from all sources, the impact can range from 0.45‚Äì5.44% of a country's gross domestic product (GDP). The wide range is due to inconsistency in measurement of economic burden, as researchers in some studies attributed possible positive effects from long term alcohol consumption.

Nf3 Nc6 :3. Bc4 Bc5 :4. b4 The Evans Gambit is an aggressive line of the Giuoco Piano. White offers a pawn to divert the black bishop on c5. If Black accepts, White can follow up with c3 and d4, ripping open the , while also opening diagonals to play Ba3 or Qb3 at some point, preventing Black from castling and threatening the f7-pawn respectively. If Black declines, the b4-pawn stakes out on the queenside, and White can follow up with a4 later in the game, potentially gaining a tempo by threatening to trap Black's . According to Reuben Fine, the Evans Gambit poses a challenge for Black since the usual defences (play ...d6 and/or give back the gambit pawn) are more difficult to pull off than with other gambits. (Fine was once beaten by this gambit in a friendly game against Bobby Fischer, in just 17 moves.) The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings has two codes for the Evans Gambit, C51 and C52. *C51: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4 *C52: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4 Bxb4 5.c3 Ba5 History The gambit is named after the Welsh sea Captain William Davies Evans, the first player known to have employed it. The first game with the opening is considered to be Evans‚ÄìMcDonnell, London 1827, although in that game a slightly different move order was tried (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.0-0 d6 and only now 5.b4). In 1832, the first analysis of the gambit was published in the Second Series of Progressive Lessons (1832) by William Lewis.The British chess magazine, vol. 26 (1906) page 51. The gambit became very popular shortly after that, being employed a number of times in the series of games between McDonnell and Louis de la Bourdonnais in 1834. Players such as Adolf Anderssen, Paul Morphy and Mikhail Chigorin subsequently took it up. The Evergreen game won by Adolf Anderssen against Jean Dufresne opened with the Evans Gambit. Eventually however, the second World Chess Champion Emanuel Lasker dealt a heavy blow to the opening with a modern defensive idea: returning the pawn under favourable circumstances. The opening was out of favour for much of the 20th century, although John Nunn and Jan Timman played some games with it in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and in the 1990s Garry Kasparov used it in a few of his games (notably a famous 25-move win against Viswanathan Anand in Riga, 1995), which prompted a brief revival of interest in it. General remarks =Accepting the gambit= The most obvious and most usual way for Black to meet the gambit is to accept it with 4...Bxb4, after which White plays 5.c3 and Black usually follows up with 5...Ba5 (5...Be7 and, less often 5...Bc5 and 5...Bd6, the Stone Ware Variation, are also played). White usually follows up with 6.d4. Emanuel Lasker's line is 4...Bxb4 5.c3 Ba5 6.d4 d6 7.0-0 Bb6 8.dxe5 dxe5 9.Qxd8+ Nxd8 10.Nxe5 Be6. This variation takes the sting out of White's attack by returning the gambit pawn and exchanging queens, and according to Fine, the resulting simplified position \\"is psychologically depressing for the gambit player\\" whose intent is usually an aggressive attack. Chigorin did a lot of analysis on the alternative 9.Qb3 Qf6 10.Bg5 Qg6 11.Bd5 Nge7 12.Bxe7 Kxe7 13.Bxc6 Qxc6 14.Nxe5 Qe6, which avoids the exchange of queens, but reached no clear verdict. Instead White often avoids this line with 7.Qb3 Qd7 8.dxe5, when Black can return the pawn with 8...Bb6 or hold onto it with 8...dxe5, though White obtains sufficient compensation in this line. Alternatively Black can meet 6.d4 with 6...exd4, when White can try 7.Qb3, a move often favoured by Nigel Short. 7.0-0 is traditionally met by 7...Nge7 intending to meet 8.Ng5 or 8.cxd4 with 8...d5, returning the pawn in many lines, rather than the materialistic 7...dxc3 which is well met by 8.Qb3 with a very dangerous initiative for the sacrificed pawns. Alternatively 7...d6 8.cxd4 Bb6 is known as the Normal Position, in which Black is content to settle for a one-pawn advantage and White seeks compensation in the form of open lines and a strong centre. =Declining the gambit= Alternatively, the gambit can be declined with 4...Bb6, when 5.a4 a6 is the normal continuation. But due to the loss of tempo involved, most commentators consider declining the Evans Gambit to be weaker than accepting it, then giving up the pawn at a later stage. Also, Black can play the rare Countergambit Variation (4...d5), but this is thought to be rather dubious. In the book My System, however, Aron Nimzowitsch states that by declining the gambit Black has not lost a tempo, since the move b4 was, in the sense of development, unproductive, > as is every pawn move, if it does not bear a logical connection with the > centre. For suppose after 4...Bb6 5.b5 (to make a virtue of necessity and > attempt something of a demobilizing effect with the ill-moved b-pawn move), > 5...Nd4 and now if 6.Nxe5, then 6...Qg5 with a strong attack.Aron > Nimzowitsch, My System: Winning Chess Strategies, Snowball Publishing, 2012, > p. 11.  Bishop retreats after accepting the gambit After 4.b4 Bxb4 5.c3, the bishop must move or be captured. The common retreats are listed here, with the good and bad sides of each: =5...Ba5= According to Chessgames.com, this is Black's most popular retreat. It gets out of the way of White's centre pawns, and pins the c3-pawn if White plays 6.d4, but it has the disadvantage of removing the a5-square for the black queen's knight. Black usually subsequently retreats the bishop to b6 to facilitate ...Na5, which is particularly strong when White opts for the Bc4, Qb3 approach. =5...Bc5= According to Chessgames.com, this is the second most popular retreat, with White scoring better than after 5...Ba5. This is often played by people unfamiliar with the Evans Gambit, and is arguably inferior to 5...Ba5, because 6.d4 attacks the bishop and narrows down Black's options as compared with 5...Ba5 6.d4. =5...Be7= Lasker's Defence has often been considered one of the \\"safer\\" retreats, and has been played by Viswanathan Anand. After 6.d4 Na5, White can attempt to maintain an initiative with 7.Be2 as played by Kasparov, or immediately recapture the pawn with 7.Nxe5. =5...Bd6= This is called the Stone‚ÄìWare Defense after Henry Nathan Stone and Preston Ware. The move reinforces the e5-pawn and has been played by several grandmasters such as Andrei Volokitin, Alexander Grischuk and Loek van Wely. =5...Bf8= This is called the Mayet Defence and is played very rarely. In popular culture The Evans Gambit was referenced in The West Wing episode \\"Hartsfield's Landing\\", when President Josiah Bartlet mentions it while playing with Toby Ziegler. The moves shown on the chessboard are actually the Evans Gambit.

Amersham station is a terminus of the London Underground's Metropolitan line. It is 23.7 miles (38.1 km) northwest of Charing Cross, making it the second furthest Underground station from central London and the second most westerly station of the whole London Underground system, after .Open Street Map It is in Travelcard Zone 9 (previously zone D). Amersham station is also served by Chiltern Railways, which run trains between London Marylebone and Aylesbury. From Aylesbury a shuttle service to Princes Risborough provides access to through services between Marylebone and Birmingham Snow Hill. The journey times between Amersham and Central London range between 33 and 60 minutes. The journey time between Amersham and Chalfont & Latimer is about three and a half minutes. History Marylebone - Woodford Halse stopping train in 1959 The station was opened on 1 September 1892 as part of the Metropolitan Railway (Met) extension from Chalfont Road (now Chalfont & Latimer) to Aylesbury. On 12 March 1922, its name was changed to \\"Amersham & Chesham Bois\\", but the original name was restored during 1937. Platform view From 16 March 1899, the Great Central Railway served the station through its extension to Marylebone. Consequently, the station became joint Met/GCR owned. On 1 January 1923, the GCR became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) as part of the Railways Act 1921, and on 1 July 1933, the Met became part of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), thus becoming the Metropolitan line of the London Underground. On 1 January 1948, the LNER was nationalised, its share of the station initially coming under the control of the Eastern Region of British Railways, before being transferred to the London Midland Region in 1958. On 12 September 1960, the tracks from Rickmansworth to Amersham were electrified, partially fulfilling plans first proposed some thirty years earlier. The rolling stock ordered by London Underground as part of this project, the A60 stock, is named after Amersham. =Service Changes= When the sectorisation of British Rail took place in 1982, services to Aylesbury on what had by now become the London to Aylesbury Line came under the operation of Network SouthEast. Following the privatisation of British Rail in the mid-1990s, these services have been provided by Chiltern Railways. From December 2010, off-peak Metropolitan line services to and from Amersham were reduced to two per hour, with a corresponding increase in through services on the Chesham branch. This is a return to the historically normal frequency of two Metropolitan trains per hour from the four Metropolitan trains per hour service that had been operating for the previous five years. Including the Chiltern Railways services, Amersham still has four trains an hour to London in total, with extra trains from both operators at peak hours. Metropolitan line services are divided 50:50 between Amersham and Chesham. This is expected to divide park and ride or kiss and ride motorist users more evenly between the two stations and help spread the load on local roads, though the change was made purely for operational reasons. The station today The station is located on Station Approach, Amersham.Google Maps - Amersham Station Ticket barriers are in operation at the station. In 2009, because of financial constraints, Transport for London (TfL) decided to stop work on a project to provide step-free access at Amersham and five other stations, on the grounds that these are relatively quiet stations and some are already one or two stops away from an existing step-free station. In 2017, TfL announced that Amersham station would receive funding for step-free access, with work commencing in 2018. It is due for completion in 2020.

Operation At midnight on Friday 14 May, the British declared its civil and military authority in Jerusalem to be at an end. In the morning they evacuated the city in two large convoys, one moved north towards Haifa and the other south towards Bethlehem.

As battle director of Final Fantasy X, he changed the recurring battle system in the series. Whereas Hiroyuki Ito had created the Active Time Battle system in Final Fantasy IV, Tsuchida would create the Conditional Turn-Based Battle system to make things more strategic. He kept Final Fantasy IV in mind when working on Final Fantasy X. Tsuchida was the head of Product Development Division-6 within Square Enix. He produced Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King, and stated that Square Enix was excited to be the first ones to bring a new game to Wiiware game platform. The game concept was to take the role of the king, not the hero, and the Crystal Chronicles series has a large amount of character interactions. Game development began before the Wiiware tools were distributed. Developing Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King required a change from the typical way the Square Enix developed games, switching from starting with the graphics and to beginning with gameplay.

He was previously Governor of South Australia from 1899 to 1902. Tennyson was born in Twickenham, Middlesex, and educated at Marlborough College and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was the eldest son of the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and served as his personal secretary and biographer; he succeeded to his father's title in 1892. Tennyson was made Governor of South Australia in 1899. When Lord Hopetoun resigned the governor- generalship in mid-1902, Tennyson was the longest-serving state governor and thus became Administrator of the Government. Tennyson was eventually chosen to be Hopetoun's permanent replacement, but accepted only a one-year term. He was more popular than his predecessor among the general public, but had a tense relationship with Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and was not offered an extension to his term. Tennyson retired to the Isle of Wight, and spent the rest of his life upholding his father's legacy. Early life Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and his sons Hallam (right) and Lionel. Hallam Tennyson was born in Chapel House, a house his father was renting in Twickenham, Middlesex. His parents were Emily (n√©e Sellwood) and Alfred Tennyson. Tennyson's early childhood was spent at Farringford House on the Isle of Wight, which his father began renting in 1853 and bought in 1856. He was educated at Marlborough College and Trinity College, Cambridge. Tennyson's career aspirations ended when his parents' age and ill-health obliged him to leave Cambridge to become their personal secretary. The idea of going into politics was also abandoned. It was partly for Hallam's benefit that Alfred Tennyson accepted a peerage in 1884, the year Hallam married Audrey Boyle (after being disappointed in his love for Mary Gladstone, daughter of William Ewart Gladstone). On his father's death in 1892, he inherited the title Baron Tennyson, and also the role of official biographer. His Tennyson: a Memoir was published in 1897. Governor of South Australia Like his famous father, Tennyson was an ardent imperialist, and in 1883 he had become a council member of the Imperial Federation League, a lobby group set up to support the imperialist ideas of the Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain. It was this connection, as well as the Tennyson name, that led Chamberlain to offer Tennyson the position of Governor of South Australia in 1899. He was still in this position in May 1902, when the Governor-General of Australia, the Earl of Hopetoun, suddenly announced his intention to resign. Governor-General of Australia Tennyson in his viceregal uniform Tennyson was the senior state governor at the time of Hopetoun's announcement, and thus became Administrator of the Government upon his departure from Australia on 17 July 1902. There were some doubts about his ability to fill the job on a permanent basis since he had little experience of politics. But he had made a good impression in Australia through his modesty and frugality, unlike the ostentatiously imperious Hopetoun. In January 1903 he accepted the post for, at his own suggestion, a one-year appointment only. The new Governor-General was popular and got on with Australians far better than his predecessor had done. But problems arose through the ambiguity of his position. The Prime Minister, Alfred Deakin, insisted that the Governor-General's official secretary must be appointed and paid by the Australian government. The British government objected (privately) because this would mean that the Governor-General could not carry out what was seen in London as his broader role in supervising the Australian government. Tennyson shared this view. As a result, relations between Deakin and Tennyson grew tense. Deakin correctly suspected that Tennyson was reporting on him to London and trying to interfere on matters of policy, such as the naval agreement between Britain and Australia. For this reason Deakin did not encourage Tennyson to seek an extension of his one-year term. None of this was known to the public and Tennyson left Australia in January 1904 to universal expressions of approval. Retirement Lord Tennyson, 1908, Briton Rivi√®re. Tennyson spent the rest of his life at Farringford, serving as deputy Governor of the Isle of Wight from 1913. His wife died in 1916, and in 1918 he remarried to Mary Emily (May) Prinsep (1853‚Äì1931). She was the daughter of Charles Robert Prinsep, born in India and later the owner of a large nutmeg plantation in Singapore. Tennyson was May Prinsep's second husband; her first husband was Andrew Hichens.

Echocardiography uses standard two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and Doppler ultrasound to create images of the heart. Echocardiography has become routinely used in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients with any suspected or known heart diseases. It is one of the most widely used diagnostic tests in cardiology. It can provide a wealth of helpful information, including the size and shape of the heart (internal chamber size quantification), pumping capacity, and the location and extent of any tissue damage. An echocardiogram can also give physicians other estimates of heart function, such as a calculation of the cardiac output, ejection fraction, and diastolic function (how well the heart relaxes). Echocardiography is an important tool in assessing wall motion abnormality in patients with suspected cardiac disease. It is a tool which helps in reaching an early diagnosis of myocardial infarction showing regional wall motion abnormality of the heart. Also, it is important in treatment and followup in patients with heart failure, by assessing ejection fraction. Echocardiography can help detect cardiomyopathies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and many others. The use of stress echocardiography may also help determine whether any chest pain or associated symptoms are related to heart disease. The biggest advantage to echocardiography is that it is not invasive (does not involve breaking the skin or entering body cavities) and has no known risks or side effects. Not only can an echocardiogram create ultrasound images of heart structures, but it can also produce accurate assessment of the blood flowing through the heart by Doppler echocardiography, using pulsed- or continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound. This allows assessment of both normal and abnormal blood flow through the heart. Color Doppler, as well as spectral Doppler, is used to visualize any abnormal communications between the left and right sides of the heart, any leaking of blood through the valves (valvular regurgitation), and estimate how well the valves open (or do not open in the case of valvular stenosis). The Doppler technique can also be used for tissue motion and velocity measurement, by tissue Doppler echocardiography. Echocardiography was also the first ultrasound subspecialty to use intravenous contrast. Echocardiography is performed by cardiac sonographers, cardiac physiologists (UK), or physicians trained in echocardiography. Recognized as the \\"Father of Echocardiography\\", the Swedish physician Inge Edler (1911-2001), a graduate of Lund University, was the first of his profession to apply ultrasonic pulse echo imaging in diagnosing cardiac disease, which the acoustical physicist Floyd Firestone had developed to detect defects in metal castings. In fact, Edler in 1953 produced the first echocardiographs using an industrial Firestone-Sperry Ultrasonic Reflectoscope. In developing echocardiography, Edler worked with the physicist Carl Hellmuth Hertz, the son of the Nobel laureate Gustav Hertz and grandnephew of Heinrich Rudolph Hertz. Medical uses Sonographer doing an echocardiogram of a child Echocardiogram in the parasternal long-axis view, showing a measurement of the heart's left ventricle Health societies recommend the use of echocardiography for initial diagnosis when a change in the patient's clinical status occurs and when new data from an echocardiogram would result in the physician changing the patient's care. Health societies do not recommend routine testing when the patient has no change in clinical status or when a physician is unlikely to change care for the patient based on the results of testing. A common example of overuse of echocardiography when not indicated is the use of routine testing in response to a patient diagnosis of mild valvular heart disease. In this case, patients are often asymptomatic for years before the onset of deterioration and the results of the echocardiogram would not result in a change in care without other change in clinical status. Echocardiography now has a vast role in pediatrics, diagnosing patients with valvular heart disease and other congenital abnormalities. An emerging branch is fetal echocardiography, which involves echocardiography of an unborn fetus. Types of echocardiography =Transthoracic echocardiogram= A standard echocardiogram is also known as a transthoracic echocardiogram or cardiac ultrasound. In this case, the echocardiography transducer (or probe) is placed on the chest wall (or thorax) of the subject, and images are taken through the chest wall. This is a noninvasive, highly accurate, and quick assessment of the overall health of the heart. =Transesophageal echocardiogram= This is an alternative way to perform an echocardiogram. A specialized probe containing an ultrasound transducer at its tip is passed into the patient's esophagus. This allows image and Doppler evaluation from a location directly behind the heart. This is known as a transesophageal echocardiogram. Transesophageal echocardiograms are most often used when transthoracic images are suboptimal and when a more clear and precise image is needed for assessment. This test is performed in the presence of a cardiologist, registered nurse, and ultrasound technologist. Conscious sedation and/or localized numbing medication may be used to make the patient more comfortable during the procedure. = Stress echocardiography = A stress echocardiogram, also known as a stress echo, uses ultrasound imaging of the heart to assess the wall motion in response to physical stress. First, images of the heart are taken \\"at rest\\" to acquire a baseline of the patient's wall motion at a resting heart rate. The patient then walks on a treadmill or uses another exercise modality to increase the heart rate to his or her target heart rate, or 85% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate (220 ‚àí patient's age). Finally, images of the heart are taken \\"at stress\\" to assess wall motion at the peak heart rate. A stress echo assesses wall motion of the heart; it does not, however, create an image of the coronary arteries directly. Ischemia of one or more coronary arteries could cause a wall motion abnormality, which could indicate coronary artery disease. The gold standard test to directly create an image of the coronary arteries and directly assess for stenosis or occlusion is a cardiac catheterization. A stress echo is not invasive and is performed in the presence of a licensed medical professional, such as a cardiologist, and a cardiac sonographer. = Intracardiac echocardiography = Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is specialized form of echocardiography that uses catheters to insert the ultrasound probe inside the heart to view 2D structures from within. =Intravascular ultrasound = Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a specialized form of echocardiography that uses a catheter to insert the ultrasound probe inside blood vessels. This is commonly used to measure the size of blood vessels and to measure the internal diameter of the blood vessel. For example, this can be used in a coronary angiogram to assess the narrowing of the coronary artery. If the catheter is retraced in a controlled manner, then an internal map can be generated to see the contour of the vessel and its branches. =Strain rate imaging (deformation echocardiography)= Strain rate imaging is an ultrasound method for imaging regional differences in contraction (dyssynergy) in for instance iscemic heart disease or dyssynchrony due to Bundle branch block. Strain rate imaging measures either regional systolic deformation (strain) or the rate of regional deformation (strain rate). The methods used are either tissue Doppler or Speckle tracking echocardiography. =Three-dimensional echocardiography= Three-dimensional echocardiogram of a heart viewed from the apex Three- dimensional echocardiography (also known as four-dimensional echocardiography when the picture is moving) is now possible, using a matrix array ultrasound probe and an appropriate processing system. This enables detailed anatomical assessment of cardiac pathology, particularly valvular defects, and cardiomyopathies. The ability to slice the virtual heart in infinite planes in an anatomically appropriate manner and to reconstruct three-dimensional images of anatomic structures make it unique for the understanding of the congenitally malformed heart. Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography can be used to guide the location of bioptomes during right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies, placement of catheter-delivered valvular devices, and in many other intraoperative assessments. Three-dimensional echocardiography technology may feature anatomical intelligence, or the use of organ-modeling technology, to automatically identify anatomy based on generic models. All generic models refer to a dataset of anatomical information that uniquely adapts to variability in patient anatomy to perform specific tasks. Built on feature recognition and segmentation algorithms, this technology can provide patient-specific three-dimensional modeling of the heart and other aspects of the anatomy, including the brain, lungs, liver, kidneys, rib cage, and vertebral column.Rodriguez, Gall. ‚ÄúInnovations Revolutionaize Medical Imaging‚Äù. NEMA electroindustry. =Contrast echocardiography= Contrast echocardiography, or contrast-enhanced ultrasound is the addition of an ultrasound contrast medium, or imaging agent, to traditional ultrasonography. The ultrasound contrast is made up of tiny microbubbles filled with a gas core and protein shell. This allows the microbubbles to circulate through the cardiovascular system and return the ultrasound waves, creating a highly reflective image. There are multiple applications in which contrast-enhanced ultrasound can be useful. The most commonly used application is in the enhancement of LV endocardial borders for assessment of global and regional systolic function. Contrast may also be used to enhance visualization of wall thickening during stress echocardiography, for the assessment of LV thrombus, or for the assessment of other masses in the heart. Contrast echocardiography has also been used to assess blood perfusion throughout myocardium in the case of coronary artery disease. Accreditation Echocardiography can at many times be subjective, meaning that the person performing the echo may have personal input that affects the interpretation of the findings. This leads to so-called \\"inter-observer variability\\", where different echocardiographers might produce different reports when examining the same images. This necessitated the development of accreditation programs all around the world. The aim of such programs is to standardize the practice of echocardiography and to ensure that practitioners have the proper training prior to practicing echocardiography which will eventually limit inter-observer variability. =Europe= At the European level ESCardio individual and laboratory accreditation is provided by the European Association of Echocardiography (EAE). There are three subspecialties for individual accreditation: Adult Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE), Adult Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) and Congenital Heart Disease Echocardiography (CHD). =UK= In the UK, accreditation is regulated by the British Society of Echocardiography. Accredited radiographers, sonographers, or other professionals are required to pass a mandatory exam. BSEcho - Exam =United States= The \\"Intersocietal Accreditation Commission for Echocardiography‚Äù (IAC) sets standards for echo labs across the US. Cardiologists and sonographers who wish to have their laboratory accredited by IAC must comply with these standards. The purpose of accreditation is to maintain quality and consistency across echocardiography labs in the United States. Accreditation is offered in adult and pediatric transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, as well as adult stress and fetal echo. Accreditation is a two-part process; first, each facility will conduct a detailed self-evaluation, paying close attention to the IAC standards and Guidelines. The facility will then complete the application and submit actual case studies to the board of directors for review. Once all requirements have been met, the lab will receive IAC certification. IAC certification is a continual process and must be maintained by the facility, this may include audits or site visits by the IAC. There are several states in which Medicare and/or private insurance carriers are requiring either the accreditation of the laboratory and/or sonographer credentialing for reimbursement of echocardiograms. There are two credentialing bodies in the United States for sonographers, the Cardiovascular Credentialing International (CCI), established in 1968, and the American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography (ARDMS), established in 1975. Both CCI and ARDMS have earned the prestigious ANSI-ISO 17024 accreditation for certifying bodies from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Accreditation is granted through the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Recognition of ARDMS programs in providing credentials has also earned the ARDMS accreditation with the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA). The NCCA is the accrediting arm of the National Organization for Competency Assurance (NOCA). Under both credentialing bodies, sonographers must first document completion of prerequisite requirements, which contain both didactic and hands-on experience in the field of ultrasound. Applicants must then take a comprehensive exam demonstrating knowledge in both the physics of ultrasound and the clinical competency related to their specialty. Credentialed sonographers are then required to maintain competency in their field by obtaining a certain number of Continuing Medical Education credits, or CME's. In 2009, New Mexico and Oregon became the first two states to require licensure of sonographers. The American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) is a professional organization made up of physicians, sonographers, nurses, and scientists involved in the field of echocardiography. One of the most important roles that the ASE plays is providing their recommendations through the ASE Guidelines and Standards, providing a resource and educational opportunities for sonographers and physicians in the field. There have been various institutes who are working on use of Artificial intelligence in Echo but they are at a very early stage and still needs full development.

It was founded in 1922 in Switzerland by a group of ecumenically oriented, mainly Lutheran theologians and ministers led by liberal theologian Friedrich Rittelmeyer, who had been the most prominent representative of liberal Lutheranism in Germany during the First World War and whose early theological work had focused on the concept of a socially engaged \\"Christianity of deeds\\" (Tatchristentum).Claudia Becker, Attempts of religious renewal in the modern trend by the example of the evangelic theologian Friedrich Rittelmeyer (1872‚Äì1938), Ph.D. dissertation, Freie Universit√§t Berlin, 2000. Abstract (English) and text (German)Johannes Hemleben, Rudolf Steiner: A documentary biography, Henry Goulden Ltd, 1975, , pp. 134‚Äì138 (German edition: Rowohlt Verlag, 1990, ) Rittelmeyer and the other founders were inspired by Rudolf Steiner, the Austrian philosopher and founder of anthroposophy.Friedrich Rittelmeyer, Rudolf Steiner Enters My Life, The community has its historical roots partially in the broader liberal Christian tradition, and partially in the esoteric and gnostic tradition as well as German new humanism; while inspired by anthroposophy, Steiner emphasized that The Christian Community was a separate movement founded by Rittelmeyer, and most anthroposophists are not members of The Christian Community. Christian Community congregations exist as financially independent groups with regional and international administrative bodies overseeing their work. There are approximately 100,000 worldwide. The international headquarters are in Berlin, Germany. Its first priests included three women, and it was one of the first Christian denominations to practise the ordination of women.Gertrud Sp√∂rri, Die Frau im Priesterberuf, Stuttgart 1929 Women such as Maria Darmst√§dter played a major role in the development of The Christian Community.Peter Selg, From Gurs to Auschwitz: The Inner Journey of Maria Krehbiel-Darmst√§dter, Great Barrington, 2013 The Christian Community is led by the \\"circle of priests,\\" with leaders known as coordinators appointed within the circle. A first coordinator (Erzoberlenker) is consulted by two second coordinators (Oberlenkers). There are also third coordinators (Lenkers) on the regional level and a synod of priests. The Christian Community is primarily a liturgical community, and practises freedom of teaching. It does not have an official theology or articles of belief, does not accept the concept of Christian dogmas, and does not engage in missionary work. The community also views other religions as equally valid as Christianity. Its rejection of Christian dogmas and its views of other religions have led some theologians of other denominations to question whether The Christian Community is truly Christian.\\"Zur Frage der Christlichkeit der Christengemeinschaft ‚Äì Beitr√§ge zur Diskussion\\", Stuttgart, Evang. Oberkirchenrat (Evangelical Church in Germany), 2004 The Christian Community in Germany was banned by the Nazis in 1941 and its leader Emil Bock imprisoned due to the community's alleged \\"Jewish\\" and \\"Masonic\\" nature, but the community continued its activities in Switzerland and England, and was reestablished in West Germany after the war. Practice Maria Darmst√§dter, who had converted from Judaism to Lutheranism and then joined the Christian Community, was one of the community's first and most influential members, contributing significantly to its liturgy The Christian Community does not require its members to conform to any specific teaching or behaviour.Tom Ravetz: Free From Dogma. Theological Reflections in The Christian Community. Edinburgh 2009 Seven sacraments are celebrated within the Community: the Eucharist, generally called the Act of Consecration of Man, and six other sacraments: Baptism, Confirmation, Marriage, The Last Anointing, Sacramental Consultation (replacing Confession), and Ordination. There is also a special Sunday service for children of school age.Evelyn Francis Capel and Tom Ravetz, Seven Sacraments in the Christian Community, Floris Books, 1999 Rituals and sacraments are the same wherever they are celebrated. Services are generally celebrated in the language of the country in which they celebrated. The Act of Consecration of Man lasts approximately one hour. Sunday services are longer than weekday services because they contain a sermon in addition to holy communion. For the sacramental wine used in communion non-fermented grape juice is used rather than alcoholic wine. Three Christmas services are celebrated, one on December 24 (at midnight) and two on December 25. There are also added prayers for different liturgical seasons of the year. Some chapels have an organ, and occasionally the organ has quarter tones in addition to the conventional (equal temperament) tuning. Tenets The Christian Community practices a complete freedom of teaching. The Priests may exert this freedom of teaching, provided that they do not contradict the sacraments which they celebrate. There is no official theology, nor articles of belief. Whatever is taught or written is a personal view.The Christian Community ‚Äì An Introduction by Michael Tapp, retired priest in The Christian Community Basic tenets of some priests of the Christian Community are 1) free will, 2) reincarnation and 3) focus on Christ. For example, Jesus of Nazareth is seen as merely a physical vessel that enabled the spiritual being called Christ to influence the world. The ideology of some priests of the Christian Community could be summarized with the following points: * Modern man requires modern religion (movement) * The Soul is immortal via re-incarnation * Jesus and Christ are separate entities, focus is on Christ * Christ is both, external and internal reality (Christ is not only ‚Äòout there‚Äô but at the same time ‚Äòin here‚Äô) * The New Testament should have priority over other documents in Christianity * No missionary work or public marketing should be done because finding this religion should be based on free will.

In 1949, he became the first President of the German Democratic Republic, an office abolished upon his death.Rolf Badst√ºbner and Wilfried Loth (eds) Wilhelm Pieck ‚Äì Aufzeichnungen zur Deutschlandpolitik 1945‚Äì1953, Berlin: Wiley-VCH, 1994 His successor as head of state was Walter Ulbricht, who served as chairman of the Council of State. Biography =Provenance and early years= Pieck was born as the son of the coachman Friedrich Pieck and his wife Auguste in the eastern part of Guben, Germany,Wilhelm Pieck timeline Retrieved 10 June 2010 which is now Gubin, Poland. Two years later, his mother died. The father soon married the washerwoman Wilhelmine Bahro. After attending elementary school, the young Wilhelm completed a four-year carpentry apprenticeship. As a journeyman, he joined the German Timber Workers Association in 1894. As a carpenter, in 1894 Pieck joined the wood-workers' federation, which steered him towards joining the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) the following year. Pieck became the chairman of the party urban district in 1899, and in 1906 became full-time secretary of the SPD. In 1914, he moved to a three-room apartment in Berlin- Steglitz. By now he had his own study with many shelves full of books. In May 1915, he was arrested at the big women's demonstration in front of the Reichstag and kept in \\"protective custody\\" until October. As Bremen Party secretary in 1916, Pieck had asked Anton Pannekoek to continue teaching socialist theory in the party school. Although the majority of the SPD supported the German government in World War I, Pieck was a member of the party's left wing, which opposed the war. Pieck's openness in doing so led to his arrest and detention in a military prison. After being released, Pieck briefly lived in exile in Amsterdam. Upon his return to Berlin in 1918, Pieck joined the newly founded Communist Party of Germany (KPD). On 16 January 1919 Pieck, along with Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht was arrested while meeting at Berlin Eden Hotel. Liebknecht and Luxemburg were then killed while \\"being taken to prison\\" by a unit of Freikorps.Wolfe, Bertram D. in introduction to \\"The Russian Revolution\\" Luxemburg p. 18 1967. While the two were being murdered, Pieck managed to escape. In 1922, he became a founding member of the International Red Aid, serving first on the executive committee. In May 1925, he became the chairman of the Rote Hilfe. =Nazi years and Moscow exile= On 4 March 1933, one day before the Reichstag election, Pieck's family left their Steglitz apartment and moved into a cook's room. His son and daughter had been in the Soviet Union since 1932 while Elly Winter was still in Germany. At the beginning of May 1933, he left first to Paris and then to Moscow. In Moscow, Pieck served the Communist Party in a variety of capacities. From 1935 until 1943, he held the position of Secretary of the Communist International. In 1943 Pieck was among the founders of the National Committee for a Free Germany, which planned for the future of Germany after World War II. On 22 June 1941 Pieck and his family were in their country house on the outskirts of Moscow. Pieck came downstairs at six o'clock to his children's bedroom and said: \\"Children, get up, it was announced on the radio that war is over. Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, but that will be the end\\". In March 1942 the family was able to return there after the Soviet Armed Forces won the Battle of Moscow. =Home to the Soviet occupation zone= At the conclusion of the war in 1945 Pieck returned to Germany with the victorious Red Army.Eric D. Weitz, Creating German Communism, 1890‚Äì1990: From Popular Protests to Socialist State. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997 A year later, he helped engineer the merger of the eastern branches of the KPD and SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. He was elected as the merged party's co-chairman, alongside former SPD leader Otto Grotewohl. =President of East Germany= In October 1949, the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Pieck was elected president of the new country. He served as East Germany's first (and last) president until his death in 1960.David Priestand, Red Flag: A History of Communism,\\" New York: Grove Press, 2009 He lost the chairmanship of the ruling SED (party) in 1950, when Walter Ulbricht became the party's first secretary. Nonetheless, due to Joseph Stalin's trust in him, he retained his other posts. =Last years= Pieck was already 73 years old at the time of his initial election as president. Although he nominally held the second highest state post in the GDR (behind Prime Minister Grotewohl) and served as SED co-chairman for the first four years of the party's existence, he never played a major role in the party. On 13 July 1953, he suffered a second stroke. He also had progressive liver cirrhosis and existing ascites. A detailed medical report composed before the second stroke mentioned mild paralysis on the right, a slight drooping of the corner of the mouth, breathing wheezing or snoring, slowed down pulse, tone of the limb musculature lowered ...\\".Der Spiegel, 22 July 1953 In August 1960 he moved to a new summer residence, the converted former mansion of the Hermann G√∂ring Leibf√∂rsters near \\"Karinhall\\".DER SPIEGEL ‚Äì Personalien ‚Äì 24 August 1960 Pieck lived at Majakowskiring 29, Pankow, East Berlin. Family He was married to Christine H√§fker, a garments worker whom he met in a large dance hall in Bremen. At first, her parents did not want her to go out with a \\"red\\", but once she was pregnant, she was allowed to marry Wilhelm on 28 May 1898, on the condition that a traditional wedding in a church would still take place. On the wedding day Christine waited impatiently for Pieck to arrive at the church. At the last minute, he finally did, still carrying communist leaflets. In November 1936, his wife contracted pneumonia for the third time, dying on 1 December of the same year. The Piecks' daughter, Elly Winter (1898‚Äì1987), held various posts in the SED and East German government. Their son Arthur Pieck (1899‚Äì1970) served as head of the East-German national airline Interflug from 1955‚Äì1965, after having held various administrative posts in East Germany, for instance at the German Economic Commission. The youngest child, Eleonore Staimer, (1906‚Äì1998), worked as a party official and, for a time, as a diplomat.

Ambrosius Holbein (1519) Thomas Murner, OFM (24 December 1475c. 1537) was a German satirist, poet and translator. He was born at Oberehnheim (Obernai) near Strasbourg. In 1490 he entered the Franciscan order, and in 1495 began travelling, studying and then teaching and preaching in Freiburg-im-Breisgau, Paris, Cracow and Strasbourg itself. The emperor Maximilian I crowned him in 1505 poeta laureatus; in 1506, he was created doctor theologiae, and in 1513 was appointed custodian of the Franciscan monastery in Strasbourg, an office which he was forced to vacate the following year for having published a scurrilous book. Later in life, in 1518, he began the study of jurisprudence at the University of Basel, and in 1519 took the degree of doctor juris. In the summer of 1523, at the invitation of Henry VIII, he went to the Kingdom of England, where his writings had caught the attention of Thomas More. John Headley credits Murner for making More aware of the radical nature of Martin Luther's ecclesiology. Henry VIII felt that Murner was an important orthodox influence in Strasbourg and give him ¬£100 and a letter to the city magistrates. After this stay, and a journey in Italy, he again settled in Strasbourg, but, disturbed by the Protestant Reformation, went into exile at Lucerne in Switzerland in 1526. In 1533 he was appointed priest of Oberehnheim, where he died in 1537, or, according to some accounts, in 1536. Murner was an energetic and passionate character, but made enemies wherever he went. There is little human kindness in his satires, which were directed against the corruption of the times, the Reformation, and especially against Martin Luther. His most powerful satire‚Äîthe most virulent German satire of the period‚Äîis Von dem grossen Lutherischen Narren wie ihn Doctor Murner beschworen hat (\\"On the Great Lutheran Fool\\", 1522). Others included Die Narrenbeschw√∂rung (1512); Die Schelmenzunft (1512); Die G√§uchmatt, which treats of enamoured fools (1519), and a translation of Virgil's Aeneid (1515) dedicated to the emperor Maximilian I. Murner also wrote the humorous Chartiludium logicae for the teaching of logic (1507) and the Ludus studentum Friburgensium (1511), besides a translation of Justinian's Institutiones (1519). Murner's satires were edited in the 1840s by Johann Scheible.

While at Cambridge, Mirrlees developed a close relationship with famous classicist Jane Ellen Harrison, Mirrlees' tutor and later her friend and collaborator. Mirrlees and Harrison lived together from 1913 until the latter's death in 1928. Although they divided their time mainly between the United Kingdom and France, often returning to Paris to continue Harrison's medical treatments, their travels also took them to other European countries. Both of them studied Russian, Mirrlees earning a Diploma in Russian from the √âcole des Langues Orientales of Paris, and went on to collaborate on translations from the Russian. Mirrlees and Harrison visited Spain in 1920, and there took Spanish lessons. After Harrison's death, Mirrlees converted to Catholicism. In 1948, Mirrlees moved to South Africa and remained there until 1963, when the first volume of her \\"extravagant biography\\" of Sir Robert Bruce Cotton was published (the second volume is unpublished). Two volumes of poetry, Poems and Moods and Tensions, were also privately published. Mirrlees was a friend of Virginia Woolf, who described her in a letter as \\"her own heroine ‚Äì capricious, exacting, exquisite, very learned, and beautifully dressed.\\" Her circle of celebrity friends also included T. S. Eliot; Gertrude Stein, who mentions Mirrlees in Everybody's Autobiography; Bertrand Russell; and Lady Ottoline Morrell. Mirrlees died in Thames Bank, Goring, England, in 1978, aged 91.Hope Mirrlees on the Web. Writing Mirrlees' 600-line modernist poem, Paris: A Poem, published in 1920 by Leonard and Virginia Woolf's Hogarth Press, was the subject of considerable study by scholar Julia Briggs, and is considered by some literary critics to have had an influence on the work of her friend, T. S. Eliot, and on that of Virginia Woolf.Bruce Bailey, \\"A Note on The Waste Land and Hope Mirrlees' Paris\\", T.S. Eliot Newsletter (Fall 1974): 3‚Äì4.Julia Briggs, \\"Modernism‚Äôs Lost Hope: Virginia Woolf, Hope Mirrlees and the printing of Paris\\" in Reading Virginia Woolf, Edinburgh University Press, 2006. Mirrlees set her first novel, Madeleine: One of Love's Jansenists (1919), in and around the literary circles of the 17th Century Pr√©cieuses, and particularly those salons frequented by Mlle de Scud√©ry. Mirrlees later used medieval Spanish culture as part of the background of her second novel, The Counterplot (1924). Lud-in-the-Mist was reprinted in 1970 in mass-market paperback format by Lin Carter, without the author's permission, for the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series, and then again by Del Rey in 1977. The \\"unauthorised\\" nature of the 1970 reprint is explained by the fact that, as Carter indicated in his introduction, he and the publishing company could not even ascertain whether the author was alive or dead, \\"since our efforts to trace this lady [Mirrlees] have so far been unsuccessful.\\" Since 2000, Mirrlees' work has undergone another resurgence in popularity, marked by new editions of her poetry, an entry in the Dictionary of National Biography and several scholarly essays by critic Julia Briggs, new introductions to Lud-in- the-Mist by writer Neil Gaiman and scholar Douglas A. Anderson, essays and a brief biography by writer Michael Swanwick, an artist-book facsimile reprint of Paris, a poem by printer and publisher Hurst Street Press, and translations of Lud-in-the-Mist into German and Spanish. Joanna Russ wrote a short story, The Zanzibar Cat (1971), in homage to Hope Mirrlees and as a critique of Lud- in-the-Mist ‚Äì and indeed the entire genre of fantasy, describing Fairyland \\"half in affectionate parody, but the other half very seriously indeed\\". Hope- in-the-Mist, a book-length study of Mirrlees and her work by Michael Swanwick, was published by Temporary Culture in 2009. The Collected Poems of Hope Mirrlees was published by Fyfield Books (Carcanet Press) in 2011 (edited by Sandeep Parmar).

Filmed in Argentina in 1971 on a budget of $30,000,Joan Hawkins, Cutting Edge: Art-Horror and the Horrific Avant-Garde, p. 136 (University of Minnesota Press, 2000). it depicted the actions of a Manson-esque murder cult, and was shot mainly without sound due to the actors understanding very little English. The film's financier, Jack Bravman, took an out-of-court settlement from American International Pictures to allow it to use the title Slaughter for its Blaxploitation film starring Jim Brown. Some sources state that the Findlays' film received an extremely limited theatrical release, while others indicate it was never screened theatrically at all under its original title. In any event, independent low-budget distributor and sometime producer Allan Shackleton took the film and shelved it for four years‚Äîbut was inspired to release it with a new ending, unbeknownst to the original filmmakers, after reading a newspaper article in 1975 on the rumor of snuff films produced in South America, and deciding to cash in on the urban legend. He added a new ending, directed in a v√©rit√© style by Simon Nuchtern, in which a woman is brutally murdered and dismembered by a film crew, supposedly the crew of Slaughter.\\"The Curse of her filmography: Roberta Findlay's grindhouse legacy\\", New York Press, July 27, 2005 The new footage purportedly showed an actual murder, and was spliced onto the end of Slaughter with an abrupt cut suggesting that the footage was unplanned and the murder authentic. This new version of the film was released under the title Snuff, with the tagline \\"The film that could only be made in South America... where Life is CHEAP!\\"Horrorwatch : Snuff Shackleton also removed all other credits from the film to increase the air of mystery surrounding its production. Controversy Distributor Shackleton reportedly hired fake protesters to picket movie theaters showing the film. Although the film was exposed as a hoax in Variety in 1976, it became popular in New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Boston.David A. Cook, Lost Illusions: American Cinema in The Shadow of Watergate and Vietnam, page 233 (University of California Press, Ltd., 2000). Twenty female protesters protested the film's return engagement in Rochester, New York at the Holiday Cin√©. Four of those protesters were arrested after they broke the poster frame to destroy the film's poster. The rumours persisted that the film showed a real-life murder. \\"[P]rompted by complaints and petitions from well-known writers, including Eric Bentley and Susan Brownmiller, and legislators\\", an investigationJoan Hawkins, Cutting Edge: Art-Horror and the Horrific Avant-Garde, p. 137 (University of Minnesota Press, 2000). into the circumstances surrounding the film's production was conducted by New York District Attorney Robert M.

Critical reception Richard Eder of the New York Times described it as \\"a horrendously written, photographed, acted, directed and dubbed bit of verdigris showing a group of devil-girls massacring people.\\" Joel Harley from HorrorNews.net wrote in his review of the film, \\"Were it not for that ending and the furore surrounding it, Snuff would surely have been forgotten a long time ago. Beyond the infamy, it's a stultifyingly average film.\\" Bill Gibron from PopMatters gave the film 3/10 stars, writing, \\"Unlike modern gorefests which strive for autopsy like realism in all facets of the F/X, Snuff is cheap and cheesy. While it[s] legend lives on, its realities end any speculation or scandal for that matter. No one really dies onscreen during the last few minutes of this movie. Your sense of gullibility, on the other hand...\\" Adam Tyner from DVD Talk called the film \\"basically unwatchable in its original form\\". Tyner criticized the film's unnecessarily dragged out scenes, lack of tension, and dubbed dialogue, which he called \\"sleepy, flat, lifeless, and howlingly inept all around, never even making an attempt to match any frantically flapping lips\\".

A defence minister is a cabinet official position in charge of a ministry of defense, which regulates the armed forces in sovereign states. The role of a defence minister varies considerably from country to country; in some the minister is only in charge of general budget matters and procurement of equipment; while in others the minister is also, in addition, an integral part of the operational military chain of command. A defence minister could be titled Minister for Defense, Minister of National Defense, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State for Defence or some similar variation. Background Prior to the 20th century, there were in most countries separate ministerial posts for the land forces (often called \\"minister for war\\") and the naval forces. In the interwar period, some countries created a separate ministerial post in charge of the air forces. After the end of World War II, the trend in most countries was to merge the several separate ministerial posts into a single defence minister in charge of all the armed forces. Another common reform which occurred at the end of World War II was to place the defence minister in a national security council, war cabinet, or a \\"Kitchen Cabinet\\", which allows the head of government or head of state to coordinate military, diplomatic and economic activities. The defence ministry in some countries is a very important ministry, sometimes considered more important than the foreign ministry. If war is common for a country, the defence minister's position is often assumed by the head of government. (For example, five Prime Ministers of Israel have held the Defense (Security) Ministry during their Premiership). In some nations there is a strong convention that the defence minister has to be a civilian, in order to highlight civilian control over the military, though it is not uncommon for the defence minister to have some (or even extensive) military experience. The People's Republic of China's Ministry of National Defence (MND) is relatively powerless; it does not have command over the People's Liberation Army. Command of the military belongs in the party and in the state Central Military Commission (CMC); the MND exists primarily as a liaison and protocol office to communicate with foreign militaries. Essentially, the MND exists only because most other nations have defence ministries, and for protocol and liaison purposes, the PRC needs to have an institution corresponding with those of other governments. However, the Minister of National Defence (who is usually a senior, although not always the highest ranking, military officer) is always a CMC member and usually a Vice Chairman and State Councillor, and this is an authoritative position.

The Sati or suttee was a historical practice found chiefly among Hindus in the northern and pre-modern regions of South Asia, in which a widow sacrifices herself by sitting atop her deceased husband funeral pyre.Feminist Spaces: Gender and Geography in a Global Context, Routledge, Ann M. Oberhauser, Jennifer L. Fluri, Risa Whitson, Sharlene MollettSophie Gilmartin (1997), The Sati, the Bride, and the Widow: Sacrificial Woman in the Nineteenth Century, Victorian Literature and Culture, Cambridge University Press, Vol. 25, No. 1, p. 141, Quote: \\"Suttee, or sati, is the obsolete Hindu practice in which a widow burns herself upon her husband's funeral pyre...\\" The extent to which sati was practised in history is not known with clarity. However, during the early modern Mughal period, it was notably associated with elite Hindu Rajput clans in western India, marking one of the points of divergence between Rajput culture and Islamic Mughal culture. In the early 19th century, the East India Company, in the process of extending its rule to most of India, initially tolerated the practice; William Carey, a British Christian evangelist, noted 438 incidences within a 30-mile (48-km) radius of the capital Calcutta, in 1803, despite its ban within Calcutta. Between 1815 and 1818, the number of incidents of sati in Bengal doubled from 378 to 839. Opposition to the practice of sati by British Christian evangelists, such as Carey, and Hindu reformers such as Ram Mohan Roy, ultimately led the British Governor-General of India Lord William Bentinck to enact the Bengal Sati Regulation, 1829, declaring the practice of burning or burying alive of Hindu widows to be punishable by the criminal courts. These were followed up with other legislation, countering what the British perceived to be interrelated issues involving violence against Hindu women, including: Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, 1856, Female Infanticide Prevention Act, 1870, and Age of Consent Act, 1891. Isolated incidents of sati were recorded in India in the late 20th century, leading the Indian government to promulgate the Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987, criminalising the aiding or glorifying of sati. Etymology and usage Orchha Sati Shrine Sati (Sanskrit: ‡§∏‡§§‡•Ä / ') is derived from the name of the goddess Sati, who self-immolated because she was unable to bear her father Daksha's humiliation of her and her husband Shiva. The term sati was originally interpreted as \\"chaste woman\\". Sati appears in Hindi and Sanskrit texts, where it is synonymous with \\"good wife\\"; the term suttee was commonly used by Anglo-Indian English writers. Sati designates therefore originally the woman, rather than the rite; the rite itself having technical names such as sahagamana (\\"going with\\") or sahamarana (\\"dying with\\"). Anvarohana (\\"ascension\\" to the pyre) is occasionally met, as well as satidaha as terms to designate the process. Satipratha is also, on occasion, used as a term signifying the custom of burning widows alive. Two other terms related to sati are sativrata and satimata. Sativrata, an uncommon and seldom used term, denotes the woman who makes a vow, vrata, to protect her husband while he is alive and then die with her husband. Satimata denotes a venerated widow who committed sati. The Indian Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987 Part I, Section 2(c) defines sati as the act or rite itself. History =Origins, models and comparisons= Earliest records Few reliable records exist of the practice before the time of the Gupta empire (c. 400 CE). Among those that do reference the practice, the lost works of the Greek historian Aristobulus of Cassandreia, who traveled to India with the expedition of Alexander the Great in c. 327 BCE, are preserved in the fragments of Strabo. There are different views by authors on what Aristobulus hears as widows of one or more tribes in Taxila performing self sacrifice on the husband's pyre, one author also mentions that widows who declined to die were held in disgrace. In contrast, Megasthenes who visited India during 300 BCE does not mention any specific reference to the practice. Diodorus writes about the wives of Ceteus, the Indian captain of Eumenes, competing for burning themselves after his death in the Battle of Paraitakene (317 BCE). The younger one is permitted to mount the pyre. According to Diodorus, Indians favoured love marriages, but many of them turned sour and wives poisoned husbands for their new lovers. Thus the practice was created to check these crimes. Modern historians believe Diodorus's source for this episode was the eyewitness account of the now lost historian Hieronymus of Cardia. Hieronymus' explanation of the origin of sati appears to be his own composite, created from a variety of Indian traditions and practices to form a moral lesson upholding traditional Greek values.Bosworth, pp. 174‚Äì187 Two other independent sources that mention widows who voluntarily joined their husbands' pyres as a mark of their love are Cicero and Nicolaus of Damascus. Some of the early Sanskrit authors like Da·πá·∏çin in Da≈õakumƒÅracarita and Banabhatta in Harshacharita mention that women who burnt themselves wore extravagant dresses. Bana tells about Yasomati who, after choosing to mount the pyre, bids farewell to her relatives and servants. She then decks herself in jewelry which she later distributes to others. Although Prabhakaravardhana's death is expected, Arvind Sharma suggests it is another form of sati. The same work mentions Harsha's sister Rajyasri trying to commit sati after her husband died.Social and Religious Reform Movements in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Institute of Historical Studies, Siba Pada Sen, 181 In Kadambari, Bana greatly opposes sati and gives examples of women who did not choose sahgamana. According to Axel Michaels, the first inscriptional evidence of the practice is from Nepal in 464 CE, and in India from 510 CE. The early evidence suggests that widow-burning practice was seldom carried out in the general population. Centuries later, instances of sati began to be marked by inscribed memorial stones called Sati stones. According to J.C. Harle, the medieval memorial stones appear in two forms ‚Äì viragal (hero stone) and satigal (sati stone), each to memorialize something different. Both of these are found in many regions of India, but \\"rarely if ever earlier in date than the 8th or 9th century\\".J. C. Harle (1970), An Early Indian Hero-Stone and a Possible Western Source, The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, No. 2 (1970), Cambridge University Press, pp. 159‚Äì164 Numerous memorial sati stones appear 11th-century onwards, states Michaels, and the largest collections are found in Rajasthan. There have been few instances of sati in the Chola Empire in South India. Vanavan Mahadevi, the mother of Rajaraja Chola I (10th century) and Viramahadevi the queen of Rajendra Chola I (11th century) both committed Sati upon their husband's death by ascending the pyre. Indo-European practices The archaeologist Elena Efimovna Kuzmina enlists clear parallels between the burial practices of the ancient Asiatic steppe Andronovo cultures (fl. 1800‚Äì1400 BCE) and the Vedic Age.See table 18 at In Kuzmina's archaeological definition, sati is understood as a double burial, the co-cremation of a man and a woman/wife, a feature to be found in both cultures. Kuzmina states that in the Androvo culture and Vedic age, the practice was never strictly observed and was symbolic. Practice in Hindu- influenced cultures outside India  The early 14th-century CE traveller of Pordenone mentions wife burning in Zampa (Champa), in nowadays south/central Vietnam. Anant Altekar states that sati spread with Hindu migrants to Southeast Asian islands, such as to Java, Sumatra and Bali. According to Dutch colonial records, this was however a rare practice in Indonesia, one found in royal households. Description of the Balinese rite of self-sacrifice or Suttee, in Frederik de Houtman's 1597 Verhael vande Reyse ... Naer Oost Indien In Cambodia, both the lords and the wives of a dead king voluntarily burnt themselves in the 15th and 16th centuries.The archeologist Georges Coed√®s made that inference on basis of some inscriptions in Cambodia,, also, see Yule & Burnell (2013), pp. 495 Hobson-Jobson: The Definitive Glossary of British India According to European traveller accounts, in 15th century Mergui, in present-day extreme south Myanmar, widow burning was practiced. A Chinese pilgrim from the 15th century seems to attest the practice on islands called Ma-i-tung and Ma-i (possibly Belitung (outside Sumatra) and Northern Philippines, respectively). According to the historian K.M. de Silva, Christian missionaries in Sri Lanka with a substantial Hindu minority population, reported \\"there were no glaring social evils associated with the indigenous religions-no sati, (...). There was thus less scope for the social reformer.\\" However, although sati was non-existent in the colonial era, earlier Muslim travellers such as Sulaiman al-Tajir reported that sati was optionally practiced, which a widow could choose to undertake.On al-Tajir, Ibn Batuta and Marco Polo , On al-Qazwini Cases of burning at funerals elsewhere, history and legends A well-known case is that of the 10th- century CE ship burial of the Rus' described by Ibn Fadlan. When a female slave had said she would be willing to die, her body was subsequently burned with her master on the pyre.However, in this ritual described by Ibn Fadlan, the slave girl is described as being stabbed to death prior to being burned. See p. 19, at Rituals such as widow sacrifice/widow burning have, presumably, prehistoric roots. Early 20th-century pioneering anthropologist James G. Frazer, for example, thought that the legendary Greek story of Capaneus, whose wife Evadne threw herself on his funeral pyre, might be a relic of an earlier custom of live widow-burning. In Book 10 of Quintus Smyrnaeus' Posthomerica (lines 467ff.), Oenone is said to have thrown herself on he burning pyre of her erstwhile husband Paris, or Alexander. The strangling of widows after their husbands' deaths are attested to from cultures as disparate as the Natchez people in present-day Louisiana, to a number of Pacific Islander cultures.On Natchez, and on Anatom in present day Vanuatu, Tahiti, Hawaii, Samoa , Fiji =Models for the spread of sati= Modern causative models How, when, where and why the practice of sati spread are complex and much debated questions, without a general consensus. The Eran pillar of Goparaja, in the reign of the Gupta king Bhanugupta, is considered as the earliest known Sati stone (circa 510 CE). According to Anand A. Yang, one model proposes taking into account the association of sati with the warrior elite in particular, sati only became really widespread during the Muslim invasions of India, and the practice of sati now acquired an additional meaning as a means to preserve the honour of women whose men had been slain. Jogan Shankar meanwhile states that sati gained more value during the period of Muslim conquests, especially with the variant of mass sati called jauhar, practiced especially among the Rajputs. This theory gains substance considering that the practice turned prevalent from 7th century onwards and declined to its elimination in 17th century to gain resurgence in Bengal in 18th century. However, this theory does not address the evidence of occasional incidences of sati in pre-Islamic times. The 510 CE inscription at Eran mentioning the wife of Goparaja, a vassal of Bhanugupta, burning herself on her husband's pyre is considered to be a Sati stone. Vidya Dehejia states that sati became regular only after 500 CE. He states that the practice originated among the Kshatriyas and remained mostly limited to the warrior class among Hindus. Yang adds that the practice was also emulated by those seeking to achieve high status of the royalty and the warriors. During the period of Muslim-Hindu conflict, Rajputs performed a distinct form of mass sati known as jauhar as a direct response to the onslaught they experienced.On attested Rajput practice of sati during wars, see, for example Military conflicts between Hindu and Muslim groups seems to have propelled the practice of sati into wider use as well and is roughly datable to the end of the 1st millennium and beginning of the 2nd millennium. Widowhood for Hindu women during the medieval period had extreme desolation and misery due to the influence of slavery practices in the Muslim ruled kingdoms. Widows chose sati sacrifice as an honourable solution rather than a shameful fate. William Jones, a judge of the British East India Company in 1785, describes the condition of slaves in Bengal during 18th century when the Sati practice re-emerged leading to the legislation on the practice: Alternate theories for the spread of sati include it expanding from Kshatriya caste to others castes, not because of wars, but on its own, as part of \\"Sanskritization\\" and a cultural phenomenon that conflated sati as a caste status symbol. This theory has been challenged because it does not explain the spread of sati from Kashatriyas to Brahmins, and Brahmins were not considered to be of inferior caste status than Kshatriyas.John Stratton Hawley (1994), Sati, the Blessing and the Curse, Oxford University Press, , pp. 162‚Äì167 Roshen Dalal postulated that its mention in some of the Puranas indicates that it slowly grew in prevalence from 5th-7th century and later became an accepted custom around 1000 AD among those of higher classes, especially the Rajputs. David Brick of Yale University claims it existed among the Brahmins of Kashmir in the later half of the first millennium. The author of the text may have mentioned practices existing in his own community, as Vishnu Smriti is believed to have been written in Kashmir. Enrica Garzilli states that the practice existed in the 1st century BCE amidst the Kathaka sect of the \\"black Yajurveda\\". The dates of other Dharmasastra texts mentioning sahagamana, states Brick, are not known with certainty. Though the priestly class throughout India was aware of them and the practice itself by 12th century. Another theory, by Hawley, is that sati started as a \\"nonreligious, ruling-class, patriarchal\\" ideology but later spread as a gilded status symbol of \\"valor\\", \\"honor\\" and \\"purity\\", jauhar which was dissimilar to Sati and was performed even if it was unknown if the husband had died to avoid becoming a captive and avoid \\"rape, torture and other ignominies\\" in internecine Rajput warfare, Muslim conquests and other foreign invasions before them. This was later adopted by Brahmins into the custom of Sati. He posits the enslavement of women by Greek conquerors may have started this variant of the practice. The above theories do not explain how and why sati practice resumed during the colonial era, particularly in significant numbers in colonial Bengal Presidency (modern Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bangladesh and Assam). Three theories have been proposed: first that sati was believed to be supported by Hindu scriptures by the 19th century, second that sati was encouraged by unscrupulous neighbors because it was a means of property annexation from a widow who had the right to inherit her dead husband's property under Hindu law and sati helped eliminate the inheritor, and the third theory being that poverty was so extreme during the 19th century that sati was a means of escape for a woman with no means or hope of survival.Uma Narayan (1997), Dislocating Cultures: Identities, Traditions, and Third World Feminism, Routledge, , pp. 59‚Äì65 Lata Mani states that all of the parties during the British colonial era that debated the issue, prescribed to the belief in a golden age of women followed by a decline in concurrence to the Muslim conquests. This discourse also resulted in promotion of a view of the British rescuing \\"Hindu India from Islamic tyranny\\".Mani, L. (1998). Contentious traditions : the debate on Sati in colonial India. Berkeley: University of California Press.pg 193 The British tried to present to the natives scriptural interpretations to say that Sati was not mandated, it being seen as part of their civilizing mission. Daniel Grey states that the understanding of origins and spread of sati were distorted in the colonial era because of a concerted effort to push \\"problem Hindu\\" theories in the 19th and early 20th centuries. =Mughal Empire= A painting by Mohammad RizƒÅ showing Hindu princess committing Sati against the wishes but reluctant approval of the Emperor Akbar. In the right foreground, attending the Sati on horseback, is the third son of Akbar, Prince DƒÅniyƒÅl. According to Annemarie Schimmel, the Mughal Emperor Akbar was averse to the practice of Sati; however, he expressed his admiration for \\"widows who wished to be cremated with their deceased husbands\\". He was averse to abuse, and in 1582, Akbar issued an order to prevent any use of compulsion in sati.XVII. \\"Economic and Social Developments under the Mughals\\" from Muslim Civilization in India by S. M. Ikram, edited by Ainslie T. Embree New York: Columbia University Press, 1964 According to M. Reza Pirbhai, a professor of South Asian and World history, it is unclear if a prohibition on sati was issued by Akbar, and other than a claim of ban by Monserrate upon his insistence, no other primary sources mention an actual ban. Instances of sati continued during and after the era of Akbar. For example, according to a poem, S≈´z u gudƒÅz (\\"Burning and melting\\") by Muhammad Riza Nau'i of Khasbushan (d. 1610), Akbar attempted to prevent a sati by calling a widow before him and offering her wealth and protection. The poet reports hearing the story from Prince DƒÅniyƒÅl, Akbar's third son. According to Arvind Sharma, a professor of Comparative Religion specializing on Hinduism, the widow \\"rejected all this persuasion as well as the counsel of the Brahmans, and would neither speak nor hear of anything but the Fire\\". Jahangir, who succeeded Akbar in the early 17th century, found sati prevalent among the Muslims of Rajaur (Kashmir). They had been converted to Islam by Sultan Firoz. During this era, many Muslims and Hindus were ambivalent about the practice, with Muslim attitude leaning towards disapproval. According to Sharma, the evidence nevertheless suggests that sati was admired by Hindus, but both \\"Hindus and Muslims went in large numbers to witness a sati\\". According to Reza Pirbhai, the memoirs of Jahangir suggest sati continued in his regime, was practiced by Hindus and Muslims, he was fascinated by the custom, and that those Kashmiri Muslim widows who practiced sati either immolated themselves or buried themselves alive with their dead husbands. Jahangir prohibited such sati and other customary practices in Kashmir. Aurangzeb issued another order in 1663, states Sheikh Muhammad Ikram, after returning from Kashmir, \\"in all lands under Mughal control, never again should the officials allow a woman to be burnt\\". The Aurangzeb order, states Ikram, though mentioned in the formal histories, is recorded in the official records of Aurangzeb's time. Although Aurangzeb's orders could be evaded with payment of bribes to officials, adds Ikram, later European travelers record that sati was not much practiced in Mughal empire, and that Sati was \\"very rare, except it be some Rajah's wives, that the Indian women burn at all\\" by the end of Aurangzeb's reign. The memoirs of European merchants and travelers, as well the colonial era Christian missionaries of British India described Sati practices under Mughal rulers. The Spanish missionary Domingo Navarrete wrote in 1670 of different styles of Sati during Aurangzeb's time. European travellers in the Mughal empire noted the practice, with Ralph Fitch noting in 1591: Fran√ßois Bernier gave the following description: =British and other European colonial powers= A Hindu widow burning herself with the corpse of her husband, 1820s by the London-based illustrator Frederic Shoberl from traveller accounts. Non-British colonial powers in India The Portuguese banned the practice in Goa after the conquest of Goa, however the practice continued in the region.To Cherish and to Share: The Goan Christian Heritage Paper presented at the 1991 Conference on Goa at the University of Toronto by: John Correia Afonso S.J. from: \\"South Asian Studies Papers\\", no 9; Goa: Goa Continuity and Change; Edited by Narendra K. Wagle and George Coelho; University of Toronto Centre for South Asian Studies 1995 The Dutch and the French banned it in Chinsurah and Pondich√©ry, their respective colonies. The Danes, who held the small territories of Tranquebar and Serampore, permitted it until the 19th century.In a minute from William Bentinck from 8 November 1829, he states that the Danish government at Serampore has not forbidden the rite, in conformity to the example of the British government, According to a couple of Danish historians, the general Danish ban on sati was issued conjointly with the British in 1829, The Danish strictly forbade, apparently early the custom of sati at Tranquebar, a colony they held from 1620‚Äì1845 (whereas Serampore (Frederiksnagore) was Danish colony merely from 1755‚Äì1845). Early British policy James Atkinson 1831 Widow Burning in India (August 1852), by the Wesleyan Missionary Society. The first official British response to sati was in 1680 when the Governor of Madras Streynsham Master intervened and prohibited the burning of a Hindu widow in Madras Presidency and attempts to limit or ban the practice had been made by individual British officers but without the backing of the British East India Company as it followed a policy of non interfence in Hindu religious affairs and there was no legislation or ban against Sati. The first formal British ban was imposed in 1798, in the city of Calcutta only. The practice continued in surrounding regions. In the beginning of the 19th century, the evangelical church in Britain, and its members in India, started campaigns against sati. The British activism should be considered in the light that British women abolitionists of the time were concerned with promoting the Christian education of the ‚Äúheathen‚Äù women as their distinctive contribution to the foreign missionary enterprise. Leaders of these campaigns included William Carey and William Wilberforce. These movements put pressure on the company to ban the act. William Carey, and the other missionaries at Serampore conducted in 1803‚Äì04 a census on cases of sati for a region within a 30-mile radius of Calcutta, finding more than 300 such cases there. Carey's actual figures for the year 1803 was 275; for the months April‚ÄìOctober 1804, the missionaries arrived at the figure 115. For 1803 and 1804 statistics More detailed on figures in The missionaries also approached Hindu theologians, who opined that the practice was encouraged, rather than enjoined by the Hindu scriptures. Serampore was a Danish colony, rather than British, and the reason why Carey started his mission in Danish India, rather than in British, was because the East India Company did not accept Christian missionary activity within their domains. In 1813, when the Company's Charter came up for renewal William Wilberforce, drawing on the statistics on sati collected by Carey and the other Serampore missionaries and mobilising public opinion against suttee, successfully ensured the passage of a Bill in Parliament legalising missionary activities in Indias, with a view to ending the practice through the religious transformation of Indian society. He stated in his address to the House of Commons: > Let us endeavour to strike our roots into the soil by the gradual > introduction and establishment of our own principles and opinions; of our > laws, institutions and manners; above all, as the source of every other > improvement, of our religion and consequently of our morals Elijah Hoole in his book Personal Narrative of a Mission to the South of India, from 1820 to 1828 reports an instance of Sati at Bangalore, which he did not personally witness. Another missionary, Mr. England, reports witnessing Sati in the Bangalore Civil and Military Station on 9 June 1826. However, these practices were very rare after the Government of Madras cracked down on the practice from the early 1800s (p. 82). The British authorities within the Bengal Presidency started systematically to collect figures on the practice in 1815. Principal reformers and 1829 ban Plaque of Last Legal Sati of Bengal, Scottish Church College, Kolkata The Principal campaigners against Sati were Christian and Hindu reformers such as William Carey and Ram Mohan Roy. In 1799 Carey, a Baptist missionary from England, first witnessed the burning of a widow on her husband's funeral pyre. Horrified by the practice, Carey and his coworkers Joshua Marshman and William Ward opposed sati from that point onward, lobbying for its abolishment. Known as the Serampore Trio, they published essays forcefully condemning the practice and presented an address against Sati to then Governor General of India, Lord Wellesley. In 1812, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, founder of Brahmo Samaj, began to champion the cause of banning sati practice. He was motivated by the experience of seeing his own sister-in-law being forced to commit sati. He visited Kolkata's cremation grounds to persuade widows against immolation, formed watch groups to do the same, sought the support of other elite Bengali classes, and wrote and disseminated articles to show that it was not required by Hindu scripture. He was at loggerheads with Hindu groups which did not want the Government to interfere in religious practices. From 1815‚Äì1818 Sati deaths doubled. Ram Mohan Roy launched an attack on Sati that ‚Äúaroused such anger that for awhile his life was in danger‚ÄùSharma 2001, pp. 6, 7. In 1821 he published a tract opposing Sati, and in 1823 the Serampore missionaries led by Carey published a book containing their earlier essays, of which the first three chapters opposed Sati. Another Christian missionary published a tract against Sati in 1927. Sahajanand Swami, the founder of the Swaminarayan sect, preached against the practice of sati in his area of influence, that is Gujarat. He argued that the practice had no Vedic standing and only God could take a life he had given. He also opined that widows could lead lives that would eventually lead to salvation. Sir John Malcolm, the Governor of Bombay supported Sahajanand Swami in this endeavor.Encyclopedia of Hinduism (2007) Constance A. Jones. Facts on File Inc. In 1828 Lord William Bentinck came to power as Governor of India. When he landed in Calcutta, he said that he felt \\"the dreadful responsibility hanging over his head in this world and the next, if‚Ä¶ he was to consent to the continuance of this practice (sati) one moment longer.\\"Marshman 1876 p. 757. Bentinck decided to put an immediate end to Sati. Ram Mohan Roy warned Bentinck against abruptly ending Sati.Sharma 2001, p. 9. However, after observing that the judges in the courts were unanimously in favor of it, Bentinck proceeded to lay the draft before his council.Dodwell 1932 p.141. Charles Metcalfe, the Governor's most prominent counselor expressed apprehension that the banning of Sati might be ‚Äúused by the disaffected and designing‚Äù as ‚Äúan engine to produce insurrection.‚Äù However these concerns didn't deter him from upholding the Governor's decision ‚Äúin the suppression of the horrible custom by which so many lives are cruelly sacrificed.‚ÄùDodwell 1932 p. 142. Thus on Sunday morning of 4 December 1829 Lord Bentinck issued Regulation XVII declaring Sati to be illegal and punishable in criminal courts. It was presented to William Carey for translation. His response is recorded as follows: ‚ÄúSpringing to his feet and throwing off his black coat he cried, 'No church for me to-day... If I delay an hour to translate and publish this, many a widow‚Äôs life may be sacrificed,' he said. By evening the task was finished.‚ÄùSharma pp. 7‚Äì8. On 2 February 1830 this law was extended to Madras and Bombay. The ban was challenged by a petition signed by ‚Äúseveral thousand‚Ä¶ Hindoo inhabitants of Bihar, Bengal, Orissa etc‚ÄùDodwell 1932 p. 141. and the matter went to the Privy Council in London. Along with British supporters, Ram Mohan Roy presented counter- petitions to parliament in support of ending Sati. The Privy Council rejected the petition in 1832, and the ban on Sati was upheld. After the ban, Balochi priests in the Sindh region complained to the British Governor, Charles Napier about what they claimed was a meddlement in a sacred custom of their nation. Napier replied: > Be it so. This burning of widows is your custom; prepare the funeral pile. > But my nation has also a custom. When men burn women alive we hang them, and > confiscate all their property. My carpenters shall therefore erect gibbets > on which to hang all concerned when the widow is consumed. Let us all act > according to national customs! Therafter, the account goes, no suttee took place.Napier, William. (1851) History Of General Sir Charles Napier's Administration Of Scinde. (p. 35).

Sati remained legal in some princely states for a time after it had been banned in lands under British control. Baroda and other princely states of Kathiawar Agency banned the practice in 1840,Proceedings ‚Äì Indian History Congress ‚Äì Volume 48 by Indian History Congress 1988 ‚Äì p. 481, see also whereas Kolhapur followed them in 1841,For 1841 proclamation, the princely state of Indore some time before 1843.See footnote According to a speaker at the East India House in 1842, the princely states of Satara, Nagpur and Mysore had by then banned sati. The Raja of Satara banned the practice already in 1839, Jaipur banned the practice in 1846, while Hyderabad, Gwalior and Jammu and Kashmir did the same in 1847.On Hyderabad and Gwalior , Jammu and Kashmir Awadh and Bhopal (both Muslim-ruled states) were actively suppressing sati by 1849.William Sleeman travelling in Awadh in 1849 says sati is prohibited there. Bhopal is reported in 1849 to engage actively in suppression of the rite, Cutch outlawed it in 1852 with Jodhpur having banned sati about the same time.Finishing writing in April 1853, John William Kaye says Jodhpur is the most recent important state to have banned the rite. The 1846 abolition in Jaipur was regarded by many British as a catalyst for the abolition cause within Rajputana; within 4 months after Jaipur's 1846 ban, 11 of the 18 independently governed states in Rajputana had followed Jaipur's example.A much quoted table given at page 270 in One paper says that in the year 1846‚Äì1847 alone, 23 states in the whole of India (not just within Rajputana) had banned sati.Index of official correspondences to some 20 princely states relative to the suppression of sati can be found in It was not until 1861 that Sati was legally banned in all the princely states of India, Mewar resisting for a long time before that time. The last legal case of Sati within a princely state dates from 1861 Udaipur the capital of Mewar, but as Anant S. Altekar shows, local opinion had then shifted strongly against the practice. The widows of Maharanna Sarup Singh declined to become sati upon his death, and the only one to follow him in death was a concubine. Later the same year, the general ban on sati was issued by a proclamation from Queen Victoria.Sati: A Historical Anthology by Andrea Major ‚Äì 2007‚Äì p. xvii On Mewar and Queen Victoria's 1861 proclamation, In some princely states such as Travancore, the custom of Sati never prevailed, although it was held in reverence by the common people. For example, the regent Gowri Parvati Bayi was asked by the British Resident if he should permit a sati to take place in 1818, but the regent urged him not to do so, since the custom of sati had never been acceptable in her domains. In another state, Sawunt Waree (Sawantvadi), the king Khem Sawant III (r. 1755‚Äì1803) is credited for having issued a positive prohibition of sati over a period of ten or twelve years.p. 182 in That prohibition from the 18th century may never have been actively enforced, or may have been ignored, since in 1843, the government in Sawunt Waree issued a new prohibition of sati. =Modern times= Legislative status of sati in present-day India \\"Ceremony of Burning a Hindu Widow with the Body of her Late Husband\\", from Pictorial History of China and India, 1851. Following the outcry after the sati of Roop Kanwar, the Indian Government enacted the Rajasthan Sati Prevention Ordinance, 1987 on 1 October 1987Trial by fire, Communalism Combat, Special Report, February‚ÄìMarch 2004, Volume 10, No. 96, Sabrang Communications. and later passed the Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987. The Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987 Part I, Section 2(c) defines sati as: > The burning or burying alive of ‚Äì :(i) any widow along with the body of her > deceased husband or any other relative or with any article, object or thing > associated with the husband or such relative; or :(ii) any woman along with > the body of any of her relatives, irrespective of whether such burning or > burying is claimed to be voluntary on the part of the widow or the women or > otherwise A shrine to wives of the Maharajas of Jodhpur who have committed sati. The palmprints are typical. The Prevention of Sati Act makes it illegal to support, glorify or attempt to commit sati. Support of sati, including coercing or forcing someone to commit sati, can be punished by death sentence or life imprisonment, while glorifying sati is punishable with one to seven years in prison. Enforcement of these measures is not always consistent. The National Council for Women (NCW) has suggested amendments to the law to remove some of these flaws.No. 2: Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987 National Council for Women, Proposed amendments to the 1987 Sati Prevention Act Prohibitions of certain practices, such as worship at ancient shrines, is a matter of controversy. Current situation There have been 30 cases of sati or attempted sati over a 44-year period (1943‚Äì1987) in India, the official number being 28.Letter, Panduranga Joshi Kulkarni, Women in World History A project of the Center for History and New Media, George Mason University. A well-documented case from 1987 was that of 18-year-old Roop Kanwar. In response to this incident, additional legislation against sati practice was passed, first within the state of Rajasthan, then nationwide by the central government of India. In 2002, a 65-year-old woman by the name of Kuttu died after sitting on her husband's funeral pyre in the Indian Panna district. On 18 May 2006, Vidyawati, a 35-year-old woman allegedly committed sati by jumping into the blazing funeral pyre of her husband in Rari-Bujurg Village, Fatehpur district in the State of Uttar Pradesh.The Times of India, \\"Woman commits 'sati' in UP village\\" , 19 May 2006. On 21 August 2006, Janakrani, a 40-year-old woman, burned to death on the funeral pyre of her husband Prem Narayan in Sagar district; Janakrani had not been forced or prompted by anybody to commit the act.BBC News, \\"India wife dies on husband's pyre\\", 22 August 2006. On 11 October 2008 a 75-year-old woman, Lalmati Verma, committed sati by jumping into her 80-year-old husband's funeral pyre at Checher in the Kasdol block of Chhattisgarh's Raipur district; Verma killed herself after mourners had left the cremation site. Scholars debate whether these rare reports of sati suicide by widows are related to culture or are examples of mental illness and suicide such as those found among women worldwide. In the case of Roop Kanwar, Dinesh Bhugra states that there is a possibility that the suicides could be triggered by \\"a state of depersonalization as a result of severe bereavement\\", then adds that it is unlikely that Kanwar had mental illness and culture likely played a role.D Bhugra and K Bhui (2007), Textbook of cultural psychiatry, Cambridge University Press, pages xvii-xviii However, Colucci and Lester state that none of the women reported by media to have committed sati had been given a psychiatric evaluation before their sati suicide and thus there is no objective data to ascertain if culture or mental illness was the primary driver behind their suicide.Erminia Colucci and David Lester (2012), Suicide and Culture: Understanding the Context, Hogrefe, , pp. 225‚Äì226 Inamdar, Oberfield and Darrell state that the women who commit sati are often \\"childless or old and face miserable impoverished lives\\" which combined with great stress from the loss of the only personal support may be the cause of a widow's suicide.SC Inamdar et al (1983), A suicide by self-immolation: psychological perspectives, International Journal of Social Psychiatry, Vol 29, pp. 130‚Äì133 Practice Accounts describe numerous variants in the sati ritual. The majority of accounts describe the woman seated or lying down on the funeral pyre beside her dead husband. Many other accounts describe women walking or jumping into the flames after the fire had been lit,See Kamat for two examples and some describe women seating themselves on the funeral pyre and then lighting it themselves.Primary Sources: Letter, Francois Bernier Women in World History, a project of the Center for History and New Media, George Mason University. =Variations in procedure= Although sati is typically thought of as consisting of the procedure in which the widow is placed, or enters, or jumps, upon the funeral pyre of her husband, slight variations in funeral practice have been reported here as well, by region. For example, the mid-17th-century traveler Tavernier claims that in some regions, the sati occurred by construction of a small hut, within which the widow and her husband were burnt, while in other regions, a pit was dug, in which the husband's corpse was placed along with flammable materials, into which the widow jumped after the fire had started.On hut, p. 170, on pit, p. 171 In mid-nineteenth-century Lombok, an island in today's Indonesia, the local Balinese aristocracy practiced widow suicide on occasion; but only widows of royal descent could burn themselves alive (others were stabbed to death by a kris knife first). At Lombok, a high bamboo platform was erected in front of the fire and, when the flames were at their strongest, the widow climbed up the platform and dived into the fire. =Live burials= Hindus only bury the bodies of those under the age of two. Those older than two are customarily cremated. A few European accounts provide rare descriptions of Indian sati that included the burial of the widow with her dead husband.The Representation of Sati: Four Eighteenth Century Etchings by Baltazard Solvyns by Robert L. Hardgrave, Jr. Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, a 17th-century world traveller and trader of gems, wrote that women were buried with their dead husbands along the Coast of Coromandel while people danced during the cremation rites. The 18th-century Flemish painter Frans Balthazar Solvyns provided the only known eyewitness account of an Indian sati involving a burial. Solvyns states that the custom included the woman shaving her head, music and the event was guarded by East India Trading company officials. He expresses admiration for the Hindu woman, but also calls the custom barbaric.The Representation of Sati: Four Eighteenth Century Etchings by Baltazard Solvyns, by Robert L. Hardgrave, Jr. The Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987 Part I, Section 2(c) includes within its definition of sati not just the act of burning a widow alive, but also that of burying her alive. =Compulsion= Sati is often described as voluntary, although in some cases it may have been forced. In one narrative account in 1785, the widow appears to have been drugged either with bhang or opium and was tied to the pyre which would have prevented her from escaping the fire, if she changed her mind. The account uses the word \\"likely\\". \\"A Hindu Suttee\\", 1885 book The British local press of the time proffered several accounts of alleged forcing of the woman. As an example, The Calcutta Review published accounts as the following one: Apart from accounts of direct compulsion, some evidence exists that precautions, at times, were taken so that the widow could not escape the flames once they were lit. Anant S. Altekar, for example, points out that it is much more difficult to escape a fiery pit that one has jumped in, than descending from a pyre one has entered on. He mentions the custom of the fiery pit as particularly prevalent in the Deccan and western India. From Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, where the widow typically was placed in a hut along with her husband, her leg was tied to one of the hut's pillars. Finally, from Bengal, where the tradition of the pyre held sway, the widow's feet could be tied to posts fixed to the ground, she was asked three times if she wished to ascend to heaven, before the flames were lit. The historian Anant Sadashiv Altekar states that some historical records suggest without doubt that instances of sati were forced, but overall the evidence suggests most instances were a voluntary act on the woman's part. =Symbolic sati= Funeral custom There have been accounts of symbolic sati in some Hindu communities. A widow lies down next to her dead husband, and certain parts of both the marriage ceremony and the funeral ceremonies are enacted, but without her death. An example in Sri Lanka is attested from modern times.Defying blessings of the goddess and the community: Disputes over sati (widow burning) in contemporary India by Masakazu Tanaka, section 6 in Tanaka's essay. Although this form of symbolic sati has contemporary evidence, it should by no means be regarded as a modern invention. For example, the ancient and sacred Atharvaveda, one of the four Vedas, believed to have been composed around 1000 BCE, describes a funerary ritual where the widow lies down by her deceased husband, but is then asked to descend, to enjoy the blessings from the children and wealth left to her. Jivit tradition In 20th-century India, a tradition developed of venerating jivit (living satis). A jivit is a woman who once desired to commit sati, but lives after having sacrificed her desire to die. Two famous jivit were Bala Satimata, and Umca Satimata, both living until the early 1990s.On these two women, and a general in-depth treatment of jivit tradition, see Prevalence Records of sati exist across the subcontinent. However, there seems to have been major differences historically, in different regions, and among communities. Furthermore, no reliable figures exist for the numbers who have died by sati, in general. The bride throws herself on her husband's funeral pyre. This miniature painting made in Iran originates from the period of the Safavid dynasty, first half 17th century. (Attributed to the painter Muhammad Qasim.) =Numbers= An 1829 report by a Christian missionary organization includes among other things, statistics on sati. It begins with a declaration that \\"the object of all missions to the heathen is to substitute for these systems the Gospel of Christ\\", thereafter lists sati for each year over the period 1815‚Äì1824 which totals 5,369, followed by a statement that a total of 5,997 instances of women were burned or buried alive in the Bengal presidency over the 10-year period, i.e., average 600 per year. In the same report, it states that the Madras and Bombay presidencies totaled 635 instances of sati over the same ten-year period. The 1829 missionary report does not provide its sources and acknowledges that \\"no correct idea can be formed of the number of murders occasioned by suttees\\", then states some of the statistics is based on \\"conjectures\\". According to Yang, these \\"numbers are fraught with problems\\". William Bentinck, in an 1829 report, stated without specifying the year or period, that \\"of the 463 satis occurring in the whole of the Presidency of Fort William, 420 took place in Bengal, Behar, and Orissa, or what is termed the Lower Provinces, and of these latter 287 in the Calcutta Division alone\\". For the Upper Provinces, Bentinck added, \\"in these Provinces the satis amount to forty three only upon a population of nearly twenty millions\\", i.e., average one sati per 465,000.Modern History Sourcebook: On Ritual Murder in India, 1829 by William Bentinck Within previously cited statistics from 1815‚Äì1824, the year 1816 had 442 reported incidents of sati, the only figure in that statistics on the 400-level =Social composition and age distribution= Anand Yang, speaking of the early nineteenth century CE, says that contrary to conventional wisdom, sati was not, in general, confined to being an upper class phenomenon, but spread through the classes/castes. In the 575 reported cases from 1823, for example, 41 percent were Brahmins, some 6 percent were Kshatriyas, whereas 2 percent were Vaishiyas, and 51 percent Sudras. In Banaras, though, in the 1815‚Äì1828 British records, the upper castes were only for two years represented with less than 70% of the total; in 1821, all sati were from the upper castes there. Yang notes that many studies seem to emphasize the young age of the widows who committed sati. However, by study of the British figures from 1815 to 1828, Yang states the overwhelming majority were ageing women: The statistics from 1825 to 1826 about two thirds were above the age of 40 when committing sati.For these statistics and in-depth treatment, see =Regional variations of incidence= Anand Yang summarizes the regional variation in incidence of sati as follows: Konkan/Maharashtra Narayan H. Kulkarnee believes that sati came to be practiced in medieval Maharashtra initially by the Maratha nobility claiming Rajput descent. Then, according to Kulkarnee, the practice of sati may have increased across caste distinctions as an honour-saving custom in the face of Muslim advances into the territory. But the practice never gained the prevalence seen in Rajasthan or Bengal, and social customs of actively dissuading a widow from committing sati are well established. Apparently not a single instance of sati is attested for the 17th and 18th centuries CE. Vijayanagara empire Several sati stones have been found in Vijayanagar empire. These stones were erected as a mark of a heroic deed of sacrifice of the wife and her husband towards the land. The sati stone evidence from the time of the empire is regarded as relatively rare; only about 50 are clearly identified as such. Thus, Carla M. Sinopoli, citing Verghese, says that despite the attention European travellers paid the phenomenon, it should be regarded as having been fairly uncommon during the time of the Vijayanagara empire. Madurai The Madurai Nayak dynasty (1529‚Äì1736 CE) seems to have adopted the custom in larger measure, one Jesuit priest observing in 1609 Madurai the burning of 400 women at the death of Nayak Muttu Krishnappa.On early rarity and Nayak adoption, , on Jesuit witness, Kongu Nadu The Kongu Nadu region of Tamil Nadu has the highest number of Veera Maha Sati (‡Æµ‡ØÄ‡Æ∞‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æö‡Æ§‡Æø) or Veeramathy temples (‡Æµ‡ØÄ‡Æ∞‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø) from all the native Kongu castes. Princely State of Mysore A few records exist from the Princely State of Mysore, established in 1799, that say permission to commit sati could be granted. Dewan (prime minister) Purnaiah is said to have allowed it for a Brahmin widow in 1805, whereas an 1827 eye- witness to the burning of a widow in Bangalore in 1827 says it was rather uncommon there. Gangetic plain In the Upper Gangetic plain, while sati occurred, there is no indication that it was especially widespread. The earliest known attempt by a government, that of Muhammad Tughlaq, to stop the practice took place in the Sultanate of Delhi in the 14th century.L. C. Nand, Women in Delhi Sultanate, Vohra Publishers and Distributors Allahabad 1989. In the Lower Gangetic plain, the practice may have reached a high level fairly late in history. According to available evidence and the existing reports of occurrences, the greatest incidence of sati in any region and period, in total numbers, occurred in Bengal and Bihar in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Nepal and Bali The earliest stone inscription in the Indian subcontinent relating to sati has been found in Nepal, dating from the 5th century, wherein the king successfully persuades his mother not to commit sati after his father dies.John Whelpton (2005), A History of Nepal, Cambridge University Press, , p. 19 This inscription suggests that sati was practised but not compulsory.DR Regmi (1983), Inscriptions of Ancient Nepal, , p. 11 Nepal formally banned sati in 1920.Human Rights Watch, Human Rights Violations in Nepal (1989), , p. 14 On the Indonesian island of Bali, sati (known as masatya) was practised by the aristocracy as late as 1903, until the Dutch colonial masters pushed for its termination, forcing the local Balinese princes to sign treaties containing the prohibition of sati as one of the clauses.A History of Modern Indonesia since c. 1300, by Merle Calvin Ricklefs, on forced treaties, see Early Dutch observers of the Balinese custom in the 17th century said that only widows of royal blood were allowed to be burned alive. Concubines or others of inferior blood lines who consented or wanted to die with their princely husband had to be stabbed to death before being burned. Terminology Lindsey Harlan, having conducted extensive field work among Rajput women, has constructed a model of how and why women who committed sati are still venerated today, and how the worshippers think about the process involved.This section is based on chapter 4, Essentially, a woman becomes a sati in three stages: # having been a pativrata, or dutiful wife, during her husband's life, # making, at her husband's death, a solemn vow to burn by his side, thus gaining status as a sativrata, and # having endured being burnt alive, achieving the status of satimata. =Pativrata= The pativrata is devoted and subservient to her husband, and also protective of him. If he dies before her, some culpability is attached to her for his death, as not having been sufficiently protective of him. Making the vow to burn alive beside him removes her culpability, as well as enabling her to protect him from new dangers in the afterlife. =Sativrata= In Harlan's model, having made the holy vow to burn herself, the woman becomes a sativrata, a transitional stage between the living and the dead, before ascending the funeral pyre. Once a woman had committed herself to becoming a sati, popular belief thought her endowed with many supernatural powers. Lourens P. Van Den Bosch enumerates some of them: prophecy and clairvoyance, and the ability to bless with sons women who had not borne sons before. The gifts from a sati were venerated as valuable relics, and in her journey to the pyre, people would seek to touch her garments to benefit from her powers. Lindsey Harlan probes deeper into the sativrata stage. As a transitional figure on her path to becoming a powerful family protector as satimata, the sativrata dictates the terms and obligations the family, in showing reverence to her, must observe in order for her to be able to protect them once she has become satimata. These conditions are generally called ok. A typical example of an ok is a restriction on the colours or types of clothing the family members may wear. Shrap, or curses, are also within the sativrata's power, associated with remonstrations on members of the family for how they have failed. One woman cursed her in-laws when they brought neither a horse nor a drummer to her pyre, saying that whenever in future they might have need of either (and many religious rituals require the presence of such a thing), it would not be available to them. =Satimata= After her death on the pyre, the woman is finally transformed into the shape of the satimata, a spiritual embodiment of goodness, with her principal concern being a family protector. Typically, the satimata manifests in the dreams of family members, for example to teach the women how to be good pativratas, having proved herself through her sacrifice that she was the perfect pativrata. However, although the satimata's intentions are always for the good of the family, she is not averse to letting children become sick, for example, or the cows' udders to wither, if she thinks this is an appropriate lesson to the living wife who has neglected her duties as pativrata. In scriptures David Brick, in his 2010 review of ancient Indian literature, states The earliest scholarly discussion of sati, whether it is right or wrong, is found in the Sanskrit literature dated to 10th- to 12th-century. The earliest known commentary on sati by Medhatithi of Kashmir argues that sati is a form of suicide, which is prohibited by the Vedic tradition. Vijnanesvara, of the 12th-century Chalukya court, and the 13th-century Madhvacharya, argue that sati should not to be considered suicide, which was otherwise variously banned or discouraged in the scriptures. They offer a combination of reasons, both in favor and against sati. In the following, a historical chronology is given of the debate within Hinduism on the topic of sati. =The oldest Vedic texts= The most ancient texts still revered among Hindus today are the Vedas, where the Sa·πÉhitƒÅs are the most ancient, four collections roughly dated in their composition to 1700‚Äì1100 BCE. In two of these collections, the Rigveda and the Atharvaveda there is material relevant to the discussion of sati. In the Rig Veda Claims about the mention of sati in Rig Veda vary. There are differing interpretations of one of the passages which reads: : ‡§á‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§®‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä‡§∞‡§µ‡§ø‡§ß‡§µ‡§æ‡§É ‡§∏‡•Å‡§™‡§§‡•ç‡§®‡•Ä‡§∞‡§æ‡§û‡•ç‡§ú‡§®‡•á‡§® ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§™‡§ø‡§∑‡§æ ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•Å  :‡§Ö‡§®‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§µ‡•ã.‡§Ö‡§®‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§µ‡§æ‡§É ‡§∏‡•Å‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§®‡§æ ‡§Ü ‡§∞‡•ã‡§π‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•Å ‡§ú‡§®‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ø‡•ã‡§®‡§ø‡§Æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡•á  (RV 10.18.7) This passage and especially the last of these words has been interpreted in different ways, as can be seen from various English translations: :May these women, who are not widows, who have good husbands, who are mothers, enter with unguents and clarified butter: :without tears, without sorrow, let them first go up into the dwelling. (Wilson, 1856) :Let these women, whose husbands are worthy and are living, enter the house with ghee (applied) as collyrium (to their eyes). :Let these wives first step into the pyre, tearless without any affliction and well adorned. 3.1 Women in Indo-Aryan Societies:Sati this translation is ascribed to Kane, pp. 199‚Äì200 (Kane, 1941) Verse 7 itself, unlike verse 8, does not mention widowhood, but the meaning of the syllables yoni (literally \\"seat, abode\\") have been rendered as \\"go up into the dwelling\\" (by Wilson), as \\"step into the pyre\\" (by Kane), as \\"mount the womb\\" (by Jamison/Brereton)Compare alternative translation by Jamison/Brereton: :These women here, non-widows with good husbands ‚Äì let them, with fresh butter as ointment, approach together. :Without tears, without afflictions, well-jeweled, let the wives first mount the womb. Stephanie W. Jamison, Joel P. Brereton: The Rigveda: 3-Volume Set. Oxford University Press, 2014. . p. 1401. digital format and as \\"go up to where he lieth\\" (by Griffith).Compare also alternative translation by Griffith: :Let these unwidowed dames with noble husbands adorn themselves with fragrant balm and unguent. :Decked with fair jewels, tearless, free from sorrow, first let the dames go up to where he lieth. Hymn XVIII. Various Deities., Rig Veda, tr. by Ralph T. H. Griffith (1896) A reason given for the discrepancy in translation and interpretation of verse 10.18.7, is that one consonant in a word that meant house, yonim agree (\\"foremost to the yoni\\"), was deliberately changed by those who wished claim scriptural justification, to a word that meant fire, yomiagne.O. P. Gupta, \\"The Rigveda: Widows don't have to burn\\", The Asian Age, 23 October 2002, available at Hindu-religion.net . In addition, the following verse, which is unambiguously about widows, contradicts any suggestion of the woman's death; it explicitly states that the widow should return to her house. :‡§â‡§¶‡•Ä‡§∞‡•ç‡§∑‡•ç‡§µ ‡§®‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§≠‡§ø ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï‡§Ç ‡§ó‡§§‡§æ‡§∏‡•Å‡§Æ‡•á‡§§‡§Æ‡•Å‡§™ ‡§∂‡•á‡§∑ ‡§è‡§π‡§ø  :‡§π‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§≠‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ß‡§ø‡§∑‡•ã‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§µ‡•á‡§¶‡§Ç ‡§™‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§®‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§Æ‡§≠‡§ø ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§¨‡§≠‡•Ç‡§•  (RV 10.18.8) :Rise, come unto the world of life, O woman ‚Äî come, he is lifeless by whose side thou liest. Wifehood with this thy husband was thy portion, who took thy hand and wooed thee as a lover. Dehejia states that Vedic literature has no mention of any practice resembling Sati. There is only one mention in the Vedas, of a widow lying down beside her dead husband who is asked to leave the grieving and return to the living, then prayer is offered for a happy life for her with children and wealth. Dehejia writes that this passage does not imply a pre-existing sati custom, nor of widow remarriage, nor that it is authentic verse because its solitary mention may also be explained as a later date insertion into the text.V Dehejia (1994), Editor: John Stratton Hawley, On this idea of discontuation, see Dehejia writes that no ancient or early medieval era Buddhist texts mention sati, and if the practice existed it would likely have been condemned by these texts. =1st-millennium BCE texts= Religious texts David Brick, a professor of South Asian Studies, states that neither sati nor equivalent terms such as sahagamana are ever mentioned in any Vedic literature (Samhitas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas, Upanishads), or in any of the early Dharmasutras or Dharmasastras. The Brahmana literature, one of the layers within the ancient Vedic texts, dated about 1000 BCE ‚Äì 500 BCE are entirely silent about sati according to the historian Altekar. Similarly, the Grhyasutras, a body of text devoted to ritual, with composition date about the time of the youngest within Brahmana literature, sati is not mentioned, either. What is mentioned concerning funeral rites, though, is that the widow is to be brought back from her husband's funeral pyre, either by his brother, or by a trusted servant. In the Taittiriya Aranyaka from about the same time, it is said that when leaving, the widow took from her husband's side such objects as his bow, gold and jewels (which previously would have been burnt with him), and a hope expressed that the widow and her relatives would lead a happy and prosperous life afterwards. According to Altekar, it is \\"clear\\" that the custom of actual widow burning had died out a long time previously at this stage. Nor is the practice of sati mentioned anywhere in the Dharmasutras, texts tentatively dated by Pandurang Vaman Kane to 600‚Äì100 BCE, while Patrick Olivelle thinks the bounds should be roughly 250‚Äì100 BCE instead.For extended dating debate, including Kane reference, see Not only is sati not mentioned in Brahmana and early Dharmasastra literature, Satapatha Brahmana explains that suicide by anyone is inappropriate (adharmic). This ≈öruti prohibition became one of the several basis for arguments presented against sati by 11th- to 14th-century Hindu scholars such as Medhatithi of Kashmir, :Therefore, one should not depart before one's natural lifespan. ‚Äì ≈öatapatha BrƒÅhma·πáa, 10.2.6.7 Thus, in none of the principal religious texts believed composed before the Common Era is there any evidence at all for a sanctioning of the practice of sati. It is wholly unmentioned, although the archaic Atharvaveda do contain hints of a funeral practice of symbolic sati. In addition, the twelfth-century CE commentary of Apararka, claiming to quote the Dharmasutra text Apastamba, it says that the Apastamba prescribes that if a widow has made a vow of burning herself (anvahorana, \\"ascend the pyre\\"), but then retracts her vow, she must expiate her sin by the penance ritual called Prajapatya-vrataOn 12th-century Apararka date, see for example, p. 75, On penance p. 207, in Justifications for the practice are given in the Vishnu Smriti, dated 6th-9th century CE by Patrick Olivelle: :When a woman's husband has died, she should either practice ascetic celibacy or ascend (the funeral pyre) after him. ‚Äî Vishnu Smriti, 25.14 Valmiki Ramayana The oldest portion of the epic Ramayana, the Valmiki Ramayana, is tentatively dated for its composition by Robert P. Goldman to 750‚Äì500 BCE.See in particular his discussion on the preceding pages of conclusion given at An important strand in Goldman's argument for the dating concerns which cities are considered capitals, and which are not Anant S. Altekar says that no instances of sati occur in this earliest, archaic part of the whole Ramayana. According to Ramashraya Sharma, there is no conclusive evidence of the sati practice in the Ramayana. For instance, Tara, Mandodari and the widows of Ravana, all live after their respective husband's deaths, though all of them announce their wish to die, while lamenting for their husbands. The first two remarry their brother-in-law. The only instance of sati appears in the Uttara Kanda ‚Äì believed to be a later addition to the original text ‚Äì in which Kushadhwaja's wife performs sati. The Telugu adaptation of the Ramayana, the 14th-century Ranganatha Ramayana, tells that Sulochana, wife of Indrajit, became sati on his funeral pyre. Mahabharata Instances of sati are found in the Mahabharata. Madri, the second wife of Pandu, immolates herself. She believes she is responsible for his death, as he had been cursed with death if he ever had intercourse. He died while performing the forbidden act with Madri; she blamed herself for not rejecting him, as she knew of the curse. Also, in the case of Madri the entire assembly of sages sought to dissuade her from the act, and no religious merit is attached to the fate she chooses against all advice. In the Musala-parvan of the Mahabharata, the four wives of Vasudeva are said to commit sati. Furthermore, as news of Krishna's death reaches Hastinapur, five of his wives choose to burn themselves. Against these stray examples within the Mahabharata of sati, there are scores of instances in the same epic of widows who do not commit sati, none of them blamed for not doing so.For this discussion, see for example, =Principal Smrtis, c. 200 BCE‚Äì1200 CE= Satigal (sati stone) near Kedareshvara Temple, Balligavi, Karnataka The four works, (200 BCE‚Äì200 CE), (200‚Äì500 CE), (100 BCE‚Äì400 CE) and the (700‚Äì1000 CE) are the principal Smrti works in the Dharma≈õƒÅstra tradition, along with the Parasara Smrti, composed in the latter period, rather than in the earlier. Earliest phase, c. 200 BCE‚Äì700 CE The first three principal smrtis, those of Manu, YƒÅj√±avalkya and NƒÅrada, do not contain any mention of sati. Emergence of debate on sati, 700‚Äì1200 CE =Later smritis and sati= Moriz Winternitz states that Brihaspati Smriti prohibits burning of widows. Brihaspati Smriti was authored after the three principal smritis of Manu, YƒÅj√±avalkya and NƒÅrada. Passages of the Parasara Smriti say: :If a woman adheres to a vow of ascetic celibacy (brahmacarya) after her husband has died, then when she dies, she obtains heaven, just like those who were celibate. Further, three and a half krores or however many hairs are on a human body ‚Äì for that long a time (in years) a woman who follows her husband (in death) shall dwell in heaven. ‚Äî Parasara Smriti, 4.29‚Äì31 Neither of these suggest sati as mandatory, but Parasara Smriti elaborates the benefits of sati in greater detail. =Liberation versus ascension to heaven= Within the dharmashastric tradition espousing sati as a justified, and even recommended, option to ascetic widowhood, there remained a curious conception worth noting the achieved status for a woman committing sati. Burning herself on the pyre would give her, and her husband, automatic, but not eternal, reception into heaven (svarga), whereas only the wholly chaste widow living out her natural life span could hope for final liberation (moksha) and breaking the cycle of rebirth. Thus, acknowledging that performing sati only achieved an inferior otherworldy status than successful widowhood could achieve, sati became recommended when coupled with a dismissal of the effective possibility for a widow to remain truly chaste. =Rules on Brahmin widows= While some smriti passages allow sati as optional, others forbid the practice entirely. Vij√±ƒÅne≈õvara (c. 1076‚Äì1127), an early Dharma≈õƒÅstric scholar, claims that many smriti call for the prohibition of sati among Brahmin widows, but not among other social castes. Vij√±ƒÅne≈õvara, quoting scriptures from Paithinasi and Angiras to support his argument, states: :\\"Due to Vedic injunction, a Brahmin woman should not follow her husband in death, but for the other social classes, tradition holds this to be the supreme Law of Women... when a woman of Brahmin caste follows her husband in death, by killing herself she leaders neither herself nor her husband to heaven.\\" However, as proof of the contradictory opinion of the smriti on sati, in his MitƒÅk·π£arƒÅ, Vij√±ƒÅne≈õvara argues Brahmin women are technically only forbidden from performing sati on pyres other than those of their deceased husbands. Quoting the YƒÅj√±avalkya Sm·πõti, Vij√±ƒÅne≈õvara states, \\"a Brahmin woman ought not to depart by ascending a separate pyre.\\" David Brick states that the Brahmin sati commentary suggests that the practice may have originated in the warrior and ruling class of medieval Indian society. In addition to providing arguments in support of sati, Vij√±ƒÅne≈õvara offers arguments against the ritual. Those who supported the ritual, did however, put restrictions on sati. It was considered wrong for women who had young children to care for, those who were pregnant or menstruating. A woman who had doubts or did not wish to commit sati at the last moment, could be removed from the pyre by a man, usually a brother of the deceased or someone from her husband's side of the family. =Evolution over time= David Brick, summarizing the historical evolution of scholarly debate on sati in medieval India, states: =Legend of goddess Sati= Although the myth of the goddess Sati is that of a wife who dies by her own volition on a fire, this is not a case of the practice of sati. The goddess was not widowed, and the myth is quite unconnected with the justifications for the practice. =Justifications for involuntary sati= Julia Leslie points to an 18th-century CE text on the duties of the wife by Tryambakayajvan that contains statements she regards as evidence for a sub-tradition of justifying strongly encouraged, pressured, or even forced sati. Although the standard view of the sati within the justifying tradition is that of the woman who out of moral heroism chooses sati, rather than choosing to enter ascetic widowhood,and thus, critically, sati regarded as an essentially voluntary act, the woman afterwards worthy of worship Tryambaka is quite clear upon the automatic good effect of sati for the woman who was a 'bad' wife: Thus, as Leslie puts it, becoming (or being pressured into the role of) a sati was, within Tryambaka thinking, the only truly effective method of atonement for the bad wife. =Exegesis scholarship against sati= Opposition to sati was expressed by several exegesis scholars such as the ninth- or tenth-century Kashmir scholar Medatithi ‚Äì who offers the earliest known explicit discussion of sati, the 12th- to 17th-century scholars Vijnanesvara, Apararka and Devanadhatta, as well as the mystical Tantric tradition, with its valorization of the feminine principle. Medhatithi Explicit criticisms were published by Medhatithi, a commentator on various theological works. He offered two arguments for his opposition. He considered sati a form of suicide, which was forbidden by the Vedas: :One shall not die before the span of one's life is run out. Medhatithi offered a second reason against sati, calling it against dharma (adharma). He argued that there is a general prohibition against violence of any form against living beings in the Vedic dharma tradition, sati causes death which is sufficient proof of violence, and thus sati is against Vedic teachings. Vijnanesvara Vijnanesvara presents both sides of the argument, for and against sati. He argues first that Vedas do not prohibit sacrifice aimed to stop an enemy and in pursuit of heaven, and sati for these reasons is thus not prohibited. He then presents two arguments against sati, calling it \\"unobjectionable\\". The first is based on hymn 10.2.6.7 of Satapatha Brahmana will forbids suicide. His second reason against sati is an appeal to relative merit between two choices. Death may grant a woman's wish to enter heaven with her dead husband, but living offers her the possibility of reaching moksha through knowledge of the Self through learning, reflecting and meditating. In Vedic tradition, moksha is of higher merit than heaven, because moksha leads to eternal, unsurpassed bliss while heaven is impermanent and smaller happiness. Living gives her an option to discover deeper, fulfilling happiness than dying through sati does, according to Vijnanesvara. Apararka Apararka acknowledges that Vedic scripture prohibits violence against living beings and \\"one should not kill\\"; however, he argues that this rule prohibits violence against another person, but does not prohibit killing oneself if one wants to. Thus sati is a woman's choice and it is not prohibited by Vedic tradition, argues Apararka. =Counter- arguments within Hinduism= Reform and bhakti movements within Hinduism favoured egalitarian societies, and in line with the tenor of these beliefs, generally condemned the practice, sometimes explicitly. The 12th-century Virashaiva movement condemned the practice.\\"About Lingayat\\" on lingayat.com Later, Sahajananda Swami, the founder of Vaishnavite Swaminarayana sampradaya preached against sati in the 18th century in western India. In a petition to the British East India Company in 1818, Ram Mohan Roy wrote that: > \\"All these instances are murders according to every shastra.\\" In culture European artists in the eighteenth century produced many images for their own native markets, showing the widows as heroic women, and moral exemplars.\\"The Representation of Sati: Four Eighteenth Century Etchings by Baltazard Solvyns\\" by Robert L. Hardgrave, Jr. Bengal Past and Present, 117 (1998): 57‚Äì80. In Jules Verne's novel Around the World in Eighty Days, Phileas Fogg rescues Princess Aouda from forced sati. In her article \\"Can the Subaltern Speak?\\" philosopher Gayatri Spivak discusses the British manipulation of sati practice,Gayatri Spivak: Deconstruction and the Ethics of Postcolonial Literary Interpretation p. 50, Ola Abdalkafor, Cambridge Scholars Publishing and how sati takes the form of imprisoning women in the double bind of self-expression attributed to mental illness and social rejection, or of self-incrimination according to British colonial law. The woman who commits sati takes the form of the subaltern in Spivak's work, a form much of postcolonial studies takes very seriously. The Australian rock band Tlot Tlot's song \\"The Bonebass Suttee\\" on their 1991 album A Day at the Bay is about the practice. The 2005 novel The Ashram by Indian writer Sattar Memon, deals with the plight of an oppressed young woman in India, under pressure to commit suttee and the endeavours of a western spiritual aspirant to save her.

He sent an official, Ma Liang, as an envoy to meet Shamoke and the tribal chiefs in Wuling Commandery and managed to bribe them with wealth and titles to gain their support in the war against Sun Quan.(ÂÖà‰∏ªÁ®±Â∞äËôüÔºå‰ª•ËâØÁÇ∫‰æç‰∏≠„ÄÇÂèäÊù±ÂæÅÂê≥ÔºåÈÅ£ËâØÂÖ•Ê≠¶ÈôµÊãõÁ¥ç‰∫îÊ∫™Ë†ªÂ§∑ÔºåË†ªÂ§∑Ê∏†Â∏•ÁöÜÂèóÂç∞ËôüÔºåÂí∏Â¶ÇÊÑèÊåá„ÄÇÊúÉÂÖà‰∏ªÊïóÁ∏æÊñºÂ§∑ÈôµÔºåËâØ‰∫¶ÈÅáÂÆ≥„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 39.(‰∫åÂπ¥Êò•Ê≠£ÊúàÔºåÂÖà‰∏ªËªçÈÇÑÁß≠Ê≠∏ÔºåÂ∞áËªçÂê≥Áè≠„ÄÅÈô≥ÂºèÊ∞¥ËªçÂ±ØÂ§∑ÈôµÔºåÂ§æÊ±üÊù±Ë•øÂ≤∏„ÄÇ‰∫åÊúàÔºåÂÖà‰∏ªËá™Áß≠Ê≠∏ÁéáË´∏Â∞áÈÄ≤ËªçÔºåÁ∑£Â±±Êà™Â∂∫ÔºåÊñºÂ§∑ÈÅìÁåá‰∫≠ÈßêÁáüÔºåËá™‰Ω∑Â±±ÈÄöÊ≠¶ÈôµÔºåÈÅ£‰æç‰∏≠È¶¨ËâØÂÆâÊÖ∞‰∫îË∞øË†ªÂ§∑ÔºåÂí∏Áõ∏ÁéáÈüøÊáâ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 32.

In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Shamoke appears as a minor character in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. His physical appearance is described as follows in the novel: During the Battle of Xiaoting, he encounters the Eastern Wu general Gan Ning, who insists on participating in the battle even though he is ill at the time. When Gan Ning realises that he cannot fight Shamoke due to his condition, he tries to retreat but is killed by Shamoke, who fires an arrow that hits him in the head. Later on, when Shamoke gets caught up in the Eastern Wu forces' fire attack against the Shu Han forces, he attempts to flee the battlefield but the Eastern Wu general Zhou Tai catches up with him and kills him after a brief fight.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 83-84.

In the novel, the Chinese character for \\"Qiao\\" in their names, Ê©ã/Ê°•, is replaced with Âñ¨/‰πî. In the novel, the Qiao sisters are the daughters of a certain Qiao Guolao (Âñ¨ÂúãËÄÅ; literally \\"State Elder Qiao\\"), possibly referring to Qiao Xuan. Zhou Yu's biography in the third-century historical text Records of the Three Kingdoms did not mention the name of the Qiao sisters' father, who was simply referred to as Qiao Gong (Ê©ãÂÖ¨; literally \\"Elder Qiao\\" or \\"Lord Qiao\\").

Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Qiao Xuan was the \\"Qiao Gong\\" mentioned in Zhou Yu's biography. In Chapter 44 of the novel, Zhuge Liang tells Zhou Yu that Cao Cao's desire to have the Two Qiaos for himself is evident in \\"Ode to the Bronze Sparrow Platform\\" (ÈäÖÈõÄËá∫Ë≥¶), a poem written by Cao Cao's son Cao Zhi. An enraged Zhou Yu then hardens his decision to convince Sun Quan to ally with Liu Bei against Cao Cao. (See List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms#Zhuge Liang's mission to Jiangdong for details.) In popular culture The Qiao sisters are featured as playable characters in Koei's Dynasty Warriors and Warriors Orochi video game series. The anime Koihime Mus≈ç and Ikki Tousen make references to Da Qiao and Xiao Qiao as well, in which they are known by their respective names in Japanese ‚Äì Daiky≈ç and Sh≈çky≈ç. Taiwanese supermodel Lin Chi-ling starred as Xiao Qiao in the 2008 Chinese epic war film Red Cliff directed by John Woo. In the film, it is surmised that Cao Cao's infatuation with Xiao Qiao is the reason why he invaded Sun Quan's lands and initiated the battle. Chinese actress Huang Yi portrayed Xiao Qiao in Just Another Pandora's Box, a spoof of Red Cliff. Cai Hancen and Tsai Yi-chen portrayed Da Qiao and Xiao Qiao respectively in the 2009 Taiwanese television series K.O.3an Guo, a spoof of Romance of the Three Kingdoms in a modern high school setting.

It consisted of five faculties: humanities, sciences, theology, law, and medicine, all of which were contained in the Hoheschule ('high school'). The university was modeled after the University of Vienna. Its chief goal was the propagation of the Christian faith. The university closed in May 1800, by order of the Prince-elector Maximilian IV (later Maximilian I, King of Bavaria). Pre-Reformation In its first several decades, the university grew rapidly, opening colleges not only for philosophers from the realist and nominalist schools, but also for poor students wishing to study the liberal arts. Among its most famous instructors in the late 15th century were the poet Conrad Celtes, the Hebrew scholar Johannes Reuchlin, and the Bavarian historian Johannes Thurmair (also known as \\"Johannes Aventinus\\"). The Illuminati movement was founded on May 1, 1776, in Ingolstadt (Upper Bavaria), by Jesuit-taught Adam Weishaupt (d. 1830), who was the first lay professor of canon law at the University of Ingolstadt. The movement was made up of freethinkers, as an offshoot of the Enlightenment. Writers at the time, such as Seth Payson, believed the movement represented a conspiracy to infiltrate and overthrow the governments of European states.Wortgewaltiger Gegner der Nordlichter: Der Mediziner Johann Nepomuk von Ringseis, in: Ulrike Leutheusser, Heinrich N√∂th (Hg.), ‚ÄûDem Geist alle Tore √∂ffnen\\". K√∂nig Maximilian II. von Bayern und die Wissenschaft, M√ºnchen 2009, 142-153; 2. Aufl. M√ºnchen 2011, 142-153. Some writers, such as Augustin Barruel and John Robison, even claimed that the Illuminati were behind the French Revolution, a claim that Jean-Joseph Mounier dismissed in his 1801 book On the Influence Attributed to Philosophers, Free-Masons, and to the Illuminati on the Revolution of France. The group's adherents were given the name \\"Illuminati\\", although they called themselves \\"Perfectibilists\\". The group has also been called the Illuminati Order and the Bavarian Illuminati, and the movement itself has been referred to as Illuminism (after illuminism). In 1777, Karl Theodor became ruler of Bavaria. He was a proponent of Enlightened Despotism and, in 1784, his government banned all secret societies, including the Illuminati. During the period when the Illuminati was legally allowed to operate, many influential intellectuals and progressive politicians counted themselves as members, including Ferdinand of Brunswick and the diplomat Xavier von Zwack, who was number two in the operation and was found with much of the group's documentation when his home was searched. The Illuminati's members pledged obedience to their superiors, and were divided into three main classes, each with several degrees. The order had its branches in most countries of the European continent; it reportedly had around 2,000 members over the span of ten years. The organization had its attraction for literary men, such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Johann Gottfried Herder, and even for the reigning dukes of Gotha and Weimar. Weishaupt had modeled his group to some extent on Freemasonry, and many Illuminati chapters drew membership from existing Masonic lodges. Internal rupture and panic over succession preceded its downfall, which was effected by the Secular Edict made by the Bavarian government in 1785. The Reformation and its aftermath The Lutheran movement took an early hold in Ingolstadt, but was quickly put to flight by one of the chief figures of the Counter-Reformation: Johann Eck, who made the university a bastion for the traditional Catholic faith in southern Germany. In Eck's wake, many Jesuits were appointed to key positions in the school, and the university, over most of the 17th century, gradually came fully under the control of the Jesuit order. Noted scholars of this period include the theologian Gregory of Valentia, the astronomer Christopher Scheiner (inventor of the helioscope), Johann Baptist Cysat, and the poet Jacob Balde. The Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II received his education at the university. The end and refoundation The 18th century gave rise to the Enlightenment, a movement that in some quarters was opposed to the church-run universities of which Ingolstadt was a prime example. The Jesuits gradually left the university as it sought to change with the times, until the university finally had become so secular that the greatest influence in Ingolstadt was Adam Weishaupt, founder of the secret society of the Illuminati. On November 25, 1799, the elector Maximilian IV announced that the university's depleted finances had become too great a weight for him to bear: the university would be moved to Landshut as a result. The university finished that year's school term, and left Ingolstadt in May 1800, bringing to a quiet end the school that had, at its peak, been one of the most influential and powerful institutes of higher learning in Europe. In 1826 King Ludwig I moved the university to the capital Munich (Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich). The modern successor of Bavaria's oldest university is the WFI - Ingolstadt School of Management (founded in 1989 as part of the Catholic University of Eichst√§tt-Ingolstadt), one of Germany's foremost business schools. In popular culture Victor Frankenstein from Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein was a fictional student at the University of Ingolstadt.

Daumier produced more than 500 paintings, 4000 lithographs, 1000 wood engravings, 1000 drawings and 100 sculptures. A prolific draughtsman, he was perhaps best known for his caricatures of political figures and satires on the behavior of his countrymen, although posthumously the value of his painting has also been recognized. Life Daumier was born in Marseille to Jean-Baptiste Louis Daumier and C√©cile Catherine Philippe. His father Jean-Baptiste was a glazier whose literary aspirations led him to move to Paris in 1814, seeking to be published as a poet.Rey, page 10. In 1816, the young Daumier and his mother followed Jean-Baptiste to Paris. Daumier showed in his youth an irresistible inclination towards the artistic profession, which his father vainly tried to check by placing him first with a huissier, for whom he was employed as an errand boy, and later, with a bookseller. In 1822, he became prot√©g√© to Alexandre Lenoir, a friend of Daumier's father who was an artist and archaeologist. The following year Daumier entered the Acad√©mie Suisse. He also worked for a lithographer and publisher named Belliard, and made his first attempts at lithography. Having mastered the techniques of lithography, Daumier began his artistic career by producing plates for music publishers, and illustrations for advertisements. This was followed by anonymous work for publishers, in which he emulated the style of Charlet and displayed considerable enthusiasm for the Napoleonic legend. After the revolution of 1830 he created art which expressed his political beliefs.Frusco, Peter, Janson, H. W., The Romantics to Rodin, George Braziller, Inc., 1980. Daumier was almost blind by 1873. Published works A lithograph of Daumier's Gargantua, 1831 During the reign of Louis Philippe, Charles Philipon launched the comic journal, La Caricature. Daumier joined its staff, which included such powerful artists as Dev√©ria, Raffet and Grandville, and started upon his pictorial campaign of satire, targeting the foibles of the bourgeoisie, the corruption of the law and the incompetence of a blundering government. His caricature of the king as Gargantua led to Daumier's imprisonment for six months at Ste Pelagie in 1832. Soon after, the publication of La Caricature was discontinued, but Philipon provided a new field for Daumier's activity when he founded the Le Charivari. The Print Collector, c.1857‚Äì1860 (Philadelphia Museum of Art) Daumier produced his social caricatures for Le Charivari, in which he held bourgeois society up to ridicule in the figure of Robert Macaire, hero of a popular melodrama. In another series, L'histoire ancienne, he took aim at the constraining pseudo-classicism of the art of the period. In 1848 Daumier embarked again on his political campaign, still in the service of Le Charivari, which he left in 1863 and rejoined in 1864. Around the mid-1840s, Daumier started publishing his famous caricatures depicting members of the legal profession, known as 'Les Gens de Justice', a scathing satire about judges, defendants, attorneys and corrupt, greedy lawyers in general. A number of extremely rare albums appeared on white paper, covering 39 different legal themes, of which 37 had previously been published in the Charivari. It has been said that Daumier's own experience as an employee in a bailiff's office during his youth may have influenced his rather negative attitude towards the legal profession. Young Women Bathing, 1855‚Äì1860 In 1834 he produced the lithograph Rue Transnonain, 15 April 1834 depicting the massacre in the rue transnoin which was part of the April 1834 riots in Paris. It was designed for the subscription publication L'Association Mensuelle. The profits were to promote freedom of the press and defrayed legal costs of a lawsuit against the satirical, politically progressive journal Le Charivari to which Daumier contributed regularly. The police discovered the print hanging in the window of printseller Ernest Jean Aubert in the Galerie V√©ro-Dodat (passageway in 1st arrondissement) and subsequently tracked down and confiscated as many of the prints they could find, along with the original lithographic stone on which the image was drawn. Existing prints of Rue Transnonain are survivors of this effort. Sculptures Daumier was not only a prolific lithographer, draftsman and painter, but he also produced a notable number of sculptures in unbaked clay. In order to save these rare specimens from destruction, some of these busts were reproduced first in plaster. Bronze sculptures were posthumously produced from the plaster. The major 20th-century foundries were F. Barbedienne Barbedienne, , and . Eventually Daumier produced between 36 busts of French members of Parliament in unbaked clay. The foundries involved from 1927 on to produce a bronze edition were Barbedienne in an edition of 25 & 30 casts and Valsuani with three special casts based on the previous plaster castings from the gallery Sagot - Le Garrec clay collection. These bronze busts are all posthumous, based on the original, but frequently restored unbaked clay sculptures. The clay in its restored version can be seen at the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris. Scene from a Comedy (Moli√®re?), c. 1860 From the early 1950s on, some baked clay 'Figurines' appeared, most of them belonging to the Gobin collection in Paris. It was Gobin who decided to have a bronze cast done by Valsuani in an edition of 30 each. Again, they were posthumous and there is no proof, in contrast to the busts mentioned above, that these terra cotta figurines really were done by Daumier himself. The American school (J.Wasserman from the Fogg-Harvard Museum) doubts their authenticity, while the French school, especially Gobin, Lecomte, and Le Garrec and Cherpin, all somehow involved in the marketing of the bronze editions, are sure of their Daumier origin. The Daumier Register (the international center of Daumier research) as well as the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC would consider the figurines as 'in the manner of Daumier' or even 'by an imitator of Daumier' (NGA) There can be no doubt about the authenticity of Daumier's Ratapoil and his Emigrants. The self-portrait in bronze as well as the bust of Louis XIV have been frequently debated over the last 100 years, but the general tenor is to accept them as originals by Daumier. Daumier created many figurines that he subsequently used as models for his paintings. One of Daumier's most well-known figurines, titled The Heavy Burden, features a woman and her child. The woman is carrying something, possibly a large bag; the figurine is about 14 inches tall. Oliver W. Larkin states that \\"One sees in the clay the mark of Daumier's swift fingers as he nudged the skirt into windblown folds and used a knife blade or the end of a brush handle to define the clasped arms and the wrinkles of the cloth over the breast. In oil, he could only approximate this small masterpiece most successfully in two canvases were once owned by Arsene Alexandre.\\" Daumier made several paintings of The Heavy Burden. The woman and her child look like they are being pushed by the wind, and Daumier used this as a metaphor of the greater forces they were actually fighting against. The greater forces that Daumier wanted to show that they were trying to fight were the Revolution, the government, and poverty. The woman and her child in the painting are outlined by a very dark shadow. Paintings Daumier later in his career In addition to his prodigious activity in the field of caricature‚Äîthe list of Daumier's lithographed plates compiled in 1904 numbers no fewer than 3,958‚Äîhe also painted. Except for the searching truthfulness of his vision and the powerful directness of his brushwork, it would be difficult to recognize the creator of Robert Macaire, of Les Bas bleus, Les Boh√©miens de Paris, and the Masques, in the paintings of Christ and His Apostles (Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam), or in his Good Samaritan, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, Christ Mocked, or even in the sketches in the Ionides Collection at South Kensington. There is a room-full of caricatures in the museum Am R√∂merholz in Winterthur. Don Quixote and Sancho Panza was found as part of the 2012 Munich Art Hoard. As a painter, Daumier was one of the pioneers of realistic subjects, which he treated with a point of view critical of class distinctions. His paintings did not meet with success until 1878, a year before his death, when Paul Durand-Ruel collected his works for exhibition at his galleries and demonstrated the range of the talent of the man who has been called the \\"Michelangelo of caricature\\". At the time of the exhibition, Daumier was blind and living in a cottage at Valmondois, which Corot placed at his disposal. It was there that he died. Legacy Bust of Daumier by Adolphe-Victor Geoffroy-Dechaume Baudelaire noted of him: l'un des hommes les plus importants, je ne dirai pas seulement de la caricature, mais encore de l'art moderne. (One of the most important men, not only, I would say, in caricature, but also in modern art.) Vincent van Gogh was also a great admirer of his work. An exhibition of his works was held at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in 1901. Daumier's works are found in many of the world's leading art museums, including the Louvre, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Rijksmuseum. He is celebrated for a range of works, including a large number of paintings (500) and drawings (1000) some of them depicting the life of Don Quixote, a theme that fascinated him for the last part of his life. Daumier's 200th birthday was celebrated in 2008 with a number of exhibitions in Asia, America, Australia and Europe.

In a debate, opposing arguments are put forward to argue for opposing viewpoints. Debate occurs in public meetings, academic institutions, and legislative assemblies.The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 4th ed., 1993 pg. 603. It is a formal type of discussion, often with a moderator and an audience, in addition to the debate participants. Logical consistency, factual accuracy and some degree of emotional appeal to the audience are elements in debating, where one side often prevails over the other party by presenting a superior \\"context\\" or framework of the issue. In a formal debating contest, there are rules for participants to discuss and decide on differences, within a framework defining how they will do it. Debating is carried out in debating chambers and assemblies of various types to discuss matters and to make resolutions about action to be taken, often by voting. Deliberative bodies such as parliaments, legislative assemblies, and meetings of all sorts engage in debates. In particular, in parliamentary democracies a legislature debates and decides on new laws. Formal debates between candidates for elected office, such as the leaders debates, are sometimes held in democracies. Debating is also carried out for educational and recreational purposes, usually associated with educational establishments and debating societies. Informal and forum debate is relatively common, shown by TV shows such as the Australian talk show, Q&A.; The outcome of a contest may be decided by audience vote, by judges, or by some combination of the two.  History  A Debate among Scholars, Razmnama illustration Debating in various forms has a long history and can be traced back to the philosophical and political debates of Ancient Greece, such as Athenian democracy, Shastrartha in Ancient India. Modern forms of debating and the establishment of debating societies occurred during the Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century. = Emergence of debating societies = Debate Tonight: Whether a man's wig should be dressed with honey or mustard! A 1795 cartoon satirizing the content of debates. Debating societies emerged in London in the early eighteenth century, and soon became a prominent fixture of national life. The origins of these societies are not certain in many cases, although by the mid-18th century, London fostered an active debating society culture. Debating topics covered a broad spectrum of topics while the debating societies allowed participants from both genders and all social backgrounds, making them an excellent example of the enlarged public sphere of the Age of Enlightenment.Mary Thale, \\"London Debating Societies in the 1790s,\\" The Historical Journal 32, no. 1 (March 1989): 58-9. Debating societies were a phenomenon associated with the simultaneous rise of the public sphere,James Van Horn Melton, The Rise of the Public in Enlightenment Europe (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001). a sphere of discussion separate from traditional authorities and accessible to all people that acted as a platform for criticism and the development of new ideas and philosophy.Thomas Munck, The Enlightenment: A Comparative Social History 1721‚Äì1794 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000). Many subjects were debated in the London Debating Societies of the 18th century. This is a cover to a panegyric on marriage and family life, c. 1780. John Henley, a clergyman,Donna T. Andrew, \\"Popular Culture and Public Debate\\" in The Historical Journal, Vol. 39, Issue 02 (Cambridge University Press, June 1996), p. 406. founded an Oratory in 1726 with the principal purpose of \\"reforming the manner in which such public presentations should be performed.\\"Goring, The Rhetoric of Sensibility in Eighteenth-Century Culture, 63. He made extensive use of the print industry to advertise the events of his Oratory, making it an omnipresent part of the London public sphere. Henley was also instrumental in constructing the space of the debating club: he added two platforms to his room in the Newport district of London to allow for the staging of debates, and structured the entrances to allow for the collection of admission. These changes were further implemented when Henley moved his enterprise to Lincoln's Inn Fields. The public was now willing to pay to be entertained, and Henley exploited this increasing commercialization of British society.Goring, The Rhetoric of Sensibility in Eighteenth-Century Culture, 65-6. By the 1770s, debating societies were firmly established in London society.Andrew, \\"Popular Culture and Public Debate,\\" 409. The year 1785 was pivotal: The Morning Chronicle announced on March 27:Andrew, London Debating Societies, 82. In 1780, 35 differently named societies advertised and hosted debates for anywhere between 650 and 1200 people.Andrew, Introduction to London Debating Societies, ix; Thale, \\"London Debating Societies in the 1790s,\\" 59; Munck, The Enlightenment, 72. The question for debate was introduced by a president or moderator who proceeded to regulate the discussion. Speakers were given set amounts of time to argue their point of view, and, at the end of the debate, a vote was taken to determine a decision or adjourn the question for further debate.Thale, \\"London Debating Societies in the 1790s,\\" 60. Speakers were not permitted to slander or insult other speakers, or diverge from the topic at hand, again illustrating the value placed on politeness by late 18th century debaters. = Student debating societies = A debate at the right Princeton University in the future United States was home to a number of short-lived student debating societies throughout the mid-1700s, and its influential American Whig Society was co-founded in 1769 by future revolutionary James Madison. The first of the post-revolutionary debating societies, the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies, were formed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1795 and are still active. The first student debating society in Great Britain was the St Andrews Debating Society, formed in 1794 as the Literary Society. The Cambridge Union Society was founded in 1815, and claims to be the oldest continually operating debating society in the World.History of the Union  The Cambridge Union Society . Cus.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-15. This claim is arguably valid because Princeton's societies had been shut down during the American Revolutionary War, while the UNC societies' operations were briefly suspended during the American Civil War. Over the next few decades, similar societies emerged at several other prominent universities. Examples include the Oxford Union, the Yale Political Union and the Conf√©rence Olivaint.  Debating for decision-making  = Parliamentary debate = In parliaments and other legislatures, members debate proposals regarding legislation, before voting on resolutions which become laws. Debates are usually conducted by proposing a law, or changes to a law known as amendments. Members of the parliament, assembly or congress then discuss the proposal and cast their vote for or against such a law. = Emergency debating = In some countries (e.g., Canada and the UK) members of parliament may request debates on urgent matters of national importance. If the Speaker grants such a request, an emergency debate is usually held before the end of the next sitting day. = Debate between candidates for high office = In jurisdictions which elect holders of high political office such as president or prime minister, candidates sometimes debate in public, usually during a general election campaign.  U.S. presidential debates  Since the 1976 general election, debates between presidential candidates have been a part of U.S. presidential campaigns. Unlike debates sponsored at the high school or collegiate level, the participants and format are not independently defined. Nevertheless, in a campaign season heavily dominated by television advertisements, talk radio, sound bites, and spin, they still offer a rare opportunity for citizens to see and hear the major candidates side by side. The format of the presidential debates, though defined differently in every election, is typically more restrictive than many traditional formats, forbidding participants to ask each other questions and restricting discussion of particular topics to short time frames. The presidential debates were initially moderated in 1976, 1980, and 1984 by the League of Women Voters, but the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) was established in 1987 by the Republican and Democratic parties. The presidential debate's primary purpose is to sponsor and produce debates for the United States presidential and vice presidential candidates and to undertake research and educational activities relating to the debates. The organization, which is a nonprofit, nonpartisan corporation, sponsored all of the presidential debates in 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020. However, in announcing its withdrawal from sponsoring the debates, the League of Women Voters stated that it was withdrawing \\"because the demands of the two campaign organizations would perpetrate a fraud on the American voter.\\" In 2004, the Citizens' Debate Commission was formed in the hope of establishing an independent sponsor for presidential debates, with a more voter-centric role in the definition of the participants, format, and rules.  Competitive debating  In competitive debates, teams compete against each other and are judged the winner by a list of criteria that is usually based around the concepts of \\"content, style and strategy\\". There are many different styles of competitive debating, organizations and rules. Competitive debating is carried out at the local, national, and international level. In schools and colleges, competitive debating often takes the form of a contest with explicit rules. It may be presided over by one or more judges or adjudicators. Both sides seek to win against the other while following the rules. One side is typically in favor of (also known as \\"for\\", \\"Affirmative\\", or \\"Pro\\") or opposed to (also known as \\"against\\", \\"Negative\\", \\"Con\\") a statement, proposition, moot or Resolution. The \\"for\\" side must state points that will support the proposition; the \\"against\\" side must refute these arguments sufficiently to falsify the other side. The \\"against\\" side is not required to propose an alternative but it must substantiate its own negation if no other position is possible. For instance, let x be a boolean. If the \\"for\\" side says x = true, the \\"against\\" side must say x = false. The \\"against\\" side cannot simply say \\"I am not convinced that x = true\\" if they both want a debate. Both sides are required to embrace and defend their own positions. Otherwise, it is not a debate but simply a discussion of a controversy where one side solely attempts to convince the other side or the other listeners to its position. = Forms of competitive debating =  Australasia debating  The Australasian style debate consists of two teams, each consisting of three people, who debate over an issue that is commonly called a topic or proposition. The issue, by convention, is presented in the form of an affirmative statement beginning with \\"That\\", for example, \\"That cats are better than dogs\\", or \\"This House\\", for example, \\"This House would establish a world government\\". The topic subject may vary from region to region. Most topics, however, are usually region-specific to facilitate interest by both the participants and their audiences. Each team has three members, each of whom is named according to their team and speaking position within his/her team. For instance, the second speaker of the affirmative team to speak is called the \\"Second Affirmative Speaker\\" or \\"Second Proposition Speaker\\", depending on the terminology used. Each of the speakers' positions is based around a specific role. For example, the third speaker has the opportunity to make a rebuttal towards the opposing team's argument by introducing new evidence to add to their position. The last speaker is called the \\"Team Advisor/Captain\\". Using this style, the debate is finished with a closing argument by each of the first speakers from each team and new evidence may not be introduced. Each of the six speakers (three affirmative and three negative) speak in succession to each other beginning with the Affirmative Team. The speaking order is as follows: First Affirmative, First Negative, Second Affirmative, Second Negative, Third Affirmative, and finally Third Negative. \\"Points of Information\\", more commonly known as \\"POIs\\" are often used in Australian and New Zealand Secondary School level debating. A Point of Information (POI) is when a member of the team opposing that of the current speaker gets to briefly interrupt the current speaker, offering a POI in the form of a question or a statement. The context in which the Australasia style of debate is used varies, but in Australia and New Zealand is mostly used at the Primary and Secondary school level, ranging from small informal one-off intra-school debates to larger more formal inter-school competitions with several rounds and a finals series which occur over a year.  European square debating  This is a Paris-style inspired format, specifically suited for Council of Europe simulation. Four teams representing four major European nations (for instance France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Russia) confront each other on a policy debate including two broad coalitions (online examples for sustainable energy and defence). Each team is composed of two speakers (the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary). The debate starts with the first speaker from France, followed by the first speaker of Germany (the opposite side), followed by the second speaker of France and the second speaker of Germany. The debate continues with the first speaker of the United Kingdom, followed by the first speaker of Russia and it goes on with the respective second speakers. Each debater speaks for 5 minutes. The first and the last minutes are protected time: no Points of Information may be asked. During the rest of the speech, the speaker may be interrupted by Points of Information (POIs) from the opposite countries (debaters from France and UK may ask POIs to debaters representing Germany and Russia and vice versa, respectively). The format forces each debater to develop a winning strategy while respecting the coalition. This format was commonly developed by The Franco-British Comparative Project and Declan McCavanna, Chairman of the FDA and was featuring France, the UK, Germany, Russia and Italy.  Extemporaneous speaking  Extemporaneous speaking is a style that involves no planning in advance, and two teams with a first and second speaker. While a majority of judges will allow debaters to cite current events and various statistics (of which opponents may question the credibility) the only research permitted are one or more articles given to the debaters along with the resolution shortly before the debate. It begins with an affirmative first- speaker constructive speech, followed by a negative; then an affirmative and negative second-speaker constructive speech respectively. Each of these speeches is six minutes in length, and is followed by two minutes of cross examination. There is then an affirmative and negative first-speaker rebuttal, and a negative and affirmative second-speaker rebuttal, respectively. These speeches are each four minutes long. No new points can be brought into the debate during the rebuttals. This style of debate generally centers on three main contentions, although a team can occasionally use two or four. In order for the affirmative side to win, all of the negative contentions must be defeated, and all of the affirmative contentions must be left standing. Most of the information presented in the debate must be tied in to support one of these contentions, or \\"signposted\\". Much of extemporaneous speaking is similar to the forms known as policy debate and Congressional Debate. One main difference with both of them, however, is that extemporaneous speech focuses less on the implementation of the resolution. Also, Extemporaneous Speech is considered in more areas, especially in the United States, as a form of Speech, which is considered separate from debate, or itself a form of debate with several types of events.  Impromptu debating  Impromptu debating is a relatively informal style of debating, when compared to other highly structured formats. The topic for the debate is given to the participants between fifteen and twenty minutes before the debate starts. The debate format is relatively simple; each team member of each side speaks for five minutes, alternating sides. A ten-minute discussion period, similar to other formats' \\"open cross-examination\\" time follows, and then a five-minute break (comparable to other formats' preparation time). Following the break, each team gives a 4-minute rebuttal.  Jes debating  This style of debate is particularly popular in Ireland at secondary school level. Developed in Col√°iste Iogn√°id (Galway) over the last ten years, the format has five speakers: two teams and a single 'sweep speaker' on each side. Speeches last 4:30 minutes with 30 seconds protected from POIs at either end of the debate. Adjudication will depend on BP (British Parliament) marking, but with particular recognition of principled debating. A ten-minute open house will also be adjudicated. Traditionally, the motion is always opposed in the final vote.  Lincoln‚ÄìDouglas debating  Lincoln-Douglas debating is primarily a form of United States high school debate (though it also has a college form called NFA LD) named after the 1858 Lincoln-Douglas debates. It is a one-on- one event focused mainly on applying philosophical theories to real world issues. Debaters normally alternate sides from round to round as either the \\"affirmative\\", which upholds the resolution, or \\"negative\\", which attacks it. The resolution, which changes bimonthly, asks whether a certain policy or action conforms to a specific value. Though established as an alternative to policy debate, there has been a strong movement to embrace certain techniques that originated in policy debate (and, correspondingly, a strong backlash movement). Plans, counterplans, critical theory, postmodern theory, debate about the theoretical basis and rules of the activity itself, and critics have all reached more than occasional, if not yet universal, usage. Traditional L-D debate attempts to be free of policy debate \\"jargon\\". Lincoln-Douglas speeches can range from a conversational pace to well over 300 words per minute (when trying to maximize the number of arguments and depth of each argument's development). This technique is known as spreading, and originated in policy debate tactics. There is also a growing emphasis on carded evidence, though still much less than in policy debate. These trends have created a serious rift within the activity between the debaters, judges, and coaches who advocate or accept these changes, and those who vehemently oppose them. Policy and Lincoln-Douglas debate tournaments are often held concurrently at the same school or organization. One organization that offers Lincoln-Douglas debate is NCFCA?  Mace debating  The Mace debating style is prominent in Britain and Ireland at the school level. Two opposing teams, consisting of two people, debate an affirmative motion (e.g. \\"This house would give prisoners the right to vote\\",) which one team will propose and the other will oppose. Each speaker will make a seven-minute speech in the order; 1st Proposition, 1st Opposition, 2nd Proposition, 2nd Opposition. After the first minute of each speech, members of the opposing team may request a 'point of information' (POI). If the speaker accepts they are permitted to ask a question. POI's are used to pull the speaker up on a weak point, or to argue against something the speaker has said. However, after 6 minutes, no more POIs are permitted. After all four debaters have spoken, the debate will be opened to the floor, in which members of the audience will put questions to the teams. After the floor debate, one speaker from each team (traditionally the first speaker), will speak for 4 minutes. In these summary speeches it is typical for the speaker to answer the questions posed by the floor, as well as any questions the opposition may have put forward, before summarising his or her own key points. In the Mace format, emphasis is typically on analytical skills, entertainment, style and strength of argument. The winning team will typically have excelled in most, if not all, of these areas.  Mock trial   Model United Nations   Moot court   Offene parlamentarische Debatte (OPD)  The offene parlamentarische Debatte (Open Parliamentary Debate, OPD) is a German competitive debating format. It was developed by the debate club Streitkultur T√ºbingen and was used for the first time in a tournament in 2001. It aims to combine the advantages of parliamentary debates and public audience debates: each of the two teams has three speakers, and in addition the debate includes three independent \\"free speakers\\". Clubs using OPD exist in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy.  Oxford-style debating  Derived from the Oxford Union debating society of Oxford University, Oxford-style debating is a competitive debate format featuring a sharply assigned motion that is proposed by one side and opposed by another. A winner is declared in an Oxford-Style debate either by the majority or by which team has swayed more audience members between the two votes. Oxford-style debates follow a formal structure that begins with audience members casting a pre-debate vote on the motion that is either for, against or undecided. Each panellist presents a seven-minute opening statement, after which the moderator takes questions from the audience with inter-panel challenges. Finally, each panellist delivers a two-minute closing argument, and the audience delivers their second (and final) vote for comparison against the first.  Paris-style debating  This is a format specifically used in France (though the debates are commonly held in English). Two teams of five debate on a given motion. One side is supposed to defend the motion while the other must defeat it. The debate is judged on the quality of the arguments, the strength of the rhetoric, the charisma of the speaker, the quality of the humor, the ability to think on one's feet, and teamwork. The first speaker of the Proposition (Prime Minister) opens the debate, followed by the first speaker of the Opposition (Shadow Prime Minister), then the second speaker of the Proposition and so on. Every speaker speaks for 6 minutes. After the first minute and before the last minute, debaters from the opposite team may ask Points of Information, which the speaker may accept or reject as he wishes (although he is supposed to accept at least two). The French Debating Association organizes its National Debating Championship upon this style.  Parliamentary debating  Parliamentary debate (sometimes referred to as \\"parli\\" in the United States, or \\"BP\\" in the rest of the world) is conducted under rules derived from British parliamentary procedure, though parliamentary debate now has several variations including the British, Canadian and American. It features the competition of individuals in a multi- person setting. It borrows terms such as \\"government\\" and \\"opposition\\" from the British parliament (although the term \\"proposition\\" is sometimes used rather than \\"government\\" when debating in the United Kingdom). Throughout the world, parliamentary debate is what most countries know as \\"debating\\", and is the primary style practiced in the United Kingdom, India, Greece and most other nations. The premier event in the world of parliamentary debate, the World Universities Debating Championship, is conducted in the British Parliamentary style. = British Parliamentary debating = The British Parliamentary (BP) debating style involves four teams: \\"government\\" or \\"proposition\\" (one opening, one closing) teams support the motion, and two \\"opposition\\" teams (one opening, one closing) oppose it. The closing team of each side must either introduce a new substantive point (outward extension) or expand on a previous point made by their opening team (inward extension), all whilst agreeing with their opening team yet one-upping them, so to speak. In a competitive round, the teams are ranked first to fourth with the first place team receiving 3 points, the second receiving 2, the third receiving 1 and the fourth place receiving no points. This is the style used by the World Universities Debating Championship (WUDC). However, even within the United Kingdom, British Parliamentary style is not used exclusively; the English- Speaking Union (ESU) runs national championships for both universities (John Smith Memorial Mace) and schools (ESU Schools Mace), (including representation from Ireland) in a unique \\"Mace\\" format named after the competition, while there are numerous standalone BP competitions hosted by universities and schools across the UK and Ireland throughout the year. = Canadian Parliamentary debating = The Canadian Parliamentary debating style involves one \\"government\\" team and one \\"opposition\\" team. On the \\"government\\" side, there is the \\"Prime Minister\\" and the \\"Minister of the Crown\\". On the \\"opposition\\" side, there is the \\"Leader of the Opposition\\" and the \\"Shadow Minister\\". In most competitive situations, it is clear what the motion entails and it must be addressed directly. The debate is structured with each party speaking in a particular order and for a define length of time. However, unlike a cross-examination style debate another dominant debate style in Canada Parliamentary debate involves parliamentary rules and allows interruptions for points of order. In very few cases, the motion may be \\"squirrelable\\". This means that the assigned motion is not intended to be debated, and may even be a quote from a film or a song. The \\"government\\" team then \\"squirrels\\" the motion into something debatable by making a series of logical links between the proposed motion and the one they propose to debate. This makes the debate similar to a prepared debate for the \\"government\\" team and an impromptu debate for the \\"opposition\\" team. In Canada, debating tournaments may involve a mix of parliamentary and cross-examination-style debate, or be entirely one style or the other. Competitive debating takes place in English, French, or bilingual style ‚Äì in which approximately 50% of content must be in each language. = American Parliamentary debating = In the United States the American Parliamentary Debate Association is the oldest national parliamentary debating organization, based on the East Coast and including the Ivy League. The more recently founded National Parliamentary Debate Association (NPDA) is now the largest collegiate sponsor. = Brazilian Parliamentary debating = The Brazilian Parliamentary Debate, also known as \\"Parli Brasil\\", involves a \\"proposition team\\", that will support the motion, and an \\"opposition team\\", who will oppose the motion. It is based on the British Parliamentary style, but the primary difference is that the proposition's members are not called \\"government\\", since not only the political government congressmen of that country can introduce new parliamentary topics. In other words, the government can support or oppose the topic in session on the Congress. This way, using \\"government\\" as a synonym to \\"proposition teams\\" could create confusion about how the speakers are going to position themselves on debate. Therefore, the speakers at the debate are called \\"First Member of Proposition\\", \\"First Member of Opposition\\", \\"Second Member of Proposition\\", and so on. It is the most used competitive debating style used in Brazil; it is used at the official competitions of the Instituto Brasileiro de Debates (Brazilian Institute of Debates). At Parli Brasil, every speaker speaks for 7 minutes, with 15 seconds of tolerance after that. After the first minute and before the last minute, debaters from the opposite team may ask Points of Information, which the speaker may accept or reject as he wishes (although he is supposed to accept at least one). Another major difference between Brazilian scene and the Worlds is that Brazilians tournaments use to present themes weeks before the tournament, with the motion only being presented 15 minutes before the debate, as usual BP. Some tournaments, such as GV Debate and Open de Natal are changing this, too. The presence of themes make some differences in the strategy in comparison to the Worlds. However, there is no unique model in Brazil because many clubs debates were created before the creation of \\"Parli Brazil\\" and not all modified their rules. This is the case, for example, of the UFC Debate Society in Fortaleza (\\"Sociedade de Debates da UFC\\") which was established in 2010. In 2013, UFRN Debate Society was created (\\"Sociedade de Debates da UFRN\\") also made some changes based on the old \\"Clube de Debates de Natal\\" (Debate Club in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte). The model \\"Parli Brazil\\" only started its activities in 2014 with the realization of the I Brazilian Championship of Debates in the city of Belo Horizonte, making the second edition in the city of Fortaleza and the third is scheduled to take place in the city of Florian√≥polis. Since then, they were also created UFSC Debate Society (\\"Sociedade de Debates da UFSC\\") in 2014 and the UFRJ Debate Society (\\"Sociedade de Debates da UFRJ\\") on June 25, 2015, and others. At IV Open Minas, hosted by Brazilian Institute of Debates as a prep for CBD, some changes were implemented, when rules and reasoning stopped being judging criteria. The changes were adopted at V Brazilian Championship of Debates.  Policy debating  Policy debate is a form of speech competition in which teams of two advocate for and against a resolution that typically calls for policy change by the United States federal government. It is also called cross-examination debate (sometimes shortened to Cross-X, CX, or C-X) because of the 3-minute questioning period following each constructive speech. Affirmative teams generally present a plan as a proposal to implement the resolution. The negative will generally try to prove that it would be better not to do the plan or that the opportunity costs to the plan are so great that it should not be implemented.  Public debating  Public debate may mean simply debating by the public, or in public. The term is also used for a particular formal style of debate in a competitive or educational context. Two teams of two compete through six rounds of argument, giving persuasive speeches on a particular topic.  Public forum debating  \\"Public forum\\" debating combines aspects of both policy debate and Lincoln-Douglas debate, but makes them easily understood by the general public by having shorter speech lengths, and long questioning periods, called \\"cross- fires\\", where the debaters interact. The basis of this type of debate is to appeal for anyone who is eligible to become a jury member unlike policy debate or Lincoln-Douglas debate which requires more experience in debate to judge.  Simulated legislature  High school debate events such as Congressional Debate, Model United Nations, European Youth Parliament, Junior State of America and the American Legion's Boys/Girls State attempt to stimulate the debating environment of legislatures.  Tibetan Buddhist debating  This is a traditional Buddhist form of debating that was influenced by earlier Indian forms. The debating style was brought to and evolved within Tibet. This style includes two individuals, one functioning as the Challenger (questioner) and the other as the Defender (answerer). The debaters must depend on their memorization of the points of doctrine, definitions, illustrations, and even whole text, together with their own measure of understanding gained from instruction and study. At the opening of a session of debate, the standing Challenger claps his hands together and recites the seed syllable of Manjushri, \\"Dhih\\". Manjushri is the manifestation of the wisdom of all the Buddhas and, as such, is the special deity of debate. In debate, one must have a good motivation, the best of which is to establish all beings in liberation. A characteristic of the Tibetan Buddhist style of debating is the hand gestures used by debaters. When the Challenger first puts their question to the sitting Defender, their right hand is held above the shoulder at the level of their head and the left hand is stretched forward with the palm turned upward. At the end of their statement, the Challenger punctuates by loudly clapping together their hands and simultaneously stomping their left foot. They then immediately draw back their right hand with the palm held upward and at the same time, hold forth their left hand with the palm turned downward. This motion of drawing back and clapping is done with the flow of a dancer‚Äôs movements. Holding forth the left hand after clapping symbolizes closing the door to rebirth in the helpless state of cyclic existence. The drawing back and upraising of the right hand symbolizes one‚Äôs will to raise all sentient beings up out of cyclic existence and to establish them in the omniscience of Buddhahood. The left hand represents \\"Wisdom\\" ‚Äî the \\"antidote\\" to cyclic existence. The right hand represents \\"Method\\" ‚Äî the altruistic intention to become enlightened, motivated by great love and compassion for all sentient beings. The clap represents a union of Method and Wisdom. In dependence on the union of Method and Wisdom, one is able to attain Buddhahood.  Turncoat debating  In this style of debating, the same speaker shifts allegiance between \\"For\\" and \\"Against\\" the motion. It is a solo contest, unlike other debating forms. Here, the speaker is required to speak for 2 minutes \\"For the motion\\", 2 minutes \\"Against the motion\\" and finally draw up a 1-minute conclusion in which the speaker balances the debate. At the end of the fifth minute the debate will be opened to the house, in which members of the audience will put questions to the candidate which they will have to answer. In the Turncoat format, emphasis is on transitions, the strength of argument and balancing of opinions. = International Groups and Events =  Asian Universities Debating Championship  United Asian Debating Championship is the biggest university debating tournament in Asia, where teams from the Middle East to Japan come to debate. It is traditionally hosted in southeast Asia where participation is usually highest compared to other parts of Asia. Asian debates are largely an adaptation of the Australasian format. The only difference is that each speaker is given 7 minutes of speech time and there will be points of information (POI) offered by the opposing team between the 2nd to 6th minutes of the speech. This means that the 1st and 7th minute is considered the 'protected' period where no POIs can be offered to the speaker. The debate will commence with the Prime Minister's speech (first proposition) and will be continued by the first opposition. This alternating speech will go on until the third opposition. Following this, the opposition bench will give the reply speech. In the reply speech, the opposition goes first and then the proposition. The debate ends when the proposition ends the reply speech. 4 minutes is allocated for the reply speech and no POI's can be offered during this time.  International Public Debate Association  The International Public Debate Association (IPDA), inaugurated on February 15, 1997 at St. Mary's University (Texas) in San Antonio, Texas, is a national debate league currently active primarily in the United States. Among universities, it is unlikely that IPDA is the fastest growing debate association within the United States. Although evidence-based arguments are used, the central focus of IPDA is to promote a debate format that emphasizes public speaking and real-world persuasion skills over the predominate use of evidence and speed. To further this goal, IPDA predominantly uses lay judges in order to encourage an audience-centered debate style. Furthermore, although the main goal of the debater is to persuade the judge, IPDA also awards the best speakers within each tournament. IPDA offers both \\"team debating\\" where two teams, consisting of two people, debate and individual debate. In both team and individual debate a list of topics are given to the two sides thirty minutes before the start of the round. A negotiation ensues to pick a topic. The sides, one affirming the resolution and one negating the resolution, then prepare an opening speech, a cross-examination of the other side, and closing remarks for the round. While most member programs of the International Public Debate Association are associated with colleges or universities, participation in IPDA tournaments is open to anyone whose education level is equivalent to high school graduate or higher.  World Universities Peace Invitational Debate (WUPID)  WUPID is an invitational tournament that employs the BP or Worlds format of debating. It invites the top 30 debating institutions in accordance to the list provided by the World Debate Website administered by Colm Flynn. If any or some of the teams cannot participate than replacements would be called in from the top 60 teams or based on strong recommendations from senior members of the University Debating community. WUPID was first held in December 2007 with Sydney University being crowned champion. The second installation in 2008 saw Monash taking the trophy home. The third WUPID was held in Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) in December 2009. The first two tournaments were co- hosted by Universiti Kuala Lumpur (UNIKL). WUPID was the brainchild of Daniel Hasni Mustaffa, Saiful Amin Jalun and Muhammad Yunus Zakariah. They were all former debaters for UPM who took part at all possible levels of debating from the Malaysian nationals to the World Championship.  Other forms of debate  = Online debating = With the increasing popularity and availability of the Internet, differing opinions arise frequently. Though they are often expressed via flaming and other forms of argumentation, which consist primarily of assertions, formalized debating websites do exist. The debate style varies from site to site, with local communities and cultures developing. Some sites promote a contentious atmosphere that can border on \\"flaming\\" (the personal insult of your opponent, also known as a type of ad hominem fallacy), while others strictly police such activities and strongly promote independent research and more structured arguments. Rule sets on various sites usually serve to enforce or create the culture envisioned by the site's owner, or in some more open communities, the community itself. Policing post content, style, and structure combine with frequent use of \\"reward\\" systems (such as reputation, titles, and forum permissions) to promote activities seen as productive while discouraging unwelcomed actions. These cultures vary sufficiently that most styles can find a home. Some online debate communities and forums practice Policy Debate through uploaded speeches and preset word counts to represent time limits present in physical debate. These virtual debates typically feature long periods of theoretical prep time, as well as the ability to research during a round. Originally most debate sites were little more than online or bulletin boards. Since then site-specific development has become increasingly common in facilitating different debate styles. 2005 Chilean presidential elections. = Debate shows = Debates have also been made into a television show genre.

Such enthusiasts have categorization schemes for ages of cars that enforce distinctions between antique cars, vintage cars, classic cars, and so on. The classification criteria vary, but consensus within any country is often maintained by major car clubs, for example the Vintage Sports-Car Club (VSCC) in the UK.\\"The Vintage Sports-Car Club was established in 1934 to promote the sport and pastime of motoring, principally for cars built before 1931.\\" 'About Us' vscc.co.uk, accessed 25 November 2018  History  The vintage era in the automotive world was a time of transition. The car started off in 1919 as still something of a rarity, and ended up, in 1930, well on the way towards ubiquity. In fact, automobile production at the end of this period was not matched again until the 1950s. In the intervening years, most industrialized countries built nationwide road systems with the result that, towards the end of the period, the ability to negotiate unpaved roads was no longer a prime consideration of automotive design. Cars became much more practical, convenient and comfortable during this period. Car heating was introduced (progressing from hot bricks via double-skinned exhaust manifolds to the heater radiator matrix),Anees Saddique: A Bit About Car Heater History 9 March 2017 topics.dirwell.com, accessed 25 November 2018 as was the in-car radio.\\"There is a report that in 1923 the first factory installed ‚ÄúRegular Production Option‚Äù car radio was carried out by the US Springfield Body Corporation.\\", History of the Car Radio in Motor Cars / Automobiles carhistory4u.com, archived, accessed 25 November 2018 Four-wheel braking from a common foot pedal was introduced, as was the use of hydraulically actuated brakes.Vintage cars accessed November 2018 =United States Perspective= Towards the end of the vintage era, the system of octane rating of fuel was introduced, allowing comparison between fuels. In 1923 the gasoline additive Ethyl made its debut at the Indy 500 that resulted in a boost in octane from the 1950s to the 1980sAmerican Motorsports Timeline -Ethyl additive, 1923 crucean.com, accessed 6 November 2018 In the United States drive-in restaurants were introduced as well as suburban shopping centers and motels. Alfred P. Sloan and Harley Earl of General Motors, and Walter P. Chrysler capitalized on advertising the automobile's role in the life of the consumer for more than just the utilitarian value compared with the horse. The stock market crash of 1929 started the layoff of automotive workers and many new companies went bankrupt but over two million cars were still produced in 1929 and 1930.  United States Federal road and highway acts  The Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 was the first federal highway act. War and lack of funding hampered any positive results of this act. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act) started a 50/50 matching fund to states for road building and resulted in the creation of new and improved roads. During this period as well as the car adapting to society, there were better roads, and society began to adapt to the car. Dwight D. Eisenhower participated in the highly publicized Transcontinental Motor Convoy in 1919 and after becoming President the experience influenced the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 that included 41,000 miles of highways.  Depression of 1920-1921  The end of World War I brought about the \\"Depression of 1920-21\\" with an inflation rate of over 20 percent, a 7 percent Federal Bank discount loan rate, and an 11.7 percent unemployment rate, that resulted in many companies going bankrupt and the automotive industry was decimated.  Industry rationalisation  From 1919 to 1929, many dramatic changes took place. General Motors went into a financial crisis that lasted until after Alfred Sloan became president in 1923. Hudson produced the Essex in 1919 that, by 1925, had propelled the company to third in total sales behind Ford and Chevrolet.-Hudson in 3rd place- Book: Detroit: A Motor City History Accessed; 2010 12-08 Ford was in the process of building a new plant, buying back stock, and began an 18-month process of tooling-up to replace the Model T with the Model A in 1927. In 1921 Maxwell failed and Walter P. Chrysler, formerly of General Motors, was brought in to reorganize it and, in 1925, the Chrysler Corporation was formed. With Ford out for a period, Chrysler was able to produce and market the low-priced Plymouth in 1928, and bought out the Dodge Brothers, also in 1928, resulting in \\"The Big Three\\" in the United States. There were other automakers that made it past the 1920-1921 depression only to fail during the Great Depression. = Europe = During the Great Depression, in Britain many small companies started in the post World War I boom failed or merged leaving six major manufacturers: Morris, Austin, Standard, Singer, Ford of Britain, and General Motors Vauxhall. A similar boom-and-bust cycle was seen in mainland Europe.  Safety issues  Antique automobiles and early to middle era classic cars do not have the safety features that are standard on modern cars. The most rudimentary of safety features, front wheel brakes and hydraulic brakes, began appearing on cars in the 1920s and 1930s respectively.  Collecting  For the average person car collecting is a hobby. A person can have a fascination with a certain vehicle, make or a history with one so seeks a particular make or model. Finding such a car at an affordable price is not always hard but the price will depend on the condition or the desired end result. Usually the less work required on a vehicle equates to a higher price, the more work required means a cheaper initial cost, but often more in the long run, and a person's level of restoration experience plays an important part.-Hobby collecting = Investment = Comedian and avid car collector Jay Leno stated, \\"Any car can be a collector car, if you collect it.\\"Jay Leno's Tips for Collecting Classic Cars -Jay Leno on collecting; popularmechanics.com posted October 1, 2009. Retrieved 2010-12-09. Car collecting as an investment can be rewarding but most serious investment collectors seek rare or exotic cars and original unmodified cars hold a more stable price. Collecting as an investment requires expertise beyond enthusiast collecting and the standard of quality is far higher as well as a need for investment protection such as storage and maintenance. A short-term investment collector must be able to find a vehicle that has market value that is expected to rise in the foreseeable near future. A long-term investment collector would be less interested in any short-term value seeking to capitalize on an expected value rise over a period of years and a vehicle must have certain intrinsic values that are common to other investors or collectors of both short and long term. = Rarity = Cars that were made in small numbers or often have a higher value but can be more difficult to maintain. Certain year and model cars became popular to turn into hot rods thus destroying their original condition. Other models were produced in such quantities that the price is still not inflated. Market trend is an important part in the price of a vintage car. An \\"almost\\" original and in perfect shape model A that was abundantly produced can be purchased for $20,000.00.\\\\- Model A price A collector as an investor would have to know the potential market and have a belief that the future market will bring a return on an investment. = Valuation = Determining the value of a vintage car can be difficult, as there are many different factors that can potentially influence the price. The age, condition, rarity, modifications, vehicle history and mileage can all drastically change a car's value, among other factors. In recent years, services have begun providing classic and vintage car valuation data to the public, by establishing baseline prices for vehicles in various conditions and publishing marketing trends and forecasts collectors can use to monitor the state of the market. As a result of the variability in car values, most insurers offer agreed value insurance coverage for classic cars. Agreed value coverage involves both the owner and insurance company agreeing on the car's value and insuring it for the agreed amount, as opposed to insuring the car based on industry standard or an average published value. = Condition categories = To collectors and investors, a vehicle's condition ratingUnderstanding the Condition Rating System classiccars.about.com, accessed 6 November 2018 is important, and in the United States there are two systems, the category and the points system. The category system has six categories used to rate the condition of a vehicle. The points system assigns points from 40 to 100 that correspond with the category system and below 40 there are three for other conditions. Both systems are listed together for ease of comparison: *Category I, Perfect; 90 to 100 points. A vehicle is considered as good or better than the day produced. *Category II, Excellent; 80 to 89 points. A vehicle in excellent original or superior restored, near-flawless condition. *Category III, Fine; 70 to 79 points. A vehicle with an older restoration or an original car with minimal wear. These are considered \\"show quality\\". *Category IV, Very good; 60 to 69 points. A vehicle that is in complete original condition, or possibly an older restoration, that is usually a well-cared-for daily driver. *Category V, Good; 50 to 59 points. A vehicle that shows wear, needs attention or work, and needs only minor restoration, with no major flaws. Points from 40 to 59 fall into this category. *Category VI, Driver; 40 to 49 points.  Other categories  *Restorable; 30 to 39 points. This vehicle would be in need of restoration of the motor, body, interior and/or chassis. A car in this class should be more or less complete, needing some parts but requiring a tremendous amount of work to get to show quality. *Partial; 20 to 29 points. This vehicle would require extensive restoration with a significant number of parts and amount of labor‚Äîa very time-consuming and costly prospect. *Parts car; 10 to 19 points. This would generally be an inoperative vehicle in poor condition, kept as a source or 'donor' of spare parts. With the exception of very rare vehicles, complete restoration of this category is usually not feasible.

He died in a car accident in Nowy Dw√≥r Mazowiecki, near Warsaw. Life Kota≈Ñski was a psychologist and a psychotherapist - he organized many projects to fight against social problems and helped alcoholics, drug addicts, people with HIV, ex-prisoners and homeless people. Among the organisations he created are Monar and Markot. Born in Warsaw during the Second World War, Marek Kota≈Ñski's mother, Ludwika, was a painter. His father, Wies≈Çaw, was a Japanese language professor at Warsaw University. His house was open for everyone who needed help. Already in high school Kota≈Ñski launched initiatives to help people in need. From 1960 he studied psychology at Warsaw University. During his studies, he was active in the Ruch M≈Çodych Wychowawc√≥w (Movement of Young Educators) who looked after orphans and young people affected by social problems. After his studies, he worked as a therapist in the psychiatric hospital on Dolna Street in Warsaw. He cooperated with the Spo≈Çeczny Komitet Przeciwdzia≈Çania Alkoholizmowi (Social Anti- Alcoholism Committee), and also was active in the Ruch Trze≈∫wo≈õƒá (Abstinence Movement). In 1974 Kota≈Ñski was employed in the Psychiatric Hospital in Garwolin, which had a section for drug addicts (even though during that period, for ideological reasons, drug addicts did not exist). Knowing that traditional methods were not effective, he started a therapy group. This sort of therapy group came to be known as \\"spo≈Çeczno≈õƒá\\" (community). He also started the healing system for drug addicts known as \\"Monar\\". The first Monar centre was opened on 15 October 1978 in Gloskow near Garwolin, starting in part of an abandoned house in ruins. Kota≈Ñski started this program with a group or patients from the hospital in Garwolin. The results were better than expected. Now there are more than 157 Monar centres. He also organised settlements for people with HIV or ill with AIDS, starting another association Solidarni Plus (Solidarity Plus). From 1985-1994 Kota≈Ñski organised the action \\"≈Åa≈Ñcuch Czystych Serc\\" (Chain of Pure Hearts), where hundreds of thousands of young people joined hands in a chain stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Tatra mountains, symbolising unity for humanitarianism. He also organised many \\"Czystych Serc\\" concerts where thousands of people participated. In 1993 Kota≈Ñski created Markot - Ruch Wychodzenia z Bezdomno≈õci (Movement Out of Homelessness), which involves about one hundred centres for homeless people, lone mothers with children, handicapped people, and the terminally ill. He also developed a help system for people coming out of prison, starting from 1994, without any financial help.

Their purpose is to encourage fellowship among Missionary Baptist churches that practice ministerial support by freewill offerings. Since they do not believe in stipulated salaries for pastors and missionaries, they are also known as \\"Faithway Baptists\\". Churches of this association originally fellowshipped with the American Baptist Association. A split in the American Baptist Association (organized 1924) resulted in the formation of two new national associations - the Baptist Missionary Association of America (then called North American Baptist Association) and the Interstate and Foreign Landmark Missionary Baptist Association. All three of these associations adhere to the Landmark principle of a succession of Baptist churches from the time of Christ to the present. Doctrinally, the churches of the Interstate and Foreign Landmark Missionary Baptist Association hold that Christ died for all men; salvation is by grace through faith; the saved are eternally secure; the church is local only and was organized by Christ while He was on earth; baptism by immersion and the Lord's supper are church ordinances; foot washing is to be performed in church capacity; ministerial support must be by freewill offerings; and the Great Commission is given to local churches only. The association work consists of local churches recommending their missionaries to other churches. All decisions to support missionaries are made by the churches in their own business meetings. Local churches sponsor and directly support all missionary, benevolent, and educational work. In 1951, forty churches were represented at the organization. In 2000, there were 135 churches in the association, with a membership of 14,945. Some fellowshipping churches represent in local and state associations but not in the general association. The total number of Faithway Baptist churches meeting in associations is 168 with over 30,000 members. Most of the churches are concentrated in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas; but affiliated churches also are present outside the United States in Mexico, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Quebec, Canada, and South Korea. Twelve foreign, six interstate, and two radio missionaries were recommended by their churches (2000).

It is sometimes called a structure or aggregate data type, although the latter term may also refer to arrays, lists, etc. The act of constructing a composite type is known as composition. Composite data types are often contrasted with scalar variables. C/C++ structures and classes A \`struct\` is C's and C++'s notion of a composite type, a datatype that composes a fixed set of labeled fields or members. It is so called because of the \`struct\` keyword used in declaring them, which is short for structure or, more precisely, user-defined data structure. In C++, the only difference between a \`struct\` and a class is the default access level, which is private for classes and public for \`struct\`s. Note that while classes and the \`class\` keyword were completely new in C++, the C programming language already had a crude type of \`struct\`s. For all intents and purposes, C++ \`struct\`s form a superset of C \`struct\`s: virtually all valid C \`struct\`s are valid C++ \`struct\`s with the same semantics. =Declaration= A \`struct\` declaration consists of a list of fields, each of which can have any type. The total storage required for a \`struct\` object is the sum of the storage requirements of all the fields, plus any internal padding. For example: struct Account { int account_number; char *first_name; char *last_name; float balance; }; defines a type, referred to as \`struct Account\`. To create a new variable of this type, we can write \`struct Account myAccount;\` which has an integer component, accessed by \`myAccount.account_number\`, and a floating-point component, accessed by \`myAccount.balance\`, as well as the \`first_name\` and \`last_name\` components. The structure \`myAccount\` contains all four values, and all four fields may be changed independently. Since writing \`struct Account\` repeatedly in code becomes cumbersome, it is not unusual to see a \`typedef\` statement in C code to provide a more convenient synonym for the \`struct\`. For example: typedef struct Account_ { int account_number; char *first_name; char *last_name; float balance; } Account; In C++ code, the \`typedef\` is not needed because types defined using \`struct\` are already part of the regular namespace, so the type can be referred to as either \`struct Account\` or simply \`Account\`. As another example, a three-dimensional Vector composite type that uses the floating point data type could be created with: struct Vector { float x; float y; float z; }; A variable named \`velocity\` with a \`Vector\` composite type would be declared as \`Vector velocity;\` Members of the \`velocity\` would be accessed using a dot notation. For example, \`velocity.x = 5;\` would set the \`x\` component of \`velocity\` equal to 5. Likewise, a color structure could be created using: struct Color { unsigned int red; unsigned int green; unsigned int blue; }; In 3D graphics, you usually must keep track of both the position and color of each vertex. One way to do this would be to create a \`Vertex\` composite type, using the previously created \`Vector\` and \`Color\` composite types: struct Vertex { Vector position; Color color; }; =Instantiation= Create a variable of type \`struct Vertex\` using the same format as before: \`Vertex v;\` =Member access= Assign values to the components of \`v\` like so: v.position.x = 0.0; v.position.y = 1.5; v.position.z = 0.0; v.color.red = 128; v.color.green = 0; v.color.blue = 255; =Primitive subtype= The primary use of \`struct\` is for the construction of complex datatypes, but sometimes it is used to create primitive structural subtyping. For example, since Standard C requires that if two structs have the same initial fields, those fields will be represented in the same way, the code struct ifoo_old_stub { long x, y; }; struct ifoo_version_42 { long x, y, z; char *name; long a, b, c; }; void operate_on_ifoo(struct ifoo_old_stub *); struct ifoo_version_42 s; . . . operate_on_ifoo(&s;); will work correctly. Type signature Type signatures (or Function types) are constructed from primitive and composite types, and can serve as types themselves when constructing composite types: typedef struct { int x; int y; } Point; typedef double (*Metric) (Point p1, Point p2); typedef struct { Point centre; double radius; Metric metric; } Circle; See also *Object composition *struct (C programming language) *Scalar (mathematics)  References  Category:Data types Category:Type theory Category:Articles with example C code Category:Articles with example C++ code ","title":"Composite data type"},{"id":"337716","text":"This is a list of broadcast television stations serving cities in the U.S. state of Florida.

They have been in existence with a rotating membership of musicians for over forty years. The quartet covers a very broad range of musical genres, including contemporary classical music. More than 900 works have been written for them. History The quartet was founded by violinist David Harrington in Seattle, Washington. Its first performance was in November 1973. Since 1978, the quartet has been based in San Francisco, California. The longest-running combination of performers (from 1978 to 1999) had Harrington and John Sherba on violin, Hank Dutt on viola, and Joan Jeanrenaud on cello. In 1999, Joan Jeanrenaud left Kronos because she was \\"eager for something new\\"; she was replaced by Jennifer Culp who, in turn, left in 2005 and was replaced by Jeffrey Zeigler. In June 2013, Zeigler was replaced by Sunny Yang. With over forty studio albums to their credit and having performed worldwide, they were called \\"probably the most famous 'new music' group in the world\\" and were praised in philosophical studies of music for the inclusiveness of their repertoire. By the time the quartet celebrated their twenty-fifth anniversary in 1999, they had a repertoire of over 600 works, which included 400 string quartets written for them, more than 3,000 performances, seven first-prize ASCAP awards, Edison Awards in classical and popular music, and had sold more than 1.5 million records. =30th anniversary= When Kronos turned 30, in 2003, they decided on a commissioning process for composers under the age of 30, in the hope of bringing some of the talented young composers to light. The program, called the Under 30 Project, is now run in cooperation with Carnegie Hall, Cal Performances at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Montalvo Arts Center. The first recipient was Alexandra du Bois (at the time a student at Indiana University, later a Juilliard School graduate), followed by Felipe Perez Santiago (born in Mexico in 1973), and Dan Visconti (born in Illinois in 1982); in 2007, Israeli composer Aviya Kopelman became the fourth. =40th anniversary= To celebrate the fortieth year of the organization, the Kronos Quartet decided to return to Seattle, the city in which they first played, and work in collaboration with Seattle's Degenerate Art Ensemble to create a piece incorporating music, dance and video. They celebrated their 40th anniversary with a sold-out performance at Zellerbach Hall, UC Berkeley, in December 2013. The same year, Michael Giacchino, a soundtrack composer who often names his pieces with puns, published a piece named after them as a part of the soundtrack to Star Trek Into Darkness (the name of the piece is \\"The Kronos Wartet\\"), for a scene that takes place on the fictional planet \\"Kronos\\" (also spelled \\"Qo'noS\\"). New music, contemporary classical On stage with Laurie Anderson, after performing LANDFALL at the Harris Theater on March 17, 2015 Over 900 pieces have been created for the Kronos Quartet, which has a long history of commissioning new works. They have worked with many minimalist composers including John Adams, Arvo P√§rt, George Crumb, Henryk G√≥recki, Steve Reich, Roberto Paci Dal√≤, Philip Glass, Terry Riley, and Kevin Volans; collaborators hail from a diversity of countries ‚Äì Kaija Saariaho from Finland, Pƒìteris Vasks from Latvia, Franghiz Ali-Zadeh from Azerbaijan, Homayun Sakhi from Afghanistan, Victoria Vita Polev√° from Ukraine and Fernando Otero, Astor Piazzolla, and Osvaldo Golijov from Argentina. Some of Kronos' string-quartet arrangements were published in 2007. Diverse genres Kronos covers a very broad range of musical genres: Mexican folk, experimental, pre- classical early music, movie soundtracks (Requiem for a Dream, Heat, The Fountain), jazz and tango. Kronos has also recorded adaptations of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Purple Haze\\", Sigur R√≥s's \\"Flugufrelsarinn\\", Television's \\"Marquee Moon\\", Raymond Scott's \\"Dinner Music for a Pack of Hungry Cannibals\\", and Bob Dylan's \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\". Kronos has also worked with a variety of global musicians, including Bollywood playback singer Asha Bhosle; Mexican-American painter Gronk; American soprano Dawn Upshaw; jazz composer/performer Pat Metheny; Mexican rockers Caf√© Tacuba; Azerbaijani mugam singer Alim Qasimov; and the Romanian gypsy band Taraf de Ha√Ødouks among others. Kronos has performed live with the poet Allen Ginsberg, Astor Piazzolla, The National, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Tom Waits, David Bowie, Paul McCartney and Bj√∂rk, and has recorded with Nelly Furtado, Rokia Traor√©, Joan Armatrading, Brazilian electronica artist Amon Tobin, Texas yodeler Don Walser, Faith No More, Tiger Lillies and David Grisman. On the 1998 Dave Matthews Band album Before These Crowded Streets, Kronos Quartet performed on the tracks \\"Halloween\\" and \\"The Stone\\". They also recorded for the 2007 Nine Inch Nails remix album, Year Zero Remixed doing a rendition of the track \\"Another Version of the Truth\\"\\". They also performed Lee Brooks' score for the short film 2081, based on the Kurt Vonnegut short story \\"Harrison Bergeron.\\" In 2009, the quartet contributed an acoustic version of Blind Willie Johnson's \\"Dark Was the Night\\" for the AIDS benefit album Dark Was the Night produced by the Red Hot Organization. In 2017, the quartet performed as featured artists on the songs \\"Lost Light\\" and \\"Journey\\" on the soundtrack to the videogame Destiny 2.

In the 1970s, duck hunters prevented the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from dredging and straightening the Cache River. The conservation movement led to the establishment of the National Wildlife Refuge in 1986. The nearby town of Stuttgart, Arkansas calls itself the \\"Rice and Duck Capital of the World.\\" The National Wildlife Refuge runs along the flood-plain of the Cache River for 70 miles (100 km) from the Cache River's mouth at Clarendon, Arkansas to the town of Grubbs, Arkansas. The refuge encompasses land in the Arkansas counties of Jackson, Woodruff, Prairie, and Monroe. The Cache River NWR has gradually expanded to its present size through acquisition from private owners of land. Most of the land in the refuge, and that planned for acquisition, had been drained and used for agriculture. The long-term goal is to re-forest former farming areas with native vegetation along the meandering sloughs, oxbow lakes, swamps, and bald cypress forests of the Cache River and Bayou De View. The Cache River NWR already preserves the largest tract of contiguous bottomland hardwood forest remaining in the United States.\\"Cache River National Wildlife Refuge\\" The Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry- detail.aspx?entryID=3503, accessed 8 July 2013 The refuge currently includes 47,000 acres (134 km2) of bottomland forest and sloughs. It also includes several oxbow lakes and 17,000 acres (30 km2) of formerly agricultural land now in the process of reforestation. The refuge is home to over 50 species of mammals including deer, raccoon, bobcat, and river otter. It also is home for nearly 240 species of birds including ducks, geese, wading birds, and other assorted migratory birds. The swampy bottomlands are also home to 48 species of reptiles and amphibians. The Cache River refuge is the most important wintering area for mallard ducks in North America and also important for other duck and neo-tropic species. It hosts the only native black bear population in Arkansas.GORP http://www.gorp.com/parks-guide/cache-river-national-wildlife- refuge-outdoor-pp2-guide-cid357837.html , accessed 9 July 2013 Other similar protected areas for wildlife located nearby along the Cache and White Rivers include the Bald Knob, Big Lake, and Wapanocca National Wildlife Refuges.

Ivory-billed woodpecker On April 29, 2005, a team from Cornell Lab of Ornithology claimed they had taken a four-second video and recorded audio calls of the ivory-billed woodpecker, believed extinct for 60 years, in the refuge. The woodpecker has not been seen since and whether it was actually seen in 2005 remains a source of considerable debate. Much of the refuge was closed to the public following the announcement.

The boundaries of the area proposed by acquisition include within which land would be purchased from willing buyers and subject to the availability of funds. The objectives of the expansion are to restore the natural ecosystem of land that had been converted to agriculture, to reforest cleared land, and provide a buffer for the present refuge which consists mostly of a narrow corridor along the Cache River and Bayou DeView. Three priority areas for purchase were identified. First, the FWS proposes to acquire up to 38,483 acres between the Cache River and Bayou DeView rivers. The addition of these lands to the refuge would enable the two watersheds to be re-connected and the 85 percent of the land now farmed to be reforested. Secondly, the FWS proposes to purchase 32,600 acres to extend the refuge about 30 miles northward in a narrow strip, now only six percent forested, along Bayou DeView. The third priority area for purchase is the Cache River Peripheral with 29,997 acres which to partially connect the Cache River Refuge with protected lands along the White River. Unique to the Lower Valley of the Mississippi River about 13 percent of this area consists of sand dunes with vegetation adapted to dryer climates. As there are several hundred landowners in the priority areas, acquisition of the land will likely take many years.\\"Cache River expansion Proposal\\" http://www.fws.gov/southeast/cacheriverexpansion/overview.html, accessed 8 July 2013 References External links * Cache River National Wildlife Refuge - official site * Refuges Category:Protected areas of Jackson County, Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Monroe County, Arkansas Category:National Wildlife Refuges in Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Prairie County, Arkansas Category:Ramsar sites in the United States Category:Protected areas of Woodruff County, Arkansas Category:Protected areas established in 1986 Category:1986 establishments in Arkansas Category:Wetlands of Arkansas Category:Landforms of Jackson County, Arkansas Category:Landforms of Monroe County, Arkansas Category:Landforms of Prairie County, Arkansas Category:Landforms of Woodruff County, Arkansas ","title":"Cache River National Wildlife Refuge"},{"id":"337727","title":"Sean Pertwee"},{"id":"337730","text":"BurgerTime is a 1982 arcade game created by Data East initially for its DECO Cassette System. The player is chef Peter Pepper, who must walk over hamburger ingredients located across a maze of platforms while avoiding pursuing characters. In the United States, Data East USA licensed BurgerTime for distribution by Bally Midway as a standard dedicated arcade game. Data East also released its own version of BurgerTime in the United States through its DECO Cassette System. The Data East and Midway versions are distinguished by the manufacturer's name on the title screen and by the marquee and cabinet artworks, as the game itself is identical. The game's original Japanese title was changed outside of Japan to BurgerTime, reportedly to avoid potential trademark issues. In addition to all releases in the Western world, \\"BurgerTime\\" was also the name used on the Japanese ports and sequels. When Data East went bankrupt in 2003, G-Mode bought most of Data East's intellectual properties, including BurgerTime, BurgerTime Deluxe, Super BurgerTime, and Peter Pepper's Ice Cream Factory. Gameplay Screenshot of Data East's arcade version of BurgerTime. The object of the game is to complete a number of hamburgers while avoiding enemy foods. The player controls the protagonist, chef Peter Pepper, with a four-position joystick and a button. Each board consists of a maze of planks and ladders in which giant burger ingredients (buns, patties, lettuce/tomato, etc.) are laid out. When Peter walks the full length of an ingredient, it falls to the level below, knocking down any ingredient that happens to be there. A burger is completed when all of its vertically aligned ingredients have been dropped out of the maze and onto a waiting plate, and the player must complete all burgers to finish the board. Three types of enemy food items wander the maze: Mr. Hot Dog, Mr. Pickle, and Mr. Egg. The player can score extra points by either crushing them under a falling ingredient, or by dropping an ingredient while they are standing on it. In the latter case, the ingredient falls two extra levels for every enemy caught on it. Crushed or dropped enemies return to the maze after a short time. At the start of the game, the player is given a limited number of pepper shots to use against enemies. Pressing the button causes Peter to shake a cloud of pepper in the direction he is facing; any enemy touching the cloud will be stunned for a few seconds, and Peter can safely move through them. Bonus food items such as coffee and ice cream appear on occasion, awarding bonus points and one extra pepper shot when collected. There are six boards of increasing difficulty, with more burgers/ingredients, more enemies, and/or layouts that make it easier for Peter to become cornered by enemies. After the player completes the sixth board, the cycle repeats. The player loses one life whenever Peter touches a non-stunned enemy. When all lives are lost, the game is over. Ports Mattel Electronics obtained the rights to BurgerTime from Data East and released the Intellivision version in 1983. That year they also released versions for the Atari 2600, IBM PC, Apple II, and Aquarius. In 1984 Mattel produced the ColecoVision version, distributed by Coleco. Data East produced a version for the TI-99/4A in 1983 although it wasn't released until 1984, Famicom in 1985, MSX in 1986, and NES in 1987. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed BurgerTime on their June 15, 1983 issue as being the twenty-third most-successful table arcade unit of the year. BurgerTime received a Certificate of Merit in the category of \\"1984 Videogame of the Year (Less than 16K ROM)\\" at the 5th annual Arkie Awards. The Deseret News called BurgerTime \\"one of the real surprises of 1983 for the Intellivision\\", and gave the ColecoVision version three and one half stars. Legacy =Sequels= Flyer for Super BurgerTime An arcade spin-off, Peter Pepper's Ice Cream Factory (1984) and an arcade sequel, (1990), were not widely released. Super BurgerTime stars Peter Pepper Jr. and allows two players to play at once. It is fairly true to the original, but with many added features and a different style of graphics. A console-only sequel, Diner, was created after the 1984 purchase of Intellivision from Mattel by INTV Corp. It was programmed by Ray Kaestner, the programmer of the Intellivision version of BurgerTime. In Diner, Peter Pepper must kick balls of food so that they roll off platforms and down ramps to land on a large plate at the bottom of the screen, while avoiding or crushing enemy food items that are trying to stop him. BurgerTime Deluxe was released for the Game Boy in 1991. Namco released BurgerTime Delight for mobile devices in 2007. It includes \\"new graphics, characters and power-ups\\". There are six \\"arcade levels\\" and eight enhanced mode levels with perils of falling ice and rising fire from the grill. Besides the pepper of the classic game, there is now a salt shaker, that when collected stuns all enemies on the screen. A 3D update, BurgerTime World Tour, was released in 2011 for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network, and in 2012 for WiiWare. It was delisted from Xbox Live Arcade on April 30, 2014. On October 8, 2019, G-Mode and XSEED Games released a re-imagining of the game, titled BurgerTime Party! for the Nintendo Switch, with new modes and redesigns. =Re-releases= The arcade version of BurgerTime has been included in various collections, including Arcade's Greatest Hits: Midway Collection 2 for the PlayStation and Data East Arcade Classics for the Wii. In late 2019/early 2020, it was released with fellow Data East titles Karate Champ, Caveman Ninja and Bad Dudes in an arcade cabinet for home use by manufacturer Arcade1Up. Although the cabinet comes with four games in one, its artwork features only the graphics of Burgertime. The NES and FDS versions were available on the Wii Virtual Console. Its Game Boy counterpart BurgerTime Deluxe was released for the 3DS Virtual Console in 2011. The NES version is also included in the 2017 compilation Data East All- Star Collection for the Nintendo Entertainment System. An updated version of the game has been announced for release exclusively for the Intellivision Amico. =Clones= Clones for home systems include: Mr. Wimpy, Burger Chase, Burger Time (Interceptor Micros), BurgerSpace, Chip Factory, Burger Boy!, Basic Burger, Barmy Burgers, Burger Builder, and Lunchtime. =In popular culture= Peter Pepper appeared in the movies Wreck-It Ralph and Pixels.

The name is derived from The Sacred Harp, a ubiquitous and historically important tunebook printed in shape notes. The work was first published in 1844 and has reappeared in multiple editions ever since. Sacred Harp music represents one branch of an older tradition of American music that developed over the period 1770 to 1820 from roots in New England, with a significant, related development under the influence of \\"revival\\" services around the 1840s. This music was included in, and became profoundly associated with, books using the shape note style of notation popular in America in the 18th and early 19th centuries.David Warren Steel, \\"Shape-note hymnody,\\" in Grove Music Online (Oxford UP: article updated 16 October 2013) Subscription Required Sacred Harp music is performed a cappella (voice only, without instruments) and originated as Protestant music.  The music and its notation  The name of the tradition comes from the title of the shape-note book from which the music is sung, The Sacred Harp. This book exists today in various editions, discussed below. In shape-note music, notes are printed in special shapes that help the reader identify them on the musical scale. There are two prevalent systems, one using four shapes, and one using seven. In the four-shape system used in The Sacred Harp, each of the four shapes is connected to a particular syllable, fa, sol, la, or mi, and these syllables are employed in singing the notes,This is a simplified version of Guidonian solmization which was also used in Elizabethan England: see Solf√®ge#Origin just as in the more familiar system that uses do, re, mi, etc. (see solfege). The four-shape system is able to cover the full musical scale because each syllable-shape combination other than mi is assigned to two distinct notes of the scale. For example, the C major scale would be notated and sung as follows: The C major scale in shape notes The shape for fa is a triangle, sol an oval, la a rectangle, and mi a diamond. In Sacred Harp singing, pitch is not absolute. The shapes and notes designate degrees of the scale, not particular pitches. Thus for a song in the key of C, fa designates C and F; for a song in G, fa designates G and C, and so on; hence it is called a moveable \\"do\\" system. When Sacred Harp singers begin a song, they normally start by singing it with the appropriate syllable for each pitch, using the shapes to guide them. For those in the group not yet familiar with the song, the shapes help with the task of sight reading. The process of reading through the song with the shapes also helps fix the notes in memory. Once the shapes have been sung, the group then sings the verses of the song with their printed words. Singing Sacred Harp music The hollow-square seating arrangement for Sacred Harp singing Sacred Harp groups always sing a cappella, that is to say, without accompanying instruments.In particular, no harps are present. The term \\"Sacred Harp\\" is sometimes taken by singers to be a metaphor for the human voice (Anon. 1940, 127).On a number of early historical recordings, a piano or parlor organ accompanied the singers. In the ensuing decades, the practice of using such instruments has evidently died out. The singers arrange themselves in a hollow square, with rows of chairs or pews on each side assigned to each of the four parts: treble, alto, tenor, and bass. The treble and tenor sections are usually mixed, with men and women singing the notes an octave apart. There is no single leader or conductor; rather, the participants take turns in leading. The leader for a particular round selects a song from the book, and \\"calls\\" it by its page number. Leading is done in an open-palm style, standing in the middle of the square facing the tenors (see: Leading Sacred Harp music). The pitch at which the music is sung is relative; there is no instrument to give the singers a starting point. The leader, or else some particular singer assigned to the task, finds a good pitch with which to begin and intones it to the group. The singers reply with the opening notes of their own parts, and then the song begins immediately. The music is usually sung not literally as it is printed in the book, but with certain deviations established by custom; see Performance practice of Sacred Harp music. As the name implies, Sacred Harp music is sacred music and originated as Protestant Christian music. Many of the songs in the book are hymns that use words, meters, and stanzaic forms familiar from elsewhere in Protestant hymnody. However, Sacred Harp songs are quite different from \\"mainstream\\" Protestant hymns in their musical style: some tunes, known as fuguing tunes, contain sections that are polyphonic in texture, and the harmony tends to deemphasize the interval of the third in favor of fourths and fifths. In their melodies, the songs often use the pentatonic scale or similar \\"gapped\\" (fewer than seven-note) scales. In their musical form, Sacred Harp songs fall into three basic types. Many are ordinary hymn tunes, mostly composed in four-bar phrases and sung in multiple verses. Fuging tunes contain a prominent passage about 1/3 of the way through in which each of the four choral parts enters in succession, in a way resembling a fugue. Anthems are longer songs, less regular in form, that are sung through just once rather than in multiple verses.The harmony and form of Sacred Harp music are discussed in Cobb (1978, chapter 2) and in more technical detail in Horn (1970). =Venues for singing= Sacred Harp singing normally occurs not in church services, but in special gatherings or \\"singings\\" arranged for the purpose. Singings can be local, regional, statewide, or national. Small singings are often held in homes, with perhaps only a dozen singers. Large singings have been known to have more than a thousand participants. The more ambitious singings include an ample potluck dinner in the middle of the day, traditionally called \\"dinner on the grounds.\\" Some of the largest and oldest annual singings are called \\"conventions\\". The oldest Sacred Harp convention was the Southern Musical Convention, organized in Upson County, Georgia in 1845. The two oldest surviving Sacred Harp singing conventions are the Chattahoochee Musical Convention (organized in Coweta County, Georgia in 1852), and the East Texas Sacred Harp Convention (organized as the East Texas Musical Convention in 1855). = Sacred Harp music as participatory music = Performance in Alabama of the tune \\"Schenectady\\", 2011 Sacred Harp singers view their tradition as a participatory one, not a passive one. Those who gather for a singing sing for themselves and for each other, and not for an audience. This can be seen in several aspects of the tradition. First, the seating arrangement (four parts in a square, facing each other) is clearly intended for the singers, not for external listeners. Non-singers are always welcome to attend a singing, but typically they sit among the singers in the back rows of the tenor section, rather than in a designated separate audience location. The leader, being equidistant from all sections, in principle hears the best sound. The often intense sonic experience of standing in the center of the square is considered one of the benefits of leading, and sometimes a guest will be invited as a courtesy to stand next to the leader during a song. The music itself is also meant to be participatory. Most forms of choral composition place the melody on the top (treble) line, where it can be best heard by an audience, with the other parts written so as not to obscure the melody. In contrast, Sacred Harp composers have aimed to make each musical part singable and interesting in its own right, thus giving every singer in the group an absorbing task.Horn (1970, 86) For this reason, \\"bringing out the melody\\" is not a high priority in Sacred Harp composition, and indeed it is customary to assign the melody not to the trebles but to the tenors. Fuging tunes, in which each section gets its moment to shine, also illustrate the importance in Sacred Harp of maintaining the independence of each vocal part. History of Sacred Harp singing Marini (2003) traces the earliest roots of Sacred Harp to the \\"country parish music\\" of early 18th century England. This form of rural church music evolved a number of the distinctive traits that were passed on from tradition to tradition, until they ultimately became part of Sacred Harp singing. These traits included the assignment of the melody to the tenors, harmonic structure emphasizing fourths and fifths, and the distinction between the ordinary four- part hymn (\\"plain tune\\"), the anthem, and the fuging tune. Several composers of this school, including Joseph Stephenson and Aaron Williams, are represented in the 1991 Edition of The Sacred Harp. For further information on the English roots of Sacred Harp music, see West gallery music.Sources for this paragraph: Marini (2003, 77), Temperley (1983), and the essay \\"Distant Roots of Shape Note Music\\" by Keith Willard, posted at the fasola.org web site ( ). Around the mid 18th century, the forms and styles of English country parish music were introduced to America, notably in a new tunebook called Urania, published 1764 by the singing master James Lyon.Marini (2003, 78) This stimulus soon led to the development of a robust native school of composition, signaled by the 1770 publication of William Billings's The New England Psalm Singer, and then by a great number of new compositions by Billings and those who followed in his path. The work of these composers, sometimes called the \\"First New England School\\", forms a major part of the Sacred Harp to this day. Billings and his followers worked as singing masters, who led singing schools. The purpose of these schools was to train young people in the correct singing of sacred music. This pedagogical movement flourished, and led ultimately to the invention of shape notes, which originated as a way to make the teaching of singing easier. The first shape note tunebook appeared in 1801: The Easy InstructorDick Hulan writes, \\"My copy of William Smith's Easy Instructor, Part II (1803) attributes the invention [of shape notes] to 'J. Conly of Philadelphia'.\\" According to David Warren Steel, in John Wyeth and the Development of Southern Folk Hymnody, \\"This notation was invented by Philadelphia merchant John Connelly, who on 10 March 1798 signed over his rights to the system to Little and Smith.\\" Andrew Law also laid claim to the invention of the shape note system. by William Smith and William Little. At first, Smith and Little's shapes competed with a rival system, created by Andrew Law (1749‚Äì1821) in his The Musical Primer of 1803. Although this book came out two years later than Smith and Little's book, Law claimed earlier invention of shape notes. In his system, a square indicated fa, a circle sol, a triangle la and a diamond, mi. Law used the shaped notes without a musical staff. The Smith and Little shapes ultimately prevailed. Shape notes became very popular, and during the first part of the nineteenth century, a whole series of shape note tunebooks appeared, many of which were widely distributed. As the population spread west and south, the tradition of shape note singing expanded geographically. Composition flourished, with the new music often drawing on the tradition of folk song for tunes and inspiration. Probably the most successful shape note book prior to The Sacred Harp was William Walker's Southern Harmony, published in 1835 and still in use today.The shape note systems continued to evolve throughout the 19th century; for a more complete history, see shape note. Even as they flourished and spread, shape notes and the kind of participatory music which they served came under attack. The critics were from the urban-based \\"better music\\" movement, spearheaded by Lowell Mason, which advocated a more \\"scientific\\" style of sacred music, more closely based on the harmonic styles of contemporaneous European music. The new style gradually prevailed. Shape notes and their music disappeared from the cities prior to the Civil War, and from the rural areas of the Northeast and Midwest in the following decades. However, they retained a haven in the rural South, which remained a fertile territory for the creation of new shapenote publications.Source for this paragraph: Marini (2003, 81). Evidence that Americans outside the rural South were slow, even reluctant, to give up their old music is given in Horn (1970, ch. 12). = The arrival of The Sacred Harp = Sacred Harp singing came into being with the 1844 publication of Benjamin Franklin White and Elisha J. King's The Sacred Harp. It was this book, now distributed in several different versions, that came to be the shape note tradition with the largest number of participants. B. F. White (1800-1879) was originally from Union County, South Carolina, but since 1842 had been living in Harris County, Georgia. He prepared The Sacred Harp in collaboration with a younger man, E. J. King, (ca. 1821‚Äì44), who was from Talbot County, Georgia. Together they compiled, transcribed, and composed tunes, and published a book of over 250 songs. King died soon after the book was published, and White was left to guide its growth. He was responsible for organizing singing schools and conventions at which The Sacred Harp was used as the songbook. During his lifetime, the book became popular and would go through three revisions (1850, 1859, and 1869), all produced by committees consisting of White and several colleagues working under the auspices of the Southern Musical Convention. The first two new editions simply added appendices of new songs to the back of the book. The 1869 revision was more extensive, removing some of the less popular songs and adding new ones in their places. From the original 262 pages, the book was expanded by 1869 to 477. This edition was reprinted and continued in use for several decades. =Origin of the modern editions= Around the turn of the 20th century, Sacred Harp singing entered a period of conflict over the issue of traditionalism. The conflict ultimately split the community.The primary source for this section is Cobb (2001, chapter 4). B. F. White had died in 1879 before completing a fourth revision of his book; thus the version that Sacred Harp participants were singing from was by the turn of the century over three decades old. During this time, the musical tastes of Sacred Harp's traditional adherents, the inhabitants of the rural South, had changed in important ways. Notably, gospel music - syncopated and chromatic, often with piano accompaniment - had become popular, along with a number of church hymns of the \\"mainstream\\" variety, such as \\"Rock of Ages.\\" Seven-shape notation systems had appeared and won adherents away from the older four-shape system (see shape note for details). As time passed, Sacred Harp singers doubtless became aware that what they were singing had become quite distinct from contemporary tastes. The natural path to take‚Äîand the one ultimately taken‚Äîwould be to assert the archaic character of Sacred Harp as an outright virtue. In this view, Sacred Harp should be treasured as a time-tested musical tradition, standing above current trends of fashion. The difficulty with adopting traditionalism as a guiding doctrine was that different singers had different opinions about just what form the stable, traditionalized version of Sacred Harp would take. The first move was made by W. M. Cooper, of Dothan, Alabama, a leading Sacred Harp teacher in his own region, but not part of the inner circle of B. F. White's old colleagues and descendants. In 1902 Cooper prepared a revision of The Sacred Harp that, while retaining most of the old songs, also added new tunes that reflected more contemporary music styles.Miller (2004) characterizes Cooper book style thus: it \\"contains a greater proportion of \\"camp meeting\\" songs than the Denson book, with more compressed part-writing, chromatic harmonies, and choruses characterized by call-and-response rather than \\"fuging\\" style. Denson book singers generally say that the Cooper book sounds more like \\"new book or gospel singing.\\" Cooper made other changes, too: *He retitled many old songs. These songs were formerly named by their tune, using arbitrarily chosen place names (\\"New Britain\\", \\"Northfield\\", \\"Charlestown\\"). The new names were based on the text; thus \\"New Britain\\" became \\"Amazing Grace\\", \\"Northfield\\" became \\"How Long, Dear Savior\\", and so on. The old system was intended in colonial times to permit mixing and matching of tunes and texts, but was unnecessary in a system where the pairing of tune and text was fixed. *He transposed some songs into new keys. This is thought to have brought the notation closer to actual performing practice. *He wrote new alto parts for the many songs that originally just had three vocal lines. The Cooper revision was a success, being widely adopted in many areas of the South, such as Florida, southern Alabama, and Texas, where it has continued as the predominant Sacred Harp book to this day. The \\"Cooper book,\\" as it is now often called, was revised by Cooper himself in 1907 and 1909. His son-in-law published the book in 1927, including an appendix compiled by revision committee. The Sacred Harp Book Company was formed in 1949, and subsequent revision has been supervised by editorial committees under its instruction. New editions were issued in 1950, 1960, 1992, 2000, 2006 and 2012. In the original core geographic area of Sacred Harp singing, northern Alabama and Georgia, the singers did not in general take to the Cooper book, as they felt it deviated too far from the original tradition. Obtaining a new book for these singers was made more difficult by the fact that B. F. White's son James L. White, who would have been the natural choice to prepare a new edition, was a non-traditionalist. His \\"fifth edition\\" (1909)This edition may be viewed in digital form at . won little support among singers, while his \\"fourth edition with supplement\\" (1911) enjoyed some success in a few areas.Cobb, Buell E. (2001) The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music pp. 98-110 Ultimately, a committee headed by Joseph Stephen James produced an edition entitled Original Sacred Harp (1911) that largely satisfied the wishes of this community of singers.Cobb, Buell E. (2001) The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music pp. 94-98 \\"Original Sacred Harp (Denson Revision)\\" The James edition was further revised in 1936 by a committee under the leadership of the brothers Seaborn and Thomas Denson, both influential singing school teachers. Both died shortly before the project was complete, and the remaining work was overseen by Paine Denson, son of Thomas. This book was entitled Original Sacred Harp, Denson Revision, and was itself revised 1960, 1967, and 1971;Cobb, Buell E. (2001) The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music pp. 110-117 a more thorough revision and remodeling of this book, overseen by Hugh McGraw, is known simply as the \\"1991 Edition,\\" though some singers still call it the \\"Denson book.\\" Even the highly traditionalist James and Denson books followed Cooper in adding alto parts to most of the old three-part songs (these alto parts led to an unsuccessful lawsuit by Cooper).Cobb, Buell E. (2001) The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music pp. 95-96 Some people (see for instance the reference by Buell Cobb given below) believe that the new alto parts imposed an esthetic cost by filling in the former stark open harmonies of the three-part songs. Wallace McKenzie (reference below) argues to the contrary, basing his view on a systematic study of representative songs.McKenzie further judges that the Cooper alto parts were more successful than the Denson ones in retaining the original harmonic style. In any event, there is little support today for abandoning the added alto parts, since most singers give a high priority to giving every side of the square its own part to sing. It was thus that the traditionalism debate split the Sacred Harp community, and there seems little prospect that it will ever reunite under a single book. However, there have been no further splits. Both the Denson and the Cooper groups adopted traditionalist views for the particular form of Sacred Harp they favored, and these forms have now been stable for about a century. The strength of traditionalism can be seen in the front matter of the two hymnbooks. The Denson book is forthrightly Biblical in its defense of tradition: > DEDICATED TO All lovers of Sacred Harp Music, and to the memory of the > illustrious and venerable patriarchs who established the Traditional Style > of Sacred Harp singing and admonished their followers to \\"seek the old paths > and walk therein\\".The passage quotes Jeremiah 6:16: \\"Thus saith the LORD, > Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good > way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls.\\" The Cooper book also shows a warm appreciation of tradition: > May God bless everyone as we endeavor to promote and enjoy Sacred Harp music > and to continue the rich tradition of those who have gone before us. To say that both communities are traditionalist does not mean they discourage the creation of new songs. To the contrary, it is part of the tradition that musically creative Sacred Harp singers should become composers themselves and add to the canon. The new compositions are prepared in traditional styles, and could be considered a kind of tribute to the older material. New songs have been incorporated into editions of The Sacred Harp throughout the 20th century. =Other Sacred Harp books= Two other books are currently used by Sacred Harp singers. A few singers in north Georgia employ the \\"White book,\\" an expanded version of the 1869 B. F. White edition edited by J. L. White. African-American Sacred Harp singers, although primarily users of the Cooper book, also make use of a supplementary volume, The Colored Sacred Harp, produced by Judge Jackson (1883‚Äì1958) in 1934 and later revised in two subsequent editions. In his book Judge Jackson and The Colored Sacred Harp, Joe Dan Boyd identified four regions of Sacred Harp singing among African- Americans: eastern Texas (Cooper book), northern Mississippi (Denson book), south Alabama and Florida (Cooper book), and New Jersey (Cooper book). The Colored Sacred Harp is limited to the New Jersey and south Alabama-Florida groups. Sacred Harp was \\"exported\\" from south Alabama to New Jersey. It appears to have died out among the African-Americans in eastern Texas. In summary, three revisions of and one companion book to The Sacred Harp are currently in use in Sacred Harp singing: *The Sacred Harp, 1991 edition (the \\"Denson book\\"). Carrollton, GA: Sacred Harp Publishing Company. *The Sacred Harp, Revised Cooper Edition, 2012. Samson, AL: The Sacred Harp Book Company. *The Sacred Harp, J. L. White Fourth Edition, with Supplement (the \\"White book\\"). Atlanta, GA: J. L. White. Released 1911; republished 2007. *The Colored Sacred Harp. Ozark, AL: Judge Jackson. [3rd revised edition (1992) includes rudiments by H. J. Jackson (son of J. Jackson) and an autobiography of Judge Jackson]. Sacred Harp books generally contain a section on rudiments, describing the basics of music and Sacred Harp singing. =The spread of Sacred Harp singing in modern times= In recent years, Sacred Harp singing has experienced a resurgence in popularity, as it is discovered by new participants who did not grow up in the tradition.For an extended narrative of this spread, see Bealle (1997, chapter 4). New singers typically strive to follow the original southern customs at their singings. Traditional singers have responded to this need by providing help in orienting the newcomers. For instance, the Rudiments section of the 1991 Denson edition includes information on how to hold a singing; this information would be superfluous in a traditional context, but is important for a group starting up on its own. The tradition of the singing master is still carried on today, and singing masters from traditional Sacred Harp regions often travel outside the South to teach. In recent years an annual summer camp has been established, at which newcomers can learn to sing Sacred Harp. The U.S. beyond the South There are now strong Sacred Harp singing communities in most major urban areas of the United States, and in many rural areas, as well.A guide to singings that demonstrates this dramatic spread may be found at the \\"fasola.org\\" web site, under http://fasola.org/singings/ . One of the first groups of singers formed outside the traditional Southern home region of Sacred Harp singing was in the Chicago area.Miller (2004) The first Illinois convention was held in 1985, with enthusiastic and strongly proactive support by prominent Southern traditional singers. The Midwest Convention is now acknowledged to be one of the major American conventions, attracting hundreds of singers from all over the US and abroad. Similarly, the Sacred Harp singing community in western New England has become a prominent one in recent years. In March 2008, the 2008 Western Massachusetts Sacred Harp Convention attracted over 300 singers from 25 states and a number of foreign countries. Other prominent singing conventions outside the South include, for example, the Keystone Convention in Pennsylvania, the Missouri Convention, and the Minnesota State Convention, which began in 1990. Sacred Harp Singing beyond the US In more recent times Sacred Harp singing has spread beyond the borders of the United States. The United Kingdom has had an active Sacred Harp community since the 1990s. The first UK Sacred Harp convention took place in 1996. There are regular singings in London, the Home Counties, the Midlands, Yorkshire, Lancashire, Manchester, Brighton, Newcastle, Durham, southwest England, Bristol, as well as in Scotland. Canada has a decades-long tradition of Sacred Harp singing, particularly in Southern Ontario and the Eastern Townships of Quebec. Singings have been organized weekly in Montreal, Quebec since 2011, as well as a monthly afternoon sing, and the first Montreal all-day sing took place in the spring of 2016. Sacred Harp singing has happened on a monthly basis for years in Toronto. Australia has had Sacred Harp singing since 2001, and singings are held regularly in Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra and Blackwood. The first Australian All Day Singing was held in Sydney in 2012. In January 2009, Sacred Harp singing was introduced to Ireland, by Dr Juniper Hill of University College Cork, spreading quickly from a class module into the wider community. In March 2011 U.C.C. hosted the first annual Ireland Sacred Harp Convention, and the Cork community held their first All-Day Singing on 22 October 2011. There are now also growing Sacred Harp communities in Belfast and Dublin. In the most recent development, Sacred Harp singing has expanded beyond the limits of English-speaking countries to mainland Europe. In 2008 a singing community was established in Poland (which hosted the first Camp Fasola Europe in September 2012). In Germany there are regular weekly or monthly singings in Bremen, Hamburg, Berlin, Cologne and Munich, most of them with their own annual All-Day singings. Elsewhere in Germany, singers meet irregularly in Frankfurt, Gie√üen and N√ºrnberg. Recently groups have started up in Amsterdam, Paris and Clermont-Ferrand Oslo, Norway, and Uppsala, Sweden. Both the Swedish and Norwegian groups have arranged All Day Singings, the 5th Oslo All-Day Singing will be arranged 1 June.-2. 2019 (singing school starting Friday evening). Regular singings are also taking place in Israel, and in April, 2016, an all-day singing was held in Paris, France. =Use in popular works= Sacred Harp singing appears as diegetic music in the films Cold Mountain (2004) and Lawless (2012), and as background music in The Ladykillers (2004). The 2010 song \\"Tell Me Why\\" by M.I.A. includes a sample of \\"The Last Words of Copernicus\\" by Sarah Lancaster, recorded at the 1959 United Sacred Harp Convention in Fyffe, Alabama, by Alan Lomax. The album version of Bruce Springsteen's \\"Death to My Hometown\\" (2012) also samples this recording. Electronic musician Holly Herndon's 2019 track \\"Frontier\\" includes a performance of Herndon's music by a singing class in Berlin, Germany. Origins of the music The music used in Sacred Harp singing is eclectic. Most of the songs can be assigned to one of four historical layers. There are a few additional songs in The Sacred Harp, 1991 edition that cannot be assigned to any of these four main layers. There are some very old songs of European origin, as well as songs from the English rural tradition that inspired the early New England composers. There are also a handful of songs by European classical composers (Ignaz Pleyel, Thomas Arne, and Henry Rowley Bishop).The book even includes five hymns by Lowell Mason, long ago the implacable enemy of the tradition that The Sacred Harp has preserved to this day.See the online Index to the Denson edition: http://fasola.org/indexes/1991/?v=composer The description just given is based on The Sacred Harp, 1991 edition, also known as the Denson edition. The widely used \\"Cooper\\" edition overlaps considerably (about 60%) in content, but also includes many later songs. A detailed comparison of the two editions has been made by Sacred Harp scholar Gaylon L. Powell. Other books with the title Sacred Harp The Sacred Harp was a popular name for 19th century hymn and tune books, with no fewer than four bearing the title. The first of these was compiled by John Hoyt Hickok and printed in Lewistown, Pennsylvania in 1832. The second was compiled by Lowell and Timothy Mason and printed in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1834, as part of the \\"better music\\" movement mentioned above. The publisher released their book as a shape note edition, while they preferred to urbanize their audience by releasing a round note edition.Jackson (1933b, 395)Gould (55) The third Sacred Harp was the one by B. F. White and E. J. King (1844), the origin of today's Sacred Harp singing tradition. Lastly, according to W. J. Reynolds, writing in Hymns of Our Faith, there was yet a fourth Sacred Harp - The Sacred Harp published by J. M. D. Cates in Nashville, Tennessee in 1867.

The Gospel Book, Evangelion, or Book of the Gospels (Greek: , Evang√©lion) is a codex or bound volume containing one or more of the four Gospels of the Christian New Testament ‚Äì normally all four ‚Äì centering on the life of Jesus of Nazareth and the roots of the Christian faith. The term is also used of the liturgical book, also called the Evangeliary, from which are read the portions of the Gospels used in the Mass and other services, arranged according to the order of the liturgical calendar. Liturgical use in churches of a distinct Gospel book remains normal, often compulsory, in Eastern Christianity, and very common in Roman Catholicism and some parts of Anglicanism and Lutheranism. Other Protestant churches normally just use a complete Bible. History Folio 72 verso of the Codex Aureus of Lorsch. Christ in Majesty In the Middle Ages, the production of copies of the Bible in its entirety was rare because of the huge expense of the parchment required. Individual books or collections of books were produced for specific purposes. From the 4th century Gospel Books were produced for liturgical use, as well as private study and as \\"display books\\" for ceremonial and ornamental purposes.Calkins, 31 The Codex Washingtonianus (Freer gospels) is an early example of a book containing only the four gospels, in Greek, written in the 4th or 5th century. By the 7th century particular gospel texts were allocated to days in the liturgical calendar; previously gospel readings had often worked through the books in sequence.Calkins, 18-19 Many of these volumes were elaborate; the Gospel Book was the most common form of heavily illuminated manuscript until about the 11th century, when the Romanesque Bible and Psalter largely superseded it in the West. In the East they remained a significant subject for illumination until the arrival of printing. The Evangelist portrait was a particular feature of their decoration.Calkins, 23-29, and chapters 1 and 3 Most of the masterpieces of both Insular and Ottonian illumination are Gospel Books,Calkins, chapters 1 and 3 deals with these in turn and there are very many Byzantine and Carolingian examples. But most Gospel Books were never illuminated at all, or only with decorated initials and other touches. They often contained, in addition to the text of the Gospels themselves, supporting texts including Canon Tables, summaries, glossaries, and other explanatory material. Latin books often include the Letter of Jerome to Pope Damasus where Jerome set out to the Pope the reasoning behind his new Vulgate translation and arrangement of the texts, and many Greek ones the Epistula ad Carpianum (Letter to Carpian) of Eusebius of Caesarea explaining the Eusebian Canons he had devised.Calkins, 25 Luxury illuminated gospel books were mainly a feature of the Early Middle Ages, as the evangeliary or a general lectionary gradually became more common for liturgical use, and other texts became most favoured for elaborate decoration.Calkins, 148-150 Western use In current Roman Catholic usage, the Book of the Gospels or Evangeliary contains the full text of the passages from all four gospels that the deacon or priest is to read or chant at Mass in the course of the liturgical year. However, use of the Book of the Gospels is not mandatory, and the gospel readings are also included in the standard Lectionary.Deiss, 36-37\\"The Proclamation of the Gospel at Mass\\" (The Catholic Liturgical Library) The Book of the Gospels, if used, is brought to the altar in the entrance procession, while the Lectionary may not.General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 120 When carried in procession, the Book of the Gospels is held slightly elevated, though not over the head. It is particularly proper for the deacon to carry the Book of the Gospels in procession, as the reading of the gospel is his particular province. When there is no deacon, the Book may be carried by a lector.Deiss, 38-39 2008 Midnight Mass at The Cathedral of Saint Peter the Apostle in Jackson, MS Upon reaching the altar, the deacon or lector bows in veneration of the altar, then places the Book upon the altar, where it remains until the Alleluia.Commentary, 128 During the singing of the Alleluia, the deacon (who before proclaiming the gospel receives the presiding priest's blessing), or in his absence, a priest, removes the Book from the altar and processes with it to the ambo. If incense is used, the Book of the Gospels is censed by the deacon before the reading or chanting. An altar server or acolyte will swing the censer slowly during the reading or chanting.Paul Turner, \\"The Book of the Gospels\\" The Book of the Gospels remains on the ambo until the Mass concludes, unless it is taken to a bishop to be kissed, after which it may be placed on the credence table or another appropriate and dignified place.Edward McNamara, \\"A Place for the Book of the Gospels\\" If the Rite of Dismissal of catechumens is celebrated, the Book of the Gospels is carried in procession in front of the catechumens as they leave the church. =Episcopal Church in America= St. Mary's Episcopal Church. In the Episcopal Church in the United States of America the practice of using a Gospel Book was recovered with the 1979 US Book of Common Prayer, which suggests that the lessons and gospel \\"be read from a book or books of appropriate size and dignity\\".1979 US Book of Common Prayer, p. 406 Following this several publishers have produced gospel books for use in the Episcopal Church, and other books have been privately compiled. A deacon, server or acolyte usually carries the gospel book in the entrance procession, holding the book as high as possible with arms fully extended, and places it on the altar until time for the gospel proclamation. Afterward, it may be returned to the altar or placed on a side table or a stand. Eastern use =Eastern Orthodox= Jewelled and enamelled Gospel book belonging to Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich (Trinity Monastery, Aleksandrov). Among Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholics the Gospel Book (Greek: Œï·ΩêŒ±Œ≥Œ≥Œ≠ŒªŒπŒøŒΩ, Evang√©lion) is very important liturgically. It is considered to be an icon of Christ, and is venerated in the same manner as an icon. The Gospel Book contains the readings that are used at Matins, the Divine Liturgy, Molebens, and other services. Among the Greeks the modern liturgical Gospel Book is laid out in order of the cycle of readings as they occur in the ecclesiastical year, with a section in the back providing the Gospel readings for Matins, Feasts and special occasions, and is thus strictly an evangeliary rather than a gospel book. In the Slavic usage, the Gospel Book contains the full text of the four Gospels in canonical order (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John), with annotations in the margins to indicate the beginning and ending of each reading, and a table of readings in the back. Occasionally it will contain pre-arranged texts of the more complex composite readings, such as the Twelve Gospels read at Matins on Good Friday. Traditionally, the Orthodox will never cover the Gospel Book in leather--the skin of a dead animal--because the words of Christ are considered to be life-giving. Animal skins are also reminiscent of the Fall of Man, when God fashioned garments of skin for Adam and Eve after their disobedience (). The Apostle Paul speaks of Christ being the \\"New Adam\\" (), and the Orthodox understand Christ as coming to clothe mankind in the original \\"garments of light\\" which Adam and Eve lost in Paradise. Traditionally, the Gospel is covered in gold, the earthly element which is best symbolizes the glory of Heaven. If gold is unavailable, the Gospel may be covered in cloth. The Gospel Book rests on the center of the Holy Table (Altar), as the Cross of Christ was planted in the center of the earth. This placement of the Gospel Book also represents the activity of Christ at the Creation (the square Altar representing the created world). The Gospel rests upon the antimension, which remains on the Altar at all times, as Christ will remain with the Church until the end of the world (). Even when the antimension is unfolded to receive the chalice and diskos, the Gospel Book is not removed from the Holy Table, but is stood upright in front of the Tabernacle. Reading the Gospel during the Divine Liturgy. The Divine Liturgy begins with the priest lifting the Gospel Book high and making the sign of the cross with it over the Altar. The Gospel Book is carried in procession at specific times, accompanied by candles. The most frequent occurrence is during the Divine Liturgy when it is carried in the Little EntranceIn the Greek usage, the processional cross and fans are used in the Little Entrance as well. With the Russians, the fans are usually only used when a Bishop is celebrating. which precedes the Epistle and Gospel readings. It is also carried in the Crucessions at Pascha and Theophany. After reading from the Gospel, the priest will bless the faithful with it. At Sunday Matins, after the Gospel reading, all come forward to venerate the Gospel Book and receive the blessing of the priest or bishop. Whenever an Eastern Christian goes to Confession he or she will confess before a Gospel Book and the Cross. In traditional Orthodox countries, when a person takes a vow or oath, he usually does so before a Gospel Book and Cross. Near the end of the Sacred Mystery of Holy Unction, the person or persons that were anointed will kneel and the Gospel Book is opened and placed on their heads, with the writing down. While the chief priest says a special Prayer of the Gospel. When a Bishop is Consecrated, he kneels, touching his forehead to the Altar, and the Gospel Book is opened and placed with the text down over his neck, while the consecrating bishops place their hands on the Gospel and say the Prayer of Consecration. When a Synod of bishops meets, a Gospel Book is often enthroned in a prominent place to show that Christ Himself presides over the meeting. When a priest or bishop is buried, he is buried with a Gospel Book resting on his chest, as an indication of his vocation to preach the Gospel to all men. The funeral service for a priest and bishop will have several readings from the Gospels, to indicate the importance of the Gospel to his ministry. =Armenian use= In the Armenian Apostolic Church and the Armenian Catholic Church, during the reading of the Gospel, the deacon holds a piece of fine fabric in his hands, and with that he holds the Gospel Book. It is considered improper to touch the Gospel Book with bare hands. No lectern is provided for the Gospel reading in the Armenian sanctuary.

He was born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Little studied law there with Charles Young and was admitted to the bar in 1844. He came to Newfoundland in 1846 and articled in law, the first Roman Catholic to practise law in St. John's. His strong views on responsible government, his connections in St. John's Catholic society, and his ability to unite disparate elements of the Liberal Party propelled him to a leadership role in politics. He helped lead the charge for responsible government along with John Kent. After it was granted in 1854, he went on to run a successful campaign as leader of the predominantly Roman Catholic Liberal Party. He became Newfoundland's first Premier in 1855 and served concurrently as the colony's Attorney-General. D.W. Prowse would record that it was, \\"as near to perfection as possible\\". With the period of 1855-1857 described as being \\"the sunshine of prosperity.\\" Little only remained in office until July 15, 1858, when he resigned to be succeeded by John Kent. He resigned in 1858 saying \\"I go now before the milk of Human kindness goes sour for me\\". He was right in that Newfoundland was about to enter an era of sectarian strife. He was appointed as appointed assistant justice on the Supreme Court of Newfoundland in September 1858 and became Chief Justice two months later. In 1861, riots broke out over disputed election results from Harbour Grace. Little, as Chief Justice, played a prominent role in dispersing and calming the crowds. Personal life He married Mary Jane Holdright, from a wealthy Anglo-Irish family, in 1864. Philip Little retired to Ireland in 1868 and worked for the Home Rule movement there. He and his wife had 13 children, the youngest of whom, Patrick, became a politician. Philip Francis Little died at age 73 in 1897 in Monkstown, County Dublin.

Testing nuclear weapons offers practical information about how the weapons function, as well as how detonations are affected by different conditions; and how personnel, structures, and equipment are affected when subjected to nuclear explosions. However, nuclear testing has often been used as an indicator of scientific and military strength, and many tests have been overtly political in their intention; most nuclear weapons states publicly declared their nuclear status by means of a nuclear test. The first nuclear device was detonated as a test by the United States at the Trinity site on July 16, 1945, with a yield approximately equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT. The first thermonuclear weapon technology test of an engineered device, codenamed \\"Ivy Mike\\", was tested at the Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands on November 1, 1952 (local date), also by the United States. The largest nuclear weapon ever tested was the \\"Tsar Bomba\\" of the Soviet Union at Novaya Zemlya on October 30, 1961, with the largest yield ever seen, an estimated 50‚Äì58 megatons. In 1963, three (UK, US, Soviet Union) of the then four nuclear states and many non-nuclear states signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty, pledging to refrain from testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, underwater, or in outer space. The treaty permitted underground nuclear testing. France continued atmospheric testing until 1974, and China continued until 1980. Neither has signed the treaty.\\"The Treaty has not been signed by France or by the People's Republic of China.\\" U.S. Department of State, Limited Test Ban Treaty. Underground tests in the Soviet Union continued until 1990, the United Kingdom until 1991, in the United States until 1992 (its last nuclear test), and both China and France until 1996. In signing the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996, these states have pledged to discontinue all nuclear testing; the treaty has not yet entered into force because of failure to be ratified by eight countries. Non-signatories India and Pakistan last tested nuclear weapons in 1998. North Korea conducted nuclear tests in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016, and 2017. The most recent confirmed nuclear test in September 2017 in North Korea. Types underground, 3. exoatmospheric, and 4. underwater Nuclear weapons tests have historically been divided into four categories reflecting the medium or location of the test. *Atmospheric testing designates explosions that take place in the atmosphere. Generally these have occurred as devices detonated on towers, balloons, barges, islands, or dropped from airplanes, and also those only buried far enough to intentionally create a surface-breaking crater. The United States, the Soviet Union, and China have all conducted tests involving explosions of missile-launched bombs (See List of nuclear weapons tests#Tests of live warheads on rockets). Nuclear explosions close enough to the ground to draw dirt and debris into their mushroom cloud can generate large amounts of nuclear fallout due to irradiation of the debris. This definition of atmospheric is used in the Limited Test Ban Treaty, which banned this class of testing along with exoatmospheric and underwater. *Underground testing refers to nuclear tests conducted under the surface of the earth, at varying depths. Underground nuclear testing made up the majority of nuclear tests by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War; other forms of nuclear testing were banned by the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963. True underground tests are intended to be fully contained and emit a negligible amount of fallout. Unfortunately these nuclear tests do occasionally \\"vent\\" to the surface, producing from nearly none to considerable amounts of radioactive debris as a consequence. Underground testing, almost by definition, causes seismic activity of a magnitude that depends on the yield of the nuclear device and the composition of the medium in which it is detonated, and generally creates a subsidence crater.For an overview of the preparations and considerations used in underground nuclear testing, see For a longer and more technical discussion, see In 1976, the United States and the USSR agreed to limit the maximum yield of underground tests to 150 kt with the Threshold Test Ban Treaty. Underground testing also falls into two physical categories: tunnel tests in generally horizontal tunnel drifts, and shaft tests in vertically drilled holes. *Exoatmospheric testing refers to nuclear tests conducted above the atmosphere. The test devices are lifted on rockets. These high altitude nuclear explosions can generate a nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NEMP) when they occur in the ionosphere, and charged particles resulting from the blast can cross hemispheres following geomagnetic lines of force to create an auroral display. *Underwater testing involves nuclear devices being detonated underwater, usually moored to a ship or a barge (which is subsequently destroyed by the explosion). Tests of this nature have usually been conducted to evaluate the effects of nuclear weapons against naval vessels (such as in Operation Crossroads), or to evaluate potential sea-based nuclear weapons (such as nuclear torpedoes or depth charges). Underwater tests close to the surface can disperse large amounts of radioactive particles in water and steam, contaminating nearby ships or structures, though they generally do not create fallout other than very locally to the explosion. =Salvo tests= Another way to classify nuclear tests are by the number of explosions that constitute the test. The treaty definition of a salvo test is: > In conformity with treaties between the United States and the Soviet Union, > a salvo is defined, for multiple explosions for peaceful purposes, as two or > more separate explosions where a period of time between successive > individual explosions does not exceed 5 seconds and where the burial points > of all explosive devices can be connected by segments of straight lines, > each of them connecting two burial points, and the total length does not > exceed 40 kilometers. For nuclear weapon tests, a salvo is defined as two or > more underground nuclear explosions conducted at a test site within an area > delineated by a circle having a diameter of two kilometers and conducted > within a total period of time of 0.1 second. The USSR has exploded up to eight devices in a single salvo test; Pakistan's second and last official test exploded four different devices. Almost all lists in the literature are lists of tests; in the lists in Wikipedia (for example, Operation Cresset has separate items for Cremino and Caerphilly, which together constitute a single test), the lists are of explosions. Purpose Separately from these designations, nuclear tests are also often categorized by the purpose of the test itself. * Weapons-related tests are designed to garner information about how (and if) the weapons themselves work. Some serve to develop and validate a specific weapon type. Others test experimental concepts or are physics experiments meant to gain fundamental knowledge of the processes and materials involved in nuclear detonations. * Weapons effects tests are designed to gain information about the effects of the weapons on structures, equipment, organisms and the environment. They are mainly used to assess and improve survivability to nuclear explosions in civilian and military contexts, tailor weapons to their targets, and develop the tactics of nuclear warfare. * Safety experiments are designed to study the behavior of weapons in simulated accident scenarios. In particular, they are used to verify that a (significant) nuclear detonation cannot happen by accident. They include one-point safety tests and simulations of storage and transportation accidents. * Nuclear test detection experiments are designed to improve the capabilities to detect, locate, and identify nuclear detonations, in particular to monitor compliance with test-ban treaties. In the United States these tests are associated with Operation Vela Uniform before the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty stopped all nuclear testing among signatories. * Peaceful nuclear explosions were conducted to investigate non-military applications of nuclear explosives. In the United States these were performed under the umbrella name of Operation Plowshare. Aside from these technical considerations, tests have been conducted for political and training purposes, and can often serve multiple purposes.  Alternatives to full-scale testing  Subcritical experiment at the Nevada National Security Site Hydronuclear tests study nuclear materials under the conditions of explosive shock compression. They can create subcritical conditions, or supercritical conditions with yields ranging from negligible all the way up to a substantial fraction of full weapon yield. Critical mass experiments determine the quantity of fissile material required for criticality with a variety of fissile material compositions, densities, shapes, and reflectors. They can be subcritical or supercritical, in which case significant radiation fluxes can be produced. This type of test has resulted in several criticality accidents. Subcritical (or cold) tests are any type of tests involving nuclear materials and possibly high-explosives (like those mentioned above) that purposely result in no yield. The name refers to the lack of creation of a critical mass of fissile material. They are the only type of tests allowed under the interpretation of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty tacitly agreed to by the major atomic powers. Subcritical tests continue to be performed by the United States, Russia, and the People's Republic of China, at least.

The explosives might be spiked with radioactive materials to simulate fallout dispersal. History The Phoenix of Hiroshima (foreground) in Hong Kong Harbor in 1967, was involved in several famous anti-nuclear protest voyages against nuclear testing in the Pacific. The expanse of the Semipalatinsk Test Site (indicated in red), attached to Kurchatov (along the Irtysh river). The site comprised an area the size of Wales. The first atomic weapons test was conducted near Alamogordo, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945, during the Manhattan Project, and given the codename \\"Trinity\\". The test was originally to confirm that the implosion-type nuclear weapon design was feasible, and to give an idea of what the actual size and effects of a nuclear explosion would be before they were used in combat against Japan. While the test gave a good approximation of many of the explosion's effects, it did not give an appreciable understanding of nuclear fallout, which was not well understood by the project scientists until well after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The United States conducted six atomic tests before the Soviet Union developed their first atomic bomb (RDS-1) and tested it on August 29, 1949. Neither country had very many atomic weapons to spare at first, and so testing was relatively infrequent (when the U.S. used two weapons for Operation Crossroads in 1946, they were detonating over 20% of their current arsenal). However, by the 1950s the United States had established a dedicated test site on its own territory (Nevada Test Site) and was also using a site in the Marshall Islands (Pacific Proving Grounds) for extensive atomic and nuclear testing. The early tests were used primarily to discern the military effects of atomic weapons (Crossroads had involved the effect of atomic weapons on a navy, and how they functioned underwater) and to test new weapon designs. During the 1950s, these included new hydrogen bomb designs, which were tested in the Pacific, and also new and improved fission weapon designs. The Soviet Union also began testing on a limited scale, primarily in Kazakhstan. During the later phases of the Cold War, though, both countries developed accelerated testing programs, testing many hundreds of bombs over the last half of the 20th century. In 1954 the Castle Bravo fallout plume spread dangerous levels of radiation over an area over long, including inhabited islands. Atomic and nuclear tests can involve many hazards. Some of these were illustrated in the U.S. Castle Bravo test in 1954. The weapon design tested was a new form of hydrogen bomb, and the scientists underestimated how vigorously some of the weapon materials would react. As a result, the explosion‚Äîwith a yield of 15 Mt‚Äîwas over twice what was predicted. Aside from this problem, the weapon also generated a large amount of radioactive nuclear fallout, more than had been anticipated, and a change in the weather pattern caused the fallout to spread in a direction not cleared in advance. The fallout plume spread high levels of radiation for over , contaminating a number of populated islands in nearby atoll formations. Though they were soon evacuated, many of the islands' inhabitants suffered from radiation burns and later from other effects such as increased cancer rate and birth defects, as did the crew of the Japanese fishing boat Daigo Fukury≈´ Maru. One crewman died from radiation sickness after returning to port, and it was feared that the radioactive fish they had been carrying had made it into the Japanese food supply. Because of concerns about worldwide fallout levels, the Partial Test Ban Treaty was signed in 1963. Above are the per capita thyroid doses (in rads) in the continental United States resulting from all exposure routes from all atmospheric nuclear tests conducted at the Nevada Test Site from 1951 to 1962. Castle Bravo was the worst U.S. nuclear accident, but many of its component problems‚Äîunpredictably large yields, changing weather patterns, unexpected fallout contamination of populations and the food supply‚Äîoccurred during other atmospheric nuclear weapons tests by other countries as well. Concerns over worldwide fallout rates eventually led to the Partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963, which limited signatories to underground testing. Not all countries stopped atmospheric testing, but because the United States and the Soviet Union were responsible for roughly 86% of all nuclear tests, their compliance cut the overall level substantially. France continued atmospheric testing until 1974, and China until 1980. A tacit moratorium on testing was in effect from 1958 to 1961, and ended with a series of Soviet tests in late 1961, including the Tsar Bomba, the largest nuclear weapon ever tested. The United States responded in 1962 with Operation Dominic, involving dozens of tests, including the explosion of a missile launched from a submarine. Almost all new nuclear powers have announced their possession of nuclear weapons with a nuclear test. The only acknowledged nuclear power that claims never to have conducted a test was South Africa (although see Vela Incident), which has since dismantled all of its weapons. Israel is widely thought to possess a sizable nuclear arsenal, though it has never tested, unless they were involved in Vela. Experts disagree on whether states can have reliable nuclear arsenals‚Äîespecially ones using advanced warhead designs, such as hydrogen bombs and miniaturized weapons‚Äîwithout testing, though all agree that it is very unlikely to develop significant nuclear innovations without testing. One other approach is to use supercomputers to conduct \\"virtual\\" testing, but codes need to be validated against test data. There have been many attempts to limit the number and size of nuclear tests; the most far-reaching is the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty of 1996, which has not, , been ratified by eight of the \\"Annex 2 countries\\" required for it to take effect, including the United States. Nuclear testing has since become a controversial issue in the United States, with a number of politicians saying that future testing might be necessary to maintain the aging warheads from the Cold War. Because nuclear testing is seen as furthering nuclear arms development, many are opposed to future testing as an acceleration of the arms race. In total nuclear test megatonnage, from 1945 to 1992, 520 atmospheric nuclear explosions (including eight underwater) were conducted with a total yield of 545 megatons, with a peak occurring in 1961‚Äì1962, when 340 megatons were detonated in the atmosphere by the United States and Soviet Union, while the estimated number of underground nuclear tests conducted in the period from 1957 to 1992 was 1,352 explosions with a total yield of 90 Mt. Image:Trinity shot color.jpgThe first atomic test, \\"Trinity\\", took place on July 16, 1945. Image:Sedan Plowshare Crater.jpgThe Sedan test of 1962 was an experiment by the United States in using nuclear weapons to excavate large amounts of earth. Nuclear testing by country Over 2,000 nuclear tests have been conducted in over a dozen different sites around the world. Red Russia/Soviet Union, blue France, light blue United States, violet Britain, yellow China, orange India, brown Pakistan, green North Korea and light green (territories exposed to nuclear bombs). The Black dot indicates the location of the Vela Incident. \\"Baker Shot\\", part of Operation Crossroads, a nuclear test by the United States at Bikini Atoll in 1946 The nuclear powers have conducted more than 2,000 nuclear test explosions (numbers are approximate, as some test results have been disputed): * United States: 1,054 tests by official count (involving at least 1,149 devices). 219 were atmospheric tests as defined by the CTBT. These tests include 904 at the Nevada Test Site, 106 at the Pacific Proving Grounds and other locations in the Pacific, 3 in the South Atlantic Ocean, and 17 other tests taking place in Amchitka Alaska, Colorado, Mississippi, New Mexico and Nevada outside the NNSS (see Nuclear weapons and the United States for details). 24 tests are classified as British tests held at the NTS. There were 35 Plowshare detonations and 7 Vela Uniform tests; 88 tests were safety experiments and 4 were transportation/storage tests. This is usually cited as the \\"official\\" US list. Motion pictures were made of the explosions, later used to validate computer simulation predictions of explosions. United States' table data. * Soviet Union: 715 tests (involving 969 devices) by official count, plus 13 unnumbered test failures. The official Russian list of Soviet tests.An equivalent list available on the internet. Most were at their Southern Test Area at Semipalatinsk Test Site and the Northern Test Area at Novaya Zemlya. Others include rocket tests and peaceful-use explosions at various sites in Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine. Soviet Union's table data. * United Kingdom: 45 tests (21 in Australian territory, including three at the Montebello Islands, nine in mainland South Australia at Maralinga and Emu Field, some at Christmas Island (Kiritimati) in the Pacific Ocean, plus 24 in the United States at the Nevada Test Site as part of joint test series). 43 safety tests (the Vixen series) are not included in that number, though safety experiments by other countries are. The United Kingdom's summary table. * France: 210 tests by official count (50 atmospheric, 160 underground), four atomic atmospheric tests at C.E.S.M. near Reggane, 13 atomic underground tests at C.E.M.O. near In Ekker in the French Algerian Sahara, and nuclear atmospheric and underground tests at and around Fangataufa and Moruroa Atolls in French Polynesia. Four of the In Ekker tests are counted as peaceful use, as they were reported as part of the CET's APEX (Application pacifique des exp√©rimentations nucl√©aires), and given alternate names.

Their most recent nuclear test was on September 3, 2017. North Korea's summary table There may also have been at least three alleged but unacknowledged nuclear explosions (see list of alleged nuclear tests) including the Vela Incident. From the first nuclear test in 1945 until tests by Pakistan in 1998, there was never a period of more than 22 months with no nuclear testing. June 1998 to October 2006 was the longest period since 1945 with no acknowledged nuclear tests. A summary table of all the nuclear testing that has happened since 1945 is here: Worldwide nuclear testing counts and summary. lang=en Treaties against testing There are many existing anti-nuclear explosion treaties, notably the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. These treaties were proposed in response to growing international concerns about environmental damage among other risks. Nuclear testing involving humans also contributed to the formation of these treaties. Examples can be seen in the following articles: * Desert Rock exercises * Totskoye range nuclear tests The Partial Nuclear Test Ban treaty makes it illegal to detonate any nuclear explosion anywhere except underground, in order to reduce atmospheric fallout. Most countries have signed and ratified the Partial Nuclear Test Ban, which went into effect in October 1963. Of the nuclear states, France, China, and North Korea have never signed the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.U.S. Department of State, Limited Test Ban Treaty. The 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) bans all nuclear explosions everywhere, including underground. For that purpose, the Preparatory Commission of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization is building an international monitoring system with 337 facilities located all over the globe. 85% of these facilities are already operational. , the CTBT has been signed by 183 States, of which 157 have also ratified. However, for the Treaty to enter into force it needs to be ratified by 44 specific nuclear technology-holder countries. These \\"Annex 2 States\\" participated in the negotiations on the CTBT between 1994 and 1996 and possessed nuclear power or research reactors at that time. The ratification of eight Annex 2 states is still missing: China, Egypt, Iran, Israel and the United States have signed but not ratified the Treaty; India, North Korea and Pakistan have not signed it.

As public awareness and concern mounted over the possible health hazards associated with exposure to the nuclear fallout, various studies were done to assess the extent of the hazard. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/ National Cancer Institute study claims that nuclear fallout might have led to approximately 11,000 excess deaths, most caused by thyroid cancer linked to exposure to iodine-131. * United States: Prior to March 2009, the U.S. was the only nation to compensate nuclear test victims. Since the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990, more than $1.38 billion in compensation has been approved. The money is going to people who took part in the tests, notably at the Nevada Test Site, and to others exposed to the radiation. * France: In March 2009, the French Government offered to compensate victims for the first time and legislation is being drafted which would allow payments to people who suffered health problems related to the tests. The payouts would be available to victims' descendants and would include Algerians, who were exposed to nuclear testing in the Sahara in 1960. However, victims say the eligibility requirements for compensation are too narrow. * United Kingdom: There is no formal British government compensation program. However, nearly 1,000 veterans of Christmas Island nuclear tests in the 1950s are engaged in legal action against the Ministry of Defense for negligence. They say they suffered health problems and were not warned of potential dangers before the experiments. * Russia: Decades later, Russia offered compensation to veterans who were part of the 1954 Totsk test. However, there was no compensation to civilians sickened by the Totsk test. Anti-nuclear groups say there has been no government compensation for other nuclear tests. * China: China has undertaken highly secretive atomic tests in remote deserts in a Central Asian border province. Anti-nuclear activists say there is no known government program for compensating victims.

The Holla Bend National Wildlife Refuge is bounded on one side by the Arkansas River and on its other sides by an oxbow lake that was formerly the main channel of the Arkansas. The oxbow lake was formed in 1954 by the Army Corps of Engineers during their efforts to straighten the Arkansas River navigation channel. The island that was formed by this project between the old and new channels was transferred to the US Department of the Interior in 1957 for use as a wildlife refuge. The land was formerly agricultural land but was abandoned after the 1927 flood. The primary function of this refuge is to provide a winter home for ducks and geese that migrate from the north along the Mississippi Flyway each year. Up to 100,000 of these fowl live in the refuge during the winter months.

It became arguably the album's most popular song, topping the charts in Puerto Rico, Mexico and Venezuela. It is considered by many Menudo fans to have been the group's best song ever and their signature song. Rene Farrait was the lead singer for this song. Sube a mi Motora (Get on my motorcycle in English) created some controversy in Mexico, because in Mexico, motora usually is the term used for illegal drugs. Because of that, the song's name had to be changed for the Mexican audience, who knew the song as Subete a mi Moto. The Mexican version also became known across Latin America, and was used in Menudo's 1982 movie, Una Aventura Llamada Menudo, where Farrait's substitute, Charlie Masso, sang it. Later, Roy Rossello also sang the theme as lead singer. Sube a mi Motora was usually the last song performed at Menudo concerts during the era that the song was a hit. When six members of Menudo returned to the stage in 1998 during their El Reencuentro comeback tour, Sube a mi Motora was always the last song performed by the former Menudo's and Farrait ended the shows by driving a motorcycle around. In the mid-80s, the song was released in Brazilian Portuguese (Suba na minha Moto) and it was a big hit in Brazil, but the biggest hit of the group in the country was N√£o Se Reprima. An English version was released as \\"Motorcycle Dreamer\\", with Ricky Melendez as lead singer.

The prohibition on marriage between the clans issued in 659 by the Gaozong Emperor was flouted by the seven families since a woman of the Boling Cui married a member of the Taiyuan Wang, giving birth to the poet Wang Wei.

Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, 11th century. The Letter of Aristeas or Letter to Philocrates is a Hellenistic work of the 2nd century BC, assigned by Biblical scholars to the Pseudepigrapha.Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. (Palo Alto: Mayfield) 1985; Andr√© Pelletier, SJ, La Lettre d'Arist√©e √† Philocrate (Paris) 1962. Josephus,Antiquities XII:ii passim (Online in Greek and English at York University) who paraphrases about two-fifths of the letter, ascribes it to Aristeas and to have been written to a certain Philocrates, describing the Greek translation of the Hebrew Law by seventy-two interpreters sent into Egypt from Jerusalem at the request of the librarian of Alexandria, resulting in the Septuagint translation. Though some have argued that its story of the creation of the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible is fictitious,The narrative is \\"open to the gravest suspicion, and the letter abounds with improbabilities and is now generally regarded as more or less fabulous,\\" observed The Classical Review 335/6 (August‚ÄìSeptember 1919:123), reporting H. St.J. Thackeray's The Letter of Aristeas, with an Appendix of the Ancient Evidence on the Origin of the LXX.. it is the earliest text to mention the Library of Alexandria.The Cambridge Companion to the City in Literature, edited by Kevin R. McNamara, p.36  History  Ptolemy II on the right. Bavarian State Library, circa 1480. The Letter of Aristeas, called so because it was a letter addressed from Aristeas to his brother Philocrates, deals primarily with the reason the Greek translation of the Hebrew Law, also called the Septuagint, was created, as well as the people and processes involved. The letter's author alleges to be a courtier of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (reigned 281-246 BC). Over twenty Greek manuscript copies of the letter are known to survive, dating from the 11th to the 15th century. The letter is also mentioned and quoted in other ancient texts, most notably in Antiquities of the Jews by Josephus (c. 93 AD), in Life of Moses by Philo of Alexandria (c. AD 15), and in an excerpt from Aristobulus of Paneas (c. 160 BC) preserved in Praeparatio evangelica by Eusebius. In detail, the work relates how the king of Egypt, presumably Ptolemy II Philadelphus, is urged by his chief librarian Demetrios of Phaleron to have the Hebrew Law translated into Greek, and so add the knowledge of the Hebrews to the vast collection of books the empire had already collected. The king responds favorably, including giving freedom to Jews who had been taken into captivity by his predecessors, and sending lavish gifts (which are described in great detail) to the Temple in Jerusalem along with his envoys. The high priest chooses exactly six men from each of the twelve tribes, giving 72 in all; he gives a long sermon in praise of the Law. When the translators arrive in Alexandria the king weeps for joy and for the next seven days puts philosophical questions to the translators, the wise answers to which are related in full. The 72 translators then complete their task in exactly 72 days. The Jews of Alexandria, on hearing the Law read in Greek, request copies and lay a curse on anyone who would change the translation. The king then rewards the translators lavishly and they return home. A main goal of the 2nd-century author seems to be to establish the superiority of the Greek Septuagint text over any other version of the Hebrew Bible. The author is noticeably pro-Greek, portraying Zeus as simply another name for the God of Israel, and while criticism is lodged against idolatry and Greek sexual ethics, the argument is phrased in such a way as to attempt to persuade the reader to change, rather than as a hostile attack. The manner in which the author concentrates on describing Judaism, and particularly its temple in Jerusalem could be viewed as an attempt to proselytise. Criticism Greek-Latin bilingual Oxford edition of 1692. Demetrios of Phaleron, a client of Ptolemy I Soter, is not a good candidate as a collaborator with Ptolemy II Philadelphus. Roger S. Bagnall notes that he made the strategic mistake at the beginning of the reign of supporting Ptolemy's older half-brother, and was punished with internal exile, dying soon afterwards.Roger S. Bagnall, \\"Alexandria: Library of Dreams\\". (PDF) Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 146.4 (December 2002:348-362) p. 348 The Spanish humanist Luis Vives is sometimes quoted as having been the first to have exposed the fictitious character of the Letter, in his In XXII libros de civitate Dei commentaria (Basel: Frobenius, 1522), on Aug. Book XVIII, 42.E.g., in Natalio Fern√°ndez Marcos, The Septuagint in Context: Introduction to the Greek Versions of the Bible (tr. W.G.E. Watson; Leiden: Brill, 2000), But a lecture of the Latin text reveals that Vives only transmitted Jerome's criticisms of the Aristeas story, and added nothing critical of his own account. The inconsistencies and anachronisms of the author, exposed by many 17th-century scholars were collected and presented with great erudition and wit by Humphrey Hody (1659‚Äì1706),Hody, Contra historiam Aristeae de LXX (Oxford) 1705, a reprint of his dissertation, Oxford, 1685. Hody placed the writing closer to 170‚Äì130 BC. His Oxford dissertation of 1685 provoked an \\"angry and scurrilous reply\\" from Isaac Vossius (1618‚Äì1689), who had been librarian to Queen Christina of Sweden, in the appendix to his Observations on Pomponius Mela, 1686, to which Hody conclusively replied in notes to his reprint of 1705.Sidney Jellicoe, The Septuagint and Modern Study, 1993:31. Due to this, the author of the letter of Aristeas is most often referred to as pseudo-Aristeas.Prosographia Ptolemaica Modern scholarship is unanimously with Hody. Victor Tcherikover (Hebrew University) summed up the scholarly consensus in 1958: > \\"Modern scholars commonly regard the ‚ÄúLetter of Aristeas‚Äù as a work typical > of Jewish apologetics, aiming at self-defense and propaganda, and directed > to the Greeks. Here are some instances illustrating this general view. In > 1903 Friedlander wrote that the glorification of Judaism in the letter was > no more than self-defense, though ‚Äúthe book does not mention the antagonists > of Judaism by name, nor does it admit that its intention is to refute direct > attacks.‚Äù Stein sees in the letter ‚Äúa special kind of defense, which > practices diplomatic tactics,‚Äù and Tramontano also speaks of ‚Äúan apologetic > and propagandist tendency.‚Äù Vincent characterizes it as ‚Äúa small > unapologetic novel written for the Egyptians‚Äù (i.e. the Greeks in Egypt). > Pheiffer says: ‚ÄúThis fanciful story of the origin of the Septuagint is > merely a pretext for defending Judaism against its heathen denigrators, for > extolling its nobility and reasonableness, and first striving to convert > Greek speaking Gentiles to it.‚Äù Sch√ºrer classes the letter with a special > kind of literature, ‚ÄúJewish propaganda in Pagan disguise,‚Äù whose works are > ‚Äúdirected to the pagan reader, in order to make propaganda for Judaism among > the Gentiles.‚Äù Andrews, too, believes that the role of a Greek was assumed > by Aristeas in order ‚Äúto strengthen the force of the argument and commend it > to non-Jewish readers. Even Gutman, who rightly recognizes that the Letter > sprang 'from an inner need of the educated Jew,' sees in it 'a strong means > for making Jewish propaganda in the Greek world.' ‚ÄùV. Tcherikover, \\"The > Ideology of the Letter of Aristeas\\" Harvard Theological Review 51.2 (April > 1958), pp. 59-85 (JSTOR ref.) But Tcherikover continues, > \\"In this article an attempt will be made to prove that the Letter of > Aristeas was not written with the aim of self-defense or propaganda, and was > addressed not to Greek, but to Jewish readers.\\" In 2001, Bruce Metzger writes: > Most scholars who have analyzed the letter have concluded that the author > cannot have been the man he represented himself to be but was a Jew who > wrote a fictitious account in order to enhance the importance of the Hebrew > Scriptures by suggesting that a pagan king had recognized their significance > and therefore arranged for their translation into Greek.Metzger, B., The > Bible in Translation (Baker Academic, 2001), p. 15. Scholars avid for the scant information about the Library and the Musaeum of Alexandria have depended on pseudo-Aristeas, who \\"has that least attractive quality in a source: to be trusted only where corroborated by better evidence, and there unneeded,\\" Roger Bagnall concluded.Bagnall 2002:352.

He was elected to the first House of Assembly in 1832 as a Liberal. Kent was a champion of Catholic rights on an island that was then deeply divided along religious lines, which his actions directly exacerbated. He was described in the Dictionary of Canadian Biography (DCB) as a demagogue who \\"enjoyed the storm and rode it to his own advantage\\", a style of politicking later followed in similar fashion by, among others, Edward Murphy Jr. (of Troy, New York) and Richard J. Daley (of Chicago). The DCB states, \\"Kent's electioneering was a compound of his own strident vitality, intimidation, and clerical influence. Newfoundland in 1832 had virtually universal suffrage under a household franchise, and it was not difficult to secure election by turbulent, and very effective means. Kent was of the school of Reformers who relished quarrels with authority.\\" He worked for the reform movement along with his uncle, Philip Morris, and William Carson, which successfully persuaded the British Colonial Office to institute responsible government in Newfoundland. Kent became Colonial Secretary under Philip Francis Little. From 1848-55 he was Speaker of the Newfoundland House of Assembly. He became Premier after Little resigned in 1858. He won the election of 1859 but his government was engulfed by crisis in 1861 when it tried to lower the salary of government officials, including judges who sued the government. In the legislature, Kent accused Governor Sir Alexander Bannerman and the opposition Conservatives of conspiring with the judges against the government. Bannerman, who despised Kent's \\"dictatorial methods and disliked his administration\\", responded by dismissing Kent's government in March 1861, which Kent described as a \\"gross act of treachery\\". The Liberals defeated the Conservative government in a Motion of No Confidence. The Conservatives narrowly defeated Kent's Liberals in a sometimes violent election campaign fought along sectarian lines with Catholics largely voting Liberal and Protestants largely voting Conservative. Riots erupted in the heavily Catholic Harbour Grace area when Bannerman cancelled voting there. Later that same year, 1861, Hugh Hoyles was appointed by Bannerman as Conservative Premier of the new government. Death Kent died at St John's on September 1, 1872. His wife, a sister of Michael Anthony Fleming, Bishop of Newfoundland, and at least two of their children, survived him.

The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek melas \\"black\\" and netta \\"duck\\". The species name commemorates French ornithologist C√¥me Damien Degland. Description The white-winged scoter is one of three North American scoter species and the largest species of scoter. It is characterised by its bulky shape and large bill. Females range from and , averaging and . She is brown with pale head patches. The male ranges from and from , averaging and . The white-winged scoter has a wingspan of 31.5 in (80 cm). He is all black, except for white around the eye and a white speculum. This scoter's bill has a black base and a large knob. White patches are visible but not conspicuous when wings are folded There are a number of differing characteristics of the Stejneger's scoter and the white-winged scoter. Males of the white-winged scoter have browner flanks, dark yellow coloration of most of the bill and a less tall bill knob, approaching the velvet scoter. Stejneger's scoter has a very tall knob at the base of its mostly orange-yellow bill. Females are identical in the field. The Latin binomial commemorates the French zoologist Dr. C√¥me- Damien Degland (1787‚Äì1856). Taxonomy It was formerly considered to be conspecific with the velvet scoter, and some taxonomists still regard it as so. These two species, the Stejneger's scoter, and the surf scoter, are placed in the subgenus Melanitta, distinct from the subgenus Oidemia, black and common scoters. Stejneger's scoter was suggested to be a full species, according to a new study. Distribution The white-winged scoter breeds over the far north of North America. It winters further south in temperate zones, on the Great Lakes, the coasts of the northern United States and the southern coasts of Canada.. It forms large flocks on suitable coastal waters. These are tightly packed, and the birds tend to take off together. It has occurred as a vagrant in Europe, including Scotland, Iceland, Norway and Ireland, Behavior =Breeding= The lined nest is built on the ground close to the sea, lakes or rivers, in woodland or tundra. 5‚Äì11 eggs are laid. The pinkish eggs average in breadth, in length and in weight. The incubation period can range from 25 to 30 days. After about 21 days, neighboring females may start to behave aggressively towards other nesting females, resulting in confusion and mixing of broods. By the time she is done brooding, a female may be tending to as much as 40 offspring due to the mixing from these conflicts. The female will tend to her brood for up to 3 weeks and then abandon them, but the young will usually stay together from another 3 weeks. Flight capacity is thought to be gained at 63 to 77 days of age. =Food= In freshwater, this species primarily feeds on crustaceans and insects; while in saltwater areas, it feeds on molluscs and crustaceans. The favorite foods are an amphipod (Hyalella azteca) in freshwater, and rock clams (Protothaca staminea), Atlantic razor clams (Siliqua spp.), and Arctic wedge clams (Mesodesma arctatus).

For men, it consists of a black dress coat with tails worn over a white shirt, white piqu√© waistcoat and the eponymous white bow tie worn around a standing wingtip collar. High-waisted black trousers, along with black patent leather oxford or optionally court shoes, complete the outfit. Orders, decorations and medals may be worn. Acceptable accessories include a black top hat, white gloves, a white scarf, a pocket watch and a boutonni√®re. Women wear full-length ball or evening gowns and, optionally, jewellery, tiaras, a small handbag and evening gloves. Some white-tie functions also request that the women wear long gloves past the elbow. The dress code's origins can be traced back to the end of the 18th century. New fully black-coloured justaucorps styles emerged around the Age of Revolution, notably adopted by the bourgeois third estate of the Estates General of the Kingdom of France. Increasingly following the French Revolution, high society men abandoned the richly decorated justaucorps coats for more austere cutaway dress coats in dark colours, with cuts perhaps further inspired by the frocks and riding coats of country gentlemen. Gradually replacing also breeches, lacy dress shirts and jabots with plain white dress shirts, shorter waistcoats, white cravats and pantaloons, this became known as directoire style. By the early 19th-century Regency era, dark dress tailcoats with light trousers became standard daywear, while black and white became the standard colours for evening wear. Although the directoire style was replaced for daytime by black frock coats and bowties by mid-19th century, cutaway black dress tailcoats with white bowtie has remained established for formal evening wear ever since. Despite the emergence of the shorter dinner jacket (or tuxedo) in the 1880s as a less formal but more comfortable alternative, full evening dress tailcoats remained the staple. Towards the end of the Victorian era, white bow ties and waistcoats became the standard for full evening dress, known as white tie, contrasting with black bow ties and waistcoats for the dinner jacket, an ensemble which became known as semi-formal black tie. Following the counterculture of the 1960s, white tie was increasingly replaced by black tie as default evening wear for more formal events. Since the late 20th century, white tie tends to be reserved for the most formal evening occasions, such as state dinners and audiences, in addition to formal balls and galas such as the Vienna Opera Ball in Austria, the Nobel Prize banquet in Stockholm, Mardi Gras balls in New Orleans, and the Al Smith Memorial Dinner in New York. White tie still also occurs at traditional weddings and church celebrations, at certain societies and fraternities, as well as occasionally around some traditional European universities and colleges. History Fashion plate from Costume Parisien (1823) J√∂ns Jacob Berzelius (1843) Giuseppe Verdi meets King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy (1859). Vanity Fair (1885) = 19th century: origins and development = Vanity Fair from 1899, showing a British peer wearing white tie Throughout the Early Modern period, western European male courtiers and aristocrats donned elaborate clothing at ceremonies and dinners: coats (often richly decorated), frilly and lacy shirts and breeches formed the backbone of their most formal attire. As the 18th century drew to a close, high society began adopting more austere clothing which drew inspiration from the dark hues and simpler designs adopted by country gentlemen. By the end of the 18th century, two forms of tail coat were in common use by upper-class men in Britain and continental Europe: the more formal dress coat (cut away horizontally at the front) and the less formal morning coat, which curved back from the front to the tails. From around 1815, a knee-length garment called the frock coat became increasingly popular and was eventually established, along with the morning coat, as smart daywear in Victorian England. The dress coat, meanwhile, became reserved for wear in the evening.Jenkins 2003, p. 886 The dandy Beau Brummell adopted a minimalistic approach to evening wear‚Äîa white waistcoat, dark blue tailcoat, black pantaloons and striped stockings.Carter 2011 Although Brummell felt black an ugly colour for evening dress coats, it was adopted by other dandies, like Charles Baudelaire, and black and white had become the standard colours by the 1840s.Williams 1982, p. 122Jenkins 2003, p. 887 Over the course of the 19th century, the monotone colour scheme became a codified standard for evening events after 6 p.m. in upper class circles. The styles evolved and evening dress consisted of a black dress coat and trousers, white or black waistcoat, and a bow tie by the 1870s. The dinner jacket (black tie/tuxedo) emerged as a less formal and more comfortable alternative to full evening dress in the 1880s. The German actor Rudolf Platte wearing white tie on stage in 1937 By the early 20th century, full evening dress meant wearing a white waistcoat and tie with a black tailcoat and trousers; white tie had become distinct from black tie.Jenkins 2003, pp. 888, 890 Despite its growing popularity, the dinner jacket remained the reserve of family dinners and gentlemen's clubs during the late Victorian period. =20th century= Guests at the white-tie Royal Ball in Brisbane, 1954 By the turn of the 20th century, full evening dress consisted of a black tailcoat made of heavy fabric weighing 16-18 oz per yard. Its lapels were medium width and the white shirt worn beneath it had a heavily starched, stiff front, fastened with pearl or black studs and either a winged collar or a type called a \\"poke\\", consisting of a high band with a slight curve at the front.Schoeffler 1973, p. 166 After World War I, the dinner jacket became more popular, especially in the US, and informal variations sprang up, like the soft, turn-down collar shirt and later the double-breasted jacket;Schoeffler 1973, p. 168 relaxing social norms in Jazz Age America meant white tie was replaced by black tie as the default evening wear for young men, especially at nightclubs. According to The Delineator, the years after World War I saw white tie \\"almost abandoned\\".The Delineator, vol. 128 (January 1936), p. 57 But it did still have a place: the American etiquette writer Emily Post stated in 1922 that \\"A gentleman must always be in full dress, tail coat, white waistcoat, white tie and white gloves\\" when at the opera, yet she called the tuxedo \\"essential\\" for any gentleman, writing that \\"It is worn every evening and nearly everywhere, whereas the tail coat is necessary only at balls, formal dinners, and in a box at the opera.\\"Emily Post (1922). Etiquette in Society, in Business, in Politics and at Home . New York and London: Funk and Wagnalls co. chap. vi, xxxiv It also continued to evolve. White tie was worn with slim-cut trousers in the early 1920s; by 1926, wide-lapelled tailcoats and double-breasted waistcoats were in vogue.Schoeffler 1973, pp. 169-170 The Duke of Windsor (then Prince of Wales and later Edward VIII) wore a midnight blue tailcoat, trousers and waistcoat in the 1920s and 1930s both to \\"soften\\" the contrast between black and white and allow for photographs to depict the nuances of his tailoring. The late 1920s and 1930s witnessed a resurgence in the dress code's popularity,Schoeffler 1973, p. 170 but by 1953, one etiquette writer stressed that \\"The modern trend is to wear 'tails' only for the most formal and ceremonious functions, such as important formal dinners, balls, elaborate evening weddings, and opening night at the opera\\".Lillian Eichler Watson (1953). New Standard Book of Etiquette. New York: Garden Publishing Company. p. 358 It was the dress code for the Lord Mayor of London's Mansion House dinner until 1996. The last president to have worn white tie at a United States presidential inauguration was President John F. Kennedy in 1961, who wore morning dress for his inauguration, and a white tie ensemble for his inauguration ball. = 21st century = While rare in the early 21st century, it survives as the formal dress code for royal and public ceremonies and audiences, weddings, balls, and a select group of other social events in some countries. Notable international recurrent white tie events include the Nobel Prize ceremony in Sweden and the Vienna Opera Ball in Austria. In Scandinavia and the Netherlands, white tie is the traditional attire for doctoral conferments and is prescribed at some Swedish and Finnish universities, where it is worn with a top hat variant called a doctoral hat. In Sweden and Finland, a black waistcoat is worn with white tie for academic occasions in the daytime.http://promootio.aalto.fi/fi/history/2014/pukeutuminen/ Some fraternities such as Freemasons and Odd Fellows wear dress coats to their meetings.Approved Masonic Dress, Aprons, Gauntlets, Collars and Jewels of Rank A Publication of the United Grand Lodge of NSW and the ACT, May 2012  United Kingdom  In Britain, it is worn at certain formal occasions such as state banquets and certain balls at Oxford, Cambridge, Durham, and St Andrews universities. White tie is also seen as part of a few public schools' uniform, such as Harrow School, where the Head Boy is allowed to wear white tie to special events.  United States  President John F. Kennedy, wearing white tie, and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, wearing a gown designed by Ethel Franken of Bergdorf Goodman, arrive at the D.C. Armory in Washington D.C. for an inaugural ball held on the evening of Inauguration Day, January 20, 1961. A few state dinners at the White House apply white tie, such as the one held for Queen Elizabeth II in 2007. Other notable examples include the Gridiron Club Dinner in Washington, D.C., the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York City, in additions to a few debutante balls such as the International Debutante Ball in New York City, and the Veiled Prophet Ball in St. Louis. In the southern United States, white tie is sometimes referred to as \\"costume de rigueur\\", adapted from French language due to the historical background of New France. It is sometimes used in invitations to masquerade balls and Mardi Gras celebrations, such as the Mardi Gras in Mobile in Alabama, \\"Mardi Gras Terminology\\", Mobile Bay Convention and Visitors Bureau, 2009, webpage: MG- terms . \\"Le Krewe de Bienville\\", KrewedeBienville.com, 2011, web: KbD . or New Orleans Mardi Gras in Louisiana, emphasising the white tie expectations for men and full-length evening gowns for ladies. When the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala in New York City announced a white tie dress code in 2014, a number of media outlets pointed out the difficulty and expense of obtaining traditional white tie, even for the celebrity guests.  Composition  Swedish diplomat Sven Hirdman in diplomatic uniform with ambassador Jaak J√µer√º√ºt of Estonia in white tie and top hat (2011) According to the British etiquette guide Debrett's, the central components of full evening dress for men are a white marcella shirt with a detachable wing collar and single cuffs, fastened with studs and cufflinks; the eponymous white marcella bow tie is worn around the collar, while a low-cut marcella waistcoat is worn over the shirt. Over this is worn a black single-breasted barathea wool or ultrafine herringbone tailcoat with silk peak lapels. The trousers have double-braiding down the outside of both legs, while the correct shoes are patent leather or highly polished black dress shoes. Although a white scarf remains popular in winter, the traditional white gloves, top hats, canes and cloaks are now rare. Women wear a full-length evening dress, with the option of jewellery, a tiara, a pashmina, coat or wrap. Long gloves are not compulsory. The waistcoat should not be visible below the front of the tailcoat, which necessitates a high waistline and (often) braces for the trousers. As one style writer for GQ magazine summarises \\"The simple rule of thumb is that you should only ever see black and white not black, white and black again\\". While Debrett's accepts double cuffs for shirts worn with white tie, some tailors and merchant suggest that single, linked cuffs are the most traditional and formal variation acceptable under the dress code.\\"White tie dress code\\" . Savvy Row. Retrieved 26 February 2015. Decorations may also be worn and, unlike Debrett's, Cambridge University's Varsity student newspaper suggests a top hat, opera cloak and silver-topped cane are acceptable accessories.

The twelve chapters of the story were each written by a different author, in the following sequence: Canon Victor Whitechurch, G. D. H. Cole and Margaret Cole, Henry Wade, Agatha Christie, John Rhode, Milward Kennedy, Dorothy L. Sayers, Ronald Knox, Freeman Wills Crofts, Edgar Jepson, Clemence Dane and Anthony Berkeley. G. K. Chesterton contributed a Prologue, which was written after the novel had been completed.Charles Osborne, The Life and Crimes of Agatha Christie, London, 1982. In a literary game of consequences, each author would write one chapter, leaving G.K. Chesterton to write a typically paradoxical prologue and Anthony Berkeley to tie up all the loose ends. In addition, each of the authors provided their own solution in a sealed envelope, all of which appeared at the end of the book. As Sayers explained in the introduction to the book, \\"Each writer must construct his instalment with a definite solution in view--that is, he must not introduce new complications merely 'to make it more difficult' ...

Last night, he had dinner with his niece in the house of the vicar. Afterwards he used his own boat to navigate over the river to his home. However, the boat on which the admiral is found is not his property, but is owned by the vicar. The admiral was stabbed by a knife or a dagger, but there is no blood on the floor. Furthermore, the mooring line has been cut. List of Characters Neddy Ware: A local of the village who owns a boat. He discovered the body of the Admiral, of whose crew Ware once was a part of. He is known to generally be peace-loving but can have a temper and a sailor's vocabulary when roused. Constable Hempstead: A local police officer who was on night duty around the time of the death and spotted a mysterious figure in a car. Inspector Rudge: The inspector working on the case of Admiral Penistone's murder. Reverend (Mr) Mount: The vicar of the village, on whose boat the body of Admiral Penistone is found. His hat is found near the body. He has two sons and a runaway wife who left him for another man. Alec Mount: One of Reverend Mount's two sons, a sixteen-year-old. Peter Mount: One of Reverend Mount's two sons, a fourteen-year-old. Sir Wilfrid Denny: A friend of Admiral Penistone and a retired civil servant who is fond of his garden. He had ties with the Admiral in China and, strangely, rushed off to London on the morning of the discovery of the Admiral's body. Elma Holland (n√©e Fitzgerald): A young woman, about thirty or a few years above that age. She wasn't beautiful, as judged by Rudge, but if she made herself up she could have been pretty. She is the niece of the Admiral and engaged to Arthur Holland. She has been in the area for a month and is of independent means. Arthur Holland: A young, handsome man with a slightly sunburnt face who is engaged to Elma. He is a tradesman who works with materials such as rubber, silk and jute, trading the items for China. He stayed at the Lord Marshall hotel in nearby Whynnmouth at the time of the murder. He secretly marries Elma. Mrs Davis: The local gossip and the proprietress of the Lord Marshall at Whynnmouth, who provides Rudge with invaluable details (mostly scandalous in nature). Mr Daker: A solicitor and a friend of Mr Fitzgerald (Mr Fitzgerald is the father of Elma and Admiral Penistone's brother-in-law). A dryly cautious man with a strong family feeling. Walter Fitzgerald: Elma's brother, an attractive young man who forged a document while working in China. He has been missing for a period of time and if he comes forward he will be arrested for the forgery - if he doesn't he will lose his father's inheritance.

Adult males are almost entirely black with characteristic white patches on the forehead and the nape and adult females are slightly smaller and browner. Surf scoters breed in Northern Canada and Alaska and winter along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America. Those diving ducks mainly feed on benthic invertebrates, mussels representing an important part of their diet.  Taxonomy  Like many other bird species, the surf scoter was first described by Carl Linnaeus in the 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. He gave it the binomial name Anas perspicillata. Anas is the Latin name for ducks. The specific name is from the Latin perspicillatus, \\"spectacled\\", in turn derived from perspicere, \\"to see through\\". The surf scoter was then moved in the Melanitta genus. The name of this genus is derived from Ancient Greek melas \\"black\\" and netta \\"duck\\". and it contains 5 extant scoter species. A cladistic analysis based on several morphological characters placed the surf scoter as a monotypic taxon, closest to the white-winged scoter (Melanitta deglandi) and the velvet scoter (Melanitta fusca), which are both sister taxa. These three species form the subgenus Melanitta, distinct from the subgenus Oidemia, which contains the black scoter (Melanitta americana) and the common scoter (Melanitta nigra). The only extinct Melanitta species, M. cerutti, used to be present in California during the late Pliocene, but it has been moved in the genus Histrionicus (Harlequin duck). The genus Melanitta is part of the Mergini tribe, a monophyletic group of the Northern Hemisphere. It includes eiders, mergansers, goldeneyes and other sea ducks. This tribe is part of the family Anatidae, along with the swans and geese.  Description  The adult male is on average 1,050 g (2.31 lb) and 48 cm (19 in) in length while the adult female averages about 900 g (2.0 lb) and 44 cm (17 in) in length, making this the smallest species of scoter on average. The surf scoter has a wingspan of 29.9-30.3 in (76-77 cm). The male is completely velvety black except for white patches on the forehead and the nape. It has a swollen bill, appearing orange at a distance but patterned with white, red and yellow, and a black spot near the base. The female is browner than the male, with a fairly uniform plumage, slightly darker above than below. Indistinct paler patches are present on the cheeks below the eye and sometimes a whitish patch is on the nape, a unique trait among scoters. The bill is black with green or blue colorations The juvenile has a plumage similar to the female, but mainly paler and browner, and the breast and belly are whitish The surf scoter is easily distinguishable from other scoters by the white patch on the head of the adult male and its unique bill pattern. Females and immatures have a bulkier bill and a more flattened head profile than other scoters, recalling the shape of the common eider (Somateria mollissima). The black and the white-winged scoters are physically very similar to the surf scoter but in flight, the surf scoter is the only one with completely dark wings. Like all sea ducks, the surf scoter becomes flightless during the simultaneous molt of its flight feathers. This vulnerable period happens usually in late July through early August and lasts for about four weeks. Before molting the flight feathers, all waterfowl undergo a complete body molt, replacing the bright colors of the basic plumage of males by the duller alternate or eclipse plumage. The plumage is a good indicator of the age for male surf scoters, but not for females.  Distribution  Compared to most Northern American sea ducks, the surf scoter breeds exclusively in North America, mostly in Northern Canada and Alaska. Then, they take different migration routes to spend the winter in more temperate environments. While small numbers regularly winter in western Europe as far south as the British Isles, the vast majority of surf scoters winter along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America. The Pacific coast host the highest number of individuals and its large wintering range extends over 5000 km, from the Aleutian Islands in Alaska to the Baja Peninsula in Mexico.  Habitat  This migratory species breeds in the boreal forests near northern freshwater lakes. Very few nests have been observed but they tend to be near spruce cover, slightly upland to wetland areas. To complete its molt before migration, the surf scoter travels to a molting site, which differ from the wintering or the nesting site. Because of the vulnerable state of the ducks in those periods, molting sites are assumed to have profitable food and lower predation risks and they are located in bays, inlets or estuaries. The surf scoter winters in marine habitats near the shore.  Behavior  = Reproduction = Surf scoters form pairs on wintering and staging grounds. Most pairs are formed before the arrival on the breeding grounds. Studies showed a strong fidelity in the nesting areas of surf scoters over the years. The building of the nest usually starts in mid-May to early June and it occurs on the ground close to the sea, lakes or rivers, in woodland or tundra. Females dig a bowl-shaped nest in the ground and lines it with nearby ground debris and down. About 5 to 9 eggs are laid and each may range from 55‚Äì79 g (1.9‚Äì2.8 oz) and average 43.9 mm (1.73 in) in breadth and 62.4 mm (2.46 in) in length. The incubation lasts for about 28 to 30 days and is provided by the female only. Occasional (and likely accidental) brood mixing between different females occurs in areas with high densities of nests and hatching is synchronous among the eggs. The female usually chooses a feeding area less than 2 meters deep and protected from strong winds for its offspring. When they reach those food-rich wetland, they begin feeding on their own. The mother abandons its young before they reach the flight age, at about 55 days. The fledged offspring congregate in small groups on the breeding area before migrating to the wintering grounds, independently of the adults. Studies in Quebec have demonstrated a duckling mortality of 55-65%, probably influenced by the weather conditions shortly after hatching. = Diet and foraging = The surf scoter mainly feeds on benthic invertebrates. During the breeding period, surf scoters forage in pairs or small groups on a diverse range of freshwater invertebrates. However, the sea ducks feed on marine organisms for the rest of the year, in flocks ranging from a few individuals to several thousands birds. Important foods include crustaceans, herring spawn, gastropods and small bivalves such as mussels. In late winter and spring, Surf scoters tend to shift their diet according to the relative profitability of the food, showing a level of opportunism. For example, they start feeding in seagrass beds, on epifaunal crustaceans that have increased in size over winter or on Pacific herring eggs (Clupea pallasi), during the fish spawning. As the prey landscape changes, surf scoters will adjust their foraging effort and habitat selection. Effort is lowest in December, due to high prey abundance, and it increases until mid-February, when prey declines. It increases again in March, probably due to the increasing daylight time for foraging. As the season progresses, surf scoters move to habitats with lower prey declines, instead of staying in habitats poor in prey and increasing their foraging effort. Surf scoter usually captures its food underwater and consumes it whole. They have been observed to select smaller bivalves than those available, probably because of the energy cost of processing shell matter. They also seem to select slow-swimming epifaunal crustaceans. Surf scoters consume smaller prey that are located in complex habitat such as mussel beds, which makes them use more visual cues than their congeneric white-winged scoters. They may also visually locate siphons formed by infaunal bivalves to capture them. Gut analysis demonstrated a strong ability to avoid ingesting vegetation while feeding on attached herring eggs. Flocks of surf scoter appear to dive in a highly synchronous fashion and this synchrony is correlated with the group size. Dive duration vary with many factors such as prey type, density and profitability, season and water depth. Surf scoters increase their dive duration when they are feeding on herring spawning, which are harder to capture than sessile bivalves. With crab Adult scoters of this species dive for crustaceans and molluscs, while the ducklings live off any variety of freshwater invertebrates. = Migration = Many migration routes have been observed, and the route choice of the surf scoter will depend on the latitude of its nesting site. The departure date of the birds may vary according to their wintering site, but the date of arrival and settling on the nesting site appear to be synchronous. This suggest that because of different factors such as the weather or varied foraging conditions, the individuals adjust their migration timing to meet an optimized reproductive schedule. The ducks face very different environmental conditions depending on the location of their wintering grounds, which affect their migratory behavior. Higher proportions of males have been located in the northern part while more females and juveniles winter in the southernmost portion of the range. In spring, males and females migrate together to their breeding area and they usually settle at their nesting sites less than a week after arrival. = Vocalization = Surf scoters are generally silent and their few vocalizations are poorly known. During courtship display, males perform a gurgling call and an explosive puk-puk. Females defend their young with a crowlike call. When alarmed, surf scoters will often make a sound like a \\"guk,\\" somewhere between a \\"cluck\\" and a \\"tok,\\" while rapidly surveying their environment or taking to flight en masse.  Mortality  In a necrotic study on sea ducks, parasitic diseases were an important cause of mortality. The only parasite found in dead surf scoters was the Acanthocephalan Polymorphus spp., which causes peritonitis, an inflammation of the abdomen's lining, and possibly emaciation. Out of 39 studied individuals, seven were fatally affected by this worm. A mortality of about 100 surf scoters was also estimated along the coast of California in the spring of 1995. The other mortality causes included emaciation due to starvation (17 individuals), toxicity from petroleum (3 individuals), and trauma from firearm or collisions in different structures (2 individuals). Predation of eggs and ducklings have not been studied in detail but bald eagles, golden eagles and mustelids have been identified as the main predators of surf scoters in marine habitats. Marked individuals showed a higher mortality rate in winter than during wing molt. In November, 2007, an oil spill in San Francisco harbour oiled and killed thousands of birds including many surf scoters. About 40% of the birds affected were from this species. Scientists said that while the species is not endangered it has declined 50 to 70% over the past 40 years and this spill could decrease populations since most of the affected birds are healthy adults.San Fran oil spill hurts Canadian sea duck population. CBC News. November 23, 2007.  Status  The extremely large range and population size of the surf scoter assures it a status of Least Concerned, according to the IUCN. The populations have been apparently decreasing over the last years, but this small decline is not rapid enough to consider moving the species in the Vulnerable category. The global population is estimated to be between 250,000 and 1,300,000 individuals.

A much more detailed discussion of Dene names is warranted for future work.]) in the Northwest Territories: **Acho Dene Koe First Nation - Fort Liard (Ahcho Koe or Ahcho Kue) **Deh Gah Gotie Dene Council - Fort Providence (Zhahti Koe or Zhahti Kue) **Jean Marie River First Nation (Tthe‚ÄôK‚Äôehdeli Dene) - Jean Marie River (Tthek'√©hd√©lƒØ or Tthek'edeli) **Katl'odeeche First Nation (K√°t≈Ç ºodehche DeneSouth Slavey Topical Dictionary K√°t≈Ç ºodehche Dialect) - Hay River (X√°t≈Ç'odehchee) with Hay River Reserve **Ka‚Äôagee Tu First Nation (Ka‚Äôagee Tu Dene)- Kakisa (K'√°gee) **Liidli Kue First Nation (Liidli Kue Dene) - Fort Simpson (Liidli Kue) **Nahanni Butte Dene Band (N‚Äôah adehe Dene) - Nahanni Butte (Tthen√°√°g√≥) **Pehdzeh Ki First Nation (Pehdzeh Ki Dene) - Wrigley (Pehdzeh Ki) **Sambaa K'e (Trout Lake) Dene (Sambaa K‚Äôe Dene) - Trout Lake (Sambaa K'e) **West Point First Nation - West Point (Ts‚Äôueh Nda ‚Äì Spruce Point) The Sahtu, Sahtu Dene (‚Ä≥Great Bear Lake People‚Ä≥) or North Slavey people live exclusively in the Northwest Territories.

Over the years it has been published by Pacific Comics, Eclipse Comics (one special issue), Marvel Comics (under its Epic imprint), Image Comics and Dark Horse Comics. Groo was one of the first widely successful creator-owned comics, one of the few successful humorous comic books in the United States (outside Archie Comics) during its time, and one of the longest-running collaborations in comic book history. In 2011 IGN ranked Groo 100th in the \\"Top 100 comic books heroes\\". The characters Groo (the epithet \\"the Wanderer\\" is informal and rarely mentioned within the stories) first appeared as a parody of the brutal sword and sorcery heroes who were popular at the time of his creation in the 1970s, especially Conan the Barbarian as presented in Marvel Comics. Groo is a large-nosed buffoon of unsurpassed stupidity who constantly misunderstands his surroundings. Possessed of superlative skills in swordsmanship (the only task at which he is remotely competent) he delights in combat but otherwise is a peaceable and honest fellow who tries to make his way through life as a mercenary or by working odd jobs. He is incredibly accident-prone, and despite generally good intentions causes mass destruction wherever he goes. Most of his adventures end with him either oblivious to the mayhem he has wrought or fleeing an angry mob. His penchant for destruction has become so widely known that just the news of Groo approaching is sometimes enough to cause chaos among the population. Groo occasionally meets with respect and good fortune, but it does not last. Businesses, towns, civilizations, and cultures have all been unwittingly destroyed by Groo. Such is Groo's incompetence that so much as his stepping onto a ship can cause it to sink. Groo has slain entire armies with nothing more than his swords, which appear to be a pair of katanas. Groo loves these frays, as he calls them, and often charges into the melee with a cry of \\"Now Groo does what Groo does best!\\" He is indiscriminate in the use of his battle skills, usually leaping into the bloodshed before attempting to ascertain the reasons for the fight, or even who is on what side. Even when Groo does join battle intending to fight for a particular side, he is prone to forget which side he is on or be tricked into fighting his unfortunate allies, often causing him to utter \\"Did I err?\\" in confusion once everybody is dead. The following is a sample of the thousands of characters Groo has encountered: *Captain Ahax, who has, over time with the loss of many vessels under his command, become wise to Groo's effect on ships, although he does not know about Rufferto's ability to restrain it. *Arba and Dakarba, a pair of witches who have suffered much trying to take advantage of Groo. They have repeatedly been stripped of their powers because of him. Their names, when put together, spell \\"abra-kadabra\\" backwards. *Arcadio, a handsome warrior with an especially pronounced chin, who is considered the greatest hero of his time, especially by himself. He has often enlisted Groo as his \\"lackey\\", and while Groo has succeeded in his quests time and again, Arcadio always gets the credit. *Chakaal, a beautiful female warrior, and Groo's equal in swordplay. Chakaal is also strong, noble, and wise, and Groo is madly in love with her. She is as well known as a hero and skilled warrior as Groo is for being a walking disaster, and travels the land seeking people in need of her help. Though she respects Groo's prowess as a warrior, Chakaal is all too aware of his incompetence in other areas, as well as his general stupidity and lack of social graces, and finds Groo at best tolerable when she is in need of his sword, and contemptible otherwise. Romantically speaking, she considers his idiotic advances repulsive, and does her best to ignore them, though she is not above using Groo's feelings for her to convince him to help her in her quests, and will often use Groo as a decoy or sacrificial lamb. *Granny Groo, Groo's gypsy grandmother. Granny Groo often tries to use her grandson to aid her in her moneymaking schemes, but invariably ends up giving him a good spanking when he fails. *Grativo the Wizard, who often punishes Arba and Dakarba for their failures. *Grooella, Groo's sister. While she greatly resembles her brother, the two of them are totally different: Grooella is a queen. However, her occasional reliance on her brother for aid has spelled disaster every time, and she despises him. Grooella had long, beautiful blond hair as a child, but one of Groo's \\"games\\" (which nearly always ended in the injury of at least one other child) damaged it so that it became black and frizzy. (The Sage developed a one-time-only formula to restore her hair, but Groo \\"erred\\" again and rendered the damage permanent.) *The Minstrel, a singing jester who speaks exclusively in rhyming couplets. He often likes to sing of Groo's deeds, but Groo seldom appreciates his unflattering descriptions of his bungling. An unusual aspect of the Minstrel is that the ornately carved head of his lute differs in every panel in which it appears. The Minstrel seldom appeared in later issues, due to the difficulty of creating his dialogue: \\"Mark takes a stance, and if by chance / The Minstrel doesn't vanish, / Then Mark will go, and Sergio / can write this stuff in Spanish.\\" *Pal and Drumm, two con men. The diminutive Pal is always looking for easy money, but his hulking partner Drumm is not very bright. Their dealings with Groo have often left them in trouble with the people they were scamming. Their names are a play on palindrome. *Pipil Khan, a short and short-tempered conqueror who speaks like Elmer Fudd. He correctly views Groo as the cause of many of his later attempts at conquest ending in disaster, but having never met the man personally, imagines Groo to be a far more imposing figure than he actually is. When he finally meets the real man who's haunted the latter years of his life, the shock kills him. *Rufferto, Groo's dog and inseparable companion. Rufferto ran away from his boring life as a spoiled and pampered royal pet to seek adventure, and endeared himself to Groo. In Rufferto's eyes, Groo is a hero and a tactical genius. Initially, Groo viewed Rufferto as a potential meal but eventually came to regard him as his faithful companion. Groo can also safely board a ship in Rufferto's presence. His collar is immensely valuable. *The Sage, a wise, old man who is usually never far from Groo. The Sage often attempts to give Groo sound advice, but Groo's stupidity means that the advice is misinterpreted and only makes situations worse. The Sage is never without his dog Mulch. The Sage has known Groo since childhood and often tells his tales for all who are willing to listen. Apart from Rufferto, the Sage is the only character in the Grooniverse who genuinely counts Groo as a friend. *Taranto, a corrupt general who has had his plans for glory dashed by Groo several times, and is obsessed with killing the wanderer. Groo can never remember whether he is friends with Taranto, or if Taranto wants to kill him. *Weaver and Scribe, a successful author and his amanuensis, who look suspiciously like Groo own Evanier and Sakai. *The Witch of Kaan, an eccentric old hag who always has a potion ready for anybody who visits her. The setting Groo's adventures take place in an environment that generally resembles Medieval Europe, although his travels have also taken him to places that resemble Africa, Indonesia, Japan, the Middle East, and elsewhere. In addition to regular flora and fauna, dragons and other legendary creatures occasionally appear, and several cultures use dinosaur-like creatures as beasts of burden. Over the years, Groo has also encountered several \\"non- human\\" cultures such as the Kalelis and the Drazil. The currency in Groo's world is usually the Kopin. Although many technologies and peoples in Groo appear ancient, more modern innovations such as the printing press can be found as well. The creators Groo is initially plotted and drawn by Sergio Aragon√©s, and Mark Evanier then writes the dialog. Sakai then does the lettering, after which Aragon√©s does the final artwork, including the word balloons. Finally, Luth does the coloring. Evanier also answers the letters page, something he takes special pride in, since the practice in mainstream comics is to pass this task off to low-level assistants, something he did not know when his own teenage fans' letters were published. He claims that no one knows what he does, and that he does not get paid. His official credit, during the Marvel/Epic run, was usually a ludicrously polysyllabic title that changed every issue. Caricatures of Aragon√©s, Evanier, Sakai, and Luth often appear as background characters within the stories, sometimes with family members. Evanier and Sakai are also the role models for the characters Weaver and Scribe. Rufferto was based on Aragon√©s' own dog named Rufferto, who is actually more mottled than spotted. Rufferto one page stories Starting with issue 87 of Marvel's ongoing Groo series, issues of Groo ended with a wordless one page gag involving Groo's dog Rufferto. When the Groo comic went to Image and Dark Horse comics, these one-page Rufferto stories continued. In one instance, (Groo issue 9 from Image Comics) Rufferto's brother Arfetto replaced Rufferto as the star of the backup story. In all 93 of these Rufferto one page stories were printed. Publication history Aragon√©s created the character of Groo in the late 1970s. However, at that time no comic book company would allow creators to retain the rights to their characters, and Aragon√©s did not wish to surrender those rights. In 1981, a comic book, Destroyer Duck #1, was published by Eclipse Comics as a benefit to raise money for a legal battle over creator rights; a four-page story contributed by Aragon√©s featured Groo's first published appearance. A few months later, Groo appeared in a two-page preview ad and the back cover art in Starslayer #4, published by Pacific Comics. The second Groo story appearance was in a five- page backup story in Starslayer #5. In 1982, Pacific Comics began publishing Groo the Wanderer as a regular series. Pacific faced various financial difficulties and was only able to publish eight issues of the title. With Pacific unable to publish new material, a one-shot issue of material that was originally written for them (titled the Groo Special) was instead published by Eclipse. When Groo was published by Pacific, he was not portrayed as a bumbling idiot. In fact, one issue had him use his brains to create sophisticated traps and his speech was similar to Conan the Barbarian's. Aragon√©s and Evanier eventually negotiated a deal with Epic Comics, an imprint of Marvel Comics, for that company to take care of publication while preserving creator rights. This resulted in the longest run of Groo the Wanderer with 120 issues. In 1994, with Marvel facing financial difficulties, the title switched to Image Comics\\"Newswatch: Groo Wanders to Image,\\" The Comics Journal #172 (November 1994), pp. 40. and was retitled Groo. (In the first issue Groo remarks \\"The marvels of the world are but images before me.\\") When Image in turn faced legal problems after publishing twelve issues, the title switched to Dark Horse Comics in 1998. Dark Horse is not publishing the title as a regular series, but is periodically releasing new material and reprints as miniseries and collections. At the 2007 WonderCon, the creators revealed that since 2005 they had been trying to produce a Groo/Conan crossover (both titles are published by Dark Horse). The project encountered a number of postponements; although two issues had been completed by the spring of 2011, the series was further delayed because of a backache suffered by Aragon√©s. The book finally saw print in July 2014, with Aragon√©s and writer Mark Evanier working with artist Thomas Yeates, who drew the Conan portions of the book. Similar characters The character of the Groosalugg in the TV series Angel is generally called \\"Groo\\" by other characters, and is a somewhat na√Øve wandering barbarian hero who is a highly skilled swordsman. In Norway, the magazine Pyton once parodied the comic by placing the Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland in the role of Groo, as a pun on her name. Also in Norway, when the local version of Mad magazine ran a parody of Ronia, the Robber's Daughter, the \\"gray dwarves\\" pestering Ronia had become \\"Groo dwarves\\".

It is also known as a celiotomy.  Origins and history The first successful laparotomy was performed without anesthesia by Ephraim McDowell in 1809 in Danville, Kentucky. On July 13, 1881, Dr. George E. Goodfellow treated a miner outside Tombstone, Arizona Territory, who had been shot in the abdomen with a .32-caliber Colt revolver. Goodfellow was able to operate on the man nine days after he was shot when he performed the first laparotomy to treat a bullet wound.  Terminology  The term arises from the Greek word Œª·æ∞œÄŒ¨œÅ·æ± (\\"lapara\\"), meaning \\"the soft part of the body between the ribs and hip, flank,\\" and the suffix \\"-tomy\\" arising from the Greek word \\"œÑŒøŒºŒÆ\\" meaning \\"a (surgical) cut.\\" In diagnostic laparotomy (most often referred to as an exploratory laparotomy and abbreviated ex-lap), the nature of the disease is unknown, and laparotomy is deemed the best way to identify the cause. In therapeutic laparotomy, a cause has been identified (e.g. colon cancer) and the operation is required for its therapy. Usually, only exploratory laparotomy is considered a stand-alone surgical operation. When a specific operation is already planned, laparotomy is considered merely the first step of the procedure.  Spaces accessed  Depending on incision placement, laparotomy may give access to any abdominal organ or space, and is the first step in any major diagnostic or therapeutic surgical procedure of these organs, which include: * the digestive tract (the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon) * the liver, pancreas, gallbladder, and spleen * the bladder * the male prostate * the female reproductive organs (the uterus and ovaries) * the retroperitoneum (the kidneys, the aorta, abdominal lymph nodes)  Types of incisions  = Midline = The most common incision for laparotomy is a vertical incision in the middle of the abdomen which follows the linea alba. * The upper midline incision usually extends from the xiphoid process to the umbilicus. * A typical lower midline incision is limited by the umbilicus superiorly and by the pubic symphysis inferiorly. * Sometimes a single incision extending from xiphoid process to pubic symphysis is employed, especially in trauma surgery. Midline incisions are particularly favoured in diagnostic laparotomy, as they allow wide access to most of the abdominal cavity. = Midline incision = # Cut (incised) the skin in midline (linea alba) # Cut (incised) subcutaneous tissue # Divide the linea alba (white line of the abdomen) # Pick up peritoneum, confirm that there is no bowel adhesion (intestinal adhesion) # Nick peritoneum # Insert finger beneath the wound to make sure that there is no adhesion # Cut the peritoneum with scissors = Other = Other common laparotomy incisions include: * Kocher (right subcostal) incision (after Emil Theodor Kocher); appropriate for certain operations on the liver, gallbladder and biliary tract. This shares a name with the Kocher incision used for thyroid surgery: a transverse, slightly curved incision about 2 cm above the sternoclavicular joints; * Davis or Rockey-Davis \\"muscle-splitting\\" right lower quadrant incision for appendectomy, named for the Oregon surgeon Alpha Eugene Rockey (1857-1927) and the Philadelphia surgeon Gwilym George Davis (1857-1918), who devised such incision style in 1905. * Pfannenstiel incision, a transverse incision below the umbilicus and just above the pubic symphysis. In the classic Pfannenstiel incision, the skin and subcutaneous tissue are incised transversally, but the linea alba is opened vertically. It is the incision of choice for Cesarean section and for abdominal hysterectomy for benign disease. A variation of this incision is the Maylard incision in which the rectus abdominis muscles are sectioned transversally to permit wider access to the pelvis. This was pioneered by the Scottish surgeon Alfred Ernest Maylard (1855-1947) in 1920. * Lumbotomy consists of a lumbar incision which permits access to the kidneys (which are retroperitoneal) without entering the peritoneal cavity. It is typically used only for benign renal lesions. It has also been proposed for surgery of the upper urological tract. * Cherney Incision - developed in 1941 by the American uro-gynecologic surgeon Leonid Sergius Cherney (1908-1963). Complications following laparotomy Globally, there are few studies comparing perioperative mortality following laparotomy across different health systems. One major prospective study of 10,745 adult patients undergoing emergency laparotomy from 357 centres in 58 high-, middle-, and low-income countries found that mortality is three times higher in low- compared with high-HDI countries even when adjusted for prognostic factors. In this study the overall global mortality rate was 1.6 percent at 24 hours (high 1.1 percent, middle 1.9 percent, low 3.4 percent; P < 0.001), increasing to 5.4 percent by 30 days (high 4.5 percent, middle 6.0 percent, low 8.6 percent; P < 0.001). Of the 578 patients who died, 404 (69.9 percent) did so between 24 h and 30 days following surgery (high 74.2 percent, middle 68.8 percent, low 60.5 percent). Patient safety factors were suggested to play an important role, with use of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist associated with reduced mortality at 30 days. Taking a similar approach, a unique global study of 1,409 children undergoing emergency laparotomy from 253 centres in 43 countries showed that adjusted mortality in children following surgery may be as high as 7 times greater in low-HDI and middle-HDI countries compared with high-HDI countries, translating to 40 excess deaths per 1000 procedures performed in these settings. Internationally, the most common operations performed were appendectomy, small bowel resection, pyloromyotomy and correction of intussusception. After adjustment for patient and hospital risk factors, child mortality at 30 days was significantly higher in low-HDI (adjusted OR 7.14 (95% CI 2.52 to 20.23), p<0.001) and middle-HDI (4.42 (1.44 to 13.56), p=0.009) countries compared with high-HDI countries. Absorption of drugs administered orally was shown to be significantly affected following abdominal surgery.P. Gershkovich, C. Itin, A. Yacovan, S. Amselem, A. Hoffman, Effect of abdominal surgery on the intestinal absorption of lipophilic drugs: possible role of the lymphatic transport, Transl Res, 153 (2009) 296-300. doi.org/10.1016/j.trsl.2009.02.008, PMID: 19446284  Related procedures  A related procedure is laparoscopy, where cameras and other instruments are inserted into the peritoneal cavity via small holes in the abdomen. For example, an appendectomy can be done either by a laparotomy or by a laparoscopic approach. There is no evidence of short-term or long-term advantages for peritoneal closure during laparotomy.

Lap dancing is different from table dancing, in which the dancer is close to a seated patron, but without body contact. With lap dancing, the dancer may be nude, topless or scantily dressed, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction and the club's policies. With full-contact lap dances, the stripper may engage in non-penetrative sexual contact with the patron, such as \\"grinding\\" or \\"twerking\\" his or her body against the patron. Variant terms include couch dance, which is a lap dance where the customer is seated on a couch. In some places, a \\"block session\\" of lap dances (usually a half an hour to an hour) can be booked in a \\"champagne room\\" or \\"VIP room\\", which is a private room usually located in the back of a club. In many clubs, the duration of a lap dance is measured by the length of the song being played by the club's DJ. Charges for lap dances vary significantly. Depending on the local jurisdiction and community standards, lap dances can involve touching of the dancer by the patron, touching the patron by the dancer, neither, or both. In some clubs, any touching by the patron is forbidden. On the other hand, absent any oversight by the club, various levels of contact may be negotiable between the participants. Clubs vary widely with regard to whether they enforce their rules or turn a blind eye to any violations. There is some debate as to whether lap dancing is entertainment or a type of sex work.Einat Albin, \\"The Case of Quashie: Between the Legalisation of Sex Work and the Precariousness of Personal Service Work\\", Industrial Law Journal, (2013) 42 (2): 180-191. doi: 10.1093/indlaw/dwt006 - Accessed on 12 March 2014 Critics of lap dancing allege that some club owners, by installing dark private booths and charging dancers steep stage fees, are covertly condoning and encouraging the sale of sexual acts between customers and dancers. This can be a concern if, as for instance in the United Kingdom, the club has a public entertainment licence rather than a sex establishment licence, and in jurisdictions where brothels are illegal.Bindel, Julie, \\"Profitable Exploits: Lap Dancing in the UK\\", Study for the Glasgow City Council (August 2004) According to the UK paper The Guardian, \\"Research shows that the majority of women become lap-dancers through poverty and lack of choice.\\"Bell, Rachel, 'I was seen as an object, not a person', The Guardian (19 March 2008), Accessed: 23 October 2011 History and legal issues Typical area where lap dances are had in semi- private Lap dancing clubs are a later development of earlier strip clubs, where strippers danced on stage and were paid a wage. In the 1970s, New York's Melody Theater introduced audience participation and called it \\"Mardi Gras\\". The Melody Theater became the Harmony Theater and operated in two locations in Manhattan for over 20 years until it was closed down in 1998. Also during the 1970s, adult film makers Jim and Artie Mitchell had been running an adult movie house, called the O'Farrell Theatre, in San Francisco to feature their films. But in the second half of the '70s, with the invention of the videocassette recorder and a proliferation of video cassette rental stores, the demand for adult movie theaters began to plummet.McCumber(1992), p. 78. Realizing that they needed a new business model for their building, the Mitchell brothers sent manager Vince Stanich around the country to explore customer-contact shows in sex clubs.McCumber(1992), p. 78. After Stanich reported back, the Mitchell brothers responded in 1977 by opening three new rooms at their O'Farrell Theatre featuring customer-contact shows: The Ultra Room, The Kopenhagen, and New York Live.McCumber(1992), p. 79. The Kopenhagen's shows were performed by a pair of naked women in a small room with about twenty men. However the club's most profitable new venue was New York Live, which was a cabaret-style strip club act with women dancing three song sets upon a stage, while usually being totally nude for the final song.McCumber(1992), p. 79, 155. Most of the strippers who were not dancing were sitting naked on customers' laps for tips. The amount of tipping rapidly increased and was then marketed as a \\"lap dance\\", and its popularity caused lines of men to regularly appear outside the theater's doors.McCumber(1992), p. 81, 155 The Mitchells hired new dancers as fast as they could to keep up with demand, and had created another sex-show innovation which gained them international notoriety and generated more money than their film business.McCumber(1992), p. 80. Later in 2004, a San Francisco District Attorney's decision to drop prostitution charges against lap dancers in the city changed the sexual culture of San Francisco and \\"has the potential to influence the policies of other cities\\". In some areas of the U.S. and Canada, local authorities began cracking down on lap dancing after reports that some clubs allowed customers to engage in sexual intercourse or other sexual activity with dancers during lap dance sessions. Various strip clubs have wide-ranging rules on how customers should interact with strippers. =Canada= In 1973, an upmarket Vancouver bar called \\"Gary Taylor's Show Lounge\\" employed showgirls and strippers as waitresses who gave a free dance with every drink. The club was raided by the police under the guise of obscenity legislation, but, in 1974, Judge Jack McGivern ruled that dancer nudity was not obscene, which started a trend of nude dancing in bars. No contact between dancers and patrons was allowed at the club, but Gary Taylor's had a boxing ring where the girls performed revealing acrobatics after stripping off and then earned tips. Americans from Washington state made the trip to the club from the United States, which at the time had stricter laws. In a landmark ruling regarding the 1994 case of Pat Mara and Allan East (the owner and manager of Cheaters Tavern), Judge E. Gordon Hachborn legally defined lap dancing and ruled that it did not contravene Canadian public decency statutes. A number of conflicting judgements were issued in the years that followed, including decisions to close certain bars in which sex acts took place on the floor of the club and other rulings in which patrons were allowed to touch the dancers, as long as an actual sex act did not take place. In 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that a typical lap dance did not constitute an \\"obscene\\" act within the meaning of the Criminal Code. The Crown did not argue that lap dances constituted \\"prostitution\\", and therefore the court did not address the possible issue that the typical lap dance may contravene one or more anti-prostitution laws. This led to the displacement of strip clubs and table dancing clubs in Canada by lap dancing clubs. In 2005, two Supreme Court of Canada rulings (R. v. Labaye and R. v. Kouri) decriminalized private sex clubs in Canada. On 20 December 2013, (in Bedford v. Canada) the Supreme Court of Canada found the laws prohibiting brothels, public communication for the purpose of prostitution, and living on the profits of prostitution to be unconstitutional. The ruling gave the Canadian parliament twelve months to rewrite Canada's prostitution laws; in the meantime, existing anti-prostitution laws continued to be enforced. Current laws on prostitution in Canada, introduced in 2014, make it illegal to purchase sexual services (including lap dancing) but legal to sell them. =Ireland= In the early 2000s, lap dancing expanded rapidly in the Republic of Ireland, building on an existing strip pub industry. A number of lap- dancing clubs were opened in Dublin, including one by the English nightclub owner Peter Stringfellow. Lap-dancing clubs were also opened across the country. Many of Ireland's lap-dancing clubs have subsequently closed as a result of the worsened economic climate and changes to Ireland's licensing laws in 2008. Reputational issues have also played a part in the decline of Ireland's lap-dancing clubs. Police raids took place on Irish lap-dancing clubs in 2003 in search of criminal activity as part of Operation Quest. Efforts to distance Irish lap dancing from the sex industry were hampered by the UK's decision in 2010 to classify its lap dancing clubs as sex establishments. Ireland's lap-dancing clubs became viewed as more expensive than their rivals overseas and more restricted in terms of the entertainment on offer. By 2012 there were five or six clubs operating in Dublin, one in Galway and one in Cork. Most lap-dancing clubs in Ireland operate a no- touching rule, and typically do not charge dancers a \\"house fee\\" to perform, instead taking a proportion of the dancer's earnings. =United States= Some jurisdictions in the United States outlaw lap dances and enforce a minimum distance between dancer and patron. In Seattle, one such minimum distance ordinance was overturned by public referendum in November 2006. Also in 2006, concerned about reports of sexual assault and illegal stage fees, San Francisco's Commission on the Status of Women recommended a ban on private rooms and booths at adult clubs in the city. However, a majority of dancers at the Commission's meetings and the San Francisco Board of Supervisors' meetings protested against these efforts, fearing for their income and claiming that these rooms were safer than other venues. As a result, the Commission's proposed ban was not adopted by the city. In February 2010, the Detroit City Council voted to ban lap dances in VIP rooms. However, across from Detroit in Windsor, Ontario in Canada, lap dancing remained legal, even where alcohol was served, and sex clubs were also legal in Windsor. Current laws on prostitution in Canada, introduced in 2014, make it illegal to purchase sexual services (including lap dancing) but legal to sell them. In 2012, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that lap dances were not an art form and are subject to sales tax. exotic dancer demonstrating a contact lap dance =United Kingdom= The first lap dancing club in the UK was opened in 1995. During the 2000s the lap dancing industry grew quickly, with the Licensing Act 2003 as the only legislation in England and Wales regulating lap dancing clubs. The Lap Dancing Association (LDA), a trade association for the UK lap dancing industry, was formed in 2006 and officially launched in 2008. It operated a code of practice for its members. According to a BBC report, as of November 2008, the association represented roughly one-third of the industry's clubs. Members included For Your Eyes Only, Spearmint Rhino, Bandit Queen and Candy Bar. In 2008, clubs were being opened at a rate of about one per week. In April 2008 the LDA proposed that its code of conduct should become legally enforceable by local authorities as part of their licensing function. The association submitted a memorandum to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee in November 2008 when the latter was reviewing the Licensing Act 2003. The association said that there was no sexual activity offered for sale in their clubs, and that to classify them as part of the sex industry would stigmatise performers. Simon Warr, who ran the clubs Platinum Lace and For Your Eyes Only and who was the president of the LDA In 2009, gave oral evidence to the committee, describing lap dancing as \\"not sexually stimulating\\". Three MPs undertook a fact-finding visit to a London lap dancing club at the invitation of the LDA. The association opposed the provisions of the subsequent Policing and Crime Act 2009 which reclassified lap-dancing clubs in England and Wales as \\"sexual entertainment venues\\" instead of \\"entertainment venues\\", introduced a licensing system for clubs and allowed local authorities to decide the number and location of lap-dancing clubs in their area. Chris Knight, vice-chairman of the LDA, said that the cost of the additional licence required to run a lap dancing club from 2010 could affect many businesses and questioned the right of local authorities to make licensing decisions on \\"emotive and moralistic grounds\\". In 2009, the total number of clubs had reached its peak of 310 (approximately twice the number in 2003), and the number of lap-dancers was estimated at 10,000. Lap-dancing clubs had opened in big cities, small towns, and out-of-town business parks. The figures plateaued during the subsequent weaker economic climate and had hardly changed by 2012. At that point, the amount of money a lap-dancer earned in an average shift was ¬£230 (down from around ¬£280 in 2011), and the industry was valued at around ¬£300 million. However, some clubs, particularly in London, charged a house fee for the dancers to perform and had an increased number of dancers, which reduced an individual dancer's earnings. Between 2010 and 2015, there were approximately forty-five refusals of licences for sexual entertainment venues in England and Wales, mainly on the grounds that the locality was unsuitable. Pdf The legislation provides for no right of appeal against such refusals, except on the grounds that committees have not followed correct procedure. The number of refusals, together with the costs of licence application, means that there have been few new businesses opened since 2010, with the overall number of clubs declining over time as a number of local authorities implemented a \\"nil limit\\" for new clubs. In February 2014, Fiona Mactaggart (MP for Slough) asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Iain Duncan Smith, if he would \\"make it his policy not to offer job subsidies for employing teenagers as auxiliary workers in adult entertainment establishments\\". Her question related to employers in the adult entertainment industry being offered an incentive of over ¬£2,000 from the Department for Work and Pensions for every unemployed young person (aged 18‚Äì24) that they hired. Esther McVey, the Minister of State for Employment, stated that: \\"The Welfare Reform Act 2012 ensured that vacancies which involve performing sexual activities were banned from being advertised on Government websites and a distinction was made in law to differentiate between performers and ancillary workers.\\" Scotland In 2005 Tom McCabe MSP set up the Adult Entertainment Working Group, an advisory body within the Scottish Government, to investigate the legislative issues involved in a proposed lap dancing ban in Scotland. At that time, lap dancing clubs in Scotland were licensed under Section 41 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, which covers general entertainment licenses, and licences in Scotland could not be refused on the basis of the nature of the entertainment in itself. The working group, headed by Linda Costelloe Baker, consisted of academics, lawyers and politicians, and had a working period from April 2005 until April 2006. It commissioned the market research organisation Ipsos MORI to examine the public's attitudes towards adult entertainment, completed site visits and took evidence from a variety of witnesses. Respondents to the group's consultation included the Church of Scotland. The group reported to Scottish ministers on 25 April 2006. The group concluded that lap dancing venues are a form of \\"commercial sexual exploitation...which encompasses pornography, internet sex chat rooms, sex phone lines, escort services, prostitution, trafficking for prostitution, peep shows, lap dancing, pole dancing, table dancing and stripping\\". It recommended reviewing the licensing of lap dancing venues and proposed national guidelines to prevent performers from touching or being touched by customers, ensuring that activities are visible at all times, and introducing a minimum age of 18 for everyone involved. A prominent voice of opposition to a lap dancing ban was exotic dancer Veronica Deneuve who set out to try to involve the stripping community in the discussion to inform such legislation. The International Union of Sex Workers said that the \\"recommendations are flawed and would be extremely detrimental to workers and operators in the industry\\". The Scottish Government accepted a number of the recommendations, but it rejected the idea that licensing boards should be able to determine whether full nudity is appropriate in given locales. It also rejected the idea of a compulsory one- metre no-touching zone between dancer and customer, suggesting that this would be unenforceable. It did, however, propose to enable licensing boards to consider nude dance venues as a separate class of venue. No legislation directly followed the group's report. However, the report informed the statement of licensing policy of many licensing boards across Scotland on the introduction of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005. In 2013 the Scottish Government and carried out a consultation on the regulation of \\"sexual entertainment venues\\". This, in combination with the AEWG's 2006 report, paved the way for the Scottish Parliament to introduce licensing reform for lap dancing as part of the Air Weapons and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2015. This came into effect in 2016 and requires local authorities in Scotland to set out individual policies with regard to the licensing of lap dancing clubs. Northern Ireland Northern Ireland's first lap dancing club, Le Chic nightclub, with lap dancers mainly from Russia and the Baltic republics. The owner, Donegal businessman Jerome Brennan, owned a club in Dundalk, in the Republic of Ireland but near the border. He already owned a lap dancing club in Limerick in the Republic. In 2002 Brennan opened the Movie Star Cafe, a lap dancing club in Belfast, with lap dancers from Belfast and England. The Belfast club was officially opened as a restaurant to circumvent Northern Ireland's licensing laws. The opening of the club was opposed by Rev. David McIlveen, a minister in the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, and the club was often picketed by protesters from the Church and women's groups. In 2003 councillors from Belfast City Council expressed their intention to refuse the renewal of the club's licence, and the club closed in November 2003 with debts of over ¬£300,000. The Le Chic nightclub in Dundalk remained open. Labor issues and job conditions The economic position of lap dancers, as employees of the clubs, has also changed. Over time, most strip clubs have stopped paying wages to the dancers. Stage dancing became a showcase to advertise the bodies of the dancers, whose money came from the tips or standard charges, depending on the club, that the patrons gave them for lap dancing. In the majority of clubs, dancers are simply charged a percentage of their nightly takings. However, the latest development in many countries, including Great Britain, the United States and Canada, is that many clubs charge dancers a \\"stage fee\\" or \\"tip-out\\", which is an amount that a dancer needs to pay a club (usually in advance) in order to work on a given night, per shift. The lapdancers are expected to tip the \\"house mothers\\" (women who work in a strip club to support and assist the dancers) and DJs. Given that dancers are basically paying for the privilege to be at a club, some clubs allow as many dancers as possible to appear on any given night, increasing competition among the dancers. Also, the vast majority of clubs will not waive this charge if a night happens to be slow. Consequently, the dancer either leaves her shift without any profit or builds a debt to the club.Strip City: A Stripper's Farewell Journey Across America, Lily Burana, Talk Miramax Books, 2001 Concerns raised by lapdancers include patrons stalking them, exposing their penis, ejaculating in their pants, attempting to have sex with the dancers without their consent, or committing sexual assault. Some lapdance clubs have CCTV cameras in the \\"champagne rooms\\" for the safety of the dancers. Mary Jane says that when a lapdancer wishes to have paid sexual activities with a client, she tips the management, waitresses, and DJ to \\"turn a blind eye\\" to these sexual activities. In the U.S., most clubs treat dancers as independent contractors, thereby avoiding the need to pay minimum wages, overtime pay, income taxes and other benefits required by law. This status has repeatedly been challenged by some dancers. While labor commissions and the courts have, for the most part, ruled that exotic dancers are employees and deserving of reimbursement for back pay and stage fees, some court decisions have decided that an exotic dancer can be classified as an independent contractor. In June 2006, in Tracy Buel v. Chowder House (dba The Hungry I) an appellate court of California's first district ruled that dancer Tracy Buel, also known as \\"Daisy Anarchy\\", was correctly classified as an independent contractor and that \\"Buel shall pay defendants‚Äô costs on appeal\\". A publication called the California Employment Law Letter described the case as follows: \\"The dancer based her suit on the fact that she was an employee of the nightclub rather than an independent contractor. The appellate court, however, after applying a 10-factor test, upheld the jury's verdict in favor of the nightclub and its owners and found that the evidence weighed in favor of classifying the dancer as an independent contractor rather than an employee.\\"\\"Exotic dancer stripped of her job\\", David R. Ongaro, California Employment Law Letter, Vol. 16, No. 9. 14 July 2006 A UK study on lap dancing found that the overwhelming majority of those surveyed were satisfied with their work, because they got to choose their own hours, got paid instantly, got more money than in other available jobs, and had the opportunity to combine \\"fun and work\\" (e.g., socializing with other dancers and patrons).Sanders, Teela & Hardy, Kate, 'The Regulatory Dance: Sexual Consumption in the Night Time Economy' (April 2011), Accessed on 24 October 2011Colosi(2010), p. 2. At the same time, the same study revealed various disadvantages to lap dancing work, such as: the women never knew how much they would earn each week; the women had to try to keep their job secret from friends and family; the women had to face some rude and abusive customers. As well, while most felt safe, almost half of the dancers had faced frequent verbal harassment and unwanted touching from patrons. Another issue raised by the dancers was their lack of labour rights in the workplace and the high overhead costs ‚Äì house fees (or stage fees), commissions, fines (whether paid directly to the club's management or not), and tipping out (or paying a portion of their income) to DJs and bouncers. The UK paper The Guardian gave a darker portrait of lap dancing in an article partly based on an interview with a former stripper.Bell, Rachel, \\"'I was seen as an object, not a person'\\", The Guardian (18 March 2008) It stated that \\"[r]esearch shows that the majority of women become lap-dancers through poverty and lack of choice,\\" and that \\"academic research has linked lap-dancing to trafficking, prostitution and an increase in male sexual violence against both the women who work in the clubs and those who live and work in their vicinity.\\" For example, a \\"recent conference in Ireland highlighted the use of lap-dance clubs by human traffickers as a tool for grooming women into prostitution; the clubs also normalise the idea of paying for sexual services.\\" \\"[R]esearch on strip clubs in the US found that all dancers had suffered verbal harassment and physical and sexual abuse while at work; all had been propositioned for prostitution; and three-quarters had been stalked by men associated with the club.\\" Critics of lap dancing choose to describe it as a type of sex work, because, in their opinion, \\"it is difficult to discern between the performance of erotic dance and prostitution.\\"Ditmore, Melissa Hope: Prostitution and Sex Work. ABC-CLIO, 2010, pp. 6-7 However, others contend that it is a misnomer to call a lap dancer a sex worker, because no sexual act is technically performed during a typical lap dance. Club owners in the UK argue that lap dancing should not be labelled as sex work. On the other hand, one lapdancer, Mary Jane, told a reporter that she and other lapdancers negotiate ‚Äúextras\\" (nicknamed the \\"secret menu\\") with clients, such as a \\"hand job\\" (male masturbation) or sexual intercourse, for additional payment. In 2007, based on statistics from eighteen dancers over a period of 60 days, it was noted that female lap dancers earned the highest tips around the time of ovulation, during the most fertile period of their menstrual cycle and the lowest tips during menstruation; the average difference in earning between those two times amounted to about $30 per hour. Women on the pill earned overall less than those not on the pill. The results were interpreted as evidence of estrus in humans: females apparently advertise their fertility status to males in some manner. This finding earned its authors the 2008 Ig Nobel Prize (a parody of the Nobel Prize given for unusual or trivial achievements in scientific research) in Economics. =Level of contact= Establishments that offer lap dancing, and the lap dancers themselves, are sometimes rated regarding \\"mileage.\\" It refers to the amount of contact between dancer and patron during the performance. Every jurisdiction has its own laws regarding such contact, but enforcement of these laws is sporadic. Ultimately, it comes down to what the club and the dancer will allow. Nevada, and especially Las Vegas, have established very lenient laws regarding what contact is allowed during a lap dance. Patrons may legally touch the dancer anywhere she will permit, excluding the genitals. This has led to a pricing strategy in some all-nude strip clubs, in which a standard lap dance is considered to be just topless with no contact, but can be upgraded to include full nudity and/or touching with additional payment.

Depending on the country and jurisdiction's traditions, members of the court (judges, magistrates, and so on) may wear formal robes, gowns, collars, or wigs. Even within a certain country and court setting, there may be times when the full formal dress is not used, such as in trials involving children (who might be intimidated by the robes and wigs). Commonwealth countries Short wigs as worn in court by advocates (left) and judges (right) in several Commonwealth countries. =United Kingdom= The Supreme Court Members of the old Judicial Committee of the House of Lords (or \\"Law Lords\\") and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council never wore court dress (although advocates appearing before them did). Instead, they were dressed in ordinary business clothing. Since the creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in 2009, the Justices of that court have retained the Law Lords' tradition of sitting unrobed. On ceremonial occasions they wear a robe of black damask embellished with gold with the logotype of the Supreme Court embroidered at the yoke. =England and Wales= Where court dress is worn Court dress is worn at hearings in open court in all Senior Courts of England and Wales and in the County Court. However, court dress may be dispensed with at the option of the judge, e.g. in very hot weather, and invariably where it may intimidate children, e.g., in the Family Division and at the trials of minors. Court dress is not worn at hearings in chambers or in magistrates' courts. Reform In July 2007, The Baron Phillips of Worth Matravers, the serving Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, announced that changes would be made to court working dress in the English and Welsh courts. The reforms were due to take effect on 1 January 2008; however, following reports of strong opposition to the proposed changes, they were put on hold, eventually taking effect in autumn 2008.Possible reform of court dress The new robes for judges were designed by Betty Jackson and unveiled in May 2008, although a survey of judges published in March 2009 revealed substantial opposition to the new designs, as well as widespread annoyance at the lack of consultation prior to the change. The Chairman of the Bar announced in April 2008 that, as a result of a survey of the profession, the Bar would recommend that advocates should retain their existing formal robes (including wigs) in all cases, civil and criminal, with possible exceptions in the County Court. In a letter to the profession, he said (in part): For the most part, the changes only affect what is worn by judges in civil courts, who now wear a simplified robe and no wig. Dress worn in criminal courts remains largely unchanged. The changes have been reflected in the dress allowances made to judges (while the one-off cost of supplying the new civil gown was estimated at about ¬£200,000, annual savings in the region of ¬£300,000 were projected). Advocates Barristers (short wig) and Queen's Counsels (in full ceremonial dress with long wig) English and Welsh advocates (whether barristers, solicitors or other authorised lawyers such as chartered legal executive advocates with the appropriate right of audience) who appear before a judge who is robed must themselves be robed. All male advocates wear a white stiff wing collar with bands (two strips of linen about hanging down the front of the neck). They also wear either a dark double-breasted suit (or with waistcoat if single-breasted) or a black coat and waistcoat and black or grey morning dress striped trousers (black lounge suit). The black coat and waistcoat can be combined into a single garment, which is simply a waistcoat with sleeves, known as a bar jacket or court waistcoat. Female advocates also wear a dark suit, but often wear bands attached to a collarette rather than a wing collar. Junior barristers Junior barristers wear an open-fronted black gown with open sleeves, gathered and decorated with buttons and ribbons, and a gathered yoke, over a black or dark suit, hence the term stuffgownsman for juniors. In addition, barristers wear a short horsehair wig with curls at the side and ties down the back. Solicitors Solicitors wear the same wing collar with bands, or collarette, as barristers. Their gowns are of a slightly different style, with a square collar and without gathered sleeves. By virtue of the Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction at I.1.1 (as amended by Practice Direction (Court Dress) (No4) [2008] 1 WLR 257), \\"Solicitors and other advocates authorised under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 ... may wear short wigs in circumstances where they would be worn by Queen's Counsel or junior counsel.\\" Other qualified advocates, such as chartered legal executive advocates, will wear the same attire as a solicitor. = Queen's Counsel = QC in court dress Barristers or solicitors who have been appointed Queen's Counsel (\\"QCs\\") wear a silk gown with a flap collar and long closed sleeves (the arm opening is half-way up the sleeve). For this reason, barristers who are appointed Queen's Counsel are said to have \\"taken silk\\", and QCs themselves are colloquially called \\"silks\\". The QC's black coat, known as a court coat, is cut like 18th-century court dress and the sleeve of the QC's court coat or bar jacket has a turned back cuff with three buttons across. On special ceremonial occasions (such as the opening of the legal year), QCs wear (in addition to their court coat, waistcoat and silk gown) a long wig, black breeches, silk stockings and buckled shoes, lace cuffs and a lace jabot instead of bands. Judges Judicial robes have always exhibited variety depending on the status of the judge, the type of court and other considerations. In addition to robes, judges have generally worn a short bench wig when working in court (reserving the long wig for ceremonial occasions) and a wing collar and bands at the neck. All judges in criminal cases continue to wear these traditional forms of dress, which are described in more detail below. Judges in civil and family cases, however, have since 2008 worn a new design of working robe with no wig, collar or bands; this plain, dark, zipped gown (of 'midnight blue gabardine with facings in navy blue velvet') is worn over an ordinary business suit and tie. The status of the wearer is indicated by a pair of different colored tabs below the collar: Appeal Court judges wear gold tabs, High Court judges wear red tabs, Masters and Insolvency and Companies Court Judges of the High Court wear pink, and District judges wear blue. It was originally envisaged that Circuit judges sitting in the High Court would likewise adopt the new-style robe with purple tabs, but they opted to retain their violet robe as worn in the County Court. On special ceremonial occasions (such as the opening of the legal year) more elaborate forms of traditional dress are worn, by civil and criminal judges alike. The Lord Chief Justice The Lord Chief Justice The Lord Chief Justice, when robed, dresses like a High Court Judge (see below) with the distinction of a train to his scarlet robe. On ceremonial occasions he wears the scarlet and fur hood and mantle, and in addition a gold chain of office in the form of a collar of esses. (Summer robes, with grey silk in place of the fur, were formerly routinely worn for part of the year and are still used on occasion.)2017 photo Lords Justices of Appeal Lords Justices of Appeal, full ceremonial dress, 2013 Judges in the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, wear the same black silk gown and court coat as QCs, together with the short bench wig. Judges of the Civil Division did likewise until 2008, but they now wear the new-style robe. The use of plain black gowns in the Court of Appeal dates from the origin of the Court in the 1870s, when it was populated by Chancery judges who were accustomed to this form of dress. On ceremonial occasions, all Judges of the Court of Appeal wear the full-bottomed wig, together with a black silk damask gown, trained and heavily embellished with gold embroidery, over court coat, lace cuffs and jabot, black breeches, stockings and buckled shoes. High Court Judges High Court Judges in full ceremonial dress, 2013 On ceremonial occasions, all High Court judges wear the traditional full-bottom wig, the furred scarlet robe (as described below, with scarf, girdle and tippet), with a matching hood and mantle in addition. Underneath, breeches are worn with stockings and buckled shoes. The judicial black cap is carried. Queen's Bench Division: When dealing with first-instance criminal business a High Court judge of the Queen's Bench Division wears a scarlet robe with fur facings, a black scarf and girdle (waistband), and a scarlet 'casting-hood' (tippet) worn over the shoulder. In addition, the judge wears a wing collar, bands, and a short wig. (Prior to 2008 this robe was only worn in the winter months; in summer months a different scarlet robe was worn, with grey silk facings in place of the fur. The 'summer' robe is no longer routinely provided, but its use is still permitted in court.) In civil cases, High Court judges wear the new-style robe with red tabs at the collar, and no wig, collar or bands. Before 2008, these judges wore: in winter a black robe faced with fur, a black scarf and girdle and a scarlet tippet, and in summer a violet robe faced with silk, with the black scarf and girdle and scarlet tippet. On red letter days (which include the Sovereign's birthday and certain saints' days), all judges of the Queen's Bench Division wear their scarlet robes. Chancery and Family Divisions: Until 2008, when working in court, judges in the Family and Chancery divisions of the courts wore the same black silk gown and court coat or bar jacket as QCs. Since autumn 2008 they too (if robed) have worn the new design of robe in court. High Court Masters and Insolvency and Companies Court Judges: Masters (in both the Queen‚Äôs Bench Division and Chancery Division) and Insolvency and Companies Court Judges (in the Chancery Division) formerly wore black gowns, white collar and bands, with short wigs, when sitting in open court. Since 2008 they wear the new design of civil robe with pink tabs at the neck and no longer wear wigs. Ceremonially, they wear a black court court, waistcoat and gown, with black breeches, stockings, buckled shoes, white lace jabot and cuffs, and a long wig, similar to the ceremonial costume of Queen‚Äôs Counsel. = Circuit judges = Circuit judges in full ceremonial dress, 2013 Circuit judges (in the County Courts or the Crown Court) wear a violet robe with lilac facings, introduced in 1919. As well as a girdle, the judges wear a tippet (sash) over the left shoulder - lilac when dealing with civil business and red when dealing with crime. Since autumn 2008, circuit judges in the County Court have not worn wigs, wing collars or bands; however, circuit judges in the Crown Court retain the wig, wing collars and bands. Prior to introduction of the violet robe, Circuit judges usually wore a plain black gown and short wig; this older tradition has been retained by the Central Criminal Court. On ceremonial occasions, circuit judges in addition to their violet robes wear a matching hood, long wig, black breeches, stockings and buckled shoes, and a lace jabot instead of bands. = District judges = New zip-up robe, as worn by District Judges on a ceremonial occasion Since autumn 2008, district judges in the county courts have worn the new-style robe, with the rank of district judge indicated by blue tabs on the facings of the robe by the collar. On ceremonial occasions, district judges wear their ordinary robe together with a short, bar wig. District judges (magistrates' courts) continue to sit without robes. Court officers Court clerks in the Crown Court, if a High Court judge is sitting, wear wig, black gown, wing collar (or collarette) and bands; if a circuit judge is sitting they wear the same outfit without a wig. Plain business dress is worn in the County Court. Court ushers generally wear a simple black gown over plain business dress. =Scotland= Lord Braxfield, Lord Justice Clerk 1776‚Äì1799 Scottish court dress is very similar to English court dress, but there are notable differences. For example, Scottish advocates wear tail coats under their gowns, and wear white bow ties instead of bands. QCs and judges wear long scarf-like ties (known as falls) instead of bands. Scottish judicial robes are very different from English ones. Senators of the College of Justice are Scotland's senior judges; they sit in both the Court of Session (Scotland's top civil court) and the High Court of Justiciary (Scotland's top criminal court). Judicial robes in the Court of Session are dark red, faced with red crosses (a stylised representation of what were once ribbons used to fasten the gown). Judicial robes in the High Court of Justiciary are predominantly white and red, faced with red crosses over the white. The white and red robe of the Lord Justice Clerk is differentiated by many small perforations in the white satin, through which the red cloth shows giving an ermine-like impression. The Lord Justice General wears a red robe and hood (without crosses) edged in ermine (black-spotted white fur). Sheriffs (who preside over Sheriff Courts) wear the black gowns which they formerly used in practice (silk gowns for QCs; stuff gowns for advocates and solicitor- advocates), with falls in place of the bow-tie. =Australia= thumb In Australia, court dress varies according to the jurisdiction. Judges in all Australian courts will not usually wear court dress for procedural or chambers proceedings. In the High Court of Australia, justices wear plain black robes with zippered fronts over normal attire. The robes are similar in appearance to those worn by Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, although they are more elaborately tailored. These robes have been worn since 1988, when the High Court abandoned the previous court dress of black silk robes, bar jackets, jabots or bands and full-bottomed wigs and lace cuffs on formal occasions and bench wigs for ordinary business attire. In the High Court of Australia, barristers wear the same dress as is required by the Supreme Court in their jurisdiction. In the Federal Court of Australia, judges no longer wear traditional court dress, but wear black wool robes with a black trim for 'first instance' work, and black wool robes with a red trim for appeal cases. These robes were adopted in 1997 and were designed by Bill Haycock. The robes have seven horizontal tucks or \\"ombres\\" on one side, representing the six Australian States and the territories. They also serve to symbolise Australia's federal constitution and the federal jurisdiction of the Court. The robes also include a vertical band of black silk made up of seven equal parts, also symbolizing Australia's federal system and equality before the law. For a matter heard in the Federal Court of Australia, barristers robe (but without a wig) if it is the usual practice to robe in the Supreme Court of the state or territory in which the matter is being heard. Judges and judicial registrars of the Family Court of Australia wear a black silk gown, a bar jacket with either bands or a jabot and a bench wig. On formal occasions, judges wear full-bottomed wigs. Judges of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia wear a plain black gown in court without a wig. Prior to 2010, counsel did not robe before the Federal Circuit Court of Australia. Barristers are now expected to robe for most hearings, but not for interlocutory or interim matters. Wigs are not worn on any occasion. Judges of the supreme courts of the states and territories of Australia wear court dress similar to that worn by judges of the High Court of England and Wales. On formal occasions, judges wear red scarlet robe with white fur facings, bands or a jabot, a black scarf and girdle and a scarlet casting-hood, with a full- bottomed wig. Unlike judges in the United Kingdom, judges in Australia never wear breeches, hose and buckled shoes. When sitting in criminal proceedings, judges wear scarlet robes with grey silk facings, bands or a jabot and a bench wig. When sitting in appeal or in civil proceedings, judges and masters wear a black silk gown, a bar jacket with either bands or a jabot and a bench wig. In some jurisdictions, the wearing of wigs has been abandoned for other than formal occasions. Judges of the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales and judges sitting in the Workers' Compensation Court of NSW and the Dust Diseases Tribunal of New South Wales wear the same court dress as a judge of the Supreme Court sitting civilly. Judges of the district or county courts of the states of Australia wear court dress similar to that worn by judges of the County Court of England and Wales. Stipendiary Magistrates and justices of the peace do not robe, other than in NSW where they have worn a black robe over normal business attire since 2005. Barristers in all Australian jurisdictions, when required to do so, wear court dress similar to that worn in the United Kingdom. Queen's Counsel or Senior Counsel wear a black silk gown, a bar jacket, bands or a jabot and a horsehair wig with curls at the side and ties down the back. On formal occasions, they wear full-bottomed wigs. In addition Victorian Senior Counsel wear a black rosette hanging from the back of their gown. Junior Counsel wear an open-fronted black stuff gown with open sleeves and a gathered yoke, and otherwise wear the same outfit as Senior Counsel (other than full-bottomed wigs). Counsel usually wear dark trousers or striped trousers, or a dark skirt for female barristers. Barristers will not usually robe for procedural hearings (which are called 'directions hearings' in South Australia). Solicitors, in those jurisdictions where the legal profession is not fused (such as New South Wales and Queensland) do not robe when appearing in court, even before superior courts. In those States and Territories with fused professions, solicitors robe in situations where barristers would normally wear robes. In 2010, the Chief Justice of Western Australia, Wayne Martin, introduced major reforms for Western Australian Courts; in the District Court, wigs were abolished for both lawyers and judges. District Court judges and lawyers maintained their robes. In the Supreme Court Criminal Jurisdiction, traditional judges' red robes were replaced with American-style plain black robes; this also applied to all appeal courts. Wigs were abolished in all Supreme Courts for both judges and lawyers. This change was met with sadness by some members of the legal fraternity in the state, as it ended over 180 years of tradition in Western Australia. =Canada= R. B. Bennett, the 11th prime minister of Canada in his barristers gown. Lawyers appearing before the Federal Court or the Tax Court of Canada are required to wear a gown. In Canada, court dress is identical to that previously (pre-2008) in use in England, except that wigs are not worn. Wigs were worn in early courts but phased out beginning in the mid-19th century with last holdouts British Columbia (1905) and Newfoundland and Labrador (upon joining Canada in 1949).https://jjmccullough.com/judges.htm). Bar jackets are worn under the gown, though QCs and judges have more elaborate cuffs than other lawyers. Barristers are required to gown for the Courts of Appeal and Superior-level courts of the provinces and territories, unless appearing on applications in chambers, in Small Claims Court or before Masters. The Federal Court and the Tax Court of Canada at the general procedure level require barristers to gown. As well, gowns are required at the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada. The donning of business attire is acceptable by barristers appearing in chambers and in inferior (puisne) provincial and territorial courts; court dress is also permitted, though rarely worn, with the exception of Quebec where gowns are standard practice in the Court of Quebec. Judges of the Supreme Court of Canada wear scarlet robes with white fur trim on ceremonial occasions together with black tricorne hats; however, they wear black gowns with white neck band tabs when hearing cases. Judges of all other federal and provincial courts wear black gowns, sometimes adorned with various sashes and crests which depend on the level of court and the province in which the case is heard. All Canadian judges also wear black court waistcoats with white collar and tabs. =Cyprus= In Cyprus, the courts have upheld the traditions of wearing black and white. All judges and advocates, equally, wear a black suit, black trousers, black shoes, white shirt, a white neck band, and a black gown. Exceptionally, in all the courts other than the Supreme Court advocates are allowed not to wear the black gown if they are not appearing before the Court for a hearing. Also, if it is not a hearing male advocates may wear a tie instead of a neck band before the lower courts. Additionally, special provisions are made for summertime. =Gibraltar= Supreme Court of Gibraltar (scarlet robe, summer pattern) Kenya English-style robes are worn in the Supreme Court of Gibraltar. =India= In India, the courts have upheld the traditions of wearing black and white. Male judges wear white shirts and trousers with a white neck band and a black coat, whilst female Judges normally choose to wear the traditional sari, and pair it with a white neck band and a black coat. Male lawyers are required to wear either: * A black buttoned up coat, chapkan, achkan, black sherwani and white bands with Advocates' gowns * A black open breast coat, white shirt, white collar, stiff or soft, and white bands with Advocates' gowns In either case they can wear long trousers (white, black striped or grey) or dhoti, but not jeans. Female lawyers are required to wear either: * Black full sleeve jacket or blouse, white collar stiff or soft, with white bands and Advocates' gowns; * White blouse, with or without collar, with white bands, a black open breast coat and Advocates' gowns; or * A Sari or long skirt (white or black or any mellow or subdued colour without any print or design) or flare (white, black or black striped or grey) with white bands, a black coat and Advocates' gowns; or * Churidar kurta (Punjabi dress) or salwar-kurta with or without dupatta (white or black) or traditional dress with white bands, a black coat and Advocates' gowns. Exemptions * In courts other than the Supreme Court, high courts, district courts, sessions courts or city civil courts, a black tie may be worn instead of bands. * Wearing of an advocates' gown is optional except when appearing in the Supreme Court or in high courts. * Except in Supreme Court and high courts during summer wearing of black coat is not mandatory. Other features * Neither the judges nor the lawyers wear wigs. * Both judges and lawyers wear a long black robe termed as the 'gown'. * Lawyers are supposed to wear a gown having the barrister's pouch at the back. However, in certain courts, junior advocates do not have the pouch but have a flap instead (akin to a solicitor's gown but with short sleeves). * Judges and senior advocates are distinguished by the extended sleeves on their gowns (i.e. they wear a traditional solicitor's gown) and not necessarily the QC gown as the material is not always 'silk' and may also be of stuff. * Judges and senior advocates are also distinguished by the different coat which is like a full sleeved vest or waistcoat. =Malaysia= Court dress in Malaysia is based on English court dress, with some modifications. Since the 1990s, judges no longer wear wigs, wing collars and bands but instead wear a waterfall cravat with court coat and black silk gown. Ceremonial robes for judicial office- bearers are generally black with gold lace, and include a Malay songkok. Counsel in Malaysia dress as English junior barristers do, but do not wear wigs. Prior to the 1980s, counsel serving in the government legal service wore wigs. Counsel in private practice have never done so. However, some counsels in East Malaysia still wear wigs as part of their court dress. =New Zealand= In New Zealand, court dress was simplified in 1996. District judges wear black American-style gowns in the Employment Court and District Court. High Court judges wear the QC's gown over suits, while counsel are only required to wear black gowns for jury trials in the District Court, and all the time in the Employment Court, High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court. Wigs (for counsel) are only worn on ceremonial occasions such as when newly qualified barristers are called to the Bar. No gowns are ordinarily worn by the judges of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand or Supreme Court of New Zealand. =Pakistan= After independence, in Pakistan, the courts have continued to uphold the pre-independence (British-Raj traditions) of lawyers wearing white shirt and black coat, trouser and tie. However, in the 1980s, judges modified their dress to do away with wig and to allowed (optional) the usage of a black sherwani, a long traditional Pakistani coat worn over a white shalwar and qamiz (trousers and shirt). In Pakistan, the dress code for lawyers or legal practitioners varies with the season. During the winter months, a formal black suit and tie are worn. During the hot summer months, white shirt and trousers and a white neck band may be worn. In addition, judges wear a black robe over their other garments. Wigs are no longer worn. Dress codes are rigorously enforced within the Superior Courts of the country. =Sri Lanka= In Sri Lanka, the British tradition of court dress had been adopted and practiced until reforms of the legal system took place in the 1970s, and much of the ceremonial and formal court dress worn by judges and lawyers was replaced with black business suits. However, the old traditions were revived in the 1980s with many elements of the traditional court dress being used today. Both judges and counsel dress in white and black, white shirt, black coat, tie and trousers for men and white sarees for women. Supreme Court Judges The Chief Judge and Judges of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka wear scarlet gowns when attending court. On ceremonial occasions (such as ceremonial sittings of the Supreme Court) they wear a scarlet gown, barrister's bands, mantle and a long wig. Justices of Appeal The President and Judges of the Court of Appeal of Sri Lanka wear black gowns when attending court. On ceremonial occasions (such as ceremonial sittings of the Supreme Court) they wear a black gown with purple borders, barrister's bands, mantle and a long wig. Lower court Judges High Court and District Court judges wear black gowns. Magistrates do not wear gowns. President's Counsels President's Counsel's court dress is similar to that of Queen's Counsels. It includes a silk gown with a flap collar and long closed sleeves (the arm opening is half-way up the sleeve). Therefore, the term \\"taken silk\\" continues. On special ceremonial occasions (such as ceremonial sittings of the Supreme Court), PCs also wear a long wig. Attorneys Attorneys at law wear white and black when appearing in all courts. They must wear black robes when appearing in the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal and the High Court; it is optional in the lower courts. Male attorneys may wear black suits with white shirt, black tie and trousers or white national, while female attorneys may wear a white saree or dress. Court staff The court usher known as Court Mudliar wears a white uniform, as do court Arachies. =Other Commonwealth realms= Court dress in many jurisdictions with legal systems derived from England's, including Caribbean and African countries, which have court dress identical to that in England and Wales. Other jurisdictions = China = Recent changes to Chinese courts have led to a more formal dress code. Business suits or black gowns (with a red stripe on the front) are replacing the military look of the Chinese court system. Judges of the supreme court wear black robes with a red strip with buttons. The buttons are gold with the top button having the seal of the People's Republic of China. Hong Kong As a common law jurisdiction, court dress in Hong Kong is practically the same as court dress in England and Wales. Under the auspices of the one country, two systems policy after 1997, when sovereignty of the former British crown colony was transferred to the People's Republic of China, the territory has continued to be a common law jurisdiction, and English legal traditions have been preserved. Judges of the former Supreme Court of Hong Kong wore wigs; those of the present Court of Final Appeal, however, do not wear wigs, but only gowns with lace jabot, similar to those worn on the International Court of Justice. Some judges wear wigs as part of the ceremonies during the opening address of the legal year in Hong Kong. = Czech Republic = Legal professionals in court wear a black robe with colored elements. The color depends on the profession ‚Äì purple (judges of common courts), red (state prosecutors) and blue (attorneys). Attorneys only wear robes in criminal proceedings and in all proceedings before the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Administrative Court. Judges of these courts wear specific robes. =Germany= Federal Constitutional Court robe First senate of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1989 wearing court dress. Fourth from the left is Roman Herzog, head of the court and later President of Germany. German court dress consists of a plain robe similar to the ones worn in the United States, normally without any kind of scarf or collar. However, judges and prosecutors always wear white shirts and white neckties under their robes, as is customary for lawyers in criminal cases. The colour of judges' robes varies between different kinds of courts and branches of the judiciary. While at the Federal Court of Justice in civil and criminal matters dark red robes with dark red velvet linings are always worn, lower courts ‚Äì which are under the jurisdiction of the German states ‚Äì use black in civil and criminal matters. Other branches of the judiciary (labour, administrative and social) use different colours of judges' robes. Hats are out of use at most German courts, with the exception of the Federal Constitutional Court, where they are still worn by the judges. While the colour of German judges' robes can vary, lawyers in all branches of the law nearly always wear black robes while in court, with the exception of those admitted to the Federal Court of Justice Bar, in civil matters; these specially appointed attorneys in private practice also wear dark red robes with silk linings. The robes of lawyers and judges can be distinguished by the size and material of the lining. State prosecutors wear the same black robes as states' judges sitting in \\"ordinary\\" (criminal or civil) courts, while representatives of the Federal Public Prosecutor General wear dark red robes like federal court judges. At the Federal Constitutional Court, a different type of robe is used which is based on the historical court dress of the Italian town of Florence. The constitutional court judges wear scarlet satin robes with a very high neckline, and caps, combined with a white pleated jabot. Lawyers appearing before the Constitutional Court wear their accustomed robes, i.e. black or dark red. =Ireland= Judiciary The Irish Free State, established in 1922, continued largely with the courts and court system inherited from the United Kingdom, albeit pared down and shorn of some of its imperial grandeur. To fit with the reorganization of the courts, the judiciary all but abandoned the wearing of their former ceremonial costumes. Prior to Independence, the Lord Chancellor, Master of the Rolls and the Lords Justice of Appeal in Ireland would have worn full ceremonial dress identical to their English equivalents, viz. long black damask robes with wide bands of gold lace and ornaments. The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Chief Baron (up to the extinction of the office on the retirement of Christopher Palles in 1916) and other puisne judges of the High Court would likewise have worn scarlet robes with ermine hood and ermine-trimmed mantle. Many fine examples of these robes can be seen in portraits of Irish judges in the King's Inns. Upon the passing of the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorst√°t √âireann) Act 1922, the office of Lord Chancellor immediately became defunct. Then in 1924 the Court of Appeal was refashioned into the Supreme Court; the Lord Chief Justice became simply Chief Justice and head of the judiciary; and the Master of the Rolls was replaced with a President of the High Court. The judges of the new superior courts, including the Chief Justice and President, adopted for all occasions‚Äîceremonial or otherwise‚Äîthe ordinary working judicial dress of the austere type previously worn by members of the old Court of Appeal, that is, as Order 119 rule 2 of the Rules of the Superior Courts, 1986 originally read: Wigs are now optional for judges of the High Court Judges of the Circuit Court also wear similar costume, pursuant to Order 3 rule 1 of the Circuit Court Rules, 2001. The prescribed dress of judges of the District Court (in Order 5 rule 1 of the District Court Rules, 1997) is the same, but does not include a wig. Order 119 rule 2 of the Rules of the Superior Courts was amended in 2012, and now stipulates that: This new uniform is worn without a wig, and the single white neck tab is more reminiscent of European style court dress. This alteration to the dress of the Supreme Court has also been implemented in the Court of Appeal, the Circuit Court and the District Court. The \\"double ribbon banding\\" is coloured dark blue with gold trim for judges of the Court of Appeal, dark red for judges of the Circuit Court and blue for judges of the District Court. Judges of the Circuit Court appointed prior to October 2016 and judges of the District Court appointed prior to March 2017 may wear the older judicial dress if they so wish. The dress of judges of the High Court remains unchanged. Wigs remain optional in the traditional dress, but do not constitute part of the recently introduced dress. Counsel Barristers' dress in the Republic of Ireland is almost unchanged since the pre- Independence era. Counsel may not exercise his right of audience unless he is properly attired. It is provided in Order 119 rule 3 of the Rules of the Superior Courts as follows: It may therefore be said that Irish barristers robe similarly to their English counterparts. Such robes are worn by barristers in all courts, including the District Court. Like Queen's Counsel in England, Senior Counsel generally wear a short bar wig and black silk or poplin gown with flap collar and long, closed sleeves over a buttoned and broad-cuffed court coat. Their shirts will have a detachable stiff wing collar, worn with bands. Junior Counsel wear a short bar wig and black poplin or stuff bar gown (which has a gathered yoke and short, open sleeves) over a dark three-piece suit with similar wing collar and bands. While it is not unknown for female barristers to wear a blouse with separate bands much like male colleagues, more commonly they would wear a starched white all-in-one collarette or bib covering their neckline that approximates in looks to a tall Mandarin collar and bands. Section 49 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, however, did abolish the requirement that barristers should wear wigs in court. To this extent only, the wording of the Rules of Court above is somewhat out of date. (All counsel still must wear a gown and bands etc.) By affording individual barristers a discretion to wear the forensic wig in court, the new rule defused what had become an increasingly bitter debate in the profession whether it was appropriate to cleave to anachronistic modes of dress - even as a traditional and undoubtedly recognizable uniform - and avoided a more drastic solution, such as the abandonment of wigs or gowns altogether. Accordingly, there is little contemporary call for reform of court dress in Ireland. =Call to the Bar= Junior counsel are called to the Bar in three sittings in the year, one in Hilary term, one Trinity term, and the other in Michaelmas term. This ceremony takes place in the Supreme Court. All new barristers habit themselves in full court working dress. =Call to the Inner Bar= Senior Counsel are appointed annually in the Call to the Inner Bar, a short ceremony in the Supreme Court towards the end of Michaelmas term. (Junior counsel are members of the Outer or Utter Bar.) On this occasion alone do the new Senior Counsel wear full-bottomed wigs, though with their working robes rather than with the breeches, stockings, patent court shoes and lace stock of former times. This is purely a matter of convention and is not, so it would seem, governed by any rule of court. Since 1922, the Chief Justice has presided over the ceremony in lieu of the departed Lord Chancellor. None has seen fit to alter the manner of the Call. Family law proceedings Judges and counsel are forbidden to wear wigs and gowns in proceedings in the District, Circuit and High Courts in respect of inter alia the following Acts: * Legitimacy Declaration Act (Ireland) 1868 * Children Acts 1908 to 2001 * Adoption Acts 1952 to 1998 * Married Women's Status Act 1957 * Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 * Family Home Protection Act 1976 * Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976 * Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act 1981 * Family Law Act 1981 * Status of Children Act 1987 * Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act 1989 * Child Care Act 1991 * Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act 1991 * Family Law Act 1995 * Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 * Domestic Violence Act 1996 It is arguable that the Oireachtas intended the ban on \\"wigs and gowns\\" should be read liberally to mean that judges and barristers should appear in ordinary suits in these cases. In practice, a literal interpretation of the rule has been preferred. Judges and counsel do not wear either wig or gown in the family courts but will dutifully don the court coat (if applicable) and a wing collar and bands nonetheless. Full court working dress remains worn in the Supreme Court in any proceedings, including those under the foregoing statutes. Sittings outside the law terms The Rules of Court oblige judges and barristers to wear court dress only \\"during the sittings\\" that is, during the four law terms of Michaelmas, Hilary, Easter and Trinity. In any hearing during the vacations, judges and counsel wear ordinary suits. Solicitors By virtue of Section 17 of the Courts Act 1971, all solicitors have full rights of audience in the superior courts of Ireland. When appearing as advocates, they wear ordinary suits and, unlike in England, are not required to wear gowns. = Israel = Eichmann's trial at Jerusalem District Court, three judges Both Israeli judges and lawyers (while appearing in court, especially in higher courts) wear black robes, generally worn open to show a white shirt, black necktie, and dark trousers or skirts, and a dark jacket in the winter, or a similar outfit for women. The robes and neckties may bear the logo of the Israel Bar Association. (Out of court, many lawyers will wear a Bar Association pin in their jacket lapel.) While the practice of lawyers wearing court dress is a legacy of the British Mandate that immediately preceded Israeli independence, the relatively simple outfit (and lack of wigs) shows American influence; both nations' systems of law have similarly influenced Israel's. = Italy = In Italy judges, prosecutors and lawyers wear black robes in higher courts or in criminal cases. Judges and prosecutors wear red, ermine-lined robes with golden striped hats on solemn occasions such as the opening of the judicial year. = Netherlands and Belgium = Dutch judge. Portrait of Adrien baron de la Kethulle de Ryhove (1851-1933), former first president of the court of appeal in Ghent, Belgium. In the Netherlands and Belgium, judges, lawyers and prosecutors dress identically in the form of a black robe and a white band. This is a symbolic act, as it is meant to convey the idea that the judge is merely the representative of Dutch or Belgian law, rather than an elevated individual with the power of sentencing people. This idea finds its origins in the time of the French revolution. However, there are some slight differences between the judge and the lawyer. The judge wears a black robe, with silk ties on the sleeves and on the closure of the robe. Lawyers just wear a simple black robe. The higher the rank in court, the fancier the robe becomes; the members of the Dutch 'Hoge Raad' (High Council) wear a velvet black robe with ermine ties. In Belgium, the ceremonial robes of the judges in the courts of appeal, the courts of labour and the Court of Cassation use the color red in addition to black. The official Belgian court dresses are laid down in the royal decree of 22 July 1970. Previously, Dutch judges shared no common dress as the Spanish Netherlands and the Dutch Republic, as the Netherlands were highly decentralised with only provincial and urban law and no federal law. Hence judges would dress as was the tradition in their own cities or towns. =Norway= In Norway all court officers wear robes according to what type of court, a black wool robe with a scarlet velvet lapels and cuffs for judges in the Supreme court, a black wool robe with a black velvet lapels and cuffs for judges in Appellate court and Municipal court. Advocates (councellors) and prosecutors wear a black wool robe with a black silk lapels and cuffs. Court scribes (court reporters) wear a black lapel-less wool robe with no adornment on the cuffs. Prosecutors who are police advocates (police prosecutors) can wear their police uniform with their rank insignia on their shoulders. Bailiffs wear a police-like uniform. There are no special collars, wigs or hats. The judge in municipal court, as well as the senior judge in appellate court can decide that no one wears robes, on a case to case basis, but this happens only in non- air conditioned courtrooms on hot summer days. Lay judges (2 in municipal court, and 5 in appellate court) wear no special clothing. =Sweden= In Sweden there is no official court dress for judges and judges do not wear gowns. Judges usually wear an ordinary suit. =United States of America= Judicial court dress Group photo of United States Supreme Court Justices from 2009. Optional formal dress can be seen under the robes, such as bow ties. Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also wear lace jabots During the early history of the United States, the court dress of judges and practicing lawyers closely mirrored British court dress of the 18th century; both wore white powdered wigs and (typically) black robes in the lower courts, and in the higher ones, judges would wear red with black markings. The practice fell out of favor and died out by the mid-nineteenth century. Today, generally judges of both state and federal courts are free to select their own courtroom attire, although some jurisdictions do formally require judges to wear robes of some kind when presiding over hearings in court.See, e.g., N.J. Ct. R. 1:2-1, available at http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/rules/r1-2.html (\\"Every judge shall wear judicial robes during proceedings in open court.\\") The most common choice is a plain black robe which covers the torso and legs, with sleeves. Female judges will sometimes add to the robe a plain white collar or lace jabot. Beneath the robes business attire is standard (although judges will sometimes don business casual attire, since they are only ever seen in court wearing a robe). Typically judges pay for their own custom made judicial robe. William Cushing, showing early U.S. Supreme Court dress, with a wig Until the tenure of Chief Justice John Marshall, all Supreme Court justices wore red robes with ermine trim and full-bottomed wigs, reminiscent of British court dress. Marshall, however, eschewed this formality and began the practice of only wearing a black silk robe, with no wig. In 1995, Chief Justice William Rehnquist added four gold bars (similar in appearance to captain insignia in the US Navy) to each sleeve of his black robe, but the change in his attire (he had been Chief Justice since 1986) was his own innovation and was inspired by a production of the operetta Iolanthe, rather than any historical precedent.https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/22/weekinreview/ideas-trends-the- chief-justice-has-new-clothes.html His successor, John G. Roberts, chose to remain with the traditional plain black robe. Some Supreme Court justices (including Clarence Thomas, the late Antonin Scalia, and Stephen Breyer, all of whom are or were balding) maintain the ancient legal practice of wearing large black skullcaps, in their case when wearing their robes outdoors in cold weather (for example, at presidential inaugurations in January.) Many state supreme court justices wear unique styles of robes, the most notable being the Maryland Court of Appeals, where all judges wear red, and British-style tab collars. The judges of the Delaware Superior Court continue to wear the red sashes or baldrics of their British predecessors, albeit now only on ceremonial occasions. Some judges eschew special dress entirely and preside over their courts in normal business wear. This is often seen among administrative law judges who preside over relatively informal administrative hearings. Attorney court dress Lawyers wear normal business attire in courts of all levels. During the second-wave feminism movement in the 1970s, some judges forbade female attorneys to wear trousers when appearing in court, but pantsuits are now widely accepted. Like judges, American attorneys do not wear wigs. Until the 1970s, morning dress was required of all attorneys appearing before the United States Supreme Court by the Court's rules. Even after the Court abolished the requirement, the Office of the Solicitor General maintained the practice. When the Solicitor General (or any of the deputies) appears before the U.S. Supreme Court, they wear morning dress, with striped trousers, grey ascot, waistcoat, and a cutaway morning coat. A feminized version is sometimes worn by female deputies, which consists of the same garments tailored to female measurements. Former Solicitor General Elena Kagan, the only woman to hold the office to date, appeared before the Court in pantsuits in lieu of morning dress. The traditional female equivalent of morning dress, \\"softly flowing dresses with hats\\", is strictly for social purposes and would be inappropriate attire for appearances before the nation's highest court. The Court's Marshal and Clerk of both sexes also wear morning dress when the Court is in session.

The word butte comes from a French word meaning knoll (but of any size); its use is prevalent in the Western United States, including the southwest where mesa is used for the larger landform. Because of their distinctive shapes, buttes are frequently landmarks in plains and mountainous areas. To differentiate, geographers use the rule of thumb that a mesa has a top that is wider than its height, while a butte has a top that is narrower than its height. Formation Buttes form by weathering and erosion when hard caprock overlies a layer of less resistant rock that is eventually worn away. The harder rock on top of the butte resists erosion. The caprock provides protection for the less resistant rock below from wind abrasion which leaves it standing isolated. As the top is further eroded by abrasion and weathering, the excess material that falls off adds to the scree or talus slope around the base. On a much smaller scale, the same process forms hoodoos. Notable buttes The Mitten Buttes of Monument Valley in Arizona are two of the most distinctive and widely recognized buttes. Monument Valley and the Mittens provided backgrounds in scenes from many western-themed films, including seven movies directed by John Ford. The Devils Tower in northeastern Wyoming is a laccolithic butte composed of igneous rock rather than sandstone, limestone or other sedimentary rocks. Devils Tower in Wyoming Three other notable formations that are either named butte or may be considered buttes even though they do not conform to the formal geographer's rule are Scotts Bluff in Nebraska which is actually a collection of five bluffs, Crested Butte which is a mountain in Colorado, and Elephant Butte which is now an island in Elephant Butte Reservoir in New Mexico. Among the well-known non-flat-topped buttes in the United States are Bear Butte, South Dakota, Black Butte, Oregon, and the Sutter Buttes in California. In many cases, buttes have been given other names that do not use the word butte, for example, Courthouse Rock, Nebraska. Also, some large hills that are technically not buttes have names using the word, examples of which are Kamiak Butte and Chelan Butte in Washington state.

He was most notable for his absent-mindedness, and for supposedly mixing up the syllables in a spoken phrase, with unintentionally comic effect. Such phrases became known as spoonerisms, and are often used humorously. Many spoonerisms have been invented and attributed to Spooner. Life and career William Archibald Spooner was born on 22 July 1844 at 17 Chapel Street, Grosvenor Place, London. He was the eldest son of William Spooner and Jane Lydia Spooner. He was educated at Oswestry School (where he was a contemporary of Frederick Gustavus Burnaby) and New College, Oxford, where he was the first non-Wykehamist to become an undergraduate. He was ordained deacon in the Church of England in 1872 and priest in 1875. In 1878, he became chaplain to Archbishop Archibald Tait. William Spooner married Frances Wycliffe Goodwin on 12 September 1878. He had five children: William Wycliffe, Frances Catharine, Rosemary, Ellen Maxwell, and Agnes Mary. Spooner remained at New College for more than sixty years, serving as fellow (1867), lecturer (1868), tutor (1869), dean (1876‚Äì1889) and warden (1903‚Äì1924). He lectured on ancient history, divinity and philosophy (especially on Aristotle's ethics). Spooner was well liked and respected, described as \\"an albino, small, with a pink face, poor eyesight, and a head too large for his body\\". It was said that \\"his reputation was that of a genial, kindly, hospitable man.\\"Reader's Digest (February 1995); John Hanbury Angus Sparrow, Words on the Air, \\"Memory\\". In the opinion of Roy Harrod, Spooner exceeded all the heads of Oxford and Cambridge colleges he had known \\"having regard to his scholarship, devotion to duty, and wisdom.\\"Hayter, W. (1977). Spooner: A biography. London: W.H. Allen. (See page 135) Spooner died on 29 August 1930 and was buried in the cemetery at Grasmere in Cumbria. Spoonerisms Spooner has become famous for his (real or alleged) \\"spoonerisms\\", plays on words in which corresponding consonants, vowels, or morphemes are switched. Few, if any, of his own spoonerisms were deliberate, and many of those attributed to him are apocryphal. Spooner is said to have disliked the reputation gained for getting his words muddled. The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations (3rd edition, 1979) lists only one substantiated spoonerism: \\"The weight of rages will press hard upon the employer.\\" In a 1930 interview, Spooner himself admitted to uttering \\"Kinkering Congs Their Titles Take\\" (Conquering Kings...) Spooner called this hymn out from the pulpit in 1879. Many other quotations, \\"probable and improbable, were invented\\" and attributed to Spooner, including: * \\"It is kisstomary to cuss the bride\\" (...customary to kiss the bride) * \\"I am tired of addressing beery wenches\\" (weary benches) * \\"Mardon me padam, this pie is occupewed. Can I sew you to another sheet?\\" (Pardon me, madam, this pew is occupied. Can I show you to another seat?)\\"A Field Guide to the English Clergy' Butler-Gallie, F p49: London, Oneworld Publications, 2018 * \\"You have hissed all my mystery lectures, and were caught fighting a liar in the quad. Having tasted two worms, you will leave by the next town drain\\" (You have missed all my history lectures, and were caught lighting a fire in the quad. Having wasted two terms, you will leave by the next down train) Spooner is supposed to have committed other absent-minded gaffes. He was said to have invited a don to tea, \\"to welcome Stanley Casson, our new archaeology Fellow\\". \\"But, sir,\\" the man replied, \\"I am Stanley Casson\\". \\"Never mind,\\" Spooner said, \\"Come all the same.\\" On his death, The Times recorded that \\"He was not afraid of conversation.\\"J.A.Gere and John Sparrow (ed.), Geoffrey Madan's Notebooks, Oxford University Press, 1981  Works  * The Moral Philosophy Of Aristotle (1879) * Bishop Butler (1901) See also *Absent-minded professor *Spoonerism References External links *Who was Dr. Spooner of \\"spoonerism\\" fame?

It was an early and popular terminate and stay resident program (TSR) for MS-DOS which enabled computer users to activate the program using a hot key combination (by default: Ctrl-Alt) while working in other programs. Although a text-mode program, Sidekick's window-based interface echoed that of the Apple Macintosh and anticipated the eventual look of Microsoft Windows 2.0. It included a personal calendar, text editor (with WordStar-like command interface), calculator, ASCII chart, address book, and phone dialer. According to the prospectus for Borland's initial public offering of stock to the public, Sidekick sold more than 1 million copies in its first three years. Origin According to Philippe Kahn, Borland did not originally intend to sell Sidekick. It developed the utility to assist the small company's employees. After several months of use Borland realized that it had a saleable product. Versions =MS-DOS= 1.0 Sidekick 1.0 included Calculator, Notepad, Appointment Calendar, Auto Dialer, ASCII Table and other tools. 1.0 Plus Sidekick 1.0 Plus included a broader selection of calculators (Business, Scientific, Programmer, Formula), a 9-file Notepad text editor, Appointment Book and Scheduler, a terminal communication tool and ASCII Table. In addition to variants on and enhancements to the 1.0 features, Plus included a 9-file Outliner, q file and directory manager, Clipboard, and supported Expanded Memory and a RAM disk. Control+Alt is the default shortcut to open sidekick 1.0 plus 1.5 2.0 Sidekick 2.0 was the last MS-DOS version. Traveling Sidekick Traveling Sidekick included a 3-ring binder notebook with solar-powered pocket calculator, and Sidekick software.Traveling Sidekick: A notebook that's easy to update =Windows= When Philippe Kahn left Borland in 1994 to found Starfish Software, he acquired all rights to Sidekick from Borland. Starfish's co-founder Sonia Lee Kahn designed the look and feel of Sidekick 95, which was launched simultaneously with Windows 95 with great success. In 1998 Philippe Kahn and Sonia Lee Kahn sold Starfish to Motorola for $325 Million in a private transaction. Starfish was later bought by Nokia who discontinued the product, with Sidekick 99 being the last version. T-Mobile USA, Inc. currently owns the Sidekick trademark portfolio. Later versions of the program were made available for Windows, with the last versions featuring a phone dialer and syncing with Palm, Windows CE, and EPOC devices. These versions were less popular than the MS-DOS versions, largely because the Windows environment itself provided most of the original version's key features: task switching and a collection of small utilities. It did however, include a monthly/yearly calendar and a world time map showing which parts of the world are currently in daylight or darkness. Up to eight different world cities (which could be edited) were displayed above and below the map. 1.0 Sidekick for Windows 1.0 was developed and released by Borland before Kahn left the company. It was designed for Windows 3.1 and included Calendar, To Do List, Contacts, a communication tool and a calculator. However, most of the design and file system came from the YourWay PIM software, purchased by Borland from Prisma Software in 1993. As the November 7, 1994 Info World noted, \\"Despite its name, the only connection between Sidekick for Windows 1.0 and the venerable Sidekick for MS-DOS is that Borland International owns both programs. Sidekick for Windows is a combination of the calendaring code from Prisma Software Corp.'s Windows PIM YourWay (purchased by Borland last year) and a completely new interface developed by Borland.\\" 2.0 Sidekick 2.0 was also developed and initially released by Borland before the move to Starfish. New/modified features included: * overlapping appointments in the Scheduler, * multiple contact files in the Address Book, * print layouts that enabled users to print to commercial day planner pages, * View-in-View, * Backup & Restore of user's files, * password protection. Sidekick Deluxe added more than 40 content files for access to online information, Dashboard 3.0 for Windows, and the \\"Organized for Success\\" video. It was distributed in CD format. Sidekick 95 Sidekick 95 was a Windows 95 version. Sidekick 95 Deluxe was announced in on October 17, 1995. A 10-user version was announced in February, 1996. It included Write (a word processor with a spell check feature), EarthTime (a clock), Expense (record keeping tools), Reminder (scheduler), Phone Dialer (communication), Contact Manager and Calendar (with an added daily Almanac). Sidekick 95 Deluxe added Dashboard 95, America Online software, 2 interactive organizational videos, over 40 useful content files called Sidekick Companions and electronic versions of the product manuals in Adobe Acrobat format. Starfish Internet Sidekick Calendar tools added Activity view, daylight saving time support, web link support for contact files, Contact file synchronization over Sidekick 95. Communications tool adds caller ID, phone dialer, integration with mail software. Spell check adds auto spell check option. Calculator supports unit conversion. New tools include Internet Scheduler, Expense reporter. Expense reporter includes date reporting, tax calculation, drag and drop receipts between folders. Sidekick 97 Calendar tools added ability to create web pages from Sidekick Calendar (via WP add-on). Address tools added drag and drop, ability to create web pages from Sidekick Cardfiles (via WP add-on). PDA sync is supported for Palm Pilot, via separate add-on. World Clock supports European Daylight Saving time. Sidekick Web Publisher compatibility is added via separate add-on. Sidekick 98 Calendar supports vCalendar, Outlook calendars. Address tools support Outlook calendars. Additional supported PDA sync include Franklin REX. Sync tool can now synchronize To do, Calls, Special Days, Appointments, and Contacts. World clock added world map, Analog or Digital clock format. In addition, features requiring separate add-ons in Sidekick 97 are now standard. Long time users of Sidekick 98 report no difficulties continuing to use the program through subsequent iterations of Windows, up to and including Windows 7. Sidekick 99 (9.x) Various tools found in Sidekick 98 are removed in this release, including dialer, back up & restore, calculator (including conversion tools, expense reporter), spell checker, web page generator, Internet scheduler. Address and calendar file format support were reduced, with Outlook support is now import-only. Synchronization tools now support multi-point synchronization, Franklin REX PRO, PALM III PDAs. =OS/2= Borland Sidekick 2.0 for Presentation Manager was based on Sidekick 2.0 for Windows. =Macintosh= Borland introduced a version for the Apple Macintosh in 1985. Reception Borland sold 400,000 copies of Sidekick by September 1985. InfoWorld stated in November 1984 that \\"whoever wrote this gem understands Murphy's law ... Sidekick stands in the shadows behind whatever program you are using\\", and noted that for programmers, the software was less expensive \\"and a lot handier\\" than a Texas Instruments hexadecimal calculator. The magazine concluded that \\"Sidekick is a time-saving, frustrating-saving bargain [and] is the first step to making paper and pencil obsolete.\\" Jerry Pournelle praised Sidekick in Byte in October 1984: \\"Philippe Kahn ... now has a product that IBM PC users won't be able to do without. He ought to sell a zillion copies\\". Elsewhere in the issue, the magazine stated that Sidekick's existence \\"seems to point out a major drawback in quite a few integrated software packages. Why should owners of advanced, multifunction business programs that are supposedly easy to use and that claim to solve all problems be compelled to purchase a utility like Sidekick? It makes you wonder about all those advertising claims\\". In January 1985 Pournelle selected Sidekick as one of his products of the year for the IBM PC. BYTE in 1989 listed SideKick Plus as among the \\"Distinction\\" winners of the BYTE Awards, stating \\"Talk about a bang for the buck\\".

The American immigration authorities misspelled his name as Bronislau Kaper. He was also variously credited as Bronislaw Kaper, Bronislaw Kapper, Benjamin Kapper, and Edward Kane. Kaper is perhaps best remembered as the composer of the jazz standards \\"On Green Dolphin Street\\" (lyrics by Ned Washington) and \\"Invitation\\" (lyrics by Paul Francis Webster) which were the respective title songs for the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Green Dolphin Street (1947) and Invitation (1952). He also scored the MGM film musical Lili (1953) for which he received the Academy Award for Best Original Score. Kaper's later works include 1962 remake of Mutiny on the Bounty,Mutiny on the Bounty, IMDb and the TV series The F.B.I. (1965‚Äì1974). Biography Bronis≈Çaw Kaper was born in Warsaw, Poland, to a Jewish family, and began playing the piano at the age of six, and soon demonstrated considerable talent on this instrument. He studied composition and piano at the Warsaw Conservatory, and law at Warsaw University, in deference to his father's wishes. Soon after completing his studies, Kaper went to Berlin‚Äîthen a city teeming with theaters and cabarets, where many artists from other parts of Europe lived. In Berlin, in the late 1920s, Kaper met another young composer, the Austrian Walter Jurmann. The two worked as a team, first in Berlin and then, after the Nazis took power in Germany, in Paris. The emergence of sound film created a major market for their talents. In Paris, they composed music for films directed by persons who had fled the rise of nazism and consequent persecution of Jews and other minorities. In 1935, upon being offered a seven-year contract with MGM by studio head Louis B. Mayer, Kaper and Jurmann emigrated to the United States, where they continued their work. One of their first American films was the Marx Brothers comedy A Night at the Opera (1935), for which they composed the song \\"Cosi-Cosa\\". Kaper and Jurmann also co-wrote the theme song for the 1936 film San Francisco and worked again with the Marx Brothers on their follow-up film A Day at the Races (1937), for which Kaper, Jurmann, and Gus Kahn wrote the song \\"All God's Chillun Got Rhythm\\", which became a minor jazz standard. Kaper was part of a significant community of refugees in Los Angeles during the 1940s who had fled Nazi-occupied/war-torn Europe for the United States. This community included composers, writers, and filmmakers such as Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Bertolt Brecht, Arnold Schoenberg, Lion Feuchtwanger, Max Reinhardt, Hanns Eisler, and Berthold and Salka Viertel. His sole musical theater venture in New York was 1946's \\"Polonaise,\\" for which he both adapted music by Chopin and composed many numbers himself.\\"Polonaise, New Musical, Billed for Erlanger.\\" Buffalo (NY) Courier-Express, 3 February 1946. In 1947 Kaper scored the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film Green Dolphin Street, whose title song \\"On Green Dolphin Street\\" (lyrics by Ned Washington) is perhaps Kaper's most enduring and popular composition. It has since become a treasured jazz standard recorded by artists including Miles Davis, Sarah Vaughan, John Coltrane, Tony Bennett, and Eric Dolphy. Kaper composed perhaps his second most-enduring song \\"Invitation (song)\\" (lyrics by Paul Francis Webster) for director George Cukor's melodrama A Life of Her Own; but it was not till its use as the theme song for the 1952 film Invitation that the song became popular. \\"Invitation\\" has been widely recorded, by artists including Quincy Jones, Rosemary Clooney, Dinah Washington, and Jaco Pastorius as the title track of his 1983 album Invitation (Jaco Pastorius album). In 1954 Kaper won an Oscar for scoring of the musical Lili (1953) starring Leslie Caron, and featuring Kaper's song \\"Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo\\" with lyrics by Helen Deutsch. Kaper also scored Caron's next film, The Glass Slipper, a musical adaptation of the fairy tale Cinderella. In 1959, Kaper composed most of the music for MGM's production of Green Mansions with Audrey Hepburn and Anthony Perkins, after MGM had asked Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos to write the score. Only some of Villa-Lobos' music was used in the film; much of the rest was later arranged as the secular cantata Forest of the Amazons, which Villa-Lobos recorded in stereophonic sound for United Artists Records with the Symphony of the Air. One of Kaper's last projects under his MGM contract was also his most ambitious: the big-budget 1962 remake of Mutiny on the Bounty starring Marlon Brando, for which he wrote epic seafaring melodies as well as native Polynesian music (Nominated for Academy Award for Best Musical Score). MGM had originally wanted composer Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa (who was known for lush epics) to score this remake, but R√≥zsa declined. The film's love theme \\"Love Song from Mutiny on the Bounty (Follow Me)\\" has found a place in the repertoire of popular Polynesian music and is occasionally performed for tourists at Luaus. Kaper's interest in melding exotic indigenous music with traditional styles continued in Lord Jim, where he introduced Western audiences to the unique sound of the southeast-Asian gamelan orchestra. For television, Kaper composed the theme music and several scores for the Quinn Martin-produced series The F.B.I. In total, Kaper composed music for nearly 150 Hollywood films.

A farmers' market (or farmers market according to the AP stylebook) is a physical retail marketplace intended to sell foods directly by farmers to consumers. Farmers' markets may be indoors or outdoors and typically consist of booths, tables or stands where farmers sell their produce, live animals and plants, and sometimes prepared foods and beverages. Farmers' markets exist in many countries worldwide and reflect the local culture and economy. The size of the market may be just a few stalls or it may be as large as several city blocks. Due to their nature, they tend to be less rigidly regulated than retail produce shops. They are distinguished from public markets, which are generally housed in permanent structures, open year-round, and offer a variety of non-farmer/non-producer vendors, packaged foods and non-food products. History Auf dem Vogelmarkt (women offering hares and wild birds), 18th-19th century Drawing by Marguerite Martyn of Soulard Market, St. Louis, Missouri, United States, in 1912 The current concept of a farmers' market is similar to past concepts, but different in relation to other forms ‚Äì as aspects of consumer retailing, overall, continue to shift over time. Similar forms existed before the Industrial age, but often formed part of broader markets, where suppliers of food and other goods gathered to retail their wares. Trading posts began in 1930s, a shift toward retailers who sold others' products more than their own. General stores and grocery stores continued that specialization trend in retailing, optimizing the consumer experience, while abstracting it further from production and from production's growing complexities. Modern industrial food production's advantages over prior methods depend largely on modern, cheap, fast transport and limited product variability. But transport costs and delays cannot be completely eliminated. So where distance strained industrial suppliers' reach, where consumers had strong preference for local variety, farmers' markets remained competitive with other forms of food retail. Starting in the mid-2000s, consumer demand for foods that are fresher (spend less time in transit) and for foods with more variety‚Äîhas led to growth of farmers' markets as a food-retailing mechanism. Benefits =To farmers= Farmers' markets can offer farmers increased profit over selling to wholesalers, food processors, or large grocery firms. By selling directly to consumers, produce often needs less transport, less handling, less refrigeration and less time in storage. By selling in an outdoor market, the cost of land, buildings, lighting and air-conditioning is also reduced or eliminated. Farmers may also retain profit on produce not sold to consumers, by selling the excess to canneries and other food-processing firms. At the market, farmers can retain the full premium for part of their produce, instead of only a processor's wholesale price for the entire lot. However, other economists say \\"there are relatively few benefits in terms of energy efficiency, quality or cost ... fun though they are, are not good economic models.\\" Some farmers prefer the simplicity, immediacy, transparency and independence of selling direct to consumers. One method noted by the special interest group Food Empowerment Project promotes community-supported agriculture programs (CSAs). In this scheme, consumers pay farms seasonally or monthly to receive weekly or biweekly boxes of produce. Alternatively, they may be required to pay for an entire season's worth of produce in advance of the growing season. In either case, consumers risk losing their money if there is a crop failure. =To communities= Among the benefits often touted for communities with farmers' markets: * Farmers' markets help maintain important social ties, linking rural and urban populations and even close neighbors in mutually rewarding exchange.Robinson, J. M., and J. A. Hartenfeld. The Farmers‚Äô Market Book: Growing Food, Cultivating Community. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2007. * market traffic generates traffic for nearby businesses * buying at markets encourages attention to the surrounding area and ongoing activities * by providing outlets for 'local' products, farmers' markets help create distinction and uniqueness, which can increase pride and encourage visitors to return. Reduced transport, storage, and refrigeration can benefit communities too: * lower transport & refrigeration energy costs * lower transport pollution * lower transport infrastructure cost (roads, bridges, etc.) * less land dedicated to food storage Farmers' markets may also contribute to innovative distribution means that strengthen civic engagement by reducing the social distances between urban and rural communities. With fewer intermediaries, the support of independent growers by local community members can enhance local economic opportunities and health & wellness in poor communities.Romanienko, Lisiunia. Dual Labor Market Theory and the Institutionalization of Farmers Markets: Marginalized Workers Adapting to Inhospitable Conditions in Louisiana. Journal of Interdisciplinary Economics, 12(4):359-73 2001. =To consumers= Some consumers may favor farmers' markets for the perceived: * reduced overhead: driving, parking, etc. * fresher foods * seasonal foods * healthier foods * a better variety of foods, e.g.: organic foods, pasture-raised meats, free-range eggs and poultry, handmade farmstead cheeses, heirloom produce heritage breeds of meat and many less transport-immune cultivars disfavored by large grocers * a place to meet neighbors, chat, etc. * a place to enjoy an outdoor walk while getting needed groceries Evidence seems to show that overall prices at a typical farmers' market are lower than prices at a supermarket because the process of production is more concise; there is less distance to travel and fewer middlemen.Halweil, Brian, and Thomas Prugh. Home Grown: The Case for Local Food in a Global Market. Washington, DC: Worldwatch Institute, 2002. Print. Regional emphasis St. Jacobs Farmers' Market in Ontario, Canada Grand Prairie Farmers Market in Grand Prairie, Texas =United States= Due in part to the increased interest in healthier foods, a greater desire to preserve local cultivars or livestock (some of which may not be up to commercial shipping or yield standards) and an increased understanding of the importance of maintaining small, sustainable farms on the fringe of urban environments, farmers' markets in the US have grown from 1,755 in 1994 to 4,385 in 2006, to 5,274 in 2009, to 8,144 in 2013. In New York City, there are 107 farmers' markets in operation. In the Los Angeles area, 88 farmers' markets exist, many of which support Hispanic and Asian fare. In the U.S., all levels of government have provided funding to farmers' markets, for instance, through the federal programs including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, the Farmers' Market Nutrition Program, and the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program. The programs primarily subsidize purchases at farmers' markets by low-income residents.Unger, Serena. Wooten, Heather. A Food Systems Assessment for Oakland, CA: Toward a Sustainable Food Plan. Oakland Mayor‚Äôs Office of Sustainability, University of California, Berkeley, Department of City and Regional Planning. June 21, 2006 Examples include Austin's Double Dollar Incentive Program, Boston's Bounty Bucks, Chicago's LINK Up, Columbia Heights Festibucks in Washington, D.C., Fresh Checks in East Palo Alto, Market Match in Los Angeles, Michigan's Double Up Food Bucks, New York City's Health Bucks, Portland Fresh Exchange, and Seattle Fresh Bucks. These programs often rely in part on nonprofit support. =United Kingdom= Since the first farmers' market was established in the UK in 1997, the number has grown to over 550 nationwide. A number of factors led to the rise of farmers' markets in the UK in the late 1990s, including the increasing knowledge of consumers, the struggles of British farmers, anti-French sentiment, and concerns over food safety and quality. Consumers were worried about the farming practices by which food is produced, processed and the health and safety aspects of certain foods. The emergence of books, magazine articles, and cookery and gardening programmes influence consumer concern of food preparation and consumption. =European Union= The EU has formalized efforts to expand farmers' markets to reduce food safety risks and poor nutrition through programs known as \\"Farm to Fork\\". Farm-to-fork was developed with three main goals within the EU: * To develop effective forms of execution and evaluation of food safety standards * To work internationally with third world countries and organizations that manage food safety concerns * To comply with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) standards of research and its management of science-based research =China= The traditional public markets in Chinese cities are known as \\"wet markets\\" (ËèúÂ∏ÇÂú∫) where most vendors are resellers. The Chinese government has attempted to transform these traditional markets to supermarkets in urban renovation projects. It has led to a decline of these markets in some cities such as Shanghai.Zhang, Qian Forest and Pan, Zi. (2013). The transformation of urban vegetable retail in China: Wet markets, supermarkets and informal markets in Shanghai. Journal of Contemporary Asia, 43(3): 497‚Äì518. Yet, in other cities, wet markets persist and dominate the retail of fresh produce and meat. Because of its critical role in ensuring urban food security, wet markets receive various supports from the local government.Si, Zhenzhong; Scott, Steffanie and McCordic, Cameron. (2018). Wet markets, supermarkets and alternative food sources: consumers‚Äô food access in Nanjing, China Canadian Journal of Development Studies After 2010, farmers' markets in China were reborn in some major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu amidst the food safety crisis. These farmers' markets (ÂÜúÂ§´Â∏ÇÈõÜ) provide venues for local small ecological farmers to sell their produce within the city, catering urban middle-class's growing demand for high quality food. Many of these market vendors are operating community-supported agriculture.Scott, Steffanie; Si, Zhenzhong; Schumilas, Theresa and Chen, Aijuan. (2018). Organic Food and Farming in China: Top-down and Bottom-up Ecological Initiatives New York: Routledge Management A wide range of organizations initiate, organize, and manage farmers' markets, including farmers' groups, community groups, local governments, etc. Some markets are strictly managed, with rules for pricing, quality and vendor selection. Others are much more relaxed in their operations and vendor criteria. While the usual emphasis is on locally grown food products, some farmers' markets allow co-ops and purveyors, or allow farmers to purchase some products to resell. There have been recent reports of fraud and products mislabeled as organic or locally grown when they are not. In some cases, fraudulent farmers' markets sell regular grocery store vegetables, passing them off as organic or locally grown, to which are usually sold to unsuspecting tourists. Some farmers' markets have wholesale operations, sometimes limited to specific days or hours. One such wholesale farmers' market is the South Carolina State Farmers Market, which is a major supplier of watermelons, cantaloupes, and peaches for produce buyers in the north-eastern US. Farmers' markets also may supply buyers from produce stands, restaurants, and garden stores with fresh fruits and vegetables, plants, seedlings and nursery stock, honey, and other agricultural products. Although this is on the decline, in part due to the growth of chain stores that desire national distribution networks and cheap wholesales prices‚Äîprices driven down by the low cost of imported produce. Product categories Meat at a farmers' market in Israel =Pork and beef products= A wide variety of beef and pork products are sold at farmers' markets in the United States. Typical beef products include steaks, ground beef, jerky, and various types of beef sausage. Typical pork products include sausage and bacon. Beef and pork products sold at farmers' market in the US, like those of any other beef/pork product that are sold to the public, must originate from livestock slaughtered in a government (federal or state) inspected slaughterhouse. Since government inspected slaughterhouses purchase livestock for slaughter, many often have the facilities, equipment, and personnel to supply meat products to distributors/wholesalers. Like restaurants, such arrangements are popular with farmers‚Äô market vendors because they allow them to avoid the overhead costs (facility, equipment, knowledge, maintenance, food safety inspections, etc.) associated with producing meat products that may be legally sold to the public. Resell vendors are in the majority at farmers‚Äô markets while vendors that make and package their own meat products represent a very small percentage. Reselling allows vendors to minimize investment and overhead costs by purchasing their products from a commercial slaughterhouse and/or processing plant. Meat products at farmers' markets being sold by resellers will include a \\"distributed by/packed for\\", or similar, statement on the labels of their meat products. Conversely, meat products being sold at farmers' markets that are prepared and packaged by the selling vendor will not include a \\"distributed by/packed for\\", or similar, statement.  Unprocessed meat  Example of Retail cut of beef resold at farmers' markets in the United States Unprocessed meat (retail cut) products found at farmers' markets may include a government inspection legend plus a \\"distributed by/packed for/prepared for\\" label. Other information on the label will include weight, price, and safe handling instructions. The official inspection legend includes an establishment number (EST) that identifies the last company that did the processing/butchering, packaging, and labeling of the product. Since the label includes the \\"distributed by/packed for\\" statement, the meat may come from the livestock of other farmers/ranchers or a corporate feedlot. The presence of a government inspection legend identifies a meat product that was not processed and packed by the selling vendor. Meat products prepared and packed by the selling vendor or butcher will not include a government seal, and will not include any type of statement that classifies the vendor as a reseller/distributor. Retail cut of beef from vendor's livestock sold at farmers' markets in the United States - no \\"distributed by/packed for, etc.\\" statement The labels on retail beef and pork products that originate a vendor's/rancher's livestock will not include the \\"distributed by/packed for/prepared for‚Äù statement. Note that the label will still have an official/government Inspection Legend that identifies the establishment that performed the slaughtering, butchering, packaging, and labeling because any product leaving a slaughterhouse to be sold for human consumption must have a government inspection legend. For example, a label that does not have a \\"distributed by/packed for\\", etc. statement ensures the buyer that, while the vendor did not do the butchering/packaging/etc., the meat did originate from the vendor's livestock. The label on a meat product that is processed and packed by the selling vendor will not include a government inspection legend and it will not include a \\"distributed by/packed for\\" statement. Retail cuts of meat products sold by a vendor that performs its own butchering, packaging, and labeling will not include a government inspection legend or a \\"distributed by/packed for\\" statement on the label. In such cases the vendor/butcher gets the carcass or other major cuts of meat from a government inspected slaughterhouse and does the secondary butchering (\\"fabrication\\"), packaging, and labeling in its own facility. A government official inspection legend is not required on a package of meat butchered and packaged by such a vendor because it is sold directly to the consumer.  Processed meats  Most processed meat products (sausage, bacon, hot dogs, frankfurters, snack sticks) sold at farmers' markets have labels that include a \\"distributed by/packed for/etc.\\" statement as well as a government inspection legend. The government inspection legend includes an establishment number (EST #) that identifies the commercial processing plant that made and packaged the products; similar to a package of sausage or bacon sold in supermarkets. Alternately, a processed meat product sold at a farmers' market that does not include a \\"distributed by/packed for/etc.‚Äù statement and a government inspection legend is a product that is made and packaged by the selling vendor. There are also vendors that sell processed meat products that include a government inspection legend without a \\"distributed by/packed for/etc.‚Äù statement; such vendors are selling co-pack products in which the maker/producer prepares and packages the product according to the vendors‚Äô recipe.http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&blobheader;=application%2Fpdf&blobkey;=id&blobtable;=MungoBlobs&blobwhere;=1251689443031&ssbinary;=true = Reseller = Example - Private Label/Wholesale Processed Meat Product Resold at Farmers' Markets in the United States Wholesale processed meat products that are resold at farmers' markets are known as \\"private label\\" products. Such products will include a \\"distributed by/packed for/etc.‚Äù statement plus a government inspection legend that provides a number that identifies the product's producer. The numbers of critics of private label products are increasing as consumers become aware of poor practices often employed by the products' producers. It is not unusual to find distributors/resellers of processed meat products at farmers' markets because wholesale products allow vendors to minimize their investment by not having to pay for the overhead (knowledge, skills, equipment, supplies, maintenance, food safety inspections, packaging, labeling, etc.) required to produce their own products. A wholesale package of processed meat will bear a label that has a government inspection legend. The inspection legend will usually have an Establishment Number (EST #) that identifies the processing plant that made and packaged the product. Additionally, the package will contain a phrase similar to \\"distributed by: Steve‚Äôs Family Meat Company\\" or \\"packed/prepared for Steve's Family Meat Company‚Äù somewhere on the label. Both the producer (identified by the EST. # in the inspection legend) and distributor/reseller (for example Steve's Family Meat Company) will be identified on the label. Nectarines at a local farmers' market = Independent processor = Example label on processed meat product made by vendor and sold at farmers' markets in the United States - no \\"distributed by/packed for‚Äù, etc. statement A product label of a farmers' market vendor that makes and packages its own product will not include a \\"distributed by/packed for/etc.\\" statement, and it will not have a government inspection legend because its products are sold directly to the consumer. Information on the producing vendor's label will include the following information: * Name of company * Address * Product name * Ingredients * Date code * Safe handling instructions It will not include a government inspection legend or seal. =Produce and fruit= Ideally, farmers' market produce and fruit are normally grown within a geographical region that is deemed local by the market's management. The term \\"local\\" is defined by the farmers' market and usually represents products grown within a given radius measured in miles or kilometers. Many farmers' markets state that they are \\"producer only\\" markets, and that their vendors grow all products sold. Some farmers' markets do not use the term \\"producer only\\" and may allow resellers of produce, fruit, and other food products. Some farmers' markets allow vendors to resell vegetables and fruits if they are not available locally due to the time of the year. Vegetables, fruit, meat, and other products resold at farmers' markets are available to vendors through food distributors. This is a common practice and provides consumers with produce and fruit that are unavailable at certain times of the year. In many markets resell items are a permanent part of the vendor's inventory. There are four subject areas that consumers tend to consider when purchasing food directly from the producer: * Variety name * Whether the product is in-season * Verifiability of the origins of the food * Whether any products have a PLU (price look-up code) sticker Fraud Of late, many shops in farmers markets in USA and Canada have been found to sell fruits and vegetables not sourced from farms. Instead, they are purchased directly from the local wholesalers and then sold at a marked up price, under the guise of local farmers produce. In September 2017, a hidden camera investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation found that while some of the stalls at Toronto's Peterborough farmers markets were genuinely run by local farmers, other stalls in the same market simply purchased produce from the wholesale market and sold it without the original stickers at 50% above the retail prices. Tampa Bay Times food critic and investigative reporter Laura Reiley found that many vendors at local \\"farmers' markets\\" were actually selling rejected produce from local wholesale markets, or selling produce purchased from non-local sources. In some cases they claimed to sell products from their own farm at first, but when pressed admitted that they had grown none of the products for sale. In at least one case despite vendor claims to the contrary the farm in question was not growing any food, and the produce was all purchased from other companies. In many cases fraud is obvious because the type of food being sold does not grow locally or is out of season. Federal regulations in the United States require country of origin labelling for produce at supermarkets but not for small independent vendors. The Tampa Bay Times also found that packaged foods, such as sauces, honey, jam, and beef jerky may appear to be from local vendors due to the local company's branding on the packaging, but are actually produced at co-packer plants with non-local ingredients. In the United States, the FDA requires that the manufacturer's name and address be listed on the food label, which can reveal this discrepancy. Health risks According to a study in the American Journal of Agricultural Economics, farmers markets increase the number of outbreaks and cases of food-borne illness, norovirus, and campylobacter.

A number or alphanumeric string usually identifies the newer commercial varieties. Vendors‚Äô employees might not always know the variety names of the produce they are selling but they will be able to get a list from their employer (producer). There are vendors that violate rules by reselling products at Producer Only markets. =Dairy, poultry, and other products= Depending on the farmers' markets, a wide variety of products are available. Poultry, lamb, goat, eggs, milk, cream, ice cream, butter, cheese, honey, syrup, jams, jellies, sauces, mushrooms, flowers, wool, wine, beer, breads, and pastries are some examples of vendor produced products sold at farmers' markets. Many farmers' markets allow vendors to prepare and sell ready to eat foods and drinks.

Although he failed, this fact helped him become a national idol in Chile. Professional career On March 23, 1973, Vargas made his professional debut, beating Mart√≠n Mu√±oz by a decision in six rounds. He won twelve fights in a row before drawing (tying) with Nelson Mu√±oz on December 13, 1973. In 1974, he tasted defeat for the first time when he was knocked out in seven rounds by Alfredo Alcayaga. On October 11 of that same year, he and Alcayaga had a rematch, this time with the Chilean national flyweight title at stake. Vargas avenged his first defeat with a seven-round knockout win. One month later, he had his first fight abroad, a ten-round draw with Carlos Escalante in Buenos Aires. After fourteen wins in a row, Vargas had a chance to add the South American regional belt to his resume, and he did so by knocking out Gonzalo Cruz in round one on December 20, 1975 in Santiago. He defended that title twice, and after beating Carlos Escalante in their Uruguay rematch, Vargas' win streak reached 27 wins in a row. On September 17, 1977, he fought for the world title for the first time; World Boxing Council world flyweight champion Miguel Canto defeated Vargas by a fifteen-round decision in Yucat√°n, Mexico. Vargas had one more win: two months after their first fight, Vargas once again challenged Canto, this time in Santiago. Canto broke the hearts of most Vargas fans on November 30, 1977 by defeating the hometown favorite, again by a fifteen-round decision. On April 22 of 1978, Vargas beat future world champion Alfonso L√≥pez of Panama by a knockout in round one to defend his South American title with success. On November 4 of that year, he challenged World Boxing Association (WBA) world champion Betulio Gonz√°lez in the champion's hometown of Maracay, Venezuela, but Gonz√°lez retained the crown with a twelfth-round knockout victory. This defeat was followed by thirteen wins in a row, including points wins over future world champions Joey Olivo and Rafael Pedroza (cousin of Eusebio Pedroza). Vargas then traveled to Japan, where on June 1 he lost by a knockout in round eight what turned out to be his last world title bid to WBA world Junior flyweight champion Yoko Gushiken. After the Gushiken fight, Vargas had a rather ordinary record of 21 wins and 7 losses before retiring for the first time in 1987. He did, however, add another regional title to his trophy case when he beat Delis Rojas on July 23, 1982 by a decision in twelve rounds in Miami, to earn the WBC's continental Americas' flyweight title. Having retired, Vargas' legend continued to grow among Chileans, many of whom spoke of the many times Vargas seemed to be close to become Chile's first world boxing champion. He is still seen by many as the best boxer ever to come out of that country, and as a national hero of Chile. In 1997, ten years after his original retirement, Vargas attempted a comeback. His first fight back was videotaped by a crew making a documentary film about him, and he defeated Ger√≥nimo Rojas by a knockout in round two on July 4. On February 7, 1998, he added the Chilean Super Flyweight title to his collection of regional titles with a first-round knockout over Jos√© Carmona. One month later, he beat Juan Lielmil, also by knockout in round one, to regain the Chilean flyweight title. But after losing to Joel Garc√≠a, by knockout in round one on July 31 of that same year, he decided to retire permanently. Vargas had a record of 91 wins, 15 losses and 3 draws, his 62 knockout wins making him a member of the exclusive group of fighters who have won 50 or more fights by knockout. In addition to the documentary about his comeback, a biographical movie about him was also produced in Chile. 1972 Olympic results Below are the results of Mart√≠n Vargas, a Chilean flyweight boxer who competed at the 1972 Munich Olympics: * Round of 64: bye * Round of 32: lost to Calixto Perez (Colombia) on points, 0-5.

Musical life Knussen began composing at about the age of six; an ITV programme about his father's work with the London Symphony Orchestra prompted the commissioning for his first symphony (1966‚Äì1967). Aged 15, Knussen stepped in to conduct his symphony's premi√®re at the Royal Festival Hall, London, on 7 April 1968, after Istv√°n Kert√©sz fell ill.

On 10 October 2003, Ebadi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her significant and pioneering efforts for democracy and human rights, especially women's, children's, and refugee rights.  Early life  She was the first Iranian and the first Muslim woman to receive the prize, and thousands greeted her at the airport when she returned from Paris after receiving the news that she had won the prize. The response to the Award in Iran was mixed‚Äîenthusiastic supporters greeted her at the airport upon her return, the conservative media underplayed it, and then-Iranian President Mohammad Khatami criticized it as political. In 2009, Norway's Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr St√∏re, published a statement reporting that Ebadi's Nobel Peace Prize had been confiscated by Iranian authorities and that \\"This [was] the first time a Nobel Peace Prize ha[d] been confiscated by national authorities.\\" Iran denied the charges. Ebadi lived in Tehran, but she has been in exile in the UK since June 2009 due to the increase in persecution of Iranian citizens who are critical of the current regime. In 2004, she was listed by Forbes magazine as one of the \\"100 most powerful women in the world\\". She is also included in a published list of the \\"100 most influential women of all time.\\" Shirin Ebadi is also one of the 25 leading figures on the Information and Democracy Commission launched by Reporters Without Borders.https://rsf.org/en/dr-shirin-ebadi Life and early career as a judge Ebadi was born in Hamadan, Iran. Her father, Mohammad Ali Ebadi, was the city's chief notary public and a professor of commercial law. Her family moved to Tehran in 1948. She was admitted to the law department of the University of Tehran in 1965 and in 1969, upon graduation, passed the qualification exams to become a judge. After a six-month internship period, she officially became a judge in March 1969. She continued her studies in University of Tehran in the meantime to pursue a doctorate's degree in law in 1971. In 1975, she became the first woman president of the Tehran city court and served until the 1979 Iranian revolution. She was also the first ever woman judge in Iran. As her applications were repeatedly rejected, Ebadi was not able to practice as a lawyer until 1993, while she already had a law office permit. She used this free time to write books and many articles in Iranian periodicals. Ebadi as a lawyer Shirin Ebadi at WSIS press conference By 2004 Ebadi was lecturing law at the University of Tehran while practicing law in Iran. She is a campaigner for strengthening the legal status of children and women, the latter of which played a key role in the May 1997 landslide presidential election of the reformist Mohammad Khatami. As a lawyer, she is known for taking up pro bono cases of dissident figures who have fallen foul of the judiciary. She has represented the family of Dariush Forouhar, a dissident intellectual and politician who was found stabbed to death at his home. His wife, Parvaneh Eskandari, was also killed at the same time. The couple were among several dissidents who died in a spate of grisly murders that terrorized Iran's intellectual community. Suspicion fell on extremist hard-liners determined to put a stop to the more liberal climate fostered by President Khatami, who championed freedom of speech. The murders were found to be committed by a team of the employees of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence, whose head, Saeed Emami, allegedly committed suicide in jail before being brought to court. Ebadi also represented the family of Ezzat Ebrahim-Nejad, who was killed in the Iranian student protests in July 1999. In 2000 Ebadi was accused of manipulating the videotaped confession of Amir Farshad Ebrahimi, a former member of the Ansar-e Hezbollah. Ebrahimi confessed his involvement in attacks made by the organization on the orders of high- level conservative authorities, which have included the killing of Ezzat Ebrahim-Nejad and attacks against members of President Khatami's cabinet. Ebadi claimed that she had only videotaped Amir Farshad Ebrahimi's confessions in order to present them to the court. This case was named \\"Tape makers\\" by hardliners who questioned the credibility of his videotaped deposition as well as his motives. Ebadi and Rohami were sentenced to five years in jail and suspension of their law licenses for sending Ebrahimi's videotaped deposition to President Khatami and the head of the Islamic judiciary. The sentences were later vacated by the Islamic judiciary's supreme court, but they did not forgive Ebarahimi's videotaped confession and sentenced him to 48 months jail, including 16 months in solitary confinement. This case brought increased focus on Iran from human rights groups abroad. Ebadi has also defended various child abuse cases, including the case of Arian Golshani, a child who was abused for years and then beaten to death by her father and stepbrother. This case gained international attention and caused controversy in Iran. Ebadi used this case to highlight Iran's problematic child custody laws, whereby custody of children in divorce is usually given to the father, even in the case of Arian, where her mother had told the court that the father was abusive and had begged for custody of her daughter. Ebadi also handled the case of Leila, a teenage girl who was gang-raped and murdered. Leila's family became homeless trying to cover the costs of the execution of the perpetrators owed to the government, because in the Islamic Republic of Iran, it is the victim's family's responsibility to pay to restore their honor when a girl is raped by paying the government to execute the perpetrator. Ebadi was not able to achieve a victory in this case, but she brought international attention to this problematic law. Ebadi also handled a few cases dealing with bans of periodicals (including the cases of Habibollah Peyman, Abbas Marufi, and Faraj Sarkouhi). She has also established two non-governmental organizations in Iran with western funding, the Society for Protecting the Rights of the Child (SPRC) (1994) and the Defenders of Human Rights Center (DHRC) in 2001. She also helped in the drafting of the original text of a law against physical abuse of children, which was passed by the Iranian parliament in 2002. Female members of Parliament also asked Ebadi to draft a law explaining how a woman's right to divorce her husband is in line with Sharia (Islamic Law). Ebadi presented the bill before the government, but the male members made her leave without considering the bill, according to Ebadi's memoir. Political views In her book Iran Awakening, Ebadi explains her political/religious views on Islam, democracy and gender equality: > In the last 23 years, from the day I was stripped of my judgeship to the > years of doing battle in the revolutionary courts of Tehran, I had repeated > one refrain: an interpretation of Islam that is in harmony with equality and > democracy is an authentic expression of faith. It is not religion that binds > women, but the selective dictates of those who wish them cloistered. That > belief, along with the conviction that change in Iran must come peacefully > and from within, has underpinned my work.\\"Ebadi, Shirin, Iran Awakening: A > Memoir of Revolution and Hope, by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random > House, 2006, p.204 At the same time, Ebadi expresses a nationalist love of Iran and a critical view of the Western world. She opposed the pro-Western Shah, initially supported the Islamic Revolution, and remembers the CIA's 1953 overthrow of prime minister Mohammad Mosaddeq with rage. At a press conference shortly after the Peace Prize announcement, Ebadi herself explicitly rejected foreign interference in the country's affairs: \\"The fight for human rights is conducted in Iran by the Iranian people, and we are against any foreign intervention in Iran.\\"Washington Post: \\"Nobels With a Message\\", last retrieved on 12 October 2007Working for Change: \\"Eyes off the prize \\", last retrieved on 12 October 2007 Subsequently, Ebadi has openly defended the Islamic regime's nuclear development programme: > Aside from being economically justified, it has become a cause of national > pride for an old nation with a glorious history. No Iranian government, > regardless of its ideology or democratic credentials, would dare to stop the > program.The Sydney Morning Herald: \\"Sunnis fear US missteps will bolster > Tehran's influence\\", last retrieved on 12 October 2007 However, in a 2012 interview, Ebadi has stated: > The [Iranian] people want to stop enrichment but the government doesn't > listen. Iran is situated on a fault line and people are scared of a > Fukushima type of situation happening. We want peace, security, and economic > welfare, and we cannot forgo all of our other rights for nuclear energy. The > government claims it is not making a bomb.

Right now, Iran is the country with the > most journalists in prison. This is the price people are paying.Shirin Ebadi > Interview: Iran‚Äôs Voice of Reason on Nuke Talks Daily Beast Ebadi also indirectly expressed her views on the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. In April 2010, Associated Students of the University of California passed a bill calling for the University to Divest itself from what it saw as Israeli war crimes, by breaking ties with companies providing technology to the Israel Defense Forces. Shirin Ebadi, together with three other Peace Prize laureates, supported the bill. Regarding her views on the Shia religion in Iran, she has said, after the Arabs came, and Iran converted to Islam, \\"Eventually we turned to the Shiite sect, which was different from the Arabs, who are Sunni\\" noting Persians were still Muslims but \\"We were Iranian.\\" Since the victory of Hassan Rouhani in the 2013 Iranian presidential election, Shirin Ebadi in various occasions has expressed her worry about the growing human rights violations in her homeland. Ebadi in her Dec. 2013 speech at Human Rights Day seminar at Leiden University angrily said: \\"I will shut up but the problems of Iran will not be solved\\". In light of the increased power of ISIL, Ebadi communicated in April 2015 that she believes the Western world should spend money funding education and an end to corruption rather than fighting with guns and bombs. She reasons that because the Islamic State stems from an ideology based on a \\"wrong interpretation of Islam,\\" physical force will not end ISIS because it will not end its beliefs. In 2018, in an interview with Bloomberg, Ebadi stated her belief that the Islamic Republic has reached a point of which it is now un-reformable. Ebadi called for a referendum on the Islamic Republic. Nobel Peace Prize  On 10 October 2003, Ebadi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts for democracy and human rights, especially for the rights of women and children.Nobelprize.org: The Nobel Peace Prize 2003, last retrieved on 12 October 2007 The selection committee praised her as a \\"courageous person\\" who \\"has never heeded the threat to her own safety\\".bbc.co.uk: Nobel winner's plea to Iran, last retrieved on 12 October 2007 Now she travels abroad lecturing in the West. She is against a policy of forced regime change. The decision of the Nobel committee surprised some observers worldwide. Pope John Paul II had been predicted to win the Peace Prize amid speculation that he was nearing death. Some observers viewed Ebadi's selection as a calculated and political one along the lines of the selection of Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa and Mikhail Gorbachev, among others, for the award. Furthermore, they suggested that Ebadi's activities were not directly related to the goals of the prize as originally expressed by Alfred Nobel. She presented a book entitled Democracy, human rights, and Islam in modern Iran: Psychological, social and cultural perspectives to the Nobel Committee. The volume documents the historical and cultural basis of democracy and human rights from Cyrus and Darius, 2,500 years ago to Mohammad Mossadeq, the Prime Minister of modern Iran who nationalized the oil industry. In Iran, officials of the Islamic Republic were either silent or critical of the selection of Ebadi, calling it a political act by a pro-Western institution and were also critical when Ebadi did not cover her hair at the Nobel award ceremony. IRNA reported it in few lines that the evening newspapers and the Iranian state media waited hours to report the Nobel committee's decision‚Äîand then only as the last item on the radio news update. Reformist officials are said to have \\"generally welcomed the award\\", but \\"come under attack for doing so.\\" Reformist president Mohammad Khatami did not officially congratulate Ms. Ebadi and stated that although the scientific Nobels are important, the Peace Prize is \\"not very important\\" and was awarded to Ebadi on the basis of \\"totally political criteria\\". Vice President Mohammad Ali Abtahi, the only official to initially congratulate Ebadi, defended the president saying \\"abusing the President's words about Ms. Ebadi is tantamount to abusing the prize bestowed on her for political considerations\\". Post-Nobel prize UK Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt meeting Ebadi in London, 3 February 2011 Since receiving the Nobel Prize Ebadi has lectured, taught and received awards in different countries, issued statements and defended people accused of political crimes in Iran. She has traveled to and spoken to audiences in India, the United States, and other countries; released her autobiography in an English translation. With five other Nobel laureates, she created the Nobel Women's Initiative to promote peace, justice and equality for women. =Threats= In April 2008 she told Reuters news agency that Iran's human rights record had regressed in the past two years and agreed to defend Bah√° º√≠s arrested in Iran in May 2008. In April 2008 Ebadi released a statement saying: \\"Threats against my life and security and those of my family, which began some time ago, have intensified,\\" and that the threats warned her against making speeches abroad, and to stop defending Iran's persecuted Bah√° º√≠ community. In August 2008, the IRNA news agency published an article attacking Ebadi's links to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and accused her of seeking support from the West. It also criticized Ebadi for defending homosexuals, appearing without the Islamic headscarf abroad, questioning Islamic punishments, and \\"defending CIA agents.\\" It accused her daughter, Nargess Tavassolian, of conversion to the Bah√° º√≠ faith, a capital offense in the Islamic Republic. However Shirin Ebadi has denied it saying;\\"I am proud to say that my family and I are Shiites,\\" Her daughter believes \\"the government wanted to scare my mother with this scenario.\\" Ebadi believes the attacks are in retaliation for her agreeing to defend the families of the seven Bah√° º√≠s arrested in May. In December 2008, Iranian police shut down the office of a human rights group led by her. Another human rights group, Human Rights Watch, has said it was \\"extremely worried\\" about Ebadi's safety. =Seizure= Ebadi said while in London in late November 2009 that her Nobel Peace Prize medal and diploma had been taken from their bank box alongside her L√©gion d'honneur and a ring she had received from Germany's association of journalists. She said they had been taken by the Revolutionary Court approximately three weeks previously.Iran Confiscates Shirin Ebadi‚Äôs Nobel Peace Medal in Want of Tax Liability Ebadi also said her bank account was frozen by authorities. Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr St√∏re expressed his \\"shock and disbelief\\" at the incident. The Iranian foreign ministry subsequently denied the confiscation, and also criticized Norway for interfering in Iran's affairs. =Post-Nobel Prize timeline= Shirin Ebadi during a lecture ‚Äì organized by University of Amsterdam, 7 November 2011 *2003 November ‚Äì She declared that she would provide legal representation for the family of the murdered Canadian freelance photographer Zahra Kazemi.

This proposal was brought to her from school children in Paris by their Indian teacher Akshay Bakaya. 3 years later Sonia Gandhi and Archbishop Desmond Tutu relayed the idea at the Delhi Satyagraha Convention January 2007, preferring however to propose Gandhi's birthday 2 October. The UN General Assembly on 15 June 2007 adopted 2 October as the International Day of Non-Violence. *2005 Spring ‚Äì Ebadi taught a course on \\"Islam and Human Rights\\" at the University of Arizona's James E.

Six women representing North America and South America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa decided to bring together their experiences in a united effort for peace with justice and equality.

American trade laws include prohibitions on writers from embargoed countries. The law also banned American literary agent Wendy Strothman from working with Ebadi.

An Oxford degree ceremony ‚Äì the Pro-Vice- Chancellor in MA gown and hood, Proctor in official dress and new Doctors of Philosophy in scarlet full dress. Behind them, a bedel, another Doctor and Bachelors of Arts and Medicine. Encaenia Procession: The Chancellor (with trainbearer) immediately followed by the University Proctors and others  When academic dress is worn  An undergraduate student at the University of Oxford in sub fusc for Matriculation in Michaelmas Academic dress is still worn very often in Oxford, and every undergraduate and graduate must obtain a gown, cap, and white bow tie or black tie or black ribbon for the purpose of the University matriculation ceremony, where students formally become members of the University. Regulations regarding gowns differ from college to college, but gowns are commonly worn to: * Formal Hall (formal dinner, which occurs as frequently as every night in some colleges and as rarely as once a term in others, or not at all) * Major public lectures * Chapel * College collections (tests that take place at the start of term) * Head of house's collections (end of term academic progress reports) * College matriculation Gowns and caps are worn to disciplinary hearings in the Proctors' Court. In addition, gowns are worn with cap, hood (for graduates), and subfusc to: * University examinations * University matriculation * Graduation ceremonies * The annual Encaenia (Commemoration) ceremony. On certain occasions, e.g. the Encaenia garden party, by tradition, graduates wear gown and hood without subfusc. The wearing of subfusc remains a popular tradition. In May 2015 students voted overwhelmingly in favour of compulsory academic dress in examinations, with 75.8% supporting subfusc and 78% supporting gowns, in a referendum with an unusually high 40.6% turnout. A previous referendum in 2006 showed 81% support for subfusc.Patrick Foster, 21st-century students vote to keep Oxford tradition, The Times, March 4, 2006. Both referenda were widely interpreted by students as not so much being a vote on making subfusc voluntary, but rather a vote on whether or not to effectively abolish it by default, as it was assumed that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow.See, for instance, this article in the student press . Components of Oxford academic dress After the names of the components, the Groves classification system is given. =Gowns= The gowns in use in Oxford can be divided into two basic shapes. All gowns are open-fronted, except for the Doctors' convocation habit which is closed at the front. Clerical-type gowns * Scholars' gown [u2] * BA gown [b1] * MA gown [m1] * Doctors' full dress gown [d2] * Doctors' convocation habit [d5] * Proctors' dress gown [d2] The clerical-type gown has no collar, but instead has the voluminous material of its back and sleeves gathered into a yoke. All of the above have open bell- shaped sleeves, with the exception of the MA gown and the Doctors' convocation habit. The MA gown has long closed sleeves with arm slits just above the elbow and a crescent-shaped cut at the foot of the sleeve, forming two forward- facing points. The Doctors' convocation habit is sleeveless. Gowns of the same basic shape are worn by barristers (see court dress), preachers and bishops in the Church of England. Lay-type gowns * Commoners' gown [u5] * Graduate students' gown [u5] * Higher faculties bachelors' and masters' laced gown [d4] * Doctors' undress laced gown [d4] * Chancellor's/Vice-Chancellor's gold laced gown [d4] * Bedels', University Verger's, etc. gown [d4] The lay- type gown derives from a garment fashionable in Elizabethan times. It is less voluminous than the clerical-type gown, and has a flap collar and long closed sleeves with arm slits just above the elbow, except for the Commoners' and Graduate students' gowns, whose closed sleeves have evolved into streamers through which the arm does not pass. Gowns of the same basic shape are worn by solicitors, Queen's Counsel, court ushers, the Speaker of the House of Commons, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Lord Chancellor. =Hoods= MA hoods seen from rear. Hoods in Oxford are of three shapes. Doctors (except Doctors of Clinical Psychology and Doctors of Engineering) and Bachelors of Divinity wear hoods in the Oxford full shape [f5], scarlet in the case of doctors and black in the case of Bachelors of Divinity. All other hoods can be either in the Burgon shape [s2] or the Oxford simple shape [s1], though some are traditionally made in one shape or the other. Most of the newer degrees use the Burgon whilst older degrees use either, although the Burgon shape is becoming more popular. Generally, hoods are worn by graduates whenever subfusc is worn, but sometimes they are worn with an ordinary tie, e.g. by the lecturer at a public lecture. =Academic caps= Men wear a mortarboard (also known as a square or trencher cap) [h1], which is not worn indoors, except by the Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor and Proctors. When meeting the Vice- Chancellor, Proctors, or other senior official of the university in the street, it is traditional for a man to touch or raise his cap. In practice few people wear their caps nowadays, and instead carry their caps on occasions where caps are required. Women may choose between the mortarboard or the soft cap [h5]. Originally, women were required to wear their soft caps during university ceremonies. From Michaelmas 1995, they were required to wear the soft cap, but permitted either to wear or to carry the mortarboard. From Hilary 2008, they are now, like men, required to carry their mortarboards when at university ceremonies indoors. Women who opt for the soft cap must still wear, and not carry, them indoors. Doctors in the lay faculties (i.e. those except Divinity and Philosophy) wear Tudor bonnets [h2], which are round and made of velvet. = Subfusc= Oxford undergraduates walking along New College Lane some wearing short commoners' gowns over subfusc suits: this is required wear only for very formal occasions such as examinations, matriculation and graduation Subfusc () comes from the Latin for ‚Äòof a dark/dusky colour‚Äô, and refers to the clothes worn with full academic dress in Oxford. Their origins stem from the formal day dress worn in the past that has, to a certain extent, fossilised around the Edwardian period into what it is now and has changed only slightly since to accommodate modern trends and needs. As of October 2012, the University of Oxford regulations on subfusc have no reference to sex, meaning students identifying as either sex can wear what is historically prescribed as male or female clothing, or, under the letter of the regulations, even a combination (although this is informally discouraged). Previously, men were required to wear: *Dark suit and socks. *Black shoes. *White shirt and collar. *White bow tie. Women were previously required to wear: *White blouse. *Black tie (either a bow tie or velvet ribbon). *Black skirt or trousers. *Black stockings or tights. *Black shoes. *Dark coat (if desired). In addition, doctors in the higher faculties and senior university officials wear bands, such as those worn with legal court dress. Members of the British Armed Forces may wear their service uniform with gown and hood (for graduates) in place of subfusc and cap. There is no formal guidance about what order of dress should worn (i.e. Army No. 1 or Service Dress) or whether swords are worn; however, uniform caps are worn in the street and carried when indoors. Persons in Holy Orders may wear clerical dress instead of subfusc. Subfusc is worn at university matriculation, at university examinations and degree ceremonies and at Encaenia. It is traditional, although not compulsory, that during exams, candidates also wear a carnation: white for the first exam, pink thereafter, and red for the final exam of the run. The one exception to this is found in the law students of Magdalen College, who wear green carnations for all of their Law Moderations. Although this system has differed over time, this is the one currently advised by the University and its Colleges. The carnations are often, although not necessarily, gifted to candidates by friends or members of their college \\"families\\". A number of myths surround subfusc and its use in examinations - for example, that subfusc has a counterpart in 'full fusc', said to be a full suit of armour, which if worn to Finals examinations automatically results in a student being given a First; or the claim that one enterprising undergraduate examined the University statutes prior to an examination and discovered that all students sitting exams in full fusc are entitled to a glass of sherry. He demanded his due in the exam, and the University's Proctors duly responded, before fining him one shilling for failing to wear his sword, allegedly also part of the archaic statutes. This latter story is disputed as untrue, and has been circulating in various forms (sometimes attributed to Cambridge) since at least the late 1950s. =Materials= Although gowns and robes have traditionally been made from stuff, Russell cord or (in the case of members of the higher faculties) silk, most modern gowns and robes are made from synthetic material. Similarly, hoods traditionally made out of silk are now more usually made of synthetic \\"art silk\\". Rabbit fur is also rarely now used in the making of bachelors' hoods, with artificial fur used instead.  Student dress  =Undergraduates= Commoners (i.e. those without a scholarship or exhibition) wear a short black lay-type gown which just covers the suit jacket. The gowns have a flap collar and instead of sleeves have two streamers adorned with folds. These are the remnants of closed sleeves, as can still be seen on the laced gowns of the higher faculties. Scholars (and some exhibitioners) wear a black clerical-type gown down to the knee. The gowns are gathered at the yoke, and have bell sleeves to the elbows (in effect they are shorter versions of the BA gown). For undergraduates, scholars are likely to be students who received a distinction in their first-year examinations, or who have received a scholarship for academic excellence in a specific topic. As a very general approximation, students wearing scholars' gowns may be predicted to achieve a first-class degree on completion of their final examinations. Until the abolition of their statuses in the nineteenth century, gentlemen-commoners and noblemen-commoners each had distinct gowns, generally of coloured silk in the lay shape, decorated with lace. Undergraduates and mortarboards It is often claimed that undergraduates by custom do not wear their caps (or even that they can be fined for doing so). This is incorrect. Outdoors, caps may be worn, but it is customary to touch or raise one's cap as a salute to senior university or college officers. Like all other male members of the university (including graduates) other than the Chancellor, Vice- Chancellor and Proctors, male undergraduates must remove their caps during university ceremonies indoors. It is also only in recent years that female undergraduates have been permitted to remove their mortarboards during university ceremonies. Women who opt for the mortarboard now no longer wear them indoors, but conform with the practice of male members of the university. As mentioned earlier, women who opt for the traditional women's soft cap still do not have this dispensation, and should remain covered at all times. There are instances when male undergraduates are required to wear their mortarboards indoors. Undergraduates appearing before the Proctors' Court are required to present themselves wearing their caps and to salute the Proctors in the customary manner upon entering. They then remove their caps for the remainder of the proceedings. =Postgraduates= Graduate students who do not already have an Oxford degree wear a black lay-type gown that is a full-sized version of the commoner's gown, reaching to the knee. However, they are not worn by graduates of other universities who are reading for the degree of Bachelor of Arts, who wear a commoner's or scholar's gown as appropriate. Nor are they worn by non-members of the University reading for diplomas, who wear no gown, even with sub-fusc. Alternatively, graduate students may wear the academic dress of their old university except at those occasions where \\"foreign\\" academic dress is prohibited, such as the Encaenia and the second half of degree ceremonies when the graduand pays his respects to the Vice-Chancellor in the dress of his new Oxford degree.  Graduate dress  The MA hood. This hood is in Oxford simple-shape [s1] which is rarely used for MA hoods nowadays. = BA and MA = The two most common graduate gowns in Oxford are the Bachelor of Arts (BA) [b1] and Master of Arts (MA) [m1] gowns, which are worn by new graduates of whatever subject. The degree of Master of Arts is granted to BA graduates at a degree ceremony no sooner than 21 terms after matriculation. The BA gown is a long black clerical-type gown with long bell- shaped sleeves to the wrists. The gown is gathered at the yoke. The MA gown is similar to the BA gown, except that the long sleeves are squared and closed at the ends, with a crescent cut out of each sleeve-end, and a horizontal slit just above the elbow for the arm to pass through. The hoods are as follows: * MA ‚Äî black silk edged and lined with crimson / shot crimson silk * BA ‚Äî black silk half lined and bound with white rabbit fur Those with undergraduate master's degrees awarded for certain 4-year courses in the sciences (M.Biochem., M.Chem., M.CompSci., M.EarthSc., M.Eng., M.Math., M.MathCompSci., M.MathPhil., M.Phys., M.PhysPhil.) previously wore BA gowns and hoods, transitioning to the MA gown and hood 21 terms after matriculation, but since 2014 they have worn the laced master's gown with a hood lined in sand fabric. = Doctors = Doctors in Oxford have three forms of academic dress: undress, full dress and convocation dress. The undress gown in the lay faculties is a black lay-type gown with a flap collar and closed sleeves, decorated with black silk lace. The gown may be worn with a doctor's hood, which is scarlet lined with coloured silk: *DD ‚Äì scarlet cloth (full shape) lined with black silk *DCL, DM ‚Äî scarlet cloth (full shape) lined with crimson silk *DLitt, DSc ‚Äî scarlet cloth (full shape) lined with grey silk *DPhil ‚Äî scarlet cloth (full shape) lined with dark blue silk DPhil graduate in Full Academic Dress. The full dress gown is a scarlet clerical-type gown, with open bell-shaped sleeves and gathered at the yoke. The sleeves and facings are in the appropriate coloured silk. Full dress gowns are normally worn with sub-fusc, but never with a hood. The convocation habit or chimere is like a scarlet full-dress gown, except in that it has no sleeves, is fully lined with silk of the appropriate colour, and closed at the front. It is worn over the black undress gown, with the sleeves of the undress gown pulled through the armholes. It is always worn with white tie, bands and hood. A similar garment (in scarlet or black) is worn over a white rochet by bishops in the Church of England e.g. when sitting in the House of Lords. Doctors of Music have no convocation habit, as this degree (as well as that of Bachelor of Music) was open to those who were not members of Convocation. The degree is known to have existed since the early 16th century, and seems to have originally used the same robes as Doctors of Medicine, on the rare occasions when this was necessary. However, since the beginning of the 17th century, Doctors of Music have worn gowns of white or cream damask or brocade, with facings and sleeve-linings of cherry- red silk being present since at least the late 18th century: the latter are shown in a 1792 plate by Charles Grignion the Elder. Today, their full dress gown is made of cream silk brocade with apple blossom embroidery, with cherry silk sleeves and facings. The hood worn with the undress gown is of the same materials: * DMus ‚Äî cream apple blossom silk brocade (full shape) lined with cherry silk. = Bachelors of Divinity = Bachelors of Divinity, unlike their counterparts in the other higher faculties, do not wear the black silk laced gown but wear a black undress gown of the clerical type, identical to the MA gown, but in silk rather than stuff. This is worn with a cassock, cincture and scarf. The hoods are as follows: * BD ‚Äî black corded silk (full shape) lined with black ribbed silk = Bachelors and Masters in the lay higher faculties = Members with postgraduate bachelors or master's degrees in the lay higher faculties (i.e. those other than Divinity or Arts) wear gowns almost identical to the lay doctors' undress gowns (with the exception of the MCh, the gowns of bachelors' and masters' do not have an extra panel of gimp underneath the arms). The hoods of bachelors and masters of the lay higher faculties are as follows: * MCh ‚Äî black silk edged and lined with dark blue silk * BCL, MJur, BM BCh ‚Äî steel blue silk half lined and bound with white rabbit fur * MLitt, MSc ‚Äî light blue silk edged and lined with grey silk * BLitt, BSc (no longer awarded) ‚Äî light blue silk half lined and bound with white rabbit fur * BMus ‚Äî lilac silk half lined and bound with white rabbit fur * MPhil, BPhil ‚Äî dark blue silk edged and lined with white silk The MLitt/MSc hood. The BMus hood was originally of the same colour as the hoods for the other lay higher degrees (BCL, BM).J. Wells (1906), The Oxford Degree Ceremony, Oxford: Clarendon Press, p. 78. = Other doctors', masters' and bachelors' degrees = The newer master's degrees follow with the silk gown of the lay higher faculties, and the following hoods: * MBA ‚Äî claret silk edged and lined with dark grey silk * MSt ‚Äî deep green silk edged and lined with white silk * MEd (no longer awarded) ‚Äî black silk edged and lined with green silk * MTh ‚Äî black silk edged and lined with magenta silk * MFA ‚Äî gold silk edged and lined white silk * MPP ‚Äî dark blue silk edged and lined with silver silk * MEng, and other undergraduate masters (MBiochem, MChem, MCompSci, MEarthSci, MMath, MPhys and current and future equivalent joint-subject degrees) ‚Äî black silk edged and lined with sand silk, The newer bachelor's degrees follow with the stuff gown of the BA, and the following hoods: * BFA ‚Äî black silk with a narrow band of gold silk * BEd (no longer awarded) ‚Äî black silk with a narrow band of green silk * BTh ‚Äî black silk with a narrow band of magenta silk.

University officials  Lord Patten of Barnes in the official gown of the Chancellor of Oxford. John Hood in his old Oxford Vice-Chancellor's undress gown. = The Chancellor = The Chancellor of the University is elected for life by the Convocation (i.e. the alumni with degrees) of the University. He wears on ceremonial occasions a black silk lay-type gown with a long train, decorated with gold lace, similar to the gowns of the Lord Chancellor. The Chancellor's mortarboard has a gold tassel, like that of the former noblemen commoners. In undress he wears the DCL dress or undress gown. In Oxford he always wears white tie and bands though in the past he wore a 'waterfall cravat' with court dress underneath his robes. In 2015, a new robe was made for the Chancellor in light of the original robes being over 100 years old and becoming fragile. This is similar to the new robe of the VC save that the embroidery is on the facings rather than the sleeves. The rest of the robe has the gimp lace pentagons in the usual places.Oxford University Images: The Chancellor's new robes. Retrieved 17 June 2018 = The Vice-Chancellor = Previously Vice-Chancellors had no distinctive dress, but instead wore the black gown, convocation habit and hood if they were doctors or the MA gown and hood if they were not. When John Hood, a non-MA from outside the Congregation of the University, was appointed Vice- Chancellor in 2005, a new lay-type (undress) gown was designed for him, being black with simple gold trimming on the sleeves and flap collar. An official/dress robe was commissioned in 2006. It is a lay-type gown with detachable panels on the lower sleeves of embroidered gold and silver laurel branches growing out of the University shield with the arms of the University's colleges seated on them. The back of the gown has a large University shield similarly trimmed with gold and silver laurel branches.Burgon Notes: February 2008 = Proctors = The two proctors in Oxford are responsible for the discipline of junior members of the university. In addition they have various ceremonial and administrative roles. In Oxford the proctors wear white tie and bands, and a black clerical-type gown of the doctors‚Äô full dress pattern with sleeves and facings of dark blue velvet (formerly black velvet). A hood fully lined with miniver is worn turned inside out so that only the fur is visible. This was formerly the full dress of the M.A. On their undress M.A. gown they have a tippet, or small pouch, sewn to the yoke, which they keep for life. Each Proctor may appoint up to two Pro- Proctors, who may act in their stead throughout their year of office. The Pro- Proctors, when on duty, similarly wear sub-fusc, white tie and bands, and their own gown, which is a black clerical-type gown of the MA shape, with facings of black velvet and a tippet sewn to the yoke. When performing Proctorial roles Pro-Proctors wear the Proctors' hood. In both Oxford and Cambridge the Proctors could formerly be seen patrolling the streets after dark with the university police, or bulldogs, who wore top hats in Cambridge and bowler hats in Oxford. = The Assessor = Previously the Assessor wore an MA gown with a tippet sewn onto the yoke. He or she now wears a Proctor's dress gown with purple instead of blue velvet sleeves. The hood is Burgon or Oxford simple-shape made of unlined white corded silk. = Bedels and the Verger = The university bedels (or mace-bearers) and the University Verger wear plain black lay-type gowns and Tudor bonnets, and white tie and bands. = Members of the Chancellor's Court of Benefactors = Members of the court wear a gown in the shape of Doctor's gown that is deep cherry in colour. There is a line of lace that runs across the collar, down the facings in addition to two lines around the sleeves. They wear a bonnet of deep cherry with a short tassel in the same colour.

More broadly, it describes a culture of power sharing and consensus between Austria's two major parties, the Austrian People's Party (√ñVP) and the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SP√ñ), which developed throughout the period of grand coalition government from 1945 to 1966. During this time, partisan divisions were established in most government institutions and the public service, designed to balance the influence of both parties. Much of the system has been dismantled over time, particularly since the 1990s. While in 1999 all but one of the nine federal states operated Proporz systems, five have since formally abolished them. Some aspects, such as its application on a municipal level, endure to this day. Origins After the re-establishment of Austrian independence in 1945, there was a great desire to avoid to ideological factionalism that characterised the First Austrian Republic (1919‚Äì1934). The divide between the socialists on the left and Catholic conservatives on the right ultimately led to the Austrian Civil War and ensuing Austrofascist dictatorship, which ended after Austria's annexation by Nazi Germany. This was exacerbated by the need for reconstruction in the wake of the Second World War, as well as Austria's precarious position between the Western Allies and Soviet Union. These factors compelled the Austrian authorities to seek consensus and democratic stability in the new republic. All-party or \\"concentration\\" government was practised in both Allied-occupied Germany and Austria after the war ‚Äì the provisional government of Karl Renner comprised a coalition of the √ñVP, SP√ñ, and Communist Party of Austria (KP√ñ) ‚Äì but the development of Proporz truly began after the first national election. The √ñVP under Leopold Figl won an absolute majority of seats, but nonetheless invited the SP√ñ to join the cabinet. Development =Federal level= The federal grand coalition was renewed after every election until 1966. During the ensuing 21 years, an elaborate system was set up throughout the political and public service, in which partisan officials were appointed in an attempt to give approximately equal influence to both the √ñVP and SP√ñ. Within the federal cabinet, state secretaries of one party were typically appointed to ministries controlled by the other. In addition, certain cabinet portfolios were nearly always awarded to one party or the other by convention; examples include the Ministry of Labour for the SP√ñ and the Ministry of Agriculture for the √ñVP. On its own, this is in line with common practice in many countries with coalition government, but the extent to which the parties sought to institutionalise these divisions became synonymous with Proporz. In 1949, Proporz was expanded to include the senior management of nationalized industry. After the success of the right-wing Federation of Independents in the 1949 election, the government sought to limit its influence by applying Proporz at all levels of administration. This included the Austrian \\"social partnership\\", in which workers, farmers, and employers are represented in government by four elected bodies. The SP√ñ headed the Chamber of Labour and Austrian Trade Union Federation, while the √ñVP headed the Austrian Economic Chamber and Chamber of Agriculture. From 1958 onwards, the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF) was headed by four officials ‚Äì two from each party ‚Äì with the √ñVP having responsibility for radio and the SP√ñ for television, which at this stage was in its infancy. After the importance of television became clear, the parties began to wrestle for influence. This was resolved by a secret agreement made during negotiations for the second Gorbach government, in which the parties agreed that every senior position in radio and television be shared between a director from one party and deputy director from the other. After the agreement was leaked to the Kurier, the newspaper began a petition for a referendum to remove political influence over the ORF. The requirement of 200,000 signatures was overwhelmingly exceeded, with 832,353 received between 5 and 12 October 1964. However, the bill for the referendum never made it beyond committee in the National Council because the governing parties, which headed the committees, feared losing influence.Hugo Portisch: The referendum on the reform of broadcasting 1964, in: Haimo Godler (ed.): From steam radio to sound wallpaper: Contributions to 80 years of radio in Austria, B√∂hlau Verlag Vienna, 2004, , pp. 65ff. A bill scrapping the ORF's Proporz arrangement was ultimately passed during the single-party √ñVP government of Josef Klaus in 1966, and came into effect in 1967. Proporz, particularly the concept of consensus government, did not fade after the end of the first period of grand coalition. During the SP√ñ majority governments of Bruno Kreisky in the 1970s and 80s, the √ñVP was frequently consulted regarding government decisions and legislation; as such, the opposition was never truly shut out of decision-making. =State level= Proporz was written into the constitutions of most of the federal states in the 1940s. This particular implementation automatically entitled parties to cabinet positions if they won enough votes in state elections; in essence, proportional representation applied to the cabinet. Until 1999, every state government with the exception of Vorarlberg operated in this manner. This effectively meant that the typical conventions of parliamentary democracy did not apply, as the partisan composition of governments was determined automatically. However, investiture of cabinet ministers, including the Governor, typically required the approval of the state legislature. Initially, this model effectively guaranteed the √ñVP and SP√ñ joint dominance over state governments, as other parties were typically too small to win any more than one cabinet position. However, the rise in popularity of the Freedom Party of Austria (FP√ñ) and The Greens from the 1980s onwards saw the major parties increasingly forced to share their power. This form of Proporz has since been repealed in most states; first in Salzburg and Tyrol in 1999, then Styria and Burgenland in 2015, and Carinthia in 2017. The model in Vienna was also modified, allowing governments to deny portfolios to opposition ministers. The original system only remains in force in Lower Austria and Upper Austria. =Municipal level= Most cities' statutes still provide for Proporz in city council positions, much the same as on the state level. Graz, Linz, Salzburg, and Wiener Neustadt all have such regulations, and thus city councillors from the opposition. Criticism Critics of Proporz characterised it as a form of political patronage and nepotism in which officials were appointed or received benefits on the basis of their party membership. They claimed the long-standing grand coalition fostered complacency and lack of direction in government.Ernst Hanisch: Austrian History 1890-1990 Vienna, 1994 In Conflict and Freedom: Towards a Service Class Society (1972), Ralf Dahrendorf criticised the Proporz system: \\"The conversion of solidarity into individual action entails a withdrawal of energy from the battlefield and marketplace of politics.\\"Ralf Dahrendorf: Conflict and Freedom: Towards a Service Class Society Piper Verlag, Munich, 1972, Sociologist and jurist Gustav Edward Kafka said in 1958 that Proporz had become so entrenched that \\"one could say with good reason that most of the provisions of formal constitutional law, including republican form of government, could be changed without profound consequences, as long as this principle [Proporz] remains in force; yet the return to free political competition would be tantamount to a revolution, though it would not require changing a comma in the constitution.\\"Gustav E. Kafka, Graz: The constitutional position of the parties in the modern state - 2nd report, in: Association of German Criminal Law Teachers: Publications Constitutional Law Teachers 17 2ae - Conference on October 8, 1958 at the university Vienna, p. 89 Legacy During Austria's first annual word of the year selection in 1999, the jury was tasked with choosing a \\"word of the century\\". They were unable to come to a decision, and instead chose Proporz as \\"word of the half- century\\". They stated \\"it has shaped Austrian politics and social life like no other term since 1945\\", and represents \\"the exact opposite dynamic than existed previously in political life\\".

The initiative was approved by California voters on June 6, 1978. It was upheld as constitutional by the United States Supreme Court in the case of Nordlinger v. Hahn, . Proposition 13 is embodied in Article XIII A of the Constitution of the State of California.Full text of Article 13A The most significant portion of the act is the first paragraph, which limits the tax rate for real estate: The proposition decreased property taxes by assessing values at their 1976 value and restricted annual increases of assessed value to an inflation factor, not to exceed 2% per year. It prohibits reassessment of a new base year value except in cases of (a) change in ownership, or (b) completion of new construction. These rules apply equally to all real estate, residential and commercial‚Äîwhether owned by individuals or corporations. The other significant portion of the initiative is that it requires a two-thirds majority in both legislative houses for future increases of any state tax rates or amounts of revenue collected, including income tax rates. It also requires a two-thirds vote majority in local elections for local governments wishing to increase special taxes. (A \\"special tax\\" is a tax devoted specifically to a purpose: e.g. homelessness or road repair; money that does not go into a general fund.) Proposition 13 has been described as California's most famous and influential ballot measure; it received enormous publicity throughout the United States. Passage of the initiative presaged a \\"taxpayer revolt\\" throughout the country that is sometimes thought to have contributed to the election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency during 1980. Yet of 30 anti-tax ballot measures that year, only 13 measures passed. A large contributor to Proposition 13 was the sentiment that older Californians should not be priced out of their homes through high taxes. The proposition has been called the \\"third rail\\" (meaning \\"untouchable subject\\") of California politics, and it is not popular politically for lawmakers to attempt to change it.  Purpose  = Limit the tax rate for properties = Proposition 13 declared property taxes were to be assessed their 1976 value and restricted annual increases of the tax to an inflation factor, not to exceed 2% per year. A reassessment of the property tax can only be made a) when the property ownership changes or b) there is construction done.California Tax Data What is Proposition 13? = State Responsibility = The state has been given the responsibility of distributing the property tax revenues to local agencies. = Voting Requirements State Taxes = In addition to decreasing property taxes and changing the role of the state, Proposition 13 also contained language requiring a two-thirds (2/3) majority in both legislative houses for future increases of any state tax rates or amounts of revenue collected, including income tax rates and sales tax rates. = Voting Requirements Local Taxes = Proposition 13 also requires two-thirds (2/3) voter approval for cities, counties, and special districts to impose special taxes. In Altadena Library District v. Bloodgood, 192 Cal. App. 3d 585 (June 1987), the California Court of Appeal for the Second District determined that the two-thirds (2/3) voter approval requirement for special taxes under Proposition 13 applied to citizens initiatives.  Origins  There are several theories of the origins of Proposition 13. The evidence for or against these accounts varies. =Displacement of retired homeowners= One explanation is that older Californians with fixed incomes had increasing difficulty paying property taxes, which were rising as a result of California's population growth, increasing housing demand, and inflation. Due to severe inflation during the 1970s, reassessments of residential property increased property taxes so much, that some retired people could no longer afford to remain in homes they had purchased long before. An 2006 study published in Law & Society Review supported this explanation, reporting that older voters, homeowners, and voters expecting a tax increase were more likely to vote for Proposition 13. =School funding equalization= Another explanation is Proposition 13 drew its impetus from the 1971 and 1976 California Supreme Court rulings in Serrano v. Priest, which somewhat equalized California school funding by redistributing local property taxes from wealthy to poor school districts. According to this explanation, property owners in affluent districts perceived that the taxes they paid were no longer benefiting their local schools, and chose to cap their taxes. A problem with this explanation is that the Serrano decision and school finance equalization were popular among California voters. While Californians who voted for Proposition 13 were less likely than other voters to support school finance equalization, Proposition 13 supporters were not more likely to oppose the Serrano decision, and on average they were typically supportive of both the Serrano decision and of school finance equalization. =Regressive tax distributions = A 2020 study by Joshua Mound published in the Journal of Policy History challenged the idea that wealthy property owners' desire to cap their property taxes was the impetus for enacting Proposition 13, instead saying the \\"tax revolt\\" was rooted in lower and middle-income Americans' longstanding frustration with unfair and highly regressive tax distributions during the post-World War II decades. The study said pro-growth Kennedy-Johnson ‚ÄúGrowth Liberals‚Äù cut federal income taxes in the highest brackets in the 1960s while local officials raised regressive state and local taxes, creating a \\"pocketbook squeeze\\" that made voters less likely to approve local levies and bonds, which eventually led to the passage of Proposition 13. The study said the tax revolt was not limited to white voters nor associated with rising conservatism associated with the collapse of the \\"New Deal order\\" and the election of Ronald Reagan. =Expansion of state government= Another explanation that has been offered is that spending by California's government had increased dramatically during the years prior to 1978, and voters sought to limit further growth. The evidence supporting this explanation is limited, as there have been no studies relating Californians' views on the size and role of government to their views on Proposition 13. It is true that California's government had grown. Between 1973 and 1977, California state and local government expenditures per $1,000 of personal income were 8.2% higher than the national norm. From 1949 to 1979, public sector employment in California outstripped employment growth in the private sector. By 1978, 14.7% of California's civilian work force were state and local government employees, almost double the proportion of the early 1950s. =Corruption= During the early 1960s, there were several scandals in California involving county assessors.Citrin, J. and Sears, D. Tax Revolt:Something for Nothing in California (1985)Harvard Press These assessors were found rewarding friends and allies with artificially low assessments, with tax bills to match. These scandals led to the passage of Assembly Bill 80 (AB 80) in 1966, which imposed standards to hold assessments to market value. The return to market value in the wake of AB 80 could easily represent a mid- double-digit percentage increase in assessment for many homeowners. As a result, a large number of California homeowners experienced an immediate and drastic rise in valuation, simultaneous with rising tax rates on that assessed value, only to be told that the taxed monies would be redistributed to distant communities. Cynicism about the favoritism of the tax system towards the wealthy and well-connected persisted into the 1970s. The ensuing anger started to form into a backlash against property taxes which coalesced around Howard Jarvis, a former newspaperman and appliance manufacturer, turned taxpayer activist in retirement.  The measure  Howard Jarvis and Paul Gann were the most vocal and visible advocates of Proposition 13. Officially named the \\"People's Initiative to Limit Property Taxation,\\" and known popularly as the \\"Jarvis-Gann Amendment,\\" Proposition 13 was listed on the ballot through the California ballot initiative process, a provision of the California Constitution that allows a proposed law or constitutional amendment to be offered to voters if advocates collect a sufficient number of signatures on a petition. Proposition 13 passed with roughly two-thirds of those who voted in favor and with the participation of around two-thirds of registered voters. After passage, it became article XIII A of the California Constitution. Under Proposition 13, the annual real estate tax on a parcel of property is limited to 1% of its assessed value. This \\"assessed value,\\" may be increased only by a maximum of 2% per year, until and unless the property has a change of ownership. At the time of the change in ownership the low assessed value may be reassessed to complete current market value that will produce a new base year value for the property, but future assessments are likewise restricted to the 2% annual maximum increase of the new base year value. The property may be reassessed under certain conditions other than a change of ownership, such as when additions or new construction occur. The assessed value is also subject to reduction if the market value of the property declines below its assessed value, for example, during a real estate slump. Reductions of property valuation were not provided for by Proposition 13 itself, but were made possible by the passage of Proposition 8 (Senate Constitutional Amendment No. 67) during 1978 that amended Proposition 13. Such a real estate slump and downward reassessments occurred during 2009 when the California State Board of Equalization announced an estimated reduction of property tax base year values due to negative inflation. The property tax in California is an Ad valorem tax meaning that the tax assessed (generally) increases and decreases with the value of the property.  Outcome  250px  Effects  = Reduction in taxes = In the year after Proposition 13 was passed, property tax revenue to local governments declined by roughly 60% statewide. In 2009, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association estimated that Proposition 13 had reduced taxes paid by California taxpayers by an aggregate $528 billion.Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association Other estimates show that Proposition 13 may not have reduced California's overall per-capita tax burden or State spending. The think tank Tax Foundation reported that in 1978, Californians had the third highest tax burden as a proportion of state income (tax-per-capita divided by income-per-capita) of 12.4% ($3,300 tax per capita, inflation adjusted). By 2012, it had fallen slightly to the sixth highest rate, 10.9%, ($4,100 tax per capita, inflation adjusted). California has the highest marginal income and capital gains tax rate and is in the top ten highest corporate tax and sales tax rates nationally. In 2016, California had the 17th-highest per-capita (per-person) property tax revenue in the country at $1,559, up from 31st in 1996. In 2019, WalletHub applied California's statewide effective property tax rate of 0.77% to the state median home market value of $443,400; the annual property taxes of $3,414 on the median home value was the 9th-highest in the United States. = Property tax equity = Proposition 13 sets the assessed value of properties at the time of purchase (known as an acquisition value system), with a possible 2% annual assessment increase. As a result, properties of equal value can have a great amount of variation in their assessed value, even if they are next to each other. The disparity grows when property prices appreciate by more than 2% a year. The Case‚ÄìShiller housing index shows prices in Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco appreciated 170% from 1987 (the start of available data) to 2012 while the 2% cap only allowed a 67% increase in taxes on homes that were not sold during this 26-year period. A 1993 report from the joint University of California and State of California research program, California Policy Seminar (now the California Policy Research Center), said that a property tax system based on acquisition value links property tax liability to ability and willingness to pay and has a progressive impact on the tax structure, based on income. It said that a revenue-neutral Los Angeles County reform which raises all assessments to true market value and lowers the property tax rate would harm elderly and low-income households. The think tank Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) considers property tax caps like Proposition 13 poorly targeted and instead advocates for \\"circuit breaker\\" caps or homestead exemptions to levy property taxes based on ability to pay; yet in 2018, ITEP ranked California's tax code as the most progressive in the United States, in part due to its marginal income and capital gains rates. Since the wealthy usually own more \\"intangible\\" assets like stocks, bonds, or business equity, which are exempt from property taxes, ITEP says regressive state tax distributions that rely on property taxes can worsen inequality. According to ITEP, of all US states in 2018, California's tax code reduced inequality the most. = Tenure of households = By comparing California over the period 1970 to 2000 with other states, (using data from the US Census Bureau, not state or county-level property records) Wasi and White (2005) estimated that Proposition 13 caused homeowners to increase the duration of time spent in a given home by 9% (1.04 years), and renters to increase their tenure by 18% (0.79 years). They also estimated that this effect was more pronounced in the coastal cities, with the increase in tenancy by owner-occupiers in the Bay Area being predicted at 28% (3.0 years), Los Angeles 21% (2.3 years), and Fresno 7% (0.77 years). They speculate that renters may have longer tenure due to less turnover of owner-occupied housing to move into. Other studies have found that increased tenure in renting can be attributed in part to rent control. =Funding volatility= A 2016 report from the California Legislative Analyst's Office found that property tax revenue to local governments was similarly volatile before and after the passage of Proposition 13. While Proposition 13 stabilized the base, governments would adjust the rate annually to counteract changes to the base prior to Proposition 13. = Fiscal impact from new home construction = According to the California Building Industry Association, construction of a median priced house results in a slight positive fiscal impact, as opposed to the position that housing does not \\"pay its own way\\". The trade association argues that this is because new homes are assessed at the value when they are first sold. Additionally, due to the higher cost of new homes, the trade association claims that new residents are more affluent and may provide more sales tax revenues and use less social services of the host community. = Taxes targeted to services = Others argue that the real reason for the claimed negative effects is lack of trust for elected officials to spend the public's money wisely. Business improvement districts are one means by which property owners have chosen to tax themselves for additional government services. Property owners find that these targeted levies are more palatable than general taxes. = Sales disincentives, higher housing costs = Proposition 13 alters the balance of the housing market because it provides disincentives for selling property, in favor of remaining at the current property and modifying or transferring to family members to avoid a new, higher property tax assessment.Mullins, D. R. (2003) Popular processes and the transformation of state and local government finance. In D.L. Sjoquist (Ed.), State and Local Finances Under Pressure, (pp. 95‚Äì162) Northampton, MA: Edward ElharO'Sullivan, Arthur, Terri A. Sexton, and Steven M. Sheffrin, Property Taxes and Tax Revolts: The Legacy of Proposition 13, Cambridge Press, 1995. Paperback reissued 2007 Proposition 13 reduces property tax revenue for municipalities in California. They are forced to rely more on state funding and therefore may lose autonomy and control. The amount of taxes available to the municipality in any given year largely depends on the number of property transfers taking place. Yet since existing property owners have an incentive to remain in their property and not sell, there are fewer property transfers under this type of property tax system. California also has high rates of migrants from other countries and states, which has contributed to more demand for housing, and it has low amounts of moderately priced housing. The different tax treatment can make real estate more valuable to the current owner than to any potential buyer, so selling it often makes no economic sense. = Commercial property owners = Owners of commercial real estate benefited under the original rules of Proposition 13: If a corporation owning commercial property (such as a shopping mall) was sold or merged, but the property stayed technically deeded to the corporation, ownership of the property could effectively have changed without triggering Proposition 13's reassessment provisions. These rules were subsequently changed; under current law, a change of control or ownership of a legal entity causes a reassessment of its real property as well as the real property of entities that it controls. The application to commercial and rental property can lead to an advantage and profit margin for incumbent individuals or corporations who purchased property at a time when prices were low.  Property transfer loophole  Some businesses have exploited a property transfer loophole in Proposition 13 implementing statutes created by the California LegislatureProposition 13 implementing statutes were adopted by the California Legislature and are not part of the actual constitutional provisions of Proposition 13. that define what constitutes a change in property ownership.Chapter 2 of Part 0.5 of Division 1 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. To take advantage of this loophole, businesses only have to make sure that no partnership exceeds the 50% mark in control in order to avoid a reassessment. The Legislature could close this loophole with a 2/3 vote. In 2018, the California Board of Equalization estimated that closing this loophole would raise up to $269 million annually in new tax revenue. There have been several legislative attempts to close the loophole, none of which have been successful. There are also ballot measures that would close the loophole (in conjunction with other changes to Proposition 13), but as of 2019, none have passed. Proponents of split roll have said the intent of Proposition 13 was to protect residential property taxes from spiking and say the broad application of Proposition 13 to commercial property is a loopholehttps://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/commentary/sd-utbg- prop13-taxpayers-loopholes-20170525-story.html?_amp=true while opponents say voters deliberately sought to extend Proposition 13 protections to commercial property by rejecting a split roll promoted by Jerry Brown in 1978 (Proposition 8 on the same ballot), with a vote of 53-47%, and instead voted for Proposition 13 with nearly 65% of the vote.https://www.ocregister.com/2020/07/26/just-so-you-know-theres-no- loophole-in-proposition-13/amp/ A newspaper article published shortly following the passage of Proposition 13 confirms the latter interpretation. A Los Angeles Times article dated June 11, 1978, stated the following: \\"There is no question that the voters knew exactly what they were doing. Indeed, The Los Angeles Times-Channel 2 News Survey, in which almost 2,500 voters filled out questionnaires as they left the polls Tuesday, revealed that Propositions 8 [the split roll alternative] and 13 were seen by most voters as mutually exclusive alternatives, even though it was entirely possible for voters to play it safe by voting for both measures. Among those who voted for Proposition 13, only one in five also voted for Proposition 8, while Proposition 8 was endorsed by fully 91% of those who voted \\"no\\" on Proposition 13. Proposition 13 was advertised as a stronger tax relief measure than Proposition 8. That is exactly how the voters saw it, and that is exactly what they wanted.\\" = Sales and other taxes =  Other taxes created or increased  Local governments in California now use imaginative strategies to maintain or increase revenue due to Proposition 13 and the attendant loss of property tax revenue (which formerly went to cities, counties, and other local agencies). For instance, many California local governments have recently sought voter approval for special taxes such as parcel taxes for public services that used to be paid for entirely or partially from property taxes imposed before Proposition 13 became law. Provision for such taxes was made by the 1982 Community Facilities Act (more commonly known as Mello-Roos). Sales tax rates have also increased from 6% (pre-Proposition 13 level) to 7.25% and higher in some local jurisdictions. In 1991, the Supreme Court of California ruled in Rider v. County of San Diego that a San Diego County sales tax to fund jail and courthouse construction was unconstitutional. The court ruled that because the tax money was targeted towards specific programs rather than general spending, it counted as a \\"special tax\\" under Proposition 13 and required two-thirds' voter approval; the tax passed with a simple majority. The imposition of these special taxes and fees was a target of California Proposition 218 (\\"Right to Vote on Taxes Act\\") which passed in 1996. It constitutionally requires voter approval for local government taxes and some nontax levies such as benefit assessments on real property and certain property-related fees and charges. = Cities and localities =  Greater effect on coastal metropolitan areas than on rest of state  Proposition 13 disproportionately affects coastal metropolitan areas, such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, where housing prices are higher, relative to inland communities with lower housing prices. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, more research would show whether benefits of Proposition 13 outweigh the redistribution of tax base and overall cost in lost tax revenue.  Loss of local government power to state government  Local governments have become more dependent on state funds, which has increased state power over local communities. The state provides \\"block grants\\" to cities to provide services, and bought out some facilities that locally administer state- mandated programs. The Economist argued in 2011 that \\"for all its small government pretensions, Proposition 13 ended up centralizing California's finances, shifting them from local to state government.\\"  Resultant planning changes, cost or degradation of services, new fees  Due to the reduction in revenue generated from property tax, local governments have become more dependent on sales taxes for general revenue funds, which some maintain has resulted in the \\"fiscalization of land use\\". The fiscalization of land use means that land use decisions are influenced by the ability of a new development to generate revenue. Proposition 13 has increased the incentive for local governments to attract new commercial developments such as big box retailers and car dealerships instead of residential housing developments. This is the result of commercial development's ability to generate revenue for the general fund through sales tax and business licenses tax. The jobs and ongoing sales tax those stores provide may discourage growth of other sectors and job types that may provide better opportunities for residents. Office and retail development are further incentivized because they do not cost the local governments as much as residential developments in terms of public services. Additionally, cities have decreased services and increased fees to compensate for the shortfall, with particularly high impact fees levied on developers building new houses or industrial outlets. Impact fees are a way to impose the cost of the additional services and infrastructure that new developments will require. These costs are typically shifted to the building's buyer, who may be unaware of the thousands in fees included with the building's cost. = Education and public services =  Effect on public schools  California's K-12 public schools, which during the 1960s had been ranked nationally as among the best, have deteriorated substantially in many surveys of student achievement. Some have disputed the attribution of the decline to Proposition 13's role in the change to state financing of public schools, because schools financed mostly by property taxes were declared unconstitutional (the variances in funding between lower and higher income areas being deemed to violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution) in Serrano vs. Priest, and Proposition 13 was then passed partially as a result of that case. California's spending per pupil was the same as the national average until about 1985, when it began decreasing, which resulted in another referendum, Proposition 98, that requires a certain percentage of the state's budget to be directed towards public education. Prior to implementation of Proposition 13, the state of California saw significant increases in property tax revenue collection \\"with the share of state and local revenues derived from property taxes increasing from 34% at the turn of the decade to 44% in 1978 (Schwartz 1998).\\" Proposition 13 caused a sharp decrease in state and local tax collection in its first year. One measure of K-12 public school spending is the percentage of personal income that a state spends on education. From a peak of about 4.5% for the nation overall, and 4.0% for California, both peaking in the early 1970s, the nation overall as well as California spent declining percentages on public education in the decade from 1975-1985. For the longer period of 1970-2008, California has always spent a lower percentage than the rest of the nation on education. UCSD Economics professor Julian Betts states: \\"What all this means for spending is that starting around 1978-1979 we saw a sharp reduction in spending on schools. We fell compared to other states dramatically, and we still haven't really caught up to other states.\\" From 1977, in California there has been a steady growth of class sizes compared to the national average, \\"which have been decreasing since 1970.\\" The shortage in funds translated to decreased spending per student in the years following passage of Proposition 13. During the 1970s, school spending per student was almost equal to the national average. Using discount rate, \\"measured in 1997-1998 dollars, California spent about $100 more per capita on its public schools in 1969-1970 than did the rest of the country.\\" Since 1981-1982, California consistently has spent less per student than the rest of the U.S. as demonstrated by data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and by the Public Policy Institute of California This has resulted in increased pupil-to-teacher ratios in K-12 public schools in California. Professor Betts observes that \\"pupil-teacher ratios start to skyrocket in the years immediately after 1978, and a huge gap opens up between pupil-teacher ratios here and in the rest of the country, and we still haven't recovered from that.\\" California's voters approved higher income and capital gains tax rates on the state's wealthiest residents to increase K-12 school funding: Proposition 30 passed in 2012 (and was extended in 2016 with Proposition 55) which raised tax rates on income and capital gains over $250,000 for single filers and $500,000 for joint filers, with most of the resultant revenue going to schools. These measures have significantly closed the K-12 spending gap between California and the national average. Pupil-teacher ratios have decreased since the passage of Proposition 30. California K-12 public school teachers earned the second-highest average salaries amongst teachers of all states in 2019. In addition to the Serrano v. Priest decision, in 2013, California lawmakers created the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF), which provides greater resources to school districts with student populations having higher needs, being determined by the rate of children in poverty or foster care and the rate of English language learners in the district. LCFF has provided an additional 20% or more in \\"supplemental funding\\" to disadvantaged school districts and can make them better funded than school districts receiving the state-required minimum \\"basic aid\\" funding. California has excelled in higher education since the passage of Proposition 13 by some measures; in 2019, there were five California universities in the U.S. News & World Report Best Colleges ranking top 25 and ten in the top 50; most of these ten universities are public.  Popularity  Proposition 13 is consistently popular among California's likely voters, 64% of whom were homeowners as of 2017. A 2018 survey from the Public Policy Institute of California found that 57% of Californians say that Proposition 13 is mostly a good thing, while 23% say it is mostly a bad thing. 65% of likely voters say it has been mostly a good thing, as do: 71% of Republicans, 55% of Democrats, and 61% of independents; 54% of people age 18 to 34, 52% of people age 35 to 54, and 66% of people 55 and older; 65% of homeowners and 50% of renters. The only demographic group for which less than 50% said that Proposition 13 was mostly a good thing was African Americans, at 39%. The survey also found that 40% of Californians, and 50% of likely voters said that Proposition 13's supermajority requirement for new special taxes has had a good effect on local government services provided to residents, while 20% of both Californians and likely voters said it had a bad effect, and the remainder felt it had no effect. At the same time, a majority of both Californians (55%) and likely voters (56%) opposed lowering the supermajority threshold for local special taxes. = Third rail = Proposition 13 is often considered the \\"third rail\\" of California politics, which means that politicians avoid discussions of changing it. In the 2003 California recall election in which Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected governor, his advisor Warren Buffett suggested that Proposition 13 be repealed or changed as a method of balancing the state's budget. Schwarzenegger, believing that such an act would be inadvisable politically and could end his gubernatorial career, said, \\"I told Warren that if he mentions Proposition 13 again he has to do 500 sit-ups.\\" Gavin Newsom, when asked about the fairness of Proposition 13 in a 2010 interview with The Bay Citizen, said: \\"The political realities are such that Democrats, not just Republicans and Independents, are overwhelmingly opposed to making adjustments in terms of the residential side of Prop. 13. On the commercial and industrial side, there seems to be a lot more openness to debate...Of course, it's a difficult time to do that...when you're trying to encourage manufacturing back into your state, and you already have a cost differential between states that border us, you don't want to now increase their burden in terms of property tax on that commercial and industrial space.\\" In 2011, California Governor Jerry Brown was quoted as saying that it wasn't Proposition 13 that was the problem, but \\"It was what the Legislature did after 13, it was what happened after 13 was passed\\" because the legislature reduced local authorities' power. In a later interview in 2014, he lamented that he hadn't built up a \\"war chest\\" with which to campaign for an alternative to Proposition 13. Governor Brown said he'd learned from his failure in the mid-1970s to build a war chest that he could have used to push an alternative to Proposition 13. Governor Brown was definitive that he would not seek to change the law, a third rail in California politics. \\"Prop. 13 is a sacred doctrine that should never be questioned,\\" he said.  Amendments  = 1978 Proposition 8 = Proposition 8 allows for a reassessment of real property values in a declining market. = 1986 Proposition 58 = Proposition 58 allows homeowners to transfer their principal residence to children without a property tax re-assessment, as well as the first $1 million (not indexed to inflation) in assessed value of other real property. It passed with 76% of the vote. Between Proposition 58 and 1996 Proposition 193, which extends Proposition 58 to grandparents, a 2017 report from California's Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO) found that roughly one out of 20 houses statewide received the exemption in the decade ending in 2015, at an average rate of one out of every 200 houses per year. They estimate total foregone yearly property tax revenue for all exemptions ever received at $1.5 billion in 2015, or about 2.5% of total statewide property tax revenue. The report said that while the exemption made it possible for some to live in their parent's house, it likely incentivized the conversion of inherited houses into rental property or other uses. The report said the exemption probably created downward pressure on rents while causing more Californians to be renters rather than homeowners. The LAO report did not provide a modified estimate of foregone tax revenue that considered extra state and federal income tax revenue on inherited rental property conversions. = 1986 Proposition 60 = Proposition 60 allows homeowners over the age of 55 to transfer the assessed value of their present home to a replacement home if the replacement home is located in the same county, is of equal or lesser value, and purchased within 2 years of sale. = 1988 Proposition 90 = Proposition 90 is similar to 1986 Proposition 60 in that it allows homeowners over the age of 55 to transfer the assessed value of their present home to a replacement home if the replacement home is located in a different county, provided the incoming county allows the transfer. = 1996 Proposition 193 = Proposition 193 extended 1986 Proposition 58 by allowing grandparents to transfer to their grandchildren their primary residence and up to $1 million (not indexed to inflation) in other real property without a property tax re- assessment, when both parents of the grandchild are deceased. It passed with 67% of the vote. = 1996 Proposition 218 = Proposition 218, called the \\"Right to Vote on Taxes Act,\\" is an initiative constitutional amendment approved by California voters on November 5, 1996.Prop. 218, ¬ß 1. Proposition 218 was sponsored by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association as a constitutional follow-up to Proposition 13. The proposition established constitutional limits on the ability of local governments to levy benefit assessments on real property and property-related fees and charges such as those for utility services to property.Cal. Const., art. XIII D. The assessment and property-related fee and charge reforms contained in Proposition 218 were in response to California local governments' use of revenue sources that circumvented the two-thirds vote requirement to raise local taxes under Proposition 13.Doerr, David (February 1997). \\"The Genesis of Proposition 218: A History of Local Taxing Authority.\\" Cal-Tax Digest: p. 3. It also requires voter approval before a local government, including a charter city, may impose, increase, or extend any local tax.Cal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 2. It also constitutionally reserves to local voters the right to use the initiative power to reduce or repeal any local tax, assessment, fee or charge, including provision for a significantly reduced petition signature requirement to qualify a measure on the ballot.Cal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 3. = 2000 Proposition 39 = Proposition 39 lowered the required supermajority necessary for voters to impose local school bond acts from two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast to 55%. = 2010 Proposition 26 = Proposition 26 added a constitutional definition of \\"tax\\" for purposes of the two-thirds legislative vote requirement for state taxes under Proposition 13.Cal. Const., art. XIII A, ¬ß 3, subd. (b).  Attempts to change Proposition 13  Since its passage in 1978, there have been many attempts to change Proposition 13 through legislation, legal challenges, and additional ballot measures. In 1992, a legal challenge (Nordlinger v. Hahn) was considered by the United States Supreme Court, which subsequently ruled 8‚Äì1 that Proposition 13 was constitutional. = Legal challenges =  Amador Valley Joint Union High School District v. State Board of Equalization (1978) Amador Valley Joint Union High School District v. State Board of Equalization was a California Supreme Court case in which the aforementioned school district challenged the constitutionality of Proposition 13. In the ruling, the state's high court confirmed that an initiative cannot \\"revise\\" the constitution; Proposition 13, however, was an amendment to the California Constitution and not a revision.  Nordlinger v. Hahn (1992) Stephanie Nordlinger had purchased a property in the Los Angeles area in 1988 and, under the provisions of Proposition 13, was required to have the property reassessed at a new value. The reassessed value of Nordlinger's property raised her tax rates by 36%, while her neighbors continued to pay significantly lower rates on their property. Disheartened by the disparity in taxation, Nordlinger viewed this reassessment as favoritism in the eyes of the law and elected to bring charges up on the Los Angeles County Tax Assessment office and its primary assessor, Kenneth Hahn. Nordlinger subsequently sued the Los Angeles County Tax Assessor Kenneth Hahn on the grounds of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court held, in Nordlinger v. Hahn, that Proposition 13 was constitutional. Justice Harry Blackmun, writing the majority opinion, noted that California had a \\"legitimate interest in local neighborhood preservation, continuity, and stability\\" and that it was acceptable to treat owners who have invested for some time in property differently from new owners. If one objected to the rules, they could choose not to buy.Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1 (1992) Thirty years after purchasing her house, Nordlinger, now a senior citizen on a limited income, paid $3,400 a year in property taxes on the house, which had increased in value to $900,000.  Other legal challenges  In December 2011, Charles E. Young, former University of California, Los Angeles chancellor, brought a lawsuit with a team of lawyers headed by William Norris, a retired federal judge of the United States 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. They unsuccessfully sued to overturn the Proposition 13 requirement that a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the Legislature is required to increase state taxes.Overturning of Prop. 13 sought in lawsuit = Recent attempts to change Proposition 13 =  Legislative attempts to close the property transfer loophole (2014, 2015, 2018, and 2020)  The property transfer loophole was almost closed in 2014 by a bipartisan coalition in the state legislature but the effort died after progressive politicians, organized labor, and community groups refused to support the effort. In 2015 and 2018, Republican efforts to fix this loophole were stalled by Democratic state legislators in legislative committee. Another Republican attempt to close the loophole was made in 2020. Democrat Don Perata, former California senate leader, said this loophole is left open by his party to create justification for ending Proposition 13.  ACA-1 (2019-2020)  Assembly constitutional amendment 1 (ACA-1) would have lowered the two-thirds vote threshold for special taxes, including sales or parcel taxes, to fund subsidized housing or government infrastructure to 55%. The bill was introduced by state assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry. It failed on the assembly floor.  SCA-3 (2019-2020)  Senate constitutional amendment 3 (SCA-3) would alter Proposition 58 by requiring reassessment at full cash value upon transfer of property to a child or grandchild, unless the property is subsequently and continuously used as a primary residence. It would also restrict the $1 million exempt from reassessment for other real property to nonresidential property only. The bill was introduced by state senator Jerry Hill. As of 2020, the bill is in the inactive file.  SCA-5 (2019-2020)  Senate constitutional amendment 5 (SCA-5) would lower the two-thirds vote for local school district parcel taxes to 55%. The bill was introduced by state senators Jerry Hill and Ben Allen. As of 2020, it is in the inactive file.  2018 Proposition 5  Proposition 5 would have extended 1986 California Proposition 60 and 1988 California Proposition 90 by providing property tax savings to all homeowners who are over age 55 (or who meet other qualifications) when they move to a different home. It was sponsored by the California Association of Realtors. California's Legislative Analyst's Office estimated that this would cost local governments about $100 million per year over the first few years, growing to $1 billion per year (in 2018 dollars) over time. It was defeated on November 6, 2018, with approximately 58% of voters not in favor. =Future attempts to change Proposition 13=  2020 California Association of Realtors measure  The California Association of Realtors sponsored another measure similar to their prior initiative, the failed 2018 Proposition 5, that will appear on the November 2020 ballot. This measure would provide reassessment exemptions to all homeowners over the age of 55 moving within the state, for a total of 3 lifetime moves. It would also restrict Proposition 58 and Proposition 193 to solely inherited primary residences, with an exemption cap of $1 million in value at the time of death, and would require the heir to continually live in the residence or face reassessment. Unlike the $1 million exemption in Propositions 58 and 193 that is based on assessed value of property, the $1 million exemption for primary residence reassessment would be based on market value. Any value beyond $1 million would be reassessed at full market rate. Since this amount would not be indexed to inflation, its relative value would decline over time. The entire taxable value of inherited primary residences would furthermore have no 2% cap on assessment growth and instead would be subject to increases in taxable value at market rate. The measure would require reassessment when 90% of a property's ownership effectively changes, closing the property transfer loophole. Local governments could gain tens of millions of dollars in property tax revenue per year, likely growing over time to a few hundred million dollars per year. Local schools could see similar revenue gains. State and local government revenue could increase by tens of millions of dollars per year. Administration costs for county assessor offices could increase by tens of millions of dollars per year.  2020 California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act of 2018  The California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act of 2018California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act of 2018, Section 1. is an initiative constitutional amendment eligible to appear on the November 2020 California statewide ballot that would raise taxes by amending Proposition 13 to require the reassessment of commercial and industrial properties at market value, including commercial and industrial property owned by a natural person. Residential properties are excluded from this potential policy, and would continue to be reassessed under the original requirements of Proposition 13 (when property ownership changes or when new construction is done). Property tax rates would not change, and there would be a qualified exception for some small businesses. This measure will appear on the ballot for the 2020 California elections as Proposition 15. The measure's five largest donors are the California Teachers Association Issues PAC, SEIU California State Council, Chan Zuckerberg Advocacy, the San Francisco Foundation, and the California Federation of Teachers COPE PROP/Ballot Committee.https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_15,_Tax_on_Commercial_and_Industrial_Properties_for_Education_and_Local_Government_Funding_Initiative_(2020) The measure is opposed by a coalition of current and former elected officials, statewide organizations, regional organizations and businesses. According to the California Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO) and the California Assessor's Association, the initiative could potentially generate an additional $6-$10 billion of tax revenue per year, which would go towards additional funding of local governments (60%) and public schools (40%), after reimbursing the State for reductions in personal income tax and corporate tax revenue caused by the deductibility of the property tax under existing law and reimbursing counties for the hiring of up to 900 new assessors statewide at a total cost of $517-$639 million a year. This could therefore entail an additional $2.4-$4 billion a year for California public schools and $3.6-$6 billion a year for local governments.California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act of 2018, Section 3. The LAO also noted that this new property tax revenue would be significantly more volatile than historical property tax revenues. Some supporters of the initiative say most states in the U.S. assess commercial properties at market value, and that this reform would make it easier for local governments to get the necessary funding for their projects. Some in opposition say that local governments can raise money successfully from voters with most local tax increases on the ballot succeeding. Some opponents of the initiative, such as former Board of Equalization member George Runner, argue the initiative would harm consumers and the economy by significantly increasing business owners' operating costs, which would be passed on to customers. Some commentators have noted how the initiative would not provide funding for affordable housing development and would further lower the incentive for governmental approval of needed residential development in favor of more-taxable commercial development (for its attendant sales, payroll, business, and/or property tax revenue). Despite this, pro-housing YIMBY groups in California have supported the split roll campaign. Opponents say the measure targets the large commercial beneficiaries of Proposition 13 which would weaken the political coalition defending the law, invariably leading to a full repeal of Proposition 13. \\"We're next on the menu,\\" said the president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, who also said: \\"California has the highest income tax rate in America, we have the highest sales tax in America, we have the highest gas tax in America.\\" and that \\"Even with Proposition 13 protections, California has higher property taxes than two-thirds of the nation.\\" Some people contend this is a way for state and local governments to pay off their significant unfunded pension liabilities rather than reforming pensions (by capping large payouts and making employees contribute more) that they feel are overly generous and adopted not because of market necessity, but because of unions' political power and bad legislative choices. County assessors say the measure will lead to an unmanageable workload which will result in expenditures exceeding revenues for many years. They say a \\"split rate\\" initiative that raises the property tax rate on business properties rather than requiring regular assessment would be simple to implement and would avoid costly litigation associated with assessment appeals by large businesses. According to polls by the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC), public support for this act has been declining, with 46% supporting the idea in January 2018, down from 60% in January 2012. In November 2019, a PPIC poll found 46% of likely voters favored the initiative, 45% were against it, and 9% were undecided. Citing weak polling, on August 13, 2019, Schools and Communities First (the sponsor of the ballot initiative) announced they were creating a modified initiative for circulation. The new initiative required a higher total signature threshold of around 1 million due to the time of its creation. On May 29, 2020, the new measure qualified to appear on the November 2020 ballot after signature gatherers collected a gross total of 1.7 million voter signatures in support. As of the approval date, the top contributors to the split roll effort were the unions California Teacher's Association ($6 million) and Service Employees International Union ($4 million) while the contributions of Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan were $1.9 million. The new measure would raise $6.5 billion to $11.5 billion a year, depending on the strength of real estate markets, after refunding $500 million to $1 billion of income tax losses and new administrative fees related to the measure. Similar to the prior initiative, 40% of new revenue would be allocated towards K-12 public schools while 60% would be earmarked for local governments. The updated measure would not apply to all residential and agricultural property as well as any commercial property holdings of a common owner with a combined market value under $3 million, while also exempting $500,000 of combined tangible small business personal property and fixtures. The measure is opposed by a coalition of business groups that raised $2.6 million for campaigns against the measure. The California Farm Bureau also opposes the measure.

Nevertheless, the most commonly used types of market risk are: * Equity risk, the risk that stock or stock indices (e.g. Euro Stoxx 50, etc.) prices or their implied volatility will change. * Interest rate risk, the risk that interest rates (e.g. Libor, Euribor, etc.) or their implied volatility will change. * Currency risk, the risk that foreign exchange rates (e.g. EUR/USD, EUR/GBP, etc.) or their implied volatility will change. * Commodity risk, the risk that commodity prices (e.g. corn, crude oil) or their implied volatility will change. * Margining risk results from uncertain future cash outflows due to margin calls covering adverse value changes of a given position. * Shape risk * Holding period risk * Basis risk The capital requirement for market risk is addressed under a revised framework known as \\"Fundamental Review of the Trading Book\\" (FRTB). Risk management All businesses take risks based on two factors: the probability an adverse circumstance will come about and the cost of such adverse circumstance. Risk management is the study of how to control risks and balance the possibility of gains. Measuring the potential loss amount due to market risk As with other forms of risk, the potential loss amount due to market risk may be measured in several ways or conventions. Traditionally, one convention is to use value at risk (VaR). The conventions of using VaR are well established and accepted in the short-term risk management practice. However, VaR contains a number of limiting assumptions that constrain its accuracy. The first assumption is that the composition of the portfolio measured remains unchanged over the specified period. Over short time horizons, this limiting assumption is often regarded as reasonable. However, over longer time horizons, many of the positions in the portfolio may have been changed. The VaR of the unchanged portfolio is no longer relevant. Other problematic issues with VaR is that it is not sub-additive, and therefore not a coherent risk measure. As a result, other suggestions for measuring market risk is conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) that is coherent for general loss distributions, including discrete distributions and is sub- additive. The variance covariance and historical simulation approach to calculating VaR assumes that historical correlations are stable and will not change in the future or breakdown under times of market stress. However these assumptions are inappropriate as during periods of high volatility and market turbulence, historical correlations tend to break down. Intuitively, this is evident during a financial crisis where all industry sectors experience a significant increase in correlations, as opposed to an upward trending market. This phenomenon is also known as asymmetric correlations or asymmetric dependence. Rather than using the historical simulation, Monte-Carlo simulations with well-specified multivariate models are an excellent alternative. For example, to improve the estimation of the variance-covariance matrix, one can generate a forecast of asset distributions via Monte-Carlo simulation based upon the Gaussian copula and well-specified marginals. Allowing the modelling process to allow for empirical characteristics in stock returns such as auto-regression, asymmetric volatility, skewness, and kurtosis is important. Not accounting for these attributes lead to severe estimation error in the correlation and variance-covariance that have negative biases (as much as 70% of the true values). Estimation of VaR or CVaR for large portfolios of assets using the variance-covariance matrix may be inappropriate if the underlying returns distributions exhibit asymmetric dependence. In such scenarios, vine copulas that allow for asymmetric dependence (e.g., Clayton, Rotated Gumbel) across portfolios of assets are most appropriate in the calculation of tail risk using VaR or CVaR. Besides, care has to be taken regarding the intervening cash flow, embedded options, changes in floating rate interest rates of the financial positions in the portfolio. They cannot be ignored if their impact can be large. Regulatory views The Basel Committee set revised minimum capital requirements for market risk in January 2016. These revisions, the \\"Fundamental Review of the Trading Book\\", address deficiencies relating to the existing Internal models and Standardised approach for the calculation of market-risk capital, and in particular discuss the following: * Boundary between the \\"Trading book\\" and the \\"Banking book\\" * Use of value at risk vs. expected shortfall to measure of risk under stress * The risk of market illiquidity Use in annual reports of U.S. corporations In the United States, a section on market risk is mandated by the SECFAQ on the United States SEC Market Disclosure Rules in all annual reports submitted on Form 10-K. The company must detail how its results may depend directly on financial markets. This is designed to show, for example, an investor who believes he is investing in a normal milk company, that the company is also carrying out non-dairy activities such as investing in complex derivatives or foreign exchange futures.

The taxonomy of the towhees has been debated in recent decades, and until 1995 this bird and the eastern towhee were considered a single species, the rufous- sided towhee. Literature before 1995 referred to the spotted towhee as a rufous-sided towhee that resides in the western United States. An archaic name for the spotted towhee is the Oregon towhee (Pipilo maculatus oregonus). The call may be harsher and more varied than for the eastern towhee. The form that breeds on Socorro Island is much smaller than other rufous-sided towhees, and has gray upperparts. It is sometimes split as the Socorro towhee (Pipilo socorroensis). Description Female in left The spotted towhee is a large New World sparrow, roughly the same size as a Robin. It has a long, dark fan shaped tail with white corners on the end. They have a round body (similar to New World sparrows) with bright red eyes and dull pink legs. The spotted towhee is between and long, and weighs in at between and . The spotted towhee has a wingspan of 11.0 in (28 cm). Adult males have a generally darker head, upper body and tail with a white belly, rufous sides, white spots on their back and white wing bars. Females look similar but are dark brown and grey instead of black. The spotted towhee has white spots on its primary and secondary feathers; the Eastern towhee is the same bird in terms of its size and structure but does not have white spots. Distribution and habitat The spotted towhee lives in dry upland forests and breeds across north-western North America. It is present in California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Oregon, Washington, and southern British Columbia year round. It is not found in arid climates and as a result does not reside in the Sonoran Desert, but resides in northern Arizona and the entirety of California except the southeast corner that borders Arizona. It has also been known to expand as far eastward as western Iowa and southwestern Minnesota. They also occur in fringe wetland forests and riparian forests near the border of upland forests. Because spotted towhees' habitat overlaps with areas of the United States that experience regular forest fires (Arizona, New Mexico, California), they tend to be found in unburned chaparral and avoid chaparral and forests which have been burned due to lack of ground cover and minimal foraging ability. Spotted towhees will be present in an area that is recovering after a burn (less than 15 years old), due to excellent ground cover and ease of ground foraging from the recovering understory vegetation, although populations will decrease after a forest fire until the vegetation has grown back. Its breeding habitat in the southwest is largely dependent on Coastal sage scrub, as it provides cover from predators. They migrate to northern and northwestern United States and southwestern Canada to breed in scrubland, parks and suburban gardens. On the coast, it is much more common in the Coastal Douglas-fir present in Wyoming, Montana Idaho and British Columbia. Northwestern birds migrate eastwards to the central plains of the United States, mostly the northwestern-central Great Plains. In other areas, some birds may move to lower elevations in the winter. Their breeding habitat is chaparral, thickets or shrubby areas across western North America. This bird interbreeds with the collared towhee where their ranges overlap in southwestern Mexico. Behavior =Breeding and nesting= Spotted towhees forage on the ground or in low vegetation. They nest either on the ground or low in bushes, seldom more than above the ground and most nests are around above the ground. The location for the nests is usually found in exposed areas, but conceal the nest as it is being built. The female builds the nest over a period of about five days. It is bulky and sturdily made of leaves, strips of bark, twigs, forb stalks, and grasses, lined with pine needles, shredded bark, grass, and sometimes hair. It is usually in diameter with an inner ring of to . The nests are built so the rim is at ground level and the nest is deep. At least two broods, consisting of three to five eggs, are laid per season. The egg shells are grayish or creamy-white, sometimes with a tinge of green, with reddish brown spots that can form a wreath or cap. The eggs are slightly oblong, with their dimensions being to long and to wide. The female incubates the eggs alone for 12 to 14 days; the young leave the nest at 10 to 12 days. Nests are parasitized by cowbirds. =Diet= These birds forage on the ground or in low vegetation, with a habit of noisily rummaging through dry leaves searching for food. During the breeding season (spring and summer) they mainly eat insects, ground dwelling beetles, spiders and other arthropods that reside in the leaf litter that is foraged by the spotted towhee. They only eat protein rich food in the breeding season, and in the fall and winter they focus on foraging for acorns, seeds oats and berries. They will frequent bird feeders if present in their woodland habitat. =Threats= Their main predators in less developed areas are ground dwelling snakes because nests are built on the ground. There is a strong relationship between the number of snakes that a nest encounters and the lowered probability of young chicks fledgling. In developed areas and habitat near urban development their main predators are household cats.

A hedge can be constructed from many types of financial instruments, including stocks, exchange-traded funds, insurance, forward contracts, swaps, options, gambles, many types of over-the-counter and derivative products, and futures contracts. Public futures markets were established in the 19th century to allow transparent, standardized, and efficient hedging of agricultural commodity prices; they have since expanded to include futures contracts for hedging the values of energy, precious metals, foreign currency, and interest rate fluctuations. Etymology Hedging is the practice of taking a position in one market to offset and balance against the risk adopted by assuming a position in a contrary or opposing market or investment. The word hedge is from Old English hecg, originally any fence, living or artificial. The use of the word as a verb in the sense of \\"dodge, evade\\" is first recorded in the 1590s; that of insure oneself against loss, as in a bet, is from the 1670s. Examples =Agricultural commodity price hedging= A typical hedger might be a commercial farmer. The market values of wheat and other crops fluctuate constantly as supply and demand for them vary, with occasional large moves in either direction. Based on current prices and forecast levels at harvest time, the farmer might decide that planting wheat is a good idea one season, but the price of wheat might change over time. Once the farmer plants wheat, he is committed to it for an entire growing season. If the actual price of wheat rises greatly between planting and harvest, the farmer stands to make a lot of unexpected money, but if the actual price drops by harvest time, he is going to lose the invested money. Due to the uncertainty of future supply and demand fluctuations, and the price risk imposed on the farmer, the farmer in this example may use different financial transactions to reduce, or hedge, their risk. One such transaction is the use of forward contracts. Forward contracts are mutual agreements to deliver a certain amount of a commodity at a certain date for a specified price and each contract is unique to the buyer and seller. For this example, the farmer can sell a number of forward contracts equivalent to the amount of wheat he expects to harvest and essentially lock in the current price of wheat. Once the forward contracts expire, the farmer will harvest the wheat and deliver it to the buyer at the price agreed to in the forward contract. Therefore, the farmer has reduced his risks to fluctuations in the market of wheat because he has already guaranteed a certain number of bushels for a certain price. However, there are still many risks associated with this type of hedge. For example, if the farmer has a low yield year and he harvests less than the amount specified in the forward contracts, he must purchase the bushels elsewhere in order to fill the contract. This becomes even more of a problem when the lower yields affect the entire wheat industry and the price of wheat increases due to supply and demand pressures. Also, while the farmer hedged all of the risks of a price decrease away by locking in the price with a forward contract, he also gives up the right to the benefits of a price increase. Another risk associated with the forward contract is the risk of default or renegotiation. The forward contract locks in a certain amount and price at a certain future date. Because of that, there is always the possibility that the buyer will not pay the amount required at the end of the contract or that the buyer will try to renegotiate the contract before it expires. Future contracts are another way our farmer can hedge his risk without a few of the risks that forward contracts have. Future contracts are similar to forward contracts except they are more standardized (i.e. each contract is the same quantity and date for everyone). These contracts trade on exchanges and are guaranteed through clearinghouses. Clearinghouses ensure that every contract is honored and they take the opposite side of every contract. Future contracts typically are more liquid than forward contracts and move with the market. Because of this, the farmer can minimize the risk he faces in the future through the selling of future contracts. Future contracts also differ from forward contracts in that delivery never happens. The exchanges and clearinghouses allow the buyer or seller to leave the contract early and cash out. So tying back into the farmer selling his wheat at a future date, he will sell short futures contracts for the amount that he predicts to harvest to protect against a price decrease. The current (spot) price of wheat and the price of the futures contracts for wheat converge as time gets closer to the delivery date, so in order to make money on the hedge, the farmer must close out his position earlier than then. On the chance that prices decrease in the future, the farmer will make a profit on his short position in the futures market which offsets any decrease in revenues from the spot market for wheat. On the other hand, if prices increase, the farmer will generate a loss on the futures market which is offset by an increase in revenues on the spot market for wheat. Instead of agreeing to sell his wheat to one person on a set date, the farmer will just buy and sell futures on an exchange and then sell his wheat wherever he wants once he harvests it. =Hedging a stock price= A common hedging technique used in the financial industry is the long/short equity technique. A stock trader believes that the stock price of Company A will rise over the next month, due to the company's new and efficient method of producing widgets. He wants to buy Company A shares to profit from their expected price increase, as he believes that shares are currently underpriced. But Company A is part of a highly volatile widget industry. So there is a risk of a future event that affects stock prices across the whole industry, including the stock of Company A along with all other companies. Since the trader is interested in the specific company, rather than the entire industry, he wants to hedge out the industry-related risk by short selling an equal value of shares from Company A's direct, yet weaker competitor, Company B. The first day the trader's portfolio is: * Long 1,000 shares of Company A at $1 each * Short 500 shares of Company B at $2 each The trader has sold short the same value of shares (the value, number of shares √ó price, is $1000 in both cases). If the trader was able to short sell an asset whose price had a mathematically defined relation with Company A's stock price (for example a put option on Company A shares), the trade might be essentially riskless. In this case, the risk would be limited to the put option's premium. On the second day, a favorable news story about the widgets industry is published and the value of all widgets stock goes up. Company A, however, because it is a stronger company, increases by 10%, while Company B increases by just 5%: * Long 1,000 shares of Company A at $1.10 each: $100 gain * Short 500 shares of Company B at $2.10 each: $50 loss (in a short position, the investor loses money when the price goes up) The trader might regret the hedge on day two, since it reduced the profits on the Company A position. But on the third day, an unfavorable news story is published about the health effects of widgets, and all widgets stocks crash: 50% is wiped off the value of the widgets industry in the course of a few hours. Nevertheless, since Company A is the better company, it suffers less than Company B: Value of long position (Company A): * Day 1: $1,000 * Day 2: $1,100 * Day 3: $550 => ($1,000 ‚àí $550) = $450 loss Value of short position (Company B): * Day 1: ‚àí$1,000 * Day 2: ‚àí$1,050 * Day 3: ‚àí$525 => ($1,000 ‚àí $525) = $475 profit Without the hedge, the trader would have lost $450. But the hedge ‚Äì the short sale of Company B ‚Äì nets a profit of $25 during a dramatic market collapse. =Stock/futures hedging= The introduction of stock market index futures has provided a second means of hedging risk on a single stock by selling short the market, as opposed to another single or selection of stocks. Futures are generally highly fungible and cover a wide variety of potential investments, which makes them easier to use than trying to find another stock which somehow represents the opposite of a selected investment. Futures hedging is widely used as part of the traditional long/short play. =Hedging employee stock options= Employee stock options (ESOs) are securities issued by the company mainly to its own executives and employees. These securities are more volatile than stocks. An efficient way to lower the ESO risk is to sell exchange traded calls and, to a lesser degree, to buy puts. Companies discourage hedging the ESOs but there is no prohibition against it. =Hedging fuel consumption= 443x443px Airlines use futures contracts and derivatives to hedge their exposure to the price of jet fuel. They know that they must purchase jet fuel for as long as they want to stay in business, and fuel prices are notoriously volatile. By using crude oil futures contracts to hedge their fuel requirements (and engaging in similar but more complex derivatives transactions), Southwest Airlines was able to save a large amount of money when buying fuel as compared to rival airlines when fuel prices in the U.S. rose dramatically after the 2003 Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina. =Hedging emotions= As an emotion regulation strategy, people can bet against a desired outcome. A New England Patriots fan, for example, could bet their opponents to win to reduce the negative emotions felt if the team loses a game. People typically do not bet against desired outcomes that are important to their identity, due to negative signal about their identity that making such a gamble entails. Betting against your team or political candidate, for example, may signal to you that you are not as committed to them as you thought you were. Types of hedging Hedging can be used in many different ways including foreign exchange trading. The stock example above is a \\"classic\\" sort of hedge, known in the industry as a pairs trade due to the trading on a pair of related securities. As investors became more sophisticated, along with the mathematical tools used to calculate values (known as models), the types of hedges have increased greatly. Examples of hedging include: * Forward exchange contract for currencies * Currency future contracts * Money Market Operations for currencies * Forward Exchange Contract for interest * Money Market Operations for interest * Future contracts for interest * Covered Calls on equities * Short Straddles on equities or indexes * Bets on elections or sporting events Hedging strategies Tracker hedging. The fraction of open positions has to be within the (grey-blue) hedging corridor at every instance of time. A hedging strategy usually refers to the general risk management policy of a financially and physically trading firm how to minimize their risks. As the term hedging indicates, this risk mitigation is usually done by using financial instruments, but a hedging strategy as used by commodity traders like large energy companies, is usually referring to a business model (including both financial and physical deals). In order to show the difference between these strategies, consider the fictional company BlackIsGreen Ltd trading coal by buying this commodity at the wholesale market and selling it to households mostly in winter. =Back- to-back hedging= Back-to-back (B2B) is a strategy where any open position is immediately closed, e.g. by buying the respective commodity on the spot market. This technique is often applied in the commodity market when the customers‚Äô price is directly calculable from visible forward energy prices at the point of customer sign-up. If BlackIsGreen decides to have a B2B-strategy, they would buy the exact amount of coal at the very moment when the household customer comes into their shop and signs the contract. This strategy minimizes many commodity risks, but has the drawback that it has a large volume and liquidity risk, as BlackIsGreen does not know whether it can find enough coal on the wholesale market to fulfill the need of the households. =Tracker hedging= Tracker hedging is a pre-purchase approach, where the open position is decreased the closer the maturity date comes. If BlackIsGreen knows that most of the consumers demand coal in winter to heat their house, a strategy driven by a tracker would now mean that BlackIsGreen buys e.g. half of the expected coal volume in summer, another quarter in autumn and the remaining volume in winter. The closer the winter comes, the better are the weather forecasts and therefore the estimate, how much coal will be demanded by the households in the coming winter. Retail customers‚Äô price will be influenced by long-term wholesale price trends. A certain hedging corridor around the pre- defined tracker-curve is allowed and fraction of the open positions decreases as the maturity date comes closer. =Delta hedging= Delta-hedging mitigates the financial risk of an option by hedging against price changes in its underlying. It is called like that as Delta is the first derivative of the option's value with respect to the underlying instrument's price. This is performed in practice by buying a derivative with an inverse price movement. It is also a type of market neutral strategy. Only if BlackIsGreen chooses to perform delta-hedging as strategy, actual financial instruments come into play for hedging (in the usual, stricter meaning). =Risk reversal= Risk reversal means simultaneously buying a call option and selling a put option. This has the effect of simulating being long on a stock or commodity position. Natural hedges Many hedges do not involve exotic financial instruments or derivatives such as the married put. A natural hedge is an investment that reduces the undesired risk by matching cash flows (i.e. revenues and expenses). For example, an exporter to the United States faces a risk of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar and chooses to open a production facility in that market to match its expected sales revenue to its cost structure. Another example is a company that opens a subsidiary in another country and borrows in the foreign currency to finance its operations, even though the foreign interest rate may be more expensive than in its home country: by matching the debt payments to expected revenues in the foreign currency, the parent company has reduced its foreign currency exposure. Similarly, an oil producer may expect to receive its revenues in U.S. dollars, but faces costs in a different currency; it would be applying a natural hedge if it agreed to, for example, pay bonuses to employees in U.S. dollars. One common means of hedging against risk is the purchase of insurance to protect against financial loss due to accidental property damage or loss, personal injury, or loss of life. Categories of hedgeable risk There are varying types of financial risk that can be protected against with a hedge. Those types of risks include: * Commodity risk: the risk that arises from potential movements in the value of commodity contracts, which include agricultural products, metals, and energy products. * Credit risk: the risk that money owing will not be paid by an obligor. Since credit risk is the natural business of banks, but an unwanted risk for commercial traders, an early market developed between banks and traders that involved selling obligations at a discounted rate. * Currency risk (also known as Foreign Exchange Risk hedging) is used both by financial investors to deflect the risks they encounter when investing abroad and by non-financial actors in the global economy for whom multi-currency activities are a necessary evil rather than a desired state of exposure. * Interest rate risk: the risk that the relative value of an interest-bearing liability, such as a loan or a bond, will worsen due to an interest rate increase. Interest rate risks can be hedged using fixed-income instruments or interest rate swaps. * Equity risk: the risk that one's investments will depreciate because of stock market dynamics causing one to lose money. * Volatility risk: is the threat that an exchange rate movement poses to an investor's portfolio in a foreign currency. * Volume risk is the risk that a customer demands more or less of a product than expected. Hedging equity and equity futures Equity in a portfolio can be hedged by taking an opposite position in futures. To protect your stock picking against systematic market risk, futures are shorted when equity is purchased, or long futures when stock is shorted. One way to hedge is the market neutral approach. In this approach, an equivalent dollar amount in the stock trade is taken in futures ‚Äì for example, by buying 10,000 GBP worth of Vodafone and shorting 10,000 worth of FTSE futures (the index in which Vodafone trades). Another way to hedge is the beta neutral. Beta is the historical correlation between a stock and an index. If the beta of a Vodafone stock is 2, then for a 10,000 GBP long position in Vodafone an investor would hedge with a 20,000 GBP equivalent short position in the FTSE futures. Futures contracts and forward contracts are means of hedging against the risk of adverse market movements. These originally developed out of commodity markets in the 19th century, but over the last fifty years a large global market developed in products to hedge financial market risk. =Futures hedging= Investors who primarily trade in futures may hedge their futures against synthetic futures. A synthetic in this case is a synthetic future comprising a call and a put position. Long synthetic futures means long call and short put at the same expiry price. To hedge against a long futures trade a short position in synthetics can be established, and vice versa. Stack hedging is a strategy which involves buying various futures contracts that are concentrated in nearby delivery months to increase the liquidity position. It is generally used by investors to ensure the surety of their earnings for a longer period of time. =Contract for difference= A contract for difference (CFD) is a two-way hedge or swap contract that allows the seller and purchaser to fix the price of a volatile commodity. Consider a deal between an electricity producer and an electricity retailer, both of whom trade through an electricity market pool. If the producer and the retailer agree to a strike price of $50 per MWh, for 1 MWh in a trading period, and if the actual pool price is $70, then the producer gets $70 from the pool but has to rebate $20 (the \\"difference\\" between the strike price and the pool price) to the retailer. Conversely, the retailer pays the difference to the producer if the pool price is lower than the agreed upon contractual strike price. In effect, the pool volatility is nullified and the parties pay and receive $50 per MWh. However, the party who pays the difference is \\"out of the money\\" because without the hedge they would have received the benefit of the pool price. Related concepts * Forwards: A contract specifying future delivery of an amount of an item, at a price decided now. The delivery is obligatory, not optional. * Forward rate agreement (FRA): A contract specifying an interest rate amount to be settled at a pre-determined interest rate on the date of the contract. * Option (finance): similar to a forward contract, but optional. ** Call option: A contract that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy an item in the future, at a price decided now. ** Put option: A contract that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell an item in the future, at a price decided now. * Non-deliverable forwards (NDF): A strictly risk-transfer financial product similar to a forward rate agreement, but used only where monetary policy restrictions on the currency in question limit the free flow and conversion of capital. As the name suggests, NDFs are not delivered but settled in a reference currency, usually USD or EUR, where the parties exchange the gain or loss that the NDF instrument yields, and if the buyer of the controlled currency truly needs that hard currency, he can take the reference payout and go to the government in question and convert the USD or EUR payout. The insurance effect is the same; it's just that the supply of insured currency is restricted and controlled by government. See capital control. * Interest rate parity and Covered interest arbitrage: The simple concept that two similar investments in two different currencies ought to yield the same return. If the two similar investments are not at face value offering the same interest rate return, the difference should conceptually be made up by changes in the exchange rate over the life of the investment. IRP basically provides the math to calculate a projected or implied forward rate of exchange. This calculated rate is not and cannot be considered a prediction or forecast, but rather is the arbitrage-free calculation for what the exchange rate is implied to be in order for it to be impossible to make a free profit by converting money to one currency, investing it for a period, then converting back and making more money than if a person had invested in the same opportunity in the original currency. * Hedge fund: A fund which may engage in hedged transactions or hedged investment strategies.

This bird is common across much of temperate North America and in summer ranges far into the Arctic. It is a very variable species, much like the related fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca), and its systematics are still not completely untangled. Description slate-colored dark-eyed junco (J. h. hyemalis) Adults generally have gray heads, necks, and breasts, gray or brown backs and wings, and a white belly, but show a confusing amount of variation in plumage details. The white outer tail feathers flash distinctively in flight and while hopping on the ground. The bill is usually pale pinkish. Males tend to have darker, more conspicuous markings than the females.

Juveniles often have pale streaks and may even be mistaken for vesper sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus) until they acquire adult plumage at 2 to 3 months, but junco fledglings' heads are generally quite uniform in color already, and initially their bills still have conspicuous yellowish edges to the gape, remains of the fleshy wattles that guide the parents when they feed the nestlings. The song is a trill similar to the chipping sparrow's (Spizella passerina), except that the red-backed dark- eyed junco's (see below) song is more complex, similar to that of the yellow- eyed junco (Junco phaeonotus). The call also resembles that of the black- throated blue warbler's, which is a member of the New World warbler family.Calls include tick sounds and very high-pitched tinkling chips.It is known among bird language practitioners as an excellent bird to study for learning \\"bird language.\\" A sample of the song can be heard at the USGS web site here (MP3) or at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology web site here. Taxonomy The dark-eyed junco was described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae as Fringilla hyemalis. The description consisted merely of the laconic remark \\"F[ringilla] nigra, ventre albo. (\\"A black 'finch' with white belly\\"), a reference to a source, and a statement that it came from America. Linnaeus' source was Mark Catesby who described the slate-colored dark-eyed junco before binomial nomenclature as his \\"snow-bird\\", moineau de neige or passer nivalis (\\"snow sparrow\\") thus: > The Bill of this Bird is white: The Breast and Belly white. All the rest of > the Body black; but in some places dusky, inclining to Lead-color. In > Virginia and Carolina they appear only in Winter: and in Snow they appear > most. In Summer none are seen. Whether they retire and breed in the North > (which is most probable) or where they go, when they leave these Countries > in Spring, is to me unknown. [italics in original] The slate-colored dark-eyed junco is unmistakable enough to make it readily recognizable even from Linnaeus' minimal description. Junco is the Spanish word for rush, from the Latin word juncus. Its modern scientific name means \\"winter junco\\", from the Latin word ' \\"of the winter\\". Subspecies The several subspecies make up two large or polytypic groups and three to four small or monotypic ones. The six basic groups were formerly considered separate species (and the Guadalupe junco frequently still is), but they interbreed extensively in areas of contact. Birders trying to identify subspecies are advised to consult detailed identification references. =Slate-colored group= Male and female Junco hyemalis * slate-colored dark- eyed junco (J. h. hyemalis) * Carolina dark-eyed junco (J. h. carolinensis) * Cassiar dark-eyed junco (J. h. cismontanus; possibly a slate-colored dark-eyed junco x Oregon dark-eyed junco hybrid) These subspecies have dark slate-gray heads, breasts and upperparts. Females are brownish-gray, sometimes with reddish-brown flanks. They breed in North American taiga forests from Alaska to Newfoundland and south to the Appalachian Mountains, wintering throughout most of the United States. They are relatively common across their range. =White-winged group= * white-winged dark-eyed junco (J. h. aikeni) The white-winged dark-eyed junco has a medium-gray head, breast, and upperparts with white wing bars. Females are washed brownish. It has more white in the tail than the other subspecies. It is a common endemic breeder in the Black Hills area of South Dakota, Wyoming, Nebraska, and Montana, and winters south to northeastern New Mexico. =Oregon group= Oregon dark-eyed junco * Montana dark-eyed junco (J. h. montanus) * Oregon dark-eyed junco (J. h. oreganus) * Point Pinos dark-eyed junco (J. h. pinosus) * Hanson Laguna dark- eyed junco (J. h. pontilis) * Shufeldt's dark-eyed junco (J. h. shufeldti) * Thurber's dark-eyed junco (J. h. thurberi) * Townsend's dark-eyed junco (J. h. townsendi) These subspecies have a blackish-gray head and breast with a brown back and wings and reddish flanks, tending toward duller and paler plumage in the inland and southern parts of its range. Oregon dark-eyed juncos are less commonly known as brown-backed dark-eyed juncos. This is the most common subspecies group in the west, breeding in the Pacific Coast mountains from southeastern Alaska to extreme northern Baja California and wintering to the Great Plains and northern Sonora. An unresolved debate exists as to whether this large and distinct group is a full species. Pink-sided dark-eyed junco =Pink-sided group= * pink-sided dark-eyed junco (J. h. mearnsi) Often considered part of the Oregon group, this subspecies has a lighter gray head and breast than the Oregon juncos, with contrasting dark lores. The back and wings are brown. It has a pinkish-cinnamon color that is richer and covers more of the flanks and breast than in the Oregon dark-eyed juncos. It breeds in the northern Rocky Mountains from southern Alberta to eastern Idaho and western Wyoming and winters in central Idaho and nearby Montana and from southwestern South Dakota, southern Wyoming, and northern Utah to northern Sonora and Chihuahua. Gray-headed dark-eyed junco =Gray-headed group= * gray-headed dark-eyed junco (J. h. caniceps) This subspecies is essentially rather light gray on top with a rusty back. It breeds in the southern Rocky Mountains from Colorado to central Arizona and New Mexico, and winters into northern Mexico. =Red-backed group= * red-backed dark-eyed junco (J. h. dorsalis) Often included with J. h. caniceps as part of the \\"gray-headed group\\", this subspecies differs from the gray-headed junco proper in having a more silvery bill with a dark-colored upper and light-colored lower mandible, a variable amount of rust on the wings, and pale underparts. This makes it similar to the yellow-eyed junco (J. phaeonotus), except for the dark eyes. It is found in the southern mountains of Arizona and New Mexico. It does not overlap with the yellow-eyed junco in its breeding range. =Guadalupe group= * Guadalupe dark-eyed junco or Guadalupe junco (J. h. insularis or J. insularis, depending on the authority) The extremely rare Guadalupe junco is also considered part of this species by some authorities, including the IUCN, which restored it to subspecies status in 2008. Other authorities consider it a separate species in its own right ‚Äì perhaps a rather young one, but certainly this population has evolved more rapidly than the mainland subspecies due to its small population size and the founder effect. Ecology Fledgling pink-sided dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis mearnsi) at about 1 month after hatching, Yellowstone National Park Their breeding habitat is coniferous or mixed forest areas throughout North America. In otherwise optimal conditions they also utilize other habitat, but at the southern margin of its range it can only persist in its favorite habitat. Northern birds migrate further south, arriving in their winter quarters between mid-September and November and leaving to breed from mid-March onwards, with almost all of them gone by the end of April or so. Many populations are permanent residents or altitudinal migrants, while in cold years they may choose to stay in their winter range and breed there. For example, in the Sierra Nevada of eastern California, J. hymealis populations will migrate to winter ranges lower than their summer range. In winter, juncos are familiar in and around towns, and in many places are the most common birds at feeders. The slate-colored dark-eyed junco is a rare vagrant to western Europe and may successfully winter in Great Britain, usually in domestic gardens. These birds forage on the ground. In winter, they often forage in flocks that may contain several subspecies. They mainly eat insects and seeds. Nest with eggs They usually nest in a cup-shaped depression on the ground, well hidden by vegetation or other material, although nests are sometimes found in the lower branches of a shrub or tree. The nests have an outer diameter of about and are lined with fine grasses and hair. Normally two clutches of four eggs are laid during the breeding season. The slightly glossy eggs are grayish or pale bluish-white and heavily spotted (sometimes splotched) with various shades of brown, purple or gray. The spotting is concentrated at the large end of the egg. The eggs are incubated by the female for 12 to 13 days. The young leave the nest between 11 and 14 days after hatching.

He was king for fifty-nine years, the longest in the Zhou Dynasty and all of pre-imperial China (in terms of the reign length followed by King Mu of Zhou). By the time of King Nan's reign, the kings of Zhou had lost almost all political and military power, as even their remaining crown land was split into two states or factions, led by rival feudal lords: West Zhou, where the capital Wangcheng was located, and East Zhou, centred at Chengzhou and Kung. Therefore, Nan lacked any personal territory and was effectively under the control of the local feudal lords, essentially relying on their charity. However, Nan's symbolic and ritual power remains disputed. On one side, the Chinese states largely ignored the king's activities and adopted royal titles and rituals for themselves, while the dynasty's fall generally received meagre contemporary coverage and attention. This led to the assumption that Nan no longer had any symbolic power or semblance of royal authority left. On the other side, recent epigraphic discoveries and some accounts in the Records of the Grand Historian and Zhan Guo Ce suggest that until his death, Nan was still respected as the Son of Heaven. Either way, the last king of Zhou managed to preserve his weakened dynasty through diplomacy and conspiracies for fifty-nine years until his deposition by Qin and death in 256 BC. Life = Reign = At the beginning of his reign in 314 BC, King Nan moved the capital from Chengzhou to Wangcheng. From then on, the Zhou crown lands were invaded several times by foreign powers, beginning with Qin's attack on Yiyang in West Zhou in 307 BC. Only constant political manoeuvring and ever-changing alliances of the king and the feudal lords ensured the survival of West and East Zhou, even though the two Zhou states often weakened themselves by conspiring against each other. Once, Qin planned to march its troops through East and West Zhou to attack Han, so that the lords of Zhou feared to be caught in war between the two states. The Scribe Yan advised King Nan that it would be of advantage if Han would cede some territory to Zhou and Zhou send some hostages to Chu. Qin would then suspect the state of Chu to plan an attack on Qin during its campaign against Han. At the same time the king of Zhou should, as Yan suggested, explain to the king of Qin that Han suspected Zhou of conspiring with Qin because of the present of land made to Zhou. With this method the king of Zhou would increase his territory and avoid Qin troops marching through his land. On another occasion, King Nan was summoned to Qin's royal court to debate the question of attacking the Han city of Nanyang. Instead of following the request, Nan conspired with Han to block the way between Zhou and Qin in order to prevent the debate and avoid a war. King Nan's rule was not only threatened by outside powers, but also by the constant conflict between the lords of West and East Zhou. When they went to war, the state of Han initially supported West Zhou's nobles, but went on to betray its allies. Instead of fighting East Zhou, the Han forces looted Wangcheng and Nan's royal palace, while avoiding war with the Son of Heaven, King Nan, as they were still officially \\"allies\\". As Zhou grew increasingly weak, the king's rule was more frequently challenged by expansionist Qin. In 273 BC Ma Fan developed a plan to protect the Nine Tripod Cauldrons of Yu the Great representing royal authority by enlisting the help of King Anxi of Wei, who constructed a fortification wall for Zhou. Nevertheless, the Zhou dynasty remained unable to stop Qin's expansion, and Nan's kingdom was only spared because the rulers of Qin believed that the annihilation of the land of the Son of Heaven would damage their names. In order to survive, Nan and his officials even used to function as a spy for Qin in explaining the military changes in the state of Han, Wei and Zhao. = Fall= Only when Qin occupied the town of Fushu, belonging to Han, but in the vicinity of the ancient royal capital, Nan and the lords of West Zhou became so frightened of an impending invasion that they joined an alliance against Qin. West Zhou attacked Qin, but was quickly driven back. Wangcheng was finally conquered in 256 BC, and King Nan travelled to Xianyang to submit to King Zhaoxiang of Qin. West Zhou was then annexed by Qin, whereupon Nan was demoted to Duke of West Zhou. Imprisoned in Wangcheng, he died shortly afterwards, \\"and the rituals of the Zhou dynasty ceased forever\\". Qin seized the Nine Tripod Cauldrons and exiled Nan's heir, Ji Wen, to Danhu. Both the royal Ji family and many citizens of West Zhou then fled to East Zhou, where they and the local lords proclaimed Duke Wen of Eastern Zhou new king. Duke Wen was never recognized king outside of East Zhou, however, so that Nan is generally considered the last rightful King of Zhou. Together with Nan's son Ji Zhao, Wen led the resistance against Qin, but they were defeated in 251 and 249 BC, respectively. East Zhou was annexed by Qin, and none of Nan's sons subsequently laid claim to the Zhou dynastic imperial title. The remaining royal Ji family fled to the State of Wey. Thus ended the Zhou dynasty, whose fall was hardly noted by the people and states of China. However, soon after Nan's death a king of Qin lamented the dynasty's fall as disruptive for the order of Heaven and Earth. Likewise, the scholars of Qin wrote in the L√ºshi Chunqiu: > \\"Nowadays, the house of Zhou has been destroyed, [the line of] the Sons of > Heaven has been severed. There is no greater turmoil than the absence of the > Son of Heaven; without the Son of Heaven, the strong overcome the weak, the > many lord it over the few, they use arms to harm each other having no rest.\\" The title of \\"Son of Heaven\\" was eventually adopted by Qin Shi Huang, when he proclaimed himself the First Emperor.

Fox) are often chosen as spokespeople for commercial advertising. As of August 2017, Kayleigh McEnany and Michael Tyler served as spokespeople of the RNC and DNC, respectively. Responsibilities Unlike an individual giving a personal testimonial, it is the job of a spokesperson to faithfully represent and advocate for the organization's positions, even when these conflict with their own opinion. As a result, spokespeople are generally selected from experienced, long-time employees or other people who are known to support the organization's goals. Identity A corporation may be represented in public by its chief executive officer, chairperson, or president, chief financial officer, counsel, or external legal advisor. In addition, on a day-to-day level and for more routine announcements, the job may be delegated to the corporate communications or investor relations departments (or equivalents), who will act as spokespeople. As an example, in the particle physics community, large collaborations of physicists elect one (or two) spokespeople or leader(s) of the collaboration. The spokesperson in such cases is the lead scientist of the collaboration, not a public speaker. Each collaboration chooses the roles and responsibilities of the spokesperson for internal purposes, but typically spokespeople also have defined roles for liaising with the host laboratory and/or funding agencies.

It is named after Max Dehn, who used it to solve Hilbert's third problem on whether all polyhedra with equal volume could be dissected into each other. Two polyhedra have a dissection into polyhedral pieces that can be reassembled into either one, if and only if their volumes and Dehn invariants are equal. A polyhedron can be cut up and reassembled to tile space if and only if its Dehn invariant is zero, so having Dehn invariant zero is a necessary condition for being a space-filling polyhedron. The Dehn invariant of a self-intersection free flexible polyhedron is invariant as it flexes. The Dehn invariant is zero for the cube but nonzero for the other Platonic solids, implying that the other solids cannot tile space and that they cannot be dissected into a cube. All of the Archimedean solids have Dehn invariants that are rational combinations of the invariants for the Platonic solids. In particular, the truncated octahedron also tiles space and has Dehn invariant zero like the cube. The Dehn invariants of polyhedra are elements of an infinite-dimensional vector space. As an abelian group, this space is part of an exact sequence involving group homology. Similar invariants can also be defined for some other dissection puzzles, including the problem of dissecting rectilinear polygons into each other by axis-parallel cuts and translations. Background Dissection of a square and equilateral triangle into each other. No such dissection exists for the cube and regular tetrahedron. In two dimensions, the Wallace‚ÄìBolyai‚ÄìGerwien theorem states that any two polygons of equal area can be cut up into polygonal pieces and reassembled into each other. David Hilbert became interested in this result as a way to axiomatize area, in connection with Hilbert's axioms for Euclidean geometry. In Hilbert's third problem, he posed the question of whether two polyhedra of equal volumes can always be cut into polyhedral pieces and reassembled into each other. Hilbert's student Max Dehn, in his 1900 habilitation thesis, invented the Dehn invariant in order to prove that this is not always possible, providing a negative solution to Hilbert's problem. Although Dehn formulated his invariant differently, the modern approach is to describe it as a value in a tensor product, following .. See in particular p. 61.. Definition The definition of the Dehn invariant requires a notion of a polyhedron for which the lengths and dihedral angles of edges are well defined. Most commonly, it applies to the polyhedra whose boundaries are manifolds, embedded on a finite number of planes in Euclidean space. However, the Dehn invariant has also been considered for polyhedra in spherical geometry or in hyperbolic space, and for certain self-crossing polyhedra in Euclidean space.. The values of the Dehn invariant belong to an abelian group. defined as the tensor product :\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbb{Z}}\\\\mathbb{R}/2\\\\pi\\\\mathbb{Z}. The left factor of this tensor product is the set of real numbers (in this case representing lengths of edges of polyhedra) and the right factor represents dihedral angles in radians, given as numbers modulo 2. (Some sources take the angles modulo instead of modulo 2,. or divide the angles by and use \\\\mathbb{R}/\\\\mathbb{Z} in place of \\\\mathbb{R}/2\\\\pi\\\\mathbb{Z}. but this makes no difference to the resulting tensor product, as any rational multiple of in the right factor becomes zero in the product.) The Dehn invariant of a polyhedron with edge lengths \\\\ell_i and edge dihedral angles \\\\theta_i is the sum :\\\\sum_i \\\\ell_i\\\\otimes\\\\theta_i. An alternative but equivalent description of the Dehn invariant involves the choice of a Hamel basis, an infinite subset B of the real numbers such that every real number can be expressed uniquely as a sum of finitely many rational multiples of elements of B. Thus, as an additive group, \\\\mathbb{R} is isomorphic to \\\\mathbb{Q}^{(B)}, the direct sum of copies of \\\\mathbb{Q} with one summand for each element of B. If B is chosen carefully so that (or a rational multiple of ) is one of its elements, and B' is the rest of the basis with this element excluded, then the tensor product \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbb{R}/2\\\\pi\\\\mathbb{Z} is the (infinite dimensional) real vector space \\\\mathbb{R}^{(B')}. The Dehn invariant can be expressed by decomposing each dihedral angle \\\\theta_i into a finite sum of basis elements :\\\\theta_i=\\\\sum_{j=0}^{k_i} q_{i,j} b_{i,j} where q_{i,j} is rational, b_{i,j} is one of the real numbers in the Hamel basis, and these basis elements are numbered so that b_{i,0} is the rational multiple of that belongs to B but not B'. With this decomposition, the Dehn invariant is :\\\\sum_i \\\\sum_{j=1}^{k_i} \\\\ell_i q_{i,j} e_{i,j}, where each e_{i,j} is the standard unit vector in \\\\mathbb{R}^{(B')} corresponding to the basis element b_{i,j}. Note that the sum here starts at j=1, to omit the term corresponding to the rational multiples of .Essentially the same formula, but with tensor notation used for the unit vectors, appears in . Although the Hamel basis formulation appears to involve the axiom of choice, this can be avoided (when considering any specific finite set of polyhedra) by restricting attention to the finite- dimensional vector space generated over \\\\mathbb{Q} by the dihedral angles of the polyhedra.. This alternative formulation shows that the values of the Dehn invariant can be given the additional structure of a real vector space. For an ideal polyhedron in hyperbolic space, the edge lengths are infinite, making the usual definition of the Dehn invariant inapplicable. Nevertheless the Dehn invariant can be extended to these polyhedra by using horospheres to truncate their vertices, and computing the Dehn invariant in the usual way for the resulting truncated shape, ignoring the extra edges created by this truncation process. The result does not depend on the choice of horospheres for the truncation, as long as each one cuts off only a single vertex of the given polyhedron. Examples The Platonic solids each have uniform edge lengths and dihedral angles, none of which are rational multiples of each other. The dihedral angle of a cube, /2, is a rational multiple of , but the rest are not. The dihedral angles of the regular tetrahedron and regular octahedron are supplementary: they sum to .See Table of polyhedron dihedral angles. In the Hamel basis formulation of the Dehn invariant, one can choose four of these dihedral angles as part of the Hamel basis. The angle of the cube, /2, is the basis element that is discarded in the formula for the Dehn invariant, so the Dehn invariant of the cube is zero. More generally, the Dehn invariant of any parallelepiped is also zero.. Only one of the two angles of the tetrahedron and octahedron can be included, as the other one is a rational combination of the one that is included and the angle of the cube. The Dehn invariants of each of the other Platonic solids will be a vector in \\\\mathbb{R}^{B'} formed by multiplying the unit vector for that solid's angle by the length and number of edges of the solid. No matter how they are scaled by different edge lengths, the tetrahedron, icosahedron, and dodecahedron all have Dehn invariants that form vectors pointing in different directions, and therefore are unequal and nonzero., Table 3, p. 331. The negated dihedral angle of the octahedron differs from the angle of a tetrahedron by an integer multiple of , and in addition the octahedron has two times as many edges as the tetrahedron (twelve instead of six). Therefore, the Dehn invariant of the octahedron is ‚àí2 times the Dehn invariant of a tetrahedron of the same edge length. The Dehn invariants of the other Archimedean solids can also be expressed as rational combinations of the invariants of the Platonic solids. Applications As observed, the Dehn invariant is an invariant for the dissection of polyhedra, in the sense that cutting up a polyhedron into smaller polyhedral pieces and then reassembling them into a different polyhedron does not change the Dehn invariant of the result. Another such invariant is the volume of the polyhedron. Therefore, if it is possible to dissect one polyhedron into a different polyhedron , then both and must have the same Dehn invariant as well as the same volume. extended this result by proving that the volume and the Dehn invariant are the only invariants for this problem. If and both have the same volume and the same Dehn invariant, it is always possible to dissect one into the other. Dehn's result continues to be valid for spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry. In both of those geometries, two polyhedra that can be cut and reassembled into each other must have the same Dehn invariant. However, as Jessen observed, the extension of Sydler's result to spherical or hyperbolic geometry remains open: it is not known whether two spherical or hyperbolic polyhedra with the same volume and the same Dehn invariant can always be cut and reassembled into each other., p. 6. Every hyperbolic manifold with finite volume can be cut along geodesic surfaces into a hyperbolic polyhedron, which necessarily has zero Dehn invariant.. The Dehn invariant also controls the ability of a polyhedron to tile space (part of the subject of Hilbert's eighteenth problem). Every space-filling tile has Dehn invariant zero, like the cube... The reverse of this is not true ‚Äì there exist polyhedra with Dehn invariant zero that do not tile space, but they can always be dissected into another shape (the cube) that does tile space. More generally, if some combination of polyhedra jointly tiles space, then the sum of their Dehn invariants (taken in the same proportion) must be zero. For instance, the tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb is a tiling of space by tetrahedra and octahedra (with twice as many tetrahedra as octahedra), corresponding to the fact that the sum of the Dehn invariants of an octahedron and two tetrahedra (with the same side lengths) is zero.This argument applies whenever the proportions of the tiles can be defined as a limit point of the numbers of tiles within larger polyhedra; see , Equation (4.2), and the surrounding discussion. Realizability Although the Dehn invariant takes values in \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbb{Z}}\\\\mathbb{R}/2\\\\pi\\\\mathbb{Z}, not all of the elements in this space can be realized as the Dehn invariants of polyhedra. The Dehn invariants of Euclidean polyhedra form a linear subspace of \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbb{Z}}\\\\mathbb{R}/2\\\\pi\\\\mathbb{Z}: one can add the Dehn invariants of polyhedra by taking the disjoint union of the polyhedra (or gluing them together on a face), negate Dehn invariants by making holes in the shape of the polyhedron into large cubes, and multiply the Dehn invariant by any scalar by scaling the polyhedron by the same number. The question of which elements of \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbb{Z}}\\\\mathbb{R}/2\\\\pi\\\\mathbb{Z}, (or, equivalently, \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbb{Z}}\\\\mathbb{R}/\\\\mathbb{Z}) are realizable was clarified by the work of Dupont and Sah, who showed the existence of the following short exact sequence of abelian groups (not vector spaces) involving group homology:, p. 7. :0\\\\to H_2(\\\\operatorname{SO}(3),\\\\mathbb{R}^3)\\\\to\\\\mathcal{P}(E^3)/\\\\mathcal{Z}(E^3)\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbb{Z}}\\\\mathbb{R}/\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\to H_1(\\\\operatorname{SO}(3),\\\\mathbb{R}^3)\\\\to 0 Here, the notation \\\\mathcal{P}(E^3) represents the free abelian group over Euclidean polyhedra modulo certain relations derived from pairs of polyhedra that can be dissected into each other. \\\\mathcal{Z}(E^3) is the subgroup generated in this group by the triangular prisms, and is used here to represent volume (as each real number is the volume of exactly one element of this group). The map from the group of polyhedra to \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbb{Z}}\\\\mathbb{R}/\\\\mathbb{Z} is the Dehn invariant. \\\\operatorname{SO}(3) is the Euclidean point rotation group, and H is the group homology. Sydler's theorem that volume and the Dehn invariant are the only invariants for Euclidean dissection is represented homologically by the statement that the group H_2(\\\\operatorname{SO}(3),\\\\mathbb{R}^3) appearing in this sequence is actually zero. If it were nonzero, its image in the group of polyhedra would give a family of polyhedra that are not dissectable to a cube of the same volume but that have zero Dehn invariant. By Sydler's theorem, such polyhedra do not exist. The group H_1(\\\\operatorname{SO}(3),\\\\mathbb{R}^3) appearing towards the right of the exact sequence is isomorphic to the group \\\\Omega^1_{\\\\mathbb{R}} of K√§hler differentials, and the map from tensor products of lengths and angles to K√§hler differentials is given by :\\\\ell\\\\otimes\\\\theta/\\\\pi\\\\mapsto\\\\ell\\\\frac{d\\\\cos\\\\theta}{\\\\sin\\\\theta}, where d is the universal derivation of \\\\Omega^1_{\\\\mathbb{R}}. This group H_1(\\\\operatorname{SO}(3),\\\\mathbb{R}^3)=\\\\Omega^1_{\\\\mathbb{R}} is an obstacle to realizability: its nonzero elements come from elements of \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbb{Z}}\\\\mathbb{R}/\\\\mathbb{Z} that cannot be realized as Dehn invariants., Theorem 6.2(a), p. 35\\\\. Dupont states that this is \\"a reformulation of a result of \\". Analogously, in hyperbolic or spherical space, the realizable Dehn invariants do not necessarily form a vector space, because scalar multiplication is no longer possible, but they still form a subgroup. Dupont and Sah prove the existence of the exact sequences :0\\\\to H_3(\\\\operatorname{SL}(2,\\\\mathbb{C}),\\\\mathbb{Z})^-\\\\to\\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\mathcal{H}^3)\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbb{Z}}\\\\mathbb{R}/\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\to H_2(\\\\operatorname{SL}(2,\\\\mathbb{C}),\\\\mathbb{Z})^-\\\\to 0 and :0\\\\to H_3(\\\\operatorname{SU}(2),\\\\mathbb{Z})\\\\to\\\\mathcal{P}(S^3)/\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbb{Z}}\\\\mathbb{R}/\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\to H_2(\\\\operatorname{SU}(2),\\\\mathbb{Z})\\\\to 0. Here \\\\operatorname{SL} denotes the special linear group, and \\\\operatorname{SL}(2,\\\\mathbb{C}) is the group of M√∂bius transformations; the superscript minus-sign indicates the (‚àí1)-eigenspace for the involution induced by complex conjugation. \\\\operatorname{SU} denotes the special unitary group. The subgroup \\\\mathbb{Z} in \\\\mathcal{P}(S^3)/\\\\mathbb{Z} is the group generated by the whole sphere. Again, the rightmost nonzero group in these sequences is the obstacle to realizability of a value in \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbb{Z}}\\\\mathbb{R}/\\\\mathbb{Z} as a Dehn invariant. This algebraic view of the Dehn invariant can be extended to higher dimensions, where it has a motivic interpretation involving algebraic K-theory. Related results An approach very similar to the Dehn invariant can be used to determine whether two rectilinear polygons can be dissected into each other only using axis-parallel cuts and translations (rather than cuts at arbitrary angles and rotations). An invariant for this kind of dissection uses the tensor product \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbb{Z}}\\\\mathbb{R} where the left and right terms in the product represent height and width of rectangles. The invariant for any given polygon is calculated by cutting the polygon into rectangles, taking the tensor product of the height and width of each rectangle, and adding the results. Again, a dissection is possible if and only if two polygons have the same area and the same invariant. Flexible polyhedra are a class of polyhedra that can undergo a continuous motion that preserves the shape of their faces. By Cauchy's rigidity theorem, they must be non- convex, and it is known (the \\"bellows theorem\\") that the volume of the polyhedron must stay constant throughout this motion. A stronger version of this theorem states that the Dehn invariant of such a polyhedron must also remain invariant throughout any continuous motion. This result is called the \\"strong bellows theorem\\". It has been proven for all non-self-intersecting flexible polyhedra. However, for more complicated flexible polyhedra with self-intersections the Dehn invariant may change continuously as the polyhedron flexes.. The total mean curvature of a polyhedral surface has been defined as the sum over the edges of the edge lengths multiplied by the exterior dihedral angles. Thus (for polyhedra without rational angles) it is a linear function of the Dehn invariant, although it does not provide full information about the Dehn invariant. It has been proven to remain constant for any flexing polyhedron..

She was one of the best-known writers to emerge from the former East Germany.Christa Wolf obituary, Kate Webb, The Guardian, 1 December 2011Christa Wolf obituary, The Telegraph, 2 December 2011. Biography Wolf was born the daughter of Otto and Herta Ihlenfeld, in Landsberg an der Warthe, then in the Province of Brandenburg; the city is now Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski, Poland. After World War II, her family, being Germans, were expelled from their home on what had become Polish territory. They crossed the new Oder-Neisse border in 1945 and settled in Mecklenburg, in what would become the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany. She studied literature at the University of Jena and the University of Leipzig. After her graduation, she worked for the German Writers' Union and became an editor for a publishing company. While working as an editor for publishing companies Verlag Neues Leben and Mitteldeutscher Verlag and as a literary critic for the journal Neue deutsche Literatur, Wolf was provided contact with antifascists and Communists, many of whom had either returned from exile or from imprisonment in concentration camps. Her writings discuss political, economic, and scientific power, making her an influential spokesperson in East and West Germany during post-World War II for the empowerment of individuals to be active within the industrialized and patriarchal society. She joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in 1949 and left it in June 1989, six months before the Communist regime collapsed. She was a candidate member of the Central Committee of the SED from 1963 to 1967. Stasi records found in 1993 showed that she worked as an informant (Inoffizieller Mitarbeiter) during the years 1959‚Äì61. The Stasi officers criticized what they called her \\"reticence\\", and they lost interest in her cooperation. She was herself then closely watched for nearly 30 years. During the Cold War, Wolf was openly critical of the leadership of the GDR, but she maintained a loyalty to the values of socialism and opposed German reunification. In 1961, she published Moskauer Novelle (Moscow Novella). However, Wolf's breakthrough as a writer came in 1963 with the publication of Der geteilte Himmel (Divided Heaven, They Divided the Sky). Her subsequent works included Nachdenken √ºber Christa T. (The Quest for Christa T.) (1968), Kindheitsmuster (Patterns of Childhood) (1976), Kein Ort. Nirgends (No Place On Earth) (1979), Kassandra (Cassandra) (1983), St√∂rfall (Accident) (1987), Medea (1996), Auf dem Weg nach Tabou (On the Way to Taboo) (1994), and Stadt der Engel oder The Overcoat of Dr. Freud (2010) (City of Angels or The Overcoat of Dr. Freud). Christa T was a work that‚Äîwhile briefly touching on a disconnection from one's family's ancestral home‚Äîwas concerned with a woman's experiencing overwhelming societal pressure to conform. Kassandra is perhaps Wolf's most important book, re-interpreting the battle of Troy as a war for economic power and a shift from a matriarchal to a patriarchal society. Was bleibt (What Remains), described her life under Stasi surveillance, was written in 1979, but not published until 1990. Auf dem Weg nach Tabou (1995; translated as Parting from Phantoms) gathered essays, speeches, and letters written during the four years following the reunification of Germany. Leibhaftig (2002) describes a woman struggling with life and death in 1980s East-German hospital, while awaiting medicine from the West. Central themes in her work are German fascism, humanity, feminism, and self-discovery. In many of her works, Wolf uses illness as a metaphor. In a speech addressed to the Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft (German Cancer Society) she says, \\"How we choose to speak or not to speak about illnesses such as cancer mirrors our misgivings about society.\\" In \\"Nachdenken √ºber Christa T.\\" (The Quest for Christa T). the protagonist dies of leukemia. This work demonstrates the dangers and consequences that happen to an individual when they internalize society's contradictions. In Accident, the narrator's brother is undergoing surgery to remove a brain tumor a few days after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster had occurred. In 2004 she edited and published her correspondence with her UK-based near namesake Charlotte Wolff over the years 1983‚Äì1986 (Wolf, Christa and Wolff, Charlotte (2004) Ja, unsere Kreise ber√ºhren sich: Briefe, Luchterhand Munich). Grave of Christa Wolf, with pens left by well-wishers. Wolf died 1 December 2011 in Berlin, where she had lived with her husband, . She was buried on 13 December 2011 in Berlin's Dorotheenstadt cemetery. In 2018, the city of Berlin designated her grave as an Ehrengrab. Reception Although Wolf's works were widely praised in both Germanys in the 1970s and 1980s, they have sometimes been seen as controversial since German reunification.Myra N. Love. Christa Wolf and the Conscience of History. Peter Lang, 1991. p. i.Gail Finney. Christa Wolf. Twayne, 1999. p. 9 William Dalrymple wrote that in East Germany \\"writers such as Christa Wolf became irrelevant overnight once the Berlin Wall was broached\\". Alt URL Upon publication of Was bleibt, West German critics such as Frank Schirrmacher argued that Wolf failed to criticize the authoritarianism of the East German Communist regime, whilst others called her works \\"moralistic\\". Defenders have recognized Wolf's role in establishing a distinctly East German literary voice.. Fausto Cercignani's study of Wolf's earlier novels and essays on her later works have helped promote awareness of her narrative gifts, irrespective of her political and personal ups and downs. The emphasis placed by Cercignani on Christa Wolf's heroism has opened the way to subsequent studies in this direction.Fausto Cercignani, Existenz und Heldentum bei Christa Wolf. \\"Der geteilte Himmel\\" und \\"Kassandra\\" (Existence and Heroism in Christa Wolf. \\"Divided Heaven\\" and \\"Cassandra\\"), W√ºrzburg, K√∂nigshausen & Neumann, 1988. For subsequent essays see http://en.scientificcommons.org/fausto_cercignani. Wolf received the Heinrich Mann Prize in 1963, the Georg B√ºchner Prize in 1980, and the Schiller Memorial Prize in 1983, the Geschwister-Scholl-Preis in 1987, as well as other national and international awards. After the German reunification, Wolf received further awards: in 1999 she was awarded the Elisabeth Langg√§sser Prize and the Nelly Sachs Literature Prize, and Wolf became the first recipient of the Deutscher B√ºcherpreis (German Book Prize) in 2002 for her lifetime achievement. In 2010, Wolf was awarded the Gro√üer Literaturpreis der Bayerischen Akademie der Sch√∂nen K√ºnste.

Algorithm =Notation= Let B be the base of the number system you are using, and n be the degree of the root to be extracted. Let x be the radicand processed thus far, y be the root extracted thus far, and r be the remainder. Let \\\\alpha be the next n digits of the radicand, and \\\\beta be the next digit of the root. Let x' be the new value of x for the next iteration, y' be the new value of y for the next iteration, and r' be the new value of r for the next iteration. These are all integers. =Invariants= At each iteration, the invariant y^n + r = x will hold. The invariant (y+1)^n>x will hold. Thus y is the largest integer less than or equal to the nth root of x, and r is the remainder. =Initialization= The initial values of x, y, and r should be 0. The value of \\\\alpha for the first iteration should be the most significant aligned block of n digits of the radicand. An aligned block of n digits means a block of digits aligned so that the decimal point falls between blocks. For example, in 123.4 the most significant aligned block of two digits is 01, the next most significant is 23, and the third most significant is 40. =Main loop= On each iteration we shift in n digits of the radicand, so we have x' = B^n x + \\\\alpha and we produce one digit of the root, so we have y' = B y + \\\\beta . The first invariant implies that r' = x' - y'^n. We want to choose \\\\beta so that the invariants described above hold. It turns out that there is always exactly one such choice, as will be proved below. To summarize, on each iteration: # Let \\\\alpha be the next aligned block of digits from the radicand # Let x' = B^n x + \\\\alpha # Let \\\\beta be the largest \\\\beta such that (B y + \\\\beta)^n \\\\le B^n x + \\\\alpha # Let y' = B y + \\\\beta # Let r' = x' - y'^n Now, note that x = y^n + r, so the condition :(B y + \\\\beta)^n \\\\le B^n x + \\\\alpha is equivalent to :(B y + \\\\beta)^n - B^n y^n \\\\le B^n r + \\\\alpha and :r' = x' - y'^n = B^n x + \\\\alpha - (B y + \\\\beta)^n is equivalent to :r' = B^n r + \\\\alpha - ((B y + \\\\beta)^n - B^n y ^n) Thus, we do not actually need x, and since r = x - y^n and x<(y+1)^n, r<(y+1)^n-y^n or r, or r, so by using r instead of x we save time and space by a factor of 1/n. Also, the B^n y^n we subtract in the new test cancels the one in (B y + \\\\beta)^n, so now the highest power of y we have to evaluate is y^{n-1} rather than y^n. =Summary= # Initialize r and y to 0. # Repeat until desired precision is obtained: ## Let \\\\alpha be the next aligned block of digits from the radicand. ## Let \\\\beta be the largest \\\\beta such that (B y + \\\\beta)^n - B^n y^n \\\\le B^n r + \\\\alpha. ## Let y' = B y + \\\\beta. ## Let r' = B^n r + \\\\alpha - ((B y + \\\\beta)^n - B^n y^n). ## Assign y \\\\leftarrow y' and r \\\\leftarrow r'. # y is the largest integer such that y^n, and y^n+r=x B^k, where k is the number of digits of the radicand after the decimal point that have been consumed (a negative number if the algorithm has not reached the decimal point yet).

Performance On each iteration, the most time-consuming task is to select \\\\beta. We know that there are B possible values, so we can find \\\\beta using O(\\\\log(B)) comparisons. Each comparison will require evaluating (B y +\\\\beta)^n - B^n y^n. In the kth iteration, y has k digits, and the polynomial can be evaluated with 2 n - 4 multiplications of up to k(n-1) digits and n - 2 additions of up to k(n-1) digits, once we know the powers of y and \\\\beta up through n-1 for y and n for \\\\beta. \\\\beta has a restricted range, so we can get the powers of \\\\beta in constant time. We can get the powers of y with n-2 multiplications of up to k(n-1) digits. Assuming n-digit multiplication takes time O(n^2) and addition takes time O(n), we take time O(k^2 n^2) for each comparison, or time O(k^2 n^2 \\\\log(B)) to pick \\\\beta. The remainder of the algorithm is addition and subtraction that takes time O(k), so each iteration takes O(k^2 n^2 \\\\log(B)). For all k digits, we need time O(k^3 n^2 \\\\log(B)). The only internal storage needed is r, which is O(k) digits on the kth iteration. That this algorithm does not have bounded memory usage puts an upper bound on the number of digits which can be computed mentally, unlike the more elementary algorithms of arithmetic. Unfortunately, any bounded memory state machine with periodic inputs can only produce periodic outputs, so there are no such algorithms which can compute irrational numbers from rational ones, and thus no bounded memory root extraction algorithms. Note that increasing the base increases the time needed to pick \\\\beta by a factor of O(\\\\log(B)), but decreases the number of digits needed to achieve a given precision by the same factor, and since the algorithm is cubic time in the number of digits, increasing the base gives an overall speedup of O(\\\\log^2(B)). When the base is larger than the radicand, the algorithm degenerates to binary search, so it follows that this algorithm is not useful for computing roots with a computer, as it is always outperformed by much simpler binary search, and has the same memory complexity.

Early years  Seelenbinder was born in Stettin, Pomerania (modern-day Poland), and became a wrestler after training as a joiner. He had connections with the young people's workers' movement from an early age. Seelenbinder won the light heavyweight class of Greco-Roman wrestling at the 1925 Workers' Olympiad in Frankfurt. In 1928 and 1929 he won the Spartakiad in Moscow; over 200 German sportsmen were banned from the contest, but Seelenbinder, with his interest in Marxism, took part.Hans Maur. Gedenkst√§tten der Arbeiterbewegung in Berlin-Friedrichshain, published by the district leadership of the SED, Bezirkskommission zur Erforschung der Geschichte der √∂rtlichen Arbeiterbewegung in Zusammenarbeit mit der Kreiskommission zur Erforschung der Geschichte der √∂rtlichen Arbeiterbewegung bei der Kreisleitung Berlin-Friedrichshain der SED (1981) pp. 64‚Äì66 His first trip to Moscow had already persuaded him to become a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). In 1933 he refused to give the Nazi salute when receiving his medal at the German Wrestling Championship, and was punished with a sixteen-month ban on training and sports events. Memorial and grave in Berlin-Neuk√∂lln Sports park Berlin-Neuk√∂lln German workers' sports clubs were soon banned by the Nazi party; at this point the KPD approached Seelenbinder, asking him to join one of the legal sports clubs, to train to get as much sporting success as possible, so he would be able to carry messages across Germany and into other countries. As one of the country's top sportsmen he had more freedom of movement and could travel abroad. As well as preparing for the Olympics, Seelenbinder joined the Uhrig Group, an underground resistance group named after Robert Uhrig, who organized it.  1936 Olympics and arrest  As a committed communist Seelenbinder was appalled by the 1936 Olympic Games that were to be held in Nazi Germany. He had originally planned to boycott it, but friends persuaded him to compete anyway, win, and defy the Nazis by not giving the required Nazi salute, but to use a vulgar gesture instead. This plan was foiled when he lost the first match. He eventually came in fourth in the event. The Nazis had only allowed Seelenbinder to take part in the Olympics because they thought he would secure them a medal: otherwise, they did not trust him in the slightest. Seelenbinder's illegal activities as a courier and his participation in the Uhrig Group had caught their attention: he was arrested, along with 65 other members of the group, on 4 February 1942 and after being tortured for eight days, and enduring nine camps and prisons for two and half years, he was sentenced to death by the Volksgerichtshof, he was executed for treason on 24 October 1944 at Brandenburg-G√∂rden Prison ‚Äì he was beheaded with an axe. The imprisonment left him weighing a mere 60 kilograms (132 pounds), from his previous weight of 90 kilos (198 pounds). In his farewell letter, he wrote to his father: > The time has now come for me to say goodbye. In the time of my imprisonment > I must have gone through every type of torture a man can possibly endure. > Ill health and physical and mental agony, I have been spared nothing. I > would have liked to have experienced the delights and comforts of life, > which I now appreciate twice as much, with you all, with my friends and > fellow sportsmen, after the war. The times I had with you were great, and I > lived on them during my incarceration, and wished back that wonderful time. > Sadly fate has now decided differently, after a long time of suffering. But > I know that I have found a place in all your hearts and in the hearts of > many sports followers, a place where I will always hold my ground. This > knowledge makes me proud and strong and will not let me be weak in my last > moments.  Memorials and controversy  On 29 July 1945 an urn containing Seelenbinder's ashes was buried at the site of his old club, the Berolina 03 Sports Club stadium in Neuk√∂lln, Berlin. At the same time, the stadium itself was named \\"Werner-Seelenbinder-Kampfbahn\\", but as the Cold War escalated and the political climate in West Germany became increasingly anti-communist, it was renamed \\"Stadion Neuk√∂lln\\" in 1949. A number of schools, streets and sporting facilities in the former East Germany were named after him. The Werner Seelenbinder Wrestling Tournament is still (2004) held once a year in Berlin. However, the lack of impartiality by both the anti-communist West Germans and the pro-communist East Germans, who raised Werner Seelenbinder to the status of an icon, means that today his historical importance is rather controversial. In an article in the socialist German newspaper Neues Deutschland of 2 August 2004, the director of the Berlin Sports Museum Martina Behrendt said that his role in the resistance movement had been exaggerated in the GDR, and that there were no reliable biographies. boxers from Syria looking at a bust of Seelenbinder in the Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle, 1963 On 2 August 2004 a commemorative speech was held in front of the Neuk√∂lln stadium, where Seelenbinder's ashes were buried, by the Party of Democratic Socialism, on the 100th anniversary of Seelenbinder's birth. Party members spoke of their regret that the stadium had been renamed. Others mentioned with sadness the renaming of the eastern German \\"Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle\\" as \\"Velodrom im Europasportpark\\" in 1990 and the renaming of the \\"Werner- Seelenbinder-Turm\\" in Leipzig as the \\"Glockenturm\\". On 24 October 2004, the 60th anniversary of Seelenbinder's death, the Neuk√∂lln stadium was once again renamed the \\"Werner-Seelenbinder-Stadion\\" in his memory. In 1950, an indoor sporting arena named after Seelenbinder, the Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle, was opened in the Prenzlauer Berg district, then in East Berlin. It had a capacity of 10,000 people, and was regularly used as a convention hall by East German mass organizations, such as the Free German Youth and Socialist Unity Party of Germany. It was also used as a concert arena, where musicians such as Depeche Mode, Jonathan Richman and The Wedding Present, as well as German acts, such as Feeling B and Rio Reiser, performed. It was demolished in 1993, after the fall of East Germany, and replaced by the present-day Velodrom. In 1964, the Nordic Yards Warnem√ºnde ship yard (the former Warnowwerft), launched a 7,704 gross tonnage cargo ship named Werner Seelenbinder. She was scrapped in 1988 ‚Äì before the collapse of the GDR. She remained named after the athlete throughout her career, apart from her final voyage to Alang for breaking up, for which she was re-registered and renamed MILOS-1. Seelenbinder was inducted to Germany's Sports Hall of Fame in 2008.  Biography  Seelenbinder has been most recently biographied by the New Zealand writer James McNeish.

The stated object of the act was the \\"encouragement of learning,\\" and it achieved this by securing authors the \\"sole right and liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing and vending\\" the copies of their \\"maps, charts, and books\\" for a term of 14 years, with the right to renew for one additional 14-year term should the copyright holder still be alive.  Early developments  The 1710 British Statute of Anne did not apply to the American colonies. The colonies' economy was largely agrarian, hence copyright law was not a priority, resulting in only three private copyright acts being passed in America prior to 1783. Two of the acts were limited to seven years, the other was limited to a term of five years. In 1783 a committee of the Continental Congress concluded \\"that nothing is more properly a man's own an the fruit of his study, and that the protection and security of literary property would greatly tends to encourage genius and to promote useful discoveries.\\" But under the Articles of Confederation, the Continental Congress had no authority to issue copyright; instead it passed a resolution encouraging the States to \\"secure to the authors or publishers of any new book not hitherto printed... the copy right of such books for a certain time not less than fourteen years from the first publication; and to secure to the said authors, if they shall survive the term first mentioned,... the copy right of such books for another term of time no less than fourteen years\\".Resolution passed by the Continental Congress, recommending the several States to secure to such Authors or Publishers of New Books the Copyright of such Books, May 2, 1783, reprinted in Three states had already enacted copyright statutes in 1783 prior to the Continental Congress resolution, and in the subsequent three years all of the remaining states except Delaware passed a copyright statute. Seven of the States followed the Statute of Anne and the Continental Congress' resolution by providing two fourteen-year terms. The five remaining States granted copyright for single terms of fourteen, twenty and twenty-one years, with no right of renewal. At the Constitutional Convention 1787 both James Madison of Virginia and Charles C. Pinckney of South Carolina submitted proposals that would allow Congress the power to grant copyright for a limited time. These proposals are the origin of the Copyright Clause in the United States Constitution, which allows the granting of copyright and patents for a limited time to serve a utilitarian function, namely \\"to promote the progress of science and useful arts\\". Legislative history During the first session of the 1st United States Congress in 1789, the House of Representative considered enacting a copyright law. The historian Davit Ramsay petitioned congress seeking to restrict the publication of his History of the American Revolution on April 15. Congressmen Thomas Tudor Tucker, Alexander White, and Benjamin Huntington examined his claims and a copyright committee consisting of Huntington, Lambert Cadwalader, and Benjamin Contee began drafting the legislation on April 20. Jedidiah Morse, Nicholas Pike, and Hannah Adams each also petitioned Congress with their interests in restricting the printing of texts. Their bill moved to the Committee of the Whole House in June, but the matter was postponed in anticipation of the first recess, to be taken up again when the House reconvened. Both houses of Congress pursued a copyright law more pointedly during 1790's second session. They responded to President George Washington's 1790 State of the Union Address, in which he urged Congress to pass legislation designed for \\"the promotion of Science and Literature\\" so as to better educate the public. This led to the Patent Act of 1790 and, shortly thereafter, the Copyright Act of 1790. =House of Representatives= The scope of what works would be covered by the law's exclusivity was contended in the House. When he reintroduced the matter, Aedanus Burke wanted to establish a first law about copyright regarding \\"literary property,\\" but Alexander White called for the expansion of copyright beyond writings on the behalf of Jedidiah Morse, who believed unauthorized copying of his American Geography would hurt his business.1 Annals of Cong. 1117-8 (Joseph Gales, ed. 1790) The need to re-raise the copyright issue, among other items left unresolved at the end of the first session, required the House to clarify some order of business problems over whether or not they could reopen unfinished business from a previous session.1 Annals of Cong. 1110-2 (Joseph Gales, ed. 1790) That settled, the House established a drafting committee for the law on February 1, chaired by Abraham Baldwin.1 Annals of Cong. 1143 (Joseph Gales, ed. 1790) Eventually, the House passed a copyright bill and passed it to the Senate. =Senate= The Senate also deliberated on Copyright after the President's speech. On May 14, the Senate passed an amended version of the bill sent to them by the House. The House accepted their amendment on May 18 and the bill passed to the President. The Act The bill was signed into law on May 31, 1790 by George Washington and published in its entirety throughout the country shortly after. The Act granted copyright for a term of \\"fourteen years from the time of recording the title thereof\\", with a right of renewal for another fourteen years if the author survived to the end of the first term. It restricted books, maps, and charts. Although musical composition were not mentioned in the text of the act, and would not be expressly covered by copyright until the Copyright Act of 1831, they were routinely registered under the 1790 Act as \\"books\\". The Act also did not mention paintings or drawings, which were not covered until the enactment of the Copyright Act of 1870. = Provisions = The Act was copied almost verbatim from the 1709 British Statute of Anne. The first sentences of the two laws are almost identical. Both require registration in order for a work to receive copyright protection; similarly, both require that copies of the work be deposited in officially designated repositories such as the Library of Congress in the United States, and the Oxford and Cambridge universities in the United Kingdom. The Statute of Anne and the Copyright Act of 1790 both provided for an initial term of 14 years, renewable once by living authors for an additional 14 years, for works not yet published. The Statute of Anne differed from the 1790 Act, however, in providing a 21-year term of restriction, with no option for renewal, for works already published at the time the law went into effect (1710). The 1790 Act only offered a 14-year term for previously published works. Newspaper advert: ‚ÄúUnited States and Foreign Copyright. Patents and Trade-Marks A Copyright will protect you from Pirates. And make you a fortune.\\" = Geographic reach = The Copyright Act of 1790 applied exclusively to citizens of the United States; works created outside the United States or by people who were not U.S. citizens were not copyrightable in the U.S. until the International Copyright Act of 1891. Consequently, various foreign authors, such as Charles Dickens, complained about not receiving royalty payments for copies of their work sold in the U.S. = Federal law = At the time, works only received protection under federal statutory copyright if the statutory formalities, such as a proper copyright notice, were satisfied. If this was not the case, the work immediately entered into the public domain. In 1834 the Supreme Court ruled in Wheaton v. Peters,Wheaton v. Peters, 33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 591 (1834) a case similar to the British Donaldson v Beckett of 1774, that although the author of an unpublished work had a common law right to control the first publication of that work, the author did not have a common law right to control reproduction following the first publication of the work.  Amendments  The Act was first amended on April 29, 1802, extending copyright restriction to etchings and, for the first time, requiring notice of copyright registration on copies of the works. The Act did not specify a consequence of failing to include that notice; however, the federal case Ewer v. Coxe established that the failure to include notice invalidated a copyright.Ewer v. Coxe The Act was also amended on February 15, 1819 to expand the jurisdiction of circuit courts (analogous to today's district courts) to allow them to hear cases on patents and copyrights.

Engine turning, also known as jewelling, is a fine geometric pattern that can be inscribed onto metal as a finish. Aluminium is often the metal chosen but any metal can be finely machined to produce intricate repetitive patterns that offer reflective interest and fine detail. A 1940 Buick Super Convertible Coupe with the engine-turned pattern on the dashboard panels used by Buick in 1940 and 1941 Perhaps the most recognizable example of engine turning is on the sheetmetal panels comprising the engine cowling (nose) of Charles Lindbergh's aircraft, the Spirit of St. Louis. In the 1920s and 1930s, automobile parts such as valve covers, which are right on top of the engine, were also engine-turned. Similarly, dashboards or the instrument panel of the same were often engine-turned. Customizers also would similarly decorate their vehicles with engine-turned panels. Engravings produced by engine turning are often incorporated into the design of bank notes and other high-value documents to make production of forged copies difficult. The resulting graphics are called guilloch√©s.

Orogastric intubation is a similar process involving the insertion of a plastic tube (orogastric tube) through the mouth. Abraham Louis Levin invented the NG tube. Uses A nasogastric tube is used for feeding and administering drugs and other oral agents such as activated charcoal. For drugs and for minimal quantities of liquid, a syringe is used for injection into the tube. For continuous feeding, a gravity based system is employed, with the solution placed higher than the patient's stomach. If accrued supervision is required for the feeding, the tube is often connected to an electronic pump which can control and measure the patient's intake and signal any interruption in the feeding. Nasogastric tubes may also be used as an aid in the treatment of life threatening eating disorders, especially if the patient is not compliant with eating. In such cases, a nasogastric tube may be inserted by force for feeding against the patient's will under restraint. Such a practice may be highly distressing for both patients and healthcare staff. Nasogastric aspiration (suction) is the process of draining the stomach's contents via the tube. Nasogastric aspiration is mainly used to remove gastrointestinal secretions and swallowed air in patients with gastrointestinal obstructions. Nasogastric aspiration can also be used in poisoning situations when a potentially toxic liquid has been ingested, for preparation before surgery under anaesthesia, and to extract samples of gastric liquid for analysis. If the tube is to be used for continuous drainage, it is usually appended to a collector bag placed below the level of the patient's stomach; gravity empties the stomach's contents. It can also be appended to a suction system, however this method is often restricted to emergency situations, as the constant suction can easily damage the stomach's lining. In non-emergency situations, intermittent suction is often applied giving the benefits of suction without the untoward effects of damage to the stomach lining. Suction drainage is also used for patients who have undergone a pneumonectomy in order to prevent anesthesia-related vomiting and possible aspiration of any stomach contents. Such aspiration would represent a serious risk of complications to patients recovering from this surgery. Types Polyurethane NG tube (Viasys Corflo), 8 Fr √ó 36 in (91 cm). This fine bore tube is appropriate for longer use (up to 4 weeks). Types of nasogastric tubes include: *Levin catheter, which is a single lumen, small bore NG tube. It is more appropriate for administration of medication or nutrition.Nasogastric Tube. Last authored: Dec 2009, David LaPierre *Salem Sump catheter, which is a large bore NG tube with double lumen. This avails for aspiration in one lumen, and venting in the other to reduce negative pressure and prevent gastric mucosa from being drawn into the catheter. *Dobhoff tube, which is a small bore NG tube with a weight at the end intended to pull it by gravity during insertion.Section 82, Ensure Appropriate Position of the Dubhoff Tube Prior To Feeding. Technique An endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube as seen on CXR. Both in good position. Before an NG tube is inserted, it must be measured from the tip of the patient's nose, loop around their ear and then down to roughly 1-2 inch below the xiphoid process. The tube is then marked at this level to ensure that the tube has been inserted far enough into the patient's stomach. Many commercially available stomach and duodenal tubes have several standard depth markings, for example 18\\" (46 cm), 22\\" (56 cm), 26\\" (66 cm) and 30\\" (76 cm) from distal end; infant feeding tubes often come with 1 cm depth markings. The end of a plastic tube is lubricated (local anesthetic, such as 2% xylocaine gel, may be used; in addition, nasal vasoconstrictor and/or anesthetic spray may be applied before the insertion) and inserted into one of the patient's anterior nares. Treatment with 2.0 mg of IV midazolam greatly reduces patient stress. The tube should be directed straight towards the back of the patient as it moves through the nasal cavity and down into the throat. When the tube enters the oropharynx and glides down the posterior pharyngeal wall, the patient may gag; in this situation the patient, if awake and alert, is asked to mimic swallowing or is given some water to sip through a straw, and the tube continues to be inserted as the patient swallows. Once the tube is past the pharynx and enters the esophagus, it is easily inserted down into the stomach. The tube must then be secured in place to prevent it from moving. There are several ways to secure an NG placement. One method and the least invasive is tape. Tape is positioned and wrapped around the NG tube onto the patients nose to prevent dislodgement. Another securement device is a nasal bridle, or a device that enters one nare, around the nasal septum, and then to the other nare where it is secured in place around the nasogastric tube. There are two ways a bridle is put into place. One method, according to the Australian Journal of Otolaryngology, is performed by a physician to pull a material through the nares and then tied with the ends shortened to prevent removal of the tube. The other method is a device called the Applied Medical Technology, or AMT, bridle. This device uses a magnet inserted into both nares that connects at the nasal septum and then pulled through to one side and tied. This technology allows nurses to safely apply bridles. Several studies have proven the use of a nasal bridle prevents the loss of the NG placement that provides necessary nutrients or suctioning. A study conducted in the UK from 2014 through 2017, determined that 50% of feeding tubes secured with tape were lost inadvertently. The use of bridle securement decreased the percentage of NGs lost from 53% to 9%. Great care must be taken to ensure that the tube has not passed through the larynx into the trachea and down into the bronchi. The reliable method is to aspirate some fluid from the tube with a syringe. This fluid is then tested with pH paper (note not litmus paper) to determine the acidity of the fluid. If the pH is 4 or below then the tube is in the correct position. If this is not possible then correct verification of tube position is obtained with an X-ray of the chest/abdomen. This is the most reliable means of ensuring proper placement of an NG tube. The use of a chest x-ray to confirm position is the expected standard in the UK, with Dr/ physician review and confirmation. Future techniques may include measuring the concentration of enzymes such as trypsin, pepsin, and bilirubin to confirm the correct placement of the NG tube. As enzyme testing becomes more practical, allowing measurements to be taken quickly and cheaply at the bedside, this technique may be used in combination with pH testing as an effective, less harmful replacement of X-ray confirmation. If the tube is to remain in place then a tube position check is recommended before each feed and at least once per day. Only smaller diameter (12 Fr or less in adults) nasogastric tubes are appropriate for long-term feeding, so as to avoid irritation and erosion of the nasal mucosa. These tubes often have guidewires to facilitate insertion. If feeding is required for a longer period of time, other options, such as placement of a PEG tube, should be considered. Function of an NG tube properly placed and used for suction is maintained by flushing. This may be done by flushing small amounts of saline and air using a syringe or by flushing larger amounts of saline or water, and air, and then assessing for the air to circulate through one lumen of the tube, into the stomach, and out the other lumen. When these two techniques of flushing were compared, the latter was more effective. Contraindications The use of nasogastric intubation is contraindicated in patients with moderate-to-severe neck and facial fractures due to the increased risk of airway obstruction or improper tube placement. Special attention is necessary during insertion under these circumstances in order to avoid undue trauma to the esophagus. There is also a greater risk to patients suffering from bleeding disorders, particularly those resulting from the distended sub-mucosal veins in the lower third of the esophagus known as esophageal varices which may be easily ruptured due to their friability and also in GERD. Alternative measures, such as an orogastric intubation, should be considered under these circumstances, or if the patient will be incapable of meeting their nutritional and caloric needs for an extended time period (usually >24 hours). Complications Minor complications include nose bleeds, sinusitis, and a sore throat. Sometimes more significant complications occur including erosion of the nose where the tube is anchored, esophageal perforation, damage to a surgical anastomosis, pulmonary aspiration, a collapsed lung, or intracranial placement of the tube.

She was a prominent member of a group of American composers known as the \\"ultramoderns,\\" and her music influenced later composers including Elliott Carter . Background (1901‚Äì1921) Ruth Crawford was born in East Liverpool, Ohio, the second child of Clark Crawford, a Methodist minister, and Clara Graves Crawford. The family moved several times during Crawford's childhood, living in Akron, Ohio, St. Louis, Missouri, and Muncie, Indiana. In 1912, the family moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where Clark Crawford died of tuberculosis two years later. After her husband's death, Clara Crawford opened a boarding house and struggled to maintain her family's middle-class lifestyle . Ruth began writing poetry at an early age and as a teenager had aspirations to become an \\"authoress or poetess\\" . She also studied the piano beginning at age six. In 1913, she began piano lessons with Bertha Foster, who had founded the School of Musical Art in Jacksonville in 1908. In 1917, Ruth began to study with Madame Valborg Collett, who was a student of Agathe Gr√∏ndahl and the most prestigious teacher at Foster's School of Musical Art . After her graduation from high school in 1918, Crawford began to pursue a career as a concert pianist, continuing her studies with Collett and performing at various musical events in Jacksonville. She also became a piano teacher at Foster's school and wrote her first compositions for her young pupils in 1918 and 1919 . Career (1921‚Äì1953) =Chicago (1921‚Äì1929)= Crawford moved to Chicago in 1921 where she enrolled at the American Conservatory of Music, initially planning to stay for a single year, long enough to earn a teaching certificate. In Chicago, she attended symphony and opera performances for the first time as well as recitals by eminent pianists including Sergei Rachmaninoff and Arthur Rubinstein . At the Conservatory, she studied piano with Heniot Levy and Louise Robyn. Crawford's focus at the Conservatory quickly shifted from piano performance to composition. During her second year there, she began composition and theory studies with Adolf Weidig and wrote several early works, including a Nocturne for Violin and Piano (1923) and a set of theme and variations for piano (1923). Clara Crawford moved to Chicago to live with her daughter in 1923. The next year, Ruth received her bachelor's degree in music from the Conservatory and subsequently enrolled in the school's master's degree program . While Crawford continued to study theory and composition with Weidig at the American Conservatory of Music through 1929, in 1924 she also began private piano lessons with Djane Lavoie-Herz. Herz, one of the most prestigious piano teachers in Chicago at the time, had a profound impact on Crawford's intellectual and musical life. Herz sparked Crawford's interest in theosophy and the music of Alexander Scriabin, and introduced her pupil to an influential community of artists and thinkers. Through Herz, Crawford met Dane Rudhyar and Henry Cowell, composers who would both have a significant impact on Crawford's music and career . During this time, Crawford also met the leading Chicago poet Carl Sandburg whose writings she eventually set to music. =New York (1929‚Äì1936)= Crawford Seeger married Charles Seeger in 1935 Crawford spent the summer of 1929 at the MacDowell Colony on a scholarship, where she began a friendship with fellow composer Marion Bauer and began work on her Five Songs set to poems by Sandburg . In the fall of that year, Crawford moved into the New York home of music patron Blanche Walton and began studying composition with Charles Seeger. In 1930, she became the first female composer to receive the Guggenheim Fellowship and went to Berlin and Paris (Hisama 2001, 3; Tick 2001). She inquired about a renewal of her fellowship several times over the course of the next year, but was ultimately refused a renewal. During that time, she interviewed Emil Hertzka to discuss publishing her music, but he said \\"it would be particularly hard for a woman to get anything published.\\" Crawford subsequently travelled to Vienna and Budapest to meet with notable composers Alban Berg and B√©la Bart√≥k, respectively, to discuss her music and gain support for publication. Though surrounded by exponents of German modernism, she chose to study and compose alone. Seeger's ideas, communicated by letter, were crucial to the development of her style and selections. She and Charles Seeger married in 1932 after her subsequent trip to Paris. At the International Society for Contemporary Music Festival in Amsterdam (1933), her Three Songs for voice, oboe, percussion and strings represented the United States . =Washington (1936‚Äì1953)= Crawford Seeger worked closely with Alan Lomax (pictured) and John Lomax, his father Crawford Seeger and her family moved to Washington, D.C., in 1936 after Charles' appointment to the music division of the Resettlement Administration. There Crawford Seeger worked closely with John and Alan Lomax at the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress to preserve and teach American folk music. Her arrangements and interpretations of American traditional folk songs are among the most respected. These include transcriptions for American Folk Songs for Children, Animal Folk Songs for Children (1950), American Folk Songs for Christmas (1953), Our Singing Country, and Folk Song USA by John and Alan Lomax. However, she is best known for Our Singing Country (1941). She also composed \\"Rissolty, Rossolty\\"‚ÄìAn American Fantasy for Orchestra based on folk tunes, for the CBS radio series The American School of the Air. She briefly returned to her modernist roots in early 1952 with Suite for Wind Quintet . In 1953, she died from intestinal cancer, in Chevy Chase, Maryland. She was buried at the Springfield Cemetery in Springfield, Massachusetts . Family Crawford Seeger passed on folk music to daughter Peggy Seeger ‚Äì still influential in folk music In 1932, she married Charles Seeger. Their children, including Mike Seeger, Peggy Seeger, Barbara, Penny, and older stepson Pete Seeger, knew their mother as \\"Dio\\". Several of the children as musical artists themselves became central to the American folk revival, but they had little knowledge of their mother's former life as a beacon of American ultramodernism . Composition Crawford Seeger was influenced by Alexander Scriabin The compositions that Crawford Seeger wrote in Chicago from 1924‚Äì1929 reflect the influence of Alexander Scriabin, Dane Rudhyar, and her piano teacher Djane Lavoie-Herz. Judith Tick calls these years Crawford Seeger's \\"first distinctive style period\\" and writes that the composer's music during this time \\"might be termed 'post-tonal pluralism'\\" . Her compositions from this first style period, including Five Preludes for Piano, Sonata for Violin and Piano, Suite No. 2 for Strings and Piano, and Five Songs on Sandburg Poems (1929), are marked by strident dissonance, irregular rhythms, and evocations of spirituality . Crawford Seeger's reputation as a composer rests chiefly on her New York compositions written between 1930 and 1933, which exploit dissonant counterpoint and American serial techniques. During these years Crawford began to incorporate polytonality and tone clusters into her compositions . She was one of the first composers to extend serial processes to musical elements other than pitch and to develop formal plans based on serial operations . Her technique may have been influenced by the music of Schoenberg, although they met only briefly during her studies in Germany. Many of her works from this period employ dissonant counterpoint, a theoretical compositional system developed by Charles Seeger and used by Henry Cowell, Johanna Beyer, and others. Seeger outlined his methodology for dissonant counterpoint in his treatise, Tradition and Experiment in (the New) Music, which he wrote with the input and assistance of Crawford during the summer of 1930 . Crawford Seeger's contribution to the book was significant enough that the possibility of co-authorship was briefly raised . String Quartet 1931, particularly the third movement, is Crawford Seeger's most famous and influential work. The composer described the \\"underlying plan\\" of the third movement as \\"a heterophony of dynamics‚Äîa sort of counterpoint of crescendi and diminuendi. [‚Ä¶] The melodic line grows out of this continuous increase and decrease; it is given, one tone at a time, to different instruments, and each new melodic tone is brought in at the high point in a crescendo\\". The dynamic slides create the lengthy melody that spans the entire movement and shape the narrative arc.

The Discworld version of Hell or Pandemonium exists simply because some people believe that it exists for them. In other Discworld stories, such as Small Gods, the afterlife is different or non-existent, according to the various beliefs. Rincewind wakes in a strange place, having been summoned by the 13-year-old demonologist, Eric Thursley, who wants the mastery of all kingdoms, to meet the most beautiful woman who ever existed, and to live forever. He is disappointed when Rincewind tells him he is unable to deliver any of these things, and embarrassed when Rincewind sees through his disguise. Rincewind is disheartened to learn that the spells to confine the demon summoned are working on him; Eric's parrot tells him that because he was summoned as a demon, he is subject to the same terms. The arrival of Rincewind's Luggage causes Eric to suspect deceit on Rincewind's part. Eric's demands are renewed; he makes three wishes of Rincewind. Rincewind insists he cannot grant wishes with the snap of a finger, and discovers to his horror that snapping his fingers really does work. * To be Ruler of the World. Eric and Rincewind find themselves in the rain forests of Klatch, in the Tezumen empire, a parody of the Aztec Empire. The local people come forward to pay tribute to Eric and declare him Ruler of the World. During this tribute, Rincewind and the parrot explore the temple of Quezovercoatl (a parody of Quetzalcoatl), where they find a prisoner, Ponce da Quirm (a parody of Juan Ponce de Le√≥n), who is to be sacrificed. Da Quirm tells Rincewind about the terrible fate the Tezumen have planned for the Ruler of the World, on whom they blame all life's misfortunes. Shortly, Rincewind, Eric and da Quirm find themselves tied up at the top of a pyramid, waiting to be sacrificed, when Quezovercoatl makes his appearance. Unfortunately for him, the Luggage also makes an appearance, trampling the six-inch-tall Quezovercoatl in the process. The Tezumen are pleased to see Quezovercoatl destroyed, release the prisoners, and enshrine the luggage in the place of their god. At the end of the book, the Tezumen are revealed to have abandoned worshipping the Luggage as well (since it never returned) and turned atheist, \\"which still allowed them to kill anyone they wanted, but they didn't have to get up so early to do it\\". * To Meet the Most Beautiful Woman in All History. Rincewind snaps his fingers again, and they find themselves in a large wooden horse (a parody of the Trojan Horse). Exiting, they are surrounded by Tsortean soldiers, who take them for an Ephebian invasion force. Rincewind manages to talk their way out from the guards and out of the city, only to fall into the hands of the invading army. Rincewind and Eric are taken to Lavaeolus, the man who built the horse‚Äîhaving sent the horse in as a decoy so that he and his men could sneak in around the back while their enemies waited around the horse for them to come out‚Äîwho tells them off in ironic fashion, for 'spoiling the war'. They reenter Tsort through a secret passage, and find Elenor (a parody of Helen of Troy). Both Eric and Lavaeolus are disappointed to find that it has been a long siege, and Elenor is now a plump mother of several children, with the beginnings of a moustache, and that serious artistic licence had been taken in her description. The Ephebians escape the city while Tsort burns, and Lavaeolus and his army set out for home, with Lavaeolus complaining about voyages by sea (further reference to the Iliad and subsequent Odyssey). Eric notes that \\"Lavaeolus\\" in Ephebian translates to \\"Rinser of Winds\\", hinting that perhaps Lavaeolus is a relative of Rincewind. * To Live Forever. Rincewind snaps his fingers, bringing Eric and him outside time, just before the beginning of existence. Rincewind meets the Creator, who is just forming the Discworld and is having trouble finishing some of the animals. Rincewind and Eric are left on the newly formed world, with the realization that \\"to live forever\\" means to live for all time, from start to finish. To escape, Rincewind has Eric reverse his summoning, taking them both to hell. They discover hell steeped in bureaucracy, the Demon King Astfgl having decided that boredom might be the ultimate form of torture. Rincewind uses his university experience to confuse the demons, so he and Eric can try to escape. While crossing through the recently reformed levels of hell (satirical forms of Dante's Inferno) they encounter da Quirm and the parrot, as well as Lavaeolus, who tells them where the exit is. The source of Rincewind's demonic powers is revealed to be Lord Vassenego, a Demon Lord leading a secret revolt against Astfgl. Using Rincewind to keep Astfgl occupied while gathering support amongst the demons, Vassenego confronts his king just as Astfgl finally catches up to Rincewind and Eric.

The complex interplay between these two traditions, and between both of them and other poetries in English and Scottish Gaelic, has produced a body of work that is both rich in variety and difficult to categorise. The earliest surviving poems in Irish date back to the 6th century, while the first known poems in English from Ireland date to the 14th century. Although there has always been some cross-fertilization between the two language traditions, an English-language poetry that had absorbed themes and models from Irish did not finally emerge until the 19th century. This culminated in the work of the poets of the Irish Literary Revival in the late 19th and early 20th century. Towards the last quarter of the 20th century, modern Irish poetry tended to a wide range of diversity, from the poets of the Northern school to writers influenced by the modernist tradition and those facing the new questions posed by an increasingly urban and cosmopolitan society. Early Irish poetry Literacy reached Ireland with Christianity in the fifth century. Monasteries were established, which by the seventh century were large, self-governing institutions and centres of scholarship. This was to have a profound effect on Irish-language literature, poetry included.Dillon, Myles & Chadwick, Nora. The Celtic Realms. Cardinal, London, 1973: pp. 219-291. The earliest Irish poetry was unrhymed, and has been described as follows: ‚ÄúIt is alliterative syllabic verse, lyric in form and heroic in content, in praise of famous men, or in lament for the death of a hero‚Äù. It survived as epic interludes in Irish sagas in the early Modern Period. The monastic poets borrowed from both native and Latin traditions to create elaborate syllabic verse forms, and used them for religious and nature poetry. The typical combination of end-rhyme, internal rhyme and alliteration came originally from the example of late Latin hymns, as elaborated by Irish monks. The new metres are the vehicle for monastic lyric poems inspired by love of Nature, love of solitude and love of the Divine which have been described as the finest Irish poetry of their age, and which could be extended to cover more personal concerns.Dillon, Myles & Chadwick, Nora. The Celtic Realms. Cardinal, London, 1973: pp. 185-190. An example is a long poem which is put into the mouth of Marb√°n the hermit, brother of Guaire, king of Connacht, and of which the following is an excerpt: :: Fogur ga√≠the :: fri fid flescach, :: forglas n√©ol; :: essa aba, :: esnad ala, :: √°lainn c√©ol. Sound of the wind in a branching wood, grey cloud; river- falls, cry of a swan ‚Äì beautiful music. The professional secular poets continued to praise and lament famous men, but adopted the new verse forms, which in time would be codified in classical form under the name D√°n D√≠reach. Medieval/Early modern Irish bards formed a professional hereditary caste of highly trained, learned poets. The bards were steeped in the history and traditions of clan and country, as well as in the technical requirements of a verse technique that was syllabic and used assonance, half rhyme and alliteration known as D√°n D√≠reach. As officials of the court of king or chieftain, they performed a number of official roles. They were chroniclers and satirists whose job it was to praise their employers and damn those who crossed them. It was believed that a well-aimed bardic satire, glam dicin, could raise boils on the face of its target. However, much of their work would not strike the modern reader as being poetry at all, consisting as it does of extended genealogies and almost journalistic accounts of the deeds of their lords and ancestors. The Metrical Dindshenchas, or Lore of Places, is probably the major surviving monument of Irish bardic verse. It is a great onomastic anthology of naming legends of significant places in the Irish landscape and comprises about 176 poems in total. The earliest of these date from the 11th century, and were probably originally compiled on a provincial basis. As a national compilation, the Metrical Dindshenchas has come down to us in two different recensions. Knowledge of the real or putative history of local places formed an important part of the education of the elite in ancient Ireland, so the Dindshenchas was probably a kind of textbook in origin. Verse tales of Fionn and the Fianna, sometimes known as Ossianic poetry, were extremely common in Ireland and Scotland throughout this period. Originally sung in verse and exactly on par with heroic epics from other cultures, they were written down and significantly altered by James Macpherson in the 18th century. Macpherson's treatment of them was said to have ushured in the Romance tradition as opposed to the epic nature of the sagas. The Fionn poems form one of the three key sagas of Celtic culture: The Ulster saga, Fionn mac Cumhaill saga, and those of the Arthurian legends. British Library Manuscript, Harley 913, is a group of poems written in Ireland in the early 14th century. They are usually called the Kildare Poems because of their association with that county. Both poems and manuscript have strong Franciscan associations and are full of ideas from the wider Western European Christian tradition. They also represent the early stages of the second tradition of Irish poetry, that of poetry in the English language, as they were written in Middle English. During the Elizabethan reconquest, two of the most significant English poets of the time saw service in the Irish colonies. Sir Walter Raleigh had little impact on the course of Irish literature, but the time spent in Munster by Edmund Spenser was to have serious consequences both for his own writings and for the future course of cultural development in Ireland. Spenser's relationship with Ireland was somewhat ambiguous. On the one hand, an idealised Munster landscape forms the backdrop for much of the action for his masterpiece, The Faerie Queene. On the other, he condemned Ireland and everything Irish as barbaric in his prose polemic A View of the Present State of Ireland. In A View, he describes the Irish bards as being: Given that the bards depended on aristocratic support to survive, and that this power and patronage was shifting towards the new English rulers, this thorough condemnation of their moral values may well have contributed to their demise as a caste. Gaelic poetry in the 17th century The Battle of Kinsale in 1601 saw the defeat of Aodh M√≥r √ì N√©ill, despite his alliance with the Spanish, and the ultimate victory in the Elizabethan conquest of Ireland came with his surrender to crown authority in 1603. In consequence, the system of education and patronage that underpinned the professional bardic schools came under pressure, and the hereditary poets eventually engaged in a spat - the Contention of the bards - that marked the end of their ancient influence. During the early 17th century a new Gaelic poetry took root, one that sought inspiration in the margins of a dispossessed Irish-speaking society. The language of this poetry is today called Early Modern Irish. Although some 17th-century poets continued to enjoy a degree of patronage, many, if not most, of them were part-time writers who also worked on the land, as teachers, and anywhere that they could earn their keep. Their poetry also changed, with a move away from the syllabic verse of the schools to accentual metres, reflecting the oral poetry of the bardic period. A good deal of the poetry of this period deals with political and historical themes that reflect the poets' sense of a world lost. The poets adapted to the new English dominated order in several ways. Some of them continued to find patronage among the Gaelic Irish and Old English aristocracy. Some of the English landowners settled in Ireland after the Plantations of Ireland also patronised Irish poets, for instance George Carew and Roger Boyle. Other members of hereditary bardic families sent their sons to the new Irish Colleges that had been set up in Catholic Europe for the education of Irish Catholics, who were not permitted to found schools or universities at home. Much of the Irish poetry of the 17th century was therefore composed by Catholic clerics and Irish society fell increasingly under Counter-Reformation influences. By mid-century, the subordination of the native Catholic upper classes in Ireland boiled over in the Irish Rebellion of 1641. Many Irish language poets wrote highly politicised poetry in support of the Irish Catholics organised in Confederate Ireland. For instance, the cleric poet P√°draig√≠n Haic√©ad wrote, √âirigh mo Dh√∫iche le Dia (\\"Arise my Country with God\\") in support of the rebellion, which advised that :Caithfidh fir √âireann uile :o haicme go haonduine... :gliec na timcheall no tuitim (\\"All Irishmen from one person to all people must unite or fall\\") Another of Haic√©ad's poems Muscail do mhisneach a Banbha (\\"Gather your courage oh Ireland\\") in 1647 encouraged the Irish Catholic war effort in the Irish Confederate Wars. It expressed the opinion that Catholics should not tolerate Protestantism in Ireland, :Creideamh Chr√≠ost le creideamh L√∫iteir... :ladgadh gris i sneachta sud (The religion of Christ with the religion of Luther is like ashes in the snow\\") Following the defeat of the Irish Catholics in the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (1649‚Äì53), and the destruction of the old Irish landed classes, many poets wrote mourning the fallen order or lamenting the destruction and repression of the Cromwellian conquest. The anonymous poem an Siogai Romanach went, :Ag so an cogadh do chriochnaigh √âire :s do chuir na milte ag iarri dearca... :Do rith plaig is gorta in aonacht (\\"This was the war that finished Ireland and put thousands begging, plague and famine ran together\\") Another poem by √âamonn an D√∫na is a strange mixture of Irish, French and English, :Le execution bh√≠os s√∫il an cheidir :costas buinte na chuine ag an ndeanach (The first thing a man expects is execution, the last that costs be awarded against him [in court]\\") :Transport transplant, mo mheabhair ar Bh√©arla :(\\"Transport transplant, is what I remember of English\\") :A tory, hack him, hang him, a rebel, :a rogue, a thief a priest, a papist After this period, the poets lost most of their patrons and protectors. In the subsequent Williamite War in Ireland Catholic Jacobites tried to recover their position by supporting James II. D√°ibhi √ì Bruadair wrote many poems in praise of the Jacobite war effort and in particular of his hero, Patrick Sarsfield. The poets viewed the war as revenge against the Protestant settlers who had come to dominate Ireland, as the following poem extract makes clear, : \\"You Popish rogue\\", ni leomhaid a labhairt sinn :acht \\"Cromwellian dog\\" is focal faire againn :no \\" cia sud thall\\" go teann gan eagla :\\"Mise Tadhg\\" geadh teinn an t-agallamh (\\"You Popish rogue\\" is not spoken, but \\"Cromwellian dog\\" is our watchword, \\"Who goes there\\" does not provoke fear, \\"I am Tadhg\\" [an Irishman] is the answer given\\") From Diarmuid Mac Carthaigh, C√©ad buidhe re Dia (\\"A hundred victories with God\\"). The Jacobites' defeat in the War, and in particular James II's ignominious flight after the Battle of the Boyne, gave rise to the following derisive verse, :S√©amus an chaca a chaill √âire, :lena leathbhr√≥g ghallda is a leathbhr√≥g Ghaelach (\\"James the shit who lost Ireland, with his one shoe English and one shoe Irish\\") The main poets of this period include D√°ibh√≠ √ì Bruadair (1625?‚Äì1698), Piaras Feirit√©ar (1600?‚Äì1653) and Aog√°n √ì Rathaille (1675‚Äì1729). √ì Rathaille belongs as much to the 18th as the 17th century and his work, including the introduction of the aisling genre, marks something of a transition to a post-Battle of the Boyne Ireland. =Women poets= The first part of the seventeenth century saw three notable women poets (all born in the century before). Brighid Nic Gearailt (Brighid Chill Dara) (c. 1589-1682) was the wife of Rudhraighe √ì Domhnaill, one of the northern lords who left Ireland as part of the Flight of the Earls. Her sole surviving work is A Mhacaoimh Dhealbhas an D√°n, a witty and elegant reply in classical metre to a verse letter sent to her on behalf of C√∫ Chonnacht √ìg M√°g Uidhir by Eochaidh √ì hEoghusa, a notable poet of the time.Bourke, Angela (ed.). The Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing, Volume 4. NYU Press, 2002: pp. 395-405. Fionnghuala N√≠ Bhriain (Inghean Dhomhnaill U√≠ Bhriain) (c. 1557-1657), a relative of the Earls of Thomond, wrote a lament (her only surviving poem) for her husband Uaithne √ì Lochlainn, lord of the Burren in County Clare. Caitil√≠n Dubh (fl. 1624), whose patrons were the O‚ÄôBriens, wrote for them a series of laments in the new accentual metres. The 18th century The eighteenth century saw the flourishing of highly literate, technically adept poets in the Irish language. This period saw the triumph of popular accentual metres, as opposed to the elaborate syllabic metres which had prevailed until then. These accentual metres, however, still featured a complex system of internal rhymes, and it is likely that they had been in use for some centuries previously. The poets themselves seldom had patrons to support them and supported themselves with such occupations as farming or teaching. A salient figure at this time is Aog√°n √ì Rathaille (1670-1726), a bridge between the old world in which he was educated and the new one in which the professional poet had no place. He wrote in the new metres but preserved the attitudes of a previous age.Williams, J.E. Caerwyn & N√≠ Mhuir√≠osa, M√°ir√≠n. Traidisi√∫n Liteartha na nGael. An Cl√≥chomhar Tta, 1979: pp. 273-304 Dublin was a centre of Irish-language poetry in the first half of the eighteenth century, due to the presence there of Se√°n √ì Neachtain, his son Tadhg and the circle of writers they gathered around them. Se√°n wrote both in Irish and English, but Irish was his primary language and he wrote poems in it of many kinds ‚Äì Fenian poems, love poems, drinking songs, satires and religious poems. In 1728 Tadhg wrote a poem in which there is a description of the members of the √ì Neachtain literary circle: twenty six people are mentioned, mostly from Leinster but with others from every province. Outside Dublin, it was in the province of Munster that the status and craft of Irish-language poetry were best maintained. Sometimes a member of the local gentry acted as a patron, but in other places responsibility lay with c√∫irteanna fil√≠ochta ‚Äì ‚Äúcourts of poetry‚Äù or local gatherings of poets, most of whom were men. These could be seen as offshoots of the bardic academies which trained professional poets down to the seventeenth century. The best-known members of this network of poets included Se√°n √ì Tuama (c. 1706-1775), Aindrias Mac Craith (died c. 1795), Liam Ruadh Mac Coitir and Se√°n √ì Murchadha (Se√°n na R√°ith√≠neach). Their poetry illuminates daily life and personalities of the period ‚Äì landlord and tenant, the priest and the teacher, the poet and the craftsman, the marketplace, marriage and burial, music and folklore. The craft of poetry was also cultivated in south Ulster, where poets would come together to compete for primacy. They included a handful of women, including M√°ire (or Mailligh) Nic a Liondain and Peig N√≠ Chuarta. Among the most prominent names in Munster is Eoghan Rua √ì S√∫illeabh√°in, schoolmaster, sailor, soldier, and a rake by reputation. His verse was highly finished and intensely musical, and he was best known for his vision poems. This genre was parodied by Brian Merriman in his long comic poem C√∫irt An Mhe√°n O√≠che, in which a young woman complains to Aoibheall, a fairy queen, about the men of Ireland.Merriman, Brian. C√∫irt an Mhe√°n O√≠che, D√°ith√≠ √ì hUaithne (ed.). Preas Dolmen, 1974 (reprint). . Alongside the work of the literate poets there flourished a traditional oral literature. One of its products was the caoineadh or traditional lament, a genre dominated by women and typically characterised by improvisation and passion. Countless numbers were composed; one of the few to have survived is Caoineadh Airt U√≠ Laoghaire. This was mostly composed by a member of the surviving Catholic gentry of Cork, Eibhl√≠n Dubh N√≠ Chonaill (an aunt of Daniel O‚ÄôConnell), for her husband Art, killed by a local British official. It is considered to be an outstanding example of the type.√ì Tuama, Se√°n (ed.). Caoineadh Airt U√≠ Laoghaire. An Cl√≥chomhar Tta. 1979 (reprint). =Swift and Goldsmith= Oliver Goldsmith In Jonathan Swift (1667‚Äì1745), Irish literature in English found its first notable writer. Although best known for prose works like Gulliver's Travels and A Tale of a Tub, Swift was a poet of considerable talent. Technically close to his English contemporaries Pope and Dryden, Swift's poetry evinces the same tone of savage satire, and horror of the human body and its functions that characterises much of his prose. Swift also published translations of poems from the Irish. Oliver Goldsmith (1730?‚Äì1774) started his literary career as a hack writer in London, writing on any subject that would pay enough to keep his creditors at bay. He came to belong to the circle of Samuel Johnson, Edmund Burke and Sir Joshua Reynolds. His reputation depends mainly on a novel, The Vicar of Wakefield, a play, She Stoops to Conquer, and two long poems, The Traveller and The Deserted Village. The last of these may be the first and best poem by an Irish poet in the English pastoral tradition. It has been variously interpreted as a lament for the death of Irish village life under British rule and a protest at the effects of agricultural reform on the English rural landscape. =Weaver Poets and vernacular writing= Local cultural differences in areas such as north and east Ulster produced minor, and often only loosely associated, vernacular movements that do not readily fit into the categories of Irish or English literature. For example, the Ulster Weaver Poets wrote in an Ulster Scots dialect. Working-class or popular in nature, remaining examples are mostly limited to publication in self-published privately subscribed limited print runs, newspapers, journals of the time.Charles Jones, The Edinburgh History of the Scots Language p594ff (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1997) The promotion of standard English in education gradually reduced the visibility and influence of such movements. In addition, the polarising effects of the politics of the use of English and Irish language traditions also limited academic and public interest until the studies of John Hewitt from the 1950s onwards. Further impetus was given by more generalised exploration of non-\\"Irish\\" and non-\\"English\\" cultural identities in the latter decades of the 20th Century. The 19th century During the course of the 19th century, political and economic factors resulted in the decline of the Irish language and the concurrent rise of English as the main language of Ireland. This fact is reflected in the poetry of the period. The folk tradition of poetry in Irish (usually expressed in song) retained its vigour in the 19th century, often combing assonance and alliteration to considerable effect. Songs of all sorts were common in Irish-speaking areas before Ireland's Great Famine of the 1840s - love songs such as D√≥nall √ìg and √öna Bh√°n, songs about the ancient heroes of the Fianna, working songs, religious songs, laments, humorous and satirical songs, lullabies and children's songs. Songs of the supernatural (changelings, revenants, spirits) were also popular. Patriotic songs were rare.Gearoid √ì hAllmhur√°in, ‚ÄúThe Great Famine: A Catalyst in Irish Traditional Music Making‚Äù in Gribben, Arthur (ed.). The Great Famine and the Diaspora.

The Great Famine, with its material and sociological consequences, had a considerable effect on Irish music. The number of Irish speakers declined because of death or emigration. There was a radical shift in land use, with tillage giving way to pasture, which was less labour-intensive. Songs to do with ploughing, reaping and sowing could no longer be sustained. There were, however, contemporary songs in Irish about the Famine itself, such as An Drochshaol (from West Cork). Amhr√°n na bPr√°ta√≠ Dubha (from County Waterford) and Johnny Seoighe (from Conamara). There was already an Irish tradition of songs in English. This included English songs, Lowland Scottish songs and ballads which were printed in England and sold in Ireland, such as Lord Baker, Captain Wedderburn‚Äôs Courtship and Barbara Allen, together with political ballads of Irish origin. After the Famine and with the loss of Irish speakers, such songs became dominant. The interactive relationship between Irish and English is evident in the songs composed in English by Irish- speaking hedge school masters from the late 18th century on. These songs (some of which were parodies) often had a Latinate vocabulary. It has been said that they had a style \\"which, while capable of descending to the ridiculous, could also rise to the sublime‚Äù.Julie Henigan, ‚ÄúFor Want of Education: The origins of the Hedge Schoolmaster songs,‚Äù Ulster Folklife, No 40 (1994): pp 27-38: https://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/hedg_sch.htm These songs and others often reproduced the metre and internal rhymes of songs in Irish: :Now to end my lamentation we are all in consternation :For want of education, I now must end my song, :Since without hesitation we are charged with combination :And sent for transportation from the hills of Mullaghbawn. Antoine √ì Raifteiri (Anthony Raftery) (1784‚Äì1835) is a recognized Irish-language folk poet of the pre- Famine period. But the tradition of literate composition persisted. The Kerry poet Tom√°s Rua √ì S√∫illeabh√°in (1785-1848) was a schoolmaster and dancing master; the Cork poet M√≠che√°l √ìg √ì Long√°in (1766-1837) was a well-known copier of manuscripts. Paradoxically, as soon as English became the dominant language of Irish poetry, the poets began to mine the Irish-language heritage as a source of themes and techniques. J. J. Callanan (1795‚Äì1829) was born in Cork and died at a young age in Lisbon. Unlike many other more visibly nationalist poets who would follow later, he knew Irish well, and several of his poems are loose versions of Irish originals. Although extremely close to Irish materials, he was also profoundly influenced by Byron and his peers; possibly his finest poem, the title work of The Recluse of Inchidony and Other Poems (1829), was written in Spenserian stanzas that were clearly inspired by Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. The best-known Irish poet to draw upon Irish themes in the first half of the 19th century was probably Thomas Moore (1779‚Äì1852), although he had no knowledge of, and little respect for, the Irish language. He attended Trinity College Dublin at the same time as the revolutionary Robert Emmet, who was executed in 1803. Moore's most enduring work, Irish Melodies, was popular with English readers. They contain stereotyped images but helped in the development of a distinctive English-language poetic tradition in Ireland. In 1842, Charles Gavan Duffy (1816‚Äì1903), Thomas Davis, (1814‚Äì1845), and John Blake Dillon (1816‚Äì1866) founded The Nation to agitate for reform of British rule. The group of politicians and writers associated with The Nation came to be known as the Young Irelanders. The magazine published verse, including work by Duffy and Davis, whose A Nation Once Again is still popular among Irish Nationalists. However, the most significant poet associated with The Nation was undoubtedly James Clarence Mangan (1803‚Äì1849). Mangan was a true po√®te maudit, who threw himself into the role of bard, and even included translations of bardic poems in his publications. Another poet who supported the Young Irelanders, although not directly connected with them, was Samuel Ferguson (1810-1886). Ferguson once wrote that his ambition was \\"to raise the native elements of Irish history to a dignified level.\\" To this end, he wrote many verse retellings of the Old Irish sagas. He also wrote a moving elegy to Thomas Davis. Ferguson, who believed that Ireland's political fate ultimately lay within the Union, brought a new scholarly exactitude to the study and translation of Irish texts. William Allingham (1824-1889) was another important Unionist figure in Irish poetry. Born and bred in Ballyshannon, Donegal, he spent most of his working life in England and was associated with the Pre-Raphaelite movement, and a close friend of Tennyson. His Day and Night Songs was illustrated by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais. His most important work is the long poem, Laurence Bloomfield in Ireland (1864), a realist narrative which wittily and movingly deals with the land agitation in Ireland during the period. He was also known for his work as a collector of folk ballads in both Ireland and England. Ferguson's research opened the way for many of the achievements of the Celtic Revival, especially those of W. B. Yeats (1865‚Äì1939) and Douglas Hyde (1860‚Äì1949), but this narrative of Irish poetry which leads to the Revival as culmination can also be deceptive and occlude important poetry, such as the work of James Henry (1798‚Äì1876), medical doctor, Virgil scholar and poet. His large body of work was completely overlooked until Christopher Ricks included him in two anthologies, and eventually edited a selection of his poetry. =The Celtic revival= Probably the most significant poetic movement of the second half of the 19th century was French Symbolism. This movement inevitably influenced Irish writers, not least Oscar Wilde (1845‚Äì1900). Although Wilde is best known for his plays, fiction, and The Ballad of Reading Gaol, he also wrote poetry in a symbolist vein and was the first Irish writer to experiment with prose poetry. However, the overtly cosmopolitan Wilde was not to have much influence on the future course of Irish writing. W. B. Yeats was much more influential in the long run. Yeats, too, was influenced by his French contemporaries but consciously focused on an identifiably Irish content. As such, he was partly responsible for the establishment of the literary movement known as the Celtic Revival. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923. Apart from Yeats, much of the impetus for the Celtic Revival came from the work of scholarly translators who were aiding in the discovery of both the ancient sagas and Ossianic poetry and the more recent folk song tradition in Irish. One of the most significant of these was Douglas Hyde, later the first President of Ireland, whose Love Songs of Connacht was widely admired. The 20th century =Yeats and modernism= In the 1910s, Yeats became acquainted with the work of James Joyce, and worked closely with Ezra Pound, who served as his personal secretary for a time. Through Pound, Yeats also became familiar with the work of a range of prominent modernist poets. From his 1916 book Responsibilities and Other Poems onwards his work, while not entirely meriting the label modernist, became much more hard-edged than it had been. Modernism, with its emphasis on technical and intellectual innovation, was to influence early 20th-century Irish poets writing both in English and Irish. Among them were those associated with the Easter Rising of 1916. Three of the Republican leadership, P√°draig Pearse (1879‚Äì1916) (who wrote in Irish), Joseph Mary Plunkett (1879‚Äì1916) and Thomas MacDonagh (1878‚Äì1916), were noted poets. Much of their verse is Catholic and Nationalist in outlook, but their work is of considerable historical interest. Pearse, in particular, shows the influence of his contact with the work of Walt Whitman. Individual from these groups is the Boyne Valley \\"peasant poet\\" Francis Ledwidge, who was pressured by the Irish Volunteers into enlisting in the British Army during World War I. After years of fighting as he believed for the rights of small nations like his own, Ledwidge was \\"blown to bits\\" by a German artillery shell during the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917. However, it was to be Yeats' earlier Celtic mode that was to be most influential. Amongst the most prominent followers of the early Yeats were P√°draic Colum (1881‚Äì1972), F. R. Higgins (1896‚Äì1941), and Austin Clarke (1896‚Äì1974). In the 1950s, Clarke, returning to poetry after a long absence, turned to a much more personal style and wrote many satires on Irish society and religious practices. Irish poetic Modernism took its lead not from Yeats but from Joyce. The 1930s saw the emergence of a generation of writers who engaged in experimental writing as a matter of course. The best-known of these is Samuel Beckett (1906‚Äì1989), who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1969. Beckett's poetry, while not inconsiderable, is not what he is best known for. The most significant of the second generation of Modernist Irish poets who first published in the 1920s and 1930s include Brian Coffey (1905‚Äì1995), Denis Devlin (1908‚Äì1959), Thomas MacGreevy (1893‚Äì1967), Blanaid Salkeld (1880‚Äì1959), and Mary Devenport O'Neill (1879‚Äì1967). Coffey's two late long poems Advent (1975) and Death of Hektor (1982) are perhaps his most important works; the latter deals with the theme of nuclear apocalypse through motifs from Greek mythology. It has been remarked that the work of Beckett, Devlin and MacGreevy displays the prime characteristics of the avant-garde: the problem of a disintegrating subjectivity; a lack of unity between the self and the society; and self-conscious literary pastiche.Francis Hutton-Williams, ‚ÄúAgainst Irish Modernism: Towards an Analysis of Experimental Irish Poetry,‚Äù Irish University Review 46.1 (2016): 20‚Äì37: https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/pdfplus/10.3366/iur.2016.0198 It has been said that the notion of an ‚ÄúIrish modernism‚Äù is challenged by the number of Irish writers who did not fully engage with modernist experiments, an apathy noted by Irish, continental and Anglo-American critics. There were still key experimental writers in Ireland during the 1930s (Kate O‚ÄôBrien, Elizabeth Bowen and others) whose work was marked by aesthetic self-consciousness and self-reflexiveness, but it could also be argued that much Irish writing was part of an international reaction against modernism. While Yeats and his followers wrote about an essentially aristocratic Gaelic Ireland, the reality was that the actual Ireland of the 1930s and 1940s was a society of small farmers and shopkeepers. From this environment emerged poets who rebelled against the example of Yeats, but who were not Modernist by inclination. Patrick Kavanagh (1904‚Äì1967), who came from a small farm, wrote about the narrowness and frustrations of rural life. John Hewitt (1907‚Äì1987), whom many consider to be the founding father of Northern Irish poetry, also came from a rural background but lived in Belfast and was amongst the first Irish poets to write of the sense of alienation that many at this time felt from both their original rural and new urban homes. Louis MacNeice (1907‚Äì1963), another Northern Irish poet, was associated with the left-wing politics of Michael Roberts's anthology New Signatures but was much less political a poet than W. H. Auden or Stephen Spender, for example. MacNeice's poetry was informed by his immediate interests and surroundings and is more social than political. In the South, the Republic of Ireland, a post-modernist generation of poets and writers emerged from the late 1950s onwards. Prominent among these writers were the poets Antony Cronin, Pearse Hutchinson, John Jordan, Thomas Kinsella and John Montague, most of whom were based in Dublin in the 1960s and 1970s. In Dublin a number of new literary magazines were founded in the 1960s: Poetry Ireland, Arena, The Lace Curtain, and in the 1970s, Cyphers. =The Northern School= It has been observed that, although there are poets from Northern Ireland, the concept of Northern poetry as a literary entity is problematic, being liable to political appropriations and because of the entwined literary relationships between North and South. Nevertheless, policies and institutions peculiar to each state could affect the writing of poetry in regional terms (e.g. the local availability of higher education).Manuela Palacios Gonz√°lez, ‚ÄúNorthern Ireland: The Poetry in Between,‚Äù in Postcolonial and Gender Perspectives in Irish Studies, Marisol Morales Ladr√≥n (ed.). Netbiblo 2007. In addition to John Hewitt, mentioned above, Northern poets of some importance included Robert Greacen (1920‚Äì2008) who, along with Valentin Iremonger, edited an important anthology, Contemporary Irish Poetry in 1949. Greacen was born in Derry, lived in Belfast in his youth and then in London during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. He won the Irish Times Prize for Poetry in 1995 for his Collected Poems, after he returned to live in Dublin when he was elected a member of Aosdana. Other poets of note from this time include Roy McFadden (1921‚Äì1999), a friend for many years of Greacen. Another Northern poet of note is Padraic Fiacc (born 1924), who was born in Belfast, but lived in America during his youth. In the 1960s, and coincident with the rise of the Troubles in the province, a number of Ulster poets began to receive critical and public notice. Prominent amongst these were John Montague (born 1929), Michael Longley (born 1939), Derek Mahon (born 1941), S√©amus Heaney (1939-2013) and Paul Muldoon (born 1951). Heaney was probably the best-known of these poets. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995, and served as Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory and Emerson Poet in Residence at Harvard, and as Professor of Poetry at Oxford. Derek Mahon was born in Belfast and worked as a journalist, editor, and screenwriter while publishing his first books. He has published comparatively little. Muldoon is Howard G. B. Clark '21 Professor in the Humanities at Princeton University. In 1999 he was also elected Professor of Poetry at the University of Oxford. =Experiment= In the late 1960s, two young Irish poets, Michael Smith (born 1942) and Trevor Joyce (born 1947) founded the New Writers Press publishing house and a journal called The Lace Curtain. Initially this was to publish their own work and that of some like- minded friends (including Paul Durcan, Michael Hartnett and Gerry Smyth), and later to promote the work of neglected Irish modernists like Brian Coffey and Denis Devlin. Both Joyce and Smith have published considerable bodies of poetry in their own right. Among the other poets published by the New Writers Press were Geoffrey Squires (born 1942), whose early work was influenced by Charles Olson, and Augustus Young (born 1943), who admired Pound and who has translated older Irish poetry, as well as work from Latin America and poems by Bertolt Brecht. Younger poets who write what might be called experimental poetry include Maurice Scully (born 1952), and Randolph Healy (born 1956). Many of these poets, along with younger experimentalists, have performed their work at the annual SoundEye Festival in Cork. =Outsiders= In addition to these two loose groupings, a number of prominent Irish poets of the second half of the 20th century could be described as outsiders, although these poets could also be considered leaders of a mainstream tradition in the Republic. These include Thomas Kinsella (born 1928), whose early work was influenced by Auden. Kinsella's later work exhibits the influence of Pound in its looser metrical structure and use of imagery but is deeply personal in manner and matter. John Jordan (1930‚Äì1988) was an Irish poet born in Dublin on 8 April 1930. He was a celebrated literary critic from the late 1950s until his death in June 1988 in Cardiff, Wales, where he had participated in the Merriman Summer School. Jordan was also a short-story writer, literary editor, poet and broadcaster. Basil Payne (1923) was born in Dublin on June 23, 1923. His published work amounts to three slim volumes, and numerous inclusions in anthologies of Irish poetry. Hugh McFadden (1942‚Äì) worked for many years as a newspaper journalist and book reviewer. His own collections of poems include Cities of Mirrors, Pieces of Time, Elegies & Epiphanies, and Empire of Shadows. =Women poets (in English)= The second half of the century also saw the emergence of a number of women poets of note. Two of the most successful of these are Eavan Boland (born 1944) and Eil√©an N√≠ Chuillean√°in (born 1942). Boland has written widely on specifically feminist themes and on the difficulties faced by women poets in a male-dominated literary world. N√≠ Chuillean√°in's poetry shows her interest variously in explorations of the sacred, women's experience, and Reformation history. She has also translated poetry from a number of languages. Other women poets of note are Vona Groarke, Kerry Hardie, Kate Newmann, Medbh McGuckian and Paula Meehan. Rita Ann Higgins is an unconventional poet whose work confronts social injustices. Contemporary poetry in Irish With the foundation of the Irish Free State it became official government policy to promote and protect the Irish language. Despite its failures, this policy did further the revival in Irish- language literature which had started around 1900. In particular, the establishment in 1925D√°il √âireann - Volume 42 - 28 June, 1932, Ceisteanna‚ÄîQuestions. Oral Answers. - An G√∫m , Cuireadh ‚ÄúAn G√∫m‚Äù n√≥ an Sc√©im Foillsi√∫ch√°in at√° ar siubhal faoi Roinn an Oideachais, cuireadh sin ar bun go hoifigeamhail f√° ughdar√°s na Roinne Airgid ar an 6adh l√° de Mh√°rta, 1925., An G√∫m, or the \\"Publication Scheme\\", was in progress under the Department of Education, founded officially under the authority of the Department of Finance on the 6th day of March, 1925. of An G√∫m (\\"The Project\\"), a Government sponsored publisher, created an outlet both for original works in Irish and for translations into the language. Contemporary poetry in Irish saw a renewal from the end of the 1940s in the poetry of M√°irt√≠n √ì Dire√°in (1910-1988), Se√°n √ì R√≠ord√°in (1916-1977) and M√°ire Mhac an tSaoi (1922-). Their poetry, though retaining a sense of tradition, introduced a modernist technique and sensibility. Also of that generation was the poet and novelist Eoghan √ì Tuairisc (1919-1982). This group were the precursors of a more radical group of poets, including Liam √ì Muirthile (1950-2018), Gabriel Rosenstock and Nuala N√≠ Dhomhnaill, whose poetry, first published in the 1970s and 1980s, reflected contemporary international influences. The poet and sean-n√≥s singer Caitl√≠n Maude (1941-1982) also belonged to that group.Theo Dorgan, ‚ÄúTwentieth Century Irish-Language Poetry‚Äù: archipelago (Vol. 3): http://www.archipelago.org/vol7-3/dorgan.htm‚ÄùBy the early 1970s the new generation of poets were wide open to the world and experimenting with influences from across the Atlantic‚Äù: David Cooke, Leabhar na hAthghabh√°la, Poems of Repossession, ed. by Louis de Paor (Bloodaxe Books)‚Äù (review), July 2016, The Manchester Review: http://www.themanchesterreview.co.uk/?p=6607 Other younger poets of note were Louis de Paor and Cathal √ì Searcaigh. Other poets include Derry O‚ÄôSullivan, who, though long resident in Paris, has continued to publish in Irish. This is also true of Tom√°s Mac S√≠om√≥in, an Irish writer resident in Spain. Another published poet is P√°draig Mac Fhearghusa, for a long time the editor of Feasta. Modern Irish-language poetry is notable for the growing number of women poets. They include Rita Kelly (widow of Eoghan √ì Tuairisc), Biddy Jenkinson (a nom de plume), √Åine N√≠ Ghlinn and Br√≠d N√≠ Mh√≥r√°in, and younger writers such as Ciara N√≠ √â, Doireann N√≠ Ghr√≠ofa and Ailbhe N√≠ Ghearbhuigh. It has been argued that, since the Irish language depends for its continued existence on government patronage and the efforts of cultural activists, all poetry in the language is political to a certain extent: ‚ÄúIt is an assertion of pride, an appeal for identity, a staking out of cultural territory‚Äù.Audrey Deng (2011), ‚ÄúA talkative corpse: the joys of writing poetry in Irish,‚Äù Columbia Journal: http://columbiajournal.org/a-talkative-corpse-the-joys-of-writing-poetry-in- irish-3/ Bilingualism has been a consistent feature of contemporary Irish poetic practice. Among the more notable examples was Michael Hartnett (1941‚Äì1999), who was fluent in both Irish and English. He won praise for his work in English, but in his 1975 book A Farewell to English he declared his intention to write only in Irish. A number of volumes in Irish followed but in 1989 he returned to English. Eoghan √ì Tuairisc, also bilingual, made no formal renunciation of either language but published in both in several genres. IPRA Irish Poetry Reading Archive The newly created Irish Poetry Reading Archive (IPRA) is building into a comprehensive web-based library of Irish poets. Hosted by UCD‚Äôs Digital Library, a part of the university's James Joyce Library, it has an archive of contemporary Irish poets. These include established and emerging poets in both the English and Irish languages, experimental and emigrant poets, as well as performance poets. It contains videos of poets reading their work, as well hand-written copies of the recorded poems, signed copies of their collections, and a growing collection of poets' archives.

He was part of the neo-Friesian school (named after post-Kantian philosopher Jakob Friedrich Fries) of neo-Kantianism and a friend of the mathematician David Hilbert. He devised the Grelling‚ÄìNelson paradox in 1908 and the related idea of autological words with Kurt Grelling. Also in: Neo-Friesian subsequently became an influencer in fields of both philosophy and mathematics, as Nelson's close contacts with scientists and mathematicians influenced their ideas. Despite dying earlier than many of his friends and assistants, his ISK organization lived on after his death, even after being banned by the Nazi Regime in 1933. It is even claimed that Albert Einstein supported it. He's also credited with popularizing the Socratic method in his book Die sokratische Methode (The Socratic Method).  Life  = Early life and education = In Nelson's early years, he studied in Franz√∂sisches Gymnasium Berlin where mathematics and science weren't notable in that school. He was therefore privately tutored by mathematician Gerhard Hessenberg (1874‚Äì1925), and began reading the works of philosophers Immanuel Kant, Jakob Friedrich Fries, and Ernst Friedrich Apelts, which began to spark his interest in philosophy. In 1901, Nelson studied mathematics and philosophy in Heidelberg University for a short period of time, before going to the Humboldt University of Berlin from March 1901 ‚Äì 1903. From 1903 to 1904, he worked with mathematicians and philosophers in the University of G√∂ttingen, such as; his doctoral advisor Julius Baumann, David Hilbert, Felix Klein, Carl Runge, and his later rival Edmund Husserl. = Critical philosophy = Nelson's work was a philosopher was most concerned with critical philosophy, attributed to Kant. It sets out to find a \\"critique\\" on science and metaphysics, similar to empiricism, as things can only be true based on the perceptions and limitations on human minds. Kant's 1781 book Critique of Pure Reason (Kritik der reinen Vernunft) inspired Nelson to go down the path of critical philosophy, and later followed the works of post-Kantian philosopher Fries who had also followed Kant's work. Although his 1904 dissertation Jakob Fries and his Youngest Critics (Jakob Friedrich Fries und seine j√ºngsten Kritiker) was successful, he had trouble in his early academic years. One such failed dissertation was his Die kritische Methode und das Verh√§ltnis der Psychologie zur Philosophie (The Critical Method and the Relationship of Psychology to Philosophy). Nelson continued defending Fries' philosophy and ideas by publishing a neue Folge (new series) of Abhandlungen der Fries'schen Schule (1904) with Gerhard Hessenberg and mathematician Karl Kaiser. It was here that Nelson and these same friends created the Jakob-Friedrich-Fries-Gesellschaft (Jakob Friedrich Fries Society) to promote critical philosophy. In 1922, Nelson founded the Philosophisch-Politische Akademie (Philosophical-Political Academy or PPA) as a \\"Platonic Academy\\" and non-profit association, which was abandoned soon after the Nazis banned it, but re-established in 1949. It still stands today for political discussions between philosophers and politicians, and was supported financially by the Gesellschaft der Freunde der Philosophisch-Politischen Akademie (Society of Friends of the Philosophical- Political Academy or GFA). They started working with an education center called Landerziehungsheim Walkem√ºhle, founded in 1921 by a support of Nelson, progressive teacher Ludwig Wunder (1878‚Äì1949). Although Wunder left it shortly after in 1924, educator and co-worker of Nelson, Minna Specht, took over, with the help of journalist and author Mary Saran. = Career = Ready to form new ideas, Nelson founded the Neo-Friesian School in 1903, with some well-known members, such as: * Rudolf Otto, philosopher (1869‚Äì1937) * Gerhard Hessenberg, mathematician (1874‚Äì1925) * Otto Meyerhof, biochemist (1884‚Äì1951) Other notable people, such as philosopher Kurt Grelling and mathematician Richard Courant (student of Hilbert), joined after its foundation. A larger list of ISK members and similar can be seen in the list of Germans who resisted Nazism. In 1909 he habiliated at the University of G√∂ttingen and became Privatdozent there. He later worked there as a professor from June 1919 until his death on 29 October 1927. = Internationaler Sozialistischer Kampfbund (ISK) = The Internationaler Jugendbund (International Youth Federation or IJB) was founded in 1917 by Nelson and Minna Specht. In 1918, Nelson became a brief member of the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) before becoming a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) from 1923‚Äì1925, when he was ultimately excluded. As a result, together with Minna Specht, he founded the Internationaler Sozialistischer Kampfbund (ISK; \\"International Socialist Militant League\\") in 1925, merging it with the IJB by taking over its publishing label, √ñffentliches Leben. The socialist journalist Willi Eichler succeeded Nelson as president of the ISK after his death. Eichler and Specht would both sign the 1932 \\"Urgent Call for Unity\\" (Dringender Appell f√ºr die Einheit) in the ISK's official newspaper, Der Funke. It called for Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) and Communist Party (KPD) to create a left-wing united front in order to thwart the Nazis.\\"Dringender Appell f√ºr die Einheit\\" (PDF) Der Funke, No. 147 A, Berlin (June 25, 1932). Retrieved July 6, 2010 After the Nazi's defeat in 1945, the ISK was merged with the SPD with the agreement met on 10 December 1945, between the chairman of the ISK (Will Eichler) and chairman of the SPD (Kurt Schumacher). However, the ISK continued to be active in the resistance against Nazism. A British affiliate of the ISK was created (lasted from the 1920s to the 1950s) in the United Kingdom called the Socialist Vanguard Group. Among Leonard Nelson's students and political companions in the International Socialist Kampfbund were: * SPD politician Willi Eichler (1896‚Äì1971) * Prime Minister Alfred Kubel (1909‚Äì1999) * Journalist Fritz Eberhard (1896‚Äì1982), later member of the Parlamentarischer Rat  Personal life  Leonard Nelson was the son of lawyer Heinrich Nelson (1854‚Äì1929) and artist Elisabeth Lejeune Dirichlet (1860‚Äì1920), granddaughter of mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and descendant of Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn. Nelson married his wife, Elisabeth Schemmann (1884‚Äì1954), in 1907, but divorced in 1912 after she baptised their son Gerhard David Wilhelm Nelson (1909‚Äì1944) in the Lutheran Church. Nelson's wife is notable for marrying Paul Hensel in 1917. His granddaughter, Maria Nelson, and Maria's daughter, Rachel Urban, both visited his grave in the summer of 1997. Although Nelson was baptised as a Protestant at the age of five on 13 June 1887, his refusal to baptise his son and divorce was a big change based on his Jewish ancestry. He even resigned from the Evangelical Church in 1919.  Death  He was an insomniac and died at a young age from pneumonia, and was buried at a Jewish cemetery in Melsungen alongside his father Heinrich. Nelson's ideas continued to have an impact upon German socialism and communism in Nazi Germany as the ISK's members became active in the left-wing resistance to Nazism.  Bibliography  Nelson published numerous books and papers, often with the help of other philosophers and mathematicians. He was later critical of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel in his work Progress and Regress in Philosophy (Fortschritte und R√ºckschritte der Philosophie). He is also known for defending the idea of animal rights in his work System of Philosophical Ethics and Pedagogy (System der philosophischen Ethik und P√§dagogik) published in 1932, with the help of his assistant Grete Hermann (also part of the ISK) and Minna Specht.Nelson, Leonard, System of Ethics, Yale University Press, New Haven, 1956, p. 142.

He was a graduate of the Aviation Cadet Program at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona, where he received his flight training commission in the U.S. Air Force. He also attended the U.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School and was an experimental test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base in California before being selected for the astronaut class of 1966. From July 1962 to August 1964, Roosa was a maintenance flight test pilot at Olmstead Air Force Base, Pennsylvania, flying F-101 Voodoo aircraft. He was a fighter pilot at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, where he flew the F-84F Thunderstreak and F-100 Super Sabre aircraft. Following graduation from the University of Colorado, under the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology Program, he served as Chief of Service Engineering (AFLC) at Tachikawa Air Base, Japan, for two years. =NASA career= Roosa undergoes final space suit check prior to liftoff of Apollo 14 Roosa was one of 19 people selected as part of the astronaut class of 1966. He was the Capsule communicator (CAPCOM) at the Launch Complex 34 blockhouse during the Apollo 1 fire on 27 January 1967. In 1969, he served as a member of the astronaut support crew for the Apollo 9 mission. On Apollo 14 he spent 33 hours in solo orbit around the Moon, conducting an extensive series of experiments. On the Apollo 14 mission Roosa carried seeds from loblolly pine, sycamore, sweet gum, redwood, and Douglas fir trees as part of a joint U.S. Forest Service/NASA project. The seeds were germinated on his return and planted throughout the United States, becoming known as the \\"Moon Trees\\". Following Apollo 14, Roosa served as backup Command Module Pilot for Apollo 16 and Apollo 17, and based on crew rotations, would probably have commanded one of the last Apollo missions had they not been cancelled. He was assigned to the Space Shuttle program until his retirement as a Colonel from the Air Force in 1976. Roosa logged 5,500 hours of flying time; 5,000 hours in jet aircraft. He also logged 217 hours in space. =Post-NASA career= Roosa attended Harvard Business School's six-week Advanced Management Program in 1973. He retired from the military as a Colonel in 1976. After leaving NASA and the Air Force, Roosa held a number of positions in international and U.S. businesses, and became owner and president of Gulf Coast Coors in 1981. =Death= Roosa's Tombstone in section 7A of Arlington National Cemetery On December 12, 1994, Roosa died at age 61 in Washington, D.C. from complications of pancreatitis. He was survived by his wife Joan, three sons and a daughter, and seven grandchildren. Roosa is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His wife Joan died on October 30, 2007, in Gulfport, Mississippi. She was interred at Arlington with her husband. Organizations Roosa's memberships include the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, New York Safari Club, Board of Directors, People-to-People Sports Committee, Hunting Hall of Fame, Circumnavigators Club, Explorers Club, Commemorative Air Force, Shikar-Safari-Club and Gulfport Yacht Club. Awards and honors Roosa's honors include the NASA Distinguished Service Medal; the MSC Superior Achievement Award (1970); the Air Force Command Pilot Astronaut Wings; the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal; the Arnold Air Society's John F. Kennedy Award (1971); the City of New York Gold Medal (1971); the American Astronautical Society's Flight Achievement Award (1971); the Order of Tehad (1973); and the Order of the Central African Empire (1973). Additionally, an elementary school in Claremore, Oklahoma is named in his honor. He received an honorary LL.D. from University of St. Thomas, Houston in 1971. He was one of five Oklahoman astronauts inducted into the Oklahoma Aviation and Space Hall of Fame in 1980 and he was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983. Roosa was posthumously inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997.

However, it is named after Joseph Plateau who experimented with soap films. The problem is considered part of the calculus of variations. The existence and regularity problems are part of geometric measure theory. History Various specialized forms of the problem were solved, but it was only in 1930 that general solutions were found in the context of mappings (immersions) independently by Jesse Douglas and Tibor Rad√≥. Their methods were quite different; Rad√≥'s work built on the previous work of Ren√© Garnier and held only for rectifiable simple closed curves, whereas Douglas used completely new ideas with his result holding for an arbitrary simple closed curve. Both relied on setting up minimization problems; Douglas minimized the now-named Douglas integral while Rad√≥ minimized the \\"energy\\". Douglas went on to be awarded the Fields Medal in 1936 for his efforts. In higher dimensions The extension of the problem to higher dimensions (that is, for k-dimensional surfaces in n-dimensional space) turns out to be much more difficult to study. Moreover, while the solutions to the original problem are always regular, it turns out that the solutions to the extended problem may have singularities if k \\\\leq n - 2. In the hypersurface case where k = n - 1, singularities occur only for n \\\\geq 8. To solve the extended problem in certain special cases, the theory of perimeters (De Giorgi) for codimension 1 and the theory of rectifiable currents (Federer and Fleming) for higher codimension have been developed. Multidimensional Plateau problem in the class of spectral surfaces (parametrized by the spectra of the manifolds with a fixed boundary) was solved in 1969 by Anatoly Fomenko. The axiomatic approach of Jenny Harrison and Harrison Pugh treats a wide variety of special cases. In particular, they solve the anisotropic Plateau problem in arbitrary dimension and codimension for any collection of rectifiable sets satisfying a combination of general homological, cohomological or homotopical spanning conditions. Physical applications Physical soap films are more accurately modeled by the (M, 0, \\\\Delta)-minimal sets of Frederick Almgren, but the lack of a compactness theorem makes it difficult to prove the existence of an area minimizer. In this context, a persistent open question has been the existence of a least-area soap film. Ernst Robert Reifenberg solved such a \\"universal Plateau's problem\\" for boundaries which are homeomorphic to single embedded spheres. In his book Almgren claimed to use varifolds to solve the problem for more than one sphere, as well as more general boundaries, but Allard's compactness theorem for integral varifolds produces a minimal surface, not necessarily an area minimizer.

History Along with the 7th Armoured Brigade both units had 139 killed during the first battle of Latrun, Operation Ben Nun Alef (an attempt to conquer the Latrun area). The commanding officer was Dan Even. The unit is currently a reserve unit. Units * 31st Battalion * 32nd Battalion * 33rd Battalion * 34th Battalion * 37th Battalion Katz controversy In 1998, Teddy Katz wrote a master's thesis at Haifa University arguing that the Alexandroni Brigade committed a massacre in the Palestinian village of Tantura during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. The veterans of the brigade sued Katz for libel. During the court hearing Katz conceded by issuing a statement withdrawing his own work. He then tried to withdraw his statement, but the court disallowed it and ruled against him. A committee at Haifa University found problems with the thesis and ruled that it: \\"failed at the stage of presenting the raw material for the reader's judgment, both in terms of its organization according to strict criteria of classification and criticism, and in terms of the apparent instances of disregard for the interviewees' testimony\\". Some quotations in the thesis did not accord with interview recordings. The university suspended his degree and asked him to resubmit his thesis. The new thesis was rejected. In 2004, Israeli historian Benny Morris reviewed the Tantura controversy. He suggests that, while controversy remains as to whether a \\"massacre\\" actually occurred, there is no doubt that war crimes were committed by the Jewish forces and that the village was forcibly cleansed of its Arab inhabitants. Morris underlines the fact that in interviews conducted by himself and by the whistle-blower Amil Gilat, all refugees confirmed that a massacre had taken place, while all IDF veterans denied it. Regarding the latter, Morris describes what he calls \\"troubling hints\\", such as a diary by an Alexandroni soldier, Tulik Makovsky, in which he wrote > our boys know the craft of murder quite well, especially boys whose > relatives the Arabs had murdered... or those harmed by Hitler. They took > their private revenge, and avenged our comrades who had died at their hands, > against the snipers. Morris defended the value of oral testimony and tradition. He additionally pointed out issues with the scoring of the second version of Katz's thesis in that the two referees who gave anomalously low scores had been co-authors of an IDF book in which it was argued that the Israeli Army had carried out only a \\"partial expulsion\\" of the populations of the Arab towns of Lydda and Ramlah, while the charge that the troops had massacred Lydda townspeople was dismissed.\\"The Tantura ‚ÄòMassacre‚Äô Affair\\" by Benny Morris, The Jerusalem Report, 9 February 2004 Gallery File:Andarta alxsandroni.JPGAlexandroni Brigade monument File:◊™◊û◊ï◊†◊î 1154.jpgAlexandroni Brigade Memorial in Netanya File:PikiWiki Israel 14137 A mass grave of 87 fallen soldiers of Alexandroni.JPGA mass grave of 87 fallen soldiers of Alexandroni Division in \\"Faluja Pocket\\" in the Independence War File:PikiWiki Israel 34077 Archeological sites of Israel.JPGMemorial in Qaqun with Bible citation from Zephaniah 3:19 File: ◊ì◊ü ◊ê◊ë◊ü ◊ê◊§◊©◊ò◊ô◊ô◊ü 1948 ◊ê◊®◊õ◊ô◊ï◊ü ◊î◊î◊í◊†◊î.jpgDan Even (Epstein), commander of the Alexandroni Brigade References External links * Official website Category:1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War Category:Brigades of Israel Category:Military units and formations established in 1948 ","title":"Alexandroni Brigade"},{"id":"338154","text":"A wound is a type of injury which happens relatively quickly in which skin is torn, cut, or punctured (an open wound), or where blunt force trauma causes a contusion (a closed wound). In pathology, it specifically refers to a sharp injury which damages the epidermis of the skin. Classification According to level of contamination, a wound can be classified as: * Clean wound ‚Äì made under sterile conditions where there are no organisms present, and the skin is likely to heal without complications. * Contaminated wound ‚Äì usually resulting from accidental injury; there are pathogenic organisms and foreign bodies in the wound. * Infected wound ‚Äì the wound has pathogenic organisms present and multiplying, exhibiting clinical signs of infection (yellow appearance, soreness, redness, oozing pus). * Colonized wound ‚Äì a chronic situation, containing pathogenic organisms, difficult to heal (i.e. bedsore). =Open= Open wounds can be classified according to the object that caused the wound: * Incisions or incised wounds ‚Äì caused by a clean, sharp-edged object such as a knife, razor, or glass splinter. * Lacerations ‚Äì irregular tear-like wounds caused by some blunt trauma. Lacerations and incisions may appear linear (regular) or stellate (irregular). The term laceration is commonly misused in reference to incisions. * Abrasions (grazes) ‚Äì superficial wounds in which the topmost layer of the skin (the epidermis) is scraped off. Abrasions are often caused by a sliding fall onto a rough surface such as asphalt, tree bark or concrete. * Avulsions ‚Äì injuries in which a body structure is forcibly detached from its normal point of insertion. A type of amputation where the extremity is pulled off rather than cut off. When used in reference to skin avulsions, the term 'degloving' is also sometimes used as a synonym. * Puncture wounds ‚Äì caused by an object puncturing the skin, such as a splinter, nail or needle. * Penetration wounds ‚Äì caused by an object such as a knife entering and coming out from the skin. * Gunshot wounds ‚Äì caused by a bullet or similar projectile driving into or through the body. There may be two wounds, one at the site of entry and one at the site of exit, generally referred to as a \\"through-and-through.\\" =Closed= Closed wounds have fewer categories, but are just as dangerous as open wounds: * Hematomas (or blood tumor) ‚Äì caused by damage to a blood vessel that in turn causes blood to collect under the skin. ** Hematomas that originate from internal blood vessel pathology are petechiae, purpura, and ecchymosis. The different classifications are based on size. ** Hematomas that originate from an external source of trauma are contusions, also commonly called bruises. * Crush injury ‚Äì caused by a great or extreme amount of force applied over a long period of time.

Current laboratory-based detection of bacteria can take hours or days. Workup Wounds that are not healing should be investigated to find the causes; many microbiological agents may be responsible. The basic workup includes evaluating the wound, its extent and severity. Cultures are usually obtained both from the wound site and blood. X-rays are obtained and a tetanus shot may be administered if there is any doubt about prior vaccination.Work Up eMedicine General Surgery. Retrieved 27 January 2010 Chronic Non- healing wounds of the diabetic foot are considered one of the most significant complications of diabetes, representing a major worldwide medical, social, and economic burden that greatly affects patient quality of life. Almost 24 million Americans‚Äîone in every twelve‚Äîare diabetic and the disease is causing widespread disability and death at an epidemic pace, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those with diabetes, 6.5 million are estimated to suffer with chronic or non-healing wounds. Associated with inadequate circulation, poorly functioning veins, and immobility, non-healing wounds occur most frequently in the elderly and in people with diabetes‚Äîpopulations that are sharply rising as the nation ages and chronic diseases increase. Although diabetes can ravage the body in many ways, non- healing ulcers on the feet and lower legs are common outward manifestations of the disease. Also, diabetics often suffer from nerve damage in their feet and legs, allowing small wounds or irritations to develop without awareness. Given the abnormalities of the microvasculature and other side effects of diabetes, these wounds take a long time to heal and require a specialized treatment approach for proper healing. As many as 25% of diabetic patients will eventually develop foot ulcers, and recurrence within five years is 70%. If not aggressively treated, these wounds can lead to amputations. It is estimated that every 30 seconds a lower limb is amputated somewhere in the world because of a diabetic wound. Amputation often triggers a downward spiral of declining quality of life, frequently leading to disability and death. In fact, only about one third of diabetic amputees will live more than five years, a survival rate equivalent to that of many cancers. Many of these lower extremity amputations can be prevented through an interdisciplinary approach to treatment involving a variety of advanced therapies and techniques, such as debridement, hyperbaric oxygen treatment therapy, dressing selection, special shoes, and patient education. When wounds persist, a specialized approach is required for healing.\\"The Clinical Case for Use of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in the Treatment of Diabetic Wounds,\\" Diversified Clinical Services, copyright 2009 Pathophysiology To heal a wound, the body undertakes a series of actions collectively known as the wound healing process. Diagnosis A wound may be recorded for follow-up and observing progress of healing with different techniques which include: * Photographs, with subsequent area quantification using computer processing * Wound tracings on acetate sheets * Kundin wound gauge Management stitches The overall treatment depends on the type, cause, and depth of the wound, and whether other structures beyond the skin (dermis) are involved. Treatment of recent lacerations involves examining, cleaning, and closing the wound. Minor wounds, like bruises, will heal on their own, with skin discoloration usually disappearing in 1‚Äì2 weeks. Abrasions, which are wounds with intact skin (non-penetration through dermis to subcutaneous fat), usually require no active treatment except keeping the area clean, initially with soap and water. Puncture wounds may be prone to infection depending on the depth of penetration. The entry of puncture wound is left open to allow for bacteria or debris to be removed from inside. A 2013 guideline states the following: not to cleanse wounds that are primarily closed, to cleanse acute open wounds with clean tap water, to use the WHO pain ladder as the basis for the choice of analgesics for continuous wound pain, to administer lidocaine or prilocaine for localized pain relief during manipulation, not to cover primarily closed wounds with dressings, to use simple dressings for open wounds. =Cleaning= Evidence to support the cleaning of wounds before closure is scant. For simple lacerations, cleaning can be accomplished using a number of different solutions, including tap water and sterile saline solution. Infection rates may be lower with the use of tap water in regions where water quality is high. Cleaning of a wound is also known as 'wound toilet'.Simple wound management , patient.info (website), accessed 8 January 2012 It is not clear if delaying a shower following a surgery helps reduce complications related to wound healing. =Closure= If a person presents to a healthcare center within 6 hours of a laceration they are typically closed immediately after evaluating and cleaning the wound. After this point in time, however, there is a theoretical concern of increased risks of infection if closed immediately. Thus some healthcare providers may delay closure while others may be willing to immediately close up to 24 hours after the injury. Using clean non-sterile gloves is equivalent to using sterile gloves during wound closure. If closure of a wound is decided upon a number of techniques can be used. These include bandages, a cyanoacrylate glue, staples, and sutures. Absorbable sutures have the benefit over non absorbable sutures of not requiring removal. They are often preferred in children. Buffering the pH of lidocaine makes the injection less painful. Adhesive glue and sutures have comparable cosmetic outcomes for minor lacerations <5 cm in adults and children. The use of adhesive glue involves considerably less time for the doctor and less pain for the person. The wound opens at a slightly higher rate but there is less redness. The risk for infections (1.1%) is the same for both. Adhesive glue should not be used in areas of high tension or repetitive movements, such as joints or the posterior trunk. =Dressings= In the case of clean surgical wounds, there is no evidence that the use of topical antibiotics reduces infection rates in comparison with non-antibiotic ointment or no ointment at all., which cites * Antibiotic ointments can irritate the skin, slow healing, and greatly increase the risk of developing contact dermatitis and antibiotic resistance. Because of this, they should only be used when a person shows signs of infection and not as a preventative. The effectiveness of dressings and creams containing silver to prevent infection or improve healing is not currently supported by evidence. =Alternative medicine= There is moderate evidence that honey is more effective than antiseptic followed by gauze for healing wounds infected after surgical operations. There is a lack of quality evidence relating to the use of honey on other types of wounds, such as minor acute wounds, mixed acute and chronic wounds, pressure ulcers, Fournier's gangrene, venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers and Leishmaniasis. There is no good evidence that therapeutic touch is useful in healing. More than 400 species of plants are identified as potentially useful for wound healing. Only three randomized controlled trials, however, have been done for the treatment of burns. History Medieval treatment of wound with lance grittings From the Classical Period to the Medieval Period, the body and the soul were believed to be intimately connected, based on several theories put forth by the philosopher Plato. Wounds on the body were believed to correlate with wounds to the soul and vice versa; wounds were seen as an outward sign of an inward illness. Thus, a man who was wounded physically in a serious way was said to be hindered not only physically but spiritually as well. If the soul was wounded, that wound may also eventually become physically manifest, revealing the true state of the soul. Wounds were also seen as writing on the \\"tablet\\" of the body. Wounds acquired in war, for example, told the story of a soldier in a form which all could see and understand, and the wounds of a martyr told the story of their faith. Research In humans and mice it has been shown that estrogen might positively affect the speed and quality of wound healing.

It is present in many character sets, including those defined by the Baudot and ITA2 codes, ISO/IEC 646 (or ASCII), the C0 control code, the Universal Coded Character Set (or Unicode), and EBCDIC. It is available in nearly all mainstream programming languages.\\"A byte with all bits set to 0, called the null character, shall exist in the basic execution character set; it is used to terminate a character string literal.\\" ‚Äî ANSI/ISO 9899:1990 (the ANSI C standard), section 5.2.1 It is often abbreviated as NUL (or NULL though in some contexts that term is used for the null pointer, a different object). In 8-bit codes, it is known as a null byte. The original meaning of this character was like NOP--when sent to a printer or a terminal, it does nothing (some terminals, however, incorrectly display it as space). When electromechanical teleprinters were used as computer output devices, one or more null characters were sent at the end of each printed line to allow time for the mechanism to return to the first printing position on the next line. On punched tape, the character is represented with no holes at all, so a new unpunched tape is initially filled with null characters, and often text could be \\"inserted\\" at a reserved space of null characters by punching the new characters into the tape over the nulls. Today the character has much more significance in C and its derivatives and in many data formats, where it serves as a reserved character used to signify the end of a string,\\"A string is a contiguous sequence of characters terminated by and including the first null character\\" ‚Äî ANSI/ISO 9899:1990 (the ANSI C standard), section 7.1.1 often called a null-terminated string. This allows the string to be any length with only the overhead of one byte; the alternative of storing a count requires either a string length limit of 255 or an overhead of more than one byte (there are other advantages/disadvantages described under null-terminated string).  Representation  The null character is often represented as the escape sequence \`\\\\0\` in source code string literals or character constants.Kernighan and Ritchie, C, p. 38 In many languages (such as C, which introduced this notation), this is not a separate escape sequence, but an octal escape sequence with a single octal digit 0; as a consequence, \`\\\\0\` must not be followed by any of the digits \`0\` through \`7\`; otherwise it is interpreted as the start of a longer octal escape sequence.In YAML this combination is a separate escape sequence. Other escape sequences that are found in use in various languages are \`\\\\000\`, \`\\\\x00\`, \`\\\\z\`, or \`\\\\u0000\`. A null character can be placed in a URL with the percent code \`%00\`. The ability to represent a null character does not always mean the resulting string will be correctly interpreted, as many programs will consider the null to be the end of the string. Thus the ability to type it (in case of unchecked user input) creates a vulnerability known as null byte injection and can lead to security exploits.Null Byte Injection WASC Threat Classification Null Byte Attack section. In caret notation the null character is \`^@\`. On some keyboards, one can enter a null character by holding down and pressing (on US layouts just will often work, there is no need for to get the @ sign). In documentation, the null character is sometimes represented as a single-em- width symbol containing the letters \\"NUL\\". In Unicode, there is a character with a corresponding glyph for visual representation of the null character, \\"symbol for null\\", U+2400 (‚êÄ)‚Äînot to be confused with the actual null character, U+0000.  Encoding  In all modern character sets the null character has a code point value of zero. In most encodings, this is translated to a single code unit with a zero value. For instance, in UTF-8 it is a single zero byte. However, in Modified UTF-8 the null character is encoded as two bytes: 0xC0, 0x80. This allows the byte with the value of zero, which is now not used for any character, to be used as a string terminator.

Alternative names are C string, which refers to the C programming language and ASCIIZ (although C can use encodings other than ASCII). The length of a C string is found by searching for the (first) NUL byte. This can be slow as it takes O(n) (linear time) with respect to the string length. It also means that a string cannot contain a NUL character (there is a NUL in memory, but it is after the last character, not \\"in\\" the string).  History  Null-terminated strings were produced by the \`.ASCIZ\` directive of the PDP-11 assembly languages and the \`ASCIZ\` directive of the MACRO-10 macro assembly language for the PDP-10. These predate the development of the C programming language, but other forms of strings were often used. At the time C (and the languages that it was derived from) was developed, memory was extremely limited, so using only one byte of overhead to store the length of a string was attractive. The only popular alternative at that time, usually called a \\"Pascal string\\" (a more modern term is \\"length-prefixed\\"), used a leading byte to store the length of the string. This allows the string to contain NUL and made finding the length need only one memory access (O(1) (constant) time), but limited string length to 255 characters (on a machine using 8-bit bytes). C designer Dennis Ritchie chose to follow the convention of NUL-termination, already established in BCPL, to avoid the limitation on the length of a string and because maintaining the count seemed, in his experience, less convenient than using a terminator.Dennis M. Ritchie (1993). [The development of the C language]. Proc. 2nd History of Programming Languages Conf. This had some influence on CPU instruction set design. Some CPUs in the 1970s and 1980s, such as the Zilog Z80 and the DEC VAX, had dedicated instructions for handling length-prefixed strings. However, as the NUL-terminated string gained traction, CPU designers began to take it into account, as seen for example in IBM's decision to add the \\"Logical String Assist\\" instructions to the ES/9000 520 in 1992. FreeBSD developer Poul- Henning Kamp, writing in ACM Queue, would later refer to the victory of null- terminated strings over a 2-byte (not one-byte) length as \\"the most expensive one-byte mistake\\" ever.  Limitations  While simple to implement, this representation has been prone to errors and performance problems. The NUL termination has historically created security problems. A NUL byte inserted into the middle of a string will truncate it unexpectedly.https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/48187/null-byte- injection-on-php A common bug was to not allocate the additional space for the NUL, so it was written over adjacent memory. Another was to not write the NUL at all, which was often not detected during testing because a NUL was already there by chance from previous use of the same block of memory. Due to the expense of finding the length, many programs did not bother before copying a string to a fixed-size buffer, causing a buffer overflow if it was too long. The inability to store a NUL requires that string data and binary data be kept distinct and handled by different functions (with the latter requiring the length of the data to also be supplied). This can lead to code redundancy and errors when the wrong function is used. The speed problems with finding the length can usually be mitigated by combining it with another operation that is O(n) anyway, such as in \`strlcpy\`. However, this does not always result in an intuitive API.  Character encodings  Null-terminated strings require that the encoding does not use a zero byte (0x00) anywhere, therefore it is not possible to store every possible ASCII or UTF-8 string. However, it is common to store the subset of ASCII or UTF-8 ‚Äì every character except the NUL character ‚Äì in null-terminated strings. Some systems use \\"modified UTF-8\\" which encodes the NUL character as two non-zero bytes (0xC0, 0x80) and thus allow all possible strings to be stored. This is not allowed by the UTF-8 standard, because it is an overlong encoding, and it is seen as a security risk. Some other byte may be used as end of string instead, like 0xFE or 0xFF, which are not used in UTF-8. UTF-16 uses 2-byte integers and as either byte may be zero (and in fact every other byte is, when representing ASCII text), cannot be stored in a null-terminated byte string. However, some languages implement a string of 16-bit UTF-16 characters, terminated by a 16-bit NUL character. (Again the NUL character, which encodes as a single zero code unit, is the only character that cannot be stored. UTF-16 does not have any alternative encoding of zero).  Improvements  Many attempts to make C string handling less error prone have been made. One strategy is to add safer functions such as \`strdup\` and \`strlcpy\`, whilst deprecating the use of unsafe functions such as \` gets\`. Another is to add an object-oriented wrapper around C strings so that only safe calls can be done. However, it is possible to call the unsafe functions anyway. Most modern libraries replace C strings with a structure containing a 32-bit or larger length value (far more than were ever considered for length-prefixed strings), and often add another pointer, a reference count, and even a NUL to speed up conversion back to a C string. Memory is far larger now, such that if the addition of 3 (or 16, or more) bytes to each string is a real problem the software will have to be dealing with so many small strings that some other storage method will save even more memory (for instance there may be so many duplicates that a hash table will use less memory). Examples include the C++ Standard Template Library \`std::string\`, the Qt \`QString\`, the MFC \`CString\`, and the C-based implementation \`CFString\` from Core Foundation as well as its Objective-C sibling \`NSString\` from Foundation, both by Apple. More complex structures may also be used to store strings such as the rope.

His second novel, it involves issues of free will, omniscience, and the overall purpose of human history. Much of the story revolves around a Martian invasion of Earth. Plot Malachi Constant is the richest man in a future America. He possesses extraordinary luck that he attributes to divine favor which he has used to build upon his father's fortune. He becomes the centerpoint of a journey that takes him from Earth to Mars in preparation for an interplanetary war, to Mercury with another Martian survivor of that war, back to Earth to be pilloried as a sign of Man's displeasure with his arrogance, and finally to Titan where he again meets the man ostensibly responsible for the turn of events that have befallen him, Winston Niles Rumfoord. Rumfoord comes from a wealthy New England background. His private fortune was large enough to fund the construction of a personal spacecraft, and he became a space explorer. Traveling between Earth and Mars, his ship--carrying Rumfoord and his dog, Kazak--entered a phenomenon known as a chrono-synclastic infundibulum, which is defined in the novel as \\"those places ... where all the different kinds of truths fit together.\\" When they enter the infundibulum, Rumfoord and Kazak become \\"wave phenomena\\", somewhat akin to the probability waves encountered in quantum mechanics. They exist along a spiral stretching from the Sun to the star Betelgeuse. When a planet, such as the Earth, intersects their spiral, Rumfoord and Kazak materialize, temporarily, on that planet. When he entered the chrono-synclastic infundibulum, Rumfoord became aware of the past and future. Throughout the novel, he predicts events; unless he is deliberately lying, the predictions come true. It is in this state that Rumfoord established the \\"Church of God the Utterly Indifferent\\" on Earth to unite the planet after a Martian invasion. It is also in this state that Rumfoord, materializing on different planets, instigated the Martian invasion, which was designed to fail spectacularly. On Titan, the only place where he can exist permanently as a solid human being, Rumfoord befriends a traveller from Tralfamadore (a world that also figures in Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, among others) who needs a small metal component to repair his damaged spaceship. Salo, the Tralfamadorian explorer, is a robot built millennia earlier to carry a message to a distant galaxy. His spacecraft is powered by the Universal Will to Become or UWTB, the \\"prime mover\\" which makes matter and organization wish to appear out of nothingness. (UWTB, Vonnegut informs the reader, was responsible for the Universe in the first place and is the greatest imaginable power source). A small component on Salo's spacecraft breaks and strands him here in the Solar System for over 200 millennia. He requests help from Tralfamadore, and his fellow Tralfamadorians respond by manipulating human history so that primitive humans evolve and create a civilization in order to produce the replacement part. Rumfoord's encounter with the chrono-synclastic infundibulum, the following war with Mars and Constant's exile to Titan were manipulated via the Tralfamadorians' control of the UWTB. Stonehenge, the Great Wall of China and the Kremlin are all messages in the Tralfamadorian geometrical language, informing Salo of their progress. As it turns out, the replacement part is a small metal strip, brought to Salo by Constant and his son Chrono (born of Rumfoord's ex-wife). A sunspot disrupts Rumfoord's spiral, sending him and Kazak separately into the vastness of space. An argument between Rumfoord and Salo moments before concerning the contents of Salo's message, left unresolved because of Rumfoord's disappearance, leads the distraught Salo to disassemble himself, thereby stranding the humans on Titan. It is revealed that the message was a single dot, meaning 'Greetings' in Tralfamadorian. Chrono chooses to live among the Titanian birds; after thirty- two years, his mother dies and Constant manages to reassemble Salo. Using the part delivered so many years previously by Chrono, Constant repairs the Tralfamadorian saucer. Salo returns Constant to Earth where he dies of exposure in wintertime Indianapolis while awaiting an overdue city bus and as he passes away, he experiences a pleasant hallucination secretly implanted in his mind by a compassionate Salo.  Major themes  The Sirens of Titan largely deals with questions of free will, with multiple characters being stripped of it and the revelation that humanity had been secretly manipulated for millennia for an inane purpose, playing major roles in the story. Free will and the lack thereof became major themes in Vonnegut's later novels, especially Slaughterhouse-Five (1969) and Breakfast of Champions (1972).Westbrook, Perry D. \\"Kurt Vonnegut Jr.: Overview.\\" Contemporary Novelists. Susan Windisch Brown. 6th ed. New York: St. James Press, 1996.Literature Resource Center More broadly speaking, lack of agency has been a hallmark of Vonnegut's novels, with the protagonists struggling against forces they can never overcome and often can't comprehend. None of the characters in The Sirens of Titan have chosen to be in their position, but are driven by forces and wills beside their own, and can do no more than try to make the best of it. At the end of the book Constant concluded, \\"A purpose of human life, no matter who is controlling it, is to love whoever is around to be loved.\\"  Style  The novel is simple in syntax and sentence structure, part of Vonnegut's signature style. Likewise, irony, sentimentality, black humor, and didacticism, are prevalent throughout the novel.Westbrook, Perry D. \\"Kurt Vonnegut Jr.: Overview.\\" Contemporary Novelists.

Background According to The Harvard Crimson, Vonnegut \\"put together the whole of The Sirens of Titan ... in one night...[H]e was at a party where someone told him he ought to write another novel. So they went into the next room where he just verbally pieced together this book from the things that were around in his mind.\\" Reception Floyd C. Gale of Galaxy Science Fiction in 1961 rated The Sirens of Titan 4.5 stars out of five, stating that \\"The plot is tangled, intricate and tortuous\\" but \\"the book, though exasperating, is a joy of inventiveness\\".

In July 2001, Judge Sidney H. Stein denied Random House's request for an injunction; in December 2002, Random House and Rosetta Books settled out-of-court, with RosettaBooks retaining the publishing rights that Random House had challenged.Legal Information Random House v. RosettaBooks ten years later from rosettabooks.com.

Adaptations In the 1970s, the Organic Theatre Company presented Sirens, a stage adaptation of The Sirens of Titan, designed by James Maronek and directed by Stuart Gordon, the company's founder; it utilized \\"a simple set, a few pieces of furniture and a white backdrop curtain as a space-time warp.\\" It was staged in October 1977 at the University of California, San Diego. Gordon's adaptation was produced again 40 years later in 2017 at Los Angeles' Sacred Fools Theater Company, this time directed by film and theater director Ben Rock, with the adaptation newly updated by Gordon. Also, in the early 1970s, Central Michigan University (Mt. Pleasant, MI) staged a production of \\"The Sirens Of Titan\\" under the direction of Professor Elbert Bowen, featuring Terry O'Quinn in the role of Malachi Constant. Vonnegut sold the film rights to Sirens of Titan to Jerry Garcia, guitarist and vocalist for rock band The Grateful Dead. Garcia began working with Tom Davis in early December 1983 and finished their first draft in January 1985. Garcia commented on the book and the screenplay in a November 1987 interview:Eisenhart, Mary (November 12, 1987). Transcript: Jerry Garcia Interview. Verified 30 March 2005. Jerry Garcia discusses Sirens of Titan at length :There's really three basic characters that are having things happen to them. Three main characters. [Malachi,] Rumfoord, and Bee. It's like a triangle, a complex, convoluted love story. And it's really that simple....So our task has been to take the essential dramatic relationships, make it playable for actors, so that it's free from the Big Picture emphasis of the book.

Douglas Adams discusses his early work :\\"Sirens of Titan is just one of those books ‚Äì you read it through the first time and you think it's very loosely, casually written. You think the fact that everything suddenly makes such good sense at the end is almost accidental. And then you read it a few more times, simultaneously finding out more about writing yourself, and you realize what an absolute tour de force it was, making something as beautifully honed as that appear so casual.\\" The P-MODEL song Harmonium from the 1986 album ONE PATTERN was influenced by this novel. Years later, the group made the song WELCOME TO THE HOUSE OF \\"TIME'S LEAKING THROUGH EQUAL DISTANCE CURVE\\" from the 1993 album big body, which was also influenced by the novel; the song's Japanese title, could be adapted as \\"Welcome to chrono-synclastic infundibulum\\". Brian Warren, frontman of San Diego indie rock band Weatherbox, has claimed that he used the novel as a divinatory text in the composition of the band's 2009 album The Cosmic Drama. In a 2013 episode of the FX animated sitcom Archer, two main characters are sent to Tangier in order to rescue a friendly agent by the name of Kazak, who happens to be a large English Mastiff in a nod to the novel. Boaz and Unk are the names of the two main characters in the Korean film Cancelled Faces, which was directed by Lior Shamriz and premiered at the Berlin Film Festival in 2015. Towards the climax of the film, Boaz tells his friend: Don't truth me Unk, and I won't truth you - a direct quote from the book.

The rind's fragrant oil is added to black tea to give Earl Grey its unique taste. Traditionally, Earl Grey was made from black teas such as China keemun and therefore intended to be drunk without milk. However, tea companies have since begun to offer Earl Grey based upon stronger teas such as Ceylons which are better suited to the addition of milk or cream. Other varieties have been introduced as well, such as green or oolong. History Tin of Earl Grey tea The Earl Grey blend, or \\"Earl Grey's Mixture\\", is assumed to be named after Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, British Prime Minister in the 1830s and author of the Reform Bill of 1832. He reputedly received a gift, probably a diplomatic perquisite, of tea flavoured with bergamot oil.Kramer, Ione. All the Tea in China. China Books, 1990. . Pages 180-181. A \\"Grey's Tea\\" is known from the 1850s, but the first known published references to an \\"Earl Grey\\" tea are advertisements by Charlton & Co. of Jermyn Street in London in the 1880s. According to one legend, a grateful Chinese mandarin whose son was rescued from drowning by one of Lord Grey's men first presented the blend to the Earl in 1803. The tale appears to be apocryphal, as Lord Grey never set foot in China and the use of bergamot oil to scent tea was then unknown in China. However, this tale is subsequently told (and slightly corrected) on the Twinings website, as \\"having been presented by an envoy on his return from China\\". Jacksons of Piccadilly claim they originated Earl Grey's Tea, Lord Grey having given the recipe to Robert Jackson & Co. partner George Charlton in 1830. According to Jacksons, the original recipe has been in constant production and has never left their hands. Theirs has been based on Chinese black tea since the beginning. According to the Grey family, the tea was specially blended by a Chinese mandarin for Lord Grey, to suit the water at Howick Hall, the family seat in Northumberland, using bergamot in particular to offset the preponderance of lime in the local water. Lady Grey used it to entertain in London as a political hostess, and it proved so popular that she was asked if it could be sold to others, which is how Twinings came to market it as a brand. A 2010 survey found that a significant minority of people in the United Kingdom associate drinking Earl Grey tea with being \\"posh\\" or upper class. Preparation and variations A bergamot orange from Calabria, Italy \\"Earl Grey\\" as applied to tea is not a registered trademark, and numerous tea companies produce their own versions of Earl Grey tea, using a wide variety of tea leaves and additives. Bergamot orange (Citrus bergamia) is a small citrus tree which blossoms during the winter and is grown commercially in Calabria, Italy. It is probably a hybrid of Citrus limetta (sweet lime) and Citrus aurantium (bitter orange). *There are different varieties of a tea known as Lady Grey; the two most common kinds being cornflower Lady Grey and citrus Lady Grey, which combine Earl Grey tea with cornflower and Seville oranges, respectively. \\"Lady Grey\\" is a trademark of Twinings. *A beverage called \\"London Fog\\" is a combination of Earl Grey, steamed milk and vanilla syrup. *There are variations available including such ingredients as jasmine, as well as various flowers. A blend with added rose petals is known as French Earl Grey, which has become the most popular blend at Australian tea store T2. *A variety called Russian Earl Grey often contains ingredients such as citrus peels and lemon grass in addition to the usual black tea and bergamot. *Also, several companies make a tea called Earl Grey Green or \\"Earl Green\\" tea, combining green tea leaves rather than the traditional black tea leaves with bergamot flavouring. A similar variation called Earl Grey White or \\"Earl White\\" tea combines white tea leaves with bergamot flavouring. *Rooibos Earl Grey is a variation using this South African herbal tea as a substitute for the conventional form made with black tea. *Fortnum & Mason produce Smoky Earl Grey, containing bergamot, Lapsang Souchong, and Gunpowder tea. It is reputedly the favoured tea of Queen Elizabeth II. Use as a flavouring Earl Grey tea is used as a flavouring for many types of cakes and confectionery, such as chocolates, as well as savoury sauces. For sauces, the flavour is normally created by adding tea bags to the basic stock, boiling for a few minutes and then discarding the bags. For sweet recipes, loose tea is often added to melted butter or hot cream and strained after the flavour is infused. Toxicology In several studies, application of high concentrations of some brands of bergamot oil directly to the skin was shown to increase redness after exposure to ultraviolet light; however, this should not apply to ordinary oral consumption of Earl Grey tea. Bergamot is a source of bergamottin which, along with the chemically related compound 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin, is known to be responsible for grapefruit‚Äìdrug interactions in which the consumption of the juice affects the metabolism of a variety of pharmaceutical drugs. In one case study, a patient who consumed four litres of Earl Grey tea per day reported muscle cramps, which were attributed to the function of the bergapten in bergamot oil as a potassium channel blocker. The symptoms subsided upon reducing his consumption of Earl Grey tea to one litre per day.

It is moderately effective, with a one-year failure rate of around 12% with typical use. It is placed over the cervix with spermicide before sex and left in place for at least six hours after sex. Fitting by a healthcare provider is generally required. Side effects are usually very few. Use may increase the risk of bacterial vaginosis and urinary tract infections. If left in the vagina for more than 24 hours toxic shock syndrome may occur. While use may decrease the risk of sexually transmitted infections, it is not very effective at doing so. There are a number of types of diaphragms with different rim and spring designs. They may be made from latex, silicone, or natural rubber. They work by blocking access to and holding spermicide near the cervix. The diaphragm came into use around 1882. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. In the United Kingdom they cost the NHS less than ¬£10 each. In the United States they cost about US$15 to $75 and are the birth control method of 0.3% of people. These costs do not include that of spermicide. Medical use Before inserting or removing a diaphragm, one's hands should be washed to avoid introducing harmful bacteria into the vaginal canal. The rim of a diaphragm is squeezed into an oval or arc shape for insertion. A water-based lubricant (usually spermicide) may be applied to the rim of the diaphragm to aid insertion. One teaspoon (5 mL) of spermicide may be placed in the dome of the diaphragm before insertion, or with an applicator after insertion. The diaphragm must be inserted sometime before sexual intercourse, and remain in the vagina for 6 to 8 hours after a man's last ejaculation. For multiple acts of intercourse, it is recommended that an additional 5 mL of spermicide be inserted into the vagina (not into the dome‚Äîthe seal of the diaphragm should not be broken) before each act. Upon removal, a diaphragm should be cleansed with mild soap and warm water before storage. The diaphragm must be removed for cleaning at least once every 24 hours and can be re- inserted immediately. Oil-based products should not be used with latex diaphragms. Lubricants or vaginal medications that contain oil will cause the latex to rapidly degrade and greatly increases the chances of the diaphragm breaking or tearing. Natural latex rubber will degrade over time. Depending on usage and storage conditions, a latex diaphragm should be replaced every one to three years. Silicone diaphragms may last much longer‚Äîup to ten years. =Effectiveness= The effectiveness of diaphragms, as of most forms of contraception, can be assessed two ways: method effectiveness and actual effectiveness. The method effectiveness is the proportion of couples correctly and consistently using the method who do not become pregnant. Actual effectiveness is the proportion of couples who intended that method as their sole form of birth control and do not become pregnant; it includes couples who sometimes use the method incorrectly, or sometimes not at all. Rates are generally presented for the first year of use. Most commonly the Pearl Index is used to calculate effectiveness rates, but some studies use decrement tables. For all forms of contraception, actual effectiveness is lower than method effectiveness, due to several factors: * mistakes on the part of those providing instructions on how to use the method * mistakes on the part of the method's users * conscious user non-compliance with method For instance, someone using a diaphragm might be fitted incorrectly by a health care provider, or by mistake remove the diaphragm too soon after intercourse, or simply choose to have intercourse without placing the diaphragm. Contraceptive Technology reports that the method failure rate of the diaphragm with spermicide is 6% per year. The actual pregnancy rates among diaphragm users vary depending on the population being studied, with yearly rates of 10% to 39%, which cites: : being reported. Unlike some other cervical barriers, the effectiveness of the diaphragm is the same for women who have given birth as for those who have not. =Advantages= The diaphragm does not interfere with a woman's menstrual cycle, therefore, no reversal or wait time is necessary if contraception is no longer wanted or needed. The diaphragm only has to be used during intercourse. Many women, especially those who have sex less frequently, prefer barrier contraception such as the diaphragm over methods that require some action every day. Like all cervical barriers, diaphragms may be inserted several hours before use, allowing uninterrupted foreplay and intercourse. Most couples find that neither partner can feel the diaphragm during intercourse. The diaphragm is less expensive than many other methods of contraception. =Sexually transmitted infections= There is some evidence that the cells in the cervix are particularly susceptible to certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Cervical barriers such as diaphragms may offer some protection against these infections. However, research conducted to test whether the diaphragm offers protection from HIV found that women provided with both male condoms and a diaphragm experienced the same rate of HIV infection as women provided with male condoms alone. Because pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is caused by certain STIs, diaphragms may lower the risk of PID. Cervical barriers may also protect against human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes cervical cancer, although the protection appears to be due to the spermicide used with diaphragms and not the barrier itself. Diaphragms are also considered a good candidate as a delivery method for microbicides (preparations that, used vaginally, protect against STIs) that are currently in development. Side effects Women (or their partners) who are allergic to latex should not use a latex diaphragm. Diaphragms are associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) Urinating before inserting the diaphragm, and also after intercourse, may reduce this risk. Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) occurs at a rate of 2.4 cases per 100,000 women using diaphragms, almost exclusively when the device is left in place longer than 24 hours. The increase in risk of UTIs may be due to the diaphragm applying pressure to the urethra, especially if the diaphragm is too large, and causing irritation and preventing the bladder from emptying fully. However, the spermicide nonoxynol-9 is itself associated with increased risk of UTI, yeast infection, and bacterial vaginosis. For this reason, some advocate use of lactic acid or lemon juice based spermicides, which might have fewer side effects. It has also been suggested that, for women who experience side effects from nonoxynol-9, it may be acceptable to use the diaphragm without any spermicide. One study found an actual pregnancy rate of 24% per year in women using the diaphragm without spermicide; however, all women in this study were given a 60 mm diaphragm rather than being fitted by a clinician. Other studies have been small and given conflicting results. The current recommendation is still for all diaphragm users to use spermicide with the device. In the early 1920s, Marie Stopes claimed that when wearing a diaphragm, the vagina is stretched such that certain movements made by the woman for the benefit of the man were restricted by the diaphragm spring. In later years there was some discussion of this, with two authors supporting this concept and one opposed. One of them argued in the later 1920s-1930s, that while the muscle movement by women is restricted it doesn't make all that much difference since most \\"women (in the 1920s) are not able to operate their pelvic muscles voluntarily to the best advantage\\" (during sex). However, Stopes anticipated this rebuttal, and in so many words classified it as a lame excuse.cook, Hera: The long sexual revolution: English women, sex and contraception 1800-1975. Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 247-8 Types Diaphragms are available in diameters of 50 mm to 105mm (about 2‚Äì4 inches). They are available in two different materials: latex and silicone. Diaphragms are also available with different types of springs in the rim. An arcing spring folds into an arc shape when the sides are compressed. This is the strongest type of rim available in a diaphragm, and may be used by women with any level of vaginal tone. Unlike other spring types, arcing springs may be used by women with mild cystocele, rectocele, or retroversion. Arcing spring diaphragms may be easier to insert correctly than other spring types. A coil spring flattens into an oval shape when the sides are compressed. This rim is not as strong as the arcing spring, and may only be used by women with average or firm vaginal tone. If an arcing spring diaphragm is uncomfortable for a woman or, during intercourse, her partner, a coil spring may prove more satisfactory. Unlike the arcing spring diaphragms, coil springs may be inserted with a device called an introducer. A flat spring is much like a coil spring, but thinner. This type of rim may only be used by women with firm vaginal tone. Flat spring diaphragms may also be inserted with an introducer for women uncomfortable using their hands. Ortho used to manufacture a flat-spring diaphragm called the Ortho White. Reflexions also manufactured a flat-spring diaphragm up until 2014. There are a number of variations. The SILCS diaphragm is made of silicone, has an arcing spring, and a finger cup is molded on one end for easy removal. The Duet disposable diaphragm is made of dipped polyurethane, pre-filled with BufferGel (BufferGel is currently in clinical trials as a spermicide and microbicide). Both the SILCS and Duet diaphragms are one-size-fits-all. =Fitting= bladder, 2: pubic bone, 3: urethra, 4: vagina, 5: uterus, 6: fornix, 7: cervix, 8: diaphragm, 9: rectum Diaphragms usually come in different sizes and require a fitting appointment with a health care professional to determine which size a woman should wear. Single size diaphragms that do not require fitting also exist. A correctly fitting diaphragm will cover the cervix and rest snugly against the pubic bone. A diaphragm that is too small might fit inside the vagina without covering the cervix, or might become dislodged from the cervix during intercourse or bowel movements. It is also more likely that a woman's partner will feel the anterior rim of a diaphragm that is too small during intercourse. A diaphragm that is too large will place pressure on the urethra, preventing the bladder from emptying completely and increasing the risk of urinary tract infection. A diaphragm that is too large may also cause a sore to develop on the vaginal wall. Diaphragms should be re-fitted after a weight change of 4.5 kg (10 lb) or more. The traditional clinical guideline is that a decrease in weight may cause a woman to need a larger size, although the strength of this relationship has been questioned. Diaphragms should also be re-fitted after any pregnancy of 14 weeks or longer. Full-term vaginal delivery especially will tend to increase the size diaphragm a woman needs, although the changes to the pelvic floor during pregnancy mean even women who experience second-trimester miscarriage, or deliver by C-section, should be refitted. Vaginal tenting, an increase in the length of the vagina, occurs during arousal. This means that during intercourse, the diaphragm will not fit snugly against the pubic bone because it is carried higher up the vaginal canal by the movement of the cervix. If the diaphragm is inserted after arousal has begun, extra care must be taken to ensure the device is covering the cervix. A woman might be fitted with a different size diaphragm depending on where she is in her menstrual cycle. It is common for a woman to wear a larger diaphragm during menstruation. It has been speculated that a woman may be fitted with a larger size diaphragm when she is near ovulation. The correct size for a woman is the largest size that she can wear comfortably throughout her cycle. In the United States, diaphragms are available by prescription only. Many other countries do not require prescriptions. Mechanism of action The spring in the rim of the diaphragm forms a seal against the vaginal walls. The diaphragm covers the cervix, and physically prevents sperm from entering the uterus through the os. Traditionally, the diaphragm has been used with spermicide, and it is widely believed the spermicide significantly increases the effectiveness of the diaphragm. Insufficient studies have been conducted to determine effectiveness without spermicide. It is widely taught that additional spermicide must be placed in the vagina if intercourse occurs more than six hours after insertion. However, there has been very little research on how long spermicide remains active within the diaphragm. One study found that spermicidal jelly and creme used in a diaphragm retained its full spermicidal activity for twelve hours after placement of the diaphragm. It has long been recommended that the diaphragm be left in place for at least six or eight hours after intercourse. No studies have been done to determine the validity of this recommendation, however, and some medical professionals have suggested intervals of four hours or even two hours are sufficient to ensure efficacy. One manufacturer of contraceptive sponges recommends leaving the sponge in place for only two hours after intercourse. However, such use of the diaphragm (removal before 6 hours post-intercourse) has never been formally studied, and cannot be recommended. It has been suggested that diaphragms be dispensed as a one-size-fits-all device, providing all women with the most common size (70 mm). However, only 33% of women fitted for a diaphragm are prescribed a 70 mm size, and correct sizing of the diaphragm is widely considered necessary. History Photo of Caya diaphragm The idea of blocking the cervix to prevent pregnancy is thousands of years old. Various cultures have used cervix-shaped devices such as oiled paper cones or lemon halves, or have made sticky mixtures that include honey or cedar resin to be applied to the cervical opening. However, the diaphragm‚Äîwhich stays in place because of the spring in its rim, rather than hooking over the cervix or being sticky‚Äîis of more recent origin. An important precursor to the invention of the diaphragm was the rubber vulcanization process, patented by Charles Goodyear in 1844. In the 1880s, a German gynecologist, Wilhelm P. J. Mensinga, published the first description of a rubber contraceptive device with a spring molded into the rim. Wilhelm P. J. Mensinga (1836-1910) wrote first under the pseudonym C. Hasse, and the Mensinga diaphragm was the only brand available for many decades.√úber die facultative Sterilit√§t vom prophylaktischen und hygienischen Standpunkt (Pseudonym C.

Sanger learned about the diaphragm in the Netherlands and introduced the product to the United States when she returned in 1916. Sanger and her second husband, Noah Slee, illegally imported large quantities of the devices from Germany and the Netherlands. In 1925, Slee provided funding to Sanger's friend Herbert Simonds, who used the funds to found the first diaphragm manufacturing company in the U.S., the Holland- Rantos Company. Diaphragms played a role in overturning the federal Comstock Act. In 1932, Sanger arranged for a Japanese manufacturer to mail a package of diaphragms to a New York physician who supported Sanger's activism. U.S. customs confiscated the package, and Sanger helped file a lawsuit. In 1936, in the court case United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries, a federal appellate court ruled that the package could be delivered. Although in Europe, the cervical cap was more popular than the diaphragm, the diaphragm became one of the most widely used contraceptives in the United States. In 1940, one- third of all U.S. married couples used a diaphragm for contraception. The number of women using diaphragms dropped dramatically after the 1960s introduction of the IUD and the combined oral contraceptive pill. In 1965, only 10% of U.S. married couples used a diaphragm for contraception. That number has continued to fall, and in 2002 only 0.2% of American women were using a diaphragm as their primary method of contraception. See Table 56. In 2014 Janssen Pharmaceuticals announced the discontinuation of the Ortho-All Flex Diaphragm, making it very difficult for women in the US to have that option as a birth-control method.Ortho Diaphragm Discontinued  The Blog That Ate Manhattan The single-sized, silicone diaphragm was developed by PATH during the late 2000s. It was licensed to Kessel Marketing & Vertriebs GmbH of Frankfurt, Germany which began to market it as the Caya Diaphragm. The diaphragm was approved for contraception in Europe in 2013 and in the United States the following year. Since then, Kessel has also developed a traditionally circular, multi-sized diaphragm made from the same materials that they released in Germany in 2020 under the name Singa.

The station is located on Cockfosters Road (A111) approximately nine miles () from central London and serves Cockfosters in the London Borough of Barnet, although it is actually located a short distance across the borough boundary in the neighbouring London Borough of Enfield. The station is in Travelcard Zone 5 and the next station south-east is Oakwood. History The station opened on 31 July 1933, the last of the stations on the extension of the line from Finsbury Park to do so and four months after Oakwood station (then called Enfield West) opened. Prior to its opening, Trent Park and Cock Fosters (an early spelling of the area's name) were suggested as alternative station names. The original site hoarding displayed the name as a single word. The station was designed by Charles Holden in a modern European style using brick, glass and reinforced concrete. Compared with the other new stations Holden designed for the extension, Cockfosters' street buildings are modest in scale, lacking the mass of Oakwood or Arnos Grove or the avant-garde flourish of Southgate. Holden's early design sketches show the station with two towers. The most striking feature of the station is the tall concrete and glass trainshed roof and platform canopies, which are supported by portal frames of narrow blade-like concrete columns and beams rising from the platforms and spanning across the tracks. The trainshed roof constructed at Uxbridge from 1937 to 1938 was built to a similar design. Cockfosters station is a Grade II listed building. The station has three tracks with platforms numbered 1 to 4, the centre track being served from both sides by platforms 2 and 3. This is an example of the so-called Spanish solution. Most eastbound Piccadilly trains terminate here, although some terminate at Arnos Grove or Oakwood, particularly in peak hours or in the evenings. Some trains may even terminate at Wood Green; however, this is only used very early in the morning or in emergency situations. Cockfosters depot is located between Oakwood and Cockfosters and trains can access or leave it from either direction. In September 2020, works to provide step free access were completed with a lift providing access to the platform, making Cockfosters the 80th accessible Tube station.  Future  In the late 2010s, the station car park at Cockfosters was proposed by Transport for London (TfL) for property development, as part of TfL's plans to increase the amount of income generated from land in their ownership. , over 350 new homes (with 40% affordable homes) are currently planned to be built on the current car park at the station by TfL and Grainger. The proposals also include new public space, cycle parking and dedicated disabled car parking spaces. The proposal has been criticised by local residents, due to the loss of Tube car parking and the amount of new homes proposed on the site.

History  In April 1990 Joachim Alfred W√ºnning made experiments with industrial gasoline engines thereby observing that beyond a temperature of 850 ¬∞C the flames were blown away. The German word \\"flammenlose Oxidation\\" (flameless oxidation) is the origin of the name for the FLOX-Technology that was derived from the effect. Its specific advantages led to additional funding including a project \\"FLoxCoal\\" at the Stuttgart University to engineer a prototype of an atomizing burner for coal without flame reactions.  Technology  The NOx formation is specifically located in the flame front so that by suppressing peak flame the NOx emission can be reduced theoretically to zero. In the practical implementations in current burner technology a reduction of 20% was observed for Rhenisch brown coal and 65% for Polish black coal. The role of combustion temperature in NOx formation has been understood for some time. Reduction of the combustion temperature in gasoline engines, by reducing the compression ratio, was among the first steps taken to comply with the U.S. clean air act in the 1970s. This lowers the NOx emissions by lowering the temperature at the flame front.

This behaviour is a consequence of Le Chatelier's principle for the equilibrium reaction of the ionic association/dissociation. The effect is commonly seen as an effect on the solubility of salts and other weak electrolytes. Adding an additional amount of one of the ions of the salt generally leads to increased precipitation of the salt, which reduces the concentration of both ions of the salt until the solubility equilibrium is reached. The effect is based on the fact that both the original salt and the other added chemical have one ion in common with each other.  Examples of the common-ion effect  =Dissociation of hydrogen sulphide in presence of hydrochloric acid= Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is a weak electrolyte. It is weakly ionized in its aqueous solution. There exists an equilibrium between unionized molecules and the ions in an aqueous medium as follows: :H2S 2 H+ \\\\+ S2- By applying the law of mass action, we have :K_\\\\ce{a}=\\\\frac{[H^+]^2 [\\\\ce S^{2-}]} {[H_2S]} To the above solution of H2S , if we add hydrochloric acid, then it ionizes completely as :HCl ‚Üí H+ \\\\+ Cl‚àí This makes H+ a common ion and creates a common ion effect. Due to the increase in concentration of H+ ions, the equilibrium of dissociation of H2S shifts to the left and keeps the value of Ka constant. Thus the ionization of H2S is decreased. The concentration of unionized H2S is increased. As a result, the concentration of sulphide ions is decreased. =Solubility of barium iodate in presence of barium nitrate= Barium iodate, Ba(IO3)2, has a solubility product Ksp = [Ba2+][IO3‚àí]2 = 1.57 x 10‚àí9. Its solubility in pure water is 7.32 x 10‚àí4 M. However in a solution that is 0.0200 M in barium nitrate, Ba(NO3)2, the increase in the common ion barium leads to a decrease in iodate ion concentration. The solubility is therefore reduced to 1.40 x 10‚àí4 M, about five times smaller. Solubility effects A practical example used very widely in areas drawing drinking water from chalk or limestone aquifers is the addition of sodium carbonate to the raw water to reduce the hardness of the water. In the water treatment process, highly soluble sodium carbonate salt is added to precipitate out sparingly soluble calcium carbonate. The very pure and finely divided precipitate of calcium carbonate that is generated is a valuable by-product used in the manufacture of toothpaste. The salting-out process used in the manufacture of soaps benefits from the common-ion effect. Soaps are sodium salts of fatty acids. Addition of sodium chloride reduces the solubility of the soap salts. The soaps precipitate due to a combination of common-ion effect and increased ionic strength. Sea, brackish and other waters that contain appreciable amount of sodium ions (Na+) interfere with the normal behavior of soap because of common-ion effect. In the presence of excess Na+, the solubility of soap salts is reduced, making the soap less effective.  Buffering effect A buffer solution contains an acid and its conjugate base or a base and its conjugate acid. Addition of the conjugate ion will result in a change of pH of the buffer solution. For example, if both sodium acetate and acetic acid are dissolved in the same solution they both dissociate and ionize to produce acetate ions. Sodium acetate is a strong electrolyte, so it dissociates completely in solution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it only ionizes slightly. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the addition of acetate ions from sodium acetate will suppress the ionization of acetic acid and shift its equilibrium to the left. Thus the percent dissociation of the acetic acid will decrease, and the pH of the solution will increase. The ionization of an acid or a base is limited by the presence of its conjugate base or acid. : NaCH3CO2(s) ‚Üí Na+(aq) + CH3CO2‚àí(aq) : CH3CO2H(aq) H+(aq) + CH3CO2‚àí(aq) This will decrease the hydronium concentration, and thus the common-ion solution will be less acidic than a solution containing only acetic acid. Exceptions Many transition-metal compounds violate this rule due to the formation of complex ions, a scenario not part of the equilibria that are involved in simple precipitation of salts from ionic solution. For example, copper(I) chloride is insoluble in water, but it dissolves when chloride ions are added, such as when hydrochloric acid is added. This is due to the formation of soluble CuCl2‚àí complex ions.  Uncommon-ion effect  Sometimes adding an ion other than the ones that are part of the precipitated salt itself can increase the solubility of the salt. This \\"salting in\\" is called the \\"uncommon-ion effect\\" (also \\"salt effect\\" or the \\"diverse-ion effect\\"). It occurs because as the total ion concentration increases, inter-ion attraction within the solution can become an important factor. This alternate equilibrium makes the ions less available for the precipitation reaction. This is also called odd ion effect.

He was killed in action during the invasion of Normandy. Poetry Douglas described his poetic style as \\"extrospective\\"; that is, he focused on external impressions rather than inner emotions. The result is a poetry which, according to his detractors, can be callous in the midst of war's atrocities. For others, Douglas's work is powerful and unsettling because its exact descriptions eschew egotism and shift the burden of emotion from the poet to the reader. His best poetry is generally considered to rank alongside the 20th century's finest soldier- poetry. In his poem, \\"Desert Flowers\\" (1943), Douglas mentions World War I poet Isaac Rosenberg, claiming that he is only repeating what Rosenberg has already written. Early life Douglas was born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, the son of Capt. Keith Sholto Douglas, MC (retired) and Marie Josephine Castellain. His mother became unwell and collapsed in 1924 of encephalitis lethargica, never to fully recover. By 1926, the chicken farm business set up by his father had failed. Douglas was sent to Edgeborough School, a preparatory school in Guildford, the same year. The family became increasingly poor, and his father had to leave home in early 1928 to seek better employment in Wales. The persistent ill-health of Marie led to the collapse of the marriage of his parents by the end of that year, and his father remarried in 1930. Douglas was deeply hurt by his father not communicating with him after 1928, and when Capt. Douglas did write at last in 1938, Keith did not agree to meet him. In one of his letters written in 1940 Douglas looked back on his childhood: \\"I lived alone during the most fluid and formative years of my life, and during that time I lived on my imagination, which was so powerful as to persuade me that the things I imagined would come true.\\" =Education= Marie Douglas faced extreme financial distress, so much so that only the generosity of the Edgeborough headmaster Mr. James permitted Douglas to attend school in 1930‚Äì1931, his last year there. Douglas sat in 1931 for the entrance examination to Christ's Hospital, where education was free and there was monetary assistance to cover all other costs. He was accepted, and joined Christ's Hospital, near Horsham, in September 1931, studying there till 1938. It was at this school that his considerable poetic talent and artistic ability were recognised. So was his cavalier attitude to authority and property, which nearly led to expulsion in 1935 over a purloined training rifle. In surprising contrast, he excelled as a member of the school's Officers Training Corps, particularly enjoying drill, although he was philosophically opposed to militarism. =University= After his bruising brush with authority in 1935, Douglas settled down to a less troubled and more productive period at school, during which he excelled both at studies and games, and at the end of which he won an open exhibition to Merton College, Oxford in 1938 to read History and English. The First World War-veteran and well-known poet Edmund Blunden was his tutor at Merton, and regarded his poetic talent highly. Blunden sent his poems to T. S. Eliot, the doyen of English poetry, who found Douglas's verses 'impressive'. Douglas became the editor of Cherwell, and one of the poets anthologised in the collection Eight Oxford Poets (1941), although by the time that volume appeared he was already in the army. He does not seem to have been acquainted with somewhat junior but contemporary Oxford poets such as Sidney Keyes, Drummond Allison, John Heath-Stubbs and Philip Larkin, who would make names for themselves. At Oxford, he was good friends with J. C. Hall who became his literary executor. At Oxford, Douglas entered a relationship with a sophisticated Chinese student named Yingcheng, or Betty Sze, the daughter of a diplomat. Her own sentiments towards him were less intense, and she refused to marry him. Yingcheng remained the unrequited love of Douglas's life and the source of his best romantic verse, despite his involvements with other women later, most notably Milena Guiterrez Penya. Military service Keith Douglas's grave, in Tilly-sur-Seulles War Cemetery in Normandy Within days of the declaration of war he reported to an army recruiting centre with the intention of joining a cavalry regiment, but like many others keen to serve he had to wait, and it was not until July 1940 that he started his training. After attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he was commissioned on 1 February 1941 into the 2nd Derbyshire Yeomanry at Ripon. He was posted to the Middle East in July 1941 and transferred to the Nottinghamshire (Sherwood Rangers) Yeomanry. Posted initially at Cairo and Palestine, he found himself stuck at headquarters twenty miles behind El Alamein as a camouflage officer as the Second Battle of El Alamein began. At dawn on 24 October 1942, the Regiment advanced, and suffered numerous casualties from enemy anti-tank guns. Chafing at inactivity, Douglas took off against orders on 27 October, drove to the Regimental HQ in a truck, and reported to the C.O., Colonel E. O. Kellett, lying that he had been instructed to go to the front (luckily this escapade did not land him in serious trouble; in a reprise of 1935, Douglas got off with an apology). Desperately needing officer replacements, the Colonel posted him to A Squadron, and gave him the opportunity to take part as a fighting tanker in the Eighth Army's victorious sweep through North Africa, vividly recounted in his memoir Alamein to Zem Zem, which was illustrated with his own drawings. =Death= Captain Douglas returned from North Africa to England in December 1943 and took part in the D-Day invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944. On the 9 June Douglas's armoured unit was pinned down on high ground overlooking Tilly-sur-Seulles. Concerned by the lack of progress, Douglas dismounted his tank to undertake a personal reconnaissance during which he was killed by a German mortar. The regimental chaplain Captain Leslie Skinner buried him by a hedge, close to where he had died on \\"forward slopes point 102\\". Shortly after the war his remains were reburied at Tilly-sur-Seulles War Cemetery (14 km south of Bayeux) in plot 1, row E, grave number 2.

Concretely, for a partially ordered set (S, ‚â§) one represents each element of S as a vertex in the plane and draws a line segment or curve that goes upward from x to y whenever y covers x (that is, whenever x < y and there is no z such that x < z < y). These curves may cross each other but must not touch any vertices other than their endpoints. Such a diagram, with labeled vertices, uniquely determines its partial order. The diagrams are named after Helmut Hasse (1898‚Äì1979); according to , they are so called because of the effective use Hasse made of them. However, Hasse was not the first to use these diagrams. One example that predates Hasse can be found in . Although Hasse diagrams were originally devised as a technique for making drawings of partially ordered sets by hand, they have more recently been created automatically using graph drawing techniques.E.g., see and . The phrase \\"Hasse diagram\\" may also refer to the transitive reduction as an abstract directed acyclic graph, independently of any drawing of that graph, but this usage is eschewed here.... A \\"good\\" Hasse diagram Although Hasse diagrams are simple as well as intuitive tools for dealing with finite posets, it turns out to be rather difficult to draw \\"good\\" diagrams. The reason is that there will in general be many possible ways to draw a Hasse diagram for a given poset. The simple technique of just starting with the minimal elements of an order and then drawing greater elements incrementally often produces quite poor results: symmetries and internal structure of the order are easily lost. The following example demonstrates the issue. Consider the power set of a 4-element set ordered by inclusion \\\\subseteq. Below are four different Hasse diagrams for this partial order. Each subset has a node labelled with a binary encoding that shows whether a certain element is in the subset (1) or not (0): { style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"        } The first diagram makes clear that the power set is a graded poset. The second diagram has the same graded structure, but by making some edges longer than others, it emphasizes that the 4-dimensional cube is a combinatorial union of two 3-dimensional cubes, and that a tetrahedron (abstract 3-polytope) likewise merges two triangles (abstract 2-polytopes). The third diagram shows some of the internal symmetry of the structure. In the fourth diagram the vertices are arranged like the elements of a 4√ó4 matrix. Upward planarity This Hasse diagram of the lattice of subgroups of the dihedral group Dih4 has no crossing edges. If a partial order can be drawn as a Hasse diagram in which no two edges cross, its covering graph is said to be upward planar. A number of results on upward planarity and on crossing-free Hasse diagram construction are known: *If the partial order to be drawn is a lattice, then it can be drawn without crossings if and only if it has order dimension at most two., Theorem 9, p. 118; , theorem 4.1, page 18. In this case, a non-crossing drawing may be found by deriving Cartesian coordinates for the elements from their positions in the two linear orders realizing the order dimension, and then rotating the drawing counterclockwise by a 45-degree angle. *If the partial order has at most one minimal element, or it has at most one maximal element, then it may be tested in linear time whether it has a non-crossing Hasse diagram., Theorem 15, p. 125; . *It is NP-complete to determine whether a partial order with multiple sources and sinks can be drawn as a crossing- free Hasse diagram., Corollary 1, p. 132; . However, finding a crossing-free Hasse diagram is fixed-parameter tractable when parametrized by the number of articulation points and triconnected components of the transitive reduction of the partial order.. *If the y-coordinates of the elements of a partial order are specified, then a crossing-free Hasse diagram respecting those coordinate assignments can be found in linear time, if such a diagram exists.. In particular, if the input poset is a graded poset, it is possible to determine in linear time whether there is a crossing-free Hasse diagram in which the height of each vertex is proportional to its rank.

Monty Cantsin was originally conceived as an \\"open pop star.\\" In a philosophy anticipating that of free software and open source, anyone could perform in his name and thus contribute to and participate in his fame and achievements. History The name was coined in 1978 by the critic, prankster and Mail Artist David Zack as a nom de plume for the Latvian-born poet and singer Maris Kundzins. It further alludes to: * Martial Canterel, the wizard- hero of Raymond Roussel's novel Locus Solus; * Monte Capanno, a Northern Italian villa near Perugia where Zack had taught a San Jose State College study and living community in 1970; * Monte Cazazza, a Californian performance artist and industrial music performer; * Istvan Kantor, the second bearer of the name; * \\"Monty can't sing\\"; * \\"Monty can't sin\\", a reference to religious free spirit movements which collectively adopted the names of Jesus or saints. Zack called upon his correspondents to adopt the name Monty Cantsin. His suggestion was taken up in 1979 by the Hungarian-Canadian performance artist Istvan Kantor, who amalgamated the name into Neoism. As the shared identity of all Neoists, Monty Cantsin was transformed from a \\"pop star\\" to a radical identity experiment occupying the everyday life of Neoists and culminating in frequently extremist ways at Neoist Apartment Festivals (\\"APTs\\"). The \\"open pop star\\" concept lived on in a series of electropop and industrial music albums and performances of, mainly, Istvan Kantor. Influences Later multiple names like Karen Eliot and Luther Blissett drew inspiration from Monty Cantsin and Neoism, but intentionally avoided association with physical persons, being conceived either as mere signatures (Eliot), collective media phantoms (Blissett) or multiple single collective experiments.

Life James Beaton was the sixth and youngest son of John Beaton of Balfour, in Fife. He graduated as Master of Arts at St. Andrews University in 1493, was appointed Precentor of Dornoch Cathedral (Diocese of Caithness) in 1497 and in 1503 was appointed Provost of the Collegiate Church of Bothwell. In 1504 he became Prior of Whithorn and Abbot of Dunfermline and in 1505 was made Lord High Treasurer of Scotland by James IV.Hunter-Blair, Oswald. \\"James Beaton.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 24 July 2015 In 1508 he was elected as Bishop of Galloway, in succession to George Vaus, but before his consecration he was chosen to succeed Robert Blackadder as Archbishop of Glasgow and was consecrated at Stirling on 15 April 1509. With the archbishopric he held the commendatory Abbeys of Arbroath and Kilwinning, and in 1515 he became Lord Chancellor of Scotland. King James V was at this time a child and Beaton, as one of the Council of Regency, was one of the most important people in the kingdom during the minority of the young king. In 1522 Beaton was transferred to St. Andrews bishopric, vacant by the death of Archbishop Forman. As primate he threw all his powerful influence into the scale against the intrigues of Henry VIII to obtain predominance in Scotland. He was chiefly responsible for the king's action in allying himself with France and not with England. The English ambassador described him as \\"greatest man both of lands and experience within this realm, and noted to be very crafty and dissimulating\\". In 1528 he ordered Patrick Hamilton burned for heresy. The Regent Albany's jealousy had deprived Beaton of the chancellorship some years previously, and he was never reappointed, though he enjoyed the full favour of the king. A few months after the second marriage of James to Mary of Guise, the primate got his nephew Cardinal Beaton appointed his coadjutor with right of succession. Archbishop James Beaton died in the autumn of 1539 in his castle at St. Andrews.

Hawkweeds, with their 10,000+ recorded species and subspecies, do their part to make Asteraceae the second largest family of flowers. Some botanists group all these species or subspecies into approximately 800 accepted species, while others prefer to accept several thousand species. Since most hawkweeds reproduce exclusively asexually by means of seeds that are genetically identical to their mother plant (apomixis or agamospermy), clones or populations that consist of genetically identical plants are formed and some botanists (especially in UK, Scandinavia and Russia) prefer to accept these clones as good species (arguing that it is impossible to know how these clones are interrelated) whereas others (mainly in Central Europe and USA) try to group them into a few hundred more broadly defined species. What is here treated as the single genus Hieracium is now treated by most European experts as two different genera, Hieracium and Pilosella, with species such as Hieracium pilosella, Hieracium floribundum and Hieracium aurantiacum referred to the latter genus. Many members of the genus Pilosella reproduce both by stolons (runners like those of strawberries) and by seeds, whereas true Hieracium species reproduce only by seeds. In Pilosella, many individual plants are capable of forming both normal sexual and asexual (apomictic) seeds, whereas individual plants of Hieracium only produce one kind of seeds. Another difference is that all species of Pilosella have leaves with smooth (entire) margins whereas most species of Hieracium have distinctly dentate to deeply cut or divided leaves.  Description  = Flowers and flower-heads = Hieracium or hawkweeds, like others in the family Asteraceae, have mostly yellow, tightly packed flower-heads of numerous small flowers but, unlike daisies and sunflowers in the same family, they have not two kinds of florets but only strap-shaped (spatulate) florets, each one of which is a complete flower in itself, not lacking stamens, and joined to the stem by leafy bracts. As in other members of the tribe Cichorieae, each ray corolla is tipped by 3 to 5 teeth. = Bracts, stems and leaves = Erect single, glabrous or hairy stems, sometimes branched away from the point of attachment, sometimes branched throughout. The hairiness of hawkweeds can be very complex: from surfaces with scattered to crowded, tapered, whiplike, straight or curly, smooth to setae; \\"stellate-pubescent\\" or surfaces with scattered to crowded, dendritically branched (often called, but seldom truly, \\"stellate\\") hairs; and \\"stipitate-glandular\\" or surfaces with scattered to crowded gland-tipped hairs mostly. Surfaces of stems, leaves, peduncles, and phyllaries may be glabrous or may bear one, two, or all three of the types of hairs mentioned above. Like the other members of the Chicory tribe, hawkweeds contain a milky latex.  Ecology  The Large Yellow Underwing (Noctua pronuba) feeds on Hieracium species.  Distribution  Hieracium species are native to Africa,Asia, Europe, North America, Central America and South America.  Species  The classification of Hieracium into species is notoriously difficult. One reason is the apomictic reproduction (in which plants asexually produce seeds), which tends to produce a lot of minor geographical variation. Over 9000 species names have been published in Hieracium but some botanists regard many of those as synonyms of larger species. =Europe= *Hieracium attenboroughianum ‚Äì Attenborough‚Äôs hawkweed *Hieracium lucidum Guss. ‚Äì Sicilian Sparviere *Hieracium insolitum (Zahn) √úksip *Hieracium villosum Jacq. =North America= The list below is a selection of species that have been accepted by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service and Canada.Key to Identification of Invasive and Native Hawkweeks (Hieracium spp.) in the Pacific Northwest, BC Ministry of Forests A more complete list is given in the list of Hieracium species. *Hieracium albertinum ‚Äì houndstongue hawkweed *Hieracium albiflorum Hook. ‚Äì white hawkweed *Hieracium √ó alleghaniense Britt.

He is most notable as a supporter and translator of German romantic literature. Early life He was born in Norwich, Norfolk, England on 7 November 1765, the only child of William Taylor (died 1819), a wealthy Norwich merchant with European trade connections, by his wife Sarah (died 1811), second daughter of John Wright of Diss, Norfolk. William Taylor was taught Latin, French and Dutch by John Bruckner, pastor of the French and Dutch Protestant churches in Norwich, in preparation for continuing his father's continental trading in textiles. In 1774 he was transferred to Palgrave Academy, Suffolk, by Rochemont Barbauld, whose wife Anna Letitia Barbauld Taylor regarded as a strong influence. For three years his school companion was Frank Sayers, who was to be a lifelong friend. In August 1779 his father took him from school. During the next three years he spent much of his time abroad. Firstly he visited the Netherlands, France, and Italy, learning languages and business methods. In 1781, he left home again, and spent a year in Detmold, staying with an Alsatian Protestant pastor called Roederer, and absorbing German literature under the influence of . Roederer gave him introductions to August Ludwig von Schl√∂zer the historian at G√∂ttingen, and to Goethe at Weimar. After further German travels he returned to Norwich on 17 November 1782. Intellectual and political radical Taylor was a Unitarian who attended the Octagon Chapel, Norwich. He became the leading figure of Norwich's literary circles, and a political radical. He applauded the French Revolution and argued for universal suffrage and the end of all governmental intervention in the affairs of religion. He wrote in the 18th century tradition of liberal and latitudinarian criticism of the Bible (which Sayers thought heretical, at least in part). In the period 1793 to 1799 he wrote over 200 reviews in periodicals, following his concept of \\"philosophical criticism\\". From 1783 Taylor was engaged in his father's business. In May and June 1784 he was in Scotland with Sayers, who had begun medical studies at Edinburgh; there he met James Mackintosh. A second journey to Edinburgh in 1788 followed a breakdown in Sayers' health. In November 1789 Taylor's father was made secretary of a Revolution Society in Norwich, formed to commemorate the Glorious Revolution of 1688. In May 1790 Taylor made a visit to France, and spent time at the National Assembly. He returned somewhat sceptical whether its members' rhetoric matched their intentions, but translated a number of its decrees for the Revolution Society. Before the end of 1790 two new clubs were formed in Norwich, of which Taylor became a member, the \\"Tusculan School\\" for political discussion, and the Speculative Society, founded by William Enfield for philosophical debate. Taylor became a leader of the Speculative Club. It lasted to 1797, dissolving after Enfield died. Around this point in time, Taylor persuaded his father to retire on his fortune. The firm was dissolved in 1791; his father employed part of his capital in underwriting, not very successfully. Taylor resisted his father's wish to put him into a London bank. William Taylor senior gave up his position as secretary to the Revolution Society by early 1792. In May 1794 government repression of radicals meant the Norwich Revolution Society closed down officially; and Taylor added \\"junior\\" to its written records, wherever his father's name appeared. In late 1794 a Norwich periodical, The Cabinet, was set up, publishing articles taking an anti-government view. It was supposed to be the work of a \\"Society of Gentlemen\\", the group behind it being closely related to the Tusculan School, which dissolved or went underground in mid-1794: it was edited by Charles Marsh, and Taylor contributed, along with other like-minded young radicals, such as Thomas Starling Norgate and Amelia Alderson. They had tacit support from older citizens, including Enfield and Edward Rigby. It appeared for a year from September 1794, proposing in fact a tame and moderate intellectual line. Reputation Taylor was nicknamed godless Billy for his radical views by his contemporary Harriet Martineau who said of him: :his habits of intemperance kept him out of the sight of ladies, and he got round him a set of ignorant and conceited young men, who thought they could set the whole world right by their destructive propensities.http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Life-of-George-Borrow1.html David Chandler writes in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography that Taylor was probably homosexual. Later life Taylor's friendship with Robert Southey began early in 1798, when Southey, having placed his brother Henry Herbert Southey with George Burnett at Great Yarmouth, visited Norwich as Taylor's guest; Southey revisited him at Norwich in February 1802. Much of their correspondence to 1821 is given by John Warden Robberds in his Memoir of Taylor; it is frank on both sides. In 1802, during the Peace of Amiens, Taylor embarked on another tour of Europe, visiting France, Italy and German, partly on business; Henry Southey joined him at Paris. He stayed with Lafayette at Lagrange, where he met Frances d'Arblay. In Paris he met Thomas Holcroft, Thomas Paine, and Thomas Manning. From 1811 American and other business losses made money tight. Taylor applied in 1812, at Southey's suggestion, for the post of keeper of manuscripts in the British Museum, on the resignation of Francis Douce; but the vacancy was already filled. Unmarried, Taylor lived with his parents. He had a daily routine of studying in the morning, walking in the afternoon followed by bathing in the River Wensum, from a bath house upstream from the city and its pollution. In the evening he liked to socialise, drink (heavily) and discuss linguistics, literature and philosophy in society. Works Three early poetic translations from German brought him to notice. Georg Herzfeld wrongly assigned to him the political song, The Trumpet of Liberty, first published in the Norfolk Chronicle on 16 July 1791, having been sung on 14 July at a dinner commemorating the fall of the Bastille; Edward Taylor claimed it for his father, John Taylor, of the unrelated Norwich family. William Taylor's name was made by his translation of Gottfried August B√ºrger's Lenore into English ballad metre. This was written in 1790, and bore the title Lenora; sent it to his friend Benzler from Detmold (then in Wernigerode); a previous version had been made in 1782 by Henry James Pye, but was not published till 1795, and was unknown to Taylor. The translation, circulated in manuscript, was made the foundation of a ballad (1791) by John Aikin, and was read by Anna Barbauld in 1794 at a literary gathering in the house of Dugald Stewart in Edinburgh. Stewart's brother-in- law, George Cranstoun (Lord Corehouse) gave his recollection of it to Walter Scott, who produced his own version (1796) of the poem, entitled William and Helen. The announcement of the almost simultaneous publication of Scott's version and three others had led Taylor to publish his in the Monthly Magazine in March 1796; he then published it separately as Ellenore, revised with some input from the version by William Robert Spencer. To 1790 belong also his translations of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's Nathan the Wise and Goethe's Iphigenia in Tauris. The former was first published in 1805. The Iphigenia was submitted to Benzler before September 1790, but was not printed till 1793 (for private distribution); and published 1794. In 1795 Taylor sent a copy to Goethe, through Benzler. A volume of Christoph Martin Wieland's ‚ÄòDialogues of the Gods,‚Äô 1795, contained four dialogues; five more dialogues were included in his ‚ÄòHistoric Survey‚Äô (1828‚Äì30). Taylor's career as a prolific literary critic began in April 1793 with an article in the Monthly Review on his friend Frank Sayers's Disquisitions. To this review (with a break, 1800‚Äì1809) he contributed till 1824; to the Monthly Magazine from its start till 1824; to the Annual Review from 1802 to 1807; to the Critical Review, 1803‚Äì4 and 1809; to the Athen√¶um, 1807‚Äì8, making a total of 1754 articles. He wrote also for the Cambridge Intelligencer, conducted by Benjamin Flower, from 20 July 1793 to 18 June 1803, and was concerned in two short-lived Norwich magazines, the Cabinet (October 1794‚Äì5), issued in conjunction with Sayers, and the Iris (5 February 1803 ‚Äì 29 January 1804), to which Robert Southey was a contributor. To the Foreign Quarterly (1827) he contributed one article. His friends teased him on the peculiarities of his diction, which James Mackintosh styled the Taylorian language: he coined words such as ‚Äòtransversion,‚Äô ‚Äòbody-spirit,‚Äô and ‚ÄòSternholdianism'. Some of his terms, ruled out by the editor of the Monthly Review as ‚Äònot English,‚Äô have since become accepted ‚Äîfor instance, ‚Äòrehabilitated.‚Äô He forecast steam navigation (1804); advised the formation of colonies in Africa (1805); and projected the Panama Canal (1824). Taylor suggested to Southey the publication of an annual collection of verse, on the plan of the Almanach des Muses, and contributed to both volumes of this Annual Anthology (1799‚Äì1800), using the signatures ‚ÄòRyalto‚Äô (an anagram) and ‚ÄòR. O.‚Äô To the second volume he contributed specimens of English hexameters, which he had first attempted in the Monthly Magazine, 1796. As editor of A Voyage to the Demerary (1807) by Henry Bolingbroke, he expressed himself in favour of a regulated slave trade. His family financial affairs were not prospering, and he wrote more for money. His ‚ÄòTales of Yore,‚Äô 1810, 3 vols. (anon.), was a collection of prose translations from French and German, begun in 1807. On the basis of his magazine articles he issued his ‚ÄòEnglish Synonyms Described,‚Äô 1813, a work from which his old schoolfellow George Crabb borrowed much (1824) without specific acknowledgment; it was reissued in 1850 and subsequently; a German translation appeared in 1851. In 1823 he edited the works of his friend Sayers, prefixing an elaborate biography. His major work, the ‚ÄòHistoric Survey of German Poetry,‚Äô 1828‚Äì30, 3 vols., was behind the times. It is a patchwork of previous articles and translations, with digressions. His last publication was a ‚ÄòMemoir,‚Äô 1831, of Philip Meadows Martineau, a Norwich surgeon, written in conjunction with F. Elwes. Influence William Taylor was England's first advocate of and enthusiast for German Romantic literature, and leader in its assimilation until the return of Coleridge from Germany in 1799. English writers were indebted to his enthusiastic if free translations. In 1828 the author Thomas Carlyle reminded Goethe that: :A Mr.Taylor of Norwich who is at present publishing 'Specimens of German Poetry', is a man of learning and long ago gave a version of your Iphigenie auf Tauris (Iphigenia in Tauris) Taylor is depicted as a mentor in George Borrow's semi-autobiographical novel Lavengro. Borrow described his philological teacher as: : the Anglo-German... a real character, the founder of the Anglo-German school in England, and the cleverest Englishman who ever talked or wrote encomiastic nonsense about Germany and the Germans.

The A7 meets the M6 motorway close to Carlisle, which runs south to the north west, Midlands and south of England. However, the A702 road, which runs further to the north east, and the A74 (M) south, provide a quicker alternative and serve as the main link between Edinburgh and the M6. Present route =Edinburgh= The northern terminus of the A7 is the junction at North Bridge with Princes Street in Edinburgh, also the northern terminus of the A1 and the southern terminus of the A900. The A7 is a major road through the city's south-eastern suburbs. This part of the A7 was the former route of the A68 road (the old A7 used to be what is now the A701/A772 at Gilmerton). The road passes Cameron Toll, before meeting the Edinburgh City Bypass at the major Sheriffhall Roundabout. South of the city bypass the A7 continues through Midlothian past a series of small towns and villages; Newtongrange, Gorebridge and Middleton Moor. =The Scottish Borders= Continuing from Midlothian into Scottish Borders the road bypasses the villages of Heriot and Fountainhall then through Stow to reach Galashiels . The A7 becomes a trunk road at the junction on the A6091(A68) roundabout on the southern boundary of Galashiels continuing south to Selkirk. Between Selkirk and Hawick the road has been considerably improved, allowing for overtaking. In Hawick it continues along the north bank of the River Teviot to cross the river at the Albert Bridge and follows the south bank of the river towards Langholm, Dumfries and Galloway then bypassing Canonbie. =Entering England= Continuing past the English border, the A7 goes through the small town of Longtown, before meeting the A689 and the M6 at the Greymoorhill Roundabout, which is also junction 44 of the M6, the second last junction before the motorway joins the A74(M) just before the Scottish border. Beyond Greymoorhill roundabout, the A7 becomes a brief dual carriageway, close to the Kingstown Industrial Estate on the northern fringe of Carlisle. Continuing as a busy single carriageway road, the A7 goes past several main supermarkets, and crosses the River Eden over Eden Bridge. At Hardwicke Circus Roundabout, a large junction in the centre of Carlisle, the A7 meets the A595 to the west and southern Cumbria and then continues to form part of Carlisle's one way system through the city centre, meeting the A69 and finally becoming the A6 near Carlisle railway station.

His music is little-known today, though he received high praise in his time from Gustav Mahler and Anton Bruckner. He left a symphony and Lieder, among other works. Life Rott was born in Braunhirschengrund, a suburb of Vienna. His mother Maria Rosalia (1840‚Äì1872, maiden name Lutz) was an actress and singer. His father Carl Mathias Rott (real name Roth, born 1807, married 1862) was a famous comic actor in Vienna who was crippled in 1874 by a stage accident which led to his death two years later. =Studies= Hans was left alone to continue his studies at the Conservatory. Fortunately, both his skill and financial need were recognized and he was excused from paying tuition. While studying, he briefly roomed with Gustav Mahler and . He studied piano with Leopold Landskron and Josef Dachs, harmony with Hermann Graedener, counterpoint and composition‚Äîlike Mahler‚Äîwith Franz Krenn. He studied organ with Bruckner, starting in 1874, and graduating from Bruckner's organ class in 1877, with honors. Bruckner said that Rott played Bach very well, and even improvised wonderfully (a high compliment since Bruckner himself was a great improviser). Rott was also influenced by the works of Wagner, and even attended the very first Bayreuth Festival in 1876. =Compositions= During that time Rott was also organist at the Piarist church \\"Maria Treu\\" in Vienna. For the final year of his studies in 1878, Rott submitted the first movement of his Symphony in E major to a composition contest. The jury, except Bruckner, was very derisive of the work. After completing the Symphony in 1880, Rott showed the work to both Brahms and Hans Richter, in order to get it played. His efforts failed. Brahms did not like the fact that Bruckner exerted great influence on the Conservatory students, and even told Rott that he had no talent whatsoever and that he should give up music. Unfortunately, Rott lacked Mahler's inner resolve, and whereas Mahler was able to overcome many of the obstacles in his life, Rott was brought down by mental illness. The symphony has been recorded by the BIS, CPO, Acousence, Hyperion, Ondine, RCA, Arte Nova, & Oehms record labels. Hans Rott also wrote a Symphony for String Orchestra in A flat major, in three movements, (1874‚Äì75), and a String Quartet in C minor, a student work in five movements. They have both been recorded on the Acousence Records label #ACO-CD 20205 (2005). =Final years= Rott began to evidence persecutory delusions. In October 1880, while on a train journey, he reportedly threatened another passenger with a revolver, claiming that Brahms had filled the train with dynamite. Rott was committed to a mental hospital in 1881, where despite a brief recovery he sank into depression. By the end of 1883 a diagnosis recorded \\"hallucinatory insanity, persecution mania‚Äîrecovery no longer to be expected.\\" He died of tuberculosis in 1884, aged 25. Many well-wishers, including Bruckner and Mahler, attended Rott's funeral at the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna. Legacy Mahler wrote of Rott > a musician of genius ... who died unrecognized and in want on the very > threshold of his career. ... What music has lost in him cannot be estimated. > Such is the height to which his genius soars in ... [his] Symphony [in E > major], which he wrote as 20-year-old youth and makes him ... the Founder of > the New Symphony as I see it. To be sure, what he wanted is not quite what > he achieved. ‚Ä¶ But I know where he aims. Indeed, he is so near to my inmost > self that he and I seem to me like two fruits from the same tree which the > same soil has produced and the same air nourished. He could have meant > infinitely much to me and perhaps the two of us would have well-nigh > exhausted the content of new time which was breaking out for music.Quoted in > the liner notes for the Gerhard Samuel recording of Rott's Symphony, > Hyperion Records (1989) Thanks to Rott's friends, some of his music manuscripts have survived in the music collection of Vienna's national library. This includes Rott's Symphony in E major, and sketches for a second Symphony that was never finished. The completed symphony is remarkable in the way it anticipates some of Mahler's musical characteristics. In particular, the third movement prefigures the second movement of Mahler's First Symphony. The Finale includes references to Brahms's First Symphony. Mahler also spoke well of Rott's Lieder, of which all eight surviving complete songs have been performed in concert since 2002 and four sung by Dominik W√∂rner were recorded in 2009 on the Ars label.Hans Rott - Index of Playable WorksGustav Mahler, Freunde und ZeitgenossenHans Rott‚Äôs Lieder Collection We also know of a Sextet, which Mahler never heard and has also been lost. In his last years, Rott wrote a lot of music, only to destroy what he wrote soon after writing it, saying it was worthless. Bruckner and Mahler were the first to recognise Rott's talent. Mahler himself included references to Rott's work in his own music. However, in the 20th century, Rott's work was largely forgotten; and only in 1989 was Rott's Symphony in E major finally premiered by the Cincinnati Philharmonia Orchestra under Gerhard Samuel, in a performing edition prepared by Paul Banks. A CD recording followed. Other recordings of the symphony have since been issued, and other Rott works have been occasionally revived, including his Julius Caesar Overture, Pastoral Overture and Prelude for Orchestra. He figures in the murder mystery Requiem in Vienna by J. Sydney Jones. =List of Works= * Symphony in A flat major for string orchestra (1874-75) * Menuet in D flat major for piano (1875) * Fugue in C minor for piano duet (1876) * Idyll in D major for piano (1876; incomplete) * Scherzo in A minor for piano (1876; incomplete) * String Quartet in C minor (1876) * Wanderers Nachtlied, Song for voice and piano (1876) * Das Abendgl√∂cklein, Song for voice and piano (1876) * March der Scharwache in C sharp minor for orchestra (1876; incomplete) * Orchestervorspiel in E major (1876) * Hamlet-Ouvert√ºre in A minor for orchestra (1876; incomplete) * Suite in B flat major for orchestra (1876; incomplete) * Eine Vorspiel zu 'Juius C√§sar' in B flat major for orchestra (1877) * Suite in E major for orchestra (1877) * Symphony [No.1] in E major for orchestra (1878-80) * Pastorales Vorspiel in F major for orchestra (1880) * Symphony [No.2] for orchestra (1880; sketches) * String Sextet (1880; sketches)  Recordings  * 1989: Hans Rott ‚Äì Symphonie E-Dur, Cincinnati Philharmonia Orchestra, Gerhard Samuel, Hyperion CDA 66366; reissued in that company's Helios series as CDH55140https://www.hyperion- records.co.uk/dc.asp?dc=D_CDH55140 * 1992: Hans Rott ‚Äì Symphonie E-Dur, Norrk√∂ping Symphony Orchestra, Leif Segerstam, BIS CD-563 * 1997: Hans Rott - Symfonie in E, Radio Filharmonisch Orkest, Jac van Steen, ZOC9702 * 2002: Hans Rott ‚Äì Symphonie E-Dur / Pastorales Vorspiel, Radio-Symphonieorchester Wien, Dennis Russell Davies, cpo 999 854-2 * 2002: Hans Rott ‚Äì Symphonie in E-Dur, Philharmonia Hungarica, * 2003: Hans Rott ‚Äì Symphonie E-Dur, Orchestre National de Montpellier, Friedemann Layer, AT 2001 * 2004: Hans Rott ‚Äì Symphonie Nr. 1 E-Dur / Orchestervorspiel E-Dur / Ein Vorspiel zu \\"Julius C√§sar\\", M√ºnchner Rundfunkorchester, Sebastian Weigle, ARTE NOVA Classics 82876 57748 2 * 2004: Hans Rott ‚Äì Symphonie Nr. 1 E-Dur, Philharmonisches Orchester des Staatstheaters Mainz, Catherine R√ºckwardt, acousence ACO-CD20104 * 2005: Hans Rott ‚Äì Suite in E-Dur / Gustav Mahler ‚Äì ¬ªTitan¬´, Philharmonisches Orchester Hagen, Antony Hermus, acousence ACO-CD 20305 * 2005: Hans Rott ‚Äì Symphonie f√ºr Streichorchester / Streichquartett c-Moll, Philharmonisches Orchester des Staatstheaters Mainz, Enrico Delamboye, Mainzer Streichquartett, acousence ACO-CD 20205 * 2012: Hans Rott ‚Äì Sinfonie Nr. 1 in E-Dur, Suite f√ºr Orchester in B-Dur, hr-Sinfonieorchester, Paavo J√§rvi, RCA Red Seal (Sony Music) * 2014: Hans Rott ‚Äì Balde ruhest du auch!

Its importance diminished following the construction of the M8 motorway which also covers the route between Edinburgh and Glasgow. Route and relationship to M8 =Edinburgh= The A8 begins at the West End of Edinburgh, in the New Town. The road originally also included Princes Street, but this stretch was declassified, as Princes Street is no longer open to all traffic. The road continues westwards through into the suburbs of the city past affluent areas of Murrayfield and Corstorphine, often with an accompanying bus lane. Only once the road reaches the A720 City Bypass does it become a primary route, leading out past the Royal Highland Showground at Ingliston, and Edinburgh Airport. At Newbridge, the A8 meets the start of the M8 and M9 motorways. From here the A8 is interrupted; it has been renumbered A89 until Bathgate, A7066 to Whitburn and then B7066 Harthill, until it resumes at Newhouse. =Glasgow= From Newhouse it runs parallel to the M8. Until recently there was no road of motorway standard between Newhouse and Baillieston in the eastern suburbs of Glasgow, and the A8 still carried all through traffic here, having been progressively upgraded to meet demand. However it was finally replaced in 2017 by the last section of the M8. It is now the principal non-motorway access between the Eurocentral business park and the settlements of Chapelhall and Calderbank, south of Airdrie. Just prior to Junction 8 of the M8 it diverges from the motorway, and meets the A89 at Bargeddie while co-existing as the interchange for the M8 and M73. At a roundabout near Swinton it briefly merges with the A89 and heads towards central Glasgow. The A8 now passes through suburban Garrowhill, Barlanark, Wellhouse, Springboig, Cranhill, Carntyne as Edinburgh Road - much of which is a two/three-lane dual-carriageway, but an urban restriction is still applied - and Haghill and Dennistoun as Alexandra Parade into the city centre at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and Glasgow Cathedral, where it follows the High Street and then the Saltmarket running north‚Äìsouth - meeting the A89 (Gallowgate) and the A749 (London Road) at Glasgow Cross. It splits for the complex one-way system, recombining before crossing the Clyde near The Gorbals, where it meets the end of the A74. From there the A8 leads out of town through Tradeston, Kingston (passing under the M8's Kingston Bridge) Kinning Park, Cessnock and Ibrox as Paisley Road West, changing to Edmiston Drive past Ibrox Stadium, then through Drumoyne and Shieldhall as Shieldhall Road, Braehead as Renfrew Road and the town centre of Renfrew as Glasgow Road, Glebe Street and Inchinnan Road, passing to the rear of Glasgow Airport at Inchinnan, crossing over the M8 east of Bishopton and meeting it again at the motorway's western end, Junction 31 between Bishopton and Langbank. The A8 becomes the primary route again and takes traffic through Port Glasgow. Its terminus is in Greenock at a large roundabout with the A78 road and the A770 to Gourock, which was the former terminus of the A8. Euroroute designations Three short stretches of the A8 are part of three different Euroroutes, as follows: * The stretch from the western end of the M8 into Greenock is part of the E05. * Between M8 Junctions 6 and 7 is part of the E16. * A very short stretch linking the A720 and A902 is part of the E15.

At 273 miles (439 km), it is the longest road in Scotland and the fifth-longest A-road in the United Kingdom. Historically it was the main road between Edinburgh and John o' Groats, and has been called the spine of Scotland. The road's origins lie in the military roads building programme of the 18th century, further supplemented by the building of several bridges in later years. The A9 route was formally designated in 1923, and originally ran from Edinburgh to Inverness. The route was soon extended north from Inverness up to John O'Groats. By the 1970s the route was hampered by severe traffic congestion, and an extensive upgrading programme was undertaken on the 138 mile section between Bridge of Allan and Inverness. This involved the bypassing of numerous towns and villages on the route, and the building of several new bridges, notably the Kessock Bridge which shortened the route north out of Inverness by 14 miles. In the south the road's importance has been eclipsed by: # the A90 across the Forth Road Bridge and the M90 motorway, which now link Edinburgh more directly with Perth, bypassing Stirling and Bridge of Allan as formerly important bridge points, and # the M9, which is now the main road between Edinburgh and Bridge of Allan. Between Edinburgh and Falkirk the old A9 route has been reclassified into the A803 and the B9080 amongst others; part of the route between Kirkliston and Maybury no longer exists as the area is now part of Edinburgh Airport. Between Falkirk and Bridge of Allan, the A9 survives as a more or less parallel road to the M9. The link between the M9 and the A9, by Bridge of Allan, is the Keir Roundabout. History General Wade's old military roads, south of Inverness. The A9's origins lie in the military roads building programme carried out by General Wade in the 18th century to allow deployment of forces in key locations within the Highlands. At this time there was already an existing road between Perth and Dunkeld, and between 1727 and 1730 a roadway was constructed between Dunkeld in Perthshire and Inverness. However, Wade had still to bridge the River Tay at Aberfeldy. Construction began in 1733 to a design by William Adam. The bridge was completed within the year, but Wade wrote \\"The Bridge of Tay... was a work of great difficulty and also much more expensive than was calculated.\\" At a cost of over ¬£4,000, the bridge became the most expensive item on Wade's road building programme. For most of its length between Perth and Inverness, the route was identical to the A9 prior to the commencement of the major upgrading works in the 1970s. Thomas Telford's bridge crossing the River Tay at DunkeldThe Kessock Bridge, completed in 1982, which crosses the Moray Firth and shortened the route north out of Inverness by 14 milesaverage speed cameras which became operational on the A9 in late 2014 In 1802, Thomas Telford was requested by the Lords of the Treasury to carry out a survey of the interior of the Scottish Highlands. In his report, he highlighted the inadequacy of the old military roads to meet the requirements of the general population. In particular, he noted the difficulties caused by the absence of bridges over some of the principal rivers. As part of the improvements to the road system that were carried out in the following years, a bridge was built at Dunkeld, designed by Telford. The original cost estimate was ¬£15,000 with costs to be split between the government and the landowner, the 4th Duke of Atholl. However, costs spiralled up to around ¬£40,000. The government refused to increase their financial contribution, so the Duke of Atholl had to finance the extra cost. As a result, tolls were placed on the completed bridge to recoup costs. The realigned road north out of Dunkeld would evolve eventually into the A9, and the bridge carried the bulk of the traffic into the Highlands until the new A9 by-pass was opened in 1977. The old A9 (now B8079) as it crosses the Allt Girnaig river at Killiecrankie The formal scheme of classification of roads in Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) was first published on 1 April 1923. The original route of the designated A9 began in Edinburgh at the Corstorphine junction in the west of the city, branching north off the A8. The route went through Kirkliston and onwards to Polmont and Falkirk. The road then followed the now familiar route to Stirling and then up to Perth and onwards to Inverness, going through numerous villages en route. The original A9 terminated at Inverness, but in the years that followed it was extended to include the roadway all the way up to John O'Groats. By the 1970s, the A9 went north-west out of Inverness in what had originally been classified as the A88, following the Beauly Firth coast westwards through Kirkhill, Beauly and Muir of Ord. Continuing north through Dingwall, the road then began to follow the Cromarty Firth coast, where it followed largely the modern alignment, going through Alness and Tain (both now bypassed). The A9 from here followed west along the south side of the Dornoch Firth coast before reaching Bonar Bridge where the road turned sharply eastwards on the north side of the Dornoch Firth. On reaching the village of Dornoch, the A9 headed north along the coast, going through several villages before reaching the town of Wick. The final stretch continued north along the coast before it finally reached John O'Groats. Upgrades The 138 mile (222 km) section between Bridge of Allan and Inverness, via Perth, was substantially rebuilt during the 1970s and 80s, but it follows essentially the same route except where it bypasses towns and villages instead of running through their centres. Between Perth and Inverness, the road has been dubbed Killer A9, because of accidents and fatalities where dual-carriageway sections merge into single-carriageway - the principal cause being motorists driving at excessive speeds to overtake lines of slower-moving vehicles before the dual carriageway ends. Dangerous overtaking manoeuvres on the long single-carriageway stretches of the road are also common causes of accidents, as are the non-grade separated junctions along the northern sections, where drivers make a right turn across the opposing traffic flow. One of the sections of dual carriageway built in the late 1970s/ early 1980s; this is the section in the north of Perthshire between Dalnacardoch and DalnaspidalThe most significant alteration of the A9 route was the realignment of the route north from Inverness, crossing the Moray Firth via the Kessock Bridge, cutting through the Black Isle and back across the Cromarty Firth. This shortened the route by 14 miles, bypassing Beauly, Muir of Ord and Dingwall. Construction of the Kessock Bridge began in 1976 and it was completed in 1982. Since 2007, the Scottish Government has given serious consideration to converting the entire Perth-Inverness section to dual carriageway with more grade separated junctions, with the initial estimated cost at ¬£600 million. In late 2008 the Scottish Government's transport plan for the next 20 years was announced. It brought forward planned improvements to the A9 in an attempt to stimulate the economy and protect jobs. Work costing a total of ¬£8.5 million was undertaken at Moy, Carrbridge and Bankfoot. Northbound overtaking lanes were created and the carriageway was reconstructed at both Moy and Carrbridge. Junction improvements were also made at Moy and at the Ballinluig junction, south of Pitlochry. In November 2011 the Scottish Government announced that it would upgrade the entire road from Perth to Inverness to dual carriageway. The design contract was split into three lots with Lot 1 (Glengarry to Dalraddy) awarded to a CH2MHill/Fairhurst joint venture in April 2014. Lot 2 (Pass of Birnam to Glengarry) was awarded to Jacobs in August 2014 and Lot 3 was awarded to an Atkins/Mouchel joint venture in December 2014. Award of the construction contract for a preliminary section (outwith Lots 1 to 3) of the ¬£3 billion project was awarded in June 2015, and work began on the five mile section between Kincraig and Dalraddy (just south of Aviemore) in September 2015. After a slight delay this section was opened to traffic on 30 September 2017. The full scheme is scheduled to be completed in 2025. In July 2013, the Scottish Government announced a plan to install average speed cameras on the A9 between Perth and Inverness. This has been undertaken with an aim to reduce accidents and fatalities on the road, and will be the second permanent average speed camera scheme in Scotland. Simultaneously, an increased speed limit for heavy goods vehicles from 40mph to 50mph was introduced to help mitigate driver frustration. The A9 ASCS proposal has met with opposition, with a Facebook campaign opposed to the introduction of average speed cameras attracting close to 10,000 supporters. Despite objections, the cameras became operational in October 2014. The A9 Safety Group claim that the cameras have had a \\"positive influence\\" on road users, although there has been a slight increase in journey times. Improvements to safety include at least 40% reduction in fatalities, and this has been attributed, at least in part, to a reduction in speeding, from 1 in 3 vehicles to just 1 in 15. Route Highland Main Line and A9 highway next to each other in Perthshire, September 2000 The original starting section of the A9 between Edinburgh and Polmont no longer exists as such, having been reclassified over the years in a variety of ways; indeed part of the original route between Kirkliston and Maybury no longer exists at all as the area is now part of Edinburgh Airport. The modern A9 begins at the M9 junction 5 (Cadgers Brae) on the outskirts of Polmont, just east of Falkirk, and continues through Falkirk itself and on though Larbert, Stirling and Bridge of Allan. It then becomes a primary route dual carriageway at the Keir Roundabout, just south of Dunblane, and continues north as a dual carriageway to Perth bypassing Dunblane, Blackford and Auchterarder. At Broxden Junction on the outskirts of Perth, the A9 meets the M90 motorway which carries traffic from Fife and the Forth Road Bridge. Broxden Junction is one of the busiest and most important road junctions in Scotland, with links to all seven Scottish cities. The section between Perth and Inverness is often cited as being the most dangerous section of the road, and regularly appears in lists of Scotland's most dangerous roads. This portion of the road is mostly single- carriageway, however there are intermittent short sections of dual carriageway from Perth to Luncarty, Bankfoot to Birnam, Pitlochry to Killiecrankie, south of Drumochter Summit, Slochd Summit to Tomatin and south of Inverness as well as shorter three lane overtaking sections to reduce frustration and accidents. All the towns on this section of the route have now been bypassed. The section from Keir Roundabout to Inverness had average speed cameras installed in 2014 and at the same time the single carriageway speed limit for HGVs was increased from 40 mph to 50 mph. In the north, beyond Inverness, the A9 designation has been transferred in response to construction of new bridges across the Moray Firth (the Kessock Bridge), the Cromarty Firth and the Dornoch Firth; and so that the A9 leads not to John o' Groats but to Scrabster Harbour, Thurso, where a government-supported ferry service takes traffic to and from Stromness in Orkney. Therefore, various towns and villages which were on the A9 are now seriously distanced from this trunk road.Towns and villages which were on the A9 but now quite remote from it: * Beauly: now on the A862. * Ardgay and Bonar Bridge: now on the A836. Bonar Bridge is also on the A949. * Wick and John o' Groats: now on the A99. Between Perth and Inverness, the A9 forms part of Euroroute E15. Inverness is the northern terminus of this route. = Falkirk to Bridge of Allan = From Falkirk to Bridge of Allan the A9 runs through or near Bannockburn, Plean, Torwood, Larbert and Stirling. = Bridge of Allan to Inverness = From Bridge of Allan to Inverness the A9 runs through or near Lecropt, Dunblane, Blackford, Auchterarder, Gleneagles, Broxden Junction, Perth, Birnam, Dunkeld, Pitlochry, Blair Atholl, the Grampian Mountains, Dalwhinnie, Newtonmore, Kingussie, Aviemore, Carrbridge, Tomatin and Moy. =Inverness to Thurso= Places From Inverness the A9 runs across, through or near the Moray Firth, the Black Isle, Tore, Muir of Ord, Conon Bridge, the Cromarty Firth, Easter Ross, Dingwall, Evanton, Alness, Invergordon, Nigg Bay, Fearn, Tain, the Dornoch Firth, Sutherland, Dornoch, The Mound, Golspie, Dunrobin Castle, Brora, Helmsdale, Caithness, Berriedale (and the Berriedale Braes), Badbea, Dunbeath, Latheron, Mybster, Georgemas and Thurso.

She is popularly known as \\"The Little Flower of Jesus\\", or simply \\"The Little Flower.‚Äù Th√©r√®se has been a highly influential model of sanctity for Catholics and for others because of the simplicity and practicality of her approach to the spiritual life. Together with Francis of Assisi, she is one of the most popular saints in the history of the church. Pope Pius X called her \\"the greatest saint of modern times\\". Th√©r√®se felt an early call to religious life, and overcoming various obstacles, in 1888 at the early age of 15,The Life of Saint Th√©r√®se of Lisieux she became a nun and joined two of her older sisters in the cloistered Carmelite community of Lisieux, Normandy (yet another sister, C√©line, also later joined the order). After nine years as a Carmelite religious, having fulfilled various offices such as sacristan and assistant to the novice mistress, and having spent her last eighteen months in Carmel in a night of faith (a time when she is said to have felt Jesus was absent and when she even felt tormented by doubts about the existence of God), Th√©r√®se died at the age of 24, from tuberculosis. Her feast day in the General Roman Calendar was 3 October from 1927 until it was moved in 1969 to 1 October.Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), pp. 104, 141. Th√©r√®se is well known throughout the world, with the Basilica of Lisieux being the second most popular place of pilgrimage in France after Lourdes. Life =Family background= Z√©lie Martin, mother of Th√©r√®se Therese was born on Rue Saint-Blaise, in Alen√ßon, France on January 2, 1873, and was the daughter of Marie-Az√©lie Gu√©rin (usually called Z√©lie), and Louis Martin who was a jeweler and watchmaker. Both her parents were devout Catholics who would eventually become the first (and to date only) married couple canonized together by the Roman Catholic Church (by Pope Francis in 2015). Louis had tried to become a canon regular, wanting to enter the Great St Bernard Hospice, but had been refused because he knew no Latin. Z√©lie, possessed of a strong, active temperament, wished to serve the sick, and had also considered entering consecrated life, but the prioress of the canonesses regular of the H√¥tel-Dieu in Alen√ßon had discouraged her outright. Disappointed, Z√©lie learned lacemaking instead. She excelled in it and set up her own business on Rue Saint-Blaise at age 22. Louis and Z√©lie met in early 1858 and married on July 13 of that same year at the Basilica of Notre-Dame d'Alen√ßon. At first they decided to live as brother and sister in a perpetual continence, but when a confessor discouraged them in this, they changed their lifestyle and had nine children. From 1867 to 1870, they lost 3 infants and five-year-old H√©l√®ne. All five of their surviving daughters became nuns. In addition to Th√©r√®se, they were * Marie (February 22, 1860, a Carmelite in Lisieux, in religion Sister Marie of the Sacred Heart, d. January 19, 1940), * Pauline (September 7, 1861, a Carmelite in Lisieux, in religion Mother Agnes of Jesus, d. July 28, 1951), * L√©onie (June 3, 1863, a Visitandine at Caen, in religion Sister Fran√ßoise-Th√©r√®se, d. June 16, 1941), and * C√©line (April 28, 1869, a Carmelite in Lisieux, in religion Sister Genevi√®ve of the Holy Face, d. February 25, 1959). \\"A dreamer and brooder, an idealist and romantic, [the father] gave touching and na√Øve pet names [to his daughters]: Marie was his diamond, Pauline his noble pearl, C√©line the bold one. But Th√©r√®se was his petite reine, little queen, to whom all treasures belonged.\\" Z√©lie was so successful in manufacturing lace that by 1870 Louis had sold his watchmaking shop to a nephew and handled the traveling and bookkeeping end of his wife's lacemaking business. =Birth and infancy= Louis Martin, father of Th√©r√®se Soon after her birth in January 1873, the outlook for the survival of Th√©r√®se Martin was uncertain. Because of her frail condition, she was entrusted to a wet nurse, Rose Taill√©, who had already nursed two of the Martin children.\\"Therese ‚Äì Life Story\\", Society of the Little Flower Rose had her own children and could not live with the Martins, so Th√©r√®se was sent to live with her in the forests of the Bocage the Semall√©. On 2 April 1874, when she was 15 months old, she returned to Alen√ßon where her family surrounded her with affection. \\"I hear the baby calling me Mama! as she goes down the stairs. On every step, she calls out Mama! and if I don't respond every time, she remains there without going either forward or back.\\" (Madame Martin to Pauline, 21 November 1875) She was educated in a very Catholic environment, including Mass attendance at 5:30 a.m., the strict observance of fasts, and prayer to the rhythm of the liturgical year. The Martins also practiced charity, visiting the sick and elderly and welcoming the occasional vagabond to their table. Even if she was not the model little girl, her sisters later portrayed, Th√©r√®se was very responsive to this education. She played at being a nun. Described as generally a happy child, she also manifested other emotions, and often cried: \\"C√©line is playing with the little one with some bricks... I have to correct poor baby who gets into frightful tantrums when she can't have her own way. She rolls in the floor in despair believing all is lost. Sometimes she is so overcome she almost chokes. She's a nervous child, but she is very good, very intelligent, and remembers everything.\\" At 22, Th√©r√®se, then a Carmelite, admitted: \\"I was far from being a perfect little girl\\". Rue Saint- Blaise's house at Alen√ßon: The family home and Th√©r√®se's birthplace From 1865 Z√©lie had complained of breast pain and in December 1876 a doctor told her of the seriousness of the tumour. Feeling death was imminent, Madame Martin had written to Pauline in spring 1877, \\"You and Marie will have no difficulties with her upbringing. Her disposition is so good. She is a chosen spirit.\\" In June 1877 she left for Lourdes hoping to be cured, but the miracle did not happen: \\"The Mother of God has not healed me because my time is up, and because God wills me to repose elsewhere than on the earth.\\" On 28 August 1877, Z√©lie died, aged 45. Her funeral was conducted in the Basilica of Notre- Dame d'Alen√ßon. Th√©r√®se was barely 4¬Ω years old. Her mother's death dealt her a severe blow and later she would consider that \\"the first part of her life stopped that day\\". The basilica of Alen√ßon, where Saint Th√©r√®se was baptized She wrote: \\"Every detail of my mother's illness is still with me, specially her last weeks on earth.\\" She remembered the bedroom scene where her dying mother received the last sacraments while Th√©r√®se knelt and her father cried. She wrote: \\"When Mummy died, my happy disposition changed. I had been so lively and open; now I became diffident and oversensitive, crying if anyone looked at me. I was only happy if no one took notice of me... It was only in the intimacy of my own family, where everyone was wonderfully kind, that I could be more myself.\\"O'Malley, Vincent J., Ordinary Suffering of Extraordinary Saints (1999); , p. 38. Th√©r√®se (1876) Three months after Z√©lie died, Louis Martin left Alen√ßon, where he had spent his youth and marriage, and moved to Lisieux in the Calvados Department of Normandy, where Z√©lie's pharmacist brother, Isidore Gu√©rin lived with his wife and their two daughters, Jeanne and Marie. In her last months Z√©lie had given up the lace business. After her death, Louis sold it. Louis leased a pretty, spacious country house, Les Buissonnets, situated in a large garden on the slope of a hill overlooking the town. Looking back, Th√©r√®se would see the move to Les Buissonnets as the beginning of the \\"second period of my life, the most painful of the three: it extends from the age of four-and-a-half to fourteen, the time when I rediscovered my childhood character, and entered into the serious side of life\\". In Lisieux, Pauline took on the role of Th√©r√®se's Mama. She took this role seriously, and Th√©r√®se grew especially close to her, and to C√©line, the sister closest to her in age. =Early years= Les Buissonnets, The Martin family house in Lisieux to which they moved in November 1877 following the death of Madame Martin. Th√©r√®se lived here from 16 November 1877 to 9 April 1888, the day she entered Carmel. Th√©r√®se was taught at home until she was eight and a half, and then entered the school kept by the Benedictine nuns of the Abbey of Notre Dame du Pre in Lisieux. Th√©r√®se, taught well and carefully by Marie and Pauline, found herself at the top of the class, except for writing and arithmetic. However, because of her young age and high grades, she was bullied. The one who bullied her the most was a girl of fourteen who did poorly at school. Th√©r√®se suffered very much as a result of her sensitivity, and she cried in silence. Furthermore, the boisterous games at recreation were not to her taste. She preferred to tell stories or look after the little ones in the infants class. \\"The five years I spent at school were the saddest of my life, and if my dear C√©line had not been with me I could not have stayed there for a single month without falling ill.\\" C√©line informs us, \\"She now developed a fondness for hiding,Summarium 1, 1914. she did not want to be observed, for she sincerely considered herself inferior\\". On her free days she became more and more attached to Marie Gu√©rin, the younger of her two cousins in Lisieux. The two girls would play at being anchorites, as the great Teresa had once played with her brother. And every evening she plunged into the family circle. \\"Fortunately I could go home every evening and then I cheered up. I used to jump on Father's knee and tell him what marks I had, and when he kissed me all my troubles were forgotten...I needed this sort of encouragement so much.\\" Yet the tension of the double life and the daily self- conquest placed a strain on Th√©r√®se. Going to school became more and more difficult. Th√©r√®se aged 8, 1881 When she was nine years old, in October 1882, her sister Pauline, who had acted as a \\"second mother\\" to her, entered the Carmelite convent at Lisieux. Th√©r√®se was devastated. She understood that Pauline was cloistered and that she would never come back. \\"I said in the depths of my heart: Pauline is lost to me!\\" The shock reawakened in her the trauma caused by her mother's death. She also wanted to join the Carmelites, but was told she was too young. Yet Th√©r√®se so impressed Mother Marie Gonzague, the prioress at the time of Pauline's entry to the community that she wrote to comfort her, calling Th√©r√®se \\"my future little daughter\\". =Illness= At this time, Th√©r√®se was often sick. She began to suffer from nervous tremors. The tremors started one night after her uncle took her for a walk and began to talk about Z√©lie. Assuming that she was cold, the family covered Therese with blankets, but the tremors continued. She clenched her teeth and could not speak. The family called Dr. Notta, who could make no diagnosis. In 1882, Dr. Gayral diagnosed that Th√©r√®se \\"reacts to an emotional frustration with a neurotic attack\\". Alarmed, but cloistered, Pauline began to write letters to Th√©r√®se and attempted various strategies to intervene. Eventually Th√©r√®se recovered after she had turned to gaze at the statue of the Virgin Mary placed in Marie's room, where Th√©r√®se had been moved. She reported on 13 May 1883 that she had seen the Virgin smile at her., Th√©r√®se of Lisieux: The Way to Love, p. 15. She wrote: \\"Our Blessed Lady has come to me, she has smiled upon me. How happy I am.\\", The Story of a Soul, p. 32. However, when Th√©r√®se told the Carmelite nuns about this vision at the request of her eldest sister Marie, she found herself assailed by their questions and she lost confidence. Self-doubt made her begin to question what had happened. \\"I thought I had lied ‚Äì I was unable to look upon myself without a feeling of profound horror.\\"Manuscript A, chapter 3, Story of a Soul. \\"For a long time after my cure, I thought that my sickness was deliberate and this was a real martyrdom for my soul\\". Her concerns over this continued until November 1887. In October 1886, her oldest sister, Marie, entered the same Carmelite monastery, adding to Th√©r√®se's grief. The warm atmosphere at Les Buissonnets, so necessary to her, was disappearing. Now only she and C√©line remained with their father. Her frequent tears made some friends think she had a weak character and the Gu√©rins indeed shared this opinion. Th√©r√®se also suffered from scruples, a condition experienced by other saints such as Alphonsus Liguori, also a Doctor of the Church, and Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits. She wrote: \\"One would have to pass through this martyrdom to understand it well, and for me to express what I experienced for a year and a half would be impossible\\"., Th√©r√®se of Lisieux, p. 45. =Complete conversion= Th√©r√®se in 1886, age 13 Christmas Eve of 1886 was a turning point in the life of Th√©r√®se; she called it her \\"complete conversion.\\" Years later she stated that on that night she overcame the pressures she had faced since the death of her mother and said that \\"God worked a little miracle to make me grow up in an instant ... On that blessed night ‚Ä¶ Jesus, who saw fit to make Himself a child out of love for me, saw fit to have me come forth from the swaddling clothes and imperfections of childhood\\". That night, Louis Martin and his daughters, L√©onie, C√©line and Th√©r√®se, attended Midnight Mass at the cathedral in Lisieux‚Äî \\"but there was very little heart left in them. On 1 December, L√©onie, covered in eczema and hiding her hair under a short mantilla, had returned to Les Buissonnets after just seven weeks of the Poor Clares regime in Alen√ßon\\", and her sisters were helping her get over her sense of failure and humiliation. Back at Les Buissonnets as every year, Th√©r√®se \\"as was the custom for French children, had left her shoes on the hearth, empty in anticipation of gifts, not from Father Christmas but from the Child Jesus, who was imagined to travel through the air bearing toys and cakes.\\" 1651261 While she and C√©line were going up the stairs she heard her father, \\"perhaps exhausted by the hour, or this reminder of the relentless emotional demands of his weepy youngest daughter\\", say with some irritation \\"Therese is far too old for this now. Fortunately this will be the last year!\\" Th√©r√®se had begun to cry and C√©line advised her not to go back downstairs immediately. Then, suddenly, Th√©r√®se pulled herself together and wiped her tears. She ran down the stairs, knelt by the fireplace and unwrapped her surprises as jubilantly as ever. In her account, nine years later, of 1895 : \\"In an instant Jesus, content with my good will, accomplished the work I had not been able to do in ten years.\\" After nine sad years she had \\"recovered the strength of soul she had lost\\" when her mother died and, she said, \\"she was to retain it forever\\". She discovered the joy in self-forgetfulness and added, \\"I felt, in a word, charity enter my heart, the need to forget myself to make others happy‚ÄîSince this blessed night I was not defeated in any battle, but instead I went from victory to victory and began, so to speak, \\"to run a giant's course\\".Psalms According to Ida G√∂rres, \\"Th√©r√®se instantly understood what had happened to her when she won this banal little victory over her sensitivity, which she had borne for so long; ...freedom is found in resolutely looking away from oneself.. and the fact that a person can cast himself away from himself reveals again that being good, victory is pure grace, a sudden gift..It cannot be coerced, and yet it can be received only by the patiently prepared heart\\". Biographer Kathryn Harrison: \\"After all, in the past she had tried to control herself, had tried with all her being and had failed. Grace, alchemy, masochism: through whatever lens we view her transport, Th√©r√®se's night of illumination presented both its power and its danger. It would guide her steps between the mortal and the divine, between living and dying, destruction and apotheosis. It would take her exactly where she intended to go\\". Th√©r√®se's character and the early experiences that shaped her have been the subject of analysis, particularly in recent years. Apart from the family doctor who observed her in the 19th century, all other conclusions are inevitably speculative. For instance, author Ida G√∂rres, whose formal studies had focused on church history and hagiography, wrote a psychological analysis of the Th√©r√®se's character. Some authors suggest that Th√©r√®se had a strongly neurotic aspect to her personality for most of her life.Armstrong, Karen (1986) The Gospel according to woman: Christianity's creation of the sex war in the West, p. 234, London, Fount, Furlong, Monica (1987), Th√©r√®se of Lisieux, p. 9, London, Orbis Books, 2001.Six, Jean Fran√ßois (1976), La verdadera infancia de Teresa de Lisieux: neurosis y santidad, passim, Mardrid, Studium. Harrison concluded that, \\"her temperament was not formed for compromise or moderation...a life spent not taming but directing her appetite and her will, a life perhaps shortened by the force of her desire and ambition.\\" =Rome and entry to Carmel= 15th-century manuscript of The Imitation of Christ, Royal Library of Belgium 1887 Police Mugshot of Henri Pranzini Before she was fourteen, when she started to experience a period of calm, Th√©r√®se started to read The Imitation of Christ. She read the Imitation intently, as if the author traced each sentence for her: \\"The Kingdom of God is within you... Turn thee with thy whole heart unto the Lord; and forsake this wretched world: and thy soul shall find rest.\\" She kept the book with her constantly and wrote later that this book and parts of another book of a very different character, lectures by Abb√© Arminjon on The End of This World, and the Mysteries of the World to Come, nourished her during this critical period. Thereafter she began to read other books, mostly on history and science. In May 1887, Th√©r√®se approached her 63-year-old father Louis, who was recovering from a small stroke, while he sat in the garden one Sunday afternoon and told him that she wanted to celebrate the anniversary of \\"her conversion\\" by entering Carmel before Christmas. Louis and Th√©r√®se both broke down and cried, but Louis got up, gently picked a little white flower, root intact, and gave it to her, explaining the care with which God brought it into being and preserved it until that day. Th√©r√®se later wrote: \\"while I listened I believed I was hearing my own story\\". To Therese, the flower seemed a symbol of herself, \\"destined to live in another soil\\". Th√©r√®se renewed her attempts to join the Carmel, but the priest-superior of the monastery would not allow it on account of her youth. chignon on the top of her head\\". During the summer, French newspapers were filled with the story of Henri Pranzini, convicted of the brutal murder of two women and a child. To the outraged public Pranzini represented all that threatened the decent way of life in France. In July and August 1887 Th√©r√®se prayed hard for the conversion of Pranzini, so his soul could be saved, yet Pranzini showed no remorse. At the end of August, the newspapers reported that just as Pranzini's neck was placed on the guillotine, he had grabbed a crucifix and kissed it three times. Th√©r√®se was ecstatic and believed that her prayers had saved him. She continued to pray for Pranzini after his death. Leo XIII ‚Äì In November 1887 when Th√©r√®se met him, he was an old man of seventy-seven. In November 1887, Louis took C√©line and Th√©r√®se on a diocesan pilgrimage to Rome for the priestly jubilee of Pope Leo XIII. On 20 November 1887, during a general audience with Leo XIII, Th√©r√®se, in her turn, approached the Pope, knelt, and asked him to allow her to enter Carmel at 15. The Pope said: \\"Well, my child, do what the superiors decide.... You will enter if it is God's Will\\" and he blessed Th√©r√®se. She refused to leave his feet, and the Noble Guard had to carry her out of the room.Jestice, Phyllis G. (2004), Holy people of the world, ABC-CLIO; . The trip continued: they visited Pompeii, Naples, Assisi before going back via Pisa and Genoa. The pilgrimage of nearly a month was timely. During it she \\"learnt more than in many years of study\\". For the first and last time in her life, she left her native Normandy. Notably she \\"who only knew priests in the exercise of their ministry was in their company, heard their conversations, not always edifying‚Äîand saw their shortcomings for herself\\". She had understood that she had to pray and give her life for sinners like Pranzini. But Carmel prayed especially for priests and this had surprised her since their souls seemed to her to be \\"as pure as crystal\\". A month spent with many priests taught her that they are \\"weak and feeble men\\". She wrote later: \\"I met many saintly priests that month, but I also found that in spite of being above angels by their supreme dignity, they were none the less men and still subject to human weakness. If the holy priests, 'the salt of the earth', as Jesus calls them in the Gospel, have to be prayed for, what about the lukewarm? Again, as Jesus says, 'If the salt shall lose its savour, wherewith shall it be salted?' I understood my vocation in Italy.\\" For the first time too she had associated with young men. \\"In her brotherless existence, masculinity had been represented only by her father, her Uncle Gu√©rin and various priests. Now she had her first and only experiences. C√©line declared at the beatification proceedings that one of the young men in the pilgrimage group \\"developed a tender affection for her\\". Th√©r√®se confessed to her sister, \\"It is high time for Jesus to remove me from the poisonous breath of the world...I feel that my heart is easily caught by tenderness, and where others fall, I would fall too. We are no stronger than the others\\". Soon after that, the Bishop of Bayeux authorized the prioress to receive Th√©r√®se. On 9 April 1888 she became a Carmelite postulant. = Lisieux Carmel = The Lisieux convent The convent Th√©r√®se entered was an old- established house with a long tradition. In 1838 two nuns from the Poitiers Carmel had been sent out to found the house of Lisieux. One of them, Mother Genevi√®ve of St Teresa, was still living when Th√©r√®se entered... the second wing, containing the cells and sickrooms in which she was to live and die, had been standing only ten years... \\"What she found was a community of very aged nuns, some odd and cranky, some sick and troubled, some lukewarm and complacent. Almost all of the sisters came from the petty bourgeois and artisan class. The Prioress and Novice Mistress were of old Normandy nobility. Probably the Martin sisters alone represented the new class of the rising bourgeoisie\\". The Carmelite order had been reformed in the sixteenth century by Teresa of √Åvila, essentially devoted to personal and collective prayer. The nuns of Lisieux followed a strict regimen that allowed for only one meal a day for seven months of the year, and little free time. Only one room of the building was heated. The times of silence and of solitude were many but the foundress had also planned for time for work and relaxation in common‚Äîthe austerity of the life should not hinder sisterly and joyful relations. Founded in 1838, the Carmel of Lisieux in 1888 had 26 religious, from very different classes and backgrounds. For the majority of the life of Th√©r√®se, the prioress would be Mother Marie de Gonzague, born Marie-Ad√©le-Rosalie Davy de Virville. When Th√©r√®se entered the convent Mother Marie was 54, a woman of changeable humour, jealous of her authority, used sometimes in a capricious manner; this had for effect, a certain laxity in the observance of established rules. \\"In the sixties and seventies of the [nineteenth] century an aristocrat in the flesh counted for far more in a petty bourgeois convent than we can realize nowadays... the superiors appointed Marie de Gonzague to the highest offices as soon as her noviciate was finished... in 1874 began the long series of terms as Prioress\\". =Postulancy= Th√©r√®se's time as a postulant began with her welcome into the Carmel, Monday, 9 April 1888. She felt peace after she received communion that day and later wrote, \\"At last my desires were realized, and I cannot describe the deep sweet peace which filled my soul. This peace has remained with me during the eight and a half years of my life here, and has never left me even amid the greatest trials\\". From her childhood, Th√©r√®se had dreamed of the desert to which God would some day lead her. Now she had entered that desert. Though she was now reunited with Marie and Pauline, from the first day she began her struggle to win and keep her distance from her sisters. Right at the start Marie de Gonzague, the prioress, had turned the postulant Th√©r√®se over to her eldest sister Marie, who was to teach her to follow the Divine Office. Later she appointed Th√©r√®se assistant to Pauline in the refectory. And when her cousin Marie Guerin also entered, she employed the two together in the sacristy. Th√©r√®se adhered strictly to the rule which forbade all superfluous talk during work. She saw her sisters together only in the hours of common recreation after meals. At such times she would sit down beside whomever she happened to be near, or beside a nun whom she had observed to be downcast, disregarding the tacit and sometimes expressed sensitivity and even jealousy of her biological sisters. \\"We must apologize to the others for our being four under one roof\\", she was in the habit of remarking. \\"When I am dead, you must be very careful not to lead a family life with one another...I did not come to Carmel to be with my sisters; on the contrary, I saw clearly that their presence would cost me dear, for I was determined not to give way to nature.\\" Although the novice mistress, Sister Marie of the Angels, found Th√©r√®se slow, the young postulant adapted well to her new environment. She wrote, \\"Illusions, the Good Lord gave me the grace to have none on entering Carmel. I found religious life as I had figured, no sacrifice astonished me.\\" She chose a spiritual director, a Jesuit, Father Pichon. At their first meeting, 28 May 1888, she made a general confession going back over all her past sins. She came away from it profoundly relieved. The priest who had himself suffered from scruples, understood her and reassured her. A few months later, he left for Canada, and Th√©r√®se would only be able to ask his advice by letter and his replies were rare. (On 4 July 1897, she confided to Pauline, 'Father Pichon treated me too much like a child; nonetheless he did me a lot of good too by saying that I never committed a mortal sin.') During her time as a postulant, Th√©r√®se had to endure some bullying from other sisters because of her lack of aptitude for handicrafts and manual work. Sister St Vincent de Paul, the finest embroiderer in the community made her feel awkward and even called her 'the big nanny goat'. Th√©r√®se was in fact the tallest in the family, 1.62 metres (approx. 5'3\\"). Pauline, the shortest, was no more than 1.54m tall (approx.5'). Like all religious she discovered the ups and downs related to differences in temperament, character, problems of sensitivities or infirmities. After nine years she wrote plainly, \\"the lack of judgment, education, the touchiness of some characters, all these things do not make life very pleasant. I know very well that these moral weaknesses are chronic, that there is no hope of cure\\". But the greatest suffering came from outside Carmel. On 23 June 1888, Louis Martin disappeared from his home and was found days later, in the post office in Le Havre. The incident marked the onset of her father's decline. He died on July 29, 1894. =Novitiate= Certain passages from the prophet Isaiah (Chapter 53) helped her during her long novitiate. (Photograph: fragment of Isaiah found amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls). Th√©r√®se of Lisieux, photograph, c. 1888‚Äì1896 The end of Th√©r√®se's time as a postulant arrived on the January 10, 1889, with her taking of the habit. From that time she wore the 'rough homespun and brown scapular, white wimple and veil, leather belt with rosary, woollen 'stockings', rope sandals\\". Her father's health having temporarily stabilized he was able to attend, though twelve days after her ceremony her father suffered a stroke and was taken to a private sanatorium, the Bon Sauveur at Caen, where he remained for three years before returning to Lisieux in 1892. In this period Th√©r√®se deepened the sense of her vocation; to lead a hidden life, to pray and offer her suffering for priests, to forget herself, to increase discreet acts of charity. She wrote, \\"I applied myself especially to practice little virtues, not having the facility to perform great ones ... In her letters from this period of her novitiate, Th√©r√®se returned over and over to the theme of littleness, referring to herself as a grain of sand, an image she borrowed from Pauline...'Always littler, lighter, in order to be lifted more easily by the breeze of love'. The remainder of her life would be defined by retreat and subtraction\\". She absorbed the work of John of the Cross, spiritual reading uncommon at the time, especially for such a young nun. \\"Oh! what insights I have gained from the works of our holy father, St. John of the Cross! When I was seventeen and eighteen, I had no other spiritual nourishment...\\" She felt a kinship with this classic writer of the Carmelite Order (though nothing seems to have drawn her to the writing of Teresa of Avila), and with enthusiasm she read his works, The Ascent of Mount Carmel, the Way of Purification, the Spiritual Canticle, the Living Flame of Love. Passages from these writings are woven into everything she herself said and wrote. The fear of God, which she found in certain sisters, paralyzed her. \\"My nature is such that fear makes me recoil, with LOVE not only do I go forward, I fly\\". With the new name a Carmelite receives when she enters the Order, there is always an epithet ‚Äì example, Teresa of Jesus, Elizabeth of the Trinity, Anne of the Angels. The epithet singles out the Mystery which she is supposed to contemplate with special devotion. \\"Th√©r√®se's names in religion ‚Äì she had two ‚Äì must be taken together to define their religious significance\\". The first name was promised to her at nine, by Mother Marie de Gonzague, of the Child Jesus, and was given to her on her entry to the convent. In itself, veneration of the childhood of Jesus was a Carmelite heritage of the seventeenth century ‚Äì it concentrated upon the staggering humiliation of divine majesty in assuming the shape of extreme weakness and helplessness. The French Oratory of Jesus and Pierre de B√©rulle renewed this old devotional practice. Yet when she received the veil, Th√©r√®se herself asked Mother Marie de Gonzague to confer upon her the second name of the Holy Face. During the course of her novitiate, contemplation of the Holy Face was said to have nourished her inner life. This is an image representing the disfigured face of Jesus during the Passion. She meditated on certain passages from the prophet Isaiah (Chapter 53). Six weeks before her death she remarked to Pauline, \\"The words in Isaiah: 'no stateliness here, no majesty, no beauty,...one despised, left out of all human reckoning; How should we take any account of him, a man so despised () ‚Äì these words were the basis of my whole worship of the Holy Face. I, too, wanted to be without comeliness and beauty, unknown to all creatures.\\"Last Conversations, 5 August 1897. On the eve of her profession she wrote to Sister Marie, \\"Tomorrow I shall be the bride of Jesus 'whose face was hidden and whom no man knew' ‚Äì what a union and what a future!\\". The meditation also helped her understand the humiliating situation of her father. Usually the novitiate preceding profession lasted a year. Sister Th√©r√®se hoped to make her final commitment on or after 11 January 1890 but, considered still too young for a final commitment, her profession was postponed. She would spend eight months longer than the standard year as an unprofessed novice. As 1889 ended, her old home in the world Les Buissonnets, was dismantled, the furniture divided among the Gu√©rins and the Carmel. It was not until 8 September 1890, aged 17 and a half, that she made her religious profession. The retreat in anticipation of her \\"irrevocable promises\\" was characterized by \\"absolute aridity\\" and on the eve of her profession she gave way to panic. She worried that \\"What she wanted was beyond her. Her vocation was a sham\\". Reassured by the novice mistress and mother Marie de Gonzague, the next day her religious profession went ahead, 'an outpouring of peace flooded my soul, \\"that peace which surpasseth all understanding\\" (Phil. ) Against her heart she wore her letter of profession written during her retreat. \\"May creatures be nothing for me, and may I be nothing for them, but may You, Jesus, be everything! Let nobody be occupied with me, let me be looked upon as one to be trampled underfoot...may Your will be done in me perfectly ... Jesus, allow me to save very many souls; let no soul be lost today; let all the souls in purgatory be saved..\\" On September 24, the public ceremony followed filled with 'sadness and bitterness'. \\"Th√©r√®se found herself young enough, alone enough, to weep over the absence of Bishop Hugonin, P√®re Pichon, in Canada; and her own father, still confined in the asylum\\". But Mother Marie de Gonzague wrote to the prioress of Tours, \\"The angelic child is seventeen and a half, with the sense of a 30 year old, the religious perfection of an old and accomplished novice, and possession of herself, she is a perfect nun\\". =Life as a Carmelite= The years which followed were a maturation. Th√©r√®se prayed without great sensitive emotions, she increased the small acts of charity and care for others, doing small services. She accepted criticism in silence, even unjust criticisms, and smiled at the sisters who were unpleasant to her. She always prayed for priests, and in particular for Father Hyacinthe Loyson, a famous preacher who had been a Sulpician and a Dominican novice before becoming a Carmelite and provincial of his order, but who had left the Catholic Church in 1869. Three years later he married a young Protestant widow, with whom he had a son. After his excommunication, he continued to travel around France giving lectures. While clerical papers called Loyson a \\"renegade monk\\" and Leon Bloy lampooned him, Th√©r√®se prayed for her \\"brother\\". She offered her last communion, 19 August 1897, for Father Loyson. The chaplain to the Carmel, Father Youf, insisted a lot on the fear of Hell. The preachers during spiritual retreats at that time emphasised sin, the sufferings of purgatory, and those of hell. This did not help Th√©r√®se who in 1891 experienced, \\"great inner trials of all kinds, even wondering sometimes whether heaven existed.\\" One phrase heard during a sermon made her weep: \\"No one knows if they are worthy of love or of hate.\\" However the retreat of October 1891 was preached by Father Alexis Prou, a Franciscan from Saint- Nazaire. \\"He specialized in large crowds (he preached in factories) and did not seem the right person to help Carmelites. Just one of them found comfort in his words, Sister Th√®r√®se of the Child Jesus...[his] preaching on abandonment and mercy expanded her heart\\". This confirmed her own intuitions. She wrote, \\"My soul was like a book which the priest read better than I did. He launched me full sail on the waves of confidence and love which held such an attraction for me, but upon which I had not dared to venture. He told me that my faults did not offend God.\\" Her spiritual life drew more and more on the Gospels that she carried with her at all times. The piety of her time was fed more on commentaries, but Th√©r√®se had asked C√©line to get the Gospels and the Epistles of St Paul bound into a single small volume which she could carry on her heart. She said, \\"But it is especially the Gospels which sustain me during my hours of prayer, for in them I find what is necessary for my poor little soul. I am constantly discovering in them new lights, hidden and mysterious meanings.\\"Dominican article on Gospel and Th√©r√®se of Lisieux (in Italian). Over time Th√©r√®se realised that she felt no attraction to the exalted heights of \\"great souls\\". She looked directly for the word of Jesus, which shed light on her prayers and on her daily life. Th√©r√®se's retreat in October 1892 pointed to a \\"downward\\" path for her. If asked where she lived, she would pause and quote, \\"The foxes have their lairs, the birds of heaven their nests, but I have no place to rest my head.\\" (Matthew 8:20). She wrote to C√©line (letter 19 October 1892), \\"Jesus raised us above all the fragile things of this world whose image passes away. Like Zacchaeus, we climbed a tree to see Jesus and now let us listen to what he is saying to us. Make haste to descend, I must lodge today at your house. Well, Jesus tells us to descend?\\" \\"A question here of the interior,\\" she qualified in her letter, lest C√©line think she meant renouncing food or shelter. \\"Th√©r√®se knew her virtues, even her love, to be flawed, flawed by self, a mirror too clouded to reflect the divine.\\" She continued to seek to discover the means, \\"more efficiently to strip herself of self\\". \\"No doubt, [our hearts] are already empty of creatures, but, alas, I feel mine is not entirely empty of myself, and it is for this reason that Jesus tells me to descend.\\"General Correspondence, volume 2, p. 762. =Election of Mother Agnes= On 20 February 1893, Pauline was elected prioress of Carmel and became \\"Mother Agnes\\". She appointed the former prioress as novice mistress and made Th√©r√®se her assistant. The work of guiding the novices would fall primarily to Th√©r√®se. She repeated how important respect for the Rule was: \\"When any break the rule, this is not a reason to justify ourselves. Each must act as if the perfection of the Order depended on her personal conduct.\\" She also affirmed the essential role of obedience in religious life. She said, \\"When you stop watching the infallible compass [of obedience], as quickly the mind wanders in arid lands where the water of grace is soon lacking.\\" Over the next few years she revealed a talent for clarifying doctrine to those who had not received as much education as she. A kaleidoscope, whose three mirrors transform scraps of coloured paper into beautiful designs, provided an inspired illustration for the Holy Trinity. \\"As long as our actions, even the smallest, do not fall away from the focus of Divine Love, the Holy Trinity, symbolized by the three mirrors, allows them to reflect wonderful beauty. Jesus, who regards us through the little lens, that is to say, through Himself, always sees beauty in everything we do. But if we left the focus of inexpressible love, what would He see? Bits of straw ‚Ä¶ dirty, worthless actions\\". \\"Another cherished image was that of the newly invented elevator, a vehicle Th√©r√®se used many times over to describe God's grace, a force that lifts us to heights we can't reach on our own\\". Her sister C√©line's memoir is filled with numerous examples of Th√©r√®se as teacher: \\"C√©line: ‚Äì 'Oh! When I think how much I have to acquire!' Th√©r√®se: ‚Äì 'Rather, how much you have to lose! Jesus Himself will fill your soul with treasures in the same measure that you move your imperfections out of the way.\\" And C√©line recalled a story Th√©r√®se told about egotism. 'The 28 month old Th√©r√®se visited Le Mans and was given a basket filled with candies, at the top of which were two sugar rings. 'Oh! How wonderful! There is a sugar ring for C√©line too!' On her way to the station however the basket overturned, and one of the sugar rings disappeared. 'Ah, I no longer have any sugar ring for poor C√©line!' Reminding me of the incident she observed, 'See how deeply rooted in us is this self-love! Why was it C√©line's sugar ring, and not mine, that was lost?'A Memoir of my Sister, C√©line Martin. Martha of Jesus, a novice who spent her childhood in a series of orphanages and who was described by all as emotionally unbalanced, with a violent temper, gave witness during the beatification process of the 'unusual dedication and presence of her young teacher. \\"Th√©r√®se deliberately 'sought out the company of those nuns whose temperaments she found hardest to bear.' What merit was there in acting charitably toward people whom one loved naturally? Th√©r√®se went out of her way to spend time with, and therefore to love, the people she found repellent. It was an effective means of achieving interior poverty, a way to remove a place to rest her head\\" In September 1893, Th√©r√®se, having been a professed novice for the standard three years, asked not to be promoted but to continue a novice indefinitely. As a novice she would always have to ask permission of the other, full sisters. She would never be elected to any position of importance. Remaining closely associated with the other novices, she could continue to care for her spiritual charges. In 1841 Jules Michelet devoted the major part of the fifth volume of his History of France to a favourable presentation of the epic of Joan of Arc. Felix Dupanloup worked relentlessly for the glorification of Joan who, on 8 May 1429 had liberated Orl√©ans, the city of which he became bishop in 1849. Th√©r√®se wrote two plays in honour of her childhood heroine, the first about Joan's response to the heavenly voices calling her to battle, the second about her resulting martyrdom. 1894 brought a national celebration of Joan of Arc. On 27 January, Leo XIII authorized the introduction of her cause of beatification, declaring Joan, the shepherdess from Lorraine 'venerable'. Th√©r√®se used Henri Wallon's history of Joan of Arc ‚Äì a book her uncle Isidore had given to the Carmel ‚Äì to help her write two plays, 'pious recreations', \\"small theatrical pieces performed by a few nuns for the rest of the community, on the occasion of certain feast days.\\" The first of these, The Mission of Joan of Arc was performed at the Carmel on 21 January 1894, and the second Joan of Arc Accomplishes her Mission, exactly one year later, on 21 January 1895. In the estimation of one of her biographers, Ida G√∂rres, they \\"are scarcely veiled self-portraits\\". On 29 July 1894, Louis Martin died. =The \\"little way\\"= Th√©r√®se entered the Carmel of Lisieux with the determination to become a saint. However, by the end of 1894, six years as a Carmelite made her realize how small and insignificant she felt. She saw the limitations of all her efforts. She remained small and very far off from the unfailing love that she would wish to practice. She is said to have understood then that it was from insignificance that she had to learn to ask God's help. Along with her camera, C√©line had brought notebooks with her, passages from the Old Testament, which Th√©r√®se did not have in Carmel. (The Louvain Bible, the translation authorized for French Catholics, did not include the Old Testament). In the notebooks Th√©r√®se found a passage from Proverbs that struck her with particular force: \\"Whosoever is a little one, let him come to me\\" (). She was struck by another passage from the Book of Isaiah: \\"you shall be carried at the breasts, and upon the knees they shall caress you.As one whom the mother caresseth, so will I comfort you.\\" She concluded that Jesus would carry her to the summit of sanctity. The smallness of Th√©r√®se, her limits, became in this way grounds for joy, rather than discouragement. Not until Manuscript C of her autobiography did she give this discovery the name of little way, \\"petite voie\\". > I will seek out a means of getting to Heaven by a little way‚Äîvery short and > very straight little way that is wholly new. We live in an age of > inventions; nowadays the rich need not trouble to climb the stairs, they > have lifts instead. Well, I mean to try and find a lift by which I may be > raised unto God, for I am too tiny to climb the steep stairway of > perfection. [...] Thine Arms, then, O Jesus, are the lift which must raise > me up even unto Heaven. To get there I need not grow. On the contrary, I > must remain little, I must become still less. In her quest for sanctity and in order to attain holiness and to express her love of God, she believed that it was not necessary to accomplish heroic acts or great deeds. She wrote, Love proves itself by deeds, so how am I to show my love? Great deeds are forbidden me. The only way I can prove my love is by scattering flowers and these flowers are every little sacrifice, every glance and word, and the doing of the least actions for love. The little way of Therese is the foundation of her spirituality. Within the Catholic Church Th√©r√®se's way was known for some time as \\"the little way of spiritual childhood,\\" but Th√©r√®se actually wrote \\"little way\\" only three times, and she never wrote the phrase \\"spiritual childhood.\\" It was her sister Pauline who, after Th√©r√®se's death, adopted the phrase \\"the little way of spiritual childhood\\" to interpret Th√©r√®se's path. Years after Th√©r√®se's death, a Carmelite of Lisieux asked Pauline about this phrase and Pauline answered spontaneously \\"But you know well that Th√©r√®se never used it! It is mine.\\" In May 1897, Th√©r√®se wrote to Father Adolphe Roulland, \\"My way is all confidence and love.\\" To Maurice Belli√®re she wrote, \\"and I, with my way, will do more than you, so I hope that one day Jesus will make you walk by the same way as me.\\" > Sometimes, when I read spiritual treatises in which perfection is shown with > a thousand obstacles, surrounded by a crowd of illusions, my poor little > mind quickly tires. I close the learned book which is breaking my head and > drying up my heart, and I take up Holy Scripture. Then all seems luminous to > me; a single word uncovers for my soul infinite horizons; perfection seems > simple; I see that it is enough to recognize one's nothingness and to > abandon oneself, like a child, into God's arms. Leaving to great souls, to > great minds, the beautiful books I cannot understand, I rejoice to be little > because only children, and those who are like them, will be admitted to the > heavenly banquet. =Merciful love= At the end of the second play that Th√©r√®se had written on Joan of Arc, the costume she wore almost caught fire. The alcohol stoves used to represent the stake at Rouen set fire to the screen behind which Th√©r√®se stood. Th√©r√®se did not flinch but the incident marked her. The theme of fire would assume an increasing importance in her writings. On 9 June 1895, during a Mass celebrating the feast of the Holy Trinity, Th√©r√®se had a sudden inspiration that she must offer herself as a sacrificial victim to merciful love. At this time some nuns offered themselves as a victim to God's justice. In her cell she drew up an 'Act of Oblation' for herself and for C√©line, and on 11 June, the two of them knelt before the miraculous Virgin and Th√©r√®se read the document she had written and signed. In the evening of this life, I shall appear before You with empty hands, for I do not ask You Lord to count my works. According to biographer, Ida G√∂rres, the document echoed the happiness she had felt when Father Alexis Prou, the Franciscan preacher, had assured her that her faults did not cause God sorrow. In the Oblation she wrote, \\"If through weakness I should chance to fall, may a glance from Your Eyes straightway cleanse my soul, and consume all my imperfections ‚Äì as fire transforms all things into itself\\". Father Adolphe Roulland of the Society of Foreign Missions In August 1895 the four Martin sisters were joined in the convent by their cousin, Marie Guerin, who became Sister Marie of the Eucharist. L√©onie, after several attempts, became Sister Fran√ßoise-Th√©r√®se, a nun in the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary in Caen, where she died in 1941. At age 14, she understood her vocation was to pray for priests, to be \\"an apostle to apostles\\". In September 1890, at her canonical examination before she professed her religious vows, she was asked why she had come to Carmel. She answered \\"I came to save souls, and especially to pray for priests\\". Throughout her life she prayed fervently for priests, and she corresponded with and prayed for a young priest, Adolphe Roulland, and a young seminarian, Maurice Belli√®re. She wrote to her sister \\"Our mission as Carmelites is to form evangelical workers who will save thousands of souls whose mothers we shall be.\\" In October 1895 a young seminarian and subdeacon of the White Fathers, Abb√© Belli√®re, asked the Carmel of Lisieux for a nun who would support ‚Äì by prayer and sacrifice ‚Äì his missionary work, and the souls that were in the future to be entrusted to him. Mother Agnes designated Th√©r√®se. She never met Father Belli√®re but ten letters passed between them. A year later Father Adolphe Roulland (1870‚Äì1934) of the Society of Foreign Missions requested the same service of the Lisieux Carmel. Once more Th√©r√®se was assigned the duties of spiritual sister. \\"It is quite clear that Th√©r√®se, in spite of all her reverence for the priestly office, in both cases felt herself to be the teacher and the giver. It is she who consoles and warns, encourages and praises, answers questions, offers corroboration, and instructs the priests in the meaning of her little way\\". =Final years= Th√©r√®se's final years were marked by a steady decline that she bore resolutely and without complaint. Tuberculosis was the key element of Th√©r√®se's final suffering, but she saw that as part of her spiritual journey. After observing a rigorous Lenten fast in 1896, she went to bed on the eve of Good Friday and felt a joyous sensation. She wrote: \\"Oh! how sweet this memory really is! ... I had scarcely laid my head upon the pillow when I felt something like a bubbling stream mounting to my lips. I didn't know what it was.\\" The next morning her handkerchief was soaked in blood and she understood her fate. Coughing up of blood meant tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meant death. She wrote, \\"I thought immediately of the joyful thing that I had to learn, so I went over to the window. I was able to see that I was not mistaken. Ah! my soul was filled with a great consolation; I was interiorly persuaded that Jesus, on the anniversary of His own death, wanted to have me hear His first call!\\" Th√©r√®se corresponded with a Carmelite mission in what was then French Indochina and was invited to join them, but, because of her sickness, could not travel. As a result of tuberculosis, she suffered terribly. When she was near death, \\"Her physical suffering kept increasing so that even the doctor himself was driven to exclaim, \\"Ah! If you only knew what this young nun was suffering!\\" During the last hours of Th√©r√®se's life, she said, \\"I would never have believed it was possible to suffer so much, never, never!\\" In July 1897, she made a final move to the monastery infirmary. On August 19, 1897, she received her last communion. She died on 30 September 1897, aged 24. On her death-bed, she is reported to have said, \\"I have reached the point of not being able to suffer any more, because all suffering is sweet to me.\\" Her last words were, \\"My God, I love you!\\"Saint Th√©r√®se of Lisieux (1996). Story of a Soul: the Autobiography of St. Therese of Lisieux. Translated by John Clarke, O.C.D. (3rd ed.). Washington, DC: Institute of Carmelite Studies Publications, p. 271 Th√©r√®se was buried on 4 October 1897, in the Carmelite plot, in the municipal cemetery at Lisieux, where her parents had been buried. Her body was exhumed in September 1910 and the remains placed in a lead coffin and transferred to another tomb. In March 1923, however, before she was beatified, her body was returned to the Carmel of Lisieux, where it remains. The figure of Th√©r√®se in the glass coffin is not her actual body but a gisant statue based on drawings and photos by C√©line after Th√©r√®se's death. It contains her ribcage and other remnants of her body. Spirituality > To the right and to the left, I throw to my little birds the good grain that > God places in my hands. And then I let things take their course! I busy > myself with it no more. Sometimes, it's just as though I had thrown nothing; > at other times, it does some good. But God tells me: 'Give, give always, > without being concerned with the results.; Together with Francis of Assisi, Th√©r√®se of Lisieux is one of the most popular Roman Catholic saints since apostolic times. She is approachable, due in part to her historical proximity. Barbara Stewart, writing for The New York Times, once called Th√©r√®se \\"...the Emily Dickinson of Roman Catholic sainthood\\".Stewart, Barbara (17 October 1999), \\"A Link to the Quiet Little Life of St. Therese\\", The New York Times. As a Doctor of the Church, she is the subject of much theological comment and study, and, as a young woman whose message has touched the lives of millions, she remains the focus of much popular devotion. She was a highly influential model of sanctity for Catholics in the first half of the twentieth century because of the simplicity and practicality of her approach to the spiritual life. Th√©r√®se was devoted to Eucharistic adoration and on 26 February 1895, shortly before she died wrote from memory and without a rough draft her poetic masterpiece \\"To Live by Love\\" which she had composed during Eucharistic adoration. During her life, the poem was sent to various religious communities and was included in a notebook of her poems.Bancroft, Alan (2001), Collected poems of St Th√©r√®se of Lisieux by Saint Th√©r√®se (de Lisieux), , p. 75. Th√©r√®se lived a hidden life and \\"wanted to be unknown\\", yet became popular after her death through her spiritual autobiography. She also left letters, poems, religious plays, prayers, and her last conversations were recorded by her sisters. Paintings and photographs ‚Äì mostly the work of her sister C√©line ‚Äì further led to her becoming known. Th√©r√®se said on her death-bed, \\"I only love simplicity. I have a horror of pretence\\", and she spoke out against some of the claims made concerning the lives of saints written in her day, \\"We should not say improbable things, or things we do not know. We must see their real, and not their imagined lives\\". The depth of her spirituality, of which she said, \\"my way is all confidence and love\\", has inspired many believers up to the current day. In the face of her littleness she trusted to God her sanctity. She wanted to go to heaven by an entirely new little way. \\"I wanted to find an elevator that would raise me to Jesus\\". The elevator, she wrote, would be the arms of Jesus lifting her in all her littleness. =The Holy Face of Jesus= A depiction of the Holy Face of Jesus as Veronica's veil, by Claude Mellan c. 1649 The devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus was promoted by another Carmelite nun, Sister Marie of St Peter in Tours, France in 1844.

Her parents, Louis and Z√©lie Martin, had also prayed at the Oratory of the Holy Face, originally established by Dupont in Tours.Redmond, Paulinus (1995), Louis and Zelie Martin: The Seed and the Root of the Little Flower, Cimino Press; , p. 257. This devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus was based on images of the Veil of Veronica, as promoted by Dupont, rather than the Shroud of Turin, which image first appeared on a photographic negative in 1898. On 10 January 1889, she was given the habit and received the name Th√©r√®se of the Child Jesus. On 8 September 1890, Th√©r√®se took her vows. The ceremony of taking the veil followed on the 24th, when she added to her name in religion, \\"of the Holy Face\\", a title which was to become increasingly important in the development and character of her inner life. In his \\"A l'ecole de Therese de Lisieux: maitresse de la vie spirituelle, \\"Bishop Guy Gaucher emphasizes that Therese saw the devotions to the Child Jesus and to the Holy Face as so completely linked that she signed herself \\"Therese de l'Enfant Jesus de la Sainte Face\\"‚ÄîTherese of the Child Jesus of the Holy Face. In her poem \\"My Heaven down here\\", composed in 1895, Therese expressed the notion that by the divine union of love, the soul takes on the semblance of Christ. By contemplating the sufferings associated with the Holy Face of Jesus, she felt she could become closer to Christ. She wrote the words \\"Make me resemble you, Jesus!\\" on a small card and attached a stamp with an image of the Holy Face. She pinned the prayer in a small container over her heart. Th√©r√®se wrote many prayers to express her devotion to the Holy Face. In August 1895, in her \\"Canticle to the Holy Face,\\" she wrote:\\"Jesus, Your ineffable image is the star which guides my steps. Ah, You know, Your sweet Face is for me Heaven on earth. My love discovers the charms of Your Face adorned with tears. I smile through my own tears when I contemplate Your sorrows.\\" Th√©r√®se emphasised God's mercy in both the birth and the passion narratives in the Gospel. She wrote, \\"He sees it disfigured, covered with blood!... unrecognizable!... And yet the divine Child does not tremble; this is what He chooses to show His love\\". She composed the \\"Holy Face Prayer for Sinners\\", \\"Eternal Father, since Thou hast given me for my inheritance the adorable Face of Thy Divine Son, I offer that face to Thee and I beg Thee, in exchange for this coin of infinite value, to forget the ingratitude of souls dedicated to Thee and to pardon all poor sinners.\\"Therese of Lisieux. \\"Holy Face Prayer for Sinners\\", Catholic.org. Over the decades, her poems and prayers helped to spread the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus. The Story of a Soul \\"St. Therese of Lisieux \\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Therese-of- Lisieux Cover page of The Story of a Soul (l'Histoire d'une √Çme) by Th√©r√®se of Lisieux, √©dition 1940 Basilica of St. Therese in Lisieux St. Th√©r√®se is best known today for her spiritual memoir, L'histoire d'une √¢me (The Story of a Soul). It is a compilation of three separate manuscripts. The first, in 1895 is a memoir of her childhood, written under obedience to the Prioress, Mother Agnes of Jesus, her older sister Pauline. Mother Agnes gave the order after being prompted by their eldest sister, Sister Marie of the Sacred Heart.Affidavit by the Reverend Mother Agnes of Jesus. Bayeux Archives, Vol 1 The second is a three-page letter, written in September 1896, at the request of her eldest sister Marie, who, aware of the seriousness of Th√©r√®se's illness, asked her to set down her \\"little doctrine\\". In June 1897, Mother Agnes asked Mother Marie de Gonzague, who had succeeded her as prioress, to allow Th√©r√®se to write another memoir with more details of her religious life (ostensibly as a help in the later composition of an anticipated obituary).Fr. Fran√ßoise de Sainte Marie, O.C.D, in Introduction (1958), Autobiography of a Saint, translated by Ronald Arbuthnott Knox, p. 13, Harvill Press, While on her deathbed Th√©r√®se made a number of references to the book's future appeal and benefit to souls. She authorized Pauline to make any changes deemed necessary. It was heavily edited by Pauline (Mother Agnes), who made more than seven thousand revisions to Th√©r√®se's manuscript and presented it as a biography of her sister. Aside from considerations of style, Mother Marie de Gonzague had ordered Pauline to alter the first two sections of the manuscript to make them appear as if they were addressed to Mother Marie as well. The book was sent out as the customary \\"circular\\" advising other Carmels of a nun's death and requesting their prayers. However, it received a much wider circulation, as copies were lent out and passed around.

With Mother Agnes' permission, she brought her camera to Carmel, and developing materials. \\"The indulgence was not by any means usual. Also outside of the normal would be the destiny of those photographs C√©line would make in the Carmel, images that would be scrutinized and reproduced too many times to count. Even when the images are poorly reproduced, her eyes arrest us. Described as blue, described as gray, they look darker in photographs. C√©line's pictures of her sister contributed to the extraordinary cult of personality that formed in the years after Th√©r√®se's death\\".The Martin family's relentless promotion of Th√©r√®se and recreating her in a hagiographic image through photographs, paintings, drawings and writings is documented in Sophia Deboick's Image, Authenticity and the Cult of Saint Th√©r√®se of Lisieux, 1897‚Äì1959 (Univ. of Liverpool, 2011) entire text online at academia.edu. In 1902, the Polish Carmelite Father Raphael Kalinowski (later Raphael Kalinowski) translated her autobiography, The Story of a Soul, into Polish. As early as 1912 Father Thomas N. Taylor, a teacher at the Diocese of Glasgow seminary, wrote a short hagiography on Th√©r√®se, two years before the case for her canonization would be opened. Taylor went on to become a significant proponent of devotion to \\"The Little Flower\\" in Scotland.Harris, Alana (2016), \\"Th√©r√®se of Lisieux\\", Gareth Atkins, ed., Making and Remaking Saints in Nineteenth-Century Britain, Oxford University Press. As pastor of St. Francis Xavier Church in Carfin, Lanarkshire, he built a replica of the Grotto at Lourdes and included a small shrine honoring St. Th√©r√®se with a statue donated by the Legion of Mary. Carfin became a site of pilgrimages.Williamson, Clifford (2016) \\"Chap.5: Carfin and the Little Flower\\", The History of Catholic Intellectual Life in Scotland, 1918‚Äì1965, Palgrave Macmillan, 2016 Recognition =Canonization= The canonization of Saint Th√©r√®se in St. Peter's Basilica, Rome The impact of The Story of a Soul, a collection of her autobiographical manuscripts, printed and distributed a year after her death to an initially very limited audience, was significant. Pope Pius XI made her the \\"star of his pontificate\\". Pius X signed the decree for the opening of the process of canonization on 10 June 1914. Pope Benedict XV, in order to hasten the process, dispensed with the usual fifty-year delay required between death and beatification. On 14 August 1921, he promulgated the decree on the heroic virtues of Th√©r√®se declaring her \\"Venerable\\". She was beatified on 29 April 1923. Therese was canonized on 17 May 1925 by Pope Pius XI, only 28 years after her death.Canonization of St. Th√©r√®se Homily of Pope Pius XI at the Canonization of St. Th√©r√®se on 17 May 1925. Th√©r√®se was declared a saint five years and a day after Joan of Arc. However, the 1925 celebration for Th√©r√®se \\"far outshone\\" that for the legendary heroine of France. At the time, Pope Pius XI revived the old custom of covering St. Peter's with torches and tallow lamps. According to one account, \\"Ropes, lamps and tallows were pulled from the dusty storerooms where they had been packed away for 55 years. A few old workmen who remembered how it was done the last time ‚Äî in 1870 ‚Äî directed 300 men for two weeks as they climbed about fastening lamps to St. Peter's dome.\\" The New York Times ran a front-page story about the occasion titled, \\"All Rome Admires St. Peter's Aglow for a New Saint\\". According to the Times, over 60,000 people, estimated to be the largest crowd inside St. Peter's Basilica since the coronation of Pope Pius X, 22 years before, witnessed the canonization ceremonies. In the evening, 500,000 pilgrims pressed into the lit square. She rapidly became one of the most popular saints of the twentieth century. Her feast day was added to the General Roman Calendar in 1927 for celebration on October 3.Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 104. In 1969, 42 years later, Pope Paul VI moved it to October 1, the day after her dies natalis (birthday to heaven).Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 141. Th√©r√®se of Lisieux is the patron saint of aviators, florists, illness(es) and missions. She is also considered by Catholics to be the patron saint of Russia, although the Russian Orthodox Church does not recognize either her canonization or her patronage. In 1927, Pope Pius XI named Th√©r√®se co-patron of the missions, with Francis Xavier. In 1944 Pope Pius XII decreed her a co-patron of France with Joan of Arc. The principal patron of France is the Blessed Virgin Mary. By the Apostolic Letter Divini Amoris Scientia (The Science of Divine Love) of 19 October 1997, Pope John Paul II declared her the thirty-third Doctor of the Church,Pope John Paul II (19 October 1997), Divini amoris scientia. the youngest person, and one of only four women so named, the others being Teresa of √Åvila, Hildegard of Bingen and Catherine of Siena. Devotion to Th√©r√®se has developed around the world. According to some biographies of √âdith Piaf, in 1922 the singer ‚Äî at the time, an unknown seven-year-old girl ‚Äî was cured from blindness after a pilgrimage to the grave of Th√©r√®se, who at the time was not yet formally canonized. =Canonization of her parents= Statue of Saint Therese of Lisieux at the Church of Our Lady Victorious, Prague Z√©lie and Louis Martin were the first spouses to be proposed for canonization as a couple and the first to be canonized together. In 2004, the Archbishop of Milan accepted the unexpected cure of Pietro Schiliro, an Italian child born near Milan in 2002 with a lung disorder, as a miracle attributable to their intercession. Announced by Cardinal Saraiva Martins on 12 July 2008, at the ceremonies marking the 150th anniversary of the marriage of the Venerable Z√©lie and Louis Martin, their beatification as a couple took place on 19 October 2008, in Lisieux. In 2011, the letters of Blessed Z√©lie and Louis Martin were published in English as A Call to a Deeper Love: The Family Correspondence of the Parents of Saint Th√©r√®se of the Child Jesus, 1863‚Äì1885. On 7 January 2013, in Valencia, Spain, the diocesan process opened to examine a \\"presumed miracle\\" attributed to their intercession: the healing of a newborn girl, Carmen P√©rez Pons, who was born prematurely four days after their beatification and who inexplicably recovered from severe bleeding of the brain and other complications.Juana, Alvaro de (17 October 2015), \\"The Miracle Behind the Canonization of the Parents of St Therese of Lisieux\\", Catholic News Agency On 21 May 2013, the diocesan process to examine the miracle closed and the dossier was sent to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome. Louis and Z√©lie Martin were canonized on 18 October 2015. =Canonization cause of her sister L√©onie= Th√©r√®se's older sister, L√©onie Martin, the only one of the five sisters who did not become a Carmelite nun, is also a candidate for sainthood. Leonie attempted the religious life three times before her fourth and final entrance in 1899 to the convent of the Visitation in Caen. She took the name Sister Fran√ßoise-Th√©r√®se and was a fervent disciple of Th√©r√®se's way. She died in 1941 in Caen, where her tomb in the crypt of the Visitation Monastery may be visited by the public. On 25 March 2012, Mgr Jean-Claude Boulanger, Bishop of Bayeux and Lisieux, granted the imprimatur for a prayer asking that Leonie might be declared venerable.O'Riordan, Maureen, \\"L√©onie Martin, Disciple and Sister of St. Th√©r√®se of Lisieux\\" On 2 July 2015, the diocesan inquiry into Leonie's life and possible sanctity was opened at the chapel of the Monastery of the Visitation at Caen. She is now styled , Leonie Martin, Servant of God. =Relics of Saint Th√©r√®se= Detail of a first-class carne leftThe relics of St. Th√©r√®se have been on an international pilgrimage since 1994.\\"Pilgrim Saints: Relics on Tour\\", Archdiocese of Newark The tour included not only first-class relics, but also the saint's religious habit, her rosary, and several other items. They were brought to Ireland in the summer of 2001.\\"Saint‚Äôs Relics Arrive at Knock on Irish Tour 2001\\", RTE Archives. That same year they travelled to Canada. Although Cardinal Basil Hume had declined to endorse proposals for a tour in 1997, her relics finally visited England and Wales in late September and early October 2009, including an overnight stop at the Anglican York Minster on her feast day, 1 October. A quarter of a million people venerated them.Arco, Ann \\"Tens of Thousands Flock to St. Th√©r√®se Relics\\", 25 September 2009, The Catholic Herald (UK) On 27 June 2010, the relics of Saint Th√©r√®se went on their first visit to South Africa in conjunction with the 2010 FIFA World Cup. They remained in the country until October 5, 2010.

All Sea-Doo models are driven by an impeller-driven waterjet. All Sea-Doo PWC models are currently produced in BRP's plants in Quer√©taro and Ju√°rez, Mexico. Its Rotax engines are produced at BRP's plant in Gunskirchen, Austria. In 2016, Sea-Doo had a 45.8% market share among PWC brands. History Bombardier introduced its first personal watercraft in 1968, called the Bombardier Sea-Doo. It was designed and mentored by Clayton Jacobson II, who would later develop the more successful Kawasaki Jet Ski watercraft. Also heavily involved was Bombardier's Laurent Beaudoin, who was interested in expanding the success of the Ski-Doo snowmobile to the water. Marketed as the \\"Jet-powered Aqua Scooter\\", the original yellow Sea-Doo was 5 feet wide and 7.5 feet long, somewhat resembling a flying saucer. For 1968, it was powered by an air-cooled, 320cc engine with a top speed of 25 mph. Following complaints of overheating and inefficiency, it was replaced for 1969 with a water cooled 367cc engine. There were common complaints about discomfort from its flat seat and minimally-padded Ski-Doo supplied stainless steel handle bars. After only two years on the market, it was discontinued. PWC. The Sea-Doo was re-introduced in 1988 as its own brand under Bombardier, signaling a turnaround in the company's declining fortunes. Annual sales for the Sea-Doo were over 100,000 units in the 1995 fiscal year, at which point the company had captured over half of the personal watercraft market. In 1997 the company earned $212 million on the Sea-Doo. Models There are five categories of Sea-Doo models: Recreation, Tow Sports, Touring, Sport Fishing, and Performance. The Sea-Doo jet-powered sport boats included a four-seater Sportster 150 with 155 hp or 215 hp, a four- seater Speedster 150 with 255 hp, a seven-seater Speedster 200 with 310 hp, and a Speedster 230 with space for up to twelve persons. The Wake 200 model was made for wakeboarding and two Challenger models were less sporty and more luxurious: a smaller Challenger 180 and a larger Challenger 230. In 2012 BRP discontinued the sport boat production citing a decline in global sales in the marine industry. This meant the loss of 350 jobs, including most of those at a plant in Benton, Illinois. The Sea-Doo Spark was released for 2014 which was aimed to attract new buyers to the decreasing PWC market. This model was in development for eight years and was code-named CAFE (clean, affordable, fun, and easy to use). It used a unique polytec hull and deck structure to cut costs and weight. The Spark quickly became the best selling Sea-Doo model.

Named after the nearby Victoria Street (not the Queen), the main line station is a terminus of the Brighton main line to and and the Chatham main line to and Dover via . From the main lines, trains can connect to the Catford Loop Line, Dartford Loop Line, and the Oxted line to and . Southern operates most commuter and regional services to south London, Sussex and parts of east Surrey, while Southeastern operates trains to south east London and Kent. Gatwick Express trains run direct to Gatwick. The Underground station is on the Circle and District lines between and , and the Victoria line between and . The area around the station is an important interchange for other forms of transport: a local bus station is in the forecourt and Victoria Coach Station is nearby. Victoria was built to serve both the Brighton and Chatham main lines, and has always had a \\"split\\" feel of being two separate stations. The Brighton station opened in 1860 with the Chatham station following two years later. It replaced a temporary terminus at Pimlico and construction involved building the Grosvenor Bridge over the River Thames. It became immediately popular as a London terminus, causing delays and requiring upgrades and rebuilding. It was well known for luxury Pullman train services and continental boat train trips and became a focal point for soldiers during World War I. Like other London termini, steam trains were phased out of Victoria by the 1960s, to be replaced by suburban electric and diesel multiple unit services. Despite the end of international services following the opening of the Channel Tunnel, Victoria still remains an important London station, and its Underground facilities, in particular, suffer from overcrowding. The Gatwick Express service provides easy access between Central London and Gatwick Airport for international travellers. Location The station complex is in Victoria in the City of Westminster, immediately south of the London Inner Ring Road. It is located south of Victoria Street, east of Buckingham Palace Road and west of Vauxhall Bridge Road. Several different railways lead into the station line by way of Grosvenor Bridge from the south west, south and south east. It is in Travelcard Zone 1 and is one of 19 stations managed by Network Rail. It has been a Grade II listed building since 1970. Victoria Coach Station is about 300 metres south-west of the railway stations. It is the main London coach terminal and serves all parts of the UK and mainland Europe. London Buses routes 2, 11, 13, 16, 24, 36, 38, 44, 52, 148, 170, 185, 211, 390, 507, C1, C10 and night routes N2, N11, N16, N38, N44 and N136 serve the station at Victoria bus station or neighbouring streets. History =Background= By 1850, railways serving destinations to the south of London had three termini available ‚Äì , and Waterloo. All three were inconvenient for Central London as they terminated south of the river Thames, whereas the main centres of population, business and government were north of the river in the City of London, the West End and Westminster. Victoria Station was designed in a piecemeal fashion to help address this problem for the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR;) and the London Chatham and Dover Railway (LC&DR;). It consisted of two adjacent main line railway stations which, from the viewpoint of passengers, were unconnected. =Early history= Victoria Station in 1897, showing the separate Brighton (left) and Chatham (right) stations. The London and Brighton Railway terminus at London Bridge provided reasonable access to the City of London but was inconvenient for travellers to and from Westminster. As early as 1842 John Urpeth Rastrick had proposed that the railway should build a branch to serve the West End, but his proposal was unsuccessful. However, the transfer of the Crystal Palace from Hyde Park to Sydenham Hill between 1851 and 1854 created a major tourist attraction in the then rural area south of London, and the LB&SCR; opened a branch line from the Brighton main line at Sydenham to the site in 1854. While this was under construction the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway also planned a line from Crystal Palace, to a new station at Battersea Wharf, at the southern end of the new Chelsea Bridge. Despite its location, the new station was called Pimlico. It opened on 27 March 1858, but was very much regarded as a temporary terminus, composed of a small number of wooden huts, and positioned immediately next to a proposed bridge over the Thames. Shortly afterwards the LB&SCR; leased most of the lines of the new railway, and built a further connection from Crystal Palace to the Brighton main line at Norwood Junction, thereby providing itself with a route into west London, although it was recognised that a terminus would be needed on the north side of the river. The approaches to Victoria Station in 1912. The line leading to the station is top right, the 'Brighton line' (shown in green) is bottom left and the 'Chatham line' (pink) bottom right. The connection to the GWR and LNWR (purple) is top left. During the summer of 1857 a scheme for an independent \\"Grosvenor Basin Terminus\\" in the West End of London, \\"for the use of the Southern Railways of England\\" was mooted. The station was originally referred to as the \\"Grosvenor Terminus\\" but later renamed Victoria as it was sited at the end of Victoria Street. Three other railway companies were also seeking a terminus in Westminster: the Great Western (GWR), the London & North Western (LNWR), and the East Kent Railway (EKR). The first two already had rail access to Battersea through their joint ownership of the West London Line with the LB&SCR.; In 1858, the EKR leased the remaining lines of the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway from Shortlands railway station, and also negotiated temporary running powers over the lines recently acquired by the LB&SCR;, pending the construction of its own line into west London. On 23 July 1859 these four companies together formed the Victoria Station and Pimlico Railway (VS&PR;) company, with the object of extending the railway from Stewarts Lane Junction, Battersea across the river to a more convenient location nearer the West End, and the following month the EKR changed its name to the London Chatham and Dover Railway. The new line followed part of the route of the Grosvenor Canal with Victoria station on the former canal basin. It required the construction of a new bridge over the Thames, originally known as Victoria Bridge and later as Grosvenor Bridge. The bridge was long, which was required so that it could clear all river traffic. It was designed by John Fowler. The line was built as mixed gauge from Longhedge Junction, Battersea, to cater for GWR trains. It required a 1-in-50 climb and a turn from the LSWR main line to reach the bridge. The LB&SCR; had hoped to amalgamate with the VS&PR;, and introduced a parliamentary bill to allow it to do so in 1860. This was opposed by the GWR and LC&DR; and rejected. By way of compromise the LB&SCR; was permitted to lease Victoria station from the VS&PR;, but agreed to accommodate the other railways until a terminus could be built for them on an adjoining site. Plan of Victoria Station as it was in 1888. The 'Chatham' side was rebuilt in 1906 and the 'Brighton' side in 1898‚Äì1908 The LB&SCR; side of Victoria station opened on 1 October 1860, the temporary terminus in Battersea having closed the day before. The station was designed by Robert Jacomb Hood. It consisted of six platforms and ten tracks, with an entrance on Victoria Street. The site then covered and was long and wide. The roof was built on a set of wrought iron girders, with an additional safety row that would allow the main girders to withstand a train strike. On the northwest corner of the station was the 300-bedroom Grosvenor Hotel. It was designed by J. T. Knowles, and run independently of the station itself. It opened in 1861. The LCDR and GWR opened their own station on 25 August 1862, occupying a less imposing wooden-fronted building with an entrance on Wilton Road. The Chatham line station had eight platforms, five of which were of mixed gauge, shared by broad-gauge trains of the GWR from Windsor via Southall. =Post-opening= Victoria station proved to be unexpectedly popular for both the main companies, and by 1862 there were frequent delays due to congestion at Stewarts Lane Junction. In March 1863 the LB&SCR; and the LC&DR; jointly funded a new high-level route into Victoria, avoiding Stewarts Lane and requiring the widening of Grosvenor Bridge, including the replacement of the broad-gauge rails with a third LB&SCR; line. The work was completed during 1867/8. The South Eastern Railway (SER) wanted to use Victoria as a London terminus as it was more convenient than London Bridge, but were advised they would need to pay extensive tolls and expenses to do so. Consequently, the SER constructed a station at instead. The GWR began services on 1 April 1863, connecting Victoria to Southall, and later some services to Uxbridge, , and Windsor. From 13 August 1866 the LB&SCR; ran services from Victoria to London Bridge along the newly completed South London Line. The Great Northern Railway began a service from Victoria to Barnet (via ) on 1 March 1868, with other cross-London services running via Victoria in the 1870s. In 1898 the LB&SCR; decided to demolish its station and replace it with an enlarged red-brick Renaissance-style building, designed by Charles Langbridge Morgan. Since widening of the station was prevented by the LC&DR; station and Buckingham Palace Road, increased capacity was achieved by lengthening the platforms and building crossovers to allow two trains to use each platform simultaneously. Work was completed in 1908, and included the rebuilding of the Grosvenor Hotel at the same time. The site then covered with of platforms. Overhead electric trains began to run into Victoria on 1 December 1909, to London Bridge. The line to Crystal Palace was electrified on 12 May 1911. Victoria became well known for its Pullman services during the late 19th century. The LB&SCR; introduced the first Pullman first-class service to Brighton on 1 November 1875, followed by the first all-Pullman train in the UK on 1 December 1881. Another all-Pullman service was introduced in 1908 under the name of the Southern Belle, then described as \\"... the most luxurious train in the world...\\". The SECR began Pullman continental services on 21 April 1910 and on domestic services to the Kent coast on 16 June 1919. The Golden Arrow, another all-Pullman train began services in 1924, and remained in service until 30 September 1972. The London Chatham and Dover Station as rebuilt by the South Eastern and Chatham Railway. The LC&DR; and GWR jointly leased the 'Chatham' portion of the station for 999 years from 28 June 1860, with the GWR responsible for 6.67%.GWR Memorandum for the Board 23 January 1931. National Archives RAIL 1057/2931. The LC&DR; completed its main line as far as Canterbury on 3 December 1860 and began to use the LB&SCR; station on that day. The Eastern side in 1958 From 1899 the LC&DR; entered a working union with its rival, the South Eastern Railway, to form the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR). As a result, services from its station at Victoria began to be rationalised and integrated with those from the other SECR termini. The LC&DR; station began to be reconstructed in the late 19th century after several properties on Buckingham Palace Road, and the hotel, were bought by the company. Work began in 1899 with the removal of the old roof. The rebuilt station was partially opened on 10 June 1906, with additional platforms and cab exit on 10 February the following year, along with a new annexe to the hotel. It was formally re-opened on 1 July 1908. As a consequence of the rebuilding, boat trains become more popular from Victoria compared to Charing Cross and Cannon Street. Services increased to serve Ostend and Calais via Dover and Rotterdam via Gravesend. The LB&SCR; part of the station also served Dieppe via Newhaven. Victoria has since seen more visits from royalty and heads of state than any other London station. During the funeral of Edward VII, seven kings, over 20 princes and five archdukes were greeted here. In the early 20th century, the development and improvement of the London Underground, meant that Victoria could not compete as a cross- London service. GNR trains stopped running on 1 October 1907, with Midland ones following on June the next year. The GWR ceased to use the station for scheduled services on 21 March 1915, partly due to World War I in addition to the new Underground lines. Victoria was used as the main station for drafted soldiers, and those returning from action in the war. By the middle of the war, the station served twelve trains a day running between Victoria and Folkestone, with additional trains serving Dover. The station was regularly served with a voluntary buffet for departing soldiers, who served up to 4,000 men a day. Victoria itself did not suffer significant damage during the war, but a section of Grosvenor Bridge was destroyed after an anti-aircraft shell struck a gas main underneath it. Following the war, memorials were built on both parts of the station. The Southern Railway side marks 626 soldiers killed or missing, while the Chatham side marks 556. A plaque marks the arrival of the body of The Unknown Warrior at Victoria on 10 November 1920. The service to Ostend via Dover was re-introduced on 18 January 1919. Civilian trains to Boulogne via Folkestone restarted on 3 February. Boat train services to Newhaven started on 1 June, and a connection with Paris started on 15 July. On 8 January 1920, Victoria replaced Charing Cross as the main station for continental services, as it had more facilities and closer locomotive and carriage facilities. The service to Paris via Calais and Dover began on the same day. =Southern Railway= The Brighton side concourse in 1955 The two stations at Victoria came largely under single ownership in 1923 with the formation of the Southern Railway (SR) as part of the Big Four grouping. The following year steps were taken to integrate the two stations. The platforms were renumbered in a single sequence, openings were made in the wall separating them to allow passengers to pass from one to the other without going into the street, and alterations were made to the tracks to allow for interchangeable working. The work was completed in 1925, and all platforms were renumbered in a contiguous sequence. Electric suburban services to Herne Hill and Orpington first ran on 12 July that year, followed by South London line services on 17 June 1928, and electric services to Crystal Palace and (via ) on 3 March 1929. The SR also concentrated continental steamer traffic at Victoria, introducing the Golden Arrow, in 1924, and the Night Ferry in 1936. The Central side in 1961 with train from Tunbridge Wells West The station had a news cinema (later a cartoon cinema) that showed a continuous programme. The cinema was designed by Alastair Macdonald, son of the Prime Minister Ramsay, and was in operation from 1933 until it was demolished in 1981. The GWR remained part-owner of the station until 1932 thereafter retaining running powers, although it does not appear to have used them. Night train services stopped running from Victoria on 4 September 1939 after World War II was declared, and other services were terminated following the German invasion of France in May 1940. Though the station was bombed several times in 1940 and 1941, there was not enough damage to prevent operations. A plane crashed into the eastern side of the station on 15 September 1940 and a flying bomb caused partial damage on 27 June 1944. The greatest change to the station during the 1920s and 1930s was the introduction of third rail electrification for all suburban and many main line services, replacing the original LB&SCR; overhead scheme by 1929 and largely replacing steam traction, except on Chatham Section main line and Oxted line trains. Services to were electrified in 1925 and Epsom the following year. By 1932 the Brighton main line was electrified, quickly followed by those to other Sussex coastal towns and Portsmouth by 1938. The brand name \\"Southern Electric\\" was applied to all these services. The Brighton Belle, the first electric all-Pullman service in the world, ran from Victoria from 29 June 1934 until its withdrawal in 1972. =Nationalisation= The Golden Arrow leaving Victoria Station, 1953 British Railways (BR) took over the station on 1 January 1948. A new set of offices for Continental trains opened on 14 June, while the eastern booking hall was renovated, opening on 5 February 1951.New Booking Hall at Victoria Railway Gazette 9 February 1951 page 163 During the 1950s and early 1960s British Railways (Southern Region) completed its Kent Coast Electrification schemes, which meant that most of the remaining services from the station were electrified, including boat trains. Some minor services were withdrawn, and the few remaining steam services, to Oxted and beyond, were replaced by diesel-electric multiple units. Various plans were proposed at this time to redevelop Victoria, including new offices, hotels and a helicopter station. The last steam service left Victoria on 8 January 1964 to , after which it was replaced by diesel-electric multiple units. The station was redeveloped internally in the 1980s, with the addition of shops within the concourse, and above the western platforms as the \\"Victoria Plaza\\" shopping centre and of office space. Platforms 16 and 17 opened on the site of the former taxi rank on 21 December 1987.Around the Regions Rail issue 78 March 1988 page 44Victoria platform additions The Railway Magazine issue 1043 March 1988 page 144 A major re-signalling scheme was carried out during the works. The station was managed by Network SouthEast also under British Rail. Gatwick Express service at Victoria in 2003 The other major change to the station under BR was the gradual development of services to Gatwick Airport station after its opening on 28 May 1958. A dedicated rail-air terminal opened on top of platform 15 on 1 May 1962, designed by Clive Pascall.British United Airways' terminal Railway Gazette 1 December 1961 page 638 Several long-standing services from Victoria ended during the BR era. The Brighton Belle's final service was on 30 April 1972, followed by the last Golden Arrow on 30 September. The Night Ferry lasted until 31 October 1980, though the Venice- Simplon Orient Express, a luxury Pullman service, has been running intermittently since 1982. In 1984 the non-stop Gatwick Express service was started, aiming for a 30-minute journey time. This was coupled with the provision of an airport lounge and check-in facilities at first-floor level, with dedicated escalators down to the Gatwick Express platforms. British Airways and other major airlines had their own check-in desks there. British Rail operated an International Travel Centre within the main station, separate from the domestic travel centre. At the time, Victoria was still a major departure point for international travel, with boat trains to Dover and Folkestone for France and Belgium and beyond. This ceased with the introduction of Eurostar in 1994, which did not serve Victoria, and the International Travel Centre closed. Services With over 81 million passenger entries and exits in 2015/16, Victoria is the second-busiest station in London (and Great Britain) after Waterloo. Combined with the Underground Station and interchanges in the national rail station, London Victoria handled about 170 million passengers in 2015. Lines on the floor of the concourse leading to various facilities. A 360¬∞ sphere view of the station concourse To help passengers choose the correct service, the floor of the main concourse at Victoria was marked with different coloured lines. Passengers could then follow the line marked with the specific colour for that service to arrive at their intended departure point. Operationally, there continue to be two separate main line termini: * The eastern (Chatham) side, comprising platforms 1‚Äì8, is the terminus for Southeastern services to Kent on the Chatham Main Line and its branches. This is also the London terminus for the Venice-Simplon Orient Express, from Platform 2, the longest platform. It was used for boat trains to Dover and Folkestone until these were made redundant by the introduction of Eurostar trains to the continent in 1994. * The western (Brighton) side, comprising platforms 9‚Äì19, is the terminus for Southern and Gatwick Express services to Surrey and Sussex, including Gatwick Airport and Brighton on the Brighton Main Line and the East Grinstead branch on the Oxted Line. Services are operated by Southeastern and Southern, both owned by Govia. All services at Victoria use electric multiple unit trains. =Southeastern= Southeastern services at Victoria use platforms 1‚Äì8. The station is served by a mixture of metro and long distance (mainline) services. Metro services are operated using Class 465 and 466 EMUs whilst mainline services are operated using Class 375 and 377 EMUs. As of May 2020, the typical off-peak service run by Southeastern in trains per hour (tph) is: * 4 tph to of which 2 continue to (all stations) * 2 tph to via * 1 tph to via * 2 tph to via Chatham * 2 tph to via of which 1 continues to Southeastern also operate a single Monday-Friday morning service to Ashford International which calls additionally at and . =Southern= Southern services at Victoria use platforms 9-19 (as of May 2020). The station is served by a mixture of metro and long distance (mainline) services. Metro services are operated using Class 455 and 377 EMUs whilst mainline services are operated using Class 377s and 387s (from the Gatwick Express). As of May 2020, the typical off-peak service run by Southern in trains per hour (tph) is: * 2 tph to London Bridge via * 4 tph to Sutton via of which 2 continue to * 2 tph to West Croydon via Crystal Palace * 2 tph to via * 2 tph to of which 1 continues to * 2 tph to via * 2 tph to via * 2 tph to * 1 tph to and , dividing at Horsham * 1 tph to Bognor Regis and , dividing at Horsham * 2 tph to via * 2 tph to via of which 1 continues to Following the temporary suspension of Gatwick Express services in May 2020 (due to the Gatwick Airport Station Upgrade), Southern services at Victoria began to use Platforms 13 & 14 at the station and some Southern services are operated using the Class 387 units from the Gatwick Express. =Gatwick Express= Gatwick Express, formerly a separate franchise but now operated by Southern, ran services from platforms 13 and 14. Ticket barriers were installed on these platforms in 2011. Until May 2020, trains ran every 15 mins non-stop to with a half-hourly service continuing non-stop to . However, as of May 2020, Gatwick Express services have been temporarily suspended due to the upgrade works at Gatwick Airport station. Accidents and incidents On 26 February 1884, an explosion occurred in the cloak-room of the Brighton side injuring seven staff, as part of the Fenian dynamite campaign. On 27 August 1910, an empty LB&SCR; stock train derailed due to inadequate signalling arrangements, leading to four injuries. On 17 July 1946, a light engine collided with a passenger train; several people were injured. On 15 December 1959, a passenger train collided with a rake of parcels vans. At least eleven people were injured. On 8 September 1973, a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) bomb exploded at the ticket office in Victoria Station, London, injuring four people. On 18 February 1991, an IRA bomb exploded in a litter bin, killing David Corner, and injuring 38. A general bomb warning for all main- line stations had been received by telephone at 0700, but the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch chose not to close the stations. In 2009 a woman was found by a Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) acting suspiciously. When approached she produced a gun and pointed it at a passing young child. Unarmed PCSO George McNaught of the Metropolitan Police wrestled the gun out of the woman's hands before overpowering and detaining her. The woman was arrested and PCSO McNaught was awarded the commendation of the High Sheriff of Greater London for his brave actions. He is the first PCSO to receive the award. In March 2010, a youth was stabbed to death in Victoria Underground station, in front of numerous witnesses. Eight people were convicted of the killing in 2013. Three defendants were found guilty of murder and five were convicted of manslaughter. The former British ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer, claimed to have been attacked on a Tube platform at the station in July 2018. Two teenagers were arrested and then bailed by police. However a witness subsequently claimed that Sir Christopher was injured after accidentally falling over. On 8 May 2019, Class 377 electric multiple unit 377 142 collided with the buffer stop. On 22 March 2020, during the global COVID-19 pandemic, a ticket office worker, Belly Mujinga along with another female staff member, were repeatedly coughed and spat on by a man from the public, who claimed to have COVID-19. A few days later, both Mujinga and the fellow worker fell ill with the virus. Mujinga had underlying respiratory issues and was eventually admitted to Barnet General Hospital and put on a ventilator. She died on 5 April, aged 47, leaving her 11-year-old daughter and husband. The police interviewed a 57-year-old man, who tested negative for the virus. No further action was taken as it was discovered that the incident was not a cause of Mujinga's death, as well as senior detectives concluding that \\"there is no evidence to substantiate any criminal offences having taken place\\". London Underground station There are two connected Underground stations at Victoria, on different levels and built more than a century apart. The older one, on the north side of the bus station, serves the District and Circle lines, constructed by 'cut and cover' methods just below road level. The newer station, closer to the main line station, serves the Victoria line, a deep-level tube. Each has its own ticket hall, and the two are connected by a pedestrian passage beneath the bus station. Victoria is currently the station on the London Underground with million passengers using the station in . The station was not built for this number of passengers, which resulted in overcrowding requiring crowd control measures to be implemented at busy times. A ¬£700 million upgrade of the station was completed in 2018, which doubled the size of the existing station, as well as providing step-free access. =Circle and District lines= The first part of the station was opened on 24 December 1868 by the District Railway (DR, now the District line) when the company opened the first section of its line, between and . The DR connected to the Metropolitan Railway (MR, later the Metropolitan line) at South Kensington and, although the two companies were rivals, each company operated trains over the other's tracks in a joint service known as the \\"Inner Circle\\". The line was operated by steam locomotives, creating the necessity to leave periodic gaps open to the air. On 1 February 1872, the DR opened a northward branch from to the West London Extension Joint Railway (WLEJR, now the West London Line) at Addison Road (now Kensington (Olympia)). From that date the \\"Outer Circle\\" service began running over the DR. The service was run by the North London Railway (NLR) from Broad Street (now demolished) in the City of London via the North London Line to , then the West London Line to Addison Road and the DR to , the new eastern terminus of the DR. From 1 August 1872, the \\"Middle Circle\\" service also began operation through Victoria, from Moorgate along the MR on the north side of the Inner Circle to Paddington, then over the Hammersmith & City Railway (H&CR;) to Latimer Road and then to Mansion House. On 30 June 1900, the Middle Circle service was withdrawn between Earl's Court and Mansion House. On 31 December 1908 the Outer Circle service was also withdrawn. The original DR station was rebuilt at the beginning of the 20th century, initially as a single-storey structure. An office building was built above it later. The line was electrified in 1905. In 1949, the Inner Circle route was given its own identity on the tube map as the Circle line. =Victoria line= Plans for the route that eventually became the Victoria line date from the 1940s. A proposal for a new underground railway line linking north-east London with the centre was included in the County of London Plan in 1943. Between 1946 and 1954, a series of routes were proposed by different transport authorities to connect various places in south and north or north-east London. Each of these connected the three main-line termini at King's Cross, Euston and Victoria. A route was approved in 1955 with future extensions to be decided later, though funding for the construction was not approved by the government until 1962. As part of the construction of the Victoria line, a new ticket hall was constructed just outside the main railway building. From the ticket hall, a set of escalators led down to the new Victoria line, with a connecting passageway linking the new ticket hall to the District and Circle ticket hall and platforms. The Victoria line station opened on 7 March 1969, when the third phase of the line began operating, south of . Victoria was the terminus while the final phase was under construction to . This opened on 23 July 1971. =Station upgrade and expansion= TfL upgraded and expanded the station at a cost of ¬£700m between 2011 and 2018 to alleviate overcrowding and to provide step-free access. Work included expansion of the existing south \\"Victoria line\\" ticket hall, an additional entrance under Bressenden Place, renovation and expansion work throughout the existing station, and step-free access throughout. During the public inquiry into the station upgrade, the design of the project was criticised, as access to platforms from the new escalators was seen to be long and indirect compared to the direct access using the existing escalators. Construction began in 2011, and tunnelling for the project was completed in 2015 after complex work ‚Äì with tunnelling taking place just 60 cm from the existing District and Circle line tunnels. The first phase of the project opened in January 2017, with a new entrance leading to a new \\"North Ticket Hall\\" underneath Bressenden Place, linked to the Victoria line by new escalators and lifts. The upgrade was completed in October 2018, when the expanded south \\"Victoria line\\" ticket hall opened, as well as the completion of step-free access between all lines at the station. =Future= Victoria is a proposed stop on Crossrail 2, the route of which has been safeguarded since 1991. The project would involve the construction of two new long platforms, and new entrances onto Ebury Street and the main National Rail station. The District and Circle line ticket hall would be expanded and include a direct connection to the new Crossrail station. Crossrail 2 trains would also be able to reverse at Victoria. The service proposes to run 30 additional trains per hour through the station, which is expected to reduce crowding in Victoria by 25%. The Docklands Light Railway has also been proposed to be linked with Victoria. This would be a continuation of the line from via , with another branch to . As of 2020, these extensions of the DLR are not being progressed. Cultural references Victoria station is mentioned in Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest as the location where Jack Worthing was found by Thomas Cardew. In describing this to Lady Bracknell, Jack clarifies he was named because Cardew had a ticket to , and clarifies this as \\"the Brighton line\\". The station is mentioned in the Sherlock Holmes short story \\"The Final Problem\\", when Dr Watson catches a Continental Express train from Victoria to avoid Moriarty and his henchmen. The Harold Pinter short play Victoria Station has the station as the intended destination that the driver never reaches.

Animal setae =Invertebrates= Setae on the foreleg of a mayfly Annelid setae are stiff bristles present on the body. They help, for example, earthworms to attach to the surface and prevent backsliding during peristaltic motion. These hairs make it difficult to pull a worm straight from the ground. Setae in oligochaetes (a group including earthworms) are largely composed of chitin. They are classified according to the limb to which they are attached; for instance, notosetae are attached to notopodia; neurosetae to neuropodia. Crustaceans have mechano- and chemosensory setae. Setae are especially present on the mouthparts of crustaceans and can also be found on grooming limbs. In some cases, setae are modified into scale like structures. Setae on the legs of krill and other small crustaceans help them to gather phytoplankton. It captures them and allows them to be eaten. Setae on the integument of insects are unicellular, meaning that each is formed from a single epidermal cell of a type called a trichogen, literally meaning \\"bristle generator\\". They are at first hollow and in most forms remain hollow after they have hardened. They grow through and project through a secondary or accessory cell of a type called a tormogen, which generates the special flexible membrane that connects the base of the seta to the surrounding integument. Depending partly on their form and function, setae may be called hairs, macrotrichia, chaetae, or scales. The setal membrane is not cuticularized and movement is possible. Some insects, such as Eriogaster lanestris larvae, use setae as a defense mechanism, as they can cause dermatitis when they come into contact with skin. =Deuterostomes= In 2017, a description of a new species of basal Deuterostome was published. This animal appears to have seta in the pores along the side of its body. =Vertebrates= Close-up of the underside of a gecko's foot as it walks on vertical glass Common House Geckos, mating on a vertical glass window and showing lamellae under the feet The pads on a gecko's feet are small hair-like processes that play a role in the animal's ability to cling to vertical surfaces. The micrometer-scale setae branch into nanometer-scale projections called spatulae. * Gekko's seta: According to Kellar Autumn, \\"Two front feet of a tokay gecko (Gekko gecko) can withstand 20.1 N of force parallel to the surface with 227 mm2 of pad area (Irschick et al. 1996). The foot of a tokay bears approximately 3600 tetrads of setae per mm2, or 14,400 setae per mm2 (Schleich and Kastle 1986; pers- obs-)- Consequently, a single seta should produce an average force of 6-2 pN, and an average shear stress of 0-090 N mm‚àíl (0.9 atm). However, single setae proved both much less sticky and much more sticky than predicted by whole animal measurements, under varying experimental conditions, implying that attachment and detachment in gecko setae are mechanically controlled (Autumn et al. 2000).\\"Properties, Principles, and Parameters of the Gecko Adhesive System Fungal setae In mycology, \\"setae\\" refer to dark brown, thick-walled, thorn-like cystidia found in corticioid and poroid fungi in the family Hymenochaetaceae. Though mainly microscopic, the setae of some species may be sufficiently prominent to be visible with a hand lens. Plant setae In botany, \\"seta\\" refers to the stalk supporting the capsule of a moss or liverwort, and supplying it with nutrients. The seta is part of the sporophyte and has a short foot embedded in the gametophyte on which it is parasitic. Setae are not present in all mosses, but in some species they may reach 15 to 20 centimeters in height. (2005): Biology of Plants (7th ed.). W.H. Freeman and Company. Chaetoceros setae In the diatom family Chaetocerotaceae, \\"seta\\" refers to the hairlike outgrowths of the valve, i.e. of the face of the cells.Tomas, C. R., Hasle G. R., Syvertsen, E.

Mila 18 debuted at #7 on The New York Times Best Seller List (the second-highest debut of any Uris novel ever, bested only by the #6 debut of Trinity in 1976) and peaked at #2 in August 1961. Leon Uris's work, based on real events, covers the Nazi occupation of Poland and the atrocities of systematically dehumanising and eliminating the Jewish people of Poland. The name \\"Mila 18\\" is taken from the headquarters bunker of Jewish resistance fighters underneath the building at ulica Mi≈Ça 18 (18 Mila Street, in English, 18 Pleasant Street). (See Mi≈Ça 18.) The term ghetto takes on a clearer meaning as the courageous Jewish leaders fight a losing battle against not only the Nazis and their henchmen, but also profiteers and collaborators among themselves. Eventually, as the ghetto is reduced to rubble, a few courageous individuals with few weapons and no outside help assume command of ghetto defence, form a makeshift army and make a stand. Summary As in many other books by Uris, the story is largely told from the standpoint of a newspaperman; in this case, an American-Italian journalist, Christopher de Monti, who is assigned to Warsaw after covering the Spanish civil war. Although meant to be a dispassionate and neutral observer, he meets and becomes intimate with both the Nazi hierarchy and the Jews of Warsaw. He has a passionate affair with the wife of one of the Jewish community leaders, while also dealing with prostitutes provided by the Nazis. As the ghetto is surrounded and reduced to rubble, he throws in his lot with the gallant defenders. He is one of the few survivors and manages to escape with a young woman, Gabriela Rak, who is pregnant with the child of one of the defenders, Andrei Androfski, a former Polish army officer. =Characters= *Andrei Androfski is a Polish army Ulany Brigade officer, and a Jew. He is hot-headed and several other characters comment that he is best at leading cavalry charges - i.e. hopelessly fighting until the end. He remains in the ghetto after the fall of the bunker at Mila 18 and is presumed dead afterwards. *Gabriela Rak is Andrei Androfski's girlfriend, although they decide not to marry due to Andrei's Jewish descent. She worked at the American Embassy in Warsaw before the war and at the end of the book was carrying Andrei's child. *Christopher de Monti is a journalist of whose father is Italian and mother is American. While opposed to fascism and being determined to bring out the truth to the world, he does not aid the fighters on the ghetto until he is compelled to enter the ghetto by the Nazi propaganda officer in Poland. He is the only person to know the location of all the ghetto's diaries. *Alexander Brandel is one of the leaders of the uprising and the father of Wolf Brandel. He started a diary, which was later expanded to 24 volumes by members of the ghetto. Loosely based on Emanuel Ringelblum. *Wolf Brandel is the son of Alexander and one of the leaders of the uprising. He escapes the ghetto with a handful of survivors including his girlfriend Rachael Bronski. At the end of the book Christopher de Monti writes that Rachael and Wolf are off fighting in another Jewish resistance group. *Rachael Bronski is the daughter of Paul and Deborah Bronski and the girlfriend of Wolf Brandel. Along with being a talented musician and an excellent soldier she assists Wolf with the command of his part of the army. When the uprising comes to an end Rachael and Wolf escape with a few others out of the sewers and to safety. *Deborah Bronski is Christopher de Monti's lover and the wife of Paul Bronski. She is also the sister of Andrei Androfski. While Deborah does not feel any love for Paul, especially after he opposes the resistance in the ghetto, she refuses to leave him until he dies. Deborah has two children - Rachael and Stephan Bronski. *Paul Bronski is the husband of Deborah Bronski and, although a Jew, does not wish to be associated with other Jews in any way. He works at the Jewish Council and believes in cooperating with the Germans and opposing the Jewish resistance. He commits suicide eventually after not being able to cope with the pressure from both sides. Loosely based on Adam Czerniak√≥w. *Franz Koenig is an ethnic German living in Poland who receives higher and higher status after the Nazi invasion. As the war progresses, Koenig becomes more and more corrupted. He succeeds Paul Bronski in leading the Warsaw Medical Institute. Planned movie In August 2017, it was announced by film producer and Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein that he would produce a movie based on the novel, appointing himself as director. However, since the revelations of the producer's sexual misconduct against several women, his future in the business has been put into question.

The Tramp is also the title of a silent film starring Chaplin, which Chaplin wrote and directed in 1915. The Tramp, as portrayed by Chaplin, is a childlike, bumbling but generally good- hearted character who is most famously portrayed as a vagrant who endeavors to behave with the manners and dignity of a gentleman despite his actual social status. However, while he is ready to take what paying work is available, he also uses his cunning to get what he needs to survive and escape the authority figures who will not tolerate his antics. Chaplin's films did not always portray the Tramp as a vagrant, however. The character (\\"The little fellow,\\" as Chaplin called him) was rarely referred to by any names on-screen, although he was sometimes identified as \\"Charlie\\" and rarely, as in the original silent version of The Gold Rush, \\"The little funny tramp\\". History Mabel's Strange Predicament (1914), the first film produced in which Chaplin plays the Tramp Kid Auto Races at Venice was the first appearance of the Tramp released but actually the second film shot. Chaplin in 1916 The character of the Tramp was originally created by accident while Chaplin was working at Mack Sennett's Keystone Studios, when dressing up for the short film Mabel's Strange Predicament starring Mabel Normand and Chaplin. In a 1933 interview, Chaplin explained how he came up with the look of the Tramp: That was actually the first film featuring the Tramp but a different film, shot later but with the same character, happened to be released two days earlier. The Tramp debuted to the public in the Keystone comedy Kid Auto Races at Venice (released on 7 February 1914; Mabel's Strange Predicament, shot earlier, was released on 9 February 1914). Chaplin, with his Little Tramp character, quickly became the most popular star in Keystone director Mack Sennett's company of players. Chaplin continued to play the Tramp through dozens of short films and, later, feature-length productions. (In only a handful of other productions did he play characters other than the Tramp). The Tramp was closely identified with the silent era, and was considered an international character. When the sound era began in the late 1920s, Chaplin refused to make a talkie featuring the character, partly due to how the character was supposed to be American, and Chaplin himself had a strong and obvious English accent. The 1931 production City Lights featured no dialogue. Chaplin officially retired the character in the film Modern Times (released 5 February 1936), which appropriately ended with the Tramp walking down an endless highway toward the horizon. The film was only a partial talkie and is often called the last silent film. The Tramp remains silent until near the end of the film when, for the first time, his voice is finally heard, albeit only as part of a French/Italian-derived gibberish song. This allowed the Tramp to finally be given a voice but not tarnish his association with the silent era. In The Great Dictator, Chaplin's first film after Modern Times, Chaplin plays the dual role of a Hitler-esque dictator, and a Jewish barber. Although Chaplin emphatically stated that the barber was not the Tramp, he retains the Tramp's moustache, hat, and general appearance. Despite a few silent scenes, including one where the barber is wearing the Tramp's coat and bowler hat and carrying his cane, the barber speaks throughout the film (using Chaplin's own English accent), including the passionate plea for peace that has been widely interpreted as Chaplin speaking as himself. In 1959, having been editing The Chaplin Revue, Chaplin commented to a reporter (regarding the Tramp character) \\"I was wrong to kill him. There was room for the Little Man in the atomic age.\\" A vaudeville performer named Lew Bloom created a similar tramp character which inspired Chaplin. According to Bloom, he was \\"the first stage tramp in the business\\". In an interview with the Daily Herald in 1957 Chaplin recalled being inspired by the tramp characters Weary Willie and Tired Tim from Illustrated Chips.  Characteristics  The Tramp on the road. The physical attributes of the Tramp include a pair of baggy pants, a tight coat, a small bowler hat, a large pair of shoes, a springy and flexible cane and a toothbrush moustache. The Tramp walks strangely and uncomfortably because of the ill-fitting clothing; either he is wearing secondhand clothes, or they are originally his but he cannot afford new ones. The Tramp may have seen better days, but he maintains the attitude and demeanor of a high-class individual; as long as he acts like one he can believe that he is one, and is able to keep his hope that some day he actually will be again. Two films made in 1915, The Tramp and The Bank, created the characteristics of Chaplin's screen persona. While in the end the Tramp manages to shake off his disappointment and resume his carefree ways, the pathos lies in the Tramp's having a hope for a more permanent transformation through love, and his failure to achieve this. The Tramp was usually the victim of circumstance and coincidence, but sometimes the results worked in his favour. In Modern Times, he picks up a red flag that falls off a truck and starts to wave it at the truck in an attempt to return it, and by doing so, unknowingly and inadvertently becomes the leader of a group of protesting workers, and ends up in jail because of it. While in jail he accidentally eats \\"nose powder\\" (i.e., cocaine), which causes him to not return to his jail cell; but when he eventually does, he fights off some jailbreakers attempting to escape, thus saving the life of the warden. Because of this, the warden offers to let him go, but the Tramp would rather stay in jail because it is better than the outside world. Significance A Dog's Life (1918) Chaplin's social commentary, while critical of the faults and excesses created by industrialization, also shows support for and belief in the \\"American Dream.\\" In Modern Times, Chaplin creates a \\"portrayal consistent with popular leftist stereotypes of wealthy leaders and oppressed workers in the 1930s.\\" While the Tramp and his fellow workers sweat on the assembly line, the president of the Electro Steel Company works on a puzzle and reads comic strips in the newspaper. The obsession of working with efficiency and assembly-line productivity ultimately drives the Tramp mad. This could be seen as \\"an attack on the capitalist rationalization of production.\\" However, \\"the film also guardedly affirms American middle-class, particularly its optimism.\\" For example, one sequence depicts the Tramp's dream in which he and the gamine live a traditional middle-class lifestyle. The Tramp and the gamine find a rundown shack to live in. The gamine cooks a cheap breakfast, and then the Tramp is off to work, while the gamine stays to maintain the home‚Äîan allusion to a middle-class setting. By the ending of Modern Times, \\"the film seems tailored to please the middle-class optimist.\\" Due to all of their failings the final scene had the gamine stating, \\"What's the use of trying?\\", and the Tramp replying \\"Buck up‚Äînever say die.\\" In his silent films, Chaplin uniquely deployed critical social commentary. \\"What makes Modern Times decidedly different from Chaplin's previous three films are the political references and social realism that keep intruding into Charlie's world.\\" \\"No comedian before or after him has spent more energy depicting people in their working lives.\\" \\"Though there had been films depicting the lives of immigrants and urban workers, no filmmaker before Chaplin had created their experience so humanly and lovingly.\\" Chaplin used not one but two similar-looking characters to the Tramp in The Great Dictator (released 15 October 1940); however, this was an all-talking film (Chaplin's first). The film was inspired by the noted similarity between Chaplin's Tramp (most notably his small moustache) and that of German dictator Adolf Hitler. Chaplin used this similarity to create a dark version of the Tramp character in parody of the dictator. (In his book My Autobiography, Chaplin stated that he was unaware of the Holocaust when he made the film; if he had been, he writes, he wouldn't have been able to make a comedy satirizing Hitler). In his autobiography, Chaplin identifies the barber as the Tramp. A noticeable difference is that the barber has a streak of grey in his hair, whereas the Tramp had always been depicted as having dark hair. Also, the barber lacks the ill-fitting clothes of the Tramp, and is clearly portrayed as having a profession. His character does share much of The Tramp's character, notably his idealism and anger on seeing unfairness. List of films featuring The Tramp 25 of the 36 films Chaplin did at Keystone feature him as the Tramp character. 13 of the 15 films Chaplin did at Essanay feature him as the Tramp character, though some may feel Triple Trouble shouldn't be counted. 10 of the 12 films Chaplin did at Mutual feature him as the Tramp character. 8 of the 9 films Chaplin did at First National feature him as the Tramp character. 4 or 5 (Depending on if The Great Dictator is included) of the 8 films Chaplin did at United Artists feature him as the Tramp character. #Kid Auto Races at Venice (1914) #Mabel's Strange Predicament (1914) #Between Showers (1914) ##Chaplin co-leads the film #A Film Johnnie (1914) #His Favourite Pastime (1914) #The Star Boarder (1914) #Twenty Minutes of Love (1914) #Caught in a Cabaret (1914) #Caught in the Rain (1914) #The Fatal Mallet (1914) #Mabel's Married Life (1914) ##The Tramp wears a top hat instead of a bowler. #Laughing Gas (1914) #The Property Man (1914) ##The Tramp wears no jacket #The Face on the Bar Room Floor (1914) #Recreation (1914) #The Masquerader (1914) #His New Profession (1914) #The New Janitor (1914) #Those Love Pangs (1914) #Dough and Dynamite (1914) #Gentlemen of Nerve (1914) #His Musical Career (1914) #His Trysting Place (1914) #Getting Acquainted (1914) #His Prehistoric Past (1914) #His New Job (1915) #A Night Out (1915) #The Champion (1915) #In the Park (1915) #A Jitney Elopement (1915) #The Tramp (1915) #By the Sea (1915) #Work (1915) #A Woman (1915) #The Bank (1915) #Shanghaied (1915) #The Floorwalker (1916) #Police (1916) #The Fireman (1916) ##Chaplin doesn't wear the Tramp's clothes, but wears oversized clothes and acts similarly to the character. #The Vagabond (1916) #The Count (1916) #The Pawnshop (1916) #Behind the Screen (1916) #The Rink (1916) #Easy Street (1917) #The Immigrant (1917) #The Adventurer (1917) ##A tuxedo version of the Tramp costume is worn #A Dog's Life (1918) #Triple Trouble (1918) ##The film was made from unused footage of Chaplin, but released by Essanay.

Most notably, the character wears different clothes. By extension of this, every Chaplin film is considered by some to be a Tramp film, though this is apparently apocryphal. The Knockout and The Cure especially are also considered by many to be Tramp films. A Dog's Life, Shoulder Arms, and The Pilgrim were edited together to form The Chaplin Revue.  Impersonations  In the 1910s, due to the desire for more Chaplin films than Chaplin could make, many created their own character like The Tramp or even just played the Tramp. This has continued, though to a much lesser degree, after the 1910s due to people admiring Chaplin. Some films have been animated and obviously don't need an actor to play the character, who is portrayed as mute.

He represented the U.S. state of Nebraska in the U.S. Senate and served as U.S. Secretary of the Interior during Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration.  Early life  Seaton was born in Washington, D.C. on December 11, 1909, the son of Dorothea Elizabeth (n√©e Schmidt) and Fay Noble Seaton. He attended the Manhattan High School in Manhattan, Kansas. He graduated from Kansas State University in 1931, and married Gladys Hope Dowd (November 5, 1910 - January 5, 1999) in the same year. They had four children: Donald Richard, Alfred Noble, Johanna Christine, and Monica Margaret Seaton. In 1937, Seaton moved to Hastings, Nebraska, where he was for many years the publisher of the Hastings Tribune.  Political career  Seaton was active in Republican politics. He served in the unicameral Nebraska Legislature from 1945 to 1949. He was appointed to the U.S. Senate on December 10, 1951, by Gov. Val Peterson to fill the vacancy created by the death of Kenneth S. Wherry. A Rockefeller Republican, Seaton was senator for less than a year; he had to vacate the post on November 4, 1952, when Dwight Griswold won the 1952 special election to complete the Senate term.

Wen was the last member of the Zhou dynasty who claimed the throne of China, though he was never recognized as king outside his own small domain at Chengzhou. Forced to spend his entire reign fighting against the state of Qin, Wen's death meant the final end of the Zhou dynasty.  Biography  Jƒ´ Ji√© was born into the large royal Jƒ´ family that ruled China since 1046 BC, though by his time the dynasty had become effectively powerless. Their remaining crown land was embroiled in infighting and succession disputes, so that it was split into two factions, led by rival nobles: Western Zhou and Eastern Zhou. Ji√©, as Duke Wen, ruled over the East from Chengzhou, and largely ignored the authority of King Nan of Zhou who resided in Wangcheng and was supported by the western nobles. In 256 BC, however, war broke out between West Zhou under Nan and the state of Qin under King Zhaoxiang of Qin. Qin annexed the West, deposed King Nan and forcibly ended the Zhou dynasty. Many citizens and members of the royal family then fled to East Zhou, where they proclaimed Wen as the King of China (Son of Heaven) in 255 BC. Allied with Ji Zhao, son of King Nan, Wen organized a resistance against Qin, and managed to preserve the last Zhou holdouts for six years. Ji Zhao's forces were defeated in 251 BC, and two years later the army of Qin took Chengzhou. Wen was executed, and the city given to L√º Buwei for his services to King Zhuangxiang of Qin.

The primary source of anti-Jewish violence is the perennial obsession with converting the Jews to Christianity; an event which some theologians believed would usher in the Second Coming. Description Carroll disclaims the notion that Christian anti-Judaism leads inevitably to the Holocaust committed by Nazi Germany, but he argues that Church's long history of \\"Jew-hatred\\" laid the foundation for Hitler's crimes. Carroll also points out the many \\"turning points,\\" as he labels them, where the Church's attitudes and actions toward Jews could have been shifted. Just one example cited in the book is that of Pierre Abelard (1079‚Äì1142), the French theologian and philosopher, whose teachings, had they been accepted, would have radically changed the direction and cast of Christian dogma. The book also analyzes, in detail, the actions of numerous popes and other prominent figures of Catholic Church history, especially those who advocated anti-Jewish policies and those who tried to rein in official antisemitism, including St. Augustine, Bernard of Clairvaux, Nicholas of Cusa, Innocent III, Paul IV, Pius IX, Pius XII, John XXIII, and John Paul II. The book's title refers to Constantine's transformation of the cross, which Carroll claims, was not a symbol used by Christians in the first three centuries of the Church's existence, into a symbolic sword infusing a spirit of violent intolerance into the development of Christianity. The claim by Carroll might be false as the first historic evidence for the cross being a symbol used by Christians and depicted in Christian art is dated to be end of second or beginning of third century, about 100 years before Constantine I Christian cross#Early Christian usage. A documentary film based on the book was shown at film festivals in August 2007. Although exploring the same themes as the book, the documentary also focuses on events which occurred subsequent to the book's publication, especially the controversy surrounding evangelical proselytizing at the United States Air Force Academy. The movie was directed by Oren Jacoby, who is also listed as a producer, and written by James Carroll and Oren Jacoby. It was released by the production company, Storyville Films.

Hart Stores Inc. is a mid-sized value-driven department store in Eastern Canada. It was founded in 1960 by Harry Hart, in Rosem√®re, Quebec. Hart stores is based in the provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, and Ontario. The head office used to be in the Montreal borough of Anjou but moved to Laval, Quebec, a northern suburb of Montreal, in early 2006. The company operates 60 stores across Canada, branded as Hart, primarily in smaller and suburban markets. Before running into financial difficulties in 2011, the chain had 92 stores under the Hart and Bargain Giant banners, extending as far east as Newfoundland. The average store is approximately . The company positions itself within the market as a niche marketer. The target customer is low-to-average income consumers. Hart's pricing strategy is to implement everyday low prices and a high/low strategy. The company does not emphasize a private label within their stores. Hartco The Hart clothing retail operation was one of several diverse retail and inside-sales businesses that operated under the Hart family umbrella. Computer retail and corporate IT services fell under their Hartco brands (managed independently from Hart Stores), included Metafore, Northwest Digital, CompuSmart, MicroAge and their original Compucentre chain of stores. The Telephone Booth/Cabine T√©l√©phonique, a chain of stores that sells wired, cordless and cellular phones, was operated by Hartco until its purchase by Glentel. During the annual shareholders meeting held on June 15, 2000, the shareholders approved a plan of arrangement to distribute its wholly owned subsidiaries of computer and IT services to the company's common shareholders. The arrangement resulted in the formation of a separate publicly traded company operating under Hartco Inc. (). The department store division operated as Hart Stores and was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. From a historic level of losses, before the plan of arrangement, the company began to report sustained and consistent profits under new leadership. In fiscal 2006 the company reported net profits of $7.0 million. Bankruptcy reorganisation In August 2011, Hart Stores company had run into financial difficulties, and was granted bankruptcy protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act in Canadian law. The court appointed receiver was RSM Richter Inc., also in August 2011. the Company announced the return of Robert Farah as Chief Operating Officer. In October 2011, Hart Stores announced the liquidation of 32 stores of the company's 92 Canadian stores and appointed Tiger Capital Group LLC as the liquidator to conduct the liquidation sales at the 32 closing stores. Hart filed its bankruptcy through the Quebec Superior Court (Commercial Division) in the District of Montreal. The court-appointed monitor of this case was granted to Richter Advisory Group Inc. Eight of the former Newfoundland Bargain Giant locations were converted in 2012 to Rossy stores. Private acquisition In 2015, Hart Stores were bought by Mr. Paul Nassar who became the new President of the Company.

The novel is loosely based on a court case for defamation (Dering v Uris) that arose from Uris's earlier best-selling novel Exodus. Title \\"QB VII\\" is an abbreviation of Queen's Bench Courtroom Number Seven. Plot A famous author, Abraham Cady, stands trial for libel. In his book The Holocaust, he named eminent surgeon Sir Adam Kelno as one of the Jadwiga concentration camp's most sadistic inmate/doctors. Cady wrote the book after discovering the Jadwiga concentration camp was the site of his family's extermination. Kelno has denied his involvement in sadistic practices, and asserts he worked hard to save prisoners, at great personal risk. Furious at his depiction by Cady, Kelno brings libel charges against him. In the end, Kelno wins his case but is awarded one half-penny, the smallest coin of the realm, because his past actions were found to have been so bad that the minor inaccuracies in the book could not have damaged his reputation further.

PWCs have two style categories, first and most popular being a runabout or \\"sit down\\" where the rider uses the watercraft mainly sitting down, and the watercraft typically holds two or more people. The second style is a \\"stand-up\\", where the rider uses the watercraft standing up. The stand-up styles are built for one rider and are used more for doing tricks, racing, and use in competitions. Both styles have an inboard engine driving a pump-jet that has a screw-shaped impeller to create thrust for propulsion and steering. Most are designed for two or three people, though four-passenger models exist. Many of today's models are built for more extended use and have the fuel capacity to make long cruises, in some cases even beyond 100 miles (161 km). Personal watercraft are often referred by the trademarked brand names Jet Ski (referring to personal watercraft manufactured by Kawasaki), WaveRunner (referring to personal watercraft manufactured by Yamaha), or Sea-Doo (referring to personal watercraft manufactured by Bombardier). The United States Coast Guard defines a personal watercraft, amongst other criteria, as a jet-drive boat, less than 13 feet (4 m) in length, in order to exclude from that definition more conventional-sized jet-boats.US Coast Guard \\"Annual Boating Statistics, 2006\\". uscgboating.org There is a wide variety of \\"jetboats\\" many of which exceed 30‚Äì40 feet (9‚Äì12 m) in length. History Vincent Amanda at the London Motorcycle Museum The first stand-up prototype Water scooters‚Äîas they were originally termed‚Äîwere first developed in the United Kingdom and Europe in the mid-1950s, with models such as the British 200cc propellor-driven Vincent Amanda, and the German Wave Roller.archive.wmlnj.org/var/www/TheWestfieldLeader/1956/1956-10-04/pg_0018.pdf.books.google.com/books?id=iSUDAAAAMBAJ&pg;=PA98&lpg;=PA98. Two thousand Vincent Amandas were exported to Australia, Asia, Europe and the United States.www.voc.uk.com/net/docs/17/17-553-14.pdf . In the 1960s, the idea was developed further by Clayton Jacobson II of Lake Havasu City, Arizona, USA. Originally a motocross enthusiast, Jacobson's idea was designed in the mid-1960s, powered by an internal pump-jet rather than an outboard motor, made of all aluminum, and had a fixed, upright handle. Jacobson eventually quit his job in banking to devote himself to developing the idea, and had a working prototype by 1965. It differed slightly from modern personal watercraft but had definite similarities. He completed a second prototype a year later made of fiberglass. The first Clayton-type PWC to reach the market was designed by Bombardier in the late 1960s. Bombardier's original designs were not very popular and Bombardier left the business before 1970. Stand-up PWCs were first produced by the Japanese company Kawasaki (under the Jet Ski brand) in 1972,http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/13/world/gallery/japanese- inventions-changed-how-we-live/index.html and appeared on the US market in 1973. These were mass-produced boats to be used by only one rider. While they are still produced today, the more popular design, is the sit down variety of PWC. These sit down runabouts have been produced by Kawasaki (Jetski), Bombardier (Sea-Doo), Yamaha (WaveRunner), Honda (AquaTrax), Polaris (Sealion) and Arctic Cat (Tigershark). As of 2010, the major manufacturers of PWCs were Kawasaki, Bombardier and Yamaha. Both Yamaha and Kawasaki continue to sell stand-up models but it is a small percentage of the overall market.  Sports  Stand-up PWC racing scene. (Tyson Collins pictured) PWC racing competitions take place around the world. P1 AquaX is a personal watercraft racing series, first launched in the UK in May 2011 by London-based sports promoter Powerboat P1. The series attracted a mix of new and current racers to a new type of racing and in 2013, P1 rolled out a second series in the USA. Such was the uptake that the original format needed revising to cope with the influx of new riders and by the end of 2015 over 400 riders from 11 countries had registered to compete in an AquaX event.  Non-recreational uses  PWC with rescue platform. Training preparedness Rescue Water Craft Italian police in Venice PWCs are small, fast, easily handled, fairly easy to use, affordable, and their propulsion systems do not have external propellers, making them safer for swimmers and wildlife. For these reasons, they are preferred for non- recreational use over small motorboats. PWCs are used for Jet Ski fishing or PWC fishing and is the fastest growing segments in the industry. They are fast, safe and economical and are being chosen over traditional boats. Lifeguards use PWCs equipped with rescue platforms to rescue water users who get into difficulties and carry them back to shore. Rescuers use PWCs to pick up flood survivors. PWCs are used for law enforcement. Due to their speed and excellent maneuverability, police and rangers use them to enforce laws in coastal waters, lakes and rivers. A PWC combined with a wash-reduction system, carrying waterproof loudspeaker equipment and GPS for instructions and distance measurement, has purportedly been used by assistant coaches for rowing sports on the River Tyne. PWCs are used by the U.S. Navy as surface targets. Equipped with GPS, electronic compass, radar reflector, and a radio modem, the PWC is fully remotable with a two-way link. Its small shipboard footprint allows it to be stored and deployed from the smallest of vessels, and it has been used for target practice for everything from to small arms.  Emissions  engines, reach speeds of up to , carry of fuel, and feature amenities such as sun pads and extra padded cruising seats. The American PWC industry reached an agreement with the United States Coast Guard in 1999 (see fall, 1999 BSAC Minutes), agreeing to limit the speed of a PWC to 65 mph in a specified test protocol. Before 1991, PWC emissions were unregulated in the United States. Many were powered by two-stroke cycle engines, which are smaller and lighter than four-stroke cycle engines but more polluting. Simple two-stroke engines are lubricated on a \\"total loss\\" method, mixing lubricating oil with their fuel; they are estimated to create exhaust in excess of 25% of their fuel and oil unburned in addition to the products of incomplete and complete combustion. The 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act allowed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to begin regulating all recreational marine engines including PWC, as well as other off-road internal combustion engines. The agency began a dialogue with manufacturers in 1991, resulting in regulations that were enacted in 1996. These regulations, set to phase in between 1998 and 2006, are considered averaging standards, because they allow manufacturers to offset more-polluting engines in their product range by offering other engines that exceed the standard. California and subsequently New York have, in turn, adopted more stringent regulations than the federal standard. Subsequent to 2004 when the maximum emission reductions required by California became effective, the substantial majority of new PWC units sold throughout the United States have met the lower emissions standards established by California. Sea-Doo LRV, can be easily loaded onto a trailer and transported from one body of water to another. To meet these regulations, manufacturers have adopted a variety of improvements, including increased use of four-stroke engines, the use of direct injection for two- strokes, and the use of catalytic converters and other pollution-curbing measures that overall have reduced emissions by approximately 75% compared to pre-regulation models. In some areas, such as Lake Tahoe, outboard motors and PWCs are permitted if they meet the 2006 EPA or California Air Resources Board (CARB) 2001 regulations. Some pre-2006 model year PWCs meet this EPA standard, including all four-stroke makes and models and all two-stroke cycle direct- injection (non-carbureted) models. Lake Tahoe Watercraft Environmental groups such as the Surfrider Foundation and the Bluewater Network claim that more rapid progress could be made, and that the diminishing numbers of pre-1998 watercraft in use continue to emit substantial pollution. Against this, industry groups such as the Personal Watercraft Industry Association point out that environmental groups continue to cite pollution levels of pre-regulation watercraft and ignore the improvements made to newer models; and furthermore, that personal watercraft are unfairly singled out when they are no more polluting than other powered boats. Hazards PWC warning label indicating risk of body cavity injuries Apart from the obvious hazards of collisions and mechanical breakdowns common to all vehicles, operating or riding a PWC can involve a risk of orifice injuries.Jim Stingl, \\"Have fun on your watercraft, butt beware,\\" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 28 June 2000, 1.Roy Scott Hickman and Michael M. Sampsel, Boat Accident Reconstruction and Litigation (Tucson: Lawyers & Judges Publishing Company, 2003), 78. These injuries are typical of the kinds of injuries that waterskiers experience as a result of falling into the water at speed.See Romano RL. Burgess EM. Medical Implications of Water- skiing, Clin Orthop, 22: 140-145 (1962).; David Pfanner, Salpingitis and Water Skiing FRCS The Medical Journal of Australia, 2/1964.; Moore A. T.: Water- skiing in Symposium on Injury in sport. Edited by Armstrong JR, Tucker WE; London Staples, 1964; McCarthy GF. Hazards of water-skiing. Med J Aust. 1969; 1:481;David C. Morton, Gynecological Complications of Water Skiing M.R.C.O.G. Gosford District Hospital, New South Wales Medical Journal of Australia, June 20, 1970. The first waterski reports of this kind of injury appeared in the early 1960s and continue today. Prior to that time there were no reported injuries of this type. Similar reports of this kind of injury have occurred at water slide parks and other similar facilities. Once again, the occurrence rate for this kind of injury appears to be very low. Such injuries can occur from simply falling in the water at speed or they can occur from the output end of the pump jet. A rider who falls (or is ejected) off the back can land directly in the path of the PWC's high-pressure jet of water. Unless a rider is appropriately dressed in garments made out of a strong, thick substance like neoprene (as is commonly found in wetsuits), the jet may penetrate any orifice it reaches. All major PWC manufacturers warn about this risk and recommend that passengers wear wet suit bottoms or equivalent protection. The American Waterski Racing Association recommends that all of their racers wear wet suit bottoms for this same reason. Such orifice injuries can result in permanent disability or death.Bernard Descottes, Fouzi Lachachi, Issifou Moumouni, Sylvaine Durand-Fontanier, and Ramy Geballa, \\"Case Report: Rectal Injury Caused by Personal Watercraft Accident,\\" Diseases of the Colon and Rectum 46, no. 7 (June 2003): 971-972. The 16-year-old patient described in this case report was deceased. The autopsy revealed that the primary cause of death was toxic shock syndrome caused by the rectal tear.David P. Parsons, Harry A. Kahn, John T. Isler and Richard P. Billingham, \\"Case Report: Rectal Injury Caused by Personal Watercraft Accident,\\" Diseases of the Colon and Rectum 42, no. 7 (July 1999): 959-960. The patient described in this case report survived. For example, in 2006, the California Court of Appeal for the First Appellate District upheld a $3.7 million Napa County jury verdict against Polaris Industries arising out of one such incident (which had devastating effects on the victim's lower abdomen).Ford v. Polaris Industries, Inc., 139 Cal. App. 4th 755, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 215 (2006). The plaintiff survived due to the heroic efforts of UC Davis Medical Center personnel (the court noted that she required \\"massive resuscitation\\") but was permanently disabled by her injuries; for example, she has no bowel control. It is also possible for multiple riders on the same PWC to sustain orifice injuries in a single accident, as actually occurred in a 2007 accident at Mission Bay which resulted in a San Diego County jury verdict affirmed in full on appeal in 2014.Colombo v. BRP US Inc., 230 Cal. App. 4th 1442; 179 Cal. Rptr. 3d 580 (2014). As the appellate court explained in its opinion, this case was delayed after the PWC owner initiated a proceeding in federal court under the Limitation of Liability Act of 1851. While also rare, spinal injuries can occur while surf jumping and, potentially, wake jumping.Am Surg. 2002 Jul;68(7):624-7.Pattern of injury from personal watercraft. Haan JM, Kramer ME, Scalea TM; J Trauma. 2004 Dec;57(6):1308-10.Thoracolumbar fractures associated with the use of personal watercraft.Carmel A, Drescher MJ, Leitner Y, Gepstein R. The PWC manufacturers owner's manuals all include warnings regarding jumping at excessive heights, or operating a PWC if there is a prior history of back injury. The current on-product labels say \\"Jumping wakes or waves can increase the risk of spinal/backbone injuries (paralysis)\\".2001 Joint USCG/Industry Label Project, Injury Control and Safety Promotion, 2001, Vol. 8, No. 2, pp71-81; Labeling for Personal Watercraft. The current Kawasaki owner's manual provides: \\"Slow down before crossing waves. Do not ride if you have a back condition. High speed operation in choppy or rough water may cause back injuries.\\"JT1100-G1 Owner's Manual, page 53-54 Another rare, but unique injury risk with jetboats, is being sucked into the intake side of the pump jet. Current PWC products contain on-product warnings that state: \\"Keep away from Intake Grate while the engine is on. Items such as long hair, loose clothing, or PFD straps can become entangled in moving parts and result in severe injury or drowning\\".2001 Joint USCG/Industry Label Project, Injury Control and Safety Promotion, 2001, Vol. 8, No. 2, pp71-81; Labeling for Personal Watercraft There have been fatal accidents involving PWCs. In a notable case, U.S. astronaut Alan G. Poindexter died in 2012 from injuries sustained in a Jet Ski accident in Florida.

It is home to HMS Excellent, the oldest shore training establishment within the Royal Navy, and the location of the Navy Command Headquarters. The island is linked to Portsea Island and thence to the mainland by road bridges. Early history Ordnance Survey maps of Portsmouth Harbour from 1862 show Whale Island as a narrow strip: its east-to-west dimensions were similar to present times, but north to south it measured only tens of yards. To its northwest was Little Whale Island.Maps, documents and photographs on display in the Quarterdeck building, HMS Excellent. Modern Whale Island is predominantly reclaimed land, using the deposits dredged from Portsmouth harbour during the 19th century, increasing the land area by about 125%. It was constructed with the help of the many prisoners taken in Napoleonic Wars. Expansion During 1867 a viaduct was constructed from the north wall of the dockyard to the south-east cornerMap showing the route of the viaduct. of Big Whale Island which allowed spoil to be moved from dredging the docks (part of the expansion of HMNB Portsmouth), reclaiming the land between Big Whale Island and Little Whale Island, forming the basis of the island as it is today. The railway which ran on the viaduct was extended around the island to help with the distribution of the spoil and much of the track is still present today, buried under the roads. Manual construction work was mostly undertaken by convicts; a favourable assignment because of the extra food. By 1885 the island had five rifle ranges, but three of these were soon decommissioned to make room for the Gun Drill Battery and Drill Ground (today this is the Summer Parade Ground). Whale Island seen from the air Photos on display in Whale Island Quarterdeck (constructed 1888) show that a footbridge to Stamshaw, Portsea Island, was added sometime before 1898 (incorporating a swing-bridge). A small road-bridge now joins the islands at the same point. Before World War II Whale Island was home to a zoo which gave a home to several animals presented to British representatives by friendly countries. Ceremony The gun carriage that carries the coffin in British state funerals is maintained on Whale Island.

The term is often used generically to refer to any type of personal watercraft used mainly for recreation, and it is also used as a verb to describe the use of any type of PWC. A runabout style PWC typically carries 1‚Äì3 people seated in a configuration like a typical bicycle or motorcycle.  Kawasaki Jet Ski  \\"Jet Ski\\" is a proper noun and registered trademark of Kawasaki. The stand-up Kawasaki Jet Ski was the first \\"commercially successful\\" personal watercraft in America, having been released in 1972 (after reaching a license agreement with the inventor of the Sea-doo, Clayton Jacobson II when his license agreement with Bombardier expired). The Kawasaki Jet Ski was the only commercial successful PWC for almost 16 years, from the introduction of the WSAA in October 1972 through the re-introduction of the sit-down, runabout style Bombardier Sea-Doo in 1988. The first stand-up prototype With the introduction of the Jet Ski, Kawasaki, in cooperation with aftermarket companies and enthusiasts, helped in creating the United States Jet Ski Boating Association (USJSBA). In 1982 the name was changed to the International Jet Sports Boating Association (IJSBA). At the start, only JS440 stand-ups were raced. After Kawasaki introduced the runabout style X2 in 1986 it gained its own class, later to be renamed the \\"Sport Class\\". Stand-up model history =1972‚Äì1976= Kawasaki introduces the first production stand-up PWC in October 1972. The WSAA and follow-on WSAB were powered by modified 400cc 2-stroke twin cylinder engines. The WSAA was designed with a flat hull and the WSAB came with a concave design. The design concepts distinctive of these original craft were a fully enclosed impeller for safety and self-righting, self-circling features. Without a lanyard the self circling allowed the rider to swim back to the idling craft after falling off. Kawasaki called them \\"Water Jet\\" and \\"Power Skis\\" before they settled on the name \\"Jet Ski\\". =1976‚Äì1982= The 1976 JS400 was popular among thrill seeking recreational riders and racers. The 1977 JS440 offered more power and performance. It was one of Kawasaki's longest selling models. In 1982, Kawasaki responded to market demand for more performance with the JS550. The 550 featured a newly designed high capacity mixed flow pump driven by more powerful 531cc engine. The 550 introduced an automatic rev limiter to prevent engine damage when the pump cavitates. =1982‚Äì1986= Kawasaki continued to improve the JS550 well into the 1990s. In 1986, Kawasaki added the JS300 to their model line-up, a single cylinder 294cc two-stroke engine featuring automatic fuel /oil mixing. They also added the 650 X2, their first \\"sit-down\\" Jet Ski, and originator of the Sport Class for PWC racing. =1987‚Äì1992= Kawasaki introduces the completely redesigned JS650SX. It featured an even higher capacity axial flow pump and a powerful 635cc two-stroke twin engine in a modified V-hull design for increased maneuverability and stability. In 1992, the company introduced a stand-up JS750-A. The engine was a twin cylinder 743cc two-stroke with reed valves and automatic oil injection. The redesigned hull was lighter weight and more maneuverable. The 750 introduced underwater exhaust for quieter operation to the stand-up kawasaki. =1995= The 750 SXi (JS750-B) is introduced, and became the first stand-up Jet Ski with dual carburetors. =1998= Kawasaki releases a commemorative edition JS550-C. The high performance JS750-C is released featuring a lower center of gravity due to its hand-laminated fiberglass hull. =2003= Kawasaki introduces the SX-R 800 (JS800A), which increased displacement to 781cc, in the form of an in-line twin 2-stroke engine generating 80hp. The SX-R also moved to a fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP) hull and top deck. =2011= Due to US EPA restrictions, Kawasaki releases their final two-stroke stand-up, and the last year of the JS800 SX-R, to recognize the 37-year history of the stand-up JetSki. The model designation was JS800ABF, with an MSRP of $7899.00. =2017= On October 6, 2016 Kawasaki reintroduced the stand-up Jet Ski. The 8 ft. 9 in., 550+ lb. SX-R 1500 shared little with its predecessors. Powered by a 160HP inline 4-cylinder four-stroke engine, the SX-R was described by one author as \\"on steroids\\" and having \\"lost some of the playfulness of early standup models\\". It holds 6.1 gallons of fuel, measures 104.5\\" long, 30.1\\" wide and 33.1\\" high. Models Kawasaki produced various models of the Jet Ski starting in 1972, beginning with the JS400 and leading up to the current JS1500. =2003 JS800A= The 800 SX-R was introduced for the 2003 model year, and remained unchanged until it was discontinued in 2011.

Polaris was founded in Roseau, Minnesota, USA, where it still has engineering and manufacturing. The company's corporate headquarters is in Medina, Minnesota. The company manufactured motorcycles through its Victory Motorcycles subsidiary until January 2017, and currently produces motorcycles through the Indian Motorcycle subsidiary, which it purchased in April 2011. Polaris produced personal watercraft from 1994‚Äì2004. The company was originally named Polaris Industries Inc. and was renamed in 2019 to Polaris Inc. Robin (a subsidiary of Subaru Corporation) previously developed and supplied all-terrain vehicle (ATV) and snowmobile engines for Polaris Inc. Starting in 1995 with the Polaris Magnum 425 4-stroke ATV and in 1997, with the introduction of the \\"twin 700\\" snowmobile engine Polaris started the development and production of in-house produced power plants, known as the \\"Liberty\\" line of engines, now found in many models across their current production lines. Since that time Polaris has continued to develop their in-house engine production capacity, now designing and manufacturing all of their own power plants, while maintaining the partnership with Subaru. In 2010, Polaris relocated a portion of its utility and sport vehicle assembly to Mexico. Components manufactured in Osceola, Wisconsin and the vehicle assembly in Roseau, Minnesota. The vast majority of powertrain and vehicles for the off-road line are manufactured in the Osceola and Roseau facilities, respectively. Both the Victory and Indian motorcycle brands are American made with complete powertrains and vehicle assembly located in Osceola, Wisconsin and Spirit Lake, Iowa, respectively. History Polaris Sno Traveler (1965) Polaris RZR ATV used by firefighters in the Kaibab National Forest. Edgar Hetteen, who was described by the Snowmobile Hall of Fame in St. Germain, Wisconsin as the father of the snowmobile, David Johnson, and Edgar's brother Allan Hetteen were partners in Hetteen Hoist and Derrick in Roseau, Minnesota. Edgar had dropped out of school after the eighth grade in 1934. David Johnson and company employees Paul Knochenmus and Orlen Johnson, who was the first person to ride a Polaris, decided to create a vehicle that could travel through snow. These vehicles' primary use was to make hunting locations more accessible. David Johnson and several employees created the prototype in 1954 while Edgar was on a business trip. Edgar returned to Roseau to discover the snow machine and was furious the employees had used their time and company resources on the machine. This first machine used a grain silo conveyor belt as a track, a Briggs and Stratton motor, and an old Chevy bumper for skis. Edgar was skeptical of its value,[\\"Snowmobile Pioneer Cut A Fast Trail for the Sport, Wall Street Journal, February 16, 2011, p.A5] and the No. 1 sled was soon sold to Roseau lumberyard owner \\"Silver Pete\\" H.F. Peterson for $465 in order to meet company payroll. However, the employees continued to focus on building snowmobiles and soon a second model was created, with Allan Hetteen leading the way; it was called the Polaris Sno Traveler. The first production model rolled off the assembly line in Minnesota in 1956. The original models weighed close to and moved at a speed of about . As Polaris snowmobiles gained sales traction, Edgar Hetteen became an advocate of the new product line. In order to promote the new snowmobile and prove its reliability and usefulness, in 1960 Edgar led a three-snowmobile, 1,200-mile trek across the Alaskan wilderness, starting from Bethel, Alaska. The trip took three weeks, and much of the time, Edgar struggled to maintain 10 mph over the snow. The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner put them on its front page. However, Edgar's absence caused problems for him with the Roseau bank's board of directors. Soon after completing the trip, Edgar left the company in June and started a competing company called Polar Manufacturing in Thief River Falls, Minnesota. The company name later changed to Arctic Enterprises; in the mid-1980s it filed for bankruptcy amid fierce competition as snowmobiles became popular and other manufacturers jumped into the market. The company emerged from bankruptcy and continues on today as Arctic Cat. Polaris began developing a smaller consumer- sized, front-engine snowmobile to compete with the Ski-Doo in the early 1960s. In 1964, Polaris released the Comet. However, the Comet soon ran into problems as it could not travel in all types of snow conditions. Polaris then recalled the sleds and quickly developed a new prototype to avoid bankruptcy. The new model, the 1965 Mustang, became a hit as a family snowmobile and boosted Polaris sales. Polaris continued to develop snowmobiles similar to this model throughout the 1960s-1970s, and went on to become one of the leaders in the snowmobile industry. In the early 1980s, Polaris started creating an Indy style snowmobile with IFS and a wider stance. They continued with the Indy style sled in the 90's with the Storm, XLT, XCR, Ultra, RMK, and Trail lines, within the last few years Polaris has re-introduced the INDY model name. In 1985, Polaris introduced the Scrambler ATC and Trail Boss, which are considered to be the first American-made production all-terrain vehicles (ATV). In the early 1990s, Polaris introduced the Polaris Rocky Mountain King (RMK)- a snowmobile specific for mountain terrain. In May 2009, Polaris announced the creation of an On-Road Vehicle Division. The new division will be devoted to the growth of Victory motorcycles and other on-road products and brands. In 2010, Polaris introduced the Polaris Rush snowmobile which had a new suspension system and better trail handling capabilities. This snowmobile is also available with retro graphics on the Rush and Iq models. In late 2005, Polaris announced that it would purchase a portion of KTM Motorcycles. Through this venture KTM has developed their own ATV and Polaris has developed Sport ATVs which utilize the KTM 525 and 450 powerplants. A Polaris Ranger modified as an Ambulance. On May 21, 2010, Polaris announced that it was opening a new manufacturing plant in Mexico. The sister facility in Osceola, Wisconsin still remains in full operation. The opening of the Monterrey, Mexico facility is anticipated to save the company $30 million annually, with most of that savings coming from lower wages. The Monterrey facility has 3 assembly lines devoted to production of Ranger side-by-sides for global markets. The original intent of the Monterrey facility was to serve markets in the Southern US plus Mexico and North America. In October 2011, Polaris announced an investment in Brammo, Inc., an electric vehicle company based in Ashland, Oregon, United States. Its first production electric motorcycle, the Brammo Enertia, is assembled in Ashland and sold at dealerships. Polaris continued its investment in Brammo when it participated in the $13 million opening tranche of Brammo's Series C funding round in July 2012. Polaris had been showing interest in electric propulsion, producing an electric version of its Ranger Side-by-Side and more recently buying Global Electric Motorcars (GEM). As one publication put it, \\"This latest move likely signals the addition of clean and quiet drivetrains to ATVs and motorcycles under the global giant's brand umbrella ‚Äì snowmobiles may have to wait on battery breakthroughs before they become commercially feasible.\\" On January 15, 2015, Polaris announced that it had purchased the entire electric motorcycle business from Brammo. Production of electric motorcycles was slated to commence at Polaris' factory in Spirit Lake, Iowa during the second half of 2015. Polaris also manufactures Victory and Indian motorcycles at the Spirit Lake factory. In 2012, production restarted on the Indy-named sleds (stopped in 2004 with the Indy 500) with the release of the 2013 Indy 600 and Indy 600 SP. For 2014, Polaris will expand the Indy name and provide model variants for nearly all categories (the one exception being the \\"Mountain\\" class). On April 11, 2013, Polaris announced that it acquired Aixam-Mega, a French quadricycle manufacturer. On January 9, 2015, Polaris announced it will be opening a new 600,000-square-foot facility in Huntsville, Alabama that will employ at least 1,700 workers. Construction on the new manufacturing plant is set to start in early 2015 and should be opened by the spring of 2016. The plant will support several core processes including, vehicle assembly, chassis and body painting, welding, fabrication and injection molding. On March 7, 2016, Polaris acquired Taylor-Dunn, a manufacturer of industrial vehicles based in Anaheim, CA. On January 9, 2017, Polaris Chairman and CEO Scott Wine announced they would be shutting down Victory Motorcycles. They announced they will continue to honor warranties and produce parts for Victory Motorcycles for the next 10 years. In May 2018, Polaris reentered the production of boats by purchasing the Indiana-based Boat Holdings LLC for $805 million. The company invested further in its boating division in January 2019 with the acquisition of Marquis-Larson Boat Group out of Pulaski, Wisconsin. Production of Marquis-Larson moved to a facility in Syracuse, Indiana. They then went on to make the Polaris Slingshot, a three- wheeler. On July 29, 2019, the company changed its name from Polaris Industries Inc. to Polaris Inc. and commenced trading with the new name on August 8, 2019. Racing Polaris Racing is one of the big four factory racing teams on the World Power Sports Association (WPSA) Snocross circuit. With 44 signed riders, they also run in Hill Cross, Oval Track Racing, and Cross Country Racing. The Polaris Racing Team won 8 different Championships in the 2006‚Äì2007 season. Arnar Gunnarsson (#26) won the Pro Open, G√∫sti (#10) won Pro Stock, Klara Bj√∂rk (#89) won pro women at Iceland, T. J. Gulla (#44) won the WPSA Pro Stock Championship, Ross Martin (#837) won the WPSA Pro Open Championship, and Kylie Abramson (#87) won the WPSA Pro Women's Championship. Gabe Bunke (#74) has won the USCC Pro 600 Class Championship and USCC Pro Open Class. Dustin Wahl (#74) won the Pro Ice 440 Championship, the Pro Ice Formula Championship, and the Millennium 600 Open championship, and John Cyr III (#99) won the 2004 USCC Pro 700 Class Championship. Most all of the Polaris Racing riders drive the IQR 440, 600 or 700 Racer, depending on the class and the event. Polaris holds the most wins in the World's Longest Toughest Snowmobile Race, the Iron Dog a 2,000 miles race across Alaska. Polaris Government and Defense The straddled Sportsman MV850 is Polaris' smallest military vehicle ‚Äî nimble, but with 850 lbs payload Polaris Government and Defense (formerly Polaris Defense) is a division of Polaris Industries founded in 2005 and re- branded in 2017. The division was created after years of successful implementation of the company's off-road vehicles in military theater. The division produces a range of vehicles to serve the United States and allied forces. Products include the MRZR platform, MVRS, MV700, RZR-SW and the DAGOR. =MRZR= In November 2016, the U.S. Marine Corps signed a $6.5 million contract with Polaris to deliver 145 MRZR-D ATVs. Called the Utility Task Vehicle (UTV), it is a version of the vehicle already in use by U.S. Special Operations Command, but is designed to be diesel-powered and can run on JP-8 fuel. The Marines bought the unarmored ATVs because they can fit inside an MV-22 Osprey, enabling them to be deployed from long distances, to provide logistics support to ground combat units, assisting them to travel and transport supplies quicker and easier than previously on foot. The vehicles can carry four troops and have a small cargo bed capable of carrying of payload. It is planned to field 18 MRZR-Ds per infantry regiment. The vehicles are to be delivered from late-January to April 2017.Marine Corps to Equip Infantry Units with Polaris ATVs - DoDBuzz.com, 27 September 2016Marine grunts to get new all-terrain vehicles for missions - MarineCorpstimes.com, 22 November 2016Marine Grunts Will Start Getting ATVs in January - Defensetech.org, 23 November 2016 =DAGOR= DAGOR (Deployable Advanced Ground Off-road) is a purpose-built, ultra-light combat vehicle designed and built by Polaris Defense to meet the light-mobility needs of light infantry and special operations forces incorporating military commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and driveline system. The DAGOR was developed under contract from elements of the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM), Canadian Special Operations Forces Command (CANSOFCOM) and international Special Operations Forces (SOF) customers. The design using (COTS) components enables procurement of spares worldwide. The vehicle is produced by Michigan- based Roush Industries with deliveries commencing in November 2014 with fifteen vehicles for use by the United States Special Operations Command, in January 2015 with five vehicles for the Australian Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) to trial and deliveries were scheduled for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in April 2015. In December, 2016, the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command announced that a contract valued at approximately was awarded for the acquisition of 52 ULCV with the option to procure an additional 26 vehicles over a two year period. In July, 2017, Canadian Special Operations Forces Command exercised the option to procure an additional 10 ULCV, bringing the total number of ULCV under this acquisition to 62. The vehicle can be configured in up to 48 different weapon configurations using the weapons ring and multiple pintle mounts. The vehicle is powered by a light weight, commercial off-the-shelf turbo diesel / JP8 engine located at the front section. The vehicle can transport a maximum payload of more than 1,400 kg or up to nine infantrymen in support of expeditionary missions. It offers high mobility and higher speeds over rough terrains. The vehicle is certified for air drop and internal air transport by CH-47 Chinook heavy-lift helicopter, and sling load under UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters.

Colonization is a trilogy of alternate history books by American writer Harry Turtledove.http://www.uchronia.net/label/turtworldw.html#10 It is a series continuation of the situation set up in the Worldwar tetralogy, projecting the situation between humanity and The Race (the bipedal lizard-like invaders and settlers from Worldwar) nearly twenty years afterward, in the mid-1960s. The Race has settled and plans to colonize nearly half the surface of the Earth, including Africa, Australia, China, southern Asia, Mexico, Central America, South America, Spain, Portugal, and Poland prewar Poland and East Prussia). The United States, Canada, the Soviet Union, the Greater German Reich (Germany and the territories that it occupied during World War II), the United Kingdom, and Japan are the only other powers when the Race's colonization fleet of 80-100 million settlers arrives. Humanity and The Race still jockey for advantages over each other. Novels Books of the Colonization trilogy are: * Colonization: Second Contact (1999) * Colonization: Down to Earth (2000) * Colonization: Aftershocks (2001) A follow-up novel to this series, Homeward Bound, was released in 2004. Political situation The Race has taken over half of the planet. With the exception of the Greater German Reich, the Soviet Union, the Japanese Empire, the British Isles, the US, and some nations that are allied to the major powers, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere, the Race rules most of the Earth. The Race spends its time trying to adapt to conditions on Earth (for example, the aliens release species from Home on Earth, causing environmental trouble). The Soviet Union supplies weapons to Mao Zedong's Communist Party. The Greater German Reich attacks Race-held Poland (and fails, resulting in the death of F√ºhrer Ernst Kaltenbrunner, his top officials, the nuclear destruction of much of Greater Germany, the removal of Nazi space installations, the German capital being relocated to Flensburg, and Walter Dornberger becoming the new F√ºhrer. France regains its independence under a new Fourth Republic. The United States is led by President Earl Warren. The Soviet Union is ruled by ex-Foreign Commissar Vyacheslav Molotov. Technology The Race's initial invasion has benefited the technology of humanity. With the end to the second round of fighting, alien technology is being rapidly absorbed by humanity. Although the Race remains superior in technology, it is swiftly losing ground as human technology advances. By the end of Colonization: Aftershocks, the United States and the Greater German Reich already have spacecraft floating among the asteroid belt. The Americans have also launched two human starships. The Soviet Union, the United States, and the Greater German Reich have established a moon base, and Germany then the US put a man on Mars. Literary criticism and reception A writer from the Irish Independent called the Colonization series one of the best of Turtledove's works.

Four Essays on Liberty. 1969. A concept of positive liberty may also include freedom from internal constraints.Steven J. Heyman, \\"Positive and negative liberty.\\" Chicago-Kent Law Review. 68 (1992): 81-90. online The concepts of structure and agency are central to the concept of positive liberty because in order to be free, a person should be free from inhibitions of the social structure in carrying out their free will. Structurally, classism, sexism, ageism, ableism and racism can inhibit a person's freedom. As positive liberty is primarily concerned with the possession of sociological agency, it is enhanced by the ability of citizens to participate in government and have their voices, interests, and concerns recognized and acted upon. Isaiah Berlin's essay \\"Two Concepts of Liberty\\" (1958) is typically acknowledged as the first to explicitly draw the distinction between positive and negative liberty.Eric Nelson, \\"Liberty: One or Two Concepts Liberty: One Concept Too Many?.\\" Political theory 33.1 (2005): 58-78.Bruce Baum and Robert Nichols, (eds.), Isaiah Berlin and the Politics of Freedom: ‚ÄòTwo Concepts of Liberty‚Äô 50 Years Later, (Routledge, 2013).  Overview  The word liberty can refer to many things, but Isaiah Berlin recognized two main types of liberty. Berlin described a statement such as \\"I am slave to no man\\" as one of negative liberty, that is, freedom from another individual's direct interference. He contrasted this with a Positive Freedom statement such as \\"I am my own master\\", which lays claim to a freedom to choose one's own pursuits in life. Charles Taylor sees Negative Freedom as an \\"opportunity-concept\\": one possesses Negative Freedom if one is not enslaved by external forces, and has equal access to a society's resources (regardless of how one decides to spend their time). Positive Freedom, says Taylor, is an \\"exercise-concept\\": possessing it might mean that one is not internally constrained; one must be able to act according to their highest self ‚Äì according to reason. Suppose a rich and powerful actor is also a drug addict. This actor may possess a great deal of negative liberty, but very little Positive Liberty according to Taylor. By Taylor's definitions, Positive Freedom entails being in a mature state of decision making, free of internal or external restraints (e.g. weakness, fear, ignorance, etc.).  History  Jean-Jacques Rousseau's theory of freedom, according to which individual freedom is achieved through participation in the process whereby one's community exercises collective control over its own affairs in accordance with the \\"general will\\". Some interpret The Social Contract to suggest that Rousseau believed that liberty was the power of individual citizens to act in the government to bring about changes; this is essentially the power for self- governance and democracy. Rousseau himself said, \\"the mere impulse to appetite is slavery, while obedience to law we prescribe ourselves is liberty.\\"Rousseau as quoted by Replogle, Ron. Recovering the Social Contract. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. (1989), p. 105. For Rousseau, the passage from the state of nature to the civil state substitutes justice for instinct gives his actions the morality they had formerly lacked.Michael Rosen, Jonathan Wolff, Catriona McKinnon (eds.), Political Thought, Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 63. G. F. W. Hegel wrote in his Elements of the Philosophy of Right (in the part in which he introduced the concept of the sphere of abstract right) that \\"duty is not a restriction on freedom, but only on freedom in the abstract\\" and that \\"duty is the attainment of our essence, the winning of positive freedom.George Klosko, History of Political Theory: An Introduction: Volume II: Modern (2nd ed.), Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 465: \\"we should note that Hegel's realization of the distance between his own and the traditional liberal conception of freedom, which he calls \\"abstract freedom,\\" is clear in his embrace of positive freedom [in PR ¬ß149A]\\".  Examples  In the description of positive liberty from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, > Put in the simplest terms, one might say that a democratic society is a free > society because it is a self-determined society, and that a member of that > society is free to the extent that he or she participates in its democratic > process. But there are also individualist applications of the concept of > positive freedom. For example, it is sometimes said that a government should > aim actively to create the conditions necessary for individuals to be self- > sufficient or to achieve self-realization. In \\"Recovering the Social Contract\\", Ron Replogle made a metaphor that is helpful in understanding positive liberty. \\"Surely, it is no assault on my dignity as a person if you take my car keys, against my will, when I have had too much to drink. There is nothing paradoxical about making an agreement beforehand providing for paternalistic supervision in circumstances when our competence is open to doubt.\\"Replogle, Ron. Recovering the Social Contract. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. (1989). p. 164. In this sense, positive liberty is the adherence to a set of rules agreed upon by all parties involved. Should the rules be altered, all parties involved must agree upon the changes. Therefore, positive liberty is a contractarian philosophy. However, Isaiah Berlin opposed any suggestion that paternalism and positive liberty could be equivalent. He stated that positive liberty could only apply when the withdrawal of liberty from an individual was in pursuit of a choice that individual himself/herself made, not a general principle of society or any other person's opinion. In the case where a person removes a driver's car keys against their will because they have had too much to drink, this constitutes positive freedom only if the driver has made, of their own free will, an earlier decision not to drive drunk. Thus, by removing the keys, the other person facilitates this decision and ensures that it will be upheld in the face of paradoxical behaviour (i.e., drinking) by the driver. For the remover to remove the keys in the absence of such an expressed intent by the driver, because the remover feels that the driver ought not to drive drunk, is paternalism, and not positive freedom by Berlin's definition. Erich Fromm sees the distinction between the two types of freedom emerging alongside humanity's evolution away from the instinctual activity that characterizes lower animal forms. This aspect of freedom, he argues, \\"is here used not in its positive sense of 'freedom to' but in its negative sense of 'freedom from', namely freedom from instinctual determination of his actions.\\"Erich Fromm, The Fear of Freedom (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd., 1966), p. 26. For Fromm, freedom from animal instinct implicitly implies that survival now hinges on the necessity of charting one's own course. He relates this distinction to the biblical story of man's expulsion from Eden: Positive freedom, Fromm maintains, comes through the actualization of individuality in balance with the separation from the whole: a \\"solidarity with all men\\", united not by instinctual or predetermined ties, but on the basis of a freedom founded on reason.Erich Fromm, The Fear of Freedom, p. 29.

The members of a type are the values of that type. The \\"value of a variable\\" is given by the corresponding mapping in the environment. In languages with assignable variables it becomes necessary to distinguish between the r-value (or contents) and the l-value (or location) of a variable. In declarative (high-level) languages, values have to be referentially transparent. This means that the resulting value is independent of the location in which a (sub-)expression needed to compute the value is stored. Only the contents of the location (the bits, whether they are 1 or 0) and their interpretation are significant. Assignment: l-values and r-values Some languages use the idea of l-values and r-values, deriving from the typical mode of evaluation on the left and right hand side of an assignment statement. An l-value refers to an object that persists beyond a single expression. An r-value is a temporary value that does not persist beyond the expression that uses it. The notion of l-values and r-values was introduced by Combined Programming Language (CPL). The notions in an expression of r-value, l-value, and r-value/l-value are analogous to the parameter modes of input parameter (has a value), output parameter (can be assigned), and input/output parameter (has a value and can be assigned), though the technical details differ between contexts and languages. =R-values and addresses= In many languages, notably the C family, l-values have storage addresses that are programmatically accessible to the running program (e.g., via some address-of operator like \\"&\\" in C/C++), meaning that they are variables or de-referenced references to a certain memory location. R-values can be l-values (see below) or non-l-values‚Äîa term only used to distinguish from l-values. Consider the C expression . When executed, the computer generates an integer value of 13, but because the program has not explicitly designated where in the computer this 13 is stored, the expression is a non l-value. On the other hand, if a C program declares a variable x and assigns the value of 13 to x, then the expression has a value of 13 and is an l-value. In C, the term l-value originally meant something that could be assigned to (hence the name, indicating it is on the left side of the assignment operator), but since the reserved word (constant) was added to the language, the term is now 'modifiable l-value'. In C++11 a special semantic- glyph exists ( not to be confused with the \`&&\` operator used for logical operations ), to denote the use/access of the expression's address for the compiler only; i.e., the address cannot be retrieved using the address-of operator during the run-time of the program (see the use of move semantics). This type of reference can be applied to all r-values including non-l-values as well as l-values. Some processors provide one or more instructions which take an immediate value, sometimes referred to as \\"immediate\\" for short. An immediate value is stored as part of the instruction which employs it, usually to load into, add to, or subtract from, a register. The other parts of the instruction are the opcode, and destination. The latter may be implicit. (A non-immediate value may reside in a register, or be stored elsewhere in memory, requiring the instruction to contain a direct or indirect address [e.g., index register address] to the value.) The l-value expression designates (refers to) an object. A non-modifiable l-value is addressable, but not assignable. A modifiable l-value allows the designated object to be changed as well as examined. An r-value is any expression, a non-l-value is any expression that is not an l-value. One example is an \\"immediate value\\" (look below) and consequently not addressable..  In assembly language  A value can be virtually any kind of data by a given data type, for instance a string, a digit, a single letter. Processors often support more than one size of immediate data, e.g. 8 or 16 bit, employing a unique opcode and mnemonic for each instruction variant. If a programmer supplies a data value that will not fit, the assembler issues an \\"Out of range\\" error message. Most assemblers allow an immediate value to be expressed as ASCII, decimal, hexadecimal, octal, or binary data. Thus, the ASCII character is the same as or . The byte order of strings may differ between processors, depending on the assembler and computer architecture.

It is the earliest extant record of the Dangun legend, which records the founding of Gojoseon as the first Korean nation. Authorship and date The text was written in Classical Chinese, which was used by literate Koreans at the time of its composition. The earliest version of the text is believed to have been compiled in the 1280s, and the earliest extant publication of the text is from 1512 CE. 20th- century Korean scholars such as Choe Nam-seon established the Buddhist monk Iryeon (1206‚Äì1289) as the main compiler of the text, on the basis that his name (and full official title) was indicated in the fifth fascicle. This view is widely accepted among modern scholars. The compilation is believed to have been expanded by Iryeon's disciple Muguk (1250-1322) and several others prior to the definitive 1512 recension. Ha Chongnyong and Yi Kunjik produced a critical edition of Samguk yusa in 1997. According to Ha Chongnyong, Iryeon wrote only the fifth fascicle, since his name is mentioned only in that section of the text. The 1512 edition of the text mentions a dynastic chronology at the beginning, which has several discrepancies with the information that appears later in the text. According to Robert Buswell, Jr. and Donald S. Lopez, Jr., this chronology may have been a fourteenth-century addition to Iryeon's compilation. Historical reliability Many of the founding legends of the various kingdoms in Korean history are recorded in Samguk yusa. The text covers legends from many Korean kingdoms, including Gojoseon, Wiman Joseon, Buyeo, Goguryeo, Baekje, Silla, and Gaya. Unlike the more factually-oriented Samguk sagi, the Samguk yusa focuses on various folktales, legends and biographies from early Korean history. Given its mythical narratives, Samguk yusas reliability is questionable. Editions * Ilyeon (2006) Overlooked Historical Records of the Three Korean Kingdoms, translated by Kim Dal-Yong.

Crosby was born in North Platte, Nebraska. After attending Hastings College, Crosby transferred to the University of Minnesota. He received a B.A. degree from the University of Minnesota in 1931 and an LL.B. degree from Harvard Law School in 1935. Crosby served in Nebraska's unicameral legislature from 1941 to 1945. He was chosen speaker of the Unicameral in 1943 and, at 31, was the youngest person ever to hold that position. After volunteering for two years in the United States Navy, Crosby served as Nebraska's Lieutenant Governor from 1947 to 1949. While Lieutenant Governor, Crosby wrote \\"Why I Want to Get Rid of My Job.\\" Governor Crosby, who was known as \\"The Boy Governor from North Platte,\\" was particularly proud that he was a great- grandson of John Holbrook Powers. \\"Honest John\\" Powers ran for governor in Nebraska as a populist in 1892. In April 1954, Governor Crosby appointed Eva Bowring to the U.S. Senate to fill out the term of the late Dwight Griswold. In July 1954, Governor Crosby appointed Samuel Williams Reynolds to the U.S. Senate to fill out the term of the late Hugh A. Butler. Crosby was a candidate for the U.S. Senate in the Republican primary in 1954, but was defeated by Carl T. Curtis. U.S. Senator Hazel H. Abel, who had been elected to serve the last two months of the term of the late Dwight Griswold, resigned a few days before the end of her term, and Governor Crosby appointed Curtis to serve the remainder of her term. That gave Senator Curtis slightly more seniority than other senators elected at the same time. Gov. Crosby was also known for his speaking ability. He had the ability to adapt to his audience. His style of logical, ethical and emotional appeal was used both in political speeches and in his law practice. One of the most public aspects of his legal work was the defense of Duane Pope for murder. Crosby's speaking style using combinations of support (logical, ethical and emotional ) helped distinguish him from his colleagues ( Nykodym, 1968). Following his service as governor, Crosby practiced law in Lincoln, Nebraska, until shortly before his death in 2000. In 1971, he married LaVon Crosby, a Nebraska state senator from 1989 to 2000.

The company was founded in 1955 and is based in Columbus, Georgia. In the U.S., Aflac underwrites a wide range of insurance policies, but is perhaps more known for its payroll deduction insurance coverage, which pays cash benefits when a policyholder has a covered accident or illness. The company states it \\"provides financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide\\". In 2009, Aflac acquired Continental American Insurance Company for $100 million; this enabled Aflac to sell supplemental insurance on both the individual and group platform. , Aflac was represented by approximately 19,300 sales agencies in Japan, and 76,900 licensed sales associates in the U.S. History The company was founded by brothers John, Paul (died 2014), and William Amos in Columbus, Georgia, in 1955, as American Family Life Insurance Company of Columbus. In 1964, the company name was changed to American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. The company, in 1990, adopted the Aflac acronym, although the official name of the underwriting subsidiary remains American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. Aflac announced the appointment of Frederick J. Crawford as Chief Financial Officer, as well as Executive Vice President in June 2015. The company signed 6,426 policyholders in its first year. Aflac pioneered cancer insurance in 1958. Beginning in 1964, the company decided to focus sales on worksite settings, eventually through policies sponsored by employers and funded through payroll deductions. By 2003, more than 98% of Aflac policies in the United States were issued on a payroll deduction basis, making the company a leader in that approach to policy distribution. Business Aflac operates in the United States and Japan, and has its worldwide headquarters and corporate offices in an eighteen-story tower just east of Downtown Columbus, Georgia, in an area known as MidTown. The Aflac tower is the tallest building in the city. , the corporation's total assets were more than $103 billion, and the company insured more than 50 million people worldwide. Aflac is the largest provider of guaranteed-renewable insurance in the United States and the largest insurance company overall in Japan, when measured by individual insurance policies in force. The company now offers several types of insurance policies in the United States, including the following: * Accident * Cancer/Specified Disease * Dental * Hospital Confinement Indemnity * Hospital Confinement Sickness Indemnity * Hospital Intensive Care * Life * Lump Sum Cancer * Lump Sum Cancer Critical Illness * Specified Health Event * Short Term Disability * Vision Aflac also offers un-reimbursed medical, dependent day-care, and transportation flexible spending accounts. The company additionally offers human resources services for HIPAA and COBRA. From 1979 to 1997, the company owned several television stations, most of them in small and medium markets. It sold the broadcasting division (including flagship station WTVM) to what became Raycom Media in 1997. Aflac is ranked 137th in the Fortune 500 list of largest United States corporations by revenue. Critics of cancer policies Consumer groups and some government officials say that cancer insurance returns fewer premium dollars to policyholders than standard insurance. A United States General Accounting Office study found that the policies paid back as little as 35% of premiums (Aflac said its cancer insurance paid back 62.4%). In comparison, New York State requires most major-medical policies to pay back 82% and group policies to pay back 75%. New York State does not allow stand-alone cancer policies. In 1997, AFLAC spent $175,000 on lobbyists and campaign contributions to change the law. New York State lifted its ban in 1998, for purchasers who already have basic coverage. Consumer Reports recommended that policyholders use the money instead to buy lower-deductible insurance. Insurance claims by line appear on the Annual Statement filed with each state. Loss claims are a percent of total premium before commissions. The Aflac Duck Since December 1999, the company's identity and brand has become more widely recognized in the United States as the result of TV commercials featuring the Aflac Duck, who frustratedly quacks the company's name to unsuspecting prospective policy holders. The duck concept and all of the commercials to date have been created by Kaplan Thaler Group, an advertising agency based in New York City. Metzer Farms, a Gonzales, California, waterfowl and gamebird hatchery, supplied them with the initial ducklings that each grew into the famous duck. Struggling to come up with a concept to make the big but relatively obscure insurance company's name memorable, one of the agency's art directors stumbled upon the duck idea while walking around Central Park at lunchtime uttering, \\"Aflac, Aflac.\\" He soon realized how much the company's name sounded like a duck's quack. The Aflac Duck character has now starred in more than 30 commercials. In many of these commercials, character actor Earl Billings also appears. The Aflac Duck is enshrined on Madison Avenue's Walk of Fame as one of America's Favorite Advertising Icons. In April 2009, Aflac introduced a new marketing campaign called \\"Get the Aflacts\\", designed to educate consumers about the specific benefits of the insurance products the company sells. The Aflacts campaign gave the Aflac Duck \\"a more prominent role\\", designed to \\"help potential customers learn the Aflacts, er, facts about policies and other products\\", according to The New York Times. Celebrities have starred in the Aflac ads, including Chevy Chase (2003); Yogi Berra; Yao Ming; Donald Trump's wife and current First Lady, Melania Trump (2005); NASCAR Cup Series driver Carl Edwards (2008‚Äì2014); the United States Olympic synchronized swimming team (2004); and Wayne Newton playing at Stardust Hotel and Casino for the 2003 commercial. The duck also appeared with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. In 2005, the company logo was changed to incorporate the duck. The first commercial using the new logo featured Gilbert Gottfried at a pet store because the duck kept saying, \\"Aflac!\\" and he had to trade in the duck for a parrot, saying, \\"If you're hurt and can't work\\". The duck was originally voiced by comedian Gilbert Gottfried, who also voiced Digit on the PBS Kids series Cyberchase and Iago in the Disney film Aladdin. After 11 years as the voice of the Aflac duck, Gottfried was dismissed on March 14, 2011, due to jokes on Gottfried's Twitter account referencing the T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. The company's chief marketing officer stated that \\"Gilbert's recent comments about the crisis in Japan were lacking in humor, and certainly do not represent the thoughts and feelings of anyone at Aflac.\\" On March 23, 2011, Aflac announced that the company was taking applications for the new voice of the Aflac Duck through QuackAflac.com until April 1. Commercials requesting the submissions, first aired in 2006 but updated, resemble a silent movie. On April 26, 2011, it was announced that Daniel McKeague, a television advertising sales manager from Hugo, Minnesota, would be the new voice of the Aflac duck. The first Aflac commercial featuring the duck's new voice aired on May 1, 2011. In 2018, an Aflac ad inserted an animated Aflac duck into the opening credits of the DuckTales reboot.https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/duck-tales-aflac-advertising- disney-1202564375/ In 2020, an Aflac ad inserted an animated Aflac duck into the opening credits of Scoob!. Corporate philanthropy and social responsibility The company states that through a partnership with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Aflac has contributed more than $100 million to childhood cancer research and treatment. Aflac employees are formally involved in an array of charitable organizations such as Habitat for Humanity International, the Easter Seals, and the United Way. Aflac's stated objectives include the decrease of its environmental impact, for which the company is into a partnership with the Clean Air Campaign to encourage employees to engage with greater frequency in alternate commuting methods. Aflac and Macy's Partnership Aflac and Macy‚Äôs have partnered since 2001 to sell the annual Aflac holiday plush duck in select Macy‚Äôs stores nationwide. Net proceeds from each duck sold are donated to the participating children‚Äôs cancer facility nearest to where it is purchased. Since 2001, more than $3 million has been raised from the sale of the ducks. Aflac has participated in the Macy‚Äôs Thanksgiving Day Parade for the past six years. A new balloonicle was unveiled in 2014, featuring the Aflac Duck wearing ice skates. COVID-19 Aflac expects an increase in claims due to COVID-19. Award programs Aflac National High School Baseball Player of the Year (first presented in 2004). The Jackie Robinson Award is given to the high-school player who is entering his senior year and who best displays character, leadership, and the values of being a student athlete in academics and community affairs. The award is presented at an annual All-American Awards banquet, which was first held in 2003. The banquet follows the annual All- American Baseball Classic, an East-West all-star game featuring the 38 best players from around the nation who are entering their senior year of high school. First held in 2003, the game is played at Petco Park, San Diego, California.

Company history The bank opened in 1888 following an incident at a textile mill in which a worker's dress became entangled in machinery, spilling the money she had sewn into her hem onto the floor. After she explained to a factory executive that she had felt this was the safest place to keep her savings, he offered instead to secure her money in the mill safe and pay her interest on her balance. This service was soon offered to all company employees. Synovus's founding parent company, Columbus Bank and Trust (CB&T;), has deep roots in its hometown. CB&T; started TSYS in 1959 and in 1974 the company began processing credit cards for other banks. In 1983, CB&T; made TSYS a separate publicly traded company, retaining majority ownership.

It is one of the largest museums in North America and the largest in Canada. It attracts more than one million visitors every year, making the ROM the most-visited museum in Canada. The museum is north of Queen's Park, in the University of Toronto district, with its main entrance on Bloor Street West. Museum subway station is named after the ROM and, since a 2008 renovation, is decorated to resemble the institution's collection. Established on 16 April 1912 and opened on 19 March 1914, the museum has maintained close relations with the University of Toronto throughout its history, often sharing expertise and resources. The museum was under the direct control and management of the University of Toronto until 1968, when it became an independent Crown agency of the Government of Ontario. Today, the museum is Canada's largest field-research institution, with research and conservation activities around the world. With more than 6,000,000 items and 40 galleries, the museum's diverse collections of world culture and natural history contribute to its international reputation. The museum contains a collection of dinosaurs, minerals and meteorites; Canadian, and European historical artifacts; as well as African, Near Eastern, and East Asian art. It houses the world's largest collection of fossils from the Burgess Shale with more than 150,000 specimens. The museum also contains an extensive collection of design and fine art, including clothing, interior, and product design, especially Art Deco. History The Royal Ontario Museum was formally established on 16 April 1912 and was jointly governed by the Government of Ontario and the University of Toronto. Its first assets were transferred from the University and the Ontario Department of Education, coming from its predecessor the Museum of Natural History and Fine Arts at the Toronto Normal School.For the history of the archaeological and ethnographic collection of the Normal School, later given to the ROM, see Gerald Killan, David Boyle: From Artisan to Archaeologist, Toronto, University of Toronto Press, 1983 and Michelle A Hamilton, Collections and Objections: Aboriginal Material Culture in Southern Ontario, Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2010. On 19 March 1914, the Duke of Connaught, also the Governor General of Canada, officially opened the Royal Ontario Museum to the public. The museum's location at the edge of Toronto's built-up area, far from the city's central business district, was selected mainly for its proximity to the University of Toronto. The original building was constructed on the western edge of the property along the university's Philosopher's Walk, with its main entrance facing out onto Bloor Street housing five separate museums of the following fields: Archaeology, Palaeontology, Mineralogy, Zoology, and Geology. It cost to construct. This was the first phase of a two-part construction plan that intended to expand the museum towards Queen's Park Crescent, ultimately creating an H-shaped structure. The Royal Ontario Museum, circa 1930s The first expansion to the Royal Ontario Museum publicly opened on 12 October 1933. The -million renovation saw the construction of the east wing fronting onto Queen's Park and required the demolition of Argyle House, a Victorian mansion at 100 Queen's Park. As this occurred during the Great Depression, an effort was made to use primarily local building materials and to make use of workers capable of manually excavating the building's foundations. Teams of workers alternated weeks of service due to the physically draining nature of the job. In 1947, the ROM was dissolved as a body corporate, with all assets transferred to the University of Toronto. The museum remained a part of the University until 1968, when the Museum and the McLaughlin Planetarium were separated from the University to form a new corporation. On 26 October 1968, the ROM opened the McLaughlin Planetarium on the south end of the property after receiving a million donation from Colonel Samuel McLaughlin. In December 1995, the ROM closed the McLaughlin Planetarium as a result of budgetary cutbacks imposed by the Government of Ontario. The space temporarily reopened from 1998 to 2002, after being leased to Children's Own Museum. In 2009, the ROM sold the building to the University of Toronto for $22 million and ensured that it would continue to be used for institutional and academic purposes. The McLaughlin Planetarium next to the museum. The planetarium was operated by the museum from 1968 to 2009. The second major addition to the museum was the Queen Elizabeth II Terrace Galleries on the north side of the building and a curatorial centre built on the south, which started in 1978 and was completed in 1984. The new construction meant that a former outdoor \\"Chinese Garden\\" to the north of the building facing Bloor, along with an adjoining indoor restaurant, had to be dismantled. Opened in 1984 by Queen Elizabeth II, the million expansion took the form of layered terraces, each rising layer stepping back from Bloor Street. The design of this expansion won a Governor-General's Award in Architecture. In 1989, activists complained about its Into the Heart of Africa exhibit, which featured stereotypes of Africans, forcing curator Jeanne Cannizzo to resign.Petersen, Klaus & Allan C. Hutchinson. \\"Interpreting Censorship in Canada\\", University of Toronto Press, 1999 Beginning in 2002, the museum underwent a major renovation and expansion project dubbed as Renaissance ROM. The Ontario and Canadian governments, both supporters of this venture, contributed $60 million towards the project. Michael Lee-Chin donated $30 million to support the project. The campaign aimed not only to raise annual visitor attendance from 750,000 to between 1.4 and 1.6 million, but also to generate additional funding opportunities to support the museum's research, conservation, galleries and educational public programs. The centrepiece of the project, the Michael Lee-Chin Crystal, was a major addition to the building's original framework. The structure was created by architect Daniel Libeskind, whose design was selected from among 50 finalists in an international competition. The design saw the Terrace Galleries torn down (the curatorial centre to the south remains) and replaced with a Deconstructivist crystalline-form structure, named after Michael Lee-Chin who pledged million towards its construction. Existing galleries and buildings were also upgraded, along with the installation of multiple new exhibits over a period of months. The first phase of the Renaissance ROM project, the \\"Ten Renovated Galleries in the Historic Buildings\\", opened to the public on 26 December 2005. The architectural opening for the Michael Lee-Chin Crystal, however, took place less than 18 months later, on 2 June 2007. The final cost of the project was about million. The original building was listed by the City of Toronto on the Municipal Heritage Register on 20 June 1973, designated under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act in 2003, with a Heritage Easement on the buildings. Buildings and architecture =Original building and eastern wing= The 1914 Italianate-Neo-Romanesque original building in 1922 Designed by Toronto architects Frank Darling and John A. Pearson, the architectural style of the original building (now the western wing) is a synthesis of Italianate and Neo- Romanesque. The structure is heavily massed and punctuated by rounded and segmented arched windows with heavy surrounds and hood mouldings. Other features include applied decorative eave brackets, quoins and cornices. The eastern wing facing Queen's Park was designed by Alfred H. Chapman and James Oxley. Opened in 1933, it included the museum's elaborate art deco, Byzantine- inspired rotunda and a new main entrance. The linking wing and rear (west) fa√ßade of the Queen's Park wing were originally done in the same yellow brick as the 1914 building, with minor Italianate detailing. However, the Queen's Park fa√ßade of the expansion broke away from the heavy Italianate style of the original structure. It was built in a neo-Byzantine style with rusticated stone, triple windows contained within recessed arches and different-coloured stones arranged in a variety of patterns. This development from the Roman- inspired Italianate to a Byzantine-influenced style reflected the historical development of Byzantine architecture from Roman architecture. Common among neo-Byzantine buildings in North America, the fa√ßade also contains elements of Gothic Revival in its relief carvings, gargoyles and statues. The ornate ceiling of the rotunda is covered predominantly in gold back painted glass mosaic tiles, with coloured mosaic geometric patterns and images of real and mythical animals. The alt= Writing in the Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada in 1933, A.S. Mathers said of the expansion: The original building and the 1933 expansion have been listed since 1973 as heritage buildings of Toronto. In 2005, a major renovation of the heritage wings saw the galleries made larger, windows uncovered, and the original early 20th- century architecture made more prominent. The exteriors of the heritage buildings were cleaned and restored. The restoration of the 1914 and 1933 buildings was the largest heritage project undertaken in Canada. The renovation also included the newly restored Rotunda with reproductions of the original oak doors, a restored axial view from the Rotunda west through to windows onto Philosophers' Walk and ten renovated galleries comprising a total of .ROM Members' News, Winter 2005‚Äì6. In the master plan designed by Darling and Pearson in 1909, the ROM took a form similar to that of J.N.L. Durand's ideal model of the museum. It was envisioned as a square plan with corridors running through the centre of the composition, converging in the middle with a domed rotunda. Overall, it referenced the upper-class palaces of the 17th and 18th centuries and aimed at having a strong sense of monumentality. All the architectural elements‚Äîthe deep cornice, decorative top, eave brackets‚Äîadd to this strength that the ROM possessed, as it was purely a structure with the function of collecting, but not of exhibiting. During the mid-2010s, the original entrance was used as a caf√©. Since late 2017, the original entrance is undergoing renovation to become an alternate entrance, complete with the addition of ramps to the original entrance. =Curatorial centre= Designed by Toronto architect Gene Kinoshita, with Mathers & Haldenby, the curatorial centre forms the southern section of the museum. Completed in 1984, it was built during the same expansion as the former Queen Elizabeth II Terrace Galleries, which stood on the north side of the museum. The architecture is a simple modernist style of poured concrete, glass, and pre-cast concrete and aggregate panels. The curatorial centre houses the museum's administrative and curatorial services and provides storage for artifacts that are not on exhibit. In 2006, the curatorial centre was renamed to Louise Hawley Stone Curatorial Centre in honour of the late Louise Hawley Stone, who devoted herself to the ROM throughout her life, having donated a number of artifacts and various collections to the museum. In her will, she transferred C$49.7 million to the Louise Hawley Stone Charitable Trust, created to help with the upkeep of the building and to the acquisition of new artifacts. =The Crystal= The Michael Lee-Chin Crystal The controversial Michael Lee-Chin \\"Crystal,\\" a multimillion-dollar expansion to the museum designed by Daniel Libeskind, including a new sliding door entrance on Bloor Street, first opened in 2007. The Deconstructivist crystalline form is clad in 25 percent glass and 75 percent aluminum, sitting on top of a steel frame. The Crystal's canted walls do not touch the sides of the existing heritage buildings but are used to close the envelope between the new form and existing walls. These walls act as a pathway for pedestrians to travel safely across \\"The Crystal.\\" The building's design is similar to some of Libeskind's other works, notably the Jewish Museum in Berlin, the London Metropolitan University Graduate Centre and the Fredric C. Hamilton Building at the Denver Art Museum. The steel framework was manufactured and assembled by Walters Inc. of Hamilton, Ontario. The extruded anodized aluminum cladding was fabricated by Josef Gartner in Germany, the only company in the world that can produce the material. The company also provided the titanium cladding for Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. On 1 June 2007, the Governor-General of Canada, Micha√´lle Jean, attended the architectural opening of the \\"Michael Lee-Chin Crystal.\\" This caused controversy because public opinion had been divided concerning the merits of its angular design. On its opening, Globe and Mail architecture critic Lisa Rochon complained that \\"the new ROM rages at the world,\\" was oppressive, angsty and hellish, while others‚Äîperhaps championed by her Toronto Star counterpart, Christopher Hume‚Äîhailed it as a monument. Some critics have gone as far as ranking it as one of the ten ugliest buildings in the world. The project also experienced budget and construction time over- runs, and drew comparisons to the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao for using so-called \\"starchitecture\\" to attract tourism. Hyacinth Gloria Chen Crystal Court is a three-storey high atrium inside The Crystal. The main lobby is a three-story high atrium, named the Hyacinth Gloria Chen Crystal Court. The lobby is overlooked by balconies and flanked by the J.P. Driscoll Family Stair of Wonders and the Spirit House, an interstitial space formed by the intersection of the east and west crystals. Installation of the permanent galleries of the Lee-Chin Crystal began mid-June 2007, after a ten-day period when all the empty gallery spaces were open to the public. Within The Crystal, there is a gift shop, C5 restaurant lounge (closed until further notice), a cafeteria, seven additional galleries and Canada's largest temporary exhibition hall. The galleries added to the Crystal gave different aspects to the ROM: fascinating visuals, architectural artifacts and environment, art, correspondence between object and space and stories within the visuals. The C5 restaurant Lounge is an award-winning designs firm lI BY IV Design Associated Inc. In October 2007, the Lee-Chin Crystal was reported to have suffered from significant water leakage, causing concerns for the building's resilience to weather, especially in the face of the new structure's proximate first winter. Although a two- layer cladding system was incorporated into the design of the Crystal to prevent the formation of dangerous snow loads on the structure, past architectural creations of Daniel Libeskind (including the Denver Art Museum) have also suffered from weather-related complications. =Offsite storage= Collections at the ROM not displayed are stored at the McLaughlin Planetarium and various unclassified and offsite locations around the Greater Toronto Area. Galleries Originally, there were five major galleries at the ROM, one each for the fields of archaeology, geology, mineralogy, paleontology and zoology. In general, the museum pieces were labelled and arranged in a static fashion that had changed little since Edwardian times. For example, the insects' exhibit that lasted up until the 1970s housed a variety of specimens from different parts of the world in long rows of glass cases. Insects of the same genus were pinned to the inside of the cabinet, with only the species name and location found as a description. Used as the museum's lobby, the Samuel Hall Currelly Gallery showcases an assortment of items from the museum's collection. By the 1960s, more interpretive displays were ushered in, among the first being the original dinosaur gallery, established in the mid-1960s. Dinosaur fossils were now staged in dynamic poses against backdrop paintings and models of contemporaneous landscapes and vegetation. The displays became more descriptive and interpretive sometimes, as with the extinction of the woolly mammoth, offering several different leading theories on the issue for the visitor to ponder. This trend continued and up until the present day, the galleries became less staid and more dynamic or descriptive and interpretive. This trend arguably came to a culmination in the 1980s with the opening of The Bat Cave, where a sound system, strobe lights and gentle puffs of air attempts to recreate the experience of walking through a cave as a colony of bats fly out. The original galleries were simply named after their subject material, but in more recent years, individual galleries have been named in honour of sponsors who have donated significant funds or collections to the institution. There are now two main categories of galleries present in the ROM: the Natural History Galleries and the World Culture Galleries. The Samuel Hall Currelly Gallery is an exhibition space on Level 1, connecting the east wing of the museum with its western half. The gallery serves as the building's main lobby past the museum's admission area. As opposed to the most galleries at the Royal Ontario Museum, the Samuel Hall Currelly Gallery is not dedicated to a single subject. Instead, the gallery exhibits an assortment of items from the museum's collection. =Costumes and textiles= The Patricia Harris Gallery of Costumes and Textiles holds around 200 artifacts from the museum's textile and costume collection. The Patricia Harris Gallery of Costumes and Textiles holds about 200 artifacts from the ROM's textile and costume collections. These pieces, which range from the 1st century BC to the present day, are rotated frequently due to their fragility. Throughout time, textiles and fashion have been used to establish identity and allow inferences to be drawn about a culture's social customs, economy and survival. The gallery is devoted to showcasing transformations in textile design, manufacturing, and cultural relevance throughout the ages. Weaving, needlework, printed archeological textiles and silks are all located in this space. =Interactive galleries= The CIBC Discovery Gallery was designed to be a kids' learning zone. It houses three main areas: In the Earth, Around the World and Close to Home. The space is inspired by the ROM's collections and enables children to participate in interactive activities involving touchable artifacts and specimens, costumes, digging for dinosaur bones and examining fossils and meteorites. There is also a special area for pre-schoolers. The Patrick and Barbara Keenan Family Gallery of Hands-On Biodiversity introduces visitors to the complicated relationships which occur among all living things in a fun and interactive space. People of all ages can explore touchable specimens and interactive displays while gallery facilitators help visitors discover the living world around them. Mossy frogs, a touchable shark jaw, snake skin, and a replica fox's den are some of the objects that connect visitors to the diversity and interdependence of plants and animals. =Institute for Contemporary Culture gallery= The Roloff Beny Gallery of the Institute for Contemporary Culture (ICC) hosts the Royal Ontario Museum's contemporary art exhibitions. This high-ceilinged multimedia gallery of approximately serves as the ICC's main exhibition space, typically featuring exhibits that tie in contemporary culture and events, with the museum's natural and world collection. The gallery has featured exhibitions on fashion photography, street art, modern Chinese urban design and architecture, and contemporary Japanese art. In 2018, it exhibited Here We Are: Black Canadian Contemporary Art, featuring Black Canadian artists such as Sandra Brewster, Mich√®le Pearson Clarke, Sylvia D. Hamilton, Bushra Junaid, Charmaine Lurch, and Esmaa Mohamoud. =Natural History galleries= The second floor of the museum contains collections and samples of various animals. The Natural History galleries are all gathered on the second floor of the museum. The gallery contains collections and samples of various animals such as bats, birds, and dinosaur bones and skeletons. The Life in Crisis: Schad Gallery of Biodiversity, designed by Reich+Petch and opened in late 2009, features endangered species, including specimens of a polar bear, a giant panda, a white rhinoceros, a Burmese python, Canadian coral, a leatherback sea turtle, a coelacanth, a Rafflesia flower and many other rare species. Included among these specimens is Bull, a southern white rhinoceros that became a famous conservation success story for his species. There are also recently extinct species displayed, including specimens of a passenger pigeon and a great auk, as well as skeletons of a dodo and a moa with a specimen of a moa egg and many other recently extinct species. The gallery presents the need to protect the natural environment and the need to educate the public about the main causes of extinction‚Äîoverhunting, habitat destruction, and climate change. In September 2009, the gallery received an Award of Excellence by the Association of Registered Interior Designers of Ontario. In addition to showcasing the museum's natural collection, the Schad Gallery also aims to promote the conservation of Earth's biodiversity. The Life in Crisis gallery is organized into three zones exploring the central themes: Life is Diverse, Life is interconnected, and Life is at Risk. \\"Interestingly, biodiversity is a relatively new term popularized in 1985 as a contraction of biological diversity,\\" said Anthony Reich, Principal at Reich+Petch. \\"It's a big subject that's become more relevant to everybody. The challenge was how to tell this big story in a space. We decided to design a dynamic, immersive experience with three core themes that hopefully will make a lasting impression on visitors.\\" The Tallgrass Prairies and Savannas is a part of the gallery that features one of the most endangered and diverse habitats in Ontario. The display features examples of the regions and the efforts by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry to maintain and restore the tallgrass prairies and savannas. The museum has a large collection of birds from past centuries for viewing. The Gallery of Birds has on display many bird specimens from past centuries. The Gallery of Birds is dominated by the broad \\"Birds in flight\\" display where stuffed birds are enclosed in a glass display for visitors to experience. Dioramas allow visitors to learn about the many bird species and how environmental and habitual changes have put bird species in danger of extinction. Pull-out drawers let visitors examine eggs, feathers, footprints and nests more closely. The gallery included exhibits of other extinct species such as the passenger pigeon. These exhibits were later moved to the Schad Gallery. The Royal Ontario Museum purchased a beached blue whale off the coast of Newfoundland at Trout River and displayed its skeleton and heart as a ROM original travelling exhibit until 4 September 2017. The Bat Cave is an immersive experience for visitors that presents over 20 bats and 800 models in a recreated habitat, with accompanying educational panels and video. Originally opened in 1988, the bat cave reopened on 27 February 2010 after extensive renovations. The exhibit most notably includes a recreation of St. Clair Cave located in central Jamaica. The original cave was formed by an underground river that flowed below ground through the limestone and was three kilometres long. This cave was then recreated in the museum based on ROM fieldwork conducted in Jamaica in 1984. A large amount of bat research has been conducted with support from the ROM. In 2011, the ROM hosted a \\"bat workshop\\" connected with the 41st Annual North American Symposium on Bat Research. Earth and space The world's largest faceted cerussite, the Light of the Desert, on display at the Teck Suite of Galleries. The Teck Suite of Galleries: Earth's Treasures features almost 3,000 specimens of minerals, gems, meteorites and rocks ranging from 4.5 billion years ago to the present. These items were found in many different locations including the Earth, Moon and beyond, and represent the world's dynamic geological environment. Notable specimens at the Teck Suite of Galleries include fragments of the Tagish Lake meteorite. The Light of the Desert, the world's largest faceted cerussite, is another notable piece displayed in the gallery. Galleries that are a part of the Teck Suite of Galleries include the Barrick Gold Corporation Gallery, the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame Gallery, the Gallery of Gems and Gold and the Vale Gallery of Minerals. Fossils and evolution The ROM has a collection of fossils from the Jurassic to Cenozoic periods. The Reed Gallery of the Age of Mammals explores the rise of mammals through the Cenozoic Era that followed the extinction of the dinosaurs. There are over 400 specimens from North America and South America in addition to 30 fossil skeletons of extinct mammals. The gallery's entrance begins with mammals that arose shortly after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. A highlight of this gallery is the sabre-toothed nimravid Dinictis. The James and Louise Temerty Galleries of the Age of Dinosaurs and Gallery of the Age of Mammals feature many examples of complete non-avian dinosaur skeletons, as well as those of early birds, reptiles, mammals and marine animals ranging from the Jurassic to Cretaceous periods. The highlight of the exhibit is Gordo, one of the most complete examples of the Barosaurus in North America and the largest dinosaur on display in Canada. The ROM also has Zuul crurivastator in its dinosaur collection, which is one of the most complete examples of an ankylosaurid ever found. =World Culture galleries= The World Culture galleries display a wide variety of objects from around the world. These range from Stone Age implements from China and Africa to 20th-century art and design. In July 2011, the museum added to this collection when a number of new permanent galleries were unveiled. Both the Government of Canada and the Royal Ontario Museum committed $2.75 million toward the project. The galleries are located on the first, third and fourth levels of the museum. Africa, the Americas, Asia- Pacific, and South Asian Exhibits at the Shreyas and Mina Ajmera Gallery of Africa, the Americas and Asia-Pacific, one of several world culture galleries at the museum. The Shreyas and Mina Ajmera Gallery of Africa, the Americas and Asia-Pacific features a collection of 1,400 artifacts that reflect the artistic and cultural traditions of the indigenous peoples from four different geographical areas: Africa, the American continents, the Asia- Pacific region and Oceania. On display are objects such as ceremonial masks, ceramics, and a shrunken head. The Sir Christopher Ondaatje South Asian Gallery holds a diverse collection of objects such as decorative art, armour and sculptures that represents the culture of South Asia.

Canadian The Daphne Cockwell Gallery of Canada: First Peoples provides a look inside the culture of Canada's earliest societies: the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada. The gallery contains more than 1,000 artifacts that help to reveal the economic and social forces that have influenced Native art. The Royal Ontario Museum holds a major but little-known collection of Northwest coast native art and artifacts acquired by the Reverend Dr. Richard Whitfield Large at Bella Bella, British Columbia between 1899 and 1906 known as the R.W. Large Collection. Although the collection is one of the most important Heiltsuk collections in existence because of its unique documentation, there has never been a comprehensive study of it. Subject of the book Bella Bella: A Season of Heiltsuk Art, the collection was also part of the Kaxlaya Gvilas (Heiltsuk) exhibit put together collaboratively with the Heiltsuk Nation and the University of British Columbia. Canoes used by the First Nations at The Daphne Cockwell Gallery of Canada: First Peoples. There is also a rotating display of contemporary Native art, an area dedicated to the works of pioneer artist Paul Kane and a theatre devoted to traditional storytelling. Just outside this gallery, the central staircase winds around the Nisga'a and Haida Crest Poles of the Royal Ontario Museum, one of the museum's iconic objects. The Sigmund Samuel Gallery of Canada is located on the Weston Family Wing, displaying collections of early Canadian memorabilia, the majority of which is historical decorative and pictorial arts, but also includes a number of historical artifacts among other things. The gallery has approximately 560 artifacts on display and covers the period from early European settlement to the beginning of the modern industrial era. The displays are split up into sections to display the strength and weaknesses of the collections reflect the French and British cultural heritage of Canada. A notable item from the museum's collection that are featured at the Sigmund Samuel Gallery of Canada include The Death of General Wolfe by Benjamin West. East Asian The Chinese Galleries comprise four sections: the Bishop White Gallery of Chinese Temple Art, the Joey and Toby Tanenbaum Gallery of China, the Matthews Family Court of Chinese Sculpture and the ROM Gallery of Chinese Architecture. Works on exhibit in the Bishop White Gallery of Chinese Temple Art The Bishop White Gallery of Chinese Temple Art gallery contains three of the world's best- preserved temple wall paintings from the Yuan dynasty (AD 1271‚Äì1386) and a number of wooden sculptures depicting various bodhisattvas from the 12th to 15th centuries.

ROMCAN provides free general admission tickets to participating community and charitable organizations. Each year, thousands of general admission tickets are distributed to these communities. ROMCAN tries to eliminate barriers that might stand between these communities and the museum. Since 2008, ROMCAN developed into a larger community initiative that seeks to enable learning experiences for visitors and organizations. A main goal of the program is to give the museum the power to engage, share and inspire a greater diversity of visitors by trying to break through economic and social barriers. Partners include United Way of Greater Toronto, Boys & Girls Clubs of Canada, The Hospital for Sick Children and the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). In popular culture The novel Calculating God by Canadian science fiction author Robert J. Sawyer is mainly set in the ROM. The novel received nominations for both the Hugo and John W. Campbell Memorial Awards in 2001. In the novel Bugs Potter Live at Nickaninny by Canadian children's author Gordon Korman, one of the primary characters searching for the lost Naka-mee-chee (fictional) tribe was from the ROM. A large part of Life Before Man, a novel by Canadian writer Margaret Atwood, takes place in ROM. Three of the four main characters of the novel work there. The museum is described in the novel in great detail, including the dinosaur gallery with its exhibits, contemporary to the time when the novel takes place. The novel was a finalist for the Governor General's Award. The museum was also filmed in several television shows. It was featured in Zoboomafoo, an American-Canadian children's television series in the season 1 episode \\"Dinosaurs\\", where the Kratt brothers (Chris and Martin) were invited to see the museum's dinosaur bones. The museum was also used as a filming location the police procedural television series Flashpoint for an episode of the third season.

The common theme is of an older car of sufficient historical interest to be collectible and worth preserving or restoring rather than scrapping. Organisations such as the Classic Car Club of America (CCCA) maintain lists of eligible unmodified cars that are called \\"classic\\". These are described as \\"fine\\" or \\"distinctive\\" automobile, either American or foreign built, produced between 1915 and 1948. Post-World War II \\"classic cars\\" are not precisely defined and the term is often applied to any older vehicle. Recognition of Classic status =Canada= The Vintage Car Club of Canada (VCCC) recognizes vehicles that are 25 years old and older.http://www.vccc.com The VCCC is one of the oldest collector car clubs in Canada. It has been a registered Society since the mid 1950s. Each year a different Chapter hosts the annual May Tour in a different geographical location in British Columbia. The VCCC has approximately 2800 members in BC counting spouses. The club has been a continuous member of the (NAACC) National Association of Automobile Clubs of Canada Corporation since 1971. The National Association of Automobile Clubs of Canada (NAACC) recognizes stock and modified vehicles that are 20 years old and older. The National Association of Automobile Clubs of Canada is Federally incorporated as a 'not for profit' Corporation. Operational since 1970 it is one of the largest collector vehicle Associations in North America.http://www.naacc.ca The NAACC is responsible for doing away with 'Duty' at the Canadian border. All vehicles and related parts that are 25 years old or older are 'Duty' free when entered into Canada. As of this writing the NAACC is represented in every Province in Canada. The Association sanctions two major Concours in Canada. The Cobble Beach Concours in Kemble Ontario (Owen Sound) and the Crescent Beach Concours on the west coast (Surrey BC) are sanctioned by the NAACC. = United States = Cars produced in 1915 and older typically fall into the antique class and this includes the \\"Brass Era car\\" that are defined by the Horseless Carriage Club of America (HCCA) as \\"any pioneer gas, steam and electric motor vehicle built or manufactured prior to January 1, 1916.\\" The \\"classic\\" term is often applied loosely by owners to any car. Classics in an American car museum Legally, most states have time-based rules for the definition of \\"historic\\" or \\"classic\\" for purposes such as antique vehicle registration. For example, Maryland defines historic vehicles as 20 calendar years old or older and they \\"must not have been substantially altered, remodeled or remanufactured from the manufacturers original design\\" while West Virginia defines motor vehicles manufactured at least 25 years prior to the current year as eligible for \\"classic\\" car license plates. Despite this, at many American classic car shows, automobiles typically range from the 1920s to the 1970s. Recently, many 1980s and even early 1990s cars are considered being \\"classic automobiles\\". Examples of cars at such shows include the Chevrolet Bel-Air, Ford Model T, Dodge Charger, Ford Deuce Coupe, and 1949 Ford. Meanwhile, the Concours d'Elegance car shows feature prestigious automobiles such as the Cadillac V16 or pre-1940 Rolls-Royce models. There are also terms as \\"modern customs\\", \\"exotics\\", or \\"collectibles\\" that cover cars such as the AMC Gremlin or Ford Pinto. There are differences in the exact identification of a \\"classic car\\". Division by separate eras include: horseless carriages (19th-century experimental automobiles such as the Daimler Motor Carriage), antique cars (brass era cars such as the Model T), and classic cars (typically 1930s cars such as the Cord 812). Some also include muscle cars, with the 1974 model year as the cutoff.  Classic Car Club of America  1932 Nash Advanced Eight - a CCCA \\"Full Classic\\" car The Classic Car Club of America describes a CCCA Classic as a \\"fine\\" or \\"distinctive\\" automobile, either American or foreign built, produced between 1915 and 1948. The CCCA is dedicated to the preservation and enjoyment of select cars that \\"are distinguished by their respective fine design, high engineering standards and superior workmanship.\\" Other differentiating factors - including engine displacement, custom coachwork, and luxury accessories such as power brakes, power clutch, and \\"one-shot\\" or automatic lubrication systems - help determine whether a car is considered a CCCA Classic. The cars on their list \\"represent the pinnacle of engineering, styling and design for their era.\\" Any CCCA member may petition for a vehicle to join the list. Such applications are carefully scrutinized, but rarely is a new vehicle type admitted. Moreover, no commercial vehicles such as hearses, ambulances, or race cars are accepted as a Full Classic. The CCCA maintains this definition of \\"classic car\\" and uses terms such as CCCA Classic or the trademarked Full Classic. The CCCA has estimated that 1,366,843 \\"American Classics\\" were built.  Antique Automobile Club of America  The Antique Automobile Club of America (AACA) recognizes \\"motorized vehicles 25 years old or older, which were built in factories and specifically designed and manufactured for transportation use on public roadways and highways.\\" Judging by the AACA evaluates such vehicles to be in historic or that have \\"been restored to the same state as the dealer could have prepared the vehicle for delivery to the customer.\\" Specified AACA classic vehicles include \\"fine or unusual domestic or foreign automobiles primarily built between and including the years 1925 and 1942.\\"AACA, pp. 4-8 to 4-9 = United Kingdom = There is no fixed definition of a classic car. Two taxation issues do impact however, leading to some people using them as cutoff dates. All cars built over 40 years ago are exempted from paying the annual road tax vehicle excise duty. HM Revenue and Customs define a classic car for company taxation purposes as being over 15 years old and having a value in excess of ¬£15,000. Additionally, popular acclaim through classic car magazines can play an important role in whether a car comes to be regarded as a classic but the definition remains subjective and a matter of opinion. The elimination of depreciation can be a reason for buying a classic car and picking 'future classics' that are current 'bangers' can result in a profit for the buyer as well as providing transport. An immaculate well cared for prestige model with high running costs that impacts its value, but is not yet old enough to be regarded as a classic, could be a good buy, for example. Modern classics Modern classic cars are generally older vehicles, ranging from 15 to 25 years, but are usually not accepted as classics according to the Antique Automobile Club of America.The German term youngtimer describes older vehicles which have not yet become \\"old timer\\" classic cars. In the United Kingdom, the modern classic definition is open to the discretion often by Insurance Brokers and Insurance Companies who regard a Modern Classic as a vehicle that is considered collectible regardless of age.Firebond Insurance PLC Practical Classics Magazine advertising 1997 The usage of the vehicle limited to recreational purposes or restricted mileage is also taken into account.  Classic car styling  There was a worldwide change in styling trends in the immediate years after the end of World War II. The 1946 Crosley and Kaiser- Frazer, for example, changed the traditional discrete replaceable-fender treatment. From this point on, automobiles of all kinds became envelope bodies in basic plan. The CCCA term, \\"antique car\\" has been confined to \\"the functionally traditional designs of the earlier period\\" (mostly pre-war). They tended to have removable fenders, trunk, headlights, and a usual vertical grill treatment. In a large vehicle, such as a Duesenberg, Pierce-Arrow, or in a smaller form, the MG TC, with traditional lines, might typify the CCCA term. Another vehicle might be a classic example of a later period but not a car from the \\"classic period of design\\", in the opinion of the CCCA. Fraud Classic cars are subject to various types of fraud, most notably provenance fraud, where owners falsify documentation and serial numbers in order to make a car's history seem more colorful and historic. Fraud also assumes the form of knowingly inflating a car's estimated resale value, as was referenced in court proceedings relating to JD Classics, hitherto one of the UK's largest and best-known classic car dealers prior to its collapse in 2018. Emission levels Classic cars are typically built to meet the national car emission levels that were present in the year of production of the vehicle. EU and US emission standards have increased in many countries since then. As a result, they may not be allowed to enter cities with special emission restrictions or low emission zones.Paris Bans Vehicles Built before 1997Paris just banned all cars built before 1997 to fight air pollutionEMISSIONS ZONES TO HALT CLASSIC ROAD TRIPS?London ULEZ: 9 things classic car drivers need to know Converting the car to run on a different fuel (i.e. SVO, LPG, CNG, hydrogen, ...) may decrease emission levels.Natural gas combustion delivers 20% lower carbon emissions and about a 25% GHG reduction compared to gasoline enginesAlternative Fuels Data CenterCan I convert an older vehicle to something more environmentally-friendly? Safety  Car accident in 1930 Drivers of classic cars must be especially careful. Classic cars often lack what is now considered basic safety features, including seat belts, crumple zones or rollover protection. In September 2009, ABC News' Good Morning America and World News showed a U.S. Insurance Institute of Highway Safety crash test of a 2009 Chevrolet Malibu in an offset head-on collision with a 1959 Chevrolet Bel Air sedan. It dramatically demonstrated the effectiveness of modern car safety design, over 1950s X-frame design, particularly of rigid passenger safety cells and crumple zones. The 1959 Chevrolets used an X frame design which lacked structural rigidity; had the IIHS used a pre-1958 Chevrolet with a perimeter frame design, the results would have been much better. Vehicle handling characteristics (particularly steering and suspension) and brake performance are likely to be poorer than current standards, hence requiring greater road-awareness on the part of the driver. In certain areas of the United States, using a classic car as a daily vehicle is strongly discouraged and may even be considered illegal in some places. The British AA motoring association has urged motorists using or driving near classic cars to pay particular attention to safety. The issue received particular public attention following a 2013 case in which a driver in a hire 1963 MGB was killed immediately in a collision with a taxi. Retro-styled (color-coded with chromed buckles) 2-point and 3-point seat (safety) belts are manufactured according to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). However, most classic car bodies (manufactured before the late 1960s) did not include safety belts as standard equipment, and do not include readily available reinforced mounting points, on the vehicle body, therefore it can be problematic to install such equipment properly: specific studies and calculations should be performed before any attempts. Proper installation is critical, which means locating attachment points on the body/frame, assuring the strength by proper reinforcement, and following the seat belt installation instructions properly to reduce the risk of malfunction or failure.Interior Insights: What You Need to Know When Installing Aftermarket Seat Belts ‚Äì Hotrod & Restoration Some classic car owners are reluctant to retrofit seat belts for the loss of originality this modification implies. There have also been instances of cars losing points at shows for being retrofitted with seat belts. Fitting modern tires is also a suggestion to improve the handling. However, most modern tires may be much wider and have a lower profile than those used on classic cars when new, therefore they may interfere with suspension elements and the tire walls may become damaged. The suspension of a classic car may not be suitable for radial ply tyres, having been designed to only accommodate bias ply tires. Narrow classic car wheels may have been designed for narrow high-profile tube tires and not be suitable for modern tubeless radial tires. Another problem with modern tires on classic cars is that increased grip requires increased steering effort; many classic cars do not come with power steering. Many major tire companies have dedicated classic car tire marketing departments and will be able to give expert technical advice to address all these issues. It is important to know how radial tires will affect the performance of a car originally fitted with bias-ply tires, and the considerations needed to compensate for the differences. Upgrading braking using either bespoke parts, parts produced by the vehicle's manufacturer, from later versions of the same model or later models that may be compatible with minor modification, is an effective method of improving safety. Popular examples include drum brake to disc brake conversions, or adding a vacuum servo to cars with front disc brakes that did not originally have one. Although they lack such advanced safety features as air bags, antilock braking systems, and other electronic controls, most US-market cars built 1966 and later have basic safety features such as padded dashboards, seat belts, dual-circuit braking systems, and safety glass. Despite these concerns, classic cars are involved in significantly fewer accidents.

The chain was founded in 1919 in Ontario and was later acquired by the Argus Corporation. It was later sold to The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company (A&P;), which restricted the chain to the Greater Toronto Area. Stores outside Ontario were converted to the A&P; banner or sold to third parties. A&P;'s Canadian division was later acquired by Metro Inc., which rebranded the remaining Dominion stores to its namesake banner in 2008. History Dominion started from one Toronto store on May 23, 1919. The store was founded by American businessmen Robert Jackson of New Hampshire and William J. Pentland of Connecticut. Pentland was manager of A&P; stores in Connecticut and was hired by Jackson. By the end of 1919, they had a 20-store chain of which 18 were acquired from rival Loblaws. A year later, they had 61 stores. In 1929, Dominion tried to acquire a stake in Loblaws, but the stock market crash ended the growth. During the Depression, Dominion lost both founders: Jackson went bankrupt and Pentland was killed in an auto accident in 1933. Dominion's leadership was not resolved until 1939, when J. William Horsey became president. He in turn sold Dominion Stores to Argus Corporation. Smaller stores were consolidated from 574 to 195 by 1954. In the 1950s, Dominion began to build large stores with airy ceilings and large glass fronts. The chain also expanded beyond Toronto to other parts of Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Manitoba,http://www.thecentremall.com/history.php Saskatchewan and Atlantic Canada. In 1978, Conrad Black took control of the Argus Corporation. Moving the Dominion holdings into the Hollinger Inc. portion of Argus, Dominion was stripped of cash from the daily flow. Dominion Stores were acquired by A&P;'s Canadian division, A&P; Canada, from Hollinger in 1985, the final year of Black's sell off of virtually all previous holdings of Argus Corporation. Some Dominion locations, rebranded \\"Mr. Grocer\\" in an attempt to break union contracts and convert company-owned stores to franchise locations, were not part of the A&P; transaction. These were sold to National Grocers, which phased out the \\"Mr. Grocer\\" brand and signage. In the 1990s, A&P; rebranded all of its stores in the Greater Toronto Area as Dominion stores, absorbing Miracle Food Mart, while Dominion locations elsewhere in Ontario took the A&P; or Food Basics name. The territory of Dominion stores was approximately the following: Toronto; York Region, excluding Stouffville; Mississauga and Oakville; and Pickering and Ajax. In northwestern Ontario, Safeway acquired at least two stores in Thunder Bay. (Safeway's presence in Thunder Bay prevents Metro from offering Air Miles at its Thunder Bay locations.) In Western Canada, Dominion stores were closed, leaving many suburban shopping malls scrambling to fill large, now-vacant sections. This event, coupled with the subsequent collapse of several department store chains, sparked a wave of mall renovations in many parts of the country. Alberta stores were acquired by Safeway in the late 1960s. The remainder of the chain in eastern Canada was acquired by Loblaw Companies, through several unrelated transactions: * Newfoundland: Dominion stores in Newfoundland were sold to local owners, who then resold them to Loblaw in 1995. The Newfoundland locations are the only ones to continue under the Dominion banner; see Dominion Stores (Newfoundland). * New Brunswick: Shortly after the A&P; acquisition, these stores were sold to Food Group Inc., which operated them under the Village banner until Food Group was sold to Loblaw and merged into its Atlantic Superstore unit in 1995. * Nova Scotia: These locations were sold to Oshawa Group and became IGA stores. However, after Sobeys purchased Oshawa in 1999, Loblaw took over IGA's Atlantic Canada locations * Quebec: Dominion stores in Quebec were sold to Provigo in 1981; (in French) Provigo was acquired by Loblaws in 1998. Demise Exterior of a typical Dominion store (at Don Mills Centre in Don Mills, Toronto, Ontario), prior to re-branding as Metro in late 2008 Metro, which had operated solely in Quebec and the Ottawa area, acquired A&P; Canada from the U.S.-based parent company effective August 15, 2005. A&P; retained a minority ownership share of the combined company for a time. On August 7, 2008, Metro announced it would invest $200 million consolidating the company's conventional food stores under the Metro banner. Over a period of 15 months, all stores were converted to the Metro name, beginning with the Dominion stores in the Toronto area.

The stores range in from 45,000 to over 120,000 square feet (4,000 to over 10,000 m¬≤) in size. Store services Despite the similarity in name to sister chain Real Canadian Superstore, not all Atlantic Superstores are hypermarkets: many are large supermarkets with little general merchandise. Others, however, are marketed as \\"one stop\\" stores (much like Real Canadian Superstore) and carry a wide variety of goods, including groceries, electronics, housewares, clothing, and generally offer services such as photo finishing and a pharmacy. Some larger stores (60,000 to over 80,000 square feet) also have a community room, drive-through pharmacy, Mobil gas bar, liquor store (operated by the applicable provincial agency), tobacco shop, and walk-in medical clinics. Halifax, Nova Scotia store located in Bayers Lake.thumb Atlantic Superstore has added self checkout registers at its larger stores which allow customers to scan the barcode of an item and make payment without any interaction with store employees. Starting on April 22, 2009, some locations began charging 5 cents per plastic bag at checkouts, to promote the use of environmentally friendly reusable bags. On March 1, 2010 this practice was stopped. However, at least one location is \\"bagless\\" meaning that it has phased out disposable plastic bags entirely, requiring customers to either bring their own means of carrying their purchases, or else buy in-store reusable fabric bags.https://www.atlanticsuperstore.ca/store- locator/Atlantic+Superstore+-+Quinpool+Road/0383?storeId=0383 In December 2017, click and collect, under the PC Express banner began in Atlantic Canada, starting with Atlantic Superstore locations in Halifax. History Loblaw entered Atlantic Canada through the acquisition of Atlantic Wholesalers, owner of the SaveEasy chain, in 1976. In 1986, the company opened its first large- scale grocery store in Moncton, New Brunswick, using the name The Real Atlantic Superstore. In 1995 the name was shortened to the present one and the store designs were reformatted to the \\"market style\\" with the slogan \\"Low Prices and More!\\" Most SaveEasy stores, excluding those in rural areas, were eventually converted to the SuperValu or Superstore format, either through renovation or relocation. During the 1990s, the company's headquarters were relocated from Sackville to Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. New warehousing facilities for just in time logistics distribution were built, and a huge expansion campaign brought new large-format stores to many centres in the region within a period of only several years. In the early 2000s, a marketing campaign was introduced to the superstores, changing their slogan to \\"Eat Well, Spend Less\\". This was similar to a campaign carried out in Loblaws stores in Ontario. With the arrival of the Real Canadian Superstore concept in Ontario, Atlantic Superstore used a similar marketing campaign with the slogan \\"Prices You Can Trust\\". This concept was used until 2009 when the \\"Just Lower Prices\\" campaign was launched. Some Atlantic Superstore locations will be switched to No Frills depending on the stores demographic.

Brief Encounter: Ferruccio Busoni. Tempo (New Series), pp 7-7 Werner Wolff's mother discouraged her son's early interest in music as a profession, so he took a law degree at Baden, but continued to compose music as an avocation. Encouraged in his interest by prominent musicians in Berlin, he studied at the conservatory at Leipzig during the years before World War I. Following his musical training, Wolff took positions with opera companies in Danzig, D√ºsseldorf, and Prague before becoming a conductor for the Hamburg Opera in 1917. He continued with the Hamburg Opera until 1932, developing a reputation as one of the leading conductors in Germany. Wolff and his wife, operatic soprano Emmy Land, emigrated to the United States in 1938, fleeing Nazism. They resided in New York City until Wolff was employed as head of the music department at Tennessee Wesleyan College in Athens, Tennessee and Land became voice and music teacher at the same school. In the early 1940s they were hired by the University of Chattanooga and the Cadek Conservatory of Chattanooga, Tennessee as teachers. In 1942 Dr. Wolff wrote a book entitled Anton Bruckner, rustic genius (). Interested citizens learned of the Wolffs' operatic expertise from their great success in Europe (mainly in Hamburg, Vienna) and asked them to organize a Chattanooga Opera Association which they did in 1943. Madame Emmy Land Wolff died in 1955 and Dr. Wolff retired from opera five years later and returned to Ruschlikon, Switzerland, where he died in 1961. Many feel that this couple created a sensation with their opera productions in Chattanooga. The opera company they founded (now part of the Chattanooga Symphony and Opera) is still active.

Early life, education and family  Williston was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts to a family prosperous from the mercantile trade but whose fortunes declined during his youth, which he recalled, \\"served as a spur to endeavor.\\"quoted in He was graduated from Harvard College in 1882 and worked for three years as a survey assistant for a railroad and teaching at a boarding school. An aunt's bequest enabled him to enroll in Harvard Law School, where he thrived. In Chapter 1, Todd Peppers, \\"Birth of an Institution, Horace Gray and the Lost Law Clerks\\" He was an editor of the first volume of the Harvard Law Review, and in 1888 he graduated first in his class with LL.B. and M.A. degrees. On September 12, 1889, he married Mary Fairlie Wellman.Warren, Charles (1908). History of the Harvard Law School and of early legal conditions in America Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ. Press. p 192.They had two daughters: Dorothea Lewis Williston (Mrs. Murray F. Hall), and Margaret Fairlie Williston (Mrs. Chester B. McLaughlin, Jr.). His wife died in 1929.  Legal career  Early in Williston's career, from 1888 to 1889 he worked as the private secretary to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Horace Gray. In the summer of 1889, he helped to collate laws from various U.S. states in order to help formulate the state constitutions of North Dakota and South Dakota. From 1895 to 1938, Williston was a law professor at Harvard Law School, and in 1910, he briefly served as acting dean. In 1903, he was named Weld Professor and, in 1919, was named to the Dane Professorship at Harvard. Students described him as \\"a gentle, good-humored teacher who charmed his classes with hypothetical cases involving his horse, Dobbin, and who regularly invited students to dine with his family on Sundays,\\" and \\"a master of the Socratic method.\\" Memory of Williston's student, Professor Frederick Bernays Wiener. Amongst his most important contributions at this time were the drafting of four laws aimed at providing national commerce with a legally uniform architecture. The Uniform Laws of Sales (1906), Warehouse Receipts (1906), Bills of Lading (1909), and Stock Transfers (1909) would in fact serve as precedents for the construction of the Uniform Commercial Code some decades later. On December 10 and 11, 1913, Williston unsuccessfully argued for the defense in the case of Boston & Maine Railroad v. Hooker233 U.S. 97 (1914) before the U.S. Supreme Court. He became a consultant for the Boston law firm Hale & Dorr, during which time he was involved in cases such as Kneeland v. American Loan Trust Company136 U.S. 89 (1890). and Chase National Bank v. Sayles.11 F.2d 948 (1st Cir. 1926).  Treatise on contracts  Williston wrote five volumes of his legal treatise, \\"The Law of Contracts\\", which was first published during the span of 1920 to 1922. The treatise was widely acclaimed as the foremost authority on the topic and was later enlarged in 1938. As Michael Looney noted in the Boston College Law Review (of the 3rd edition): \\"In the forty years since the original edition appeared, it has gained a pre-eminent place in that field. Quoted or cited by the courts of the United States, Great Britain, and its Dominions as well, it has become the standard authority.\\" In 1932, Williston served as reporter for the First Restatement of Contracts, a highly influential publication in the legal community. This treatise continues to exist to this day, currently edited by Richard A. Lord, professor at Campbell University Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law.  Honors and legacy  Williston received accolades both during his lifetime and at the time of his death. In 1905, Williston was made a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded honorary degrees by Harvard, 1910; Amherst, 1923; and Yale, 1926. In 1929, he was honored with the very first American Bar Association Medal for \\"conspicuous service to American jurisprudence.\\"Samuel Williston: Dean of America's Legal Profession In a 1963 Harvard Law Review essay, Justice Felix Frankfurter lauded Williston as being the \\"greatest artist in teaching.\\" His statement of rules helped make commercial law predictable: \\"The business life of this nation is based on the writings and the legislation that Samuel Williston drafted,\\" said Harvard Law Professor Arthur E. Sutherland. Quoting Arthur Sutherland. He, his work and his insistence on contractual formalism are often compared and contrasted to those of Yale Law School professor Arthur Linton Corbin, developer of the philosophy of law known as legal realism. Corbin was the writer of Corbin on Contracts and his influence is more evident in the Uniform Commercial Code and the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. He lived to 101 years of age in spite of ill health in his mid-thirties that interfered with his teaching. Williston is the namesake of the Williston Negotiation Competition at Harvard Law School.

It behaves locally just like the real line, but has different large-scale properties (e.g., it is neither Lindel√∂f nor separable). Therefore, it serves as one of the basic counterexamples of topology. Intuitively, the usual real-number line consists of a countable number of line segments [0, 1) laid end-to-end, whereas the long line is constructed from an uncountable number of such segments.  Definition  The closed long ray L is defined as the cartesian product of the first uncountable ordinal œâ1 with the half-open interval [0, 1), equipped with the order topology that arises from the lexicographical order on œâ1 √ó [0, 1). The open long ray is obtained from the closed long ray by removing the smallest element (0,0). The long line is obtained by putting together a long ray in each direction. More rigorously, it can be defined as the order topology on the disjoint union of the reversed open long ray (‚Äúreversed‚Äù means the order is reversed) and the (not reversed) closed long ray, totally ordered by letting the points of the latter be greater than the points of the former. Alternatively, take two copies of the open long ray and identify the open interval {0} √ó (0, 1) of the one with the same interval of the other but reversing the interval, that is, identify the point (0, t) (where t is a real number such that 0 < t < 1) of the one with the point (0,1 ‚àí t) of the other, and define the long line to be the topological space obtained by gluing the two open long rays along the open interval identified between the two. (The former construction is better in the sense that it defines the order on the long line and shows that the topology is the order topology; the latter is better in the sense that it uses gluing along an open set, which is clearer from the topological point of view.) Intuitively, the closed long ray is like a real (closed) half-line, except that it is much longer in one direction: we say that it is long at one end and closed at the other. The open long ray is like the real line (or equivalently an open half- line) except that it is much longer in one direction: we say that it is long at one end and short (open) at the other. The long line is longer than the real lines in both directions: we say that it is long in both directions. However, many authors speak of the ‚Äúlong line‚Äù where we have spoken of the (closed or open) long ray, and there is much confusion between the various long spaces. In many uses or counterexamples, however, the distinction is unessential, because the important part is the ‚Äúlong‚Äù end of the line, and it doesn't matter what happens at the other end (whether long, short, or closed). A related space, the (closed) extended long ray, L*, is obtained as the one- point compactification of L by adjoining an additional element to the right end of L. One can similarly define the extended long line by adding two elements to the long line, one at each end.  Properties  The closed long ray L = œâ1 √ó [0,1) consists of an uncountable number of copies of [0,1) 'pasted together' end-to-end. Compare this with the fact that for any countable ordinal Œ±, pasting together Œ± copies of [0,1) gives a space which is still homeomorphic (and order-isomorphic) to [0,1). (And if we tried to glue together more than œâ1 copies of [0,1), the resulting space would no longer be locally homeomorphic to R.) Every increasing sequence in L converges to a limit in L; this is a consequence of the facts that (1) the elements of œâ1 are the countable ordinals, (2) the supremum of every countable family of countable ordinals is a countable ordinal, and (3) every increasing and bounded sequence of real numbers converges. Consequently, there can be no strictly increasing function L‚ÜíR. In fact, every continuous function L‚ÜíR is eventually constant. As order topologies, the (possibly extended) long rays and lines are normal Hausdorff spaces. All of them have the same cardinality as the real line, yet they are 'much longer'. All of them are locally compact. None of them is metrizable; this can be seen as the long ray is sequentially compact but not compact, or even Lindel√∂f. The (non-extended) long line or ray is not paracompact. It is path-connected, locally path-connected and simply connected but not contractible. It is a one-dimensional topological manifold, with boundary in the case of the closed ray. It is first-countable but not second countable and not separable, so authors who require the latter properties in their manifolds do not call the long line a manifold.. It makes sense to consider all the long spaces at once because every connected (non- empty) one-dimensional (not necessarily separable) topological manifold possibly with boundary, is homeomorphic to either the circle, the closed interval, the open interval (real line), the half-open interval, the closed long ray, the open long ray, or the long line.. The long line or ray can be equipped with the structure of a (non-separable) differentiable manifold (with boundary in the case of the closed ray). However, contrary to the topological structure which is unique (topologically, there is only one way to make the real line \\"longer\\" at either end), the differentiable structure is not unique: in fact, there are uncountably many (2^{\\\\aleph_1} to be precise) pairwise non- diffeomorphic smooth structures on it. This is in sharp contrast to the real line, where there are also different smooth structures, but all of them are diffeomorphic to the standard one. The long line or ray can even be equipped with the structure of a (real) analytic manifold (with boundary in the case of the closed ray). However, this is much more difficult than for the differentiable case (it depends on the classification of (separable) one- dimensional analytic manifolds, which is more difficult than for differentiable manifolds). Again, any given C‚àû structure can be extended in infinitely many ways to different Cœâ (=analytic) structures (which are pairwise non-diffeomorphic as analytic manifolds). The long line or ray cannot be equipped with a Riemannian metric that induces its topology. The reason is that Riemannian manifolds, even without the assumption of paracompactness, can be shown to be metrizable. The extended long ray L* is compact. It is the one- point compactification of the closed long ray L, but it is also its Stone-ƒåech compactification, because any continuous function from the (closed or open) long ray to the real line is eventually constant. L* is also connected, but not path-connected because the long line is 'too long' to be covered by a path, which is a continuous image of an interval. L* is not a manifold and is not first countable.  p-adic analog  There exists a p-adic analog of the long line, which is due to George Bergman. This space is constructed as the increasing union of an uncountable directed set of copies XŒ≥ of the ring of p-adic integers, indexed by a countable ordinal Œ≥. Define a map from XŒ¥ to XŒ≥ whenever Œ¥<Œ≥ as follows: *If Œ≥ is a successor Œµ+1 then the map from XŒµ to XŒ≥ is just multiplication by p. For other Œ¥ the map from XŒ¥ to XŒ≥ is the composition of the map from XŒ¥ to XŒµ and the map from XŒµ to XŒ≥ *If Œ≥ is a limit ordinal then the direct limit of the sets XŒ¥ for Œ¥<Œ≥ is a countable union of p-adic balls, so can be embedded in XŒ≥, as XŒ≥ with a point removed is also a countable union of p-adic balls. This defines compatible embeddings of XŒ¥ into XŒ≥ for all Œ¥<Œ≥. This space is not compact, but the union of any countable set of compact subspaces has compact closure. Higher dimensions Some examples of non-paracompact manifolds in higher dimensions include the Pr√ºfer manifold, products of any non-paracompact manifold with any non-empty manifold, the ball of long radius, and so on. The bagpipe theorem shows that there are 2‚Ñµ1 isomorphism classes of non-paracompact surfaces. There are no complex analogues of the long line as every Riemann surface is paracompact, but gave an example of a non-paracompact complex manifold of complex dimension 2.

It uses a long line, called the main line, with baited hooks attached at intervals by means of branch lines called snoods (or gangions).Method and Apparatus for Long Line and Recreational Bait Fishing Patent application 20080202013. 28 August 2008. A snood is a short length of line, attached to the main line using a clip or swivel, with the hook at the other end. Longlines are classified mainly by where they are placed in the water column. This can be at the surface or at the bottom. Lines can also be set by means of an anchor, or left to drift. Hundreds or even thousands of baited hooks can hang from a single line. Longliners ‚Äì fishing vessels rigged for longlining ‚Äì commonly target swordfish, tuna, halibut, sablefish and many other species.European Union: Identifying Maltese fishing grounds In some unstable fisheries, such as the Patagonian toothfish, fishermen may be limited to as few as 25 hooks per line. In contrast, commercial longliners in certain robust fisheries of the Bering Sea and North Pacific generally run over 2,500 hand-baited hooks on a single series of connected lines many miles in length.Rice J, Cooper J, Medley P and Hough A (2006) South Georgia Patagonian Toothfish Longline Fishery Moody Marine. Longlines can be set to hang near the surface (pelagic longline) to catch fish such as tuna and swordfish or along the sea floor (demersal longline) for groundfish such as halibut or cod. Longliners fishing for sablefish, also referred to as black cod, occasionally set gear on the sea floor at depths exceeding using relatively simple equipment. Longlines with traps attached rather than hooks can be used for crab fishing in deep waters. Longline fishing is prone to the incidental catching and killing of dolphins, seabirds, sea turtles, and sharks, but can be considerably more ecologically sustainable than some other commercially significant harvesting methods. Incidental catch alt=Photo of thousands of birds feeding at water surface next to fishing boat alt=Photo of single bird attempting to fly away Longline fishing is controversial in some areas because of bycatch, fish caught while seeking another species or immature juveniles of the target species. This can cause many issues, such as the killing of many other marine animals while seeking certain commercial fish. Seabirds can be particularly vulnerable during the setting of the line. Methods to mitigate incidental mortality have succeeded in some fisheries. Mitigation techniques include the use of weights to ensure the lines sink quickly, the deployment of streamer lines to scare away birds, setting lines only at night in low light (to avoid attracting birds), limiting fishing seasons to the southern winter (when most seabirds are not feeding young), and not discharging offal while setting lines. The Hawaii-based longline fishery for swordfish was closed in 2000 over concerns of excessive sea turtle by-catch, particularly loggerhead sea turtles and leatherback turtles. Changes to the management rules allowed the fishery to reopen in 2004. Gear modification, particularly a change to large circle-hooks and mackerel-type baits, eliminated much of the sea turtle by-catch associated with the fishing technique. It has been claimed that one consequence of the closure was that 70 Hawaii-based vessels were replaced by 1,500-1,700 longline vessels from various Asian nations, but this is not based on any reliable data . Due to poor and often non-existent catch documentation by these vessels, the number of sea turtles and albatross caught by these vessels between 2000 and 2004 will never be known . Hawaii longline fishing for swordfish closed again on 17 March 2006, when the by-catch limit of 17 loggerhead turtles was reached. In 2010 the by-catch limit for loggerhead turtles was raised, but was restored to the former limit as a result of litigation. The Hawaii-based longline fisheries for tuna and swordfish are managed under sets of slightly different rules. The tuna fishery is one of the best managed fisheries in the world, according to the UN Code of Responsible Fishing, but has been criticized by others as being responsible for continuing by-catch of false killer whales, seabirds, and other nontargeted wildlife, as well as placing pressure on depleted bigeye tuna stocks. Commercial longline fishing is also one of the main threats to albatrosses. Of the 22 albatross species recognized in the IUCN Red List, six are threatened, and nine are vulnerable. The IUCN lists three species as critically endangered: the Amsterdam albatross, the Tristan albatross and the waved albatross. The remaining four are near threatened. Albatrosses and other seabirds which readily feed on offal are attracted to the set bait, become hooked on the lines and drown. An estimated 8,000 albatross per year are killed in this way.Brothers NP. 1991. \\"Albatross mortality and associated bait loss in the Japanese longline fishery in the southern ocean.\\" Biological Conservation 55: 255‚Äì268. A simple device which can be fitted onto longlines, known as Hookpod, has been proposed for mitigation of seabird bycatch; Hookpod was rolled out to a total of 15 commercial fishing vessels in New Zealand after a change in regulations in January 2020, with a result of zero seabird bycatch in the first 6 monthshttps://www.hookpod.com/blog/celebrating-zero-seabird-bycatch.

Biography He was born in the Free Imperial City of Besan√ßon, now in France, then a self-governing city surrounded by the Imperial territory of the County of Burgundy (Franche-Comt√©). His father, Nicholas Perrenot de Granvelle (1484‚Äì1550), afterwards became chancellor of the empire under Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, held an influential position in the Netherlands, and from 1530 until his death he was one of the emperor's most trusted advisers in Germany. On the completion of his studies in law at Padua and in divinity at Leuven,Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle, Catholic Encyclopedia Antoine held a canonry at Besan√ßon, nowadays in eastern France, then was promoted to the bishopric of Arras with a dispensation due to his age of barely twenty-three (1540). He was ordained into the priesthood in 1540. In his episcopal capacity he attended several diets of the empire, as well as the opening meetings of the Council of Trent, which he addressed on behalf of Charles V. The influence of his father, now chancellor, led to Granvelle being entrusted with many difficult and delicate pieces of public business. In the execution of these tasks he developed a talent for diplomacy, while at the same time acquiring an intimate acquaintance with most of the currents of European politics. He was involved in the settlement of the terms of peace after the defeat of the Schmalkaldic League at the Battle of M√ºhlberg in 1547, a settlement in which, to say the least, some particularly sharp practice was exhibited. In 1550, he succeeded his father in the office of secretary of state; in this capacity he attended Charles in the war with Maurice of Saxony, accompanied him in the flight from Innsbruck, and afterwards drew up the Peace of Passau (August 1552). In the following year he and Simon Renard, the ambassador of Charles V to the Queen Mary I of England, conducted the negotiations for the marriage of Mary and Philip II of Spain. It was to Philip in 1555, on the abdication of the emperor, that Granvelle transferred his services, and by whom he was employed in the Netherlands. In April 1559 Granvelle was one of the Spanish commissioners who arranged the Peace of Cateau Cambr√©sis, and on Philip's withdrawal from the Netherlands in August of the same year he was surreptitiously appointed chief councillor to the regent Margaret of Parma. The policy of repression which in this capacity he pursued during the next five years secured for him many tangible rewards: in 1560 he was elevated to the archepiscopal see of Mechelen, and in 1561 he became a cardinal; but the growing hostility of a people whose religious convictions he had set himself to oppose ultimately made it impossible for him to continue in the Netherlands; and on the advice of his royal master he retired to Franche- Comt√© in March 1564. After a visit to Rome in 1565; in November 1566 he was appointed as member of the Congregation of \\"Principi\\", the centre of the Papal States' foreign policy, by Pope Pius V. In 1570, Granvelle, at the request of Philip, helped to arrange the alliance between the Papacy, Venice and Spain against the Turks, an alliance which was responsible for the victory of Lepanto the next year. In the same year he became viceroy of Naples, a post of some difficulty and danger, which for five years he occupied with ability and success. He was summoned to Madrid in 1575 by Philip II to be president of the council for Italian affairs. Among the more delicate negotiations of his later years were those of 1580, which had for their object the ultimate union of the crowns of Spain and Portugal, and those of 1584, which resulted in a check to France by the marriage of the Spanish infanta Catherine to Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy. In the same year he was made archbishop of Besan√ßon, but meanwhile he had been stricken with a lingering disease; he was never enthroned, but died at Madrid in 1586. His body was taken to Besan√ßon Cathedral, where his father had been buried. His tomb is in Mechelen cathedral. Collector of art Granvelle had a famous art collection, which partly featured the favourite artists of his Habsburg patrons, such as Titian and Leone Leoni, but also included a number of works by Pieter Brueghel, as well as a significant collection inherited from his father. Brueghel's friend, the sculptor Jacques Jonghelinck (brother of Brueghel's biggest patron) had a studio in Granvelle's palace in Brussels. Whilst in the Netherlands, he \\"discovered\\" Antonis Mor and introduced him to the Madrid court, and he also patronised Giambologna and arranged his first visit to Italy. At his death the collection was inherited by his nephew, who was pressured by Rudolf II, the very acquisitive Austrian Habsburg Emperor, to sell the finest pieces to him, which in 1597 he very reluctantly did, protesting that the price offered for thirty-three works was not enough even for six, and less than he had recently refused from Cardinal Farnese for D√ºrer's Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand alone. The arrangements were handled by Hans von Aachen. Most of these pieces are now in Vienna or Madrid, including Titian's Venus with an Organ-player, Giambologna's copy of the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, tapestries after cartoons by Hieronymus Bosch and a bust of Charles V by Leoni. Though he was painted by TitianThe portrait is at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City. and Mor, more famous than any portrait of Granvelle himself is the portrait of his dwarf and his mastiff by Mor, now at the Mus√©e du Louvre.Louvre On-line Catalog which perhaps initiated the Spanish tradition of portraits of court dwarfs. The Flemish Renaissance humanist Justus Lipsius was Granvelle's secretary for a period in Rome. He also corresponded with the composers Lassus and Adrian Willaert He had a magnificent library, some of which remains at Besan√ßon.Exposition des livres du cardinal de Granvelle √† la Biblioth√®que municipale de Besan√ßon, Besan√ßon, 1986: liste dactylographi√©e des ouvrages expos√©s.

Like the similarly-issued retailer coupons, these stamps only had a minimal cash value of a few mils (thousandths of a dollar) individually, but when a customer accumulated a number of them, they could be exchanged with the trading stamp company (usually a third-party issuer of the stamps) for premiums, such as toys, personal items, housewares, furniture and appliances. History = Origin = The practice of retailers issuing trading stamps started in 1891 at Schuster's Department Store, Wisconsin. At first, the stamps were given only to customers who paid for purchases in cash as a reward for not making purchases on credit. Other retailers soon copied the practice of giving trading stamps that could be redeemed at the issuer's store. One example was L. H. Parke Company a Philadelphia and Pittsburgh manufacturer and distributor of food products that included coffee, tea and spices along with canned goods. They established a trading stamp program in 1895 under the name Parke's Blue Point Trading Stamps for customers who purchased Parke's products in grocery stores in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The program was successful. Parke established showrooms in their headquarters buildings in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh where customers could inspect and obtain premium goods. = Independent trading stamp companies = Plaid Stamps sign at Cracker Barrel restaurant in Lubbock, TexasIn 1896 the Sperry and Hutchinson Company was created as an independent trading stamp company in the United States. By 1957 there were approximately 200 trading stamp companies in operation. Typically, merchants would pay a third-party trading stamp company for the stamps, and would then advertise that they give trading stamps with purchases. Large retailers were usually given a discount on the stamps while smaller retailers generally had to pay the full cost of adopting the trading stamp program. The intent was to get customers to be loyal to the merchant, so that they would continue shopping there to obtain enough stamps to redeem for merchandise. Customers would fill books with stamps, and take the books to a trading stamp company redemption center to exchange them for premiums. Books could also be sent to the trading stamp company in exchange for premium merchandise via mail order catalogs. An example of the value of trading stamps would be during the 1970s and 1980s where the typical rate issued by a merchant was one stamp for each 10¬¢ of merchandise purchased. A typical book took approximately 1200 stamps to fill, or the equivalent of US $120.00 in purchases. While one of the most popular brand of trading stamps in the US were S&H; Green Stamps, informally known as \\"green stamps\\", other large brands included Top Value Stamps, Gold Bond Stamps, Plaid Stamps, Blue Chip Stamps, Quality Stamps, Buccaneer Stamps and Gold Strike Stamps. Texas Gold Stamps were given in Texas mainly by the H-E-B grocery store chain, and Mahalo stamps in Hawaii.  Growth and decline  The use of trading stamps grew with the spread of chain gasoline stations in the early 1910s and the then-new industry of chain supermarkets in the 1920s. Merchants found it more profitable to award them to all customers rather than cash only customers. Legal challenges regarding the use of trading stamps were raised in various jurisdictions around the US but were often struck down. Some merchant groups disliked trading stamps and actively worked to have them banned in their areas. Following WWII the use of trading stamps expanded when supermarkets began issuing them. By 1957 it was estimated that nearly 250,000 retail outlets were issuing trading stamps, with nearly two thirds of US households saving trading stamps. During this time trading stamp companies had between 1,400 - 1,600 retail centers where consumers could redeem their stamps for consumer goods. In the early 1960s, the S&H; Green Stamps company boasted that it printed more stamps annually than the number of postage stamps printed by the US government. In 1968 it was reported that more than $900 million in stamps were sold in the United States. Beginning in the early 1970s the use of trading stamps began to decline. Gasoline service stations stopped offering them due to the energy crisis that occurred and many supermarkets started spending more money to advertise lower prices rather than issue stamps. During the 1980s there was a brief resurgence in the popularity of trading stamps, but overall their use continued to decline. Their role has been replaced by coupons, rewards programs offered by credit card companies and other loyalty programs such as grocery \\"Preferred Customer\\" cards. Through the 1990s and early 2000s the majority of the remaining trading stamp companies either ceased operations or converted to an online format. In 2008 the last operating trading stamp company in the United States, Eagle Stamps, closed.  International trading stamps  167x167px = Canada = The use of trading stamps began in Canada circa 1900 but their use was banned by the Canadian government in 1905. In 1959 the grocery chain Loblaws introduced their Lucky Green Stamps program and a trading stamp program was started by an IGA grocery store in Winnipeg. Although faced with legal challenges the use of trading stamps in these instances was upheld as legal since they did not meet the definition of trading stamps in the Canadian Criminal Code. The Criminal Code provisions against trading stamps were deleted, among other obsolete provisions, by Bill C-51 in 2018 during the 42nd Canadian Parliament = United Kingdom = By the 1960s the use of trading stamps had spread to the United Kingdom. Entrepreneur Richard Tompkins established Green Shield Stamps in the United Kingdom. Although based along a similar model, the Green Shield Stamps were independent of S&H; Green Stamps but carried a similar trademark. Tompkins' company began selling stamps to filling stations, small retailers and had signed up the Tesco supermarket chain to the Green Shield Stamp franchise in 1963. The S&H; Company began offering their stamps in the United Kingdom as well but with the color changed to pink. 1965, the British co-operative movement was offering trading stamps as a new means of allocating patronage dividends to its consumer members. = Hong Kong = See also * Big Bear Stores - chain of supermarkets with their own trading stamp program called \\"Buckeye Stamps\\". * Blue Chip Stamps - US company that produced trading stamps. * Carlson Companies - originally Gold Bond Stamp Company, issuer of Gold Bond Trading Stamps. * Green Shield Stamps - first trading stamps issued in UK. * S&H; Green Stamps - US company that produced trading stamps. * Thomas Sperry - co-founder of S&H; Green Stamps. * Two Guys - a chain of stores that issued its own trading stamps program. * Federal Trade Commission v.

The German surname \\"Rothschild\\" is not related to the Scottish/Irish surname of \\"Rothchilds\\" from the United Kingdom.

In Denmark, by royal decree of 29 March 1814, all Danish Jews were obliged to adopt a surname after their town of residence. In the records, one family with residence in Roskilde took the name Rothschild, presumably because of the German pronunciation of the town's name.

From 1933 to 1938, he was a member of the British Union of Fascists (BUF). Disillusioned with Oswald Mosley, he parted ways with the BUF in 1938. Chesterton established the League of Empire Loyalists in 1954, which merged with the British National Party in 1967 to become the National Front. He founded and edited the magazine Candour in 1954 as the successor of Truth, of which he had been co-editor. Biography = Early life and education = Arthur Kenneth Chesterton was born on 1 May 1899 in Krugersdorp, South African Republic, the son of Arthur George Chesterton (1871-1900), a secretary at the local gold mine, and Harriet Ethel Chesterton (n√©e Down). He was the second cousin of the author and poet G. K. Chesterton and the journalist Cecil Chesterton, his paternal grandfather being an older brother of G. K. and Cecil's father Edward.; The young A. K. held his two cousins in high regard, seeing Cecil as his \\"exemplar\\". Just after the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899, Chesterton and his mother were sent to England. His father later died of pneumonia at 28 on his journey to join the family. In May 1902, after the end of the conflict, Chesterton returned to Krugersdorp with his paternal uncle and his mother. The latter soon remarried a Scottish mine administrator named George Horne, and the reconstituted family settled in Witwatersrand, near Johannesburg. In 1911, aged 12, Chesterton was sent again to England to live with his paternal grandfather in Herne Hill. He attended Dulwich College and Berkhamsted School, Hertfordshire, where he was a schoolmate of Ben Greene and Rex Tremlett. = World War I = In October 1915 his mother and step-father visited him in England, whom he persuaded to bring him back to South Africa. Shortly after disembarking, Chesterton decided to join the army, but too young to enlist at 16, he falsified his age to enroll in the 5th South African Light Infantry in German East Africa. In his memoirs, Chesterton alluded to two battles against the Germans at Salaita Hill on 12 February 1916, and at Latema Nek on 11‚Äì12 March 1916. During a march in 1916, Chesterton collapsed from fever and was left on the roadside to die. He was eventually rescued by two African porters and sent home to his family in Johannesburg.; After a period of convalescence, Chesterton decided to join the army again aged 17 and went to Ireland and train as an office with a cadet battalion. In August 1918, he received his commission as second lieutenant and was transferred to the 2/2 Battalion, City of London Regiment, Royal Fusiliers.; ; see also Chesterton served over two years on the Western Front. At the end of the war, he was awarded the Military Cross for his actions during the battle of √âpehy on 18‚Äì19 September 1918. Chesterton was at the head of a platoon reinforcing an assault against a German position near the village of Pezi√®res.; ; see also After the end of the war, Chesterton suffered from chronic symptoms of malaria and dysentery lingered from the East African campaign, and from permanent respiratory issues caused by a gas attack in Europe. Like many veterans, he developed an addiction to alcohol, punctuated by \\"nervous breakdowns\\" and episodes of \\"neurasthenia\\". Traumatised by trench warfare, Chesterton wrote that he had recurring nightmares of dead bodies and wrote that he began to experience the world as \\"one vast necropolis\\". = Career as a journalist = Shortly before his 21st birthday in 1919, Chesterton moved to South Africa, where he worked as a journalist for The Johannesburg Star. In 1924 he returned to England and, under the tutelage of G. Wilson Knight, Chesterton developed a reputation as a Shakespearean critic. He secured a job as a journalist and festival critic at the Stratford-upon-Avon Herald, then as a public relation officer at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre. During 1928, he edited the short- lived monthly Shakespearean Review, where he developed his ideas about cultural decay. Chesterton met his future wife, Doris Terry, a schoolteacher in Torquay, in 1929. The couple married in 1933 and moved to Kingston-upon- Thames. Doris was a Fabian socialist and did not share her husband's later political views.LeCras, Luke (2017). A.K. Chesterton and the Problem of British Fascism, 1915-1973 p. 118. Between 1929 and 1931, he worked as a journalist for the Torquay Times, and served as the chairman of the South Devon branch of the National Union of Journalists. In November 1933 Chesterton joined the British Union of Fascists (BUF) while still employed by the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, after being recruited by Rex Tremlett, his former schoolmate at Berkhamsted and then the editor of BUF's newspapers Fascist Week and The Blackshirt. = British Union of Fascists = Six months after joining the BUF, Chesterton was appointed officer-in-charge of Warwickshire and Staffordshire, and in April 1934 officer-in-charge of the \\"Midlands Area\\" for the party. Oswald Mosley, the leader of the BUF, later appointed him Director of Press Propaganda, a subsection of the BUF Propaganda Department, and in March 1935 to the BUF \\"Research Directory\\", the \\"inner circle\\" of the party's strategists. During the spring of 1935, Chesterton started to drink again. He was said to frequently arrive at BUF headquarters \\"in a drunken state\\", and some members began to call for his expulsion. In July, Blackshirt euphemistically reported that Chesterston was \\"having a well- deserved rest, on the strict orders of his doctor.\\" Mosley eventually paid for Chesterton to be treated by a neurologist in Germany. Following his return to Britain in April 1937, Chesterton was appointed in June \\"Director of Publicity and Propaganda\\", and in August the editor of The Blackshirt. This position provided a pulpit for his increasingly \\"vituperative\\" anti-Semitic rhetoric, the magazine promoting The Protocols of the Elders of Zion as \\"the most astounding book ever published\\". Chesterton also wrote the officially sanctioned biography of Mosley entitled Oswald Mosley: Portrait of a Leader (1937), in fact a hagiography of Mosley in which Chesterton claims that the BUF leader had an \\"unconquerable spirit, with its grandeur of courage and resolve\\", closing the book with the salutation \\"Hail, Mosley, patriot, revolutionary and leader of men!\\" = World War II = In the late 1930s Chesterton became gradually disillusioned with the myth of \\"The Leader\\" and came to lose confidence in Mosley after 1937. On 18 March 1938, he resigned from the BUF; Mosley soon had his memory erased from the history of the party. The same year, Chesterton attended a meeting of the National Socialist League (NSL). The NSL published his pamphlet Why I left Mosley in 1938, although Chesterton never joined the organization. He became involved with the short- lived British Council against European Commitments (BCAE), an anti-Bolshevik movement which had emerged during the Munich crisis to resist war with Germany, and he contributed to Lord Lymington's journal New Pioneer. In June 1939, Chesterton established his own group, British Vigil. He regularly spoke at meetings of the Nordic League, and became involved with the Right Club, a secretive organization founded in May 1939 to consolidate existing right-wing British organizations into a unified body. Archibald Ramsay, founder of the Right Club, explained its ideology and purpose:http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk , article on Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminister, retrieved 30 August 2012, : \\"The main object of the Right Club was to oppose and expose the activities of Organized Jewry, in the light of the evidence which came into my possession in 1938. Our first objective was to clear the Conservative Party of Jewish influence, and the character of our membership and meetings were strictly in keeping with this objective.\\" In 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, Chesterton re-enlisted in the British Army and served in Kenya and Somaliland. He relapsed into alcoholism and relinquished his commission on ground of ill health in the spring of 1943. Upon his return to Britain, he set up the short-lived National Front after Victory (NF after V) and was involved with the relaunched British Peoples Party. Chesterton applied for work at the BBC, but MI5 intervened to ensure that he could not be employed. He found work in sub-editing at the Sheffield Evening Telegraph, but was forced to resign due to a bout of malaria. Afterwards, he worked for the Southport Guardian and the Liverpool Evening Express, and partly as a freelance journalist to supplement his living, including for The Weekly Review. In August 1943, the Daily Worker published an attack on Chesterton accusing him of treachery for his past association with William Joyce. Chesterton sued the Daily Worker and the Jewish Chronicle, which had repeated the accusation, for libel. The case was dropped for lack of funds, but Chesterton did manage to elicit an apology. In September 1944, he was appointed deputy editor of Truth. = Post-war activism = In February 1945 Chesterton helped establish the National Front, a coalition of underground minor fascist groups with policies including the safeguarduing of a strong \\"national and Empire economy\\", preserving Christian traditions and finding \\"an honourable, just and lasting solution\\" to the \\"real Jewish problem\\". The movement was headed first by Collin Brooks then by Chesterton. Chesterton became literary advisor to Lord Beaverbrook, who offered him jobs at The Daily Express and the Evening Standard. Chesterton ghostwrote his autobiography Don‚Äôt Trust To Luck (1954). In October 1953, whilst still in Beaverbrook's employ, Chesterton founded the magazine Candour, which is still published today, though increasingly erratically as of 2012. He has claimed that Beaverbrook sacked him upon learning of Candour's existence; in fact, his contract expired in January 1954 and was not renewed. Following the collapse of the National Front due to infighting, Chesterton founded in 1954 the League of Empire Loyalists (LEL), a political pressure group which gathered many future far-right leaders the likes of Colin Jordan, John Bean, John Tyndall, or Martin Webster. The movement was publicly known in the 1950s for its political stunts, especially in interrupting Conservative conferences while chanting \\"Save the Empire\\" and \\"Tory Traitors\\". = 1960s = In July 1965, Chesterton published his magnum opus, The New Unhappy Lords, a self- described study of the \\"power elites\\" which takes the form, in the words of scholar Graham Macklin, of an \\"elegantly written antisemitic tirade on the subversive and occult conspiracy against the British Empire, and Western civilisation in general, that he believed was striving behind the scenes to create a 'One-World' Jewish super-state.\\" Following the demise of Nazi Germany for its \\"revolt against the Money Power\\", Chesterton argued that the British Empire and Commonwealth were then the decisive impediment to the global money- power conspiracy, mainly thanks to their system of Imperial preference.' The book received damning reviews in the mainstream media, but it had sold in excess of 17,000 copies by June 1969. Along with Phyllis Schlafly's A Choice Not an Echo, published one year earlier, the book was one of the first to highlight the Bilderberg Group as a decisive actor in global conspiracy theories.' After failing to make gains in the 1966 general election, Chesterton founded in February 1967 a second National Front (NF); he was elected the party's first chairman and remained its Policy Director until 1970. The National Front brought together the LEL and British National Party. A faction of the Racial Preservation Society decided to join them, but radicals and openly neo-Nazis figures like Jordan, Tyndall or Webster were excluded to avoid public backlash. In June 1967, however, Chesterton eventually welcomed Tyndall and members of the Greater Britain Movement (GBM) into the party. = Later life and death = At the end of his life, Chesterton became increasingly ill from the emphysema he had contradicted in the gas attack during World War I, living part-time in his native South Africa. While Chesterton was holidaying in South Africa, a faction led by Gordon Brown‚Äîformerly of Tyndall's GBM‚Äîlaunched a leadership challenge against him. On realising that his support was weak, Chesterton resigned in 1970. Chesterton spent the remainder of his days editing Candour until his death from emphysema on 16 August 1973, aged 74.  Views  According to historian Richard Thurlow, Chesterton's \\"weird mixture of racism, ethnocentrism and conspiracy theory in its racial theory and its paternalism, monarchism (particularly reverence for Edward I who expelled the Jews), cultural pessimism, Social Darwinism and dialectical mode of argument in its political theory are more akin to patterns of thought prevalent in pre-Nazi German Conservatism than to any English equivalent.\\" After the war, Chesterton repudiated fascism and resolutely denied accusations to the effect that he was pursuing a \\"neo-fascist\\" agenda. He toned down the antisemitic imagery of his pre-war writings, although the Jews remained at the centre of paranoid conspiracy theories. Described as \\"far more parasitic and corrupt than any baby could conceive\\" in Blackshirt (1935), they were still \\"the principal promoters of the idea of integrating peoples of disparate racial stocks\\" in his 1965 book The New Unhappy Lords. Although he conceded in 1973 that \\"any competent Jewish writer can make a nonsense of attempts to prove their authenticity\\", Chesterton regarded The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a Tsarist antisemitic forgery, as a \\"masterly analysis of the weaknesses of Gentile society\\" in The New Happy Lord (1965). In his later life, he came to consider the use of crude antisemitism a \\"liability and a menace\\" to the nationalist movement. Chesterton launched in September 1970 a public attack on Eustace Mullins in Candour, under the title \\"This man is dangerous\\".  Influence  John Tyndall, who established the British National Party (BNP) in 1982, has declared in 1971, \\"Without hesitation, what understanding I have of political affairs I have I owe much more to A.K. than any other person\\", and he continued recommending Chesterton's writings until his death in July 2005. Martin Webster, the National Front national activities organiser from 1969 to 1983, stressed in 2009 the \\"tremendous impact\\" of the intellectual framework provided by Chesterton book The New Happy Lord \\"because it tied together the threads of what is happening, why and who's doing it\\". Chesterton was also a long-time friend of Revilo P. Oliver, and they regularly wrote to each other until Chesterton's death in 1973. Works Chesterton's works (including some previously only published within Candour magazine) have been re-edited by the A. K.

Garrison (various spellings) (from the French garnison, itself from the verb garnir, \\"to equip\\") is the collective term for any body of troops stationed in a particular location, originally to guard it, but now often simply using it as a home base. The garrison is usually in a city, town, fort, castle, ship or similar. \\"Garrison town\\" is a common expression for any town that has a military base nearby. Arab garrison \\"Garrison towns\\" () were used during the Arab Islamic conquests of Middle Eastern lands by Arab-Muslim armies to increase their dominance over indigenous populations. In order to occupy non-Arab, non-Islamic areas, nomadic Arab tribesmen were taken from the desert by the ruling Arab elite, conscripted into Islamic armies, and settled into garrison towns as well as given a share in the spoils of war. The primary utility of the Arab-Islamic garrisons was to control the indigenous non-Arab peoples of these conquered and occupied territories, and to serve as garrison bases to launch further Islamic military campaigns into yet-undominated lands. A secondary aspect of the Arab-Islamic garrisons was the uprooting of the aforementioned nomadic Arab tribesmen from their original home regions in the Arabian Peninsula in order to proactively avert these tribal peoples, and particularly their young men, from revolting against the Islamic state established in their midst. British and Irish garrison In the United Kingdom, \\"Garrison\\" also specifically refers to any of the major military stations such as Aldershot, Catterick, Colchester, Tidworth, Bulford, and London, which have more than one barracks or camp and their own military headquarters, usually commanded by a colonel, brigadier or major-general, assisted by a garrison sergeant major. In Ireland, Association football (as distinct from Gaelic football) has historically been termed the \\"garrison game\\" or the \\"garrison sport\\" for its connections with British military serving in Irish cities and towns. Israeli garrison In Israel, a \\"garrison unit\\" () is a regular unit defending a specified Israeli zone in need of protection from attack from combatants. Israeli garrison units placed in the occupied territories of West Bank are recognized under UN Resolution 242 as occupied pending peaceful recognition by all regional combatants.  Ancient Rome garrison  It was an old custom in ancient Italy to send out colonies for the purpose of securing new conquests. The Romans, having no standing army, used to place populations of their own citizens in conquered towns as a kind of garrison.

The word filicide is derived from the Latin words filius and filia (son and daughter) and the suffix -cide, meaning to kill, murder, or cause death. The word can refer both to the crime and to the perpetrator of the crime. Statistics A 1999 U.S. Department of Justice study concluded that mothers were responsible for a higher share of children killed during infancy between 1976 and 1997 in the United States, while fathers were more likely to have been responsible for the murders of children aged eight or older. Furthermore, 58-percent of the children who were killed by their mothers (maternal filicide) were female, while 42-percent of the children who were killed by their fathers (paternal filicide) were male. Parents were responsible for 61-percent of child murders under the age of five. Sometimes, there is a combination of murder and suicide in filicide cases. On average, according to FBI statistics, 450 children are murdered by their parents each year in the United States.USA Today. Parents who do the unthinkable -- kill their children An in-depth longitudinal study of 297 cases convicted of filicide and 45 of filicide-suicide in the United Kingdom between 1997 and 2006 showed that 37% of the perpetrators had a recorded mental illness at the time. The most common diagnoses were mood disorders and personality disorders rather than psychosis, but the latter accounted for 15% of cases. However - similar to findings in a large Danish study - the majority had not had contact with mental health services prior to the murders, and few had received treatment. Female perpetrators were more likely to have given birth as teenagers. Fathers were more likely to have been convicted of violent offences and have a history of substance misuse, and were more likely to kill multiple victims. Infants were more likely to be victims than older children, and a link to post-partum depression was suggested.  Types of filicide  Dr. Phillip Resnick published research on filicide in 1969 and stated that there were five main motives for filicide, including \\"altruistic,\\" \\"fatal maltreatment,\\" \\"unwanted child,\\" and \\"spousal revenge.\\" \\"Altruistic\\" killings occur because the parent believes that the world is too cruel for the child, or because the child is enduring suffering (whether this is actually occurring or not). In fatal maltreatment killings, the goal is not always to kill the child, but death may occur anyway, and Munchausen syndrome by proxy is in that category. Spousal revenge killings are killings of children done to indirectly harm a domestic partner; they do not frequently occur. Glen Carruthers, author of \\"Making sense of spousal revenge filicide,\\" argued that those who engage in spousal revenge killings see their own children as objects.  Children at risk  In the United States, homicide is in the top five causes of deaths of children, and in the top three causes of death in children between 1 and 4 years old.https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_02.pdf A direct correlation has been identified between child abuse rates and child homicide rates. Research suggests that children who are murdered by their parents were physically abused victims prior to death.

It is served by the District, Circle and Piccadilly lines. On the District and Circle lines, the station is between Gloucester Road and Sloane Square, and on the Piccadilly line, it is between Gloucester Road and Knightsbridge. It is in Travelcard Zone 1. The main station entrance is located at the junction of Old Brompton Road (A3218), Thurloe Place, Harrington Road, Onslow Place and Pelham Street. Subsidiary entrances are located in Exhibition Road giving access by pedestrian tunnel to the Natural History, Science and Victoria and Albert Museums. Also close by are the Royal Albert Hall, Imperial College London, the Royal College of Music, the London branch of the Goethe-Institut and the Ismaili Centre. The station is in two parts: sub-surface platforms opened in 1868 by the Metropolitan Railway and the District Railway as part of the companies' extension of the Inner Circle route eastwards from Gloucester Road to Westminster and deep level platforms opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway. A variety of underground and main line services have operated over the sub-surface tracks, which have been modified several times to suit operational demands with the current arrangement being achieved in the 1960s. The deep-level platforms have remained largely unaltered, although the installation of escalators in the 1970s to replace lifts improved interchanges between the two parts of the station. Parts of the sub-surface station and the Exhibition Road pedestrian tunnel are Grade II listed. History =Sub-surface station= The station was opened on 24 December 1868 by the Metropolitan Railway (MR, later the Metropolitan line) and the District Railway (DR, later the District line). The MR had previously opened an extension from Paddington (Praed Street) (now Paddington) to Gloucester Road on 1 October 1868 and opened tracks to South Kensington to connect to the DR when the DR opened the first section of its line to Westminster. The original South Kensington station, designed by the MR's engineer John Fowler, had two platforms although it was intended that this would be supplemented as DR services extended. alt=View along station platform with timber and glass canopy over supported on cast-iron columns. To the left a disused platform without track is visible alt=Diagram of original and current layout of platforms of sub-surface station showing changes in platform usage and numbering and change in location of tracks On 1 August 1870, the DR opened additional tracks between Gloucester Road and South Kensington. On 10 July 1871, the DR opened its own facilities at South Kensington. The enlarged station had two through platforms for each company and a bay platform for terminating MR trains from the west. The junction between the two companies' tracks was also moved from the west side of the station to the east side. On 1 February 1872, the DR opened a northbound branch from its station at Earl's Court to connect to the West London Extension Joint Railway (WLEJR, now the West London Line) at Addison Road (now Kensington (Olympia)). From that date the Outer Circle service began running over the DR's tracks. The service was run by the North London Railway (NLR) from its terminus at Broad Street (now demolished) in the City of London via the North London Line to Willesden Junction, then the West London Line to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House ‚Äì at that time the eastern terminus of the DR. From 1 August 1872, the Middle Circle service also began operations through South Kensington, running from Moorgate along the MR's tracks on the north side of the Inner Circle to Paddington, then over the Hammersmith & City Railway (H&CR;) track to Latimer Road, then, via a now demolished link, on the WLEJR to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House. The service was operated jointly by the H&CR; and the DR. On 4 May 1885, the DR opened a pedestrian subway running from the station beneath the length of Exhibition Road, giving sheltered access to the newly built museums for a toll of 1 penny. Although it had cost ¬£42,614 to construct (approximately ¬£ today), it was closed on 10 November 1886 and afterwards was opened only occasionally for special museum events. In 1890, the South Kensington and Paddington Subway (SK&PS;), a proposed cut-and-cover railway planned to run from South Kensington to Paddington station, offered to purchase the under-used pedestrian subway for use as the first section of its tunnel. At wide and high the subway could have accommodated two tracks without difficulty, but the SK&PS;'s controversial plan to excavate a trench across Hyde Park was opposed and the railway withdrew its private bill from Parliament in March 1891. The DR continued to open the subway intermittently and charged a toll until 1908, when it was opened permanently for free. On 30 June 1900, the Middle Circle service was withdrawn between Earl's Court and Mansion House, and, on 31 December 1908, the Outer Circle service was also shortened to terminate at Earl's Court. In 1907, the current arcaded station entrance was opened to a design by George Sherrin. In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route was given its own identity on the tube map as the Circle line. In June 1957, the reversing bay track was taken out of use and the track bed was later filled to connect the two island platforms. The eastbound MR platform (Number 1) and westbound DR platform (Number 4) were taken out of use in January 1966 and March 1969 respectively. The tracks for these platforms were also removed and platform 4 was subsequently demolished in the early 1970s to allow escalators to be provided to the Piccadilly line. The widened island platform is now served by the District and Circle lines in both directions. Following the closure of platforms 1 and 4, platform 3 was renumbered as 1. The current arrangement has trains running in opposite directions to the original layout. During service disruption or engineering works, trains can also run Eastbound from Platform 1. The arcaded station entrance and shops, the brick retaining walls to the sub-surface platforms and the Exhibition Road pedestrian tunnel are Grade II listed structures. =Deep- level station= alt=A two-storey red-glazed building with a single rectangular window on the lower floor and three large semi-circular windows on the upper floor flanked by two small circular windows. A white band between the floor levels displays \\"South Kensington station\\". Former lift landing for the deep level station By the beginning of the 20th century, the DR had been extended to Richmond, Ealing Broadway, Hounslow West and Wimbledon in the west and to New Cross Gate in the east. The southern section of the Inner Circle was suffering considerable congestion between South Kensington and Mansion House, between which stations the DR was running an average of 20 trains per hour with more in the peak periods. To relieve the congestion, the DR planned an express deep-level tube line starting from a connection to its sub-surface tracks west of Gloucester Road and running to Mansion House. The tunnels were planned to run about beneath the existing sub-surface route with only one intermediate stop at Charing Cross (now Embankment). Parliamentary approval was obtained in 1897 but no work was done. In 1898, the DR took over the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B&PCR;) which had a route planned from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus. The route was modified to join the DR deep-level route at South Kensington. Following the purchase of the DR by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London in 1902, the planned DR and B&PCR; lines were merged with a third proposed route from the Great Northern and Strand Railway. The DR deep-level route was revised at its western end to continue to Earl's Court and surface to the east of Barons Court. The deep- level platforms were opened on 15 December 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&BR;, now the Piccadilly line) which ran between Finsbury Park and Hammersmith. The platforms are placed eastbound above westbound and were originally served by lifts from street level stopping at both platform levels. Eastbound GNP&BR; trains and DR trains would have shared the same platform with the two routes separating at a junction immediately to the east of the station. Westbound trains would have had separate platforms at the lower level with the routes merging at a junction west of the station. Although construction of the section of the DR tube route east of South Kensington had been postponed, a partial, long, section of the westbound DR platform was built along with the two for GNP&BR; use. Though closed-off from the rest of the station, it was linked to the lift lobby and was tiled to match the other platforms. Enlarged tunnel sections for the junctions were constructed with the original running tunnels and remain visible from passing trains. A new surface building on Pelham Street for the lifts was designed by Leslie Green with the GNP&BR;'s distinctive ox-blood red glazed terracotta fa√ßade. The unused westbound tunnel was used during World War I to store art from the Victoria & Albert Museum and china from Buckingham Palace and, from 1927 to 1939, was used as a signalling school. During World War II it contained equipment to detect bombs falling in the River Thames which might require the emergency floodgates on the under-river tunnels to be closed. In the early 1970s the lifts to the Piccadilly line platforms were replaced by escalators, with one pair being provided between the ticket hall and a new intermediate level, where it met a linking passageway to the Circle and District line platforms, and three being provided from there to a lower concourse between the levels of the two Piccadilly line platforms. Stairs up and down from the lower concourse connect to the platforms. The stairs and passage to the westbound platform are located in the disused DR westbound platform tunnel. With the introduction of escalators, the GNP&BR; station building was taken out of use. Future proposals Many stations on the Circle line which were originally constructed in open cuttings have been subject to air-rights developments where cuttings have been roofed over with buildings built above. South Kensington station and the adjacent shop premises occupy a site of approximately and proposals for redevelopment of the station and the site have been made a number of times since 1989 without success. In December 2016, Transport for London published outline proposals prepared by architects BuckleyGrayYeoman for a redevelopment of the buildings to the west of the station arcade and in Thurloe Street and space to the south of the station cutting on Pelham Street. The proposal includes bringing the disused northern platform back into use for eastbound trains, a new entrance to Thurloe Street, a reconfigured ticket hall and provision of step-free access throughout the station. Services The station is in London fare zone 1. On the District and Circle lines, the station is between Gloucester Road and Sloane Square, and on the Piccadilly line, it is between Gloucester Road and Knightsbridge. South Kensington is the easternmost interchange between these three lines. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally District line trains operate every 2-6 minutes from approximately 05:15 to 00:30 eastbound and 05:45 to 00:45 westbound; they are supplemented by Circle line trains every 8-12 minutes from approximately 05:30 to 00:30 clockwise and 05:40 to 00:15 anticlockwise. Piccadilly line trains operate every 2-6 minutes from approximately 05:40 to 00:25 eastbound and 05:50 to 00:40 westbound. On the Piccadilly line 1973 Stock is used. On the Circle and District lines S Stock is used. Connections London Buses routes 14, 49, 70, 74, 345, 360, 414, 430 and C1 and night routes N74 and N97 serve the station. There is a Santander Cycles rental station north of the station in Thurlow Street. In literature South Kensington is one of two tube stations (the other being Sloane Square) mentioned in the song \\"When you're lying awake\\" from the operetta Iolanthe by Gilbert and Sullivan.

He was the second son of the first Han emperor, Han Gaozu (originally named Liu Bang, of the Liu family) and the lady who after the death of her husband, became the Empress Dowager L√º. Lu was her last name, and she was from the powerful Lu clan (House of Lu). Han Huidi is generally remembered as a somewhat weak character dominated and terrorized by his mother, L√º (Lu Hou, who became Empress Dowager after she encouraged her husband to personally general a war in which he died from an arrow wound). Huidi was personally kind and generous, but unable to escape the impact of Lu Hou's viciousness. However he did end the laws of Burning of books and burying of scholars. He tried to protect Ruyi, Prince Yin of Zhao, his younger half- brother, from being murdered by Empress Dowager L√º, but failed. After that, he indulged himself in drinking and sex, and died at a relatively young age. Emperor Hui's wife was Empress Zhang Yan, a niece of his by his sister Princess Yuan of Lu; their marriage was the result of insistence by Empress Dowager L√º and was a childless one. Empress Dowager L√º installed two of his alleged sons whom she adopted into her clan, Liu Gong and Liu Hong (known collectively as Emperors Shao of Han), the sons of the Emperor's concubine(s) after he died without a designated heir: however they and the rest of the Lu clan were exterminated and Han Wendi was established as emperor, as heir of the Liu clan, thus firmly establishing the succession of the Liu family as the dynastic family of Han. Early life and years as crown prince =Early years= Liu Ying was born during the Qin dynasty. Liu Ying's childhood is not completely clear. His father Liu Bang would after Liu Ying's birth go on to found the Han dynasty, under the assumed name of Han Gaodi (emperor Gao of Han). What is known is that Liu Ying was not Liu Bang's oldest son‚Äîthat would be Liu Fei, who would later be made the Prince of Qi. However, Liu Ying was considered to be the proper heir because his mother, the later Empress L√º, was Liu Bang's wife, while Liu Fei's mother was either a concubine or a mistress. =Chu‚ÄìHan Contention= During Chu‚ÄìHan Contention, while Liu Bang fought a five-year war with Xiang Yu for supremacy over the Chinese world, his mother, his sister, and he did not initially follow his father to the Principality of Han (modern Sichuan, Chongqing, and southern Shaanxi); rather, they stayed in his father's home territory, perhaps in his home town of Pei (Ê≤õÁ∏£, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) deep in Xiang's Principality of Western Chu, presumably with his grandfather Liu Zhijia. =Father Liu's big setback= In 205 BC, Liu Bang appeared to be near total victory, having captured Xiang's capital of Pengcheng. How his family received this news was unclear, but a few months later, when Xiang responded and crushed Liu's forces, Liu fled and, in his flight, attempted to pass through his hometown to take his family with him. He was able to find his children and carry them along with him, but his father and wife were captured by Xiang's forces and kept as hostages‚Äîand would not be returned to him until Liu and Xiang temporarily made peace in 203 BC. The then-very young Liu Ying must have then spent these days not knowing what the eventual fate of his grandfather and mother would be. =Father Liu's big victory= After Liu Bang's victory and self-declaration as the emperor (later known as Emperor Gao), thus establishing the Han Dynasty, in 202 BC, he made his wife empress and Liu Ying, as his proper heir, crown prince. Thus, Liu Ying became the first crown prince in Chinese imperial history. Under the title of Ying Taizi (\\"Crown Prince Ying\\"), he was considered to be kind and tolerant, characteristics that Emperor Gao did not like. Rather, he favored his young son Liu Ruyi, whom he considered to be more like him and whose mother, Consort Qi, was his favorite concubine. With the support of the officials and the Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang, Prince Ying's status as heir survived despite Consort Qi's machinations. =Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang= Kan≈ç Naonobu (17th century): \\"The Four Sages of Mount Shang\\" Soon after establishing the Han dynasty, the new emperor, Gaodi, was eager to recruit talented persons. In 196 BCE Gao even issued a decree to the effect that any official knowing of a virtuous man must so report on penalty of being fired (unless they were too old or sick). Sometime before or after that, Gao attempted to obtain the services of the Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang: Master Dongyuan, Qi Liji, Master Xiahuang and Mr. Lu Li. During the time of troubles which characterized the Qin dynasty, these four had entered into a life of seclusion on Mount Shang. They were old and had white hair and beards: thus they were known as the Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang. Liu Bang was well aware of the reputation of these four sages, and when he became emperor Gao, the four refused his ardent entreaties to assume positions of importance in his newly established government. When the question of who was to be imperial heir came up, two of Gaodi's women both advocated for their own son: Lu for Ying and Qi for her own son. Gao favored Qi's son, as he thought the youth embodied more of his personality. Lu Hou got the advantage: she went to the powerful official Zhang Liang, who said, ‚ÄúHis Majesty had long heard about the Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang and wanted to invite them to serve the country. However, they refused. If the Crown Prince could obtain the support of the Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang, then His Majesty would not depose him.‚Äù Lu Hou then applied her forces of persuasion. The Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang showed up at court. The four agreed that according to the Confucian precepts of filial piety, as the elder son the future Huidi should succeed to the rulership, and that furthermore Liu Ying's nature was benevolent and compassionate. Gaodi noticed the presence of four elders with white hair and white beards at his court, and inquired as to their identity. Upon finding out who they were and what their position was, Gaodi went to Lady Qi and told her: ‚ÄúI cannot appoint your son as the successor because the Crown Prince has already obtained the support of such capable people. His position is firmly entrenched.‚Äù =Lu Hou: Growing ascendancy= As crown prince, Prince Ying, along with his mother, would be the ones who would rule on important matters at the capital in his father's absence during various campaigns. When Ying Bu rebelled in 196 BC, Emperor Gao was ill and considered sending Prince Ying as the commander of the forces against Ying Bu rather than campaigning himself, but at the suggestion of Empress L√º (who averred that the generals, who were generally Emperor Gao's old friends, might not fully obey the young prince), went on the campaign himself. Prince Ying was instead put in charge of home territories around the capital Chang'an, assisted by Confucian scholar Shusun Tong (ÂèîÂ≠´ÈÄö) and strategist Zhang Liang (ÂºµËâØ). He appeared to carry out the tasks competently but without distinction. =Succession to the imperial power= Prince Ying succeeded to the throne of Han when his father died in 195 BC from complications of an arrow wound suffered during the campaign against Ying Bu, after Lu Hou had insisted on Gaodi personally leading the fight. Reign as emperor under Empress Lu regency Immediately upon Prince Ying's ascension to the throne as Emperor Hui, Empress L√º, now empress dowager, became the effective lead figure in his administration. She wanted to carry out a plot of revenge against Consort Qi and her son Ruyi. She first arrested Consort Qi and put her in prison garb (shaved head, confined by stock, and wearing red clothes). She then summoned Liu Ruyi to the capital‚Äîan attempt that was initially resisted by Ruyi's chief of staff Zhou Chang (Âë®Êòå), whom she respected because he was one of the officials who insisted on Liu Ying being the rightful heir. Instead of directly moving against Zhou and Liu Ruyi, though, L√º circumvented Zhou by first summoning him to the capital, and then summoning Liu Ruyi. Emperor Hui tried to save Liu Ruyi's life. Before Liu Ruyi could get to the capital, Emperor Hui intercepted his young brother at Bashang (Èú∏‰∏ä, in modern Xi'an) and received Liu Ruyi into his palace, and they dined together and slept together. Empress Dowager L√º wanted to kill Liu Ruyi, but was afraid that any attempt might also harm her own son, and therefore could not carry out her plot for several months. Empress Dowager L√º got her chance in winter 195 BC. One morning, Emperor Hui was out hunting and wanted to take Liu Ruyi with him. The young prince was then only 14 years old and refused to get up from bed, and Emperor Hui left for the hunt on his own. Empress Dowager L√º heard this and immediately sent an assassin into the emperor's palace to force poisoned wine down the prince's throat. By the time that Emperor Hui returned, his brother was dead. She then had Consort Qi's eyes gouged out, made her ears deaf, drugged her to make her unable to speak and had her arms and legs cut off. The mutilated woman was thrown into a latrine and then fed and kept alive in a pig's bin and was called the \\"‰∫∫ÂΩò\\", meaning literally the \\"human swine\\". (She would die from the torture.) When Emperor Hui saw his father's favorite and the mother of his beloved little brother in such a condition, he cried out loud and became ill for about a year, complaining to his mother that he felt that he could not govern the empire, given that he was the son of someone like her who has done such inhuman deed. From that point on, Emperor Hui indulged himself with wine and women and no longer made key governing decisions, leaving them to his mother. Emperor Hui, however, continued to try to protect his siblings. In winter of 194 BC, when Liu Fei, Prince of Qi‚Äîhis older brother‚Äîmade an official visit to the capital, they both attended a feast put on by Empress Dowager L√º. Emperor Hui, honoring the prince as an older brother, asked him to take a seat at the table even more honored than his own. The empress dowager was greatly offended and instructed her servants to pour two cups of poisoned wine which were set on the table between the three people. She ordered Liu Fei to toast her, while ignoring Emperor Hui. As Liu Fei was about to drink the poisoned wine, Emperor Hui, knowing his mother's murderously jealous temperament and remembering how his other brother had died, suddenly reached for the second cup, which the Empress did not intend. (The second cup was a decoy, placed there only to suggest to Liu Fei that she would return his toast, as ritual required, although he would die immediately on drinking his, so she would not need to drink the other cup. Her resentment toward Liu Fei fully captured her attention and she did not even think of her son's presence.) Empress Dowager L√º jumped up and slapped the second cup away from Emperor Hui, spilling it. Liu Fei realized the trick and left, pretending to be already drunk. In the end, he was only able to leave the capital by offering to the Empress an entire commandery from his principality, to be the feudal estate of Princess Yuan of Lu. Empress Dowager L√º, who greatly loved her daughter as well, was pleased and let Liu Fei return to his principality. =Accomplishments= As the second emperor of his dynasty, Huidi helped to establish the Han dynasty on a strong footing: Huidi bolstered the Han dynastic aspirations by establishing shrines venerating his father throughout the land. Although his father, Gaodi, had continued many of the Qin institutions, Huidi repealed some particularly harsh Qin laws, such as the Burning of books and burying of scholars law. Nevertheless, Huidi's gentle nature was at first little match against the ruthless Lu Hou and her clan. Still, the Han dynasty was set on a firm foot as the challenging Lu clan was eventually generally exterminated and Han Huidi was effectively succeeded by Han Wendi. Death Hui died in the autumn of 188 BC of an unspecified illness. Gaodi's surviving son's then chose their half-brother Han Wendi as next emperor, deliberately due to his lack of a powerful maternal clan. Marriage and children In winter 192 BC, Emperor Hui married Empress Zhang, a marriage that would not yield any children. However, whether Emperor Hui actually had children during or before his reign is a controversial question. The officials, including Chen Ping and Zhou Bo, who would later overthrow the L√º clan after the deaths of both Emperor Hui and Empress Dowager L√º, claimed that Emperor Hui had no sons‚Äîbut that Empress Zhang, at Empress Dowager L√º's instigation, stole eight boys from other people, put their mothers to death, and made the children her own. Modern historians have split opinions on the issue, but largely believe that the boys were actually Emperor Hui's sons by concubines and that Empress Zhang did indeed put their mothers to death and make them her own children. (As, for example, Bo Yang pointed out, it would be logically incongruent, if Empress Zhang did steal these children from elsewhere, for her to put only the mothers but not the fathers to death.) Under this theory, the officials denied the imperial ancestry of these children in fear of the fact that they were also descendants of Empress Dowager L√º and her clan, and therefore might if allowed to live eventually to seek vengeance for the slaughter of the L√º clan‚Äîa reason that they themselves admitted. Except for Liu Gong (who was deposed and executed by Empress Dowager L√º), the other children either died young by natural causes or were executed by the officials after they made Liu Heng, the Prince of Dai (Emperor Wen) the emperor.

An arboretum specializing in growing conifers is known as a pinetum. Other specialist arboreta include saliceta (willows), populeta (poplar), and querceta (oaks). The term arboretum was first used in an English publication by John Claudius Loudon in 1833 in The Gardener's Magazine but the concept was already long-established by then. Related collections include a fruticetum (from the Latin frutex, meaning shrub) and a viticetum (from the Latin vitis, meaning vine, referring in particular to a grape vine). History Neptune's fountain at Trsteno Arboretum Egyptian Pharaohs planted exotic trees and cared for them; they brought ebony wood from the Sudan, and pine and cedar from Syria . Hatshepsut's expedition to Punt returned bearing thirty-one live frankincense trees, the roots of which were carefully kept in baskets for the duration of the voyage; this was the first recorded attempt to transplant foreign trees. It is reported that Hatshepsut had these trees planted in the courts of her Deir el Bahri mortuary temple complex. In an arboretum a wide variety of trees and shrubs are cultivated. Typically the individual trees are labelled for identification. The trees may also be organised in a way to aid their study or growth. Many tree collections have been claimed as the first arboretum, in most cases, however, the term has been applied retrospectively as it did not come into use until the later eighteenth century. Probably the most important early proponent of the arboretum in the English-speaking transatlantic world was the prolific landscape gardener and writer, John Claudius Loudon (1783‚Äì1843) who undertook many gardening commissions and published the Gardener's Magazine, Encyclopaedia of Gardening and other major works. Loudon's Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum, 8 vols., (1838) is probably the most significant work on the subject in British history and included an account of all trees and shrubs that were hardy in the British climate, an international history of arboriculture, an assessment of the cultural, economic and industrial value of trees and four volumes of plates. Loudon urged that a national arboretum be created and called for arboreta and other systematic collections to be established in public parks, private gardens, country estates and other places. He regarded the Derby Arboretum (1840) as the most important landscape-gardening commission of the latter part of his career because it demonstrated the benefits of a public arboretum (for more details see below). Commenting on Loddiges' famous Hackney Botanic Garden arboretum, begun in 1816, which was a commercial nursery that subsequently opened free to the public, for educational benefit, every Sunday, Loudon wrote: \\"The arboretum looks better this season than it has ever done since it was planted... The more lofty trees suffered from the late high winds, but not materially. We walked round the two outer spirals of this coil of trees and shrubs; viz. from Acer to Quercus. There is no garden scene about London so interesting\\". A plan of Loddiges' arboretum was included in The Encyclopaedia of Gardening, 1834 edition. Leaves from Loddiges' arboretum and in some instances entire trees, were studiously drawn to illustrate Loudon's encyclopaedic book Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum which also incorporated drawings from other early botanic gardens and parklands throughout the United Kingdom.Paul A. Elliott, Charles Watkins and Stephen Daniels, The British Arboretum: Trees, Science and Culture in the Nineteenth Century (London; Pickering and Chatto, 2011; Paul A. Elliott, Charles Watkins and Stephen Daniels Eds., 'Cultural and Historical Geographies of the Arboretum', special issue of Garden History (2007) ) One example of an early European tree collection is the Trsteno Arboretum, near Dubrovnik in Croatia. The date of its founding is unknown, but it was already in existence by 1492, when a span aqueduct to irrigate the arboretum was constructed; this aqueduct is still in use. The garden was created by the prominent local Guƒçetiƒá/Gozze family. It suffered two major disasters in the 1990s but its two unique and ancient Oriental Planes remained standing. Later examples =Asia ‚Äì India= ;Udhagamandalam (Ooty) Arboretum, The Nilgiris, India The arboretum at Ooty was established in 1992 with an aim of conserving native and indigenous trees; it occupies near Ooty lake. It was established during the year 1992 and maintained by Department of Horticulture with Hill Area Development Programme funds. The micro watershed area leading to Ooty lake where the arboretum is now located, had been neglected and the feeder line feeding water to Ooty was contaminated with urban waste and agricultural chemicals. The area is the natural habitats of both indigenous and migratory birds. During the year 2005‚Äì2006, it was rehabilitated with funds provided by the Hill Area Development Programme (Rs 1,250,000) by providing permanent fencing, a footpath, and other infrastructure facilities. Both indigenous and exotic tree species are included; about 80 trees were previously present, including the following species: Alnus nepalensis, Calistemon lanceolatus, Cupressus macrocarpa, Eugenia apiculata, Hypericum hookerianum, Podocarpus elongata, Populus deltoides, Quercus macrocarpa, Salix babylonica, Taxodium mucronatum, Prunus pissardii. The following tree species were also planted: Celtis tetrandra, Dillenia pentagyna, Elaeocarpus ferrugineus, Elaeocarpus oblongus, Evodia lunuankenda, Glochidion neilgherrense, Ligustrum perrotetti, Litsaea ligustrina, Litsaea wightiana, Meliosma arnotiana, Meliosma wightii, Michelia champaca, Michelia nilagirica, Pygeum gardneri, Syzygium amothanum, Syzygium montanum, Alnus nepalensis, Viburnum erubescens, Podocarpus wallichianus, Rhodomyrtus tomentosa, Rapanea wightiana, Ternstroemia japonica, Microtropis microcarpa, Psychotria conjesta, Photinea notoniana, Cedrela toona, Symplocos cochinchinensis, Elaeocarpus ganitrus, Platanus orientalis, Jacaranda mimosaefolia, Magnolia grandiflora etc. =Australia and New Zealand= ;Eastwoodhill Arboretum, Gisborne, New Zealand Probably the largest collection of Northern Hemisphere trees in the Southern Hemisphere can be found at Eastwoodhill Arboretum, Ngatapa, Gisborne, New Zealand. The arboretum is the realization of the dream of William Douglas Cook (1884‚Äì1967), who started planting trees on his farm shortly after the First World War. The arboretum is now the National Arboretum of New Zealand, and holds some 4,000 different trees, shrubs and climbers. ; Taitua Arboretum, Hamilton, New Zealand This arboretum was offered to Hamilton residents in 1997. Trees and shrubs were planted there from 1973 by John and Bunny Mortimer to provide shelter and shade for local animals. The arboretum is a popular picnic spot and is enjoyed by about 60,000 people every year. The twenty-two hectare arboretum contains 1500 species of trees and much birdlife. ;RJ Hamer Arboretum, Victoria, Australia Parks Victoria RJ Hamer Arboretum, Visitors to the RJ Hamer Arboretum can take a quiet, peaceful stroll along the many walking tracks and roads providing access to the 126 hectares of breathtaking scenery and tranquil beauty that the Arboretum has to offer. The RJ Hamer Arboretum land is a small part of the original Dandenong and Woori Yallock State forest, proclaimed over 110 years ago. The RJ Hamer Arboretum is the first known occasion in which a forest style Arboretum was completely established by planting. A basic planting design was completed in 1970 and planting was carried out for the next 15 years. ;The Tasmanian Arboretum, Devonport, Tasmania The Tasmanian Arboretum was established in 1984 on the Don River in Devonport, Tasmania, Australia.

It was laid out with 2,500 trees and shrubs, all labelled and arranged in an unusual alphabetical format from A for Acer (maple trees) to Z for Zanthoxylum (American toothache trees). Until Kew was enlarged and opened to the public, this remained the largest arboretum in Europe. It never achieved the recognition of the better financed early nineteenth century botanical gardens and arboreta that could afford members' events, indoor facilities and curatorial staff for those who paid accordingly. However, unlike these, and even unlike the 'public' arboretum at Derby, the Abney Park arboretum always offered public access free of charge, though sometimes, by pre-arrangement; a Viewing Order was needed so as not to interfere with funeral events.

There are many species of insects and resident and migrating birds with the aquatic and wet margins to the pools provide a breeding ground for many water-fowl and frogs. ;Derby Arboretum, Derbyshire, England The Derby Arboretum opened on 16 September 1840. Commissioned and presented by Joseph Strutt (1766‚Äì1844) a wealthy industrialist and major local benefactor, the Derby Arboretum was designed by John Claudius Loudon and had a major impact upon the development of urban parks. It was one of the first Victorian public parks and also unusual for the quality of its collection of trees and shrubs. Although established on only quite a small site of 14 acres, the park featured a labelled collection of over 1000 trees and shrubs and was landscaped with mounds, sinuous paths, urns, benches, statues, lodges and other features. Managed by a committee until it was acquired by the Derby Corporation during the 1880s, the Derby Arboretum was only open free to the public for two days of the week for its first four decades, the remaining days being reserved for subscribers and their families and guests. Very popular anniversary festivals were staged annually which drew crowds of tens of thousands and helped to fund the upkeep of the park. The Derby Arboretum is also significant because it was the planted counterpart to Loudon's Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum (1838) which detailed all the hardy and semi-hardy trees and shrubs of the British Isles. Within the park, the trees and shrubs were laid out according to the natural system and labelled so that visitors could identify them using the guide.P. Elliott, 'The Derby Arboretum (1840); the first specially designed municipal park', Midland History, 26 (2001), 144-176; Paul A. Elliott, Charles Watkins and Stephen Daniels, The British Arboretum: Trees, Science and Culture in the Nineteenth Century (London; Pickering and Chatto, 2011), 135-154. The Derby park had a major impact on park design elsewhere including Europe, the British colonies and North America and other public parks and arboreta were established modelled on Loudon's creation and using his ideas. In 1859 for example, it was visited by Frederick Law Olmsted on his European tour of parks, and it had an influence on the planting in Central Park, New York. Industrial pollution killed most of the original plantings by the 1880s (although a few examples remain), but it has been renovated and replanted with National Lottery Heritage funding closer to Loudon's original layout and with a new cafe and visitor centre. ;Dropmore Park, Buckinghamshire, England Dropmore Park, Buckinghamshire (Bucks) England, was created in the 1790s for the Prime Minister at the time Lord Grenville. On his first day in occupation, he planted two cedar trees. At least another 2,500 trees were planted. By the time Grenville died in 1834, his pinetum contained the biggest collection of conifer species in Britain. Part of the post-millennium restoration is to use what survives as the basis for a collection of some 200 species. ;D√∏mmesmoen Arboret, Grimstad, Aust-Agder, Norway D√∏mmesmoen Arboret is a arboretum in Grimstad municipality, Aust-Agder county, Norway. In the D√∏mmesmoen forest, where the arboret is planned in harmony with nature, 22 different ecosystems have been defined. The trees and plants have been planted along the tracks so that the visitors can experience and learn about them in the various ecosystems. Information about the various ecosystems are found along the tracks in the forest and park area. Through the years, approximately 700 different species of trees and plants have been planted in the D√∏mmesmoen area. The D√∏mmesmoen area, where the arboret is situated, has a fascinating history. Excavations have found traces of settlements that can be dated to around year 0. There are 50-60 burial mounds from pre Viking area at D√∏mmesmoen, among the densest burial mound areas found in Norway. The most famous attractions at D√∏mmesmoen among locals are a 400-500 year old hollow oak, and a wooden tower overlooking the town of Grimstad. 2 kilometres east of D√∏mmesmoen, at Fj√¶re, Fj√¶re church is situated. The stone church was built around year 1150, and has significant historical value dating back to the Viking area.

Aqueduct in the Washington Park Arboretum in Seattle ;Washington Park Arboretum, Washington, US The Washington Park Arboretum at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, was established in 1934 as a public space that was agreed upon by the University of Washington and the City of Seattle. Seattle at the time had in its possession an over-1,200-acre (500+ ha) park known as Washington park located in the central portion of the city, and the university was given authority to design, construct, plant, and manage an arboretum and botanical garden in this park. It has been a popular destination of Seattlites ever since. In 2005, the Washington Park Arboretum, as well as the University of Washington's Center for Urban Horticulture, Elisabeth C.

An early leader of the Iowa Republican Party, he represented northeastern Iowa in the United States House of Representatives before representing his state in the United States Senate. By the 1890s, Allison had become one of the \\"big four\\" key Republicans who largely controlled the Senate, along with Orville H. Platt of Connecticut, John Coit Spooner of Wisconsin and Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island. Born in Perry, Ohio, Allison established a legal practice in Dubuque, Iowa and became a prominent member of the nascent Iowa Republican Party. He was a delegate to the 1860 Republican National Convention and won election to the House of Representatives in 1862. He served four terms in the House and won election to the Senate in 1872. He became chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, serving for all but two years between 1881 and 1908. Three different Republican presidents asked Allison to join their Cabinet, but Allison declined each offer. A significant number of delegates supported his presidential nomination at the 1888 and 1896 Republican National Conventions. Allison emerged as a centrist and pragmatic leader in the Senate, and he helped pass several important bills. The Bland‚ÄìAllison Act of 1878 restored bimetallism, but in a less inflationary manner than had been sought by Congressman Richard P. Bland. A prominent advocate of higher tariffs, Allison played a major role in the passage of the McKinley Tariff and the Dingley Act. He also helped pass the Hepburn Act by offering the Allison amendment, which granted courts the power to review the Interstate Commerce Commission's railroad rate-setting. Allison sought a record seventh term in 1908, but died shortly after winning the Republican primary against progressive leader Albert B. Cummins. Early life and career Born in Perry, Ohio, Allison was educated at Wooster Academy.\\"Long Decline Before Death of Sen. Allison,\\" Cedar Rapids Evening Gazette, 1908-08-05 at p.1. Afterward, he spent a year at Allegheny College in Pennsylvania, then graduated from Western Reserve College (then located in Hudson, Ohio) in 1849. He then studied law and began practicing in Ashland, Ohio. While practicing law there from 1852 until 1857, he was a delegate to the 1855 Ohio Republican Convention and an unsuccessful candidate for district attorney in 1856. In 1857, he moved to Dubuque, Iowa, which would serve as his hometown for the last fifty years of his life. Civil War After his arrival in Dubuque, Allison took a prominent part in the politics of the nascent Republican Party. He was a delegate to the 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago,\\"Iowa Republican Convention,\\" Waterloo Courier, 1960-01-24, p. 2. which nominated Abraham Lincoln for President of the United States. During the subsequent Civil War, he was on the staff of Iowa Governor Samuel J. Kirkwood, who ordered him to help the state raise regiments for the war. He personally helped raise four regiments. He was given the rank of lieutenant colonel during the war, although it was unlikely he actually served in uniform. In 1862, in the midst of the war, Allison was elected to the United States House of Representatives as the representative of Iowa's newly created 3rd congressional district.\\"Iowa Election - Official,\\" Davenport Daily Gazette, 1862-11-20 at p. 1. As a congressman and member of the House Ways and Means Committee, he pushed for higher tariffs. Post-war political career U.S. Capitol Following the war, Allison continued to serve in the House after winning re-election in 1866 and 1868. In January 1870, he was an unsuccessful candidate for election by the Iowa General Assembly to the United States Senate seat for 1871‚Äì1877, losing to Iowa Supreme Court Justice George G. Wright.\\"From Des Moines,\\" Dubuque Daily Herald, 1870-01-16 at p. 1. Allison declined to be a candidate for renomination to his own House seat later that year, but instead focused on laying the groundwork to run for Iowa's other Senate seat (then held by James Harlan), which was up in January 1872, following November 1871 state legislative races.Dan Elbert Clark, \\"History of Senatorial Elections in Iowa,\\" pp. 152-67 (Iowa 1913). In the 1871 state legislative races, candidates were nominated and elected on the direct issue of whether they would vote for Harlan, Allison or James F. Wilson for senator.Cyrenus Cole, \\"A History of the People of Iowa,\\" p. 396 (1921). Enough legislators who favored Allison were nominated and elected in 1871 that in January 1872 he won the required number of votes to take Harlan's U.S. Senate seat, effective March 4, 1873. Allison was reelected to six-year terms in the U.S. Senate six times ‚Äî in 1878, 1884, 1890, 1896, and 1902. He chaired the 1884‚Äì1886 Allison Commission, a bipartisan joint congressional committee \\"among the first to explore the question of whether federal intervention politicizes scientific research.\\"\\"Allison Commission\\", US History Encyclopedia, Answers.com Eprint. It considered the charge that parts of the government were engaged in research for theoretical, not practical, purposes. The majority report favored the status quo, and Congress upheld it. In 1885, the Commission's finding of misuse of funds at the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey led to the dismissal of several officials but exonerated Charles Sanders Peirce. As Allison earned seniority, he also earned one of the most powerful committee positions. From 1881-93 and again from 1895 to 1908, he was chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, where he had great influence. Allison's combined years as chairman of the committee make him the longest- serving chairman to date. He was also a member of the Senate Committee of Indian Affairs (and its chairman from 1875 to 1881), the Senate Finance Committee, and the Committee on Engrossed Bills. He became chairman of the Senate Republican Conference in 1897. He was twice asked to serve as the Secretary of the Treasury, first by President Chester Arthur (to which Allison agreed but then the next day declined), then by President Benjamin Harrison. In 1897, President William McKinley offered him the position of U.S. Secretary of State. Again, Allison declined.\\"Mr. Allison has Declined,\\" New York Times, 1897-01-07 at p.1. It was just as well. No Republican senator was so well fitted for the duties of responsible statesmanship, or positioned so well. For thirty years he sat on the Senate Finance Committee and took a critical role in framing legislation. In 1881, he became chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and continued to serve there until his death in 1908. After 1897, he was chosen as chairman of the Republican caucus, an unofficial position, but one generally accorded to the most venerable and respected party member in the Senate. Eminently conservative, trusted by the railroad interests, Allison's pragmatism made him the centrist that everybody could deal with, even the Democrats. When in 1888 a Republican alternative was needed to the Mills tariff bill coming out of the House, Allison handled the details. The bill that emerged from committee was purely for campaign purposes. Nobody thought that it could pass, but it put the best face on protectionist principles and later served as a model for the 1890 McKinley Tariff, which Allison played a large part in framing. In 1897, when the Dingley Tariff bill reached the Senate, Allison did most of the work reconciling discontented interests. When the Bland bill, allowing the free coinage of silver, came to the Senate, Allison altered it. The resulting Bland‚ÄìAllison Act of 1878 simply had the government buy a certain, more limited amount of silver, which the Treasury was permitted to put into circulation as silver dollars. It was far less inflationary than Bland's original bill. The Act passed over the veto of President Rutherford B. Hayes. It remained unchanged until the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890. In 1892, Allison chaired the Brussels Monetary Conference and in 1900 was one of the fathers of the Gold Standard Act. In 1896, he became a dark-horse candidate for the presidency.\\"Stands on his Record: Iowa Formally Launches the Allison Presidential Boom,\\" New York Times, 1896-03-12 at p. 5. However, support for his candidacy faded when it became clear that McKinley would be nominated on the first ballot.\\"Want Allison to Withdraw,\\" New York Times, 1896-06-12 at p. 2. \\"Allison is the man of experience,\\" an admiring reporter wrote in 1906, \\"the sage old pilot of the Senate. They say that no man who has ever been in the Senate knew so much about it as he does. He is the political forecaster, the compromiser, the weather prophet, the man who brings irreconcilable things together. It is said that the oldest inhabitant cannot recall having heard Allison give utterance to an opinion on any subject whatever. Doubtless he does give utterance to them, but never except in the inner councils of the Caesars. Sagacious to the point of craft, it does not annoy him to know that the epithet most frequently applied to him is 'the Old Fox.'...When he rises in his place in the Senate, he disdains to talk as if he were making a speech; he leaves all that to the youngsters, whose sum of knowledge does not equal all that he has forgotten. He never rises except to shed light on some knotty point, and when he does it is always as briefly as possible, and in a conversational voice that is almost an undertone. Then he drops back into his seat and, with sublime indifference, lets the talk go on.\\"Charles Willis Thompson, Party Leaders of the Time (New York: G. W. Dillingham Co., 1906), 32-33. Allison was married twice, first to Anna Carter, who died in 1859, four years after the marriage. His second marriage was to Mary Neally, who died in 1883, ten years after their marriage. 1908 Senate race In 1908, as Allison neared his 44th year in Congress, and his 80th birthday, he sought a record seventh term in the Senate.Editorial, \\"An Unfortunate Decision,\\" Spirit Lake Beacon, August 30, 1907 at p. 4. However, Iowa's Republican Governor at the time, Albert B. Cummins, had aspired to become a U.S. Senator for several years, and as leader of Republican progressives had targeted his party's \\"old guard\\" for retirement or (if necessary) defeat. After seeming to promise that he would not challenge Allison in 1908, Cummins ran against Allison for the Republican nomination in the state's first-ever congressional primary on June 2, 1908. Much like Allison's 1873 race for the Senate against incumbent Harlan, Cummins' 1908 race for the Senate against incumbent Allison was very acrimonious. However, this time the incumbent prevailed; Allison won a clear victory over Cummins by over ten thousand votes.\\"Allison Victor in Iowa Senatorial Fight,\\" Cedar Rapids Evening Gazette, June 3, 1908 at p. 1. As a reflection of the nature of its preference for Allison over Cummins, the Ames Times reported the primary results under a two-level banner headline simply stating \\"GLORY TO GOD!\\"\\"Country Press Hysterical over Election Result,\\" Des Moines Daily News, June 6, 1908 at p.1. Death and his legacy Sen. William Boyd Allison Monument, Des Moines, Iowa, 1916. Allison did not live to see the 1908 general election or a seventh term. Two months after his primary win, he died in Dubuque.\\"EXTRA - DEAD,\\" Des Moines Daily News, 1908-08-04. While many were surprised by his death, news reports soon indicated that he had been under constant medical care for more than two years, and that those familiar with his condition had expected his death. He was interred in Linwood Cemetery in Dubuque. Governor Cummins was elected by the Legislature to fill the unexpired term of Senator Allison and for the term beginning March 4. 1909, and was re- elected in 1914 and 1920, but in 1926 he lost in the Republican primary to Smith W. Brookhart. Senator Cummins died shortly after his loss in the June 1926 primary. Senator Allison was the namesake of Allison, Iowa, the county seat of Butler County. The Allison-Henderson Park in Dubuque was named in honor of Allison and fellow Dubuque icon, U.S. Speaker of the House David B. Henderson. There is an imposing memorial to Allison by sculptor Evelyn Longman on the grounds of the Iowa State Capitol in Des Moines.

It appeared in 1974 in German under the title Zeig Mal!, written with psychiatrist Helga Fleischhauer-Hardt for children and their parents. It was translated into English a year later and was widely available in bookstores on both sides of the Atlantic for many years, but later became subject to expanded child pornography laws in jurisdictions including the United States. In Germany, the book was followed in 1990 by a second edition that included, among other additions, a discussion of the AIDS epidemic. Publication history While many parents appreciated Show Me! for its frank depiction of pre-adolescents discovering and exploring their sexuality, others called it child pornography. In 1975 and 1976, obscenity charges were brought against the publisher by prosecutors in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, and Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In all four cases, the judges ruled as a matter of law that the title was not obscene. However, starting in 1977, some states began to criminalize the distribution of even non-obscene so-called \\"child pornography,\\" or \\"images of abuse,\\" which arguably is not protected by the First Amendment. New York State, home of the publisher, St. Martin's Press, criminalized the distribution of non-obscene \\"child pornography\\" in 1977, but the publisher promptly went to court and obtained an injunction against the State. The court granted the injunction because the First Amendment was interpreted to permit the banning of only obscene material. In 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision, New York v. Ferber,New York v. Ferber, Findlaw.com which allowed the government to constitutionally ban the knowing distribution of even non- obscene \\"child pornography\\". Citing a chilling effect, St. Martin's Press then pulled the book, stating that though they believed Show Me! was not pornographic, they could no longer afford the legal expenses to defend it, and they did not want to risk criminal prosecutions of their own personnel and/or vendors who sold the book. The Court overruled a decision of the New York Court of Appeals, The People v. Paul Ira Ferber, which held that the First Amendment protected the dissemination of non-obscene sexual depictions. Show Me! was not the direct subject of the Ferber case, but the book was prominently featured by both sides in the litigation, and it played a significant role in the oral argument before the U.S. Supreme Court.Oral argument at Oyez.org. Accessed 23 May 2008 In its country of origin, Germany, the book first won several awards, even from church organisations, but due to rising pressure from a newly arising \\"moral majority\\" the publishers and McBride decided to take it off the market in 1996. By then over one million copies in seven languages had been sold. It was never officially banned in Germany. Public libraries there keep it on hand and out of print copies are openly sold at collectors' premium prices. In New Zealand the book was banned by the Indecent Publications Tribunal in 1976. The ban was upheld in 1996. Critical reception Show Me! received mixed reviews from the mass media when it was first published. The Los Angeles Times called the photographs \\"beautiful...graceful, charming, and elegant,\\" yet accurately predicted, in a severe understatement of what actually happened, that the book \\"may start (an) uproar.\\"\\"Is America Ready?\\", Los Angeles Times, March 9, 1975 The Washington Post, on the other hand, described the photographs as \\"beautiful, assaultive, grotesque, and seductive,\\" and concluded that Show Me! was only suited for \\"avant garde\\" parents.\\"Kiss the Stork Goodbye,\\" Washington Post May 5, 1975 Reviewer Linda Wolfe was more hostile in the New York Times, calling the book a \\"child-abusive joke\\".\\"The birds and the bees were never like this\\", New York Times July 13, 1975 The 13-year-old daughter of Chicago Tribune reviewer Carol Kleiman stated: ::\\"I'm too old for it myself. The last part, though, with no pictures, looks interesting to read. The book is good for little kids because they don't know what society terms 'dirty' yet. You know, Mom, it's PARENTS I'm worried about. They're not ready yet.\\"\\" New sex ed: All kids ever wanted to know...and how!\\", Chicago Tribune, July 5, 1975 =Recent reviews= A 2005 Amazon review by Dr. Russell A. Rohde claims that the book, \\"appropriately delves into the issues of breast feeding, adolescence, pubertal changes, menses, sexual anatomies, pregnancy, masturbation, contraception, sexual behavioral disturbances and venereal disease. [...] I am not aware of any book comparable to this illustrated primer that fills the needs of sexual education so well.\\" D. F. Janssen places it at the one extreme of a late 20th-century visual and textual revolution that enabled parents to illustrate information that up to that time had been transmitted orally. He sees the work as subversive not for its \\"too frank\\" portrayal of childhood sexuality, but instead for the primacy that the image takes over the text. In his eyes, the work \\"comes out of a culture with a long history of pathologising so-addressed 'primal scenes,'\\" a history that became manifest in particular with regard to the works of Will McBride.D. F. Janssen, Growing Up Sexually. Volume II: The Sexual Curriculum: The Manufacture and Performance of Pre-Adult Sexualities (October 2002) The book is analyzed in an article on \\"Picturing Sex Education\\" (Discourse Volume 27, Number 4 / December 2006). Moira Greyland mentions this book in her 2017 autobiography The Last Closet mentioning that her pedophile father showed the 1974 version to boys he molested and that she hated the book because her father made her read it multiple times when she was very young.

Simpson has been accredited by North Central Association since 1913. The college has about 1,250 full-time and 300 part-time students. In addition to the Indianola residential campus, Simpson has a facility in West Des Moines. Simpson is known for its commitment to civic engagement and non-partisan education on public issues, exemplified by the John C. Culver Public Policy Center and by its two Pi Kappa Delta debate national championships from 2016 and 2018.http://simpson.edu/news-center/simpson-debate-team-captures-national- title-again/  History  Simpson College was founded in 1860 and is named for Methodist minister Matthew Simpson. Simpson is best known as the minister who spoke a moving eulogy at Abraham Lincoln's funeral in Springfield, Illinois in 1865. September 28, 2010, marked the 150th anniversary of Simpson's founding as an educational institution. To celebrate the event, students and alumni held a ceremony in front of the college gates, where a time capsule was buried with pictures and memorabilia submitted by students. The capsule will be uncovered in 2060, on Simpson's 200th anniversary.  Campus  Historic College Hall (formerly Old Chapel) The tree-lined campus is bordered on the north by Buxton Park Arboretum. Simpson blends tradition with modernity which is reflected in the architecture on campus. Many of the buildings have been renovated in keeping with their historic past, and new buildings blend the traditional look of the campus with an energetic dimension. The theater building, an example of the Brutalist architecture that dominated American campus construction in the 1970s, was renovated and added on to in 2010-11, softening its features, but is a notable exception. The renovation and addition to the theater building is the first of many construction projects that Simpson has planned for the next five years. Other notable construction includes the building of the brand new Kent Family Campus center, which replaces the old Brenton Student Center as the center of student life. The 55,000-square-foot campus center will house new meeting rooms and offices for student groups, a student activities theatre, comfortable living room settings, a grille and snack bar, a coffee house, a new bookstore and post office, and new professional space for the Student Development staff. Simpson also recently renovated their outdoor track and football field. In addition to rebuilding the entrances and fences surrounding Bill Buxton stadium, the school invested in what has been dubbed the most innovative artificial turf system in the world, FieldTurf Revolution, for the fall of 2011 school year. The new-era Beynon BSS 1000 running track, similar to the new tracks installed at the University of Virginia and The University of Iowa, was also installed for the 2011-12 school year. The renovation of Simpson's athletic facilities concluded in 2014 with the construction of a new bi-level weight room in the former pool area. This move was made possible by the construction of the Indianola YMCA on the north side of town that contains a 25-yard pool and hosts swimming meets for Simpson College, Indianola High School, and the YMCA Tide swim team. Simpson offers a variety of residential housing options, including two first year-only residence halls, other traditional residence halls, apartment-style living, theme houses and an active Greek system. All Simpson living facilities include air conditioning, lofted beds, carpet, furniture, social lounges and wireless internet. Organization and administration The college had an endowment of $78.6 million as of February 10, 2017.  Academics  Simpson's curriculum includes more than 70 majors, minors, and pre-professional programs. Coursework is structured in a 4-4-1 format, with classes running Sept.-Dec. and Jan.-Apr. before the 3 week May Term. This provides students with many unique learning opportunities, including internship programs, career observations and a variety of Study Abroad programs that take place over May Term. Beginning in Fall 2011, most courses at Simpson are four-credit courses. Simpson also implemented their new Engaged Citizenship Curriculum, which is largely based on the AAC&U; Liberal Education and America's Promise (LEAP) initiative. The new curriculum attempts to build seven different Embedded Skills into all courses. The seven skills are: *Collaborative leadership *Critical thinking *Information literacy *Intercultural communication *Oral communication *Quantitative reasoning *Written communication In addition to classes in their major, students are required to take courses in seven specified Areas of Engagement: *The Arts *Civic Engagement *Diversity and Power in the United States *Ethics and Values Inquiry *Global Perspectives *Historical Perspectives on Western Culture *Scientific Reasoning In order to meet the global perspectives Area of Engagement, many students will take an overseas course, which may be completed throughout an entire semester (with exchange programs in London, Germany, Chile, Thailand, and Tahiti) or over May Term, which provides different selections every year. Some of the recent May Term travel courses include trips to China, Thailand, Italy, London & Paris, Ghana, Belize, and the Netherlands. Simpson ranks among the nation‚Äôs top 100 colleges in the percentage of students who study abroad, according to U.S. News and World Report. In addition to these requirements, students also take two courses to bookend their Simpson Experience: the Simpson Colloquium and the Senior Capstone. The Simpson Colloquium is taken during the first semester of college and is designed to help students make the transition to college life. The Senior Capstone is a culminating project in each student's major demonstrating their proficiency in a chosen field of study. Music Simpson is notable for being the only college in the United States with an entirely student-cast undergraduate opera program that is supported by a largely professional orchestra. Two fully staged productions a year with admission open to the public and free to all students are staples of the Simpson calendar. Alumni can be found at the highest levels in opera performance, artistic administration, and music education. Music at Simpson has been fully accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music since 1947, and confers the degrees of Bachelor of Music in performance and in music education, and the Bachelor of Arts in music. It is widely recognized as offering a premier education for vocal, piano, and instrumental students. Simpson develops the unique gifts of each student through a combination of one-to-one music instruction, classroom teaching, and countless performance opportunities. Aspects of the program have been cited as \\"outstanding\\" by U.S. News and World Report and the program in voice as \\"exceptional\\" by the National Association of Teachers of Singing. Simpson College enjoys a historic close partnership with the Des Moines Metro Opera, which makes it home on the Simpson campus over the summer, with performances in Simpson's Blank Performing Arts Center. It provides Simpson students with the invaluable opportunity to experience professional opera on their doorstep, and to serve as interns and production staff in the summer opera festival. Many singers from Simpson have taken part in the DMMO Apprenticeship Program, an opportunity afforded usually to only the most talented graduate students and young professional singers from all over the United States. Speech and debate Simpson runs a comprehensive program where students discover which style of speech or debate event offered best aligns with their long-term goals. The team competes in Public Forum, Parliamentary (NPDA & PLUM), International Public Debate (IPDA), NFA Lincoln-Douglas, Student Congress, and a wide variety of speech events.http://simpson.edu/debate/ Athletics Simpson College athletic teams are nicknamed the Storm. They compete in the American Rivers Conference in NCAA Division III. Simpson fields men's teams in baseball, basketball, cross country, American football, golf, soccer, tennis, track & field, and wrestling. Women's teams include: basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track & field, and volleyball. Simpson also fields cheerleading and dance squads.

To help support Simpson College athletics there is a non-profit organization funded by the Indianola community and other alumni called the Gold Club. The Gold Club was founded in 1976 by members of Simpson and the Indianola communities, the Simpson College Gold Club is designed to support Simpson College athletic programs. Gold Club members are former athletes, alumni, faculty, parents, and other athletic supporters who share the common interest of fostering the development and growth of Simpson College athletics. Student life The Simpsonian, is the student newspaper. The newspaper has been published since September 1870.http://www.thesimpsonian.com/site/about.html It provides formal practical experience for students interested in journalism and serves as a forum for student opinions and ideas. Sequel is an annual Simpson literary arts magazine, assembled from student and faculty contributions including paintings, photographs, drawings, short fiction, and short non-fiction. KSTM, 88.9, is the student-operated campus radio station. It has limited wattage and the signal does not really carry outside of Warren County. Intramurals allow students, faculty, and staff to become involved in recreational activities. The campus community is invited to participate, and participants may do as many activities as they wish. Over 60% of the campus participates in one or more of the programs offered through the Office of Intramurals and Recreation. Events are widely varied and skill or expertise is not a requirement when participating in events. The goal is to participate and have fun. The Campus Activities Board (CAB) is one of the main programming organizations on campus. =Simpson Forum= Throughout the school year, Simpson holds numerous forum events. These are events that are meant to extend a student's education beyond the classroom and allow for personal growth. These events include Simpson- produced arts events, faculty-organized discussions, research symposiums, and expert speakers from outside of Simpson who discuss a wide range of topics. Recent experts include Gabriel Ajak, one of the Lost Boys of Sudan, former U.S. Senator John Culver, and former U.S. Senator and presidential nominee George McGovern among others. Forum events are a requirement for first-year students, as they must attend at least four events throughout the fall semester, but are optional beyond that. Simpson also offers an additional credit to students who attend at least 90% of designated forum events in a semester. =John C. Culver Public Policy Center= The Culver Center was established at Simpson College in 2010 to honor the service of John Culver, who served the people of Iowa for 16 years in the US House of Representatives and US Senate. The Culver Center is dedicated to encouraging civic engagement and public service. The program awards four-year scholarships to up to select incoming Simpson students who demonstrate a commitment to public service and civic engagement. The annual John C. Culver Lecture brings a prominent figure in public service or politics to campus to meet with students and deliver a lecture, which is open to the public. Lectures have included Senator George McGovern, Political Journalist Mark Shields, Supreme Court Reporter Linda Greenhouse, and former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel.http://culvercenter.org/ =Campus Day= Campus Day has been an annual tradition at Simpson College since at least 1911. The idea was conceived by the student body to suspend classes on one Tuesday of the year and put in a day of cleaning campus buildings and grounds. Faculty did not know until they arrived at campus to start classes, but were glad to pitch in. The cleanup of campus became an annual tradition and eventually expanded to the Indianola community. Today, nearly 60% of Simpson students take part in campus day activities, which include campus-assigned projects, a grill out, and a late night dodgeball tournament. Historically, Campus Day was picked early in the year by the student government and reserved as a surprise to the rest of the student body, but today it is announced ahead of time so that students can plan ahead for it.http://simpson.edu/library/archives-special- collections/college-archives/campus-day-history/ =Greek life= Simpson College has a deep-rooted Greek life history. It is home to eight Greek organizations: three national fraternities; Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Alpha Tau Omega, Lambda Chi Alpha, one local fraternity; Kappa Theta Psi, and four national sororities; Kappa Kappa Gamma, Pi Beta Phi, Delta Delta Delta, and Sigma Lambda Gamma. Every April, one week is set aside in the Greek community for Greek Week, a series of coed competitions that instill a sense of unity among the houses, while providing friendly competitiveness. * Alpha Tau Omega (ATO) is the oldest fraternity on campus, tracing its history at Simpson back to 1885. The fraternity is known nationally as the \\"leadership development fraternity\\". After briefly being shut down along with 3 other fraternities on campus in the 1890s, ATO was rechartered in 1905 and has been in continuous existence ever since. The Simpson College ATO chapter has produced many prominent names at the school. Nick Ackerman, the wrestler who won the Division III national championship despite having no legs, was an ATO, as were some of the most prominent names at Simpson College, including Bill Buxton, Bill Buxton, Jr., Dick Buxton, and James Weinman, all of whom have facilities on campus named in their honor. In Oct. 2010, ATO celebrated its 125th year on campus. * Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE), founded in 1889, is the second oldest fraternity on campus. It is currently the largest fraternity on campus in terms of members. The men of SAE pride themselves on \\"The True Gentlemen\\". They are proud to have removed pledging from their fraternity nationally and focus their specific chapter's activities on scholarship and community service. The Iowa Sigma Chapter as it is designated within the national fraternity is one of the oldest chapters of Sigma Alpha Epsilon within the realm. The chapter has recently won awards in their national fraternity for academic excellence, excellence in service, and the coveted national chapter achievement award. In addition, for over 50 years Iowa Sigma was advised by the national fraternities historian Dr. Joseph Walt, for whom the SAE national archives are named for. As such Iowa Sigma is a well recognized and famous chapter within the national fraternity and the men of the chapter have always upheld the highest values of integrity in accordance with the fraternities rich history. In 2017 Iowa Sigma was awarded the Sigma Alpha Epsilon John O. Moseley Fraternity Zeal Award for the most outstanding SAE chapter in the nation. * Kappa Theta Psi (KOY) is the oldest local fraternity west of the Mississippi.Simpson College Greek Life. \\"Simpson College Greek Chapters\\" , Simpson.edu. Retrieved on 2010-1-23. It was founded in 1902, shortly after a time when four other fraternities on campus (including ATO and SAE) had been shut down due to anti-Greek sentiment. After the quest for a national re- charter from SAE failed, KOY existed for many years as only a local fraternity. After the chapter was nationally chartered in 1969 as an Upsilon Delta chapter, then subsequently shut down by nationals and by Simpson college, KOY returned to campus in 1979. The fraternity saw much success in the 1980s and 1990s, but membership died off in the 2000s and KOY was removed from their house on fraternity row. They were given a house on D Street, a couple of blocks from fraternity row, and were the only fraternity on campus not located on fraternity row. However, thanks to membership growth by the fraternity and meeting standards set by Simpson College, KOY returned to their former residence on fraternity row (formerly Worth Hall) in 2010. * Lambda Chi Alpha (LXA) traces its roots at Simpson to 1924 where it existed as the national fraternity Theta Kappa Nu, which merged with Lambda Chi Alpha in 1939. Recently, Lambda Chi has become known on campus for having many members involved in Political Science, History and the college's nationally recognized speech and debate team. LXA is one of the leading fraternities on Simpson campus for scholastic achievement and dedication to community service. * Pi Beta Phi (Pi Phi) is Simpson's oldest Greek organization. Pi Phi has been at Simpson since 1874. * Kappa Kappa Gamma (KKG) was on Simpson's campus for nine years between 1880 and 1889. After a 100-year absence, it was re-established in 1989. * Delta Delta Delta (DDD or Tri-Delta) has been at Simpson since 1889 and is the longest-running Tri-Delta chapter nationally and internationally. * Sigma Lambda Gamma (SLG) was established on campus as a national multicultural sorority in 2016. * Alpha Chi Omega (AXO) had a Simpson College chapter for over 100 years, before it closed its doors in the spring of 2007.  Notable people  Wallace Hall (formerly Science Hall) housed George Washington Carver's first college classrooms. * Simpson College was the first college attended by George Washington Carver.\\"George Washington Carver\\" Retrieved on 2013-09-18 Carver entered Simpson as an art major, but became interested in the natural sciences after receiving advice from a fellow student. Carver once remarked that his time at Simpson taught him that he was \\"a human being.\\" Carver left Simpson College to complete his undergraduate education at Iowa State College (now Iowa State University). Both schools have buildings named in his honor Carver Science Hall, at Simpson, and Carver Hall, at Iowa State University. * Historian Avery Craven (1885-1980), who specialized in the study of the nineteenth-century United States and the American Civil War, received his B.A. from Simpson in 1908. The Avery O. Craven Room of Dunn Library at Simpson holds Craven's personal library of over 2,000 volumes, notes, manuscripts, correspondence, and memorabilia.https://simpson.edu/dunn- library/archives-special-collections/avery-o-craven-room * Nick Ackerman attended Simpson College in the late 1990s and early 2000s. His wrestling performance in which he won the 2001 NCAA Division III Championships was named as one of the top 25 moments in NCAA history. Nick lost his legs to bacterial meningitis as a baby but this did not hold him back.Metzger, Sherry. \\"Bilateral Amputee Named in Top 25 NCAA Moments: College Wrestling Champion Nick Ackerman\\", The O&P; Edge, June 2006. Retrieved on 2007-10-25. * Former Chicago Alderman, 52nd Mayor of Chicago, and current Cook County Clerk David Orr also attended Simpson College for his undergraduate degree. Orr is an American Democratic Politician from Chicago, Illinois. He was Alderman of the 49th Ward in Chicago from 1979 to 1991. In 1987, he served briefly as Mayor of Chicago after the death of Mayor Harold Washington and was recognized for his strong and sensible leadership during one of the most tumultuous periods in Chicago‚Äôs political history. Serving his 23rd year as the Clerk of Cook County, Orr is responsible for the third largest election district in the United States (among other duties). * Mike Pearson, host of Market to Market on Iowa Public Television, is a graduate of the class of 2010.http://simpson.edu/success-story/mike-pearson-10/ * Evan Tanner (attended), retired professional MMA fighter, former UFC middleweight champion. * Malcolm A.

At , the tower is the 125th-tallest building in the world . It is the 21st tallest building in the U.S., the tallest building in Georgia, and the tallest building in any U.S. state capital, overtaking the , 50-story One Atlantic Center in height, which previously held the record as Georgia's tallest building. It has 55 stories of office space and was completed in 1992, when it was called NationsBank Plaza. Originally intended to be the headquarters for Citizens & Southern National Bank (which merged with Sovran Bank during construction), it became NationsBank's property following its formation in the 1991 hostile takeover of C&S;/Sovran by NCNB.  Architectural details  The building was developed by Cousins Properties and designed by the architectural firm Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates LLC. Designed in the Postmodern style reminiscent of Art Deco, it was built in only 14 months, one of the fastest construction schedules for any building. The Plaza's imposing presence is heightened by the dark color of its exterior. It soars into the sky with vertical lines that reinforce its height while also creating an abundance of revenue-generating corner offices. It is located over on Peachtree Street. There is a obelisk-like spire at the top of the building echoing the shape of the building as a whole. Most of the spire is covered in 23 karat (96 percent) gold leaf. The open-lattice steel pyramid underneath the obelisk glows yellow-orange at night due to lighting. Originally, the lattice was designed to be clad in glass, but the engineers failed to take the weight of the glass into account. At its most basic, this is a modern interpretation of the Art Deco theme seen in the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. The inhabited part of the building actually ends abruptly with a flat roof. On top of this is built a pyramid of girders, which are gilded and blaze at night, with the same type of yellow-orange high-pressure sodium (HPS) lighting now used in most street lights. Its design has been characterized as similar to the Messeturm in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. The skyscraper, built at a 45-degree angle to the city's street grid, is set back off its eastern and western street boundaries, Peachtree Street and West Peachtree Street, by over 50 yards (45 m). This setback is filled, variously, by driveways, parking garage entrances, potted plants, granite staircases, and sloping lawns. The building directly abuts the sidewalk on North Avenue, its northern boundary, with access to this street through a parking garage entrance and stairs leading from the building's main lobby. Some urban planners decry the building as a Corbusian \\"tower in a park\\", as it actively disengages itself from the urban environment surrounding it, entirely omitting sidewalk-facing retail space. Critics argue that the building encourages its tenants to access it primarily by car and to remain inside the complex during the day. However it is across the street from the MARTA-rail North Avenue station. Developers have rumored that the land under the surrounding driveways and lawns may be redeveloped into low- and mid-rise mixed-use buildings with street-fronting uses as the area urbanizes and the value of land in Midtown Atlanta increases. In 2014, new sidewalks, pavers, ADA ramps, pedestrian light-poles, improved tree wells, new bike racks and landscaping were planned. These neighborhood improvements were completed by 2016 at a cost of $1.04 million.  Renovations and sustainable building initiative  In 2014, a $30 million renovation to the lobby, health club, and conference facility was completed It has also achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver certification. The building and property management were awarded Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce E3 Liquid Assets, a recognition in water sustainability. Midtown Atlanta's Midtown Alliance also recognized it as an EcoDistrict Green Luminary for its significant commitment to sustainability practices. Beginning in 2016, $15 million will be invested over the next few years to significantly modernize the common areas including the lobby, west wing and some deferred maintenance.  Building ownership  BentleyForbes acquired the building from Cousins Properties in 2006 for $436 million, a record price at $348 per square foot. In 2012, LNR and lenders acquired the property via foreclosure. In 2013, CWCapital took over the asset management, sponsoring and representing the building's bond holders from LNR and hired real estate services company Cushman & Wakefield and property manager Onyx Equities. In 2016, a fund managed by San Francisco-based Shorenstein Properties acquired the building. CBRE Group was hired to head leasing efforts. The largest tenant in the building is Troutman Sanders, a law firm.  In popular culture The building appears as the headquarters of Westgroup Energy in the AMC period drama Halt and Catch Fire.

He is the son of Sir Arthur Norrington and his brother is Humphrey Thomas Norrington.  Life  Norrington studied at The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, Dragon School, Oxford, Westminster School, Clare College, Cambridge and the Royal College of Music under Adrian Boult among others. Norrington played the violin, and worked as a tenor through the 1960s, and in 1962 founded the Sch√ºtz Choir (later the Sch√ºtz Choir of London). = Conductor in Britain and US = From 1969 to 1984, Norrington was music director of Kent Opera. In 1978, he founded the London Classical Players and remained their musical director until 1997. From 1985 to 1989, he was principal conductor of the Bournemouth Sinfonietta. He is also president of the Oxford Bach Choir. In the US, from 1990 to 1994, he was music director of the Orchestra of St. Luke's. With his wife, the choreographer Kay Lawrence, he formed in 1984 the Early Opera Project to complement his concert work in period-style opera, beginning with Claudio Monteverdi's L'Orfeo at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino that year, and touring Britain in 1986. = From Salzburg to Stuttgart = In Europe, he was principal conductor of the Camerata Salzburg from 1997 to 2006, and principal conductor of the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra from 1998 to 2011. On 28 July 2016, he conducted the final concert of the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra in London at the Royal Albert Hall as part of The Proms, before its scheduled merger with the SWR Sinfonieorchester Baden-Baden und Freiburg. = Other activities: Boston, Bremen, Zurich = He was artistic advisor of the Boston Handel and Haydn Society from 2006 to 2009. He was principal guest conductor of the Orchestre de chambre de Paris and the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen. He was principal conductor of the Zurich Chamber Orchestra from 2011 to 2016. He has conducted over 50 world premieres, and has appeared regularly with the Berlin Philharmonic, the Vienna Philharmonic, and major orchestras throughout the world. = Historically informed performance = Norrington is best known for historically informed performances of Baroque, Classical and Romantic music. He is a member of the historically informed performance movement. Norrington has advocated a limited or no use of vibrato in orchestral performances, which has brought him both positive and adverse criticism. He has strictly followed Beethoven's original metronome markings in his symphonies, despite critical comment that these markings were \\"miscalculated\\". He has conducted recordings of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Berlioz, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Dvorak, Bruckner, and Mahler on period and modern instruments. In particular, Norrington makes very sparse use of the vibrato, often uses very fast tempos, and varies the placement of the instruments on stage. Especially with the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra Norrington has developed a very individual sound, which is often dubbed by the trade press as Stuttgart Sound.Bettina Straub: Stuttgart-Sound aus der Liederhalle. In: Deutschlandfunk, 25.11.2005 This refers to the synthesis of historically informed music making with the means of a modern and flexible orchestra. Symphonic cycles which Norrington interpreted in recent years with the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra have received worldwide acclaim. However, Norrington's performance practice is not without critics among other musicians; for example, the violist of the Melos Quartet, Hermann Voss, drew two tough caricatures to Norrington's vibrato-free string sound in 2005, adding: \\"Except for the Stuttgart Feuilleton, the New Stuttgart Style finds only contempt and scorn.\\"Hermann Voss: Hackordnungen im Quadrat - Bleistiftzeichnungen von Hermann Voss. Res Novae Verlag, Aulendorf 2017, P. 80ff, = TV = In August 2008, Norrington appeared in the reality TV talent show-themed television series, Maestro on BBC Two, when he led the judging panel. He conducted the First Night of the Proms in 2006 and the Last Night of The Proms on 13 September 2008. = Private life = Norrington has been married twice. He and his second wife, Kay Lawrence, have a son, Tom.He also has two offspring, Ben (born 1966) and Amy, by his first marriage.  Awards and honours  He was appointed OBE in 1980, CBE in 1990 and Knight Bachelor in 1997. He is a patron of Bampton Classical Opera and the Orchestra of St Paul's. He is an honorary fellow of Clare College Cambridge and holds honorary degrees from the Universities of York and Kent and an honorary doctorate from the Royal College of Music.

The IUPAC name is octadecanoic acid. It is a waxy solid and its chemical formula is C17H35CO2H. Its name comes from the Greek word œÉœÑŒ≠Œ±œÅ \\"st√©ar\\", which means tallow. The salts and esters of stearic acid are called stearates. As its ester, stearic acid is one of the most common saturated fatty acids found in nature following palmitic acid.Gunstone, F. D., John L. Harwood, and Albert J. Dijkstra \\"The Lipid Handbook with Cd-Rom. 3rd ed. Boca Raton: CRC Press, 2007.  The triglyceride derived from three molecules of stearic acid is called stearin. Production Stearic acid is obtained from fats and oils by the saponification of the triglycerides using hot water (about 100 ¬∞C). The resulting mixture is then distilled. Commercial stearic acid is often a mixture of stearic and palmitic acids, although purified stearic acid is available. Fats and oils rich in stearic acid are more abundant in animal fat (up to 30%) than in vegetable fat (typically <5%). The important exceptions are the foods cocoa butter (34%) and shea butter, where the stearic acid content (as a triglyceride) is 28‚Äì45%. In terms of its biosynthesis, stearic acid is produced from carbohydrates via the fatty acid synthesis machinery wherein acetyl-CoA contributes two-carbon building blocks. Uses In general, the applications of stearic acid exploit its bifunctional character, with a polar head group that can be attached to metal cations and a nonpolar chain that confers solubility in organic solvents. The combination leads to uses as a surfactant and softening agent. Stearic acid undergoes the typical reactions of saturated carboxylic acids, a notable one being reduction to stearyl alcohol, and esterification with a range of alcohols. This is used in a large range of manufactures, from simple to complex electronic devices. =As food additive= Stearic acid (E number E570) is found in some foods. =Soaps, cosmetics, detergents= Stearic acid is mainly used in the production of detergents, soaps, and cosmetics such as shampoos and shaving cream products. Soaps are not made directly from stearic acid, but indirectly by saponification of triglycerides consisting of stearic acid esters. Esters of stearic acid with ethylene glycol, glycol stearate, and glycol distearate are used to produce a pearly effect in shampoos, soaps, and other cosmetic products. They are added to the product in molten form and allowed to crystallize under controlled conditions. Detergents are obtained from amides and quaternary alkylammonium derivatives of stearic acid. =Lubricants, softening and release agents= In view of the soft texture of the sodium salt, which is the main component of soap, other salts are also useful for their lubricating properties. Lithium stearate is an important component of grease. The stearate salts of zinc, calcium, cadmium, and lead are used to soften PVC. Stearic acid is used along with castor oil for preparing softeners in textile sizing. They are heated and mixed with caustic potash or caustic soda. Related salts are also commonly used as release agents, e.g. in the production of automobile tires. As an example, it can be used to make castings from a plaster piece mold or waste mold, and to make a mold from a shellacked clay original. In this use, powdered stearic acid is mixed in water and the suspension is brushed onto the surface to be parted after casting. This reacts with the calcium in the plaster to form a thin layer of calcium stearate, which functions as a release agent. When reacted with zinc it forms zinc stearate, which is used as a lubricant for playing cards (fanning powder) to ensure a smooth motion when fanning. Stearic acid is a common lubricant during injection molding and pressing of ceramic powders. It is also used as a mold release for foam latex that is baked in stone molds. =Niche uses= Being inexpensive, nontoxic, and fairly inert, stearic acid finds many niche applications. Stearic acid is used as a negative plate additive in the manufacture of lead-acid batteries. It is added at the rate of 0.6 g per kg of the oxide while preparing the paste. It is believed to enhance the hydrophobicity of the negative plate, particularly during dry-charging process. It also reduces the extension of oxidation of the freshly formed lead (negative active material) when the plates are kept for drying in the open atmosphere after the process of tank formation. As a consequence, the charging time of a dry uncharged battery during initial filling and charging (IFC) is comparatively lower, as compared to a battery assembled with plates which do not contain stearic acid additive. Fatty acids are classic components of candle-making. Stearic acid is used along with simple sugar or corn syrup as a hardener in candies. In fireworks, stearic acid is often used to coat metal powders such as aluminium and iron. This prevents oxidation, allowing compositions to be stored for a longer period of time. Metabolism An isotope labeling study in humans concluded that the fraction of dietary stearic acid that oxidatively desaturates to oleic acid is 2.4 times higher than the fraction of palmitic acid analogously converted to palmitoleic acid. Also, stearic acid is less likely to be incorporated into cholesterol esters. In epidemiologic and clinical studies, stearic acid was found to be associated with lowered LDL cholesterol in comparison with other saturated fatty acids.  Salts and esters  Stearates are the salts or esters of stearic acid. The conjugate base of stearic acid, C17H35COO‚àí, is also known as the stearate anion. =Examples= ;Salts * Calcium stearate * Lithium stearate * Magnesium stearate * Sodium stearate * Zinc stearate ;Esters * Estradiol stearate * Glycol stearate * Stearin * Testosterone stearate References External links *NIST Chemistry WebBook Entry Category:Fatty acids Category:Stearates Category:Alkanoic acids Category:E-number additives ","title":"Stearic acid"},{"id":"338512","text":"Christopher William Burford III (born January 31, 1938) is a former American football wide receiver.

Built as part of the Peachtree Center complex, construction was finished in 1992, and has been the second-tallest building in Atlanta since then. When completed, it was the 28th tallest building in the world, and 21st tallest building in the United States. Since Atlanta's tallest, the Bank of America Plaza, is located in nearby Midtown, SunTrust Plaza is the tallest in the downtown area. History Architect and developer John C. Portman, Jr. originally conceived this building in the 1980s commercial real-estate frenzy as a speculative office building. Its basic design elements, a postmodern square tower with an elaborate base and crown, represented a departure for Portman from his earlier International-style work, and are said to have been inspired by Philip Johnson's wildly successful design for midtown Atlanta's One Atlantic Center. Ground broke in 1989 with great fanfare, but by completion in 1992, the bottom had fallen out of Atlanta's real estate market and the building sat largely empty, nearly forcing Portman into bankruptcy and causing him to lose control of most of his real estate holdings. His architectural firm, John Portman & Associates, located their headquarters in the building. In the mid-1990s, Portman sold half his interest in the building to SunTrust Bank, which then moved its headquarters to the building, prompting a name change from One Peachtree Center to its current name. The two-level lobby is filled with many works of art, sculpture and furniture designed by John Portman. Recent events The building was one of several struck by the mid-March 2008 Atlanta tornado, however it did not sustain damage as severe as most of the other buildings just south of it. Several offices had to be temporarily relocated within the building due to broken windows. LPTV station WDTA-LD relocated to the top of the building, from the even-taller Bank of America Plaza. Despite long being Atlanta's second-tallest skyscraper, this is its first broadcast antenna. The building has been since its construction the home of John Portman & Associates Architects. Atlanta's SunTrust Plaza building is home to a peregrine falcons' nest in planters on a balcony more than 50 stories above ground. High above any natural predators, the planters offer soft substrate and afford some protection from harsh weather. Peregrine falcons have been nesting at SunTrust Plaza since 1997. This Georgia Department of Natural Resources' Wildlife Resources Division web-camera offers viewers a unique look at the peregrines nesting activities in real-time.

History It is the third-tallest in Atlanta, reaching a height of with 50 stories of office space with a total building area of 1,187,676 sq.ft. It was completed in 1987 and remained the tallest building in Atlanta until 1992, when it was surpassed by the Bank of America Plaza, which was also built in Midtown. It was also the tallest building in the southeastern U.S. at the time of completion, surpassing the Southeast Financial Center in Miami. Design The building was commissioned by Prentiss Properties as a southeastern headquarters for IBM, a company responsible for many notable skyscrapers of the 1980s. Aside from introducing Atlanta to the postmodern architectural idiom of the 80s, this tower is notable for essentially creating what is now the Midtown commercial district. Located at the then-remote corner of 14th and West Peachtree Street over a mile from Downtown, this building nevertheless opened nearly fully occupied and thus attracted developers to Midtown. Architecture The building's exterior is clad in pink Spanish granite and culminates in a copper pyramidal top with a gold peak. The design includes gothic flourishes, most noticeably below the copper top of the building. At night the peak and ridges along the top are illuminated brightly, creating a glowing effect. Other phases It was joined in 2001 by the much shorter Regions Plaza building, which bears similar postmodern design and was constructed across the street as the second phase of the Atlantic Center development. Atlantic Center Plaza's design and architecture are so similar, it has affectionately become known in Atlanta as the \\"Mini Me\\" building, named after the comical dwarfish clone of Dr. Evil in the Austin Powers movies. Development One Atlantic Center was designed by Johnson/Burgee Architects. As associate architect, Heery International, Inc. produced the contract documents.

Eugene Ormandy (born Jen≈ë Blau; November 18, 1899 ‚Äì March 12, 1985) was a Hungarian-American conductor and violinist, best known for his association with the Philadelphia Orchestra, as its music director. His 44-year association with the orchestra is one of the longest enjoyed by any conductor with a single orchestra. Under his baton, the Philadelphia Orchestra had three gold records and won two Grammy Awards. Early life Ormandy was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary, as Jen≈ë Blau, the son of Jewish parents Rosalie and Benjamin Blau, a dentist who was also an amateur violinist. Ormandy began studying violin at the Royal National Hungarian Academy of Music (now the Franz Liszt Academy of Music) at the age of five. He gave his first concerts as a violinist at age seven and, studying with Jen≈ë Hubay, graduated at 14 with a master's degree. In 1920, he obtained a university degree in philosophy. In 1921, he moved to the United States. Around this time Blau changed his name to \\"Eugene Ormandy\\"; \\"Eugene\\" being the equivalent of the Hungarian \\"Jen≈ë\\". Accounts differ on the origin of \\"Ormandy\\"; it may have either been Blau's own middle name at birth, or that of his mother. He was first engaged by conductor Ern√∂ Rap√©e, a former Budapest friend and fellow Academy graduate, as a violinist in the orchestra of the Capitol Theatre in New York City, a 77-player ensemble which accompanied silent movies. He became the concertmaster within five days of joining and soon became one of the conductors of this group. Ormandy also made 16 recordings as a violinist between 1923 and 1929, half of them using the acoustic process. Arthur Judson, the most powerful manager of American classical music during the 1930s, first heard Ormandy when he conducted (as a freelancer) for a dance recital at Carnegie Hall by Isadora Duncan; Judson later said, \\"I came to see a dancer and instead heard a conductor\\".Herbert Kupferberg, liner notes for a 1981 recording of Tchaikovsky's Symphony no. 6 by the Philadelphia Orchestra and Ormandy, Delos 3016 Judson greatly assisted Ormandy's career, and when Arturo Toscanini was too ill to conduct the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1931, Judson asked Ormandy to stand in. This led to Ormandy's first major appointment as a conductor, in Minneapolis. Marriages On 8 August 1922 Ormandy married Stephanie Goldner (1896‚Äì1962).‚ÄúWhat Do You Want To Know?‚Äù Philadelphia Inqurer, 18 September 1938. ‚ÄúSteffy‚Äù Goldner had come to New York in 1921 from her native Vienna, where she had attended the city‚Äôs Academy of Music.

Career =Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra= Ormandy served from 1931 until 1936 as conductor of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (now the Minnesota Orchestra). During the depths of the Great Depression, RCA Victor contracted Ormandy and the Minneapolis Symphony for many recordings. A clause in the musicians' contract required them to earn their salaries by performing a certain number of hours each week (whether it be rehearsals, concerts, broadcasts, or recording). Since Victor did not need to pay the musicians, it could afford to send its best technicians and equipment to record in Minneapolis. Recordings were made between January 16, 1934, and January 16, 1935. There were several premiere recordings made in Minneapolis: John Alden Carpenter's Adventures in a Perambulator; Zolt√°n Kod√°ly's H√°ry J√°nos Suite; Arnold Schoenberg's Verkl√§rte Nacht and a specially commissioned recording of Roy Harris's American Overture based on \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\". Ormandy's recordings also included Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 7 and Mahler's Symphony No. 2, which became extremely well known. =Philadelphia Orchestra= Ormandy's 44-year tenure with the Philadelphia Orchestra began in 1936 and became the source of much of his lasting reputation and fame. Two years after his appointment as associate conductor under Leopold Stokowski, he became its music director. (Stokowski continued to conduct some concerts in Philadelphia until 1941; he returned as a guest conductor in 1960.) As music director, Ormandy conducted from 100 to 180 concerts each year in Philadelphia. Upon his retirement in 1980, he was made conductor laureate. Ormandy was a quick learner of scores, often conducting from memory and without a baton. He demonstrated a formal and reserved podium manner in the style of his idol and friend, Arturo Toscanini. One orchestra musician complimented him by saying: \\"He doesn't try to conduct every note as some conductors do.\\" Under Ormandy's direction the Philadelphia Orchestra continued the lush, legato style originated by Stokowski and for which the orchestra was well known. Ormandy's conducting style was praised for its opulent sound, but also was criticized for supposedly lacking any real individual touch. In the book Dinner with Lenny, containing one of the last interviews of Leonard Bernstein, Ormandy is criticized by Bernstein for applying the same lush sound to every piece that he conducted, even if the composer of the piece in question did not call for it, a criticism that Bernstein voiced indirectly in The Sound of an Orchestra, one of the Young People's Concerts. Ormandy was particularly noted for conducting late Romantic and early 20th century music. He particularly favored Bruckner, Debussy, Dvo≈ô√°k, Ravel, Richard Strauss, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius, and transcriptions of Bach. His performances of Beethoven, Brahms, Haydn, and Mozart were considered less successful by some critics, especially when he applied the lush, so- called \\"Philadelphia Sound\\" to them. On the other hand, Donald Peck, principal flute of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, reports that a fellow flutist was won over when Ormandy conducted the Chicago in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony; he told Peck that it was the greatest Ninth he had ever heard. He was particularly noted as a champion of Sergei Rachmaninoff's music, conducting the premiere of his Symphonic Dances and leading the orchestra in the composer's own recordings of three of his piano concertos in 1939‚Äì40. He also directed the American premiere of several symphonies by Dmitri Shostakovich. He made the first recording of Deryck Cooke's first performing edition of the complete Mahler Tenth Symphony, which many critics praised. His recording of Camille Saint-Sa√´ns' Third Symphony received stellar reviews and is held in high regard. He also performed a great deal of American music and gave many premi√®res of works by Samuel Barber, Paul Creston, David Diamond, Howard Hanson, Walter Piston, Ned Rorem, William Schuman, Roger Sessions, Virgil Thomson, and Richard Yardumian. The conductor Kenneth Woods ranked Ormandy 14th of the \\"Real Top 20 of Conducting,\\" saying, > Critics hate Ormandy. It must be the first \\"fact\\" they teach at critic > school ‚Äì always work in an Ormandy slam into every article you write. Record > collectors hate him, too. I just don't get it. The film of him looks pretty > impressive ‚Äì classical and classy conducting technique, not at all showy. > His Philadelphia Orchestra was the only real rival to Karajan's Berlin for > sonic beauty in the 50s-70s, but was also a tighter and more versatile band. In 1947, Ormandy appeared in the feature film Night Song in which he conducted Leith Stevens' Piano Concerto, with Arthur Rubinstein as soloist. Ormandy visited Finland several times. Here he is seen in 1951 with Jean Sibelius (left) and Nils-Eric Ringbom in Sibelius' home, Ainola. The Philadelphia Orchestra under Ormandy's direction frequently performed outside of Philadelphia, in New York and other American cities, and undertook a number of foreign tours. During a 1955 tour of Finland, Ormandy and many of the Orchestra's members visited the elderly composer Jean Sibelius at his country estate; Ormandy was photographed with Sibelius and the picture later appeared on the cover of his 1962 stereo recording of the composer's first symphony. During a 1973 tour of the People's Republic of China, the Orchestra performed to enthusiastic audiences that had been isolated from Western classical music for many decades. Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra, as well as smaller ensembles composed of its members, often collaborated with Richard P. Condie (and later Jerold Ottley) and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir to produce many recordings still considered definitive today, most notably the Grammy- winning recording of the Peter Wilhousky arrangement of the Battle Hymn of the Republic. After Ormandy officially retired as music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1980, he served as a guest conductor of other orchestras and made a few recordings. =Guest appearances= He also appeared as a guest conductor with many other orchestras. On 14 August 1944, in a free concert for service personnel, he conducted the Brisbane Symphony Orchestra in the Brisbane City Hall. This concert was organised by the Australian Broadcasting CommissionAustralian War Memorial, AWM52 8/5/1/28 - May - August 1944. In November 1966, he recorded Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k's New World Symphony with the London Symphony Orchestra. This and a recording in July 1952, which he conducted anonymously with the Prades Festival Orchestra with Pablo Casals in the Robert Schumann Cello Concerto, represented his only commercial recordings made outside the U.S. In December 1950 he directed New York's Metropolitan Opera in a production of Johann Strauss' Die Fledermaus in English, which also was recorded. In 1978, he conducted the New York Philharmonic in a performance of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3, with Vladimir Horowitz as soloist for a live recording. =Awards and honors= * In honor of Ormandy's vast influence on American music and the Philadelphia performing arts community, on December 15, 1972 he was awarded the prestigious University of Pennsylvania Glee Club Award of Merit. Beginning in 1964, this award \\"established to bring a declaration of appreciation to an individual each year that has made a significant contribution to the world of music and helped to create a climate in which our talents may find valid expression.\\" * The Presidential Medal of Freedom by Richard M. Nixon in 1970 * The Ditson Conductor's Award for championing American music in 1977 * Appointed by Queen Elizabeth II an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1976 * Awarded the Kennedy Center Honors in 1982 * Named Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia's person of the Year in 1979 and inducted into their Hall of Fame in 2003. * He was a recipient of Yale University's Sanford Medal. Death Ormandy died of pneumonia at his home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on March 12, 1985, at the age of 85. His papers, including his marked scores and complete arrangements, fill 501 boxes in the archives of the University of Pennsylvania Library. Recordings Eugene Ormandy's many recordings spanned the acoustic to the electrical to the digital age. From 1936 until his death, Ormandy made hundreds of recordings with the Philadelphia Orchestra, spanning almost every classical music genre. Writing in Audoin (1999), Richard Freed wrote: \\"Ormandy came about as close as any conductor anywhere to recording the \\"Complete Works of Everybody,\\" with more than a few works recorded three and four times to keep up with advances in technology and/or to accommodate a new soloist or to commemorate a move to a new label.\\" Thomas Frost, the producer of many of Ormandy's recordings for Columbia Records, called Ormandy \\"...the easiest conductor I've ever worked with ‚Äî he has less of an ego problem than any of them ... Everything was controlled, professional, organized. We recorded more music per hour than any other orchestra ever has.\\" In one day, March 11, 1962, Ormandy and the Philadelphia recorded Sibelius's Symphony No. 1; the Semyon Bogatyryov arrangement of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 7 (for which Ormandy had given the Western hemisphere premiere performance); and Delius's On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring. The orchestra's performing venue at the Academy of Music (Philadelphia) was seldom employed for recording, because record producers believed that its dry acoustics were less than ideal. Moreover, Ormandy felt that the remodeling of the Academy of Music in the mid-1950s had ruined its acoustics. The Philadelphia Orchestra instead recorded in the ballroom of Philadelphia's Broadwood Hotel/Philadelphia Hotel, the Philadelphia Athletic Club at Broad and Race Streets, and in Town Hall/Scottish Rite Cathedral on North Broad Street near the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. The latter venue featured a 1692 seat auditorium with bright resonant acoustics that made for impressive-sounding \\"high fidelity\\" recordings. A fourth venue was the Old Metropolitan Opera House used for later EMI recording sessions. Recordings were produced for the following record labels: RCA Victor Red Seal (1936 to 1942; 1968 to 1980), Columbia Masterworks Records (1944 to 1968), and EMI/Angel Records (1977-on). Three late albums were also recorded for Telarc (1980) and Delos (1981). Ormandy's first digital recording was a performance of B√©la Bart√≥k's Concerto for Orchestra for RCA in 1979. Ormandy recorded for RCA Victor in Minneapolis (in 1934 and 1935), and continued with the label until 1942, when an American Federation of Musicians ban on recordings caused the Philadelphia Orchestra to switch to Columbia, which had reached an agreement with the union in 1944, before RCA did so. Among his first recordings for Columbia was a spirited performance of Borodin's Polovtsian Dances. Ormandy conducted his first stereophonic recordings in 1957; these were not the orchestra's first stereo recordings because Leopold Stokowski had conducted experimental sessions in the early 1930s and multi- track recordings for the soundtrack of Walt Disney's 1940 feature film Fantasia. In 1968, Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra returned to RCA; among their first projects was a new performance of Tchaikovsky's Sixth symphony, the Pathetique. His recordings of Camille Saint-Sa√´ns' Symphony No. 3 'Organ' were considered the best ever produced by Fanfare Magazine which remarked of the recording with renowned organist Virgil Fox: \\"This beautifully played performance outclasses all versions of this symphony.\\" The Telarc recording of the symphony with Michael Murray (organist) is also highly praised. Ormandy was also famous for being an unfailingly sensitive concerto collaborator. His recorded legacy includes collaborations with Arthur Rubinstein, Claudio Arrau, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Vladimir Horowitz, Rudolf Serkin, David Oistrakh, Isaac Stern, Leonard Rose, Itzhak Perlman, Emil Gilels, Van Cliburn, Emanuel Feuermann, Robert Casadesus, Yo-Yo Ma, Sergei Rachmaninoff and others. =Recording premieres= World premiere recordings made by the Philadelphia Orchestra under Ormandy's baton included: * Richard Strauss,Symphonia Domestica, RCA Victor, May 1938 * Sergei Prokofiev, Alexander Nevsky, Jennie Tourel (mezzo-soprano), Westminster Choir. RCA Victor, May 1945 * Prokofiev, Symphony No. 6. Columbia, January 1950 * Prokofiev, Symphony No. 7. Columbia, April 1953 * Dmitri Shostakovich, Cello Concerto No. 1, Mstislav Rostropovich (cello). Columbia, November 1959 * Gustav Mahler, Symphony No. 10. Columbia, November 1965. First commercial recording of all five movements, using Deryck Cooke's performing version Ormandy also conducted the premiere American recordings of Paul Hindemith's Symphony: Mathis der Maler, Carl Orff's Catulli Carmina (which won the Grammy Award for Best Classical Choral Performance in 1968), Shostakovich's Symphonies 4, 13, 14, and 15, Carl Nielsen's Symphonies 1 and 6, Anton Webern's Im Sommerwind, and Krzysztof Penderecki's Utrenja. Ormandy also commissioned a version of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition which he and the Philadelphia Orchestra could call their own, since the Ravel arrangement was at that time still very much the property of Serge Koussevitzky, who had commissioned it, made its first recording with the Boston Symphony, and published the score. So Ormandy asked Lucien Cailliet (1891‚Äì1984), the Philadelphia Orchestra's 'house arranger' and a member of its woodwind section, to provide a new orchestration of Pictures at an Exhibition and he conducted its premiere on 5 February 1937, recording it for RCA Victor later that same year.

Designed by Johnson/Burgee Architects and Kendall/Heaton Associates Inc, the building was completed in 1990 and is the fourth tallest in the city, winning the BOMA Building of the Year Awards the next year, repeating in 1998 and 2003. Tenants and history Throughout the 1990s 191 Peachtree was considered Atlanta's premier business address. However, when two of its largest tenants, law firm King & Spalding, and Wachovia moved to Midtown's new 1180 Peachtree and Atlantic Station respectively in 2006, most of the building was left vacant. That same year, Cousins Properties purchased the building from Equity Office Properties, which marked a return to 191 for the company as it helped originally develop the building. Cousins relocated their headquarters to the building, signed a number of small tenants to subdivided space and in January 2008, signed an agreement with Deloitte to extend and expand the consulting firm's current lease from , bringing the building back to 87 percent occupancy. The building is located on the former site of the Hotel Majestic, which in the early 20th century was one of the city's major hotels.Atlanta and Its Builders: A Comprehensive History of the Gate City, Volume 2, Thomas H. Martin, pp. 106-107 Design The building was originally proposed in July 1987 at 48 floors. The building's facade is made of flame finished Rosa Dante granite and the windows are made of gray tinted glass. Each \\"tower\\" possesses a rooftop crown that is illuminated at night. The lighted double crown figured prominently in night footage taken by helicopter during the 1996 Olympics.

At and 73 stories, a total building area of 1,196,240 sq.ft and a diameter, the tower is the fourth-tallest hotel in the Western Hemisphere, and the 30th tallest all-hotel building in the world. History Street level view of the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel The first building on the site was the first official Georgia Governor's Mansion in Atlanta, a Victorian-style home purchased by the state in 1870 at the southwest corner of Peachtree Street and Cain Street (later International Boulevard, now Andrew Young International Boulevard). After housing 17 governors of Georgia (each limited to a single term of office) until 1921, it was demolished in 1923 for the Henry Grady Hotel, named for Atlanta Constitution newspaper journalist/magnate and philanthropist Henry W. Grady. That and the Roxy Theatre were in turn demolished for the current building. Designed by developer/architect John Portman, the hotel opened on February 27, 1976https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/real_talk/2016/02/westin- peachtree-plaza-celebrates-40-years.html as the Peachtree Plaza Hotel, managed by Western International Hotels. The hotel was Atlanta's tallest building until 1987, when it was overtaken by One Atlantic Center. It was the tallest hotel in the world for a year, until it was surpassed in 1977 by its architectural twin, the Detroit Plaza Hotel, the central tower of the Portman- designed Renaissance Center in Detroit. It was also the tallest building in the southeastern United States, surpassing One Shell Square in New Orleans. It lost that title in 1983, when the Southeast Financial Center in Miami surpassed it. It was the tallest building in downtown Atlanta for 13 years until it was surpassed by 191 Peachtree Tower, which in turn was surpassed by SunTrust Plaza (then One Peachtree Center). It still has more floors than any other building in Atlanta, as well as the state of Georgia. Western International Hotels was rebranded as Westin Hotels in 1981, and the hotel was soon after renamed The Westin Peachtree Plaza. The hotel was heavily featured in the 1981 film Sharky's Machine starring Burt Reynolds. Stuntman Dar Robinson, doubling for Henry Silva at the end of the film, dropped from what appeared to be the Westin Peachtree Plaza, setting a record for the highest freefall (unrestrained) jump from a building in a film. In actuality, however, the stunt scene was filmed at the nearby Hyatt Regency Hotel, using its shorter but similar cylindrical-shaped Radius Tower. Architectural details Inside the Westin Peachtree Plaza The building is cast in reflective glass in a cylindrical shape that reflects much of the downtown skyline (though each of the around 5600 windows are flat and not convex). Another small cylinder runs the full height of the building on one side, and accommodates two scenic elevators. The uppermost floors hold the Sun Dial Restaurant and Bar, a revolving restaurant that offers panoramic views of the city and its environs. The top floor of the restaurant completes a full revolution every 30 minutes, and the bottom every 60 minutes. When the building first opened in 1976, the seven-story tall lobby atrium rose out of a half-acre, fountain-filled indoor lake known as the \\"lagoon\\". The lobby bar was surrounded by large, oval \\"cocktail islands\\" which appeared to float on the lake and the entire area was decorated with tapestries, sculptures, cages with live birds and over 100 trees. According to a contemporary postcard, architect Portman designed this area \\"as a modern interpretation of a Venetian Plaza\\". In a newspaper advertisement, the hotel called the lobby \\"more like a park\\" and claimed it was \\"a total departure from any other you've ever seen.\\" Not everyone was impressed, however. In a humorous 1982 column dismissing the extravagance of modern hotel lobbies, George F. Will complained that \\"Atlanta's Peachtree Plaza has a lobby that Lewis and Clark could not have found their way across\\". He compared the \\"pond-like body of water\\" to \\"a Walden in everything but charm in which you can drown yourself, which you might wish to do\\". Eventually, the lake was drained and lobby redesigned as a more standard hotel gathering place with carpet, chairs and sofas. The hotel was also notable for its Peachtree Ballroom, which was the largest in Atlanta when it opened, seating 3,500 people. It has since been surpassed by the Georgia International Convention Center, which lays claim to having the largest ballroom in the state of Georgia.Westin Peachtree, center, background, Atlanta skyline Broadcasting Several local broadcasters have transmitted from an antenna mast atop the building, beginning when it became Atlanta's tallest, but declining since others have been built around it. The original antenna once carried the signal of WUPA TV 69 from the time it first went on-air as WVEU, but that station moved because the Westin tower lacked space for an antenna to send the station's digital television signal. Two LPTV stations currently transmit from the top: analog WTBS-LP 26, and digital-only WTHC-LD 42.1. , WTBS-LP is moving to the Bank of America Plaza, from the same antenna as co-owned WANN-LP/WANN- CD, and possibly future digital WTBS-LD 30. The main FM antenna (the four large elements seen at the top of the mast in both outdoor pictures on this page) recently belonged to WZGC FM 92.9 (\\"Dave FM\\"), while a smaller antenna still carries backup signals for that station and previously for WVEE FM 103.3 (\\"V-103\\"), both owned by CBS Radio. WWWQ FM 100.5 (\\"Q100\\", now WNNX FM \\"Rock 100.5\\") first used the same antenna when it moved to Atlanta, before it upgraded and relocated within the city, but it has since switched back. WSTR FM 94.1 (\\"Star 94\\") also shared the main FM antenna with 92.9 when it was originally installed, with the power from both stations' transmitters being combined into a single antenna through a diplexer. Both WSTR and WZGC still list this as their allotment location. There is also an XM Satellite Radio repeater. 2008 tornado Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel tornado damage Window repair as of March 2010 On March 14, 2008, the Westin, along with other neighboring skyscrapers, sustained moderate damage when a tornado tore through downtown Atlanta, with over 500 windows broken. It was the first tornado to have hit the downtown area. The building reportedly swayed back and forth about two feet (more than half a meter) in either direction, as it was designed. By 2009, the Westin was the only building in Downtown Atlanta to have not replaced its broken windows, which instead were still covered with black-painted plywood on the outside, and drywall on the inside. This is because the ¬º-inch (6mm) uninsulated glass was no longer made by PPG Industries, and even identical new windows would look mismatched because of weathering due to three decades of hot sunshine. Additionally, new building codes require insulated glass that can withstand winds up to instead of , necessitating heavier and more expensive glass. Replacement of all 6,350 windows was expected to begin in June or July 2009 and continue from the top down until summer 2010 at a cost of over $20 million. Like the original, the new windows are also mirrored, but feature a slight bronze tint. Each pane measures and weighs with four panes required for each room. More than 600 tons of glass were to be recycled. Skanska completed the Westin Peachtree Plaza exterior window renovation in September 2010. On November 9, 2010, renovation of the Sundial Restaurant at the top of the building was completed, repairing tornado damage done to it two years prior. Deaths On March 22, 2016, 61-year-old employee Carolyn Robinson died after becoming locked inside a walk-in freezer. The hotel was fined $12,471 for exposing their employee to \\"entrapment hazards\\" and failing to ensure the exit door remained \\"unobstructed/unrestricted\\". On April 14, 2017, five-year-old customer Charlie Holt died from head injuries sustained in the Sun Dial restaurant, reportedly after becoming trapped between a wall and furniture. Charlie Holt got up from his seat at the table unnoticed by his parents. When the parents noticed him he was already trapped against the wall and booth. The boy's parents tried to break him free but their attempts proved no avail and he received an injury to his head. The boy died an hour later at Grady Memorial Hospital. As a result, the restaurant itself is still open, but the rotation feature has been indefinitely suspended.

His personal name was Liu Heng(ÂäâÊÅÜ). Liu Heng was a son of Emperor Gao of Han and Consort Bo, later empress dowager. When Emperor Gao suppressed the rebellion of Dai, he made Liu Heng Prince of Dai. After Empress Dowager L√º's death, the officials eliminated the powerful L√º clan, and deliberately chose the Prince of Dai as the emperor, since his mother, Consort Bo, had no powerful relatives, and her family was known for its humility and thoughtfulness. His reign brought a much needed political stability that laid the groundwork for prosperity under his grandson Emperor Wu. According to historians, Emperor Wen trusted and consulted with ministers on state affairs; under the influence of his Taoist wife, Empress Dou, the emperor also sought to avoid wasteful expenditures. Historians noted that the tax rates were at a ratio of \\"1 out of 30\\" and \\"1 out of 60\\", corresponding to 3.33% and 1.67%, respectively. (These rates are not for income taxes, but property taxes, as the only ancient Chinese attempt to levy an income tax would come in the time of Wang Mang.) Warehouses were so full of grain that some of it was left to decay. Emperor Wen was said by Liu Xiang to have devoted much time to legal cases, and to have been fond of reading Shen Buhai, using Xing-Ming, a form of personnel examination, to control his subordinates. In a move of lasting importance in 165 BC, Wen introduced recruitment to the civil service through examination. Previously, potential officials never sat for any sort of academic examinations. Their names were sent by local officials to the central government based on reputations and abilities, which were sometimes judged subjectively.Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 87 Life =Prince of Dai= In 196 BC, after Emperor Gao defeated the Chen Xi rebellion in the Dai region, he made Liu Heng, his son by Consort Bo, the Prince of Dai. The capital of the principality was at Jinyang (, modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Dai was a region on the boundaries with Xiongnu, and Emperor Gao probably created the principality with the mind to use it as a base to defend against Xiongnu raids. For the first year of the principality's existence, Chen, whose army was defeated but who eluded capture, remained a threat, until Zhou Bo killed him in battle in autumn 195 BC. It is not known whether at this time Prince Heng, who was then seven years old, was already in Dai, but it seems likely, because his brother Liu Ruyi was the only prince at the time explicitly to have been recorded to be remaining at the capital Chang'an rather than being sent to his principality. In 181 BC, after Prince Heng's brother, Prince Liu Hui of Zhao, committed suicide over his marital problems, Grand Empress Dowager L√º, who was then in effective control of the imperial government, offered the more prosperous Principality of Zhao to Prince Heng, but Prince Heng, judging correctly that she was intending to make her nephew L√º Lu prince, politely declined and indicated that he preferred remaining on the border. The grand empress dowager then made L√º Lu Prince of Zhao. During these years, the Principality of Dai did in fact become a key position in the defense against Xiongnu, and Prince Heng became well-acquainted with Xiongnu customs and military strategies, although the extent of his own participation in military actions was unknown. =Accession= In 180 BC, after Grand Empress Dowager L√º died and the officials made a coup d'etat against her clan and slaughtered them (during the L√º Clan Disturbance), after some deliberation, the officials offered the imperial throne to Prince Heng, rather than Prince Liu Xiang of Qi, the oldest grandson of Emperor Gao. The key to their decision was that Prince Xiang's maternal clan was domineering and might repeat the behaviors of the L√º clan, while the clan of Prince Heng's maternal clan, the Bos, were considered to be kind and humble. After some hesitation, Prince Heng, then 23 years old, accepted the throne as Emperor Wen. His nephew, Emperor Houshao, viewed as a mere puppet of Grand Empress Dowager L√º and suspected of not being actually a son of Emperor Wen's older brother Emperor Hui, was deposed and executed. =Early reign= Ceramic female attendants from the tomb of Empress Dou (d. 135 BC), Western Han dynasty, Shaanxi History Museum, Xi'an Emperor Wen quickly showed an aptitude to govern the empire with diligence, and appeared to be genuinely concerned for the people's welfare. Heavily influenced by his wife Empress Dou, who was an adherent of Taoism, Emperor Wen governed the country with the general policies of non-interference with the people and relaxed laws. His personal life was marked by thriftiness and general willingness to forgive. He was initially very deferential to Zhou Bo, Chen Ping, and Guan Ying (), who were instrumental in his accession, and they served as successive prime ministers. Examples of Emperor Wen's policies that showed kindness and concern for the people include the following: * In 179 BC, he abolished the law that permitted the arrest and imprisonment of parents, wives, and siblings of criminals, with the exception of the crime of treason. * In 179 BC, he created a governmental assistance program for those in need. Loans or tax exemptions were offered to widowers, widows, orphans, and seniors without children. He also ordered that monthly stipends of grain, wine, and meat be given to seniors over 80 years of age, and that additional stipends of cloth and cotton be given to seniors over 90 years of age. * In 179 BC, he made peace with Nanyue, whose king Zhao Tuo Empress Dowager L√º had offended with an economic embargo and which therefore engaged in raids against the Principality of Changsha (modern Hunan) and the Commandery of Nan (modern Hubei). Emperor Wen accomplished this by writing humble yet assertive letters to Zhao offering peace with dignity and by caring for Zhao's relatives remaining in his native town of Zhending. * In 178 BC, after a solar eclipse (then viewed as a symbol of divine displeasure), he requested that officials give him honest criticism and recommend capable individuals for governmental positions. He also tried to decrease mandatory taxes and hard labor. In 179 BC, after some hesitation (during which he, apparently influenced by the theory of shanrang (), thought that maybe it would be more proper for him to find the wisest person in the empire and offer the throne to him, or that he should consider offering the throne to his uncle Liu Jiao (), the Prince of Chu; his cousin Liu Pi (), the Prince of Wu; or his younger brother Liu Chang (), the Prince of Huainan), he made his oldest son Liu Qi the Crown Prince and Prince Qi's mother, Consort Dou, Empress. In addition to Empress Dou, Emperor Wen also favored Consort Shen (). Despite her favored state, however, she only wore simple dresses rather than elaborate designs, as a means of savings. Emperor Wen, during the early part of his reign, was often impressed with suggestions tendered by a young official, Jia Yi, but opposed by senior officials, he did not promote Jia to particularly high positions; rather, Jia was put into a rotation as a teacher for various princes. Jia proposed dividing the larger principalities ruled by branch lines of the imperial family, a proposal that Emperor Wen agreed with but hesitated to actually carry out, and he did not actually implement Jia's proposal, which later might have prevented the Rebellion of the Seven States. =Middle reign= An incident otherwise uncharacteristic of Emperor Wen occurred in 176 BC. Zhou Bo, who had been instrumental in Emperor Wen's becoming emperor and who had by that point retired to his March of Jiang (, in modern Linfen, Shanxi), was falsely accused of treason. Instead of doing initial investigations first, Emperor Wen had Zhou arrested and incarcerated. It was only with the intercession of his mother Empress Dowager Bo and his daughter Princess Changping (, Zhou's daughter-in-law) that Zhou was released, and the charges against him dismissed. In 175 BC, over the objections of Jia Yi, Emperor Wen issued an edict permitting any person to mint money (then only in the form of coins) out of copper and tin. The main beneficiaries of this policy were those with access to copper, including the court official Deng Tong () (see also below), to whom Emperor Wen had given a major copper mine in Yandao (, in modern Yaan, Sichuan), and Liu Pi, the Prince of Wu, whose principality had a major copper mine at Yuzhang (, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi). In 174 BC, a major incident occurred involving Liu Chang, the Prince of Chen, who was by then Emperor Wen's only living brother. Emperor Wen had great affection for him and did not punish him for using styles and ceremonies that only emperors were supposed to use. Also, contrary to imperial laws, Prince Chang issued edicts within his own principality and also commissioned his own prime minister. He also carried out executions and made titles for people‚Äîtwo powers that were also reserved to the emperor. Emperor Wen constantly excused him for his indiscretions‚Äîwhich included killing Shen Yiji (), the Marquess of Piyang‚Äîbut eventually became unhappy. He asked his uncle Bo Zhao () to write a letter to Prince Chang to try to change his ways. Instead, Prince Chang was offended and planned a rebellion. When the conspiracy was discovered, Emperor Wen stripped Prince Chang of his title and exiled him to Yandao‚Äîwith the intent to teach him a lesson and then summoning him back. However, on the way, Prince Chang died‚Äîprobably by suicide. In 172 BC, Emperor Wen, missing Prince Chang dearly and still lamenting his death, made his sons Liu An, Liu Bo (), Liu Ci (), and Liu Liang () marquesses, again over Jia Yi's objection. Also in 174 BC, when the Xiongnu's new chanyu Laoshang came to power, Emperor Wen continued the heqin policy by giving him a prince's daughter in marriage. In 170 BC, Emperor Wen's uncle Bo Zhao, who had been instrumental in his administration, killed an imperial messenger. Emperor Wen forced him to commit suicide. This incident drew criticism from later historians, who believed that he should have curbed Bo's powers earlier and saved his life in that manner. In 169 BC, Chao Cuo (), then a low-level official, offered Emperor Wen a number of suggestions for dealing with the Xiongnu. Emperor Wen was impressed, and made him a member of Crown Prince Qi's household. At Chao's suggestion, in 168 BC, Emperor Wen instituted the policy that if people contributed food for use by the northern defense force against Xiongnu, they could receive titles or have their crimes pardoned. In 167 BC, Emperor Wen banned the corporal punishments of facial tattoo and cutting off the nose or a foot, and replaced them with whipping. These punishments would not be instituted again as a matter of formal legal sentencing for the rest of Chinese history. (However, as was later noted, this actually caused more deaths, and so the amount of whipping was further reduced in 156 BC by Emperor Jing.) =Late reign= Later in his reign, Emperor Wen became superstitious and started to search for supernatural events. In 165 BC, at the instigation of the sorcerer Xinyuan Ping (), he built a temple north of Wei River dedicated to five gods. He then promoted Xinyuan and awarded him with much treasure. At Xinyuan's suggestion, Emperor Wen planned a thorough revision of the governmental system and the building of many temples. In 164 BC, Xinyuan Ping had an associate place a jade cup outside the imperial palace with mysterious writings on them, and also predicted a regression in the path of the sun. (This phenomenon has never been adequately explained, but might have actually been a partial solar eclipse.) In response, Emperor Wen joyously proclaimed an empire-wide festival and also restarted the calendaring for his reign. (Therefore, the years 163 BC and on, for the rest of his reign, were known as the later era of his reign.) However, in winter 164 BC, Xinyuan was exposed to be a fraud, and he and his clan were executed. That ended Emperor Wen's period of supernatural fascination. In 158 BC, when the Xiongnu made a major incursion into the Commanderies of Shang (, modern northern Shaanxi) and Yunzhong (, modern western Inner Mongolia, centered on Hohhot), Emperor Wen made a visit to the camps of armies preparing to defend the capital Chang'an against a potential Xiongnu attack. It was on this occasion that he became impressed with Zhou Bo's son Zhou Yafu as a military commander; compared to the other generals, who, upon the emperor's arrival, dropped all things and did what they could to make the emperor feel welcome, Zhou remained on military alert and required the imperial guards to submit to proper military order before he would allow the imperial train to enter. Later, he would leave instructions for Crown Prince Qi that if military emergencies arose, he should make Zhou his commander of armed forces‚Äîinstructions that were heeded during the Rebellion of the Seven States. Emperor Wen died in summer 157 BC. He was succeeded by Crown Prince Qi. Emperor Wen, in his will, reduced the usual mourning period to three days, contrary to the previous lengthy periods of mourning in which weddings, sacrifices, drinking, and the consumption of meat were disallowed, thus greatly reducing the burden on the people. He also ordered that his concubines be allowed to return home. (Before and after Emperor Wen, generally, imperial concubines without children were required to guard the emperor's tomb for the rest of their lives.) Legacy Emperor Wen's reign and that of his son Emperor Jing were often collectively known together as the \\"Rule of Wen and Jing\\", renowned for general stability and relaxed laws. He was considered one of the most benevolent rulers in Chinese history. His reign was marked by thriftiness and attempts to reduce burdens on the people, with one of the lowest tax rate in Chinese history was recorded. Two years after his death, the tax rate was as low as 3.3% of one's personal income.Book of Han.vol.24. The benevolent way of ruling of Emperor Wen was influenced by the philosophy of Confucianism. Confucian scholar Jia Yi was the mastermind behind Emperor Wen's policy. He strongly empathized the importance of agriculture as well as the egalitarian way of wealth distribution according to the doctrines of Confucius. Book of Han.vol.24. Emperor Wen was also noted for his filial piety, and he was listed as one of The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars. According to one story, Emperor Wen's mother fell ill for three years, and Emperor Wen tended her whenever he was available. He also personally tasted all the soups and medicines that were served for his mother's treatment first to make sure they were adequate before serving them to his mother. Era names These \\"era names\\" are not true \\"era names\\", but are retrospective, in the sense that the era-name system, as instituted by Emperor Wen's grandson Emperor Wu, had not yet come into effect. Emperor Wen, in accordance with prior imperial calendrical systems, would have simply referred to the number of years in his reign. But he reset the calendar once at the persuasion of the sorcerer Xinyuan Ping (), thus historians need to refer to the eras before and after the resetting separately. *Qianyuan (, \\"Former Era\\") 179 BC-164 BC *Houyuan (, \\"Later Era\\") 163 BC-157 BC Family * Parents: ** Liu Bang, Emperor Gao (; 256‚Äì195 BC) ** Empress Gao, of the Bo clan (; d. 155 BC) * Consorts and Issue: ** Princess consort, of the L√º clan () *** Unnamed son *** Unnamed son *** Unnamed son *** Unnamed son ** Empress Xiaowen, of the Dou clan ({; d. 135 BC), personal name Yifang () *** Eldest Princess Guantao (; 189‚Äì116 BC), personal name Piao (), first daughter **** Married Chen Wu, Marquis Tangyi (; d. 130 BC), and had issue (two sons, Lady Chen) *** Liu Qi, Emperor Xiaojing (; 188‚Äì141 BC), first son *** Liu Wu, Prince Xiao of Liang (; 184‚Äì144 BC), second son ** Unknown *** Liu Can, Prince Xiao of Dai (; d. 162 BC), third son *** Liu Yi, Prince Huai of Liang (; d. 169 BC), fourth son *** Princess Changping () **** Married Zhou Shengzhi, Marquis Jiangwu (), a son of Zhou Bo, in 169 BC See also #Family tree of the Han Dynasty #Rule of Wen and Jing References * Book of Han, vol. 4. * . * . * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 12, 13, 14, 15.

It contains 52 stories of office space and was finished in 1982. Before the six-year era of tall skyscrapers to be built in Atlanta, it was Atlanta's second tallest building from 1982 to 1987. During that time period the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel was the tallest building in Atlanta. It has a stair-like design that staggers down to the ground, and is clad in pink granite quarried from Marble Falls, Texas.

The theatre could not be demolished because of its landmark status; it burned down in 1978, clearing the way for the tower. The architectural firm that designed it was Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. The general contractor who constructed the project was a joint venture of J.A. Jones Construction Company's Atlanta office and the H.J. Russell Company, also of Atlanta. The tower is the world headquarters of Georgia-Pacific. Other tenants include consulting firm McKinsey & Company and the downtown branch of the High Museum of Art, which opened in 1986. On March 14, 2008, the tower sustained minor damage when a tornado tore through downtown Atlanta. A number of windows were blown out. It was the first tornado to hit the downtown area since weather record keeping began in the 1880s. The Consulate-General of the United Kingdom is located in the building.\\"British Consulate-General - Atlanta .\\" United Kingdom in the United States. Retrieved on July 28, 2009. The building served as a filming location for the 1985 action film Invasion U.S.A. starring Chuck Norris and Richard Lynch, in which it served as the setting for the final battle between the U.S. Army and the army of international terrorists.

It was organized by African Americans and whites from Mississippi to challenge the established power of the Mississippi Democratic Party, which at the time allowed participation only by whites, when African-Americans made up 40% of the state population. Origins In Mississippi African Americans were persuaded away from registering and voting by means of intimidation, harassment, terror, and confusingly complicated literacy tests. They had been limited from participation in the political system since 1890 by passage that year of a new state constitution, and by the practices of the ruling white Democrats in the decades since, with participation in the state Democratic Party limited to whites. Starting in 1961, SNCC and COFO had waged campaigns to register black voters. In June 1963, African Americans attempted to cast votes in the Mississippi primary election but were prevented from doing so. This contest to determine Democratic candidates was essentially the only competitive race, as the state was a one-party jurisdiction. Unable to vote in the official election, an alternative \\"Freedom Ballot\\" for an election to take place at the same time as the scheduled November voting. With this election seen as a protest action to dramatize the denial of their constitutional voting rights, close to 80,000 people cast freedom ballots for an integrated slate of candidates.Freedom Ballot in MS ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans In response, Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker, and Bob Moses, founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in 1964. As a result, they encountered violent opposition included activists being intimidated with church, home, and business burnings and bombings, beatings, and arrests of blacks. Building the party With partial participation in the regular Mississippi Democratic Party blocked by segregationists, the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) built on the success of the Freedom Ballot by formally establishing the MFDP in April 1964 as a non-discriminatory, non-exclusionary rival to the regular party organization. The MFDP hoped to replace the regulars as the officially recognized Democratic Party organization in Mississippi by winning the Mississippi seats at the 1964 Democratic National Convention for a slate of delegates elected by some black and white Mississippians and white sympathizers. Building the MFDP was a major thrust of the Freedom Summer project. After it proved to be impossible to register black voters against the opposition of state officials, Freedom Summer volunteers switched to building the MFDP using a simple, alternate process of signing up party supporters that did not require blacks to openly defy the power structure by trying to register at the courthouse or for blacks and poor whites to take a complex and unfair literacy test. By the end of August 1964 the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party had gained so much attention nationally that its delegates had 80,000 members belonging to their racially integrated party. In time some activists from the Northeast, including some of the Freedom Riders, would come to dominate the administration of the new party.  State Convention in Jackson, Mississippi On August 4, before the state convention, the bodies of James Earl Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman were discovered buried in an earthen dam. They had been workers with CORE, registering people to vote for the MFDP, and had been murdered for their activism. Missing for weeks since disappearing after investigating a church burning in June 1964, they were subjects of a massive manhunt that involved the FBI and United States sailors from a nearby base. The murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner drew national attention and generated outrage, emboldening the MFDP to be the party to represent the state of Mississippi. On August 6, 1964, the MFDP held a statewide convention before attending the DNC; 2,500 people showed up at the Masonic Temple. They decided to take the party to the national credentials committee and attempt to be seated as the delegation from Mississippi. Joseph Rauh, the MFDP legal counsel and a foremost civil liberties attorney, spoke at the convention. He said that the MFDP was the only party in the state loyal to the national Democratic Party and that its chances of success were excellent. Ella Baker was the keynote speaker at the state convention. She did not deliver the kind of address that the people were expecting on voting and rights but made a statement about society: > I'm not trying to make you feel good. We have to know what we are dealing > with and we can't deal with things just because we feel we ought to have our > rights. We have to deal with them on the basis of knowledge that we gain ... > through sending our children through certain kinds of courses, through > sitting down and reading at night instead of spending our time at the > television and radio just listening to what's on. But we must spend our time > reading some of things that help us to understand this South we live in. The state convention gave the MFDP confidence in their ability to effect change on the national level. They elected Fannie Lou Hamer, E.W. Steptoe, Winson Hudson, Hazel Palmer, Victoria Gray, Rev. Ed King, Aaron Henry and Annie Devine as electors from the state to the national convention. The day after the state convention, James Chaney was buried in his hometown of Meridian, Mississippi. Dave Dennis gave an impassioned speech about the loss of this young man. > Those are the people who don't care. ... That includes the President on down > to the governor of the state of Mississippi ... I blame the people in > Washington D.C., and on down in the state of Mississippi for what happened > just as much as I blame those who pulled the trigger. ... He's got his > freedom, and we're still fighting for ours. In the face of unrelenting violence and economic retaliation by the White Citizens Council, the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, and other opponents, the MFDP held local caucuses, county assemblies, and a statewide convention (as prescribed by Democratic Party rules) to elect 68 delegates (including four whites) to the 1964 Democratic National Convention scheduled for Atlantic City, New Jersey in August. 1964 Democratic National Convention Aaron Henry reading from a document while seated before the credentials committee The MFDP sent its elected delegates by bus to the convention. They challenged the right of the Mississippi Democratic Party's delegation to participate in the convention, claiming that the regulars had been illegally elected in a completely segregated process that violated both party regulations and federal law, and that the regulars had no intention of President Lyndon B. Johnson, the party's candidate, in the November election. They asked that the MFDP delegates be seated rather than the segregationist regulars.The Mississippi Movement & the MFDP ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans Some of the original members of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegation in 1964 were Lawrence Guyot, Peggy J. Conner, Victoria Gray, Edwin King, Aaron Henry, Fannie Lou Hamer, Annie Devine, and Bob Moses. Dr. Martin Luther King told President Johnson that he would \\"do everything in my power to urge (The MFDP) being seated as the only democratically constituted delegation from Mississippi.\\" King also voiced his support to Congress, \\"I pledge myself and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to the fullest support of the challenges of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic party and call upon all Americans to join with me in this commitment.\\" The Democratic Party referred the challenge to the convention credentials committee. The MFDP delegates lobbied and argued their case, and large groups of supporters and volunteers established an around-the-clock picket line on the boardwalk just outside the convention. The MFDP prepared a legal brief detailing the reasons why the \\"regular\\" Mississippi delegation did not adequately represent their state's residents, including the tactics employed to exclude participation by Black citizens. Jack Minnis wrote, \\"MFDP, with the help of SNCC, produced brochures, mimeographed biographies of the MFDP delegates, histories of the MFDP, legal arguments, historical arguments, moral arguments\\" that were distributed to all of the Convention's delegates.Carmichael, Stokely, and Charles V. Hamilton. Black Power: The Politics of Liberation, (New York: Random House, 1967), p. 90. Their actions attracted considerable publicity. Fannie Lou Hamer, mid- speech to the credentials committee The credentials committee televised its proceedings, which allowed the nation to see and hear the testimony of the MFDP delegates, particularly the testimony of Fannie Lou Hamer. She gave a moving and evocative portrayal of her hard brutalized life as a sharecropper on a cotton plantation in the Mississippi Delta and the retaliation inflicted on her for trying to register to vote. After that, most knowledgeable observers thought the majority of the delegates were ready to unseat the regulars and seat the MFDP delegates in their place. But some of the all-white delegations from other southern states threatened to leave the convention and bolt the party (as they had done in previous years) if the regular Mississippi delegation was unseated. President Johnson had wanted a convention stressing unity and feared losing Southern support in the coming campaign against Republican Party candidate Barry Goldwater. To ensure his victory in November, Johnson maneuvered to prevent the MFDP from replacing the regulars. After a frantic scramble, he ordered the chairman of the credentials committee to avoid deciding the matter or sending the issue to the convention. With the help of Senator Hubert Humphrey (a potential candidate for vice president) and Party leader Walter Mondale, Johnson engineered a \\"compromise\\" in which the national Democratic Party offered the MFDP two at-large seats, rather than replacing the regular Democratic delegates from their state. This allowed them to watch the floor proceedings but not take part. The MFDP refused this \\"compromise,\\" which permitted the white-only regulars, who had not been democratically elected, to keep their seats and denied votes to the MFDP. MFDP leader and Mississippi NAACP President Aaron Henry stated: > Now, Lyndon made the typical white man's mistake: Not only did he say, > 'You've got two votes,' which was too little, but he told us to whom the two > votes would go. He'd give me one and Ed King one; that would satisfy. But, > you see, he didn't realize that sixty-four of us came up from Mississippi on > a Greyhound bus, eating cheese and crackers and bologna all the way there; > we didn't have no money. Suffering the same way. We got to Atlantic City; we > put up in a little hotel, three or four of us in a bed, four or five of us > on the floor. You know, we suffered a common kind of experience, the whole > thing. But now, what kind of fool am I, or what kind of fool would Ed have > been, to accept gratuities for ourselves? You say, Ed and Aaron can get in > but the other sixty-two can't. This is typical white man picking black > folks' leaders, and that day is just gone. The MFDP was willing to accept a compromise proposed by Oregon Congresswoman Edith Green, that \\"loyal\\" Democrats of both delegations be seated. This compromise was not accepted by the national party, which instead selected the \\"regular\\" party to represent the state of Mississippi, those whom, on July 28, 1964, had passed the following resolution:Carmichael and Hamilton p.92. > We opposed, condemn and deplore the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ... We believe > in separation of the races in all phases of our society. It is our belief > that the separation of the races is necessary for the peace and tranquility > of all the people of Mississippi and the continuing good relationship which > has existed over the years ...Carmichael and Hamilton p.93. The MFDP left the Convention rather than be compromised by accepting the two seats. President Johnson had tried to prevent Fannie Lou Hamer from making her speech. After the United States heard her speech, different parts of the population were outraged and began calling into the White House seeking justice for African Americans in the South. The next year President Johnson persuaded Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which authorized the federal government to oversee elections at the state and local level, and enforce practices that would support legitimate voter registration and voting in areas with an historic under-representation of certain parts of the population. Fannie Lou Hamer said, \\"We didn't come all this way for no two seats, 'cause all of us is tired.\\"Mills, Kay, This Little Light of Mine: The Life of Fannie Lou Hamer, (New York: Plume, 1994), p. 5. Although denied official recognition, the MFDP kept up their agitation within the Convention. When all but three of the regular Mississippi delegates left because they refused to support Johnson against Goldwater, the Republican Party candidate, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic northern delegates and took the vacated seats. The national Party would not allow them to stay. The next day the MFDP delegates returned to discover that convention organizers had removed the empty seats; they stayed to sing freedom songs. Johnson lost Mississippi in the 1964 presidential election, as whites had still suppressed the black vote. White Democrats were becoming more conservative and voted for Goldwater. With the exception of the 1976 presidential election, when favorite son Jimmy Carter of Georgia was the Democratic candidate, Mississippi has never voted for the Democratic presidential candidate since. Aftermath The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP. For a while, it became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited Malcolm X to speak and opposed the war in Vietnam. For the better part of a year after hosting the statewide mock election in November 1964, most of the organization's efforts went into challenging the seating of the elected congresspersons of Mississippi to the U.S. House of Representatives. They argued to Congress that, because of the state's disfranchisement, half of the electorate was prevented from participating in the election of those representatives. The FDP had 149 votes in Congress supporting its position; however, the House leadership (dominated by senior Southern Democrats) and Johnson's White House were appalled at this idea and rejected overturning the Democratic representatives from Mississippi. Many Civil Rights Movement activists felt betrayed by Johnson, Humphrey, and the liberal establishment. The movement had been promised that if it concentrated on voter registration rather than protests, it would be supported by the federal government and the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. Instead, at the decisive moment, they believed that black civil rights and justice had been sacrificed for the political interests of white politicians. As SNCC Chairman John Lewis later wrote: > As far as I'm concerned, this was the turning point of the civil rights > movement. I'm absolutely convinced of that. Until then, despite every > setback and disappointment and obstacle we had faced over the years, the > belief still prevailed that the system would work, the system would listen, > the system would respond. Now, for the first time, we had made our way to > the very center of the system. We had played by the rules, done everything > we were supposed to do, had played the game exactly as required, had arrived > at the doorstep and found the door slammed in our face. Though the MFDP failed to unseat the regulars at the convention, they did succeed in publicizing the violence and injustice by which the white power structure governed Mississippi and disenfranchised black citizens. The dramatic elements of the MFDP and its convention challenge eventually helped gain congressional passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The MFDP actions resulted in the national party adopting a new policy: its credentials committee banned seating delegations that had been chosen through racial discrimination. The MFDP continued as an alternate for several years as African Americans began to register and vote in the regular political system. Many of the people associated with it continued to press to implement civil rights in Mississippi. After passage of the Voting Rights Act, the number of registered black voters in Mississippi grew dramatically. The regular party stopped discriminating against blacks and agreed to conform to the Democratic Party rules guaranteeing fair participation. Eventually, the MFDP merged into the regular party and many MFDP activists became party leaders. The FDP has only one active chapter, in Holmes County. After the MFDP was disbanded, many formed a new party, the Loyal Democrats of Mississippi. In 1968, they were successful at the DNC in being seated as the only delegation from Mississippi. Several of these delegates were members of the MFDP. Militants, including John Buffington (S. N. C. C. (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) field worker in Clay County, chairman of the Clay County Community Development Organization and member of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party) and Rudy A. Shields (S. N. C. C. (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) field worker in Copiah County), challenged the white Mississippi power structure, economically and electorally. They were charged with the firebombing of On 24 January 1970, the office of the Clay County Community Development Organization on 24 January 1970. The next day, dynamite exploded the Clay County Courthouse. A grand jury declined to induct them. Several months later, one of the militants, John Thomas, Jr., was assassinated, in broad daylight, and the accused killer was found not guilty, claiming self-defense.\\"Mississippi White Cleared in Killing.\\" https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/12/archives/mississippi- white-cleared-in-killing.html See also * National Democratic Party of Alabama * Progressive Democratic Party (South Carolina) References  Further reading  * Hamer, Fannie Lou, The Speeches of Fannie Lou Hamer: To Tell it Like it is', Univ.

It has 40 stories of office space and its construction was completed in 1990. It is currently the seventh-tallest skyscraper in Atlanta. Set just off Peachtree Street on 15th Street, it sits on the same block as One Atlantic Center and was only the second major office tower in Midtown. It is set diagonally to the street grid to maximize its impact on the skyline and allow tenants better views. It is clad in reflective glass and has a ziggurat-like tapering spire with stainless steel fins that are lit at night. Promenade was intended to be the first of three towers of identical design on the block that it occupies. The two other towers, of 48 and 58 stories, were never built due to the collapse of the commercial real estate market in the early 1990s. Promenade itself was originally planned for (57 stories) but was scaled back before completion due to the market collapse. The land they were to occupy is now home to the 41-story 1180 Peachtree Street office tower. The architectural firms that worked on this project were Thompson, Ventulett, Stainback & Associates (TVS) and the Ai Group. TVS, which was also responsible for the Concourse at Landmark Center highrise development on Atlanta's northern edge, has its headquarters in the building. The engineering firm that worked on the Promenade was Thompson Company, Inc. (TCI). TCI is also responsible for the Concourse at Landmark Center. On Aug. 22, 2014, one of the largest tenants in Promenade II filed a lawsuit in an attempt to stop owner Cousins from placing signage on three sites of the tower. In a court filing in support of the legal action, Thomas Ventulett III, one of the lead architects on Promenade II, said the signage would \\"certainly diminish the dignified character and aesthetic design of the spire and lighting at the top of the building.\\"Decorated Atlanta Architect: Signage Would Detract from Promenade's Presence, Skyline Views, Aug. 27, 2014.

BellSouth Corporate headquarters was located in the Campanile building, also in Midtown. Background The company, then called Southern Bell, originally planned to build the parking deck for the tower one block further east at the corner of Ponce de Leon Avenue and Peachtree Street. This would have required the razing of the historic Fox Theatre which would have been an especially great loss to the city after the downtown Loew's Grand Theatre was destroyed by fire in 1978. Tremendous opposition, protests, fundraising, and petition drives within the community prevented the Fox's demolition. Even Liberace spoke out on behalf of the \\"Fabulous Fox\\". In the end, a complicated deal was struck to build the parking deck on an alternate site north of the main tower on West Peachtree Street. The building has a direct entrance to the North Avenue MARTA Station, which is located at the southern end of the complex and was built concurrently with the building. In 2002, BellSouth completed construction of two additional mid-rise buildings adjacent to the tower to form its BellSouth Midtown Center campus as part of its effort to consolidate office space around mass transit stations. The architects who designed the tower were Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and Rosser International, Inc. The general contractor for its construction was Beers Skanska, Inc.

Ecology  Dianthus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including cabbage moth, double-striped pug, large yellow underwing and the lychnis. Also three species of Coleophora case-bearers feed exclusively on Dianthus; C. dianthi, C. dianthivora and C. musculella (which feeds exclusively on D. superbus). Dianthus alpinus Sweet William Dwarf, Dianthus barbatus Dianthus superbus  Cultivation  Since 1717, dianthus species have been extensively bred and hybridised to produce many thousands of cultivars for garden use and floristry, in all shades of white, pink, yellow and red, with a huge variety of flower shapes and markings. They are often divided into the following main groups:- * Border carnations ‚Äì fully hardy, growing to , large blooms * Perpetual flowering carnations ‚Äì grown under glass, flowering throughout the year, often used for exhibition purposes, growing to * Malmaison carnations ‚Äì derived from the variety 'Souvenir de la Malmaison', growing to , grown for their intense \\"clove\\" fragrance * Old-fashioned pinks ‚Äì older varieties; evergreen perennials forming mounds of blue-green foliage with masses of flowers in summer, growing to * Modern pinks ‚Äì newer varieties, growing to , often blooming two or three times per year * Alpine pinks ‚Äì mat-forming perennials, suitable for the rockery or alpine garden, growing to Over 100 varieties have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (see the List of Award of Garden Merit dianthus).  Culture  In the language of flowers, pink Dianthus symbolize boldness. Dianthus gratianopolitanus ‚Äì the Cheddar pink ‚Äì was chosen as the county flower of Somerset in 2002 following a poll by the wild flora conservation charity Plantlife.Plantlife website County Flowers page. Dianthus japonicus is the official flower of Hiratsuka, Kanagawa, Japan.

In the United States, a farm-to-market road or ranch-to-market road (sometimes farm road or ranch road for short) is a state road or county road that connects rural or agricultural areas to market towns. These are better quality roads, usually a highway, that farmers and ranchers use to transport products to market towns or distribution centers. Distribution of Farm to Market (green) and Ranch to Market (brown) Roads Specifically, in the state of Texas, the terms Farm to Market Road and Ranch to Market Road indicate roadways that are part of the state's system of secondary and connecting routes, built and maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). Texas established this system in 1949 to improve access to rural areas. The system consists primarily of paved two-lane roads, though some segments have more lanes and some are even considered freeways. These roads are signed with route markers that contain the words FARM ROAD or RANCH ROAD, but the formal name is Farm to Market Road and Ranch to Market Road (hence the abbreviation \\"FM\\" and \\"RM\\" on signs). The only road that explicitly uses the name Ranch Road is Ranch Road 1, which runs near the former ranch home of former President Lyndon B. Johnson. As with other state- maintained highways in Texas, all Farm or Ranch to Market roads are paved. Speed limits along these roads vary, but may be as high as 75 mph in rural areas, such as in Andrews and Pecos counties (for example, along FM 1788, FM 1776, and FM 1053). History FM 218 outside Hamilton, Texas, a typical Texas farm-to-market road The first farm-to-market road in Texas was completed in January 1937 during the Great Depression. It connected Mount Enterprise and the former community of Shiloh in Rusk County. The route was long and was constructed at a cost of $48,015.12 ($ today). This route is now part of Texas State Highway 315. The first officially designated highway, FM 1 was authorized in San Augustine county in 1941 to connect US 96 near Pineland to a sawmill belonging to the Temple Lumber Company at Magasco. In 1945, the highway commission authorized a three-year pilot program for the construction of of farm-to-market roadways, with cost to be shared equally by the state and federal governments. As the program grew, efforts were made by legislators from rural areas, including State Senator Grady Hazlewood of Amarillo, to expand the farm-to-market road network in the late 1940s. The funding was to have come from an increase in the fuel tax, as proposed by State Senator Grover Morris in 1947; however, this measure was stymied by lobbyists, who supported such funding for arterial roads. The popularity of the program and the perceived need to connect the vast, isolated central and western areas of the state prompted the passing of the Colson-Briscoe Act in 1949, sponsored by State Senator E. Neveille Colson and State Representative Dolph Briscoe. This legislation appropriated funding for the creation of an extensive system of secondary roads to provide access to the rural areas of the state and to allow farmers and ranchers to bring their goods to market, reserving a flat $15 million per year ($ million today) plus 1 cent per gallon of gasoline sold in the state for local highway construction. In 1962, the Texas legislature inflation adjusted this amount to $23 million annually ($ million today), through federal fund matching, and expanded the farm-to-market system from . The system now accounts for over half of the mileage in the Texas Department of Transportation system. Identification Signs designating a Farm to Market or Ranch to Market road are a black square background containing a white shape of the state of Texas, with the words \\"FARM ROAD\\" or \\"RANCH ROAD\\" appearing in white text on the background and the route number in black text within the shape of Texas. Guide signs (the large green signs usually found along highways in the United States) designating these roads use a simple white rectangle with the abbreviation \\"F.M.\\" or \\"R.M.\\" and the route number appearing below the abbreviation in black text. As a result of population growth and the expansion of urban areas, many Farm to Market and Ranch to Market roads that originally served rural areas now serve urban areas, sometimes exclusively. An effort was made to rename such roads \\"Urban Roads\\" on June 27, 1995, but residents opposed the effort, arguing that removing the \\"Farm\\" and \\"Ranch\\" from the designations was \\"un-Texan,\\" and that the cost of changing signage was not justified. Other than a few route markers, such as on FM 1315 near Victoria, most signs were not changed, and TxDOT abandoned the idea to do so. However, though the Farm to Market and Ranch to Market designations remain in place on route signage, the state does continue to track these urban roads separately in its highway designation files. For example, the mileage of FM 544 in the Plano area was transferred from FM 544 to UR 544 in 1995. As part of the state highway system, Urban Roads are eligible for state maintenance; however, unlike rural Farm to Market and Ranch to Market roads, they do not receive state funding for expansion. On November 15, 2018, TXDOT changed all urban roads back to their previous FM and RM designations. The only part of the government or public that used \\"Urban Roads\\" from 1995-2018 was the internal highway database system used by TXDOT workers due to the 1995 order. The original 1995 order was fully rescinded by Minute Order 115371.http://ftp.dot.state.tx.us/pub/txdot/commission/2018/1115/4.pdf . Retrieved 4 January 2019. Roads like UR 544 have been redesignated as FM 544 in the database. Farm to Market and Ranch to Market roads are numbered as a single set of roads. There is not an FM and an RM with the same route number. Urban Roads were designated with the same route number as the FM or RM from which the mileage was transferred.

Business routes Route marker for Business Farm to Market Road 1960. Texas currently has two signed business routes of Farm to Market Roads: Business RM 1431 in Burnet County, and Business FM 1960 in Harris County. These routes are former alignments that have been bypassed by newer routings. A third business Farm to Market Road, Business FM 1187 in Tarrant County was cancelled and given to the cities of Burleson and Crowley on October 27, 2016.  Other states  Missouri has a similar state-operated system of farm-to-market roads, called Missouri supplemental routes. Missouri uses single (e.g., \\"A\\", \\"B\\", etc.) and double letters (e.g., \\"AA\\", \\"BB\\", etc.). Iowa also has a farm-to-market road system. Those roads are under county jurisdiction,Iowa Code 2003: Section 306.3. Retrieved March 28, 2006 but are eligible for state aid from a dedicated fund.Iowa Code 2001: Section 312.5.

The 1955 renumbering renumbered all routes based on an A-B-C system of route classification: A is primary, B secondary, and C farm-to-market. All routes 300 through 1266 are classified C routes.1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering Pennsylvania has a ‚Äúshadow‚Äù system of four digit state farm to market routes.

Construction The castle was probably erected in the 1230s, between 1232 and 1235, under the orders of William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby. No records of the castle construction survive, except the licence to fortify de Ferrers received in 1235. Nearby in West Derby, there had long been a castle, which was taken by the Ferrerses in 1232, but by 1296 it lay in ruins. The castle in Liverpool was built to protect King John's new port, and was sited at the top of modern- day Lord Street, the highest point in the city which overlooks the Pool. This corresponds to present day Derby Square (Queen Victoria Monument), near the city centre. Description The castle was built on top of a plateau, which had been specially constructed, and a moat measuring 20 yards (18 m) was cut out of solid rock. The main building of the castle consisted of the gatehouse flanked by two towers at the north-east corner which faced Castle Street; three round towers at the three remaining corners, one being added at a later date than the others, in 1442. Four curtain walls connected the four towers; the northern and southern walls were recessed to allow them to be commanded from the towers. Inside the castle were a hall and chapel, which were connected to the south-western tower, and a brewhouse and bakehouse. There was also a passage which ran under the moat toward the edge of the river. The courtyard was divided by a wall built running from the north wall to the south wall. Underneath the castle walls stood a dovecot, and an orchard ran from the castle to the Pool in the east. History A plan of Liverpool Castle made by 19th century historian Edward Cox. The plan was created using authentic records and contemporary sources. Upon the death of William de Ferrers in 1247, his son William inherited both Liverpool Castle and West Derby Castle. The heir to the title was Robert de Ferrers. He rebelled against King Henry III and was arrested and held in the Tower of London and then Windsor Castle. His lands and title were removed and taken back by the Crown. Henry III presented the land, along with Lancaster to his second son Edmund. Mary de Ferrers, wife of the forfeited earl and niece to the King, was ordered to surrender the castle in July 1266. The lands were then held by Edmund and passed onto his successor Thomas. It was under the administration of Thomas that Liverpool progressed steadily. The earl did not bestow much worth on the borough of Liverpool and in 1315 he granted the castle and the land to Robert de Holland. The creation of the patronage of Robert de Holland caused some unrest among other landowners, and on 25 October in the same year Adam Banastre, Henry de Lea and William de Bradshagh (Bradshaw) banded together (the Banastre Rebellion) and launched an attack on the castle, and were defeated within an hour. This is the only recorded attack on the castle to happen before the English Civil War. Between 1315 and 1323 the borough of Liverpool returned to the hands of the Crown. In 1323 King Edward II visited the town and lodged at the castle from 24 to 30 October. Early in the reign of Edward III the king utilised Liverpool as a port of embarkation in his wars with Scotland and Ireland. In 1327 Edward ordered the constable of the castle to give shelter to men fleeing from the Scots. There was an inquisition into the land at Lancaster in 1367 that stated \\"there is at Liverpull a certain Castle, the foss whereof and the herbage are worth by the year 2s., and there is a dovehouse under the Castle which is worth by the year 6s.8d.\\" Sir Richard Molyneux was appointed constable of the castle in 1440 and the title was made hereditary five years later. In 1442 the castle was strengthened by the addition of a fourth tower in the south-east corner to the cost of ¬£46 13s 10¬ºd. On 2 October 1559 the castle is stated as being \\"in utter ruin and decay\\". The Great Tower had a slate roof and it was suggested to be used as storage for the court rolls. It was decided that the castle would undergo repairs costing around ¬£150, \\"otherwaies it were a grate defacement unto the said towne of Litherpole\\". During the reign of Charles I the castle was seized by Lord Derby. In 1644 Prince Rupert and his men took the castle, which was later taken back by Sir John Moore. Protestant supporters of William of Orange seized the castle in 1689. On 5 March 1704 the burgesses obtained a lease for the castle and its site from the Crown for fifty years. William Molyneux, 4th Viscount Molyneux disputed this as he still claimed hereditary constableship. This delayed the settlement of the lease until 1726, when the last remaining ruins of the castle were removed. In 1707/08 a Mr. Serocold a London surveyor planning the wet dock suggested the castles stone would save money by reusing it to build the dock, it is possible this plan went ahead. Finally in 1715 an act was passed to demolish the castle and build a church in its place. Construction of St George's church began on the site of the old castle and the church was consecrated in 1734. By 1825 the church had been pulled down and a new one built in its place. In 1899 the church was demolished and the Victoria Monument was erected in 1902. In 1976 excavation of the south side of Castle Street was conducted before the construction of the Crown Courts building, which was built in the style of a castle. Replica Scale replica of Liverpool Castle as seen at Rivington In Lever Park, Rivington near Chorley, William Lever built a folly which is a scale replica of Liverpool Castle, known here as Rivington Castle, in ruins. Building started in 1912 and the replica, which was not completed, was based on a conjectural reconstruction of the castle prepared by E. W. Cox in 1892.

M.E.Ch.A. (Spanish: Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztl√°n; \\"Chicanx Student Movement of Aztl√°n\\", the x being a gender neutral inflection) is a US-based organization that seeks to promote Chicano unity and empowerment through political action. The acronym of the organization's name is the Chicano word mecha, which is the Chicano pronunciation of the English word match and therefore symbolic of a fire or spark; mecha in Spanish means fuse or wick. The motto of MEChA is 'La Union Hace La Fuerza'. Origins in the 1960s MEChA began during the 1960s, empowered through the political movements of the time, especially the civil rights and Chicano Movement. The group coalesced out of several organizations which had formed during that turbulent decade. In 1969, students from twelve universities met at a conference in Santa Barbara, California, and called for a unification of all student and youth organizations into one organization, MEChA. The Denver, Colorado-based Crusade for Justice, a civil rights and educational organization founded in the mid-1960s, concerned itself with the problems of the city's Chicano youth. One of the founding documents, \\"El Plan Espiritual de Aztl√°n\\", was drafted during this conference. This document reflects the sentiment of the Latino/Chicano youth during an era of a turbulent social climate (especially in the wake of violence experienced by Latino youth from the US military and police during the Zoot Suit Riots). The Mexican American Youth Organization was founded in San Antonio, Texas in 1967. It employed the tactics of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and later spurred the creation of the La Raza Unida Party. The Brown Berets were a youth organization that agitated against police brutality in East Los Angeles. In 1968, they helped the United Mexican American Students (UMAS), Sal Castro, and other youth who met at the Piranya Cafe organize the East L.A. walkouts, called the Blowouts, a series of protests against unfair conditions in Los Angeles schools. Following the Blowouts, a group of students, school administrators, and teachers formed the Chicano Coordinating Committee on Higher Education (CCCHE), a network to pressure the adoption and expansion of equal opportunity programs in California's colleges. Rene Nu√±ez, an activist from San Diego, conceived a conference to unify the student groups under the auspices of the CCCHE. In April 1969, Chicano college students held a nationwide conference at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). Many of the attendees were present at the First National Chicano Youth Liberation Conference hosted by Rodolfo \\"Corky\\" Gonzales' Crusade for Justice a month prior, and the Santa Barbara conference represented the extension of the Chicano Youth Movement into the realm of higher education. The name \\"Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztl√°n\\" was already in use by a few groups, and the name was adopted by the conference attendees because of the importance of each of the words and as a means of transcending the regional nature of the multiple campus-based groups. Conference attendees also set the national agenda and drafted the Plan de Santa B√°rbara, a pedagogic manifesto. MEChA chapters first took root on California college campuses and then expanded to high schools and schools in other states. It soon became one of the primary Mexican-American organizations, hosting functions, developing community leaders, and politically pressuring educational institutions. MEChA was fundamental in the adoption of Chicano Studies programs and departments in academia. Organizational structure =Affiliated chapters= MEChA exists as over 400 loosely affiliated chapters within a national organization. Typical activities of a MEChA chapters include educational & social activities, such as academic tutoring, mentorship, folklore and poetry recitals, exploring the way of life through an indigenous perspective bringing Chicano speakers to their campus, high school outreach, attending Statewide, Regional, & National Conferences. Many chapters are also involved in political actions, such as lobbying high school and university administrators for expanded Bilingual Education programs and Chicano-related curricula, the celebration of Mexican cultural traditions, as well as other Latin American holidays (such as Mexican Independence Day), Columbus Day protests, sit-ins, hunger strikes, boycotts, rallies, marches and other political activism relating to civil rights, affirmative action, and immigration. =National MEChA Constitution= The National MEChA constitution was ratified on April 9, 1995 during the second annual National MEChA conference at the University of California, Berkeley (Cal). The document outlines four objectives:Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztl√°n National Constitution . * Educational, cultural, economical, political, and social empowerment of Chicanos. * Retention of Chicano identity and furthering of cultural awareness. * Uplifting and mobilizing Chicanos and Chicanas through higher education. * Implementing plans of action concerning Chicanos and Chicanas. Since its adoption, the document has been amended five times: * Amended on April 14, 1996 at University of Texas, Pan American * Amended on April 14, 1997 at Michigan State University (MSU) * Amended on March 18, 2001 at San Diego State University (SDSU) * Amended on March 30, 2003 at University of California, Berkeley * Amended on May 30, 2010 at University of Washington, Seattle During the 1999 National Conference at Phoenix College, MEChA adopted a document entitled The Philosophy of MEChA which affirmed the more moderate view that \\"all people are potential Chicanas and Chicanos\\", and that \\"Chicano identity is not a nationality but a philosophy\\". In addition, The Philosophy of MEChA addressed the problem of outside organizations co-opting the legitimacy of MEChA to advance their own agendas, doing so by establishing guidelines to make local MEChA chapters more accountable to the national organization.  Geography  In 1969, MEChA was founded in Santa Barbara, California where Chicanos adopted \\"El Plan de Santa Barbara.\\" The manifesto provided a strategy to establish Chicano Studies Departments within colleges and universities. By consolidating students' political power, MEChA became a significant on-campus political force and the name signified a position to challenge social injustices and to reject assimilation through radical activism on-campus and in the community. While the student-led organization formed in California, MEChA became a national organization with chapters in junior middle schools, high schools, community colleges, and universities. Yet MEChA's geographic expansion was rather uneven. From 1969 to 1971, MEChA grew rapidly in California with major centers of activism on campuses in Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, San Diego, and the Riverside-San Bernardino area. Other early chapters were also established in Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, and Indiana. In these years, new chapters were founded at universities and colleges exclusively. By the early 1970s, a few MEChA chapters were founded in the East but mainly at Ivy League schools such as Harvard, Yale, and Brown University. MEChA largely remained a West coast organization. Expanding further in the 1980s, MEChA chapters began to appear in community colleges and high schools, but again predominantly in California and especially Southern California. Surprisingly, the organization did not catch on in Texas. A Mexican American Student Organization (MASO) was active at the University of Texas from 1967 until at least 1972 and students at St. Mary's College in San Antonio joined MAYO but there are no signs of MEChA chapters or other student groups in Texas until the mid-1980s. As for Florida and other southern states, we have found no information about any chapters in this part of the country despite the growing Mexican American presence on campuses and in the region's cities. But if MEChA's geography was limited, its ability to survive and expand in California and other western states was remarkable. Student organizations rarely last very long. But MEChA has expanded decade by decade. During the 1990s, MEChA experienced a decade of slow growth yet in the 2000s the organization saw an incredible upsurge of new chapters. High schools students led the charge predominantly within California and likely attributed to the anti-immigration (H.R. 4437) legislation proposed in the mid-2000s. Much like when MEChA was established, student mobilization has propelled and maintained the organization relevant for nearly fifty years. MEChA was one of the many organizations and groups that sponsored the Cinco de Mayo movement, the others included the Chicano student groups that were on campus and the community. The Cinco de Mayo movement was one of many big cultural events. Criticism In 2008, a passage from MEChA's national website read: 'As Chicanas and Chicanos of Aztl√°n, we are a nationalist movement of Indigenous Gente that lay claim to the land that is ours by birthright. As a nationalist movement we seek to free our people from the exploitation of an oppressive society that occupies our land. Thus, the principle of nationalism serves to preserve the cultural traditions of La Familia de La Raza and promotes our identity as a Chicana/Chicano Gente.' Such statements have led MEChA to be criticized by right-wing sources, including the National Review and Michelle Malkin which alleges that MEChA is tinged with racist and separatist views. The Times Online has referred to MEChA as \\"a radical Mexican student organisation\\" in describing the associations of 2003 California gubernatorial candidate Cruz Bustamante. Critics also point out the group's use of the word Aztl√°n: To many, this word calls to mind a mythical region comprising much of the Southwestern United States and as a result, some critics feel use of the phrase implies support for the controversial theory of reconquista. While MEChA supporters point out that the Aztlan mythology itself does not refer to reclaiming conquered lands, it simply describes the mythical home of the Aztec people. Critics of MECha regard the phrase \\"Por La Raza todo, Fuera de La Raza nada\\" as ethnocentric and racist. This phrase appears in El Plan Espiritual de Aztl√°n as the official \\"slogan\\" of MEChA. MEChA members themselves differ in their interpretations of \\"La Raza\\". While some use the term to strictly refer to only mestizos and Chicanos, others use it to mean all Hispanics and minorities. Jose Vasconcelos defined the \\"La Raza\\" racial supremacy doctrine for Hispanics and mestizos in his book, La raza c√≥smica. During WWII, Vasconcelos was one of the most prominent Nazi agents and propagandists in Mexico.The Nazi Collaboration of Jose Vasconcelos, scribd.com A possible origin of the phrase is the Cuban Revolution, which used the similar slogan \\"Por la revoluci√≥n todo, fuera de la revoluci√≥n nada!\\" According to the official MEChA website, the organization \\"does not exclude membership based on socio-economic status, gender, race, or orientation.\\" A 1998 MEChA youth conference at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly SLO) featured a printed program that introduced the school as \\"Cal Poly State Jewniversity\\". The program also referred to New York as \\"Jew York\\". When the Anti-Defamation League objected to the program, the Cal Poly MEChA organization issued a formal apology, a repudiation of the anti-Semitism and expelled those students who had been responsible for the production of the printed conference program. The National Council of La Raza has distanced itself from MEChA due to controversial allegations made by some of its members. In a public press release, NCLR declared, \\"NCLR freely acknowledges that some of the organization's founding documents, e.g., Plan Espiritual de Aztl√°n, contain inappropriate rhetoric, and NCLR also acknowledges that rhetoric from some MEChA members has been extremist and inflammatory... NCLR has publicly and repeatedly disavowed this rhetoric\\". However, the NCLR emphasized that MEChA's mission statement is to support Latino students at institutions of higher education. In reference to the rhetoric included in the Plan Espiritual de Aztl√°n, the NCLR quoted journalist Gustavo Arellano who commented in a Los Angeles Times op-ed article,\\"few members take these dated relics of the 1960s seriously, if they even bothered to read them.\\" Within the article, Arrallano also noted that all of the MEChA members of his class graduated from college and have gone on to successful careers, a rarity at a time when only 12% of Latinos have a college degree. Controversies *In May 1995, Voz Fronteriza, a publication of the MEChA chapter at the University of California, San Diego published an editorial entitled \\"Death of a Migra Pig,\\" which celebrated the recent death of Luis A. Santiago, a Latino Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) officer who died in the line of duty. The editorial stated that Santiago was a \\"traitor...to his race,\\" and that \\"We're glad this pig died, he deserved to die,\\" and argued, \\"All the Migra pigs should be killed, every single one...the only good one is a dead one...The time to fight back is now. It is time to organize an anti-Migra patrol...It is to [sic] bad that more Migra pigs didn't die with him.\\" The article generated public outrage, and Congressman Duncan L. Hunter threatened to pursue legislation that would eliminate federal funding for UCSD. UCSD defended the paper's right to publish the editorial, arguing that it was protected by Freedom of Speech.\\"Rep. Hunter demands apology; student editorial said border agents should die,\\" Jeff Ristine, San Diego Union-Tribune, July 6, 1995.Student Humor Magazine Prosecuted for Parody at UCSD: University Decision Expected This Week, Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), June 18, 2002.Double Standards at UCSD by Samantha Harris, Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), February 25, 2010. *On May 11, 1993, Chicano students at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) caused damage to the Faculty Center estimated between $35,000 to $50,000 during a riot which ensued following the university administration's rejection of the creation of a Chicano Studies program, an announcement that was made on the eve of C√©sar Ch√°vez's funeral.Bustamante Won't Renounce Ties to Chicano Student Group . Following this incident, MEChA students organized peaceful demonstrations at UCLA, including a 14-day hunger strike which garnered support from several California state leaders and ultimately resulted in the establishment of The C√©sar Ch√°vez Center. *In February 2002, MEChA members were accused of theft of an entire press run of a particular issue of the UC Berkeley conservative newspaper California Patriot which was featuring an article that labelled MEChA a \\"neo-Nazi\\"-like organization. Police reported that over 3,000 copies (valued at $1,500 - $2,000) were stolen during a break-in at the Patriot office in Eshleman Hall.

MEChA denied any involvement in the incidents and \\"condemns harassment,\\" said Livia Rojas, a leader in the group. The case was ultimately dropped as insufficient evidence was found to implicate any suspects.California Patriot Stolen at UC- Berkeley . *On May 18, 2006, nearly 2,000 copies (of a total run of 5,000 copies) of The Courier were removed from newspaper boxes on the Pasadena, California, campus, torn in half and returned to the paper's campus office with a signed note claiming responsibility. The letter expressed disappointment for the lack of coverage provided for a MEChA-hosted event on May 12, 2006, which had involved \\"months of hard work\\". It ended stating: \\"As students of P.C.C., we can not accept this issue of the Campus Courier.\\" However, student leaders of MEChA on campus maintained that the group as a whole was not responsible for the incident. A subsequent investigation determined that the theft had been committed by an individual MEChA member who admitted to acting alone. The student was ordered by the university to serve community service hours and repay the costs for the damaged issues. The Courier's advisor said that there was no lingering animosity between the paper and MEChA and that leaders from both organizations had met to discuss the incident.

Before March 2013, the name \\"GLAAD\\" had been an acronym for \\"Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation\\", but became the primary name due to its inclusiveness of bisexual and transgender issues. History Formed in New York City in 1985 to protest against what it saw as the New York Posts defamatory and sensationalized AIDS coverage, GLAAD put pressure on media organizations to end what it saw as homophobic reporting. Initial meetings were held in the homes of several New York City activists as well as after-hours at the New York State Council on the Arts. The founding group included film scholar Vito Russo; Gregory Kolovakos, then on the staff of the NYS Arts Council and who later became the first executive director; Darryl Yates Rist; Allen Barnett; Jewelle Gomez, the organization's first treasurer; and film critic Marcia Pally, who later served as acting Board chair. Politics of Ego: GLAAD Saga Unravelled, in Gay Community News, p.3 (March 1-7, 1987) Some members of GLAAD went on to become the early members of ACT UP. In 1987, after a meeting with GLAAD, The New York Times changed its editorial policy to use the word \\"gay\\" instead of harsher terms referring to homosexuality. GLAAD advocated that the Associated Press and other television and print news sources follow. GLAAD's influence soon spread to Los Angeles, where organizers began working with the entertainment industry to change the way LGBT people were portrayed on screen. Entertainment Weekly has named GLAAD as one of Hollywood's most powerful entities, and the Los Angeles Times described GLAAD as \\"possibly one of the most successful organizations lobbying the media for inclusion\\".Myers and Cress 2004: 200 Within the first five years of its founding in New York as the Gay and Lesbian Anti-Defamation League (soon after changed to \\"Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation\\" after legal pressure by the Anti-Defamation League), GLAAD chapters had been established in Los Angeles and other cities, with the LA chapter becoming particularly influential due to its proximity to the California entertainment industry. GLAAD/NY and GLAAD/LA would eventually vote to merge in 1994, with other city chapters joining soon afterward; however, the chapters continue to exist, with the ceremonies of the GLAAD Media Awards being divided each year into three ceremonies held in New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Following the 2011 resignation of Jarrett Barrios from the GLAAD presidency, Mike Thompson served as interim president until the announcement of Herndon Graddick, previously GLAAD's Vice-President of Programs and Communications, to the presidency on April 15, 2012. Graddick is the younger son of Charles Graddick of Mobile, a circuit court judge and the former Attorney General of Alabama. In 2013, Jennifer Finney Boylan was chosen as the first openly transgender co- chair of GLAAD's National Board of Directors. =Name change= On March 24, 2013, GLAAD announced that it had formally dropped the \\"Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation\\" from their name and would now be known only as GLAAD to reflect their work more accurately; the name change was a commitment to incorporate bisexual and transgender people in their efforts to support the LGBT community in its entirety. =Executives= Sarah Kate Ellis is the current president and CEO of GLAAD.The woman who saved GLAAD: how Sarah Kate Ellis brought the faltering nonprofit into the 21st century.

The campaign works to bring anti-bullying resources to classrooms all around the world by inspiring educators to take action against bullying through hosting events and rallies. The campaign also created a GLAAD's Spirit Day kit for use in classrooms, which is available in 6 languages. On social media, people are encouraged to wear purple or go purple online in order to stand united against bullying. Huge media companies such as NBC Universal and Viacom show support for Spirit Day on the airwaves. They even change their on-air logo to purple for the day. They also enlist talent who wear purple during the day's broadcast. More than 1.5 billion media impressions annually are seen in support of the campaign. The hashtag #Spirit Day has become a trending topic on Twitter and Facebook every year. On social media, people such as Oprah Winfrey, Ellen DeGeneres and President Barack Obama have shown their support for the campaign.

Cuiheng is southeast of downtown Zhongshan, and north of Macau. The whole village is designated a special economic district, as Cuiheng New Area. History The village was established in the latter half of the 17th century during the reign of Kangxi Emperor by the Feng and Mai families, who were later joined by the Yang and Lu (Èô∏) families. The Lu surname became most numerous. At the time of Sun Yat- sen's birth in the 1860s, there were about sixty households with ten surnames. In addition to Sun, Lu Muzhen, Sun's first wife and Lu Haodong (1868‚Äì1895), an early revolutionary martyr, were also born in Cuiheng. Administration Cuiheng is administrated by Nanlang Township. For a time, Cuiheng village was elevated to the township level and became the town of Cuiheng Village (). However, in 1998 it was downgraded and reintegrated inside the town of Nanlang. On 31 March 2013 Cuiheng was upgraded into a \\"New Area\\" and a co- operation pilot zone with Macau. Tourism Cuiheng is home to the Former Residence of Dr Sun Yat-sen (}) and the Sun Yat-sen Residence Memorial Museum (), which was built next to the residence in 1956.

First stamps Kingdom of Kabul\\". The first stamps appeared in 1871. They were round in shape, imperforate, and printed in black, with a crude lion's head, surrounded by Arabic script specifying one of three denominations. The lion, sher, represented the head of state, Sher Ali Khan, as he had been named for the bravery of a lion. Many catelogues and early collectors incorrectly referred to these as \\"tiger\\" heads.The picture was referred to as \\"sher\\", which is generic Indo-Aryan for large wildcat, but which in Afghan Dari means \\"lion\\", and in Hindi means \\"tiger\\". Cancellation was accomplished by cutting or tearing off a piece of the stamp. Cancellation by postmark was not introduced until 1891. Initially somewhat large, subsequent issues kept the same basic design but were smaller each year, with the last appearing in 1878. Starting in 1876, the stamps were printed in different colors, each color corresponding to one of the main post offices on the Peshawar-Kabul-Khulm route.https://web.archive.org/web/20180503063608/http://www.stampworldhistory.com/country- profiles-2/asia/afghanistan-%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%BA%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86/ Retrieved 12 August 2018. Each design in a sheet was individually engraved, so the stamps vary considerably in appearance. Many of the Sher Ali issues are readily available, while some sell for hundreds of US$. 1-abasi stamp of 1892. The defeat of Sher Ali by the British brought Abdur Rahman Khan to the throne in 1880, and the following year brought new stamps, still round, but with inscriptions in the middle instead of the lion's head. The era of round designs ended in 1891 with rectangular issues for the \\"Kingdom of Afghanistan\\". The three designs consisted entirely Arabic script, and were printed in a slate blue color. The 1892 issue featured the national seal consisting of a mosque gate and crossed cannons; it was printed in black on colored paper; at least 10 colors of paper were used, and there are many shades as well, even though all the colors had the same value. In 1894 simplified versions of this design were printed on green paper. The 1898 issues of the national seal on a variety of colored paper were not regularly issued. 1 abasi, 1909. In 1907 the first rouletted stamps were issued, along with imperforate varieties, depicting a whole mosque, with various surrounding ornamentation. In the 1909 issue the mosque was displayed inside an eight- pointed star pattern. Independence 15-poul imperf stamp of 1927, first use of Roman letters. The first issue after independence came out on 24 August 1920, a design featuring the royal star of King Amanullah. The three denominations were also the first to use Latin script for the numerals as well as Arabic. Beginning in 1924, each year at least one stamp was issued in February to commemorate independence, a pattern that held steady, with few omissions, until the 1960s. Parliament House on the 15p of 1939. Afghanistan joined the Universal Postal Union in 1928; previously international mail required stamps of British India. In 1927, the first Roman letters had appeared on an Afghan stamp, the inscription reading \\"AFGHAN POSTAGE\\". This changed to the French \\"POSTES AFGHANES\\" in 1928, and remained in that form (with some deviations, as in the 1939 issue) until 1989. The Afghan stamps of the 1930s and 1940s are rather plain affairs, mostly typographed, with large blank spaces in the design. The definitive series of 1951 was finely engraved by Waterlow and Sons, several featuring portraits of Mohammed Zahir Shah. A large number of Afghan stamps appeared in the 1960s. Since the Afghan Postal Authority issued some stamps well below the minimal amount of postage, this was considered to be a scheme for making money from stamp collectors. The issues from 1960 on are not especially notable. Starting in the mid-1980s, many of the issues were clearly produced to sell to Western stamp collectors; for instance, the ship series of 1986 is not especially relevant in a landlocked country. Civil war and after The disruption of governance in the late 80s and early 90s due to civil war and the rise of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, led to stopping of stamp issues from 1989 to 2001, although the postal service continued to exist it functioned only haphazardly using existing stamp supplies. There are only a few postal items known from the 1996 to 2001 period.An input by the UN office for Afghanistan in Islamabad for the UN Secretary-General‚Äôs report on the anti-Taleban sanctions stated in June 2001 that the flight ban for the state-own Ariana airline also disrupted the activities of the Afghan Postal Services, which had been gradually restored and extended over the past three years. During this interim period, many unofficial stamps were printed and distributed, which were disavowed by the Afghanistan postal service in 2000 under the Taliban, and subsequently in 2003 by the Karzai government. Stamp production resumed when the Taliban regime was overthrown and the Afghan Postal Authority reconstituted. The first issue of a postage stamp after the hiatus was the May 2002 stamp showing Ahmad Shah Massoud, a military general and national hero who defended Afghanistan against the Soviet Union in the 1980s and later led a resistance movement against the Taliban.

It is affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance. The headquarters is in Stabekk. History =First congregations= The first Baptist in Norway was Enok Richard Haftorsen Svee. Grown up in a Haugianer family in Orkanger, he moved to Copenhagen in 1837 to attend missionary training. There he came into contact with a group of unorganized Baptists and participated in the founding of Denmark's first Baptist congregation the following year. This was illegal at the time. Svee returned to Orkanger in 1842 and died a year later, never establishing a congregation in Norway.Eidberg (1976): 26 The Parliament of Norway passed the Dissenter Act on 16 July 1845, allowing Christian congregations outside the Church of Norway to be established. The Swedish Baptist Fredrik Olaus Nilsson visited Norway several times from 1851, but his preaching was futile.Eidberg (1976): 27 Instead the Danish preacher Fredrik L. Rymker from Odense was successful at establishing a congregation. The Danish community dispatched him to Norway to preach. He arrived in Skien on 21 September 1857 and started preaching in the various free churches there. He also travel around to neighboring towns.Eidberg (1976): 28 Carl Gundersen Konger√∏d became the first Baptist baptized in Norway, on 25 December 1858. By 22 April 1860 there were nine Baptists in the area and the Baptist Congregation in Porsgrunn and Solum was founded.Eidberg (1976): 29 Skien Baptist Church Rymker continued to travel and preach until 1862, funded through grants from congregations in the United States. He helped establish Larvik Baptist Congregation on 14 November 1860 and Krager√∏ Baptist Congregation on 31 August 1862.William H. Brackney, Historical Dictionary of the Baptists, Scarecrow Press, USA, 2009, p. 419 A congregation of baptists in Levanger was founded in 1862. New preachers arrived in Norway and the cause spread throughout the 1860s. Eidsvoll Baptist Congregation was founded on 29 August 1864 and in Melum on 25 December 1865. Additional congregations were founded in Arendal presumably on 14 August 1867, followed by Bergen, Troms√∏ and Tvedestrand in 1870. Two years later congregations were established in the towns of Langesund, Ris√∏r and Trondheim.Eidberg (1976): 30 Focus shifted to the capital Kristiania (today Oslo). The Swedish pastor Sven Svensson visited the city, funded by the Baptist Missionary Society (BMS) and helped incorporate a congregation in 1874. It became the subject to personal conflicts and part of the congregation split in favor of the Adventist Church, and the organization was disestablished in 1880. It was reestablished in 1884 and within a decade had become the largest Baptist congregation in the country.Eidberg (1976): 31 Oslo First Baptist Church All the congregations were established as independent denominations under the protection that the Dissenter Act provided, even if they could have as few as six members. Following a movement inspired by the United States, there was a trend towards weak congregationalism. This established a common understanding of the legal and organizational independence of each congregation, while retaining the need for a national administrative and theological coordination. By the early 1870s the congregations in Skien, Bergen, Trondheim and Troms√∏ had largely taken on regional responsibilities and covered areas far exceeding the city limits. The Baptist church in B√¶rum =Establishing the union= The S√∏nnenfjellske District Association was founded in 1872 as a cooperative body in Eastern Norway. Troms√∏ Missionary Society was founded in 1877. It originally was a subset of the Troms√∏ congregation, but was soon joined by newly established congregations in Northern Norway. The same year the congregations in Trondheim and Bergen established Vestenfjellske Missionary Society. These were responsible for inter-congregational coordination and activities, especially evangelism.Eidberg (1976): 32 The first national conference took place on 6 to 8 July 1877 in Bergen, with ten delegates from five congregations. For the first time the number of Baptists were calculated, totaling 511 at the end of 1867. The main organization outcome was the establishment of a committee to establish a common Sunday school curriculum. The following year a meeting was held in Bergen with most of the pastors in the country. BMS attended with a representative, Edward Bean Underhill. An agreement was made whereby a national union would be established and receive financial support from BMS.Eidberg (1976): 33 Another outcome of the meeting was the foundation of Adelfia, an association for the pastors.Eidberg (1998): 165 The Baptist church in Lillehammer. The formal decision to establish the Baptist Union of Norway was taken at the second national conference, held in Trondheim the following year. Thirteen delegates from eight congregations participated. Nine congregations joined the union, the remaining six refrained either because they were not represented at the conference or because they were feared the union would interfere in congregational affairs. Janne M. Sj√∂dahl was appointed the union's first chairman. It is officially founded in 1879.John H. Y. Briggs, A Dictionary of European Baptist Life and Thought, Wipf and Stock Publishers, USA, 2009, p. 358 The first inter-congregational bulletin was Palmebladet, first published by G. H√ºbert in 1879. Three years later the song book Salmer og Sang was published. Adelfia started publishing the national newsletter Unions-Banneret in 1880. These initiatives led to the union establishing a publishing office, Den evangeliske Bok & Traktatforening.Eidberg (1976): 38 Raufoss Baptist Church The Baptist communities in Norway enjoyed close relations with BMS in England and Scandinavian expatriate congregations in the United States through the American Baptist Missionary Union (ABMU). The latter was mostly concentrated in Minnesota. After first establishing a common Scandinavian seminary, it split and a Norwegian‚ÄìDanish seminary was established in the Chicago community of Morgan Park as part of the Baptist Union Theological Seminary. This remained the main point of contact with the American Baptist community. Forty- two Norwegians attended the seminary from 1884 to 1910.Eidberg (1976): 36 The establishment of the seminary caused a close connection between the Norwegian baptist congregations and that of the Midwestern United States. New impulses started to come from there. A major step took place in 1885, when pastors started to be ordinated.Eidberg (1998): 164 The number of baptist congregations reached eighteen in 1886, although the membership growth was significantly steeper with 1,335 members that year. Ten years later this had increased to 26 congregations and 2,132 members. It reached 35 congregations and 2,900 members in 1902.Eidberg (1976): 41 BMS announced in 1890 that it would withdraw all financial support for work in Norway from 1892. They cited that Norway no longer was seen as a missionary site, and that recruitment had drawn into stalemate. They also argued that the congregations should have the capacity to fund their own operations.Eidberg (1976): 35 The Baptist Union of Norway therefore contacted the Norwegian expatriate community. ABMU offered support to the union on the condition the Norwegians preached in line with the American organization's theology and that Norwegian international missionaries represent ABMU. =Establishment of institutions= The Norwegian Baptist Seminary, now the Norwegian School of Leadership and Theology, was founded in 1910 The Baptist Union of Norway became a founding member of the Baptist World Alliance in 1905 and J. A. √òhrn became an inaugural vice president.Eidberg (1976): 37 The Norwegian Baptist Seminary was founded in 1910, allowing both pastors and missionaries to be educated domestically for the first time. Olaf J. √òie was hired as the first rector, a role he held until his death in 1943. The seminary soon offered a bachelor-level degree.Eidberg (1976): 39 A separate Norwegian mission was created at the annual conferences in 1915. Fund-raising secured that Bernhard √Ölbu was able to travel to Belgian Congo. This was the first time that Norwegian Baptist missionaries traveled without being under the auspices of the ABMU. Due to the First World War he was not able to travel until 1918.Eidberg (1976): 112 The effort was concentrated in the Bas-Uele District, especially in the settlements of Bili and Monga.Eidberg (1976): 113 The network was gradually expanded and by the 1970s there were additional missionary stations in Bondo, Butu, Likati and Ndu.Eidberg (1976): 114 By 1945 the Congo mission had baptized 3,000 converts.Eidberg (1976): 117 The Baptist Women's Association of Norway was founded in 1916 to coordinate women's work between the congregations. This included both evangelism and missions, as well as annual seminars. The Baptist Youth Association was founded in 1922 to coordinate the activities of the youth associations in each congregation.Eidberg (1976): 40 From 1921 the local congregation operated a fishermen's home in Honningsv√•g. Another attempt to spread the word in Northern Norway took place through the \\"skerries mission\\". Boats were used to reach coastal hamlets without regular church services. Otta The organization saw its membership hit a plateau during the 1900s, but then saw significant growth again during the 1910s. Membership numbers grew again during the 1930s and hit an all-time high of 7,500 members in the late 1940s. By then the Pentecostalism was increasing in Norway. Many Baptists changed to Pentecostal congregations and locally there was often striving for the same crowd. Similarities in theological stances, especially regarding baptism and congregationalism, often eased transition between congregations.Eidberg (1976): 42 Along with the Baptist Union of Denmark and the Baptist Union of Sweden, the Norwegian union established a congregation in San Francisco, the Scandinavian Seamen Mission in 1946. Two Norwegians have been secretary- general of the Baptist World Alliance. The first was Arnold T. √òhrn from 1948 to 1960, and his successor Josef Nordenhang from 1960 to 1969. The Baptist Folk High School was inaugurated in 1958. It changed its name to Holtekilen Folk High School in 1979.Liland & Iversen (2010): 43 √Öse Baptist Church in Andenes Many of the smallest congregations had problems funding both a church and the pastor's wages. In some congregations this was solved by only hiring the pastor part-time, or having them funded through their spouse working. In any case wages were comparatively low for the education. From the 1960s a \\"wage fund\\" was created, whereby larger congregations subsidized the wages of pastors in smaller congregations.Eidberg (1976): 62 The Baptist Study Council was established in 1972 to publish study circles. This agency remained until 2010.

It was accredited as a college and was situated at the Baptist complex at Stabekk.Liland & Iversen (2010): 97 Organization Interior of Trondheim Baptist Church The union has 97 congregations. Membership is tied to the individual congregations rather than to the union. Based on a form of weak congregationalism, these are autonomous organizations which elect their own leadership. The union therefore acts as a coordinating organization. The congregations are organized into five regional districts, each with their own board. The union has an annual meeting with delegates from each congregation. This body holds the supreme authorities within the union. It appoints the main board, other committees and various issues regarding economy, institutions and plans. The head office is situated at Stabekk in B√¶rum outside Oslo. The union has an administration with seven employees, led by Secretary-General Terje Aadne. The Baptist Union of Norway is a member of the Baptist World Alliance, the European Baptist Federation and the Christian Council of Norway. Membership Statistics Norway counted 10,283 members of the Baptist Union of Norway in 2014. This is based on the official reported numbers of adherents to the state for state grants. This number includes children and non-baptized adherents. In 2016, it had 98 churches and 6,424 members.Baptist World Alliance, Statistics, bwanet.org, USA, retrieved December 14, 2019 Institutions Holtekilen Folk High School in B√¶rum is owned by the union The Norwegian School of Leadership and Theology is an accredited college jointly owned by the Baptist Union and Filadelphia Church, Oslo, a Pentecostal congregation. Approved by the Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education, it offers a three-year bachelor's degree in leadership and theology, and a one-year course in Christianity. Although not a formal requirement, most pastors have taken a four-year theological education at the college.Eidberg (1976): 60 Holtekilen Folk High School is situated at Stabekk and has 85 pupils. It features six lines: music, fashion/design, travel, film/photography, street sociology and ethics/sustainability. The union publishes a monthly magazine, Baptist.no, which is distributed to all members of the congregations. The Norwegian Baptist-Historic Society is given the task of maintaining Baptist archives in Norway and publishing historical and theological presentations. Its main work is the semi-annual magazine Baptist which provides articles on Baptist history, theology and practice. It also publishes literature.

It is one of three public colleges in the Nebraska State College System. It has open admission and an acceptance rate of 100%. It has a four-year graduation rate of 19%, which is well-below the national average. The school opened in June 1911, although a previous institution dated from the late 19th century. The college has an enrollment of about 3,000 students. Five of its 25 major buildings are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.  History  Chadron State College was founded in 1909 by the Nebraska Legislature to provide a higher education institution in northwest Nebraska. The Board of Education of State Normal Schools selected Chadron as the location of its fourth institution in January, 1910. The school opened in June, 1911. Chadron State College is the only four-year and graduate-degree granting college in western Nebraska, and is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and subject- oriented accrediting agencies. = Presidents = # Joseph Sparks (1911‚Äì1916) # Robert I.

Rhine (2012‚Äìpresent) = 2006 Spotted Tail wildfire = In late July 2006, the college was in danger of damage from a wildfire. The Spotted Tail fire was caused by a lightning strike on July 26 about seven miles (11 km) south of Chadron. By July 28, the wildfire reached the edge of Chadron and the college campus. Fire crews prevented the wildfire from reaching the campus. The Pine Ridge escarpment south of the college, including C-Hill, was deforested as a result of the fire.  Facilities  Adelaide Miller Hall The campus has 25 major buildings, five of which are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Their replacement value is more than $60 million and they provide more than 1 million square feet (92,900 square meters) of floor space. Classrooms and laboratory and research facilities are available in seven classroom buildings and the library. The library contains the equivalent of more than 250,000 volumes. Its automated catalogue is part of the Nebraska State College network. Since the 1980s, the college has built several new facilities, including the Edwin and Avis Nelson Physical Activity Center, a wood-fired heating plant, the Student Center, the Lindeken-Carillon Clock Tower, a softball field, the Chicoine Center athletic facility, the Eagle Ridge housing complex, and the Rangeland Complex. An outdoor track is under construction as of 2020. Multiple buildings have been renovated since 2004, including Joseph Sparks Hall, which houses administrative and alumni offices; Edna Work Hall, a dormitory; the former Administration Building, now called Old Admin, which houses academic programs and classrooms; and Don Beebe Stadium, including the rebuilt Con Marshall Press Box and Elliott Field.

It has streaked greyish-brown upperparts and buff underparts, and is similar in appearance to other European pipits. There are three subspecies, of which only the Fennoscandian form is migratory, wintering in shoreline habitats further south in Europe. The Eurasian rock pipit is territorial at least in the breeding season, and year-round where it is resident. Males will sometimes enter an adjacent territory to assist the resident in repelling an intruder, behaviour only otherwise known from the African fiddler crab. Eurasian rock pipits construct a cup nest under coastal vegetation or in cliff crevices and lay four to six speckled pale grey eggs which hatch in about two weeks with a further 16 days to fledging. Although insects are occasionally caught in flight, the pipits feed mainly on small invertebrates picked off the rocks or from shallow water. The Eurasian rock pipit may be hunted by birds of prey, infested by parasites such as fleas, or act as an involuntary host to the common cuckoo, but overall its population is large and stable, and it is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Taxonomy and systematics The family Motacillidae consists of the wagtails, pipits and longclaws. The largest of these groups is the pipits in the genus Anthus, which are typically brown- plumaged terrestrial insectivores. Their similar appearances have led to taxonomic problems; the water pipit and the buff-bellied pipit were considered subspecies of the Eurasian rock pipit until they were separated by the British Ornithologists' Union in 1998. The Eurasian rock pipit is closely related to the meadow, red-throated and rosy pipits as well as its former subspecies. The first formal description naming this species was by English naturalist George Montagu in 1798. It had previously been described in 1766 by Thomas Pennant, in the first edition of British Zoology, although he did not distinguish it from the common titlark (meadow pipit). It was first shown to be different from that species by John Walcott in the 1789 edition of his Synopsis of British Birds, in which he called it the sea lark. John Latham was the first to give the Eurasian rock pipit a scientific name, Alauda obscura in 1790, but the specimen he examined had been misidentified as to the species and was in fact a dusky lark. In the same year, Montagu, whom Latham had consulted about the bird, discovered the Eurasian rock pipit on the coast of South Wales, where it was known to some fishermen in the region as the \\"rock lark\\". He adopted that name for the species and gave it the scientific name Alauda petrosus. The scientific name of the Eurasian rock pipit is from Latin. Anthus is the name given by Pliny the Elder to a small bird of grasslands, and the specific petrosus means \\"rocky\\", from petrus, \\"rock\\". There are three recognised subspecies of the Eurasian rock pipit: *Anthus petrosus petrosus (Montagu, 1798) ‚Äì the nominate subspecies, breeds in Ireland, Great Britain, northwest France and the Channel Islands *Anthus petrosus kleinschmidti (Hartert, 1905) ‚Äì breeds on the Faroe Islands, Shetland, Orkney, Fair Isle and St. Kilda *Anthus petrosus littoralis Brehm, 1823 ‚Äì breeds in Fennoscandia and northwestern Russia and winters on the west coast of Europe south to northwest Africa. A. p. kleinschmidti is sometimes merged with the nominate form, A. p. petrosus. The suggested subspecies A. p. meinertzhageni on South Uist, A. p. hesperianus on the Isle of Arran, and A. p. ponens in northwestern France cannot be reliably separated from the nominate form. There is a geographical trend in appearance, with longer-billed, darker birds at the western end of the range, and shorter-billed, paler individuals in the east. Description 1907 illustration by Henrik Gr√∂nvold The Eurasian rock pipit is long and weighs . The nominate race has smoky-olive upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and buff underparts, heavily marked with poorly defined brown streaks. The legs, bill and iris are dark brown or blackish, and there is a pale eye-ring. The sexes are alike; although males average slightly brighter than females, the overlap is complete and birds cannot be sexed on appearance or measurements. Immature birds resemble the adult, although they may sometimes be browner and more streaked above, looking superficially similar to meadow pipits. Compared to the nominate form, A. p. kleinschmidti has slightly yellower, less olive, upperparts and brighter and yellower underparts between the breast streaking. A. p. littoralis may show pinkish underparts and a pale supercilium (eyebrow) in summer, thereby resembling the water pipit. Vagrant Eurasian rock pipits in winter are readily distinguishable from water pipits, but very difficult to assign to subspecies by appearance or measurements. The western populations are known to be nearly sedentary, so east of the Elbe basin vagrant Eurasian rock pipits are presumably mostly littoralis. Adult Eurasian rock pipits have a complete moult in August‚ÄìSeptember, at which time juveniles replace their body and some wing covert feathers, giving them an appearance very like the adults. From late January to early March there is a partial moult and individually variable moult of some body and wing covert feathers, and sometimes the central tail feathers. The Eurasian rock pipit is closely related to the water pipit and the meadow pipit, and is rather similar in appearance. Compared to the meadow pipit, the Eurasian rock pipit is darker, larger and longer-winged than its relative, and has dark, rather than pinkish-red, legs. The water pipit in winter plumage is also confusable with the Eurasian rock pipit, but has a strong supercilium and greyer upperparts; it is also typically much warier. The Eurasian rock pipit's dusky, rather than white, outer tail feathers are also a distinction from all its relatives. The habitats used by Eurasian rock and water pipits are completely separate in the breeding season, and there is little overlap even when birds are not nesting. The Eurasian rock pipit's song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The shrill pseep flight call is intermediate between the soft sip sip sip of the meadow pipit and the water pipit's short, thin fist. Distribution and habitat Norwick, Shetland The Eurasian rock pipit is almost entirely coastal, frequenting rocky areas typically below , although on St Kilda it breeds at up to . The Eurasian rock pipit is not troubled by wind or rain, although it avoids very exposed situations. It may occur further inland in winter or on migration. The breeding range is temperate and Arctic Europe on western and Baltic Sea coasts, with a very small number sometimes nesting in Iceland. The nominate race is largely resident, with only limited movement. A. p. kleinschmidti, which nests on the Faroe Islands and the Scottish islands, may move to sandy beaches or inland to rivers and lakes in winter. A. p. littoralis is largely migratory, wintering on coasts from southern Scandinavia to southwest Europe, with a few reaching Morocco. Wanderers have reached Spitsbergen and the Canary Islands, but records in Europe away from the coast are rare. For example, a male shot at Dresden in 1894, now in the collection of the local State Museum of Zoology, is the sole specimen for Saxony. Migratory populations leave their breeding grounds in September and October, returning from March onwards, although in the far north they may not arrive before May. Behaviour A. p. kleinschmidti on Su√∞uroy, Faroe Islands The Eurasian rock pipit is a much more approachable bird than the water pipit. If startled, it flies a fairly short distance, close to the ground, before it alights, whereas its relative is warier and flies some distance before landing again. Eurasian rock pipits are usually solitary, only occasionally forming small flocks. =Breeding= The Eurasian rock pipit is highly territorial in the breeding season, and throughout the year where it is resident. Breeding males have a song display in which they fly to above the ground, then circle or descend to the ground with a fluttering \\"parachute\\" flight. Territorial males will sometimes enter the territory of an adjacent male to cooperate in evicting an intruder. This behaviour, which requires the ability to distinguish the resident from the intruder, is only otherwise known from the African fiddler crab. Eggs are laid from early to mid-April in Britain and Ireland, from mid-May in southern Scandinavia, and from June in the north. The nest is always close to the shore, in a cliff crevice or hole, or under the cover of vegetation. It is constructed by the female from seaweed and dead grass, and lined with finer fibres or hair. The bird lays four to six speckled pale grey eggs which hatch in about two weeks The clutch is four to six eggs, glossy pale grey with darker grey or olive speckles mainly at the wider end. They measure and weigh , of which 5% is shell. They are incubated for 14‚Äì16 days to hatching, almost entirely by the female, although males have been recorded as occasionally helping. The naked altricial chicks are brooded by the female and fledge in about 16 days. Both parents may feed the chicks for several days after fledging. There may be two broods in a year in the south of the pipit's range, and just one further north. In a British survey, a hatching rate of 82% and a fledging rate of 78% gave an overall 58% nesting success, with an average 2.5 surviving young per pair. In contrast, a study in northwestern France found juvenile mortality was nearly 70%. The average lifespan is not recorded, although the maximum recorded age is 10.9 years. =Feeding= The Eurasian rock pipit's feeding habitat is rocky coasts, rather than the damp grassland favoured by the water pipit. The Eurasian rock pipit feeds mainly on invertebrates, seeking out most of its prey on foot, only occasionally flying to catch insects. It will venture into shallow water as it follows retreating waves, and may take advantage of human activity that exposes sea slaters or other species that hide under stones. Food items include snails, worms, small crustaceans, flies and beetles. The proportions of each prey species vary with season and locality. Amphipod larvae are important in Ireland and Scotland, crustaceans in Norway, and the mollusc Assiminea grayana in the Netherlands. Small fish are occasionally eaten, and in hard weather pipits may scavenge for other food, including human food litter. There is little competition from other species for food, since rocky beach specialists like the purple sandpiper take slightly larger food items, and may wade in deeper water. When food is abundant, meadow pipits may also feed on the shore, but are driven away by the Eurasian rock pipits when there is less prey available. Predators and parasites The Eurasian rock pipit is hunted by birds of prey including the Eurasian sparrowhawk. As with other members of its genus, it is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. Eggs laid by cuckoos that specialise in using pipits as their hosts are similar in appearance to those of the pipit. The Eurasian rock pipit is also a host to the flea Ceratophyllus borealis, and several other flea species in the genera Ceratophyllus and Dasypsyllus. The Eurasian rock pipit can benefit from parasitism of the common periwinkle Littorina littoria by the castrating trematode Parorchis acanthus. Beaches can become attractive where the decline of the periwinkle results in more ungrazed algae, with corresponding increases in invertebrates and a greater diversity of smaller Littorina snails as food for the pipits. Status Estimates of the breeding population of the Eurasian rock pipit vary, but may be as high as 408,000 pairs, of which around 300,000 pairs are in Norway. Despite slight declines in the British population and some range expansion in Finland, the population is considered overall to be large and stable, and for this reason it is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN. Breeding densities vary from 0.9‚Äì6 pairs/km (1.4‚Äì9.7 pairs/mi) of coast depending on the quality of the habitat. There are few threats, although oil spills can temporarily reduce the invertebrate population of affected rocky coasts.

It is a short-distance migrant; many birds move to lower altitudes or wet open lowlands in winter. The water pipit in breeding plumage has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and pale pink-buff underparts fading to whitish on the lower belly. The head is grey with a broad white supercilium (\\"eyebrow\\"), and the outer tail feathers are white. In winter, the head is grey-brown, the supercilium is duller, the upperparts are more streaked, and the underparts are white, streaked lightly with brown on the breast and flanks. There are only minor differences among the three subspecies, the sexes are almost identical, and young birds resemble adults. The water pipit's song is delivered from a perch or in flight, and consists of four or five blocks, each consisting of about six repetitions of a different short note. Water pipits construct a cup-like nest on the ground under vegetation or in cliff crevices and lay four to six speckled grey-ish white eggs, which hatch in about two weeks with a further 14‚Äì15 days to fledging. Although pipits occasionally catch insects in flight, they feed mainly on small invertebrates picked off the ground or vegetation, and also some plant material. The water pipit may be hunted by birds of prey, infested by parasites such as fleas, or act as an involuntary host to the common cuckoo, but overall its population is large and stable, and it is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Taxonomy and systematics The family Motacillidae consists of the wagtails, pipits and longclaws. The largest of the three groups is the pipits, genus Anthus, which are typically brown-plumaged terrestrial insectivores. Their similar appearances have led to taxonomic problems; the water pipit and the buff-bellied pipit were both formerly considered subspecies of the Eurasian rock pipit. Of these, the rock pipit is the more closely related to the water pipit, based on external and molecular characteristics. Other near relatives are the meadow, red-throated and rosy pipits. The water pipit was first described by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae in 1758 as Alauda spinoletta (characterised as A. rectricibus fuscis : extimis duabus oblique dimidiato-albis). The current genus Anthus was created for the pipits by German naturalist Johann Matth√§us Bechstein in 1805. Anthus is the Latin name for a small bird of grasslands, and the specific spinoletta is a local dialect word for a pipit from the Florence area of Italy. Wintering Anthus spinoletta blakistoni at Tal Chhapar Sanctuary There are three recognised subspecies of the water pipit: * Anthus spinoletta spinoletta, (Linnaeus, 1758), the nominate subspecies, breeds in the mountains of southern Europe from the Pyrenees eastwards to northwestern Turkey, and on Sardinia and Corsica. * Anthus spinoletta coutellii, Audouin, 1828, breeds in the mountains of Turkey other than the northwest, the Caucasus, northern Iran and Turkmenistan. * Anthus spinoletta blakistoni, R. Swinhoe, 1863, breeds in mountains across Asia from southern Russia east to central China. A possible fourth race from the northwestern Caucasus, Anthus spinoletta caucasicus, cannot be reliably separated from A.s. coutellii. The latter form is itself a potential new species, based on genetic data, appearance and a characteristic flight call. Description The water pipit is long and weighs . The adult of the nominate race in spring plumage has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and pale pink- buff underparts fading to whitish on the lower belly. There may be some faint streaking on the breast and flanks. The head is grey with a broad white supercilium. The outer tail feathers are white, and the legs, bill and iris are dark brown or blackish. In non-breeding plumage, the head is grey-brown and the supercilium is less distinct. The upperparts are more streaked, and the underparts are white, marked lightly with brown on the breast and flanks. The sexes are similar although the female has, on average, a greyer head. Young birds resembles the non-breeding adult, but are browner and more streaked above with prominent streaking on the underparts. A. s. coutellii is smaller than the nominate subspecies and the white of the outer tail feathers has a hint of grey. It is paler and more heavily streaked above, and in summer plumage the underparts' colour covers a larger area and has a rusty tint. A. s. blakistoni is large, pale and less strongly streaked. Conspicuous head markings The water pipit has a complete moult between July and September, although there is considerable individual variation in timing. There is a partial pre-breeding moult, mainly between January and March, but with much variability in timing. This moult typically involves replacing the head, body and some wing feathers, but the extent is again variable. Very occasionally, females may moult into what looks like non-breeding plumage, rather than the expected brighter garb. The chicks start to gain juvenile plumage as soon as a month after hatching, and most have completed the transition to near-adult appearance by September. The first pre-breeding moult is similar to that of the adult, but may be less complete or even absent. The water pipit is closely related to the Eurasian rock pipit and the meadow pipit, and is rather similar to both in appearance. Compared to the meadow pipit, the water pipit is longer-winged and longer-tailed than its relative, and has much paler underparts. It has dark, rather than pinkish-red, legs. The water pipit in winter plumage is also confusable with the Eurasian rock pipit, but has a strong supercilium, greyer upperparts, and white, not grey, outer tail feathers; it is also typically much warier. The habitats used by Eurasian rock and water pipits are completely separate in the breeding season, and there is little overlap even when birds are not nesting. There is also little mixing with breeding meadow pipits, although since 1960 some overlapping territories have been found where the species coexist. The Eurasian rock pipit's subspecies Anthus petrosus littoralis in summer plumage is particularly close in outward appearance to the water pipit. The rock pipit normally has a bluer tint to the head, streaking on the breast and flanks, and buff outer tail feathers, and the songs are also different. The species mostly occupy different habitat types even when they occur in the same general area. =Voice= The water pipit's song is delivered from a perch or in flight, and consists of four or five blocks, each consisting of about half a dozen repetitions of a different short note. In comparison, the Eurasian rock pipit's song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The call of the water pipit is a single or double sharp \\"dzip\\" or similar, slightly harsher than soft sip sip sip of the meadow pipit or the shrill pseep of the Eurasian rock pipit. The short, thin fist flight call is intermediate between the sip of the meadow pipit and the rock pipit's feest. The differences between the calls of the pipit species are very subtle, and not diagnostic in the absence of other evidence. The flight call of the subspecies A. s. coutellii is shorter and more buzzing than that of the nominate race. Distribution and habitat In typical breeding habitat The breeding range of the water pipit is the mountains of southern Europe and Asia from Spain to central China, along with the Mediterranean islands of Sardinia and Corsica. The water pipit is predominantly a mountain species in the breeding season, found in alpine pasture and high meadows with short grass and some bushes or rocks. It is typically found close to wetter areas and often on slopes. It breeds between altitude, mostly . It migrates relatively short distances in autumn to lower ground, typically wintering on coastal wetlands, marshes, rice fields and similar habitats. Although most birds move to lowlands, some may remain at up to . Nominate A. s. spinoletta winters mainly in western and southern Europe and in northwestern Africa; in western Europe some birds show fidelity to the same wintering site, returning each year. Birds in Spain appear to move only lower down the mountains in which they breed. A.s. coutellii winters at lower altitudes near its breeding areas and also in the Arabian Peninsula and northeast Africa. A.s. blakistoni winters in Pakistan, northwest India and southern China. Water pipits leave their breeding sites from mid-September, although the eastern subspecies may start moving south before then. The spring migration starts in February and March, with arrival on the breeding grounds in April and May. The water pipit has been recorded as a vagrant in Belarus, Gibraltar and Latvia, and on islands including the Canaries, Iceland, Malta and Svalbard. Behaviour The water pipit is a much less approachable bird as compared to the Eurasian rock pipit. It is warier than its relative and if approached it flies some distance before landing again, whereas the rock pipit typically travels only a short distance, close to the ground, before it alights. =Breeding= Egg in Museum Wiesbaden The water pipit is mainly monogamous, although both sexes may deviate from this occasionally. The male has a display flight in which he climbs to , flies in an arc and glides back down, singing throughout. The female constructs a cup nest from grass and leaves which is lined with finer plant material and animal hairs. The nest is hidden in vegetation on the ground, sometimes in a hollow. The normal clutch is four to six eggs laid from the end of April to early July. Eggs are greyish white with darker grey or brownish speckles mainly at the wider end, and they measure and weigh of which 5% is shell. The eggs are incubated by the female for 14‚Äì15 days to hatching. Chicks are fed initially by the male, both parents sharing the duty after a few days when the female does not need to brood so often, and they fledge in a further 14‚Äì15 days. There may be two broods in a year. In a Swiss study of the nominate subspecies, 76% of eggs hatched, and 58% of chicks fledged. Birds of the race A. s. blakistoni in the Tian Shan hatched 90% of their eggs, and hatchlings survived to fledging in 47% of the nests. In the latter study, early nests were more likely to fail because less plant cover made them more likely to be found by predators. Neither the average lifespan nor the maximum age of survival are known. =Feeding= Glacier fleas are a prey item found on snow fields The water pipit's feeding habitat is damp grassland, rather than the rocky coasts favoured by the Eurasian rock pipit. The water pipit feeds mainly on a wide range of invertebrates, including crickets and grasshoppers, beetles, snails, millipedes and spiders. Barkflies, true flies, caterpillars and homopterans can form a large part of the diet of fledglings. Birds close to snow fields take insects specialised for that habitat such as the springtails Isotoma saltans (the glacier flea) and I. nivalis, and the scorpion fly Boreus izyemalis. Birds normally forage alone or in pairs; in bad weather, foraging is more frequent and involves longer flights, and may be concentrated around marmot burrow entrances. Prey items average in length and are mainly hunted on foot, although flying insects are occasionally caught in the air. Some plant material is taken, and one study on the border of Czechoslovakia and Poland found that 75% of the diet by volume consisted of algae, specifically Ulothrix zonata, despite large numbers of insects being available. In areas with acidic soils, there is less calcium available, potentially leading to thinner egg shells. In such locations, pipits are more likely to select snails and similar prey with calcium-rich shells than is the case in limestone terrain. Predators and parasites The water pipit is hunted by birds of prey including the Eleonora's falcon, and eggs and young may be taken by terrestrial predators including stoats and snakes. As with other members of its genus, the water pipit is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. Eggs of cuckoos that specialise in parasitising pipits are similar in appearance to those of their hosts. A new species of feather mite, Proctophyllodes schwerinensis, was discovered on the water pipit, which is also a host to the fleas Ceratophyllus borealis and Dasypsyllus gallinulae. Along with other Motacillidae species, the water pipit is a host of the protozoan parasite Haemoproteus anthi. Status Estimates of the European breeding population of the water pipit vary widely, but may be as high as two million pairs, which would suggest a global population of tens of millions of individuals spread over . The range is discontinuous due to the mountain habitat this species uses, but the population is considered overall to be large and stable, and for this reason the water pipit is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN. Breeding densities (in pairs per ten ha) have been recorded as 2.4 in the Jura Mountains, 3.0‚Äì3.6 in the Alps and 4.5 in the Tatra Mountains of Poland.

The Baptist Union of Australia was inaugurated on August 24th, 1926 at the Burton Street Church in Sydney. Australian Baptist Ministries for the most part are theologically liberal when it comes to church leadership. History Baptist work in Australia began in Sydney in 1831, forty-three years after the British penal colony was established. William H. Brackney, Historical Dictionary of the Baptists, Editions Scarecrow Press, Canada, 2009, p. 40 The first preacher was John McKaeg, who conducted the first Baptist service on Sunday April 24 in The Rose and Crown Inn on the corner of Castlereagh and King Streets. The first baptism, of two female congregants, was conducted by McKaeg in Woolloomooloo Bay on 12 August 1832. It was not until 1835 that the first church was established in Hobart Town by Henry Dowling, a strict Calvinist. John Saunders, who had been sent by the Baptist Missionary Society of England to Sydney in 1834, raised the funding to erect a second church which was opened on 23 September 1836. The first state Union was formed in Victoria in 1862. The national Baptist Union was founded in 1926 by representatives from existing state unions. Robert E.
