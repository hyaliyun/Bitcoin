Produced on a low budget for Columbia Pictures, it has been classed as an exploitation film and \\"sex hygiene film\\" because it touches on teenage pregnancy and morality in a didactic manner.Schaefer, Eric. Bold! Daring! Shocking! True!: A History of Exploitation Films, 1919-1959. Durham & London: Duke University Press. 384 The film features a teenaged Betty Grable in an early film role. Plot Dr. Dan Davidge, a kindly, old family doctor, travels from house to house, observing the children he has brought into the world as they grow into adults. His favorite is seventeen-year-old Ruth Harper, a pretty, lively youngster who is far more innocent than her \\"flapper\\" friends. Davidge asks Ruth's father John if the girl has been informed about the facts of life, and the disconcerted father fatefully defers to his repressed and judgmental wife, Amy. Believing her own example of quiet and respectable life is sufficient, Amy refuses to discuss sex with her daughter. Ruth is deeply in love with Tommy Harrow, a carefree boy several years older than she, and she becomes confused by the pressure he puts on her and her feelings toward him. Despite the doctor's urging, Amy still refuses to address Ruth's questions and concerns. One evening after a wild party, Tommy persuades Ruth to accompany him home. Time passes as Ruth, who is now even more in love with Tommy, grows upset by his coolness toward her after their intimate night. She goes to Davidge, who quickly realizes that her \\"little attack of anemia\\" is what it seems‚Äîpregnancy. Davidge confronts Tommy, who callously refuses to accept his responsibilities, then informs John and Amy about Ruth's pregnancy. The bewildered John attempts to offer sympathy, but Amy, furious over the potential scandal, castigates Ruth. The distraught girl is sent to a country resort, where, overwhelmed by the rejection she has experienced from Tommy and her mother, she drowns herself.

The area now known as Oakland had seen human occupation for thousands of years, but significant growth in the settlements that are now incorporated into the city did not occur until the Industrial Revolution. Oakland was first incorporated as a town in 1852.Oakland's Famous Tree in OG Plaza The Ohlone Period Ohlone People 162x162px The earliest known inhabitants were the Huchiun tribe, who have lived there since time immemorial. The Huchiun belong to a linguistic grouping later called the Ohlone (a Miwok word meaning \\"western people\\"). In Oakland, they were concentrated around Lake Merritt and Temescal Creek, a stream that enters the San Francisco Bay at Emeryville. Spanish and Mexican Period Map of Rancho San Antonio during Spanish and Mexican Period Conquistadors from New Spain claimed Oakland, and other Ohlone lands of the East Bay, along with the rest of California, for the king of Spain in 1772. In the early 19th century, the Spanish crown deeded the East Bay area to Luis Mar√≠a Peralta for his Rancho San Antonio. The grant was confirmed by the successor Mexican republic upon its independence from Spain. Upon his death in 1842, Peralta divided his land among his four sons. Most of Oakland fell within the shares given to Antonio Maria and Vicente. left The Peralta ranch included a stand of oak trees that stretched from the land that is today Oakland's downtown area to the adjacent part of Alameda, then a peninsula. The Peraltas called the area encinal, a Spanish word that means \\"oak grove.\\" This was translated more loosely as \\"Oakland\\" in the subsequent naming of the town, as recounted by Horace Carpentier in his first address as mayor: \\"The chief ornament and attraction of this city consists, doubtless, in the magnificent grove of evergreen oaks which covers its present site and from which it takes both its former name of 'Encinal' and its present one of 'Oakland.'\\" The trees were California live oaks which are the dominant overstory plant of the coast live oak woodland habitat.Depiction of Oakland in 1900. American Acquisition Period As part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo following the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the Mexican government ceded ; 55% of its pre-war territory (excluding Texas) to the US in exchange for $15 million. The Treaty also provided for the safeguarding of the land and property of Mexican citizens. This provision was regularly ignored by squatters and land speculators, some of whom began settling on the Peralta Ranch, particularly during the Gold Rush. Before Congress created a Land Commission in 1851 to pursue a settlement of property claims, a group of three men‚ÄîHorace Carpentier, Edson Adams, and Andrew Moon‚Äîbacked at one point by a small army of some 200 men hired from San Francisco, began developing a small settlement on Peralta land initially called \\"Contra Costa\\" (\\"opposite shore\\", the Spanish name for the lands on the east side of the Bay) in the area that is now downtown Oakland. The United States Post Office recognized this by establishing a post office there with the name \\"Contra Costa\\".[\\"Chronology of County's Post Offices\\", Contra Costa Gazette, November 28, 1958] Carpentier was elected to the California state legislature and got the Town of Oakland incorporated on May 4, 1852. By the time the Land Commission got around to confirming the Peraltas' claims in 1854, Oakland was quickly being further developed. The Peraltas in the meantime had been persuaded to sell various parcels of their vast holdings. In 1853, John Coffee \\"Jack\\" Hays, a famous Texas Ranger, was one of the first to establish residence in Oakland while performing his duties as sheriff of San Francisco. Early American Period On March 25, 1854, Oakland was re-incorporated as the City of Oakland. Horace Carpentier was elected the first mayor. His tenure did not last, however. He was ousted in 1855 by an angry citizenry when it was discovered that he had acquired exclusive rights to the waterfront from the Town Board of Trustees in 1852. Charles Campbell replaced him as Mayor on March 5, 1855. City Hall Square The city and its environs quickly grew with the railroads, becoming a major rail terminal in the late 1860s and 1870s. In 1868, the Central Pacific constructed the Oakland Long Wharf at Oakland Point, the site of today's Port of Oakland. The Long Wharf served as the terminus both for the Transcontinental Railroad and for local commuter trains of the Central (later, Southern) Pacific. The Central Pacific also established one of its largest rail yards and servicing facilities in West Oakland, which continued to be a major local employer under the Southern Pacific well into the 20th century. The principal depot of the Southern Pacific in Oakland was the 16th Street Station located at 16th and Wood, which is currently being restored as part of a redevelopment project. In 1871, Cyrus and Susan Mills paid $5,000 for the Young Ladies' Seminary in Benicia, renamed it Mills College, and moved it to its current location in Oakland, adjacent to what is now Seminary Boulevard. In 1872, the town of Brooklyn was incorporated into Oakland. Brooklyn, a large municipality southeast of Lake Merritt, was part of what was then called the Brooklyn Township. A number of horsecar and cable car lines were constructed in Oakland during the latter half of the 19th century. The first electric streetcar set out from Oakland to Berkeley in 1891, and other lines were converted and added over the course of the 1890s. The various streetcar companies operating in Oakland were acquired by Francis \\"Borax\\" Smith and consolidated into what eventually became known as the Key System, the predecessor of today's publicly owned AC Transit. In addition to its system of streetcars in the East Bay, the Key System also operated commuter trains to its own pier and ferry boats to San Francisco, in competition with the Southern Pacific. Upon completion of the Bay Bridge, both companies ran their commuter trains on the south side of the lower deck, directly to San Francisco. The Key System in its earliest years was actually in part a real estate venture, with the transit part serving to help open up new tracts for buyers. The Key System's investors (incorporated as the \\"Realty Syndicate\\") also established two large hotels in Oakland, one of which survives as the Claremont Resort. The other, which burned down in the early 1930s, was the Key Route Inn, at what is now West Grand and Broadway. From 1904 to 1929, the Realty Syndicate also operated a major amusement park in north Oakland called Idora Park.

Kaiser Convention Center) The original extent of Oakland, upon its incorporation, lay south of today's major intersection of San Pablo Avenue, Broadway, and Fourteenth Street. The city gradually annexed farmlands and settlements to the east and the north. Oakland's rise to industrial prominence, and its subsequent need for a seaport, led to the digging of a shipping and tidal channel in 1902, which created an island of nearby town Alameda. In 1906, its population doubled with refugees made homeless after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. Concurrently, a strong City Beautiful movement, promoted by Mayor Frank Kanning Mott, was responsible for creating and preserving parks and monuments in Oakland, including major improvements to Lake Merritt and the construction of Oakland Civic Auditorium, which cost $1M in 1914. The Auditorium briefly served as an emergency ward and quarantine for some of the victims of the 1918 flu pandemic. The three waves of the pandemic killed more than 1,400, out of 216,000, Oakland residents. Map of Oakland area in 1917 By 1920, Oakland was the home of numerous manufacturing industries, including metals, canneries, bakeries, internal combustion engines, automobiles, and shipbuilding. 1920s Tribune Tower was completed; in 1976, it was restored and declared an Oakland landmark. The 1920s were economic boom years in the United States as a whole, and in California in particular. Economic growth was fueled by the general post‚ÄìWorld War I recovery, as well as oil discoveries in Los Angeles and, most notably, the widespread introduction of the automobile. In 1916, General Motors opened a major Chevrolet automobile factory in East Oakland, making cars and then trucks until 1963, when it was moved to Fremont in southern Alameda County. Also in 1916, the Fageol Motor Company chose East Oakland for their first factory, manufacturing farming tractors from 1918 to 1923. In 1921, they introduced an influential low-slung \\"Safety Bus\\", followed quickly by the 22-seat \\"Safety Coach.\\" Durant Motors operated a plant in Oakland from 1921 to 1930, manufacturing sedans, coupes, convertibles, and roadsters. By 1929, when Chrysler expanded with a new plant there, Oakland had become known as the \\"Detroit of the West.\\" Dr. William M. Watts, photo from mid-1920s Oakland expanded during the 1920s, flexing enough to meet the influx of factory workers. Approximately 13,000 homes were built between 1921 and 1924, more than between 1907 and 1920.Prentice, Helaine Kaplan, Rehab Right, Ten-Speed Press. Many of the large downtown office buildings, apartment buildings, and single-family houses still standing in Oakland were built during the 1920s; and they reflect the architectural styles of the time. In 1926 Dr. William M. Watts (pictured left) opened a 22-bed hospital facility to provide in-patient care to Oakland's citizens of African descent who were not welcome at other health care institutions. The facility also offered training for African-American nurses. The Rocky Road ice cream was created in Oakland in 1929, though accounts differ about its first promoter. William Dreyer of Dreyer's is said to have carried the idea of marshmallow and walnut pieces in a chocolate base over from his partner Joseph Edy's similar candy creation. =Aviation firsts= The first experimental transcontinental airmail through flight lands in Oakland. Left to right: Mayor John L. Davie, unknown, Eddie Rickenbacker, John M. Larsen (aircraft salesman), partially obscured unknown man, Bert Acosta (in cavalry boots), J. J. Rosborough (postmaster), unknown. Russell Clifford Durant (called \\"Cliff\\" by his friends) was a race car driver, speedboat enthusiast, amateur flier, President of Durant Motors in Oakland, and son of General Motors founder William \\"Billy\\" Crapo Durant. In 1916, he established Durant Field at 82nd Avenue and East 14th Street. The first experimental transcontinental airmail through-flight finished its journey at Durant Field on August 9, 1920, with Army Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker and Navy Lt. Bert Acosta (pictured right) at the controls of the Junkers F 13 re-badged as the model J.L.6. The airfield served only secondary duties after 1927, as its runway was not long enough for heavily loaded aircraft. In April 1930, test pilot Herbert \\"Hub\\" Fahy and his wife Claire hit a stump upon landing, flipping their plane and mortally wounding Hub without injuring Claire. Durant Field was often called Oakland Airport, though the current Oakland International Airport was soon established four miles () southwest.Western Aerospace Museum. Oakland Airport Timeline. On September 17, 1927, Charles Lindbergh attended the official dedication of the new Oakland Airport. A month earlier, on August 16, participants in the disastrous Dole Air Race had taken off from Oakland's new runway headed for Honolulu, Hawaii away‚Äîthree fliers died before getting to the starting line in Oakland; five were lost at sea, attempting to reach Honolulu; and two more died searching for the lost five. On May 31, 1928, Charles Kingsford Smith and his crew departed Oakland in Southern Cross on their successful bid to cross the Pacific by air, finishing in Australia. In October 1928, Oakland was used as a base for the World War I aircraft involved in the final filming of Howard Hughes' Hell's Angels.History Department at the University of San Diego. Film notes. Hell's Angels In 1928, aviator Louise Thaden took off from Oakland in a Travel Air to set a women's altitude record, as well as endurance and speed records. On January 11, 1935, Amelia Earhart became the first person to fly solo from Honolulu, Hawaii to Oakland, California. On St. Patrick's Day, March 17, 1937, Earhart and her crew, Paul Mantz, Harry Manning and Fred Noonan, flew the first leg of her attempt to circumnavigate the globe, from Oakland to Honolulu, Hawaii. That attempt ended in Hawaii when her Lockheed Electra 10E was severely damaged. Later in the year, Earhart began her second, ill-fated attempt with the unpublicized first leg of her proposed transcontinental flight mapped from Oakland to Miami, Florida. World War II During World War II, the East Bay was home to many war-related industries. Among these were the Kaiser Shipyards in nearby Richmond. The medical system devised for shipyard workers became the basis for the giant Kaiser Permanente HMO, which has a large medical center at MacArthur and Broadway, the first to be established by Kaiser. Oakland's Moore Dry Dock Company expanded its shipbuilding capabilities and built over 100 ships. Valued at $100 million in 1943, Oakland's canning industry was its second-most-valuable war contribution after shipbuilding. Sited at both a major rail terminus and an important sea port, Oakland was a natural location for food processing plants, whose preserved products fed domestic, foreign, and military consumers. The largest canneries were in the Fruitvale District and included the Josiah Lusk Canning Company, the Oakland Preserving Company (which started the Del Monte brand), and the California Packing Company. A crowd of young people at the concert of the Benny Goodman Band at a local dance hall. April 1940 Prior to World War II, black Americans constituted about 3% of Oakland's population. The war attracted tens of thousands of laborers from around the country, and thousands of black people were part of the Second Great Migration to the city from Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas‚Äîsharecroppers and tenant farmers who had been recruited by Henry J. Kaiser to work in his shipyards. The influx of black and white shipyard workers from the deep South brought Jim Crow attitudes to a part of the country that largely had been free of segregationist sentiment.Arroyo, Cuahut√©moc (Faculty Mentor: Professor Leon F. Litwack). \\"Jim Crow\\" Shipyards: Black Labor and Race Relations in East Bay Shipyards During World War II. The Berkeley McNair Journal, The UC Berkeley McNair Scholars Program. Accessed from Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia at Ferris State University on August 19, 2007 In addition, black people further suffered from federally enforced redlining which designated Fruitvale and other Oakland neighborhoods as unfavorable. For instance, a 1937 Home Owners' Loan Corporation map of the area indicated these so-called detrimental influences: \\"Odors from industries. Predominance of foreign inhabitants. Infiltration of Negroes and Orientals.\\" Many Mexican Americans from states like New Mexico, Texas, and Colorado came to Oakland to work in the many wartime jobs as did many Mexican nationals who came under the Bracero Program. Many worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad, at its major rail yard in West Oakland (see traquero). While some of the rail workers lived near the yard, most of the Mexican community was concentrated as it always had been since the early days of the Peralta ranch in the Fruitvale District. Oakland experienced its own \\"zoot suit riots\\" in downtown Oakland in 1943 in the wake of the one in Los Angeles.Eye from the Edge A Memoir of West Oakland, California Ruben LLmas The Mai Tai cocktail was first concocted in Oakland in 1944, and it became very popular at Trader Vic's restaurant. Established in 1932, just four years later, Trader Vic's was so successful San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen was inspired to write, \\"the best restaurant in San Francisco is in Oakland.\\" Trader Vic's was chosen by the State Department as the official entertainment center for foreign dignitaries attending United Nations meetings in San Francisco. The restaurant continued to grow in popularity and was running out of room when, in 1951, founder Victor Bergeron opened a larger one in San Francisco. In 1972, the flagship Oakland restaurant moved to the nearby Emeryville Marina. Post-WWII (1940s and 1950s) View of Lake Merritt looking southwest from the northeastern tip of the lake In 1946 National City Lines (NCL), a General Motors holding company, acquired 64% of Key System stock; during the next several years NCL engaged in the conspiratorial dissolution of Oakland's electric streetcar system. NCL converted the Key System's electric streetcar fleet to diesel buses, tracks were removed from Oakland's streets, and the lower deck of the Bay Bridge was converted to automobile traffic, which reduced the passenger- carrying capacity of the bridge. Freeways were constructed, which partitioned the social and retail fabric of neighborhoods. In the 1948 federal case \\"United States v. National City Lines Inc.,\\" the defendants were found guilty on a count of conspiring to monopolize the provision of parts and supplies to their subsidiary companies. The companies were each fined $5,000, and the directors were each fined one dollar. The verdicts were upheld on appeal in 1951. The state Legislature created the Alameda and Contra Costa Transit District in 1955, which still exists today as AC Transit, the third-largest bus-only transit system in the nation. Soon after the war, with the disappearance of Oakland's shipbuilding industry and the decline of its automobile industry, jobs became scarce. Many of the city's more affluent residents, both black and white, left the city after the war, moving to neighboring Alameda, Berkeley, Albany and El Cerrito to the north; to San Leandro, Hayward, Castro Valley and Fremont in Southern Alameda County; and to the newly developing East Bay suburbs in Contra Costa County, Orinda, Lafayette, Pleasant Hill, Walnut Creek and Concord. Between 1950 and 1960, about 100,000 white property owners moved out of Oakland‚Äîpart of a nationwide phenomenon called white flight.Inside the Panther Revolution, Robyn Cean Spencer, Chapter 13, p. 302 By the end of World War II, black Americans constituted about 12% of Oakland's population, and the years following the war saw this percentage rise. There was also an increase in racial tension. Starting in the late 1940s, the Oakland Police Department began recruiting white officers from the South to deal with the expanding black population and changing racial attitudes; many were openly racist, and their repressive police tactics exacerbated racial tensions.Inside the Panther Revolution, Robyn Cean Spencer, Chapter 13, p. 303, \\"...Much of the city's police force had been recruited from the Deep South, and police officers frequently held racist attitudes.\\" Oakland was the center of a general strike during the first week of December 1946, one of six cities across the country that experienced such a strike after World War II. It was one of the largest strike movements in American history, as workers were determined not to let management repeat the union busting that followed World War I. Oakland, which had experienced some relative racial harmony prior to the war, found itself by the late 1950s with a population that was becoming progressively more poor and racially divided. Beginning in the mid-1950s, much of West Oakland was destroyed, after then-Highway 17, now I-880 (or Nimitz Freeway) was built. Many homes and businesses were destroyed to build the Cypress Viaduct and the rest of the Nimitz Freeway. Also urban renewal caused the destruction of the area around Market and 7th streets to make way for the Acorn High Rise apartments. This urban renewal of West Oakland continued into the 1960s with the construction of BART and the Main Post Office Building at 1675 7th Street. Many families were displaced from West Oakland by the construction of the Nimitz Freeway and the urban renewal of West Oakland. The majority of these were African-American and Latino. African Americans relocated to East Oakland as well especially the Elmhurst district and surrounding areas.American Babylon: Race and the Struggle for Postwar Oakland Robert Self 1960s and 1970s In 1960, Kaiser Corporation erected its headquarters at the former site of Holy Names University, at the corner of 20th and Harrison Streets. It was the largest skyscraper in Oakland, as well as \\"the largest office tower west of Chicago\\" up to that time. During this era, the oldest section of Oakland at the foot of Broadway, Jack London Square, was redeveloped into a hotel and outdoor retail district. During the 1960s, the city was home to an innovative funk music scene that produced well-known bands like Sly and the Family Stone, Graham Central Station, Tower of Power, Cold Blood, Azteca, and The Headhunters. Larry Graham, the bass player for both Sly and the Family Stone and Graham Central Station, is credited with the creation of the influential slap and pop sound still widely used by bassists in many musical idioms today.Bass Player Magazine, Aug. 8, 2011. By 1966, only 16 of the city's 661 police officers were black. Tensions between the black community and the largely white police force were high, and police malfeasance against black people was common.monthlyreview.org The Black Panther Party was founded by students Huey Newton and Bobby Seale at Merritt College.Up Against the Wall, Curtis Austin, pp. 30‚Äì47 It was also during the 1960s that the Oakland chapter of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club began to grow into a formidable motorcycle gang and organized crime syndicate. The Hells Angels clubhouse is still located on Oakland's Foothill Boulevard. During the 1970s, Oakland began to experience serious problems with gang-controlled dealing of heroin and cocaine when drug kingpin Felix Mitchell created the nation's first large-scale operation of this kind. Both violent crime and property crime increased during this period, and Oakland's murder rate rose to twice that of San Francisco or New York City. In late 1973, the Symbionese Liberation Army assassinated Oakland's superintendent of schools, Dr. Marcus Foster, and badly wounded his deputy, Robert Blackburn. Two months later, two men were arrested and charged with the murder. Both received life sentences, though one was acquitted after an appeal and a retrial seven years later. In the late 1960s and early 1970s the Fruitvale District was part of the Chicano Movement. In 1968 the Oakland Police murdered a young Chicano named Charles (Pinky) De Baca on 35th Avenue in East Oakland. A group called Latinos United for Justice organized to combat police brutality after Mr. De Baca's murder. Chicano Radical militants like the Chicano Revolutionary Party and the Brown Berets also organized and began doing work in the Fruitvale District to protect the Chicano and Latino Community from police brutality and had a free breakfast program in the Fruitvale area with the help of the Black Panthers. On July 26, 1970, the Fruitvale District held the Chicano Moratorium against Chicanos going to fight in the Vietnam war. La Clinica de La Raza was also formed on Fruitvale Avenue in 1970, by Chicano students in order to have a free Clinic for the Chicano and Latino Community in East Oakland. La Raza Unida Party also had a chapter in Oakland. The Chicano movement was also part of Oakland's Radical History in the 60s and 70s.The Last Chicano: A Mexican American Experience Manuel Ruben DelgadoHomegirls in the Public Sphere Marie \\"Keta\\" Miranda 1980s and 1990s Starting in the Late 1960s and continuing into the early 1980s, the number of Latinos, mostly of Mexican origin, began to increase in Oakland, especially in the Fruitvale District. This district is one of the oldest in Oakland, growing up around the old Peralta estate (now a city park). It always had a concentration of Latino residents, businesses and institutions, and increased immigration, continuing into the 21st century, has added greater numbers in Fruitvale and throughout East Oakland. As in many other American cities during the 1980s, crack cocaine became a serious problem in Oakland. Drug dealing in general, and the dealing of crack cocaine in particular, resulted in elevated rates of violent crime, causing Oakland to consistently be listed as one of America's most crime-ridden cities. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Oakland's black plurality reached its peak at approximately 47% of the overall population. Oakland was the birthplace or home at one time of several rap acts, including MC Hammer, Digital Underground, Hieroglyphics (including Souls of Mischief and Del tha Funkee Homosapien), The Luniz, Tupac Shakur, and Too Short. Outside of the rap genre, artists such as the Pointer Sisters, En Vogue, Tony! Toni! Tone!, and Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day also emerged from Oakland (actually the members of Green Day hailed from suburban Pinole area). On May 24, 1990, a pipe bomb placed underneath traveling eco-activist Judi Bari's car seat exploded, tearing through her backside and nearly killing her. The bomb was placed directly under the driver's seat, not in the back seat or luggage area as it presumably would have been if Bari had transported it knowingly. Immediately after the 1990 car bombing, while Bari was in Oakland's Highland Hospital, she and a friend were arrested on suspicion of knowingly transporting the bomb. The Alameda County district attorney later dropped the case for lack of evidence, and in 2004 the FBI and the City of Oakland agreed to a $4 million settlement of a lawsuit brought by Bari's estate, and her friend, over their false arrest. On October 20, 1991, a massive firestorm (see 1991 Oakland firestorm) swept down from the Berkeley Hills above the Caldecott Tunnel. Twenty-five people were killed, and 150 people were injured, with nearly 4,000 homes destroyed. The economic losses have been estimated at $1.5 billion. The economic losses, in combination with injuries and loss of life, make this the worst urban firestorm in American history. Many of the original homes were rebuilt on a much larger scale.Catastrophe: The 100 Greatest Disasters of All Time, Stephen J. Spignesi, Citadel, 2004, pp 292‚Äì94 In late 1996, Oakland was the center of a controversy surrounding Ebonics (African American Vernacular English), an ethnolect the outgoing Oakland Unified School District board voted to recognize on December 18.The Notorious Ebonics Resolution of Oakland, California: Drake, Dan 1997Junk Science and the \\"Ebonics\\" Resolution: Is academia looking the other way?: Salvucci, Claudio R.‚ÄîEvolution Publishing, June 1997 This was later dropped. During the mid-1990s, Oakland experienced an improved economy compared to previous decades, with new downtown land development such as a $140 million state government center project, a $101 million city office building, and a 12-story office building for the University of California, Office of the President. The City Center redevelopment project was bought by Shorenstein Co., a San Francisco real estate firm. Office vacancies dropped to 11 percent from 16 percent in 1996. Officials at the Port of Oakland and Oakland International Airport, began multimillion-dollar expansion plans to keep pace with rival shipping ports and airports on the West Coast. =1989 Loma Prieta earthquake= On October 17, 1989, a 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck the Bay Area at 5:04 p.m. The rupture was related to the San Andreas fault system and effected all Bay Area counties with a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). Many structures in Oakland were badly damaged including the double-decker Cypress Street Viaduct in West Oakland that collapsed. The eastern span of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge also sustained damage and was closed to traffic for one month; the bridge reopened on November 18. Oakland became the home of the emerging nonprofit preparedness movement in the aftermath of the earthquake when local agencies formed CARD (Collaborating Agencies Responding to Disasters) to address the unmet emergency readiness needs of the nonprofit and faith sectors. 2000s downtown skyline and Lakeside Apartments District as seen from East 18th Street Pier After his 1999 inauguration, Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown continued his predecessor Elihu Harris' public policy of supporting downtown housing development in the area defined as the Central Business District in Oakland's 1998 General Plan. Since Brown's stated goal was to add 10,000 residents to downtown Oakland, it became known as the \\"10K\\" plan. It resulted in redevelopment projects in the Jack London District, where Brown purchased and later sold an industrial warehouse, which he used as a personal residence, and in the Lakeside Apartments District near Lake Merritt, where two infill projects were approved. The 10K plan touched the historic Old Oakland district, the Chinatown district, the Uptown district, and downtown. The 10K plan and other redevelopment projects were controversial due to potential rent increases and gentrification, which would displace lower-income residents from downtown Oakland into outlying neighborhoods and cities. Additional controversy over development proposals arose from the weakening of the Bay Area and national economy in 2000, 2001, 2007, and the credit crunch and the recession of 2008. These downturns resulted in lowered sales, rentals and occupancy of the new housing and slower growth and economic recovery than expected. The Oakland Athletics have long sought a site to build a new baseball stadium. A deal announced in 2006 to build a new park in Fremont, to be called Cisco Field was halted three years later as a result of opposition from businesses and local residents. Local efforts have been put forth by both fans and city politicians to retain the A's, including three potential locations near downtown and the Oakland waterfront. The South Bay city of San Jose showed continuing, strong interest in becoming the team's new home, and was the preferred destination for then majority team owner Lew Wolff but was blocked by the San Francisco Giants. Currently plans call for a 34,000 seat new stadium dubbed Oakland Ballpark at Howard Terminal (owned by the Port of Oakland) next to Jack London Square. Fox Oakland Theatre, August 2002 The Oakland Ballet, performing in the city since 1965, folded temporarily in 2006 due to financial problems and the closure of their performance facility, the Calvin Simmons Theater at the Kaiser Convention Center. The following year, founder Ronn Guidi announced the revival of the Ballet under new director Graham Lustig, and the program continues to perform at the Laney College Theater. In the early morning hours of January 1, 2009, unarmed civilian Oscar Grant was shot and killed by BART police officer Johannes Mehserle on a crowded platform at the Fruitvale BART Station in East Oakland. Officers had subdued and handcuffed an unarmed Grant in a prone position for allegedly resisting arrest, before Mehserle shot Grant in the back with his gun, which he claimed to have mistaken for his stun gun. In the ensuing week, demonstrations and riots took place in Downtown Oakland, with demonstrators citing police brutality and racial injustice as their motivation. Mehserle was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in July 2010, and sentenced to two years in prison. Both the verdict and sentencing set off further demonstrations in downtown Oakland, which included looting and destruction of property. In February 2009, the Fox Oakland Theatre reopened. The theatre had been closed for most of the previous 42 years, with few events held there. After a thorough restoration, seismic retrofit, and many other improvements following years of severe neglect (including a fire as recently as 2004), the historic landmark theater started drawing patrons from all over the Bay Area.Full text at first reference: On March 21, 2009, Oakland parolee Lovelle Mixon, 26, fatally shot four Oakland police officers, and wounded a fifth officer. At approximately 1:00 p.m., Mixon shot and killed two officers during a routine traffic stop. Mixon fled the scene, hiding in his sister's nearby apartment, and shortly after 3:00 p.m., he killed two more officers as they responded. During the ensuing shootout, the police killed Mixon in self-defense and a fifth officer was wounded. Three of the officers killed were ranking sergeants, the first time the Oakland Police Department had lost a sergeant in the line of duty. It was the single deadliest day for sworn personnel in the department's history, and also the deadliest attack on U.S. law enforcement since the September 11 attacks. 2010s Due to misconduct by the Oakland Police Department, the City of Oakland has paid a total of $57 million during the 2001‚Äì2011 timeframe to victims of police abuse‚Äîthe largest sum of any city in California.KTVU - Investigation reveals East Bay city paying out extraordinary police abuse settlements Nov 14, 2011 On October 10, 2011, protesters and civic activists began \\"Occupy Oakland\\" demonstrations directed against national social and economic inequality at Frank Ogawa Plaza in Downtown Oakland.Wall Street protesters: We're in for the long haul Bloomberg Businessweek. Accessed: October 3, 2011. The demonstrators set up an encampment that, at one point, consisted of \\"a miniature city\\" of as many as 150 tents. At one point, a second encampment was established at Snow Park on Lake Merritt. Oakland Police raided and dismantled the two protest sites at Frank Ogawa Plaza and Snow Park early in the morning on October 25. Later the same day, in efforts to reestablish the encampments, protesters clashed with police. Two officers and three protesters were injured and more than a hundred people were arrested. On November 2, thousands marched upon and shut down the Port of Oakland. At least two Iraqi war veterans were injured in the demonstrations, by police action. By November 14, the encampment at the plaza in front of City Hall had been cleared, and it was announced by city officials the continued protests had cost the city $2.4 million. A January 28, 2012 attempt by Occupy Oakland protesters to overtake the vacant Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center resulted in hundreds of arrests by police, and that evening a break-in by vandals to Oakland City Hall resulted in damage to artwork and the building itself. Throughout the 2010s, the city's Oakland Medical Center, the first HMO and first Kaiser Permanente hospital, underwent a $2 billion retrofit including numerous new buildings. On April 2, 2012, seven people were killed in a shooting at Oikos University, located in East Oakland near the airport and Coliseum Complex. Suspect One L. Goh surrendered an hour later to police in Alameda. The shooting was considered the deadliest mass killing in the city's history. In July 2013, after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the Trayvon Martin Trials, there were protests. A small group of the protesters were organized in cities including San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta. On December 2, 2016, a fire at a Fruitvale District warehouse, which was hosting a music event, killed at least 36 people. It was the deadliest fire in the city's history. Oakland teachers went on strike in February 2019.

The square is home to many attractions, such as the Opera Theatre, the Jaude Shopping Mall and Saint-Pierre-des-Minimes Church.Trommenschlager, C√©line. Auvergne. N.p.: Petit Fut√©, n.d. Print. Jaude Square was founded in the Roman times but was abandoned in the Middle Ages. Overlooking the square is a massive statue of the ancient Gallic leader Vercingetorix. Erected in 1903, it was created by Fr√©d√©ric Auguste Bartholdi, who also made the Statue of Liberty. The modern square was inaugurated on 17 June 2006, with over 30,000 people coming to attend the opening ceremony.  History  = A Roman commercial suburb = As the excavations carried out during the construction of the Fond de Jaude (1978), Carr√© Jaude I (1995) and Carr√© Jaude II (2009-2010) have shown, the plain of Jaude, almost devoid of construction in the Middle Ages, was on the contrary a densely urbanized sector during Roman times. Archaeological research shows that the Place de Jaude was a public district, a place of passage and merchant. This proto-square was parallel to the hill of Clermont, which hosts the forum under the current Place de la Victoire and the cathedral. = The Middle Ages = In the Middle Ages, the square was a vast, unsuitable swampy area (it was in fact an old crater lake), bordered in the west by a branch of the South Tiretaine, fitted to serve tanneries and mills, in the north and east by the limit of the urbanized sector. The only elevated building in the depression was then the chapel of Jaude, in the southwest of the square. = Modern era = The Saint-Pierre- des-Minimes church was built in 1630. In 1663 a fountain and a pond were installed. In 1750, the square was transformed into a fairground to sell horses and firewood. = Urbanization of the square in the 19th and 20th centuries = In the 19th century, the square became a popular place to walk for the inhabitants. On the east side of the square, the Halle aux Toiles, built in 1812, was transformed to accommodate a large theater in 1894. Two monuments were erected: the statue of General Desaix in 1848 and the equestrian statue of Vercing√©torix in 1903. The Caf√© de Paris (1839), the Caf√© Riche, the Grand caf√© Lyonnais, the Caf√© de L'Univers later opened their terraces on the square. The commercial orientation of the square was confirmed in the 20th century, with the opening of the Paris-Clermont store (the current Cr√©dit commercial de France building) built in 1900, then with the one of the Galeries de Jaude in 1907 (which became Galeries Lafayette in April 1997) which quickly supplant their competitors. In the 1960s and 1970s, the square was renovated in the south: the Fond de Jaude district was destroyed to make way, in 1980, for a large shopping center, the Jaude Centre. = The square during the 1980s = A parking lot was dug under the northern part of the square. Above, a bus station and a T2C shop are located. Almost all of the city buses pass through the square. Two ponds with water jets were created in 1985 in the center of the square, which is bordered by green spaces and magnolias. Near the Jaude Centre, a park is decorated with a fountain designed by the sculptor Jean Chauchard. = The current place = The municipal council decided on the 24th of September 1999 to completely redo the square and install a first tramway line. The development project made by the winning team of the international architecture and landscape competition of Alain Marguerit (Atelier des Paysages Alain Marguerit), Bernard Paris (Atelier d'Architecture Bernard Paris), Jean-Max Llorca (fontain engineer), LEA (Laurent Fachard, lighting technician). The project recalls the facilities which existed in the 19th century. A space mainly reserved for pedestrians and tree lanes (141 in total) between which the new Clermont-Ferrand tramway has passed since November 13, 2006. The square is almost entirely reserved for pedestrians. Vehicles cross it only from east to west between boulevard Desaix and rue Blatin or from west to east from avenue Julien. The northern part is made up of a dark basalt forecourt illuminated at night by 250 red and yellow diodes which symbolize the movement of lava. The rest of the square is paved with light limestone. The work began in January 2003 and was completed in late 2005 at a cost of 15 million euros. The square reopened to the public on the 10th of December 2005 in the presence of 30,000 people and was inaugurated on the 17th of June 2006.

She was the full sister of Sultan Mehmed VI and the half-sister of the Sultans Murad V, Abdul Hamid II and Mehmed V. Early life Mediha Sultan was born on 30 July 1856 at the Dolmabah√ße Palace. Her father was Sultan Abdulmejid I, and her mother was G√ºl√ºst√º Hanƒ±m, the daughter of Prince Tahir Bey Chachba and Afise Lakerba. She was the sister of Mehmed VI and the half-sister of the Sultans Murad V, Abdul Hamid II and Mehmed V. After the death of her mother, she was entrusted to the care of Verdicenan Kadƒ±n the seventh wife and the third Consort of her father Abdulmejid I. The relationship between Mediha and Verdicenan was like mother and daughter, as Verdicenan lost her daughter M√ºnire Sultan in 1862, she kept Mediha under close surveillance, and always helped Mediha whenever she had problems. First marriage When she grew up, Mediha Sultan fell in love with Necip Pasha, son of Sheikh Necipzade Sami Bey, whom she had happened to see. Necip Pasha was born in March 1856. The wedding preparations of the wedding of Mediha Sultan started in the period of Abdulaziz but the marriage took place in the reign of Abdul Hamid. Abdul Hamid who had frowned on Necip's family because they had connections with Ali Suavi, sent Necip to Paris. It was only when Verdicenan Kadƒ±n appealed to Perestu Kadƒ±n that Necip was recalled. He was made a pasha and the marriage was arranged. Her dowry was prepared in 1876, along with her half-sisters Behice Sultan, Seniha Sultan and Naile Sultan. The marriage contract was concluded on 22 January 1879 and the wedding took place on 8 June at the Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace. After her first she was allocated Tarlaba≈üƒ± Palace, where she lived with her first husband until his death. The repair costs of the palaces prepared for the dowry of the sultans were transferred from the treasury to the Tarlaba≈üƒ± palace, which was allocated for Mediha Sultan. The two together had a son, Sultanzade Sami Bey born on 5 April 1880, who later became personal aide-de-camp to Abdul Hamid and served in the Ertuƒürul Regiment. As a member of the entourage of ≈ûehzade Mehmed Abd√ºlkadir, he participated in ceremonial occasions and at the Royal Mosque Processions each Friday, following on horseback behind Abdul Hamid. Like his mother, Sami Bey lived a long life and died in 1961. Mediha Sultan had spent up to four years in Tarlaba≈üƒ± Palace with her first husband, Necib Pasha. On 21 April 1885, Necip Pasha died as a result of disease that lasted ten days at the age of twenty-nine. Mediha Sultan was widowed by his death. After moving to Baltalimanƒ± Palace, her palace was allocated to Zekiye Sultan, daughter of Abdul Hamid II who lived at Tarlaba≈üƒ± Palace after her marriage. Second marriage After Necib Pasha died Abdul Hamid betrothed her to Ferid Pasha, in 1885, Ferid Pasha was born in 1853. The marriage took place on 29 April 1886, Mediha Sultan's deputy was Hafƒ±z Behram Bey and Ferid Pasha's deputy was Gazi Osman Pasha, but no children came of this marriage. After marrying Ferid Pasha, Mediha Sultan continued her life in Tarlaba≈üƒ± Palace, where she lived with her first husband, Necib Pasha. Starting a new life with the memories of his ex-husband in this palace will have given the her a pain that she wanted to settle in Baltalimanƒ± Water Front Palace, which was left empty after Fatma Sultan's death shortly after marrying Ferit Bey. After some years of her second marriage she settled in Baltalimani Palace with her second husband, the palace belonged to her half-sister Fatma Sultan. In 1899, she met with the German Empress Augusta Victoria. Mediha Sultan and her husband Damat Ferid Pasha, who would later be called a traitor, lived in this beach house for long years. Damat Ferid, who after his marriage with Mediha Sultan, lived a secluded life in his palace in Baltalimanƒ±, hoping to take advantage of the opportunities to be a member of the dynasty, to be a great civil servant, Damat Ferid was appointed by the Sultan to the Embassy of London through the Sultan. Character Mediha was fond of European ways. She dressed beautifully and with great dignity appearing splendidly regal in her gowns with their long trains. She was petite with white skin and gorgeous black eyes, and she resembled her father. In manner, she was gracious, attractive, and wonderfully kind. Everyone in the palace loved this princess. As did Princess Seniha Sultan, she too spoke laughingly, with an air of good humour in her voice. When these two sisters were together chatting with their brother Sultan Abdul Hamid II, they would both laugh and try to amuse him and get him to smile as though they were in competition with one another. Death At the exile of the imperial family in 1924, Mediha Sultan went to live in Nice, France, where she died on 3 December 1928, at the age of seventy-two. Issue Together with Necib Pasha, Mediha had one son: * Sultanzade Abdurrahman Sami Bey (Tarlaba≈üƒ± Palace, 5 April 1880 - London, England, 15 August 1961), firstly married Peyveste Hanƒ±m in 1909, secondly married R√ºmeysa Hanƒ±m and had nine children in which there were six sons and three daughters; See also * List of Ottoman princesses Ancestry References Sources  * Category:1856 births Category:1928 deaths Category:19th- century Ottoman royalty Category:Daughters of Ottoman sultans Category:20th- century Ottoman royalty Category:19th-century women of the Ottoman Empire Category:20th-century women of the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Mediha Sultan"},{"id":"43414944","text":"The grave of Anna Bornemisza in the Reformed Church of Farkas street in Cluj- Napoca Anna Bornemisza (1630-1688), was a Hungarian noble, princess consort of Transylvania as the spouse of Michael I Apafi, and mother of Michael II Apafi.

A second pipeline, by a divergent route, was laid in the 1960s. History Pumping Station In 1937 Premier of South Australia Richard Butler negotiated with BHP to erect a blast furnace at Whyalla to process iron ore from Iron Knob using brown coal from Leigh Creek. Lack of sufficient fresh water was an obstacle, To this end Butler pushed through enabling legislation and sent engineers to Western Australia to inspect their achievements in above-ground pipelines, notably the Goldfields pipeline engineered by C. Y. O'Connor. In 1938 Premier Thomas Playford increased the demands on BHP, and came to an agreement with Essington Lewis that if the company were to install a tinplate manufacturing plant, the State would supply the water infrastructure. Playford reckoned on the proposed pipeline also supplying the needs of Commonwealth Railways at Port Augusta for their Trans Australian and Adelaide-Port Augusta railway lines. Prime Minister Lyons agreed to help South Australia with a development loan. In 1939 Lyons died and was replaced by Robert Menzies; shortly after, World War II broke out and Menzies joined with Britain in declaring war on Germany. Under the changed circumstances, Playford renegotiated the deal in terms of shipbuilding rather than tinplate manufacture. In 1940 the Commonwealth Water Agreement Ratification Act was passed, complementary legislation passed through South Australia's parliament and South Australia's Engineering and Water Supply Department was given the task of getting the job done, under considerable pressure from the War Department, and with reduced manpower and materials due to exigencies of wartime. The first stage, from Whyalla to the Baroota Reservoir, was rushed through to help supply water for shipping. The whole route, using continuously welded steel pipe (supplied by Hume Pipe Company), four pumping stations and 127 concrete storage tanks, was completed in 1944, just in time to alleviate a serious drought that had hit the mid-North of South Australia. The pipeline was officially opened by the Governor of South Australia, Sir Malcolm Barclay-Harvey in 1945. Description Morgan is a small town built on high ground overlooking the Murray at a point the river changes its westerly course to almost due south. The first pumping station is situated on the river bank, upstream from Morgan. Here a large concrete chamber was constructed, the floor of which is below the river's low water level, and the walls of which rise to above the flood level. The chamber is somewhat elliptical in shape and is divided by a wall across the smaller diameter; one half housing the pumps and the other containing the screening machinery. The concrete walls of the chamber are over a metre thick to give it sufficient weight to prevent it floating during a flood. A control room above the chamber houses the switch board, instruments and a diesel stand-by generator. Water is drawn from the river and passes through rotary screens having a fine wire mesh of 200 openings to the inch (80 per cm). This removes all solid matter except colloidal clay, which when present gives rise to a milky appearance. The water receives no other treatment, and its salinity and hardness are less than that of Mundaring water which is used in the comparable Goldfields pipeline. The centrifugal pumps are driven by 400 h.p. (300 kW) electric motors, the power for which was originally supplied from the Osborne Power Station, and later from Port Augusta. The four intermediate pumping stations, which are all similar, fill a receiving tank elevated to , and are each at a lower elevation than the previous storage tank, so the centrifugal pumps run with a flooded inlet and do not require priming. The last pumping station operates into the Hanson storage tanks, which are above sea level and from Morgan. From Morgan to No. 4 pumping station the pipe travels through arid country; after that it passes through good agricultural land and thence through the Flinders Ranges at Hughes Gap. The pipe then follows the eastern side of Spencer Gulf to Port Augusta and after rounding the head of the gulf continues southward to Whyalla, again passing through arid country. The route was chosen to pass close to all the main reservoirs in the mid-north of South Australia, so that they could be supplied with River Murray water. From the Hanson tanks the water gravitates all the way to Whyalla, a distance of . The total length of the pipeline is and the pipes, which are of steel, concrete lined and protected against external corrosion by \\"galvanite\\", a proprietary zinc coating, vary in size from to . The South Australian engineers followed the later practice of the Goldfields Water Supply in adopting continuous welding of the pipes. This was soon vindicated when floods hit Port Augusta and Whyalla, causing damage to roads, bridges and the pipeline. At one place, where the water had swept across the road and piled timber up against the pipeline a length of pipe 80 m. between concrete blocks had been bowed outward by over a metre, but had not broken. In another place an 80 m. length of pipe had been completely undermined, and the pipe had sagged about a metre, being dragged down by a large concrete block, weighing about three tonnes, which was left suspended. Close to the block the pipe had buckled, and twisted through 180 degrees without fracture. Two breaks had occurred in the pipeline during the flood, both at places where it was carried over creeks on concrete road bridges. These bridges had been undermined and swept away, carrying the pipe with them. Repairs were made as soon as the flood subsided, and the supply to Whyalla was restored within ten days. This article gives a series of interesting comparisons with the somewhat larger Goldfields scheme. Related pipelines A second Morgan‚ÄìWhyalla pipeline was commenced in 1963 and completed in 1967. It was made considerably shorter by passing the last section under Spencer Gulf rather than around it. A similar project, the Mannum‚ÄìAdelaide pipeline, began in 1949 and was completed in 1955, just in time to avert a serious water shortage.

Tsien, was a Chinese sinologist and librarian who served as a professor of Chinese literature and library science at the University of Chicago, and was also curator of its East Asian Library from 1949 to 1978. He is known for studies of the history of the Chinese book, Chinese bibliography, paleography, and science and technology, especially the history of paper and printing in China, notably Paper and Printing, Volume 5 Pt 1 of Joseph Needham's Science and Civilisation in China. He is also known for risking his life to smuggle tens of thousands of rare books outside of Japanese-occupied China during World War II.  Early life  Tsien was born on January 11, 1910 in Taixian (modern Taizhou), Jiangsu Province, to a prominent family that descended from King Qian Liu, founder of the Wuyue kingdom. He began the memoir of his life by saying \\"I was born during the reign of the last Emperor of the Imperial Dynasty.\\"T.H. Tsien Turns 100 Tableau Spring 2010 His father Qian Weizhen () was a prominent scholar of Buddhism, and his great grandfather Qian Guisen () was a member of the Hanlin Academy. Tsien began his education with a private tutor in 1916, and then entered Taixian No. 2 Senior Elementary School. He became active in political agitation when he was a student at Huaidong High School (now Taizhou High School). After graduating in 1925, he joined the \\"Youth Society\\" in Taizhou and edited its journal. Due to their political activities, Tsien and his colleagues were arrested by the Jiangsu warlord Sun Chuanfang. His family managed to secure his release, but the principal of Huaidong High School was executed. Unable to remain in Taizhou, he left for Nanking (Nanjing) and never returned to his hometown again. In 1927, he enlisted in the army to take part in the Northern Expedition's military campaign to unite China under the Nationalist government.  Career and contributions  Tsien entered University of Nanking in 1928 and graduated in 1932 with a degree in history and a minor in library science. He went on to the Jiaotong University Library in Shanghai. He then worked at the Nanking branch of the National Library. In 1936, he married Hsu Wen-chin. In early 1937, the National Library transferred him to the Shanghai branch to curate a large group of rare books and manuscripts which the government had sent there in 1931 when the Japanese army had invaded Manchuria. In 1941, war with the United States meant that this group of books and manuscripts would no longer be safe even in Shanghai. Tsien packed some 30,000 of them for shipment to the United States for safekeeping. In order to evade Japanese confiscation, he marked them as new books and waited to ship them in small groups at times when he knew a friendly Chinese customs worker was on duty. He later recalled \\"had the Japanese occupying forces discovered this subterfuge, and that I had personally been responsible in this task, I would most likely have been executed.\\" The Library of Congress microfilmed the collection to make it widely available. After the end of World War II, Tsien was sent to the United States in 1947 to manage the repatriation of these volumes. However, the Chinese Civil War precluded shipping the books and his own return to China. In the mid-1960s, the United States gave the books to Taiwan, where the Republic of China government had retreated after losing the civil war. They are currently at the National Palace Museum in Taipei. Herrlee Glessner Creel, professor of Chinese at University of Chicago, invited \\"T.H.\\", as his friends called him, to catalog the roughly 100,000 Chinese books in the collection Creel had built. At Creel's suggestion, Tsien enrolled in the Library School, and soon was curator of the Far Eastern Library and professorial lecturer in Chinese literature in the Department of Oriental Languages and Literature. Tsien also earned Masters and Doctoral degrees in the Library School. He received a Ph.D. at Chicago in 1957; his dissertation was published by the University of Chicago Press in 1962 as Written on Bamboo and Silk:The Beginnings of Chinese Books and Inscriptions. Tsien was especially concerned to build relations of cooperation between China and other countries. His master's thesis, \\"Western Impact on China Through Translation,\\" was published as an article in 1954, and the 1869 donation of books by the emperor in Beijing to the Library of Congress was the subject of a 1964 article. His concern with scholarly communication between East and West led him to translate his English writings into Chinese and his Chinese writings into English. Another major activity was encouraging the development of Chinese collections outside China and the promotion of librarianship as a profession. Many Chinese librarians received their training under his example and instruction, including ones who gained leading positions at Harvard-Yenching Library, Princeton University's Gest Library, and the Library of Congress. In his nineties Tsien helped with the revision and proofreading for the 2nd edition of his Written on Bamboo and Silk, which appeared in 2004, and arranged for it to be translated into Chinese. Tsien died on April 9, 2015 in Chicago, at the age of 105.  Family  Tsien's wife, Wen-ching Hsu (, 1916-2008), was one of the earliest teachers of Chinese at University of Chicago. She died in 2008. The couple had three daughters, Ginger Tsien (1936-2008), Mary Tsien Dunkel, and Gloria Tsien (b. 1940). Tsien's nephew, Xiaowen Qian, is an assistant to the curator for the East Asian Collection of University of Chicago.  Honors and awards  Tsien received a Distinguished Alumni Award from University of Chicago and also from Nanjing University. The National Library of China gave him the Distinguished Service Award in 1999. In 2007, Nanjing University established the T. H. Tsien Library in his honor. He donated thousands of books from his own collection to the library. Selected publications in English   2nd edition, with Edward Shaughnessy.

Due to the poor treatment of the residents of the pueblo, a revolt by indigenous peoples in 1680 resulted in the Spanish being driven out of the area. Sixteen years later the Taos valley was resettled by Don Diego de Vargas of Spain with a renewed and more respectful perspective. Spanish families settled in the Taos Plaza area and Ranchos de Taos. In 1710 the Spanish regained the territory. For protection against attacks by Plains Indians, many people of Spanish heritage lived on, or built houses very near, the Taos Pueblo. Subsequently, concerned about the rate of intermarriage between the Spanish and people of the pueblo, the Spanish were asked to move at least \\"one league\\" away from the pueblo. In 1779 the Battle of Cuerno Verde was led by Juan Bautista de Anza against the Comanches. Several tribal leaders and the chief were killed during the battle. As a result, the hostilities by that tribe subsided. In 1794 an order was initiated that prohibited Spanish, Negroes and mulattoes from living on pueblo lands.

His work is in many important collections, including those of the American Folk Art Museum, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Petullo Collection, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The New York Times has praised his \\"paintings and drawings of gestural force and narrative interest.\\" McCarthy's imagery anticipates the Pop art of the 1960s.  Life and work  McCarthy lived for almost his entire life in the small town of Weatherly, Pennsylvania, where his family was well established (a patrician background uncommon among self-taught artists). He failed his second year exams while in law school at the University of Pennsylvania, which led to a severe mental breakdown, after which he was institutionalized for years before returning \\"to his family's decayed mansion, where he lived with his mother.\\"For the fact that the breakdown followed on the failure of his exams, see any of the references (except Hughes). This breakdown saved him from the trenches of World War I, but considerably reduced his professional prospects. McCarthy then turned to art as a therapeutic outlet from the menial work he was limited to by his precarious mental health. His mother died in 1940, leaving him alone in the big, dilapidated house (which was grand enough to have its own theatre for the staging of plays). His art depicts figures from popular culture as well as animals, biblical scenes, and everyday life. Pictorially, he had a predilection for glamorous women‚Äîmovie stars, fashion models, and other celebrities‚Äîas well as sports heroes. This interest in popular culture was not uncommon among American artists in the 1920s: both Stuart Davis and Gerard Murphy incorporated the visual argot of advertising into a bright Cubist syntax. Unlike these proto-Pop artists, however, McCarthy's style is expressionist, with a highly gestural and textured appearance that readily calls to mind works by European masters such as Emil Nolde and Chaim Soutine.

In 1992 it was known as \\"Daytona Fall Tour\\"; in 1993, it started to be called Biketoberfest, and is now known as the \\"little brother\\" of the spring Daytona Beach Bike Week event. Attendance for Biketoberfest 2013 was estimated to be c. 100,000 visitors. The event's organizing authority is Halifax Area Advertising Authority, whose director has noted attendance has dropped off since 2004, and the 100,000 attendance figure is an approximation as entry is free without a ticket, and that the true attendance is \\"nearly impossible to count\\". Local merchants have asked to have the event extended from four days to 10 days in duration. The advertising authority withdrew plans for a $300,000 advertising campaign in Ohio after studies showed negative perceptions of the Daytona Beach area. Reporters have noted that compared to the spring Daytona rally, Biketoberfest features a higher proportion of choppers in attendance, warmer local waters and weather in transit from the Northeast United States, more new-model introductions from manufacturers, and less crowded streets and more abundant lodging. The Buffalo Chip Campground (better known for its Sturgis Motorcycle Rally presence) opened a site at Daytona just before Biketoberfest 2004, raising concerns about public nudity. Earlier concerns had prompted the creation of a city ordinance with unusually detailed definitions of body coverage, gaining international attention. The ordinance was deemed unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds by a Federal judge in 2006. Like the spring bike event in Daytona Beach, Biketoberfest features coleslaw wrestling. While the racing at Daytona International Speedway is more club-oriented, the CCS-sanctioned Fall Cycle Scene races at the Speedway are technically part of Biketoberfest, similar to Bike Week's Supercross-oriented draws. The 2020 event will have the most races of a previous event, as the COVID-19 pandemic led to cancellation of all Bike Week road racing events, with the majority of events moved to Biketoberfest, including the Daytona 200. In media and the arts The American Chopper television show pilot aired in January, 2003, titled \\"Biketober\\", concerned a custom motorcycle presented at Biketoberfest. The pilot for a 2006 show, The Metric Revolution, was filmed at Biketoberfest. The first Orange County Choppers themed motorcycle, a Spider-Man themed build, was done for Biketoberfest, as was the very first OCC bike \\"True Blue\\", shown there in 1999. Performance artist Paul Zaloom created a 2006 shadow puppet play based on his experiences at Biketoberfest.

Powered by four WJ-6 turboprops, it is one of the largest flying boats with a MTOW. After five years of development, assembly started in August 2014, it was rolled out on 23 July 2016 and it made its first flight from Zhuhai Airport on 24 December 2017; it should be certified in 2021, with deliveries starting in 2022. Development The AG600 was previously known as the TA-600; it was designated the Dragon 600 before TA-600. After five years of development, CAIGA started to build the aircraft in August 2014, for a first flight targeted at the time for 2015. Assembly was still on its way in October 2015. The prototype was rolled out on 23 July 2016 at the Zhuhai AVIC factory. At the roll-out, AVIC targeted a maiden flight by the end of 2016 and it has then gathered 17 orders, all from the Chinese government including the China Coast Guard, AVIC does not expect to produce it in large numbers. Target markets also include export sales, with island countries such as New Zealand and Malaysia having expressed an interest. On 24 December 2017, it made its maiden flight from Zhuhai Jinwan Airport. In May 2018, AVIC planned to have Civil Aviation Administration of China type certification completed by 2021 and deliveries starting in 2022. After transfer from Zhuhai to Jingmen, the prototype started low-speed taxiing on the Zhanghe reservoir on 30 August 2018. On 20 October 2018, the prototype AG600 completed its first water take-off and landing at Jingmen's Zhanghe Reservoir and on 26 July 2020, the AG600 completed its first test flight from the ocean, after taking off from Qingdao. Further variants may be developed for maritime surveillance, resource detection, passenger and cargo transport. It is one of the three big plane projects approved by the State Council of China, with the Xi'an Y-20 military transport and the Comac C919 airliner. Design The AG600 amphibious aircraft has a single body flying boat fuselage, cantilevered high wings, four WJ-6 turboprops and tricycle retractable landing gear. It can operate from stretches of water deep, and should be able to conduct Sea State 3 operations with waves. It was developed for aerial firefighting, collecting of water in 20 seconds and transporting up to of water on a single tank of fuel ( rotations), and search and rescue, retrieving up to 50 people at sea. Assembled by CAIGA, it is 36.9m long and has a 38.8m wingspan, its MTOW is from paved runways or from choppy sea. AVIC claims it is the largest amphibious aircraft. It is heavier than the MTOW Beriev Be-200 or the ShinMaywa US-2, but lighter than the prototype-only Beriev A-40. Previous seaplanes were heavier, as the Martin JRM Mars or the prototypes Blohm & Voss BV 238, Saunders-Roe Princess or Hughes H-4 Hercules. It could access remote atolls in the South China Sea‚Äôs Spratly Islands, claimed by several bordering nations, as the South China Sea is subjected to territorial disputes. It can fly in four hours from the southern city of Sanya to James Shoal, the southernmost edge of China's territorial claims.

Life The youngest of nine children of Thomas and Ann Kay of Knaresborough, he was born 8 April 1820, at Pickering, North Yorkshire. He passed two years at Giggleswick school, and, together with James Fraser, gained an open scholarship at Lincoln College, Oxford, 15 March 1836. He graduated in 1839 with a first class in classics and a second in mathematics. He was elected a fellow of his college 22 October 1840, and in 1842 was appointed one of the tutors, proceeded M.A., and was elected Pusey and Ellerton Hebrew scholar. Kay took holy orders in 1843, and in 1849, after proceeding B.D., he went out to India as principal of Bishop‚Äôs College, Calcutta. In 1855 he paid his only visit to England while principal of Bishop's College, and proceeded D.D. at Oxford. In 1864 he resigned his post at Calcutta and returned to Oxford. In 1865 Kay was made select preacher before the university, and in 1866 was presented by his college to the rectory of Great Leighs, Essex, where he remained for the rest of his life. He was appointed Grinfield lecturer in 1869, was an honorary canon of St Albans Cathedral, and one of the bishop's chaplains. Kay died, after much suffering, 16 January 1886.

The bill was passed by the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress, Background North Korea‚ÄìUnited States relations developed primarily during the Korean War, but in recent years have been largely defined by North Korea's three tests of nuclear weapons, its development of long-range missiles capable of striking targets thousands of miles away, and its ongoing threats to strike the United States and South Korea with nuclear weapons and conventional forces. The 2013 Korean crisis, also referred to as the North Korean crisis by media, was an escalation of tensions between North Korea and South Korea, the United States, and Japan that began because of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2087, which condemned North Korea for the launch of Kwangmy≈èngs≈èng-3 Unit 2. The crisis was marked by extreme escalation of rhetoric by the new North Korean administration under Kim Jong-un and actions suggesting imminent nuclear attacks against South Korea, Japan, and the United States. According to a recent Gallup poll, North Korea is the most disliked nation in the United States, with only about 11% of Americans viewing North Koreans favorably. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2013 would direct the President to investigate credible information of sanctionable activities involving North Korea and to designate and apply sanctions with respect to any person (referred to as a \\"designated person\\" and includes business entities, nongovernmental organizations, and governmental entities operating as business enterprises) the President determines is knowingly: :*contributing, through the export to or import from North Korea of any goods or technology, to the use, development, production, stockpiling, or acquisition of nuclear, radiological, chemical, or biological weapons, or any device or system designed to deliver such weapons; :*exporting, or facilitating the export of, defense articles and services to North Korea, or from North Korea to any other country; :*exporting, or facilitating the export of, any luxury goods to North Korea; :*providing, selling, leasing, registering, or reflagging a vessel, aircraft, or other conveyance, or providing insurance or any other shipping or transportation service used to transport goods to or from North Korea, for purposes of facilitating a specified unlawful activity or evading a regulation established under this Act or the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA); :*transferring, paying, exporting, withdrawing, or otherwise dealing with any property or interest in property of the government of North Korea for purposes of facilitating such unlawful activity or evading such regulations; :*engaging in or facilitating censorship by North Korea; or :*committing or facilitating a serious human rights abuse by North Korea. The bill would direct the President to designate and exercise IEEPA authorities with respect to the government of North Korea as well as any person or foreign government the President determines has been: :*listed or sanctioned under any regulation, specified executive order, or the IEEPA for illicit activities or activities concerning North Korea's :*proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; :*sanctioned under U.N. Security Council resolutions concerning North Korea's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; or :*convicted of a criminal offense for engaging in sanctionable activities. The bill would authorize the President to exercise IEEPA authorities with respect to any foreign government or financial institution the President determines to be: :*engaging in sanctionable activities involving North Korea; :*failing to freeze funds, assets, or economic resources of a person designated pursuant to the requirements above or that could be used to facilitate sanctionable activities relating to imports or exports; :*failing to monitor import and export transactions appropriately; :*permitting any North Korean financial institution to open any new branches, offices, or joint ventures within its jurisdiction, or to take an ownership interest in, or establish or maintain a correspondent relationship with any bank in its jurisdiction, if it could be used to facilitate sanctionable import or export activities; :*failing to prohibit transfers of bulk cash to and from North Korea in facilitation of sanctionable import or export activities; :*providing public financial support for trade with North Korea to facilitate such import or export activities; or :*facilitating the use of any proceeds of the bribery of North Korean government officials, or the misappropriation, theft, or embezzlement of public funds by, or for the benefit of, such officials. The bill would set forth civil and criminal penalties under the IEEPA. The bill would establish the North Korea Enforcement and Humanitarian Fund in which assets subject to criminal, civil, or administrative forfeiture or penalties are to be deposited for the enforcement of this Act and to carry out humanitarian activities under the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004. The bill would express the sense of Congress that the government of North Korea should be treated as a primary money laundering concern that may be required to undertake special measures with respect to the recordkeeping and reporting of certain financial transactions as well as the identification of customers or retention of information relating to certain beneficial ownership, payable-through, or correspondent accounts. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to require domestic financial institutions to apply special measures to certain designated entities. The bill would direct domestic financial institutions to terminate various accounts maintained for persons, foreign governments, or financial institutions required to be designated as engaging in sanctionable activity under this Act and for foreign financial institutions providing services to such designated entities. The bill would prohibit a designated person that is a domestic financial institution from serving as a primary dealer in U.S. debt instruments or as a repository for U.S. funds. The bill would set forth authority for the President to prohibit certain foreign exchange and banking transactions, revoke transaction licenses, and direct the United States Secretary of State to deny visas to designated aliens. The bill would permit the President to impose sanctions against persons providing specialized financial messaging services to designated North Korean financial institutions. The bill would require a validated license for exports to North Korea under the Export Administration Act of 1979. Prohibits munitions and defense articles from being provided to North Korea under the Arms Export Control Act regardless of whether it is designated as a state sponsor of terrorism. The bill would bar U.S. government contracts from being provided to designated persons. The bill would authorize the seizure or forfeiture of vessels or aircraft used to facilitate sanctionable activities. The bill would direct the President to withhold assistance to the governments of countries providing defense articles or services to North Korea or receiving such articles or services from North Korea. The bill would set forth exceptions to designations under this Act and authorizes the President to waive designations and sanctions, for a period of up to one year, upon the President's submission to Congress of a determination that the waiver: :*protects vital U.S. economic and national security interests, :*benefits entities cooperating with investigations, and :*addresses humanitarian aid considerations while meeting other specified standards. Permits the President to temporarily suspend sanctions with a certification to Congress under specified circumstances and to prescribe rules for removing sanctions. The bill would direct issuers of financial securities regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to disclose activities relating to North Korea in annual and quarterly reports. The bill would authorize state and local governments to divest assets and prohibit investments in companies that invest in North Korea. The bill would exempt North Korea from the jurisdictional immunity of foreign states, thereby enabling plaintiffs to seek certain damages against North Korea regardless of whether it is designated as a state sponsor of terrorism. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on May 29, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 1771 would expand existing sanctions against North Korea. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the bill would cost $10 million over the 2015-2019 period, assuming appropriation of the estimated amounts. Pay-as-you-go procedures apply to this legislation because it would affect direct spending and revenues; however, CBO estimates that those effects would not be significant. Provisions of H.R. 1771 would increase administrative costs of the United States Department of State and the United States Department of the Treasury. Based on information from the Administration, CBO estimates that the departments would hire 10 additional employees to implement the bill and would require additional appropriations averaging $2 million a year over the 2015-2019 period. Procedural history The North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on April 26, 2013 by Rep. Edward R. Royce (R, CA-39). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, the United States House Committee on Ways and Means, the United States House Committee on the Judiciary, the United States House Committee on Financial Services, the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, the United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade, and the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations. On July 28, 2014, the bill was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-560 part 1. The House voted on July 28, 2014 to pass the bill in a voice vote. Debate and discussion Rep. Ed Royce, who introduced the bill, said that \\"by shutting down North Korea's illicit activities, we deprive the Kim regime of the money he needs to pay his generals and to conduct nuclear weapons research.\\" Royce also argued that \\"North Korea is undoubtedly one of the most significant security threats that we here face and our allies face.\\" Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) also supported the bill, arguing that \\"the U.S. will not and cannot allow an authoritarian regime to operate with impunity and threaten our national security and that of our allies.\\" The North Korea Freedom Coalition supported the bill, encouraging Americans to contact their Members of Congress about the bill. According to the organization, the bill \\"would impose tough, targeted financial sanctions on North Korean leaders who are responsible for crimes against humanity and would significantly decrease North Korea's profoundly egregious human rights abuses.\\" An editorial in The Boston Globe called for the passage of the bill as a way for the United States to unilaterally \\"step up the pressure on this irresponsible regime.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Economic sanctions *International sanctions *Chemical weapon proliferation *Nuclear proliferation References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 1771 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 1771 *GovTrack.us H.R. 1771 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 1771 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 1771 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 1771 *House Report 113-560 part 1 on H.R. 1771 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:North Korea‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Sanctions legislation ","title":"North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2013"},{"id":"43415263","text":"Rampersad also spelt as Ramprasad or Rampersaud is a surname common in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, the Caribbean, Fiji, South Africa, and Mauritius.http://www.ancestry.ca/name-origin?surname=rampersad It is of Indian and Hindu origin, derived from the Sanskrit words Rama Prasada, and is not affiliated with any certain caste.http://www.islandmix.com/backchat/f6/common- west-indian-surnames-213622/ In India it is used as a first name, but the descendants of the indentured laborers in the European Colonies used their fathers' first name as their surname.

Their father was among the Yugoslav airmen that defended the country in April 1941 during the German invasion before getting captured by the invading Germans and taken to a Nazi concentration camp in Osnabr√ºck where he was imprisoned until the end of World War II. In the meantime, her mother Olga had left the family so that young Ljubica and her brother were raised by their grandmother Danica in Deligradska Street in Belgrade. Following the war, due to his royalist worldview, their father Bo≈æidar was unwilling to return home to Yugoslavia that had in the meantime become a communist people's republic. Ota≈°eviƒá could thus only meet with her father abroad, which was further made difficult by FPR Yugoslavia's strict exit criteria. Still, she did manage to see him twice, in 1953 and 1954, in Italy and France, respectively, while playing in basketball tournaments with her club. Simultaneously with basketball, Ota≈°eviƒá enrolled at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Philosophy. Basketball career Eighteen-year-old Ota≈°eviƒá began playing basketball at ≈ΩKK Crvena zvezda in 1951. She also made the Yugoslav national team and competed at the 1954 European Women's Basketball Championship held at home in Belgrade. It was the very first time that the Yugoslavia women's national basketball team appeared in a major international competition. Playing alongside her club teammates Gordana Baraga, Cmiljka \\"Cica\\" Kalu≈°eviƒá, and Aleksandra Gec, Ota≈°eviƒá appeared in six games at the competition, recording a total of 19 points (3.2ppg).Ota≈°eviƒá @ 1954 European Women's Basketball ChampionshipFIBA archives The Yugoslav team made the final round where it lost four of its five games, ending the competition in fifth place. Two years later, she represented Yugoslavia again at the 1956 European Women's Basketball Championship in Czechoslovakia. This time, Yugoslavia failed to make it out of their preliminary round-robin group and had to go to the classification round, eventually finishing the competition in ninth place. Ota≈°eviƒá appeared in 7 games, scoring a total of 35 points (5.0ppg).Ota≈°eviƒá @ 1956 European Women's Basketball ChampionshipFIBA archives In 1957, the twenty-four-year-old student left FPR Yugoslavia for Italy, ostensibly to study Italian as part of university exchange. Although she would visit Yugoslavia briefly on few occasions, she never again returned to live in the country. Acting career Ota≈°eviƒá's career in movies started in 1957 shortly after her departure from Yugoslavia and move to Italy. Several months later, during a short stay in England, the twenty-four-year-old got spotted by a Columbia Pictures producer and representative Carl Foreman who hired Ota≈°eviƒá to be Sophia Loren's body double in the English film director Carol Reed's movie The Key starring Loren and William Holden that was filmed between July and December 1957 on various locations in England such as Henley-on-Thames, Isle of Portland, and Elstree Studios in Borehamwood.The Key filming locations Due to Loren's absence from the set in the first days of shooting, Ota≈°eviƒá reportedly appears in most of the frames where the character has her back to the camera or her face is not shown close-up. Fifty-four-year-old Hollywood film star Cary Grant‚Äîwho was married to Betsy Drake at the time and whose turbulent affair with Loren had just ended‚Äîsoon became aware of Loren's body double Ota≈°eviƒá and began to pursue the young Yugoslav, leading to a romantic involvement between the two. By January 1959, he brought her to Hollywood, signing her to a contract with his production company that did business with Universal Pictures and enrolling her in acting classes with a view of jump-starting a movie career for his young lover. During summer 1960, Ota≈°eviƒá briefly came back home to Belgrade in order to film her small part in '. In the early 1960s, in Rome, Ota≈°eviƒá got a few roles in Italian movies such as Il gobbo, peplum film Il trionfo di Maciste, and comedy Maurizio, Peppino e le indossatrici. She appeared in these films using the alias Liuba Bodin. Personal life In 1950, seventeen-year- old Ota≈°eviƒá, a junior basketball player within the ≈ΩKK Crvena zvezda youth system, began dating twenty-two-year-old KK Crvena zvezda and Yugoslavia national team small forward Srƒëan Kalember. Their respective families had a prior history as their fathers were both Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers; Srƒëan's father Jovan was the commanding officer to Ota≈°eviƒá's father Bo≈æidar and, furthermore, both men were captured by the Germans in 1941 and imprisoned in the same Osnabr√ºck concentration camp. Following World War II, Kalember's father returned to the newly-communist Yugoslavia while Ota≈°eviƒá's father decided not to, staying abroad in Western Europe until his death in 1956. A year into dating Kalember, Ota≈°eviƒá made the Crvena zvezda women's team full squad. For the next few years, they functioned as a prominent sports couple in the city of Belgrade, both wearing number 12 jerseys in KK Crvena zvezda's men's and women's teams, respectively, as basketball gained popularity throughout the post-war Yugoslav society. Their relationship lasted three and a half years before ending in 1954. A great beauty by many accounts, Ota≈°eviƒá attracted plenty of male attention, with reports of various prominent men ‚Äî such as the JNA general Peko Dapƒçeviƒá, UDBA security operative , and writer Ivo Andriƒá ‚Äî coming to the Crvena Zvezda courts at Kalemegdan in order to watch her play. After the relationship with Kalember ended, Ota≈°eviƒá started dating another professional athlete ‚Äî FK Partizan footballer Milo≈° Milutinoviƒá. Soon after her 1957 move to Italy and appearance in The Key as Sophia Loren's body double, Ota≈°eviƒá began a relationship with Hollywood movie star Cary Grant, twenty-eight years her senior and married to Betsy Drake at the time. Fresh off seeing his extramarital affair with Loren end in turbulent fashion, Grant jumped into a relationship with her body double Ota≈°eviƒá. At first, the couple was mostly apart as Ota≈°eviƒá lived in Rome while Grant divided his time between England and the United States, but, by January 1959, he brought her to Hollywood. Grant reportedly even accompanied Ota≈°eviƒá when she briefly went back to Yugoslavia for her grandmother Danica's funeral. In December 2006, his love letters to Ota≈°eviƒá, written between March 1958 and January 1959, were auctioned off at Christie's in London. In the early 1960s, she caught the eye of flamboyant baron Enrico \\"Ricky\\" di Portanova, the American-born, Italian-raised son of an Italian baron, Paolo di Portanova, and American mother Lillie Cullen, the daughter of oil tycoon Hugh Roy Cullen. The young couple initially lived in Rome where di Portanova ran a jewelry business. After getting married, the couple moved to Houston, Texas in order for di Portanova to try and collect his share of his late maternal grandfather's oil inheritance, which he eventually succeeded in doing. By the mid-to-late 1960s, Ota≈°eviƒá's marriage to di Portanova was on the rocks and the two officially divorced in 1972. Following a divorce settlement in which she reportedly got USD1.5 million, Ota≈°eviƒá divided her time between her property in Houston and a villa in Marbella, Spain.  In popular culture  In the 2015 Serbian sports drama We Will Be the World Champions, Ota≈°eviƒá is portrayed by Nina Jankoviƒá.

He is a well known pioneer of many nuclear transplantation studies and was named in 2013 by journal Nature as \\"the cloning chief\\". Mitalipov is also a godfather of a gene therapy, known as mitochondrial replacement therapy, that prevents inheritance of mitochondrial diseases. He discovered a new way of creating human stem cells from skin cells. Early life Mitalipov was born in 1961 in Almaty, Kazakhstan, then part of the Soviet Union. He is of Uyghur ancestry. He served two years in Soviet military, beginning in 1979, as an army radio technician. Education After the military, Mitalipov studied genetics at the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy in Moscow and also played blues guitar in a cover band to pay the bills. After his graduation from the academy, he worked for a short time as the chief livestock specialist in a kolkhoz in the Yaroslavl region. He received his master's degree in 1989. He earned his PhD in developmental and stem cell biology from the Research Centre of Medical Genetics in Moscow. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 funding for stem cell research was scarce, so Mitalipov applied for and won a fellowship at Utah State University in 1995. He started working at the Oregon National Primate Research Center in 1998, where he could work with monkeys, which share 98% of their DNA with humans; at Utah State Mitalipov had worked with cow DNA. Breakthroughs A therapy for mitochondrial diseases that Mitalipov discovered, the \\"spindle transfer\\" technique, involves removing the nucleus from a human egg and placing it into another. If the egg is fertilized, in genetic terms it would have three parents. Mitalipov has successfully bred \\"three-parent\\" rhesus macaques. The possibility of using the procedure on human eggs has raised safety and ethics questions. In May 2013, Mitalipov and his team published a study in Cell that describes a new process for creating human stem cells from skin cells. The stem cell discovery made several journals' \\"Top 10\\" scientific breakthrough lists in 2013, including Nature, Science, Time, Discover, National Geographic and The Week. In August 2017, Mitalipov's collaborative work with the Institute for Basic Science, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, Seoul National University, BGI-Shenzhen and BGI-Qingdao, was published in Nature. performed the first known successful attempt at genetically correcting mutant human embryos, using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene modifying tool. Mitalipov and his team experimented upon a larger number of human embryos carrying a genetic defect causing heart disease. They demonstrated the possibility of safely and efficiently correcting the defective gene that cause inherited heart disease.

Schaefer striking down Virginia's same- sex marriage ban which is a precedent for every state within the circuit. The ruling would have gone into effect on August 21, 2014 but the Supreme Court of the United States granted the stay request by the clerk of Prince William County. Attorneys for two same-sex couples had until August 18, 2014 to respond to the stay request.http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2014/08/roberts-sets- monday-deadline-for-response-in-va-marriage-stay-request/ The Fourth Circuit consists of Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia. Maryland was the first state in the circuit to enact gay marriage by legislative act and confirmed by a voter referendum. That occurred prior to the Fourth Circuit Court ruling that was denied review at the Supreme Court, which led to same-sex marriage expansion to Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina. North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper announced soon after the ruling that he would no longer defend NC's ban on same-sex unions in court, saying \\"Our office believes the judges in North Carolina are bound by this 4th Circuit decision,\\" he said. \\"In addition, the State of North Carolina will acknowledge the 4th Circuit opinion that marriage is a fundamental right.\\" On August 8, 2014, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring asked the United States Supreme Court to review the Fourth Circuit's decision. Even though Herring supports marriage for same-sex couples, he asked for review because \\"[t]he question presented is vital to a large population of same-sex couples, to their children, and to their fellow Americans who believe that discriminating against gay people is both unfair and unconstitutional. They may fairly call this 'the defining civil rights issue of our time.'\\" On October 6, 2014, the Supreme Court denied certiorari for the appeal, making the Fourth Circuit's decision final. Virginia promptly began solemnizing same-sex marriages. On November 20, 2014, the Supreme Court declined to issue a stay on a lower District Court ruling overturning South Carolina's same-sex marriage ban, removing all legal obstacles to same-sex marriage in South Carolina.

Mates. Overview Mates uses archival research and an analysis of local newspapers to offer an account of the effects of the Spanish Civil War on North East England. Though the North East did not historically have a significant radical left presence, it nonetheless saw a significant mobilisation in support of the Spanish Republic. Mates uses the case study of the North East to test assumptions about the British response to the Civil War, and argues that the popular front strategy pursued by the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) was inadequate and a distraction from the need to end the policy of non-intervention. He also contends with the \\"popular frontist\\" assumption that the popular front was the best means available for British people to support the Spanish Republic, instead arguing that direct action in the form of mass strikes would have been more successful in placing pressure on the British government to intervene. The popular front strategy, Mates writes, was \\"inimical to providing the Spanish Republic with what it needed to fight Franco\\". Critical reception Tom Buchanan, writing in The English Historical Review, questioned Mates's commentary on working-class Catholics' reactions to the Red Terror and the lack of the detail offered on topics including aid initiatives, but described the book as \\" a valuable addition to the burgeoning literature on Britain and the Spanish Civil War, and one that deserves to be read alongside‚Äîand as a corrective to‚Äîthe 'national' studies.\\" In History, Paul Corthorn questioned Mates's account of the influence of the \\"popular frontist\\" interpretation of events, but praised his engagement with Buchanan on the question of Catholics and described the book as \\"a carefully researched examination\\" with \\"much to commend it.\\" Julius Ruiz, in The Historical Journal, described The Spanish Civil War and the British Left as \\"a significant addition to the historiography\\" and praised Mates's discussion of the impact of the popular front strategy on the CPGB, but took issue with his belief that industrial action could have proved a better strategy or succeeded in changing government policy.

The first Soviet vehicle with front wheel drive, it was based on the LuAZ-967. Developing ideas from the unbuilt Moskvitch 415 prototype, designers used the LuAZ-967 as a basis for a four-wheel drive. vehicle They added a body to the LuAZ's bare form, and fitted a MeMZ 966 air-cooled four-cylinder engine. No other mechanical changes were made. A pre-production batch of fifty was created in 1965, dubbed ZAZ-969, and production was authorized in 1966 as the 969V. It was built by ZAZ until 1971, when LuAZ took over. Its pioneering (for a Soviet car) front wheel drive was due to a lack of drivable rear axles from the supplier, which was giving priority to the LuAZ-967. Nevertheless, the 969 performed well, with a weight of only (thanks in part to a soft top) and an wheelbase. The transmission was a four-speed. When LuAZ took over production (making it the LuAZ-969), four-wheel drive became standard. In 1975, the LuAZ-969A replaced the original 969, offering a new MeMZ 969 four-cylinder engine. It survived until 1979. This was followed by a hard-top panel van version in 1977, known as the 969F, with a payload, which was only built in small quantities. LuAZ began developing a replacement for the 969A in 1974, the 969M; it entered production in 1979. It was named Volin, for the region around Lutsk (where the factory was located). It retained the engine, but changed to disk brakes with servo assist. Door locks were added. Folding windshield was standard.

First, within a particular mathematical theory (for example, Euclidean geometry), a notion (for example, ellipse or minimal surface) may have more than one definition. These definitions are equivalent in the context of a given mathematical structure (Euclidean space, in this case). Second, a mathematical structure may have more than one definition (for example, topological space has at least seven definitions; ordered field has at least two definitions). In the former case, equivalence of two definitions means that a mathematical object (for example, geometric body) satisfies one definition if and only if it satisfies the other definition. In the latter case, the meaning of equivalence (between two definitions of a structure) is more complicated, since a structure is more abstract than an object. Many different objects may implement the same structure. Isomorphic implementations Natural numbers may be implemented as 0 = , 1 = = , 2 = = , 3 = = and so on; or alternatively as 0 = , 1 = =, 2 = = and so on. These are two different but isomorphic implementations of natural numbers in set theory. They are isomorphic as models of Peano axioms, that is, triples (N,0,S) where N is a set, 0 an element of N, and S (called the successor function) a map of N to itself (satisfying appropriate conditions). In the first implementation S(n) = n ‚à™ ; in the second implementation S(n) = . As emphasized in Benacerraf's identification problem, the two implementations differ in their answer to the question whether 0 ‚àà 2; however, this is not a legitimate question about natural numbers (since the relation ‚àà is not stipulated by the relevant signature(s), see the next section).Technically, \\"0 ‚àà 2\\" is an example of a non-transportable relation, see , . Similarly, different but isomorphic implementations are used for complex numbers. Deduced structures and cryptomorphisms The successor function S on natural numbers leads to arithmetic operations, addition and multiplication, and the total order, thus endowing N with an ordered semiring structure. This is an example of a deduced structure. The ordered semiring structure (N, +, ¬∑, ‚â§) is deduced from the Peano structure (N, 0, S) by the following procedure: n + 0 = n, m + S (n) = S (m + n), m ¬∑ 0 = 0, m ¬∑ S (n) = m + (m ¬∑ n), and m ‚â§ n if and only if there exists k ‚àà N such that m + k = n. And conversely, the Peano structure is deduced from the ordered semiring structure as follows: S (n) = n + 1, and 0 is defined by 0 + 0 = 0. It means that the two structures on N are equivalent by means of the two procedures. The two isomorphic implementations of natural numbers, mentioned in the previous section, are isomorphic as triples (N,0,S), that is, structures of the same signature (0,S) consisting of a constant symbol 0 and a unary function S. An ordered semiring structure (N, +, ¬∑, ‚â§) has another signature (+, ¬∑, ‚â§) consisting of two binary functions and one binary relation. The notion of isomorphism does not apply to structures of different signatures. In particular, a Peano structure cannot be isomorphic to an ordered semiring. However, an ordered semiring deduced from a Peano structure may be isomorphic to another ordered semiring. Such relation between structures of different signatures is sometimes called a cryptomorphism. Ambient frameworks A structure may be implemented within a set theory ZFC, or another set theory such as NBG, NFU, ETCS.About ETCS see Type theory#Mathematical foundations Alternatively, a structure may be treated in the framework of first-order logic, second-order logic, higher-order logic, a type theory, homotopy type theory etc.A reasonable choice of an ambient framework should not alter basic properties of a structure, but can alter provability of finer properties. For example, some theorems about the natural numbers are provable in set theory (and some other strong systems) but not provable in first-order logic; see Paris‚ÄìHarrington theorem and Goodstein's theorem. The same applies to definability; see for example Tarski's undefinability theorem. Structures according to Bourbaki :\\"Mathematics [...] cannot be explained completely by a single concept such as the mathematical structure. Nevertheless, Bourbaki's structuralist approach is the best that we have.\\" () :\\"Evident as the notion of mathematical structure may seem these days, it was at least not made explicit until the middle of the 20th century. Then it was the influence of the Bourbaki-project and then later the development of category theory which made the notion explicit\\" (nLab). According to Bourbaki, the scale of sets on a given set X consists of all sets arising from X by taking Cartesian products and power sets, in any combination, a finite number of times. Examples: X; X √ó X; P(X); P(P(X √ó X) √ó X √ó P(P(X))) √ó X. (Here A √ó B is the product of A and B, and P(A) is the powerset of A.) In particular, a pair (0,S) consisting of an element 0 ‚àà N and a unary function S : N ‚Üí N belongs to N √ó P(N √ó N) (since a function is a subset of the Cartesian product). A triple (+, ¬∑, ‚â§) consisting of two binary functions N √ó N ‚Üí N and one binary relation on N belongs to P(N √ó N √ó N) √ó P(N √ó N √ó N) √ó P(N √ó N). Similarly, every algebraic structure on a set belongs to the corresponding set in the scale of sets on X. Non-algebraic structures on a set X often involve sets of subsets of X (that is, subsets of P(X), in other words, elements of P(P(X))). For example, the structure of a topological space, called a topology on X, treated as the set of \\"open\\" sets; or the structure of a measurable space, treated as the œÉ-algebra of \\"measurable\\" sets; both are elements of P(P(X)). These are second-order structures. More complicated non-algebraic structures combine an algebraic component and a non- algebraic component. For example, the structure of a topological group consists of a topology and the structure of a group. Thus it belongs to the product of P(P(X)) and another (\\"algebraic\\") set in the scale; this product is again a set in the scale. =Transport of structures; isomorphism= Given two sets X, Y and a bijection f : X ‚Üí Y, one constructs the corresponding bijections between scale sets. Namely, the bijection X √ó X ‚Üí Y √ó Y sends (x1,x2) to (f(x1),f(x2)); the bijection P(X) ‚Üí P(Y) sends a subset A of X into its image f(A) in Y; and so on, recursively: a scale set being either product of scale sets or power set of a scale set, one of the two constructions applies. Let (X,U) and (Y,V) be two structures of the same signature. Then U belongs to a scale set SX, and V belongs to the corresponding scale set SY. Using the bijection F : SX ‚Üí SY constructed from a bijection f : X ‚Üí Y, one defines: : f is an isomorphism between (X,U) and (Y,V) if F(U) = V. This general notion of isomorphism generalizes many less general notions listed below. * For algebraic structures: isomorphism is a bijective homomorphism. * In particular, for vector spaces: linear bijection. * For partially ordered sets: order isomorphism. * For graphs: graph isomorphism. * More generally, for sets endowed with a binary relation: relation-preserving isomorphism. * For topological spaces: homeomorphism or topological isomorphism or bi continuous function. * For uniform spaces: uniform isomorphism. * For metric spaces: bijective isometry. * For topological groups: group isomorphism which is also a homeomorphism of the underlying topological spaces. * For topological vector spaces: isomorphism of vector spaces which is also a homeomorphism of the underlying topological spaces. * For Banach spaces: bijective linear isometry. * For Hilbert spaces: unitary transformation. * For Lie groups: a bijective smooth group homomorphism whose inverse is also a smooth group homomorphism. * For smooth manifolds: diffeomorphism. * For symplectic manifolds: symplectomorphism. * For Riemannian manifolds: isometric diffeomorphism. * For conformal spaces: conformal diffeomorphism. * For probability spaces: a bijective measurable and measure preserving map whose inverse is also measurable and measure preserving. * For affine spaces: bijective affine transformation. * For projective spaces: homography. In fact, Bourbaki stipulates two additional features. First, several sets X1, ..., Xn (so-called principal base sets) may be used, rather than a single set X. However, this feature is of little use. All the items listed above use a single principal base set. Second, so-called auxiliary base sets E1, ..., Em may be used. This feature is widely used. Indeed, the structure of a vector space stipulates not only addition X √ó X ‚Üí X but also scalar multiplication R √ó X ‚Üí X (if R is the field of scalars). Thus, R is an auxiliary base set (called also \\"external\\"). The scale of sets consists of all sets arising from all base sets (both principal and auxiliary) by taking Cartesian products and power sets. Still, the map f (possibly an isomorphism) acts on X only; auxiliary sets are endowed by identity maps. (However, the case of n principal sets leads to n maps.) =Functoriality= Several statements formulated by Bourbaki without mentioning categories can be reformulated readily in the language of category theory. First, some terminology. * The scale of sets is indexed by \\"echelon construction schemes\\", called also \\"types\\". One may think of, say, the set P(P(X √ó X) √ó X √ó P(P(X))) √ó X as a set X substituted into the formula \\"P(P(a √ó a) √ó a √ó P(P(a))) √ó a\\" for the variable a; this formula is the corresponding echelon construction scheme.In order to be more formal, Bourbaki encodes such formulas with sequences of ordered pairs of natural numbers. (This notion, defined for all structures, may be thought of as a generalization of the signature defined only for algebraic structures.)On one hand, it is possible to exclude the Cartesian products, treating a pair (x,y) as just the set {{x},{x,y}}. On the other hand, it is possible to include the set operation X,Y->YX (all functions from X to Y). \\"It is possible to simplify the matter by considering operations and functions as a special kind of relations (for example, a binary operation is a ternary relation). However, quite often, it is an advantage to have operations as a primitive concept.\\" * Let Set* denote the groupoid of sets and bijections. That is, the category whose objects are (all) sets, and morphisms are (all) bijections. Proposition. Each echelon construction scheme leads to a functor from Set* to itself. In particular, the permutation group of a set X acts on every scale set SX. In order to formulate one more proposition, the notion \\"species of structures\\" is needed, since echelon construction scheme gives only preliminary information on a structure. For example, commutative groups and (arbitrary) groups are two different species of the same echelon construction scheme. Another example: topological spaces and measurable spaces. They differ in the so-called axiom of the species. This axiom is the conjunction of all required properties, such as \\"multiplication is associative\\" for groups, or \\"the union of open sets is an open set\\" for topological spaces. * A species of structures consists of an echelon construction scheme and an axiom of the species. Proposition. Each species of structures leads to a functor from Set* to itself. Example. For the species of groups, the functor F maps a set X to the set F(X) of all group structures on X. For the species of topological spaces, the functor F maps a set X to the set F(X) of all topologies on X. The morphism F(f) : F(X) ‚Üí F(Y) corresponding to a bijection f : X ‚Üí Y is the transport of structures. Topologies on Y correspond bijectively to topologies on X. The same holds for group structures, etc. In particular, the set of all structures of a given species on a given set is invariant under the action of the permutation group on the corresponding scale set SX, and is a fixed point of the action of the group on another scale set P(SX). However, not all fixed points of this action correspond to species of structures.The set of all possible axioms of species is countable, while the set of all fixed points of the considered action may be uncountable. Tarski's \\"logical notions of higher order\\" are closer to the fixed points than to species of structures, see and references therefrom. Given two species, Bourbaki defines the notion \\"procedure of deduction\\" (of a structure of the second species from a structure of the first species). A pair of mutually inverse procedures of deduction leads to the notion \\"equivalent species\\". Example. The structure of a topological space may be defined as an open set topology or alternatively, a closed set topology. The two corresponding procedures of deduction coincide; each one replaces all given subsets of X with their complements. In this sense, these are two equivalent species. In the general definition of Bourbaki, deduction procedure may include a change of the principal base set(s), but this case is not treated here. In the language of category theory one have the following result. Proposition. Equivalence between two species of structures leads to a natural isomorphism between the corresponding functors. However, in general, not all natural isomorphisms between these functors correspond to equivalences between the species.The set of all possible deduction procedures is countable, while the set of all natural isomorphisms between the considered functors may be uncountable (see an example in Section #Canonical, not just natural). Mathematical practice :\\"We often do not distinguish structures that are isomorphic and often say that two structures are the same, up to isomorphism.\\" :\\"When studying structures we are interested only in their form, but when we prove their existence we need to construct them.\\" :'Mathematicians are of course used to identifying isomorphic structures in practice, but they generally do so by \\"abuse of notation\\", or some other informal device, knowing that the objects involved are not \\"really\\" identical.' (A radically better approach is expected; but for now, Summer 2014, the definitive book quoted above does not elaborate on structures.) In practice, one makes no distinction between equivalent species of structures. Usually, a text based on natural numbers (for example, the article \\"prime number\\") does not specify the used definition of natural numbers. Likewise, a text based on topological spaces (for example, the article \\"homotopy\\", or \\"inductive dimension\\") does not specify the used definition of a topological space. Thus, it is possible (and rather probable) that the reader and the author interpret the text differently, according to different definitions. Nevertheless, the communication is successful, which means that such different definitions may be thought of as equivalent. A person acquainted with topological spaces knows basic relations between neighborhoods, convergence, continuity, boundary, closure, interior, open sets, closed sets, and does not need to know that some of these notions are \\"primary\\", stipulated in the definition of a topological space, while others are \\"secondary\\", characterized in terms of \\"primary\\" notions. Moreover, knowing that subsets of a topological space are themselves topological spaces, as well as products of topological spaces, the person is able to construct some new topological spaces irrespective of the definition. Thus, in practice a topology on a set is treated like an abstract data type that provides all needed notions (and constructors) but hides the distinction between \\"primary\\" and \\"secondary\\" notions. The same applies to other kinds of mathematical structures. \\"Interestingly, the formalization of structures in set theory is a similar task as the formalization of structures for computers.\\" Canonical, not just natural As was mentioned, equivalence between two species of structures leads to a natural isomorphism between the corresponding functors. However, \\"natural\\" does not mean \\"canonical\\". A natural transformation is generally non-unique. Example. Consider again the two equivalent structures for natural numbers. One is the \\"Peano structure\\" (0,S), the other is the structure (+, ¬∑, ‚â§) of ordered semiring. If a set X is endowed by both structures then, on one hand, X = where S(an) = an+1 for all n and 0 = a0; and on the other hand, X = where bm+n = bm \\\\+ bn, bm¬∑n = bm ¬∑ bn, and bm ‚â§bn if and only if m ‚â§ n. Requiring that an = bn for all n one gets the canonical equivalence between the two structures. However, one may also require a0 = b1, a1 = b0, and an = bn for all n > 1, thus getting another, non-canonical, natural isomorphism. Moreover, every permutation of the index set leads to a natural isomorphism; they are uncountably many! Another example. A structure of a (simple) graph on a set V = of vertices may be described by means of its adjacency matrix, a (0,1)-matrix of size n√ón (with zeros on the diagonal). More generally, for arbitrary V an adjacency function on V √ó V may be used. The canonical equivalence is given by the rule: \\"1\\" means \\"connected\\" (with an edge), \\"0\\" means \\"not connected\\". However, another rule, \\"0\\" means \\"connected\\", \\"1\\" means \\"not\\", may be used, and leads to another, natural but not canonical, equivalence. In this example, canonicity is rather a matter of convention. But here is a worse case. Instead of \\"0\\" and \\"1\\" one may use, say, the two possible orientations of the plane R2 (\\"clockwise\\" and \\"counterclockwise\\"). It is difficult to choose a canonical rule in this case! \\"Natural\\" is a well-defined mathematical notion, but it does not ensure uniqueness. \\"Canonical\\" does, but generally is more or less conventional. A consistent choice of canonical equivalences is an inevitable component of equivalent definitions of mathematical structures.

He is known for his scholarly edition of the score of Handel's Messiah (1935), for his role in planning the Proms from 1945 to 1961, and for editing and presenting the weekly BBC programme Music Magazine from 1944 to 1973. Life and career Herbage was born in Woking, Surrey, the son of Walter Herbage, an official of Barclays Bank, and his wife Ruth Ann, n√©e Livingston. He was educated at the Royal Naval Colleges at Osborne and Dartmouth, after which he went to St John's College, Cambridge as a choral student. From 1923 to 1927 he worked in the theatre. For the Everyman Theatre, Hampstead, in 1923 he arranged and conducted Thomas Arne's ballad opera Love in a Village. The following year he became conductor and composer of incidental music at the Savoy Theatre, and in 1925 he was employed by the Liverpool Repertory Company. The turning point in his career came in 1927, when his father recommended him to Sir John Reith, director general of the newly constituted British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). After a few months working as an assistant of the BBC's London station, Herbage joined the staff of the music department, under the corporation's director of music, Percy Pitt. At the BBC, Herbage's role steadily increased in importance; he became known as the corporation's musicologist, unearthing forgotten manuscripts, correcting corrupt editions of scores and arranging period music for broadcast. For a broadcast of As You Like It in 1932 his arrangement of 17th-century music for viols, recorder and lute was praised in the press for its intelligence and beauty. In 1935, for the 250th anniversary of Handel's birth, he prepared a scholarly performing edition of Messiah based on a manuscript score given by the composer to the Foundling Hospital. The performance, conducted by Adrian Boult, Pitt's successor as director of music and also the founding conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, was a landmark in authentic performance style in Handel's music. Herbage was a member of the Royal Philharmonic Society's management committee, from 1940 until 1971. From 1940 to 1944 Herbage was Boult's second-in-command as assistant director of music, but he found himself better suited to building programmes than to being an administrator, and in 1944 he dropped his managerial role and returned to detailed programme planning. In 1946 he resigned from the full-time staff of the BBC, though remaining closely associated with the corporation as a freelance for the rest of his career. In that year he married a fellow-member of the music department, Anna Instone, daughter of Sir Samuel Instone. They became joint editors of the long-running weekly radio programme Music Magazine, which ran from 1944 to 1973. Herbage was the presenter throughout the run of 1,155 editions. As the end of the Second World War approached, and with Sir Henry Wood, the founding figure of the Proms dead, the BBC set up a committee to consider the future running of the concerts. Herbage was a member, and was charged with ensuring that the Proms were equally satisfactory as live concerts and as broadcasts. He discussed with the BBC programme planners what their needs were and then constructed programmes that would also appeal to audiences at the venue of the Proms, the Royal Albert Hall. William Glock, the BBC's controller of music, took on the planning of the Proms from 1960, and the last season planned by Herbage was that of 1961. Herbage published books on Bax, Sibelius and Baroque Music; he wrote sleeve notes for a number of recordings. He appeared as a \\"castaway\\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 17 May 1965. Herbage died at the age of 71. Instone survived him by two years. His papers, including his research notes on Arne and autograph and copyist's manuscripts by E. J. Moeran, are in the collection of the Britten-Pears Foundation.

He also hosts his own monthly radio show, Injection at DI.fm. UCast has gained global popularity over the years and received support from top artists like Tiesto, Armin van Buuren, Paul Oakenfold, Aly & Fila, M.I.K.E., Dash Berlin, Bobina, Sean Tyas, and many others. In 2010 with a Belarusian electronic duo Poonyk&Oxide; he launched his own record label LiftedSounds Records, specializes in uplifting and tech trance music. Life and musical career Originally from Minsk, Belarus, Alexei started discovering the world of electronic music in early 90s when he heard a tape containing various hard dance tracks of that time. But the strongest influence on establishing his musical preferences carried the famous How Much is the Fish from Scooter. His acquaintance with trance music began in 2005 from such DJs as George Acosta and Armin van Buuren. UCast took his first steps into music production in 2006/2007, and very soon released his single called Through Depth. During the next two years such tracks as Fuck The Global, Calipso, Metro, Hesperia, One Day were released. The most of them were supported by top trance artists and been played at Ti√´sto's Club Life, Paul van Dyk's Vonyc Sessions, Aly & Fila's Future Sound of Egypt, and have been played at their live performances as well. At the same time he started producing, UCast began DJing and his first success came in 2009, when he was playing at Godskitchen Belarus with Sander van Doorn. After that, he was hosting such famous events as Global Gathering, Trancemission, FSOE Anniversary. In 2013 his track Genesis was awarded as \\"The Tune Of The Week\\" in the radioshow A State Of Trance and Armin van Buuren's mashup UCast vs. MaRLo \\"Genesis Boom\\" has been played during his world tour show \\"ASOT 600.

It preserves fossils dating back to the Jurassic period.  History  The term was proposed by Gert Bloos, Gerd Dietl and G√ºnter Schweigert in 2005 for a lithostratigraphic rock formation. The name goes back to the term Impressakalke introduced by Friedrich August Quenstedt in 1857. The name is derived from the brachiopod Terebratula impressa (today Aulacothyris impressa ).  Definition and distribution area  The Impressamergel formation includes dark gray to light gray limestones with some embedded limestone beds. The lower limit is relatively well defined by the change in color (from \\"brown\\" to \\"white\\" Jura). The upper limit is formed by the onset of the limestone of the Wohlgeschichtete Kalk Formation . It meshes with the Lochen Formation especially in the higher part and is increasingly replaced by this formation. In the Upper Rhine Valley, it is represented by Kandern Formation , Korallenkalk Formation and Nerineenkalk Formation . The distribution of the Impressamergel formation extends over the entire Swabian Alb to the Wutach area.

His work was the subject of a monographic exhibition, Vestie Davis's New York, at the American Folk Art Museum, which ran for over a year beginning in autumn 2009. Life and work Born in Baltimore, Davis moved to New York City at the age of twenty-five in 1928, where he worked as a \\"circus barker, undertaker, newsstand operator, and church organist.\\" He lived in Bensonhurst. In 1947 he began painting, after a conversion experience looking in a gallery window on 57th Street. Davis explained: \\"One day in 1947 I was walking on 57th Street and came to a big gallery. I looked in, saw some pictures I liked, said to myself, 'I can paint like that.' So I walked into an artist's material store.\\" For a slightly different telling of this anecdote, see The New York Times obituary. Davis focused his art on New York City landmarks, which he depicted in a bright, broadly graphic style, densely peopled by cartoonish silhouettes. As the artist explained, \\"The more people I put in, the faster they (i.e. the pictures) sold.\\" Yet these multitudes are uniformly white, which has led Davis to be criticized for the unrealistic homogeneity of his art. A favorite subject was Nathan's hotdog stand in Coney Island, which Davis frequently painted, once with three hundred figures. Davis was represented by the Morris Gallery in Greenwich Village, after Morris Weisenthal was impressed by his work at a show on Washington Square in the 1950s. His work sold well, appealing to the public with its accessible subject matter and style (quite unlike esoteric Modernism). As Davis readily admitted, \\"I paint what people want, and they want what is familiar to them.\\" Fittingly, the painter of crowds was a crowd-pleaser. Davis died of cancer in New York City at the age of 75 in 1978. At the time of his death he was a celebrated figure, with his work included in Bicentennial celebrations two years earlier. He is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn.https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/nyregion/07greenwood.html?_r=0 Bibliography *Miller, Gloria Bley. \\"Vestie Davis, Brooklyn Painter, in his own Words: Interviews from 1961 to 1965,\\" in Folk Art, Summer 2003, pp. 40‚Äì51.

John Seymour Keay, 1892 caricature from Vanity Fair Life Born at Bathgate, Linlithgowshire, on 30 March 1839, was younger of the two sons of John Keay (died 15 July 1841), minister of the Church of Scotland, of Bathgate, by his wife Agnes Straiton (died 3 June 1864). Educated at Madras College, St. Andrews, Keay was apprenticed in 1856 to the Commercial Bank of Scotland, and in 1862 went to India to manage branches of the Government Bank of Bengal, which was recently started to develop the cotton trade between India and the UK. He next entered the service of Sir Salar Jung, minister of Hyderabad. After a successful public career Keay opened a private banking and mercantile business at Hyderabad, and founded the cotton spinning and weaving mills that became the Hyderabad (Deccan) Spinning and Weaving Co. Ltd.. He remained a director of the company until his death. After twenty years in India Keay returned to England in 1882, and busily engaged in both home and Indian politics. He sympathised with the Indian wish for a larger share in the government, and was a member of the British committee of the Indian National Congress. As an advanced Liberal, Keay unsuccessfully contested at the general election in February 1886, but he won a seat at the by-election for on 8 October 1889. Keay constantly intervened in the debates on the land purchase bill of 1890, concerning which he published an elaborate Exposure, and won the reputation of a bore. He was re-elected at the general election of 1892, but was defeated after a close contest in that of July 1895; and was again unsuccessful at in January 1906. Keay had a country residence at Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire, and was president of the Stroud Liberal club. He died on 27 June 1909 aged 70 at his London residence, 44 Bassett Road, North Kensington, and his remains were cremated at Golder's Green. Works In a long treatise Spoiling the Egyptians, a Tale of Shame told from the Blue Books (1882, three editions) Keay protested the British invasion and occupation of Egypt in 1882. His views were echoed by British radicals. In The Great Imperial Danger: an Impossible War in the near Future (1887) he deprecated the fear of war with Russia, and discussed the Afghan frontier question. He attacked tariff reformers in The Fraud of the Protection Cry (1906). Family Keay married on 22 October 1878 Nina, second daughter of William Came Vivian of Penzance. She died on 16 January 1885, leaving two daughters.

He was especially known for portraits and female figures.  Life and work  He was member of the Cluysenaar family, descendant from a long line of architects who originated in Aachen, where the family name was spelled \\"Klausener\\". Perhaps the best-known among these was his grandfather Jean- Pierre Cluysenaar. His wife, Alice Gordon, was related to Lord Byron. He received his first art lessons from his father, then studied with Fran√ßois- Joseph Navez. Initially, he worked as a sculptor, but devoted himself entirely to painting after 1902. He was firmly grounded in the romantic style at first; producing still lifes and genre scenes, but later turned to impressionism and painted mostly female figures, often semi-nude. He also executed monumental ceiling paintings for the City Hall in Saint-Gilles. During World War I, he lived in London where he established a reputation painting portraits of notable people, including the Royal Family, which were done in a more commercial style using Alfred Stevens as a model.

He took charge when the activity of Sericulture, Handloom and Handicraft was dying in the state and the annual production of the sericulture in 2006-07 was only 90 metric ton. With his strong Endeavour and hard work, within a 5-year time frame the production of Tassar silk rose to 1025 metric ton, which was more than 10 times and thus Jharkhand has become the leading producer of Tassar Silk in the country and also got the Organic Certification in Tassar Silk. As the silk is cultivated in Arjun and Asan trees in the forest areas, his initiative has also become a major factor in forest conservation. Dhirendra Kumar receiving award from Virendra Kataria, then Lieutenant Governor Puducherry, India. He not only revived the handloom societies and formed many SHG but Under his leadership, Jharcraft also has given the livelihood Training to more than 3.47 lac people which includes the training of the Sericulture, Handloom and Handicraft.

Background The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) is an independent federal agency of the United States government responsible for supervising all U.S. government- supported, civilian international media. The mission of the BBG is \\"to inform, engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democracy.\\" The agency's goal is to \\"deliver accurate news and information to significant and strategic audiences overseas... and to serve as a trustworthy source of news and as an example of a free, professional press in countries that lack independent media.\\" According to a series of reports beginning in 2004 and generated by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the BBG has struggled to live up to its mission. For instance, GAO highlighted a structural issue of the BBG in a 2004 report claiming that \\"organizationally, the existence of five separate broadcast entities has led to overlapping language services, duplication of program content, redundant newsgathering and support services, and difficulties coordinating broadcast efforts.\\" The report also added that \\"marketing challenges include outmoded program formats, poor signal delivery, and low audience awareness in many markets.\\" Employees at the Broadcasting Board of Governors were consistently rated as having the lowest personnel morale in the federal government by the Office of Management and Budget. Due to cuts in broadcasting to Ukraine and Russia, the United States could not broadcast into Crimea during the 2014 Crimean crisis. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The United States International Communications Reform Act of 2014 would revise U.S. international broadcasting and communications structures, missions, and objectives. The bill would repeal the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994, and amends the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948. The bill would replace the Broadcasting Board of Governors with the United States International Communications Agency, and establishes in the Agency a Board of Directors and a Chief Executive Officer. The bill would express the sense of Congress that the Voice of America (VOA): (1) has been an indispensable element of U.S. foreign policy and public diplomacy efforts and should remain the flagship brand of the Agency; and (2) would benefit from a recalibration of federal international broadcasting agencies and resources which would provide it with greater mission focus and flexibility. The bill would express the sense of Congress that RFE/RL, Incorporated, Radio Free Asia, and the Middle East Broadcasting Network share a common mission with distinct geographic foci, and should therefore be merged into a single organization with distinct marketing brands to provide news and related programming and content in countries where free media are not established. The bill would consolidate RFE/RL Incorporated, Radio Free Asia, and the Middle East Broadcasting Network into the (non-federal agency) Freedom News Network. The bill would state that RFE/RL, Incorporated, Radio Free Asia, and the Middle East Broadcasting Network shall remain brand names under which news and related programming and content may be disseminated by the Network. The bill would set forth Agency, VOA, and Network requirements regarding: (1) duties and authorities, (2) programming and policy objectives, (3) administration and reporting, and (4) coordination. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on April 30, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4490 would make several changes to U.S. non-military international broadcasting and would permanently authorize appropriations for that purpose. It would consolidate into two separate entities the federal and nonfederal entities currently providing such broadcasting, amend the principles and mission underlying international broadcasting, and place restrictions on hiring personnel at the consolidated federal entity. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 4490 would cost $3.7 billion over the 2015-2019 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. Pay-as-you-go procedures apply to this legislation because it would affect direct spending; however, CBO estimates that those effects would not be significant. Enacting the bill would not affect revenues. H.R. 4490 contains no intergovernmental or private- sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The United States International Communications Reform Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on April 28, 2014, by Rep. Edward R. Royce (R, CA-39). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, which voted unanimously on April 30, 2014, to approve the bill. On July 18, 2014, the bill was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-541.House Report 113-541 The House voted on July 28, 2014, to pass the bill in a voice vote. Debate and discussion Supporters of the bill expressed concern that if Congress did not take the chance now to reform the Board, Congress would end up giving up and ending the program. A The Washington Post editorial board editorial accused the bill of taking \\"a dangerous step toward converting the most venerable and listened-to U.S. outlet, Voice of America, into another official mouthpiece.\\" The editorial board expressed their concern that Voice of America (VOA) would lose its independent voice, but supported the reorganization of VOA and the related news groups. In a reply, Rep. Ed Royce argued that \\"the real 'dangerous step' would be to do nothing\\" to address the problems the BBG is facing.

It belongs to the Diocese of Stockholm. It is a listed building, protected by law. History and architecture Construction of the church started in the 12th century, and it was expanded during the 14th and 15th centuries. In 1487, the interior of the church was decorated with frescos by Albertus Pictor. During Catholic times, the church was dedicated to Saint Olaf. Reconstruction works were carried out in 1768. The tower was made higher, the windows enlarged and several medieval elements removed. The frescos were covered with whitewash. Architect Jean Eric Rehn designed parts of the new interior elements, notably the pulpit. The reconstruction was supported by Charles De Geer, who also supported reconstruction works at nearby Hammarby and Fresta churches. The external similarities between Fresta and Ed churches are striking. A renovation was made in 1917-18 by architect Sigurd Curman, who at the time lived in the parish. He uncovered the medieval frescos and commissioned artist Olle Hjortzberg to make additional frescos for the 18th- century vaults. Hjortzberg also designed the new stained glass windows.

He was the leading founder of an important group devoted to collecting posters which started an influential poster magazine. Before the seizure of his collection of 12,500 posters during Kristallnacht on 9 November 1938, he had the largest collection of posters in Germany, probably in the world. He was able to escape to the United States, but he never regained possession of the posters. After years of court battles, 4344 posters were returned to his son in 2013. Some will be given to museums, but most have been or will be sold at auction. His life in Germany Hans Josef Sachs was born in Breslau, Germany, now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland, on August 11, 1881. He began collecting posters when he was only 16, possibly inspired by a gift to his father of three life-size prints of Sarah Bernhardt signed by Alphonse Mucha. In 1903-4 he served a year in the army, and again for some months in 1914-15. He was educated as a chemist, receiving his doctorate in 1904 in chemistry, physics, and mathematics; and then another in dentistry. He then interned for six months in the United States. He was married for the first time in 1910. While he was successful as a dentist, with Albert Einstein among his patients, and wrote a number of standard works on periodontosis, his avocation was posters. He regularly worked from three o'clock in the afternoon into the night on his passion, making a detailed index card for each poster, each of which was identified by a numbered label. His poster collection grew, and in 1905 he was one of the principal founders and then the president of the Verein der Plakatfreunde (Society of Poster Friends), which soon had regional chapters. In 1910 it founded a quarterly Das Plakat (The Poster), with Sachs as both editor and publisher. Das Plakat special issue on The Movie, October 1920; cover by Paul Leni The purpose of Das Plakat was to promote poster art, for both collectors and scholars. While there were a number of magazines devoted to posters, of Das Plakat it was said \\"And the clarion of this German poster exuberance was a magazine called Das Plakat, which not only exhibited the finest poster examples from Germany and other European countries, but its high standards underscored its exquisite printing, established qualitative criteria that defined the decade of graphic design between 1910 and 1920.\\" Moreover, \\"given its focus on conventional and avant garde sensibilities (it) emerged as a more historically influential review than any of the others\\". During its short life from 1910 to 1921, its circulation grew from 200 to over 10,000. The Verein der Plakatfreunde ended a year later. It is unclear why the poster group and its magazine ended, possibly because of conflicts between collectors, art lovers, commercial artists, and business. After the war, he was appointed to a panel charged with selecting designs for postage stamps for the new Weimar Republic, and to the board of film censorship. After the end of the group, he lost all interest in posters for two years. Then a fire broke out in his house in the room where they were kept, but the thick walls of their storage cabinets insulated the posters from damage. He hired a famous architect, Oskar Kaufmann, to design a small museum, a special room in his house to hold and display his posters. The room was almost finished when another fire broke out. It was rebuilt by the middle of 1926. Two years later, he moved, and rebuilt the museum in the new house. His love for the collection revived, and he added many new posters, worked on its catalog, and arranged lectures. The poster collection The collection was not narrowly focused. Its 12,500 posters included works by world-famous artists such as Pierre Bonnard, Wassily Kandinsky, K√§the Kollwitz, Edvard Munch , and 31 of the 35 posters designed by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. There were posters by the Viennese Secessionists Gustav Klimt, Koloman Moser, Joseph Maria Olbrich, and the Munich Secessionist Franz Stuck; and Art Nouveau and Jugenstil posters by Aubrey Beardsley, Thomas Theodor Heine, Alphonse Mucha, and Henry van de Velde. Famous Plakatstil (Posterstyle) artists included , Hans Rudi Erdt, Julius Gipkens, Ludwig Hohlwein, Julius Klinger, Hans Lindenstadt, ,, and . Others were by Continental leaders in graphic design and posters Lucian Bernhard, Jules Ch√©ret, Max Pechstein, Th√©ophile Steinlen, and F√©lix Vallotton, joined with works by famous American artists James Montgomery Flagg, Charles Dana Gibson, Maxfield Parrish, and Edward Penfield. Arrest, escape from Germany and life in America On 9 November 1938, Kristallnacht, he was arrested and sent to the Sachsenhausen-Oranienburg concentration camp. The collection was stolen by order of Joseph Goebbels, who wanted them for a proposed new wing devoted to business art in the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin (Museum of Decorative Arts). After 17 days in the concentration camp, Sachs was released, and with his second wife Felicia and their one-year-old son Peter were able to escape from Germany, first to London for a few days, and then to New York. From his former collection he was able to take with him only the 31 posters by Toulouse-Lautrec, which he later sold in America. Despite a recommendation from his former patient in Berlin, Albert Einstein, that he was well qualified to practice dentistry, he had to return to school, getting a second doctorate in dentistry from the Harvard School of Dental Medicine in 1941. Label affixed to the Karen Zabel poster (see poster image in Commons) In the 1950s, he was told by the West German government that the posters had been destroyed by the Russians. In 1961 he accepted compensation of about 225,000 marks, then about $25,000. But in 1966, many were rediscovered in East Berlin, in the basement of the Deutsches Historisches Museum (German Historical Museum). Sachs's posters were identified by his label affixed to the back. Although Sachs flew to Berlin in 1974, he was not allowed to enter East Berlin. He died that year on March 21 without seeing his posters again. Later history After seven years in the courts, in February, 2009 Hans Sachs's son Peter was ruled to be the lawful owner of 4344 posters, but it was not until 2013 that they were released. Guernsey's auction house in New York held sales in January and November, 2013, and will hold a third on a date not yet announced. Buyers included the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Peter Sachs died on September, 2013. References 13\\\\. Martijn F.

Posted in Chandigarh, he now trains at Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports . He says that 2011 was the year when he was offered this prestigious job and it was the \\"turning point of his life\\". = Early Life = Born in Patnoun, Himachal Pradesh to Sh. Brij Lal Thakur, who works in Indian Railways and mother, Smt. Asha Devi, who is a housemaker. He has one sister, Abhilasha, who is married and lives in New Delhi. He was a naughty kid when he was studying in SDP Model Senior Secondary School in Ludhiana, Punjab, where he was brought up. This was the reason his father encouraged him to start wrestling but things didn't go according to the plan as he got an ear fractured in the beginning days of his training. All this while, he noticed the weightlifters in the gym, and at the early age of 8, he started training at the Ludhiana Weightlifting Club in 2001. As he was too young to participate in any competitions, his wait was finally over in 2006 when he took part in his first official weightlifting event. His first 5 years involved building a foundation and observing seniors, because, in his own words, \\"your basics go a long way\\". = Career = 2008 was the year when he started getting recognition in his school years after he won his first U-17 National School event medal held in Patiala, Punjab. His next success came in 2009 in New Delhi at another National School event for the U-19 team. Another School National event in 2010 in Maharashtra which won him the nation's \\"Best Weightlifter\\" award. This event was a blessing for his career as he won a gold medal after setting a new National Record 114 in Snatch, 140 in Clean, and 154 in Total. This success saw him move to Junior National Camp, Bangalore in 2010 when he started preparing for International Events. He won a silver medal at the Junior Asian Championship in Thailand in 2011. This achievement saw him earning a job as Air Man in the Indian Air Force that changed his life. He, then, moved to Chandigarh Academy for his further training under the guidance of coach Sardar B.S. Medhawan who made a big transformation in his game. This transformation changed his weight category from 77 kg to 85 kg and as a result, he got the gold for Indian Air Force in 2013 National games held in Uttar Pradesh. This was a big achievement that was made even bigger as he was the first serving Indian Air Force serviceman to achieve such a feat. He moved to Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports, Patiala, in 2013 after his National Championship achievement. Here, he was trained by Mr Vijay Sharma, who prepared him for the next big event, The Commonwealth Games, Glasgow held in 2014. He didn't let anyone down as he won a silver medal, which is his biggest achievement. He got all the due recognition after this incredible accomplishment. In 2018, he won a bronze medal at The Gold Coast Commonwealth games, which has been recognized as an achievement of consistency which is rare in weightlifting. = Achievements = Vikas currently holds the national record for Snatch in the 94 kg weight category at 155kg and 196 kg for Clean Jerk. His current best is 159 kgs Snatch & 200 kg Clean Jerk. His 85kg weight national record for 187 Clean and Jerk was broken by R.V.

It flows in a hairpin-shaped course from uplands in the town of Canandaigua to the lake, in the eponymous city. The name comes from the white sucker fish abundant in its waters. It may have originally drained into another body of water prior to the formation of the lake, which changed its outlet through stream piracy. Lime dissolved in its waters from the limestone bedrock it flows over creates rare oncolites known locally as \\"water biscuits' on the north shore of Squaw Island, one of two islands in the 11 Finger Lakes, near its mouth. The brook has seen some pollution issues in recent years, as the channel at its mouth has been widened to increase recreational opportunities available in the area. Course Sucker Brook rises in a wooded area southeast of the intersection of Bliss and Wool House roads in the Town of Canandaigua, in the uplands 1.5 miles (3 km) west of the lake, above sea level. It flows northwesterly at first, crossing under Bliss amid large expanses of cultivated land. It bends north and then northeast at a smaller wooded area with two farm ponds, following the slope of the land. Following channels between fields and receiving the runoff from those fields through even smaller channels between them, the stream trends more to the east. After crossing under Hickox Road its banks become noticeably forested as it enters another large wooded wetland where it receives an unnamed tributary from the east. The combined stream then flows north, under Bristol Road (Ontario County Route 32). From there it descends more sharply again, losing of elevation by the time it reaches its next crossing, Buffalo Road (New York State Route 5 and U.S. Route 20). The channel continues to be lined with trees, its irregular course forming the boundaries of the fields it passes through. After its next crossing, Buffalo Street Extension, it curves more to the northeast again, then northwest, briefly returning to the northeast just before it goes under North Bloomfield Road (County Route 30). This costs the stream another of elevation. Here Sucker Brook makes its most significant change of direction. It turns to the east, then bends southeast, paralleling the bases of some nearby hills to the south, and crosses under North Bloomfield a second time. Then it flows almost straight southwest, closely paralleling the western boundary of the City of Canandaigua, recrossing Buffalo Street Extension in the process. At Woodlawn Cemetery, it turns eastward again, following around the base of Arsenal Hill and entering the city. It turns southeast and straightens out as it crosses several streets, recrosses Routes 5 and 20 and then drains into Canandaigua Lake just west of the city pier. From West Avenue on the stream channel shows signs of having been modified. At Parrish Street it becomes wider, accommodating boat slips on either side, and its mouth has been dredged. Natural history The brook takes its name from the white sucker fish, which enter it from the lake in April and May to spawn. They have been observed as far upstream from the lake as Woodlawn Cemetery's raceways. The eggs hatch 5‚Äì10 days after spawning, and when the fry have matured, they return to the lake. Their presence is not an indicator of the stream's environmental health, as they can tolerate poor- quality water but will also spawn in pristine water.Makarewicz et al, 12. They are primarily bottom feeders, with the fry living off microcrustaceans, algae, and rotifers while the adults prefer larger crustaceans, insects, and snails. A survey of the brook's fishery was scheduled to be done in 2000. Other fauna found in the creek include dragonfly and crane fly larvae. Geology Most of the brook's watershed is underlain by limestone and shale bedrock that dips gently southward. Soil is mostly glacial till. Near the mouth, in the city, Sucker Brook flows through areas of silt and clay loams.Makarewicz et al, 9. The stream's abrupt change of course back towards the lake suggests that it arose prior to the formation of the lake after the last Ice Age, flowing into another stream or body of water, until stream piracy changed its course to drain into the newly formed lake.Makarewicz et al, 11. The interaction of the brook's outflow and the lake's counterclockwise shore currents has created Squaw Island a short distance offshore from its mouth, from deposited sediments. It is one of two islands in the 11 Finger Lakes, along with Frontenac Island off Union Springs in Cayuga Lake. Lime dissolved in the water from the bedrock has interacted with algae growing in the water to create a rare phenomenon called oncolites, small flat lime saucers around a pebble or gravel substrate known locally as \\"water biscuits\\". Research into them led the state to formally protect the island in 1918; today the state Department of Environmental Conservation lists it as a Unique Area. Hydrology In 1999 three researchers from the State University of New York at Brockport surveyed the brook and its waters to see how polluted it might be, as neighbors of the brook in the city had been complaining about how dirty it was for some time. There is little significant industry in the watershed, but much of the land surrounding the upper section of the brook is farmed. In the past, while some spills into the creek have been of fuels, most have been waste products from winemaking, the region's signature industry.Makarewicz et al, 15‚Äì18. Dissolved road salt also washed into the creek from the town's highway garage, driving up chloride levels in the water. Untreated waste from livestock washed into the creek's headwaters, giving Sucker Brook the highest fecal coliform counts of any of the lake's tributaries. The researchers recommended methods of controlling the pollution. They noted that road salt was used at a much higher rate in the Sucker Brook subwatershed than anywhere else near the lake, and that the town's salt supplies were not protected from running off into the brook. The high coliform levels, far higher than that permitted for recreational human contact, in the section that flowed through the city suggested that some sanitary sewers had been connected to the city's storm drains, a probability they called on the city to investigate.Makarewicz et al, 26‚Äì31. Ten years later two of the researchers published a report on efforts to follow up on their recommendations. The town and city had coordinated their efforts along with the Ontario County Soil and Water Conservation District. A barn had been built to house the town's road salt, and the city had made some major improvements in its sewer systems. The researchers noted that there had been some reduction in chloride levels, but no more than 8%. They speculated that the high chrloride levels might be the result of decayed coliforms, suggesting despite limited data that more might need to be done.

The school was established in 1996. Its curriculum is based upon the Mizoram Board of School Education the governing body in education within the state of Mizoram. The high school section was recognized by the Board in the year 2010. The school also has its own hostel with limited seats for the students of both genders. Other than the annual Board Examination the students from the school participate in many activities like the Science Congress, Science Exhibitions, Science Seminar. and so on. The school also hosts an annual cultural program during the month of December. History Bethel Mission School was established in the year 1996 by R. Vanhnuaithanga at Bethel Veng Champhai with classes ranging from Nursery to Class VII. At that time, there were only about 160 students, the majority of whom were from the locality itself. At that time Class VII annual examination was a Board Examination, where candidates from all over the state of Mizoram competed. In 2001 the ownership of the school was transferred to K. Malsawmdawngi who then became the Principal and remains so till date. In 2004, Class VIII was introduced and in the subsequent years classes IX and X were also added. The School also changed its location in 2005 to its current location with entirely new infrastructure. Since its inception, the school has had residential boarding facilities for both genders located nearby the school itself. As of 2014 there are 420 students of which 62 are Hostel boarders. Location School from the south-west. The school is located at the northern edge of the town of Champhai which is in the state of Mizoram in India. The name of the neighborhood is Bethel Veng from which the name of the school is derived. The school is located about 1678 m above the mean sea level. The school is connected by a terminal asphalt road to the center of the town which is further connected by both the State Highway and Helicopter Service. Infrastructure The School infrastructure includes the main school building, office, a multi - sports ground, where both volleyball and basketball can be played, a Science laboratory, a jam room for studying and playing music and two separate buildings for boys' and girls' hostel. Facilities Students, illustrating the school uniform. Primarily the school has twelve regular classrooms and one digital classroom. The science laboratory is equipped with all the required apparatus and chemicals as per the curriculum. Co-curricular Activities of both Sports and Cultural items are endorsed by the institute which organize an annual sports event sometime during the month of April or May and a Cultural show and competition during the month of December. Though it is a secular institute, Christianity is the dominant religion. The Digital Classroom was introduced in 2013 provided by Next Education with interactive class and lectures from the elementary level to the High School level. Results As per the policy of the Board classes from Nursery to VIII follow the pattern of CCE Scheme at which the school excels. Since its appearance in the Board Examination in 2008, the HSLC candidates so far have achieved 100% result till date. Only in 2011 did the school not have any students who graduated with distinction. Faculty The faculty consists of four teachers who teach from Nursery to Class - II. From class III there are separate teachers for each different subject. The high school section employs graduate and post graduate teachers in Literature, Science, Mathematics and Social Science. As of 2017 there are 16 teaching staff members of which two also serve as Hostel Warden Demographics of students The age of the students range from five to sixteen. Of the total students 99.9% are indigenous tribes and sub - tribes of Mizoram, the Mizo. The remaining fraction comprise students from other parts of India who are mainly in the General category. Many students from the neighbouring Chin State of Myanmar also study in the school who are also of the same stock. However, all students and teachers practice Christianity as their official religion. Hostel The school is equipped with 70 seater Boys and Girls' Hostels situated on the south east side of the institute. At present it has two buildings separate for each of the sexes. Two male wardens for the boys section and one female warden for girls are currently employed. Though not mandatory, most of the HSLC candidates reside in the hostel every year.

Schaefer (formerly Bostic v. McDonnell and Bostic v. Rainey) is a lawsuit filed in federal court in July 2013 that challenged Virginia's refusal to sanction same-sex marriages. The plaintiffs won in U.S. district court in February 2014, and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling in July 2014. On August 20, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed enforcement of the Fourth Circuit's ruling pending the outcome of further litigation. State officials refused to defend the state's constitutional and statutory bans on same-sex marriage. On October 6, 2014, the Supreme Court denied a writ of certiorari to the case, letting the circuit court decision stand.Order List 10/06/14, https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/100614zor.pdf, pg 39 Lawsuit On July 18, 2013, Timothy Bostic and Tony London, two gay men living in Norfolk, who had been in a committed relationship since 1989, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia challenging the state's ban on same-sex marriage. The suit was filed by attorneys Erik Porcaro, Robert Ruloff, Thomas Shuttleworth and Charles Lustig on behalf of Tim Bostic and Tony London. It named Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell as the principal defendant. After McDonnell left office in January 2014, the case was restyled as Bostic v. Rainey, with Janet Rainey, the state registrar of vital records, as lead defendant. A lesbian couple, Carol Schall and Mary Townley, married in California and parents of a teenager, joined the case as plaintiffs. On September 30, the American Foundation for Equal Rights attorneys Theodore Olson and David Boies joined the plaintiffs' legal team. The Norfolk Circuit Court Clerk (Schaefer) was represented by attorneys David Oakley and Jeffrey Brooke of the law firm Poole Brooke Plumlee PC in their roles as special counsel for the Attorney General's Office. On January 23, 2014, less than two weeks after taking office, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring announced that his office would no longer defend the state in Bostic and would argue for the plaintiffs instead. Governor Terry McAuliffe supported him. Judge Arenda L. Wright Allen heard oral arguments on February 4, 2014, with attorneys for the Clerk of the Circuit Court for the City of Norfolk defending the state's ban on same-sex marriage. District court ruling On February 13, Judge Wright Allen ruled that Virginia's statutory and constitutional ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional, Bostic v. Rainey, 970 F. Supp. 2d 456 (E.D. Va. 2014). She held that marriage is a fundamental right, that a limitation on the right to marry is therefore subject to strict scrutiny, meaning that \\"compelling state interests\\" are required to justify it. She found that Virginia's arguments in support of its ban on same-sex marriage failed to meet that standard of review, and that they did not even pass rational basis review, the least demanding judicial standard.Bostic v. Rainey, February 13, 2014, accessed February 25, 2014 She stayed enforcement of her ruling pending appeal as the state had requested. The decision at the time \\"represented the strongest advance in the South for advocates of gay marriage.\\" In her decision, she cited Loving v. Virginia, the case which ended bans on interracial marriage nationwide, which was also filed in the Eastern District of Virginia. Court of Appeals action On March 10, 2014, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the couples in another case, Harris v. McDonnell, represented by Lambda Legal and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), to intervene in Bostic. The attorneys who filed the appeal in Bostic had opposed allowing them to intervene. The court set a briefing schedule for the case, now styled as Bostic v. Schaefer and docketed as case number 14-1167, to be completed by April 30, with arguments held on May 13, 2014. Arguments in the Fourth Circuit were held before Circuit Judges Roger L. Gregory, Paul V. Niemeyer, and Henry F. Floyd, and was characterized as \\"sharply divided,\\" with the first two judges having vast differences in opinion on the case. The third judge, Floyd, stayed on the sidelines. Niemeyer maintained that the fundamental right to marriage, as recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court, is that of a \\"union of husband and wife,\\" Of same-sex relationships and unions, he said: \\"It doesn't work biologically,\\" and calling it marriage is to \\"play with the language.\\" In complete contrast, Gregory questioned: \\"Why do you want to deny [children] all these warm and wholesome things about marriage? ... You think the child loves these parents any less because they are same-sex parents?\\" and demanded the defending lawyer to answer. Ultimately, Gregory viewed the case as a \\"way station\\" to the Supreme Court, Niemeyer noted \\"Maybe we should just say, 'We pass,' and let the case go on,\\" and Floyd seeing the Windsor case as dealing with the principle of federalism. Court of Appeals ruling On July 28, 2014, the Fourth Circuit ruled 2‚Äì1 that Virginia's ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional, affirming the district court. Judge Henry Floyd, who was described as the neutral party in the \\"sharply divided\\" arguments as noted above, wrote the majority opinion. The majority conclusion is that \\"Virginia's same-sex marriage bans impermissibly infringe on its citizens' fundamental right to marry\\". =Standing= In the ruling, the majority first has to tackle the issue of standing: \\"Schaefer premises his argument that the Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their claims on the idea that every plaintiff must have standing as to every defendant. However, the Supreme Court has made it clear that 'the presence of one party with standing is sufficient to satisfy Article III's case-or-controversy requirement.'\\" As one couple was refused marriage licenses, that \\"license denial constitutes an injury for standing purposes.\\" As for the second couple, who was legally married in California but did not seek a license, the court finds standing as well, in two ways: (internal quotes and citations omitted) As to the merits of the case, the majority first has to overcome the presumption that Baker v. Nelson controls the case. Noting that \\"[e]very federal court to consider this issue since the Supreme Court decided United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013), has reached the same conclusion\\", the majority lists the cases and decides that doctrinal developments since have eroded the \\"binding force\\" that a summary dismissal such as Baker has. The majority lists several major equal protection decisions since Baker, such as Craig v. Boren, Romer v. Evans, and Windsor itself. =Level of scrutiny= As to defendants' Fourteenth Amendment claims, the majority decides what level of constitutional scrutiny to apply: \\"Under both the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, interference with a fundamental right warrants the application of strict scrutiny.\\" It notes that the opponents and proponents of Virginia's ban both agree that marriage is such a right, but they disagree as to whether \\"same-sex marriage\\" is included. Noting Loving v. Virginia, Zablocki v. Redhail, and Turner v. Safley the majority states: \\"Over the decades, the Supreme Court has demonstrated that the right to marry is an expansive liberty interest that may stretch to accommodate changing societal norms. ... These cases do not define the rights in question as 'the right to interracial marriage,' 'the right of people owing child support to marry,' and 'the right of prison inmates to marry.' Instead, they speak of a broad right to marry that is not circumscribed based on the characteristics of the individuals seeking to exercise that right.\\" =Analysis under strict scrutiny= Finding that the fundamental right to marriage is inclusive of same-sex marriage, the majority goes on to strict scrutiny analysis. The state makes several arguments related to justifying the ban: \\"(1) Virginia's federalism-based interest in maintaining control over the definition of marriage within its borders, (2) the history and tradition of opposite-sex marriage, (3) protecting the institution of marriage, (4) encouraging responsible procreation, and (5) promoting the optimal childrearing environment.\\" As to the first argument, and citing Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, the state notes that Virginia voters have the right to determine what marriage is. The majority counters with the reasoning that \\"the people's will is not an independent compelling interest that warrants depriving same-sex couples of their fundamental right to marry,\\" and goes on to cite West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette: As to the second argument, the majority responds citing Heller v. Doe ex rel. Doe: \\"The Supreme Court has made it clear that, even under rational basis review, the '[a]ncient lineage of a legal concept does not give it immunity from attack.'\\" In dismissing the third and fourth arguments, the majority finds that the Supreme Court severed the link between marriage and children and upheld a right not to procreate in Griswold v. Connecticut: It also states: \\"If Virginia sought to ensure responsible procreation via the [same-sex marriage ban], the laws are woefully underinclusive. Same-sex couples are not the only category of couples who cannot reproduce accidentally. For example, opposite-sex couples cannot procreate unintentionally if they include a post- menopausal woman or an individual with a medical condition that prevents unassisted conception.... We therefore reject ... attempts to differentiate same-sex couples from other couples who cannot procreate accidentally. Because same-sex couples and infertile opposite-sex couples are similarly situated, the Equal Protection Clause counsels against treating these groups differently.\\" Also, the \\"responsible procreation argument falters for another reason as well. Strict scrutiny requires that a state's means further its compelling interest. ... Prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying and ignoring their out-of-state marriages does not serve Virginia's goal of preventing out-of-wedlock births. Although same-sex couples cannot procreate accidentally, they can and do have children via other methods.\\" Finally, on the optimal childrearing argument, the majority finds that the same-sex couples' and their amici supporters' arguments on that issue are \\"extremely persuasive.\\" However, the majority needs not resolve the dispute, as first, in United States v. Virginia, it finds that \\"under heightened scrutiny, states cannot support a law using overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of the groups in question\\" (internal quotes omitted), and second, \\"strict scrutiny requires congruity between a law's means and its end. This congruity is absent here. There is absolutely no reason to suspect that prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying and refusing to recognize their out-of-state marriages will cause same-sex couples to raise fewer children or impel married opposite-sex couples to raise more children.\\" =Conclusion= The majority concluded: =Dissent= Circuit Judge Niemeyer dissented from the ruling. Citing Washington v. Glucksberg, he rejected the majority's reasoning: In Niemeyer's view, the correct course of action would be to reverse the judgment below and to defer to Virginia's political determination of the definition of marriage. Post-appellate procedure The judgment order in the case states: \\"This judgment shall become final and take effect upon issuance of this court's mandate in accordance with Fed. R. App. P. 41.\\" It is not stayed initially. Thus, by operation of law, the defendants have at least 21 days to request a stay, or file for rehearing or rehearing en banc. The Fourth Circuit‚Äîin response to the Virginia solicitor general's question about the mandate's timing‚Äîhas stated that, per Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(b) and based upon the current record, the mandate was scheduled to issue on August 21, 2014. Michelle McQuigg, a Virginia county clerk and intervening defendant in the case, had asked the Fourth Circuit to stay its mandate in the case. On August 13, 2014, Judge Floyd, with the concurrence Judge Gregory, denied the intervening defendant's motion on a vote of 2‚Äì1, with Judge Niemeyer voting to grant the motion. McQuigg petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari and asked the high court to stay the Fourth Circuit's mandate until it disposes of her petition.McQuigg v. Bostic, No. 14A196 (Aug. 14, 2014) U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, as circuit justice for the Fourth Circuit, requested that lawyers for the respondent same-sex couples submit a reply to McQuigg's stay application by August 18, 2014. He referred the matter to the full court, which stayed enforcement of the ruling on August 20. Reaction Democratic Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe said he was \\"overjoyed\\" at the ruling: \\"This is a historic ruling for our commonwealth, and its effect will affirm once again that Virginia is a state that is open and welcoming to all.\\" On the day of the Fourth Circuit decision, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper announced he would no longer defend his state's ban on same-sex marriage. He said that because all judges in North Carolina were bound by the Fourth Circuit's precedent, \\"today we know our law will almost surely be overturned as well. Simply put, it's time to stop making arguments we will lose and instead move forward knowing the ultimate resolution will likely come from the United States Supreme Court.\\" Ralph Reed, chair of the Faith and Freedom Coalition said Cooper's position \\"violates his solemn obligation to protect and defend the constitution and the laws of the state\\". He said Cooper was \\"simply wrong\\" to think the ruling with respect to Virginia \\"renders his oath of office inoperable.\\" A spokesman for South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson said he would continue to defend his state ban on same-sex marriage and that \\"Ultimately, this will be a decision for the U.S. Supreme Court. People should not rush to act or react until that time, when a decision is made by the highest court in the land\\". On October 9, 2014, West Virginia Governor Ray Tomblin announced he was ordering state agencies to act in compliance with the Bostic, which the U.S. Supreme Court had just refused to take up. The state started issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on that same day. See also * LGBT rights in Virginia * Same-sex marriage in Virginia References External links *Bostic v.

Early and personal life Holst was born in Drammen, Norway. He was a son of bookseller Adolph Theodor Holst and Amalie Fredrikke Bergh. He was a grandson of merchant and politician, member of the Storting, Elling Mathias Holst (1785-1852). Holst enrolled as a student at the University of Christiania (now University of Oslo), his doctoral advisor was Sophus Lie, and he graduated as cand.real. in 1874. He continued his studies in Germany, where Felix Klein was among his teachers. He was appointed teacher at Aars og Voss skole in Christiania (now Oslo). His thesis Et par syntetiske Methoder, is√¶r til Brug ved Studiet af metriske Egenskaber was finished in 1882. Career Holst lectured in mathematics at the University of Oslo from 1894. Among his other mathematical works are his contribution from 1878, Om Poncelets betydning for geometrien, and several course books. He wrote biographies of several mathematicians, including Cato Maximilian Guldberg, Carl Anton Bjerknes, Sophus Lie and Niels Henrik Abel. Norsk Billedbog for B√∏rn Holst is particularly known for his children's books Norsk Billedbog for B√∏rn, three collections from 1888, 1890 and 1903 (with illustrations by Eivind Nielsen). The first of these books has been called Norway's first national picture book (although a picture abc had been published previously, in 1876). Holst started collecting traditional poems for children, several of which were first published in Norwegian writing in these books. These poems, such as \\"Ride, ride ranke\\", \\"Bake kake s√∏te\\", \\"Kjerringa med staven\\", \\"Hoppe! sa g√•sa\\" and \\"Du og jeg og vi to\\", have had a constant popularity over many years, and Norsk Billedbog for B√∏rn has been reissued several times. Also contemporary poetry was included in the books, such as some poems by Henrik Wergeland, \\"Kom bukken til gutten\\" by Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson, and \\"Blaamand\\" by Aasmund Olavsson Vinje. Among his other children's books are Julegodter for B√∏rn from 1892, and A.B.C. for Skole og Hjem from 1893 (together with Anna Rogstad). He published the picture book Fra S√¶teren in 1899, with illustrations by Lisbeth Bergh. Personal life He was married twice, first to Inger Skavlan (1852-99), and was a brother-in-law of Olaf Skavlan, Sigvald Skavlan, Aage Skavlan and Harald Skavlan. After her death, he married Marie Michelet (1872‚Äì1960), sister of Simon Michelet, in 1900. He was decorated Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav in 1902.

The sextet is composed of Stan Sutton on guitar, mandolin and vocals; Nick Dunbar on mandolin, guitar and vocals; Adam Pause on banjo and vocals; Jeff \\"Curly Collins\\" Schroeder on bass and vocals; Kyle Stersic on saxophone and electronic wind instruments; and Zach Scott on drums. The band is managed by Brian Heisler. Originally formed in 2006, the band has undergone several line-up changes, before settling into its current form in the fall of 2010. They released their self-titled debut album, recorded by Grammy-award winner David Glasser in February 2011 in support of their second annual \\"Mardi-Grass\\" celebration at the Fox theater in Boulder, Colorado.  History  Mountain Standard Time was originally formed as a four piece string band, composed of Adam Pause on banjo, Stan Sutton on mandolin and guitar, Curly Collins on bass, and Phillip Dyer on mandolin and guitar. At the time, all four were living in the town of Nederland, Colorado; known for its local music scene, and home to artists such as The String Cheese Incident, Yonder Mountain String Band, and Vince Herman (of Leftover Salmon and Great American Taxi fame). They soon set themselves apart from the crowded local music scene by staging impromptu acoustic sets outside venues after shows, having musical parades down the streets and fostering an expansion of the roots music scene in the community. Early in their career the band created a word of mouth buzz that continues to define them by playing a busy schedule of live performances. Notably, these performances included shows at the Pioneer Inn, First Street Pub and the Stage Stop. As is common with bands that fall under the label of \\"jambands\\", they were a \\"taper friendly\\" band from the start and have encouraged the taping and dissemination of their live performances. Many of these early shows can still be found on Live Music Archive to this day.  2008-Present  Due to series of chance meetings early in 2008, the Mountain Standard Time line-up began to change, their popularity grew and Mountain Standard Time began to imprint their brand of bluegrass, which they call \\"non- linear aquatic gypsy-grass\\", on the minds of an ever growing audience. They began to play up and down Colorado's Front Range, throughout the state and beyond. However, their biggest break most likely came in 2009, when they played their first Halloween show with Michael Kang (of String Cheese Incident fame). It was at this show that the band first teamed up with Conscious alliance, exchanging limited edition artwork for food drive donations, which they have continued to do at various shows. The following February, they played the first of their now annual Mardi-Grass celebrations to sold out audiences at the Fox in Boulder, Colorado. From there, they seem to have parlayed that success into landing slots on many of the summer festival scene's most prestigious events, most notably, Wakarusa in Arkansas, Summer Camp in Illinois and the 10,000 Lakes festival in Minnesota. In addition, they now have a busy, national touring schedule consisting of over 100 shows a year and have received glowing reviews from critics and fans alike.

German National Association) was a loose coalition of ethnic German national and liberal political parties in Cisleithania, a part of Austria-Hungary. It was formed to contest the 1911 election of the lower house of the Imperial Council () of Cisleithania. Loose coalitions of this type were common in the Imperial Council. It comprised ten individual parties, including the German People's Party, German Progress Party, German Radical Party, and German Agrarian Party. The Nationalverband managed to gain 104 seats at the 1911 election, making it the largest bloc in the Imperial Council, and ousting the previously dominant Christian Social Party. It relied on voters from areas of ethnic strife, such as in the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Duchy of Styria, but received very few votes in the Imperial capital, Vienna. A plan for the division of Bohemia on ethnic lines was put forth by the bloc, but the outbreak of the First World War stopped any further discussion of administrative reform. Gustav Gross, chairman of the Nationalverband, was in favour of the war, as he thought it could be used as a tool to reorganise the empire and entrench German dominance. He wrote in August 1914 that, after a quick victory, peace negotiations could be used to establish German as the official language of the state, and also to detach the largely Slavic-speaking kingdoms of Dalmatia and Galicia from Cisleithania. Gross's leadership was viewed as inept and moderate by younger members of the Nationalverband, especially because of his willingness to collaborate with the Christian Socialists in a war-time government. This led to infighting and factionalism within the bloc, and various splinter groups with more extreme aims were formed. As the bloc was always a very loose coalition with little internal unity, this infighting ultimately led to its disintegration in 1917, at the height of the First World War. It split into seventeen separate parties.

A typical multicooker is able to boil, simmer, bake, fry, deep fry, grill roast, stew, steam and brown food. The device is operated by placing ingredients inside, selecting the corresponding program, and leaving the multicooker to cook according to the program, typically without any need for further user intervention. Some multicookers have an adjustable thermostat. In addition to cooking programs, a multicooker may have functions to keep food warm, reheat it or to cook it at a later time. Some multicookers can also function as slow cookers.Krepshaw, Brian (22 March 2011). Multicooker does a bit of everything , cnet.com. Retrieved on 22 August 2015  History  In the 1920s in the United Kingdom, basic \\"multicookers\\" were marketed to consumers as an appliance that would save on gas consumption, to save money on gas bills. Simple electric rice cookers were developed in Japan in the 1950s. Over time more functions were added to cook other types of grains and soups, and the appliances became known as multicookers. Modern cookers include electronic time, temperature and pressure controllers and are marketed as \\"automated multipurpose cooking appliances\\". The most modern ones include Bluetooth and WiFi capabilities and cooking procedures in recipe scripts, mainly by choosing the temperature, time and pressure in multiple steps, to execute and share. At the same time, the European market had been producing kitchen appliances with individual functions, such as electric kettles, pressure cookers, bread makers, toasters, steamers, microwave ovens, and yogurt makers. The multicooker combines the functions of some of these devices. Multicookers can make hundreds of dishes characteristic of any cuisine, except those which require specific types of cooking unsupported by the appliances, such as flame grilling.  Functions  Typical programs include: * Cook (standard) ‚Äì comes to a boiling point and maintains it for a predetermined amount of time. Useful for preparing soup, broth, oatmeal with milk, rice, and grains. (90-110 ¬∞C) * Pasta ‚Äì heats to a boiling point and pauses with notification to the user that ingredients may be added (further automation would exclude human intervention to release ingredients). After that it comes to a boil again and maintains the temperature for a predetermined amount of time. The program can be used for cooking pasta, dumplings, eggs, sausages, and other products which need boiling water. (90-115 ¬∞C) * Stew ‚Äì brings to the boiling point and then continues at a slightly lower temperature. This program can make steamed vegetables, meat, and seafood. (85-105 ¬∞C) * Fry ‚Äì this setting can be used to fry meat, poultry, fish, vegetables, and seafood. Fry with an open or closed lid. (140-160 ¬∞C) * Bake ‚Äì biscuits, casseroles, cake, and pastries (120-180 ¬∞C) * Rice/grain ‚Äì heats to a boil and maintains the boil until the water is gone (via evaporation or absorption by the ingredients). This setting is used to cook boiled rice, buckwheat, peas, beans, and coarse grains. (100 ¬∞C) * Pilaf ‚Äì a combination of the rice and bake programs which starts with a full boil and then the temperature is reduced for a time. (90-110 ¬∞C then 70-80 ¬∞C) * Steam ‚Äì steams vegetables, meat, dumplings, and baby food. (100-115 ¬∞C) * Soup ‚Äì makes soup, broth, and various drinks. (90-110 ¬∞C) * Yogurt/dough ‚Äì makes homemade yogurt and proofs dough up to 12 hours. (35-60 ¬∞C) A multicooker may also support the following functions: * Custom ‚Äì cooking temperature, pressure and time can be set manually (35-180 ¬∞C). This may be used for sous-vide cookery. * Keep warm ‚Äì can be automatically activated after some of the programs end and can maintain a hot meal for several hours. The temperature is usually 70 ¬∞C or higher to prevent harmful bacteria from developing. * Reheat ‚Äì warms up a cold meal up to 50-70 ¬∞C. * Scheduled start ‚Äì controls the start time for cooking (timer). This function is only applicable to programs which do not require user intervention throughout the process and in which ingredients may safely stay at room temperature for the delay. * Sterilization ‚Äì may be used to sterilize baby items by steaming, or to help remove dried leftovers from the cooker after cooking has finished. (100-115 ¬∞C)  Parts  A multicooker consists of the following parts: * Housing ‚Äì typically plastic, stainless steel or a combination of both. The body is mounted or attached to other parts of the machine. With an air gap between it and the inner bowl, this functions as a thermal insulator. * Inner bowl ‚Äì in most modern designs, the bowl is removable and has a non-stick coating (teflon, ceramic, etc.). The non-stick coating is important for multicookers to operate properly. Non-stick coating keeps food from burning and sticking to the bottom and walls of the bowl which prevents disruption of heat during higher heat cooking or leads to uneven heating. It is unlike conventional cookware or slow cookers which must be stirred occasionally. * Lid ‚Äì this seals the multicooker preventing the contents from splashing or the food from drying out. Some multicookers have a glass lid. * Heating element ‚Äì mounted in the housing, it cooks the food. Temperatures can reach 40-180 ¬∞C allowing any method of cooking from keeping food warm to baking or frying. The heating element is typically located in the bottom of a multicooker. Some more sophisticated multicookers have smaller heating elements on the sides and in the lid. * Temperature sensors ‚Äì usually located in the center of the housing's bottom, touching the pan to ensure accurate readings. The control panel provides information about the temperature of the bowl‚Äôs contents. Some multicookers also have temperature sensors on the sides and on top to allow fine control of heating elements in the lid and sides. * Pressure sensor ‚Äì this may be installed if the multicooker supports pressure cooking. * Control panel ‚Äì part of the housing, this consists of a microprocessor with programs which are displayed showing the process, temperature and programs. It also includes several buttons to control the process. * Condensate collector ‚Äì typically a small container or an area around multicooker's bowl to collect condensation appearing on the lid.

Foss and Mary Jane Foss, 1836, watercolor, pencil, and ink on paper, in the collection of the American Folk Art Museum Joseph H. Davis (active 1832-1837) was an itinerant North American portrait painter. Over a period of only five years, from 1832‚Äì37, the itinerant artist Joseph H. Davis painted about 150 watercolor portraits of residents of Maine and New Hampshire. The body of work he left behind is highly regarded for its calligraphic line, miniaturizing delicacy, and decorative stylization. His pictures are in many important collections, including those of the American Folk Art Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the National Gallery of Art, the Terra Foundation for American Art and the Strawbery Banke museum in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Life and work = Personal life = Little is known about the artist's life. However, Davis' signature on his early portraits, many including ‚ÄúLeft-handed painter‚Äù after his name, helps to demystify some of the anonymity about the painter and his work. The portrait of Bartholomew Van Dame is inscribed \\"Left Hand / Painter,\\" which is taken as a confirmation that the artist was left-handed.See Wertkin, Encyclopedia, p. 144 and Stacy C. Hollander (ed.) et al., American Radiance: The Ralph Esmerian Gift to the American Folk Art Museum, New York: The American Folk Art Museum in association with Harry N. Abrams, 2001, p. 392. The 1926 donation of a signed portrait by an individual donor to the New Hampshire Historical Society led to speculation as to whether he was the Joseph H. Davis of Farmington or Dover, or if he was from Maine instead. Although his identity remained uncertain for almost another half century, his work was featured in a major exhibition in 1974 at the Art Institute of Chicago. His identity was only securely established in 1989. Historians have been able to reconstruct his movements during his brief career as an itinerant artist because of the calligraphic inscriptions Davis would include at the foot of his pictures, usually giving the name and age of his sitters. The sitters are then cross-referenced through external sources, establishing their (and the artist's) location at the time of the painting. In this way, Art Historians Arthur and Sybil Kern connected the artist as a local farmer known as \\"Pine Hill Joe\\" of Limington, Maine. These primary sources also postulate that Joseph H. Davis was probably born on August 10, 1811, in Limington, Maine to land trader Joseph Davis and his wife, Phebe. In addition to farming and land speculating, he also worked as a manufacturer and an inventor. He lived in several towns in the Northeast, including Saco, Vassalboro, and Newfield, Maine; Morristown, New Jersey; and Wilmington, Massachusetts. He died on May 25, 1865, at the age of fifty-three, in Woburn, Massachusetts. John and Abigail Montgomery, 1836, watercolor, pencil, ink on paper. In the collection of the National Gallery of Art. The article by Arthur and Sybil Kern that established Davis's identity also posited his connection with the Freewill Baptist Church.Arthur Kern and Sybil Kern, \\"Joseph H. Davis: Identity Established,\\" pp. 48-50. This church provided the network that connected Davis with many of his clients, and Davis includes the church's publications, The Morning Star, as an attribute in many of his portraits. Davis married in 1835 and moved to Saco, Maine, but he remained active as an artist until about 1838. He may have ceased painting at that date because the birth of his daughter necessitated a more secure income. Thereafter, he was occupied in land speculation, manufacturing, and inventing. Initially unheard of outside the region in which he worked, Davis was ‚Äúrediscovered‚Äù by American folk art collectors a century later; today, his works are highly prized. = Artistry = Betsey Dowst, 1837, watercolor, pencil, and ink on paper, in the collection of the American Folk Art Museum. Individuals are often displayed alongside prized possessions such as books and pets. Art historians have been able to reconstruct his movements during his brief career as an itinerant artist because of the calligraphic inscriptions Davis would include at the foot of his pictures, usually giving the name and age of his sitters. The sitters are then cross-referenced through external sources, establishing their (and the artist‚Äôs) location at the time of the painting. Mary Antoinette Lorania Pike and Sarah Adeline Pike, 1865, watercolor, pencil, and ink on paper, in the collection of the American Folk Art Museum. An example of the geometrically patterned carpets that help to characterize this artist‚Äôs work. Davis's art has a highly consistent character. He painted portraits in watercolor, with the faces of his sitters depicted in strict profile while their bodies usually open outward to a three-quarter view.Hollander (ed.), American Radiance, p. 393. As early as 1832, he specialized in recording subjects in interior settings typical of a nineteenth-century rural New England home. A burgeoning manufacture economy and flourishing middle class contributed to both Davis‚Äôs success as an itinerant painter and the quality of goods portrayed in his works. The objects portrayed (e.g. musical instruments, inkwells, books, etc.) are used to characterize the subject‚Äôs personalities, suggesting their professions and displaying their life styles. Practical floor covering was replaced by the painted floor cloth, a heavy sailcloth stiffened with starch and decorated with bold geometric repeat patterns; sometimes the floors themselves were painted freehand in similar fashion.\\" Other examples of period-specific furnishing portrayed in Davis‚Äôs paintings are the neoclassical Klismos Chair (as seen in the Portrait of Sylvanus C. Foss and Mary Jane Foss, 1836), the banjo clock, and paintings of the family homestead. He is best known ‚Äúfor his double portraits of married couples facing each other across a table.‚Äù His work can also be characterized by the painting of multiple members of a single family, either in groups or individually, demonstrating that his reputation spread by word of mouth among the closely tied families of the rural municipalities in which he traveled. Another distinguishing feature of Davis‚Äôs work are the calligraphic ink inscriptions at the bottom of his watercolor portraits. This included their names, year, and the town where they resided. The artist often signed his name to the composition, annotating it with a personal description of himself as a ‚ÄúLEFT HAND / PAINTER.‚Äù  References  *Kern, Arthur and Sybil. \\"Joseph H.

The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-famine. was a famine where 1.5 million (possibly as many as 2.0‚Äì2.3 million) people died in Soviet Kazakhstan, of whom 1.3 million were ethnic Kazakhs; 38% of all Kazakhs died, the highest percentage of any ethnic group killed in the Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì33. Some historians assume that 42% of the entire Kazakh population died in the famine. Kazakhstan's livestock and grain were largely acquired between 1929 and 1932, with one-third of the republic's cereals being requisitioned and more than 1 million tons confiscated in 1930 to provide food for the cities. Some historians and scholars describe the famine as a genocide of the Kazakhs perpetrated by the Soviet state. The famine made Kazakhs a minority in the Kazakh ASSR and it was not until the 1990s did Kazakhs become the largest group in Kazakhstan again. Before the famine, around 60% of the republic's population were Kazakhs, but only around 38% of the population were Kazakhs after the famine.  Overview  It was the most severe of all regions affected by famine, percentage-wise, although more people died in the Ukrainian Holodomor which began a year later. In addition to the Kazakh famine of 1919‚Äì1922, Kazakhstan lost more than half of its population in 10‚Äì15 years due to the actions of the Soviet state. The two Soviet censuses show that the number of the Kazakhs in Kazakhstan dropped from 3,637,612 in 1926 to 2,181,520 in 1937. Ethnic minorities in Kazakhstan were also significantly affected. The Ukrainian population in Kazakhstan decreased from 859,396 to 549,859 (a reduction of almost 36% of their population) while other ethnic minorities in Kazakhstan lost 12% and 30% of their populations. Ukrainians who died in Kazakhstan are sometimes considered victims of Holodomor. Due to the starvation 665,000 Kazakhs fled the famine with their cattle outside Kazakhstan to China, Mongolia, Afghanistan, Iran and the Soviet republics of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Russia in search of food and employment in the new industrialization sites of Western Siberia with 900,000 head of cattle. The Soviet government worked later to repatriate them.Ohayon, Isabelle, 2006, La S√©dentarisation des Kazakhs dans the USSR de Stalin. Collectivization et changement social (1928-1945). Maisonneuve et Larose. 70% of the refugees survived and the rest died due to epidemics and hunger. A monument for the famine's victims was constructed in 2017.  Classification as a genocide  Some historians and scholars consider that this famine amounted to genocide of the Kazakhs. The Soviet authorities undertook a campaign of persecution against the nomads in the Kazakhs, believing that the destruction of the class was a worthy sacrifice for the collectivization of Kazakhstan.PIanciola, Niccol√≤, 2004, \\"Famine in the steppe. The collectivization of agriculture and the Kazak herdsmen, 1928-1934\\", Cahiers du monde russe, vol. 45, No. 1-2, pp. 137-192.Pianciola, Niccol√≤, 2009, Stalinismo di frontiera. Colonizzazione agricola, sterminio dei nomadi and costruzione statale in Asia centrale (1905-1936), Rome: Viella. Europeans in Kazakhstan had disproportionate power in the party which has been argued as a cause of why indigenous nomads suffered the worst part of the collectivization process rather than the European sections of the country.Payne, Matthew J., 2011, \\"Seeing like a soviet state: settlement of nomadic Kazakhs, 1928-1934\\", in Alexopoulos, Golgo; Hessler, Julie. Regarding the Kazakh catastrophe, Michael Ellman states that it \\"seems to be an example of 'negligent genocide' which falls outside the scope of the UN Convention\\". However, historian Robert Kindler explicitly rejects the notion that the famine was a genocidal programme of mass murder, citing the fact that the famines in both Ukraine and Kazakhstan were part of a broader food crisis that enveloped many regions of the Soviet Union and that there is no evidence of Stalin pursuing the destruction of any given ethnic group.

Williams is the author with true crime writer Sue Russell of The Illustrated Courtroom: 50 Years of Court Art, a history of American courtroom sketch artistry published by CUNY Journalism Press in 2014. Career FAISAL SHAHZAD, THE \\"TIMES SQUARE BOMBER\\" SENTENCING, MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT: OCTOBER 5, 2010 Williams‚Äô career began in Hollywood, California, where she was a fashion illustrator for designers such as Michael Travis and in the atelier of Bob Mackie. Following the suggestion of a teacher she decided to pursue the possible career as a court artist. While working as a fashion illustrator she went to an art show in San Diego, California, where she saw the courtroom art of well-known sketch artist Bill Robles. After a meeting with Robles, she began to work as a courtroom artist. The first court case she covered was the San Bernardino, California hearing of a child molester in 1980. After Williams met Robles at a trial in Los Angeles, California, that they were both covering and he began to mentor her. The first high-profile trial she covered was the 1984 drug trafficking trial of John DeLorean for Los Angeles-based channel KABC-TV. Later that year Williams returned to her native New York and began working as a courtroom artist in New York City. While in New York City, Williams gained a reputation for reporting on white-collar crime. She covered the trials inside traders Ivan Boesky, Michael Milken, Raj Rajaratnam, and Martha Stewart. Williams also reported on the trials of financial figures such as Bernard Madoff, Bernard Ebbers, and Dominique Strauss-Khan. Non-financial trials reported on by Williams include those of John Gotti, Times Square Bomber, terrorist Abu Anas al Libi, and Russian spy Anna Chapman. In 2012, 61 of Williams‚Äô sketches depicting the Sean Bell trial were acquired by the Lloyd Sealy Library at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Along with crime writer Sue Russell, Williams authored The Illustrated Courtroom: 50 Years of Court Art, which was published in 2014 by CUNY Journalism Press. The book is a retrospective of American courtroom sketch art of high-profile trials produced from 1964‚Äì2014 and contains work from artists Howard Brodie, Aggie Kenny, Bill Robles, Richard Tomlinson, and Williams. Education and style Williams studied art at Washington University in St. Louis, the Parsons The New School for Design, Syracuse University and the Otis Art Institute. Much of her artwork is created with brush pens, colored pencils, oil pastel and oil paint sticks.

The original school was the first free and integrated school in the United States. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 6, 1998. History Dr. Silas Hamilton, for whom the school is named, was a Mississippi plantation owner who freed his 28 slaves and moved to Otterville in 1830. When Hamilton died in 1834, he left $4000 for the construction of a free and integrated public school. The school, which was completed in 1835, was the first free school in Illinois and the first free and integrated school in the United States. In 1839, the Illinois General Assembly legally incorporated the school. The original building was demolished in 1872, and the current school building was built from the same stone the following year. George Washington, one of Hamilton's former slaves, bequeathed $1500 upon his death in 1864 to build a monument to Hamilton. The marble monument, erected in front of the school the same year, is currently maintained by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. A plaque in front of the Jersey County Courthouse also commemorates the school. The school building served Otterville's students until 1971. The Otter Creek Historical Society took control of the building in 1982; however, the school has suffered from poor maintenance since then due to insufficient funding. Landmarks Illinois named the school as one of the ten most endangered historic places in Illinois in April 2014. Architecture The two-story, limestone school has an Italianate design. The limestone used to build the school came from the 1835 school building and was originally from the Hiram White Quarry in Mississippi Township; due to its local abundance, limestone was a popular building material in Jersey County in the mid-19th century. The front entrance has an arched double door below a second-floor arched section with two arched windows and an oculus; another oculus is above the opening, and a pediment tops the entrance bay. The other first- and second-story windows are tall and narrow with arched hoods. The school's roof has wide eaves with decorative brackets and is topped by a cupola.

Peter and Paul, is situated near the village of Rsovci, Stara Planina, in a cave on Kalik Hill, 22 km from Pirot. Dedicated to Saint Peter and Paul the Apostle, the church was built in the 13th century. It contains a fresco, painted on the wall of the cave, depicting a bald-headed Jesus. The church has been under Serbian state protection as a national cultural heritage site since 1981. Characteristics The fresco of a bald-headed Jesus (on its northern interior wall) is also known as the fresco of the young Jesus (Ser. –ò—Å—É—Å –ú–ª–∞–¥–µ–Ω–∞—Ü). The color and style of the painting indicate it is from the middle or second half of the 13th century; it is believed to have been done at a time when large numbers of Sinai anchorites came to Serbia, during the reign of Lazar of Serbia (1373‚Äì1389). In the past, the path to the church was almost impassable, making access extremely difficult, but funding from the World Travel Agency made access possible. Since the whole church was formed of rock, the entrance to the cave became the entrance to the church. The iconostasis was made of ordinary wooden beams. Although the church had a simple design, over the centuries the shrine became a spiritual hermitage for pilgrims from afar who came to the village during the summer. Bald-headed Jesus The bald Jesus in the church of Sts. Peter and Paul, Rsovci Serbian journalist and photographer Dragan Bosniƒá, who discussed the fresco in his Amazing Serbia, explains: > In a small temple which is fifty square meters in size, dedicated to Sts. > Peter and Paul, the clergy and the believers are praying below a fresco with > an image of a young bald-headed Jesus, depicted by a local painter as having > no hair. Bald-headed Jesus was painted in the second half of the 13th > century on the north wall of the church. He is shown in Buddhist robes > inside the octagonal mandorla, or inside the star, which is the greater > miracle. Bosniƒá adds: > The fresco of a young bald-headed Jesus is unique in Serbian fresco painting > and also in Christian art as a whole. There is no precise information on how > this miracle fresco was created but it is assumed that under the rule of > knez Lazar, the fresco was painted by ascetics from Sinai who came to > Serbia. At that time hermitage sanctuaries were not subject to the episcopal > canons. As a result, people believed the image of the bald-headed Jesus was > painted by the ascetics from that church. Today, the beauty of the fresco > attracts a large number of both worshippers and tourists. It is suggested that this bald-headed Jesus could have been painted here only because the place did not suffer from \\"Episcopalian censorship\\". It is believed by some that the image of the young Jesus was painted by a painter or group of painters influenced by the different directions of Christianity. Only after Bosniƒá's photograph, could it be seen that he was a very young man, with chubby cheeks, blue eyes and a halo indicating his divinity. It can be clearly seen that Jesus has a naked chest and uncovered arms as a result of the cloak he is wearing. He bears no cross in his hands but raises three of his fingers in a symbol of baptism.

Biography He was born in Kollum as the son of Sjoerd Saeckma and Fedke Ringia, but his father died just after he was born and he was raised by his uncle Reinalda. He was educated at Franeker, Heidelberg and Basel, where he became a doctor. In 1596 he was admitted to the admiralty of Friesland in Dokkum, and in 1600 he became procureur-generaal. He was soon judge of the Hof van Friesland, and in 1628 he was curator of the Fries university and a representative to the Staten-Generaal. He married Hylck Boner, daughter of Johannes Boner, and though they had several children, his sons died without issue and his estate was left to his daughter who married Hans van Wyckel. Hylck's portrait was documented as painted by Frans Hals, and a portrait by Frans Hals was identified as a possible pendant by Wilhelm Valentiner in 1923. In 1910 Hofstede de Groot documented this portrait with the following description: \\"PORTRAIT OF A MAN STANDING. 6.30; M. 143. Almost a three-quarter-length.

The paintings do seem to match in size, position, age of the sitters, and period of creation. The Hylck-Johannes attribution is also attached to another pair of pendant portraits dated 1628, that may be of the Haarlem couple Theodor Schrevelius and his wife Maria van Teylingen.

The program was based on the idea that higher education is a path out of poverty, yet college admissions favors the children of college graduates and the process for applying to college is complicated and biased against those that don't understand it. The CAN program was initially supported by Garfield GEAR UP Director Randy Riley and Principal Ted Howard who agreed to make the computer lab available after school for use by CAN students to complete college applications. Schechter started the program by writing an application for a full-time AmeriCorps VISTA to help run and build the program. The first VISTA, Karly Feria, stayed with CAN for two years and was joined by other AmeriCorps members. The initial VISTA cost $3,500 and was paid for by the Garfield PTSA. The program was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) organization on December 19, 2006. The first major grant came from the Fordham Street Foundation in May 2006 for $40,000 over two years and enabled the hiring of staff. CAN expanded to Franklin High School in 2008 supported by a grant from College Spark. Early press for CAN included a 2006 feature in the Christian Science Monitor, and a 2007 Op-Ed in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.

It is located in the historic neighborhood of Barelas. History The restaurant was founded by Refugio and Carmen Garcia in 1929, as El Modelo Tortilla Factory. Carmen would get up at two in the morning to prepare tortillas to sell for breakfast. She hired Petra Vargas to make tamales. Vargas then taught Garcia's family how to make tamales. When Carmen's son, Leo Garcia, came home from World War II, in 1945, he went into business with his mother. In 1947, Salvador Garcia, the eldest son, helped build the current building in the former location of the family's three room house. The location has not changed since it was established in 1929. In 1985, Hector Mendoza and Virginia Chittim purchased the restaurant, and they ran it together until 2003. At which point, Virginia Chittim took full ownership of the restaurant. Today El Modelo continues to serve tortillas and their critically acclaimed tamales. As well as New Mexican cuisine including, chile rellenos, enchiladas, stuffed sopapillas, huevos rancheros, burritos, and tacos. Reception The restaurant was also ranked as the 4th best Mexican restaurant in Albuquerque by USAToday's 2012 10Best. In 2013, El Modelo was voted one of the \\"Best Mexican Restaurants in the U.S.\\" by Travel + Leisure, which described the food as \\"rave-worthy\\".

Sixteen years later, in 1886, the congregation moved a half block east to 1347 W. Erie St. and changed its name to Erie Chapel. In 1893, it was selected as one of 20 founding members of Chicago's Free Kindergarten Association. Erie Chapel expanded facilities at its new location two years later to accommodate its growing youth programs, choirs for children and adults, and industrial classes. As the social gospel movement began to take hold in American religious thought, the Chicago Federation of Settlements‚Äîof which Erie House became a member‚Äîformed at Hull House in 1894, the agency started by social work and settlement house matriarch Jane Addams. Florence Towne helped cement Erie House's reputation in the community. The demographics of the West Town community began to transition at the turn of the 20th century as Italian and Polish immigrants populated the area near and around Erie Chapel. By 1915, Erie Chapel consisted of three staff members and an annual budget of $6,400 (roughly $150,000 when adjusted for inflation), at which point it incorporated and renamed itself Erie Chapel Institute. One notable staff member, Florence Towne, served as the kindergarten teacher and girls group leader from 1914 to 1926, at which time she was appointed head resident. Towne's faith, generosity and resilience earned her a reputation far beyond the walls of Erie House, prompting Reader's Digest to label her the \\"Angel of the Alleys.\\" She served families at Erie House from 1914 until her death in 1951, living on-site in staff quarters at 1347 W. Erie St. for the last 25 years of her life. In 1936, a new building was dedicated at 1347 W. Erie St. with the words TO THE GLORY OF GOD AND SERVICE TO HIS CHILDREN etched into the cornerstone. It was then that the settlement house adopted Erie Neighborhood House as its name, supporting a staff of 12 and upwards of 50 Works Progress Administration (WPA) laborers. Over the next two decades, Erie House expanded its initiatives to include dental care, a health clinic, a clean neighborhood program, child care to accommodate a shifting workforce in the wake of U.S. engagement in World War II, and one of the nation's first Meals on Wheels programs. The 1950s witnessed an increase in families migrating from Puerto Rico, drawn from the island to the mainland in part by a new San Juan-to-Chicago fare promotion offered by Pan Am Airways. Many of these families settled in parts of West Town and Humboldt Park and became connected with Erie House, thus initiating the agency's demographic shift toward Chicago's growing Latino community. Erie House spawned several independent community efforts during the 1960s: the Northwest Community Organization, co-founded with Holy Innocents Catholic Church as a mobilizing force for social change; Bickerdike Redevelopment Corporation, an affordable housing program; and Erie Family Health Center, a Northwestern University medical student-staffed health clinic serving low-income families. At the same time, construction on the Kennedy Expressway and Chicago's mounting racial tension prompted additional changes to the West Town community, as many white, European households began moving out to suburban Chicago, causing property values to plummet and a dramatic shift in neighborhood demographics. By the 1980s, Mexican Americans were recognized as Chicago's largest group of immigrants, and the rising influence of Latin Americans in Chicago was reflected in the changing makeup of Erie House program participants as well as its staff members. Rafael Ravelo, an immigrant from Cuba, became the agency's first Latino executive director in 1985 (all three Erie House executive directors who have served since Ravelo's tenure have also been Latino, representing both the Puerto Rican and Mexican American communities served at Erie House). The organization also launched its TEAM mentoring initiative for high school students in the 1980s in collaboration with The Northern Trust Company. A decade later, in 1995, Erie House expanded to a second West Town location a half mile away at 1701 W. Superior St., a move that move enabled the agency to greatly increase its early childhood education program capacity from 40 children to 180 children. Erie House administrative offices were also moved to this location. Erie Family Health Center renewed ties with Erie House to co-purchase the building, formerly a cardboard box factory, and moved their headquarters and clinic services to occupy the third and fourth floors. Erie House partnered with the Little Village Development Corporation (now Enlace Chicago) in 2004 to begin offering services to residents of Chicago's Little Village community. In 2005, the organization founded Erie Elementary Charter School (EECS) in neighboring Humboldt Park with a goal to \\"empower students to successfully and productively engage in the local community and broader society.\\" For the most part, the charter school operates independently from Erie Neighborhood House, but the two continue to collaborate on certain initiatives and Erie House operates a separate after-school program on-site at EECS.  Programs and Services  Erie Neighborhood House offers a wide variety of services to roughly 4,500 children and adults annually. Programs for children and youth include NAEYC-Accredited early childhood education, after-school programming‚Äîincluding STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) and literacy initiatives‚Äîfor school-aged children, and tutoring and mentoring opportunities for middle and high school youth. The agency's TEAM mentoring program boasts extremely high graduation and college placement rates for its participants and has placed significant emphasis on preparing students for careers in STEM fields. Adult and family programs revolve around English as a Second Language (ESL) classes; workforce development; technology education; community literacy; citizenship and immigration services; a housing initiative in partnership with the Chicago Housing Authority; health and leadership programming designed to empower families with knowledge and resources for proper nutrition, exercise and self-care; and a comprehensive program that seeks to empower women and children, strengthen the overall family unit, and provide valuable resources to families working with the Illinois Department of Children & Family Services. In step with the settlement house tradition, the agency is also a staunch advocate for social change on local and national levels, addressing issues ranging from immigration reform to early childhood education to affordable housing and community development.  Leadership, Staff and Structure  Governed by a board of directors, Erie House exhibits a leadership structure that is typical for a mid-sized nonprofit organization: its administration includes an executive director, a senior leadership team, and staff of key program directors and supervisors. Kirstin Chernawsky is the executive director at Erie Neighborhood House. She is the ninth individual to serve in this role since the agency's incorporation in 1915, having succeeded Celena Rold√°n in March 2016. With an annual budget of approximately $8M, the organization employs a diverse workforce of 150 full- and part-time employees. Its programs operate on a blend of federal, state and private foundation funding. The organization also relies on a generous donor base in addition to an active volunteer corps.

Under international law, these activities are generally highly restricted, and it is considered a violation of a state's sovereignty if any other state engages in law enforcement or military operations within another state without gaining that state's consent:  Law enforcement  The policing of transnational and international crimes is a challenge to state- based law enforcement agencies, as jurisdiction restricts the direct intervention a state's agencies can legally take in another state's jurisdiction, with even basic law enforcement activities such as arrest and detention \\"tantamount to abduction\\" when carried out extraterritorially. These explicit limits on extraterritorial law enforcement operations has therefore instead encouraged co-operation between law enforcement agencies of sovereign states, forming supranational agencies such as Interpol to encourage co- operation, and placing additional obligations on the state such as aut dedere aut judicare (\\"extradite or prosecute\\") to compel prosecution of certain types of transnational crime, including hijacking of civilian aircraft, taking of civilian hostages, and other acts of terrorism, as well as crimes against diplomats and other \\"internationally protected persons\\".  Military operations  While extraterritorial law enforcement activity is highly restricted and subject to the approval of the 'host' state, traditional interstate military operations assume some degree of extraterritorial operation. As Stigall points out, innate in 'just' war (jus ad bellum) is the expectation that one state may be conducting military activity against, and within the borders, of another state; the laws of armed conflict \\"[presuppose] extraterritoriality\\". Therefore, \\"[i]f the circumstances exist for the lawful use of force under jus ad bellum, then so long as a state abides by the rules articulated in jus in bello [the law of war], that state‚Äôs extraterritorial actions are considered lawful.\\" = \\"Unwilling or unable\\" = Problems with the legitimacy of extraterritorial operations arise, according to Stigall, when one state is conducting military activity against non-state actors in a state \\"that is not party to the conflict\\". Although some commentators suggest that the use of force is permitted in some of these cases, with Deeks' commentary on the 'Unwilling or Unable Test' mentioning sources that recommend that \\"neutrality law permits a belligerent to use force on a neutral state‚Äôs territory if the neutral state is unable or unwilling to prevent violations of its neutrality by another belligerent\\", Stigall reminds \\"that such view is not universal, and textual authority for such cross-border attacks is limited\\". = Humanitarian and human rights law = For the Council of Europe, key tenets of its human rights law jurisdiction are laid down in Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), with the convention employed to complement and reinforce the more specific scope of humanitarian law. The application of this to extraterritorial operations has been noted by Ryngaert as mixed, with Al-Skeini and others v United Kingdom in 2011 attempting \\"to square Bankovic [v. Belgium's \\"sufficient control\\" model of jurisdiction] with the personal model of jurisdiction\\", and Al-Jedda v United Kingdom \\"tried to reconcile the ‚Äòultimate control and authority‚Äô standard... with the ‚Äòeffective operational control‚Äô standard endorsed by the UN‚Äôs International Law Commission.\\" Ryngaert declares each of the two results to be \\"an awkward hybrid theory\\".
