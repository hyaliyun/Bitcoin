The barn was built in 1912 by the team of Jeremiah Shaffer and the Haas Brothers about one half mile from the Illinois-Wisconsin state border. The building is the first round barn in the Stephenson County area, home to 31 round barns, with a hip roof. The building was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History The Charles Fehr Round Barn was built in 1912 for Walter Knott. The building stands on a concrete foundation near the Stephenson County village of Orangeville, about one half mile from the Illinois-Wisconsin state border. Architecture The original design of the 56 foot (17.1 m) diameter round barn included a rooftop cupola as well as a silo on the barn's southeast quadrant. Both of these features are no longer extant, the barn is otherwise in unaltered condition. The structure was built and designed by the team of Jeremiah Shaffer and the Haas Brothers. The loft is supported by a central concrete shaft, at its apex joists radiate outward from it. Access to the loft is obtained through an earthen ramp on the building's west side and the animal entrance is found on the barn's southeast side.See also Banked barn. Both entrances are covered by an overhang. The single hip roof is braced on its interior by a 2 by 6 inch (5.1 by 15.2 cm) beam nailed to each rafter four feet (1.2 m) above, and four feet (1.2 m) below on the opposite side, the roof hip. The exterior wooden roof is covered with asphalt shingles and the barn's original siding has been covered with sheet metal.Sculle, Keith A. \\"Charles Fehr Round Barn,\\" National Register of Historic Places Individual Property Form: Multiple Property Submission, October 1983, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency.

Significance The Charles Fehr Round Barn is one of 31 round barns that were constructed in a four county area, the Stephenson County area, that includes Winnebago and Stephenson Counties as well as Rock and Green Counties in Wisconsin. Twenty one of those barns, including the Fehr Round Barn are within Stephenson County.Sculle, Keith A. \\",\\" (PDF) National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, January 9, 1984, National Register Information System, National Park Service. Retrieved October 5, 2007. The Fehr Round Barn illustrates the evolution of round barn design, especially in the Stephenson County area. The barn was the first in the area to be built with a hip roof. This roof style set the structure's design apart from the typical round barn designed based on recommendations from the University of Illinois' and the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison's Agricultural Experiment Stations. The building represents the ability of local builders and designers to create their own ideas without the station's influence.

It is also known for a process organized by the Kingdom of Italy to force cultural and ethnic assimilation of the native populations living, primarily, in the former Austro-Hungarian territories that were transferred to Italy after World War I in exchange for Italy having joined the Triple Entente in 1915. This process was conducted during the period of Fascist rule between 1922 and 1943. Regions and populations affected Between 1922 and the beginning of World War II, the affected people were the German-speaking and Ladin-speaking populations of Trentino-Alto Adige, and Slovenes and Croats in the Julian March. The program was later extended to areas annexed during World War II, affecting Slovenes in the Province of Ljubljana, and Croats in Gorski Kotar and coastal Dalmatia, Greeks in the Ionian islands and, to a lesser extent, to the French- and Arpitan-speaking regions of the western Alps (such as the Aosta valley). On the other hand, the island of Sardinia had already undergone cultural and linguistic Italianization starting from an earlier period. =Istria, Julian March and Dalmatia= The former Austrian Littoral (later renamed the Julian March) was occupied by the Italian Army after the Armistice with Austria.

Fascists burn the Slovenian \\"National Hall (Narodni dom)\\" in Trieste, July 13, 1920 The period of violent persecution of Slovenes in Trieste began with riots in 13 April 1920, which were organized as a retaliation for the assault on the Italian occupying troops by the local Croatian population in the 11 July Split incident. Many Slovene-owned shops and buildings were destroyed during the riots, which culminated in the burning down of the Narodni dom (\\"National House\\"), the community hall of the Triestine Slovenes, by a group of Italian Fascists, led by Francesco Giunta. Benito Mussolini praised this action as a \\"masterpiece of the Triestine fascism\\". Two years later he became prime minister of Italy. In September 1920, Mussolini said: This expressed a common Fascist opinion against the Croatian and Slovene minority in the Julian March. Italian teachers were assigned to schools and the use of Croatian and Slovene languages in the administration and in the courts restricted. After March 1923 these languages were prohibited in administration, and after October 1925 in law courts, as well. In 1923, in the context of the organic school reform prepared by the fascist minister Giovanni Gentile, teaching in languages different from Italian was abolished. In the Julian March this meant the end of teaching in Croatian and Slovenian. Some 500 Slovene teachers, nearly half of all Slovene teachers in the Littoral region, were moved by the Italians from the area, to the interior of Italy, while Italian teachers were sent to teach Slovene children Italian. However, in ≈†u≈°njevica (it: Valdarsa) the use of Istro- Rumanian language was allowed after 1923.PU≈ûCARIU, Sextil. Studii istrorom√¢ne.

First or given names were also Italianized. Slovene and Croat societies and sporting and cultural associations had to cease every activity in line with a decision of provincial Fascist secretaries dated 12 June 1927. On a specific order from the prefect of Trieste on 19 November 1928, the Edinost political society was also dissolved. Croat and Slovene financial co-operatives in Istria, which at first were absorbed by the Pula or Trieste savings banks, were gradually liquidated.A Historical Outline Of Istria In 1927, Giuseppe Cobolli Gigli, the minister for public works in fascist Italy, wrote in Gerarchia magazine, a Fascist publication, that \\"The Istrian muse named as Foibe those places suitable for burial of enemies of the national [Italian] characteristics of Istria\\".Gerarchia, vol. IX, 1927: \\"La musa istriana ha chiamato Foiba degno posto di sepoltura per chi nella provincia d'Istria minaccia le caratteristiche nazionali dell'Istria\\"http://www.danas.rs/20050217/dijalog1.html http://www.lavocedifiore.org/SPIP/article.php3?id_article=1692http://www.osservatoriobalcani.org/article/articleview/3901/1/176/ The Slovene militant anti-Fascist organization TIGR emerged in 1927. It co- ordinated the Slovene resistance against Fascist Italy until its dismantlement by the Fascist secret police in 1941. At the time, some TIGR ex-members joined the Slovene Partisans. As a result of the repression, more than 100,000 Slovenes and Croats emigrated from Italian territory between the two world wars, the vast majority to Yugoslavia. Among the notable Slovene √©migr√©s from Trieste were the writers Vladimir Bartol and Josip Ribiƒçiƒç, the legal theorist Boris Furlan, and the architect Viktor Sulƒçiƒç. World War II war crimes Inmate in left Italian soldiers shooting Slovenian hostages from village Dane, Lo≈°ka dolina During World War II Italy attacked Yugoslavia, and occupied large portions of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Serbia and Macedonia, directly annexing Ljubljana Province, Gorski Kotar and Central Dalmatia along with most Croatian islands. In Dalmatia the Italian government made stringent efforts to Italianize the region. Italian occupying forces were accused of committing war crimes in order to transform occupied territories into ethnic Italian territories.Z. Dizdar: \\"Italian Policies Toward Croatians In Occupied Territories During The Second World War\\", Review of Croatian History Issue no.1 /2005 The Italian government sent tens-of-thousands of Slavic citizens, among them many women and children, to Italian concentration campsElenco Dei Campi Di Concentramento Italiani, such as Rab concentration camp, Gonars, Monigo, Renicci, Molat, Zlarin, Mamula, etc. From Ljubljana Province alone, historians estimate the Italians sent 25,000 to 40,000 Slovenes to concentration camps, which represents 8-12% of the total population. Thousands died in the camps, including hundreds of children. Survivors received no compensation from Italy after the war. Mario Roatta was the commander of the Italian 2nd Army in Yugoslavia. To suppress the mounting resistance led by the Slovene partisans, he adopted tactics of \\"summary executions, hostage-taking, reprisals, internments and the burning of houses and villages.\\"General Roatta's War against the Partisans in Yugoslavia: 1942, IngentaConnect After the war the Yugoslav government sought unsuccessfully to have him extradited for war crimes from Spain, where he was protected by Francisco Franco. Tommaso Di Francesco and Giacomo Scotti, \\"Sixty Years of Ethnic Cleansing\\", Le Monde Diplomatique, 8 May 1999 Mario Robotti issued an order in line with a directive received from Mussolini in June 1942: \\"I would not be opposed to all (sic) Slovenes being imprisoned and replaced by Italians. In other words, we should take steps to ensure that political and ethnic frontiers coincide.\\" =Ionian Islands= The cultural remnants of the Venetian period were Mussolini's pretext to incorporate the Ionian Islands into the Kingdom of Italy. Even before the outbreak of World War II and the Greek-Italian 1940-1941 Winter War, Mussolini had expressed his wish to annex the Ionian Islands as an Italian province. After the fall of Greece in early April 1941, the Italians occupied much of the country, including the Ionians. Mussolini informed General Carlo Geloso that the Ionian Islands would form a separate Italian province through a de facto annexation, but the Germans would not approve it. Nevertheless, the Italian authorities continued to prepare the ground for the annexation. Finally, on 22 April 1941, after discussions between the German and Italian rulers, Hitler agreed that Italy could proceed with a de facto annexation of the islands. Thus on 10 August 1941 the islands of Corfu, Cephalonia, Zakynthos, Lefkada and some minor islands were officially annexed by Italy as part of the Grande Communit√† del Nuovo Impero Romano (Great Community of the New Roman Empire). As soon as the fascist governor Piero Parini had installed himself on Corfu he vigorously began a forced Italianization policy that lasted until the end of the war. The islands passed through a phase of Italianization in all areas, from their administration to their economy. Italian was designated the islands' only official language; a new currency, the Ionian drachma, was introduced with the aim to hamper trade with the rest of Greece, which was forbidden by Parini. Transportation with continental Greece was limited; in the courts, judges had to apply Italian law, and schooling followed the educational model of the Italian mainland. Greek administrative officials were replaced by Italian ones, administrative officials of non-Ionic origin were expelled, the local gendarmes were partially replaced by Italian Carabinieri, although Parini initially allowed the Greek judges to continue their work, they were ultimately replaced by an Italian Military Court based in Corfu. The \\"return to the Venetian order\\" and the italianization as pursued by Parini were even more drastic than the italianization policies elsewhere, as their aim was a forced and abrupt cessation of all cultural and historical ties with the old mother country. The only newspaper on the islands was the Italian language \\"Giornale del Popolo\\". By early 1942 pre-war politicians in the Ionian Islands began to protest Parini's harsh policies. Parini reacted by opening a concentration camp on the island of Paxi, to which two more camps were added on Othonoi and Lazaretto islands. Parini's police troops arrested about 3,500 people, which were imprisoned at these three camps. The Italianization efforts in the Ionian islands ended in September 1943, after the armistice of Cassibile. =Dodecanese islands= The twelve major islands of the Dodecanese, of which the largest is Rhodos, were ruled by Italy between 1912 and 1945. After a period of military rule, civil governors were appointed in 1923 shortly after Fascists began to rule Italy and Italians were settled on the islands. The first governor, Mario Lago, encouraged intermarriage between Italian settlers and Greeks, provided scholarships for young Greeks to study in Italy and set up a Dodecanese church to limit the influence of the Greek Orthodox Church. Fascist youth organizations were introduced on the islands, and the Italianization of names was encouraged by the Italian authorities. The islanders did, however, not receive full citizenship and were not required to serve in the Italian armed forces. The population was allowed to elect their own mayors. Lagos' successor, Cesare Maria De Vecchi, embarked on a forced Italianization campaign in 1936. The Italian language became compulsory in education and the public life, with Greek being only an optional subject in schools. In 1937 the elected mayors were replaced by appointed loyal fascists. in 1938, the new Italian Racial Laws were introduced to the islands.Aegeannet, The Dodecanese under Italian Rule =South Tyrol= In 1919, at the time of its annexation, the southern part of Tyrol was inhabited by almost 90% German speakers.Oscar Benvenuto (ed.): \\"South Tyrol in Figures 2008\\", Provincial Statistics Institute of the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol, Bozen/Bolzano 2007, p. 19, Table 11 In October 1923, the use of the Italian language became mandatory (although not exclusive) on all levels of federal, provincial and local government.Steininger, Rolf (2003), p. 23-24 Regulations by the fascist authorities required that all kinds of signs and public notices be in Italian only. Maps, postcards and other graphic material had to show Italian place names. In September 1925, Italian became the sole permissible language in courts of law. Illegal Katakombenschulen (\\"Catacomb schools\\") were set up by the local German-speaking minority to teach children the German language. The government created incentives to encourage immigration of native Italians to the South Tyrol. Several factors limited the effects of the Italian policy, namely the adverse nature of the territory (mainly mountains and valleys of difficult access), the difficulty for the Italian-speaking individuals to adapt to a completely different environment and, later on, the alliance between Germany and Italy: under the 1939 South Tyrol Option Agreement, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini determined the status of the German people living in the province. They either had to opt for emigration to Germany or stay in Italy and become fully Italianized. Because of the outbreak of World War II, this agreement was never fully implemented and most ethnic Germans remained or returned at the end of the war. Following World War II, South Tyrol was one of the first regions to be granted autonomy on the ground of its peculiar linguistic situation; any further attempts at Italianization were formerly abandoned. In the 21st century, just over 100 years after the Italian annexation of the region, 64% of the population of South Tyrol speak German dialects as their first and everyday language. =Sardinia= In 1720, the island of Sardinia had been ceded to Alpine House of Savoy, which at the time already controlled a number of other states in the Italian mainland, most notably Piedmont. The Savoyards had imposed the Italian language on Sardinia as part of a wider cultural policy designed to bind the island to the Mainland in such a way as to prevent either future attempts of political separation or curb a renewed interest on the part of Spain. In fact, the complex linguistic composition of the islanders, theretofore extraneous to Italian and its cultural sphere, had been previously roofed by Spanish as the prestige language of the upper class for centuries; in this context, Italianization, while difficult, was intended as a cultural policy whereby the social and economic structures of the island could become increasingly intertwined with the Mainland and expressly Piedmont, where the Kingdom's central power lay. The 1847 Perfect Fusion, performed with an assimilationist intentAccording to Pietro Martini, who stood at the forefront for the cause and rose to become one of its leading exponents, the Fusion may have opened the way to \\"the transplant, without any reserves and obstacles, of the culture and civilization of the Italian Mainland to Sardinia, and thereby form a single civil family under a Father better than a King, the great Charles Albert\\". () and politically analogous to the Acts of Union between Britain and Ireland, determined the conventional moment wherefrom the Sardinian language ceased to be regarded as an identity marker of a specific ethnic group, and was instead lumped in with the Mainland's dialectal conglomerate already subordinate to the national language.¬´...la ‚Äòlingua della sarda nazione‚Äô perse il valore di strumento di identificazione etnica di un popolo e della sua cultura, da codificare e valorizzare, per diventare uno dei tanti dialetti regionali subordinati alla lingua nazionale.¬ª Dettori, Antonietta, 2001. Sardo e italiano: tappe fondamentali di un complesso rapporto, in Argiolas, Mario; Serra, Roberto. Limba lingua language: lingue locali, standardizzazione e identit√† in Sardegna nell‚Äôera della globalizzazione, Cagliari, CUEC, p. 88 The jurist Carlo Baudi di Vesme, in his 1848 essay Considerazioni politiche ed economiche sulla Sardegna, stated that Sardinian was one of the most significant barriers separating the islanders from the Italian Mainland, and only the suppression of their dialects could ensure that they might understand the governmental instructions, issued in Italian, and become properly \\"civilized\\" subjects of the Savoyard Kindgom. However, it was not until the rise of fascism that Sardinian was actively banned and/or excluded from any residual cultural activities to enforce a thorough shift to Italian.¬´Dopo pisani e genovesi si erano susseguiti aragonesi di lingua catalana, spagnoli di lingua castigliana, austriaci, piemontesi ed, infine, italiani [...] Nonostante questi impatti linguistici, la \\"limba sarda\\" si mantiene relativamente intatta attraverso i secoli.

(2010). La Sardegna durante il ventennio fascista After the end of the Second World War, efforts continued to be made to further Italianize the population, with the justification that by doing so, as the principles of the modernization theory ran, the island could rid itself of the ancient \\"traditional practices\\" which held it back, regarded as a legacy of barbarism to be disposed of at once in order to join the Mainland's economic growth; Italianization had thus become a mass phenomenon, taking roots in the hitherto predominantly Sardinian-speaking villages. To many Sardinians, abandoning their language and acquiring Italian as a cultural norm represented a means through which they could distance themselves from their original group, which they perceived as marginalized and lacking in prestige, and thereby incorporate themselves into an altogether different social group.¬´Come conseguenza dell‚Äôitalianizzazione dell‚Äôisola ‚Äì a partire dalla seconda met√† del XVIII secolo ma con un‚Äôaccelerazione dal secondo dopoguerra ‚Äì si sono verificati i casi in cui, per un lungo periodo e in alcune fasce della popolazione, si √® interrotta la trasmissione transgenerazionale delle variet√† locali.

Many indigenous cultural practices were to go extinct, shifting towards other forms of socialization. Within a few generations Sardinian, as well as Alghero's Catalan dialect, would become a minority language spoken by fewer and fewer Sardinian families, the majority of whom have turned into monolingual and monocultural Italians.¬´Gli effetti di una italianizzazione esasperata - iniziata e voluta dai Savoia fin dal lontano 1861 con l'Unit√† d'Italia - riprendevano fiato e vigore, mentre il vocabolario sardo andava ormai alleggerendosi, tagliando molti di quei termini perch√© non pi√π appropriati alla tecnologia emergente o perch√© lontani dalla dalla mentalit√† e dall'azione delle nuove generazioni che andavano ormai identificandosi nella lingua e nella cultura imposte dal \\"sistema\\" italiano, che ignorava la lingua e la cultura dei nostri padri.¬ª Melis Onnis, Giovanni (2014).

In Tanzania, Braeburn School, Arusha is run under the Tanzanian company Braeburn Schools Tanzania Limited. Braeburn School was started in 1968 as a primary school by an English lady who called it Braeburn House International School. Braeburn Limited bought this its first school in 1979 and simplified the name. Braeburn High School was started in 1982 at a campus just outside Nairobi called Garden Estate as a boarding school offering IGCSE examinations. When the high school moved to the Braeburn School‚Äôs Lavington campus in September 2003, the Garden Estate campus became a boarding Sixth form college. Braeburn College offers a foundation-year bridging course from Kenyan KCSE to international A Levels, AS and A Level courses, the International Baccalaureate (IB), and BTEC National and Higher National Diploma courses. Braeside School was opened in 1994 as an 8-4-4 system Kenyan private primary school. The buildings were designed to take three streams of classes, from Standards 1 to 8. In 1996 the school was changed to follow the British National Curriculum. This same year, Braeburn entered into an agreement with the University of Warwick to provide training for local teachers in the form of a Bachelor of Philosophy (Education) through a Continuing Professional Development programme. The first 13 students started in 1997, graduating in 2000. This new programme allowed Braeburn to staff Braeside School with local Kenyan teachers who were well-versed with the British National Curriculum. Also in 1996, Braeside High School came into existence, also culminating in IGCSE examinations done through the CIE. Braeburn‚Äôs interest in Tanzania came about in 1999 through the acquisition of a small private international school in Arusha, which was at the time called St. George‚Äôs School. Braeburn changed the name to Braeburn School, Arusha, and introduced A Levels in 2005. In 2007 administration of Braeburn School, Arusha was put under the new company Braeburn Schools Tanzania Limited. This company was formed to enable the group to expand further into Tanzania. In September 2004, Braeburn took over the management of Mombasa International School, based in Shanzu, north of Mombasa. In line with its other schools, Braeburn introduced A Levels to the school at the start of the 2005-2006 academic year. In April 2006, a small international primary school in Kisumu established in 1985, Kisumu International School. This school has been expanded to include all year groups from Early Years to Year 8, teaching the British National Curriculum. In 2008, the group acquired the Podo School in Nanyuki, and renamed the school to Braeburn Nanyuki International School. The group acquired the Imani School in Thika in 2010, after purchasing the land from Del Monte. The school was renamed Braeburn Imani International School.

The long ancient Olympic stadium is at far right. The Temple of Hera, or Heraion, is an ancient Archaic Greek temple at Olympia, Greece, that was dedicated to Hera, queen of the Greek Gods. It was the oldest temple at Olympia and one of the most venerable in all Greece. It was originally a joint temple of Hera and Zeus, chief of the gods, until a separate temple was built for him. It is at the altar of this temple, which is oriented east-west, that the Olympic flame is lit and carried to all parts of the world. The torch of the Olympic flame is lit in its ruins to this day. The temple was built in approximately 590 BC, but was destroyed by an earthquake in the early 4th century CE. History Plan of the Temple of Hera. (A: Peristyle; B: Pronaos; C: Naos; D: Opisthodomos; E: Base of Statue of Hermes). The Heraion at Olympia, located in the north of the sacred precinct, the Altis, is one of the earliest Doric temples in Greece, and the oldest peripteral temple at that site, having a single row of columns on all sides. The location may have previously been the place of worship of an older cult. The temple was erected in around 590 BC, most likely as a dedication by the Triphylian polis of Skillous. It is suggested that this dedication by a nearby city would originally have been in honour of the main patron deity at Olympia, Hera, and rededicated to include Zeus, her husband and brother, at a later point‚Äîperhaps after 580 BC when control of Olympia had passed from Triphylia to Elis, or in the 5th century BC when the famous Temple of Zeus was built. The temple was closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. In the Archaic Greek time period, the temple stored items important to Greek culture, and other offerings of the people. Description =Layout= The temple measures at the level of the temple platform, the stylobate. It was longer and narrower than the common architecture of the previous era, though the elongated proportions are a common feature of early Doric architecture. It has a peripteros ‚Äî a colonnaded perimeter ‚Äî of 6 by 16 columns which were originally wooden because those were the materials available at the time. The travel writer Pausanias described it in his Description of Greece: :It remains after this for me to describe the temple of Hera [at Olympia] and the noteworthy objects contained in it. The Elean account says that it was the people of Skillos, one of the cities in Triphylia, who built the temple about eight years after Oxylos came to the throne of Elis. The style of the temple is Doric, and pillars stand all round it. In the rear chamber one of the two pillars is of oak. The length of the temple is one hundred and sixty-nine feet, the breadth sixty-three feet, the height not short of fifty feet. Who the architect was they do not relate.Pausanias, Description of Greece 5. 16. 1 - 8 =Columns= Doric columns of the Temple of Hera A long-standing theory holds that the columns were only gradually replaced with stone ones due to the wood rotting out, and other natural and man-made events. In the second century AD, one of the two columns in the opisthodomos was still oak. As the replacements took place at widely differing periods between the Archaic and Roman periods, and were carved under the influence of their respective contemporary styles, they differ considerably in proportions and detail. This becomes apparent in the columns' capitals, as each one is slightly different from the next. Another theory holds that the columns are so different, not because wooden columns were being replaced, but because various workshops erected different stone columns at the same time. Perhaps each style represented the major city-states or private donors for whom these builders were working, as Olympia was a pan-Doric sanctuary. No remains of the entablature above the columns were found, but are believed to have been wooden. =Walls and roof= The walls had a bottom course of stone with a mudbrick superstructure, another feature typical of early Greek architecture. Other parts of the temple were made from limestone, unbaked bricks, and terracotta tiles. Holes in the protrusions at the ends of the walls‚Äîantae‚Äîindicate that a wooden cladding protected them from the elements. The temple had a Laconian-style roof; its pediments were decorated with disk acroteria of diameter, each made in one single piece (one is on display at the Archaeological Museum of Olympia). =Contents= The opisthodomos was also used to store numerous other objects, including many further statues of deities and votive offerings of Zeus and Hera. Among the few of these objects to survive was a statue of Hermes holding baby Dionysos, which is generally identified as the Hermes of Praxiteles, one of the most important preserved examples of Greek sculpture. Pausanias also witnessed a small ivory-clad couch (purportedly once belonging to Hippodameia), the bronze disc of Iphitus of Elis (commemorating the truce that according to legend founded the Olympic games), and the table on which the olive wreaths for the victors were displayed during the Olympic Games. Pausanias recounts a number of objects beside the cult statues: :In the temple of Hera [at Olympia] is an image of Zeus, and the image of Hera is sitting on a throne with Zeus standing by her, bearded and with a helmet on his head. They are crude works of art. The figures of Horai (Seasons) next to them, seated upon thrones, were made by the Aeginetan Smilis. Beside them stands an image of Themis, as being mother of the Horai. It is the work of Dorykleidas . . . The Hesperides, five in number, were made by Theokles . . . The Athena wearing a helmet and carrying a spear and shield is, it is said, a work of Medon . . . Then Kore (the Maid) and Demeter sit opposite each other, while Apollon and Artemis stand opposite each other. Here too have been dedicated Leto, Tykhe (Fortune), Dionysos and a winged Nike (Victory). I cannot say who the artists were, but these figures too are in my opinion very ancient. The figures I have enumerated are of ivory and gold, but at a later date other images were dedicated in the Heraion, including a marble Hermes carrying the baby Dionysos, a work of Praxiteles, and a bronze Aphrodite made by Kleon of Sikyon . . . A nude gilded child is seated before Aphrodite, a work fashioned by Boithos of Kalkhedon. There were also brought hither from what is called the Philippeon other images of gold and ivory, Eurydike the wife of Aridaios and Olympias the wife of Philip. There is also a chest made of cedar [the chest of Kypselos], with figures on it, some of ivory, some of gold, others carved out of the cedar-wood itself . . . There are here other offerings also : a couch of no great size and for the most part adorned with ivory; the quoit of Iphitos; a table on which are set out the crowns for the victors. The couch is said to have been a toy of Hippodameia. The quoit of Iphitos has inscribed upon it the truce which the Eleans proclaim at the Olympic festivals; the inscription is not written in a straight line, but the letters run in a circle round the quoit. The table is made of ivory and gold, and is the work of Kolotes . . . There are figures of Hera, Zeus, the Mother of the gods, Hermes, and Apollon with Artemis. Behind is the disposition of the games. On one side are Asklepios and Hygeia (Health), one of his daughters; Ares too and Agon (Contest) by his side; on the other are Plouton, Dionysos, Persephone and Nymphai, one of them carrying a ball.Pausanias, Description of Greece 5. 17. 1 - 5 & 20\\\\. 1 - 3 The table of Colotes The table was made with ivory and gold, and was sculpted by Colotes. It displayed the figures of Hera, Zeus, Rhea, Hermes, Apollo, and Artemis in front of the Games. On one side was Asclepius and his daughter Aceso, and Ares and the Olympian spirit of contest Agon. On the other were Pluto, Dionysos, Persephone and nymphs. The table bore the olive wreaths awarded to victors at the ancient Olympic Games The statue Hermes and the Infant Dionysos The Chest of Cypselus The temple contained a cedar chest () in which Cypselus, the tyrant of Corinth was reportedly hidden by his mother. The chest was reportedly dedicated at Olympia in gratitude to the gods, and so, according to folktale, Cypselus gained his name. According to Dio Chrysostom in the 1st century AD, the chest was found in the opisthodomos. The chest had various mythological figures inscribed on it in ivory, gold, or in the wood of the chest itself. Accompanying many of the figures were inscriptions in Corinthian (Doric) indicating their identity, some of the text being written boustrophedon in alternating directions. Legacy Set apart from the temple at its eastern side is the Altar of Hera, where the Olympic flame has been lit since 1936 using a parabolic mirror to concentrate the rays of the sun. The temple was depicted on the reverse of the Greek 1000 drachmae banknote of 1987‚Äì2001. The Jasmine Hill Gardens at Wetumpka, Alabama (United States), contains a full-sized replica of the (ruined) Temple of Hera.

Internal view of the nave. The Basilica of Sant'Abbondio is a Romanesque-style 11th-century Roman Catholic basilica church located in Como, region of Lombardy, Italy. Description The current edifice rises over a pre-existing 5th century Palaeo-Christian church entitled to Sts. Peter and Paul, built by order of St. Amantius of Como, third bishop of the city. Erected c. 1 km outside the city's walls, it was intended to house several relics of the two saints which Amantius had brought from Rome. The basilica acted as bishop's seat until 1007. Six years later bishop Alberic moved the seat within the walls. The basilica was then entrusted to the Benedictines who, between 1050 and 1095, rebuilt it in Romanesque style. The new edifice was dedicated to Amantius' successor, Abundius. The structures of the Palaeo- Christian church, discovered in 1863 during a restoration, are still marked by black and pale marble stones in the pavement. The new basilica had a nave and four aisles. It was consecrated by pope Urban II on June 3, 1095. The church has two notable bell towers rising at the end of the external aisles, in the middle of the nave. The sober fa√ßade, once preceded by a portico, has seven windows and a portal. Notable is the external decoration of the choir's windows. There are also Romanesque bas-reliefs and, in the apse, a notable cycle of mid-14th-century frescoes. Under the high altar are the Abundius' relics. The medieval monastery annexed to the church, recently restored, acts as the seat of the local faculty of Jurisprudence.

Biography Shonandai Bunka Center Itsuko Hasegawa was born in Yaizu City, Japan in 1941. She studied at the Department of Architecture at Kanto Gakuin University, graduating in 1964. From then until 1969, she worked with Kiyonori Kikutake and then spent two years studying at Tokyo Institute of Technology. From 1971-78 she worked under Kazuo Shinohara at the institute. She has lectured in Rotterdam, Australia, Norway and Los Angeles between 1984-7. She became the principal of her own design studio in Tokyo, called Itsuko Hasegawa Architectural Design Studio in 1976, which was renamed the Architectural Design Studio in 1979. In 1987, Hasegawa won first prize in a competition to design the Shonandai Cultural Centre. Initially, the design was not popular among the local residents, who were concerned on how the building would be buried below ground level. However, Hasegawa had many discussions with the residents, and when the opening phase of construction began in late 1989, the building was met with unanimous approval. In the summer of 1989, Hasegawa completed a design for the 270-seat theatre for the temporary four-month Nagoya Design exhibition. Hasegawa won an open competition for the design of the Niigata Performing Arts Centre. The project contains a 1,900-seat concert hall, a 900-seat theatre, and a 375-seat Noh theatre, and is surrounded by an eight-hectare landscape. The venue was constructed atop reclaimed land that used to be part of the Shinano River. Hasegawa is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and has received the Avon Arts Award, the Building Contractor's Society Prize for the Shonandai Cultural Center, the Cultural Award for Residential Architecture (Fukuoka, Japan), and a Design Prize from the Architectural Institute of Japan.

Life He was the eldest son of King Alexander I of Kakheti by his wife Queen Ana. He is reported by the Georgian chronicles to have been extremely grasping and ambitious and to have had frequent conflicts with his peace-loving father, insisting that Alexander made war upon the rival Bagrationi branch presiding over Kakheti‚Äôs western neighbor, the Kingdom of Kartli. Also, he was suspicious of his younger brother, Demetre, whom Alexander had entrusted an important diplomatic mission to the Shah of Iran, Ismail I. On April 27, 1511, George murdered Alexander, had Demetre blinded, and seized the crown. Immediately after his accession to the throne, George II organized an expedition against Kartli, and attempted to depose King David X. David‚Äôs brother, Bagrat I, Prince of Mukhrani, who led the successful defense of the kingdom, was rewarded with the castle of Mukhrani, thus founding a long-lasting branch of Bagration-Mukhraneli. In 1513, George II made another incursion into Kartli, but was again defeated and ambushed by Bagrat‚Äôs men on his route back to Kakheti. George was put in the Mtveri castle where he was soon killed. Kakheti was briefly annexed to Kartli.Mikaberidze, Alexander (2007). Giorgi II (Kakheti). Dictionary of Georgian National Biography.

Bishop Hill was the site of a utopian religious community which operated as a commune. It was founded in 1846 by Swedish pietist Eric Janson and his followers. The community was named Bishop Hill after the parish of Biskopskulla in Uppland, Sweden. History Steeple Building. Photo taken June 1976. Founded in 1846 by religious dissidents who emigrated from Sweden to establish a new way of life on the Illinois prairie, the colony was run as a commune until its dissolution in 1861. The Bishop Hill Colony was the landmark Swedish settlement in Western Illinois leading the large Swedish- American communities in Galesburg, Rock Island, and Chicago. Its archives, artifacts, and structures today are important documents for the study of immigration, ethnic heritage, and 19th century communitarian societies.\\" A number of historically significant buildings have survived and are scattered throughout the village, four of which are owned by the state of Illinois and managed as part of the Bishop Hill State Historic Site. In addition to the historic structures, the state owns the village park with a gazebo and memorials to the town‚Äôs early settlers and Civil War soldiers. A brick museum building houses a valuable collection of folk art paintings by colonist Olof Krans. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1984.. In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, Bishop Hill Colony was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois). =Erik Janson= The village was founded led by Erik Janson. Prior to founding the Bishop Hill Colony, Jansson preached to his followers in Sweden about what he considered to be the abominations of the Lutheran Church and emphasized the doctrine that the faithful were without sin. As Jansson's ideas became more radical, he began to lose support from many of his sympathizers and was forced to leave Sweden in the midst of growing persecution. Jansson had previously sent Olof Olsson, a trusted follower, as an emissary to the United States to find a suitable location where the Janssonists could set up a utopian community centered around their religious beliefs. According to Jansson, this community would become the \\"New Jerusalem\\", and their beliefs would soon spread across the world. As a result, 1400 colonists emigrated from Sweden to their new home in western Illinois. The colony struggled early on after its founding. Many of the first 1000 colonists died from disease on the way to Bishop Hill (named for Eric Jansson's birthplace, Biskopskulla), while others became disillusioned and stayed in New York. The quarters in Bishop Hill were cold and crowded and food was scarce. After the first winter, life at the colony began to improve. In the next few years housing was upgraded from dugouts to brick living areas, and crops were planted on of land. By 1849, Bishop Hill had constructed a flour mill, two sawmills, a three-story frame church, and various other buildings. The Bishop Hill Colony was communistic in nature, as dictated by Jansson. Thus, everything was owned by everyone and no one had more possessions than another. Work in the colony was highly rigorous and regimented. It wasn't uncommon to see hundreds of people working together in the fields or large groups of laborers engaged in other tasks.

Biography Ephraim belonged to a prominent family of scholars, which included Eliezer ben Nathan, to whom he addressed questions, and Leontin ben Jacob. He had two brothers, Hillel and Kalonymus, both of whom he outlived. As a boy of thirteen he witnessed the bloody persecutions to which the Jews on the Rhine were subjected, and, with many other Jews, found refuge from the fury of the mob in the castle of Wolkenburg, near K√∂nigswinter, in the archbishopric of Cologne. Later he lived at Neuss, and left there for Cologne only a few days before the massacre of 1187. He lost, however, on this occasion, a large part of his fortune. He seems to have resided usually at Worms. He later studied in Bonn under Joel ben Isaac ha-Levi. Works =Halacha= Ephraim was one of the important German Talmudists of his time, although comparatively little is known of his work in the field of halakhah. He frequently wrote responsa in conjunction with Judah ben Kalonymus, Moses ben Mordechai, and Baruch ben Samuel; several of them are quoted in the Mordechai; but the \\"·∏§ibbur\\" mentioned in the Mordechai is not by him, but by Ephraim ben Nathan. =Liturgy= Ephraim is better known as a liturgical poet. Zunz enumerates twenty-three of his piyyutim, several of which are found in German and Polish liturgies. For instance, his \\"Elohim Tzivita Lididecha\\" and \\"HaRachaman Hu Asher Hanan\\" are still recited in Germany on the occasion of a circumcision. Ephraim was, perhaps, the last German rabbi to compose poems in Aramaic for the synagogue, his selihah \\"Ta Shema\\" being especially well known. This piyyut is a mosaic containing forty-five lines, a combination of Aramaic expressions and phrases used in the Talmud. His Hebrew piyyutim are frequently acrostic compositions with a Talmudic phraseology, and are therefore in many cases obscure and ungraceful. He had wit and a great command of both Hebrew and Aramaic. In almost all his poems he alludes to the persecutions and to the martyrs of Judaism. He also wrote a commentary on the earlier portions of the Machzor, which became the chief source for the similar work of a compiler at the beginning of the fourteenth century, and which is extant in manuscript in Hamburg.Steinschneider, \\"Cat. der Hebr√§ischen Handschriften in der Stadtbibliothek zu Hamburg,\\" p. 57 =History= Ephraim's account of the persecutions of the Jews in Germany, France, and England, between 1146 and 1196, is of great historical value. It is in a great measure the record of his own experiences, which are related impartially, and is among the most valuable of the documents used by medieval chronographers in their history of the persecutions during the period of the Crusades. It was printed for the first time as an appendix to Wiener's German translation of Joseph ha-Kohen's \\"Eme·∏≥ ha-Bacha\\" (Leipzig, 1858), and translated into German by S. Baer in \\"Hebr√§ische Berichte √ºber die Judenverfolgungen W√§hrend der Kreuzz√ºge,\\" (Berlin, 1892).

Arthur Meade was the second, but eldest surviving, son of Admiral of the Fleet Richard Meade, 4th Earl of Clanwilliam, and Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Arthur Kennedy GCMG CB, governor of various colonies including Queensland, Hong Kong and Vancouver Island. Military career He was educated at Eton and joined the Royal Horse Guards. On the outbreak of the Second Boer War he served with his regiment in South Africa, becoming a captain in 1900. He was mentioned in despatches (31 March 1900), and was severely wounded, after which he served as Assistant Provost Marshal and Staff Captain. In early 1902 he was seconded to serve with the 30th Battalion, Imperial Yeomanry, as second-in-command with the temporary rank of major. The battalion left Southampton for South Africa in early May, but arrived after the end of hostilities the following month. Meade left South Africa shortly thereafter, on the SS Sardinia, which arrived at Southampton in October 1902. After a short time in India as an extra ADC to the viceroy, Lord Curzon, he returned to England in 1904 and served as adjutant of the Royal Horse Guards until 1907, retiring and becoming a captain on the Reserve of Officers on his marriage in 1909.

Nearby is the village of Stoneleigh, Warwickshire. The Abbey itself is a Grade I listed building. History In 1154 Henry II granted land in the Forest of Arden to a group of Cistercians from Staffordshire. There are various traces remaining of the original Abbey buildings, most notably the 14th-century Gatehouse. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the estate was acquired by Sir Thomas Leigh, Lord Mayor of London in 1558. Charles I gave Leigh the barony for his offering hospitality when the gates of Coventry were closed to the king during the English Civil War. A house was built (which now forms the north and east wings of the present house) on the site of the monastic buildings. It was the home of the Leigh family from 1561 to 1990. In due course the Leigh family became the largest land owner in Warwickshire. The north and east wings of the house The facade of the West Wing Between 1714 and 1726 a new palatial four-storey fifteen-bay wing was built to designs by architect Francis Smith of Warwick. The result was an impressive baroque West Wing, built of silver-coloured stone, which was fashionable at that time. The Abbey's remarkable feature is the Saloon, one of the great interiors of Georgian England. Andor Gomme referred to it as \\"almost the swan song of baroque figurative plasterwork in England\\". The Saloon From the view over the River Avon we can see some of the changes introduced by Humphry Repton. During his time he was well known for his works at several large country houses. In 1806 the estate passed to Rev. Thomas Leigh. He came to view his inheritance, bringing with him his cousin Cassandra Austen and her two daughters, Cassandra and Jane. Jane Austen writes of Repton as the gardener making changes to the grounds at the fictional Sotherton Court in Mansfield Park. When he undertook the works at Stoneleigh, he hoped to create an arcade on the side of the house overlooking the river. That never came to fruition, however he did redirect the river (Avon) and flood a section of the river to create a mirror lake. When viewed from a raised platform across the river, the house is perfectly reflected in the surface of the water. There were two small parterres in front of this side of the house where the grass is now, along with other features of the grounds that can be viewed by walking along the paths (wilderness, mill bridge, weirs, etc.) The adjacent stables and riding school block and the conservatory are separately listed as Grade II*. Up until the early 1800s, this side of the house would have looked out on a yard with sheds, pigsties, and other ‚Äòunsightly‚Äô outbuildings. It was during this time that considerations for the health of residents saw the outbuildings move away from the house. This opened up a good view from the new West Wing, and allowed space for the creation of a cricket pitch. William Henry Leigh's second son Edward Chandos was an avid cricket player, and was delighted when his father allowed the pitch to be built. It is said that Lord Leigh would give a silver sixpence to any boy who could break a window of the house with a ball. It is still used today by Stoneleigh Cricket club and has been voted the most beautiful cricket pitch in England by Wisden. One of the rooms of the West Wing hosts the bust of Byron by Edward Hodges Baily. Chandos Leigh and Lord Byron were school friends at Harrow and dined together on the day before Byron left England for the last time in April 1816. Queen Victoria stayed in Stoneleigh Abbey for two nights in 1858. Victoria was given a suite of five rooms with mahogany furniture painted white and gold, since William Henry Leigh was told this was the Queen's preference.  Modern times  In 1946 Stoneleigh Abbey was one of the first stately homes to open its doors to the public. In 1960 a disastrous fire did extensive damage to the West Wing. In 1996 Lord Leigh transferred the ownership of Stoneleigh Abbey and its grounds to a charitable trust, the Stoneleigh Abbey Preservation Trust, of which he himself was the Trustee. Between 1996 and 2000 it was extensively renovated with the help of grants including a ¬£7.3 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and additional grants of more than ¬£3 million from English Heritage fund and the European Union.Mark Thomas Product Series 2, Episode 5 on Channel 4 More than 1,000 tonnes of Grinshill stone were used to restore the exterior of the West Wing and up to 45 stonemasons were employed during the main stage of the work. The upstairs floors were initially converted into flats by Kit Martin and houses and apartments were established in the West Wing, South Wing and East Wing. The money received by the original Preservation charitable trust was the subject of an episode of The Mark Thomas Comedy Product, which proved that some of the trust's debts were paid using the National Lottery money earmarked for restoration, as well as paying for private development. With the failure of the preservation trust under Lord Leigh, a new independent charitable trust was set up to safeguard the future of the Abbey. With the ties to Lord Leigh severed, the new charitable trust acquired a new chairman, local business man Tony Bird OBE. In the early 2000s Charles Church built two groups of houses in the grounds of Stoneleigh Abbey, named The Cunnery and Grovehurst Park. The property remains open to the public. The former Orangery now houses a tea room. A historic pump house and water wheel at Stoneleigh Abbey has been restored to its former glory as part of a large restoration project to save and protect structures in the grounds, along with reinstating many of the views and walks inspired by Sir Humphry Repton's designs from his Red Book also on display at the Abbey. Mr Tony Bird OBE Chairman of the Stoneleigh Abbey Charitable Trust has overseen the full restoration not only of the large wheel but also the full restoration of the 1851 Tangye of Birmingham water pump. The repairs to the Pump House were partly funded by Natural England, including replacement of the roof, years of lime scale being chipped off, and the water wheel itself restored. Stoneleigh Abbey Trustee Dorothy Ingle said: ‚ÄúIt is wonderful to see the wheel turning and people being able to see how the pump house was used now fully restored to its former glory. The wheel doesn‚Äôt pump water to the house any more but it still represents part of the history of how the garden and house was operated 100 years ago.\\" The pump-house was built in 1851 on the site of the Abbey's former medieval water mill on the River Avon. Visitors can now see the restored pump house as part of the Abbey's country park.  A historical inquiry  In 2016, Judy Stove, an Australian researcher into the life and times of Jane Austen, published a book (The Missing Monument Murders, Waterside Press) which investigates a series of scandals at Stoneleigh Abbey in the first half of the nineteenth century. Inheritance contests led to claims about the unauthorized removal of monuments from Stoneleigh village church. It was even alleged that a number of witnesses might have been murdered in the period 1812‚Äì1815 ‚Äì within the lifetime of Jane Austen herself. In 1848, Austen's relative Chandos, first Lord Leigh of the second creation (1791‚Äì1850), a Romantic poet and Whig essayist, was charged with two of the murders. Stove examines court transcripts and newspaper accounts from the time, which named the bridge, designed by Scottish engineer John Rennie (1761‚Äì1821) and built over the River Avon west of Stoneleigh Abbey, as the possible site of the murder of the workmen. The Rennie bridge still forms the main approach for visitors to Stoneleigh Abbey.

Origins Born in Leeds, Yorkshire on 27 September 1938, Arthur Metcalfe was the second of three brothers born to a cycling family. His father was a cycle-tourist. The family moved to Hartlepool when Arthur was 14. He was described then as a weak child. There he joined Hartlepool Cycling Club. On his second day as a member he rode the club's 25-mile (40 km) time trial, \\"leaving many of his contemporaries trailing.\\"Obituary, Cycling December 2002 Amateur career Metcalfe - known among fellow professionals as \\"the snake\\" for his talent in wriggling into the winning break of a race \\\\- was handicapped at first by two years' compulsory national service with the army. He, like his brother Ken, was a military policeman in Cyprus.Daily Telegraph, 20 December 2002, Obituary, Arthur Metcalfe He soon made a name on leaving the army at 21 and in 1962 came 23rd in his first ride in the Tour of Britain, known then as the Milk Race. In 1964 he took the race yellow jersey after winning alone in the stage to Cardiff and he held the lead to the finish in Blackpool. He was celebrated for the long, lone attacks he often made through hilly countryside. His obituary in the Daily Telegraph described him as \\"always physically tough and tactically astute.\\" In the same year, he also won two stages of the Tour du St Laurent in Canada. The British enthusiast, Mike Breckon, who saw Metcalfe in that race, said: :\\"It was a world-class field and over tough terrain. The British team had a tough time with crashes and punctures. But then Arthur decided to do something about it. On the last four stages of the race he finished first, sixth, first and third... Including a display of climbing... which left some of the world's best riders grovelling.\\" In 1965 he won 23 times, including the Manx International, three laps of the Snaefell mountain course on the Isle of Man. Living once more in Leeds, he cycled from there to Liverpool, slept in a telephone box and then caught the ferry to the island.Michael Breckon, funeral address, 20 December 2002 In 1966 he won the national amateur road race championship and, as an afterthought, the BBAR with a record average speed of 24.797 mph. The BBAR aggregated speeds of riders over 50 miles, 100 miles and 12 hours and specialist time-triallists usually devote their whole season to it. Metcalfe won in three straight rides, almost as an afterthought. \\"I remember thinking I needed a change. I'd ridden a few time trials in the past and so I thought I'd have another go,\\" he said.Unique double, Cycling, 5 October 1991 Professional career Having done all he could in Britain as an amateur, he turned professional in 1967 for Carlton Cycles, part of the Raleigh group of companies. The British professional scene was expanding but there was still little money and Metcalfe worked in Carlton's offices at Worksop, although he was allowed two mornings a week to train.Cycling 22 December 2001 Months later he rode the Tour de France during a break from work, a fact that persuaded French journalists that all the British team were similarly riding in their holidays. In 1967 and 1968 the Tour was open to national rather than the usual commercially-sponsored teams that had made up the race since 1930. Britain's true professionals - Tom Simpson, Barry Hoban, Vin Denson and Michael Wright - all rode full-time and for well-established teams on the Continent. Metcalfe was one of a few less-prepared riders chosen from Britain to make up the numbers. Nevertheless, Metcalfe finished 69th in 1967, when he dedicated his services and therefore his ambitions to Simpson, the team's only likely winner. Simpson died on the 13th stage of the race as he was climbing Mont Ventoux. Metcalfe and the rest of the team voted to continue. Metcalfe said: \\"I was in a right state. I just stood on my own all night. I was crying. It was the emotional strain on top of the physical strain. There was a lot of talk about whether we should pull out. [The manager, Alec Taylor] felt we should stay in, so we just rode on. The rest of the race was a blur.\\" Fotheringham, Will (2005), Roule Britannia, Yellow Jersey, UK Metcalfe rode the Tour again in 1968, heading the race alone on the stage to Bayonne and winning a prize as the day's most combative rider. He abandoned the Tour just before the end. After the Tour Metcalfe broke his pelvis in 1971, ending his career as a professional. He and a fellow professional, Wes Mason of Sheffield, opened a business building racing-cycle frames in a former chapel in Harrogate, Yorkshire. The building, Chapel Works, was owned by a cycle importer, Ron Kitching, and their combined initials gave the project's name: MKM. The company had the British licence to build frames under the name of the Tour de France winner, Jacques Anquetil. MKM operated until the late 1970s. Ron Kitching said: :They were both keen on bicycle manufacturing. Wes was a good frame builder and Arthur was sure that he could handle the marketing. I went so far as to buy the premises - an old chapel on Skipton Road, and agreed to the company's name, MKM. But I decided in the end not to become involved in the venture. Imagine being sandwiched between two crafty bike-riders like that! In the end it was the right decision, they fell out and the business failed. I was left with the property.Breckon, Mike (1993), A Wheel in Two Worlds, privately published, UK Metcalfe said of the modern Tour de France that it was too short, that it should be \\"a proper length\\" - 2,500 miles. :To ride 90 miles a day is not the legend of the Tour de France. The philosophy of the Tour is that it's an epic of courage. We had stages of 233km. Sure, they go 2mph faster now, but you'd expect that. And there are 70 more riders. I was working for Carlton Cycles. British riders are all full-time pros now and they're better than ever we were, so they can ride further. The argument is that they want a clean Tour. But you can ride 2,500 miles clean. The race may go 1mph slower but from the roadside you'd never notice it. You can't see a difference that small.Woodland, Les (2005), This Island Race, Mousehold Press, UK South Africa The broken pelvis took two years to mend. By then, Metcalfe had been reinstated as an amateur by the British Cycling Federation (BCF). He moved to South Africa for work and won the Rapport Tour, a stage race. South Africa was still in the apartheid era and excluded from world sport. For riding the race, Metcalfe was suspended by the British Cycling Federation. Metcalfe was bitter about the suspension until the end of his life. Because he had also coached young riders while he was in South Africa, he said: \\"You think they would have given me a medal for that, not a suspension.\\" After racing Metcalfe served his suspension, then began riding again with Hartlepool cycling club, setting records for 100 miles and 12 hours that still stood at his death. Metcalfe was a manager of the Carlton professional team for which he had once ridden and in 1987 managed the British professional team in the Milk Race. He worked as an insurance salesman and financial adviser in Leeds. He remained a cyclist and said six months before his death that his cancer had been diagnosed after he had seen a doctor because he could suddenly no longer ride as fast as he could. He died in Harrogate on 11 December 2002 just months before moving to France with his third wife, Anne. A mass ride is held in Yorkshire in his memory.

The Illustrated AZ of over 10000 garden plants and how to cultivate them\\", p. 691. K√∂nemann, 2004. Originally native to Mexico, Central America, Colombia and Venezuela, it has been widely cultivated in subtropical and tropical climates worldwide and is a popular garden and park plant, as well as being used in temples and cemeteries. It grows as a spreading tree to high and wide, and is flushed with fragrant flowers of shades of pink, white and yellow over the summer and autumn. Plumeria rubra was one of the many species first described by Carl Linnaeus, and appeared in the 1753 edition of Species Plantarum. Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin ruber \\"red\\". The epithets acuminata, acutifolia, and lutea are seen, but these are invalid. Its common names include frangipani, red paucipan, red-jasmine, red frangipani, common frangipani, temple tree, or simply plumeria. Common names The common name ‚Äúfrangipani‚Äù comes from an Italian noble family, a sixteenth-century marquess of which invented a plumeria-scented perfume. The genus name honors Charles Plumier, who was a French monk of the Franciscan order, and a botanist. In Mexico the common name is cacalox√≥chitl or cacalox√∫chitl. The name comes from Nahuatl and means ‚Äúcrow‚Äôs flower‚Äù. P. rubra was declared the national flower of Nicaragua in 1971, where it is known as sacuanjoche. In Spanish, frangipanis are also referred to as alhel√≠, alhel√≠ cimarr√≥n, and suche. The term melia is a Hawaiian one. In the Cook Islands, it is known as tipani. It is grown extensively in southern and western parts of India, where it is named champa or a derivative thereof such as chaaphaa, champige etc. It is also referred to as champa in Pakistan. In Cambodia it is given the names ch√¢mp√©i krah√¢:m (also romanised as krahom, meaning 'red'), or ch√¢mp√©i sl√ºk sru√´ch, while the French term for the species is frangipanier √† fleurs rouges.Dy Phon Pauline, 2000, Plants Used In Cambodia, printed by Imprimerie Olympic, Phnom Penh. In Sri Lanka, it is known as araliya in Sinhalese. It is known by many names in Brazil, including jasmim-de-caiena, jasmin-do-par√°, and jasmin-manga. Another name it has in Portuguese is flor- de-Santo-Ant√¥nio. In Myanmar, it is referred to as mawk-sam-ka, mawk-sam- pailong, and sonpabataing. In China, it has the common name ji dan hua, and in the United States, it is referred to as nosegay. Description Plumeria rubra belongs to the dogbane family and grows as a spreading shrub or small tree to a height of and similar width. It has a thick succulent trunk and sausage-like blunt branches covered with a thin grey bark. The branches are somewhat brittle and when broken, ooze a white latex that can be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes. This latex found in the stem of the plants is in fact toxic, but not deadly unless present in large quantities. The large green leaves can reach long and are arranged alternately and clustered at the end of the branches.The boles of these plants can be up to 25 cm in the wild. It tends to be smaller in cultivation. They are deciduous, falling in the cooler months of the year. The flowers are terminal, appearing at the ends of branches over the summer. Often profuse and very prominent, they are strongly fragrant, and have five petals. The flowers give off their fragrance in the morning and in the evening. This fragrance is similar to that of rose, citrus, and cinnamon. The colors range from the common pink to white with shades of yellow in the centre of the flower. Initially tubular before opening out, the flowers are in diameter, and only rarely go on to produce seed - 20-60 winged seeds are contained in a pod. The fruits are cylindrical pods that are rarely found in cultivation. Distribution and habitat Its native range extends from central Mexico south through Central America to Colombia and Venezuela in South America. It is cultivated in the tropical regions of the world, and is perhaps naturalized in some parts of India. More specifically, P. rubra is cultivated in the lowlands and the Yungas in Bolivia, the coastal and Andean regions of Ecuador, and the Amazonian and Andean regions of Peru, where it inhabits disturbed areas. P. rubra has been introduced into many countries and islands, including South Africa, Yemen, Chad, and Burundi. It has been found growing everywhere in Myanmar except in very cool mountainous regions. It has been introduced both in China and Pakistan and has been naturalized in the Analamanga & Betsiboka regions of Madagascar. It is native to the Department of Antioquia in Colombia, and is distributed in countries such as Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Mexico, El Salvador, Belize, and, Honduras, along with the West Indies. It is also widely cultivated in Panama. P. rubra generally inhabits hot and rocky areas with dry to moderate rainfall. They can survive in locations with prominent dry seasons, where they can flower on the bare branches, or in more humid conditions, where they can remain evergreen. It can also be found in rocky forests, mountain slopes, and even occasionally on plains or savannas. It occupies elevations of 500 to 1000 meters but can be found up to elevations of 1500 meters. Cultivation The species is cultivated around the world in subtropical and tropical climates. In Australia, it is widely seen in cultivation in Sydney and Perth and warmer frost free climates northwards. In the mainland United States, it tolerates USDA Hardiness zones 10B to 11 (southern coastal California and the southern tip of Florida). It is also grown in Hawaii to an altitude of 2000 m. They tolerate a wide variety of soils, from acid to alkaline and sandy to clay. These plants grow best in dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun and will bloom throughout most of the year in tropical areas. They do not grow well in wet soils and in areas with temperatures below 50 degrees Fahrenheit during the winter seasons, the plants will stop blooming and shed their leaves. Established plants are also very salt tolerant and tolerate even salt-laden winds. Widely available in nurseries, frangipanis are readily propagated by cuttings of branches taken in cooler months and left to dry for a week or more. As well as gardens and street- and park planting, frangipanis are planted in temples and cemeteries. Plumeria rubra is an important crop in Hawaii, with over 14 million flowers were sold to be used in leis there in 2005. In temperate areas P. rubra must be grown under glass, in a large conservatory or similar, as it does not tolerate temperatures below . However it may be placed outside in a sheltered sunny spot during the summer months. In the United Kingdom it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. Some forms in cultivation are hybrids between this species and Plumeria obtusa; these have rounded rather than pointed leaves and are less likely to be deciduous. The white and yellow cultivar \\"Singapore\\" flowers all year round in Hawaii. Coleosporium plumeriae, known as plumeria rust or frangipani rust, is a fungus which attacks young leaves of P. rubra. It causes a brownish or orange powdery coating or blistering of leaves. It has been recorded from Hawaii and the east coast of Australia. It was first recognised by the French mycologist Narcisse Th√©ophile Patouillard on Guadeloupe Island in the eastern Caribbean in 1902, and had reached Taiwan by 2005. Uses The USDA Forestry Service lists Plumeria rubra as a poisonous plant and warns against touching or eating any part of the plant. The USDA Forestry Service's Site for El Yunque National Forest. In Cambodia, as with other Plumeria species, P. rubra flowers is used for necklaces, as offerings to deities or as decoration for coffins. The leaves of this species are used in the care of sores and made into soothing infusions. The flowers and bark of it are also used in traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of fever, bacillary dysentery, pertussis and so on. P. rubra possesses fulvoplumierin, an antibiotic that inhibits the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The plant has also been shown to be an antifungal, antiviral, analgesic, antispasmodic, and hypoglycemic. P. rubra is also reported to contain agoniadin, plumierid, plumeric acid, cerotinic acid, and lupeol, and the stem possesses an alkaloid called triterpinoid. The plant has been known to promote digestion and excretion, along with respiratory and immune functions. The sap of the plant is used as a laxative and is a remedy for bloating and stomachaches. The bark is said to be purgative and is also used for venereal sores. The flowers can be boiled in water or juice and made into a salad to promote bowel movement, urine flow, and to control gas and phlegm. The flowers are also used in the treatment of asthma. On the Molokai island in the Hawaiian archipelago, P. rubra is cultivated in order to produce neck garlands (leis). They are also used to make a scented oil in many Pacific islands that include Hawaii. The flowers are used to scent coconut oil. The bark contains faint purplish streaks and the wood is hard and compact with a very fine texture. The wood takes a high polish.

The lecture caused much discussion, including criticism. \\"Art, Truth and Politics\\": The Nobel Lecture Speaking with obvious difficulty in the lecture while seated in a wheelchair, Pinter distinguishes between the search for truth in art and the avoidance of truth in politics (5‚Äì10). He describes his own artistic process of creating The Homecoming and Old Times, following an initial line or word or image, calling \\"the author's position\\" an \\"odd one\\" as, experiencing the \\"strange moment ‚Ä¶ of creating characters who up to that moment have had no existence,\\" he must \\"play a never-ending game with them, cat and mouse, blind man's buff, hide and seek\\" during which \\"the search for the truth ‚Ä¶ has to be faced, right there, on the spot.\\" Distinguishing among his plays The Birthday Party, Mountain Language, and Ashes to Ashes, he segues into his transitions from \\"the search for truth\\" in art and \\"the entirely different set of problems\\" facing the artist in \\"Political theatre\\" to the avoidance of seeking \\"truth\\" in \\"power politics\\" (5‚Äì9). He asserts: Charging the United States with having \\"supported and in many cases engendered every right wing military dictatorship in the world after the end of the Second World War\\", leading to \\"hundreds of thousands of deaths,\\" Pinter asks: \\"Did they take place? And are they in all cases attributable to US foreign policy?\\" Then he answers his own question: \\"The answer is yes, they did take place, and they are attributable to American foreign policy. But you wouldn't know it\\" (9‚Äì10). Revisiting arguments from his political essays and speeches of the past decade, Pinter reiterates: In imagery recalling his description of \\"speech\\" as \\"a constant stratagem to cover nakedness\\", Pinter adds: Toward the end of the lecture, after reading two poems referring to \\"blood in the streets\\", \\"deaths\\", \\"dead bodies\\", and \\"death\\" by fellow Nobel Laureate Pablo Neruda (\\"I'm Explaining a Few Things\\") and himself (\\"Death\\"), in a whimsically humble gesture, Pinter offers to \\"volunteer\\" for the \\"job\\" of \\"speech writer\\" for President George W. Bush, penning a ruthless message of fierce aggression masquerading as moral struggle of good versus evil yet finally proffering the \\"authority\\" of his (Bush's) \\"fist\\" (17‚Äì22). Pinter demands prosecution of Tony Blair in the International Criminal Court, while pointing out, with irony, that he would do the same for Bush had he not refused to \\"ratify\\" that Court (18). Pinter concludes his Nobel Lecture with a call for \\"unflinching, unswerving, fierce intellectual determination, as citizens, to define the real truth of our lives and our societies\\" as \\"a crucial obligation which devolves upon us all,\\" one which he regards as \\"in fact mandatory,\\" for, he warns, \\"If such a determination is not embodied in our political vision we have no hope of restoring what is so nearly lost to us ‚Äì the dignity of man\\" (23‚Äì24). Critical response Pinter's Nobel Lecture has been the source of much discussion. In an article published in The Chronicle of Higher Education on 11 November 2005, entitled \\"Pinter's Plays, Pinter's Politics,\\" Middlebury College English professor Jay Parini observes that \\"In the weeks that have passed since Harold Pinter won the Nobel Prize in Literature, there has been incessant chatter on both sides of the Atlantic, some of it unflattering,\\" as \\"from the right, in particular, the American reaction to the Pinter award has been one of outrage,\\" whereas \\"the reaction to the award from Pinter's peers‚Äì‚ÄìMichael Frayn, David Hare, Tom Stoppard, and others‚Äì‚Äìhas been uniformly positive\\"; in response to naysayers, Parini concludes: \\"it may be true this time around that the Nobel Prize in Literature was given to the right man for the right reasons. Few writers in our time have demonstrated such a passionate concern for victims of oppression, whether in the family's living room or in the torturer's faraway bunker, as Harold Pinter. And few dramatists have been so vastly influential, transforming our basic sense of what happens when we enter a theater.\\" In response to his videotaped Nobel Lecture broadcast on More 4 and distributed via the internet, heated critical debate about Pinter spiked in the public media and spread throughout the blogosphere. Such criticism of Pinter encompassed thousands of commentaries and focused mostly on his political activism, particularly his purported \\"anti-Americanism\\" and his generally \\"leftist\\" views.For a critical discussion of the contexts of Pinter's Nobel Lecture, see Merritt, \\"(Anti-)Global Pinter.\\" Pinter's official, authorised biographer, Michael Billington observes that \\"the reactions to Pinter's Nobel Prize and Lecture\\" were \\"fascinating\\" and \\"overwhelmingly positive,\\" though he thinks \\"it is worth picking out the few negative ones\\" as examples. He observes, \\"The most startling fact was that Pinter's Nobel Lecture on 7 December was totally ignored by the BBC\\", adding: \\"You would have thought that a living British dramatist's views on his art and global politics might have been of passing interest to a public service broadcaster\\"; yet \\"There was ... no reference to the speech on any of BBC TV's news bulletins that night or indeed on its current affairs programme, Newsnight\\" (Harold Pinter 424). While \\"in the press, there was also a handful of attacks on both the award and the Lecture,\\" Billington dispatches criticisms by three of them: \\"the normally sensible Johan Hari\\", who \\"dismissed the Lecture in advance [of its broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK] as a 'rant' and falsely claimed that Pinter would have refused to resist Hitler\\"; \\"in fact,\\" Billington says, Pinter \\"has repeatedly said that, had he been of age, he would have accepted conscription in World War II\\" (424‚Äì25). \\"More predictably, Christopher Hitchens was wheeled out to dismiss Pinter as 'a bigmouth who has strutted and fretted his hour upon the stage for far too long' \\", and, finally, Billington cites Scottish historian Niall Ferguson's \\"attack\\" on the Lecture in The Daily Telegraph, quoting in part Ferguson's statement that in his Nobel Lecture Pinter \\" 'pretend[s] that [US] crimes were equivalent to those of its Communist opponents ...' \\"‚Äì‚Äìa distortion according to both Billington and Pinter: \\"he never made any comparison in his speech between atrocities committed by the Soviet Union and China and those of America\\"; \\" 'All I ever said,' [Pinter] retorts, 'is that Soviet atrocities were comprehensively documented but that American actions weren't. I didn't go into comparisons as to who killed more people as if it were a contest. Ferguson distorted the whole bloody thing' \\" (Qtd. in Billington, Harold Pinter 425). Billington also points out that the Harold Pinter Archive in the British Library contains \\"two large boxes containing the thousands of letters Pinter received from friends, colleagues, public eminences and total strangers applauding both the prize and his political stance\\" (425). The \\"Harold Pinter Community\\" Forum hosted on HaroldPinter.org, Pinter's official Website, illustrates further critical debate about Pinter's politics. Being Harold Pinter Pinter's Nobel Lecture is excerpted in a dramatic work developed and performed by the politically dissident Belarus Free Theatre, which has been censored, its members arrested and prevented from performing their work publicly in their own country. Being Harold Pinter is \\"a collation of six Pinter plays, excerpts from his Nobel Prize speech, and letters written by political prisoners in Belarusian jails,\\" which was performed with Pinter in the audiences in Leeds, England, during the Artist and Citizen: 50 Years of Performing Pinter, an international conference celebrating Pinter on the occasion of the awarding of an honorary degree to him by the University of Leeds, in April 2007;Michael Billington, \\"The Importance of Being Pinter: A New Production by the Belarus Free Theatre Reinforces the Global Resonance of the British Playwright's Political Works,\\" Guardian, Arts blog ‚Äì Theatre, Guardian Media Group, 16 April 2007, Web, 8 May 2009. and in London, premiering there from 11 to 23 February 2008.\\"Belarus Gala Evening\\" , Soho Theatre, London, Soho Theatre Company Ltd, n.d., Web, 15 January 2008.

Crowned as Rakai Panangkaran, he was the immediate successor of Sri Sanjaya, the founder of Sanjaya Dynasty as mentioned in the Kalasan inscription. The name of Panangkaran is mentioned in the Balitung charter (found in the Kedu Plain area) as the line of kings who were named as the 'builders of kraton'. In the late 8th and early 9th centuries, Java observed rivalries between two dynasties. The first four Sanjaya Dynasty lines after King Sanjaya (Panangkaran, Panunggalan, Warak and Garung), which was known as the Amrati Kings, competed over their power and religious influences with the Sailendras princes in the south of central Java who had arisen since 779. The Sanjayas were Hindus while Sailendras were Buddhists. There was only an isolated kingship in the east of Java, Gajayana, who appeared to have control over the Mount Kawi region in 760. Although relationship between the Amrati Kings with Sailendra was important at that time, the rivalries between the two is still unclear. From the Kalasan and Ratu Boko inscriptions, there were stated that Panangkaran granted permission requested by the collective guru of the Sailendra king to build Buddhist sculptures, shrines and monasteries in honor to the goddess Tara. The construction was built under Panangkaran's supervision, but was supported by Sailendra's expenses. In order to show his respect to the guru, Panangkaran consented the building of the shrine by giving the village of Kalasan to the Buddhist community.

Burma Global Action Network Main page Spurred by the global outcry as a result of the military crackdown on the peaceful protesters all over Burma, a number of independent groups, social service organisations and individuals had gotten together to support the Burmese populace. The concept for the day was developed by a coalition of Burma groups including - Burma Campaign UK, US Campaign for Burma, Amnesty International, Avaaz.org and many, many more. Much of the coordination for the protests was done through Facebook.com, where a group called Support the Monk's Protest in Burma (now called Burma Global Action Network was later formed), working closely with Burma Campaign UK and Amnesty International, had steadily grown to over 440,000 members in a matter of weeks.

The petition includes a pledge to hold them \\"accountable for any further bloodshed\\". Initially it aimed to receive 500,000 signatures, having achieved that, a new target of 1,000,000 has been set. As of January 2008, it had 834,718.

They were asked to simply put up one banner, underlined with the words, \\"Free Burma!\\".International Bloggers' Day for Burma on the 4th of October Event Description Besides the larger and more public protests held in these major cities, numerous smaller organisations and groups of individuals participated in this event in places where a more formal demonstration was not possible either due to local government opposition or lack of adequate infrastructural support. The protests were all peaceful in nature, aimed at more at promoting awareness about the plight of the Burmese people and to activate public support for their cause. Protesters used various means to show solidarity, with some wearing red and saffron clothing, sporting red Buddhist sacred threads, usage of the Peacock Flag and other iconography associated with the movement. The events were considered a success and organizers hoped that public involvement would force international community to take appropriate action.

She was married to Athanasius \\"Ath\\" Treweek, an Australian academic, linguist and World War II cryptographer/codebreaker. Born as Hazel Elizabeth Logue in Tamworth, New South Wales, a daughter of Augustine and Gertrude Logue, she was a voracious reader who wanted to be a teacher. She was the first in her family to matriculate, and got a Teachers College scholarship to train as a kindergarten teacher. She met her future husband, \\"Ath\\" Treweek, a lecturer in Greek at Sydney University, at one of the Logues' musical evenings in 1937; they were soon engaged. \\"Ath\\" Treweek was a gifted linguist. Referring to his access to decrypted Japanese messages in the Pacific theater, Hazel was accustomed to saying \\"I can't tell you anything about it, but Japan has just lost the war!\\" Hazel stayed in Sydney teaching kindergarten at Naremburn and Roseville public schools and did an arts degree with honours part-time. She was a natural teacher and wanted to defer marriage as she would then have to resign from her job. In 1942 Hazel married \\"Ath\\" at St. Mary's Cathedral, and moved to Melbourne, where she was appointed senior English mistress at Lauriston, a leading private girls' school. Children Their first child, Elizabeth, died in 1945 a few hours after birth. Helen was born in 1947. Ann was born in London in 1950 and, following their return, David, who predeceased his mother, was born in 1952. Post World War II In 1949 the family went to England for \\"Ath\\", who had received a Nuffield Foundation fellowship, to do a doctorate on the evolution of the manuscript tradition of the Greek mathematician Pappus of Alexandria. She became an English coach, gaining a reputation as one of the best English coaches on the North Shore line. Many of her students were Asian and in 1972 she was made an MBE for \\"assistance to international relations, as tutor and 'mother' to Asian students\\". From 1978-80 she earned an M.A. in drama at Sydney University. From 1981-83 she undertook an acting course at the Ensemble Studios in North Sydney, culminating in her directing a production of Twelfth Night. She was an honorary dramaturge and established an annual Shakespeare prize at the National Institute of Dramatic Art. She also did honorary work with the Sydney Theatre Company. In 1996 she received the Order of Australia for \\"teaching and encouragement of drama, particularly Shakespeare\\". Other awards included arts finalist in the Avon Spirit of Achievement Award. Religion An Irish-Australian, Hazel Treweek was a deeply committed Roman Catholic, although in later years her views on religious and social issues reportedly became somewhat more liberal. One of her relations was Cardinal Michael Logue (born 1840 - died 1924), Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All-Ireland through World War I, the Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence, the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which led to Partition and the resulting Irish Civil War. Death Her last years were marked by arthritis and she underwent heart bypass surgery. But as she remarked at the launch of the foundation: \\"I don't have arthritis of the brain.\\" Long a widow, she died of cancer, aged 86, and was survived by her daughters, Helen and Ann, and four grandchildren.

His volumes are today invaluable to people interested in genealogy. Early life James Corder, the son of Sunderland merchant tradesman Francis Corder, was educated at the Quaker-run Bootham School in York and never married. Instead, he devoted his life to local history. His historical studies began when he was in his early 20s, after he was inspired by George Bain, a founder of Sunderland Antiquarian Society, to investigate Sunderland‚Äôs history. Corder's research James Corder started his research at the end of the 19th century, by copying the registers of three ancient churches, including St Peter's, which was founded by Benedict Biscop. He also used information held by Presbyterian chapels in the town, as well as trade directories and marriage licence bonds. Corder documented his research in 25 volumes of manuscript books, taking 40 years to compile lists of the births, deaths and marriages of Sunderland families. His knowledge of intermarriage was immense, as documented in his volume on local Quaker families. He also interviewed people to help with the construction of the pedigrees of local families. He made notes of their origins in his manuscripts and traced their first entry into the town, the trades they were in and where they lived. But he was also controversial. His books often contained potentially libelous comments on the people he met. One man was called a ‚Äòworthless nonentity,‚Äô by Corder, another ‚Äòa habitual drunkard.‚Äô It is said that his books were kept hidden at Sunderland library for some years, for fear of possible court action by those mentioned. As well as his family records, Corder also chronicled Sunderland's streets, buildings, churches and industries in a further 36 volumes. Many of the streets, and most of the firms he listed, have now disappeared ‚Äì hence his work is of great value. His final years Corder retired in the 1940s, donating his volumes of research to Sunderland‚Äôs Central Library. He left Sunderland some years later, moving to Over Stowey in Somerset. He died in Over Stowey in a nursing home in 1953, at the age of 85. Corder's unique record of Sunderland life is available to view at Sunderland‚Äôs Central Library and provides a vital starting point for many genealogists.

It flows through the provinces of Qinghai, Sichuan, and Yunnan in western China. The river passes through Tiger Leaping Gorge. It is sometimes grouped together with the Lancang (upper Mekong) and Nu (upper Salween) as the Sanjiang (\\"Three Rivers\\") area,E.g., in the \\"Annual Report of the Chinese Academy of Geological Research\\", p. 24. Geological Publishing House, 1994. part of which makes up the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas. Name The river was first recorded as the Hei (, Hƒìishu«ê, lit. \\"Blackwater\\") in the Warring States' \\"Tribute of Yu\\". It was described as the Sheng (t , s , Sh√©ngshu«ê, \\"Rope River\\") in the Han-era Classic of Mountains and Seas. During the Three Kingdoms, it was known as the Lu (t , s , L√∫shu«ê).It has also appeared as the Li (, L√¨shu«ê, \\"Beautiful River\\"); Mahu (, M«éh√∫jiƒÅng, \\"Horse Lake River\\"); and Shen (, Sh√©nchuƒÅn, \\"Holy River\\" or \\"River of Spirits\\"). The present name was adopted during the Song dynasty. Owing to earlier romanization systems, the river has been known as the Chin-sha Chiang and Kinsha Kiang (when it was not simply described as the Yangtze) in English sources for the last three centuries. The most common present name, Jinsha is the Hanyu Pinyin romanization of the same Chinese characters as the other two. Although the name is generally over-literally translated as the \\"Gold Sand\\"Pletcher, Kenneth. The Geography of China: Sacred and Historic Places, p. 359. Britannica Educational Publishing (New York), 2011. Accessed 16 August 2013. or \\"Golden-Sanded River\\",E.g., in Davis, John. The Chinese: A General Description of the Empire of China and Its Inhabitants, Vol. 1, pp. 132 ff. C. Knight, 1836. the name is not poetic or descriptive of the color of the river's banks. Rather, described actual placer gold, alluvial gold powder sometimes still panned from the river's waters. The Jinsha culture in prehistoric China derives its name from a road near its type site and not from the river directly. Geography =Route= The Jinsha River is simply the upper course of the Yangtze, although the Yalong and Min rivers were sometimes considered to have been the main course before the advent of modern geography.Fan Chengda. James M. Hargett (trans.) Riding the River Home: A Complete and Annotated Translation of Fan Chengda's (1126-1193) Travel Diary Record of a Boat Trip to Wu, p. 77. Chinese Univ. of Hong Kong (Hong Kong), 2008. Accessed 15 August 2013. It is traditionally considered to begin at the confluence of the Tongtian and Batang rivers near Gy√™gu in Qinghai. As the Jinsha River, it then flows south through a deep gorge parallel to the similar gorges of the upper Mekong and upper Salween rivers, from which it is separated by the Ningjing Mountains. It forms the western border of Sichuan for some 250 miles (400 km) and then flows into Yunnan province. After a large, 200 mile (320 km) long loop to the north of Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, the Jinsha swings northeast, forming the Sichuan-Yunnan provincial boundary until it joins the Min River at Yibin in Sichuan to form the Yangtze. =Gradients= The upper course of the river falls about 14 feet per mile (2.7 m/km). Below Batang in Sichuan, the gradient gradually decreases to about 8 feet per mile (1.5 m/km) but the Jinsha is not navigable. Its upper course through the gorges, particularly, is more of an obstacle than an aid to transportation. Dams The Jinsha is being heavily developed, primarily for hydroelectric power. As of March 2014, a total of 25 dams are completed, under construction or planned for the river. Those dams are listed below from downstream to upstream. *Xiangjiaba Dam ‚Äì completed, 7,750 MW *Xiluodu Dam ‚Äì completed, 13,860 MW *Baihetan Dam ‚Äì under construction, 16,000 MW *Wudongde Dam ‚Äì under construction, 10,200 MW *Yinjiang Dam ‚Äì planned *Jinsha Dam ‚Äì planned, 520 MW *Guanyinyan Dam ‚Äì completed, 3,000 MW *Ludila Dam ‚Äì completed, 2,160 MW *Longkaikou Dam ‚Äì completed, 1,800 MW *Jinanqiao Dam ‚Äì completed, 2,400 MW *Ahai Dam ‚Äì completed, 2,000 MW *Liyuan Dam ‚Äì completed, 2,400 MW *Liangjiaren Dam ‚Äì planned, 4,000 MW *Longpan Dam ‚Äì planned, 6,000 MW *Bengzilan Dam ‚Äì planned, 2,100 MW *Rimian Dam ‚Äì programmed, 3,720 MW *Changbo Dam ‚Äì programmed, 1,060 MW *Suwalong Dam ‚Äì programmed, 1,160 MW *Batang Dam ‚Äì programmed, 740 MW *Lawa Dam ‚Äì programmed, 1,680 MW *Yebatan Dam ‚Äì programmed, 2,080 MW *Boluo Dam ‚Äì planned, 960 MW *Yanbi Dam ‚Äì planned, 300 MW *Gangtuo Dam ‚Äì planned, 1,100 MW *Guotong Dam ‚Äì planned, 140 MW History =Imperial China= The pre-imperial \\"Tribute of Yu\\" recorded the traditional view of the Yangtze River as originating with the Min or Yalong instead of the Jinsha and this remained unchallenged for millennia, even after Li Daoyuan's Commentary on the Water Classic recorded much of the Jinsha's extensive river system during the Northern Wei. The Ming-era geographer Xu Xiake was the first to correct this, although it remained a common misconception in China as late as the early 20th century. =People's Republic= The Jinsha River is under heavy development by China, with over sixteen dam projects in various phases of development along the river, and many on its tributaries as well, especially the Yalong. Four dams along the lower part of the river are under construction or have already been completed to generate hydroelectric power and to trap silt that would otherwise create problems at the Three Gorges Dam. The ten largest dams will produce 55,710 megawatts of power.

The club is a member of Northern NSW Football in Australia. The club was formed in 1891 by Scottish miners and is the third oldest surviving football club in the Northern Federation, behind Wallsend Red Devils FC (1887) and Adamstown Rosebud FC (1889). History Founded by Scottish miners in 1891 as West Wallsend Athletic FC, they did not compete during the 1895 and 1896 season due to a miners' strike in the district. The club re-formed at the end of 1896 as the West Wallsend Bluebells FC. Highlights include the club being selected in 1902 to represent Newcastle against Sydney and winning 4‚Äì2. In 1923, the Bluebells played the touring Canadian side and won 3‚Äì0. Over the years, the club has picked up many honours and has produced 21 internationals. One of the club's darkest hours came at the end of 1996 season, when the Federation dumped the club from the top division due to lack of facilities, despite featuring in six grand finals in the previous fourteen years. The club struggled to regain its place in the Northern League. Its only brief appearance in 2001 saw the club finish last for only the third time in its history and be relegated again. In 2007, the club won the NEW-FM League minor premiership and was promoted back to the Northern NBN State League, where it finished a credible eighth in the 2008 season and was selected in the new eight team NBN State League for 2009‚Äì10. After a five-year stint in the NBN State League the club was relegated back to the NEW-FM First Division at the end of the 2012 season after finishing last. After relegation in 2012, the side was nearly disbanded in 2014 when they struggled to sign enough players to form a side. The club has gradually returned to be one of the stronger sides in the First Division Competition in recent years, highlighted by their Grand Final Appearance in 2018.

Ground The ground is located at Johnston Park ‚Äì on the corner of Laidley Street and Wilson Street in West Wallsend, and was named after William G. Johnston. Mr Johnston cleared and marked a soccer football field on land leased from the Caledonian Coal company. The park became known as Johnston's park, home of the Bluebells.\\"Early West Wallsend-Its People and Places. Page 73 During the 1920s, the ground picked up the nickname 'Wembley' as the side contained eight internationals. William G. Johnston was the owner of the Johnston Hotel (established 1887) (now the Museum Hotel) which is adjacent to the ground. Rivals The Bluebells' biggest rival is the Wallsend Football Club. Both clubs have enjoyed success at the state level. However, both have encountered lean times in more recent years. Edgeworth Eagles are their nearest rivals, however since the Bluebells were relegated back to the First Division at the end of 2012, encounters between the side have been restricted to the Heritage Cup and FFA Cup competitions.

Its source lies in the Phetchabun Mountains in the Khao Kho District, Thailand.Whitewhater Rafting at Tourism Authority of Thailand It flows through Thung Salaeng Luang National Park and forms Namtok Sri Dit and Namtok Kaeng Sopha (Kaeng Sopha Waterfall) in the Wang Thong District of Phitsanulok Province, and finally flows through into the Bang Krathum District, passing through Ban Sam Ruen and on to the border of Phitsanulok and Phichit, where it drains into the Nan River at .Google Earth The land drained by the Wang Thong River is part of the Nan Basin and the Chao Phraya Watershed. Etymology Of the names Khek and Wang Thong, Khek (Thai: ‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡πá‡∏Å) is the older name for the river. The work Khek is another name for the ethnicity more commonly known as Hakka. The two words are cognates of Chinese ÂÆ¢ÂÆ∂ (meaning house-guest). The river derives its modern name Wang Thong from its path through Amphoe Wang Thong. The first element wang (Thai: ‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏á) means palace.Thai/English Dictionary The second element thong (Thai: ‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏á) means gold.Thai/English Dictionary This Thai word for gold was borrowed from the Tamil language of Sri Lanka.The Chola Empire and the Chao Phraya Delta The name of the river translates to River of the Golden Palace. History The early Ban Wang Thong and Ban Saphan communities relied heavily on the Wang Thong River. Before the construction of highways, most traffic to Phichit and Nakhon Sawan was via boat. Brotherly Villages Boat Race The Wang Thong river was historically the site for a boat race between the villagers of Ban Wang Thong and Ban Saphan. The race took place annually in November after the rainy season. The original boat race was discontinued prior to the 1940s. In 1982, a plan to reintroduce the Brotherly Villages Boat Race was discussed by senior local officials, the traders of the Wang Thong Market, farmer organizations and the abbot of Wat Bang Saphan to promote the unity of the community. Rather than having one village compete against the other as in earlier days, the new boat race involves competition between local farmer and village organizations. The first race in the reborn competition was opened by District Officer Naaj Amphoe. The present form of the boat race involves less ritual activities than the pre-1940s races. Khek River Rafting Festival Tourists come to the Wang Thong River to see the waterfalls along its path, and to engage in rafting. Rapids along the river include the Wang Nam Yen Rapids within Thung Salaeng Luang National Park. Some portions of the Wang Thong River are designated level 5 rafting sites. This level of whitewater is the uppermost limit to rafting, meaning the river is wild, with a rapid current and difficult, steep rapids. The level of difficulty of the current depends on the volume of water flow. In the rainy season, the river becomes swifter. In June 2005, Phitsanulok Province initiated a campaign entitled \\"Sip Coffee at Kaeng Song, Paddle Along Nam Khek Rapids,\\" and held the first Khek River Rafting Festival. The next Khek River Rafting Festival was held from July 7 through the end of October 2006 and the next from July 1 through October 31, 2007, under the name \\"Kaeng Song Cafe - Khek river rafting festival.\\"Kaeng Song Cafe - Khek river rafting festival Waterfalls * Kaeng Song Waterfall * Kaeng Sopha Waterfall * Sri Dit Waterfall * Wang Nok Aen Waterfall Bueng Rachanok Bueng Rachanok (Thai: ‡∏ö‡∏∂‡∏á‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏ô‡∏Å) is a swamp along the Wang Thong River within the Wang Thong District of Phitsanulok Province.

Bullitt changed positions every season. He began playing at corner, then free safety, then strong safety, and finally at outside linebacker. Professional career =Indianapolis Colts= 2007 season Bullitt signed with the Indianapolis Colts as an undrafted free agent. In Week 5 he started in the Colts‚Äô dime package in a 33-14 victory over the Tampa Bay. He also saw action on defense in Week 9 against the New England as a replacement for injured Pro Bowl safety Bob Sanders. He had his most extensive playing time in Week 17 against Tennessee, when he entered the game in the second half after the Colts rested starters on both sides of the ball. Despite only playing the second half, he made a team-high 10 tackles. 2008 season During the 2008 season, Bullitt made three game-saving interceptions to seal victories for the Colts. In the 31‚Äì27 comeback win over the Texans on October 5, he intercepted a pass by quarterback Sage Rosenfels at the Indianapolis 22, with 42 seconds remaining in the game. On November 9, Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger attempted to throw a touchdown pass into the end zone on the final play, but Bullitt intercepted the pass, preventing a Steelers comeback and sealing the 24‚Äì20 Colts win. The third game-saver occurred in the second matchup against the Texans on November 16, when Bullitt intercepted Rosenfels' pass at the Colts 35, with 32 seconds left in the game. In the same game, however, he missed a tackle near the line of scrimmage on running back Steve Slaton, who ran 71 yards for a touchdown. The Colts still won 33‚Äì27. Overall, Bullitt started nine games during the season, recording 42 solo tackles and four interceptions. After the season, Bullitt received recognition from USA Today, which listed him on its annual \\"All-Joe\\" team. Regarding his then-new role as a starter, Bullitt stated: \\"You always want to be a starter. That‚Äôs why you come to the NFL. You don‚Äôt want to come in and be a backup. You have to learn and you have to wait your time. You have to be patient, because anytime, an opportunity may come. Mine came this year, and I just wanted to go out and do the best I can and show people in the league I can play, too.\\" 2009 season In January 2009, Bullitt was named the \\"emerging star\\" of the AFC South by an ESPN.com blogger; seven other players representing each division of the league were named one, as well. The players were picked based on their performances in the 2008 season. His teammates elected him as one of the two 2009 special-teams captains. He started the season as a starter, replacing the injured Bob Sanders. He was named the \\"Unsung Hero of the Week\\" for week 3 by USA Today for his performance against the Arizona Cardinals. Bullitt forced a fumble and also prevented an airborne player from scoring a touchdown at the goal line. Bullitt also made a crucial fourth-down stop in the 35‚Äì34 victory over the New England Patriots. For the second straight year, Bullitt made USA Today's \\"All-Joe\\" team. 2010‚Äì2011 seasons In October 2010, Bullitt was placed on injured reserve and missed the rest of the season. Three weeks into the 2011 season, Bullitt was placed on injured reserve. He was released following the 2011 season on March 9, 2012. Post-playing career Following his retirement, Bullitt was named coach of the Legends Football League's Dallas Desire for the franchise's return in 2016. His brother Terrance will be his assistant.REVITALIZED DALLAS DESIRE SET TO MAKE FRANCHISE RETURN BY NAMING MELVIN BULLITT AS HEAD COACH Melvin maintains an athletic training facility with his family in Rowlett, Texas.https://www.thebullittexperience.com/my- story Personal During his playing career, Melvin wore the number 33 in honor of his father, Jerry Bullitt, who wore the number as a linebacker at Texas A&M.; When asked about his number, Melvin stated: \\"I kind of feel like when I'm wearing (No. 33), a piece of my dad is with me when I'm on the field.\\" Rhodes caught in a numbers game, and it might get costly IndyStar.com  The Indianapolis Star Teammate Dominic Rhodes previously wore the same number for six seasons from 2001 to 2006 before playing the 2007 season for the Oakland Raiders.

Its headquarters are in the town of Casale Monferrato which was once known as the Italian ‚Äòcement capital‚Äô. Today it has subsidiaries, interests and operations in Italy, Luxembourg, Germany, Algeria and Eastern Europe as well as in North America. The company was formed in September 1999 when Buzzi Cementi (founded as Fratelli Buzzi SpA in Trino Vercellese by the brothers Pietro and Antonio Buzzi in 1907) took over Unicem (founded as Cementi Marchino in Casale by Luigi Marchino in 1878), and took on the name Buzzi Unicem. The company is founded by a large family connected to the successful Italian fencer, Lorenzo Buzzi.  Growth through acquisition  In 2004 the group acquired control of the German cement company Dyckerhoff (founded as Portland-Cement-Fabrik Dyckerhoff & S√∂hne in Am√∂neburg by Wilhelm Gustav Dyckerhoff and his sons in 1864). In March 2018, Buzzi Unicem acquired the German firm Portlandzementwerke Seibel & S√∂hne through the Dyckerhoff subsidiary. In September 2018, Buzzi Unicem revealed that it had acquired 50% of Brazil's BCPAR (owned by Grupo Ricardo Brannand), which includes two cement plants in the country, with an option to acquire the rest of the firm by 2025. This acquisition was made at a relatively low cost, likely at a loss for the seller, due to the precarious financial situation facing the Brazilian construction industry at the time. In November 2018, Buzzi Unicem was one of thirty companies that formed the advocacy group Global Cement and Concrete Association, as a partial replacement for the Cement Sustainability Initiative. the company had sales in, at least, the Czech Republic, Germany (through Dyckerhoff), Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Ukraine, and the United States (through Buzzi Unicem USA).  Operations  The current Chairman is Sandro Buzzi; Chief Executives are Pietro Buzzi (Corporate Finance) and Michele Buzzi (Operations management). Buzzi Unicem was among several cement companies who in mid-2018 were fined tens-of-millions of Euros for cartel-like behavior in Italy, fines initially imposed in 2017 by the Italian Competition Authority and subsequently appealed. In September 2017, the company bought a 50% stake in Ecotrade, a supplier of industrial byproducts (e.g. fly ash, slags), with the intent to expand its internal operations. In mid-2017, Buzzi Unicem suffered a cyberattack which disrupted its internal process administration and delayed financial disclosures, thought to be due to the Petya ransomware virus likely infiltrating through plants that it operates in the Ukraine.

It includes a nine-patch center block surrounded by pieced strips. The quilts of Gee's Bend are quilts created by a group of women and their ancestors who live or have lived in the isolated African-American hamlet of Gee's Bend, Alabama along the Alabama River. The quilts of Gee's Bend are considered to be unique, and one of the most important African-American visual and cultural contributions to the history of art within the United States. Arlonzia Pettway, Annie Mae Young and Mary Lee Bendolph are among some of the most notable quilters from Gee‚Äôs Bend. Many of the residents in the community can trace their ancestry back to slaves from the Pettway Plantation. Arlonzia Pettway can recall her grandmother‚Äôs stories of her ancestors, specifically of Dinah Miller, who was brought to the United States by slave ship in 1859. History Women from Gee's Bend work on a quilt, 2005 Just southwest of Selma, in the Black Belt of Alabama, Gee's Bend (officially called Boykin) is an isolated, rural community of about seven hundred inhabitants. The area is named after Joseph Gee, a landowner who came from North Carolina and established a cotton plantation in 1816 with his seventeen slaves. In 1845 the plantation was sold to Mark H. Pettway. This name still remains predominant in the county as many members of the community still carry the name. After emancipation many freed slaves and family members stayed on the plantation as sharecroppers. In the 1930s, Gee's Bend saw a significant shift in their community, as a merchant who had given credit to the families of the Bend died, and the family of this merchant collected on debts owed to him in a brutal way. These indebted families watched as all their food, animals, tools and seed were taken away, and the community was saved by the distribution of Red Cross rations. Much of the land of this area was sold to the Federal Government and the Farm Security Administration, and those organizations set up Gee's Bend Farms, Inc., a pilot project that was a cooperative-based program intended to help sustain the inhabitants of the area. The government sold tracts of land to the families of the bend, thus giving the Native and African American population control over the land, which at the time was still rare. The community of Gee's Bend was also the subject of several Farm Security Administration photographers, like Dorothea Lange. During the latter half of The Great Depression the inhabitants of the area faced challenges as farming practices became increasingly mechanized, and consequently, a large portion of the community left. However, many inhabitants of the community stayed. In 1949, a U.S Post Office was established. In 1962, the ferry service, one of the only accesses into Gee‚Äôs Bend, was eliminated, contributing to the community‚Äôs isolation. This elimination hindered residents‚Äô ability to register to vote. Ferry service was not restored until 2006. From the 1960s onward, the community of Gee's Bend, as well as the Freedom Quilting Bee in nearby Alberta, gained attention for the production of their quilts. Folk art collector, historian, curator William Arnett brought further attention to this artistic production with his Souls Grown Deep Foundation in Atlanta, Georgia, as he helped organize many exhibitions which featured their work. In 1965 Martin Luther King Jr. visited the area. Quilts The quilting tradition in Gee's Bend goes back beyond the 19th century perhaps influenced in part by patterned Native American textiles and African textiles. African-American women pieced together strips of cloth to make bedcovers. Throughout the post-bellum years and into the 20th century, Gee's Bend women made quilts to keep themselves and their children warm in unheated shacks that lacked running water, telephones and electricity. Along the way they developed a distinctive style, noted for its lively improvisations and geometric simplicity. Many of the quilts are a departure from classical quilt making, bringing to mind a minimalist quality. This could also have been influenced by the isolation of their location, which caused them to use whatever materials were on hand, often recycling from old clothing and textiles. The quilts have been exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts Houston, the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Tacoma Art Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art, among others. The reception of the work has been mostly positive, as Alvia Wardlaw, curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston wrote, \\"The compositions of these quilts contrast dramatically with the ordered regularity associated with many styles of Euro-American quiltmaking. There's a brilliant, improvisational range of approaches to composition that is more often associated with the inventiveness and power of the leading 20th-century abstract painters than it is with textile-making\\". The Whitney venue, in particular, brought a great deal of art-world attention to the work, starting with Michael Kimmelman's review in The New York Times which called the quilts 'some of the most miraculous works of modern art America has produced' and went on to describe them as a version of Matisse and Klee arising in the rural South. Comparable effect can be seen in the quilts of isolated individuals such as Rosie Lee Tompkins, but the Gee's Bend quilters had the advantage of numbers and backstory.  Quilting retreats  In 2003, 50 quilt makers founded the Gee's Bend Collective, which is owned and operated by the women of Gee‚Äôs Bend. Every quilt sold by the Gee‚Äôs Bend Quilt Collective is unique and individually produced. At the retreats, which began in 2015, China Pettway and Mary Ann Pettway share their unique quilting styles as participants explore the work of their hands and the spirituality of quilting. Singing and storytelling are also included in the activities. In recent years, members of the Collective have traveled nationwide to talk about Gee‚Äôs Bend‚Äôs history and their art. Many of the ladies have become well known for their wit, engaging personality and, in some cases, singing abilities. Gallery File:Sewing a quilt.

Since its foundation in 1987, the Power Plant has produced more than forty publications.  Background  The Power Plant Contemporary Art Gallery is a Canadian non-collecting, public art gallery dedicated exclusively to contemporary visual art from Canada and the world. It is a forum for the advanced artistic culture that offers a facility and professional support to a diverse group of living artists while engaging equally diverse audiences in their work. The Power Plant fulfills its mandate by generating: exhibitions that represent the range of advanced practice in visual arts; publications that provide in-depth explorations of contemporary art; lectures and symposia that encourage debate and further understanding; interpretative tools that invite visitors to question, explore and reflect upon their experiences; programming that incorporates other areas of culture at their intersection with visual art. = History = In 1976, Harbourfront Centre established the Art Gallery at Harbourfront, housed at the Bill Boyle Artport. Its founding director was Anita Aarons. Harbourfront Corporation provided the Art Gallery at Harbourfront with the opportunity to renovate the powerhouse on site as its new home. Constructed in 1926, the original powerhouse (and the Power Plant's current facility) housed the heating and refrigeration equipment for the massive Toronto Terminal Warehouse (now Queen's Quay Terminal) and its companion building, The Ice House (today Harbourfront Centre Theatre). thumb Peter Smith of Lett/Smith Architects was chosen to undertake the renovations, the design of which took into consideration both the history of the building and the demands on a contemporary art venue. Opened to the public on 1 May 1987, the Power Plant is easily recognized by its smokestack and exterior fa√ßade, both of which have been restored to maintain reference to its history. In celebration of the Power Plant's 25th anniversary in 2012, the gallery introduced ALL YEAR, ALL FREE, offering free admission and open access to the public to all exhibitions. The Power Plant also marked the occasion with a redesign of its visual identity and added a new lobby, retail space and website, thus strengthening its position locally and internationally and allowing audiences to further engage with the rich and rewarding work of contemporary artists and thinkers. The gallery celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2017, coinciding with Canada's Sesquicentennial. = Harbourfront Centre = The Power Plant is a key attraction of Harbourfront Centre. While the gallery is led by its own Board of Directors, Harbourfront Centre supports the gallery with maintenance and improvements to the physical site, as well as services and financial support. For more than three decades, Harbourfront Centre has been at the cutting edge of all that is current and creative, bringing together the best in both in Canadian multiculturalism and around the world. From its beginnings as \\"Harbourfront Corporation,\\" a federal Crown Corporation established in 1972, Harbourfront Centre was formed on January 1, 1991 as a non-profit charitable organization with a mandate to organize and present public events and to operate a ten-acre site on Toronto's lakefront, encompassing York Quay and John Quay (south of Queens Quay West). Since its inception, Harbourfront Centre has been introducing audiences to artists and art forms that would not normally be seen in commercial venues, exploring new and bold frontiers in the arts and creative expression = Board of Directors = The Power Plant's Board of Directors includes professionals and noted individuals from a broad range of industries, including the arts, education, finance, law, philanthropy, public service and real estate. = Past directors = * Gaetane Verna (2012‚ÄìPresent) * Gregory Burke (2005 - 2011) * Wayne Baerwaldt (2002 - 2004) * Marc Mayer (1998 - 2001) * Steven Pozel (1992 - 1997) * Allan MacKay (1989 - 1991) * William J. S Boyle (1987 - 1988) Exhibitions Since its earliest exhibitions, the Power Plant has been dedicated to presenting new and recent work by Canadian artists along with their international peers, including ambitious thematic exhibitions and major solo exhibitions by Canadian artists such as Peter Doig, Geoffrey Farmer, Maria Hupfield and Annie Pootoogook. Solo exhibitions by international artists have included Fiona Banner, Pedro Cabrita Reis, Akram Zaatari and more. The Power Plant considers it crucial to pair Canadian and international artists (and their subject matter) to position the gallery in the local-global dialogue of contemporary art practice and to attract a culturally diverse audience. Christian Marclay's The Clock, a world-renowned video called \\"a masterpiece of our time\\" by The Guardian, opened at the Power Plant in Fall 2012 after screenings at London's White Cube Gallery and New York's Paula Cooper Gallery, among other venues. The gallery partnered with Nuit Blanche to present special overnight hours and marathon viewings of the exhibition for the public. Toronto-based artist Micah Lexier's exhibition [One, Two and More than Two in Fall 2013, called a \\"landmark [exhibition]\\" by Toronto Star, involved the participation of 101 artists/duos/collectives from in and around Toronto, presenting a wide-ranging, multi-generational portrait of a robust Toronto art community. Shelagh Keeley's Fall 2014 Fleck Clerestory Commission, Notes on Obsolescence, was acquired by the Vancouver Art Gallery. Also during Fall 2013, the Power Plant presented Toronto-born, Brooklyn-based artist Julia Dault‚Äôs first solo museum exhibition and monograph, Colour Me Badd. Dault‚Äôs work has been acquired by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, as well as the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto. Unfinished Conversation: Encoding/Decoding in Winter 2015 presented the work of Terry Adkins (US), John Akomfrah (UK), Sven Augustijnen (Belgium), Steve McQueen (UK), Shelagh Keeley (Canada) and Zineb Sedira (Algeria/France/UK), six artists whose practice is devoted primarily to commenting on history and memory. What connects all these artworks is the artists‚Äô involvement with significant social issues confronting humanity today, and their profound desire to push formal boundaries in order to tackle them. Toronto Star described the exhibition as \\"Powerful, convincing and emotionally resonant\\". To further the reach and impact of the Power Plant's exhibitions, the gallery began to present virtual tours for online audiences unable to visit in person and to travel its exhibitions. In 2019 Hajra Waheed, one of The Power Plant's Fall 2019 exhibiting artists presented a related exhibition on view at the Small Arms Inspection Building as a part of Toronto Biennial of Art. = Commissioning Program = In 2006, the Power Plant launched an annual Commissioning Program, which is an ongoing program to develop and premier major new works by Canadian and international artists. In 2014, the gallery introduced the Fleck Clerestory Commissioning Program in a gallery space dedicated solely to one site-specific installation each year, inaugurated by Toronto-based artist Shelagh Keeley. The commissions reflect international, national and local dialogues, with content that references the specificity of Toronto's historical past and a global cultural present, all the while involving the local arts community and the general public. Commissioned works have since been acquired by national collecting institutions, toured to other galleries of significance outside Canada, and contributed to the cultural life of the region. Past commissions include: * Rashid Johnson: Anxious Audience (2019) * Hajra Waheed: Hold Everything Dear (2019) * Vincent Meessen: Blues Klair (2019) * Thomas J Price: Ordinary Men (2019) * Omar Ba: Same Dream (2019) * Karla Black (2018) *Beth Stuart: Length, Breadth, Thickness and‚ÄîDuration (2018) * Abbas Akhavan: variations on a landscape (2018) *Kader Attia: The Field of Emotion (2018) * Michael Landy: DEMONSTRATION (2017) * Amalia Pica: ears to speak of (2017) * Maria Hupfield: The One Who Keeps On Giving (2017) * Kapwani Kiwanga: A wall is just a wall (2017) * Latifa Echakhch: Cross Fade (2016) *Maria Loboda: Some weep, some blow flutes (2016) * Carlos Amorales: Black Cloud (2015) * Tercerunquinto: Mine (2015) * Bik Van der Pol: Eminent Domain (2015) * YES!

The Power Plant organizes approximately 120+ educational programs for the public annually. These include artist talks, gallery tours, lecture, symposia, film screenings, Power Kids art workshops for children, youth engagement and outreach programs such as Power Youth, and more.  Publications & artist editions  To further the dialogue around contemporary art and art practices, the Power Plant produces publications, artist books and exhibition catalogues to accompany the shows. Past publications include: *Julia Dault (2019) *Amalia Pica: please listen hurry others speak better (2018) * The Unfinished Conversation: Encoding / Decoding (2016) *Yto Barrada: A Guide to Fossils for Forgers and Foreigners (2016) *Ulla von Brandenburg: It Has a Golden Red Sun and an Elderly Green Moon (2016) *Pedro Cabrita Reis: fourteen paintings the preacher and a broken line (2016) *Micah Lexier: More Than Two (Let It Make Itself) (2013) *Derek Sullivan: Albatross Omnibus (2011) *Kerry Tribe: Speak Memory (2012) *Glenn Ligon: Some Changes (2005) The Power Plant also produces artist editions.

It is a non-commutative version of the classic Chern character of the conventional differential geometry. In noncommutative geometry, the concept of a manifold is replaced by a noncommutative algebra \\\\mathcal{A} of \\"functions\\" on the putative noncommutative space. The cyclic cohomology of the algebra \\\\mathcal{A} contains the information about the topology of that noncommutative space, very much as the de Rham cohomology contains the information about the topology of a conventional manifold. The JLO cocycle is associated with a metric structure of non-commutative differential geometry known as a \\\\theta-summable spectral triple (also known as a \\\\theta-summable Fredholm module).  \\\\theta-summable spectral triples  A \\\\theta-summable spectral triple consists of the following data: (a) A Hilbert space \\\\mathcal{H} such that \\\\mathcal{A} acts on it as an algebra of bounded operators. (b) A \\\\mathbb{Z}_2-grading \\\\gamma on \\\\mathcal{H}, \\\\mathcal{H}=\\\\mathcal{H}_0\\\\oplus\\\\mathcal{H}_1.

History =Her Majesty's Theatre 1887‚Äì1902= Her Majesty's Theatre Fire, Sydney, March 1902 The original Her Majesty's had its origin in the partnership of James Allison and George Rignold, lessees of Adelaide's Theatre Royal and the Melbourne Opera House. They secured a long lease on a site in Pitt Street, Sydney, and formed a company for the purpose of founding a theatre. The theatre was designed by architects Gustavus Alphonse Morell and John Edward Kemp. The foundation stone was laid by Sydney mayor Thomas Playfair in December 1884. The opening play was Henry V, and lessee Rignold was the lead player. The Governor of New South Wales, Lord Carrington, attended the opening night, arriving with his wife in a carriage, with a military escort. Rignold held the lease for eight years, his final production was Cloncarty on 21 September 1895. For a short period, Alfred Woods leased the theatre, then J. C. Williamson and George Musgrove took over in 1896. On Sunday 23 March 1902, a fire broke out.

Financial pressures from a new amusement tax, competition from the new talking movies and the economic climate led to the closure of the theatre on 10 June 1933. The last performance was The Maid of the Mountains, starring Gladys Moncrieff. Bulldozers moved in the next day and demolished the theatre. A Woolworths retail store opened on the site 22 March 1934.

It is located north of the Slieve Bloom Mountains on the R421 regional road between the villages of Kinnitty and Cadamstown. A nearby pyramid was built by the Bernard family who resided in the castle. History The first castle at Kinnitty was destroyed in 1209 and was rebuilt by the Normans in 1213. During that period an Augustinian abbey (St Finnian's) was established near the castle, of which the famous High Cross and Abbey Wall still remain. Later the Normans were replaced by the O'Carrolls of Ely and in 1630 William O'Carroll built a new castle close by the old abbey. This castle was confiscated in 1641 as part of the plantation of Offaly, or Kings County as it was then named. In 1664, the crown granted an estate, which included the castle, to Col. Thomas Winter in return for his military service. His descendants sold it to Thomas Bernard, who renamed the house Castle Bernard and left it to his son Thomas Bernard, MP. Several historic features of the original castle remain accessible to visitors. In 1811, Lady Catherine Hutchinson, wife of Thomas, jnr, commissioned architect James Pain to extend the castle in a gothic style to its present size. Thomas was succeeded by his son, Colonel Thomas Bernard, Lord Lieutenant of King's County and High Sheriff of King's County for 1837, who died unmarried in 1882 and was succeeded by his niece's husband Captain Caulfield French. The latter was High Sheriff of King's County for 1887. Although burned by the Irish Republican Army in 1922, the house was restored in 1928 by means of a Government grant of ¬£32,000. The Bernard family lived there until 1946, when it was sold to Lord Decies who in turn sold it to the state in 1951. From 1955 to 1985, the building hosted a Forestry Training College. It was then purchased in 1994 by the Ryan family of Limerick, who developed it into a 37 bedroom, 4 star hotel and wedding venue. The castle was seized by the KBC Bank in 2008 who continued to keep it running as a Hotel until 2015 when the Castle was bought over by its present owners. The current ownership group of Irish and American investors includes Derek Warfield, founding member of the musical group the Wolfe Tones and Colin Breen, owner of Four Green Fields Pub in Tampa, Florida. Since the purchase in 2015, Kinnity Castle Hotel has undergone significant renovations and continues to serve as a wedding and executive-level conference venue, as well as a 4 star hotel.

The company's history is complex and involves five men: , John Thomas Groves, Charles Arthur Day, William Baldock and Nathaniel Ogle.  Forerunners  Summers and Ogle's 1830 patent, \\"Specification of William Alltoft Summers and Nathaniel Ogle: Steam-engine and Other Boilers\\" was published by the Queen's Print Office in 1854. In around 1830 or 1831, Summers and Ogle, based at the Iron Foundry, Millbrook, Southampton, made two, three-wheeled steam carriages. In 1831, Ogle gave evidence on the steam carriage to the \\"Select Committee of the House of Commons on Steam Carriages\\". In 1832, one of the steam carriages travelled, via Oxford, to Birmingham and Liverpool. A June 1833 newspaper report described a demonstration in London: In 1834, two companies were founded at Millbrook. They were Summers, Day and Baldock and Summers, Groves and Day. In 1837, both companies moved to Northam, Southampton.  Day, Summers and Company  Groves left in 1845 and Baldock left in 1854. At some point the two companies merged and became Day, Summers and Company. The first locomotive was \\"Jefferson\\" built in 1837, a for the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad in America. Its engines were generally of the Stephenson \\"Planet\\" type. A further was built in 1839 for the London and Greenwich Railway. This was modified soon after delivery by the addition of a trailing axle making it . Two more locomotives were built for the London and Southampton Railway and two for Bourne, Bartley and Company. Of the latter, one was sold on to the North Union Railway and the other to the Bolton and Leigh Railway. Both were withdrawn before 1846. When the London and South Western Railway opened in 1838, Summers Grove and Day carried out much of its repair work into the 1850s, complementing Nine Elms at the other end of the line. Other new engines may have been built but the records are sparse.

It is one of many Convivial Edinburgh Societies which were extant in the 18th century, but the only (known) one which survives to the present day. It was founded initially to support a Scottish Militia.\\"Old and New Edinburgh\\" It is known mostly for its connections to the poet Robert Fergusson.  The original Edinburgh Cape Club  The club was founded in the 1700s but not formally constituted until 1764. Its main meeting place was The Isle of Man Arms, at the bottom of Craigs Close in the Old Town of Edinburgh. It met on a nightly basis, where \\"high jinks\\" would ensue. Its insignia were a cape, or crown, worn by the Sovereign of the Cape, and two maces in the form of huge steel pokers (which can still be seen the National Museum of Scotland). Tom Lancashire was the first Sovereign of the club after 1764, as Sir Cape ‚Äì all members took a Knights pseudonym upon joining ‚Äì while the title of Sir Poker was taken by its oldest member, James Aitken. David Herd (a collector of Scottish Ballad Poetry) succeeded Lancashire as Sovereign and took the pseudonym Sir Scrape. The Knight Recorder (Club Secretary) of this time was Jacob More, the Scottish Landscape Painter. When a Knight of the Cape was inaugurated he was led forward by his sponsors, and kneeling before the Sovereign, had to grasp the poker and take an oath of fidelity, while all Knights stood with Pokers raised to acknowledge acceptance: Among the more famous members of the original Cape were Deacon William Brodie (the inspiration behind Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\") and painters Alexander Runciman and Sir Henry Raeburn. The entrance fee to the club was originally half-a-crown, but eventually it rose to a guinea, but so economical were its members, that among the last entries in the minutes of this time was one to the effect that suppers should be at \\"the old price of 4 and a half Pennies a head\\". Robert Fergusson and The Cape Club Fergusson joined the Cape Club in October 1772. Delighting in its quasi-masonic rituals, Fergusson took on the nickname 'Sir Precenter', and hymned the Cape's exploits. A drawing of him is thought to survive in the Club's Minute Book (National Library of Scotland). At the Cape he mixed with ordinary tradesmen as well as with artistic figures such as David Herd and Alexander Runciman, who painted Fergusson's portrait, now in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, and to whom Fergusson addressed some comic verses. Fergusson also wrote the Poem \\"Auld Reekie\\", which he dedicated to his fellow Knights of The Cape. On 2 July 1774 the Cape Club took up a collection to aid Fergusson after the onset of his illness. He died on 17 October 1774, and was buried on 19 October in the Canongate Kirkyard. Present day Edinburgh Cape Society The Edinburgh Cape Society was reconstituted in the 1960s, following the research of James Grubb, who became The Cape Society's first Sovereign after reconstitution, aka Sir Dun Eiden. To this day, the Society holds its monthly meetings in Edinburgh.

He was born at Whittlesey on 28 February 1930, which was part of the Isle of Ely in Cambridgeshire, and the Fens inspired much of his work. Before becoming a full-time writer in the late 1960s, he completed National Service and worked in adult education for the Peterborough City Education Authority, he also worked with the Workers' Educational Association (WEA). His first volume of poetry (North Bank Night) was published in 1969 in the Phoenix Living Poets series.Storey, E. (1969 & 1970) North Bank Night Chatto & Windus; one of very few in the series to have a second impression printed. In one of his early works Portrait of the Fen Country (1971) he reflected upon his childhood understanding of the world as it was shaped by his fenland experience. In Fen Boy First (1992) published by Robert Hale Ltd he gave an account of his childhood growing up in Whittlesey, and in Fen Country Christmas (1995) he collected a number of stories, legends and fenland superstitions. He was one of the founder members of the John Clare Society and the literature panel of the Eastern Arts Association. He moved to Wales in 1999. For many years he was President of The Friends of St Michael's, the church next to his home in Discoed; the Friends association fundraises for the restoration of the building and for other causes through arts events. New poetry collections, inspired by the local border country and other sources, were written for the Friends of St Michael's under a self-publishing imprint. Seeing the Light published Leverett Press in 2015 is just one of these works. Edward Storey died at his home in Discoed early on the morning of 18 November 2018. The funeral service took place at St. Michaels church, Discoed on 5 December. Edward Storey's poems and libretti have been set to music by Trevor Hold, Adrian Williams, David Twigg, Cecilia MacDowell, Trevor Jones and others, leading to performances and/or recordings. Recent CD recordings of musical settings of Edward's poems are 'Pure Music' featuring Voller String Quartet and mezzo-soprano Zarah Hible, and 'Spirit Songs' featuring soprano Louise Wayman accompanied by pianist Sarah Gard.

Background: Hohenzollern Castle and Hohenzollern mountain. The term Albtrauf (Alp escarpment) refers to the northwest facing escarpment of the Swabian Alps, situated in Baden-W√ºrttemberg and Bavaria. It is the most distinctive stepped slope within the alpine region of the South German Scarplands, leading roughly from the southwest to the northeast. The Albtrauf has its geological extension in the northeast, in the stepped slopes of the Franconian Jura and in the southwest and west among the Jurassic-era stepped slopes of the Baaralb, Hegaualb, Randen, Klettgau, Aargau as well as the Table Jura stretches from the city of Basel to the Ajoie and the French Scarplands. In geology and geomorphology, however, the term ‚ÄúTrauf‚Äù merely describes the brink of the stepped slopes where various stepped surfaces meet (which is not developed in hipped steps).  Geography  Swabian Alps Like the entirety of the Swabian Alps, the Albtrauf leads from the southwest to the northeast, approximately following the line of Donaueschingen‚ÄìLemberg‚ÄìBalingen‚ÄìReutlingen‚ÄìKirchheim unter Teck‚ÄìGingen an der Fils‚ÄìUnterkochen. On a closer look it is markedly interrupted by many deeply eroded valleys. The protruding inliers and outliers (German: Zeugenberge) support famous castles, which are visible from a great distance, such as the Hohenzollern Castle, the Hohenneuffen Castle and the Teck Castle. Major traffic routes leading from the alpine foothills to the Albtrauf are known as the Alb ascension (German: Albaufstieg), the best known of them being the Geislinger Steige.  Geology  left Albtrauf. Foreground: Neuffen and Hohenneuffen Castle; left: Beuren; furthest back : Teck Castle (Mid Alps)The Albtrauf is made up of an upper rock layer of the Brown Jurassic and lower and middle layers of the White Jurassic. The harder layers of the Brown Jurassic act as the foundation of this bed and so form the highest, often weakly developed layer of the Alpine foothills. The Brown Jurassic differs regionally: Sandflaserschichten (Quenstedtsche Gliederung B Œ≤) in the eastern Alps, Blaukalke (B Œ≥) in the mid Alps, oolithische Kalkmergel (B Œ¥) in the western Alps. The lower section of the stepped slope are made up of the claystone layers of the Brown Jurassic, stretching to the Ornatenton Formation which ends this section. The equally soft Kalkmergel (W Œ±) follows as the first layer of the White Jurassic. Hard limestone acts as a layer-former in the W Œ≤, (as reef limestone in the western Alps, and otherwise as the mural Wohlgeschichtete Kalk Formation), as well as in the W Œ¥ (reef limestone is found across the whole region, but especially in the young layers). In between these is a marl complex.  Geomorphology  Albtrauf, viewed from T√ºbingen Albtrauf viewed from Irrenberg, with Hohenzollern Castle and Heiligenkopf. The intermediate inclination of the Albtrauf amounts to roughly 35 degrees. In the Erms valley region and near Balingen the Albtrauf reaches an average height of nearly 400m. The edge of the slope is at approximately 1000 metres above sea level (German: Normalh√∂hennull, English: standard elevation zero) in the southwest and at approximately 650 metres above sea level in the northeast. In the Eastern Alps and in parts of the Mid Alps (up to Bad Urach) W √ü does not appear as a layer-former, but as escarpment in the slope which climbs up to the W Œ¥. W √ü and W Œ¥ levels, the latter being about 100 m high, are distinctly pronounced from Reutlingen to M√∂ssingen. Further to the west the W √ü forms both the front of the Albtrauf and an adjoining dip slope, which is several kilometres broad. Moreover, the W Œ¥ step, which includes inliers and outliers located on the outskirts such as Kornb√ºhl, is receding. Retrogressive erosion has caused the Albtrauf to recede southeast by an average of few millimeters each year. This process is responsible for the deep dips and embayment along the Albtrauf. Landslides and rockfalls also contribute to this process. The ensemble of relief features includes cuestas, front side valleys, rock ledges, spurs and inliers. The most famous inliers and outliers without a dip slope include, from northeast to southwest, Ipf, Hohenstaufen, Achalm and Hohenzollern (Zoller). Kaltes Feld, Michelsberg, Farrenberg, the plateau of Burgfelden (B√∂llat-Heersberg) and Plettenberg rank among the most impressive inliers and outliers with a dip slope.  Miscellaneous  The vegetation consists mainly of beech wood forest. Juniper heathland, typical of the high plains of the Swabian Alps, can also be found in scattered locations, such as on Jusi, and is generally under conservation. Slow-growing oaks grow on the rocky outcrops. Spruce and fir forest can also be found in the Hohen Schwabenalb (high Swabian Alps) as a result of forestry atypical for the area. White outcrops of reef limestone protruding out of the forest all around are also characteristic. The Albtrauf was poetically dubbed ‚ÄúBlue Wall‚Äù by Eduard M√∂rike, owing to the pale blue shimmer that appears when it is viewed from a distance. The Schw√§bische-Alb-Nordrand-Weg (Hauptwanderweg 1, HW 1), a hiking trail maintained by the Schw√§bischen Albverein (Swabian Jura Association), provides access to the Albtrauf and leads from Donauw√∂rth to Tuttlingen.

It followed the daily travails of two friends, Dr. Bob Graham and Sam Ryder, and the two women they loved. When Dr. Bob was a young man doing military service, his sergeant took care of him during a difficult time. Years later, the sergeant's dying request was that Bob become guardian of his two young daughters. Dr. Bob fell in love with Ruth Ann and Sam with her twin sister, Janet. In a typical episode, Janet and Dr. Bob are together in his living room. Janet, who has been reading an art magazine, asks him if she can move one of his pictures to a place on the wall where it will get better light. Bringing a ladder from the pantry, he starts to help her. However, he has to leave when he receives a telephone call about a baby who has swallowed a button. Sam comes in to help Janet who is on the ladder. When she falls from the ladder, he catches her, and resting in his arms, she realizes for the first time that she has always loved him. Hugh Studebaker had the role of Dr. Bob and Olan Soul√© portrayed Sam Ryder. Also in the cast were Marjorie Hannan and Patricia Dunlap. Russ Young and Don Gordon were the announcers. Scripts and sponsors The series was scripted by Bess McAllister Flynn, who lived in Des Plaines, Illinois during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1939, she reworked her plotlines into a book, Bachelor's Children: A Synopsis of the Radio Program, which summarized the story from the beginning to March 1, 1939. Published as a promotional product by Old Dutch Cleanser, the 25-page book included photographs of Bess Flynn, as well as the program's leading characters: Dr. Bob, Ruth Ann, Janet, Ellen, Russ, Sam and the dog Rusty. The dedication read: :This story of Bachelor's Children is dedicated to the radio audience of America by the makers of Old Dutch Cleanser in the interest of better cleaning. The loyalty and friendly interest of this great audience is evidenced by the thousands upon thousands of letters we have received. We trust that Bachelor's Children will entertain you in the future as it has in the past, and that Old Dutch Cleanser will merit your continued use. On CBS, Bachelor's Children was sponsored by Old Dutch Cleanser from 1936 to 1941. In 1941‚Äì42, on NBC, it was sponsored by Colgate. Wonder Bread was the sponsor when the show returned to CBS from 1942 to 1946.

It was established on December 5, 1973 at the 23rd Consultative Committee Meeting of the Colombo Plan held in Wellington, New Zealand to assist the member countries of the Colombo Plan in developing and enhancing their technician education systems. It became operational in 1974 with the Republic of Singapore serving as the first host Government. In January 1987, CPSC moved to Manila, Philippines upon the invitation of the Philippine Government. History Responding to the need to improve the quality of technician education and training, the Member Governments of the Colombo Plan considered the recommendation of the Singapore Colloquium in May 1969 to establish a Regional Center for Technician Teacher Training. Adopted during the 20th Consultative Committee Meeting in Canada in October 1969, the said recommendation was firmed up into a feasibility study which was conducted from March to June 1970. Results were presented during the 21st Consultative Committee Meeting (CCM), referred for Further Study and examined by a working party of experts in February 1971, October 1971 and February 1972, respectively. After a thorough scrutiny, it was finally approved during the 22nd CCM in November 1972. A Memorandum of Understanding relating to the establishment of the Colombo Plan Staff College for Technician Education (CPSC) as a regional center followed during the 23rd CCM in December 1973. Member Countries CPSC Member CountriesCPSC was founded by 26 countries which include Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Canada, Fiji Islands, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Khmer Republic, Republic of Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Republic of Maldives, Myanmar (Burma), Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States of America and the Republic of Vietnam.

The said countries cooperated under south-south cooperation which has been the principal framework for CPSC‚Äôs programs and activities from its inception until now. CPSC has 26 member countries classified as charter and current members. There are sixteen (16) active member countries, twelve (12) charter member countries. Active Members      * Charter Members      Purpose & Functions  CPSC is a unique Inter- Governmental Organization (IGO), which consistently addresses issues in Technical and Vocational Education & Training in the Asia and the Pacific region. For over four decades, CPSC continues to assert its role in advancing human resources development across the region. The purpose of the Staff College is to improve the quality of technical education and training in the Colombo Plan region. This is done by meeting the needs for technician education of teacher educators and trainers and senior staff in the field, who can play a more active part in in-service training and staff development. The main functions of the Staff College include: * Provide courses of further professional education and training to persons responsible for the planning, development, administration and supervision of technician education and training and persons in key supporting roles; * Conduct conferences on various aspects of technician education and training; * Assist in the conduct of projects in the field of staff and curriculum development and other projects aimed at the effective utilization of resources for learning and teaching; * Promote, coordinate and undertake research and development activities; * Advise and assist member countries in developing their technician teacher education; * Collect and disseminate information on technician education and training.

Brix is known primarily as being the assumed origin of the Bruce family, who emigrated to Britain in the Middle Ages, settling in northern England and then southern Scotland. The family became a royal house with the accession of Robert the Bruce in 1306. The ruins of the castle of Brix are located near the village. Population Sights A family known variously as Bruis, Brus, Bruz is said to be responsible for the Adam Castle, the oldest monument in Brix.There is no evidence, other than unreliable late medieval sources, like the Battle Abbey Roll, to support a claim that another member of the family, Robert de Brix or de Brus, served under William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. (See: Emma Cownie, 2004, \\"Brus , Robert de (supp. d. 1094)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford, Oxford University Press.) Very little remains of the castle. The main square of Brix is called Place Robert Bruce. Many prominent members of the family mentioned above were named \\"Robert\\", including: Robert de Brus (1078-1138), the first member of the family known to have resided in Britain, and his descendant Robert the Bruce (1274‚Äì1329), also known as Robert I, King of Scotland. =Events= On the first weekend of October, the commune holds the St. Denis Fair, a tradition of the Cotentin.

It follows a 10-year-old American boy (played by Slater) who travels to China and has to take a panda cub to the reserve so it can reunite with its mother. The film was produced and distributed by Warner Bros. under their Family Entertainment label on August 25, 1995, and was preceded by the Looney Tunes short Carrotblanca in theaters. Plot Ryan Tyler's father Michael sends him a plane ticket so that he can visit him in China, where he works with pandas. Ryan is not sure he wants to go, but his mother says he can just come back if he doesn't like it. In China, Michael and his two companions, Ling, a young girl and champion translator, and Chu, Ling's grandfather who is very experienced with pandas track down a mother panda and place a radio collar on her. After they leave, she steps into a trap. Back at the reserve, Michael and the staff recognize from the radio signal that the panda is in danger. Just as Michael, Ling and Chu set out to visit the panda, Ryan arrives at the reserve. After some argument, Michael lets him come. The poachers who set up the trap, Shong and Po, accidentally shoot Michael in the ankle, and flee with the panda's cub. Michael and the mother panda are returned to the reserve by helicopter, and Ling, Chu, and Ryan look for the poachers. They eventually discover their hideout, and free the panda cub before Chu lets Ryan and Ling travel on their own because he has to return to the reserve. The poachers shoot the bridge that Ryan and Ling are crossing, and the two of them and the panda cub are washed downstream, but manage to make it to the surface. The second time they are washed downstream, the pair realize that they are covered in leeches upon resurfacing and are forced to remove all their clothing and wash themselves off in the lake. Ryan realizes that he can use the batteries in his watch to power the radio collar and enable his father to locate them. Attempting to make their way back to the reserve with the cub, they come upon a local village that grants them hospitality for protecting the cub. However, Shong and Po have also arrived. The villagers help the trio escape, but the poachers follow. Michael arrives and subdues the poachers, and he, Ryan, Ling, and the cub drive back to the reserve. The Chinese officials who were going to close the reserve see Ryan returning the cub and the cub reuniting with its mother and decide to let it remain open.

History Woolwich railway station is being built by Crossrail as part of the Crossrail (Elizabeth line) rail project. Crossrail is jointly sponsored by the Department for Transport (DfT) and Transport for London (TfL). The construction of a station at Woolwich was not proposed as part of the original Crossrail route. However, after talks between Greenwich London Borough Council and developer Berkeley Homes about the ¬£162 million required for the station, the House of Commons Select Committee recognised its inclusion in March 2007. Services The opening of the new station will reduce the journey time from Woolwich to Canary Wharf, Bond Street and Heathrow stations to just eight minutes, 21 minutes and 47 minutes respectively. When the Elizabeth line begins operations, the new station located on the south-east section of the route will see up to 12 trains an hour during peak hours, connecting south- east London and the Royal Docks with Canary Wharf, central London and beyond. The closest existing station is Woolwich Arsenal. The station itself is separate and will not serve as a direct interchange with the DLR and local National Rail services which are located at nearby Woolwich Arsenal. However, all three services will be within a short walking distance of each other, in addition to the existing Thames Clipper service from Woolwich Arsenal Pier to central London.http://www.thamesclippers.com/assets/img/TC_Route_Map_Key_APRIL2017-afac129089.jpg Site The station is being built on the south-east portion of the Crossrail line that ends at Abbey Wood, and is the penultimate station on this branch. The Woolwich redevelopment site at Royal Arsenal is a modern waterside housing and retail development area adjacent to the station. It is spread across approximately of land and is being developed by Berkeley Homes. The site is being developed with the construction of approximately 2,517 new homes, in addition to the 1,248 homes already built. The area is also to include a new cultural quarter known as Woolwich Works, as well as infrastructural developments such as retail stores, restaurants and cafes, offices, hotels and a cinema. Design The station box is long and below ground, and sits below a major housing development site. The station is built by Balfour Beatty after a design by Weston Williamson, Mott MacDonald and Arup Group (engineering). The station entrance in Dial Arch Square will feature a bronze-clad portal. Natural light will enter through the main entrance and ceiling into the ticket hall, whilst a connection to daylight is present below ground on the platforms. Set back from the main street and surrounded by a series of heritage listed buildings and a large retail unit, the station acts as a simple portal connecting all these elements together. The station entrance opens out on to Dial Arch Square, a green space, flanked by a series of Grade I and II listed buildings. In addition to enhancing the experience in and out of the station, the urban realm design also helps connect the station with the wider town centre. In addition to the station improvements, Crossrail has been working with the Royal Borough of Greenwich on proposals for improvements to the area around the station.

On March 1, 1971 the bank moved its head office from Belo Horizonte to S√£o Paulo and assumed its current name Banco Real S.A. History Clemente de Faria founded Banco da Lavoura de Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais state, on 16 June 1925. At that time, Brazil was going through a period of economic readjustment that held back economic development and particularly, industrial production, which had been expanding strongly since 1922. It was in the middle of this scenario of economic uncertainty that the lawyer Clemente de Faria - then 34 years old and quite popular as a result of a one-term mandate as state congressman - started a co-operative. The co-operative's objective was to offer credit to farmers in Minas Gerais, thus allowing them access to financial resources that would, in turn, give them the opportunity to develop their activities. Business at the co-operative grew quickly, despite the general economic uncertainty. In only two years, it transformed itself into a financial institution - the Banco da Lavoura de Minas Gerais (Farmer's Bank of MG) - all the while remaining faithful to its initial goal: providing small farmers with access to farm loans and opportunities to invest their money. Working with this constituency and adopting innovative solutions for the banking market of its time, \\"Lavoura\\", as it was called in Minas Gerais, began to distinguish itself. It attracted the attention of other bankers, who, laughingly, called the bank, \\"Clemente's little bank\\", thus was the reputation of its success in the market. However, this sense of humour did not keep them from adopting solutions and products pioneered by \\"Banco de Lavoura\\" for their own institutions, such as: personal credit, the economic account (very similar to today's savings account) and the idea of a \\"piggy bank\\". The process of continuous growth at Banco da Lavoura led to its transformation into a limited liability corporation in 1928. Already in the following year, resting on solid foundations, Banco da Lavoura was able to survive the difficulties engendered by the international financial crisis (the crash of '29), which in turn brought economic instability to Brazil and culminated in the revolution of 1930. Despite all that, Banco da Lavoura continued its expansion, opening its first branch in the city of Queluz, later renamed Conselheiro Lafayette. From then on, the bank grew by opening new branches and acquiring other institutions. In 1934, under the first Getulio Vargas government, the Lavoura bought Banco Comercial de Bom Sucesso. Two years later, while the economy signalled the shrinking importance of coffee exports for the Brazilian trade balance, Banco da Lavoura crossed the borders of Minas Gerais and opened its first branch outside the state, in the city of Rio de Janeiro. In 1937, already with 25 branches and 14 offices, Banco da Lavoura became the 25th largest financial institution in Brazil. The policy of expansion through the acquisition of other banks consolidated itself in 1937 with the purchase of Banco J. O. Resende and received a strong impulse in 1938. That year, Banco de Lavoura also acquired Banco Comercial de Alfenas, Banco de Pouso Alegre, Banco de Campanha and Banco Santaritense. Banco da Lavoura continued to consolidate its position as an active participant on the Brazilian financial market, counting on significant capital increases and the opening of new branches and offices in important locations, in addition to continuing its policy of acquiring other institutions. The bank arrived in S√£o Paulo, Brazil's financial centre, in 1945, when it opened its first branches in the capital of S√£o Paulo state. At that time, Brazil was going through considerable political turmoil, which led to the removal of Getulio Vargas and the end of the Estado Novo, established by Vargas in 1937. In 1948, the bank came to the north-east of Brazil, opening branches in the cities of Recife, Pernambuco state and Salvador in Bahia. At the same time, Banco da Lavoura set up business in Amap√°, thus helping with the integration of the then federal territory through the provision of credit for a company created to extract manganese, the mineral wealth of that region. In the same year, Dr. Aloyisio de Andrade Faria succeeded his father, who had died in October 1948 at the age of 57. Aloyisio Faria managed the bank by closely following his father's project and policies. Only 28 years at the time, he accomplished the goal of transforming Banco da Lavoura into a financial institution present all over Brazil. From 1948 until 1955, Banco da Lavouras expanded its network of branches in S√£o Paulo state and in the north-east of the country. It installed a branch in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul and acquired Banco do Norte do Brasil S.A., Alagoas, adding a network of 180 branches to the organisation. At that time, Banco da Lavoura became the largest private bank in Brazil. With its position in Brazil consolidated, the bank began its operations abroad. In 1957, it was the first Brazilian bank to open a representative office - which was to become a full agency in 1964 - in New York City. Also in 1957, it was the first bank to set up business in Brasilia, even before the inauguration of the future federal capital, thus receiving the \\"operating license No. 1\\". During the period from 1958 to 1966, Banco da Lavoura purchased Banco Vera Cruz, with a total of 346 branches, and created Banco Real de Investimentos S.A. The year 1969 was marked by important events, such as the creation of two additional financial businesses: Companhia Real de Investimentos (The Real Investment Company) and Companhia Real de Cr√©dito Imobili√°rio (The Real Property Loans Company), in addition to the purchase of Banco Mercantil de Niter√≥i. On 1 March 1971 the bank moved its head office from Belo Horizonte to S√£o Paulo and the bank assumed its current name Banco Real S.A.

It grows to tall with a trunk up to in diameter. The bark is dark grey, smooth in young trees, becoming scaly and shallowly fissured in mature trees. The shoots are green at first, becoming dull brown in the second year. The leaves are opposite, hard and leathery in texture, long and across, glossy dark green with a yellow petiole, variably unlobed or three-lobed (often on the same shoot); the lobes have an entire (toothless) margin. The flowers are yellow-green, produced in small pendulous corymbs. The fruit is a double samara with two rounded, winged seeds, the wings long, spread at an acute angle. It is one of the most drought- and heat-tolerant species in the genus, occurring on dry, sunny hillsides at moderate elevations. It is closely related to Acer monspessulanum from further north and west in Europe, differing from it in being a smaller, often shrubby tree, and in its smaller, evergreen leaves.

She was also the wife of Duke Georg August of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. She was a great philanthropist and many of the organisations she supported and helped to create still operate today. Biography = Early life = Catherine and her sister Maria c.1837 Catherine was born on 28 August 1827 in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, almost certainly in the recently completed Mikhailovsky Palace that was the primary residence of her parents. She was a younger sister of Grand Duchess Maria Mikhailovna of Russia and Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mikhailovna of Russia, as well as an older sister of Grand Duchess Alexandra Mikhailovna of Russia and Grand Duchess Anna Mikhailovna of Russia. Her mother took a great interest in her daughters and was very involved in their childhoods, raising them relatively strictly and personally selecting their teachers in subjects such as foreign languages, singing, and drawing. Unfortunately, Anna and Alexandra died in childhood while Elizabeth and Maria died only a year apart in 1845 and 1846 respectively. This meant that for much of her life, her mother had only Catherine on whom to focus her attention. Also in 1846, Catherine became 'Chief' of the Sergievsky Dragoon Regiment which would later receive her name, but the regiment disbanded in 1851. She received another regiment in 1856 which became known as \\"Her Imperial Majesty's Dragoon Regiment, Grand Duchess Ekaterina Mikhailovna.\\" In 1849, Catherine's father died suddenly at the age of fifty-one whilst in Warsaw, which spurred her mother to begin the charitable work that would be the legacy of both herself and Catherine. = Marriage and Issue = On 16 February 1851, Catherine married Duke Georg Alexander of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in St. Petersburg. Catherine \\"loved her husband deeply and selflessly,\\" despite a three-year age gap and the disapproval of her mother. Although the young couple ended up settling in the Mikhailovsky Palace with Elena, she supposedly did not get along very well with Georg. Nevertheless, the marriage produced five children of whom three lived to adulthood. On 12 July 1854, Catherine gave birth to a son named Nikolaus (or Nikolai) who \\"died immediately by birth.\\" On 16 January 1857, the couple's only surviving daughter was born and named Elena, presumably for Catherine's mother. Elena would go on to marry Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg and become Duchess Helene of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. After her husband's death she remarried, but had no issue from either husband. Catherine's third child, Duke Georg Alexander of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, was born on 6 June 1859 at the family's estate in Remplin, Germany. He would marry one of Catherine's ladies in waiting, Natalia Feodorovna Vanljarskaya, and have four children. Catherine severely disapproved of the marriage, and it became a point of contention between herself and her son until her death. Catherine photographed sometime between 1860 and 1870 Another daughter was born sometime in 1861 named Maria- Frederica who died soon after her birth. Finally on 17 June 1863, Catherine gave birth to her final child, Charles Michael, Duke of Mecklenburg, at Oranienbaum, Russia. He would never marry nor have issue, but lived much of his life in Russia and managed to flee shortly after being arrested following the February Revolution. Her husband died in June 1876 at the age of fifty, and Catherine would outlive him by eighteen years. = Later life and extensive charitable works = Catherine enjoyed a high position in St. Petersburg society, having her own court, and was \\"a strict woman, well aware of herself and her rank.\\" She was often seen in somewhat old-fashioned dresses containing much lace. By 1870, she had been made chairwoman of the St. Petersburg Women's Patriotic Society, which she had been a member of since 1847 and began to devote more time to helping her mother with some of her foundations. When her mother died in 1873, Catherine inherited the Mikhailovsky Palace which she used to continue many traditions begun by Elena involving the use of the palace for various arts and handicrafts exhibitions. She also began to take much more of an interest in the work begun by her mother and the list of charities she was patroness to grew exponentially. An incredibly small selection of these charities and organisations includes: * the St. Helena School * the Elisabeth Hospital for Young Children * the Clinical Institute (now the Institute for Advanced Medical Studies) * the Frebelev Society * the Berlin Society of Art Lovers She was also known to help almost everyone who applied to her for monetary assistance via petitions which she accepted each year around the major holidays. When Alexander II of Russia was assassinated in 1881, Catherine was asked by the mayor of St. Petersburg to help arrange a memorial to the Tsar. She accepted and even offered some of her own land adjacent to the Mikhailovsky Palace for it on the condition that the nearby trees were preserved as many of them had been there since the reign of Peter the Great. = Death and inheritance = At some point in either late 1893 or early 1894, Catherine became seriously ill with Influenza. While on her deathbed, she summoned Alexander III of Russia in order to approve the will she had had written. He inquired briefly about who had written it, but signed it directly and without first reading it. When Catherine finally died on 12 May 1894, she was buried in the Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, Saint Petersburg after a funeral procession from the Mikhailovsky Palace led by the Emperor himself. After the funeral, her will was examined and two issues were discovered. Firstly, she had practically disinherited her son Georg on account of his marriage, but asked, \\"May God grant them happiness and prosperity.\\" Secondly and most importantly, she had left the Mikhailovsky Palace to the princes of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (i.e. her daughter and youngest son) rather than the Imperial family. This was a problem as she didn't technically own the palace, it had been effectively on loan to her father and then to her, but upon her death should have reverted to the Imperial family as her heirs were not members of the Russian Orthodox Church. Sergei Witte recalled that, \\"The Emperor once said that it was very unpleasant for him that this historic palace, which belongs to the Imperial House, had passed, by some misunderstanding, into the hands of these princes.\\" He did not consider attempting to overrule the will, however, on account of the facts that Catherine had been very well respected in society and the whole ordeal was really his own fault as he did sign the will without reviewing its contents.

He was Governor of Costa Rica from 1713 to 1717 and Governor of Nicaragua from 1740 to 1745. He also held the post of Commander in Chief of the Army and strengthened the defenses of these two countries against foreign invasion. Spanish family origins The family name Lacayo de Briones originates from the town of Briones located in the province of La Rioja. The town is close to the city of Viana in the province of Navarre, where Jose Antonio was born. Because Lacayo de Briones held important administrative and military responsibilities in the two Central American countries he governed during Spanish colonial times, it is important to learn about the history of the regions, La Rioja and Navarre, from which his ancestral family members came, a history characterized by a constant struggle against foreign invasions and an effort to maintain order and tradition. Jos√© Antonio¬¥s direct ancestors, as well as Jos√© Antonio himself, undoubtedly had their character moulded by this ancient history, as their high public offices in military and civilian responsibilities shows. During the Basquisation in 1536 there were thirty Basque surnames in Briones, among which was the Lacayo last name. Possibly around that year (there is no confirmed date), Francisco Lacayo de Briones, one of Jos√© Antonio¬¥s earliest documented ancestors, was born. He was from noble origins and his manorial house in Briones had his coat of arms carved in stone at its entrance. Francisco married Francisca Dom√≠nguez y Rodr√≠guez in Miranda, Navarra, where they established their home. She was also of Basque origin, being from the village of Riezu, next to the city of Estella, both places in Navarra. Several of Francisco's descendants held high public offices, usually related to maintaining order and public peace. His great grandson, Marcos Lacayo de Briones y Orive in 1651 was named Mayor of Briones' Santa Hermandad del Estado de Hijosdalgo. Santa Hermandad, literally \\"holy brotherhood\\" in Spanish, was a type of military Peacekeeping association of armed individuals, which became characteristic of municipal life in medieval Spain, especially in Castile and they were for the most part religious confraternities with a military structure and ethos. Marcos was also Regidor for the same Estado de Hijosdalgo in the city Estella in 1671. Marcos' son, Josef Lacayo de Briones y Garc√≠a de Arag√≥n, who was the father of Jos√© Antonio Lacayo de Briones y Palacios, was a Lawyer in the Reales Consejos and was also named Regidor in the Estella in 1677. On January 29, 1679, Josef became Mayor of Briones¬¥ Santa Hermandad del Estado de los Caballeros Hijosdalgo. In 1693 and 1695, Josef was Governor and Jury of the city of Estella. Most certainly, the services rendered by Jos√© Antonio¬¥s direct ancestors to their regional governments and to the Crown, influenced his character and formed the basis for his distinguished and honourable performance in the high positions he held in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The times and conditions when Jos√© Antonio served, resembled in many ways those his ancestors had to confront. Summary Biography Jos√© Antonio Lacayo de Briones y Palacios, was born into a noble family on August 13, 1679 in Viana, Navarre. He was the son of Josef Lacayo de Briones y Garc√≠a de Arag√≥n and Teresa Palacios Amescua. He married B√°rbara Rosa de Pomar y Villegas in 1711 in Granada, Nicaragua. B√°rbara Rosa was also a native of Viana. In about 1700, Lacayo entered the military service as a sergeant major in the service of the crown. He emigrated to Peru, then traveled to Guatemala, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. He ultimately settled in the city of Granada, Nicaragua. He became the progenitor of the Lacayo family of Nicaragua. Military career When the Governor of Costa Rica died, then president of the Audiencia, Lorenzo Antonio de Granda y Balb√≠n, named Lacayo as his replacement on December 11, 1712. Lacayo was, however, unable to assume his position immediately. He was preceded by two interim governors. Lacayo took office as governor on May 11, 1713. For several years, Lacayo held the position of Treasurer of the Seal of the provinces of Nicaragua and Costa Rica. As Sergeant Major, Lacayo endured a very difficult period in the area of Cartago near the Salto river, on the Costa Rican border of Nicoya and Nicaragua. There he encountered the Mosquito, Zambos and English invaders, and attacks by ships commanded by Irish pirates. Friar Bishop Benito Garret Arlovi accused the Sergeant Major and Mayor Lacayo de Briones of conducting illicit commerce with the English along the north coast. The Audiencia entrusted the investigation to Pedro Martinez de Ugarrio. On May 14, 1715, the Cartago municipal council and the regular and secular clergy ruled in favor of Lacayo. Friar Pablo de Otarola, abbot of the convent of San Francisco de Cartago, certified that the statement presented by the bishop was false and added that a great infamy had been committed. On November 15, 1718, due to the accusation by the interim government Lacayo was ordered by the Audiencia to leave Costa Rica. He left Costa Rica disguised as a Franciscan friar to avoid persecution. In June 1720, the order was rescinded and Lacayo was declared an honest, pure and justified minister, worthy of his Majesty's support. He was honored with employment by the Crown and rewarded for his service. Lacayo built the San Francisco de Esparza convent at his own expense. His previously confiscated property and the initial 2,000 ducats which he had been fined were returned. The Audiencia indicted Lacayo's accuser, Pedro Ruiz de Bustamante, and the Church excommunicated the monks who had perjured themselves. Commander-in-chief of the army After many years of service to the crown, in 1740 Nicaragua was attacked by Mosquitos and English General Handyse. On November 21, 1740, Lacayo was appointed governor of the province of Nicaragua. En route to Le√≥n, the governor was informed of an insurrection of the mulatto Antonio Padilla, captain of the mulatto soldiers. Lacayo confronted him and sentenced him to prison and finally, condemned him to death. Since Padilla was in a chapel, there were disturbances and in the middle of the night, the governor ordered him to be clubbed. At the order of Lacayo, the mulatto Padilla was dismemberedand his head and leg were placed on public display. This was a clear message to those who did not want to obey the representatives of the crown. The governor was a very active man, conducting an inventory of all armaments and establishing quarters in Le√≥n and Granada to confront the English invaders. The Audiencia reinforced the province with one hundred guns, fifty quintals of powder, six thousand bullets and other ammunition. In spite of this, the English incursions caused terror in northern departments of the province. To deal with this, the Spanish Court responded by sending to Nicaragua 800 guns, twelve pieces of artillery, ammunition, money, one hundred soldiers of the line of Havana with officers, sergeants and artillerymen, a galley and other aid. King Felipe V ordered that they organize militias throughout the Province, and recognized the ability of Governor Lacayo by naming him Commander-in-chief of the army on May 4. 1745. With the ascent of Lacayo, he named Francisco Antonio de Caceres Molinedo as Civil Governor. The appointment of Lacayo, who was much hated in Le√≥n, as the Commander-in-chief was the cause of a new secret uprising by Felipe Gamez the Master of a popular camp with the mulattos. Anticipating a new war, Lacayo was made Commanding General by Royal Decree on August 23, 1745, and permanently held the position until December 1746. These last years were the height of diplomacy, economics, and politics for the Spanish crown, during the reigns of Felipe V and his son Fernando VI. About this time, distinguished relatives of Jose Antonio Lacayo de Briones in Viana, kingdoms of Castile and Navarre attained prominent positions in society as illustrious personages. Among them were Faustino Lacayo de Briones who studied law in Alcala and Valladolid in 1705, Jose Lacayo de Briones, lawyer of the Royal Councils of Castile and Navarre, Manuel Lacayo de Briones also a lawyer of the Royal Councils of Castile and Navarre, and Rafael Lacayo de Briones, a lieutenant and captain of the General Staff in Burgos in 1751. All these Lacayo de Briones were enabled to study through a foundation of Isabel de Bedia of nearby Logro√±o, a relative of the Lacayos.

She was also one of eight athletes chosen to carry the World Trade Center flag into the Opening Ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics. Biography =Personal life= Parsley was born in Logan, West Virginia and is a direct descendant of the McCoy family of the famous Hatfield-McCoy feud. She grew up in Granville, Ohio where she served as a volunteer firefighter for 20 years and was inducted into the Granville High School Athletic Hall of Fame. =Athletic career= Collegiate Parsley was a two sport scholarship athlete at Marshall University competing in basketball and track and field. As a basketball player she was named second team All-Southern Conference, led the nation in free throw percentage her senior year and is one of only 14 female players in school history to score over 1,000 points. In addition she was All-Southern Conference in high jump and javelin and held the school record in the javelin. For her efforts on and off the field, she was twice named the Marshall University Female Athlete of the Year and was inducted into the Marshall University Athletic Hall of Fame in 2002. Olympic In 1998 she earned a position on the U.S. National Skeleton Team and competed for six years on the international world cup circuit. Her 1999 second-place finish in Norway was the first-ever women‚Äôs world cup medal for the United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation and she went on to earn a total of seven world cup medals along with numerous top 6 finishes.United States Olympic Committee ‚Äì Parsley, Lea Ann She placed fourth at the 2000 Goodwill Games, was the 2004 US National Champion and the silver medalist at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Games.Lea Ann Parsley ‚Äì Skeletonsport.com ‚Äì Athletes Her career ended as she attempted to qualify for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. She and several other teammates were struck by a runaway bobsled during a training session in Calgary Canada on October 19, 2005. The bobsled, which failed to brake after crossing the finish line, ejected out the end of the track and struck Parsley and teammate Noelle Pikus-Pace. Pikus- Pace, who was the reigning overall world cup leader at the time, suffered a compound fracture of her right leg that took her out of the running for a 2006 Olympic bid as well. Parsley suffered soft-tissue injuries to her right leg that severely hampered her ability to compete in the US team trials less than 72 hours after the accident. She stayed with the team however as an assistant coach and was part of the 2006 US Olympic Skeleton Team coaching staff.http://www.cbn.com/entertainment/Sports/700club_leaannparsley022006.aspx =Firefighting career= Parsley began working as a volunteer firefighter in 1985 and earned top graduate honors from the Ohio Fire Academy as a professional firefighter cadet in 1995. She was named the State of Ohio Firefighter of the Year in 1999 for her part in the rescue of a mother and daughter during a residential house fire. During her career as a structural firefighter, she served the Licking County Ohio area as a member of the Specialized Rescue Team, Hazardous Materials Response Team and the Licking County Honor Guard. She is currently a member of the Ohio Interagency Wild Fire Crew. =Academic career= While attending Marshall University Parsley earned a bachelor of science degree in adult health education (1990) and later earned a second bachelor's degree from the University of Virginia (1992) in nursing.

It is deciduous and may grow up to 17 metres tall. It can survive in a variety of soil types, occurring in many habitats, mostly open woodlands, often on soils deposited by rivers, and grows frequently on termite mounds. Its Zulu name ‚ÄúumLahlankosi‚Äù alludes to its use as a grave marker for tribal chiefs, while the Afrikaans name ‚ÄúBlinkblaar-wag-'n-bietjie‚Äù alludes to the shiny light green leaves and the hooked thorns.Orwa et al.,2009; Mazibuko, 2007;Ellis, 2003 Description bark The buffalo thorn is a small to medium size tree, reaching a height of about , or rarely . The bark is a red-brown (on young stems) or roughly mottled grey, cracked in small rectangular blocks revealing a stringy red underbark. The bark becomes rough and turns to a dark grey or brown colour. The shrub or tree has distinctive zigzag branchlets, armed with pairs of thorns, one hooked and the other straight. In some instances adult trees lose their thorns completely. The fruit vary in size but regionally may grow larger than grape, and ripen to a deep brown-red colour. From October to April the greenish yellow flowers with silvery sheen are found in dense bunches in the axils of the leaves. Fruit are found from February to August.  Ecology  Their small, greenish yellow flowers attract many insects. They produce abundant nectar and consequently yield honey.Nombulelo Mazibuko, Kwazulu Natal Herbarium, April 2007 Several species of bird feed on the brownish-red fruit. The leaves as well as fruit are also sought after by wild animals and domestic stock. Giraffes and impala browse the leaves. Uses It makes a good perimeter barrier as its thorns are rather profuse when young and are difficult to untangle because one point forward while the other points backward. Certain tribes believe the tree is safe to use as a shelter against lightning, and it may be planted as a grave marker for a deceased chief. = Medical uses = A blend made from the roots is used as painkillers and for dysentery while the bark and leaves are used for respiratory ailments and sepsis on the skin. A paste made from the roots and leaves will treat boils, sores and swelling. The above can be attributed to the peptide alkaloids and antifungal isolated from the bark and leaves. Branches are used for protection of cattle kraal and sometimes on the graves of dead tribal members. The wood is used for implement and fuel. The leaves bark and roots are used medicinally and magically for pain relief to respiratory complaints and skin infections, especially for chest and stomach disorders. The leaves if crushed may be used to stop bleeding. Steam baths from the bark are used to purify and improve the complexion. In east Africa, roots are used for treating snake bites.Watt, J.M. & Breyer-Brandwijk, M.G., 1932. The medicinal and poisonous plants of southern Africa. Livingstone, Edinburgh. =Nutritional uses= The leaves are edible and can be cooked into spinach. The seeds can be roasted and ground as a substitute for coffee.Heuz√© V., Tran G., 2017. Buffalo thorn (Ziziphus mucronata). Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. https://www.feedipedia.org/node/81 Last updated on July 17, 2017, 16:36 The fruit are not very tasty, though a type of beer can be made from them. The Ovambo people use it to distill ombike, a traditional liquor. The leaves and fruits are also a valuable source of forage for livestock. Cultural practices and beliefs Historically the Zulus planted a buffalo thorn on the grave of a deceased chief as a reminder of where the chief was buried, hence the Zulu name ‚ÄúumLahlankosi‚Äù, meaning ‚Äúthat which buries chief‚Äù. Even today a branch from the buffalo thorn is used to retrieve the spirit of a deceased person from where he or she died. A family member will go to the place where death occurred carrying a branch of the buffalo thorn which the spirit is able to hold onto. This will be taken back to the deceased homestead and the spirit will be given a new resting place. During the transportation of the spirit the carrier will at no time look backwards, he will pay for two seats on a bus or a taxi and communicate with the spirit explaining exactly what is transpiring. If for example they are to cross a river the holder will tell the spirit ‚Äúwe are now crossing the river, we will get a lift on the other side‚Äù, etc. According to a Zulu belief, a person standing under a buffalo thorn during a lightning storm is protected from a possible strike, as the tree is immune to lightning. They also believe that if buffalo thorn is cut down during summer a drought or hail storm will occur. When a stock owner died, and was buried according to custom, within the cattle or goat kraal, some branches were placed on the grave so that the animals nibbled on leaves and twigs, and so understood that their master had died. In other parts, Africans drag a branch around the village to protect it from evil spirits, as it is believed to keep evil spirits at bay.Palmer,E. & Pitman, N. 1972. Trees of South Africa.

The same study suggests an estimated total number of surgical mistakes at just over 4,000 per year in the United States; however, these statistics are extrapolations from small samples rather than actual event counts. United States A list of events was compiled by the National Quality Forum and updated in 2012.NQF 2012: List of SREs The NQF‚Äôs report recommends a national state-based event reporting system to improve the quality of patient care. # Artificial insemination with the wrong donor sperm or donor egg # Unintended retention of a foreign body in a patient after surgery or other procedure # Patient death or serious disability associated with patient elopement (disappearance) # Patient death or serious disability associated with a medication error (e.g., errors involving the wrong drug, dose, patient, time, rate, preparation or route of administration) # Patient death or serious disability associated with a hemolytic reaction due to the administration of ABO/HLA-incompatible blood or blood products # Patient death or serious disability associated with an electric shock or elective cardioversion while being cared for in a healthcare facility # Patient death or serious disability associated with a fall while being cared for in a healthcare facility # Surgery performed on the wrong body part # Surgery performed on the wrong patient # Wrong surgical procedure performed on a patient # Intraoperative or immediately postoperative death in an ASA Class I patient # Patient death or serious disability associated with the use of contaminated drugs, devices, or biologics provided by the healthcare facility # Patient death or serious disability associated with the use or function of a device in patient care, in which the device is used or functions other than as intended # Patient death or serious disability associated with intravascular air embolism that occurs while being cared for in a healthcare facility # Infant discharged to the wrong person # Patient suicide, or attempted suicide resulting in serious disability, while being cared for in a healthcare facility # Maternal death or serious disability associated with labor or delivery in a low-risk pregnancy while being cared for in a health care facility # Patient death or serious disability associated with hypoglycemia, the onset of which occurs while the patient is being cared for in a healthcare facility # Death or serious disability (kernicterus) associated with failure to identify and treat hyperbilirubinemia in neonates # Stage 3 or 4 pressure ulcers acquired after admission to a healthcare facility # Patient death or serious disability due to spinal manipulative therapy # Any incident in which a line designated for oxygen or other gas to be delivered to a patient contains the wrong gas or is contaminated by toxic substances # Patient death or serious disability associated with a burn incurred from any source while being cared for in a healthcare facility # Patient death or serious disability associated with the use of restraints or bedrails while being cared for in a healthcare facility # Any instance of care ordered by or provided by someone impersonating a physician, nurse, pharmacist, or other licensed healthcare provider # Abduction of a patient of any age # Sexual assault on a patient within or on the grounds of the healthcare facility # Death or significant injury of a patient or staff member resulting from a physical assault (i.e., battery) that occurs within or on the grounds of the healthcare facility , a little more than half of U.S. states have some version of a reporting system for never events. United Kingdom The National Patient Safety Agency produced a list of eight core never events in March 2009: # Wrong site surgery # Retained instrument postoperation # Wrong route administration of chemotherapy # Misplaced nasogastric or orogastric tube not detected before use # Inpatient suicide using non-collapsible rails # Escape from within the secure perimeter of medium or high security mental health services by patients who are transferred prisoners # In-hospital maternal death from post-partum haemorrhage after elective caesarean section # Intravenous administration of mis-selected concentrated potassium chloride NHS England produced a report on 148 reported never events in the period from April to September 2013 highlighting particular hospitals with more than one such event. NHS Improvement has produced monthly and cumulative annual reports since 2015, when the definition of what constitutes a Never Event in the NHS also changed to require not only actual patient harm but also the potential for significant actual harm.

A layer of counter ions of the opposite polarity to the surface charge exists close to the interface. It is formed due to attraction of counter-ions by the surface charges. This layer of higher ionic concentration is a part of the interfacial double layer. The concentration of the ions in this layer is higher as compared to the ionic strength of the liquid bulk. This leads to the higher electric conductivity of this layer. Smoluchowski was the first to recognize the importance of surface conductivity at the beginning of the 20th century.M. von Smoluchowski, Physik, Z., 6, 529 (1905) There is a detailed description of surface conductivity by Lyklema in \\"Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science\\"Lyklema, J. \\"Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science\\", vol. 2, Academic Press, 1995 The Double Layer (DL) has two regions, according to the well established Gouy-Chapman-Stern model. The upper level, which is in contact with the bulk liquid is the diffuse layer. The inner layer that is in contact with interface is the Stern layer. It is possible that the lateral motion of ions in both parts of the DL contributes to the surface conductivity. The contribution of the Stern layer is less well described. It is often called \\"additional surface conductivity\\".Dukhin, S.S. and Derjaguin, B.V. \\"Electrokinetic Phenomena\\", John Wiley and Sons, New York (1974) The theory of the surface conductivity of the diffuse part of the DL was developed by Bikerman.Bikerman, J.J. Z.Physik.Chem. A163, 378, 1933 He derived a simple equation that links surface conductivity Œ∫œÉ with the behaviour of ions at the interface. For symmetrical electrolyte and assuming identical ions diffusion coefficients D+=D‚àí=D it is given in the reference: : {\\\\kappa}^{\\\\sigma} = \\\\frac{4F^2Cz^2D(1+3m/z^2)}{RT\\\\kappa}\\\\left(\\\\cosh\\\\frac{zF\\\\zeta}{2RT}-1\\\\right) where :F is the Faraday constant :T is the absolute temperature :R is the gas constant :C is the ionic concentration in the bulk fluid :z is the ion valency :Œ∂ is the electrokinetic potential The parameter m characterizes the contribution of electro-osmosis to the motion of ions within the DL: : m = \\\\frac{2\\\\varepsilon_0\\\\varepsilon_m R^2T^2}{3\\\\eta F^2 D} The Dukhin number is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the contribution of the surface conductivity to a variety of electrokinetic phenomena, such as, electrophoresis and electroacoustic phenomena.Dukhin, A. S. and Goetz, P. J.

Experiments may be done to test this material property as in the n-type surface conductivity of p-type. Additionally, surface conductivity is measured in coupled phenomena such as photoconductivity, for example, for the metal oxide semiconductor ZnO. Surface conductivity differs from bulk conductivity for analogous reasons to the electrolyte solution case, where the charge carriers of holes (+1) and electrons (-1) play the role of ions in solution.

ADIZ boundaries for Alaska. The Air Defense Identification Zone of North America is an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) that covers the airspace surrounding the United States and Canada ‚Äì in which the ready identification, location, and control of civil aircraft over land or water is required in the interest of national security.Code of Federal Regulations: 14 CFR Part 99 - Security Control of Air Traffic This ADIZ is jointly administered by the civilian air traffic control authorities and the militaries of both nations, under the auspices of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) handles the requests of international aircraft and Transport Canada handles Canadian requests. Any aircraft flying in these zones without authorization may be identified as a threat and treated as an enemy aircraft, potentially leading to interception by fighter aircraft. An aircraft entering an ADIZ is required to radio its planned course, destination, and any additional details about its trip through the ADIZ to a higher authority, typically an air traffic controller. The aircraft must also be equipped with a radar transponder. History With the outbreak of World War II, the United States asserted control of coastal airspace in 1940,Searching the Skies: The Legacy of the United States Cold War Defense Radar Program, David F. Winkler, United States Air Force Air Combat Command, June 1997. and this took on a sense of urgency after the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor. However, by 1943 the Axis powers no longer posed a severe threat to the safety of North America. With the outbreak of the Korean War, the Air Force placed its forces on alert and uncovered major weaknesses in the coordination of domestic defense units. An air defense command and control structure was developed in 1950, creating five Air Defense Identification Zones around North America. If radio interrogation failed to identify an aircraft in the ADIZ, the Air Force launched interceptor aircraft to identify the intruder visually. The air defense system reached its peak in 1962, however with the deployment of the SS-6 ICBM in the USSR, strategic threats shifted overwhelmingly to ICBM attacks, and bomber intrusions were considered to be less of a threat. The ADIZ was focused on aircraft approaching primarily from the Soviet Union, but on October 26, 1971, a Cuban aircraft landed in New Orleans after flying completely undetected through American airspace.\\"The Gaps in Our Defense\\", Claude Witze, Air Force magazine (March 1972), pp. 33-39.66. Publicity and political pressure from Louisiana Congressman Felix Edward H√©bert forced the Air Force to establish the Southeast Air Defense Sector and open a radar network along the Gulf coast. In the 1980s with the rise of the War on Drugs, this ADIZ took on a dual role of controlling drug smuggling from Latin America. The role of the ADIZ diminished significantly in the 1990s with political changes in Russia and the reduction and attrition of Russian strategic aviation forces, but gained renewed importance during the following decade in the wake of the September 11 attacks, in which long-range aircraft on domestic flights were used against domestic targets ‚Äì the renewed importance placed on the ADIZ was despite the fact that none of the aircraft involved in the September 11 attacks crossed the ADIZ. United States The United States formally defines an ADIZ in the Code of Federal Regulations: 14 CFR Part 99. The ADIZ forms a transition zone in which aircraft come under positive identification and control by air traffic and defense authorities. With regards to applicability of the law, states \\"This subpart prescribes rules for operating civil aircraft in a defense area, or into, within, or out of the United States through an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), designated in subpart B\\". Moreover, the U.S. Navy's Commander's Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations states the ADIZ applies only to commercial aircraft intending to enter U.S. sovereign airspace, with a basis in international law of \\"the right of a nation to establish reasonable conditions of entry into its territory\\". The manual specifically instructs U.S. military aircraft to ignore the ADIZ of other states when operating in coastal areas: > The United States does not recognize the right of a coastal nation to apply > its ADIZ procedures to foreign aircraft not intending to enter national > airspace nor does the United States apply its ADIZ procedures to foreign > aircraft not intending to enter U.S. airspace. Accordingly, U.S. military > aircraft not intending to enter national airspace should not identify > themselves or otherwise comply with ADIZ procedures established by other > nations, unless the United States has specifically agreed to do so. A U.S. Air Force university dissertation states: > These regulations do not pertain to military aircraft, but to enter US > airspace, without inducing the scrambling of fighter interceptors, these > rules must be complied with and followed. The US does not claim sovereignty > over these zones per se, but does closely monitor and request information of > all objects entering the zone. In 2008 United States Northern Command commander Victor E. Renuart, Jr. said that although \\"we never let an unidentified aircraft come into our airspace\\" in a \\"post-9/11 world\\" and \\"determine who they are and what they‚Äôre doing,\\" \\"if it is a Russian aircraft on a training mission, we allow them to continue to do their job.\\"Rowan Scarborough (June 26, 2008) Russian flights smack of Cold War The Washington Times Canada The Canadian portion of the North American ADIZ is split into two parts: a western zone covering the approaches from the Pacific Ocean to British Columbia and a northeastern zone stretching from the Beaufort Sea in the Arctic Ocean to the Scotian Shelf in the Atlantic Ocean. These zones serve as national defence boundaries for aerial incursions into Canadian sovereign airspace. Any aircraft that wishes to fly in or through the boundary must file either a Defense Visual Flight Rules (DVFR) flight plan or an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight plan before crossing the ADIZ.Canadian Air Regulations 602.145 ‚Äì ADIZ Operations The aircraft must have an operational radar transponder and maintain two-way radio contact while approaching and crossing the North American ADIZ. Before May 2018, the Canadian ADIZ did not reach beyond 66¬∞ N, leaving parts of its sovereign airspace over the Canadian Arctic Archipelago uncovered.Transport Canada AIM, RAC 2.13 ‚Äì Canadian ADIZ With renewed interest in Arctic sovereignty, Canada has since adjusted its ADIZ to encompass all of its airspace and the approaches thereof whilst under the initiative of Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan.  Guam  The Federal regulation governing ADIZ areas also provides for an ADIZ around Guam. Though like Puerto Rico it is an unincorporated United States territory, the island is home to Andersen Air Force Base, which is one of two major U.S. Air Force strategic bomber bases in the Asia Pacific region, the other being Diego Garcia which is actually on British territory.  Washington, D.C. The Washington Air Defense Identification Zone (surrounds the National Capital Region, which is composed of counties of states in the immediate vicinity of the District of Columbia, plus the city of Baltimore) was created in 2003 though some sources refer to it as being created in response to the September 11 attacks. The reason for this confusion is that there are two other sets of flight restrictions over Washington, D.C. besides the DC ADIZ (Washington, DC Metropolitan Area Flight Restricted Zone, FRZ, & Special Federal Aviation Regulation 94, SFAR 94 or just plain Special Flight Rules Area, a zone which envelopes general aviation airports centered around Ronald Reagan airport) established for the purpose. This ADIZ, however, shared none of the regulatory similarity with the border area ADIZes. This airspace was subsequently renamed the DC Flight Restricted Zone and Special Flight Rules Area to avoid confusion.

There is strong evidence to prove that in the presidential popularity and party identification move together. For example, in the 1980s, there was strong support for Republican President Ronald Reagan. Although the number of Republicans did not actually increase, the voters simply responded to the political world. Another example of this occurred in the 1960s with the election of the popular Democratic President John F. Kennedy. Macropartisanship shows that people respond to the political world when making up their party identification. Older and more politically sophisticated people are less likely to take current events into account because they are more set in their ways. Normally, those affected by outside influences tend to be young, and/or weakly affiliated identifiers. Macropartisanship is one of several attempts made by political scientists in recent years to explain the disconnect between individuals who seem to be relatively uninformed on political matters and public opinion, which seems to respond rationally to political figures and events. The term macropartisanship was first used by American political scientists Michael MacKuen, Robert Erikson and James Stimson in 1989Mackuen, Michael D., Robert S. Erikson, and James A. Stimson. 1989. \\"Macropartisanship.\\" American Political Science Review 83(4):1125‚Äì1142. to describe the overall balance between the Republican and Democratic Parties in the United States. In the work of MacKuen and his colleagues, as well as in the later work drawing on the concept, macropartisanship theory begins with the notion that short-term shifts in the party balance are systematic, rather than random (as in the \\"non-attitudes\\" explanation put forward by Converse in \\"The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics,\\" 1964). These shifts can be the result of presidential popularity, subjective views of the economy, or political events such as wars or scandals, and are measured through the series of party identification questions used on a variety of surveys. While this work has been widely cited, it has not been non-controversial. The most serious criticisms of this findings come from a measurement theory perspective, and argue that much of the variation in party identification is due to measurement error, rather than any real change.Green, Donald, Bradley Palmquist and Eric Schickler. 1998. \\"Macropartisanship: A Replication and Critique.\\" American Political Science Review 92(4):883‚Äì899.

The males have horns, and the females are polled (hornless); they have no wool on the face or legs, and they have long tails (normally left undocked). There are a number of varieties, bred for sheep farming in Wales. These are mainly colour variations, but some are being developed as separate breeds. Description The Welsh Mountain sheep is usually white with a white face with no wool on forehead or cheeks and white legs with no wool below the joint. Females are polled but rams usually have curved horns, although some are polled. The fleece is thick and moderately long and the tails are not normally docked. Breeders give a high priority to hardiness, milking ability, mothering quality and lamb survival. (Lambing percentage can be 130%, which rises to 180% under favourable conditions on improved pastures.) It was not always thus; the 18th-century English agriculturist Arthur Young described the Welsh Mountain sheep as \\"the most despicable of all types\\" and a judge at an agricultural show in the 1880s described it as \\"a diminutive ill-shapen animal with its shaggy coat more reminiscent of hair than of wool\\". Adaptations The Welsh Mountain sheep is well suited to the harsh environment in which it lives. It is small and sure- footed, able to pick its way over rock and scree, find shelter in stormy weather, dig through snow, climb walls and push through small gaps, make its way through bogs and find sufficient food in the most meagre pastures. In their native Wales they are kept on the hills or open mountain all year round, being rounded up a few times each year, and possibly being brought down to in- bye land at lambing time. Most flocks are descended from sheep that have grazed the same mountains for generations. There are stories of marauding sheep raiding dustbins in Blaenau Ffestiniog and of others rolling across cattle grids to access better pastures. Varieties There are a number of varieties of Welsh Mountain sheep, named for their locality of origin or their appearance. The standard Welsh Mountain sheep is completely white. It is the most common variety in the mountains of Wales and has been exported to other parts of the world. The Badger Face Welsh Mountain (Defaid Idloes, ) comes in two varieties, the Torddu (, \\"black-bellied\\"), which is white with a dark face and belly, and the Torwen (, \\"white-bellied\\"), which is black with a white belly and white stripes over the eyes. The Balwen Welsh Mountain is black (fading to brown in sunlight and greying with age) with a white blaze on the face, white socks on legs below hocks and a part-white tail. Black Welsh Mountain sheep (Defaid Mynydd Duon, ) are entirely black. Many flocks of white Welsh Mountains contain one or two black sheep, but these sheep are now also bred as a consistent black variety. The South Wales Mountain is similar to other Welsh Mountains, but is rather larger. It is white, with tan markings on legs and face, and a brown collar. Uses The Welsh Mountain sheep is a dual-purpose breed and is the foundation of the Welsh sheep industry. In the Middle Ages these sheep were predominantly kept for their wool and milk, but by the nineteenth century they had become renowned in England for their tasty meat and Queen Victoria is reported to have demanded Welsh lamb at the royal table. The fleece of the Welsh Mountain sheep varies considerably across the range of varieties. That of the large South Wales Mountain sheep contains a high proportion of kemp, whereas the fleece of the Black Welsh Mountain sheep is fine and soft, contains very little kemp and is attractive to hand- spinners. A typical fleece of this black variety weighs around with a staple length of . The meat of the Welsh Mountain lamb is much esteemed, and carcasses have often won prizes at shows like the Royal Smithfield in London. The carcass of a pure-bred Welsh Mountain lamb is usually within the range whereas a lamb from a cross between a Welsh ewe and a down breed ram, or a lamb raised on improved land, is larger at around .

Interactions of the proton beam in the target produce mesons, primarily pions and kaons, which are focused toward the beam axis by two magnetic horns. The mesons then decay into muons and neutrinos during their flight through a long decay tunnel. A hadron absorber downstream of the decay tunnel removes the remaining protons and mesons from the beam. The muons are absorbed by the subsequent earth shield, while the neutrinos continue through it to the MINERŒΩA, MINOS, and NOvA near detectors on-site at Fermilab. The neutrinos then travel through the Earth to the MINOS far detector cavern in the Soudan Mine 735 km away and the NOvA far detector 810 km away at Ash River, MN, then onwards into space.

Matak) located in the West Bank, between Ramallah/Beituniya and Giv'at Ze'ev. It is one of three facilities of the same nature, including the Megiddo (com.) and Ktzi'ot prisons. Ofer Prison is run by the Israel Prison Service and like the other two facilities, used to be operated by the Israel Defense Forces' Military Police Corps. When under IDF control, it was capable of holding up to 800 prisoners, both tried and those under administrative detention. As of September 2016, it holds about 1,250 Palestinian prisoners. History Camp Ofer was founded in December 1968, at the location of a former Jordanian Army base from before the Six-Day War. It was named after lieutenant colonel Zvi Ofer, the commander of the Haruv Reconnaissance Unit, who was killed in action earlier in the same year. The prison was built in the base in 1988, after the onset of the First Intifada. Following the Oslo Accords, and the numerous prisoner releases of 1995, Ofer's remaining prisoners and detainees were moved to Megiddo Prison, and Ofer was closed. It was finally officially re-opened on March 29, 2002, as part of Operation Defensive Shield. Its full construction was set to be completed on August 10, 2002. On October 3, 2006, control of Ofer Prison was moved to the Israel Prison Service, making it the last incarceration facility for Palestinians to be moved to the IPS (although two detention centers in the West Bank are still controlled by the Military Police Corps). Human Rights abuses Non- governmental organizations such has Machsom Watch have continuously reported the imprisonment of children in Ofer Prison. A delegation of British MPs visiting the facilities alleged human rights abuses: Arguably more concerning observations were made by a delegation of leading British lawyers who also visited the facilities and observed the use of iron shackles on children, which they considered to be in breach of Article 40 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the UN Standard Minimum Rules.Sedley, S., Scotland, P., Oldham, F., Hildyard, M., Khan, J., Harrill, J., Lanchin, J., Davies, G., & Mason, M.

(Available at www.childreninmilitarycustody.org ) Staff As of 2006, Ofer Prison is staffed by the Israel Prison Service, which took control of it in 2006. The staff consists of jailors and officers, as well as a contingent of IPS's special unit, Rapid Response Unit (Keter), and interrogators from the Shabak. Before IPS, the prison was run by the IDF's Military Police Corps. The staff included soldiers who completed the Palestinian detainees' jailors (, Metaplei Atzurei HaShtahim) course, including the Company for Special Tasks (abbr. Palmam).

It has been recognized as a natural floristic area since 1872 August Grisebach's volume Die Vegetation der Erde and later delineated by such geobotanists as Ludwig Diels, Adolf Engler (as Temperate Eastern region), Ronald Good (as Sino-Japanese Region) and Armen Takhtajan. The Eastern Asiatic Region is dominated by very old lineages of gymnosperms and woody plant families and is thought to be the cradle of the Holarctic flora. Moreover, this floristic region wasn't significantly glaciated in the Pleistocene, and many relict Tertiary genera (such as Metasequoia glyptostroboides, ancestors of which were once common throughout the Northern Hemisphere up to subpolar latitudes) found refuge here. Endemic flora The Eastern Asiatic Region endemic flora is characterized by: =Endemic families= *about 30 endemic families, including: Ginkgoaceae, Sciadopityaceae, Trochodendraceae, Tetracentraceae, Cercidiphyllaceae, Circaeasteraceae, Eucommiaceae, Eupteleaceae, Sargentodoxaceae, Nandinaceae, Pteridophyllaceae, Rhoipteleaceae, Stachyuraceae, Sladeniaceae, Dipentodontaceae, Helwingiaceae. =Endemic genera= *three to six hundred endemic genera, including: Cephalotaxus, Amentotaxus, Pseudotaxus, Keteleeria, Pseudolarix, Cathaya, Metasequoia, Cryptomeria, Microbiota, Akebia, Kingdonia, Megaleranthis, Hylomecon, Eomecon, –ú–∞cleaya, Disanthus, Loropetalum, Corylopsis, Fortunearia, Sinowilsonia, Pteroceltis, Idesia, Bolbostemma, Schizopeppon, Clematoclethra, Bryanthus, Schizocodon, Stephanandra, Rhodotypos, Kerria, Chaenomeles, Rhaphiolepis, Prinsepia, Dichotomanthes, Kirengeshoma, Tanakaea, Maakia, Phellodendron, Poncirus, Psilopeganum, –¢–∞piscia, Dipteronia, Fatsia, Tetrapanax, Diplopanax, Evodiopanax, Kalopanax, Hovenia, Dipelta, Kolkwitzia, Oreocharis, Paulownia, Ombrocharis, Paralamium, Perillula, Popoviocodonia, Platycodon, Hanabusaya, Callistephus, Parasenecio, Symphyllocarpus, Chionographis, Metanarthecium, Heloniopsis, Tricyrtis, Cardiocrinum, Hosta, Reineckea, Nomocharis, Milula, Rohdea, Liriope, Aspidistra, Lycoris, Sasa, Phyllostachys, Oreocalamus, Shibataea, Phaenosperma, Chikusichloa, Trachycarpus, and Pinellia. Approximately eight other families are shared with tropical Southeast Asia (Nageiaceae, Rhodoleiaceae, Daphniphyllaceae, Pentaphyllaceae, Duabangaceae, Mastixiaceae, Pentaphragmataceae, Lowiaceae). As has long been noted, many relict genera occurring in East Asia, such as Liriodendron and Hamamelis, are shared with temperate North America, especially the North American Atlantic Region. Adjacent Regions The Eastern Asiatic Region is bordered by the Circumboreal Region of the Holarctic Kingdom in the north, the Irano-Turanian Region of the same kingdom in the west and Indian, Indochinese and Malesian Regions of the Paleotropical Kingdom in the south. It comprises the southern part of the Russian Far East, southern part of Sakhalin, Manchuria, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, relatively humid eastern part of the mainland China from Manchuria and the seashore to Eastern Himalaya and Kali Gandaki Valley in Nepal, including Sikkim, northern Burma and northernmost Vietnam (parts of Tonkin). Subdivisions According to a version of Takhtajan's classification, the Eastern Asiatic Region is further subdivided into 13 provinces; however, the number and delimitation of the southern provinces is disputed and varies even across Takhtajan's work. *Manchurian Province ::two endemic genera (Microbiota, Omphalothrix), many endemic species (including Abies holophylla, Picea koraiensis, Ulmus macrocarpa, Crataegus pinnatifida, Vitis amurensis) *Sakhalin-Hokkaido Province ::one endemic genus (Miyakea), some endemic species (including Abies sachalinensis, Fragaria yezoensis) *Japan-Korean Province *Ryukyu ProvinceNakamura, K., et al.

Listed at , 175 lb., Gonzales batted and threw right- handed. He was born in San Francisco, California, but moved to Los Angeles as a child. After graduating from Roosevelt High in 1933, Gonzales entered the University of Southern California, majoring in physical education and compiling a 19-game win streak while pitching for the Trojans baseball team. The Red Sox signed him out of USC and assigned him to the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League, from whom they called him up before the 1937 season was over. In eight games with the Red Sox, Joe Gonzales posted a 1‚Äì2 record with 11 strikeouts and a 4.35 ERA in 31.0 innings of work, including two starts and two complete games. That was the extent of his major league career, as the Red Sox farmed Gonzales out to the Little Rock Travelers of the Southern Association in 1938. He appeared as a pitcher and outfielder for a total of eleven minor league teams, making his last playing appearances while managing the Porterville Packers in the Sunset League in 1950. After retiring from baseball, Gonzales was a field judge in the National Football League for 21 seasons, wearing number 54. He officiated in Super Bowl III. He also served as a teacher and baseball coach at Westchester High School and as baseball coach at Loyola University. Gonzales died in Torrance, California, at age 81.

Since December 31, 2012, it has been part of the town of R√∂mhild.  Geography  Mendhausen is located in the southwest of R√∂mhild at the Thuringian-Frankish border on a higher plateau of the Thuringian Rh√∂n. ‚ÄúIn the morning this attractive village is bordered on the east parish of R√∂mhild, from where it is only one hour away, at lunchtime Irmelshausen, in the evening Rothausen and the deserted village Eichelbrunn and midnight at the M√∂nchshof...\\" Thus, the location of the village Mendhausen is described in the \\"Historical and statistical description of the Ducal Saxon Community Office R√∂mhild\\" of 1795. Density is low. The settlement has a church at its center.  History  The history of the town probably started in the 7th or 8th century, but this is not precisely known. Mendhausen was probably one of the three H√∂chheims founded at 783 (Great Hoechheim = the present Hoechheim, Small Hoechheim = M√∂nchshof) by the Frankish noble Countess Emhilt. The first Attribution \\"Mentehusen\\" comes from a deed of 1156 (Count Poppo of Irmelshausen, a Henneberger line). Mendhausen hosts the first church in the area: it was mother church of R√∂mhild until 1405. ‚ÄúAgriculture was the main food source of residents along with some spinning, bleaching, Livestock and wine ...\\". Between 1710 and 1918, the Duchy of Meiningen governed Mendhausen Mendhausen belonged to the district of the M√∂hnshof, which played a significant role in Mendhausen's development. M√∂nchshof was mentioned in a document at the time of Charles the Great. Charles was often a guest at the M√∂nchshof. The village was once surrounded by walls, known locally as Gaden (storage rooms). In 1796, the village had 280 inhabitants with 69 hearths (households). The 30 Years War reduced the population by more than 60%. In 1897 a school started next to the church, built in the vicinity of an earlier communal bakehouse. A tavern, three toy shops, a wheelwright and a blacksmith were available until the Second World War. Mendhausen was always a farming village. During the 1950s and 1960s, the collectivization of agriculture led to the elimination of individual farms. In 1969, a dairy farm arose. In the same year, work began on the construction of a potable water line followedby the construction of the sewage system. From 1968 to 1972, the House of Culture (a building for group events) arose. Citizens developed another division for athletes, called the athlete's home and a shop, where the youth club was later established. In 1988 the M√∂hnchshif was scheduled to be leveled, which was prevented by citizen opposition. After 1990, an apartment building area was developed for young families. Life  Clubs in the city are active. The sports club reached its 100th anniversary in 2011. FFW, founded in 1875, took an initiative to rebuild their old shed in 2010. The fair society is preserved by the continuation of costume carnival traditions. The women of the city founded a Carnival Club. The home club founded in 1999 maintains and preserves traditions and testimonies. The newly restored bakery and a small village museum are used and preserved by the club members.

The municipality is a member of the collective municipality Riechheimer Berg. Geography =Geographical Location= Alkersleben lies in the Wipfra depression between Ettischleben in the south and Elxleben in the north, six kilometres east of Arnstadt at an altitude of about 290 metres. In the west lies the 322 metre high Kirchheimer H√∂he, and in the east the landscape gradually inclines to a height of 393 metres, where both the Sichemberg and the commercial airfield are located. Alongside the Wipfra flowing through in a south-north direction, the municipal area is also completely free of forest and is used for farming. The area is a part of the Thuringian Basin and is characterised by fertile soil and a relatively dry climate. =Neighbouring Municipalities= Starting from the north and going in a clockwise direction: Elxleben, Elleben, Osthausen-W√ºlfershausen, B√∂sleben-W√ºllersleben, Dornheim, Arnstadt, Amt Wachsenburg. History In Alkersleben, a castle once secured the crossing of the road leading from Arnstadt in the direction of Lobeda via the Wipfra. A quadrilateral hill still bears witness to this past fortification.Michael K√∂hler: Th√ºringer Burgen und befestigte vor- und fr√ºhgeschichtliche Wohnpl√§tze. Jenzig-Verlag, 2001, , S. 47. The place was first recorded in 1257 as Alkersleibin. There was previously a Manor, whose lords, along with representatives from the Church, dictated life in the village. In 1816 a family acquired the manor. In 1844 the stone bridge crossing over the Wipfra was built. Until 1920 the village belonged to the Arnstadt department in the principality of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen (Oberherrschaft), and on the 1 July 1950 the village incorporated the independent municipality of Ettischleben. The religious establishment Dorfkirche St. Greogrius is traced back to a chapel from the 12th century and houses grand paintings from the baroque era. The cemetery was also classified as a protected monument. =Population Development= { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\"  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"100%\\"  * 1843 ‚Äì 309Quelle f√ºr schwarzburgische und s√§chsische Orte: Johann Friedrich Kratzsch: Lexicon der s√§mmtlichen Ortschaften der Deutschen Bundesstaaten.

Since the end of the 2005, a Dutch investor had been planning to erect a large pig farm with 22,500 animals and a slurry tank with a capacity of 6,500 cubic metres on the site of a former dairy farm, which had held 2,000 cows until the Wende. Owing to the controversy of the project, in particular the possible risk of odour nuisance over a wide area, more than 2000 objections were raised by citizens and organisations.Schweinezucht steht vor Genehmigung.

An anti-apartheid activist, Duncan was a supporter of universal suffrage who was harassed and imprisoned by the Apartheid regime for his dissident activities. Early life Born 1918 in Johannesburg, was the son of Sir Patrick Duncan. Duncan was educated first in South Africa and later in England, at Winchester College and at Balliol College, Oxford. In 1938 his friendship with a fellow Balliol student, Helmuth James Graf von Moltke, led to an invitation to stay with the von Moltke family in Germany: he thus came into contact with the anti-Nazi opposition group, the Kreisau Circle, and also spent three weeks in an Arbeitsdienst voluntary labour camp. Both experiences had a profound influence on him. In October 1939, having returned to South Africa, he travelled back to England hoping to join the army, but was rejected on medical grounds, because, since the age of 11, he had been lame, with a knee he couldn't bend due to an injury from a cricket ball that caused osteomyelitis. He went on to join HM Diplomatic Service in Basutoland in 1941 where he served as an Assistant District Officer before becoming Private Secretary to the High Commissioner, Sir Evelyn Baring, in Cape Town in 1946. In 1947 he returned to Lesotho as Assistant District Officer and became Judicial Commissioner in 1951. His book, Sotho Laws and Customs, a handbook based on decided cases in Basutoland together with the Laws of Lerotholi, was published in Cape Town by Oxford University Press in 1960, and reprinted in 2006. His Assessor, Chief Leabua Jonathan, in later years became Prime Minister of Lesotho. Duncan's approach to development in Africa was broad as well as original: he believed that soil erosion was a major issue of land management and published a pamphlet on this subject, entitled ‚ÄúThe Enemy‚Äù, in 1943 (Morija: Lesotho), under the pseudonym ‚ÄòMelanchthon‚Äô, Greek for ‚Äòblack earth‚Äô. Political career =In South Africa= After the National Party won the 1948 General Election in South Africa, Duncan decided to involve himself directly in South African politics. Four factors were especially important in influencing this decision. First, he had developed a profound horror of racism. Secondly, he had become deeply influenced by the theories of the Mahatma Gandhi, particularly the concept of satyagraha. Thirdly, he had by then realised that for the African majority in South Africa the constitutional politics of the time were meaningless and hopeless. Fourthly, he always had an intense feeling of personal destiny, partly as the consequence of his father‚Äôs career, which had culminated in his being Governor-General of the Union of South Africa. After his resignation from the Colonial Service in 1952, Duncan and his family moved to a farm in the Orange Free State on the border with Basutoland. In November 1952 the ANC and the South African Indian Congress agreed to his participation in their defiance campaign. With Manilal, son of the Mahatma, Duncan led a procession into the African location in Germiston, where they and others were arrested. Duncan was sentenced to three months‚Äô imprisonment with hard labour, for breaking the law requiring whites to possess a permit before visiting a location; he served only two weeks, as ill health forced him to pay a fine in lieu of the remainder of his sentence. At this point he was working closely with the Congress movement, but soon considerable mutual distrust developed as a result of his suspicions that the ANC was being manipulated by members of the South African Communist Party, which had been secretly revived in 1953. In 1955 Duncan joined the Liberal Party of South Africa, within which he was to become a radicalising influence, often evoking antipathy from its more conservative leaders. He worked as the National Organiser of the Liberal Party throughout 1956-57, although remained in close contact with the developing national movement in Basutoland and, in particular, with Chief Leabua Jonathan, whose BNP he helped found in late 1957 and early 1958. In 1958 the Duncans moved to Cape Town where Patrick started the newspaper Contact, directed at a non-racial readership. Contact, a fortnightly tabloid, became a vehicle for his radicalism and his hostility to communism. The newspaper aroused resentment for its strong stance on various issues: for instance, it attacked Albert Luthuli, leader of the ANC (for allegedly allowing the ANC to be dominated by communists); it also advocated immediate universal adult franchise (which alarmed the more conservative members of the Liberal Party). Although, given the nature of its largely impoverished readership, Contact never achieved massive sales, it nevertheless had considerable impact, achieved partly by its identification with African nationalist movements throughout the continent. Duncan represented the Liberal Party at the All- African Peoples' Conference at Accra in 1958. In 1959 he stood as the Liberal Party candidate in the Sea Point district of Cape Town for election to the Cape Provincial Council: in a forthright campaign, when asked if ‚ÄòNatives and Coloureds‚Äô should be allowed to swim in the famous Sea Point swimming pools, he replied ‚ÄúYes‚Äù. The result of the ‚Äòswimming pool election‚Äô was a win by the United Party candidate with 4476 votes, against Duncan‚Äôs 1505. His sympathy for nationalism, as well as his feelings about communism, led Duncan to support the anti-pass campaign led by the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) in 1960. In particular he played a crucial role in Cape Town during the negotiations between the PAC and the police after the march of 30,000 blacks from the townships into the city centre. The defeat of the campaign and the banning of the African political movements contributed to Duncan‚Äôs growing disillusion with solely non-violent opposition to apartheid. =In exile= In March 1961, Duncan was served the first of his banning orders, which tried to curtail his political activities and his movements round the country. During 1960 and 1961, reports in Contact on the Communist Party had attracted even more than usual attention from the security police, and in 1961 Duncan was arrested and imprisoned in Roeland Street police cells. Asked to disclose the sources of his information on the banned Communist party, he refused. After three weeks of continuing refusal, he was released but then charged with publishing ‚Äòsubversive literature‚Äô; Duncan refused to plead and wrote his own speech in defence of his actions, later published in Blom-Cooper‚Äôs anthology, The Law as Literature (London: Bodley Head 1961). In March 1962 he was served another banning order which restricted him to the magisterial district of Cape Town. Defying this order, Duncan drove overnight to the Free State in a car with a false number plate, and was driven in the boot of a friend‚Äôs car over the border into Basutoland, where he set up as a trader in two remote stores in the Quthing District, planning to use these as a base for further political activity in South Africa. In early 1963 he resigned from the Liberal Party and joined the PAC, the first white man to be accepted into its ranks. After corresponding with Robert F. Kennedy, Duncan visited America as a representative of the PAC to try to affect US policy on South Africa; he was still, at this stage, still very pro-American, and he received some encouragement from members of the Kennedy administration. In July 1963 he addressed the UN Special Committee on Apartheid. However, while Duncan and his family were visiting England, the Resident Commissioner of Basutoland declared him a prohibited immigrant in that country. Duncan continued to work in the PAC and, in 1964, was sent to investigate financial malpractices at the PAC office in Dar es Salaam. In the same year, he published South Africa‚Äôs Rule of Violence, an analysis of the violent repression of political protest in the country. He was appointed PAC representative for the North African countries, based in Algeria, where military training was being provided for PAC recruits: his ability to speak French stood him in good stead. However, in 1965 he was dismissed from his post: the reasons given included the fact that he had sent a personal letter congratulating his old friend and colleague, Chief Leabua Jonathan, on winning the Lesotho general election (the PAC was allied to Leabua's opponents, the BCP); and that, without waiting for an accord from Headquarters, he had recognised the new Government of Algeria formed by Houari Boumedienne after his coup d‚Äô√©tat in 1965. However, Duncan remained a PAC member, and he took the decision to stay in Algeria, where he found work within a relief organisation, Comit√© Chr√©tien de Service en Algerie, part of the World Council of Churches. During the years 1964-7 he deepened the ideas he had first expressed in The Enemy in 1943 about the effect of humans on what is now called ‚Äòbiodiversity‚Äô, and wrote Man and the Earth (published posthumously in 1975.). This analysis of the way people exploit the planet had a breadth which was exceptional at the time, and covered detailed issues in politics, history and science. He propounded an ethical system which he called ‚ÄòGeism‚Äô, ‚Äòa new morality based on the totality of the planet‚Äô. Though such ideas on what is now called sustainable development were beginning then to be familiar when applied at a local level (see for instance the ‚Äòhima‚Äô concept in Arabia), Duncan‚Äôs special contribution was his call for a response, at a global level, to environmental challenges, within a broad ethical, philosophical and spiritual perspective. This scholarly work is remarkable since it proposes an approach to dealing with the challenges at a prescient date (the mid-1960s), and at a time when Duncan might have been preoccupied with the more immediate struggle against apartheid. Personal life Married to Cynthia Ashley Cooper (later Lady Bryan) in 1947, he had two sons and two daughters. While working for the relief organisation in Algeria, Duncan contracted a blood disease, aplastic anaemia and died in London, in 1967.Patrick Duncan, Apartheid Foe, 48; Son of Ex-British Governor in South Africa Dies, New York Times, June 6, 1967 See also *List of people subject to banning orders under apartheid Notes and references 1964.

Rembrandt was split into Remgro (an investment company with financial, mining and industrial interests) and Richemont (a Swiss-based luxury goods group). History Dr Rupert originally established the tobacco company \\"Voorbrand\\" in the 1940s. He soon renamed it Rembrandt Ltd. The first Rembrandt cigarettes were manufactured in an old flour mill in Paarl. Four years later Rupert introduced the world to the first king-sized cigarette filter. It was a wild success and it was on the back of this and a R1,5 million loan from Sanlam that Rembrandt's vast overseas empire was built. In 1968, it incorporated Remgro as an investment holding company with interests in financial, mining and industrial interests. In 1972, Rembrandt's overseas tobacco interests were consolidated into Rothmans International. In 1988, the Rembrandt group founded the Swiss luxury goods company, Richemont, which in turn acquired Rembrandt's shares in Rothmans. Richemont also owns such luxury brands as Cartier (jewellery); Alfred Dunhill and Sulka (designer clothing); Seeger (leather bags); Piaget, Baume & Mercier and Vacheron Constantin (Swiss watches) and Montblanc (pens). In 1995 Rembrandt and Richemont consolidated their respective tobacco interests into Rothmans International, which was at the time the world's fourth largest cigarette manufacturer.

On 6 November 2004, Ivorians launched an air attack on French peacekeepers in the northern part of C√¥te d'Ivoire who were stationed there as part of Op√©ration Licorne (Unicorn), the French military operation in support of the United Nations Operation in C√¥te d'Ivoire (UNOCI). French military forces subsequently clashed with Ivorian troops and government-loyal mobs, destroying the entire Ivorian Air Force. Those incidents were followed by massive anti- French protests in C√¥te d'Ivoire. Background In 2002, a civil war broke out in C√¥te d'Ivoire between Ivorian military and other forces loyal to Laurent Gbagbo, the Ivorian president since 2000, and rebel forces identified with the Forces Nouvelles de C√¥te d'Ivoire. Although most of the fighting ended by late 2004, the country remained split in two, with a rebel-held north and a government-held south. Ivorian attack on French forces On 4 November 2004, Gbagbo ordered the counter-offensive to the rebel town of Bouak√© to be backed by air strikes. France does not react but on 5 November put three Dassault Mirage F.1 jet fighters based in nearby Gabon on standby. On 6 November, two Ivorian Sukhoi Su-25 bombers, crewed by two Belarusian mercenaries and two Ivorian pilots, fired on the Ivorian rebels led by Issiaka Ouattara. One of the bombers attacked the French peacekeeping position in the town at 1 pm, killing nine French soldiers and wounding 31.\\"Ivory Coast seethes after attack\\", BBC News, 7 November 2004. An American development worker, reported to have been a missionary, was also killed. The Ivorian government claimed the attack on the French was unintentional, but the French insisted that the attack had been deliberate.Ann Talbot, \\"Ivory Coast: protests erupt vs. French military strikes\\", World Socialist Web Site, 9 November 2004. Retaliation by the French and subsequent riots President Jacques Chirac ordered the destruction of the two Ivorian jets. At 2:20 pm, the Su-25s landed back to Abidjan airport and are destroyed by MILAN missiles fired by soldiers of the 2nd Marine Infantry Regiment, garrisoned at the airport. They are then attacked by the an Ivorian Mil Mi-24 helicopter gunship but repelled it with machine gun fire. At 3 pm, armed mobs of Ivorians loyal to the government took to the streets of Abidjan to protest against France and began to mass near the airport and near the base. At Abidjan's airport, French and Ivorian troops exchanged fire, and a French Transall C-160 military transport plane was damaged by RPGs at 4 pm. The remaining aircraft of the Ivorian air force (two other Su-25s, two Mi-24s and one BAC Strikemaster) are destroyed, on direct orders from general , before Ivorian protesters enter into the terminal. Meanwhile, two Mi-24s and one Mil Mi-8 are \\"annihilated\\" in Yamoussoukro presidential palace. On 7 November, thousands of Ivorian loyalists attacked a French school and army base. Crowds of young Ivorians attacked a residential district made up of French citizens, which had to be evacuated by airlift as mobs burst into their apartment buildings. Armored cars carried armed protesters to join the fight, and French helicopters flew over Abidjan and dropped concussion grenades, while French armored vehicles carried troops to put down the riots. Protesters erected burning roadblocks, and French gunboats were positioned beneath the bridges. Fighting continued, and, by Sunday, French forces were still not in control of the city. As the riots in the streets continued, French soldiers opened fire on Ivorian rioters; the French government stated that 20 were killed while Ivorian authorities placed the death toll at 60. At Du√©kou√© and in the northern suburbs of Abidjan, French reinforcements and Ivorian troops exchanged fire, Ivorian soldiers and civilians being killed. French forces evacuated nearly 5,000 foreign nationals from Ivory Coast in the first half of November. The United Nations Security Council unanimously passed an arms embargo on the country on 15 November 2004. French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier stated President Gbagbo was \\"personally responsible for what has happened\\", and declared that the violence was \\"unexplainable, unjustifiable\\". Ivorian National Assembly President Mamadou Koulibaly told state television: \\"Ivory Coast has become an overseas territory in Jacques Chirac‚Äôs head\\". Aftermath France reportedly let the two foreign pilots leave the country, in a group fifteen Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian mercenaries. Questions subsequently raised about a possible French manipulation and a judiciary inquiry is still ongoing in France. C√¥te d'Ivoire had begun rebuilding its air force with help from Belarus and Ukraine a year after the French attack. A 2014 publication shows that two Sukhoi Su-25s were almost repaired at Abidjan Airport but not put back into service. This was due to an arms embargo, which left all four aircraft in storage, along with two Mil Mi-24 helicopters. The assorted equipment of the aircraft were discovered at the former residence of F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny by Alassane Ouattara in April 2011, at the end of the post-electoral conflict which saw Gbagbo ousted. French judge issued an international arrest warrant for the two pilots suspected of the bombing, Patrice Ouei and Ange-Magloire Gnanduillet, in January 2006. An Ivorian military court was also seeking to find former defence minister Rene Amani and the former head of the loyalist army, , over the bombing.International Press Clips UNMIL By 2008, relations between C√¥te d'Ivoire and France had returned to normal, with French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner being the first French foreign minister to visit since 2004.

He presided over the most prosperous and peaceful period in the history of the Kingdom of Kakheti.  Biography  He was the son of George II of Kakheti by his wife Helene n√©e Irubakidze-Cholokashvili. George II led a series of unsuccessful raids into his western neighbor, kingdom of Kartli, ruled by a rival branch of the Bagrationi. In 1513, he was captured and put in prison, while his kingdom was taken over by David X of Kartli. Levan was taken by loyal nobles to the mountains and kept there clandestinely until 1518, when they capitalized on the invasion of Kartli by Ismail I, the Safavid Shah of Iran, and proclaimed Levan king of Kakheti. David X led his army against Kakheti, but failed to seize Levan and withdrew. In 1520, the two kings made peace and forged an alliance. Having secured the crown, Levan forced the highlanders of eastern Georgia into submission and established friendly relations with the Shamkhal of Tarki in Dagestan. In 1521, he mounted an expedition against Hassan-Bey, the ruler of Shaki in Shirvan, took the city and had Hassan executed. Shaki was under the patronage of Iran, and when Ismail I marched against Kakheti, Levan‚Äôs courage began to fail. He officially accepted the shah‚Äôs suzerainty and agreed to pay tribute. He reaffirmed his loyalty to the new shah, Tahmasp I, in 1541, and even helped him subdue rebellious Shaki in 1551. In the 1555 Treaty of Amasya, Ottoman and Saffavid empires divided the South Caucasus in their spheres of influence, with Kakheti falling into the Iranian orbit. Pressured by the presence of an Iranian army near the Kakhetian borders, Levan had to send his son Vakhtang (also known as Jesse) as a political hostage to the Saffavid court where the prince was converted to Islam, named Isa-Khan and appointed a governor of Shaki.Later, Jesse returned to Christianity and attempted to escape to his homeland, but was arrested and put in the Alamut prison. He died in 1580. In 1561, he was forced to deny aid to his son-in-law Simon I of Kartli against the Iranians. He allowed, however, his beloved son George to volunteer on the side of Simon, but the Georgian army was crushed at the battle of Tsikhedidi and George himself died on the battlefield. The Gremi castle commissioned by Levan. Levan of Kakheti. Mural from Gremi. Levan, then, attempted to counterbalance the Iranian hegemony by enlisting the Russian support and sent, in 1561, an embassy to Ivan IV. Levan‚Äôs Russian contacts enabled him to recruit a detachment of the Russian soldiers from the Terek Valley in 1564. The presence of the Russian contingent in Kakheti drew a protest from Iran, and Levan was forced to disband it in 1571. In general, Kakheti remained a peaceful country during Levan‚Äôs reign. Flanked by the Gilan-Shemakha-Astrakhan \\"silk route\\", the kingdom was actively involved in the regional trade. In contrast to other parts of Georgia, the towns and countryside prospered and attracted people from the harassed lands of Kartli as well as Armenian and Persian merchants and craftsmen.Suny, Ronald Grigor (1994), The Making of the Georgian Nation: 2nd edition, p. 46. Indiana University Press, Levan was known as a significant royal patron of culture, and his portraits survive in many of the churches he endowed, including Gremi. Levan died in 1574, being survived by five sons among whom a violent dispute over succession soon broke out. According to the 18th-century Georgian historian Prince Vakhushti, the animosity between the brothers was at least partially precipitated by Levan‚Äôs preferential treatment of his son by the second marriage over those by the first marriage, particularly Alexander, who was his eldest son, and, hence, a legitimate heir to the throne. Alexander, indeed, emerged victorious and became the next king of Kakheti. –í–∞—Ö—É—à—Ç–∏ –ë–∞–≥—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–æ–Ω–∏ (Vakhushti Bagrationi) (1745). –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è —Ü–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –≥—Ä—É–∑–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ. –í–æ–∑–Ω–∏–∫–Ω–æ–≤–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏ –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å –ö–∞—Ö–µ—Ç–∏ –∏ –≠—Ä–µ—Ç–∏. –ß.1 .

Her work is hybrid in nature, sometimes called lyric-Language poetry emerging from a strong background in the poetic and visual art traditions of both the US and France and adding to them her own vision. In the US, Cole Swensen's ninth collection of poetry, Goest (Alice James Books, 2004) was a finalist for the National Book Award.http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2004_cswensen.htm Earlier works have been awarded a National Poetry Series selection, Sun & Moon's New American Writing Award, the Iowa Poetry Prize via University of Iowa Press, the San Francisco State Poetry Center Book Award, and two Pushcart Prizes.

FC K√∂ln A terrace or terracing in sporting terms refers to the standing area of a sports stadium, particularly in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. It is a series of concrete steps, with intermittent safety barriers installed at specific locations to prevent an excessive movement of people down its slope. Terraces carry particular importance in football stadiums, where they have tended to be located in the areas behind the two goals as a cheaper alternative to sitting in the stands which were traditionally located at the sides of the field. As standing on the terraces was cheaper and provided a greater degree of freedom to move and congregate with fellow supporters, over the decades of the 20th century they became the most popular areas for younger working class men and teenage boys to watch the games. After the Hillsborough disaster and subsequent Taylor report, terraces were banned from football grounds in the top two divisions in England. The report stated that standing areas were not intrinsically unsafe and laid the majority of the blame for the disaster with the police and the stadium itself. Despite that finding, the report made a number of recommendations for the future of football in England including a conversion to all-seater venues which provided a basis for the government ban on terracing. In the 1990s, UEFA banned standing areas for games in its competitions which led to the removal of terraces from many stadiums around Europe, including the Bernab√©u and the Stadium of Light. There is currently a growing demand for the introduction of a hybrid model of terracing/seating to the top divisions of English football, based on several different stadium designs in Germany and other European countries, dubbed \\"safe standing\\" areas. Genuine terraces continue to be built in modern Irish stadiums such as Hill 16 in Croke Park, Thomond Park and the redeveloped P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh.  Germany  The Stadion Rote Erde, home of Borussia Dortmund from 1937 to 1974. The Westfalenstadion situated beside it features the largest terrace in Europe. Terracing was common in German football stadiums through most of the 20th century and, in contrast to other major football nations in Europe, has remained so into the 21st century. Despite UEFA's ban on standing areas for European matches, the clubs in Germany refused to permanently remove the terraces from their grounds and maintained their presence in domestic football.  Ireland  Hill 16 in Croke Park, a modern terrace built in 2004 to replace the old terrace and Nally Stand In Ireland, terraces remain a common feature in stadiums hosting Gaelic games, rugby union, association football and other sports. GAA stadiums that feature terracing include Fitzgerald Stadium in Killarney, Pearse Stadium in Galway and P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh in Cork. Hill 16 in Croke Park is the biggest terrace in Ireland. Terracing has been common in rugby stadiums for decades and continues to be included in modern redevelopments of major grounds like Thomond Park and Ravenhill Stadium. League of Ireland grounds have historically been dominated by terracing, with major stadiums like Dalymount Park and Glenmalure Park featuring at least three sides of terracing for much of their existence. The redevelopment of Tolka Park in the early 1990s reflected the wider move away from terracing to seating in European football stadiums, though terraces were retained in many grounds that underwent a degree of redevelopment.  United Kingdom  = History = In the early days of the twentieth century the terraces were simply earth banks, often built up with the rubble of construction sites. Rows of railways sleepers were laid on top to provide something solid for spectators to stand on. Most stadiums in Britain at the turn of the century had stands for spectators, but when a wooden stand at Ibrox Park collapsed in the 1902 Ibrox disaster killing many spectators during a Scotland versus England game there was an instant ban on framework supported terraces, which the government ordered must be replaced by solid earthwork supported terracing. The earth and sleeper terraces would gradually make way for concrete terraces with metal crush barriers being erected at various points to prevent crushing. An excellent example of one such old style terrace can be found at Cathkin Park in Glasgow, an abandoned football stadium, which was home to Third Lanark. = Popularity = The terraces were hugely popular in England, particularly from the 1920s to the 1980s, and their working class links led them to be given affectionate names by the fans who stood on them. By far the most common name was Spion Kop, named after the Battle of Spion Kop in the Boer War in South Africa in 1902 between Britain and the Boers. Arsenal F.C. were the first to adopt such a name but by far the most famous was the Kop at Liverpool F.C.'s Anfield Road ground. The vast majority of clubs in England and farther afield would go on to regard their most popular end of their stadium as a Kop, even if, in most cases the end had another name, for example the Holte End at Aston Villa F.C.'s Villa Park. The most notable exception to this is Everton F.C., whose close rivalry with city neighbours Liverpool has meant that neither the club nor its fans would ever refer to the ground as having a Kop section. The advantage of terracing over seating for clubs was obvious, as many more fans could be packed in tightly into very cramped areas, and it is no coincidence that many clubs' all-time attendance records were set in the 1930s and 1940s. = Safety = Molineux Terraces were generally a safe, cheap and enjoyable way to watch sport, but on occasion they could be dangerous too. In the early days the wet railway sleepers would often lead to falls, which quickly led to their replacement but much worse was to follow when thirty-three people lost their lives in 1946 when an overcrowded terrace led to a crush at Bolton Wanderers F.C.'s Burnden Park ground. That such a disaster only occurred once during this era is amazing as it was common in those days to see a fainted fan being passed down the terraces over the heads of those packed in so they could be treated for their ill effects. But there were perhaps more advantages than disadvantages still. The ground fee was low and achievable for all, the singing and cheering was not rarely astonishing, especially where the huge covered Goal Stands existed. Like the Kop at Anfield Road, Holte End at Villa Park and South Bank Stand at Molineux Ground By the 1970s the lower cost of travel meant it was easier for fans to have away days, or road trips and a common practice among young visiting fans was to try to \\"take the terrace\\". Large bodies of supporters of the visiting team would infiltrate the popular terracing of the home supporters with the result that violence often erupted. This led to crowd segregation at football grounds and also played a small part in the erection of high fencing and segregated pens within most terraces in England. These pens became a contributing factor in the Hillsborough disaster, England's worst ever stadium disaster, when too many fans entered the central pens at the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield. 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death against the perimeter fence in the resultant crush. Although claiming that terraces were not \\"intrinsically unsafe\\", the final Taylor Report into the disaster led to a recommendation that terraces be done away with at major British stadiums. Today every major British football ground is all-seater, though terracing is still found at grounds in the lower leagues. Britain's biggest remaining terraced ground is Brunton Park in Carlisle, which still has three sides of terracing. = Crowd disorder = The Warwick Road End, a covered terrace at Brunton Park, home of Carlisle United F.C. It has been argued that terraces encourage crowd disorder. However, analysis of statistics on football related arrests and banning orders published by the UK Home Office show that in both the 2008/9 and 2009/10 seasons the rate of arrest per 100,000 supporters was higher at Football League One and Football League Two clubs with all-seated grounds than at those with terraces.50 Stand Up Sit Down ‚Äì A Choice to Watch Football. Peter Caton 2012. . Chapter 20 Overall arrest rates for football related offences have fallen steadily from 34 per 100,000 in 1988/89 to 9 per 100,000 in 2009/10, however the trend of reducing arrests started before stadia were required to become all-seated and has continued since. = Safe standing = In 2011 the Scottish Premier League announced that their clubs would be given permission to introduce safe standing areas at their grounds. In 2012, Derby County became the first club from the Championship to support the introduction of safe standing areas, although the only terraced standing areas in the Championship and/or Barclays Premiership at that time could be found at London Road, home to Peterborough United. Peterborough United became the second Championship club to back the safe standing campaign through their CEO Bob Symns. Symns also signed the safe standing petition. Indeed, the club's mascot ‚Äì Peter Burrow ‚Äì took part in a video campaign promoting safe standing, with the video being shot at the AWD- Arena, home to Hannover 96 in Germany  United States  Terracing was introduced to American football with the inclusion of party decks with the ability to hold 35,000 people at Cowboys Stadium in the Dallas suburb of Arlington, Texas. Capacity for Dallas Cowboys games and other American football events is 80,000 seated, expandable to 111,000 with standing areas.http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/stories/080109dnspocowside.1f521fe.html However, these decks are flat, rather than steeply pitched, and are more analogous to standing-room only ticketing where obstruction is expected. The key difference is that unlike at European grounds, party decks are not considered or marketed as areas from which all spectators are afforded a view of the match at all times. Many seats in FedExField, home of the Washington Redskins, have been removed in favour of terraced party decks. These terraced, standing-room-only sections are similar to safe standing sections in European stadiums, though they are not marketed as such. Since the 2010s, several Major League Soccer stadiums have opened with or renovated for safe standing. The San Jose Earthquakes opened a Supporters Terrace at Earthquakes Stadium in 2014 with a capacity of 600 people, and was followed by a large-scale safe standing section at Orlando's Exploria Stadium, which opened in 2017. Since then, Banc of California Stadium (LAFC), Allianz Field (Minnesota United FC), and Audi Field (DC United) have opened with safe standing; two existing stadiums, Red Bull Arena (New Jersey) (New York Red Bulls) and Dignity Health Sports Park (LA Galaxy), were also remodeled to support safe standing.

Haleem is a stew composed of meat, lentils and pounded wheat made into a thick paste. It is originally an Arabic dish and was introduced to the Hyderabad State by the Chaush people during the rule of the Nizams (the former rulers of Hyderabad State). Local traditional spices helped a unique Hyderabadi haleem evolve, which became popular among the native Hyderabadis by the 19th century. The preparation of haleem has been compared to that of Hyderabadi biryani. Though Hyderabadi haleem is the traditional hors d'oeuvre at weddings, celebrations and other social occasions, it is particularly consumed in the Islamic month of Ramadan during Iftar (the evening meal that breaks the day-long fast) as it provides instant energy and is high in calories. This has made the dish synonymous with Ramadan. In recognition of its cultural significance and popularity, in 2010 it was granted Geographical Indication status (GIS) by the Indian GIS registry office, making it the first non-vegetarian dish in India to receive this status. History Haleem originated as an Arabic dish with meat and pounded wheat as the chief ingredients. It was introduced to Hyderabad by the Arab diaspora during the rule of the sixth Nizam, Mahbub Ali Khan, and later became an integral part of Hyderabadi cuisine during the rule of the seventh Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan. Sultan Saif Nawaz Jung Bahadur, an Arab chief from Mukalla, Hadhramaut, Yemen, who was among the seventh Nizam's court nobility, popularised it in Hyderabad. Addition of local flavours to the original recipe resulted in a taste distinct from other types of haleem.  Officially introduced in Hyderabad  Hyderabadi haleem was officially introduced in Madina Hotel by Aga Hussain Zabeth, the Iranian founder of the hotel in 1956. The hotel which opened in 1947 in the Waqf property named Madina Building at Pathargatti which the rent from it was used to serve Haj pilgrims, Madina hotel is one of the oldest restaurant in the Hyderabad. After renovation of Madina hotel it was inaugurated by the last Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan in 1956. Preparation Mixed wheat, dal and other grains Traditionally, Hyderabadi haleem is cooked on a low flame of firewood for up to 12 hours in a bhatti (a cauldron covered with a brick and mud kiln). One or two people are required to stir it continuously with wooden paddles throughout its preparation. For home-made Hyderabadi haleem, a Ghotni (a wooden hand masher) is used to stir it until it reaches a sticky-smooth consistency, similar to minced meat. =Ingredients= Spices used in preparing Hyderabadi Haleem The ingredients include meat (either goat meat, beef or chicken); pounded wheat; ghee‚Äî(milk fat rendered from butter, also called clarified butter); milk; lentils; ginger and garlic paste; turmeric; red chili pepper spices such as cumin seeds, caraway seeds (shah zeera), cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, black pepper, saffron, jaggery, natural gum, allspice (kabab cheeni); and dry fruits such as pistachio, cashew, fig and almond. It is served hot topped with a ghee-based gravy, pieces of lime, chopped coriander, sliced boiled egg and fried onions as garnish. =Variations= Different variants have been introduced catering to regional taste and requirements. A meethi (sweet) variant of haleem is consumed as breakfast by the Arab diaspora in Barkas neighbourhood of the city. The chicken variant is less popular, even though it is lower priced. A vegetarian version of haleem, in which dry fruits and vegetables are substituted for goat meat, is available at some eateries in Hyderabad. Nutrition Hyderabadi haleem is a high calorie dish which gives instant energy as it contains slow-digesting and fast-burning ingredients. It also contains dry fruits rich in anti-oxidants. The meat and dry fruits make it a high protein food. A new low-cholesterol variety by using emu meat, rich in minerals, phosphorus and vitamins, was introduced in 2013. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), a local civic body that monitors health and safety regulations in the city, has set up hygiene and quality standards to be followed by the eateries selling it. Popularity Ghotni a wooden hand masher, used to muddle meat and wheat while cooking haleem until it becomes a thick paste. Hyderabadi haleem is regarded as an international delicacy. In Hyderabad, the dish is often consumed at celebratory events such as weddings. It is consumed especially during Iftaar, the evening meal following the day-long fast, observed by Muslims during the month of Ramadan. = Places to try Haleem = Shah Ghouse Caf√©, Cafe 555, Pista House, Grill 9, Parivar, Bahar Cafe, Chicha's, Peshawar, Grand Hotel, Prince and Bahar Cafe are some of the places to try Haleem in Hyderabadhttps://telanganatoday.com/the-best-haleem-joints-of-hyderabad In Hyderabad and neighbouring areas, the month of Ramadan is synonymous with Hyderabadi haleem. During the 2014 Ramadan season, 5 billion worth of Hyderabadi haleem was sold in the city, and an additional 25,000 people were employed in the preparation and sale of haleem. The connoisseur chefs are paid salaries of up to a month plus benefits, As of 2011, during Ramadan there were 6,000 eateries throughout the city that sold haleem (70% of which are temporary until Ramadan ends), and 28% of Hyderabadi haleem produced in the city was exported to 50 countries throughout the world. Sanjeev Kapoor, an entrepreneur of Indian cuisine, mentions in his book Royal Hyderabadi Cooking that the preparation of haleem in Hyderabad has become an art form, much like the Hyderabadi biryani. In 2010 Hyderabadi haleem was awarded Geographical Indication status by the Indian GI registry office. It became the first meat product of India to receive a GI certification. This means that a dish cannot be sold as Hyderabadi haleem unless it meets the necessary standards laid down for it. * See also * List of stews References Further reading  External links *Videos about cooking Hyderabdi haleem *An article published by state Tourism department Category:Hyderabadi cuisine Category:Muhajir cuisine Category:Mughlai cuisine Category:Geographical indications in Telangana ","title":"Hyderabadi haleem"},{"id":"13582573","text":"George Klein (Georg Klein; born Klein Gy√∂rgy, 28 July 1925 ‚Äì 10 December 2016) was a Hungarian‚ÄìSwedish microbiologist and public intellectual.Ernberg, Ingemar; K√§rre, Klas; Wigzell, Hans (16 February 2017). \\"George Klein (1925‚Äì2016)\\".

Specializing in cancer research, he was professor of tumour biology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm from 1957‚Äì1992, a chair created for him, and as professor emeritus continued to work as research group leader in the microbiology and tumor biology center. According to Nature, the department Klein founded was \\"international and influential\\". In the 1960s he and his wife, Eva Klein, \\"laid the foundation for modern tumour immunology\\". In addition to having over 1,385 papers published on cancer and experimental cell research, Klein authored over 13 books in Swedish on a wide range of topics, including essays on the Holocaust in Hungary. In 1944 he escaped from being loaded onto a train in Budapest during the deportation of Jews to the Auschwitz concentration camp.Ekselius, Eva (2008). \\"Bonds with a Vanished Past: Contemporary Jewish Writing in Scandinavia\\", in Liska, Vivian and Nolden, Thomas (eds.). Contemporary Jewish Writing in Europe: A Guide. Indiana University Press, p. 67. Three of Klein's books have been translated into English: The Atheist and the Holy City (1990); Piet√† (1992), a collection of essays on whether life is worth living; and Live Now (1997). He received numerous awards for his scientific work, including the Leopold Griffuel Prize in 1974, the Harvey Prize in 1975, and the Alfred P. Sloan Jr. Prize in 1979. In 1990 the Swedish Academy awarded him the Dobloug Prize for his contribution to literature. Early life Klein was born Klein Gy√∂rgy to a Jewish family in the Carpathian Mountains of the Hungarian- speaking part of what is now Eastern Slovakia. When he was five, the family moved to Budapest, Hungary, where he attended the Berzsenyi Gymnasium.Marx, George (2001). The Voice of the Martians: Hungarian Scientists Who Shaped the 20th Century in the West. Akad√©miai Kiad√≥, p. 71: \\"Georg Klein, recipient of the Letterstedt Prize in Stockholm, was born in the Carpathian Mountains in 1925, but moved to Budapest at the age of 5. He attended the Berzsenyi Gymnasium.\\" Holocaust in Hungary Klein wrote in Piet√† and elsewhere about his experiences during the Holocaust as a teenager in Budapest, after the German invasion of Hungary in March 1944. Between May and July 1944, 437,000 Hungarian Jews were deported by cattle train to the Auschwitz concentration camp, to be \\"resettled\\", according to the Germans. Most were, in fact, sent to the gas chambers. In May or June 1944, Klein was working as a junior secretary for the Jewish Council in Sip Street, Budapest, when he was shown a copy of the Vrba-Wetzler report by his boss, Dr. Zolt√°n Kohn. The report was an eyewitness account of what was happening in Auschwitz, including details about the gas chambers. The authors, Rudolf Vrba and Alfr√©d Wetzler, had escaped from the camp in April that year. They warned that most of the deportees arriving at the camp were being killed, not resettled. Klein tried to warn his family and friends, but no one would listen. When the time came for him to board one of the trains, he ran instead, and ended up hiding in a cellar until January 1945.Klein, George (2011). \\"Confronting the Holocaust: An Eyewitness Account\\", in Randolph L. Braham and William vanden Heuvel. The Auschwitz Reports and the Holocaust in Hungary. Columbia University Press. Decades later, he looked for Vrba, then a professor of pharmacology in Canada, to thank him, and subsequently wrote about him and his report in two essays: \\"The Ultimate Fear of the Traveler Returning from Hell\\" in Piet√† (first published in Sweden in 1989), and \\"Confronting the Holocaust: An Eyewitness Account\\" (2011) in The Auschwitz Reports and the Holocaust in Hungary, edited by Randolph L. Braham and William vanden Heuvel. Move to Sweden =Karolinska Institute= Eva and George Klein in 1979 When the war ended, Klein and a friend traveled to Szeged, a town 300 km from Budapest, to find out whether its university was still functioning. Budapest's university, then known as the P√°zm√°ny P√©ter University, was deserted. They walked part of the way and hitched rides, arriving in Szeged on 4 February 1945. The University of Szeged was still functioning, and Klein was admitted as a student. He studied medicine there for three months before continuing his studies in Budapest. Klein worked as an instructor in histology and pathology from 1945 to 1947 at the P√°zm√°ny P√©ter University; it was while working there, in July 1947, that he met his future wife, Eva Fischer. Shortly after meeting her, he and a group of students were invited by a Jewish student club in Sweden to visit Stockholm and Gothenburg, where Klein was introduced to the Karolinska Institute. After talking to Torbj√∂rn Caspersson, he was offered a job there as a research assistant.Stenberg, Peter (2004). Contemporary Jewish Writing In Sweden: An Anthology. University of Nebraska Press, p. 137. He returned to Budapest in September 1947 and married Eva, who joined him in Stockholm in March 1948, shortly before the Hungarian People's Republic came into existence. Klein completed his M.D. at the Karolinska Institute in 1951 and held the position of assistant professor of cell research from 1951 to 1957. Eva Klein completed her M.D., also at the Karolinska Institute, in 1955. In 1957 Klein was promoted to professor of tumor biology, a chair created for him, and he and his wife created the Department of Tumour Biology, with a donation from a Swedish charity, Riksf√∂reningen mot cancer.\\"Professor Emeritus Georg Klein passed away\\", Karolinska Institute, 12 December 2016. Klein led the department until 1993, after which he was its research group leader. =Cancer research= In 1960 the Kleins published an important paper in Cancer Research, \\"Demonstration of Resistance against Methylcholanthrene-induced Sarcomas in the Primary Autochthonous Host\\".Klein, George; Sj√∂gren, Hans Olof; Klein, Eva and Hellstr√∂m, Karl Erik (December 1960). \\"Demonstration of Resistance against Methylcholanthrene-induced Sarcomas in the Primary Autochthonous Host\\".

(April 2017). \\"George Klein (1925‚Äì2016) A Prescient, Luminous Voice\\", Cancer Immunology Research. 5(4). According to Klein's obituary in Nature, researchers at the time believed that cancers carried \\"a common antigen that the immune system could recognize. The Kleins and their colleagues used a chemical carcinogen to induce tumours in mice, surgically removed these and immunized the animals with irradiated cells from their own tumours. Next, the group inoculated mice with viable cancer cells and demonstrated that the immune system would only reject cancerous cells if they came from the original tumour. This clarified the field: the immune system could recognize and reject cancers, in a way that was specific to each individual.\\" Klein later made a connection between the Epstein-Barr virus and lymphomas and other cancers.Rohl√©n-Wohlgemuth, Hilde (1995).

The episode was written by Michael Schur, who also acts in the show, and directed by Craig Zisk. It first aired in the United States on October 4, 2007 on NBC. In this episode, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) returns to his old office and reveals his plan to bring technology to Dunder Mifflin. Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) try to prove that the personal touch is better than technology. Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) reveal their relationship to the rest of the office, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) attempts to reunite with Ryan, and Dwight and Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) relationship continues to plummet.  Plot  Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) returns to the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of Dunder Mifflin for the first time since his promotion to the corporate headquarters. Although he sports a much more urbane look and attitude, he garners little respect from his former peers. Ryan introduces \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity,\\" his initiative to revitalize the company with new technology. Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is initially excited about the prospect of getting a BlackBerry, but is warned by Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) that the program is a ploy to get rid of older workers. Creed dyes his hair black with printer ink in an attempt to convince everyone that he is much younger. Michael holds a conference room meeting on the subject of ageism. To show that personal interaction is more effective than new technology, Michael and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) decide to go out and win back the clients they lost in the past year with gift baskets. Each manager they encounter refuses to consider returning to Dunder Mifflin unless the company improves its technology, such as Dunder Mifflin's website. While driving back to the office, Michael misinterprets his rental car's GPS map system's directions and drives into Lake Scranton. He takes this as further proof that new technology is useless because it tried to kill him. After the lake incident, he and Dwight walk back to one of the former clients to awkwardly get back their gift basket, causing a scene. Meanwhile, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) are exposed as a couple when Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) circulates a memo about public displays of affection. Jim secretly informs Pam that Dwight and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) are dating, only to discover that she already knew. Meanwhile, Dwight attempts to make amends for the death of Angela's cat Sprinkles by giving her a stray cat he found in his barn, named Garbage. Angela rejects the gift. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) tries to restart her relationship with Ryan, an effort he ignores until she tells him she is pregnant. After going out to dinner, Ryan learns that Kelly's pregnancy claim was a lie that Kelly used in attempt to get them back together. Back at the office, Ryan asks Pam to create a logo for Dunder Mifflin Infinity. Pam is excited about the opportunity to use her art background, but Ryan uses the logo as an excuse to ask her out, which he does in front of Jim. Pam responds that she is dating Jim, which leaves the new boss thoroughly embarrassed.  Production  The episode was the first episode of the series directed by Craig Zisk. Zisk had previously directed episodes of Nip/Tuck, Weeds, Scrubs, Smallville, and The Single Guy. \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\" was written by Michael Schur, who plays Dwight's Amish cousin Mose. For Ryan's new appearance this season, the writers originally had B. J. Novak grow a goatee. Show runner and executive producer Greg Daniels decided to have Novak lose the goatee, because according to Novak \\"a goatee would make Ryan a flat-out chump. And we wanted it to be more subtle.\\" In addition to his five o'clock shadow, Ryan was also seen wearing black clothes. Novak explained that \\"We wanted him to dress as obnoxious as possible. As much black as possible.\\" \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\" went along with a website that had been created with the same name. The website was part of a game in which fans of The Office would sign up, and become \\"employees\\" of different \\"branches\\". Members of the site would perform tasks such as design a logo for the company or make Creed look young again.  Reception  \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\" received 4.5/11 in the ages 18‚Äì49 demographic in the Nielsen ratings. This means that 4.5 percent of all households with an 18- to 49-year- old living in it watched the episode, and eleven percent had their televisions tuned to the channel at any point. The episode was watched by 8.49 million viewers. \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\" received mixed reviews from critics, with Michael driving his car into the lake being particularly panned by critics and viewers. Entertainment Weekly's Christine Fenno commented that she thought \\"Michael seemed a bit more focused than usual, even competent at moments. And then he drove into a lake.\\" Jack Rodgers, from TV Guide said that his \\"favorite thing about this episode was the sly parallel that connects the three love stories\\" and \\"Michael‚Äôs obsession with sticking to his old methods rather than learning to change and embrace technology\\". Will Leitch of New York criticized the episode, saying that Michael driving into the lake felt more like the actions of a \\"cartoon character\\", than \\"based in reality\\". Leitch did say that if \\"we can get Michael out of that lake and back in a conference room with Ryan, we'll have something.\\"  References   External links  * \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\" at NBC.com  Category:The Office (American season 4) episodes Category:2007 American television episodes Category:The Office (American TV series) episodes in multiple parts ","title":"Dunder Mifflin Infinity"},{"id":"13582657","text":"Joseph Doyle was the brother-in-law of Charlie Byrne and part of the original ownership team of what became the Brooklyn Dodgers.

The film was commercially released in France on 31 October 2007. Synopsis In the near future Paris, lieutenant David Hoffman from the European Police is chasing down Bulgarian human trafficker Dimitri Nicolov, along with his police partner and wife, Sarah. During the ensuing shoot-out, Sarah is killed by Nicolov and David is injured. Some time later, David is brought back to active service and given a new partner, Marie, the niece of a high-ranking Intelligence officer. They investigate the body of an illegal immigrant, Tatiana, found with strange marks under her eye from what looks like an eyelid retractor, and her brain cooked by electrical shocks. In the meantime, a young woman named Manon, who's been involved in a car accident, is being nursed to health at the hi-tech clinic directed by her mother, Professor Br√ºgen. Manon seems to have issues recovering her memories after the incident. She has also the same marks under her eye. David and Marie manage to link the dead girl to Nicolov, and one of David's informants tell them where to find him, and that Tatiana had a sister named Elena. A stakeout leads to Nicolov's capture, but once at the precinct the criminal attempts to escape and David is forced to kill him to save Marie's life. However, unbeknown to David, the autopsy reveals that the man was not Nicolov at all, but his twin brother. Later at David's apartment, the real Nicolov shows up and kidnaps him. Nicolov brings David to Br√ºgen, who's revealed to be his accomplice. The machine she's using to help Manon recover her memories is a secret military prototype stolen by Nicolov, a technique called \\"Chrysalis\\" that allows to digitize and extract a subject's memory, store it away, or erase it completely. Nicolov forces Br√ºgen to erase David's memory and then he abandons him on the street as a vengeance for the death of his brother. David's found three days later, with no recollection of any event from his past, including Sarah's death, which was haunting him. Marie is tasked by the chief of police Miller, and by her uncle, to babysit David and try to get his memory back by making him relive past traumas, a method that is known to counter the effects of the machine. This kind of traumatic memory is also what's preventing Manon from completing the process, to her mother's increasing chagrin. Marie disobeys the orders and chooses to bring David back to speed on the Nicolov case. The two of them end put the pieces together and follow the leads to Chrysalis and the clinic. When she sees David, Professor Br√ºgen is worried their operation will be exposed, and orders Nicolov to take care of him. However, in the ensuing confrontation, David ends up killing Nicolov for good. In the meantime, Manon has found out the real Manon's badly burned body; she never actually recovered from the car crash, and is kept alive only to allow for her memories to be harvested and transferred into Manon's brain. Shocked, she's going to take her own life by jumping from the top of the clinic's building, but David stops her. He tells her he also lost his memories and identity, but he knows who she is: her name is Elena, Tatiana's missing sister: the trauma she was reliving was of being kidnapped as a replacement for Manon, while the drawings she kept making on her notebook were a part of her past identity. The situation at the clinic escalates when one Intelligence agent shows up and kills both Br√ºgen and what was left of her daughter. Trying to clean up the mess, he attempts to dispatch David and Marie too, but he's overpowered. The two of them find out the agent, and by extension, the Intelligence, was in cahoots with Br√ºgen and Nicolov, who was former agent of the Bulgarian secret service. Marie delivers the file to her uncle, bitterly accepting the inevitable cover-up, but threatening to expose him if any harm should ever incur to her or David. Then she meets with David to say goodbye, as he chose not to restore the painful memories of his old life, and instead to go off the grid with Elena as his protector/father figure.

The purchase of bottle service typically includes a reserved table for the patron's party and mixers of the patron's choice. Bottle service can include the service of a VIP host, who will ensure that patrons have sufficient mixers and will often make drinks using the patrons' liquor bottle and mixers. The purchase of bottle service sometimes results in cover charge being waived for the purchaser's party and often allows patrons to bypass entrance lines. The gratuity is also often added automatically but portions of that go to security, porters, back of the house staff in addition to the VIP host who serves the patron. The cost of a bottle at such a lounge or club is usually significantly marked up, often by 1,000% or more, and can account for a significant portion of an establishment's revenue. History Early forms of bottle service existed in World War II era Japan, where unfinished bottles would be stored. In its modern form, an early example was in 1988 at the Paris nightclub Les Bains Douches, bottle service was introduced to deal with an excess of customer demand. An early, inexpensive form of bottle service ($90, compared with $6 drinks) was established at the Tunnel in New York City in 1993 (by Jeffrey Jah and Mark Baker). The modern form of bottle service was pioneered in 1995 by Michael Ault at Spy Bar and in 1996, Chaos ($175 for a bottle of Stolichnaya vodka), with the goal of creating a \\"barrier to entry\\", rather than of increasing liquor sales. The concept later spread to other American cities, notably Miami and Las Vegas in the early 2000s. Criticism The cost of bottle service and the central position provided to purchasers of bottle service has led some critics to complain that bottle service is turning night clubs into elitist dens. Preferential treatment for purchasers of bottle service may include stopping the regular dance music when an especially expensive bottle is purchased and, instead, playing a theme song, or removing patrons from a table to make way for another patron and their party that purchased bottle service.

Two of the guns may have been manufactured during World War I, as 'British 12\\"/40 (30.5 cm) Mark IX' states that 6 more Mk IX W guns were made during World War I. on various railway platforms to provide mobile long-range heavy artillery for the British Army on the Western Front in World War I. History Vickers mounted two Mk IX W guns on slightly different railway mountings, Mk I, from September 1915. They are both identified by the open-frame appearance, recoil buffers above the barrel and the bogies with frames between the wheels similar to locomotive bogies. One mounting has a distinctive diamond-shape from the side and has a warping winch on the front; the other's carriage has a more squared-off profile with no warping winch at the front. The weapons on the Mk I mountings were originally reserve guns for HMS Cornwallis.Hogg 1998, pp. 118-122 Elswick Ordnance Company (Armstrongs) mounted two more on its own design of Mk II railway mounting, delivered to the Western Front in August 1916. They are identified by the boxed-in frame appearance, recoil buffers below the barrel and the bogies with frames outside the wheels. Design The gun cars allowed only 1¬∞ left and right traverse, achieved by pivoting the entire gun car body about the forward bogies, in the two Vickers carriages, or about the rear bogies in the Armstrong carriages. Like most railway guns in the war it was operated on specially-constructed curved sections of track and moved forward or backward to point it at a new target. Fine adjustment could then be achieved by onboard traversing, which at the gun's maximum range covered an arc of about 1,000 yards.Miller 1921, page 154 The initial shock of firing was absorbed by a hydro-spring mechanism, allowing 34 inches of recoil within the gun mounting. The remaining recoil energy was absorbed by allowing the entire railway wagon to roll backwards 40 feetMiller 1292, page 149 (Vickers carriage) or 3-4 yardsMiller 1921, page 155 (Armstrong carriage) against locked brakes. This \\"rolling recoil\\" system allowed the gun to be operated without the need to construct a pit with a strong static platform below the gun for it to recoil into and to allow transmission of all the recoil force directly to the ground as was typical of many large US and French railway guns. Combat service Crew of railway gun on Vickers Mk I mounting, Woesten, 23 August 1917, Third Battle of Ypres At the end of World War I, the dispositions of the guns on the Western Front were: 1 gun of 92 Battery and 1 gun of 543 Battery with First Army i.e. Artois; 1 gun of 92 Battery with Third Army i.e. Somme; 1 gun of 543 Battery with Fourth Army i.e. Somme.Farndale 1986  See also  *List of railway artillery *BL 12 inch Mk IX naval gun =Weapons of comparable role, performance and era= * Canon de 305 mm Mod√®le 1893/96 gun French equivalent railway gun Notes and references Bibliography * Dale Clarke, British Artillery 1914-1919.

Invited after earlier unsuccessful expeditions against the Prussians by Christian Polish kings, the Teutonic Knights began campaigning against the Prussians, Lithuanians and Samogitians in 1230. By the end of the century, having quelled several Prussian uprisings, the Knights had established control over Prussia and administered the conquered Prussians through their monastic state, eventually erasing the Prussian language, culture and pre-Christian religion by a combination of physical and ideological force. Some Prussians took refuge in neighboring Lithuania. Early missions and conflicts Wulfstan of Hedeby, an agent of Alfred of Wessex, recorded the seafaring and cattle-herding Prussians as a strong and independent nation.Christiansen, p. 38 Mieszko I of the Polans tried to extend his realm from land he had just conquered around the mouth of the Oder as far as Prussia.Gieysztor, p. 50 Boleslaw I of Poland, son of Mieszko I, greatly expanded his land conquests and used Adalbert of Prague for his aim of conquering the Prussians in 997, but the missionary was killed by the natives. After some initial success among the Prussians, Adalbert's successor, Bruno of Querfurt, was also killed in 1009.Wyatt, pp. 22‚Äì23 Boleslaw I continued his conquests of surrounding lands and in 1015 he devastated the native populations of large parts of Prussia. The Poles waged war with the neighboring Prussians, Sudovians, and Wends over the following two centuries.Wyatt, p. 24Gieysztor, p. 77Recent Issues in Polish Historiography of the Crusades Darius von G√ºttner Sporzy≈Ñski. 2005 While the Poles sought control over the Prussians under the aegis of facilitating the conversion of the Prussians to Christianity, the Prussians engaged in reciprocal raids, capturing slaves in the bordering territories of Che≈Çmno Land and Masovia.Urban, p. 50 Many Prussians nominally accepted baptism under duress only to revert to native religious beliefs after hostilities ended. Henry of Sandomierz was killed fighting the Prussians in 1166.Gieysztor, p. 69 Boleslaw IV and Casimir II each led large armies into Prussia; while Boleslaw's forces were defeated in guerilla warfare, Casimir imposed peace until his death in 1194.Wyatt, p. 29 King Valdemar II of Denmark supported Danish expeditions against Samland until his capture by Henry I, Count of Schwerin, in 1223. In 1206, the Cistercian bishop Christian of Oliva, with the support of the King of Denmark and Polish dukes, found colonization of the natives in a better state than expected upon his arrival in the war-torn Che≈Çmno Land. Inspired, he travelled to Rome to prepare for a larger mission. When he returned to Che≈Çmno in 1215, however, Christian found the Prussians hostile out of outrage at the genocidal actions of the Sword-Brothers in LivoniaWyatt, p. 47 or fear of Christian Polish expansion.Urban, p. 51 The Prussians invaded Che≈Çmno Land, and Pomerellia,Gieysztor, p. 94 besieged Che≈Çmno and Lubawa, and enabled Christian converts to return to their native, pre-Christian beliefs.Wyatt, p. 32 Because of the growing intensity of reciprocal attacks,Gieysztor, p. 93 Pope Honorius III sent a papal bull to Christian in March 1217 allowing him to begin preaching a crusade against the resisting Prussians. The following year the Prussians counter-attacked Che≈Çmno Land and Masovia again, plundering 300 cathedrals and churches in revenge.Wyatt, p. 33 Duke Conrad of Masovia succeeded in making the Prussians leave by paying a huge tribute, which only encouraged the Prussians, however. Crusade of 1222/23 Map of the Prussian clans in the 13th century. Honorius III called for a crusade under the leadership of Christian of Oliva and chose as papal legate the Archbishop of Gniezno, Wincenty I Nia≈Çek. German and Polish crusaders began gathering in Masovia in 1219, but serious planning only began in 1222 upon the arrival of nobles such as Duke Henry of Silesia, Archbishop Laurentius of Wroc≈Çaw, and Laurentius of Lebus. Numerous Polish nobles began endowing Christian's Bishopric of Prussia with estates and castles in Che≈Çmno Land during the meantime. The lords agreed that the primary focus was to rebuild the colonizing fortresses of Che≈Çmno Land, especially Che≈Çmno itself, whose fortress was almost completely rebuilt.Wyatt, p. 34 By 1223, however, most of the crusaders had left the region, and the Prussians devastated Che≈Çmno Land and Masovia yet again, forcing Duke Conrad to seek refuge in the castle of P≈Çock. The Sarmatians (as they were then known) even reached Gda≈Ñsk (Danzig) in Pomerellia.Wyatt, p. 39 In 1225McClintock, p. 720 or 1228,Perlbach, p. 61 fourteen north German knights were recruited by Conrad and Christian to form a military order. First granted the estate of Cedlitz in Kuyavia until the completion of a castle at Dobrzy≈Ñ, the group became known as the Order of Dobrzy≈Ñ (or Dobrin).Wyatt, p. 36 The Knights of Dobrzy≈Ñ initially had success driving the Prussians from Che≈Çmno Land, but a Prussian counterattack against them and Conrad killed most of the Order. The survivors were granted asylum in Pomerania by Duke Swantopelk II. The Order of Calatrava, granted a base near Gda≈Ñsk, was also ineffective. Invitation of the Teutonic Knights Hermann von Salza, Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights. While in Rome, Christian of Oliva had made the acquaintance of Hermann von Salza, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights from 1209 to 1239. With the permission of Duke Conrad of Masovia and the Masovian nobility, Christian requested aid from the Teutonic Knights against the Prussians in 1226. Stability with the Prussians would then allow Conrad to pursue becoming High Duke of Poland.Christiansen, p. 82 While Hermann was interested in the Polish offer, his focus was on assisting Emperor Frederick II with the Fifth Crusade. Because the Teutonic Order had recently been expelled from the Burzenland in the Kingdom of Hungary, Hermann also desired greater autonomy for his forces in future endeavors. Hermann met with Frederick II at Rimini and suggested that the subjugation of the Prussians would make the Holy Roman Empire's borders easier to defend against invaders, presumably referring to Lithuanian counterattacks against Christian crusades.Wyatt, p. 81 The Holy Roman Emperor gave his approval of the enterprise in the Golden Bull of Rimini of 1226, granting them Che≈Çmno Land, or Culmerland, and any future conquests. The mission to convert the Prussians remained under the command of Bishop Christian of Oliva.Christiansen, p. 83 Before beginning the campaign against the Prussians, the Teutonic Knights allegedly signed the Treaty of Kruszwica with the Poles on June 16, 1230, by which the Order was to receive Culmerland and any future conquests, similar to the terms of the Golden Bull of Rimini. The agreement has been disputed by historians; the document has been lost and many Polish historians have doubted its authenticity and the Teutonic Order's territorial claims. However, recent studies by Polish historians have established the treaty's legitimacy.Dariusz Sikorski, 'Neue Erkenntnisse ueber das Kruschwitzer Privileg' in Zeitschrift f√ºr Ostmitteleuropa-Forschung, 51 (2002), p. 317-350 From the viewpoint of Duke Conrad, Che≈Çmno was only to be used as a temporary base against the Prussians and future conquests were to be under the authority of the Duke of Masovia. Hermann von Salza saw the document as granting the Order autonomy in all territorial acquisitions, aside from allegiance to the Holy See and the Holy Roman Emperor.Halecki, p. 35 The Golden Bull of Rieti issued by Pope Gregory IX in 1234 reaffirmed the Order's control of conquered lands, placing them only under the authority of the Holy See. The 14th century chronicler Peter von Dusburg mentioned eleven districts in Prussia: Bartia, Culmerland (formerly under Polish control), Galindia, Nadrovia, Natangia, Pogesania, Pomesania, Samland, Scalovia, Sudovia, and Ermland. Peter estimated that while most tribes could muster about 2,000 cavalry, Samland could raise 4,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry, while Sudovia had 6,000 cavalry and \\"an almost innumerable multitude of other warriors\\".Urban, p. 43 In contrast, the Prussians of ravaged Culmerland could raise fewer troops than the other tribes. Galindia, a forested wilderness of lakes and rivers, also had a small population to raise troops from. Modern estimates indicate a total Prussian population of 170,000, smaller than that suggested by Peter von Dusburg. Initial Teutonic campaigns After receiving or forging the claim to Culmerland in 1230,Due to a clerical mistake by Peter von Dusburg, the arrival of the Teutonic Knights has sometimes been given as 1226; see T√∂ppen, pp. 276‚Äì79. T√∂ppen states von Landsberg arrived in Masovia in 1230, while Fahne states von Landsberg arrived ca. 1228; see Fahne, p. 50 Hermann dispatched Conrad von LandsbergFahne, p. 50 as his envoyT√∂ppen, p. 276 with a small force of seven Teutonic Knights and 70‚Äì100 squires and sergeantsUrban, p. 52 to Masovia as a vanguard. They took possession of Vogelsang (German for \\"bird song\\"), a castle being built by Conrad opposite the future Thorn (Toru≈Ñ); other sources indicate that two knights constructed Vogelsang in 1229, but were killed by Prussians soon after.Seward, p. 101 This region south of the Vistula River was relatively safe with a mixed Christian and pagan population, and Conrad von Landsberg ordered a small raid against pagans across the Vistula. Led by Hermann Balk, reinforcements numbering twenty knights and 200 sergeants arrived at Vogelsang in 1230 after the castle's completion. Hermann von Salza could not spare any more, as the Order's primary bases of operation were in Outremer and Armenia. While the earlier Polish expeditions had usually marched eastward into the Prussian wilderness, the Order focused in the west to establish fortresses along the Vistula River. They campaigned annually whenever crusading knights from the west arrived. The early campaigns were primarily composed of Polish, German, and Pomeranian crusaders, as well as some Prussian militiamen auxiliaries. The Polish and Pomerellian dukes proved essential through their providing of troops and bases. Most of the secular crusaders would return to their homes after the end of the campaigns, leaving the monastic Teutonic Knights the task of consolidating the gains and garrisoning the newly built forts, most of which were small and made of timber.Christiansen, p. 106 Some secular Polish knights were granted vacant territories, especially in Culmerland, although most of the conquered territory was retained by the Teutonic Order. Colonists from the Holy Roman Empire began to immigrate eastward, allowing the foundation of a new town each year, many of which were granted Kulm law.Urban, p. 57 The crusaders began campaigning against the neighboring Pomesanians and their leader Pepin. Advancing from Nessau (Nieszawa) with the aid of Conrad of Masovia, Balk took control of ruins at modern Toru≈Ñ and advanced toward the pagan-occupied Rog√≥w. A local Prussian captain defected and handed that castle to the crusaders, who then destroyed the Prussian fort of Quercz or Gurske. The defecting captain then tricked Pipin into being captured by the Knights, ending Prussian resistance in the Culmerland.Wyatt, pp. 92‚Äì93 By 1232, the Knights had established or rebuilt fortresses at Culm (Che≈Çmno) and Thorn. Pope Gregory IX called for reinforcements, which included 5,000 veterans under the leadership of the Burgrave of Magdeburg.Wyatt, p. 95 In summer 1233, the Knights led a crusading army of 10,000Urban, p. 56 and established a fortress at Marienwerder (Kwidzyn) in Pomesania. The Pomerellian dukes Swantopelk and Sambor supported a smaller army for an invasion of Pogesania during the winter of 1233‚Äì34. After a close battle, the pagan Pogesanians were routed on the frozen Sirgune River by the arrival of the ducal cavalry, and the battlefield was subsequently known as the \\"Field of the Dead\\".Wyatt, p. 99 The building of a fortress at Rehden (Radzy≈Ñ Che≈Çmi≈Ñski) stabilized the eastern Culmerland in 1234.Christiansen, p. 105 The bishop of Prussia, Christian of Oliva, claimed two-thirds of conquered territory, granting one-third to the Teutonic Order. The papal legate William of Modena mediated between the two sides, granting the Knights two-thirds but reserving extra rights for the bishop. The Teutonic Knights also sought the incorporation of the small Order of Dobrzy≈Ñ into the larger Teutonic Order. Conrad of Masovia was furious with this proposal and demanded the return of the Dobrzy≈Ñ Land, which the Knights were reluctant to do; Duke Conrad subsequently refused to aid the crusaders any further.Wyatt, p. 101 With the approval of the pope and the bishop of P≈Çock, the Teutonic Knights assimilated the Order of Dobrzy≈Ñ in a bull on April 19, 1235; the displeased Conrad of Masovia had the castle of Dobrzy≈Ñ returned to him. In 1237 the Teutonic Knights assimilated the Sword-Brothers or Livonian Order, a military order active in Livonia, after they were nearly wiped out by Lithuanians in the Battle of Saule. With the support of Henry III, Margrave of Meissen, in 1236, the crusaders advanced north along both banks of the Vistula and forced the submission of most Pomesanians. Although Henry did not participate in the 1237 campaign against the Pogesanians, the margrave supplied the Order with two large river-boats which defeated the smaller craft used by the Prussian tribes. Near the Prussian settlement of Truso, Elbing (ElblƒÖg) was founded with colonists from L√ºbeck, while Christburg (Dzierzgo≈Ñ) protected the land east of Marienwerder. From 1238 to 1240, the Teutonic Knights campaigned against the Bartians, Natangians, and Warmians. A small force of crusading knights were slaughtered besieging the Warmian fort of Honeida,Wyatt, p. 143 leading Marshal Dietrich von Berheim to return with a larger army. When the Warmian commander Kodrune advised that the pagans should surrender and convert, Honeida's own garrison killed him, leading Dietrich to order a successful capture of the fort.Wyatt, p. 151 The fort on the Vistula Lagoon was renamed Balga and rebuilt in 1239 to protect the Order's territory in Ermeland. A Prussian counterattack to reclaim the fort failed, and the local Prussian leader Piopso was killed.Wyatt, p. 152 Seasonal reinforcements led by Otto I, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg consolidated Teutonic control over Natangia and Bartia. In a bull of October 1, 1243, Pope Innocent IV and William of Modena divided Prussia into the Dioceses of Culm, Pomesania, Ermeland, and Samland, although the territory of the last had not yet been conquered. First Prussian Uprising Teutonic state ca. 1260 The Teutonic Knights' further advance into Prussia was slowed by the outbreak of the First Prussian Uprising in 1242. Alarmed by the crusaders' rapid expansion into territory bordering his lands, the Christian Duke Swantopelk of Pomerellia allied with the conquered Prussians and supported an armed rebellion against the crusaders. The Teutonic Order's capacity to resist was weakened, as there were fewer German crusaders arriving and the Polish princes were feuding amongst themselves. The crusaders' cavalry and crossbow artillery proved overwhelming in level terrain, but the Prussians were more experienced and maneuverable in smaller skirmishes in wooded terrain. While the Prussian and Pomerellian troops captured the majority of the Order's castles and defeated the Knights at Rensen in 1244, they lacked the siege capabilities to finish the Knights off. The Germans used their politics and diplomacy to divide Swantopelk from the Prussians. The Poles sought the Pomerellian prince's territory along the Vistula, while the papal legate, the future Pope Urban IV, wanted the Christians to direct their energies against pagans instead of each other. Swantopelk ceased aiding the Prussians in 1248, while most of the latter agreed to peace in the Treaty of Christburg in February 1249. The treaty granted civil liberties and considerable autonomy to native converts to Christianity. While the majority of tribes followed the terms of the treaty, intermittent fighting continued until 1253, with the Natangians even defeating the Order at Kr√ºcken in November 1249. Samland After the western Prussians were forcibly colonized by the early 1250s, the Teutonic Knights continued their advance north and east, next facing the Sambians of thickly-populated Samland. Komtur Heinrich Stango of Christburg led an army across the Vistula Lagoon in 1252, with the intention of attacking Romuve. The Sambians defeated the crusaders in battle, however, killing Stango in the process.Wyatt, pp. 203‚Äì204 To replace the fallen soldiers, the pope and Poppo von Osterna, the new Grand Master, began preaching a crusade against the Sambians. In 1253 Poppo and the Provincial Master, Dietrich von Gr√ºningen, as well as the Margrave of Meissen, reduced the resisting Galindians but spared too much further violence; the Order was concerned that the Prussians would seek to join Poland if they were pressed too greatly.Wyatt, pp. 209‚Äì210 With the resisting tribes decimated, Pope Innocent IV directed Dominican friars to preach the crusade, and the Order sent embassies to the Kings of Hungary, Bohemia, and the princes of the Holy Roman Empire. While the Order waited for the crusaders to arrive in Prussia, the Livonian branch \\"founded\\" Memel (Klaipƒóda) along the Curonian Lagoon to prevent the Samogitians from assisting the Sambians. As the chronicles attest, the \\"founding\\" was accomplished by burning an existing native city to the ground and exterminating the entire population that seems to have lived there, according to contiguous archeological finds, for several millennia. The 60,000-strong crusading army which gathered for the campaign included Bohemians and Austrians under the command of King Ottokar II of Bohemia, Moravians under Bishop Bruno of Olm√ºtz, Saxons under Margrave Otto III of Brandenburg, and a contingent brought by Rudolph of Habsburg.Wyatt, pp. 212‚Äì213 The Sambians were crushed at the Battle of Rudau, and the fort's garrison surrendered quickly and underwent baptism. The crusaders then advanced against Quedenau, Waldau, Caimen, and Tapiau (Gvardeysk); the Sambians who accepted baptism were left alive, but those who resisted were exterminated en masse. Samland was conquered in January 1255 in a campaign lasting less than a month.Wyatt, pp. 214‚Äì216 Near the native settlement of Tvangste, the Teutonic Knights founded K√∂nigsberg (\\"King's Mountain\\"), named in honor of the Bohemian king. Braunsberg (Braniewo), possibly named in honor of Bruno of Olm√ºtz or Bruno of Querfurt, was also founded nearby, likely in place of an existing native town. The Knights built the castle Wehlau (Znamensk) at the junction of the Alle and Pregel Rivers to guard against and be able to continue the colonization of the native Sudovian, Nadrovian, and Scalovian. Thirsko, a Christian Sambian chief, and his son Maidelo were entrusted with Wehlau.Wyatt, pp. 216‚Äì217 With the assistance of Sambian levies, the Teutonic Order advanced further into Natangia, capturing the fortresses of Capostete and Ocktolite near Wohnsdorf. The Natangian leader Godecko and his two sons were killed resisting the advance. Great Prussian Uprising (1260‚Äì1274) The Livonian Order had been invading and attempting to colonize Samogitia, which was northeast of the Prussians. The native Samogitians entered a two-year truce with the Order in 1259. In 1259 the Samogitians decided to retain the independence of their pre-Christian religion.Urban, p. 59 They defeated the Livonian Order at the Battle of Skuodas in 1259, and then inflicted a crushing defeat on the crusaders in the Battle of Durbe in 1260. The native victory inspired the Prussians to rebel again, starting the Great Prussian uprising the same year. In the minds of the indigenous peoples, their victories reinforced the validity of their pre- Christian beliefs.Urban p.59 Despite their territorial gains in Prussia, the primary emphasis of the Teutonic Knights was still the Holy Land, and few reinforcements could be spared to complete the Christianization of what was then known as Sarmatia Europea. The German princes of the Holy Roman Empire were distracted by the imperial succession, and few seasonal (summer) crusaders came to the assistance of the Prussian Brothers; the first reinforcements were defeated at Pokarwis in 1261. The Order had most of its Prussian castles destroyed during the early 1260s. Besides Prussia, the natives also raided Livonia, Poland, and Volhynia. The crusaders began to stem the resistance with the assistance of Albert I, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, and Henry III, Landgrave of Thuringia, in 1265. In the following year German crusading reinforcements were provided by Margraves Otto III and John I of Brandenburg, and the castle of Brandenburg (Ushakovo) was founded in their honor. King Ottokar II of Bohemia briefly returned to Prussia in 1267‚Äì68, but was deterred by poor weather, while Margrave Dietrich II of Meissen also campaigned with the Order in 1272.Christiansen, p. 108 The crusaders gradually killed or forced the surrender of each Prussian tribes' war leader while exterminating the native population en masse if it refused to convert to Christianity. As a result of the uprising, many native Prussians lost some of the rights they had received in the Treaty of Christburg and were subsequently reduced to serfdom. Numerous Prussians fled to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania or to Sudovia, while others were forcibly resettled by the crusaders. The tribal chiefs who remained in Prussia became vassals of the Teutonic Knights, who began rebuilding their castles in stone or brick to provide greater protection against the restive colonized population. Later campaigns Although the Teutonic Knights' offensive capability was greatly weakened during the Great Pagan Uprising, they did engage in some campaigns against the pagan on their eastern flank. The Bartians, Natangians, and Warmians had converted to Christianity, but the Sudovians and Lithuanians to their east remained pagan and continued their border warfare with the Teutonic Knights. Led by Skalmantas during the Great Uprising, the Sudovians sacked Bartenstein (Bartoszyce) in Bartia, which was to be the focal point of their borders. Defenseless against the Sudovians, the Natangians and Bartians allied with the Teutonic Knights for protection, although little assistance could be provided initially. The Christian Natangians clans gathered in 1274 and killed 2,000 of the Sudovian raiders; Grand Master Anno von Sangershausen recruited Thuringians and Meisseners to complete the Teutonic recovery of Natangia.Urban, p. 63 Anno's successor as Grand Master, Hartmann von Heldrungen, directed the Provincial Master of Prussia, Conrad von Thierberg the Elder, to attack eastward from K√∂nigsberg along the Pregel River to separate the Sudovians from the Nadrovians. Vogt Theodoric of Samland and his militia sacked two river forts and plundered a large amount of treasure and goods. Theodoric led another crusading force, including Teutonic Knights, 150 sergeants, and Prussian infantry, against another Nadrovian fort. Although the natives attempted to surrender after siege ladders were placed, most of the warriors were slaughtered by the crusaders, with only a few natives surviving to be resettled. Conrad then led the Knights past the destroyed border forts to assault the Nadrovians main redoubt of Kaminiswike, defended by 200 warriors. Most of the natives were killed after the Knights stormed the fortress, and the Nadrovian clans surrendered soon afterward to become auxiliaries of the crusaders.Urban, pp. 64‚Äì65 The Teutonic Knights then used Nadrovia and Memel as bases against Scalovia on the lower Memel River. Scalovia would then serve as a base against pagan Samogitia, which separated Teutonic Prussia from Teutonic Livonia. Because of this threat, the Lithuanians provided assistance to the pagan Scalovians, and the crusaders and pagans each engaged in border raids to distract enemy forces. Because the pagans were strongly defended in the wilderness, the Teutonic Knights focused on travelling up the Memel River toward the strong pagan fort Ragnit. Theodoric of Samland led 1,000 men in the assault. Artillery fire forced the defenders from the ramparts, allowing the crusaders to storm the walls with ladders and slaughter most of the pagans. Theodoric also captured Romige on the other bank of the Memel. The Scalovians retaliated by sacking Labiau near K√∂nigsberg. Conrad von Thierberg escalated the conflict by sending a large raid against Scalovia. Nicholas von Jeroschin documented the crusaders as killing and capturing numerous pagans. When the Scalovian warriors went in pursuit of the captured pagans, Conrad shattered the would-be rescuers in an ambush which killed the pagan leader, Steinegele. Most Scalovian nobles quickly surrendered to the Knights in the battle's aftermath.Urban, p. 67 The Teutonic Knights planned to advance against Samogitia after conquering Scalovia, but the outbreak of a new rebellion engineered by Skalmantas of the Sudovians delayed the campaign. In 1276‚Äì77 the Sudovians and Lithuanians raided Culmerland and burned settlements near the castles of Rehden, Marienwerder, Zantir, and Christburg. Theodoric of Samland was able to convince the Sambians not to rebel, and the Natangians and Warmians followed suit.Urban, p. 70 Conrad von Thierberg the Elder led 1,500 men into Kimenau in summer 1277, and crushed a Sudovian army of 3,000 near the Winse forest.Wyatt, p. 259 Many Pogesanians fled to the Lithuanians and were resettled at Gardinas, while the ones who remained in Prussia were resettled by the crusaders, probably near Marienburg (Malbork). This new brick castle, built to replace Zantir, guarded against further rebellions with Elbing and Christburg. The central Prussian tribes surrendered to the crusaders by 1277. The crusaders and Sudovians engaged in guerilla warfare, which the Sudovians were particularly adept at. However, they lacked the sheer numbers to deal with their German, Polish, and Volhynian adversaries, and the Sudovian nobility began gradually surrendering one by one. Marshal Conrad von Thierberg the Younger raided Pokima, capturing large amounts of cattle, horses, and prisoners. They then successfully ambushed the 3,000-strong force of pursuing Sudovians, losing only six Christians in the process.Urban, p. 71 In 1280 the Sudovians and Lithuanian invaded Samland, but the alerted Order had fortified their castles and deprived the raiders of provisions. While the pagans were in Samland, Komtur Ulrich Bayer of Tapiau led a devastating counter-raid into Sudovia.Wyatt, p. 262 The Polish prince Leszek the Black achieved two significant victories over the pagans, securing the Polish border, and Skalmantas fled Sudovia to Lithuania. In summer 1283, Conrad von Thierberg the Younger was named Provincial Master of Prussia and led a large army into Sudovia, finding little resistance. The Knight Ludwig von Liebenzell, who had once been a captive of the Sudovians, negotiated the surrender of 1,600 Sudovians and their leader Katingerde, who were subsequently resettled in Samland. Most of the remaining Sudovians were redistributed to Pogesania and Samland; Skalmantas was pardoned and allowed to settle at Balga. Sudovia was left unpopulated, becoming a border wilderness that protected Prussia, Masovia, and Volhynia from the Lithuanians.Urban, p. 78 The Prussians rebelled in short-lived uprisings in 1286 and 1295, but the crusaders firmly controlled the Prussian tribes by the end of the 13th century. The Prussian populace retained many of their traditions and way of life, especially after the Treaty of Christburg protected the rights of converts. The Prussian uprisings led to the crusaders only applying these rights to the most powerful converts, however, and the pace of conversion slowed. After the Prussians were militarily defeated in the second half of the 13th century, they were gradually subjected to Christianization and cultural assimilation during the following centuries as part of the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights. With the fall of Acre and Outremer and the securing of Prussia, the Order then turned its focus against Christian Pomerellia, which separated Prussia from imperial Pomerania, and against pagan Lithuania.

It is in length, and has a number of lakes along its course. Etymology The river's name derives from the mythological figure Ethniu or Eithne, who reputedly died in rapids in its lower reaches. Course Inny River at Newcastle Bridge The Inny begins as a stream at Slieve na Calliagh, in the townland of Tubride, near Oldcastle, a hilly area which holds the complex of megalithic tombs now more often named for Loughcrew, all in County Meath. In its upper reaches, it marks the boundary between Counties Meath and Cavan for about a short distance before it enters Lough Sheelin, which lies at a meeting points of Counties Cavan, Meath and Westmeath. The portion as far as Lough Sheelin is also sometimes known as the Upper Inny, or the Ross River. At Lough Sheelin, multiple tributaries join, including the Mountnugent (Mount Nugent) River and the Bellsgrove (or Belsgrove, also known as Ballyheelan) and Crover Streams, as well as the Mauraghboy, Carrick, Rusheen, Moneybeg and Schoolhouse Streams. The Upper Inny and Lough Sheelin are on limestone, while some of the Lough Sheelin tributaries flow over quartzite. From Lough Sheelin, the Inny, sometimes known as the Lower Inny from here on, forms the boundary between Westmeath and Cavan. It flows under the bridge at the village of Finea, and into Lough Kinale, where counties Cavan and Westmeath meet Longford. From there the river forms much of the boundary between Longford and Westmeath but enters Westmeath near Streete and flows into Lough Derravaragh, known for its role in the legend of the Children of Lir. It then flows near the village of Ballinalack, forms Lough Iron, and crosses into County Longford near Abbeyshrule, where the Whitworth Aqueduct suspends the Royal Canal above the river, and pumps supply the canal with water. At nearby Tenelick the mythological Princess Eithne drowned in the rapids, giving her name to the river, which powered two mills here for many years. It continues past Newcastle House to Ballymahon. Downstream of Ballymahon, the Inny again forms the county line between Longford and Westmeath, and runs westwards into Lough Ree at Inny Bay. Lough Ree is the second major lake of the River Shannon which drains into the Atlantic Ocean.

The episode aired a day earlier in Canada than the United States. Plot Ned is a young man with a special gift‚Äîhe can bring a dead person back to life with a touch. But there's a catch‚Äîif the person stays alive for more than one minute, then someone else nearby will die. Also, a second touch will bring back death, forever. Ned discovers his gift as a child when he brings his dog, Digby, back to life after he is hit by a truck. When Ned touches Digby, he springs back to life. What Ned learns later is that the revival comes with a price‚Äîif the deceased is kept alive for longer than a minute, something of \\"equal life value\\" must replace it. This special touch also has another rule. If Ned gives one more touch, the revived will die again for good. Ned's mother drops dead of an aneurysm while baking and he brings her back to life‚Äîbut this kills the father of his childhood sweetheart, Charlotte Charles, whom he likes to call \\"Chuck\\". Another touch kills Ned's mother when she kisses him goodnight. Ned's father leaves him soon after, and Ned is sent to boarding school. Chuck is sent to live with her aunts, the reclusive Lily and Vivian Charles. As their parents' funerals are held at the same time, Ned and Chuck share a first kiss, and are then parted it seems for good. Nineteen years, thirty-four weeks, one day and fifty-nine minutes later (according to the narrator), Ned owns a bakery, the Pie Hole. The narrator often refers to Ned as \\"the piemaker\\". He apparently has inherited his mother's baking talents. He also ingeniously puts his own skill to good use. To save money, he purchases old, wilting fruit and brings it back to life, as ripe and juicy as the day it was first picked. This makes his pies and confections extremely tasty. His childhood dog, Digby is still alive, since Ned has never touched him again, except with items such as a gloved hand attached to a stick used to pet him safely. Ned also moonlights as the partner of Emerson Cod, a private investigator who discovers Ned's secret gift by accident. Emerson realizes that they can turn a profit solving murders by reviving the murder victim and asking who killed them. Meanwhile, Ned's employee and neighbor, Olive Snook, has a crush on the pie maker‚Äîbut due to his childhood, Ned has learned not to get attached to anybody, and he wards off Olive's advances. Everything changes when Ned learns that Chuck has been murdered on a cruise ship. He and Emerson travel to Ned's hometown, Coeur d'Coeurs, to solve the case. Ned revives Chuck, and she's thrilled to be reunited with her old friend. She doesn't know who killed her, and Ned only has a minute to return her to the grave. But he can't bear to lose her again, and keeps her alive, killing the crooked funeral director, Lawrence Schatz, instead. Ned hides Chuck in the coffin, and secretly arranges to rescue her after the funeral. Chuck stays in Ned's apartment‚Äîbut despite the romantic feelings that they share, they can't ever touch again. This prompts Ned to use different types of items to allow for them to touch \\"by proxy\\", such as kissing though plastic wrap, installing a plexiglass partition in Ned's car, and holding hands via gloved hands. Chuck is happy to make a fresh start on her life, and she approaches Ned and Emerson with a plan to solve her own murder and collect the reward. They go to Boutique Travel Travel Boutique, where manager Deedee Duffield offered Chuck a free cruise in exchange for transporting a pair of plaster monkeys. When they arrive, Deedee has been killed as well. Ned brings Deedee back to life, but she dies again before telling them who killed her. Ned, Emerson and Chuck realize that if the plaster monkeys were in Chuck's possession on the cruise ship, then they would have been sent to her next of kin‚ÄîAunt Vivian and Aunt Lily. They go to Vivian and Lily's house, to find the monkeys before the killer does. Ned and Emerson talk to Chuck's aunts, ex-synchronized swimmers with matching social phobias. Chuck has to stay out of sight‚Äîbut she's determined to help, and she climbs up the back wall to her bedroom. Lily goes upstairs to collect the monkeys for Ned, and is attacked by the killer. Ned is also attacked, and Chuck rescues him. Lily survives her attack, and shoots the killer dead. Ned and Chuck discover that the plaster monkeys were actually made of gold. Lily and Vivian collect the reward for catching Chuck's killer, and decide to leave the house for the first time in years. Ned, Chuck and Emerson agree to work together‚Äîbut despite their yearnings, Ned and Chuck can never touch again. Reception Diane Werts of Newsday liked \\"Pie-lette,\\" saying that it \\"stakes out a brave, broad swath of storytelling territory, and a potentially fertile one.\\"‚Äîhowever, Werts didn't think it would automatically lead to Pushing Daisies success. Brian Lowry of Variety made similar comments in his review, saying that \\"Pie-lette\\" stood \\"head and shoulders above this fall's other seedlings,\\" while being wary that Pushing Daisies \\"will collapse by episode four or five.\\" Some reviewers also commented on the unique visual nature of the episode; Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer described the look of \\"Pie-lette\\" as similar to an \\"intricately illustrated children's book.\\" However, Maureen Ryan, of the Chicago Tribune, felt that director Sonnenfeld's vivid style didn't \\"leave much room for heart.\\" The pilot received universal acclaim having a Metacritic score of 86, citing it as one of the best new shows of 2007. The episode attracted 13 million viewers in the United States; it was the most-watched new series and 14th in overall viewership for the week.

Peploe, was moored in a dock basin at Blyth (), a few yards from the 6,620 ton depot ship . The ex-cruiser was in harbour for repairs to her main engines and during the afternoon she built up a head of steam and began to carry out a slow-speed trial. In the restricted waters of the dock basin the suction from the depot-ship's propellers drew the submarine towards her and, despite the efforts of both crews to keep the two vessels apart, Vulcans screws struck the stern of the submarine, cut through her outer casing and sliced open the pressure hull. H41 sank quickly as the sea rushed in and the crew were lucky to escape. HMS H41 was raised and was then sold on 12 March 1920 in Sunderland.

It starts near Narbeth, where its source is buried, then runs free for a mile or so before entering Philadelphia at the Overbrook station. The creek, which drains about , gave its name to a neighborhood in Philadelphia that it flows under.  Development  Mill Creek Sewer, ca. 1883, at 47th Street and Haverford Avenue in West Philadelphia. The effort to encapsulate and bury Mill Creek in a sewer pipe ran from 1869 to 1894. The creek, called Nanganesey by the Lenape Indians in their patent to white settlers, was renamed Quarn Creek by the Swedish settlers. It later took the names Monson's Great Mill Fall, Mill Creek and Little Mill Creek after the factories it powered at Grays Ferry. Originally, Mill Creek was fast-flowing (10 miles per hour) and could discharge 300,000 cubic feet per minute into the Schuylkill. It was known to flood, destroying crops and creating seas of mud. In 1834, merchant and banker John Buckman built a 90-foot dam across Mill Creek just south of Market Street at current-day 46th Street. The dam diverted some of the water into a 12-foot- wide mill race that ran parallel to the Creek for about 1,100 feet and into a 30-by-60-foot \\"forebay.\\" The water flowed under Market Street and over waterwheels that powered Buckman's mill. As urban development began in West Philadelphia, the city covered several stream beds with cisterns and a layer of fill deep enough to level the land so that it could be platted into a regular street grid. In 1866, a land survey determined that Mill Creek should be drained. The covering of Mill Creek began in 1869, encapsulating the watercourse in a -diameter drainpipe said to be the largest sewer pipe in the world at the time. By 1872, the creek was buried south to Baltimore Avenue. Its burial was completed around 1895, allowing the grid of rowhouse development to continue toward the city's western edge at Cobbs Creek. Natural erosion, abetted by spotty maintenance of the cistern, has caused occasional collapses of the buildings above. In the 1930s, several homes collapsed on Walnut Street between 43rd and 44th Streets after they were undermined by the creek. There have been road collapses on 43rd Street, south of Walnut. In 1955, the block of Sansom Street between 43rd and 44th Streets collapsed and was condemned. The creek undermines the roadbed where the Route 34 and Route 13 trolleys cross 43rd Street. A prominent feature of Clark Park is its \\"bowl,\\" once a mill pond fed by the creek. Montgomery County has begun an effort to restore the creek's watershed through its Mill Creek Stream Restoration.

The rolling hills in the area were named White for several reasons: The snow melted slower in the spring, the visible lyme rock, and the wild dogwood blossoms. White Hills is bordered by Monroe to the north and west, the Housatonic River to the east, the \\"downtown\\" to the southeast, and Huntington to the southwest.

It was established in the late 19th century and has been owned by the same family since 1903. On December 27, 2011, the company's historic 114-year-old mill burned down. Construction on a new facility began the following summer, and Swany White Flour Mills was able to remain in business. The mill complex had been listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 as the Freeport Roller Mill and Miller's House for its local significance in the theme of commerce. In addition to the 1898 mill, which was expanded to three stories in 1912, the complex consisted of an attached brick powerhouse, the adjacent miller's house built in 1900, and a disused freestanding brick smokestack. With It was the last remaining 19th-century mill in use in Minnesota. The miller's house and smokestack still stand, with the 2012 replacement mill between them, and the property has not been delisted from the National Register. History The builder of the original mill, Anton Hoeschen, did not intend to run the mill himself. Instead he saw it as an investment in the community and hoped that he would find a buyer who wanted to be a miller. After several ownership changes in its first few years, the mill was bought in 1903 by Hubert and Peter Thelen, who ran the mill together. They chose the name Swany White for their brand of white flour to suggest that their product was as white as a swan. In the early years the business was one of a number of small mills throughout Minnesota where local farmers could sell their wheat close to home rather than having to ship it to large mills in Minneapolis. At the mill they could sell their grain outright or trade raw wheat for ground flour for their own family's use. In 1913 the Thelen brothers remodeled the mill, adding a basement and more manufacturing space. The changes made the mill more efficient, and it was able to produce twice as much flour as it had before. After Peter Thelen's retirement in 1953, his son Walter took over the mill. In 1966 he replaced the mill's original steam engine with an electric motor. While other small mills were not able to remain profitable during an era of increased consolidation and a downturn in Minnesota wheat production, Walter Thelen came up with a way to keep the mill in business by producing a slightly different product. During the 1970s he persuaded organic farmers to produce organic flour, and he made arrangements with specialty bakers in area. His strategy worked, and Swany White Flour was sold in food cooperatives and health food stores in Minnesota. He also sold flour as far away as the East Coast. In 1982 the mill was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, but it remained a working mill. In 1998, Walter's son Gary took over the family business when he bought it from his father. By that time, the Swany White Flour Mill had become a Minnesota landmark. When photographer Richard Olsenius spent time in Freeport looking for places that had inspired Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon, he photographed Gary Thelen and his mill. Members of local bread clubs would also visit to see how a century-old mill worked. Swany White Mill burned to the ground on December 27, 2011. No one was injured. The fire was reported at 4:48 P.M. by an employee. It took over five surrounding fire agencies to put out the blaze. That night, people gathered to watch the local landmark burn, with many holding hands and crying. Though he initially claimed that he would not rebuild the mill, Gary Thelen changed his mind, and a new Swany White mill opened in 2012. Production Rear view of the original smokestack and replacement mill building For white flour, Swany White had used the same milling equipment since 1913. It had a milling capacity of about per hour, or per business day. This was a fraction of the milling capacity of most mills. It is notable that Swany White Flour had continued to operate as a small independent while most other small regional producers have either given up or sold out. For its conventional products, the mill had a commercial presence mainly in the Upper Midwest, however its organic products were distributed more widely. In addition to sales to distributors and retailers, Swany White had a retail outlet at the mill in Freeport. The mill's most popular product was a bleached flour sold under the brand name Faith's Best, which accounted for about 60% of all sales.

Built in 1781, it was the home of the American lawyer and politician Oliver Ellsworth until his death in 1807, and was designated a National Historic Landmark because of this association. Ellsworth (1745-1807) helped draft the United States Constitution, served as the third Chief Justice of the United States, and was a United States Senator from Connecticut. The house is owned and maintained and operated as a museum by the Connecticut Daughters of the American Revolution, and is open for tours upon request. Description and history The Ellsworth House stands in northern Windsor, on the east side of Palisado Avenue (Connecticut Route 159), near its junction with Macktown Road. Palisado Avenue is a historically old road, originally serving as the main north-south route on the west bank of the Connecticut River. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a two-bay extension to the south that is recessed beneath a shared roofline supported by Tuscan columns. The original five-bay block has end chimneys. The main entrance is at its center, sheltered by a 19th-century gabled portico. The interior retains features of the late 19th century, including furnishings and decorative materials associated with Oliver Ellsworth and his family.. A house was built on this site in 1740 by David Ellsworth, and it is in that house that Oliver Ellsworth was raised. Documentary records show that Oliver Ellsworth, having inherited the property, contracted in 1781 for the construction of a new house on the site of the old, which may have reused some of its elements, including the foundation. His family moved in the following year, and it remained his home until his death in 1807. The two-bay extension to the south was added in 1788, although the roofline and Tuscan columns are a 19th-century alteration. The name Elmwood derives from the thirteen elm trees Ellsworth planted in honor of the thirteen colonies. Elmwood was visited by two sitting Presidents: George Washington (on October 21, 1789) and John Adams (October 3, 1799). The house was occupied by the Ellsworth family until 1903 when it was given to the Connecticut Daughters of the American Revolution.Connecticut Daughters of the American Revolution, Inc. The homestead was restored in the late 1980s and early 1990s and is now a museum.Oliver Ellsworth Homestead Museum The property includes a meeting hall built in the 1930s, which the DAR make available as a function and event space.

Early life and emigration Andrew Christian Peter Willatzen was born in North Germany in 1876 and came to the United States in 1900. Born with the last name Willatzen, he changed the spelling to Willatsen c. 1918 due to anti-German sentiment during World War I. This may also explain the fact that later he always identified with the Danish in his background. Career He first worked as a carpenter, then as a draftsman, and arrived at Frank Lloyd Wright's Studio in Oak Park, Illinois in 1902 or 1903. The Studio was just entering its most creative period, and Willatzen soon became a valued apprentice. He later claimed \\"full responsibility\\" for Wright's 1905 remodeling of the lobbies of Chicago's Rookery Building, and said that \\"The Boss\\" accepted his design for the fence of the Larkin Administration Building (Buffalo, NY, 1907, destroyed) without changes. Willatzen also worked on the interiors of the Martin House in Buffalo and was hired by the Martins for a 1920 remodel, while Wright was away in Japan. He also worked for the Chicago firms of Spencer and Powers and Pond and Pond.Kirtland Cutter (by Henry Matthews, Kirtland Kelsey Cutter, page 193) By 1907, Willatzen had about three years experience off and on with Wright. That year he moved to Spokane, Washington, secured a position with the prestigious firm of Cutter & Malmgren, and was soon sent to head the Seattle office and supervise the construction of the Seattle Golf & Country Club (1908) at The Highlands, north of the city. In 1909, Willatzen formed a partnership with Francis Barry Byrne (1883‚Äì1967), whom he had known at Wright's office. The new firm quickly began a series of homes adapting Wright's principles to the Northwest environment. The Charles E. Clarke House (1909) at The Highlands, and the Frederick Handschy House (1910) at 2433 9th Ave. W., Seattle, are large bungalows which draw on Wright's early gable-roofed Prairie houses, and also show influences from other Prairie School architects such as Walter Burley Griffin. The George Matzen House (1910) at 320 Kinnear Place, Seattle, is hipped-roofed, stuccoed, with a stunted cruciform plan typical of the Prairie style confined by a narrow, sloping site. The interlocking spaces of the interior and the custom designed leaded glass, light fixtures and furniture combined to give the Matzen House perhaps the finest of Willatzen and Byrne's executed interiors. The proposal for the A.S. Kerry Mansion (1910) at The Highlands (constructed 1911 in an abbreviated form), reflected Wright's long, low, more expansive designs. Although lacking the grand living and dining spaces of the original project, this house remains an impressive design; it is perhaps the best known of Willatzen and Byrne's work and is sometimes mistakenly attributed to Frank Lloyd Wright. The Oscar E. Maurer House (1910) at 2715 Belvidere, Seattle, the John T. McVay House (1911) at 1025 Belmont Place, Seattle, the George Bellman House (1912) at 2021 E. Lynn, Seattle, and the L. George Hagar House (1913) at 303 W. Prospect, Seattle, (also scaled down from a grander first proposal) are typical of the firm's handling of more modest homes. Willatzen and Byrne also designed in the Craftsman mode and various period revival styles. Most significant of these is the Stickleyesque George E. Felmlay House (1911) at 6975 47th Ave. S.W., Seattle, and the Carleton Huiscamp House at The Highlands (1912), the firm's most important eclectic work. This imposing Dutch Colonial's strong lines and fine detailing show that the partners were comfortable with period revival design. Later additions have unfortunately detracted from the house's original appearance. The firm also produced numerous business, commercial, and industrial structures, including their first project, the many oriel-windowed Nelson, Tagholm and Jensen Building (Hotel Louisa) at King Street & 7th Ave. S., Seattle, (1909). Andrew Willatzen's Professional Creed, 1910s Barry Byrne left Seattle early in 1913, moving first to California and eventually returning to the Midwest. Byrne had a long and celebrated career, mainly in the designing of Catholic churches. Our Lady of Good Help (1910) in Hoquiam, Washington, appears to be the first of this line. In solo practice, Willatsen continued to design homes reflecting the Prairie idiom, including his most noted solo work, the Joseph Black House (1914) at 222 W. Highland Dr.,Black House prior to destruction (Queen Anne Historical Society) Black House 2003 Seattle, which illustrated the Prairie Style adapted to a more conventional, central hall type plan. The Black House was the prototype for several other Willatsen designs over the following decade, but its sweeping gable roof and continuous band of second floor windows set it apart from the others. The curved entrance canopy became a sort of Willatsen trademark, gracing numerous homes of both Prairie and Period design, and one church. This magnificent home was illegally destroyed over the Martin Luther King holiday weekend in 2004.Queen Anne reels after Wright-style house is torn down (Seattle Post- Intelligencer. January 23, 2004) Seattle P-I The William E. Robinson House (1913) at 2011 11th Ave. E., Seattle, and the E.E. Vogue House (1918‚Äì19) at 1016 E. Lynn St., Seattle, are good examples of his approach to more modest homes, while the Gustav V. Rasmussen House (1921‚Äì25) at 3211 Cascadia Ave., Seattle, and Willatsen's favorite project, the O.L. Martin House (1928) at 3722 E. Prospect, Seattle, illustrate his handling of larger budget residences. Traditional homes also remained in his repertoire. Two 1914 commissions reflected the Tudor style. The Frederick Hurlbut House at 1015 E. Prospect, Seattle, is a very personal design with Prairie overtones. Willatsen's typical attention to detail, such as the type of hardware used, is readily apparent in this house. The Jeremiah Neterer House at 2702 Broadway E., Seattle, is a more academic work. The John H. Carter House (1916) at 1615 36th Ave., Seattle, and the Fred Burwell House (1925) at 425 35th Ave., Seattle, illustrate the Classical and Federal revival styles respectively. Besides custom homes, Willatsen produced designs for builders. A group of homes for Carl Hedeen at 1711, 1717, and 1809 NE. 63rd St. and 1738 Naomi Place, all in Seattle, (1915‚Äì17) have been identified. After the decline in the popularity of the Prairie School, Willatsen worked in a wide variety of styles, designing stores, churches, and many other types of structures. From 1915 to the 1960s he was the architect for general alterations to the Seattle Pike Place Market. The simplicity and common sense of his work won many loyal customers who turned repeatedly to him for their architectural needs until his retirement in the late 1940s. He continued to work occasionally in his retirement, mainly for friends and old clients. Two modest standouts from this period are the 1955 Church & North Office at 3701 SW Alaska St., Seattle, and the Richard Desimone House of 1959 at 2605 SW 170th St. in Normandy Park, Washington, a Midwest-style rambler in Roman brick. Andrew Willatsen died in Seattle in 1974 at the age of 97. His papers, drawings, and the furniture and art glass windows from the 1915 remodeling of his Boston Block office were acquired from Willatsen by the University of Washington shortly before his death. The windows are in the Architectural Library in Gould Hall. The table and chairs are in the University's Branch Office at the Palazzo Pio, Rome, Italy. A bookcase with leaded glass doors is in the office of the Dean of Architecture in Gould Hall. These are the only examples of Willatsen's furniture known to still exist. Willatsen was a major contributor to the development of progressive architecture in the Northwest, and he, along with Byrne, must be credited with bringing the Prairie Style to Seattle over 30 years before Wright's first Northwest commission.  Bibliographical note  His surviving drawings, some notebooks, papers, and a transcription of his personal project ledger are in the Special Collections and Manuscript Sections of The University of Washington Libraries. A copy is available in the University Architecture Library in Gould Hall. Much work is also documented in contemporary periodicals such as Pacific Builder & Engineer, Pacific Coast Architect, and Bungalow Magazine. Early photos of the Clarke and Kerry Houses can be found in Homes and Gardens of the Pacific Coast (Frank Calvert; Editor, 1913) reprinted by the Queen Anne Historical Society, Seattle, (1988).

The pad lets users of this device scroll through a long list of songs with a few flicks of the finger, then press the button to select tracks or change the volume. It was designed by Microsoft for the release of the second generation Zune. Description and operation The Zune Pad is about 24 mm in diameter and resembles a square like figure. It comprises a touch-sensitive button with simulated up, down, left, right and center navigational \\"button\\" response. It combines this touch interface with standard 5-way D-pad functionality. The Pad is capable of detecting movements in all directions. The user can press the top, bottom, left, right and center of the pad inward to navigate through lists or select an item or use the touch interface to move up, down, left and right. Selection is always done with a center click. The user can touch and slide to move up or down on the screen. The motion of the select box on the screen is viewport-controlled where moving the finger up moves the view of the content up. This is unlike direct content manipulation interfaces, where moving the finger up moves the content up, equivalent to moving the viewport down the list. The Zune Pad allows the user to coast after flicking the list and to accelerate through the list with repeated flicks, unlike direct content manipulation interfaces in which a touch immediately grabs and stops the onscreen content. The user can thus move through a large list at high speed with just the flick gesture. Touching or clicking the Zune Pad will cause the coasting to stop. It also allows the user to slide left and right to move through the menus at the top of the screen. The user can always click to navigate. There is no navigation function which can be performed only with the touch functions ‚Äî the D-pad functionality is always sufficient. Function The Zune Pad is a capacitive touchpad and therefore detection is dependent upon using a finger. Directional pad functions are simulated by determining where the user's finger is when pressing the button. This works well unless the user is wearing gloves or anything that the touch surface cannot \\"read\\". The user cannot adjust the sensitivity and scroll speed, but can choose to turn it off and use the button as a standard directional pad instead.

He was the founder of Marabou and CEO of Freia, now owned and operated by Mondelez International. Freia clock at Egertorget square in Oslo Background Throne Holstt was born in Trondheim, Norway. He was the son of Johan Martinus Brodtkorb Holst (1829-1913) and Josefa G√∏rvell (1835-1913). In 1894, he married Hanna Richter Jenssen (1873-1952), daughter of Hans Peter Jenssen (1848-1902) and Signe Klingenberg (1852-1925). They were the parents of business executives Henning Throne-Holst (1895-1980) and Harald Throne-Holst (1905-96). Career Throne Holst graduated from Trondheim Cathedral School and attended a trade school in Hamburg (1887-88). He started his business career as a salesman in his father's merchant business in Trondheim. In 1892, Holst bought a recently started chocolate factory in Oslo. Holst built up Freia (Freia Chocolade Fabrik) to be Norway's leading chocolate manufacturer, and a modern workplace, with canteens and its own park for workers, Freiaparken in Oslo. The company was also the first in Norway with its own health care policy, and the first with a 48-hour working week. His son, Harald Throne-Holst was managing director of the Freia chocolate factory from 1948 to 1970 and later CEO. In 1916, Throne Holst established chocolate production at Sundbyberg, Sweden under the brand name Marabou with his son Henning Throne-Holst (1895-1980) as CEO and director. The brand Marabou was created as the brand name Freia was already existed in Sweden. Actual production did not start until 1919 due to shortages in cocoa supply caused by World War I. He served in the Oslo city council (1904-10) and was elected to the Norwegian Parliament (1909-12) as a representative of the Oslo neighborhood of Hammersborg. In 1923, Throne Holst was appointed chairman of Handelsbanken. Holst distanced himself from Vidkun Quisling by the beginning of the 1930s. In 1941, Holst was in the minority in the Federation of Norwegian Industries who protested against the increased trade that would be introduced during Nazi German occupation. Johan Throne Holst died during 1946 and was buried at V√•r Frelsers gravlund in Oslo. His family retained control over both Marabou and Freia until 1992.

A little further north, Harbour Cove and Hawker's Cove (where the Padstow lifeboat was stationed until 1967) are connected at low water by an extensive sandy beach which forms part of a sandbank at the mouth of the estuary known as Doom Bar.

The problem of hooliganism related to football has been compared to what he described as the dark days of football hooliganism in Western Europe in the 1980s. Hooliganism in Poland is comparable in its scale to what notoriously used to happen in England, but no longer does. Many Polish football clubs have hooligan firms associated with them. History =Early years= The first reports of clashes between fans during football games date back to the 1930s. On 2 June 1935 after a game between Cracovia and Ruch Chorz√≥w, the police had to \\"intervene and surround the field\\". On 15 June 1936, the PrzeglƒÖd Sportowy daily sports newspaper published an appeal by the management of ≈ölƒÖsk ≈öwiƒôtoch≈Çowice, asking their fans to \\"control their behaviour and maintain order\\". During the occupation of Poland in World War II, the Nazi German occupiers banned all sports. However, \\"illegal\\" games were played on regular basis. During one of these matches in Krak√≥w on 17 October 1943, fans of Cracovia and Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w interrupted the game and started fighting which spread onto the streets of the Ludwinow district in Krak√≥w. The fighting lasted for several hours. After a match on 29 September 1947 in Sosnowiec, between RKU Sosnowiec and AKS Chorz√≥w (ethnic rivalry, derby) fighting broke out resulting in the death of one fan and scores of others injured. Sosnowiec won the match 3-2, however in the first leg AKS Chorz√≥w had won 3-0, meaning they were promoted to the First Division. After the match, 20,000 home fans were slowly moving out of the stadium, pushed by firemen and Milicja Obywatelska. Skirmishes broke out, and the Milicja Obywatelska functionaries, with guns, lined up on the pitch and attacked the fans with bayonets and the fighting lasted for two hours. Sosnowiec fans tried to attack AKS's players, the referees and the Milicjants. Although incidents from the 1920s to the 1960s were numerous, there was no organized hooliganism in Poland. =1970s= There is no official information about football related violence in the 1970s as any incidents that happened were not reported by the Polish media which was compliant with the policies of the Communist authorities in the People's Republic of Poland. Sporadic incidents took place, usually in the streets near to stadiums, near railway stations. By the late 1970s there were about ten hooligan firms, mostly connected to Polish First Division clubs. Few Polish football fans travelled to away matches. The common name for Polish football fans is scarfers (szalikowcy in ). It is unclear when the first scarfers appeared. As the number of scarfers grew, the Polish Football Association tried to curb these groups. The renowned referee and journalist Grzegorz Aleksandrowicz initiated the so-called \\"Fan Clubs\\", but this idea disappeared at the beginning of the 1980s, due to martial law in Poland and Aleksandrowicz's death. In the mid-1970s, friendships between some groups began. Probably the oldest still active alliance is the one between fans of ≈ölƒÖsk Wroc≈Çaw and Lechia Gda≈Ñsk which dates back to 1977. Other alliances, such as that between Legia Warsaw and Zag≈Çƒôbie Sosnowiec and that between Polonia Warsaw and Cracovia date back to the late 1970s. Usually, alliances were (and still are) created by firms of clubs that are located a considerable distance from each other. Firms of neighbouring clubs, especially in the same city, are in most cases enemies. =1980s= The early 1980s saw a rise in the number of hooligan firms and in the number of hooligans. On 9 May 1980 Legia Warsaw faced Lech Pozna≈Ñ in Czƒôstochowa in the final of the Polish Cup. The match was won by Legia. However, it is remembered by many as one of the biggest clashes between fans. Fighting, which involved hundreds of fans, started in the streets of the city before the game. A number of people were seriously injured. The Communist government of Poland concealed all the facts about the incident. Since that game, fans of both sides have regarded each other as enemies. The first reported incident of football hooliganism by the media happened in 1981 during a match between Widzew ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Legia Warszawa which was shown live on Polish television, when Legia fans invaded the pitch. As it was transmitted live on television, the government was unable to cover up the incident. The number of incidents during games grew in the 1980s. Although the statistics in this period are incomplete, between 1984 and 1988, 99 cases of disorder were reported, most of them in big cities. Two football fans were officially reported to have been killed in the 1980s due to football hooliganism. =1990s= Until the late 1980s the football clubs required state sponsorship to exist. The revenues from ticket sales and merchandising were irrelevant at that time. Before entering a free-market economy, the bargaining power of supporters thus played a relatively marginal role in the Polish football scene. Since then Hooligan firms in Poland have organised themselves and are often influenced by the skinhead subculture. Some skinhead members of firms are described as \\"official hooligans\\", and their role is to take part in disturbances at the stadiums. They often use weapons, such as wooden sticks, bats, baseball bats and knives. In Poland, the 1990s saw a gradual increase in football-related violence and development of the football hooligan subculture. Hooligan incidents in Poland gained more media attention in the 1990s, at a time when fanzines started to be published, which included details of incidents and what was described as the \\"Polish hooligan league\\". From the early 1990s, Polish hooligans were heavily influenced by the skinhead, UK and western hooligans culture. Data from the Komenda G≈Ç√≥wna Policji (Central Command of the Police) showed a steady increase from 1991 to 1997, although there was then a decrease in the subsequent years. Fights became more organized, and started moving away from the stadiums - Ustawka fight. As the decade progressed, fights would be organised by mobile phone and over the Internet. The 1990s saw a rise in the number of hooligan firms up to about 70 or 80. Often hooligans would join forces to attack the police, as happened during a World Cup qualifying match between Poland and England on 29 May 1993 in Chorz√≥w. Feuding between Polish hooligans escalated when, before the match, hools from Cracovia stabbed a Pogo≈Ñ Szczecin fan to death. Polish hooligans from Lechia Gda≈Ñsk, Katowice and Legia Warszawa fought each other before, during and after the match. Other hooligan disturbances followed the Polish national team, with incidents in Zabrze in 1994, and abroad in Rotterdam in 1992 and Bratislava in 1995. Also in the 1990s, Polish hooligan violence spread through the lower leagues and into more urban areas of the country. In May 1997, fans of Fourth Division club, Sandecja Nowy SƒÖcz clashed with the police, and 54 fans were detained. =2000s= Even though the Polish government tried to erase hooliganism, incidents were still common in Polish stadiums. However, like hooligans in Western Europe, Polish firms now pre- arrange their fights, which in Poland are known as ustawka, and are mainly fought in meadows, rural terrains, far from city centers and cops. In December 2005 a huge organised fight took place in a forest outside Frankfurt between Polish and German hooligans. The Poles won the battle, after which they were arrested by German police. It was feared that the fight was a warm up for more fights during the World Cup which was to be held in Germany the next year. On 3 May 2004 Ruch Chorz√≥w was playing a match with ≈ÅKS, arch-rival of Widzew which hool's have friendship with Ruch firm Psycho Fans. Planned riots erupted in halftime. A lot of fans of three clubs were injured also policemen (55 hospitalized), 12 police cars were devastated. Despite the capture of many hool's (over 100) Policja are still looking for participants in brawl.Press clip about football hooliganism in Poland by przegladsportowy.pl In March 2006 a Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w fan was dragged from a car and stabbed to death, the eighth stabbing murder in twelve months of football hooligans in Poland. Football violence is still present even in city centres. In May 2006 over 50 police functionaries were injured, with over 30 hospitalised and 230 hooligans detained after disturbances in Warsaw following a match between Legia Warsaw and Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w. Thousands of Legia fans had converged in the city centre celebrating the club winning the Polish League title, where they broke into shops, damaged cafes and restaurants and attacked the police with stones. The police had to use water cannons to contain the hooligans. Before the 2006 World Cup in Germany, German authorities and some of the European media were concerned that Polish hooligans would try to disrupt the tournament. Reports stated that Polish hooligans were ready to do battle with fans from England and other countries in Germany. However, no major incidents were reported, with isolated clashes taking place such as drunken German and Polish fans clashing in Dortmund resulting in 300 arrests, half of whom were Polish. It was stated in 2006 that the current football hooliganism in Poland is far worse than the dark days of English football hooliganism in the 1980s, with nearly every Polish professional football club having a fan base rooted in hooliganism. This is especially true now as English football hooliganism has become a rare and harshly punished occurrence, with few firms still running, the most prevalent being \\"The Soul Crew\\", the firm of Welsh football club Cardiff City FC, who have more fan bans than any other team in the English leagues. A match between local Warsaw rivals, Polonia Warszawa and Legia in April 2006 saw over 1,300 riot police, armed with CS gas and rifles with rubber bullets fail to control 3,000 fans. Instead of keeping the two sets of fans apart, the police shepherded them all into the city centre where running battles ensued. A common feature of Polish hooligans is also ambushing rival fans then stealing their scarves and flags, before tying them to railings in the stadium and setting them on fire. In July 2007, UEFA banned Legia Warsaw from European competition for one season and also for one more season should they qualify for any European competition in the following five years, following riots during an Intertoto Cup match in Lithuania against Vetra Vilnius forced the game to be abandoned. With Vetra Vilnius winning 2-0 at half time, several hundred Legia fans, out of the 2,500 Polish fans present, wrecked the stand they were in and invaded the pitch, where they attacked 200 police officers, throwing concrete, bottles and flares at them. They then ripped up advertising boards in an attempt to prevent the mounted police, tear gas and baton charges by the police. A total of 26 Legia fans were arrested, with ten later released. Seven fans were later jailed for between five and fifteen days and fined. In September 2007, Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w hooligans killed a Korona Kielce fan in Kielce. The Korona Kielce firm had been allied with Cracovia at the time. =2010s= As the modernisation of stadiums and further repression of fans increases, incidents in the public eye remained sporadic, with now majority of incidents involving police. Hooliganism remains popular, but has been pushed further underground. In April 2012, Polonia Warsaw fans were attacked by security guards with tear gas after they refused to remove the flag \\"Down with Communism\\". At the Euro 2012, despite a generally peaceful tournament, a fight broke after Russian fans marched through the capital Warsaw for their match against Poland and were attacked by Polish hooligans. The only other incident at the tournament held in Poland (and Ukraine) was the fight between Croatian fans, and the arrest of several Irish fans, however no Poles were involved. In home derby match against Legia's reserves, a fight broke out between two sets of Polonia Warsaw fans in April 2013. The fight broke out due ideological differences and arguments over apoliticism in the stand among fans. When Lech Pozna≈Ñ played Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w in May 2013, the Lech fans successfully stole a Wis≈Ça flag from the away stand, causing unrest among Wis≈Ça fans. Despite this, no actual fights broke out, however the away stand was demolished. In August 2013, in match lower league match KS ≈Åomianki versus Polonia Warsaw, hundreds of Legia fans turned up and tried to attack the visiting fans, although they only clashed with police. KS ≈Åomianki was later fined for failing to adequately secure the venue and poor organisation was cited. In March 2014, in the first incident inside a top-level stadium in years occurred when Legia Warsaw fans attacked the visiting Jagiellonia Bia≈Çystok fans after Legia fans displayed several previously stolen Jagiellonia flags. The match was abandoned. There were several arrests. A short time later that same year, Zawisza Bydgoszcz fans began to boycott matches after a match against Widzew ≈Å√≥d≈∫. The fans claim that the police brutally assaulted fans, when preventing Zawisza and ≈ÅKS ≈Å√≥d≈∫ fans from entering the stadium, including women, the elderly and children, causing one fan to lose their eye. Following the incident, the fans asked to see the security footage, however, the footage was claimed to be lost due to an alleged \\"technical fault\\".http://pilkarskaprawda.pl/news/Radoslaw-Osuch-vs- kibice-czesc-II-3314 The club chairman, Rados≈Çaw Osuch, and a large portion of the media and public opinion, attributed the incident to football hooliganism.http://m.bydgoszcz.gazeta.pl/bydgoszcz/1,106753,15029609,Osuch_kontra_kibole__Poczatek_wojny_o_Zawisze.html On 2 May 2015, at a Concordia Knur√≥w versus Ruch Radzionk√≥w fifth division match in Knur√≥w, Upper Silesia, police started firing rubber bullets at fans from a close distance after several home fans jumped onto the pitch and ran towards the visiting fans. A 27-year-old fan of Concordia, Dawid Dziedzic, was shot, and despite attempts to resuscitate him he died shortly in hospital hours later. He was a single father, described as a caring parent from a modest background. In the aftermath, rioting ensued for several days. 46 people were arrested, many injured fans as well as policemen. Thousands of people attended Dawid's funeral on 7 May 2015. Politics Due to long communist rule in country and overall Polish society's social conservatism, Polish football supporters are on the right-wing political spectrum. In the PRL era, football grounds and the supporters were one of the main opposition voices. Some fans are also alt-right and/or ultra-nationalist activists. Usual displays and chants centre around nationalist themes, and stadiums can also serve as a recruiting grounds for the nationalist organizations. Relationships Most sports teams in Poland have organised supporter groups who are actively in involved in either the ultras scene or the hooligan scene. All these groups in Poland have 4 types of relationships between each other which are subject to change over time. They extend to normal fans as well. * friendships - an alliance between two sets of supporters, whereby fans visit each other's matches frequently and on matches between two such sides very often there are no divisions between away and home fans but both sets of fans are in the same stand. * agreements - a provisional agreement of co-operation between two sets of fans. Usually if they last they become friendships later on. * enemies - a rival team. Usually a rival of a friend is also their rival. * hatred - a hatred between two rival teams. Often the hatred is so intense, it results in violence. * neutral - there is no specific antipathy or sympathy towards each other. These relationships can be complicated and change over time. Although hooligans of two neutral teams may sometime fight each other, they would usually focus on fighting with their \\"enemy\\" clubs and supporting their \\"allies\\" in fighting their \\"friends\\" \\"enemies\\".

History The home was founded in 1865 by Governor of Indiana Oliver Morton and others and was for veterans of the American Civil War. Two years later, it came under the control of the State of Indiana and was known under a variety of names, including \\"Soldiers's Orphan's Home\\", \\"Indiana Soldier's and Seamen's Home\\", \\"Indiana Soldiers' Orphans' Home\\", and Soldiers' and Sailors' Orphans' Home\\". The name was then changed in the 1929 to \\"Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Children's Home\\", which is retained until its closing in 2009. During the 1890s, due to dwindling number of Civil War orphans, the Indiana law establishing the Home was amended to admit any student who had a close relative such as a parent, aunt, uncle, or grandparent who served in the military services of the United States. The \\"Home\\", as it was called by students who attended there, was sometimes a place for \\"at-risk\\" children. It was not only for \\"at-risk\\" children; it was also a tool for young people to have freedom from independent living in a boarding school environment. There were 13 living facilities available. Students lived in divisions that had different amount of kids. The girls stayed on one side of the lake, and the boys on the other side. Students could earn money starting at the age of 14 by working in the Barn, Cafeteria, the radio station, and barber shop, among other things. The Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Children's Home was home to Morton Memorial Schools (the school was k-12 grade). Each classroom size was between 20-30 students, so the students received the individual attention needed for them to succeed. The school was on a core 40 system. The school offered vocational programs which let students study trades such as building trades, culinary art, broadcast, business and veterinarian science. Students were able to partake in JROTC. While in JROTC, students could do Raiders, Rifle team, MP Usher, and Color Guard. The graduating Class of 2007 had 25 graduating seniors, while the graduating Class of 2008 had 11 graduating seniors. Once a student graduated he or she had the option to go to any public college in Indiana, tuition free. Morton School (1928, addition 1936), McGuire and Shook architects The stated mission of ISSCH was \\"to be a safe mentoring community where Indiana's at-risk youth are given opportunities to excel\\". Endangered status In 2009, the Home's complex of buildings was listed on the Indiana Landmarks \\"10 Most Endangered\\" list due to the Home's architectural significance and the uncertainty of its future viability. The state announced that following the 2009 graduation on 23 May 2009, the Home would be closed and the remaining students dispersed to public schools.Indiana State Department of Health: Special Institutions: Indiana Soldiers' & Sailors' Children's Home \\"State To Transition Students At Indiana Soldiers‚Äô And Sailors‚Äô Children‚Äôs Home To Public Schools\\"; n.d. At the end of 2011, the entire Home complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Thirty-one of the fifty-one buildings in the complex qualified as contributing properties,Diebold, Paul, et al.

The majority of the non-contributing buildings are small semi-permanent structures; enough large historic buildings remain that the property's sense of space and place is not diminished. Closure Following a bipartisan effort to keep the Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Children's Home open, Governor Mitch Daniels closed the Home and removed it from the budget, effectively removing funding from the Home. The land was turned over to the Indiana National Guard for use as the Hoosier Youth ChalleNGe Academy (HYCA) in 2009.

The prototype for the Sports 800, called the Publica Sports, debuted at the 1962 Tokyo Auto Show, featuring a space age sliding canopy and utilizing the powertrain of the Publica 700, a Japanese market economy car. The Toyota Sports 800 is affectionately called the \\"Yota-Hachi\\" („É®„Çø„Éè„ÉÅ), which is a Japanese short form for \\"Toyota 8\\". In Japan, the vehicle was exclusive to Toyota Japan retail sales channel called Toyota Publica Store alongside the Publica.  History  The car went into production in 1965, with chassis code UP15 and an increase in engine displacement from 700 cc to 800 cc, as well as dual carburetors, which increased power from . This engine was sufficient to power the light car around town at or on a race track up to about . Production started after the introduction of Honda's first car, called the Honda S500, and joined the market segment that was already represented by the Datsun Fairlady, and the Daihatsu Compagno. Publica Sports styling prototype The car had aerodynamic styling by Shozo Sato, a designer on loan from Datsun, and Toyota engineer Tatsuo Hasegawa. Hasegawa had been an aircraft designer in World War II and the resulting Sports 800 was a lightweight and agile machine.http://members.aol.com/pinealguy/tatsuo.htm The Sports 800 was one of the first production cars featuring a lift-out roof panel, or targa top, pre- dating the Porsche Targa. The aluminum targa top could be stored in the trunk, when not in use. Between 1965 and 1969 approximately 3,131 units were built by Toyota subcontractor Kanto Auto Works. Only about 10% of those vehicles are known to have survived, most being in Japan. Production tables show 1,235 cars manufactured in 1965, 703 in 1966, 538 in 1967, 440 in 1968, and 215 in 1969. A 1967 Toyota Sports 800 in left-hand drive configuration Rear view of 1965 Sports 800 with roof panel removed The vast majority of the 3,131 cars were right hand drive, but some 300 were left hand drive models, built primarily for the Okinawa market (Okinawa, having been American occupied, drove on the right side of the road instead of the left like the rest of Japan). A very limited number of left hand drive cars were used by Toyota to \\"test drive\\" in the US, but the American dealerships decided the 800 would not sell well in the US and made a decision not to import or sell the cars in the US market. Toyota let these dealers keep the original batch of around 40 Sports 800s in the US instead of having them shipped back to Japan. There are subtle design differences between the years. Noticeable differences have included: change over from non-synchro to synchro first gear in 1967; a grill and bumperette change in 1968; and side marker lights in 1969. The basic body design, however, remained unchanged. An air-cooled 790 cc horizontally opposed two- cylinder boxer engine powered the vehicle. The 0.8 liter 2U (45 PS at 5,400 rpm) was produced from 1965 through 1969, while a similar 2U-B was produced from 1966 through 1976 (in 1975 the Dyna Coaster Bus manual shows that Toyota used the 2U-B as a separate auxiliary engine, just to run the air conditioning unit for the bus). In a less tuned form, the 2U was also used in the Publica (UP20/UP26) and MiniAce (UP100). Weight was kept down by using aluminum on selected body panels and thin steel on the unibody construction. For the first few years of production even the seat frames were made of aluminum. Toyota Sports 800 EV Twin Toyota produced a one-off prototype Sports 800 Gas Turbine Hybrid for the 1979 Tokyo Motor Show. The body of the Sports 800 also served as basis of the Sports EV and Sports EV Twin electric concept cars, both unveiled in 2010.

Hepburn House is a historic house and National Historic Landmark in Clarinda, Iowa. It was home to United States Congressman William P. Hepburn (1833‚Äì1916) from about 1867 until his death. Hepburn most significantly introduced the Hepburn Act of 1906, which gave the Federal government the power to set railroad rates, and was an important precedent in Federal regulation of private industry. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. and It is a private residence, not generally open to the public. Description and history The Hepburn house is located in a residential area west of downtown Clarinda, at the northeast corner of West Lincoln and North 19th Streets. The house stands at the top of a rise from which Hepburn would have had a view of the city's downtown, but it is now hemmed in by trees and residential development. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, roughly L-shaped, with a cross-gable roof, clapboard siding, and a brick foundation. Extending north along the eastern facade (the main facade of the building) is a flat-roof veranda, and there is a mansard- roofed tower located at the crook of the L. The house was from 1867 until his death in 1916 the primary residence of William P. Hepburn, and the best- preserved of two residences associated with his political life (the other is a townhouse in Washington, DC). Hepburn, trained as a lawyer and a veteran of the American Civil War, served as member of the United States House of Representatives 1880‚Äì1886 and 1892‚Äì1908. During the second period he chaired the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, and was instrumental in the passage of what became known as the Hepburn Act, groundbreaking legislation that greatly expanded the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission, especially with regard to railroad rates and fiscal oversight. He also played an important role in authorizing construction of the Panama Canal, and sought to curb the power of the Speaker of the House Joseph G. Cannon.

This model was developed to better approximate basalt petrogenesis in modeling and experiments. It usually involves polybaric near-fractional melting (e.g., constant intergranular porosity in the rock during melting and/or reactive porous flow in melt extraction) along an adiabatic path. In practice, petrologic models employ advanced forms of the polybaric concept for greater physical plausibility. Such models incorporate interconnected porosity to facilitate buoyant flow of liquids from lherzolitic or harzburgitic assemblages, such as replacive dunite formation in migration channels. The porosity has to consist of at least two or a continuum of size scales to account for U-series disequilibria and major/trace element chemistry of abyssal peridotites. The realization that polybaric near-fractional melting may be the dominant form of basalt petrogenesis was a consequence of difficulties with a simpler paradigm involving only a chemically distinct primary melt, in equilibrium with residual mantle minerals, undergoing fractionation (and transportation) to yield basaltic and Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt (MORB) lava. The assumption of a unique primary melt led to the expectation that chemical and mineral characterization of primitive glasses associated with a basalt would constrain the residual mantle mineral assemblage, temperature, and pressure of the (presumed) primary melt. However, such \\"inverse\\" modeling as well as \\"forward\\" peridotite melting experiments failed to fully constrain underlying processes, necessitating the use of polybaric near-fractional melting. It is possible to incorporate polybaric near-fractional melting considerations into predictive algorithms such as pMELTS and MAGPOX.

It is located on the College of Saint Elizabeth campus in nearby Florham Park, New Jersey. The company employs more than 250 members during the season and through its Main Stage, Outdoor Stage, and touring productions plays to approximately 100,000 audience members each year, primarily from the New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania region. Financial support comes from more than 1,500 individuals, government agencies, corporations and foundations. History The Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey began as the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival, a small summer-stock company in the resort town of Cape May, N.J. In 1963, the Cape May Playhouse hired veteran actor and director Paul Barry to the position of Artistic Director. Mr. Barry led the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival for 28 years. With the help and encouragement of Dr. Robert F. Oxnam, President of Drew University (1961-1974), the Festival relocated to a permanent home on the campus of Drew University in 1972. Productions were staged in the University's Bowne Gymnasium, which had, several years earlier, been converted into a performance space. In October 1990, the Board hired Bonnie J. Monte to take the helm as Artistic Director. Monte had served as the Associate Artistic Director at Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts under Nikos Psacharopoulos from 1981 to 1989 and was one of the casting associates at the Manhattan Theatre Club from 1989 to 1990. Monte, along with former Managing Director Michael Stotts, revitalized the company and spearheaded the complete renovation of the old Bowne Gymnasium. In June 1998, The F.M. Kirby Shakespeare Theatre, a state-of-the-art 308-seat performance space, officially opened. The new Kirby Theatre allowed for a significant expansion of the performance season into the fall and early winter months. The company now produces six to seven Main Stage shows each year. In 2003, the company renamed itself The Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey, providing a clearer identity. =Production history= The Shakespeare Theatre's production history from 2000 to the present. 2012 Season - The 50th Anniversary Henry IV, Part One, by William Shakespeare The Liar by David Ives, adapted from the comedy by Pierre Corneille Measure for Measure by William Shakespeare Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist adapted by Neil Bartlett Man of La Mancha by Dale Wasserman, lyrics by Joe Darion, music by Mitch Leigh Trelawny of the Wells by Arthur Wing Pinero ON THE OUTDOOR STAGE: Comedy Of Errors by William Shakespeare 2013 Season The Playboy of the Western World by J.M.

Kirby Shakespeare Theatre= In late 1990, the need to secure a viable and lasting home for the company was recognized. The 88-year-old Bowne Theatre had become a serious impediment to artistic and organizational success. Recognizing also the immense benefits of a partnership between a professional arts institution and an academic institution of higher education, The Shakespeare Theatre management and Board set out to create a lasting and solid partnership with Drew University. After a successful $7.5 million capital campaign, in June 1998, the Theatre raised the curtain on its 36th season in the F.M. Kirby Shakespeare Theatre at Drew University, on the site of the old Bowne Gymnasium. The Theatre includes three levels (approximately 22,000 square feet), all of which are fully accessible to people with disabilities‚Äîboth audiences and Theatre employees alike. There are two entrances to the building, both of which are ramped for people using wheelchairs, and elevators offer access to all public spaces. A second elevator has been installed just off stage left, providing access to the green room and the dressing rooms. A total of six wheelchair positions are available in the Theatre, and Braille signage appears throughout the building wherever public signs are posted. F. M.

The productions are dynamic and appealing, exciting and engaging, witty and imaginative‚Äîgiving students of all ages the opportunity to experience Shakespeare's works as the playwright intended‚Äîin performance. Shakespeare LIVE! is supported by Shakespeare in American Communities: Shakespeare for a New Generation, a national program of The National Endowment for the Arts in cooperation with Arts Midwest.http://www.shakespeareinamericancommunities.org/theater-companies/the- shakespeare-theatre-of-new-jersey The Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey is one of 42 professional theater companies selected to participate in Shakespeare for a New Generation, bringing the finest productions of Shakespeare to thousands of middle- and high-school students in communities across the United States. =Summer Professional Training Program= Acting Apprentice Company The Apprentice Company is designed for aspiring young actors in the early stages of training with little or no professional experience. While a variety of classes are offered, the primary focus of the training is on Shakespeare and other classic works. Intern Company The Intern Company is designed for college students and early-career theatre professionals interested in specific fields other than acting. Interns work in one department for the duration of the training program, under the direction of The Shakespeare Theatre's professional staff. Some prior experience in the field of interest is necessary for most internships. Next Stage Ensemble The Next Stage Ensemble fosters the work of early career actors and provides training in ensemble-based performance techniques. Participants work with The Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey resident directors and guest directors on fully developed productions of abridged classics and tour to over 30 locations throughout the region - including libraries, retirement homes, and community centers. The plays are rehearsed and performed in repertory. =The Shakespeare Theatre Academy= Introduced in the spring of 2013, The Shakespeare Theatre Academy offers youth and adult classes in a wide range of disciplines connected with classic theatre as well as weekend intensives on the art of auditioning. =Pages to Players: In-School Residencies= Focusing primarily on students in grades 5-8, the Pages to Players program utilizes the students' energy and emerging language skills to bring Shakespeare's texts to life. These residencies take place during regular English/Language Arts class periods and often involve one or more entire grade levels at the school. Students work with Shakespeare Theatre teaching artists who lead the residency activities. Because these residencies are based in the English classroom, the primary focus is on using performance and the theatrical tradition as tools for achieving greater proficiency and pleasure in the study of the English language generally, and Shakespeare in particular. Students are also introduced to many of the fundamental exercises utilized by theatre artists, such as ensemble-building techniques, vocal projection, diction, focus and memory systems, and others which can have a lifelong impact. Other education programs include: the Lend Us Your Ears play reading series, the Symposium post-performance lecture series, the Know The Show pre-performance discussion series, ShakeFest, Shakesperience, LIVE! at The Kirby, and the Student Matinee performances.

His league and championship career with the Tipperary senior team spanned fifteen seasons from 1951 to 1966. Born in Holycross, County Tipperary, Maher was born into a strong hurling family. His uncle, Mikey Maher, was a five-time All-Ireland medal winner with Tipperary between 1895 and 1900, while his cousin, Sonny Maher, won three successive All-Ireland medals between 1949 and 1951. Maher played competitive hurling during his secondary education at Thurles CBS. He later joined the Holycross-Ballycahill team, winning his first senior county championship medal as an eighteen-year- old in 1948. Maher added two more championship medals to his collection in 1951 and 1954. Maher made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he was selected for the Tipperary minor team. He enjoyed two championship seasons with the minor team, winning an All-Ireland medal in his debut season in 1947. He made his senior debut during the 1951-52 league. Over the course of the next fifteen seasons, Maher won five All-Ireland medals, beginning with a lone triumph in 1958, back-to-back championships in 1961 and 1962 and another two championships in-a-row in 1964 and 1965. He also won six Munster medals and eight National Hurling League medals. He played his last game for Tipperary in June 1966. After being chosen on the Munster inter- provincial team for the first time in 1958, Maher was an automatic choice on the starting fifteen for the following few years. During that time he won four Railway Cup medals. Playing career =Club= Maher played his club hurling with Holycross-Ballycahill and enjoyed much success in a career that spanned three decades. In 1948 he played in his first championship decider with Lorrha providing the opposition. Corner-back John Doyle was singled out for particular praise while Philip Maher at centre-forward had the game of his life. After leading at half-time, Holycross took complete control in the second half and powered to a 4-10 to 2-4 victory. It was Maher's first championship medal. After failing to reach the same heights over the following two seasons, Holycross-Ballycahill reached the championship decider again in 1951. Clonoulty-Rossmore provided little opposition and Maher collected a second championship medal following a 5-15 to 1-4 trouncing. Maher's team failed to retain their title once again, and it was 1954 before the team reached another championship decider. A comprehensive 6-5 to 2-3 defeat of Roscrea gave Maher his third and final championship medal. =Inter-county= Minor Maher first lined out for Tipperary in the minor grade in 1947. After missing the team's provincial final triumph over Waterford, he again started the subsequent All-Ireland decider against Galway as a substitute. Maher was introduced to the field of play midway through the match and collected an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal following a 9-5 to 1-5 trouncing. Senior =Beginnings= Maher joined the Tipperary senior panel during the 1951-52 league campaign. He won his first National Hurling League medal that year as New York were bested on a 6-14 to 2-5 score line. Over the next few years Maher became a regular member of the Tipperary team for league games, however, he had yet to enjoy a run in the championship. In spite of this, he added two more National League medals to his collection following defeats of Wexford in 1955 and Kilkenny in 1957. By this stage Maher had made his senior championship debut on 1 July 1956 in a 2-7 to 1-11 Munster semi-final defeat by Cork. =First All-Ireland= In 1958 Maher won his first Munster medal following a 4-12 to 1-5 trouncing of reigning champions Waterford. Tipp later defeated Kilkenny in the All-Ireland semi-final before lining out against Galway in the All-Ireland decider on 7 September 1958. Galway got a bye into the final without picking up a hurley. Liam Devaney, Donie Nealon and Larry Keane all scored goals for Tipperary in the first-half, while Tony Wall sent a seventy-yard free untouched to the Galway net. Tipperary won the game by 4-9 to 2-5 giving Maher his first All-Ireland medal. Maher won his fourth National League medal in 1959 following a 0-15 to 0-7 defeat of Waterford, however, Tipperary subsequently surrendered their provincial and All-Ireland crowns. Tipperary asserted their dominance in 1960 by retaining the National League title with a 2-15 to 3-8 defeat of Cork. It was Maher's fifth winners' medal in that competition. He later won a second Munster medal following a narrow 4-13 to 4-11 defeat of Cork in what has been described as the toughest game of hurling ever played. This victory allowed Tipperary to advance directly to an All-Ireland final meeting with Wexford on 4 September 1960. A certain amount of over-confidence was obvious in the Tipperary camp, particularly in trainer Phil Purcell's comment that no player was capable of marking star forward Jimmy Doyle. The game ended in remarkable circumstances as the crowd invaded the pitch with a minute to go, mistaking the referee's whistle for the end of the game. When the crowd were finally moved off the pitch Tipperary continued playing with only twelve men, but Wexford won on a score line of 2-15 to 0-11. It was Maher's first All-Ireland defeat. =Total dominance= 1961 saw Maher collect a sixth National League medal following a 6-6 to 4-9 defeat of Waterford. He later added a third Munster medal to his collection, as old rivals Cork were downed by 3-6 to 0-7. The absence of the All-Ireland semi-final allowed Tipperary to advance directly to the final itself, with Dublin's first native hurling team providing the opposition on 3 September 1961. The game was a close run thing, however, Tipperary held on to win by 0-16 to 1-12. It was Maher's second All- Ireland medal. In 1962 Tipperary were still the kingpins of Munster. A 5-14 to 2-3 trouncing of Waterford in the decider gave Maher a fourth Munster medal. Tipperary's nemesis of two years earlier, Wexford, waited in Croke Park to test them once again in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 2 September 1962. Wexford, however, were not the force of old and the side got off to possibly the worst start ever by a team in a championship decider. After just ninety seconds the Leinster champions were down by two goals, however, the game turned out to be much closer than people expected. Tipperary eventually secured the win on a score line of 3-10 to 2-11, giving Maher a third All- Ireland medal. After losing the following year's Munster final to Waterford in one of the hurling shocks of the decade, Tipperary bounced back in 1964 with Maher collecting a seventh National League medal. Tipperary later cantered casually past Cork by fourteen points in the provincial decider, giving Maher a fifth Munster medal. The All-Ireland final on 6 September 1964 saw Kilkenny enter the game as firm favourites against Tipperary. John \\"Mackey\\" McKenna scored Tipp's first goal after ten minutes as the Munster champions took a 1-8 to 0-6 interval lead. The second half saw Tipperary score goals for fun, with Donie Nealon getting a hat-trick and Se√°n McLoughlin another. Kilkenny were humiliated at the full-time whistle as Tipperary triumphed by 5-13 to 2-8. It was Maher's fourth All-Ireland medal. In 1965 Maher won an eighth and final National League medal as New York were narrowly defeated on an aggregate score of 6-19 to 5-20. Tipperary demolished all opposition in the provincial championship once again and a 4-11 to 0-5 trouncing of Cork gave Maher a sixth Munster medal. Wexford were Tipperary's opponents in the subsequent All- Ireland final on 5 September 1965, however, the game failed to live up to the two classic games between the two sides in 1960 and 1962. Victory went to Tipperary on that occasion by 2-16 to 0-10, courtesy of a brace of goals by Se√°n McLoughlin. The win gave Maher a fifth All-Ireland medal. =Retirement= Maher played his last game for Tipperary on 1 June 1966 in a shock 2-9 to 4-12 defeat by Limerick. After retiring as a player, Maher became the Tipperary County Board chairman and later a selector with the senior Tipperary hurling team in the 1980-81 season. =Inter-provincial= Maher was first picked for the Munster inter-provincial team in 1958. He won his first Railway Cup medal that year following a 3-7 to 3-5 final defeat of Leinster. Maher was once again included on the provincial team in 1959. A 7-11 to 2-6 trouncing of Connacht gave him a second Railway Cup medal as Munster retained their crown. After a one-year absence Maher won his third Railway Cup medal in 1961 as Leinster were downed by 4-12 to 3-9. He won his fourth and final Railway Cup medal in 1963 following a narrow 2-8 to 2-7 defeat of Leinster. Death On 8 March 2017, Maher died at the age of 87 after a long illness.

In the Museum is a full-size, painted copy of this portrait, the original of which is in the Cornell University Library. The Prudence Crandall Museum is a historic house museum, sometimes called the Elisha Payne House for its previous owner. It is located on the southwest corner of the junction of Connecticut Routes 14 and 169, on the Canterbury, Connecticut village green. It is designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark as Prudence Crandall House. The Canterbury Female Boarding School The house is notable for having been the site of Prudence Crandall's Canterbury Female Boarding School. The house was empty and for sale in 1831, and Crandall purchased the house for a $500 down payment plus a $1500 mortgage. The school operated from 1831 to 1833 for white students, but the admission of one black student, by all reports highly qualified, caused parents of the white students to withdraw their daughters, threatening the school's survival. Crandall closed the school and reopened it in 1833 for African-American students, whom she called \\"young Ladies and little Misses of color\\". The school was vigorously opposed by the residents of Canterbury, who feared an African-American migration. When their attempts to close it through legal methods were not immediately successful, they resorted to violence, forcing Crandall to close the school in 1834 out of concern for the students' safety. Crandall left Connecticut, never to return. For her vision and brave actions at this school, Prudence Crandall is Connecticut's official state heroine. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1991. Construction and architecture Hipped roof, with higher, set-back end gable barely visible behind obscuring tree branches, leading to chimney. Note corner pilasters. Interior, in 1940 The house was built in 1805, and \\"is a notable example of what has been termed the 'Canterbury type' because of several similar examples in the vicinity. It shows the peculiar roof form of gable on hip with twin chimneys, a triangular pediment at the eaves above a projecting pavilion at center of the facade, which carries a Palladian window lighting the stair hall at second floor level and an elaborate entrance doorway.\\" Projecting pavilion including front doorway, flanked by large pilasters, and 2nd story Palladian window with small pilasters, in 1940 The main cornice around the entire house includes modillion blocks just above a Greek fret. The two front corners of the house sport \\"fluted pilasters on high bases\\", which \\"also flank the central pavilion, framing also in miniature the elements of the Palladian window, which exhibits keystone arches and Gothic arch muntins in the large section.\\" The Gothic pattern is \\"repeated in the lunette occupying the tympanum of the roof-line pediment above, which also has modillions and Greek fret under the raking cornice.\\" The Palladian window is the combination window on the 2nd story, including a central large window with over-window plus two narrow side windows, separated by pilasters. The foundation is of dressed stone blocks. Inside, the ornamental fireplace mantel is original, as is the stairway and almost all moldings and other interior elements. Preservation Mantel, in 1940 The house was surveyed in 1940 by the Historic American Buildings Survey, which termed it the \\"Elisha Payne House\\" and also the \\"Prudence Crandall School for Negro Girls\\", a name the school never had when open. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. The house was studied in depth in 1981. The study \\"concluded that there had been only minor changes to the house since the occupancy of Prudence Crandall and that approximately 95% of the structure is unaltered.\\" The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1991. and It is located within the Canterbury Center Historic District, another listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The house is a museum and includes period rooms, changing exhibits, a small research library (available for in- house study) and a gift shop.

The shoes in playful colors and designs are featured on the company's web site.  History  In the 1930s Thomas Bata came to Hungary to open a shoe factory somewhere in the country. During a journey he visited Martf≈± where the railway, public and water traffic meet and he found it suitable for the Tisza Cip≈ë factory. He bought the parcel in 1939, which was 593 cadastral hold, and he paid 325000 peng≈ë for it. The construction begun and the Cikta Rt., which was the former name of the shoe factory, started the production of loungers in 1942. During the Second World War many things changed in the factory, directors of the factory frequently alternated, however; the Shoe factory never shut down. After the war, the factory suffered many losses, for instance; wooden treaded shoes were manufactured instead of the rubber ones. In August 1949, The Cikta Rt. was renamed to Tisza Cip≈ë Nemzeti V√°llalat (Tisza Shoe National Corporation). During the 1950s and 1960s, the factory produced shoes for the inner market and exported only to socialist countries. At these times, they produced a large quantity of boots for the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Defense and the Civil Guard. In December 1970, The Tisza Shoe Factory wanted a new logo instead of their old one and then they put in the application for the authorisation of their new logo, which they obtained in the first months of 1971. Finally, the Tisza company started to produce sport shoes, which very soon became one of the favourite shoes of the youth. Many facts show us that the production of sport shoes was a very good decision. For instance, from May 1971 the German Adidas manufactured its football shoes called La Paz in the Tisza factory. From the beginning of the 1970s many new models came to light, some of them were very similar to today's old school type of shoes. One of the first shoes, which the Tisza Factory produced, was a rubber sole - vulcanized - gym shoes which were manufactured in many colours. The variety of sport shoes is widened and besides the normal shoes long legged style shoes were produced and also different shoes were produced leather and linen for different sport activities. At that time the Tisza factory was the biggest shoe factory in Hungary- where not only shoes were manufactured but other factories rubber soles. They produced 10,000,000 pairs of shoes annually and 3,000,000 of them were gym shoes. Besides the quantity the factory took care of the quality. In July 1970, the gym shoes which sole were made of PVC won the excellent product prize. At the 1976 Budapest International Fair, the Tisza leisure shoe family won the Fair's prize. 1976 brought several international successes for the Tisza Cip≈ë factory. For instance, the French ADIDAS signed a multi-year contract with them and the factory's production appeared on the English market. At the same year an agreement was made on the first American export where not only casual shoes were ordered but 50 thousands sport shoes. Tisza shoe company also produced 2 million pair of shoes for the socialist market. In the 1970s the Tisza shoe company's products reached the Kuwait's and Liberia's markets. 1976 brought further development. In the 1990s, the import increased and more and more brands could get into the domestic market. Until the middle of the 1990s, the Tisza Shoe factory made sport shoes and after that, it started manufacturing street shoes for women, men and children. From the summer of 2003 the Tisza company has again started to produce sport shoes. Besides the old models, they produce new ones. Clash Kft In 2003, The Clash Kft has bought the rights of the usage of the Tisza trademark. This means that Clash company can use Tisza as a trademark and shoes can be produced anywhere, not just in the traditional Tisza Shoe Factory in Martf≈±. Nowadays we have three places where Tisza shoes are produced and six shops where customers can buy them. The Clash company also wants to have Tisza trademark to remain pure Hungarian, therefore, the shoes are produced only in Hungary although the cost of production is very expensive. The marketing aim of the Clash Kft. is a long-live company, in order to achieve this they have worked out a special marketing plan; the expansion of the company is very slow and the profit of which the company gathers a year is given back to its origin, to develop the company. The Clash Kft also makes clothes and accessories. The idea of the whole business came from a young, talented, Hungarian man, L√°szl√≥ Vid√°k, who was also an importer of a very popular shoe in Hungary a couple of years ago. Clash Kft and The Tisza Shoe In May 2009 the original Tisza Company in Martf≈± went bankrupt; from the 102 employees 85 quit. But the Clash Kft continues to make the Tisza Shoe.

Competency was originally established by the Supreme Court of the United States as the evaluation of a defendant's competence to proceed to trial. In a subsequent ruling, the Court held that any prisoner facing the death penalty must be evaluated as competent to be executed, meaning that he must be capable of understanding why he has received the death penalty and the effect that the penalty will have. In further rulings, competence was also enlarged to include evaluation of the defendant's competence to plead guilty and competence to waive the right to counsel. The American Bar Association's Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards stated in 1994 that the issue of a defendant's current mental incompetence is the single most important issue in the criminal mental health field, noting that an estimated 24,000 to 60,000 forensic evaluations of a criminal defendant's competency to stand trial were performed every year in the United States. A 1973 estimate put the number of competence evaluations at 25,000 to 36,000 each year. There are indications that the number of evaluations of criminal defendants is rising. One comparison of estimates between 1983 and 2004 suggest the annual number rose from 50,000 to 60,000 criminal competency evaluations respectively. Competence to proceed This standard is based on the Supreme Court decision Dusky v. United States in which the Court affirmed a defendant's right to have a competency evaluation before proceeding to trial. Competence to proceed was defined by the court as the defendant's ability to consult rationally with an attorney to aid in his own defense and to have a rational and factual understanding of the charges. In this case Dusky presented a petition of writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court requesting that his conviction be reversed on the grounds that he was not competent to stand trial at the time of the proceeding. The court decided to grant the writ, based on a lack of recent evidence that the petitioner was competent at the time of the trial. The case was remanded to the district court for a new hearing to evaluate Dusky's competence to stand trial, and for a new trial if he was found competent. The case set the current standard for adjudicative competency in the United States. Although the statutes addressing competency vary from state to state in the United States, the two elements outlined in the Dusky v. United States decision are held in common. The defendant must understand the charges and have the ability to aid his attorney in his own defense. Competency to stand trial is generally determined via a pretrial evaluation of the defendant's overall mental status and mental state at the time of the examination. This evaluation aims to provide sufficient information to allow a judge to rule on the competency of the defendant should a motion to that effect be made by either the prosecutor or defense attorney. A judge may also directly rule a defendant incompetent to stand trial without receiving a motion to that effect from counsel. Who is deemed qualified to conduct a competency evaluation varies from state to state. Originally competency evaluations included a range of tests and assessments. Recently the tendency is to simplify the process by relying upon an interview and, optionally, a psychological evaluation. There are a number of standardized screening devices that also may be employed. A defendant who has been deemed incompetent to stand trial may be required to undergo mental health treatment, including court-ordered hospitalization and the administration of treatment against the defendant's wishes, in an effort to render the defendant competent to stand trial. Competence to be executed An additional evaluation is of the competence to be executed, that is the defendant must be capable of understanding why he is being executed and the effect execution will have. The right to be competent to be executed resulted from the outcome of a United States Supreme Court case, Ford v. Wainwright, in which a Florida inmate on death row took his case to the United States Supreme Court, declaring he was not competent to be executed. He had been evaluated as incompetent but the Governor of Florida made an executive branch decision and signed the death warrant anyway. The court ruled that a forensic professional must make that evaluation and, if the inmate is found incompetent, provide treatment to aid in the inmate gaining competency in order that the execution can take place. Providing treatment to an individual to enable that person to become competent to be executed places mental health professionals in an ethical dilemma. The National Medical Association takes the position that ethically it is a physician's duty to provide treatment, regardless of the patient's legal situation. Others feel that it is unethical to treat a person in order to execute them. Most restorations of competency are accomplished through psychiatric medication. Competence to plead guilty It has been estimated that approximately 90 percent of all criminal cases in the United States are settled through guilty pleas, rather than a trial. In Godinez v. Moran, 1993, the Supreme Court held that the competency standard for pleading guilty or waiving the right to counsel is the same as the competency standard for proceeding to trial as established in Dusky v. United States. A higher standard of competency is not required. Feigning incompetence In United States v. Binion malingering or feigning illness during a competency evaluation was held to be obstruction of justice and led to an increased sentence. Waiver of challenge to competency to stand trial Where a defendant does not raise the issue of mental competence before trial, the issue of competence may be deemed waived in the event of a conviction and appeal. For example, in United States v. MorinUnited States v. Morin 338 F.3d 838 (8th Cir. 2003) the United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit upheld the defendant's conviction. The court rejected Mr. Morin‚Äôs argument, among others, that the district court violated his due process rights by refusing to allow him to waive competency at trial. The court held that since his competency to stand trial was never challenged, the issue of whether he was entitled to waive competency to stand trial was properly not considered. Common principles Although Dusky v. United States affirmed the right to a competency evaluation, the specifics of the evaluation remain ambiguous. Each evaluator must decide what is meant by \\"sufficient present ability\\" and \\"has a rational as well as a factual understanding\\" as set forth in the Dusky decision. One common principle is clear in forensic evaluations, however. Forensic evaluators cannot reach a finding independent of the facts of the case at hand. Notable cases In 1989, Kenneth Curtis of Stratford, Connecticut was initially found mentally incompetent to stand trial following the murder of his estranged girlfriend. But years later, as he had attended college and received good grades, this ruling was reversed, and he was ordered to stand trial. Some other notable cases include: *Frendak v. United States *Estelle v.

It was discovered on 3 October 1929, by Soviet astronomer Grigory Neujmin at the Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula. The X-type asteroid has a rotation period of hours 23.5 and measures approximately in diameter. It was named for the ancient Kingdom of Colchis.  Orbit and classification  Colchis is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. It orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.4‚Äì3.0 AU once every 4 years and 4 months (1,589 days; semi-major axis 2.67 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.12 and an inclination of 5¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed as at Johannesburg Observatory in June 1911. The body's observation arc begins at Lowell Observatory in September 1929, or four days prior its official discovery observation at Simeiz.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the ancient Kingdom of Colchis, bordering on Black Sea south of the Caucasus mountains, in what is now part of Georgia. The was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().  Physical characteristics  In the SMASS classification, Colchis is a Xk-subtype that transitions between the X- and K-type asteroids. Conversely, the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer characterizes it as a primitive P-type asteroid. = Rotation period = In March 2001, a rotational lightcurve of Colchis was obtained from photometric observations by Robert Stephens. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 23.47 hours with a brightness variation of 0.45 magnitude (). In September 2016, French amateur astronomer Patrick Sogorb measured an identical period and an amplitude of 0.46 magnitude (). A similar period of 23.41 hours with an amplitude of 0.33 magnitude was obtained by astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory in January 2014. = Poles = In 2016, two modeled lightcurves using photometric data from the Lowell Photometric Database (LPD) and other sources, gave a concurring period of 23.4827 and 23.4830 hours, respectively. Each modeled lightcurve also determined two spin axis of (139.0¬∞, ‚àí58.0¬∞) and (330.0¬∞, ‚àí81.0¬∞), as well as (7.0¬∞, ‚àí54.0¬∞) and (168.0¬∞, ‚àí56.0¬∞) in ecliptic coordinates (Œª, Œ≤), respectively. = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's WISE telescope, Colchis measures between 45.341 and 50.64 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.05 and 0.068. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0437 and a diameter of 50.50 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.5.

Note the entrance stone with its circular hole. The Z√ºschen tomb (, sometimes also Lohne-Z√ºschen) is a prehistoric burial monument, located between Lohne and Z√ºschen, near Fritzlar, Hesse, Germany. Classified as a gallery grave or a Hessian-Westphalian stone cist (hessisch-westf√§lische Steinkiste), it is one of the most important megalithic monuments in Central Europe. Dating to the late 4th millennium BC (and possibly remaining in use until the early 3rd), it belongs to the Late Neolithic Wartberg culture. The presence of incised carvings, comparable to prehistoric rock art elsewhere in Europe, is a striking feature of Wartberg culture tombs, known so far only from Z√ºschen and from tomb I at Warburg.Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 126  Discovery and excavation  The tomb was accidentally discovered in 1894. For a number of years, a row of sandstone blocks had impeded the local miller from ploughing one of his fields. When he decided to remove them, Rudolf Gelpke, an inspector from nearby Garvensburg castle, noted the unusual presence of sandstone in the area of a basalt outcrop. On a visit to the site, he recognised it as a prehistoric monument consisting of two parallel rows of regularly shaped vertical slabs. Gelpke erroneously associated the monument with the Chatti, a local Iron Age tribe. He convinced the owner of the field to remove soil only from the ends of the row. This revealed bones and pottery sherds. At this point, Wilhelm von Garvens, owner of the Garvensburg, was notified. He, in turn, informed the antiquarian Baron Felix von und zu Gilsa. After Gilsa's scrutiny, the tomb was excavated, still in 1894, by Johannes Boehlau, former director of the State Museum at Kassel.Story of discovery from Boehlau & von Gilsa 1898 Further excavations took place in 1939 and 1949, under the direction of O. Uenze of the archaeological service of Marburg.Kappel 1990, 3  Tomb architecture  The rectangular sunken chamber is 20m long and 3.5m wide. It is built of rectangular sandstone slabs, quarried several hundred meters away. Each long wall consists of a row of 12 slabs, one of which is missing. The narrow walls consist of a single slab each.Kappel 1990, 3; Jockenh√∂vel 1990, 373 A terminal slab separates the tomb chamber proper from a small anteroom of 2.5 m length. At the centre of this slab is a perfectly circular hole, the so-called Seelenloch (German for \\"soul hole\\"), of 50 cm diameter. This is sometimes assumed to be too narrow as an entrance for the passage of human bodies, in which case it may have served as a symbolic connection between the dead within the tomb chamber and the living, assembled in the ante-room for some ritual, perhaps an offering ceremony. Whether the hole could be closed, like in some comparable tombs in France, is not known. The floor of the anteroom was of densely trampled mud. The presence of non-local stones outside the chamber suggests that it was originally covered by an artificial tumulus. It is not clear whether the chamber was roofed in stone or some other material (wood).Jockenh√∂vel 1990, 373  Human remains  The earth inside the chamber contained numerous disarticulated human bones. Although the minimum number of individuals is as low as 27, the broken and mixed state of the remains suggests severe disturbance. Thus, it is possible that the number of persons buried here was originally higher. The discovery of an Urnfield period burial above the original depositions indicates that the destruction of the grave, disturbance of its contents and removal of the roof must have taken place before the 10th/9th century BC. Charcoal and ashes were found in a number of locations, especially with human remains near the doorstone and near the southwest terminal slab. None of the human bones showed signs of burning. There was a continuous ash layer in the centre of the anteroom.Kappel 1990, 6  Grave offerings  Most finds appeared to be from the main chamber. They were probably placed there on the same occasions as the human bodies. The low number of finds may be the result of the early destruction of the tomb. More common finds included cattle bones and stone tools, including flint knives and sickle blades as well as locally typical triangular slate axes. There were at least three bone tools, namely a chisel, a point and an arrowhead. Pottery fragments were scant; they included a clay cup similar to examples from the related Lohra tomb and collared bottles connected with the northern Funnel Beaker (TRB) Culture. Such bottles appear to have served some special function, maybe the storage of vegetable oils or sulphur for healing purposes. A so-called Giant Urn belongs to the later burial.Jockenh√∂vel 1990, 373; Kappel 1990, 6; W.

One of the most striking features of the tomb is the presence of carved symbols on the slabs inside the chamber.Jockenh√∂vel 1990, 373-5, Kappel 1990, 6-7; Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 123-9 Lines are formed of rows of individual punched dots, possibly applied with a very early metal tool. One of the more common symbols is a simple line with an attached open semicircle, usually interpreted as a stylised depiction of cattle. Normally, two of these symbols are linked by a further line with emphasised terminals. This may be a simple depiction of a plough. More rarely, two of them are linked by what resembles a yoke and pole, suggesting a cart. Occasionally overlapping signs suggest that the individual carvings are in no meaningful relationship to one another, but represent an accumulation of individual signs. Similar depiction of teams of cattle are known from much more recent (Bronze or Iron Age) carvings at Valcamonica near Capo di Ponte, Northern Italy and at Mont B√©go in the French part of the Ligurian Alps.I. 1978: Steinkammergr√§ber und Menhire in Nordhessen., ed.

The symbols are normally assumed to reflect Neolithic ideological or religious ideas.Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 125 Reconstruction A reconstruction of the grave can be seen in the Hessian State Museum (Hessisches Landesmuseum) in Kassel. Relationships with other sites Like any archaeological monument, the Z√ºschen tomb should not be seen as isolated. It is in a close relationship with its landscape and with other sites in the area. Two further tombs, Z√ºschen II and Z√ºschen III are known to have existed in the area. Z√ºschen II was 150 m northwest of the main tomb, it was generally comparable, but smaller and undecorated. A third tomb, Z√ºschen III, is located further east. Less than 1 km from the Z√ºschen tomb lies the Hasenberg, a prominent basalt dome, the top of which contains an important Wartberg settlement. Intriguingly, the Z√ºschen tomb also appears to be designed in such a way that its main axis point directly at the Wartberg itself, 4 km to the east.Jockenh√∂vel 1990, 375-7 See also *Lohra (megalithic tomb) *Altendorf (megalithic tomb) *Niedertiefenbach (megalithic tomb) *Wartberg culture References  Bibliography  * Johannes Boehlau and Baron Felix von Gilsa zu Gilsa 1898: Neolithische Denkm√§ler aus Hessen.

There is a common source of all these effects‚Äîthe so-called interfacial 'double layer' of charges. Influence of an external force on the diffuse layer generates tangential motion of a fluid with respect to an adjacent charged surface. This force might be electric, pressure gradient, concentration gradient, or gravity. In addition, the moving phase might be either continuous fluid or dispersed phase. Family Various combinations of the driving force and moving phase determine various electrokinetic effects. According to J.Lyklema, the complete family of electrokinetic phenomena includes: * electrophoresis, as motion of particles under influence of electric field; * electro-osmosis, as motion of liquid in porous body under influence of electric field; * diffusiophoresis, as motion of particles under influence of a chemical potential gradient; * capillary osmosis, as motion of liquid in porous body under influence of the chemical potential gradient; * sedimentation potential, as electric field generated by sedimenting colloid particles; * streaming potential/current, as either electric potential or current generated by fluid moving through porous body, or relative to flat surface; * colloid vibration current, as electric current generated by particles moving in fluid under influence of ultrasound; * electric sonic amplitude, as ultrasound generated by colloidal particles in oscillating electric field.

It starred Saravanan, Alex, Deepan Chakravarthy, Sanjayram, Krishna, Sonika, Thaniya, Anjusha and Sudhakar Vasanth in main roles. Plot Shankar Ayya(Saravanan) is the 'godfather' of Tuticorin and the villages around it, where the Arivaal( sickle used as a weapon to kill) culture prevails. The villagers respect him because of his stature as a do- gooder and a man who helps the poor and needy. His enemies led by his cousin Semmarai Pandian, a cruel and cunning man with a nose ring (Sudhakar Vasanth) hate him due to decades old enmity between the two families. So blood flows as frequent gang wars take place, creating a law and order problem in the coastal area. The Superintendent of Police, Veerasangili (Deepan Chakravarthy) is asked by the government to sort out and stop the gang wars. Remember the earlier SP had disappeared, trying to bring the feud to an end.(actually he was chopped and his body was disposed of in the deep sea by Semmarai and his gang!) Veerasangli is a more committed man, and he tries to negotiate peace, but fails to bring Semmarai to the table, even after threatening him with encounter death. Semmarai with a pathological hatred for Shankar is obstinate that he will never allow peace as long as Shankar family holds sway, and then plays dirty. What happens next is told in a compelling and gripping manner, leading to a stunning climax.

Dixon. It was published by Wanderer Books in 1985. As of 2018 this is the last Hardy Boys book to be published by Wanderer Books.  Plot summary  Frank and Joe Hardy are on a stakeout in Okefenokee Swamp with their father Fenton, using their van of computer and surveillance equipment. Fenton is chasing industrial saboteurs who nearly kill him and Chet Morton. The head of security at Kennedy Space Center, Harry Stone, is baffled by a series of accidents involving the space shuttle Skyfire. Frank, Joe, Chet, Stone and his daughter Suzanne head to Cape Canaveral, where they meet Nat Cramer from Starglass Corporation and his security man, Pete McConnel. Starglass developed the Longeye radio telescope, which is to be placed in orbit by Skyfire. Maxwell Grant, deputy director of operations, offers the young people the chance to fly on Skyfire. Frank, Joe and Chet train for the shuttle mission and help Stone and his aide, Lew Gorman, investigate the accidents. Occurrences indicate that someone wants the Hardys off the case: Fenton is attacked by gunmen; a masked man makes a centrifuge run wild with Joe; a caller summons the young people to a trap meeting; and hallucinogenic crystals are placed in Chet's air hose during neutral buoyancy training, causing him to attack Frank. McConnel is apparently shot by terrorist Franz Schacht, who is linked by a fingerprint. The day before the shuttle launch, the Hardys' van is shot at by a man whom Fenton recognizes as Stone. Evidence found in Stone's house seems to prove that he and Gorman are foreign agents; they are arrested, and Suzanne is removed from the shuttle crew. During the shuttle mission, Frank links the spacelab computer with the computer in the Hardys' van and discovers that the body profile of one of the criminals from the beach matches that of a man present during the Okefenokee attack, linking the two cases. The Hardys deduce that Cramer and McConnel are involved with the industrial espionage ring. Frank discovers McConnel never visited an emergency room after being shot. The Hardys and Chet convince the shuttle commander to fake a power failure that would strand them in orbit, tricking Cramer into making a spacewalk to send Longeye, which is set to explode, into space. Frank follows Cramer outside and frightens him into a confession. The Longeye on the shuttle is a mockup; Cramer and McConnel planned to sell the real Longeye to the spy ring. McConnel and Cramer faked Schacht's involvement, McConnel's shooting and Stone's guilt using masks of Schacht and Stone and a planted fingerprint. Notes The Skyfire Puzzle was originally advertised under the title The Mystery of the Space Shuttle.The Skyfire Puzzle, p. 160. This book, as well as #84, Revenge of the Desert Phantom, were pilots for what would become The Hardy Boys Casefiles. A third book was written in this style and was intended to be #86, but was never released due to the cancellation of the series in 1985. With the resumption of the series in 1987 #86 featured a very different writing style, and the Hardys' van, while loaded with equipment in The Skyfire Puzzle, was empty in The Mystery of the Silver Star.

The song was first recorded for Keen's 1994 album, Gringo Honeymoon. A live version also appears on his 1996, No. 2 Live Dinner. The popularity of the song led Keen to write a sequel song, \\"Happy Holidays Y'all\\", for his 1998 album Walking Distance, and to publish a book, Merry Christmas from the Family, in 2001. The original song, the book, and the sequel all center around the same cast of characters in Keen's humorous vision of a Texas style Christmas.  The song  Growing up in Houston, Texas, Robert Earl Keen didn't often see snow at Christmas time. He says \\"I didn't even know what a chestnut looked like until I was 30 years old and saw it in a picture book‚Ä¶ It was a different kind of Christmas. Every Christmas song I had ever heard didn't have a lot to do with growing up in Houston where it was most likely 85 degrees and 95 percent humidity.\\" \\"Merry Christmas from the Family\\" describes the Christmas gathering of a fairly dysfunctional Texas family whose merrymaking--which includes drinking alcohol, carving a turkey, watching a televised ball game and smoking cigarettes--seems to be punctuated with Christmas music and the need to run to convenience stores for additional supplies such as fake snow and cigarettes. Various family members and events are described throughout the verses. No one is sure how to react to a younger sister bringing her Mexican boyfriend to the party, but as soon as he sings \\"Feliz Navidad\\" he is welcomed into the fold. Brother Ken arrives with five children from two of his previous marriages. Ken's new wife, Kay, chain smokes and \\"talks all about AA.\\" Extended family also appear. Fred and Rita--whose relationship to the narrator appears to have been forgotten--arrive from Harlingen in a motor home, which when plugged in, overloads the electrical system and knocks out the family's Christmas lights. The family then waits on the front lawn and joins together in singing \\"Silent Night\\" when cousin David flips the breaker that brings the lights back on. = The \\"Linen Rule\\" = Keen calls the song the \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show of Christmas songs\\" saying that whether singing before a group of 1,000 or 6,000 the entire audience sings along. And in particular shouts out the line, \\"Mix Bloody Marys 'cause we all want one.\\" Due to the immense popularity of the song among Robert Earl Keen's fans, as well as its seasonal nature, he had to create restrictions limiting the time of year during which his band will play the song: > \\"Well, it's a real popular song with us, I have nine records out and this > song just sort of cropped up and became a real favorite and we get requests > for it all year round. So, I had to create this rule, I call it the 'Linen > Rule', where we don't play the song as long as you can wear linen. So it > saves it and makes it fresh for the holiday season.

Sequel  Keen's 1998 album, Walking Distance included a sequel, \\"Happy Holidays Y'all\\". Keen states, \\"I vowed when I really started writing songs that I'd never write a sequel. But I thought, well, you know, why not.\\" According to Keen the second song fills in some of the gaps on the characters and brings them a little farther along into their holiday celebration: \\"The song 'Merry Christmas from the Family' is set in the present tense.

He was a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 1995 to 2002.http://www.peabodyawards.com/stories/story/george-foster-peabody-awards- board-members He died in 2006 at age 71. Carey is credited with developing the ritual view of communication.  Communication As Culture (1989)  In his 1989 publication, Communication As Culture, James Carey devotes a particularly compelling chapter to a seminal analysis of the telegraph. Carey looks at the telegraph as a means of communication, analysing its historical background, as well as the social and commercial changes that it triggered. In particular, Carey focuses on the way in which the telegraph was able to separate communication and transportation,Carey, J. 1989. Communication as Culture, Routledge, New York and London, p. 203 the telegraph‚Äôs reconfiguration of time and space, and its effects on ideology and other aspects of social life. =Telegraph: Watershed In Connection= Carey's focal points in his book Communication As Culture, and more specifically Chapter 8 entitled \\"Technology and Ideology: The Case of the Telegraph\\", revolved around the telegraph and its understood role in future developments in communication. The underlining argument in his essay perceives the notion that the telegraph '...permitted for the first time the effective separation of communication from transportation...'. That is, it had become possible for the message to travel faster than people, horses or trains could deliver them', '...the telegraph not only allowed messages to be separated from the physical movement of objects; it also allowed communication to control physical processes actively...'. However, he also remarks that whilst the telegraph was a watershed in communication, it only built on previous frameworks and infrastructure such as foot paths, '...[it] twisted and altered but did not displace patterns of connection...'(p. 204). He further elaborates on the notion with an analogy of the infrastructure of telegraph wires following the physical and natural patterns of geography. The telegraph facilitated the growth of monopoly capitalism and imperialism, and to a wider extent the de- personalisation of business relations. Before the telegraph most business decisions were made 'face to face', compared with the faster, less personal service provided with its introduction. Indeed, the relationship between merchant to merchant was overnight transformed into one of buyer/seller, and one based on corporate hierarchy, i.e. management. As Chandler remarks, '...the visible hand of management replaced the invisible hand of the market forces where and when new technology...permitted high volume and speed of materials...' (1977). =Reconfiguration of Space and Time= One of the most significant effects that the telegraph had was that it was able to restructure of time and space, in relation to both social and commercial life. James Carey proficiently explores this concept throughout this chapter, detailing the ways in which the telegraph initiated changes in how one communicates across distances and over time. Carey states that the telegraph made geography irrelevant Carey, J. 1989. Communication as Culture, Routledge, New York and London, p. 217 in relation to communication. The telegraph ‚Äúallowed symbols to move independently and faster than transportation‚Äù.Carey, J. 1989. Communication as Culture, Routledge, New York and London, p. 204 James Carey focuses heavily on the significant changes that the telegraph has made to society, in relation to the diminishing constraints of space on communication. The insignificance of geography subsequently enabled communities to move away from the local and towards the national, and international or global. The telegraph allowed people from one side of the world to communicate almost instantaneously with someone on the other side of the world. Carey notes the changes that the telegraph has triggered in language and literary style. He points out that due to the cost of sending a telegraph, language and literature transformed into a more concise form. The ‚Äútelegraph made prose lean and unadorned‚Äù,Carey, J. 1989. Communication as Culture, Routledge, New York and London, p. 211 and subsequently separated the readers previously personal connection with the author. No longer, Carey notes, could personal anecdotes or humour be included. He does however mention that the decreasing relevance of space changed language for other reasons as well. Due to the beginnings of globalisation that the telegraph established, language could no longer be localised, or colloquial. As James Carey notes, the telegraph ‚Äúled to a fundamental change in news‚Äù.Carey, J. 1989. Communication as Culture, Routledge, New York and London, p. 210 Literary styles had to become objective in nature, so as it could be read by individuals of all different beliefs and opinions, as well as individuals from many different communities, regions or countries. Carey also notes how this change in the perception of space changed the way that people thought. A new social awareness was apparent, as individuals were able to easily communicate with people over vast distances, who may have very different beliefs or ways of living to their own. In this work Carey focuses more on the reconfiguration of space as opposed to time; however, he does explain that with space diminishing as an obstacle in communication, time becomes somewhat more important. The existence and use of the telegraph meant that the uncertainty of time in relation to trading, for instance, becomes more relevant than the uncertainty of space. Time was almost ‚Äòexpanded‚Äô in a way, as trading time was no longer limited to daylight hours, as one may be trading with someone in another time zone or even in a different hemisphere. According to James Carey the telegraph initiated communication changes, which reconfigured space and time. He argues this succinctly in Chapter 8 of his book.

Joseph Wresinski (1917‚Äì1988) established major landmarks throughout his life in the fight against the worst forms of poverty, in collaboration with the very poor themselves and other partners. He also developed a blueprint for a civilisation without exclusion based on his work in the field of human activity, a civilisation with the contributions of all people, and for the benefit of all. Wresinski was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1946. Consequently, in 1956, he was assigned by his bishop to be chaplain for 250 families placed in emergency housing in Noisy-le-Grand. A year later, in response to this, he founded the International Movement ATD Fourth World in 1957. He authored the report Grande pauvret√© et pr√©carit√© √©conomique et sociale (Chronic Poverty and Lack of Basic Security), which was commissioned by the French Economic and Social Council, and later adopted by this Council, of which he was a member. This report paved the way for substantial work undertaken by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, the European Union, and the Council of Europe. It also paved the way for the law against social exclusion that was adopted by France in July 1998. In 1987, Fr. Wresinski launched the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty (17 October), later recognised by the United Nations General Assembly.

Rabaskas were used by French and Canadian explorers to access the interior of North America during the 17th and 18th centuries, and by travellers and traders until the end of the 19th century. Throughout this time they were key in spreading French settlers throughout North America, adapting to their new continent and developing contact with indigenous populations. Etymology The word rabaska is a Canadianism from New France. It is derived from athapaskaw, a word common to Algonquin and Cree. This word designates the Athabasca River and its original meaning is \\"grass and reeds here and there\\". Specifications A rabaska has rather impressive dimensions: long by wide and capable of carrying ten adults with much cargo. The unladen weight of a rabasca is about . For sport and leisure, a typical crew consists of twelve rowers in six banks and a cox at the stern. A rabaska is prized for its speed and robustness, but it has a large draught. In shallow waters it is liable to grounding. To prevent damage, the bow rowers must quickly jump into the water and dislodge the craft. Past use Canoe crew passing before a waterfall (Frances Anne Hopkins, 1869) People of the First Nations used rabaskas for travel, commerce and finding new, viable sites to raise their families. Rabaskas were the vessel of choice for fur traders, because of their large cargo capacity. They also supplied the farthest outposts of the fur trade. Each spring, rabaska canoes by the dozen with experienced crews would undertake the long voyage from Lachine (near Montreal) to the Pays d'en Haut, seeking out precious furs. They would not return until autumn. The rabaska's robustness enabled exploration - and exploitation - of distant territories which were inaccessible by other means of transport. Some crews hired singers to keep stroke and increase productivity. Present use Young people in a rabaska on the Lake of Two Mountains Today, rabaskas are an outdoor leisure pursuit. The large crew and the stability of the craft allow time for breaks and sightseeing. Rabaskas are also familiar in sport, and in Quebec this is competitive: at the end of each August there is the (\\"Mauricie International Canoe Classic\\"), where all the rabaska teams can be seen. This three-day competition takes place on the Saint-Maurice River, from La Tuque downstream to Trois-Rivi√®res, nearly away.

It is 47 feet (14m) high and 1,320 feet (402.3m) wide. The waterfall is part of the five Great Falls of the Missouri.\\"Stereographic photo (of \\"Handsom Falls\\") by F. Jayne Haynes.\\" Discovering Lewis and Clark. lewis-clark.org. Accessed 12 August 2009. The river spills over a sheer ledge of sandstone in the Kootenai Formation, forming the falls. The falls used to flow with a great deal of force year- round. In 1914 the river shortly upstream was dammed for hydroelectric power by the Rainbow Dam, which forms a run-of-the-river reservoir. As a result, the falls can almost totally dry up in the summer with only a few narrow strips of water trickling down its face. A railroad bridge crosses the river directly above the falls.\\"Handsome Falls, 1902.\\" Discovering Lewis and Clark. lewis- clark.org. Accessed August 12, 2009. Description Rainbow Falls varies widely - whether it is in full flow in the spring, or greatly diminished by the autumn. In peak flow in the springtime, the falls is much like its original form - especially on the right side where the outlet works of the dam are located, and on the left side where the main spillway structure is positioned. The center section of the dam, which is also a spillway structure, only functions when the flow above the reservoir is too great. The left side of the falls is more heavily eroded than the right side, and sits a little farther upstream. Expansive and arid hills rise above the canyon on each bank. Below the falls is a long, narrow plunge pool, and a series of gravel bars. As the flow over the falls diminishes, usually from summer to early autumn, it splits into two parts hugging both banks. The flow at this point usually still extends across most (70 percent) of the full width of the river, but a section in the center remains dry except for a narrow stream of water that is found when the flow is low enough to separate it from the left-side drop, but high enough to feed it. The river below the falls remains mostly full. Much of the water is still diverted to generate power, but there is still enough water flow in the river to flow over the dam's spillways. In the autumn, however, the majority of the river is diverted through penstocks around the right side of the falls. The penstocks continue downstream past 19-ft (5m) Crooked Falls, utilizing the combined drop of over 70 ft (21m) to generate hydroelectricity through 8 turbines. The falls themselves are reduced to a mere trickle. Some water still continues down the right side of the falls through a few parallel drops, trickling out of the river outlet works. On the right, there are also two drops, each around 10 ft (3m) wide at low flow. Also, water comes out of a pipe at the left bank side of the falls, and trickles into the river in a series of small waterfalls. Upstream of Rainbow Falls lies Colter Falls and Black Eagle Falls; the former is buried under the reservoir formed by Rainbow Dam, while the latter is controlled by a dam in a similar way to Rainbow Falls. Downstream are Crooked Falls and the Grand Falls of the Missouri. Crooked Falls, as mentioned, is mostly in its natural state, except for an infill on its right side where the penstocks were constructed. Grand Falls is in a similar situation to Rainbow and Black Eagle falls. However, while Black Eagle and Grand Falls were half obliterated by the construction of power canals, Rainbow Falls remains virtually unaltered. History Rainbow Falls was first discovered by the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Rainbow Falls and downstream Crooked Falls are the only two waterfalls on the Missouri- Mississippi river system to remain in an almost-natural condition. Black Eagle Falls and Great Falls are half- occupied by their dams' powerhouses, and Colter Falls is submerged. The waterfall received its name from the frequent presence of rainbows in its spray before the dams were built. Meriwether Lewis was known to comment on the falls: The waterfall was named \\"Beautiful Cascade\\" and later \\"Handsom[e] Falls\\" by Lewis, but was given its present name by Thomas Paschall Roberts, a railroad engineer, in 1872.

Cotillion Hall was built in 1914 as a ballroom, and dance revivals were held there through the Great Depression. Starting in the 1960s, the hall has also been host to many popular pop, rock, folk, blues and jazz artists, as well as beat poetry and other entertainment. History Entrance to the building What is now known as the Crystal Ballroom was constructed in 1913‚Äì1914 and opened in early 1914, as Ringler's Cotillion Hall. Originally owned by Montrose Ringler, the ballroom fell victim to heavy persecution of jazz and dance and Ringler lost the ballroom in the early 1920s. The ballroom was bought by Dad Watson in the mid-1920s, and largely held square dances during that period. After Watson's death in the 1930s, Ralph Farrier bought the ballroom and renamed it the Crystal Ballroom. He continued in Watson's footsteps, holding square dances through the 1950s. In the early 1960s, due to flagging revenues, new acts were brought in, such as gypsy brass bands and R&B; performers, such as James Brown, Marvin Gaye, and Ike & Tina Turner. In 1967, largely psychedelic acts such as the Grateful Dead, Blue Cheer, and The Electric Prunes performed in the ballroom. This was cut short in 1968, due to concerns about what such music was doing to the youth of Portland. Portion of north fa√ßade, 2010 From the 1970s through the mid-1990s, the ballroom was not used for any public events. It became a residence for squatters, artists and bohemians, who used it as studio space, and occasionally private invite-only parties were given. In 1979, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Cotillion Hall. In 1997, the ballroom was re-opened by McMenamins, featuring a bar/restaurant on the first floor, a brewery and a new dance floor on the second floor, and the restored main ballroom on the third floor. The main ballroom features a mechanical \\"floating\\" dance floor, thought at the time of its building to be the only one on the West Coast, and is potentially the only one still in existence in the United States. Following the reopening of the Crystal Ballroom in 1997, McMenamins expanded the nearby Crystal Hotel to reflect the historical significance of the Ballroom's memorable performances. The fifty- one guest rooms at the Crystal Hotel are named after songs or performances from the Crystal Ballroom's last one hundred years. The hotel also offers pre- and post-show concerts in conjunction with the Ballroom. In 2000 or 2001 a large 20'x20' square opening was cut into the center/middle edge of the main ballroom floor to make additional fire exits in order to sell more tickets for live music events. This is potentially the only hole of its kind in a \\"floating\\" dance floor still in existence in the United States. There are ballroom dance lessons each Sunday available to the public. During the early hours of April 14, 2014, the ballroom was evacuated during a show by Schoolboy Q due to a possible crack in a support beam. Oregon bands that have played at the Crystal Ballroom include Portland's Everclear in '01, Cherry Poppin Daddies in '02, Portland's The Decemberists in '14, Modest Mouse (originally from Seattle) in '04, The Shins (originally from New Mexico) in '05, and Portugal. The Man (originally from Alaska) in 2017. =Urban legend concerning Jimi Hendrix= An urban legend in the Portland area purports that on April 5, 1965, Little Richard fired guitarist Jimi Hendrix onstage during a concert at the ballroom, allegedly for lack of skill. This alleged incident has been played up in marketing literature for the ballroom published by McMenamins.http://www.mcmenamins.com/126-crystal-ballroom-history It is known that Little Richard did play the Crystal on that date, and that Hendrix was in his touring band for much of 1965.http://www.earlyhendrix.com/timeline-menu In addition, the two men did have a rocky relationship, with Hendrix leaving and rejoining the tour several times. However, there is no documented evidence that Hendrix played with Little Richard on that particular date, or that Little Richard fired any musicians onstage that day (Hendrix or otherwise). In addition, Hendrix would appear with Little Richard at shows in other cities later that same month, and he had a well-established reputation as a guitarist by that point in his career. Facilities The Crystal Ballroom‚Äîthe third floor of the building‚Äîhas high ceilings, a balcony, grand chandeliers, murals, and wide floor-to-ceiling arched windows. The room can be rented for group meetings of up to 1,000 people or, in concert configuration, up to 1500 standing persons or 850 seated.

After testing at the Czechoslovak flight facility at Prague-Lethany, modifications were undertaken to improve the machine's performance.

The machines however did not remain in frontline fighter status with the Czechoslovak Air Force until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939. The sole ≈†.331 and 22 out of 24 produced ≈†.231s were sold to representatives of the Spanish Republican government.

United States, 362 U.S. 402 (1960), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court affirmed a defendant's right to have a competency evaluation before proceeding to trial.. The Court outlined the basic standards for determining competency. Background Milton Dusky, a 33-year-old man, was charged with assisting in the kidnapping and rape of an underage female. He was clearly suffering from schizophrenia but was found competent to stand trial and received a sentence of 45 years. On petition of writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court, the petitioner requested for his conviction to be reversed on the grounds that he was not competent to stand trial at the time of the proceeding. Decision Upon reviewing the evidence, the court decided to grant the writ of certiorari. The court ruled that to be competent to stand trial the defendant must have a \\"sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\\" and a \\"rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\\" The court made clear that a brief mental status exam was insufficient. His case was remanded for retrial, at which time his sentence was reduced to 20 years. Significance This case set the current standard for adjudicative competence in the United States. Although the statutes addressing competency vary from state to state in the United States, the two elements outlined in the decision are held in common: *The defendant must understand the charges against him or her *The defendant must have the ability to aid his or her attorney in his or her own defense. Subsequently, in Godinez v. Moran (1993), the Supreme Court held that the competency standard for pleading guilty or waiving the right to counsel is the same as the competency standard for standing trial established in Dusky.. In Indiana v. Edwards (2008), however, the Supreme Court made a distinction between competence to waive counsel (CTWC), which was the subject of Godinez, and competence to represent oneself (CTRO). The majority opinion, authored by Breyer, noted, \\"In certain instances an individual may well be able to satisfy Dusky's mental competence standard, for he will be able to work with counsel at trial, yet at the same time he may be unable to carry out the basic tasks needed to present his own defense without the help of counsel.\\" However, the court did not actually provide a CTRO standard, opting instead to leave this to legislatures and lower courts. Felhous (2011) argues that many state statutes and the federal statute do not incorporate the rationality standard enunciated in Dusky, and that various post-Dusky court decisions had not consistently affirmed the rationality standard.Felthous, A. R. (2011). Competence to stand trial should require rational understanding.

An online college fair operates according to several of the usual conventions of a ‚Äúbrick and mortar‚Äù college fair: there are event halls, schools have booths that prospective students and/or parents can visit to exchange information, and there are speaker sessions by various admissions and education experts. However, the entire fair is contained online, and therefore an online college fair can also have many of the characteristics of a virtual world. One of the main benefits of an online college fair is that travel cost is eliminated for both school representatives and students. History The first such online college fair was organized by the National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC) and held on October 9, 2001. Approximately 200 institutions participated; the number of participating students is unknown. This first online college fair was widely considered a failure as the number of students trying to log on overloaded the system.The Chronicle for Higher Education NACAC, which planned on conducting online college fairs on a regular basis, discontinued the program after the initial event. Additional online college fair providers have come and gone. Gradschools.com hosted an online college fair in conjunction with a live fair. This event also ran into technical difficulties; namely firewall problems and recruiters that were not prepared to use the online chat features.Matrix: The Magazine for Leaders in Education In November 2002, the Big Apple College Fair also had an online college fair in conjunction with a live fair.PR Newswire In October 2007, BusinessWeek, which produces annual rankings of United States business school MBA programs, held an MBA Expo 2007 with the tagline ‚ÄúFind the B-School that fits you best.‚Äù A total of 8 US and international business schools attended.

During this time he served on the Southwest Corridor Transportation Coalition, the Minnesota State Fire Fighters Training Board, Watertown Chamber of Commerce, League of Minnesota Cities Improving Local Economies Committee, Southeast Minnesota Initiative Fund, and the Council on Collaboration. He also served several years on the Lanesboro Fire Department/Ambulance Service as a Firefighter and EMT-B. Military service At the age of 17, Sarvi enlisted in the Army Reserves and served as an infantryman. When attending the University of Minnesota, Steve enrolled in ROTC and switched from the Reserves to the Minnesota National Guard. He was commissioned a Second Lieutenant and served as a platoon leader for a tank company based in Chisholm, Minnesota. In 1985, he graduated from the US Army Airborne School and in 1987, after graduating from the University of Minnesota with a bachelor's degree in Political Science and minor in Humanities, he joined the Active Army with a Regular Army commission. At the Armor Officers Basic Course at Fort Knox, Kentucky, he graduated in the top 3 of the class. Then he served with the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, Colorado as a tank platoon leader, company executive officer, and Assistant Operations Officer for the 3rd Battalion 68th Armored Regiment. In 1992 he left the Army at the rank of Captain. Sarvi joined the Minnesota Army National Guard in 1999 as a Sergeant and was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 135th Infantry Regiment, stationed at West St. Paul. Following 9/11 his unit was called upon to provide security at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport.

He believes that a change in U.S. policy in Iraq is needed. Although the district leans Republican with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+3, Kline's unwavering support for Bush and the Iraq War may make him vulnerable to a challenger in 2008.

You know, the day after the election, the pundits are gonna go around the country and look at some of these elections where the democrat wasn't supposed to win. They're gonna look at Minnesota's second congressional district and say, 'How did Steve Sarvi do it?'\\". Sarvi would go on to lose the election by 14.8%.
