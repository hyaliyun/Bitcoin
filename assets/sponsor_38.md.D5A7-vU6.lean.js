Each week, three chefs are challenged to craft the perfect dinner party for celebrity chef Rocco DiSpirito and his guests. The contestants are judged on their cooking, service, and d√©cor. The winner of each episode wins $20,000 (USD). Show format In each episode, three chefs are chosen to compete against each other to create a dinner party for host Rocco DiSpirito and his celebrity guests. The competition consists of two rounds. During the first round, the chefs have one shot at impressing Rocco by creating their signature dish. Sometimes, Rocco gives the contestants only 30 minutes to prepare their signature dish. A Time Timer shows the 30 minutes quickly elapsing as contestants race to finish the assignment. Rocco then selects two chefs to advance to the final round, wherein they must plan and execute the perfect dinner party. Each episode has a theme around which the contestants must base their cuisine and dining experience; this theme guides each contestant to develop his own menu and create a unique party concept. At the end of party, Rocco declares the winner and the winning chef takes home the prize of $20,000.

Administratively, the agency is a division within the Department of Family and Community Services and Justice. The Chief Executive of the Office of Sport is Matt Miller. Ultimately, the agency is responsible to the Minister for Sport, Multiculturalism, Seniors and Veterans, presently the Hon. John Sidoti MP. History The history of the agency goes back to 1955 when the New South Wales Department of Sport and Recreation was formed. In 2003 the agency was reincarnated as the New South Wales Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (2003 to 2006), the Department of the Arts, Sport and Recreation (2006 to 2009), Communities NSW (2009 to 2011), and Office of Communities, Sport & Recreation (2011-2014). NSW Sport and Recreation was formed in 2014. Branches Sport and Recreation is divided into 3 branches: =Commercial Services= As part of its commitment to the people of NSW, the Office of Sport manages 10 Centres in NSW, 3 Olympic Sport Venues and The Duke of Edinburgh's Award. The Sport and Recreation Centres offer people of all ages the opportunity to participate in well-planned recreational and sporting activities in a residential environment at an economical cost. The Centres offer the following programs and services: * School camps for government, independent and catholic schools throughout NSW (targeted at primary and high school students) * Kids and family holiday camps ‚Äì during school holidays * Programs for under-represented and disadvantaged groups such as respite camps for disabled teens * Active experiences and outdoor education programs for corporates and community groups.

The branch works closely with stakeholders in the sport and recreation sector, other entities within the portfolio and key government agencies including Infrastructure NSW, Destination NSW and NSW Treasury. The branch is responsible for the development and implementation of key major projects including the NSW Stadia Strategy. The NSW Government announced in September 2015 that more than $1.6 billion will be invested in the stadia network over the next decade. $600 million has been set aside in Rebuilding NSW and the NSW Government will provide a further allocation of funding to complete the projects.

History  Goeyvaerts composed the Sonata during the winter of 1950‚Äì51, and brought the score with him when he attended the Darmst√§dter Ferienkurse in the Summer of 1951. There he met Karlheinz Stockhausen, five years his junior and at the time and a student in his last year at the Cologne Conservatory. Goeyvaert's and Stockhausen's analysis and performance of the second movement of the Sonata in Theodor W. Adorno's composition seminar had considerable significance for those young composers eager to develop serial thinking. The influence of the Sonata is also evident in Stockhausen's early serial compositions , particularly Kreuzspiel, which Stockhausen began composing on his way home from Darmstadt and finished on 4 November 1951 . Adorno, however, did not appreciate the qualities of the work's second movement, because he could not find any motivic coherence in it. When Goeyvaerts found it difficult to defend himself in German (a language in which he was not fluent), Stockhausen stood up for his friend, telling Adorno, \\"you are looking for a chicken in an abstract painting\\" . Although originally titled Sonata for Two Pianos, Goeyvaerts later sought to accentuate the innovative intent of the work by referring to it simply as Opus 1 or Nummer 1 . Material and form The Sonata for Two Pianos is in four movements, which are simply designated with Roman numerals and metronome markings. Movements I and II are presented in retrograde to form movements III and IV‚Äîa pattern that may have been suggested by the four sections of the first piece in Olivier Messiaen's Livre d'Orgue . It is among the earliest examples of multiple or integral serialism, though it is something of a hybrid work. The outer movements relapse into older patterns and do not exhibit the technical purity and perfection of structural organisation found in the middle movements (; ). It was only with his Nummer 2 for 13 instruments that Goeyvaerts found a way of composing in which absolutely everything, from the overall form down to the tiniest detail, is governed by one and the same serial principle (Delaere 2001). The second movement in particular, with its isolated tones, is an example of punctual music . The pitch organisation is not based on a twelve-tone row, but rather on a fourteen-note structure, organised into pairs of seven-note sets. With reference to the chromatic total, these sets are complementary, except they both include the two pitches A and E (Sabbe 1981, 7). A possible model is the fourteen-tone series serving as the theme of the variation movement in Schoenberg's Serenade op. 24 . One technique used in the Sonata to preserve an equilibrium amongst several parameters is the \\"synthetic number\\". This term was coined by Goeyvaerts and Stockhausen to describe a homeostatic system based on the reconciliation of tendencies, where an increase in one dimension (e.g., duration) results in a decrease in another dimension (e.g., loudness) . The method used in the Sonata involves combining the numerical values assigned to the elements in each of four parameters (pitch, duration, loudness, and mode of attack) such that their sum will always be 7 .

He wrote many commentaries on Galen's works. He died in Mosul, Iraq.  Physiology  Ahmad ibn Abi al-Ash'ath described the physiology of the stomach in a live lion in his book al-Quadi wa al-muqtadi. He wrote: > When food enters the stomach, especially when it is plentiful, the stomach > dilates and its layers get stretched...onlookers thought the stomach was > rather small, so I proceeded to pour jug after jug in its throat‚Ä¶the inner > layer of the distended stomach became as smooth as the external peritoneal > layer. I then cut open the stomach and let the water out. The stomach shrank > and I could see the pylorus‚Ä¶ Ahmad ibn Abi al-Ash'ath observed the physiology of the stomach in a live lion in 959. This description preceded William Beaumont by almost 900 years, making Ahmad ibn al-Ash'ath the first person to initiate experimental events in gastric physiology.

Voters chose 29 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Pennsylvania voted for the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, over the Republican nominee, former Vice President Richard Nixon. Humphrey won Pennsylvania by a margin of 3.57%. A third-party candidate, former Alabama Governor George Wallace, played a significant role by winning 7.97% of the vote. This marked the first election since 1948 that a presidential candidate won the national election without carrying Pennsylvania. That did not happen again until 2000, along with 2004, when George W. Bush would win the presidential election both times without carrying Pennsylvania. This was also the first election that a Republican candidate was elected without carrying the state.

Although she worked in both Springfield, Massachusetts, and Wichita, Kansas, Thorner is primarily known as an anchor in Baltimore, Maryland, where she was on WMAR for ten years before joining WJZ-TV in 1993. After retiring from WJZ in 2009, Thorner began a career as a regular guest blogger for the Huffington Post, and as a voice-over artist.  Career  Thorner's lengthy career in Baltimore earned her regular praise from such publications as The Baltimore Sun and the Jewish Times. For example, in an article on her life after retiring from television, Baltimore Sun Magazine editor Jill Rosen wrote that \\"As an anchorwoman for 25 years, [she was] the omnipresent face of television news in Baltimore.\\" After Thorner announced her retirement, the Sun's David Zurawik wrote that, \\"She came to represent local broadcast news at its best - serious, trustworthy and nonsensational, but also reassuring and friendly... But it is her calm and solid presence at the anchor desk that will be missed and remembered most by Baltimore viewers. Thorner also embodied some of the challenges facing women of her generation, and was open in discussing the choices she made professionally in relation to goals for her family life.\\" In addition to her role as anchor, Thorner also played a minor role in the 1984 Goldie Hawn vehicle Protocol. In her role as Huffington Post blogger, Thorner has discussed both her travels and more serious issues such as her battle with melanoma. Thorner has also utilized her role on the Huffington Post to promote Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America (LEDA).  Move to WJZ  In 1992 WJZ approached Thorner to lead their new 5 p.m. broadcast. At the time, she had been working nights at WMAR, so she took the job for both a pay raise and better hours (as she had become a new mother the year before). Thorner was not, however, able to immediately begin work at WJZ because of a non-compete clause in her previous contract. So, in December 1992, WJZ agreed to pay Thorner a full salary throughout all of 1993 although she would not log one hour on-air. This move proved front-page fodder for the local newspapers as the advance payment represented WJZ management's confidence in Thorner's ability to win ratings. In fact, in a noted departure from Baltimore's traditional schema of co-anchors, Thorner was clearly delineated as the marquee player. On the eve of her return to broadcast news in January 1994, the Sun wrote: \\"Tomorrow is opening night for one of the most important productions in the history of Baltimore television -- WJZ's new 5 o'clock news with Sally Thorner. For the record, WJZ calls it \\"Eyewitness News at Five\\" and has an impressive-looking press kit that stresses its \\"four-member news team -- Sally Thorner as news anchor joined by John Buren, Bob Turk and Sandra Pinckney.\\" But Thorner's the franchise. She's the free agent for whom WJZ general manager Marcellus Alexander took out the checkbook and paid $250,000 in November 1992.\\"  Personal life  Thorner was born in Great Neck, New York, on June 20, 1955. She earned a BA from Smith College. In 1990, Thorner married physician Brian Rosenfeld. Their son, Everett Rosenfeld, is the Asia Pacific editor for CNBC.

This occurrence is common with women artists and if not documented will cause confusion in their lifetime body of work. Her maiden name is Zager with no art created under this name. She created, worked and exhibited under the following last names during these years: Phyllis Downs (1939‚Äì1961), Phyllis Ames (1962‚Äì1968) and Phyllis Wiener (1971‚Äìpresent).BIOGRAPHY FOR AMERICAN ARTISTS PHYLLIS WIENER by Janet G.

Wiener became one of the first woman artists to garner serious attention in the male-dominated art world of the 1950s and 60s. In 1981, Phyllis Wiener said: ‚ÄúCameron Booth taught me about painting.

It was constructed by Vijaya Raghunatha Sethupathi, the Raja of Ramnad in 1687. Later the fort was handed over to his brother in law Raghunatha Raya Tondaiman. The fort has been extensively renovated by Archaeological Survey of India in 2012.  Architecture  The fort originally said to have been a 'ring fort' with seven concentric walls has only four surviving now. The construction of the fort is of inferior quality as small blocks of stone were used along with bricks for the building of the fortification. The fort has three entrances; one on the north, another on the south and third on the east. The shrines dedicated to Hanuman, Sakthi, Ganapathi, Karuppar (guardian deities of the fort) are noticed on the southern side and shrine to Bhairava on the northern side. Halfway to the top on the right side a chamber which was used as magazine was noticed. Opposite to this chamber on the western slope of a boulder is a rock cut cell containing a linga on yonipitha, the spout of which is supported by the figure of a dwarf. bastion with cannon of British origin On the top of the rock is a bastion with cannon of British origin. To the south of this Platform is a natural pond. On the southern slope there are two rock cut temples, one of them dedicated to Sri Sathyamurthy-Sri Uyyavanda Nachiar (Vaishnavite) and another to Sri Sathyagireeswarar-Sri Venuvaneeswari (Saivite), Which are historically and religiously more important. To the northwest is another pond and to the southeast another tank. There are six more cannons mounted in the north, south and east gates. Historical Importance The fortress is of great historical significance and was an important stronghold of rebel chieftains in the Polygar Wars. Oomathurai, the brother of Panchalankurichi chieftain Kattabomman was captured in this fort. The fort is locally known as Oomayan Kottai(fort of the dumb). The fort is maintained and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India as a ticketed monument.

These temples were constructed by the Chola feudatory and Irukkuvel chieftain Boothi Vikramakesari as per the inscription. Only two of the three temples have managed to survive. The place was ruled by Irukkuvel chieftains. Kodumbalur was also the site of a fierce battle between the Pandyas and the Pallavas. Architecture According to the chief's inscription, he built three temples in the complex one for himself and the other two for his wives, namely, Nangai Varaguna Perumanar and Karrali. Only the basement survives the northern shrine. The basement is moulded like a full blown lotus flower(padma pushkala adisthanas). The other two shrines, namely the central and southern are more or less intact. Each central shrine is 6.4sqmetres at the base and they all face west. The walls are rich in details and there is a small shrine for Nandi in front of the Maha mandapa. The two circular pilasters with circular shafts on four sides of the vimana indicates the antiquity of the temple. The feature is possibly termed Vrittasputitas in silpa texts like Shilparatna. Such a feature is otherwise found only in few other temples like Neyyadiappar Temple, Tillaistanam, Tiruttalinathar Temple in Thiruputhur, Vijayalaya Choleeswaram in Narthamalai, Anantheswara temple in Udayarkudi and Kampaheswarar Temple, Thirubuvanam. According to historian Harle, the temple is counted among the four early extant temples of the Chola Empire, with the other three being Koranganatha Temple in Tiruchirappalli district, Nageswaran temple at Kumbakonam and Brahmapureeswarar temple in Thanjavur district. These temples follow the Pallava architecture which are relatively small in size. They all have a fair-sized porch, locally called ardhamandapa attached to the sanctum, both of which are slightly below the ground level in a pit kind of structure. The structures are also predominantly built of stone. Near Moovar Koil, located little westerly is a Hindu temple of Muchukundeswarar temple of Early Chola period. The temple complex is maintained and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India as a ticketed monument. Significance The temple is very important as it is a living example of early to medieval Chola architecture. The inscription in the temple also gives us a glimpse of the political climate of south India between the 8th and the 10th centuries as well as the relation between the royal houses of Chola and the Irukkuvel. The latter were traditional allies of the Cholas and the chief, Boothi Vikramakesari himself was the son of a Chola princess Anupama and Irukkuvel chieftain Samarabirama.

It is directed, written, and co-produced by Stephen Sommers and stars Anton Yelchin as Odd Thomas, with Willem Dafoe as Wyatt Porter, and Addison Timlin as Stormy Llewellyn.  Plot  Odd Thomas (Yelchin) is a psychic who lives in a small town in California. He describes his ability as, \\"I see dead people, but then, by God, I do something about it.\\" One day Odd has a vision of faceless people wearing bowling shirts who cry out to him to save them. A faceless gunman shoots them all, including Odd. Recovering from the disturbing dream, he goes to his job as a short-order cook. He serves lunch to a strange man named Robert Robertson, whose hair resembles some kind of mold, which is why Odd gives him the nickname Fungus Bob. Fungus Bob is surrounded by dozens of s, invisible creatures that feed on evil and carnage whom only Odd can see. Odd's co-worker, Viola Peabody (Mbatha-Raw), recounts a strange dream in which she saw herself shot dead with another man. The man's clothing is identical to that worn by the faceless people in Odd's vision. Odd uses his psychic magnetism to pursue Fungus Bob; the trail leads to the mall where Odd's girlfriend Stormy (Timlin) is manager at an ice cream shop. Odd follows Fungus Bob to his house, breaking in once he leaves. Odd finds a file containing newspaper clippings of mass murderers, arranged by name. There is also a blank calendar page for the next day; Odd realizes that Robertson is planning something bad on that date. Odd reports this to Chief Porter at his house, and meets Officer Eckles and Lysette, who once dated Harlo after being set up by Chief Porter and his wife. Porter assigns two deputies to follow Fungus Bob. Odd meets Stormy for dinner in the belfry of a church. He sees Fungus Bob approaching and they flee to the sacristy, which Robertson destroys as they escape. Stormy calls Chief Porter, who finds the church vandalized but no evidence to link it to Robertson. Odd's psychic magnetism leads him and Stormy to a bowling alley, where the bowling shirts from his vision have just become the new uniform. Chief Porter sends Officer Simon Varner (Tortorella) to watch the place on Odd's advice. Varner asks Odd about Robertson and is suspicious to learn that Odd had encountered him only a few hours ago, and presses for more information. Viola remembers more details of her dream; she tells Odd that she and the man in the bowling shirt were not the only victims of the shooting, and a large group of people were killed. Odd sees s hovering over Vi's daughters, and he advises her to leave town with her daughters immediately. While driving home, Stormy is overcome with fear for Odd's safety and he tries to comfort her. They hear a woman screaming: Odd finds Chief Porter‚Äôs wife with Lysette, who has been mauled to death by dogs resembling those at Robertson's home. Another man was said to have tried rescuing her by shooting the dogs, but was too late. Odd finds Fungus Bob shot to death in his bathtub, with evidence framing Odd for the murder. Odd surmises that if he goes to the police, Porter will be compelled to arrest him based on the evidence, keeping him from preventing the next day's disaster. He discovers that Bob has been dead for quite some time and deduces that the encounter at the church was with the dead man's restless spirit. Wrapping the body in sheets, Odd dumps the corpse in the execution chamber of an abandoned prison. Chief Porter is shot in a home invasion. Odd rushes to the hospital and learns that Porter is alive thanks to a metal trinket Odd had given him, but in serious condition. Returning to Bob's home, Odd finds a receipt for a moving van and improvised explosives, and browser bookmarks for Satanic websites. He searches the fridge and freezer and discovers various human body parts as well. Robertson's poltergeist destroys the house as Odd escapes, though he loses his cell phone in the process. Odd investigates Bob's fatal bullet wound, and finds a tattoo matching Varner's. He realizes that \\"POD\\" is an abbreviation for \\"Prince of Darkness\\". Odd realizes that Robertson was eliminated by his co-conspirators because Odd had begun to look into him. Odd's psychic magnetism leads him back to the mall, where Officer Eckles has murdered the mall security staff; Odd disables him with a baseball bat. He takes Eckles's pistol and seeks out Varner. Hearing screams from the end of the mall where Stormy works, he hurries to the site, and spots another gunman firing off an automatic weapon. Odd fires at the gunman with Eckles's weapon, killing him as he attempts to reload. Odd removes the gunman's mask and recognizes him as the man who tried to rescue Lysette. The lingering spirit of Lysette appears, directing him to the loading dock. There he discovers Bob's moving van packed with explosives on a timer ‚Äî apparently part of a plan to kill the shoppers in the mall and arriving first responders. Odd manages to start the van and drive it away from the mall, when Varner returns and shoots Odd. Varner clings to the outside of the van, attempting to finish off Odd. Odd jumps from the van as Varner enters the cab, and the van crashes into a man-made canal and explodes, incinerating Varner but killing no one else. Odd wakes in the hospital to Stormy tending to him. Viola greets him and tells him that Porter has been released from intensive care, and that Odd is a local hero. Later, Odd retreats to Stormy's apartment to enjoy uninterrupted time with her. Porter, his wife, and Viola arrive and reveal what he already knows: Stormy was killed in the mall shooting and he has been spending time with her lingering spirit. Porter, realizing that Stormy is staying in this world only for Odd, advises him to let her go. Odd bids her a tearful farewell, promising her that they'll be reunited one day. Then Odd travels to Las Vegas to continue his crusade to help the living and the lingering dead, believing that he is not yet worthy of an afterlife with Stormy.

Early casting announcements included 50 Cent as Shamus Cocobolo as well as Lily Collins and Tim Robbins none of whom ultimately ended up appearing in the film. Production began in May 2011 in Santa Fe, New Mexico and Albuquerque. Dean Koontz himself enjoyed the film saying \\"It is so wonderful that I am whacked flat by happiness.\\" The film wrapped in 2011 but was delayed. In July 2013, it was reported that the release of the film had been delayed because of legal action by Two Out of Ten Productions against Outsource Media Group and others for breach of contract.

Brian Tallerico for RogerEbert.com gave it one and a half stars calling it \\"a film that's going through the motions with too little character, style, or atmosphere to keep it engaging.\\" Dennis Harvey for Variety said the film \\"is neither witty nor macabre enough to pull off Koontz‚Äôs balance of elements in cinematic terms. So it winds up coming off as just another CGI-laden ride that‚Äôs at once overstuffed and undernourished.\\" John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter found the script felt rushed and while the cast was enjoyable \\"Odd Thomas just doesn't leave us with much desire to return there.\\" Drew Taylor for IndieWire gave the film a B and called it \\"the best Koontz adaptation, by a fairly considerable margin.\\" =Box office= The movie was a box office bomb.

Trained in his native California, he works and lives in New York City. Le Va is among the leading figures of post-studio and process art to emerge in the late 1960s. His abstract sculptures, installations, drawings, and editioned works are featured in major art collections around the world. Training and Early career Le Va attended California State University, Long Beach from 1960 to 1963, continuing his studies at Los Angeles College of Art & Design, and at the Otis Art Institute of LA County, Los Angeles, where he received a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree in 1967. In 1968, Le Va was awarded a Young Talent Grant from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He worked as an instructor at Minneapolis College of Art & Design from 1968 to 1970, and taught advanced sculpture at Princeton University from 1973 to 1974. From 1976 he taught graduate-level classes in sculpture at Yale University, In 1974, Le Va received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Sculpture, and in 1976, received a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship. Work  Le Va's pioneering scatter pieces on the floor, started in 1966, made him one of the first of the so-called Process artists. In 1969, he started to create works with cleavers serially embedded in walls or floors. More recently, he has produced monumental abstract works and site-specific installations.http://www.artnet.com/galleries/artists_detail.asp?gid=139120&aid;=10211 Le Va's first solo exhibitions were held in 1969 at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis. Since then, Le Va has exhibited his work across the United States, as well as Canada, Europe and Israel. In 2005, Le Va's work was the subject of a major retrospective exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia (ICA). The exhibition, Accumulated Vision, Barry Le Va, was accompanied by the publication of a comprehensive monograph of the artist's work. The ICA described Le Va's work as: \\"Since the late 1960s, the American artist Barry Le Va has used broken glass, meat cleavers, wool felt, ball bearings, powdered chalk, cast concrete, paper towels, linseed oil, a typewriter and a gun, among other things, to make his art. Part of a generation intent on knocking art off its pedestal, Le Va claimed the floor as his field of operations by scattering massive amounts of materials, or forms, to create works which he called \\"distributions.\\" Apparently random, even chaotic, these installations are in fact premeditated and executed according to plan. Not surprisingly, drawing plays a significant role in the work of this artist whose formative training is in architecture. Le Va's distributions make him one of the leading practitioners of Post-minimalism and Process Art. But his own, preferred frame of reference comes not from recent art history, but from mystery novels. He has likened his installations to crime scenes and invites viewers to look for clues to reconstruct the, often violent, act or concept that underlies them.\\" Le Va has been described as being \\"Like his art, he's not such an easy guy to be around, by turns challenging, gracious, explanatory and gnomic\\". In 2009, Le Va exhibited at the Mary Boone Gallery, New York. Le Va's work is found in the following museum collections (among others): * Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York * Art Institute of Chicago * Dallas Museum of Art * Los Angeles County Museum of Art * Minneapolis Institute of Arts * Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles * Museum of Modern Art, New York * National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. * Parrish Art Museum, Southampton, New York * Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art, Porto, Portugal * Walker Art Center, Minneapolis * Wexner Center for the Arts, Ohio State University, Columbus * Whitney Museum of American Art, New York Further reading * Barry Le Va: The Aesthetic Aftermath by Michael Maizels, 2015, University of Minnesota Press  References   External links  * MoMA  The Collection  Barry Le Va.

It was the first sound film adaptation of the Shakespearean play of the same name. The film was adapted by Taylor from William Shakespeare's play. Cast * Mary Pickford as Katherina * Douglas Fairbanks as Petruchio * Edwin Maxwell as Baptista * Joseph Cawthorn as Gremio * Clyde Cook as Grumio * Geoffrey Wardwell as Hortensio * Dorothy Jordan as Bianca Production The first sound version of the play on film, this version was planned as a sound film from the start. Pickford had already made her sound film debut in Coquette (1929) so The Taming of the Shrew marked her second talkie. This version of the film is primarily known for how Pickford delivers Katherina's last speech. As she moves through the litany of reasons why a woman should obey her husband, she winks toward Bianca, unseen by Petruchio. Bianca smiles in silent communication with Katherina, thus acknowledging that Katherina has not been tamed at all. Pickford and Fairbanks' marriage was breaking down even before filming began, and animosity between the couple increased during filming. In later years, Pickford stated that working on the film was the worst experience of her life, although she also acknowledged that Fairbanks' performance was one of his best. For many years it was believed that one of the credits read \\"Additional Dialogue by Sam Taylor\\", but there is no evidence any print ever contained such a credit and experts on Shakespeare films, like Kenneth S. Rothwell and Robert Hamilton Ball, think it unlikely. Reception Fairbanks biographer Jeffrey Vance, writing in 2008, believes \\"Taming of the Shrew has never received the recognition it deserves as the first talking film of a Shakespeare play. It was not only technically superior to the majority of talking pictures in 1929 but would unquestionably be the finest translation onto film of Shakespeare for some time to come.\\" Vance also sees the film as a window into the Pickford-Fairbanks marriage: \\"As a reenactment of the Pickford-Fairbanks marriage, Taming of the Shrew continues to fascinate as a rather grim comedy. The two willful, larger-than-life personalities working at cross-purposes and conveying their resentment and frustration to each other through blatant one-upmanship and harsh wounds is both the movie and the marital union.\\" Leonard Malton describes the film as ‚Äúdefeated by its lack of pacing and downright embarrassing performances, though it's undeniably fascinating to see Doug and Mary together in their only co-starring appearance. This is the film with the infamous credit, \\"By William Shakespeare, with additional dialogue by Sam Taylor. Home media After many years out of circulation, the film was re-released in 1966 in a new cut supervised by Pickford herself. New sound effects and music were added throughout, much of the voice dubbing was enhanced with newly available technology, and seven minutes were cut from the initial print. This re- released version is the only version now available on DVD or VHS.Aikman Archive DVD booklet References Bibliography  External links  Category:1929 films Category:1929 romantic comedy films Category:American films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:American black-and- white films Category:Films based on The Taming of the Shrew Category:Films set in Italy Category:United Artists films Category:Films directed by Sam Taylor Category:Films with screenplays by Sam Taylor (director) Category:Films made before the MPAA Production Code Category:1929 comedy films ","title":"The Taming of the Shrew (1929 film)"},{"id":"32100801","title":"John of Castile, Lord of Valencia de Campos"},{"id":"32100811","text":"Kickin' It is an American comedy television series created by Jim O'Doherty that aired on Disney XD from June 13, 2011 to March 25, 2015.

While they wait to do so, they are given reading material and movies to watch about abortion and related issues, including material produced by Del Vecchio. Eventually, one of the women decide to give birth willingly, other accept to do it relutanctly and the third tries to force a miscarriage.

Perras (lit. Bitches) is a 2011 Mexican Drama film directed by Guillermo R√≠os based on the play of the same name. Its plot revolves around 10 schoolgirls who are all suspects of something terrible that happened at school, focusing in the memories and feelings of each girl. This is the device that gives us a glimpse of the ethics, games, aesthetics and eroticism of these girl-women. The movie was heavily promoted as a Thriller in trailers, posters and other media, but some critics found it misleading, since fits most in the drama category due to its content. The film premiered in theaters in Mexico City on March 4, 2011. Plot A group of private secondary schoolgirls have to remain in their classroom and wait for the police to arrive and interrogate them, since they all are suspects of something terrible that had just happened at their school. The movie begins as the initial narrator quietly sits in the back of the classroom, separated from the rest, while the others simply ignore her. As they wait, the memories and feelings of each girl are explored. Each one has a story to tell, which explains how they become connected as the movie progresses, it is gradually revealed that Maria and Sof√≠a, although they have opposite personalities, became best friends over time, and despite Maria's initial introverted nature, she was dazzled by Sofia's free way of life, gradually accepting it as her own, to the point where she agrees to have sex with her best friend's father. As a result, she becomes pregnant, and in a desperate attempt to terminate her pregnancy, she tries to perform an abortion in the school's bathroom. The abortion results in Maria's death due to blood loss, finally revealing that she has been dead from the beginning. It is not the real Maria, but her memory that is one who has been narrating, directing the story only to Diana, who being blind, has the ability to \\"spot her\\".

She's the only actress who appeared in both the stage play and movie, although she played different characters. * Steph Boumelcroud ‚Äì Iris \\"La √ëo√±a\\" Reception The movie has received mixed to bad critics. On IMDb has received an average rating of 5.3, with similar ratings on other rating movie databases such as Letterboxd and TMDB. The critics questioned mostly the participation of adult women as the main characters, playing as secondary school girls, instead of casting true teenage actress (a common practice in Mexican TV shows), and the frequent and unnecessary allusions to old Mexican soap operas and some connotations not according to the age the main characters supposedly have. At some point in the movie the girls mention their favorite singer is an old ballad Mexican singer, instead of any pop star of their age, and their favorite TV shows are the kind middle age or senior adults watch, as if the screenwriter had no clue of the likes of an actual teenager. The girls also seem to be very familiar with real life events that happened 20‚Äì30 years ago, before they even were born. The presence of an adult version of Frida talking about her past may indicate the complete story is actually a memory, which may explain those time issues, but the furniture, cars, clothes and other media present in the movie indicates it is happening in actual times. The movie has also been criticized for being written from a misogynous perspective, which frequently remarks \\"that all girls just want to do it\\", and it is not easy to say what the real subject of the movie is, since there are so many: the discovery of sexuality, discrimination, chance, drugs, maternity, traditions, betrayals, power, love. A mural of a complex reality from the point of view of twenty-something women in the skin of 14 to 17 year old girls.

The band consists of Chad Kendrick (guitar & vocals), and Marco Yellin (guitar & vocals), and frequently headlines along Australia's east coast, with roots in both Bondi and Manly beaches.  History  Officially formed in late 2010, the members of The Trip had played in a variety of bands together since the early 2000s, having met in the thriving live music scene of Bondi Beach. In 2007, the band travelled to the USA to work with Platinum selling, Grammy nominated producer Sylvia Massy. After spending 8 weeks recording at Radiostar Studios in Northern California, the band returning to Australia in early 2008 with the finished 11 track record. After a brief management period with Martha Troup (manager of INXS frontman Michael Hutchence), the bands independent label JDog Records decided not to release the record in Australia, but to return to the US to promote the band and the record there. Later in 2008 the band returned to LA to meet producers to continue work on the record. After meeting a range of producers The Trip eventually worked with multiple Grammy winner Thom Russo, Gavin MacKillop and newcomer Chad Gendason on several of the tracks recorded with Massy in 2007. Whilst in LA, the band played a handful of local shows in the South Bay area, and an industry showcase gig at the Viper Room in West Hollywood which saw an unusually packed room for a mid- week gig on a Tuesday night. On return to Australia in early 2009, The Trip had an EP‚Äôs worth of tracks which would be released under JDog Records act ‚ÄòMOJADA‚Äô. The heavily produced commercial sound proved palatable with commercial radio with tracks from the EP scoring 3 sync deals including a major national TVC campaign for AAPT,Unlimited Broadband TVC  AAPT and a Channel 10 promotional spot. A further track from the EP also scored the band (then Mojada) a win at the MusicOz Independent Music Awards for ‚ÄòBest Rock Artist‚Äô 2010.2010 MusicOz Winners  MusicOz The band however were still not satisfied that their record was complete and ready for release, so during 2009 they had begun travelling to Adelaide, SA to begin the laborious task of re- recording their entire record from scratch with a new producer Michael Sinclair who one of the band members previously went to high school with. They spent the most part of the next 12 months travelling between Sydney and Adelaide to complete the record between side jobs and touring. Eventually the record was completed again towards the end of 2010. At that time, satisfied at last with the finished product the band and their label JDog Records mutually agreed that the record should be released under a new name and band image. Later in 2010 JDog Records settled on ‚ÄòThe Band The Trip‚Äô as the new name and releasing act for the record.

Hilpert decided against a career in academia and began to work instead for the Statebank of Saxony. After working his way from the role of unsalaried clerk to department secretary, he began working as an assistant to the Union of Leipzig Retailers. At the end of 1922 he began working as a syndic whose job it was to regulate the financial issues of the enterprisers and employers of the retailers. Under his guidance the Leipzig Retailers Union attained a leading role among the retailer unions of Germany. During this time he worked with his colleague and close friend Otto Kitzinger to begin producing \\"Der Einzelhandelsdienst,\\" a newspaper for retailers. Between 1922 and 1932 he also worked as the chief executive officer of the Linoleum Merchants Union, a cartel. Nazi-Era Hilpert began working in politics in 1927 as a member of the Leipzig city council. During his time on the Leipzig city council, he preoccupied himself primarily with economic issues. In 1932, with his election as President of the Centre Party in Saxony, Hilpert began investing himself more deeply in the political realm.Pappert, Sabine (2004). \\"Werner Hilpert.\\" Christliche Demokraten gegen Hitler: Aus Verfolgung und Widerstand zur Union. Ed. Buchstab, G√ºnter; Kaff, Brigitte; Kleinmann, Hans-Otto. Freiburg, Germany: Herder, 2004. p. 263. Print. The rise to power of the Nazis abruptly changed his living situation. He lost his position in the city council and was forced by the Nazis to give up his position in the Centre Party in the summer of 1933.Pappert p.263 He began working as a self-employed business consultant and, through this work, became intertwined with numerous Jewish businessmen and women. In spite of the anti-Jewish laws of the Nazis, Hilpert continued to try to provide Jewish business owners with the best working conditions he could secure. His work for the Jewish community resulted in ongoing trouble for Hilpert with the Nazi Regime. Furthermore, Hilpert's role as President of the Catholic Action in Saxony from 1932 until 1937, in which he worked for the strengthening of Christian ethics throughout society, provided further conflict with the Nazis. Because of his role with the Catholic Action, Hilpert received notice in June 1934 that he was at risk of being arrested in connection with the R√∂hm-Putsch.Pappert p.263 On Kristallnacht in 1938, Hilpert's office was burned down. As a member of a list constructed by the Nazis of potentially dangerous persons, Hilpert was arrested by the Gestapo on 1 September 1939. He spent the next five and a half years in Buchenwald concentration camp as a political prisoner. During this time he wore the number 5618 and performed forced labor. He was a member of the Buchenwald Resistance and came to know Eugen Kogon through their mutual work in the camp's tailor shop.Pappert p.265 Post-War After spending nearly six years in Buchenwald, Hilpert seized the opportunity to take part in the restructuring of political and societal life in Germany. He took part in founding the CDU party in the federal state of Hesse in July 1945 and was elected President of the CDU Hesse in November of the same year. His primary goal was to overcome the religious division and class structure of Germany in order to create a unified party whose priority would be listening and responding to not only the middle class but also the working class.Pappert p.266 Hilpert served as governor of Hesse until 1947, when he became Minister of Finance. He was a member of the Bundestag throughout the first legislative session until his resignation on 10 October 1949. He served as President and Finance Director of the Deutsche Bundesbahn from 1952 until his death in Oberursel on 24 February 1957.

This structure has undergone numerous changes since the beginning of the nineteenth century. The state-power theory as put into perspective by Stephen Krasner (1976), explains that the structure of international trade is determined by the interests and power of states acting to maximize their aggregate national income, social stability, political power and economic growth. Such state interests can be achieved under free trade. The relationship between these interests and the level of openness depends upon the economic power of states. Power is dependent upon a states size and level of economic development. Krasner contends that distributions of potential power may vary from multipolar to hegemonic; and different international trading structures are made of either of these. The key to this argument is that a hegemonic distribution of potential economic power is likely to result in an open trading system. Since states act to maximize their aggregate economic utility, maximum global welfare is achieved under free trade. Neoclassical trade theory posits that the greater the degree of openness in the international trading system, the greater the level of aggregate economic income. Theoretical perspectives =Realism= Robert Gilpin and Stephen Krasner are advocates of the realist tradition, which emphasises the hegemonic system. The hegemonic system contends that there are states that are much larger and more developed than their trading partners and therefore, the costs and benefits of openness are not symmetrical for all members of the system. Krasner (1976) contends that the hegemonic state will have a preference for an open structure because it will increase its aggregate national income and power. Realism emphasizes states' demands for power and security. Military force is therefore, the most important power resource. States must rely ultimately on their own resources and must strive to maintain their power positions in the system, even at high economic costs. For realism, the most important variables are the economic and military strength of hegemonic states; and international hostilities are mainly because of variations in the distribution of political-military capabilities between states. Hegemonic stability The theory of hegemonic stability by the realist school argues that dominance of one country is necessary for the existence of an open and stable international economy. The relationship between hegemony and an open, stable economy has been challenged by some scholars ‚ÄúAs US behaviour during the interwar period illustrates, the possession of superior resources by a nation does not translate automatically into great influence or beneficial outcomes for the world.‚Äù Development policy Realist trade encourages Import substitution industrialization (ISI) replacing imports with domestic production. Realism recognises that trade regulations can be used to correct domestic distortions and to promote new industries. Under realism, states possess a high degree of discretionary power to influence many variables and prices in the economy. The government influences the distribution of investment, thus protecting national industries. International institutions Realists with their focus on power and the struggle for survival in an anarchical world, criticize the role of international institutions that govern the world economy, such as the World Bank, World Trade Organization (WTO), EU, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Scholars argue that the influence exerted by international institutions is dependent upon the states that form part of them, and therefore international institutions have little independent impact. Accordingly, the realist school emphasises the impact of state power over the strength of the institution per se. =Liberalism= The liberal tradition consists of two schools of thought on the causes of peace, one emphasises representative government and international institutions and the other advocates global markets and economic development. Liberalism traces back to Immanuel Kant. Kantian Liberalism posits that democracy, economic interdependence and international organisations are optimal solutions for reducing the incidence of conflict. It is not individual factors, which lead to a more peaceful world, but rather all three elements working in conjunction, which eliminates conflict. Oneal and Russett's (2001) research design has become a standard choice of replications in studies assessing the Kantian peace triangle where democracies tend to be interdependent and members of the same International Government Organisations (IGOs). Their research is consistent with the argument that democratic peace advocates economic interdependence and a joint need to attain membership in IGOs in order to prevent the incidence of conflict. However, the empirical findings on the Kantian peace triangle as a joint force to eliminate conflict presents some limitations, as one study found that the three Kantian peace variables are less robust in explaining leaders‚Äô conflict behaviour. Keohane and Nye (2000) go further to include the lack of additional components in this theory including environmental and military measurements. Trade Liberals emphasize two main aspects of the benefits of trade. First, trade promotes states to work together and cooperatively, reinforcing peaceful relations among trading partners. The second benefit is based on the expected utility model of trade and conflict which emphasises the potential economic consequences of a disruption in trade. Countries are therefore deterred from initiating conflict against a trading partner for fear of losing the welfare gains associated with trade. Interdependence Liberals argue that economic interdependence between states reduces conflict because conflict discourages commerce. Recent cost- benefit calculations of trade take into account information as an important component in the explanation of the pacifying aspect of economic interdependence. Through open trade, states reveal their intentions and capabilities and thus ‚Äúrelations become more transparent and reduce uncertainty.‚Äù Furthermore, economic interdependence makes costly signals possible. If military action did not entail loss, national leaders would not be able to communicate their capabilities and resolve. This acts as a deterrent and promotes peace between states. ‚ÄúMechanisms that facilitate the transmission of credible information across international boundaries limit bargaining failure, enhancing interstate peace.‚Äù There is some disagreement about the interdependence liberal thesis among some scholars. Kenneth Waltz, for example, argues that since \\"close interdependence means closeness of contact and raises the prospect of at least occasional conflict . . . the [liberal] myth of interdependence . . . asserts a false belief about the conditions that may promote peace.\\" Despite the scrutiny, there is a long- held position that economic interdependence has a pacifying effect on interstate relations, evidenced by research conducted by Oneal & Russett 1999 and Xiang et al. 2007. According to the liberal view, the costly nature of conflict is central to contemporary bargaining theory. Keohane & Nye (1987) put forth four conditions that make the use of force by large states costly: # Risks of nuclear escalation # Resistance by people in poor or weak countries # Uncertain and possibly negative effects on the achievement of economic goals # Domestic opinion opposed to the human costs of the use of force Development policy Liberal trade encourages export led growth (ELG), leaving traders and consumers dependent on foreign markets. Liberals argue that these actors have an incentive to avoid hostilities with their trading partners, since any disruption in commercial relations would be costly. International institutions International institutions are a key feature of the liberal peace, because they represent credible signals of resolve to defend member states in times of crisis, regulate state behaviour, facilitate communication and create common security interests between member states. The argument about trade and conflict The relationship between international trade and conflict has been a source of controversy among international relations scholars. Some scholars argue that trade does not reduce conflict even though conflict reduces trade; while others report that international trade fosters a peaceful disposition among states, which are less likely to resort to armed conflict in times of crisis. The argument that open trade inhibits conflict dates back to the classical liberal movement of free trade and world peace. This view argues that increasing interaction among traders and consumers (interdependence) promotes peace; free trade fosters a sense of international community that reduce interstate conflict and tensions. Liberals posit that free markets and economic development contribute to a reduction in interstate conflict. The contrasting contemporary view is that open trade dampens political conflict by promoting economic dependence. Economic dependence has negative consequences for interstate conflict. Albert O. Hirschman (1945) for example, has pointed out that the ‚Äúgains from trade do not accrue to states proportionately and the distribution of these gains can affect interstate power relations. Moreover, shifts in power relations are widely regarded as a potent source of military conflict.‚Äù =Economic interdependence= Economic interdependence and greater openness exposes domestic economies to the exigencies of the world market. Social instability is therefore increased by exposure to international competition. This negative force undermines the Kantian peace and remains a cause for concern in international conflict. Although this concern seems legitimate given the economic disparities between developed and developing countries, studies fail to provide comprehensive empirical evidence. Another view at odds with liberalism is that technological innovation and industrialization increase the ability of some countries to exercise power. As trade flows and the level of interdependence increases, so do the incentives for states to take military actions to reduce their economic vulnerability. The adverse effect of trade on state security is difficult to determine, however the more competition, the more aggressive the environment. Openness and competition increases social instability because domestic prices need to adjust to changes in international prices. Consistent with the realists view that states are essentially always in conflict, social instability and resource competition are motives for conflict and states will rely on the use of force to attain their own political goals and interests. =The role of military power= A number of international relations scholars, notably Xiang, Xu & Keteku 2007; Mearsheimer 2001, recognise the role of military power in initiating conflict, as well as the role militarily powerful countries play in international trade. One argument suggests that militarily capable countries are more likely to have the motivation to initiate armed conflict due to their awareness of their capabilities and to their confidence in achieving favourable outcomes. A second argument suggests that power facilitates trade. Third, there are positive benefits from economic interdependence on military power. Finally, the economic stature of a country determines both the military power and level of trade of that country, hinting that economic powerful states trade more. Because powerful countries are better positioned to take advantage of the benefits resulting from international trade and to transform welfare gains into military power, they also are more likely to use force when their positions are threatened. Similarly, Gartzke & Hewitt (2010) argue that the ‚Äúextension of economic and other interests beyond national borders increases incentives to police relevant regions and exercise influence, sometimes through force.‚Äù =Unequal peace= The motives for conflict, which historically were concentrated among the powerful and their ambitious challengers, are today clustered among the poor, and between the poor and the rich (Gartzke & Hewitt (2010). Theory has prompted to inequality as a potential source of internal conflict. ‚ÄùInequalities within the same countries has increased, not through impoverishment of the masses, but because while wealth is created many people remain left behind in poverty. Thus, we have an unequal peace.\\" Around 60 countries suffer not only from low GDP per capita but also low or negative growth. These countries tend to be caught in armed conflict among other development traps. Some argue that the evidence surrounding inequality and conflict remains inconclusive, calling for further empirical studies. Studies show that states with the most dissimilar interests possess a motive for conflict but whether they experience conflict (or not) depends on external determinants of bargaining success or failure. These determinants include uncertainty about the balance of power, opponent's resolve as well as policy dissimilarities between competing states. Interests are important determinants of whether conflict occurs. According to Gartzke & Hewitt (2010), promoting democratic interests, or even imposing them for peace, is not likely to reduce conflict ‚Äúit may even lead to a weakening of the actual determinants of liberal peace‚Äù, thereby increasing interstate tensions. Contemporary research demonstrates that promoting free markets and economic development helps mitigate conflict and promote peace Capitalist peace The capitalist peace thesis suggests that free markets and economic development contribute to a reduction in interstate conflict. Research on the capitalist peace has chosen to pursue the liberal political economy school, with a particular focus on Kant's Perpetual Peace. The same set of theoretical frameworks that evolved in democratic peace research now asserts itself in the capitalist peace (Gartzke & Hewitt 2010, p. 121). The capitalist peace sees capitalism as creating conditions to make war more costly and therefore undesirable by trading states. Traditional interpretations of the capital peace contend that development and global markets will eventually eliminate resource competition as a motive for war. This view was eventually deemed outdated, as ‚Äúit became clear that needed raw materials would continue to make their way to industrial centers through free markets, rather than through mercantilist autarkies (Gartzke & Hewitt, 2010, p. 122). The capitalist theory contends that as economies become stronger, prosperous capitalist states no longer need to threaten one another over access to inputs to production. Consequently, the security dilemma loses its relevance. Scholars like Michael Mousseau argue that democracies are only peaceful in pairs. Other research has demonstrated that the democratic peace is even more exclusive than previously imagined, limiting the finding to developed democracies. Gartzke and Hewitt (2010) challenged this by demonstrating that it is economic development and market freedoms, rather than political liberty that result in interstate peace. =Deterrent effect of institutional ties= International Government Organisations (IGOs) are designed to promote cooperation and inhibit political disputes. Institutional ties promote the exchange of information about the economic gains and losses of participating member states, thereby reducing uncertainty about the distribution of benefits. Regional institutions also present great influence in addressing issues beyond trade. Regional economic institutions help develop trade expectations for the future. ‚ÄúHigh economic stakes that states have in the continuation and growth of economic activity in the context of economic regionalism lead to a security community in which states develop a genuine interest in not only keeping peace with each other, but also defending their relationship against outside aggressors.‚Äù In addition to their role in dispute settlement, regional arrangements can deter aggressors from targeting institutionally connected states. Aydin (2010) makes an important contribution to the extended deterrence literature and economic peace research through his empirical study on the deterrent effect of economic integration. This study shows that trade has a general deterrent effect on attackers when the target is economically integrated with potential defenders through regional trade institutions. When trade is conducted in an institutionalised setting it can have political implications beyond bilateral interdependence. Research shows that economic integration decreases the opportunities to fight and enhances the opportunities to intervene in crisis. Mansfield & Pevehouse (2000, p. 776) present strong evidence that ‚Äúthe combination of PTA membership (preferential trading arrangements) and a high level of trade is quite likely to discourage belligerence.‚Äù Many PTAs have become venues for addressing political disputes between participants and fostering cooperation. Observers have widely acknowledged, for example, that ASEAN has helped to manage tensions in Southeast Asia. Mercado Comun del Sur (MERCOSUR) has done likewise, improving political-military relations throughout the southern cone. (Mansfield & Pevehouse, 2000, p. 781). The reciprocal nature of this system helps guarantee that economic concessions made by one state will be repaid, rather than exploited by its counterpart. International investment flows Another area to add to the existing literature on economic integration is the impact of militarized conflict on foreign investment. Bussman's (2010) contribution to the liberal notion that conflict inhibits foreign investment, complements the liberal peace arguments in conflict studies. Bussman's research shows that international conflict reduces international investment flows considerably. Bussman contends that ‚Äúas with trade, foreign investment could be an important factor in promoting peace. States might avoid violent conflict in order not to deter foreign investors.‚Äù By ensuring political stability, states can thus create an environment that is desirable to foreign investors. It is therefore, in the best interest of states to keep away from belligerent behaviour as they could potentially miss out on the welfare gains associated with foreign investment. As a result, states that benefit from foreign direct investment flows are less likely to experience the onset of militarized conflict.

Most passengers on this route were manual laborers, including stonecutters, locksmiths, farmers, millers, upholsterers, confectioners, and tailors, though physicians and other professionals also bought passage on her.National Archives and Records Administration Film M237, Reel 462 Building Built by Caird & Company of Greenock, Scotland, the Silesia, along with the SS Germania (I) (1863), SS Germania (II) (1870), SS Frisia (1872), SS Pomerania (1873), SS Hammonia (I) (1855), and SS Hammonia (II) (1866), was a Hammonia class ship. Some sources report her as being in length and from side to side though other contemporary sources report her as somewhat larger. With both a steam engine and a set of traditional masts, she was one of a brief but large category of \\"transitional\\" (wind-to-steam) vessels. Like many of these ships, the Silesia had a steel hull, two masts, and one steam funnel. Her two engines drove a single screw with 2,200 horsepower making 54 revolutions per minute. Twelve men shoveling coal continuously from her four coal bunkers kept her engines running around the clock, consuming 75 of her 1,100-ton capacity of coal per day. All of the steam generated in her boilers was recovered and reused during any given length of her journey. The smoke from the burning of coal quickly blackened many of her sails, which were as follows: on her foremast she had two staysails (a fore staysail and a fore topmast staysail), a course, topsail, and topgallant sail; and on her mainmast, the equivalent five sails (a staysail, topmast staysail, course, topsail, and topgallant sail) plus a spanker for a combined total of eleven sails. History She began her maiden voyage from Hamburg to Le Havre and New York on 23 June 1869. Her last voyage on this route began on 24 February 1875. After this she was fitted with a compound engine and supposedly began sailing the route from Hamburg to the West Indies, though passenger manifests continue to show her bringing immigrants to New York for many more years.National Archives and Records Administration, Film M237, Reel 446 Accounts then differ as to the path of her ownership, with some sources claiming she was given to W.G.

He was a son of John Smith, also an architect, and his mother was Margaret Grant. A partner in the Aberdonian firms J & W Smith (1845‚Äì1879), W & J Smith (1879‚Äì1887) and W & J Smith and Kelly (1887‚Äì1891), and employed as Aberdeen's superintendent of works (1852‚Äì1891), he designed a large number of buildings in north east Scotland. Ancestry and early life Smith was the fourth child of the Aberdeen architect John Smith and the grandson of builder/architect William (Sink 'em) Smith. He attended Aberdeen Grammar School and James Giles tutored him in watercolouring and sketching. He worked with his father and Robert Kerr before spending 18 months in London assisting and receiving further training from Thomas Donaldson. Between the summer of 1842 and early 1845 Smith spent almost two years travelling around Greece and Italy. Career Smith entered his father's firm as a Senior Assistant, becoming a partner in 1845. His first principal commission in Aberdeen was Trinity Hall on Union Street for the Seven Incorporated Trades of Aberdeen. The foundation of this Tudor Gothic style building ‚Äì the first of this style built on Union Street ‚Äì was laid on 9 June 1846. A prolific designer of manses, including those at Peterhead, Tarland, Methlick, St Fergus and Woodside, some of his other major commissions include Fraserburgh Prison (1845), King Street Iron Works, Aberdeen (1847), Badentoy House (1849), Drumside House (before 1852), Balmoral Castle (1852), Alexander Scott's Hospital, Huntly (1853), Miller's Institution, Thurso (1859) and the Anderson Institute, Lerwick (1860). As his father's health deteriorated, Smith assumed greater responsibility within the company and on his father's death in 1852 also took over his father's position of Aberdeen City Architect. Death and legacy On 27 September 1826 Smith married Mary Blaikie (27 September 1826 ‚Äì 21 January 1883), the daughter of a prominent Aberdeen family.

H. Krawciw () is a retired United States Army Major General who served two tours of duty in the Vietnam War, and served as Commanding General of the 3rd Infantry Division from 1987 to 1989. Early life Krawciw was born on November 28, 1935, to Bohdan and Neonila Krawciw, in Lviv, Galicia, Poland (present-day Ukraine). His family moved to Germany during World War II, and to the United States in 1949. As a youth, Nick grew up in a Philadelphia Ukrainian-American community and is able to speak the Ukrainian language. He was a member of Plast, a Ukrainian scouting organization, and attended the Bordentown Military Institute. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1955, where he played varsity soccer, became a cadet regimental commander, and was in the graduating class of 1959. Military career Krawciw was one of the first members of his class to go to Vietnam, and was severely wounded in an ambush. After recuperating, Captain Krawciw commanded a cavalry troop at Fort Hood where he co-invented an advanced armor system for ground vehicles, a composite system similar to that later incorporated into tank design. Following a tour in the Tactical Department at West Point, Major Krawciw returned to Vietnam as S-3 of the 3rd Squadron, 5th Cavalry. During a year of intense fighting along the DMZ, Nick was awarded three Silver Stars and was instrumental in devising new tactics and counter measures that frustrated a tenacious enemy. Major Krawciw was sent to Israel in 1972 as the Chief Operations Officer for the UN Truce Supervision Organization. Promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, he produced intelligence reports prior to the start of the Yom Kippur War that led to a personal commendation from the Chief of Staff of the Army, General Abrams. Nick commanded the 1st Squadron, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment in 1974, and later served at Headquarters, U.S. Army, Europe. Following a year as a Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford, Colonel Krawciw was assigned to the Training and Doctrine Command as Director of Concepts and Doctrine in combat development. Here, his work on maneuver doctrine revolutionized the way the Army fought, was organized, and was trained. Nick Krawciw's ideas influenced victories in Operation Just Cause (Panama), Operation Desert Storm, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and many important but smaller contingencies. In 1979, Colonel Krawciw returned to Germany to command the First Brigade of the 3rd Armored Division. Back home after two years in command, Nick was nominated by the Army Chief of Staff to attend the Senior Seminar of the Department of State. In 1982, he was assigned to the Army staff and then as Military Assistant to the Deputy Secretary of Defense. Promoted to Brigadier General, he returned to Germany in 1984 as Assistant Division Commander of the 3rd Infantry Division and then Executive Officer to the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe. In 1987, Major General Krawciw assumed command of the 3rd Infantry Division. His final active duty assignment was Director of NATO Policy in the Office of the Secretary of Defense in 1989‚Äì1990. Krawciw retired from the Army on July 1, 1990. Post military Since he spoke Ukrainian fluently, Nick Krawciw was urged by the United States Department of Defense to become involved in assisting the newly independent Ukraine to establish political freedom and a marketplace economy. With the approval of the U.S. government, General Krawciw met with Ukrainian officials and agreed to help them set up a non-profit, non- governmental political science institute. At the behest of the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army and the Undersecretary of Defense, Nick and his dedicated wife Christina moved to Ukraine in 1992 where, for a year, he worked to reorganize, educate, and restructure the Ukrainian military on Western lines. Beginning in 1993, as a consultant to the Secretary of Defense on Ukrainian matters, and later as Secretary of Defense Senior Military Representative to Ukraine, General Krawciw was largely responsible for converting the Ukrainian Armed Forces from a communist army that was feared throughout Europe to one that now has democratic standards. The country had not governed itself in 300 years, so there was no body of law, no democratic tradition, and a military organized on the totalitarian model with corresponding values. Nick assisted in professional development, including ethics, guided reduction of forces to appropriate levels, and identified sound leaders. Progress was slow and difficult, but ultimately effective. The culmination of his efforts was the refusal of the Ukrainian Army to disperse the Orange Revolution demonstration that ultimately overturned the fraudulent election of 2004, thus justifying the years of dedicated effort General Krawciw and other American officers had spent to achieve a democratic Army in Ukraine. Some of the programs Krawciw organized or participated in were Operation Peace Shield and Operation Sea Breeze. Nick Krawciw was instrumental in establishing educational exchange programs with the Ukrainian military, devoting many hours to sponsoring and escorting both military and civilian groups from Ukraine around the United States. In 1995, in addition to his work with Ukraine, Nick Krawciw began 10 years service as President of The Dupuy Institute; and is now Chairman of the Board. Under Nick's leadership, the Institute, dedicated to scholarly analysis of military historical trends, expanded its activity. Throughout a lifetime of distinguished service, Nick Krawciw's career has been marked by inspirational leadership and steadfast dedication to the ideals expressed in the West Point motto: \\"Duty, Honor, Country.\\" His extraordinary accomplishments in the international arena have made a lasting and invaluable contribution to the national security of the United States. Honors Awards and decorations His awards and decorations included the Silver Star (three) with two oak leaf clusters, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, the Bronze Star (four total, two for valor), and the Purple Heart. *60px Silver Star with two oak leaf clusters *60px Distinguished Flying Cross *60px Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster *60px Bronze Star *60px Purple Heart See also *Ukrainian American Veterans References Further reading * Alex Lushnycky, Ukrainians of Greater Philadelphia (2007), * Tom Carhart, West Point Warriors: Profiles of Duty, Honor, and Country in Battle (2002), External links * The Depuy Institute Category:1935 births Category:Living people Category:Bordentown Military Institute alumni Category:Military personnel from Lviv Category:American army personnel of the Vietnam War Category:Ukrainian emigrants to the United States Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:Recipients of the Silver Star Category:United States Army generals Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:United States Military Academy alumni Category:George Washington University alumni ","title":"Nicholas S.

Located on Harper Lane, Shenley, the facility was known as Harperbury Hospital for 61 years and has been a fixture of the area's mental health scene since 1928. It had two sister institutions, Shenley Hospital and Napsbury Hospital, within a few miles of its location. A scaling down process began in the 1970s, and resulted in many of the old hospital's buildings becoming abandoned. By late 2001 Harperbury had only about 200 patients and the hospital was officially closed. The new Kingsley Green mental health facility opened on the site in May 2009. History =Formation= The Royal Flying Corps, who were based at the London Colney aerodrome, used the site as an aircraft storage facility during the First World War. In 1924 Middlesex County Council purchased Porters Park Estate, totaling to create both the Harperbury and Shenley hospitals. On 25 October 1928, the new mental hospital started operations as the Hangers Certified Institution named after the three remaining aerodrome hangers on the site. The first patients were eight males who were put to the task of cleaning out the hangers, which were converted into wards for use by more patients. Soon eighty-six male patients lived and worked on the site. =Expansion= Harperbury Hospital in 2005 A series of new buildings were designed by WT Curtis and the construction, which was undertaken by constructed by John Laing & Son, commenced in 1929. The first of these new buildings opened in February 1931 and the institution housed 342 male patients by December 1931. Various additional buildings were built to provide for the daily operation of the complex. Dormitory buildings were built for the patients and the De Salis Recreational Hall was built to seat 700 people.Named after Cecil Fane De Salis. A building to house nurses was built west of the administration building. Tennis courts and sports grounds were also built. When the complex was completed in 1936, it accommodated male, female and pediatric patients. It is said at times 700 persons were employed at a time in the construction of the hospital. Once the new buildings were completed, the institution was renamed Middlesex Colony in May 1936, when the facility was officially opened by Minister of Health Sir Kingsley Wood. Middlesex Colony was designed to house about 1,354 patients. Middlesex Colony was intended to be as self-sufficient as possible, with the desire that patients capable of working would work at various tasks. Many of the male patients provided the labour for the farming ventures of the institution. Fruits and vegetables were raised and cattle, pigs and chickens were raised. Milk was even sold to Shenley Hospital. Men also worked in workshops to provide needed goods for the hospital, such as clothes, shoes, brushes and upholstery. They also performed carpentry. Female patients worked in the laundry and kitchens and helped keep the wards clean. Even pediatric patients were given duties. A school was built for the children. When the Second World War started, Middlesex Colony had 1,194 patients. In 1948 Middlesex Colony passed from control of the county council to control of the National Health Service. Eventually the territory around the institution fell under the jurisdiction of Hertfordshire County. Two years later the institution was renamed Harperbury Hospital. During the 1950s Harperbury had 1,464 beds. An annex at Hemel Hempstead had thirty more beds. The 1950s saw continued expansion at Harperbury. Four more patient villas were built, as was a residence home for male nurses. A department of clinical psychology was established to better assess mental handicaps. The school for pediatric patients was enlarged and an indoor swimming pool was built. In 1960 a cerebral palsy unit opened at Harperbury. It provided services to mental health units throughout the area, as well as at Harperbury. When Minister of Health Enoch Powell visited in 1961, he questioned the future role of large mental hospitals. Overcrowding at Harperbury was becoming a problem. By 1964 severe overcrowding had become severe. The hospital was then intended to accommodate 1,354 patients, but in fact had 1,587 patients. Beds were packed so tightly together, that sometimes nurses had problems reaching patients who needed emergency care. In spite of overcrowding, Harperbury continued to expand. In 1965 the Kennedy-Galton Centre opened to study clinical genetics and to diagnose chromosomal abnormalities in the unborn. In 1969 an activity centre was officially opened to provide a stimulating environment for patients. Up to 1973 Harperbury's expansion continued. Changes were made to use existing space better to ease overcrowding. Sometimes this involved remodeling areas. The activity centre was expanded in 1973 and a new playground was added. =Dismantlement= By the early 1970s patients were taking part in day trips to visit the shopping areas at nearby St Albans. Also, patients were encouraged to take better care of their appearance and they were encouraged to participate in sports events at the hospital and to take part in various rehabilitation groups. Musical events were held at Harperbury and severely handicapped deaf patients were taught the Makaton sign language. The wards were redecorated so that they were more attractive. Following the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, plans were introduced to close the Shenley, Napsbury and Harperbury hospitals. Patients were moved out of all three hospitals. However, in 1995 and 1998 Harperbury received a temporary influx of patients as the other two institutions closed. By late 2001 Harperbury had only about 200 patients and the old hospital was officially closed. The scaling down at Harperbury resulted in many of the old hospital's buildings becoming abandoned. In many cases much material and equipment were salvaged from the old buildings. Over the years most of the abandoned buildings were visited by vandals and other trespassers. Thieves ripped out copper wiring that on two occasions resulted in power disruptions and outages at Harperbury. Two men were arrested and charged in this incident. In May 2009 a new mental health facility was created by converting space in old buildings into what became known as the Oak and Beech Units. In July 2011 this facility was renamed Kingsley Green after Sir Kingsley Wood, the minister of health who had originally opened the site as a mental institution. Current services The site is now decentralised, with groups within the Hertfordshire Partnership University National Health Service Foundation Trust (presently abbreviated to HPFT) running various programmes on the site. The inpatient programmes consist of three units. One is a mental health facility that was created by converting space in old buildings into what is known as the Oak & Beech Units. Another programme is the Specialist Residential Service, which provides medium to long term care for 29 adults with learning disabilities and complex needs. Seven bungalows were built on Forest Lane at Harperbury. An activity service building is nearby. Another inpatient unit is the Adolescent Inpatient Unit, located in Forest House. Up to 16 twelve to seventeen year olds stay in Forest House. The programme \\"aims to provide a service which enables young people and their families to understand and cope with psychological, emotional and behavioural problems which they may be experiencing.\\" An educational facility on site also ensures that residents' educational needs are not neglected. Adolescents are referred to Forest House by the Adolescent Outreach Team. Kingsley Green houses the above mentioned Adolescent Outreach Team, which conducts its work in the outside community. Another unit providing adolescent care, the Adolescent Drug & Alcohol Service for Hertfordshire (abbreviated ADASH), is based on the Kingsley Green site. This service is geared towards those under 18 years of age who have drug or alcohol problems. ADASH provides advice, support, specialist assessment and treatment.

It is a strategy for early detection of permanent congenital hearing loss. It describes the use of objective testing methods (usually otoacoustic emission (OAE) testing or automated auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing) to screen the hearing of well newborns in a particular target region.  Overview  Even among developed countries, until the 90's, it could take years for hearing-impaired child to be diagnosed and to benefit from a health intervention and amplification. This delay still can happen in developing countries. If children are not exposed to sounds and language during their first years of life because of a hearing loss, they will have difficulty in developing spoken or signed language; cognitive development and social skills could also be affected. This screening separates children into two groups‚Äîthose with a high index of suspicion (more likely to have permanent congenital hearing loss) and those with a low index of suspicion (less likely to have permanent congenital hearing loss). Those in the first group are referred for diagnostic testing. Newborn hearing screening is becoming popular as it aims to reduce the age of detection for hearing loss‚Äîmeaning that diagnosed children can receive early intervention, which is more effective because the brain's ability to learn language (spoken, cued, or signed) reduces as the child ages. Children born with permanent congenital hearing loss have historically performed worse educationally, had poorer language acquisition, social functioning and vocational choices than their hearing peers. In order to be most effective in minimizing developmental delays and promoting communication, education and social development, timely and appropriate interventions need to follow the early identification of hearing loss. Interventions for children with permanent congenital hearing loss ranges from devices that amplify sound to devices that replace the function of a damaged inner ear to communication modalities including spoken language, sign language, and Cued Speech. The choice of interventions depends on the degree and the cause of hearing loss, accessibility, affordability and family choice. For interventions to be effective, they should be appropriate, timely, family- centered and undertaken through a coordinated interdisciplinary approach, which includes access to specialists who have the professional qualifications and specialized knowledge and skills to support and promote optimal development outcomes. Key elements for ensuring the best outcomes for children with hearing loss may include: * hearing devices, such as hearing aids, and middle ear or cochlear implants; * hearing assistive technology, such as FM/radio systems and loop systems; * therapy to develop spoken language, such as auditory-verbal therapy, cued speech and auditory-oral therapy; * development of nonverbal communication, such as sign language (see also American Sign Language). Newborn hearing screening programmes exist in many countries, including the United States, United Kingdom New Zealand, and the majority of countries making up the European Union. In order to maximize language and communication competence, literacy development, and psychosocial well-being, the U.S. Joint Committee on Infant Hearing endorses the goals that 1) all newborns should undergo hearing screening using physiologic measures prior to hospital discharge, but no later than one month of age 2) all infants whose do not pass screening should have appropriate audiologic diagnosis no later than 3 months of age and 3) all infants identified as deaf or hard of hearing in one or both ears should be referred to early targeted and appropriate intervention services as soon as possible after diagnosis, but no later than six months of age. Newborn hearing screening employs objective assessment methods, either with automated (ABR) or (OAE), or both for initial and/or rescreening procedures. =Rates of congenital hearing loss= Hearing loss in neonates is the most common congenital sensory disorder, and can be caused by a variety of reasons. Research has placed the prevalence of significant permanent hearing loss in neonates at 1‚Äì2 per 1000 live births in the United States. With this screening, many forms of congenital hearing loss can be detected. Congenital hearing loss can be due to genetic causes, environmental exposures during pregnancy, or health complications shortly after birth. Population-based studies in Europe and North America have identified a consistent prevalence of approximately 0.1% of children having a hearing loss of more than 40 decibels through review of health or education records, or both. Other international studies using different methods or criteria have reported higher estimates. In the United States, studies have shown a wide range of estimates for the number of children with hearing loss depending upon the reported age range, type, degree, frequency, laterality and method of ascertainment (e.g. audiometric testing, parental report, record review). Audiometric data of adolescents aged 12 to 19 years obtained through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) identified 3% to 5% of adolescents with hearing loss of 25 decibels or more and 15% to 20% with hearing losses of greater than 15 decibels. = Research studies = Studies have found that early diagnosis and intervention for children with hearing loss can help them develop better communication skills. Researchers have shown children with hearing loss meeting the current early identification and intervention guidelines were more likely to have enhanced vocabulary than children who did not meet EHDI 1-3-6 guidelines. Funded research projects have focused on improving EHDI process issues including improving LFU/LTD rates through at Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) certification screening visits. and exploring technologies that can be incorporated in electrophysiological testing to facilitate hearing loss diagnosis in newborns, without the use of sedation. Investigators have reported on numerous topics including the screening and diagnostic evaluations of children with unilateral and mild bilateral hearing loss, the impact of hearing loss and comorbidities, and the long-term hearing loss risk of children born with cytomegalovirus. Screening methodology Often a two-stage process occurs in the actual screening of the hearing. Children are screened with either otoacoustic emissions (OAE) or automated auditory brainstem response (AABR). Children passing the test receive no further assessment. Children who fail the initial screen are usually referred for a second screening assessment either with OAE's or AABR. Children failing this second assessment will usually be sent for diagnostic assessment of their hearing. There is some variation in procedure by region and country but most follow this basic principle. Screening personnel vary also, in some regions Audiologists are used, whereas technicians, nurses, or volunteers are used in other programs. In countries that have insufficient financial and human resources to implement hearing screening, community-based programs have used simple, behaviour-based questionnaires to identify infants with hearing loss but with limited success. =Targeted hearing screening= Targeted neonatal hearing screening describes the process by which only a specific subset of a population are screened (for instance those infants in the neonatal intensive care unit or with risk factors for hearing loss). Although the U.S. Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH) endorsed the goal of universal detection of infants with hearing loss in 1994, it modified and maintained a role for specific high risk factors described in their previous (1973, 1982 and 1990) position statements. Successes  Universal newborn hearing screening programs aim to have high coverage rates (participation) and many aim to screen babies by 1 month of age, aim to complete the diagnostic process for referred babies by three months of age, and aim to begin intervention services by six months of age. U.S. jurisdictional programs (states and territories) screened less than 3% of all newborns for hearing loss in the U.S. at the beginning of the 1990s. Data from states and territories for the early years of EHDI (1999 ‚Äì 2004) were collected using surveys conducted by the Directors of Speech and Hearing Programs in State Health and Welfare Agencies and shared with the CDC EHDI Program. Beginning in 2005, CDC obtained data through an Office of Management and Budget approved survey sent to EHDI program directors. In 1999, 22 jurisdictions estimated that less than half of all infants (46.5%) were screened for hearing loss, steadily increasing to 80.1% in 2005 85.4% in 2007, and 98.0% by 2009. The number of deaf and hard of hearing babies identified early in life in the U.S. has steadily increased from 855 in the year 2000, 2,634 in 2005 and most recently reported 6,337 in calendar year 2016. Challenges In addition to meeting the ‚Äú1-3-6‚Äù targets, one of the key challenges for newborn hearing screening programmes is to reduce 'loss to follow-up' (where a child doesn't return for the next stage of the process). The Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (US) has reported that this is a significant problem in state screening programmes in the United States and other jurisdictions. Measuring loss to follow-up is an important step in understanding and reducing it. Now that over 95% of U.S. infants are having their hearing screened, remaining challenges include ensuring timely diagnostic evaluation for those who do not pass the screening and enrollment in early intervention for those with diagnosed hearing loss. In 2005, >60% of infants who had not passed the final or most recent screening were lost-to-follow-up/lost to documentation (LFU/LTD). Some of those infants may have received audiologic evaluations, but the results not reported to the EHDI program (i.e., undocumented evaluation). By 2007, LFU/LTD among infants not passing the final or most recent screening had decreased to approximately 46% and to 35% in 2011. The LFU/LTD percent for diagnosis in 2016 was 25.4% (n = 16,522). The 2016 LFU/LTD percent for enrollment in early intervention was 19.6% (n = 1,239). Challenges to newborn hearing screening have existed for over three decades. Newborn screening alone can miss postnatal, progressive or acquired hearing loss, there is poor identification of perinatal infections, and concerns over regulatory barriers and privacy continue to this day. Many infants are lost to follow-up and many families face the challenge of navigating coordinated quality care through complex health to education systems involving multiple agencies. History In 1956, Erik Wedenberg published one of the earliest articles describing examiner use of tuning forks, percussion sounds, pitch pipes, and cowbells to screen the hearing newborn infants. The author noted, \\"until recently it has not been considered possible to carry out reliable auditory tests until the child has attained the age of 6‚Äì7 years.\\" In 1963, Marion Downs, affectionately referred to as the \\"mother of pediatric audiology\\", pioneered the first hospital based infant hearing screening program in Denver, Colorado using Behavioral Observation Audiometry (BOA). Several independent observers recorded eye-blink and/or startle responses after presentation of narrow-band (90 dB) and white noise (93 dB) stimulation. In her 1964 publication, the observers identified suspected hearing losses, although disagreements were significant for 26% of the infants. In 1969, Marion led efforts for the formation of the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH) to provide multi- disciplinary leadership and guidance in all areas of newborn and infant hearing issues. In their 1971 Position Statement, the JCIH determined the results of screening programs were inconsistent and misleading and, although recognizing the urgent need for early detection, recommended discontinuing routine behavioral hearing screening of newborn infants. In 1973 the Committee recommended that only infants with certain high risk factors have their hearing evaluated (five factors: family history; congenital perinatal infections; ear, nose or throat defects; low birthweight <1500 g; hyperbilirubinemia). In 1982, two additional risk factors were added (bacterial meningitis and birth asphyxia including low Apgar scores) and included the recommendation for BOA or physiologic screening of high-risk infants. At that time, the Committee did not recommend any specific device, although many program were successfully utilizing automated ABR for newborn screening. Despite efforts and endorsements, the growth of high-risk screening in the United States was very slow. In 1984, high-risk hearing registries only included an estimated 15 percent of the nation's newborn population and likely, that less than half of those infants had their hearing assessed. Other weaknesses identified that a restricted risk register will excludes approximately 50 percent of infants with hearing impairment. In 1989 Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, perhaps most remembered for his work related to abortion, tobacco, and AIDS, called for increased efforts to identify congenital hearing loss within the first year of life. In his words ‚ÄúIt's a tall order, yes, but if we all work together, I believe we can fill it.\\" In 1990, the JCIH added more 3 risk factors (ototoxic medication, prolonged mechanical ventilation, syndromic stigmata) for a total of ten. Congressman James T. Walsh (R-NY) sponsored and introduced the first attempt at federal legislation with the Hearing Loss Testing Act of 1991 requiring the hearing testing of every child born in the United States at the time of birth and establishing uniform standards for such testing. Although the Committee on Energy and Commerce referred this legislation to subcommittee, Congressman Walsh continued to promote legislation throughout that decade as the co- founder and co-chair of the Congressional Hearing Health Caucus. In 1993, the National Institutes of Health Consensus statement initiated the concept of ‚Äú1-3-6‚Äù as the monthly milestones for screening, diagnosis and intervention. Between 1993 and 1996, the National Center for Hearing Assessment and Management at Utah State University conducted the Rhode Island Hearing Assessment Project (RIHAP), which demonstrated the feasibility of using transient OAEs for universal screening. In 1994, both the JCIH and the DSHPSHWA endorsed universal newborn hearing screening. In 1996, the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms and assigned an ‚ÄúI Statement‚Äù grade for newborn hearing screening. All Us States participate in Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) Programs. The ‚Äúbirth of EHDI‚Äù may be attributed to passage of the Children's Health Act of 2000 which included language from Walsh's proposed legislation and authorized the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Health Resources and Services AdministrationA, to establish ‚Äústatewide newborn and infant hearing screening evaluation and intervention programs and systems.‚Äù Congress provided HRSA with the authority to support statewide services and CDC with the authority to provide technical assistance for data management and applied research. In addition, the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders at NIH provided authority to continue a program of research and development on the efficacy of new screening techniques and technology. The year 2000 Position Statement of the JCIH provided the Principles and Guidelines for Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Programs. In 2006, the HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (SACHDNC) included newborn hearing as one of the conditions to be included in their Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP). With growing research evidence, in 2007 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended screening of hearing loss in all newborn infants with an assigned ‚ÄúB grade.‚Äù By 2010, 43 states enacted legislative statutes or written regulatory language related to universal newborn hearing screening. The ‚Äúelectronic age of EHDI‚Äù may have begun during the next decade. The Quality, Research, and Public Health (QRPH) Planning and Technical Committees of Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise published a series of EHDI technical documents. These profiles promote the automated collection and communication exchange of EHDI data between clinical and public health information systems (results, demographics, care plans, quality measures). The U.S. National Library of Medicine maintains the Newborn Screening Coding and Terminology Guide to promote and facilitate the use of electronic health data standards in recording and transmitting newborn screening test results. This includes EHDI standard vocabulary codes and terminologies, including Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC¬Æ), Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine ‚Äî Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT¬Æ). The National Quality Forum the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and the Joint Commission for hospital accreditation have endorsed and/or supported adoption of EHDI electronic quality measures. EHDI-PALS (Pediatric Audiology Links to Services) provides web-based link to information, resources, and services for children with hearing loss. In 2018, Health Level 7 (HL7) approved the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) Implementation Guide as a Normative Standard.

Life He was born in Ioannina, a center of the 17th‚Äì18th-century modern Greek Enlightenment movement. Balanos was the first son of the scholar Balanos Vasilopoulos and became a priest like his father had done before him. He taught at various Greek-language schools of the Ottoman Empire, initially in Thessaly, and then in Thessaloniki. Around 1760 he succeeded his father as director of the Gouma School in Ioannina.ŒúœÄŒ±ŒªŒ¨ŒΩŒøœÇ ŒöŒøœÉŒºŒ¨œÇ 1731, ŒôœâŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒπŒΩŒ± ‚Äì 1807/8, ŒôœâŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒπŒΩŒ± ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒøŒºŒΩŒÆŒºœâŒΩ. University of Athens database. During the 1790s, the Gouma school faced serious financial difficulties, but Balanos managed to find new sponsors among the prosperous Ioannite diaspora and especially the Zosimades brothers. After about 40 years in the Gouma school, Balanos left his post in 1799 to his brother Konstantinos. Balanos, as a conservative scholar, used archaic Greek in his work and rejected the use of the Demotic, the vernacular form of the Greek language. He also became involved in a personal conflict with the progressive scholar Athanasios Psalidas, schoolmaster of the Kaplaneios School in the same city, whom he denounced to the local ruler, Ali Pasha, as an atheist and voltairianist.

Balanos also wrote various texts about the social conditions of the region he lived, like describing the forced 18th century Islamizations of local Christians by the Ottoman authorities. Moreover, he composed theological and philosophical works, as well as school textbooks. Many of these works remained unpublished and were burned with the destruction of the Balanos family library during Ali Pasha's defeat by the Sultan's forces in 1822.

The R-6H was dogged with bad luck throughout its career and had the unfortunate distinction of never finishing any race it entered. Development Q.E.D. being prepared for the MacRobertson Air Race that it was built for. Design work on the Gee Bee R-6 had begun in 1933, but the firm went bankrupt shortly afterwards in October 1933. Then, on 11 February 1934, Zanford Granville died in Spartanburg, South Carolina, when he crashed in the Gee Bee Model E Sportster he was delivering. This aircraft was intended to finance a new company to be based in New York called Granville, Miller & De Lackner. The R-6H would eventually be completed for Floyd B. Odlum, on behalf of Jacqueline Cochran for the MacRobertson Air Race in 1934. The touring aircraft was designed with large fuel tanks to handle the long legs needed for the England to Australia race. A Curtiss Conqueror was the engine preferred by Cochran, but Curtiss-Wright was unable to deliver one in time, and the Pratt & Whitney Hornet originally intended for the design was substituted to make the race delivery date. Design R-6H XB- AKM Conquistador del Cielo showing the later simplified flaps The Gee Bee R-6 shares the same general shape and overall design as the better known Granville Gee Bee R-1 Super Sportster racer, but was nearly larger in span and length. As built the aircraft was powered by a Pratt & Whitney Hornet 9-cylinder air cooled radial engine enclosed in a NACA cowling.Mendenhall, 1979, p.99 The wings were built around a pair of spruce spars, with the front spars split into upper and lower beams while the rear spars were a single beam. Ribs were also spruce, and the entire wing was skinned with plywood and braced to the fuselage and undercarriage with streamlined wires.Mendenhall, 1979, p.98-99 Split flaps that functioned somewhat similar to Zap flaps with an extra hinge line mid-chord were installed between the ailerons and the fuselage. After problems with these during the MacRobertson Air Race, they were redesigned without the extra hinge. The fuselage form followed an ideal teardrop shape calculated to minimize drag and was built up from welded chromium-molybdenum alloy steel tubes with plywood formers and spruce stringers.Mendenhall, 1979, p.100 This was then covered with sheet aluminium panels forward, and fabric covering aft. The fin was integral with the fuselage structure, while the rudder and cantilevered elevators were constructed in a similar manner to the wings with a plywood covering. Tandem cockpits provided space for two under an extended greenhouse canopy. Although most contemporaries were already moving to retractable undercarriage, the R-6 persisted with the spatted and faired units common to their previous designs, although to save time, the actual gear legs were borrowed from the Curtiss A-12 Shrike.Mendenhall, 1979, p.100 Operational history Q.E.D. with race number 77 for the 1934 Bendix Q.E.D. during the 1935 Bendix Races R-6H ready for 1938 Bendix Race with race number 61 Francisco Sarabia with the Conquistador del Cielo =1934 Bendix Race= While enroute to the race at Des Moines, Iowa Lee Gehlbach had the cowling come loose and it pulled into the prop. He continued without the cowling and a new modified one was dispatched but the replacement suffered the same fate during the race and he was forced to drop out.Mendenhall, 1979, p.101 =1934 MacRobertson Air Race= After having their entry delayed because the British authorities had trouble accepting the limited amount of testing the R-6H had undergone was adequate for a commercial aircraft, and enduring insults in the British press (who dubbed it the HeeBee GeeBee), Jacqueline Cochran and Wesley Smith made it as far as Bucharest, the end of their first leg in the bright green and orange Q.E.D., when a malfunctioning flap and a damaged stabilizer delayed them until they were forced to drop out.Mendenhall, 1979, p.104 =1935 Bendix Race= Royal Leonard was forced down with an engine failure and had to land in Wichita, Kansas, shortly after the Gee Bee R-1/R-2 Hybrid Intestinal Fortitude disintegrated in flight, killing its pilot.Mendenhall, 1979, p.108 =1936 Thompson Trophy race= Despite most of the major contenders having dropped out before the race, Lee Miles was forced down with an engine failure on lap 11 of 15, after lagging behind Michel D√©troyat's winning Caudron C.460.Mendenhall, 1979, p.118 The aircraft was then stored in Tucson, Arizona. =1938 Bendix Race= After being bought by aircraft dealer Charles Babb, the aircraft was repainted cream overall with a green stripe, and fitted with a more powerful Pratt & Whitney Hornet with a 14:1 supercharger. While being flown by George Armisted to the race it suffered another engine failure but was relatively undamaged,Mendenhall, 1979, pp.123 & 126 However, his troubles were not over as during the race, oil temperatures soared, he lost oil pressure, was experiencing icing and his radio failed all of which ended his run in Winslow, Arizona.Mendenhall, 1979, p.127 =1939 Mexico City to New York City record flight= Francisco Sarabia set a record for a non-stop flight from Mexico City to New York City in 10 hours and 47 minutes on 24 May. He had bought the R-6H from Babb in late September 1938 and repainted it bright white with a red fuselage stripe, with the Mexican registration XB-AKM, and renamed it the Conquistador del Cielo.Mendenhall, 1979, p.130-131 =1939 Return flight= While Francisco Sarabia was taking off with a full fuel load for the return flight to Mexico from Bolling Airfield in Washington D.C., and in full view of his family, his engine failed due to an oily rag having been sucked into the carburettor intake, and he plummeted into the Potomac River, where he was trapped by the collapsed cockpit structure and died before his aircraft could be extricated from the mud of the river bed.Mendenhall, 1979, p.135 The wreckage of his aircraft was recovered and brought back to M√©rida, Yucat√°n where it was placed in a museum. A Mexican postage stamp was issued in his honor in 2000, featuring a picture of Sarabia and the Conquistador del Cielo Conquistidor del Cielo at the Museo Francisco Sarabia Survivor/Aircraft on display The sole surviving Gee Bee racer, the Conquistador del Cielo underwent a major restoration in Mexico City in 1972, and is on display at a museum built specifically to honor Francisco Sarabia, the Museo Francisco Sarabia, located in Ciudad Lerdo. A replica of the R-6H with considerable modifications from the original, including using a Wright R-1820 Cyclone was built and first flew on 26 September 2013.

Span was smaller, while the length was shorter, most noticeably around the firewall. Like the R-6, the R-5 was to have been fitted with flaps, while access to the cockpit would have been through a large door on the fuselage side as on previous racers, rather than through the canopy. ;Gee Bee R-6C (Conqueror): Unbuilt version with a supercharged Curtiss Conqueror V-12 inline water-cooled engine.

Newly described in 2009, the genus contains two species: S. thailandica and S. squarepantsii. The type species S. thailandica is known only from Khao Yai National Park in central Thailand, where it grows in soil in old-growth forests dominated by dipterocarp trees. The rubbery fruit bodies, which has a strong odour of coal-tar similar to Tricholoma sulphureum, consists of numerous internal cavities lined with spore-producing tissue. S. squarepantsii, described as new to science in 2011, is found in Malaysia. It produces sponge-like, rubbery orange fruit bodies with a fruity or musky odour. These fruit bodies will‚Äîlike a sponge‚Äîresume their original shape if water is squeezed out. The origin of the specific name derives from its perceived resemblance to the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants. Apart from differences in distribution, S. squarepantsii differs from S. thailandica in its colour, odour, and spore structure. Description The fruit bodies of Spongiforma species have a brain-like to sponge-like form, and grow on the surface of the ground. They do not have a stalk, and lack a layer of outer skin. The small cavities (locules) of the fruit body are irregular in outline and measure between in diameter. They are lined with a smooth, greyish-orange to brown or reddish brown hymenium (spore-bearing tissue), with sterile ridges that range in colour from white to cream. The columella (a column-like structure extending up into the fruit body) is poorly developed, pear-shaped, cream-coloured, and attached at the base to white rhizomorphs. The basidiospores are brown to vinaceous-brown in mass, almond-shaped, bilaterally symmetrical, and finely wrinkled. Spores bear a central apiculus (a region that was once attached to the sterigmata at the end of a basidium) and a small apical pore. The spores are reddish-brown in water, violet grey in 3% potassium hydroxide, inamyloid, and cyanophilic (turning red in the stain acetocarmine). The basidia are four-spored, and do not discharge the spores forcibly. Cystidia are common on the sterile locule edges; they are hyaline (translucent) and range in shape from cylindrical to ventricose (swollen in the middle) or rostrate (with a beaklike proboscis). The hyphae of the flesh are gelatinous and inamyloid. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae. Taxonomy and naming The type species S. thailandica was first described scientifically in 2009 by Egon Horak, Timothy Flegel and Dennis E. Desjardin, based on specimens collected in July 2002 in Khao Yai National Park, central Thailand, and roughly three years later in the same location. Before this, S. thailandica had been reported and illustrated in a 2001 Thai publication as an unidentified species of Hymenogaster. S. squarepantsii was first described scientifically in 2011 in the journal Mycologia, authored by a team headed by Desjardin with Kabir Peay, and Thomas Bruns. The description was based on two specimens collected by Bruns in 2010 in Lambir Hills National Park, in Sarawak, Malaysia. The species was first mentioned in the scientific literature in 2010 in a study of the ectomycorrhizal mushrooms in a tropical dipterocarp rainforest in Lambir Hills, although it was not formally described in this publication. The genus name Spongiforma refers to the sponge-like nature of the fruit body. The specific epithet thailandica denotes the country in which the type species is found; the epithet squarepantsii honors the well- known cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants. The unusual epithet garnered the species attention in the popular press. Phylogeny and classification Molecular analysis of the DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (IT) region of S. thailandica showed that the species was part of the Boletineae, one of several lineages of Boletales recognized taxonomically at the level of suborder. The similarity between S. thailandica and S. squarepantsii was confirmed with molecular analysis, which showed a 98% match between large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences of the two‚Äîa value typical of many species in the same genus of Boletaceae. Spongiforma is sister (sharing a common ancestor) to the genus Porphyrellus; Spongiforma and Porphyrellus form a clade that is sister to Strobilomyces. All three genera are members of the family Boletaceae. The phylogenetic relationships determined by molecular techniques are not consistent with a classification scheme based on similarities in spore morphology. Several bolete taxa have been proposed to accommodate species with reddish-brown to vinaceous-brown, finely wrinkled (rugulose) to perforated or punctate spores; these include Boletus subgenus Tylopilus, Tylopilus subgenus Porphyrellus, Austroboletus, or Porphyrellus. Austroboletus tristis and A. longipes, two species from Southeast Asia, share several spore characteristics with Spongiforma thailandica. All three species have spores with rugulose surfaces, sometimes with minute punctures, and the spores turn purple in potassium hydroxide. Additionally, the pores from the three species share similar surface ornamentation visible with scanning electron microscopy. In contrast to Spongiforma, however, Austroboletus spores do not have an apical pore. Genetic analysis shows that Spongiforma is more closely allied with the smooth-spored Porphyrellus than with the rugulose- punctate-spored Austroboletus. Spores of S. squarepantsii; scale bar = 10 Œºm Relatively few boletes have an apical pore at the distal end of their basidiospores. The dark reddish-brown, smooth spores of Porphyrellus amylosporus are truncate with a thin-walled depression. Some species of Heimioporus have spores with apical pores, but molecular analyses demonstrate that Heimioporus is only distantly related to Spongiforma. Spongiforma further resembles Austroboletus and Porphyrellus species in the cellular structure of the cap cuticle (pileipellis). The arrangement, known as a trichodermium, features the outermost hyphae emerging roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the surface of the fruit body. The trichodermium comprises chains of short, cylindrical to somewhat moniliform cells (resembling a string of beads) with terminal (end) cells that are cylindrical to club-shaped. This cellular arrangement is similar to that present in the sterile edges of the tissues that demarcate the locules in Spongiforma. According to Desjardins and colleagues, this may represent vestiges of what was once cap cuticle or peridial tissue in an ancestor. Spongiforma is the only genus of the Boletales that forms above-ground fruit bodies that lack a peridium and have many exposed locules lined with basidia that do not forcibly discharge spores. Ecology, habitat and distribution Both species of Spongiforma are known only from their original collection locations. S. thailandica was found growing on the ground in an old growth forest in Khao Yai National Park (Nakhon Nayok Province, Thailand), at an elevation of about . The fungus is thought to grow in a mycorrhizal association with Shorea henryana and Dipterocarpus gracilis, species considered to be endangered and critically endangered, respectively, by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Spongiforma squarepantsii was collected from the ground where it was growing solitarily under undetermined dipterocarp trees in Lambir Hills National Park (Sarawak State, Malaysia), northern Borneo. This tropical rainforest receives about of rain yearly, with average temperatures ranging from . Spongiforma species have lost the ability to eject their spores forcefully, and have distinctive odours, suggesting that the fungus relies on the activity of animals to help disperse spores. Because the island habitat of the genus restricts gene flow and because the two known species are separated by considerable distance geographically, the authors suggest that other unexplored, isolated tracts of dipterocarp forests between Thailand and Malaysia may contain additional species.

Career Self was born in Calico Bottoms, Phillips County, Arkansas, one of four children, and started playing guitar as a child, often performing with his friend C.W. Gatlin. In 1955, after playing on radio station Kxjk in Forrest City, Arkansas, disc jockey Hal Webber encouraged him to make a recording of his song \\"Easy to Love\\". The demo recording then found its way to Sam Phillips of Sun Records, who invited him to audition. Mack Self at Rockabilly Hall of Fame Self's first recordings were not released, but Phillips encouraged him to write more songs. He returned to the recording studio in March 1957 to work with producer Jack Clement, and re-recorded \\"Easy to Love\\" along with several new songs on which he was backed by guitarist Therlow Brown and bass player Jimmy Evans. \\"Easy to Love\\" was then released in 1957 as Sun 273, but by that time its style was regarded as somewhat old- fashioned and it was not a hit. However, Self returned to the recording studio in 1959, and released a second single, \\"Mad At You\\" / \\"Willie Brown\\". He continued to perform despite his lack of recording success, and in the early 1960s recorded several country singles for the Zone label in Memphis with producer Chips Moman.

These migrants belonged both to the first and second wave of 19th century US migration and were from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Although ethnicity was not the sole category by which Austro-Hungarian migrants associated, it is a practical guideline to order them because mostly language was and is an important criterion. In many cases though, ethnic definitions (like in the South Slav case) were not clear. Some organizations merged and split on ethnic grounds, others co-operated across ethnic definitions. Therefore, some organizations are listed under several categories. Usually, Austro-Hungarian migrant organizations in the US were mutual benefit societies and working class oriented, and many turned eventually into life insurance companies. Some were rather political, others initiated by interested parties in the so-called homeland (Austria-Hungary or one of its regions).  Austrian  Burgenlaendische Gemeinschaft Sons of Hermann.

Interest in the sport dates back earlier than 1860, which saw the establishment of the country's first official cricket ground, but it wasn't until 2003 that Brazil became a member of the International Cricket Council and emerged onto the world stage. Since then, cricket has become increasingly popular among native Brazilians, with the formation of a women's team and several junior competitions. History Cricket in Brazil began in the mid-1800s in Rio de Janeiro, during a period when a substantial portion of the city's population was British or of British descent. By the early 1860s, a number of cricket clubs were in operation, including the British CC, Artisan Amateurs CC, Rio British CC, Anglo-Brazilian CC and the British and American Club, although its playing facilities were limited to makeshift open spaces. Rio's Brazilian residents at the time had little or no interest in sport of any kind. Beginning in 1860, as part of a much-needed beautification programme for the city, Emperor Dom Pedro II created several new parks, including a large grassed area in front of his daughter Princess Isabel's house, on Rua Paysandu in the Laranjeiras district. Due to good relations between the British community and the Brazilian monarchy, this space eventually became the country's first proper cricket ground, and hosted cricket, tennis and bowls matches for many years. Princess Isabel and her father were frequent spectators, and often called upon to present trophies to the winners. In 1872, George Cox formed the Rio Cricket Club, which soon began using the field as its home. In 1901, George's son Oscar organized football games on this same ground. In 1889, Brazil became a Republic and Princess Isabel was forced to move from her residence. The cricket ground was taken over by the new government, and although the sport was allowed to continue for a time, a permanent facility was now required. In 1897, the newly renamed Rio Cricket and Athletic Association purchased a large property in Niter√≥i, on the other side of Guanabara Bay. A cricket ground was built and hosted its first match on 19 June 1898. Cricket would continue to be played on this ground for the next 97 years. As the local British population declined steadily through the 1970s and 1980s, however, cricket at the club faded away, and today the Rio Cricket ground is used exclusively for football. During those early days of cricket in Rio de Janeiro, the sport was also springing up at British sports clubs elsewhere in the country, including: the S√£o Paulo Athletic Club in S√£o Paulo (founded in 1888); the Santos Athletic Club in S√£o Paulo (1889); Clube Internacional de Cricket and Club de Cricket Victoria, both in Salvador, Bahia (both founded in 1899); and the British Country Club in Recife, Pernambuco (1920). Teams and grounds were also created at the British-owned Morro Velho mine just outside Belo Horizonte in Minas Gerais (1887), and at the Frigor√≠fico Anglo plant in Barretos, S√£o Paulo (1913), where cricket was played until the mid-1990s. Cricket was also played at the Fazenda dos Ingleses in Caraguatatuba, on the coast of S√£o Paulo, from 1927 until the Second World War. It was in S√£o Paulo, however, where the sport really took hold, and the S√£o Paulo Athletic Club (SPAC) remains the country's centre of cricket to this day. In 1894, Charles Miller, the Brazilian-born son of British parents, returned from his studies in England with a football and some cricket equipment, which he immediately used to introduce these sports to the locals. In 1888, the S√£o Paulo Athletic Club was formed, and Charles was a key member, organizing S√£o Paulo's first football and cricket matches at the club's ground in the Consola√ß√£o district. Football soon caught on, and Charles is known throughout the country as the father of Brazilian football. From 1928 to 1947 the club's cricket matches were held at a ground in Pirituba, before moving to the current site in Veleiros (Santo Amaro), which also houses a collection of Brazilian cricket memorabilia. Revival and Governing Body In 1922, the Brazil Cricket Association (BCA) was formed, with R.A. Brooking as its first President. The member clubs were Rio Cricket, the Pernambuco Athletic Club, Santos Athletic Club, S√£o Paulo Athletic Club and the Paysandu Cricket Club. The BCA helped continue the series of matches that had been held between these clubs for many years, as well as interstate and international games. In fact, matches between S√£o Paulo and Rio began in 1878 and continued regularly until 1995. As cricket in Rio de Janeiro faded from the scene, it was left to S√£o Paulo to carry the torch until 1989, when the Bras√≠lia Cricket (BCC) was formed, which today fields three men's teams and two women's teams. In 1999 in Curitiba, Paran√°, British bank HSBC built a cricket ground at its staff sports facility, which is now home to three men's teams, while S√£o Paulo has three men's teams as well. To keep pace with this rejuvenation of cricket activity in Brazil, the national Associa√ß√£o Brasileira de Cricket (ABC) was founded in 2001, and Brazil became an Affiliate Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2003.ICC Members, International Cricket Council. The ABC's continuing goal is to grow the sport throughout the country, particularly among Brazilians themselves. Since joining the ICC, cricket in Brazil has grown steadily, thanks primarily to financial and technical support from the ICC. International competition Matches between Brazil and Argentina began in 1888, while Rio Cricket began a series of matches with Club Atl√©tico River Plate from Montevideo, Uruguay in 1902. The old Brazil Cricket Association continued to stage matches with Argentina for many years, with Charles Miller playing for the Brazil team until the 1920s. Brazil also hosted the New Zealand XI in the mid-1970s. With the creation of the South American Championships (SAC) in 1995, Brazilian cricket entered its modern era. The national team has since participated in all eight SACs, hosting the event for the first time in April 2009 (SAC8). In other non-ICC international matches, Brazil has hosted the Chilean team twice (2000 and 2003), the Mexican team once (2009), and the MCC twice (1978 and 2007). In 2006, Brazil qualified to join the ICC World Cricket League - a pathway to the ICC Cricket World Cup. Brazil competed in the inaugural ICC Americas Division 3 tournament in Suriname in 2006, as well as in Buenos Aires in 2008 and Santiago in 2009. Brazil won its first ICC tournament at the Americas Division 3 championship in Santiago, Chile in October 2009. As a result of winning this event, Brazil was promoted to Division 2 of the Americas WCL. Unfortunately its first participation in Division 2 in the Bahamas in February resulted in four straight losses and a return to Division 3. Historically, the national team has consisted solely of expatriates, but this is changing. In recent years, the number of Brazilian cricketers representing their country has steadily increased. The winning Brazil squad in Santiago, for example, included six Brazilian-born players. Domestic competition The Brazil national league is made up of nine teams, which compete for the Commonwealth Ambassador's Trophy. The teams are as follows: Candangos, Bras√≠lia and Pakistan Plus from the state of Distrito Federal, the Sao Paulo Indians, SPAC and Sao Paulo from Sao Paulo state, while the state of Paran√° is represented by Swadisht, Gralha Azul and Parana. Since 2000, Sao Paulo has won five league titles, while Bras√≠lia has won twice and Paran√° once. Teams play 40-over-a-side matches from March to October. In November each year, a Twenty20 tournament between the three state representative sides is held. This tournament rotates from year to year between the three major cities. In addition to this competition, Saquarembo CC is a Sao Paulo-based group of former Brazil players which plays just a few exhibition matches a year against Rest of the World (SP). Development programme With Brazil's entry into the ICC came the creation of junior development programmes in Bras√≠lia, Sao Paulo and Curitiba. In Bras√≠lia, a big breakthrough came when cricket was offered as an accredited PE course at the national University of Bras√≠lia. This led to the formation of the Candangos team, made up wholly of Brazilians. It also created interest amongst female students and resulted in the beginnings of women's cricket in Bras√≠lia. In terms of junior development, there is a growing number of boys participating in regular training sessions and games, giving the core of a future U17s team. In Sao Paulo, progress is being made through a working relationship between St Paul's School and SPAC (the Sao Paulo Athletic Club). Enthusiastic people are in place to develop children's cricket further in Sao Paulo. In Curitiba the focus has been on teaching children aged 8‚Äì12. The Associa√ßao Brasileira de Cricket employed a local junior development officer/coach for three years, and the success of the programme, which works with about 300 kids at four schools, was recognized by the ICC through the Volunteer of the Year Award presented to Norman Baldwin and to the programme itself for Best Junior Development Programme. This ongoing programme provided the platform for a very successful U13s tournament held in July 2009 in Curitiba, played between Argentina, the eventual winners, Chile and Brazil. In addition to these three main centres of cricket, there are promising signs of life in the northern city of Fortaleza, and most recently, in Rio de Janeiro, the original home of Brazilian cricket. Development programmes are planned for these cities with a view towards increasing the number of teams in the domestic competition in the near future. To help ensure the continuity and raise the level of the games, coaching, umpiring and scoring courses are being run throughout the year in all three cities, conducted by the coaches and umpires who have received ICC training. At present there are more than 20 level-one umpires. In terms of facility development, Brazil is a little behind some of the other countries in the region. In Curitiba, the HSBC ground is very scenic and has a net, but is too small for ICC tournaments. In Bras√≠lia, there is still a need for a proper- sized, permanent ground, though the club does have two permanent nets at the Australian embassy. In Sao Paulo, where SAC8 was held, there have been a number of improvements at the full-size SPAC ground, including a new portable net. Women's cricket Since the success of the University of Bras√≠lia PE cricket course, women's cricket has grown steadily in Bras√≠lia. In 2007, there was a three-match series in Curitiba against an Argentina XI. Then in late January 2009, the Brazil team visited Buenos Aires for a return series. While Brazil was able to win only the one match, both series were closely contested. The improvement in the women's team was noted in Buenos Aires and led to their invitation to play in the ICC Americas Women's Championship in Miami in May 2009. While unable to win any matches at this championship, the team was very competitive and earned the praise of all who witnessed how much they the players have achieved in such a short time. However, the Brazil Women's National Cricket team went on to win the South American Women's Cricket Championships in 2015 in Santiago, Chile for the first time in the history of Brazilian Women's cricket.

A lot of men don't have an extra $1,500 to rent an apartment. So the Fellowship house does that for those who are part of the Fellowship.\\" (In 2002, the LA Times reported that rent was $600 per month for each resident and meals cost extra, but cleaning is provided by eight college-age volunteers from the Fellowship and a \\"house mother\\" who washes the congressmen's sheets and towels.)

Controversy C Street has been the subject of controversy over its claimed tax status as a church, the ownership of the property and its connection to the Fellowship, and the reportedly subsidized benefits the facility provides to members of Congress. Until 2009, C Street was exempt from real property taxes because it was classified as a \\"special purpose\\" use as a church. District of Columbia law exempts from taxation \\"buildings belonging to religious corporations or societies\\" which meet certain criteria. In August 2009, the property was reclassified. A DC city official said \\"it was determined that portions are being rented to private individuals for residential purposes. As a result, the exemption was partially revoked and adjusted so that only 34 percent is now tax-exempt and 66 percent has become taxable.\\" In February 2010, the president of the Fellowship, Richard Carver, told The Columbus Dispatch that his \\"charitable organization\\" does not own the C Street Center \\"and has no control over its policy.\\" Carver added he does not know who owns or runs the center: \\"It is simply not a part of anything we do.\\" In response to Carver's statement, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow produced an official Corrective Deed of September 23, 2009 for C Street signed on behalf of C Street Center, Inc. by Marty B.

The Medici-Laurentian Atlas, also known simply as the Medici Atlas (and other variants, e.g. \\"Laurenziano Gaddiano\\", \\"Laurentian Portolano\\", \\"Atlante Mediceo\\" or \\"Laurentian Atlas\\"), is an anonymous 14th-century set of maps, probably composed by a Genoese cartographer and explicitly dated 1351, although most historians believe it was composed, or at least retouched, later. The atlas is currently held by the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana in Florence, Italy.  Background  The author of the Medici-Laurentian atlas is unknown, save that he comes from the Liguria region of Italy (probably Genoese), and might have composed it for a Florentine owner. The atlas is explicitly dated 1351 (as per its astronomical calendar), but scholars believed it was more likely composed around 1370, possibly from earlier material, and probably amended further later, with emendations as late as 1425‚Äì50.The existence of the Medici Atlas was announced and described in Theobald Fischer (1886: pp. 127‚Äì147).Portolano Laurenziano Gaddiano by Henry Davis. Consulted 10 June 2011.] A 1370 date would place it in between the Pizzigani brothers map of 1367 and the Catalan Atlas of 1375, both of which share elements of the Medici-Laurentian map, although it is impossible to tell exactly if it preceded or followed them.Armando Cortes√£o (1954 (1975):p. 78) It is also contemporaneous with the Libro del Conoscimiento, a fantastical travelogue by an unknown Castilian author, believed to have been written sometime between 1350 and 1399, with which it shares many significant geographic features. The book's author may have inspired, or have been inspired by, the Medici-Laurentian atlas.Beazley The Atlas is currently held by the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana in Florence, Italy (Gaddi. Rel. 9).  Features  The Medici-Laurentian atlas is composed of eight sheets. The first sheet is an astronomical calendar, the second sheet contains an unusual world map, the third, fourth and fifth sheets compose a typical 14th-century portolan chart (covering Europe, North Africa, the Mediterranean and Black Seas), the sixth, seventh and eighth sheets are specialized charts of the Aegean Sea, Adriatic Sea and Caspian Sea. = World map = The second sheet, the world map, is the one that has attracted most attention. If the original date 1351 is true, that would make it the first (extant) map to incorporate the travel reports of Marco Polo and Ibn Batuta. It shows Asia up to India, marking places like the Delhi Sultanate and others with reasonable accuracy. The atlas also shows the Caspian as a closed sea (unusual for maps of that time). Among the most startling features is its depiction of the recognizable shape of the continent of Africa with remarkable prescience. Nearly a century before the Portuguese age of discovery, the Medici atlas draws the bend of the Gulf of Guinea and shows that Africa has a southern end, i.e. that the Atlantic and Indian Oceans are connected to each other below the African continent. While the remarkable shape of Africa has given rise to speculative theories about ancient sailing and secret voyages, the explanation is probably more mundane. The probable source of the \\"Guinea bend\\" is the legend of the Sinus Aethiopicus, the rumor of a gulf that lay somewhere south of Cape Bojador that was said to penetrate deeply into the African continent. This gulf is described in the fantastical travelogue of the Libro del Conoscimiento (possibly as early as 1350)Libro del Conoscimiento (1877: p. 60) and finds itself again in the Fra Mauro map (1459), well before it was discovered by Portuguese explorers. The notion that the West African coast did not extend straight south but took a sharp eastward bend, could be a hazy reference to the actual Gulf of Guinea, but more probably it was just a lucky guess and a bit of wishful thinking. (Historian RussellRussell (2000: p. 122) notes that the Portuguese Prince Henry the Navigator was entranced by the legend of the Sinus Aethiopicus, as it held out the prospect of a direct sea route around West Africa to the Christian kingdom of Prester John (Ethiopian Empire), avoiding the complications of travelling through the Muslim lands of Egypt to reach it. In the Medici Atlas, the depth of the penetration of the Sinus indeed almost reaches Ethiopia.) As for the southward extension of the East African coast, uncommon for European maps, this was probably drawn from Arab sources, who would have known of the commercial traffic down the Muslim Swahili coast to Sofala. Finally, the connection between the two oceans under South Africa just ratifies the old assumption (from Biblical and Classical authority) that all the world's great water bodies were connected to each other. An Africa surrounded by water is already found on other maps (e.g. Pietro Vesconte's c. 1320 mappa mundi). Long before the Medici map, the Vivaldi brothers of Genoa, in 1291, had tried to sail down the west African coast, with the explicit objective of trying to find a sea route to Asia. The imaginary nature of Africa's shape in the Medici map is almost proven by noticing there are no names or details given below Cape Bojador. The great exception is the legendary \\"River of Gold\\", the \\"western Nile\\" of Arab sources (i.e. the Senegal River, assumed connected to the Niger River, flowing through the heart of the gold-producing Mali Empire). This is the same Palolus river as in the Pizzigani brothers map of 1367.Beazley (1899: cxxv) If one elects to date the Medici Atlas before the Pizzigani, then this is the first European map depicting that all-important river. = Atlantic islands = The Medici Atlas is also important for the history of the north Atlantic islands. It is probably the first map to benefit from the 1341 mapping expedition to the Canary Islands, sponsored by King Afonso IV of Portugal and commanded by the Florentine Angiolino del Tegghia de Corbizzi and the Genoese Nicoloso da Recco. The expedition is said to have visited thirteen Canary islands (seven major and six minor).The 1341 expedition is related by Giovanni Boccaccio \\"De Canaria et insula reliquis, ultra Ispaniam, in occeano noviter repertis\\" (repr. in Monumenta Henricina, vol. I, pp. 202‚Äì06.) The Medici Atlas shows most of the main Canary islands, excellently delineated (if not yet fully named), greatly improving upon the couple in the 1339 Angelino Dulcert map. The Medici Atlas shows also for the first time, and almost correctly placed, the Madeira archipelago, with their modern names: Porto sto (Porto Santo), I. de lo Legname (Madeira, legname is Ligurian for \\"wood\\") and I dexerta (Desertas). The Madeira archipelago will not be officially discovered by the Portuguese until c. 1420. These names could have been in the original, or retouched later - although these same names were already given in the Libro del Conoscimiento.Libro de Conoscimiento (1877 ed.: p. 50) The Medici Atlas also seems to show the location of the Azores, being the first to do so.Amat di S. Filippo (1892). However, Marcel (1887: p. 31) suggest it may have already been hinted at in the Dulcert (1339) map, under the names St. Brendan, Primaria sive puellarum, Capraria and Canaria. They are depicted northwest of the Madeira group, aligned on a north to south axis, rather than trailing diagonally from northwest to southeast. The islands are not all individually named, but rather named by cluster. Most southerly are the insule de Cabrera (\\"Goat islands\\", encompassing two islands, what seem like Santa Maria and S√£o Miguel), further north is the individually named Insula Brasi (\\"island of embers/fire\\" (volcanic?) or \\"dyewood\\", either of which point to Terceira, but could also be the legendary Irish Brazil), then, just west of it, a group called insule de Ventura Sive de Columbis (\\"islands of venture/winds or the pigeons\\", three islands, probably S√£o Jorge, Faial and Pico), and then, furthest north, are a cluster of two islands labelled insule de Corvis Marinis ('islands of the sea crows', Corvo and Flores). Only Graciosa seems to be missing. These Azores islands appear with these names in two subsequent Majorcan maps - the 1375 Catalan Atlas and the 1385 map of Guillem Soler, with some more detailed sorting of the groups, e.g. Medici's \\"Ventura Sive de Columbis\\" label is broken into three distinct names: \\"San Zorzo\\" (\\"St. George\\", S. Jorge), Ventura (Faial) and Li Columbis (Pico); and the pair of \\"Corvis Marinis\\" are distinguished between Corvis Marinis (Corvo) and Li Conigi (\\"rabbits\\", Flores). The anonymous Castilian author of the Libro del Conoscimiento also supplies these names, breaking up the southerly Cabrera group (which the Catalan forgot) into the islands of las cabras (\\"goats\\", S. Miguel) and lobo (\\"seals\\"? S. Maria).Libro de Conoscimiento (1877 ed.: p. 50). The rest of the names are as given in the Catalan Atlas: S. Jorge as sant jorge (S. Jorge), ventura (Faial), colunbaria (Pico), brasil (Terceira), Cueruos marines (Corve) and los conjeos (Flores). None of the Azores islands will be officially discovered until nearly a century later, in the 1430s and 1440s. They could simply be purely legendary, possibly of Andalusian Arab origin (e.g. al-Idrisi speaks of an Atlantic island of wild goats (the Cabras) and another of \\"cormorants\\", a scavenger bird, possibly the \\"sea crows\\" of Corvis Marinis?). But outside their erroneous axis tilt, the Azores do seem clustered with reasonable accuracy on the Medici atlas. One (unproven) possibility is that the Azores were indeed discovered, or at least seen from a distance, quite by accident, by the aforementioned 1341 mapping expedition on their return via a long sailing arc (volta do mar) from the Canary islands.

These historic assets are an intrinsic part of a nation‚Äôs identity and consciousness. They inspire strong emotions and live on in stories, poetry and music. However, the history relating to them is often hard to unravel, as there is often little to see above ground and the historical record is usually written by the victors. The UK has many historic battlefield sites, some of which have legal protection through heritage protection legislation (as scheduled monuments, listed buildings, gardens and designed landscapes, or as conservation areas) whilst others are protected through landscape legislation (such as National Parks, National Scenic Areas and areas designated for local landscape value). More recently, some archaeologists prefer the term \\"site of conflict\\" to \\"battlefield\\", because of the difficulty in defining the geographical extent of a site.T Sutherland and M Holst \\"Battlefield Archaeology ‚Äì a guide to the archaeology of Conflict\\" BAJR 2005 In England, the Register of Historic Battlefields lists the sites of 43 of the most important military battles on English soil. It is maintained by English Heritage. Historic Scotland is responsible for the Inventory of Historic Battlefields. There are currently 17 battlefields on the Inventory. In Wales, the Welsh Ministers proposed in March 2011 that Cadw also compiles a non-statutory register of historic battlefields. The consultation period ends on 10 June 2011. There is currently no battlefield register or statutory protection for such sites in Northern Ireland. Legislation The legislation to protect historic battlefields is relatively recent, and arose following several key incidents involving important sites e.g. the discovery in 1997 of an unprotected mass grave of soldiers who fought at the 1461 Battle of Towton and a large metal detector rally held on the battlefield of Marston Moor in 2003. Battlefield sites in England are material considerations in the planning process and are designated by Historic England and put onto the Register of Historic Battlefields under powers conferred under the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act, 1983 (as amended). This legislation did not confer a specific responsibility to create a register of battlefields, (only a register for historic parks and gardens), but a joint project between English Heritage, the National Army Museum and the Battlefields Trust in 1995 created a register. In 2011 this registered was incorporated into the National Heritage List for England, administered by Historic England. In Scotland, the Inventory of historic battlefields was introduced in 2009 and is compiled by Historic Scotland on behalf of the Scottish Ministers. This is done under the Historic Environment (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 2011, following on from the Scottish Historic Environment Policy (July 2009) with further guidance issued in March 2011. In England, submissions are considered by English Heritage‚Äôs Battlefields Panel which is a non-executive specialist panel which advises the organisation on policy and practice. Members include archaeologist Dr Glenn Foard and Major General Julian Thompson CB OBE. Even though there is no legal requirement for English Heritage to be consulted over planning applications which affect registered battlefields although they must be considered by the local planning authority. Registration of battlefields means that any proposed development on the sites and their settings a material consideration under planning legislation. Planning Policy Statement 5 Planning for the Historic Environment states that there should be a presumption in favour of the conservation of designated historic assets, and that local authorities should assess whether an application for development outweighs the \\"disbenefits\\". It also recognises that there are many historic assets that are not currently designated, and that despite that, they should still be a presumption in favour of conservation such that substantial harm to, or loss of, the battlefield should be \\"wholly exceptional\\". Some sites also receive protection under separate legislation, for example the parts of the Battle of Maldon is part of the Coastal Protection Belt, a Special Landscape Area and a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The Battle of Evesham site is subject to local plan policies which constrain development beyond its current extent. Legislation regarding metal detecting and the Portable Antiquities Scheme also applies to historic battlefield sites across the UK. However, because there is often little to see above ground, sites are regularly threatened by new road and residential development. The 2010 Heritage at Risk survey identifies several sites that are \\"at risk\\" including the site of the Battle of Newburn Ford which has been subject to piecemeal, peripheral development and much of the site of the Battle of Stamford Bridge lies under modern development War cemeteries are designated separately. Criteria for designation Although there are many historic battlefields in England only a few are considered to be important enough to be included in the register. The current criteria for designation are: * Historic significance - the battle must have had a significant impact on English history. * It must have involved recognised military units and the area on which the forces formed up and fought must be capable of definition on the ground. * Surviving topographical and built features which played a part in the battle are important as is the potential for battlefield archaeology, i.e. the survival of features and items from the battle such as graves and weapons. * Documents and memorials that help with the understanding of the battle through eye-witness accounts or subsequent investigation will also raise the site‚Äôs significance. In Scotland, the criteria are similar but with the additional requirement that the it must be possible to define the site on a modern map with a reasonable degree of accuracy. English Heritage is currently (May 2011) reviewing the criteria in the light of recent battlefield studies and developments in battlefield archaeology. Unlike listed buildings, Registered battlefields in England are not graded according to their relative significance. This is also something that is under consideration. Identification of battlefields * Application online using a form on the English Heritage web site or by contacting Historic Scotland * An initial assessment is carried out by English Heritage/ or Historic Scotland to find out if meets the designation criteria. * If it does, the owner and local planning authority is told about the application. * Further research is carried out on the history and description of the site and put into an initial report using in consultation with the owner, local planning authority, the Battlefields Trust and applicant. * All the information and representations are considered, and English Heritage or Historic Scotland makes a decision. List of historic battlefields The UK Battlefields Trust claims that there are more than 500 historic battlefields and other fields of conflict in England up to the Jacobite risings of the 18th century. It is gradually compiling a UK \\"Fields of Conflict\\" database in collaboration with Historic Scotland, Leeds University and English Heritage. An independent Scottish Battlefields Trust was established in 2015 to protect, promote and interpret the battlefield heritage of Scotland.http://www.scottishbattlefields.org/home/ The English Heritage Register of Historic Battlefields identifies 43 English battlefields, whilst Historic Scotland has 17 sites on its Inventory. The purpose of both the register and inventory is to offer them protection and to promote a better understanding of their significance. The location, brief historic details and designation for each register battlefield in England can searched using The National Heritage List for England. There are also details of sources, history and archaeological excavations for each site where available on the English Heritage web site.

He is living and working in the United States. Allen is considered one of the most prominent exponents of the South African arts diaspora in the Northeastern USA.  Life  Siemon Allen studied fine arts at the Technikon Natal in Durban, where he graduated with a Master of Arts in 1999. During his studies he got to know his future wife, an American, and together they moved to the US later on. Today, Allen is working as a visiting professor at the department for sculpture and extended media at the Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia.Allen's profile on Virginia University's homepage While still living in South Africa, Allen was founding member of the FLAT Gallery (1993‚Äì1995) within the context of an artists' initiative.Flat-project on the artist's homepage Allen's works were exhibited at the 2nd Johannesburg Biennale as part of the exhibition \\"Graft\\".he hasn't talked mostly about his private life in public life His works are part of many collections in- and outside of South Africa, including the collections of the Durban Art Gallery, the Guggenheim Museum in New York City and the Standard Bank Collection.  Work philosophy  Siemon Allen is a passionate collector and archivist of South African ephemera, which he uses to create large-scale visual and informational installations. Accordingly, these works are entitled \\"collection projects\\" and primarily explore the concept of creating identity through distance and the image of South Africa in general. For his installations, Allen systematically accumulates mass-produced printed materials, which he catalogues and exhibits. The working process thus is similar to the one of an archivist. As a South African living abroad, Allen is especially interested in exploring and understanding how a country is seen from outside and what is the country's role in building this image. In the early 2000s he came across a website of the South African government that strongly advertised an appeal for positive branding-politics outside of the country as well as for the recruitment of non-governmental South Africans living abroad to act as \\"ambassadors\\" for the country. Allen's installations both debunk this essentialist thought of a South African \\"brand\\" and contribute to it. Allen's actual project is about the creation of a vast, internet-based archive of audio-documents regarding the South African history.Homepage of his project \\"Flat International\\" The exhibition which resulted from this archive was called \\"Records\\" and was shown in South Africa in 2009 and in the US in 2010.

It contains a hydrophobic domain typical of an integral membrane protein. The antigen is designated apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1) by virtue of appearing to be located in the apical complex. AMA-1 appears to be transported to the merozoite surface close to the time of schizont rupture. The 66kDa merozoite surface antigen (PK66) of Plasmodium knowlesi, a simian malaria, possesses vaccine-related properties believed to originate from a receptor-like role in parasite invasion of erythrocytes. The sequence of PK66 is conserved throughout Plasmodium, and shows high similarity to P. falciparum AMA-1. Following schizont rupture, the distribution of PK66 changes in a coordinate manner associated with merozoite invasion. Prior to rupture, the protein is concentrated at the apical end, following which it distributes itself entirely across the surface of the free merozoite. Immunofluorescence studies suggest that, during invasion, PK66 is excluded from the erythrocyte at, and behind, the invasion interface.

Using appropriate assumptions the method can also be employed for static slope stability analysis. It was proposed by Sarada K. Sarma in the early 1970s as an improvement over the other conventional methods of analysis which had adopted numerous simplifying assumptions. History Sarma worked in the area of seismic analysis of earth dams under Ambraseys at Imperial College for his doctoral studies in the mid 1960s.Sarma S. K. (1968) Response characteristics and stability of earth dams during strong earthquakes. PhD Thesis, Imperial College of Science & Technology, University of London The methods for seismic analysis of dams available at that time were based on the Limit Equilibrium approach and were restricted to planar or circular failures surfaces adopting several assumptions regarding force and moment equilibrium (usually satisfying one of the two) and about the magnitude of the forces (such as interslice forces being equal to zero). Sarma looked into the various available methods of analysis and developed a new method for analysis in seismic conditions and calculating the permanent displacements due to strong shaking. His method was published in the 1970s (the very first publication was in 1973 and later improvements came in 1975 and 1979 Sarma S. K. (1979), Stability analysis of embankments and slopes. Journal of Geotechnical Engineering, ASCE, 1979, 105, 1511‚Äì1524, ). Method =Assumptions= The method satisfies all conditions of equilibrium, (i.e. horizontal and vertical force equilibrium and moment equilibrium for each slice). It may be applied to any shape of slip surface as the slip surfaces are not assumed to be vertical, but they may be inclined. It is assumed that magnitudes of vertical side forces follow prescribed patterns. For n slices (or wedges), there are 3n equations and 3n unknowns, and therefore it statically determinate without the need of any further additional assumptions. =Advantages= The Sarma method is called an advanced and rigorous method of static and seismic slope stability analysis. It is called advanced because it can take account of non-circular failure surfaces. Also, the multi-wedge approach allows for non-vertical slicesNon-vertical slices using Sarma's method and irregular slope geometry.Advantages of using Sarma's method It is called a rigorous method because it can satisfy all the three conditions of equilibrium, horizontal and vertical forces and moments. The Sarma method is nowadays used as a verification to finite element programs (also FE limit analysis) and it is the standard method used for seismic analysis. =Use= The method is used mainly for two purposes, to analyse earth slopes and earth dams. When used to analyse seismic slope stability it can provide the factor of safety against failure for a given earthquake load, i.e. horizontal seismic force ir acceleration (critical acceleration). Besides, it can provide the required earthquake load (force or acceleration) for which a given slope will fail, i.e. the factor of safety will be equal to 1. When the method is used in the analysis of earth dams (i.e. the slopes of the dam faces), the results of the analysis, i.e. the critical acceleration is used in the Newmark's sliding block analysis Newmark, N. M. (1965) Effects of earthquakes on dams and embankments. Geotechnique, 15 (2) 139‚Äì160. in order to calculate the induced permanent displacements. This follows the assumption that displacements will result if the earthquake induced accelerations exceed the value of the critical acceleration for stability. Accuracy =General acceptance= The Sarma method has been extensively used in seismic analysis software for many years and has been the standard practice until recently for seismic slope stability for many years (similar to the Mononobe‚ÄìOkabe method Okabe, S. (1926) General theory of earth pressures. Journal of the Japanese Society of Civil Engineers, 12 (1)Mononobe, N & Matsuo, H. (1929) On the determination of earth pressures during earthquakes. Proceedings of the World Engineering Congress, 9. for retaining walls). Its accuracy has been verified by various researchers and it has been proved to yield results quite similar to the modern safe Lower Bound numerical stability Limit Analysis methods (e.g. the 51st Rankine Lecture 51st Rankine Lecture ‚Äì Geotechnical Stability Analysis). =Modern alternatives= However, nowadays modern numerical analysis software employing usually the finite element, finite difference and boundary element methods are more widely used for special case studies.Zienkiewicz O C, Chan A H C, Pastor M, Schrefler B A, Shiomi T (1999) Computational Geomechanics with Special Reference to Earthquake Engineering. John Wiley & Sons, London.Zienkiewicz, O. C. & Taylor, R. L. (1989) The Finite Element Method. McGraw‚ÄìHill, London. Particular attention has been recently given to the finite element method Griffiths, D. V. & Lane, P. V. (1999) Slope stability analysis by finite elements. Geotechnique, 49 (3) 387‚Äì403 which can provide very accurate results through the release of several assumptions usually adopted by the conventional methods of analysis. Special boundary conditions and constitutive laws can model the case in a more realistic fashion.

Introduced in Lake Como, Italy at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este on 21 May 2011, the Zagato was awarded with the competition's \\"Design Award for Concept Cars and Prototypes\\" which has also been won by the One-77 in 2009. Like the Aston Martin V12 Vantage on which it is based, the V12 Zagato is powered by a 5.9-litre AM11 V12 engine first used in the DBS which produces , and of torque. Design Designed at the Aston Martin Design Studios in Gaydon, the chassis - engineered by a Chris Porritt-led team including veterans of Astons Martins's One-77 project - features a retuned version of the regular V12 Vantage's double-wishbone suspension. The design features a new handcrafted aluminium body with the front similar to the Vantage with differences in the roof and rear section. Another difference is the endurance racing fuel tank carrying up to 120 litres of fuel. Production Following a large interest by customers, Aston Martin announced they would produce a homologated version of the car, producing only a limited run of 150 at the Aston Martin headquarters in Gaydon. Starting delivery in the second half of 2012, the Zagato was priced at around ¬£330,000 excluding local taxes. In the end, orders did not materialize at the rate envisioned and only 61 cars were actually made. Racing history =2011= Aston Martin V12 Zagato 'Zig', at the 51st VLN, 2011 The Aston Martin V12 Zagato made its racing debut at the 53rd ADAC ACAS H&R-Cup; VLN round at the N√ºrburgring on 28 May, the event for the car being a preparation and development experience ahead of the N√ºrburgring 24-hour race, to be held on 25‚Äì26 June. Two V12 Zagatos competed in the 51st ADAC Reinoldus- Langstreckenrennen VLN four-hour race on 11 June. Again as a test session ahead of the N√ºrburgring 24-hour race. Aston Martin Chief Executive, Dr. Ulrich Bez lead the driver team joined by the company's N√ºrburgring Test Centre Director, Wolfgang Schuhbauer plus experienced amateur racer Peter Cate in the first of the two V12 Zagato's. The sister car was driven by One-77 Chief Engineer Chris Porritt, experienced sports car driver Oliver Mathai and automotive journalist Richard Meaden. Competing in the SP8 category, the V12 Zagatos; near production standard cars with only essential safety and aerodynamic modifications required for racing, took 2nd and 3rd place in class, equating to 15th and 39th overall in field of some 150 largely specialist cars. The two V12 Zagatos affectionately nicknamed \\"Zig\\" (green car) and \\"Zag\\" (red car) competed in the 39th ADAC N√ºrburgring 24-hour race, held on 25‚Äì26 June. The two factory backed cars both completed the race, finishing 5th and 6th in the SP8 class. The red car also raced at the 2011 Goodwood Festival of Speed on 1‚Äì3 July. Driven by Aston Martin head designer, Marek Reichman, the car recorded a best time of 61.21 to finish 15th in the overall shootout. On 17 October \\"Zig\\" was part of a collaboration between Aston Martin and Toyota at the VLN9 DMV 250-Meilen-Rennen. During the race drivers of both the V12 Zagato and Lexus LFA, which included the CEO of Aston Martin and President of Toyota, had an opportunity to drive both cars. =2012= 'Zig' attended VLN3 as a test for the Nurburgring 24 hours, during which the car unfortunately sustained a puncture on the first lap, however went on the finish the race without any further problems. Previously running in green livery 'Zig' was re-painted Gulf blue and black for the Nurburgring 24hours to match its GT3 teammates. The car had an excellent race and ran faultlessly throughout driven by Aston Martin CEO Dr Ulrich Bez (D), chief engineer Chris Porritt (GB), N√ºrburgring Test Centre Director Wolfgang Schuhbauer (D) and journalist Richard Meaden (GB) and finished 26th overall and 2nd in class.

The band released their eponymous debut EP in 1992 with Raymond and Gary Savoie on lead vocals, followed by their first album Theatre of the Mind in 1996 and then Destiny? in 1998, both with Gary on lead vocals. In 2007 the band released their third album Beneath the Veil of Winter's Face with singer Beno√Æt David who would record two more studio albums with the band: One Among the Living in 2010 and The World is a Game in 2012. In 2015 the band released their sixth album and first with current singer Jean Pageau Delusion Rain, and released their seventh album Lies and Butterflies on July 14, 2018 . Mystery's current line-up is Michel St-P√®re, bassist Fran√ßois Fournier, guitarist Sylvain Moineau, drummer Jean- S√©bastien Goyette, singer Jean Pageau and keyboardist Antoine Michaud. History =Formation and first three albums (1986-1999)= In 1986 while working at Studio Illusion as a sound engineer, Michel St-P√®re founded Mystery with keyboardist Sylvain Desharnais. The band was originally named Century, but was renamed to Mystery at the suggestion of Desharnais' girlfriend when it was discovered there was a band in France already called Century. It took several years for a stable lineup to form, but by 1990 a lineup formed featuring St-P√®re on guitars, along with St√©phane Perreault on drums, Raymond Savoie on vocals, and Beno√Æt Dupuis on keyboards. In 1991 the band began recording their first EP. Richard Addison joined the band in 1991 on bass and Gary Savoie, Raymond's brother, became the lead singer in winter of that year. Mystery released their debut EP in March 1992 with both Raymond and Gary on vocals. This EP is currently the only Mystery album that is out of print. Perreault was taken ill with a crippling illness in 1991 which led to a hiatus until autumn of 1993, at which point the band regrouped. Recording started on the band's first full-length album Theatre of the Mind in winter of 1994. After finishing his parts for the album, Addison left the band and was replaced by Patrick Bourque, who had played bass on \\"Rythmizomena\\" on Theatre of the Mind. Michel Painchaud also joined the band on saxophone and acoustic guitar. In 1995, the band was reduced to four members when Dupuis and Painchaud left. To help promote the new album's release in 1996, St-P√®re created his own record label, Unicorn Digital, on which all of Mystery's recordings from this point onward would be released. With the release of Theatre of the Mind the band was able to reach a wider audience outside of their home in Canada. During the recording of the band's second album, Destiny?, Perreault left and was replaced by Steve Gagn√© who was introduced to the band by studio sound engineer Gilles Peltier. Destiny? was released in May 1998 and licensed to French record label Musea. After the release of Destiny? Anne Charbonneau joined the band as keyboardist and the band played concerts with music from the album. By the time it came to start work on the band's next album in 1999, singer Gary Savoie left due to musical differences. =Beno√Æt David era (1999-2014)= After Gary Savoie left he was replaced by Beno√Æt David, who St-P√®re had met after a Yes tribute gig by David's then-band Close To The Edge (named Ga√Øa at the time) prior to Savoie's departure from the band. For the next several years St-P√®re shifted his focus to expanding his record label, causing the next Mystery album to be delayed. In 2000 Mystery released two songs: a cover of \\"Hey You\\" for a Pink Floyd tribute album and a demo of the song which would become the title track of the band's next album, Beneath the Veil of Winter's Face for a progressive rock compilation album. Mystery also released the compilation album At the Dawn of a New Millennium, marking a transition period in the band. Over the next few years progress was made on the band's next studio album, with a rough mix of the song \\"As I Am\\" appearing on the 2004 compilation album Prog-r√©siste. Then in 2006, Mystery released a cover of \\"Visions of Paradise\\" on a The Moody Blues tribute album. The band's third studio album Beneath the Veil of Winter's Face was released on May 15, 2007. Bourque died a few months after the album's release in September 2007, the cause of death was determined to be suicide. He was also a member of Emerson Drive up until a month before his death. Following the passing of Bourque, St-P√®re, David, and Gagn√© soldiered on. They hired Fran√ßois Fournier to replace Bourque on bass, brought second guitarist Dean Baldwin to the fold, and former keyboard player Beno√Æt Dupuis rejoined the band in his original role. David performing with Yes in 2010 In 2008 David became the lead singer of Yes (until 2012), filling in for Jon Anderson, while continuing to be the lead singer for Mystery. While this helped the band reach a wider audience, it also caused Mystery to have to work around Yes' schedule. Destiny?, Mystery's second album, was remixed and released with new artwork and a bonus track as a 10th anniversary edition in 2009. The new lineup also played their first show, opening for The Musical Box on April 3. In 2010, the band released their fourth studio album, One Among the Living. Many other musicians played on the album as session musicians, including other artists who released music on Unicorn Digital and other musicians, including Oliver Wakeman, David's bandmate in Yes, and John Jowitt. Gagn√© departed the band in 2011 as he was unable to do the recording for the upcoming album, but stayed with the band as a touring member. Nick D'Virgilio was named to be the session musician who would record all the drum tracks on their next album and Antoine Fafard from Spaced Out would record all the bass tracks on the album. On July 28, 2012, Sylvain Moineau was announced to be filling in for Baldwin on guitars for their next show and then became a full- time touring member. Mystery released their fifth studio album, The World is a Game, on August 10, 2012. On January 2, 2013 it was announced that Jean- S√©bastien Goyette would be playing drums in the live band instead of Gagn√©, with his first show being the February 7 show at Centrepointe Theatre. A remastered version of At the Dawn of a New Millennium was announced on February 26 along with Unveil the Mystery, a new compilation album containing music from 2007 until 2012, for which the name for was announced on March 12. On May 10, the band played and recorded their first European show in the Netherlands during their tour supporting The World is a Game which was released as the double live album, Tales from the Netherlands, on October 1, 2014. The band recorded the Gene Simmons song \\"See You Tonite\\" for the KISS tribute album A World With Heroes. Todd Farhood sang lead vocals while the rest of Mystery (St-P√®re, Dupuis, Fournier, Moineau and Goyette) played their respective instruments. =Jean Pageau era (2014-present)= On March 14, 2014 it was announced that David had left the band the prior autumn after having discussed wanting to take a pause from music before the start of The World is a Game Tour. Jean Pageau, who was in attendance at the Saga concert Mystery opened in February 2013, officially became lead singer on March 9. On July 7 Antoine Michaud was announced to be filling in for Sylvain Moineau for all 2014 concerts, and that he had already been practicing with the band for a month. In August and September the band toured a second leg of concerts supporting The World is a Game taking place in Canada and Europe. On November 2 it was announced recording had started on the next studio album. On June 9, 2015 the title for the album was announced to be Delusion Rain, and was subsequently released on November 1.

On September 2, 2016 the band played in the 2Days Prog + 1 festival in Italy. On September 5 Michaud was announced to be the new keyboard player for the band after Dupuis left the band following the Progdreams V concert in April. In August and September 2017, the band toured Europe and Canada for the tenth anniversary of Beneath the Veil of Winter's Face, playing the album in its entirety. It was announced on September 7 that the band would release their 7th studio album on July 14, 2018, the same day they would play at the Night of the Prog Festival in Sankt Goarshausen, Germany. In late April and early May 2018, the band took a break from working on the album to tour Europe. Work resumed on the album after returning, and on May 30 the title was announced to be Lies and Butterflies. In March and April 2019 the band toured in support of the album with dates in Canada and Europe, followed by a second leg in October and November in Europe and Canada.

The Palace was made of tree branches, but moated and hung with tapestry and silk inside with glass windows and the lavish food for three days cost ¬£1000.

It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry. The registry is accessed via the client, and the available packages can be browsed and searched via the npm website. The package manager and the registry are managed by npm, Inc.  History  npm is written entirely in JavaScript and was developed by Isaac Z. Schlueter as a result of having \\"seen module packaging done terribly\\" and with inspiration from other similar projects such as PEAR (PHP) and CPAN (Perl). = Notable breakages = * In March 2016, npm attracted press attention after a package called \`left-pad\`, historically used as an example which had become a dependency of many popular JavaScript packages, was unpublished as the result of a naming dispute. Although the package was republished three hours later, it caused widespread disruption, leading npm to change its policies regarding unpublishing to prevent a similar event in the future. * In February 2018, an issue was discovered in version 5.7.0 in which running \`sudo npm\` on Linux systems would change the ownership of system files, permanently breaking the operating system. * In July 2018, the npm credentials of a maintainer of the popular \`eslint-scope\` package were compromised resulting in a malicious release of \`eslint-scope\`, version 3.7.2. The malicious code copies the npm credentials of the machine running \`eslint-scope\` and uploads them to the attacker. * In November 2018, it was discovered that a malicious package had been added as a dependency to version 3.3.6 of the popular package \`event- stream\`. The malicious package, called \`flatmap-stream\`, contained an encrypted payload that steals bitcoins from certain applications. npm administrators responded by removing the offending package. * In April 2020, a small package called \`is-promise\` resulted in outage in serverless applications and deployments worldwide by the virtue of being a dependency of many big and important applications.  Description  npm is included as a recommended feature in the Node.js installer. npm consists of a command line client that interacts with a remote registry. It allows users to consume and distribute JavaScript modules that are available in the registry. Packages in the registry are in CommonJS format and include a metadata file in JSON format. Over 477,000 packages are available in the main npm registry. The registry does not have any vetting process for submission, which means that packages found there can be low quality, insecure, or malicious. Instead, npm relies on user reports to take down packages if they violate policies by being low quality, insecure, or malicious. npm exposes statistics including number of downloads and number of depending packages to assist developers in judging the quality of packages. In npm version 6, the audit feature was introduced to help developers identify and fix vulnerability and security issues in installed packages. The source of security issues were taken from reports found on the Node Security Platform (NSP) and has been integrated with npm since npm's acquisition of NSP.  Usage  npm can manage packages that are local dependencies of a particular project, as well as globally-installed JavaScript tools. When used as a dependency manager for a local project, npm can install, in one command, all the dependencies of a project through the \`package.json\` file. In the \`package.json\` file, each dependency can specify a range of valid versions using the semantic versioning scheme, allowing developers to auto-update their packages while at the same time avoiding unwanted breaking changes. npm also provides version-bumping tools for developers to tag their packages with a particular version. npm also provides the \`package-lock.json\` file which has the entry of the exact version used by the project after evaluating semantic versioning in \`package.json\`.  Alternatives  There are a number of open-source alternatives to npm for installing modular JavaScript, including \`ied\`, \`pnpm\`, \`npmd\`, and Yarn, the last of which was released by Facebook in October 2016. They are all compatible with the public npm registry and use it by default, but provide different client-side experiences, usually focused on improving performance and determinism compared to the npm client. At JSConf 2019 npm's former CTO announced a new federated package registry, Entropic, which is aimed at decentralisation of JavaScript commons.  The company  The company behind the npm software is npm, Inc, based in Oakland, California. The CEO Bryan Bogensberger who joined the company in July 2018 resigned in September 2019. Before Bogensberger's resignation, npm co-founder Laurie Voss resigned in July 2019. GitHub announced in March 2020 it is acquiring npm, Inc.

Found in Malaysia, it was described as new to science in 2011. It produces sponge-like, rubbery orange fruit bodies that have a fruity or musky odour. The fruit bodies reach dimensions of wide by tall. Like a sponge, they will resume their original shape if water is squeezed out. The spores, produced on the surfaces of the hollows of the sponge, are almond- shaped with rough surfaces, and measure 1012.5 Œºm by 67 Œºm. The name of the fungus is derived from the Nickelodeon cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants from the show of the same name. S. squarepantsii is one of two species in Spongiforma; it differs from S. thailandica in its color, odour, and spore structure. Taxonomy and classification The species was first described scientifically online in May 2011 in the journal Mycologia, authored by American mycologists Dennis E. Desjardin, Kabir Peay, and Thomas Bruns. The description was based on two specimens collected by Bruns in 2010 in Lambir Hills National Park, in Sarawak, Malaysia. The species had first appeared in the literature in 2010 in a study of the ectomycorrhizal mushrooms in a tropical dipterocarp rainforest in Lambir Hills, although it was not formally described in this publication. Because of its unusual form, Desjardin and colleagues were initially uncertain whether the new species was a member of the Basidiomycota or the Ascomycota. Further analysis showed that the species was aligned with Spongiforma, a genus that was newly described from dipterocarp forests of Thailand in 2009. The similarity between the species collected in Borneo and Spongiforma thailandica was confirmed with molecular analysis, which showed a 98% match between ribosomal DNA sequences of the two. The genus name Spongiforma refers to the sponge-like nature of the fruit body, while the specific epithet squarepantsii is a Latinisation of the well-known Nickelodeon cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants, whose shape was purported to share a resemblance to the fungus. Additionally, the authors note that the spore-bearing surface (the hymenium), when viewed with scanning electron microscopy, somewhat resembles a \\"seafloor covered with tube sponges, reminiscent of the fictitious home of SpongeBob\\". Although the epithet was originally rejected by the editors of Mycologia as \\"frivolous\\", Desjardin and colleagues insisted that \\"we could name it whatever we liked\\". Description The fruit body of Spongiforma squarepantsii is bright orange coloured, roughly spherical to oval, and measures wide by tall. Although it lacks a stipe, it has a rudimentary columella‚Äîa small cord of sterile tissue that extends to the center of the fruit body. The surface of the fruit body has deep ridges and folds somewhat resembling a brain. It is sponge-like and rubbery‚Äîif water is squeezed out, it will resume its original shape. The surface has irregular, relatively large cavities (locules), lined with fertile (spore-producing) tissue. The locules are between in diameter. The ridges of the locules are pale orange or lighter and ciliate (having hairlike projections). Fruit bodies have a strong odour described as \\"vaguely fruity or strongly musty\\". The mushroom tissue turns purple when a drop of 3% potassium hydroxide (KOH) is applied. In mass, the spores are a reddish-brown or deep mahogany colour. The edibility of the fruit body is unknown. Scanning electron micrograph of the hymenium showing the warty spores with the prominent germ pore. Scale bar = 10 Œºm The almond-shaped spores are typically 10‚Äì12.5 Œºm by 6‚Äì7 Œºm with thick walls measuring between 0.5‚Äì1.2 Œºm. They have a small central apiculus (a depressed area when the spore was once attached to the basidium via the sterigma). When mounted in distilled water, they have a coarsely warty surface and appear rusty brown in colour. When mounted in a 3% KOH solution, the spores are pale lilac grey, and the surface ornamentation forms swollen pustules that loosen and dissolve. Spores are dextrinoid (meaning they turn reddish-brown when stained with Melzer's reagent) and cyanophilic (red in acetocarmine). The basidia are club-shaped, and four-spored with sterigmata up to 9.5 Œºm long. The ridges of the locules comprise erect cystidia mixed with chains of erect cylindrical hyphae measuring 4‚Äì6 Œºm in diameter. The cystidia are roughly cylindrical, and have dimensions of 20‚Äì60 Œºm by 4‚Äì9 Œºm. There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae of the fungus. =Similar species= The related species Spongiforma thailandica, newly described in 2009, differs from S. squarepantsii in several ways: it has larger fruit bodies, wide by tall; its gleba is initially pale greyish-orange to brownish- grey before darkening to reddish-brown or dark brown; and it smells of coal tar. Microscopically, S. thailandica has spores with less prominent surface warts. Habitat and distribution Spongiforma squarepantsii was found growing on the ground in Lambir Hills National Park (Sarawak State, Malaysia), northern Borneo (). This tropical rainforest receives about of rain yearly, with average temperatures ranging from . The structure of the fruit body allows it to quickly revive when dry by absorbing moisture from the air. The distinctive odour of the species may indicate that spore dispersal is mediated by animals.

On 1 December 1996, it was demerged to create the infrastructure operator Norwegian National Rail Administration, the train operator Norwegian State Railways and the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate. The name was taken by the train operator, although the infrastructure operator remained a government agency and is the legal successor. History Norway's first railway, the Trunk Line, was opened in 1854. It was built and run as a private company, although with some government ownership. This was followed by two wholly state-owned railways, the narrow-gauge Hamar‚ÄìGrundset Line in 1861 and the standard-gauge Kongsvinger Line in 1862, with the latter branching from the Trunk Line at Lillestr√∏m. Several more were built over the next two decades. In 1871 the national railway was connected to the Swedish rail infrastructure.Kongsvingerbanen By the 1880s, the pace of railway construction ground to a halt due to economic and political problems. In 1883, the Norwegian State Railways was established and railway construction started up again. The Norwegian State Railways also bought up many private railways to integrate them into the national railway network. In 1920 the Bratsberg Line was acquiredStore norske leksikon: Bratsbergbanen. by the government. The Trunk Line was first formally acquired in 1926, despite having formed a central part of the network for half a century.Hovedbanen =World War Two= In January 1942 NSB gave \\"green light for putting POWs into construction work of the Nordland Line.

Furthermore, Westlie points to \\"dilemmas [that] NSB's employees found themselves in when the NSB leadership cooperated with the Germans\\". \\"[Bjarne] Vik was to be made the scapegoat for the cooperation with the Germans, writes Westlie, even though many of the darkest chapters are from the period before Vik\\" became the chief, according to Halvor Hegtun. There was no investigation of the agencies [or NSB] after the war.

For me, NSB's use of POWs and this deportation of Jews must be viewed as one: namely, that NSB thereby became an agency that participated in Hitler's violence against these two groups, who were the nazism's main enemies.

Life Greyfriars Kirk The grave of Rev James Finlayson, Dunblane Cathedral Finlayson was born the son of William Finlayson on 15 February 1758, at Nether Cambushinnie Farm, near Kinbuck in the parish of Dunblane, Perthshire, where his ancestors had been settled for several centuries. He made rapid progress at school (first Kinbuck then Dunblane), and began his religious studies in the University of Glasgow at the age of 14. He held two tutorships, and subsequently became amanuensis to Professor Anderson, who had discovered his abilities. In 1782, he became domestic tutor to two sons of Sir William Murray of Ochtertyre. As the family spent the winter in Edinburgh, Finlayson continued his studies at the university. He was licensed to preach in 1785. In this year, the Duke of Atholl offered Finlayson the living of Dunkeld, which he was induced to decline, as Sir William Murray informed him that an arrangement was proposed to procure for him the chair of logic in the University of Edinburgh. He was offered the living of Borthwick, near Edinburgh, of which parish he was ordained minister on 6 April 1787. He had assumed the duties of the logic professor in the winter session of 1786-7. In 1787 he was elected a Fellow of the newly formed Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were John Hill and John Walker. Finlayson was now rising into reputation with a rapidity the more remarkable from his modest disposition. The most experienced sages of the church respected his judgment in questions of ecclesiastical policy. He therefore dedicated much of his leisure to study the laws, constitution, and history of the Scottish church, and began to take an active part in the details of its political government. This made him gradually lean more to the ecclesiastical than to the literary side of his functions. He soon became a leader on the moderate side in the church courts. In 1790, he was presented by the magistrates of Edinburgh to Lady Yester's Kirk. In 1793 he was appointed to succeed Rev Robertson, the historian, in the collegiate church of the old Greyfriars Kirk. In 1799, on a vacancy occurring in the high church, he was chosen by the town council to fill that collegiate charge. This last is considered the most honourable appointment in the church of Scotland, and it was, at the time, rendered more desirable from the circumstance that he had for his colleague Hugh Blair, whose funeral sermon he was called upon to preach in little more than a year. The University of Edinburgh conferred on Finlayson the honorary doctorated of Doctor of Divinity (DD) on 28 March 1799. At this time he was living at 2 Park Street in Edinburgh.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1800 In 1802 he was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. He was elected king's almoner in the same year, but resigned the post almost immediately. These honours indicate the general estimate of Finlayson's merits. Finlayson established his ascendency on the wisdom of his councils and his knowledge of the laws and constitution of the church, and among his own party his sway was unlimited. Those who differed from him in church politics freely acknowledged his honourable character and the purity of his motives: his political opponents, in points of business unconnected with party, were occasionally guided by his judgment. His manner was simple and unpresuming; he was below the average height. =Later life and death= Finlayson wrote the life of Dr. Hugh Blair, and a volume of his sermons was published after his death. In 1805, his constitution began to decline. In 1807, he was constrained to accept the assistance of one of his earliest friends, Principal G. H. Baird, who taught the class during the remainder of that session. On 25 January 1808, while conversing with Baird, he was seized with a paralytic affection. Among the few words he was able to articulate was the following sentence: \\"I am about to pass to a better habitation, where ail who believe in Jesus shall enter.\\" On his deathbed, the senatus academicus of the university and the magistrates of Edinburgh waited on him and asked him to name the successor to his chair. In deference to his advice, an offer of the chair was made to Principal Baird, the gentleman he had named. He died on 28 January 1808, and was honoured with a public funeral in the Dunblane Cathedral. His students and others erected a monument to his memory at Dunblane, and a memorial window of stained glass was also placed in Greyfriars Kirk in Edinburgh by his old pupil Principal John Lee of the University of Edinburgh.

Her first poem, In the Black Pavement () was published in the magazine Mlada pota (\\"Young Paths\\"; 1952‚Äì1962). Other poems and magazines, in which she published, were: Na≈°a sodobnost (\\"Our Contemporaneity\\"; 1953‚Äì1963),Pesem Midva, Na≈°a sodobnost (1959) dLibPesem Nokturno, Na≈°a sodobnost (1959) dLib Tribuna (\\"The Tribune\\"; 1951‚Äì),Makaroviƒç, Lirika mladih, Tribuna: list slovenskih ≈°tudentov, 1963, letnik 13, ≈°t. 19, Tribuna str. 6 dLib Problemi (\\"Problems\\"; 1962, 1963),Makaroviƒç, Pesmi, Problemi: revija za kulturo in dru≈æbena vpra≈°anja, 1962/1963, letnik 1, ≈°t. 2, str. 156 dLib Perspektive (\\"Perspectives\\"; 1960‚Äì1964), Sodobnost (\\"Contemporaneity\\"; 1963‚Äì)Pesem Mlinska ve≈°ƒça, Sodobnost (1963‚Äì) dLib and Dialog (\\"The Dialogue\\"). Her first poem collection, called Somrak (\\"Twilight\\"), was published in 1964. This one, as well as her all other works in the second half of the 1950s and early 1960s, follows the predominant path of the Slovenian lyric poetry from Intimism to Modernism. In the collection Kresna noƒç (\\"The Midsummer Night\\"; 1968), she expressed her personal poetics based on traditional poetic forms. Her folk poetry-based poems present a new expression of existential crisis of modern man. In the beginning of the 1970s, her poetry became more harsh in terms of form. Tragical and balad mood was the prevailing one. An example is the collection of poems Bo ≈ærl, bo ≈ært (\\"Will Eat, will be Eaten\\"; 1998). Creative peaks came with her collection Srƒçevec (\\"The Heart Potion\\"; 1973) and the anthology Iz≈°tevanja (\\"Count Out\\"; 1977). Her poem anthology, Samost (\\"Aloneneness\\") was self-published in 2002. In February 2012, Svetlana Makaroviƒç published a ballad fairy tale, titled Sneguroƒçka (\\"Snegurochka\\"), which was inspired by the Russian fairy tale character Snegurochka. Makaroviƒç has had great passion for Russian tradition since childhood. = Youth poetry = Makaroviƒç started releasing her youth works after 1970. In her prose works, she developed her own individual style, which is known for its original naming of characters: Zofka the Witch (), Emily the Hen (), Mishmash the Baker () and others. These characters have premeditated character with archetypical motive of leaving home, hurt child, orphan child. Svetlana Makaroviƒç writes predominantly modern animal stories (picture books Pekarna Mi≈°ma≈° (\\"The Mishmash Bakery\\"; 1974) and Saprami≈°ka (\\"Skipmouse\\"; 1976), collections Take ≈æivalske (\\"Such Animal Ones\\"; 1973), Maƒçja preja (\\"Cat Yarn\\"; 1992) and Veveriƒçek posebne sorte (\\"A Special Kind of Squirrel\\"; 1994)), with primarily myth-based main characters, as well as fantastic fiction (Haramija; 2005). The protagonists are animals, living in a special world and who have similar characteristics as human (they talk and act like them). The reality in the stories is not idealised. It includes cruel, selfish, envious people; gossips, grown-ups who limit children's playfulness ‚Äì the reasons why these animals go through moments of loneliness, despair and sadness. Noticeable innovation of her works are taboos (e.g. sex and elimination)(Novak Popov: 2006) . ≈†krat Kuzma dobi nagrado (\\"Kuzma the Gremlin Wins a Prize\\"; 1974) and Coprnica Zofka (1989) are regarded as stories with primarily myth-based main characters. Her stories point out, in its very core, non-understanding and non-acceptance of difference. Representative fantastic stories are Kosovirja na leteƒçi ≈ælici (\\"Cosies on the Flying Spoon\\"; 1974), Kam pa kam kosovirja? (\\"Where to, Oh, Where to, Cosies?\\"; 1975) and Mi, kosovirji (\\"We, Cosies\\"; 2009). The storyteller is taking the side of free being and opposes rules and demands of authorities. Some of her works were tape recorded (Pekarna Mi≈°ma≈° (1976), Saprami≈°ka (1986), ƒåuk na palici (\\"A Screech Owl on a Stick\\"; 1988), Mali kakadu (\\"The Little Cockatoo\\"; 1989), Sovica Oka (\\"Big-Eyes the Little Owl\\"; 1992) and others). = Curriculum for Slovenian language at schools = Her works have been recommended in Curriculum for Slovene language (2011): Jaz sem je≈æ (\\"I'm a Hedgehog\\"), ƒåuk na palici, Pismo (\\"A Letter\\"), Sovica Oka, Papagaj in sir (\\"The Parrot and the Cheese\\"), Zajƒçek gre na luno (\\"The Bunny Goes to the Moon\\"), Razvajeni vrabƒçek (\\"Spoilt Little Sparrow\\"), Pod medvedovim de≈ænikom (\\"Under the Bear's Umbrella\\"), Jazbec in ovƒçka (\\"The Badger and the Sheep\\"), Pra≈°iƒçkov koncert (\\"The Pig Concert\\"), Pekarna Mi≈°ma≈°, Coprnica Zofka, Kosovirja na leteƒçi ≈ælici, Mi≈°ka spi (\\"The Mouse Sleeps\\"), Volk in sedem kozliƒçkov (\\"The Wolf and the Seven Little Goats\\"), Kam pa kam, kosovirja, Jutro (\\"The Morning\\"). = Music participation = She has published some books of chansons, e.g. Krizantema na klavirju (\\"Chrysanthemum on Piano\\"; 1990), and has performed her own works on musical recitals before invitation-only audiences. The subjects of her chansons are very like those of her poems - the lyrics address the fields of modern family upbringing, social habits, moral norms and social conventions. A difference is that in her chansons there is more humor. She has recorded albums of her interpretations of her own chansons: Noƒçni ≈°anson (\\"Night chanson\\" - 1984); Dajdamski portreti (\\"Dajdamski Portraits\\" - 1985); Pelin ≈æena (\\"Poison Woman\\" - 1985, with Dennis Gonz√°lez); Namesto ro≈æ (\\"Instead of Flowers\\" - 1999). She also wrote lyrics for some standards: Mesto mladih , Na na na (Neca Falk), V Ljubljano (Marjana Der≈æaj)Intervju, Irena Pan, Jana, 6. 1. 2009 and an intro song for the movie Sreƒça na vrvici (Marjeta Ram≈°ak). = Cooperation with the Ljubljana Puppet Theatre = Her work named Sovica Oka was introduced in 1972 on the stage of Ljubljana Puppet Theatre. Saprami≈°ka is a puppet show which was played most times. It was first performed on 17 October 1986. Svetlana Makaroviƒç cooperated with LGL in many ways ‚Äì she wrote and put music to lyrics; wrote and adapted text, made the designs for puppets and sets; she even performed sometimes. She played a part in 31 shows; she was a host in Italy, Austria, Mexico, Australia, and Croatia.

She believed that the main criterion should be quality, not quantity. She defied official publishers, claiming they only exploit authors. Besides that, she strived for social rights of freelance artists. She stood up for the founding of a new, opened to pluralism and only-literature dedicated magazine (1980), but did not cooperate with Nova revija, which started to come out in 1982. Current political and ideological issues supposedly pushed out the art. She forbade publishing of her works in any anthologies or school books, based on her belief that her black and deathlike poetry would be a big reason that young people hate literature. She regards her works not as national goods but as a protected author property. She opposes communist saying that art is for all people. She declined her placement in the Anthology of Slovenian female writers, because the criterion was gender and not quality. She expresses her criticism of her social environment through columns.Recenzija knjige S krempljem podƒçrtano, zbirke ƒçasopisnih kolumn iz Na≈°ih Razgledov (1992‚Äì1993), Jane (1994) in Sobotne priloge Dela (2004). In 2000, she declined the public reception of the Pre≈°eren Award. = Slovenceljni = Makaroviƒç perceives image of Slovenes as cold-hearted, primitive, hypocritical and servile. She contemptously calls them Slovenceljni. In her satirical poems Pesmi o Sloveniji za tuje in domaƒçe goste (\\"Poems about Slovenia for Domestic and Foreign Guests\\"; 1984), she disintegrated mythicised self-image of Slovenes using quite witty irony. She portrayed them as narcissistic, primitive, aggressive on the inside, naive on the outside through travesty of popular tale of Martin Krpan and through allusion on Holy Bible. She mocked the same image in her chansons, collected in Krizantema na klavirju (1990) Anti- Catholic stance In January 2012, Svetlana Makaroviƒá caused a controversy with her statement: \\"In my opinion the Catholic Church in Slovenia is something one must hate. I feel it as my civic duty.\\" The statement was part of an interview published by the Planet Siol.net web portal. The Council of Lay Catholics of Slovenia designated the statement \\"crooked, primitive and unacceptable\\", and in contradiction with the Constitution of Slovenia. The office of the Human Rights Ombudsman in Slovenia as well as the Slovenian police have received several initiatives for intervention. The office did not take a stance in this particular case, but has denounced all forms of publicly expressed hatred and intolerance pointed towards individuals and individual groups due to their personal circumstances. Zdenka ƒåeba≈°ek Travnik, the ombudsman, explained: \\"For me as a person and the human rights ombdusman, it is unacceptable that the artist used her gift in such a harsh way, which hurts and wounds people.\\" Nata≈°a Pirc Musar, the Information Commissioner of the Republic of Slovenia, did not study the case as it was out of her jurisdiction, but condemned the statement. Ale≈° Guliƒç, the director of the Office for Religious Communities, explained that he does not see the statement as a call to lynch and added: \\"It's not nice what the poet said, but actually, she was just angered due to the acts that are really controversial, and due to the concealement of these acts. From her statements, I've only read her personal stance towards the Catholic Church as an institution.\\"  Bibliography  =Adult poetry= *Somrak, Cankarjeva zalo≈æba, 1964 (Twilight) *Kresna noƒç, DZS,

It stars Zayed Khan and Dia Mirza in the lead roles. The music is composed by the duo Salim‚ÄìSulaiman and the lyrics are penned by Javed Akhtar. The movie released on 7 October 2011. Plot Love Breakups Zindagi is a movie that does not try to answer the question related to love, breakups and life. Jai (Zayed Khan) and Naina (Dia Mirza) are almost \\"settled\\" in their life but missing something or someone who will complete them. Jai feels that magic and serendipity have passed him by. Naina is a successful photographer and has taught herself that a less than fulfilling life is enough for her. But is it? Govind (Cyrus Sahukar) has a colourful past and is on his way to another major, seemingly all wrong relationship. But what if this 'mistake' is the love he has been looking for all his life? Sheila (Tisca Chopra) has stayed single for a long time waiting for Mr. Perfect. When he does appear, will she take her chance at love, look beyond the odds that divide to see what binds them in a perfect whole? Ritu (Umang Jain) lives on breakups and ice cream. Will she ever find a man and share a beginning and not just a closure? Arjun (Satyadeep Misra) and Gayatri (Auritra Ghosh) are the perfect couple on the brink of a dream wedding. Will their love inspire the others to listen to their heart? Dhruv (Vaibhav Talwar) and Radhika (Pallavi Sharda) are driven workaholics ignoring the small text of their lives. Will they wake up to see what they have missed in their desire for everything? The characters try to find personal truths, shed illusions, laugh, cry, grow and learn the biggest lesson of all: That even if you don't go looking for love, it will come looking for you.

Sheetal Tiwari of Bollyspice awarded 3 stars saying, \\"All in Love, Love Breakups Zindagi, practices what it preaches in that it has songs of love, life and all that lies in between. Rab Rakha and Chhayee Hai Tanhayee are obviously come out on top while Love Love Love and Rozaana are close runners-up. In any event, there is something to be loved about each track from the soundtrack and the merchant brothers continue to remind us why they are considered as one of the best music duos of the current era.\\" Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama gave the album 3.5 stars and stated, \\"This is turning out to be one real good season when it comes to romantic feel good music being churned out in Bollywood.

Reception  = Critical response = Love Breakups Zindagi has not received encouraging reviews. Preeti Arora from rediff.com gave it 2 stars out of 5, calling it predictable. Gaurav Malani of The Times Of India lamented the fact that director Sahil Singha doesn't show any innovation in the storytelling of his debut venture. Popular film critic Rajeev Masand, who writes for CNN-IBN, said that Love Breakups Zindagi the kind of over-familiar schmaltz that might have felt less of a slog, had it featured charismatic leads. He rated the movie 2 out of 5. fullhyd.com praised the film's music and visuals, but said that the dialogue is too stilted and stagey to believe, and the banter too forced. There have been a few positive reviews, though. DNA's Akansha Naval- Shetye & Soumyadipta Banerjee have said that the movie is fun even though it is clich√©d. Zee News called it a fair attempt by a bunch of debut producers and directors.

The record was hailed as a brave departure by Kerrang! and Rocksound, and Miocene toured extensively in support of this record with SikTh and The Kennedy Soundtrack. A Perfect Life with a View of the Swamp Miocene spent three years writing A Perfect Life with a View of the Swamp, which was intended as a culmination and a progression of both previous releases. Featuring 10+ minute progressive metal pieces, as well as short spoken word pieces and long electronic instrumentals, the album was released on Corporate Risk Products in 2005. The album received positive reviews in the press, but before the album could be toured, the bands' bass guitarist left and the album was never toured. On 10 April 2006, it was announced via the band's MySpace page that Miocene had disbanded.

She sank suddenly on high seas some 130-150 km off the coast west of Nouadhibou, Mauritania on 11 March 1980 after several internal explosions, presumably related to malfunctions in the inert gas system. Of the 43 people aboard, 36 perished. She was the penultimate ship built by Astilleros de C√°diz, (C√°diz) one of the main shipyards in Spain. Before its completion the original customer, the Italian company D'Amico Societ√† di Navegazione, canceled the contract. Finally in 1977 she was acquired by Mar Oil, member of the Wilson Walton group, to bring oil from Ras Tanura in the Persian Gulf to refineries in Algeciras in southern Spain. During the return trip from Algeciras to Ras Tanura (on which her fatal accident happened) the ship was unloaded, on ballast.  Accident  On March 4, 1980 the Mar√≠a Alejandra arrived to Algeciras Bay and unloaded the oil she brought from the Persian Gulf in the CEPSA refinery. During unloading the crew found problems with the inert gas system, which prevents explosions in the holds. The unloading ended on March 6 and preparations for the next leg back to Ras Tanura started next. In the first hours of March 8 she left port again, however the problems with the inert gas system were not fully resolved yet, and the crew were working on them en route. After a stop at Las Palmas in the Canary Islands she was sailing south along the western African coast headed for the Cape of Good Hope and the Indian Ocean. At about 13:30 hours Spanish time on March 11 an explosion was felt aboard, suddenly followed by other explosions. According to the survivors the ship broke apart and sank in about 40 seconds.

How many epochs turned out repulsions, Still a sunburst transcending adversities. Northwards time keeps on evolving, Anticipation how we shall withstand. As the West carried on transforming, You set up enlightenment a homeland. Southwards Hirak crushes prostration, Sculpts the dream into entity and creed. Magnificence ready for any oblation, Seeks the prerogative word and deed. Wishes in East and West perfected, Dispersing beauty shining as pearls. In skies and seas paradises erected, Amassing precedence in splendours. Remnants of times well resurrected, Glamour dazzling planets in colours. Fragrance in horizons sophisticated, History chapters echoing measures. As a Phoenix in determination, Aden shall rise, From under the ashes, Advocating peace, A motherland not to cease, Engraving pride for heavens to please. As tall as a mountain, Aden in gory and dignity, Sprinkling as a fountain, The homeland to eternity. Inevitable and decisive, The style of Aden and order, A promise of love to live, Yemen to prosper for ever.

Although nothing is known of Roose or his life outside of the case, he is believed to have been Fisher's household cook‚Äîor, less likely, a friend of the cook‚Äîat Fisher's residence in Lambeth. He was accused of adding a white powder to some porridge (or similar foodstuff) which was eaten by Fisher's dining guests and those begging food at his kitchen door; two people died. Roose claimed that he had been given the powder to add to the food by a stranger, and claimed it was intended to be a joke‚Äîhe thought he was incapacitating his fellow servants rather than killing anyone, he said. Fisher survived the poisoning as, for an unknown reason, he ate nothing that day. Roose was arrested immediately and tortured for information. King Henry VIII‚Äîwho already had a morbid fear of poisoning‚Äîpersonally addressed the House of Lords on the case and was probably responsible for an act of parliament which attainted Roose and retroactively made murder by poison a treasonous offence mandating execution by boiling. Roose was boiled at London's Smithfield in April 1532. Fisher was already unpopular with the King, as Henry wished to divorce his wife, Katherine of Aragon, and marry Anne Boleyn, which the Church would not allow. Fisher was vociferous in his defence of Katherine, and contemporaries rumoured that the poisoning at Lambeth was the responsibility of the Boleyn family, with or without the knowledge of the King. There appears to have been at least one other attempt on Fisher's life when a cannon was fired towards Fisher's residence from the direction of Anne's father's house in London; on this occasion, no-one was hurt, but much damage was done to the roof and slates. Fisher himself was executed by the King for his opposition to the Royal Supremacy, and Henry eventually married Anne and broke with the Catholic Church. Henry died in 1547 and his poisoning act did not long outlive him, being repealed almost immediately by his son Edward VI. The Roose case continued to ferment popular imagination and was still being cited in law into the next century. It is considered by many historians to be a watershed in the history of attainder, which traditionally acted as a corollary to common law rather than replacing it. It was a direct precursor to the great treason attainders that were to underpin the Tudors'‚Äîand particularly Henry's‚Äîdestruction of their political and religious enemies. Background King Henry had become enamoured with one of his wife's ladies in waiting since 1525, but Anne Boleyn refused to sleep with the King before marriage. As a result, Henry had been trying to persuade both the Pope and the English church to grant him a divorce in order that he might marry Boleyn. Few of the leading churchmen of the day, however, supported Henry, and some, such as John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, were vocal opponents of his plans. J. J. Scarisbrick suggests that by this time, Fisher could count both Henry and Boleyn‚Äîand her family‚Äîamong his enemies. By early 1531, Parliament had been sitting for over a year. It had already passed a number of small, but significant acts, both against perceived social ills‚Äîsuch as vagabondage‚Äîand the church, for example restricting recourse to praemunire and the right of sanctuary. The ambassador from the Holy Roman Empire, Eustace Chapuys wrote to his master, the Emperor Charles V, that Fisher was unpopular with the King prior to the deaths, and reported that parties unnamed but close to the king had threatened to throw Fisher and his followers into the River Thames if he continued his opposition. The historian G. W. Bernard has speculated that Fisher may have been \\"a target of intimidation\\", and notes that there were two suggestive incidents during this period. The atmosphere of suspicion at court, and the passion with which Fisher defended Katherine of Aragon angered both King Henry and Anne Boleyn; for her part, Chapuys later reported, she \\"feared no-one in England more than Fisher, because he had always defended the queen without respect of persons\\". Around this time, Anne advised Fisher not to attend parliament‚Äîwhere he was expected to speak passionately against the King and his mistress‚Äî\\"in case [Fisher] caught some disease as he had before\\". Dowling classes this as a threat, albeit a veiled one. In the event, Fisher ignored both Anne and the advice and attended parliament as intended. Attempts had been made to persuade Fisher by force of argument‚Äîthe most recent had been the previous June in a disputation between Fisher and John Stokesley, Bishop of London but nothing had come of it. Rex suggests that \\"the failure of this move led some to consider more decisive solutions\\"; the Tudor historian Maria Dowling that \\"Fisher's enemies soon went beyond mere bluster\\". =Poisoning= Cases of deliberate, fatal poisoning were relatively rare in England‚Äîknown more by reputation than experience‚Äîparticularly when compared with traditionally high- profile felonies such as rape and burglary. It was considered an \\"un-English\\" crime, and although there was a genuine fear of poisoning among the upper- classes‚Äîwhich led to elaborate food tasting rituals at formal feasts‚Äîfood poisoning from poor hygiene or misuse of natural ingredients was far more common an occurrence than deliberate poisoning with intent. Poisonings of 18 February 1531 In the early afternoon of 18 February 1531 Bishop Fisher and a number of guests were dining together at his house‚Äîthe episcopal palace‚Äîin Lambeth Marsh. The act of parliament later described the official account of events: \\"on the Eighteenth day of February, 1531, one Richard Roose, of Rochester, Cook, also called Richard Cooke, did cast poison into a vessel, full of yeast or baum, standing in the kitchen of the Bishop of Rochester‚Äòs Palace, at Lambeth March, by means of which two persons who happened to eat of the pottage made with such yeast died\\". A member of Fisher's household, Benett (possibly Burnet) Curwen, gentleman, and a woman who had come to the kitchens seeking alms called Alice Tryppyt, had eaten a porridge, or pottage, and became \\"mortally enfected\\". Fisher, who had not partaken of the dish, survived, but about 17 people were violently ill, including members of his dining party that night and the poor who regularly came to beg charity. It is not known why Fisher did not eat; he may have been fasting, or simply not hungry. Fisher's first biographer, Richard Hall reports that Fisher had been studying so hard in his office that he lost his appetite and \\"bid his household dine without him\\". On the other hand, says Bernard, Fisher was well known for his charitable practice of not eating before the supplicants at his door had; as a result, \\"they played the fatal role of food tasters\\". Richard Fisher‚Äîthe bishop's brother, and also household steward‚Äîordered Roose arrested immediately. Roose, who by then seems to have put some distance between himself and the palace, was swiftly captured. He was placed under examination in the Tower of London. Theories bust of John Fisher, c. 1510, now held in the Metropolitan Museum of Artalt=contemporary terracotta bust of Fisher A \\"shockwave of horror\\" struck London and Westminster. Chapuys, writing to the Emperor in early March 1531, stated that it was as yet unknown who had provided Roose with the poison; Fisher's most recent biographer, Richard Rex, also argues that Roose was more likely a pawn in another's game, and had been \\"unwittingly tricked into the deed\\". Chapuys believed Roose to have been Fisher's own cook, while the act of parliament noted only that he was a cook by occupation and from Rochester. Many details of both the chronology and the case against Roose have been lost in the centuries since. Bernard notes that Fisher had, for some time before the deaths, been something of a thorn in the King's side over his Great Matter, and it is not impossible that Henry‚Äîpossibly acting through the Earl of Wiltshire, or with the latter working independently, perhaps through his own agents‚Äîintended to frighten or perhaps kill the bishop. The scholar John Matusiak argues that \\"no other critic of the divorce among the kingdom‚Äôs elites would, in fact, be more outspoken and no opponent of the looming breach with Rome would be treated to such levels of intimidation\\" as Fisher. =Misguided prank or accident= Roose was tortured on the rack, where he admitted to putting what he believed to have been laxative‚Äîhe described it as \\"a certain venom or poison\\"‚Äîin the porridge pot as a joke. Dowling notes that he failed to provide any information as to the instigators of the crime, despite being severely tortured, which she argues is an indication that he was persuaded to act on another's behalf. Bernard argues that an accident of this nature is by no means unthinkable. Roose himself claimed that the white powder would cause discomfort and illness but would not be fatal and that the intention was merely to \\"tromper\\" Fisher's servants with a purgative, or as Chapuys reported, to \\"make his fellow servants very sick without endangering their lives or doing them any harm\\". =Roose was persuaded to poison= Bernard suggests Roose's confession raises a number of questions: \\"Was it more sinister than that? [...] And if it was more than a prank that went disastrously wrong, was Fisher its intended victim?\\" Bernard posits that Roose may have been persuaded, by some means, to poison the food; or conversely, that a stranger did so while Roose was absent from the kitchen (for example, on a trip to the buttery). Chapuys himself expressed doubts as to Roose's supposed motivation, and the extant records do not indicate the process by which the authorities settled on Roose as the culprit in the first place. =Another culprit poisoned the food= Hall‚Äîwho provides a detailed and probably reasonably accurate account of the attack‚Äîsuggests that the culprit was not Roose himself, but rather \\"a certain person of a most damnable and wicked disposition\\" known to Roose. Hall relates the story of the buttery, suggesting that this acquaintance had despatched Roose to fetch him more drink and while he was out of the room, poisoned the pottage. =The King's plan= The King, says Lehmberg, was \\"greatly disturbed\\" at the news, not only because of his own paranoia regarding poison but also perhaps fearful that he would be suspected of having paid Roose to kill a royal enemy. Chapuys at least suspected Henry of over-dramatising Roose's crime in a machiavellian effort to distract attention from his and the Boleyns' own poor relations with the bishop. Henry may also have been reacting to a rumour‚Äîa slander‚Äîthat he was at least partially responsible. Such a rumour seems to have gained traction in parts of the country already ill-disposed to the Queen, and had probably been propagated by parties in favour remaining in the Roman church. It is also likely that although Henry was determined to bring England's clergy directly under his control, the situation had not yet worsened to the extent that he wanted to be seen as an open enemy of the church or its leaders. =Anne Boleyn or her father's plan= Chapuys suggests the culprit to have been less likely the King and more likely to be the family of Anne Boleyn, headed by Wiltshire. In his letter of March 1531, he told the Emperor, Chapuys seems to have believed that, while it was realistically unlikely that the King had been involved in the conspiracy‚Äîbeing \\"too noble-minded to have recourse to such means\\"‚ÄîAnne was a different matter. Bellany argues that, to contemporaries, while the involvement of the King in such an affair would have been incredible, \\"poisoning was a crime perfectly suited to an upstart courtier or an ambitious whore\\" such as she. The Spanish Jesuit Pedro de Ribadeneira‚Äîwriting in the 1590s‚Äîplaced the blame firmly on Anne Boleyn herself, writing how \\"she had wished to see Rochester dead ever since he had defended the cause of the queen with such valour. Out of this hatred, she had previously tried to murder him, bribing one of the bishop‚Äôs cooks, called Richard Roose\\". It was, says de Ribadeneira, only God's will that the bishop did not eat as he was presumably expected to, although he also believed that \\"all the servants who did eat died\\". Elizabeth Norton argues that while Boleyn \\"was no murderess\\", the case of the poisoned pottage is indicative of her unpopularity, \\"that anything could be believed of her\\". Legal proceedings Agas map of 1561alt=colour scan of a 1561 woodcut map showing Smithfield =No common law proceedings= Roose was never tried for the crime he was accused of, and had no opportunity to defend himself. Rather, on 28 February the King addressed the Lords of parliament for an hour and a half, mostly on the matter of the poisonings, \\"in a lengthy speech expounding his love of justice and his zeal to protect his subjects and to maintain good order in the realm\\". This highly individual response to a felony‚Äîbased purely on the King's opinion of it‚Äîwas presented as an expression of the King's own virtues: care for his subjects and god's peace. Roose was, therefore, effectively condemned on the strength of Henry's personal interpretation of the events of 18 February rather than evidence, witnesses or confessions. =Bill expanding the definition of treason= The bill was probably written by Henry's councillors‚Äîalthough its brevity suggests to historian William R. Stacy that the King may have drafted it himself‚Äîand underwent adjustments before it was finally promulgated; an earlier draft did not name Roose's victims or call the offence treason (rather it was termed \\"voluntary murder\\"). Kesselring suggests the shift in emphasis from felony to treason stemmed from Henry's political desire to restrict the privilege of benefit of clergy. Bishop Fisher was a staunch defender of the privilege, and, says Kesselring, \\"would not have welcomed an attempt to use the assault upon his household to justify an attack on clerical immunities\\". As a result, the \\"celebrated\\" An Acte for Poysonyng‚Äîan example of 16th-century \\"knee-jerk\\" legislation, according to the historian Robert Hutchinson‚Äîwas passed. Indeed, Lehmberg suggests that \\"despite its barbarity, the bill seems to have passed both Houses easily\\". This is likely to have been because, despite its cruelty, it was seen as politically useful to have a law \\"which enabled the crown to strike down quickly individuals it perceived as particularly threatening and dangerous, and to do so without recourse to the common-law courts\\". Henry's legislation not only \\"enacted a host of capital statutes\\" but eleven such pieces expanded treason's legal definition. It effectively announced murder by poison to be a new phenomenon for the country and for the law. An attainder was presented against Roose, which meant that he was effectively found guilty with no common law proceedings being necessary even though, as a prisoner of the crown, there was no impediment to placing him on trial. As a result of the deaths at Fisher's house, parliament‚Äîprobably at the King's insistence‚Äî passed an act determining that murder by poison would henceforth be treason, to be punished by boiling alive. The act specified that \\"the said poisoning be adjudged high treason; and that the said Richard Roose, for the said murder and poisoning of the said two persons, shall stand, and be attainted of high treason, and shall be therefore boiled to death without benefit of clergy. And that, in future, murder by poisoning shall be adjudged high treason, and the offender deprived of his clergy and boiled to death\\". The act was thus retroactive, in that the law which condemned Roose did not exist‚Äîpoisoning not being classed as treason‚Äî when the crime was committed. Through the act, Justices of the Peace and local assizes were given jurisdiction over treason, although this was effectively limited to coining and poisoning until later in the decade. =Death by boiling= In what has been suggested may have been a deliberate \\"symbolic retribution\\" intending to demonstrate the crown's commitment to law and order, Roose was boiled to death at Smithfield on 15 April 1532 over a period of about two hours. The contemporary Chronicle of the Grey Friars of London described how Roose was tied up in chains, gibbeted and then lowered in and out of the boiling water three times \\"tyll he was dede\\". Although Roose was not the first to suffer such a fate, it was with him that boiling as a form of execution was placed on the statute book. Stacy suggests that in the manner of his execution, there was more intended than \\"simply to mock Roose's occupation as a cook or in a spirit of blind revenge to increase his suffering\\". Rather, Stacy suggests, the method of execution was carefully chosen to re-enact the crime itself, in which Roose boiled poison into the broth. This inextricably linked the crime with its punishment in the eyes of contemporaries. A contemporary described the scene as Roose died: Aftermath Map illustrating the respective positions of Wiltshire's and Fisher's residences Edward Hall describes a curious event taking place shortly after the poisonings. Volleys of gunfire‚Äîprobably from a cannon‚Äîwere apparently shot through the roof of Fisher's house, damaging rafters and slates. Fisher's study, which he was occupying at the time, was close by; Hall alleges that the shooting came from the Earl of Wiltshire's house directly across the Thames. However, the distance between Wiltshire's Durham House on London's Strand and Fisher's palace was, as Dowling remarks, \\"a long one indeed\\". Victorian antiquarian John Lewis also calls the story \\"highly improbable\\". J. J. Scarisbrick noted the close timing between the two attacks, and suggested that the government or its agents may have been implicated in both of them, saying \\"we can make of that story what we will\\". As a result, suggests Hall, Fisher \\"perceived that great malice was meant toward him\\" and declared his intention to leave for Rochester immediately. Chapuys reports that he departed London on 2 March. Scholar Miranda Wilson suggests that Roose's poison \\"did not prove particularly effective as a weapon\\" in what was a \\"botched and isolated attack\\". Had it succeeded, argues Stacy, through the usual course of law, Roose could at most have been convicted of petty treason. The King's reaction, says Bernard, was \\"extraordinary\\", and may indicate a guilty royal conscience, particularly with the punishment being so outlandishly over the top. The change in the legal status of poisoning has been described by Stanford Lehmberg as \\"the most interesting\\" of all the adjustments to the legal code in 1531. Hutchinson has contrasted the rarity of the crime‚Äîwhich the act itself acknowledged‚Äîwith the swiftness of the royal response to it. Cardinal Fisher had been ill ever since the clergy had accepted Henry's new title of Supreme Head of the Church, reported Chapuys, and was further \\"nauseated\\" by the treatment meted out to Roose. Fisher left for his diocese before the raising of the parliamentary session on 31 March. Chapuys speculated on Fisher's reasons for wishing to make such a long journey, \\"especially as he will get better attendance of physicians\\" in London. He considered that either the bishop no longer wished to witness the attacks on his church, or, possibly that \\"he fears that there is some more powder in store for him\\". The ambassador believed Fisher's escape from death to have been an act of God, who, he wrote, \\"no doubt considers [Fisher] very useful and necessary in this world\\". He also suggested that, for his cause, it was a bad time for Fisher to leave Westminster, and wrote that \\"if the King desired to treat of the affair of the Queen, the absence of the said Bishop and of the Bishop of Durham would be unfortunate\\". What Bellany calls the \\"English obsession\\" with poison continued‚Äîindeed, probably increased‚Äîand \\"hysteria\\" over poisoning continued for many years. Death by boiling, however, was used only once more as a method of execution, in March 1542 for another case of poisoning. On this occasion a maidservant, Margaret Davy, suffered this form of execution for poisoning her master and mistress. The act was appealed in 1547 on the accession of Henry's son, Edward VI, whose first parliament described it as \\"very straight, sore, extreme, and terrible\\", and reclassified it as a felony as thus subject to the more usual punishment‚Äîusually hanging for men and burning for women. Most of the more well-known attainders which followed that of Roose were matters of state, but two‚Äîintroduced by Thomas Cromwell‚Äîwere directly influenced by the precedent of the 1531 attainder. These both favoured a parliamentary attainder absent of the need for prior judicial proceedings. This, says the legal scholar Molly Murray, made attainder \\"an efficient means of confining and condemning his enemies without cumbersome and time-consuming judicial proceedings\\". Perception =Of contemporaries= The case made a significant impact on contemporaries‚ÄîChapuys called it a \\"very extraordinary case\\"‚Äîwho found it \\"fascinating, puzzling and instructive\\". Lipscomb has noted that, whereas attempting to kill a bishop in 1531 was punishable by a painful death, it was \\"an irony perhaps not lost on others four years later\\", when Fisher, in turn, was sent to the block. The case remained a cause celebre into the next century. It was seen as an innovative form of crime to the English political class‚ÄîA. F. Pollard says that \\"however familiar poisoning might be at Rome, it was a novel method in England\\"‚Äîand the case \\"transformed [poisoning] from a bit part to a star performer\\", and that while all murder was a crime against God and the King, there was something about poisoning that made it worse, for it was against \\"good obedyance and order\\". Poison was seen as infecting not just the bodies of its victims, but the body politic generally. Stacy has argued that it was less the target of the attempted murder than the method used in doing so that worried contemporaries, and so it was this that accounts for both the elevation of Roose's crime to treason and the brutality with which it was punished; Alison Sim describes how \\"poison made no differentiation between the life of a \\"gentlyman\\" and that of a \\"pore Woman\\"; it was also linked to the supernatural in contemporary imagination: the Latin veneficum translated both as poisoning and sorcery. Edward Coke, Chief Justice under King James I, said that the punishment was \\"too severe to live long\\". Nevertheless, he referenced the Roose case several times, as did Francis Bacon, in their prosecution of Robert Carr and Frances Howard for the poisoning of Thomas Overbury in 1615; Bacon called the crime of poisoning \\"grievous beyond other matters\\". Specifically Bacon argued that‚Äîas the Roose case demonstrated‚Äîpoison can rarely be confined to its intended target, and that often \\"men die other men's deaths\\". He also emphasised that the crime was not just against the person, but against society. Notes Wilson: \\"for Bacon, the 16th-century story of Roose retains both cultural currency and argumentative relevance in Jacobean England\\". Roose's attainder was cited in the 1641 attainder of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford. =Of historians= Wilson argues that historians have under-examined Roose's case, except when discussing broader historiographies, such as that of attainder, or relations between Henry and Fisher; Stacy suggests that it has been \\"overshadowed by the multitude of attainders soon to follow\\". It is also significant, Wilson says, as being the point where poisoning‚Äîboth legally and in the popular imagination‚Äî\\"does acquire a vigorous cultural presence missing in earlier treatments\\". Bellany suggests that the case \\"starkly revealed the poisoner's unnerving power to subvert the order and betray the intimacies that bound household and community together\\". In other words, the former was a microcosm of the latter. The secrecy with which the lower-class could subvert their superior's authority, and the wider damage this was seen to do, explains why the Acte for Poysonyngs directly compares poisoning as a crime with that of coining. Penry Williams suggests that the Roose case, and particularly the elevation of poisoning to a crime of high treason, is an example of a broader, more endemic, extension of capital offences under the Tudors and Henry VIII in particular. Elton suggested that the 1531 act \\"was in fact the dying echo of an older common law attitude which could at times be negligent of the real meaning of the word\\". Kesselring disputes Elton's interpretation, arguing that, far from being an accidental throwback, the act was \\"a conscious decision made to circumvent the law and to avoid political difficulties.\\" Kesselring also questions why‚Äîalthough it may be understandable why the King pressed to attaint Roose‚Äîparliament so easily agreed to his demand, or broadened the definition of treason as they did. It was not as if the change brought profit to Henry: \\"the act stipulated that forfeitures would go not to the king but to the lord of the fee, as in cases of felony\\". This, Bellamy suggests, may have been Henry's way of persuading the Lords to support the measure, as in most cases they could expect to receive the goods and chattels of the convicted. Bellamy considers, that fundamentally, although the act was an innovation in statute law, it still \\"managed to contain all the most obnoxious features of its varied predecessors\\". Elton argues that Henry and Cromwell had \\"a rigid regard for the forms of trial and conviction at common law\\"; if the Roose attainder had been the only example of its kind, argues Stacy, \\"it might be regarded as no more than an interesting if abhorrent aberration\\". However, it was merely the first of many such circumventions of common law in Henry's reign, and calls into question the suggestion that the period was \\"an age of legalism, with respect for due process of law and conformity to past practice\\". Stacy has argued that the Roose case is the first example of an attainder intended to avoid resorting to the common law, and that although it has been overshadowed by subsequent cases of greater political import it was the precedent upon which they were prosecuted. Although attainder was a common parliamentary weapon for late-medieval English kings, it was effectively a form of outlawry, usually to supplement a common or martial law verdict with the confiscation of land and wealth as its intended result. The scholar Suzannah Lipscomb has argued that not only were attainders increasingly used from the 1530s but that the decade shows the heaviest use of the mechanism in the whole of English history, while Stacy suggests that Henrician ministers resorted to the parliamentary attainder as a matter of routine. Attainders were popular with the King, Lipscomb suggests, because they could take the place of common law rather than merely augment it, \\"without needing to cite specific evidence or name precise crimes\\". The Roose attainder laid the groundwork for the famous treason attainders that punctuated the rest of Henry's reign. =Cultural depiction= Shakespeare referenced Roose's execution in The Winter's Tale when the character of Paulina demands of King Leontes: What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me? What wheels, racks, fires? What flaying? Boiling In leads or oils? What old or newer torture Must I receive... Poison, argues Bellany, was a popular motif among Shakespeare and his contemporaries as it tapped into a basic fear of the unknown, and poisoning stories were so often about more than merely the crime itself: Roose's attempt to poison Fisher is portrayed in the first episode of the second series of The Tudors, Everything Is Beautiful in 2008. Roose is played by Gary Murphy in a \\"highly fictionalised\\" account of the case, in which the ultimate blame is placed on the Earl of Wiltshire‚Äîwho provides the poison‚Äîwith Roose merely his catspaw. The episode suggests that Roose is bribable because he has three daughters for whom he wants good marriages. Having paid Roose to poison the soup, Wiltshire then threatens to exterminate the cook's family if he ever speaks. Sir Thomas More takes the news of the poisoning to Henry, who becomes angry at the suggestion of Anne's involvement. Both Wiltshire and Cromwell witness the \\"particularly gruesome scene\\" where Roose is executed; the latter is shown to walk out halfway through. Hilary Mantel includes the poisoning in her fictional life of Thomas Cromwell, Wolf Hall, from whose perspective events are related. Without naming Roose personally, Mantel covers the poisoning and its environs in some detail. She has the poisoned broth, the only dish that the victims had had in common that night, according to serving boys; Cromwell, while understanding that \\"there are poisons nature herself brews\\", is in no doubt that a crime had been committed from the start. The cook, captured, explains that \\"a man. A stranger who had said it would be a good joke\\" had given the cook the poison.

Life and career Bahah received his BCom and MCom (1992) from Pune University in India. In 2011, Bahah actively backed the revolution in Yemen beginning in March, demanding that President Ali Abdullah Saleh resign and avoid further bloodshed. He quit the ruling party on account of the Saleh administration's violence against its own citizens. He continued to serve as Yemeni Ambassador to Canada.\\"Yemen Live Blog - March 21\\", Al Jazeera English. 21 March 2011. President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi named Bahah, then serving as Permanent Representative to the United Nations, as Prime Minister-designate on 13 October 2014, with the assent of Houthis who seized the capital the previous month. He took office as Prime Minister on 9 November 2014. However, on 22 January 2015, after heavy fighting around the presidential compound, President Hadi and Prime Minister Bahah submitted their resignations and the cabinet dissolved, leaving Yemen without a government. Bahah was ordered to return to work by the Houthis after the House of Representatives was reinstated and Hadi escaped to Aden in late February 2015, but he and his former ministers reportedly refused. In March 2015, Bahah was released from house arrest and he immediately left Sana'a. While in exile in Saudi Arabia during the civil war between his supporters and the Houthis, Hadi named Bahah as Vice President on 12 April 2015. An aide to Hadi expressed hope that Bahah's appointment would help bring about a \\"political solution\\" to the conflict. Le Monde described Bahah as \\"a man of consensus\\" and suggested he could step in as an acceptable successor to Hadi if the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen was successful in restoring the exiled government to power. Bahah returned to Aden with several other ministers \\"to stay permanently\\" on 16 September 2015, according to a government spokesman, amid loyalist and coalition gains in the south.

He was Ambassador to Saudi Arabia between 2005 and 2012. In March 2011 he publicly sided with the youth protesters who were demanding a change of government during the Yemeni Revolution. Early life and education Al-Ahwal was born in Bayhan District, Yemen on 12 December 1950. He was from the Almusobein tribe of Ain District of Shabwa. Al-Ahwal attended elementary and middle school in Yemen, then moved to Egypt to pursue his secondary education and university studies. He graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce and Economics degree from Ain Shams University in 1974. He also earned a degree in Finance and Economics from the University of Ottawa in Canada and received a certificate from the International Monetary Fund in Washington. His study areas included finance policies, financing, central and commercial banking, computing and investment. Career In 1975 al-Ahwal obtained a position in the Central Bank of Yemen. He served as Director General of the bank from 1985 to 1995. Al-Ahwal was a member of the General Committee of the General People's Congress from 1990 to 1998. He was a member of the Presidential Council from 1991 to 1994. In 1992 he was promoted to Deputy Prime Minister (Finance). Al-Ahwal received the Order of Yemeni Unity in 1994. He was in charge of land and real estate in Yemen between 1995 and 1998. Al-Ahwal was appointed Consul General in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia from 1998 until 2005, with ambassadorial rank. From 2002 to 2005 he was dean of the consular corps in Jeddah. Al-Ahwal was appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Yemen to Saudi Arabia by presidential decree of 19 November 2005. He was also Permanent Representative to the Organization of the Islamic Conference in Jeddah, and Yemen's ambassador to the General Secretariat of the Gulf Cooperation Council. One of the issues he had to deal with was the condition of camps in Saudi Arabia of Yemenis displaced by the fighting between the Yemeni government and the Houthis. The Saudis were refusing to aid refugees and turning them back to Yemen. In a meeting in Riyadh in April 2010 to discuss this issue with Abdul Rahman bin Hamad Al Attiyah, secretary general of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Al-Ahwal was assured that the Arab states of the Persian Gulf saw Yemen's security as part of their security. On 21 March 2011 The Guardian reported that al-Ahwal had resigned in sympathy with the youth revolution in Yemen. According to Al Jazeera, Ahwal had said \\"I announce my support for the youth revolution, and for change in Yemen\\" but his statement did not make it clear whether he was leaving his post or resigning from Saleh's ruling party. The protesters were demanding the departure of president Ali Abdullah Saleh. Al-Ahwal's statement followed similar steps from dozens of military and tribal leaders in Yemen. The Yemeni ambassador in Egypt, Abdul-Wali al-Shameri, said that the ambassadors who had announced they were joining the rebels would continue to represent the Yemeni people in Egypt and the Arab League. In April 2013 it was reported that al-Ahwal had been recalled from his post as acting ambassador to Saudi Arabia after the signature of a memorandum of understanding on Yemeni expatriates with Saudi recruitment firms. The Saudi authorities were escalating efforts to deport Yemeni workers who were not covered by contracts. There was some confusion over whether the report reflected the official Yemeni position. It was reported that Al-Ahwal had resigned seven months earlier and was now based in Sanaa. Death Al-Ahwal died at dawn on Friday 13 December 2013 at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh, to which he had been admitted several days earlier. He was aged 63. His body was taken to the Yemeni capital of Sana'a. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs organized a memorial service for him under the patronage of President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, President of the Republic, attended by many diplomats, politicians and public figures. He was praised for his work in assisting Yemeni expatriates in Saudi Arabia and his role in the development of relations between Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Ali Abdullah Saleh, President of the General People's Congress, was among those who sent telegrams of condolences.

A large sturdy cream- or buff-coloured funnel-shaped mushroom, it grows in mixed woodlands, often in troops or fairy rings, one of which is over half a mile wide. Although edible, it could be confused with some poisonous species of similar colouration and size. Taxonomy and naming French mycologist Pierre Bulliard initially described the trooping funnel as Agaricus geotropus in 1792, before Lucien Qu√©let renamed it Clitocybe geotropa (a name by which it was long known) in 1872. Its specific epithet derived from the Ancient Greek words /gƒì \\"earth\\", and œÑœÅœåœÄŒøœÇ/tropos \\"turn\\". Finnish mycologist Harri Harmaja proposed I. geotropa and twelve other Clitocybe species be split off into a new genus Infundibulicybe, thus the new binomial name is Infundibulicybe geotropa. Young specimens with distinctly bossed small caps Description A cream- or buff-coloured mushroom, the cap may reach in diameter. It has a prominent boss and looks small in relation to the large stem in young specimens. As the mushroom ages, the cap changes from convex with inrolled margins to more funnel shaped. The decurrent gills are the same colour as the cap. The stipe is bulbous, larger at the base and high. The spore print is white. There is a sweet smell, which has been likened to the odour of bitter almonds. The white flesh is firm in young specimens. It can be mistaken for the similar-coloured and also edible miller (Clitopilus prunulus), but the latter species has pink spores. However, there are a number of similar white or pale mushrooms which are poisonous; young specimens of Entoloma sinuatum can be distinguished by their sinuate gills and mealy smell. The unpleasant-tasting Melanoleuca grammopodia is similar, but has a more pale brownish cap and musky odour. Distribution and habitat Trooping funnel is found in mixed woodlands, especially grassy clearings, in autumn. Often gregarious, it can form fairy rings, and has a complex mycelium. It is abundant and widespread in Europe, and less common in North America. One fairy ring in Belfort, eastern France, has been reported at over half a mile in diameter and estimated at 800 years of age. It is thought to be the largest known fairy ring. Edibility Only young mushrooms are recommended eating, as older ones lose their pleasant taste, and the flesh becomes leathery in consistency. The stipes of all aged specimens are generally discarded. The fungus is popular in northern Italy, where it is roasted or cooked in stews and frittatas, or preserved in oil.

Its purpose was to enable scientific research based on advanced computer simulations and large-scale computations using the computer clusters, and to provide convenient access to the computer resources for research teams, also outside the communities, in which the High Performance Computing centers operate. The history In the first decade of the twenty-first century in most European countries advanced Grid programs have been created. Besides, the European and worldwide consolidation took place in form of various projects, which concerned the Grid technology and HPC: EGEE, e-IRG, PRACE, DEISA and OMII-Europe. Poland has also undertaken efforts to build the National Grid,PL- Grid - Koncepcja budowy og√≥lnopolskiej infrastruktury Gridowej, Zofia Mosurska, Kazimierz Wiatr, AGH bulletin, p. 13-14, 10.2007. because without such infrastructure it would not be possible for Polish scientific communities to participate in many research programs, particularly in the EU 7th Framework Programme. Another reason to initiate steps towards the Polish Grid creation was the fact that in Poland the number of intensively cooperating, geographically dispersed research teams, was increasing. In case of such cooperation, tools for gathering and sharing of accumulated knowledge on a global scale were essential. In 2007, with the support of almost all European countries, EGI Design Study project was created. Its goal was to prepare the rules of integration of national Grids (National Grid Initiatives) in Europe into a stable, production infrastructure - European Grid Initiative - which would begin its operation in 2010. It helped start work on establishing National Grid Initiative in Poland already in 2007, by setting up the PL-Grid Consortium. PL-Grid Consortium, project and infrastructure The PL-Grid Consortium was established by five Polish supercomputing and networking centers: * Academic Computer Centre Cyfronet AGH, Krak√≥w (the coordinator) * Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling, Warsaw University, Warsaw * Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center, Pozna≈Ñ * Information Center of the Academic Computer Network, Gda≈Ñsk * Wroclaw Centre for Networking and Supercomputing, Wroc≈Çaw In 2009-2011, the activity of the Consortium was supported by the PL-Grid project,News from the National Grid Initiatives - Poland, Zofia Mosurska, Jacek Kitowski, EGI Newsletter, p. 3, 11.2009.Project profile: PL-Grid , D.

The result of the operation of the Consortium was the establishment of the Polish Grid Infrastructure PL-Grid, formed by the merger of new, powerful computational resources, purchased and installed in the data centers belonging to the PL-Grid Consortium. Computational resources Computational resources available in the Polish Grid Infrastructure PL-Grid include (at the end of the PL-Grid project): 5.8 PBytes of storage capacity and 588 TFlops of computing power. One of the clusters within Polish Grid Infrastructure is Zeus - supercomputer installed in Academic Computer Centre Cyfronet AGH University of Science and Technology in Krak√≥w - in 2010, 2011 and 2012, the most efficient supercomputer in Poland. Enabled software packages On the PL-Grid infrastructure resources there are available scientific software packages which allow researchers in the field of biology, quantum chemistry, physics, numerical computations and simulation to conduct large-scale computations: ADF, AMBER, AutoDock, BLAST, Blender, CFOUR, Clustal, CPMD, Dalton, FLUENT, GAMESS, Gaussian, GROMACS, Mathematica, Matlab, Meep, MOLPRO, MOPAC, NAMD, NWChem, OpenFOAM, POV-Ray, R and TURBOMOLE. Implemented tools Within the PL-Grid infrastructure, there are available several tools that support design and running the scientific applications on the distributed computational resources, organization of computational experiments, visualization of applications' results and resources management: g-Eclipse, GridSpace2,Exploratory Programming in the Virtual Laboratory, Eryk Ciepiela, Daniel Harƒô≈ºlak, Joanna Kocot, Tomasz Bartynski, Marek Kasztelnik, Piotr Nowakowski, Tomasz Guba≈Ça, Maciej Malawski, Marian Bubak, Proceedings of the International Multiconference on Computer Science and Information Technology 2010, pp. 621‚Äì628, 10.2010.

Aside from user-end tools, several software packages for administrators have also been developed, namely ACARM-ng and KeyFS. These security-related projects are also useful as a standalone solutions, being PL-Grid's contribution to an open source community. Innovation in PL-Grid The creation of the national grid infrastructure was an enterprise with a very large potential of innovation, mentioned in all government documents setting the directions of the development of the Polish science, technology and economy. To fulfill the aim ‚ÄûGrowth of the competitiveness of the Polish science‚Äù of the Innovative Economy Operational Program, the science sector must have been strengthened by provision of the suitable research base. The grid infrastructure constituted such a base, on which the specialized systems specific for various fields of science were created, involving services and tools oriented on the used types of applications.

Pratt visited the Guadalupe Mountains in 1921, and taking a liking to the place, he bought a quarter share of the McCombs Ranch. In 1929 Pratt bought out his partners, ending up owning a large portion of the canyon, which featured waterfalls flowing over travertine dams, a lush, quiet place in the high desert. In the winter of 1931-1932 Pratt started construction of a house in the canyon, designed by noted Houston architect John F. Staub, who also designed the Pratt's Houston residence. In charge of construction was Vance Phenix, Staub's former employee and residential architect. Vance's brother Dean, a carpenter, and stonemason Adolph May were key craftsmen on the project. The cabin was built of local limestone and heart pine. The Pratt family spent summers at the cabin, which they called the Stone Cabin, and briefly lived there during Wallace Pratt's early retirement. An earlier experience being trapped at the Stone Cabin during a flood caused Pratt to reconsider its use as a full-time residence, so a second home, the Ship On The Desert, was constructed outside of the canyon. At some time during construction, probably in 1945, The Stone Cabin was used as a residence by the Ship On the Desert's New York architect, Newton Bevin, and his wife Elizabeth. After moving to Tucson, Arizona, Pratt donated the Stone Cabin, the Ship On the Desert, and surrounding lands of more than to the National Park Service, forming the nucleus of Guadalupe Mountains National Park. The cabin was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 26, 1975.

Health insurance fraud occurs when a company or an individual defrauds an insurer or government health care program, such as Medicare (United States) or equivalent State programs. The manner in which this is done varies, and persons engaging in fraud are always seeking new ways to circumvent the law. Damages from fraud can be recovered by use of the False Claims Act, most commonly under the qui tam provisions which rewards an individual for being a \\"whistleblower\\", or relator (law). Recent news and statistics The FBI estimates that Health Care Fraud costs American tax payers $80 billion a year. Of this amount $2.5 billion was recovered through False Claims Act cases in FY 2010. Most of these cases were filed under qui tam provisions. Over the course of FY 2010, whistleblowers were paid a total of $307,620,401.00 for their part in bringing the cases forward. Types There are several different schemes used to defraud the Health care system. *Billing for services not rendered *Upcoding of services *Upcoding of items *Duplicate claims *Unbundling *Excessive services *Unnecessary services *Kickbacks *Copied and pasted entries into the medical recordVA inspector says Alabama doctor's acts may be insurance fraud. USA TODAY NETWORK Mary Troyan. Montgomery Advertiser July 29, 2014. http://usat.ly/1mYBGqf =Billing for services not rendered= Often done as a way of billing Medicare for things that never happened. This can involve forging the signature of those enrolled in Medicare, and the use of bribes or \\"kickbacks\\" to corrupt medical professionals. =Upcoding of services= Billing Medicare programs for services that are more costly than the actual procedure that was done. =Upcoding of items= Similar to upcoding of services, but involving the use of medical equipment. An example is billing Medicare for a power-assisted wheelchair while only giving the patient a manual wheelchair. =Duplicate claims= In this case a provider does not submit exactly the same bill, but changes some small portion like the date in order to charge Medicare twice for the same service rendered. Rather than a single claim being filed twice, the same service is billed two times in an attempt to be paid twice. =Unbundling= Bills for a particular service are submitted in piecemeal, that appear to be staggered out over time. These services would normally cost less when bundled together, but by manipulating the claim, a higher charge is billed to Medicare resulting in a higher pay out to the party committing the fraud. =Excessive services= Occurs when Medicare is billed for something greater than what the level of actual care requires. This can include medical related equipment as well as services. =Unnecessary services= Unlike excessive services, this fraudulent scheme occurs when claims are filed for care that in no way applies to the condition of a patient, such as an echo cardiogram billed for a patient with a sprained ankle. =Kickbacks= Kickbacks are rewards such as cash, jewelry, free vacations, corporate sponsored retreats, or other lavish gifts used to entice medical professionals into using specific medical services. This could be a small cash kickback for the use of an MRI when not required, or a lavish doctor/patient retreat that is funded by a pharmaceutical company to entice the prescription and use of a particular drug. Other forms of payment that could be illegal kickbacks include paid speaking positions at events, consulting contracts, and research grants. People engaging in this type of fraud are also subject to the federal Anti-Kickback statute. Examples In the case United States ex rel. Donigian v. St. Jude Medical, Inc., No. 06-CA-11166-DPW (D. Mass.) St. Jude Medical, Inc. agreed to pay $16 million to quiet allegations of paying kickbacks to physicians. The whistleblower was able to provide detailed insider information as to the nature of the kickbacks, which ranged from entertainment to sporting event tickets and other gifts. The relator in this case was awarded $2.64 million. The case United States et al., ex rel. Jim Conrad and Constance Conrad v. Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc, et al., No. 02-cv-11738-NG (D. Mass.) involved a drug manufacturer selling a drug, Levothroid, that had never been approved by the FDA. These allegations settled for $42.5 million due to multiple whistleblowers stepping forward to provide detailed information on the alleged fraud. The collective reward to the relators in this case was over $14.6 million. Copied and pasted entries into the Electronic Medical Record may constitute fraud. A U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration pulmonologist at the Montgomery, Alabama facility copied and pasted data entered by other physicians into electronic medical records that he signed. The VA Office of the Medical Inspector reported this finding to Congress in 2013. In the UAE, some doctors and hospital managers have done a lot of fraud. They conduct unnecessary surgeries so that they can make extra money. In the case United States ex rel. Brown v. Celgene Corp., CV10-3165, drug company Celgene agreed to pay $280 million on the eve of trial. The settlement resolved allegations that the company marketed and sold cancer drugs Thalomid and Revlimid for non-FDA approved uses. Reporting fraud There are many ways to report cases of fraud. If a patient or health care provider believes they have witnessed Health Care Fraud, they are encouraged to contact the FBI via either their local office, telephone, or the online tips form. If, however, they want to ensure the government actively investigates the alleged fraud, they are encouraged to contact legal counsel from an experienced firm that specializes in qui tam litigation under the False Claims Act. A good legal team can advise potential whistleblowers of their rights, protections, and what evidence is necessary to solidify a case against the group leading the fraud.

The Kanhadade Prabandha names the Delhi princess as Piroja, and mentions that Alauddin offered to marry her to the Viramadeva, stating the couple had also been married in several previous births. However, Viramadeva rejected the offer, leading to Alauddin's invasion of Jalore. Nainsi's Khyat claims that Viramadeva temporarily stayed at the court of Delhi, where Alauddin offered to marry his daughter to the Chahamana prince. Viramadeva did not want to marry the Khalji princess, but could not openly refuse the offer. He asked for Alauddin's permission to return to Jalore, promising to return with a marriage party. When he did not return, Alauddin invaded Jalore. The legendary narrative about Piroja's love for Viramade is purely imaginary. The Kanhadade Prabandha states that the first army sent by Alauddin besieged Jalore for 7 days, but the sorties led by Viramadeva and his uncle Maladeva foiled the invaders' attempt to capture the fort. On the 8th day, a severe thunderstorm forced the besiegers to retreat. The Jalore forces launched an eight-pronged attack on one of the retreating detachments at Moklana, with Viramadeva leading one of the Jalore contingents. The Delhi detachment's commander Shams Khan was captured along with his harem, while the rest of his soldiers fled. After this setback, Alauddin dispatched a stronger army led by Malik Kamaluddin. According to the Kanhadade Prabandha, the Jalore contingents led by Maladeva and Viramadeva attacked the invading army on alternate days. Although they managed to slow down Kamaluddin's march, they were unable to stop his gradual advance towards Jalore. Ultimately, Viramadeva, who was stationed at Bhadrajun, was recalled to Jalore to help his father prepared for the impending siege. Maladeva was also recalled, but was re-sent to fight Kamaluddin once the invaders reached near Jalore. Sometime after besieging the fort, Kamaluddin managed to breach it with the help of a traitor named Bika. Facing a certain defeat, the defenders prepared for a last stand, and Viramadeva was crowned King. The women of the fort committed suicide by jauhar (mass self-immolation), while the men died fighting. Viramadeva is said to have died two-and-a-half days after the coronation. The Kanhadade Prabandha states that Viramadeva's head was brought to Alauddin. It miraculously turned away when the Sultan turned towards it. Piroja immolated herself while holding his head.

After retiring from the NYPD he wrote novels, short stories, TV episodes and a memoir of his years on the force. He taught and had residencies at over forty universities and law schools, and lectured on morality and ethics erosion at many US police departments and the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia. Leuci knew Frank Serpico, known for being the first officer to expose corruption within the police department ranks. The book (by Robert Daley) and the film Prince of the City are based on a portion of Leuci's police career. Early years Leuci was born in Brooklyn, New York, on February 28, 1940, to an Italian-American family. He is the son of James Leuci, a union official, and Lucy, a housewife. Right after his birth the family moved to Ozone Park, Queens, where he attended John Adams High School. After high school he attended Baker University in Kansas, and New York University, Fordham University as well as The New School for Social Research in New York City. NYPD career At nineteen, Leuci took the test to enter the New York City Police Academy. At twenty-one, he graduated, becoming a member of the NYPD. As a rookie, he was assigned to the 100th Precinct in Rockaway Beach, Queens. In 1962, he transferred to the Tactical Patrol Force, where he worked the Manhattan North and South Bronx precincts. In TPF, he worked in the city's highest crime areas. Leuci established relationships with street contacts and became one of the top arresting officers in the division. Leuci was transferred to the Narcotics Bureau for undercover work when he was 24. He created a network of field informants that led him to work numerous important cases; one of his first assignments was as a student who bought drugs at a high school. It wasn't long before Leuci entered the Special Investigative Unit (SIU) of the narcotics bureau, an elite unit formed by top detectives. In SIU, street dealers' cases no longer represented his team's objective. Rather, the unit aimed to find the major sources of drug distribution in the country and make cases against South American or other foreign cartel operatives. Corruption investigation The late 1960s were times in which NYPD officers like Frank Serpico and David Durk began battling widespread corruption within the NYPD. In the 1970s, Serpico and Durk came to believe that Leuci was the only honest detective in the New York City Police Department's narcotics bureau, though at the time, he was one of the corrupt. In 1970, as a result of Serpico and Durk's revelations, New York City Mayor John V. Lindsay, along with a five- member investigative committee, created the Knapp Commission, named after its Chairman, Judge Whitman Knapp. Soon afterward, the commission began questioning several members of the force, from patrolmen to high-ranking officials. Serpico and Durk both asked Leuci if he would speak to Assistant US Attorney Nick Scoppetta. Leuci and Scoppetta developed a close relationship almost immediately. Leuci pointed out that the Knapp commission was focused only on the police and that was unacceptable; the criminal justice system in New York City was corrupt as well and the police were working within a system that had been in place for fifty years or more. Leuci told Scoppetta he would not be involved in an investigation that focused solely on the police department. However, if Scoppetta was willing, Leuci would do the undercover work of an investigation into the entire system. Scoppetta agreed. Leuci was given a code name: Sonny. Scopetta and his colleague Michael Shaw soon understood Leuci's emotional conflict about what he was being asked to do. They supported him knowing it would be the start of harsh times for law enforcement in the city. From that moment on, Leuci wore a wire whenever he had to meet with any of the subjects the group was after. Future New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was part of the investigation. It was a short time later that Giuliani became the US Attorney for the Southern District. Leuci's cooperation lasted two years, after which the SIU no longer existed. Detectives and other officers, along with lawyers and many who had tied into the aforementioned corrupt criminal justice system, were tried in court and imprisoned. Some of Leuci's colleagues committed suicide as the pressure mounted throughout the investigation. The investigation ended in 1972 and ultimately, the Federal Government decided not to prosecute Leuci, noting his efforts and the risks he and his family had taken. His experience inspired former NYPD Deputy Commissioner Robert Daley, who had become a writer since retirement. In 1978, through Leuci's recount of this story, Daley's best- selling book Prince of the City was published. By that time, Leuci's work in the Department had taken a toll but he continued working at the Academy as a lecturer, and in the Internal Affairs Division until his retirement in 1981. That same year, director Sidney Lumet and executive producer Jay Presson Allen adapted the book to a critically acclaimed though financially disappointing movie. Award-winning actor Treat Williams portrayed Leuci. After the NYPD Leuci's desire to write grew after Daley's book was published, and thanks to an afternoon walk with novelist Robert Stone, a new career path began. Leuci wrote seven successful books and continued to lecture at police academies and federal law enforcement agencies throughout the United States. Leuci's books have sold in the US, France, Spain, England, Germany and Croatia. He also participated at several writers' conferences in Europe. In 1999 he received the South County Center for the Arts Literary Prize. He was an Adjunct Professor of English and Political Science at the University of Rhode Island. Personal life Leuci was married to Regina, a woman of Italian descent. They had two children, Anthony and Santina, and divorced in 1990. Leuci married Kathy Packard in 2003, after he had moved to Rhode Island to pursue his writing and teaching career. They lived on the Narragansett Bay. Leuci died on October 12, 2015 at the age of 75 after complications from surgery.

Theda was the granddaughter and heiress of the chief Focko Ukena (died 1436) and was born in 1432 in Oldersum as the daughter of Uko Fockena and Heba Attena of Dornum. She was probably named after her grandmother Theda of Reide, the first wife of Focko Ukena. Her father was assassinated in June 1432. In 1455 she was second wife of Ulrich I Cirksena, who had been Count of East Frisia since 1454. Between 1457 and 1465, they had six children: Heba, Gela, Enno I, Edzard I the Great, Ucko and Almuth. Theda brought, among other claims, Oldersum into the marriage, which considerably weakened the ruling chief Wiard of Oldersum. After Ulrich's death in 1466 she took over the official business of the house Cirksena. She was assisted by the chief Sibet Attena. She ruled until about 1480, when her sons sons Enno I and Edzard I came of age. Theda died on 16 November 1494 in Greetsiel.

He was the son of Jacob De Liemaker, a painter upon glass, and is said by Descamps to have been a pupil of Markus Geeraerts the younger, but as the latter joined his father in London in 1580, it is most likely that he studied under Otto van Veen at Antwerp. He attained high rank in his profession, and in 1625 returned to Ghent, where he died in 1646. The Museum of Ghent and the churches of that city and of other towns of Flanders possess a great number of his works.

In English, his name is sometimes given as Ercole Abbate, Abate or Abati. The eldest son of Giulio Camillo dell' Abbate, and grandson of Niccolo, Ercole was born at Modena about the year 1563. His father, Pietro Paolo, was also a painter. Ercole's first works date from 1596. He possessed an extraordinary genius for the arts, which he disgraced by the depravity and intemperance of his conduct. Like most artists of that character, his works were the productions of negligence and haste. He painted, in concurrence with Bartolommeo Schedone, some pictures representing scenes in the Life of Hercules, in the Council-hall at Modena. He is said to have followed the style of his great-uncle, Niccol√≤ dell'Abbate (died 1571). In 1604 - 1608, he contributed to the decoration of the Sala del Consiglio of Modena. He painted a St Francis of Assisi shown clear water ampule by an Angel for a room in the Palazzo Comunale, and an Annunciation for the church of the Madonna del Paradiso in Modena. He painted a Holy Martyrs Faustino and Giovita for the church of the same name. He also painted an Annunciation for the church of San Pietro, Modena. He died at Modena. The Galleria Estense has three works by this artist‚Äî an 'Annunciation,' a 'Presentation in the Temple,' and a 'Birth of St. John the Baptist.' A 'Marriage of the Virgin,' in the same gallery, is by some attributed to Ercole dell' Abbate, and by others to his son, Pietro Paolo, the younger.

The functional equation :L(œÅ,s) = Œµ(œÅ,s)L(œÅ‚à®,1‚àís) of an Artin L-function has an elementary function Œµ(œÅ,s) appearing in it, equal to a constant called the Artin root number times an elementary real function of s, and Langlands discovered that Œµ(œÅ,s) can be written in a canonical way as a product :Œµ(œÅ,s) = Œ† Œµ(œÅv, s, œàv) of local constants Œµ(œÅv, s, œàv) associated to primes v. Tate proved the existence of the local constants in the case that œÅ is 1-dimensional in Tate's thesis. proved the existence of the local constant Œµ(œÅv, s, œàv) up to sign. The original proof of the existence of the local constants by used local methods and was rather long and complicated, and never published. later discovered a simpler proof using global methods. Properties The local constants Œµ(œÅ, s, œàE) depend on a representation œÅ of the Weil group and a choice of character œàE of the additive group of E. They satisfy the following conditions: *If œÅ is 1-dimensional then Œµ(œÅ, s, œàE) is the constant associated to it by Tate's thesis as the constant in the functional equation of the local L-function. * Œµ(œÅ1‚äïœÅ2, s, œàE) = Œµ(œÅ1, s, œàE)Œµ(œÅ2, s, œàE). As a result, Œµ(œÅ, s, œàE) can also be defined for virtual representations œÅ. *If œÅ is a virtual representation of dimension 0 and E contains K then Œµ(œÅ, s, œàE) = Œµ(IndE/KœÅ, s, œàK) Brauer's theorem on induced characters implies that these three properties characterize the local constants. showed that the local constants are trivial for real (orthogonal) representations of the Weil group. Notational conventions There are several different conventions for denoting the local constants. *The parameter s is redundant and can be combined with the representation œÅ, because Œµ(œÅ, s, œàE) = Œµ(œÅ‚äós, 0, œàE) for a suitable character . *Deligne includes an extra parameter dx consisting of a choice of Haar measure on the local field. Other conventions omit this parameter by fixing a choice of Haar measure: either the Haar measure that is self dual with respect to œà (used by Langlands), or the Haar measure that gives the integers of E measure 1. These different conventions differ by elementary terms that are positive real numbers.

Richard Stevens describing the application programming interface of the UNIX family of operating systems. The book illustrates UNIX application programming in the C programming language. The first edition of the book was published by Addison-Wesley in 1992. It covered programming for the two popular families of the Unix operating system, the Berkeley Software Distribution (in particular 4.3 BSD and 386BSD) and AT&T;'s UNIX System V (particularly SVR4). The book covers system calls for operations on single file descriptors, special calls like ioctl that operate on file descriptors, and operations on files and directories. It covers the stdio section of the C standard library, and other parts of the library as needed. The several chapters concern the APIs that control processes, process groups, daemons, inter-process communication, and signals. One chapter is devoted to the Unix terminal control and another to the pseudo terminal concept and to libraries like termcap and curses that build atop it. Stevens adds three chapters giving more concrete examples of Unix programming: he implements a database library, communicates with a PostScript printer, and with a modem. The book does not cover network programming: this is the subject of Stevens' 1990 book UNIX Network Programming and his subsequent three-volume TCP/IP Illustrated. Stevens died in 1999, leaving a second edition incomplete. With the increasing popularity and technical diversification of Unix derivatives, and largely compatible systems like the Linux environment, the code and coverage of Stevens' original became increasingly outdated. Working with Stevens' unfinished notes, Stephen A. Rago completed a second edition which Addison- Wesley published in 2005. This added support for FreeBSD, Linux, Sun's Solaris, and Apple's Darwin, and added coverage of multithreaded programming with POSIX Threads. The second edition features a foreword by Dennis Ritchie and a Unix-themed Dilbert strip by Scott Adams. The book has been widely lauded as well written, well crafted, and comprehensive. It received a \\"hearty recommendation\\" in a Linux Journal review. OSNews describes it as \\"one of the best tech books ever published\\" in a review of the second edition.

It is possible that Traditionalist views were if not reinforced then implanted in the young Fal during his education. At the turn of the centuries the Jesuits were clearly sympathizing with Ram√≥n Nocedal and his Integrist vision of religion and Traditionalism; it is likely that his Villafranca years affected Fal accordingly. He admitted juvenile fascination with address delivered to the college audience by Manuel Senante, at that time one of key Integrist politicians.Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 20; another author claims that Fal \\"knew and admired\\" Senante during his Villafranca days, Ugarte Teller√≠a 2018, p. 493 Militant Catholicism of Manuel Sanchez de Castro is likely to have contributed further on, forming the young Fal as an energetic Catholic activist, possibly along the intransigent and ultra-reactionary Integrist lines.compare his vision of Spain‚Äôs raison d‚Äôetre: \\"Patria espa√±ola es una realidad historica, cuya unidad indestructibile fur forjada, no tanto por la comunidad de territorio, raza, o de lengua, sino ante todo y esencialmente por la unidad de Fe cat√≥lica y el destino com√∫n de los diversos pueblos que concurren a formarla\\", quoted after Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 5 Fal commenced his public assignments already during the academic years in Seville; he joined Asociaci√≥n Escolar Sevillana and soon grew to be its president;no later than in 1914, Ugarte Teller√≠a 2018, p. 494 the organization remained a fairly typical student grouping, though politically it tended towards \\"catolicismo pol√≠tico y social\\", flavored by Traditionalism in general and by pro-German World War I stand in particular.Jos√© Calvo Gonzalez, Restauraci√≥n tomista y catolicismo militante en la Universidad de Sevilla (1884-1924), [in:] Anuario de filosofia del derecho 6 (1989), p. 387 Following his return from Madrid he started contributing to local Catholic periodicals.Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 21 In the 1920s he excelled, however, in various Catholic organizations, ranging from educational associations to charity groupings to trade unions to penitentiary circles, like Congregaci√≥n de los Luises, Conferencias de San Vicente de Paulo, various Hermandades de Penitencia, the Jesuit-sponsored Patronato para Obreros, the Franciscan- sponsored Compa√±a de las Hermanas de la Cruz and a number of others.Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, pp. 21, 23 He also launched some initiatives himself, like the 1924-inaugurated Romer√≠a de la Pe√±a de la Reina de los Angeles.Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, pp. 22-23 Exposure to a variety of structures provided Fal with experience and confirmed his enormous capacity as organizer. Semana Santa, Seville, 1928 It is not clear whether during late Restoration or during the Primo de Rivera dictatorship Fal was active in the Integrist ranks.

By the end of his life he straightforwardly referred to Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista as \\"obra de Dios\\" and perceived its mission as political evangelization, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, pp. 150-1. Though devout faithful, he nevertheless resisted advances of Catholic visionaries like Jos√© Lles Segarra, Moral Roncal 2009, p. 210 was first recorded as engaged in a political enterprise in the spring of 1930. He was among members of Junta Organizadora of Partido Tradicionalista-Integrista, a new post-dictatorial incarnation of Integrism,El Siglo Futuro 11.04.30, available here and emerged as leader of the Seville branch of the party.El Siglo Futuro 20.10.30, available here; some sources claim that the group was in fact a joint Integrist and Jaimist initiative, preconfiguration of later unification of all Traditionalist branches; according to this account both the Integrist leader Juan Olazabal and the Jaimist one marqu√©s de Villores nominated Fal Jefe Regional of Western Andalusia of their respective organizations, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 24 In late 1930 he was also busy co- organizing local branches of Juventud Integrista.El Siglo Futuro 13.10.30, available here Fal witnessed emergence of militantly secular Republic with horror;compare Antonio Manuel Moral Roncal, 1868 en la memoria carlista de 1931: dos revoluciones anticlericales y un paralelo, [in:] Hispania Sacra 59/119 (2007), pp. 337-361 he personally led local Juventud organization trying to protect the Seville churches against violence which erupted in May 1931.Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 25 In June 1931 he ran for Cortes from Cadiz;some claim that he competed as member of the Right-wing coalition, see Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 25; other sources claim that he presented his bid as Independent Right candidate, Martin Blinkhorn, Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939, Cambridge 2008, , p. 54 the bid proved unsuccessful. According to a homage publication Fal gained enough votes to be voted in, but it was behind- the-stage manipulations which relegated him to non-electable position; embittered, he has never run for the Cortes again.Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 25. According to the authors, impartial scrutiny would have given Fal 15,000 votes. According to official results, the last elected candidate in the Cad√≠z district gathered 34,000 votes, compare the official Cortes service, available here Instead, he focused on a newly acquired daily, El Observador, re-launched as an ultraconservative Catholic title in Seville,more details in Alfonso Braojos Garrido, Tradicionalismo y antimasoner√≠a en la Sevilla de la II Rep√∫blica.

Fal remained enthusiastic about co-operation with Sanjurjo;Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 28-9 Andalusia was where the coup was most welcomed by local Carlists.some of them killed in the fighting which ensued, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 91 In the aftermath Fal was arrested for 3 months,longer incarceration was experienced only by 2 leaders of Andalusian requet√©, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 92, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 29 which did not discourage him from sounding other military on leading a potential Carlist rising.like Varela, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 97; the two met in prison, Canal 2000, p. 300 Also his El Observador kept making references to violence.Fal noted that the Catholic citizenry must defend society \\"even with its blood\\" against unjust and usurping power, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 104; in July 1933 he stated bluntly that \\"power is violence\\" and called to organize resistance adequate to the violence experienced, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 103 Two other specific features of Andalusian Carlism were impact on Catholic youthFal proved to be very skilful when organising Semana Santa in Seville in 1932; as a lawyer he did his utmost to defy the constitutional ban on all public displays or religiosity, Moral Roncal 2009, p. 64; he turned out to be staunch defender of Segura and enemy of Herrera Oria and Tedeschini, accused of appeasement and cowardice, Moral Roncal 2009, p. especially the chapter \\"Contra el imperio de los personalismos\\": cr√≠ticas carlistas contra Tedeschini, Herrera Oria y Vidal, pp. 165-176.

In many Andalusian districts Carlism emerged as an exclusively youth movement, which in the spring of 1933 pushed Fal to create a federation of local Juventud circles.Blinkhorn 2008, p. 116, Moral Roncal 2009, p. 85 Acute social problems in turn induced Fal to set up fairly successful Workers Section in early 1933.named Agrupaci√≥n Gremial Tradicionalista, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 30, also Blinkhorn 2008, p. 117, Moral Roncal 2009, p. 85 Quintillo,1934 Fal gained nationwide attention following the Zumarraga act;in June 1933 the Carlists organized nationwide celebrations to the memory of Zumalacarregui, staged in a Gipuzkoan town of Zumarraga. Attendants, mostly from the North of Spain, were amazed by arrival of a cavalcade of buses carrying a massive Andalusian contingent, headed by Fal, Eduardo Gonzales Calleja, Contrarrevolucionarios, Madrid 2011, , p. 194 in recognition of his excellent organization skills in November 1933 Alfonso Carlos nominated Fal Jefe Regional for all Andalusia,Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 32; for Fal as Carlist regional leader see Antonio Manuel Moral Roncal, Manuel Fal Conde y el carlismo andaluz, [in:] Jos√© Leonardo Ruiz S√°nchez (ed.), La confrontaci√≥n cat√≥lico-laicista en Andaluc√≠a durante la crisis de entreguerras, Sevilla 2012, , pp. 169-188 but the most impressive coup was yet to come: in April 1934 regional Carlism organized a massive gathering at Quintillo estate near Seville. This demonstration of local prowess climaxed in parade of 650 uniformed and trained Requet√©s, which made a stunning impact on guests from other regions.Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, pp. 32-33; there were even two small aircraft taking part, Ugarte 2018, p 506 When national leadership of Conde Rodezno was called into question due to rapprochement with the Alfonsists and his gradualist strategy,Blinkhorn 2008, p. 137, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 33 Fal became one of top contenders for the job.his candidature launched by Lamamie, Contreras and Senante Alfonso Carlos, himself sympathetic to Integrism and personally familiar with Fal since late Restoration, seemed well-disposed. In May 1934, despite his relatively young agepeople assuming Carlist political leadership were usually far more advanced in age: Nocedal was 58 (in 1879), Cerralbo 45 (1890), Barrio 55 (1899), Feliu 66 (1909), Sanz Escartin 74 (1918), Com√≠n 61 (1919) and Rodezno 50 (1932), though there were exceptions: Larramendi and Villores were only 38 (respectively in 1919 and in 1921) and unenthusiastic welcome from Carlist stronghold, Navarre, Fal was nominated Secretary General of the Communi√≥n.Blinkhorn 2008, p. 138. Canal 2000, pp. 312-3, gives two reasons for Fal‚Äôs elevation: his relatively young age and successes in Andalusia El Siglo Futuro hailed him as \\"Sevillian Zumalacarregui\\"Blinkhorn 2008, p. 138, Canal 2000, p. 314 and Carlist youth welcomed him as the man who \\"brought Montejurra to Andalusia\\".Blinkhorn 2008, p. 140; favourably disposed contemporaries claimed that he turned the city from \\"Sevilla la Roja\\" to \\"Sevilla de las Boinas Rojas\\", Moral Roncal 2009, p. 85 An apologetic biography followed.Villar√≠n y Willy [Guilermo Poole, Joaqu√≠n Valdes], El Secretario de S.M., Sevilla 1935.

No other party possessed a comparable \\"shirt organization\\", with Falangist, Anarchist, Socialist or Communist militias formatted chiefly as urban hit-squads specialising in limited street violence like sabotage, arson or assassination provided critical mass and enhanced homogeneity,Canal 2000, p. 314 though also enforced discipline and laid command of all structures in hands of Fal and his entourage, removing dependence on local juntas and especially on the Vasco-Navarros.Blinkhorn 2008, p. 220 The latter complained about \\"fascistization\\" of the Comuni√≥n,Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 220-222 especially that Fal's trusted collaborators were appointed to key positions.others were offered prestigious but not really influential roles; that was the case of conde Rodezno, former political leader. He was not given jefatura of any of the newly created sections, but was offered a seat in the Council of Culture instead, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 208 Nevertheless, remodeled Comuni√≥n was fully able to bear the weight of rapidly expanding ranks; instead of inefficient isolated circulos where zeal of new converts was evaporating, new structures channeled and reinforced enthusiasm.for numerical overview of Carlist structures in 1936 see Vallverd√∫ 2008, pp. 248‚Äì260 Organization question aside, the change started even to affect the way of life.apart from reading Carlist newspapers and frequenting Carlist libraries, Carlists were asked to buy Carlist products, spend vacations in Carlist hotels and even play football in Carlist football league, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 211; Fal co-founded Asociaci√≥n Deportiva Tradicionalista, Moral Roncal 2009, p. 121 Comuni√≥n began to expand into unlikely areas both geographically and socially; structures were emerging in such regions as Extremadura or the Canaries, while following the example of Western Andalusia, representatives of urban proletariat started to appear in local bodies also elsewhere.structures of the Comuni√≥n were incomparably more heterogeneous socially than those of Renovaci√≥n, filled often with local aristocrats; some scholars call them, applying their own social cliches and preferences, \\"more democratic\\", see Blinkhorn 2008, p. 213 Unlike the Northerners who conceived Traditionalism as rooted in family and regional values,Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 153-4 Fal was focused on structures. As alliances were likely to get them dominated by other groupings, victorious campaign ‚Äì maybe unfeasible as exclusively Carlist affair - should be launched and controlled by Carlists.a British scholar writing in the 1970s, perfectly familiar with history of Carlist marginalization within Francoist structures, nevertheless hails Rodezno‚Äôs strategy as \\"pragmatic\\" and lambasts Fal‚Äôs vision as \\"sheer wishful thinking\\", Blinkhorn 2008, p. 154 In line with this vision, under Fal Carlism steered clear of alliances,Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 135-6 its strategy dubbed \\"isolationism\\" or \\"exclusiveness\\".Blinkhorn 2008, p. 229 Though he felt compelled to join Renovaci√≥n Espa√±ola in National Bloc (the Spanish Right-wing political alliance of the 1930s) late 1934, he made sure the access was as non-committal as possible.Vallverd√∫ 2008, pp. 188-194, Moral Roncal 2009, p. 127-134 In 1935 he grew increasingly skepticalCanal 2008, p. 318 and later that year let Rodezno mix with the Alfonsinos on the private business basisBlinkhorn 2008, p. 215 before definitely abandoning the alliance in the spring of 1936.Canal 2000, p. 318 From the onset highly suspicious about CEDAalready in 1933 Fal expressed a view, later growing to a dogma, that members of different parties better stick to their own organizations, Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 203-4, Witnessing the emergence of CEDA he was skeptical, not only because of its accidentalism and infection of liberalism, but also as it was born out of the ungodly Republican regime, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 102. In late 1933, when CEDA opted for a coalition with Lerroux, Fal, recently promoted to Delegate for all Andalusia, concluded that Gil Robles had cut himself off from his former allies and that was no way to defend religion in Spain, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 125. In early 1934 El Observador was waging a regular anti-CEDA campaign, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 130 he was more than happy to see it decompose in 1935-6.Blinkhorn 2008, p. 229 Carlist standard Another shift in Carlist strategy under Fal was de-emphasizing of politics and focusing on organizational buildup, with special attention paid to paramilitary. His vision was already set on violent overthrow of the Republic; starting 1935 openly belligerent language became increasingly common at Carlist rallies, with references to sacrifice, blood, arms, violence and power.Blinkhorn 2008, p. 219 Permitting taking part in 1936 elections, Fal did not pay much attention to the campaign.Alfonso Carlos addressed Fal in a letter, suggesting that he fields his candidature as well; Fal refused, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 34 Though Rodeznistas viewed him as an uninspiring, colorless, mediocre bureaucrat,especially compared to charismatic figures of other Right-wing leaders like Calvo Sotelo or Jos√© Antonio, or even compared to eloquent and gregarious Rodezno; Blinkhorn 2008, p. 215. The so-called cruzadistas accused Fal and his \\"Integrist camarilla\\" of taking part in conspiracy, aiming at transferring dynastic rights to the Alfonsinos, though scholars dismiss this charges as idiosyncratic. In fact, Fal was also anxious about looming problem of succession, but preferred not to press Alfonso Carlos and wait for him to make a decision, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 216 Fal gained recognition bordering devotion among Requet√© and the youth.Blinkhorn 2008, p. 215 Also Alfonso Carlos seemed perfectly satisfied;Fal accepted Alfonso Carlos‚Äô decision to set up a regency with no objections. Though many considered Don Javier ‚Äì a hardly known foreigner ‚Äì a laughable figure as a prospective claimant, and preferred fusionist talks with the Alfonsinos instead, it was not the case of Fal, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 230 in December 1935 he raised Fal from Secretary General to Jefe Delegado.Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 34 Insurgency and unification Alfonso Carlos and Don Javier, April 1936 Convinced that in the battle against democracy Carlists must strike first,especially after the Popular Front victory in February 1936 elections, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 206 Fal threw himself into wartime preparations;spending more time in San-Jean-de-Luz with Don Javier than in Spain, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 237, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 35. Some sources claim he was exiled in France, Mercedes Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o, Entre la boina roja y la camisa azul, Estella 2013, , p. 16, Stanley G. Payne, Falange: a History of Spanish Fascism, vol. 22, Stanford 1961, , pp. 109-110, also Jacek Bartyzel, Manuel (Jos√©) Fal Conde, [in:] legitymizm.org service, available here. He headed the Junta Suprema Militar, consisting of general Muslera, teniente coronel Baselga, teniente coronel Rada, capitan Sanjurjo (son of the exiled general) and local military inspectors, Juan Carlos Pe√±as Bernaldo de Quir√≥s, El Carlismo, la Rep√∫blica y la Guerra Civil (1936-1937). De la conspiraci√≥n a la unificaci√≥n, Madrid 1996, , pp. 18-21 his initial plan was abandoned in April 1936.it envisioned two focos of Requet√© insurgency in Western Spain as means to lure governmental troops, while Madrid conspirators disguised as Guardia Civil were to take control of key offices and Requet√© arriving from the North would guarantee success as reinforcements. The plan was abandoned when security discovered false Guardia Civil uniforms. It was based on assumption that the army would remain passive; though talks were held with Sanjurjo, no accord was struck; Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 240-2, Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, p. 23 He envisaged a purely Carlist insurrectionBlinkhorn 2008, p. 238 with conditional assistance of the army.which might be helpful if not vital, given the military do not push conditions compromising Carlist principles, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 226 Fal placed his bets on Sanjurjo, who agreed to lead the rising.either staged as exclusively Carlist enterprise or as a joint Carlist-military project; transitional government would be a stopgap solution leading to establishment of a Traditionalist monarchy, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 243. Sanjurjo and Fal met as early as in March 1936 in Lisbon, Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, p. 22 Talks with Mola proved unsuccessful. The generalmost of the conspiring generals viewed insurgency as means to change the government, prevent revolution and ensure order, not as means to re-establish the monarchy, let alone a Traditionalist one, C√©sar Alcal√°, D. Mauricio de Sivatte. Una biograf√≠a pol√≠tica (1901-1980), Barcelona 2001, , p. 29 refused to accept Fal's conditions,during the talks Fal remained entirely intransigent, which drove Mola to desperation. He later admitted having been close to shooting himself, \\"este hombre [Fal] estuvo a punto de conseguir que yo me pegara un tiro\\", Maximiliano Garcia Venero, Historia de la unificacion, Madrid 1970, p. 76 which aimed at toppling the Republic and installing Traditionalist monarchy.he demanded derogation of Republican legislature, dissolution of all parties (including the supportive ones), provisional dictatorship with temporary directorate heavily controlled by the Carlists, future corporatist state, and usage of monarchist standard; detailed review of the talks in Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, pp. 31-35, Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o 2013, pp. 18-21, Ar√≥stegui 2013, pp. 93-128, Gonzales Calleja 2011, pp. 370-388 However, Mola opened parallel negotiations with the Navarrese. Led by Rodezno, the latter bypassed Fal and were keen to commit local Requet√© to a joint insurgency with almost no strings attached.most detailed account in Tom√°s Echeverr√≠a, C√≥mo se prepar√≥ el alzamiento: el general Mola y los carlistas, Madrid 1985, ; see also Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 246-8, Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, pp. 35-37. Key Falcondistas are listed as follows: Jos√© Luis Zamanillo, Jos√© Zuazola, Jos√© Martinez Beras√°in (sic!), Juan Mar√≠a Roma, Pedro Roma, Mauricio Sivatte, Juan Lavaquial, Jos√© Br√∫, Luis Zuazola and Agust√≠n Teller√≠a. Key Rodeznistas listed are: conde Rodezno, Victor Pradera, Fernando Contreras, Jos√© Mar√≠a Oriol, Juan Olaz√°bal, Domingo Tejera, Javier Mart√≠nez de Morentin, Luis Arellano, Marcelino Ulibarri, Gait√°n de Ayal√°, Jos√© Mar√≠a Valiente (sic!) and Jos√© Mar√≠a Arauz de Robles, Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o 2013, p. 18. Some authors add also the Baleztena brothers, though others indicate that their position was highly ambiguous, see Manuel Martorell P√©rez, La continuidad ideol√≥gica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil [PhD thesis in Historia Contemporanea, Universidad Nacional de Educaci√≥n a Distancia], Valencia 2009, p. 121 Though at that point Fal considered dismissing the entire Navarrese junta,Blinkhorn 2008, p. 249 he decided not to risk open confrontation; Rodezno and his entourage outmaneuvered him and elicited hesitant approval from the royal envoy, Don Javier.Don Javier later referred to the stance adopted by the Navarros as \\"una traic√≠on a nuestros principios y a nuestras gentes, cuya sangre habemos sacrificado inutimente\\", Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, pp. 39-40. There was no formal pact between the military and the Carlists; Mola and Fal agreed to act on basis of the letter, sent by Sanjurjo on July 11. Its contents allow usage of monarchist standard provided army units related use none, apolitical government with civilians, abolishing of all political parties (including these supporting the coup), dismantling Republican regime and introducing a new state. There was no explicit committal to monarchy, let alone Traditionalist one, and no guarantee of Carlist role in either military command or provisional government. Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 247-250 Upon the outbreak of hostilitieson July 19 he was flown from Sant-Jean-de-Luz to Pamplona, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 121, where he spent a day. During the night he travelled by car to Burgos, Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, p. 215, others say he stayed in Pamplona until July 25, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 121 Fal headed the new Carlist wartime executive, Junta Nacional Carlista de Guerra,full squad in Ricardo Ollaquindia, La Oficina de Prensa y Propaganda Carlista de Pamplona al comienzo de la guerra de 1936, [in:] Pr√≠ncipe de Viana 56 (1995), p. 486. See also Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, p. 218, Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o 2013, p. 28. Fal divided his time between office work, talking to foreign correspondents (compare Fal Conde y el requete juzgados por el extranjero Cronicas de prensa, a book published in Burgos in 1937, and Antonio C√©sar Moreno Cantano, El carlismo y la propaganda exterior durante la Guerra Civil espa√±ola [unpublished paper delivered to Congreso La Guerra Civil Espa√±ola 1936 - 1939, 2006]) and especially visiting Carlist troops on the front-lines, Larraz, Sierra-Sesumaga 2011, p. 212, Ar√≥stegui 2013, pp. 357, 436, 713, 729 and had to acknowledge that instead of being equal partner, Carlism was getting reduced to a junior role.as late as in September Fal saw the rising as an alliance of equals between the military and the Carlists; he found room for the Falange only as a junior partner, whose assistance was somewhat condescendingly welcomed, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 265. Though he accepted a compromise with military authoritarianism and eventually admitted its leading role, Fal made no secret that Traditionalist monarchy should be reinstated immediately following victory; even Don Javier was less explicit and tending to accept some sort of longer transition period of military dictatorship, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 267 His position was already precarious. Death of Sanjurjo deprived him of a key ally among the generals.Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, p. 214 Death of Alfonso Carlos left the movement with no king and made dissent easier.Alfonso Carlos‚Äô successor as a regent, Don Javier, confirmed Fal as Jefe Delegado, Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o 2013, p. 21. The likes of Rodezno claimed that the regent had merely to be \\"consulted\\", not necessarily obeyed, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 40 The Navarrese set up their own Junta Central Carlista de Guerra de Navarra, which emerged as a competitive, though theoretically only regional body, and kept bypassing Fal;Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 42-3, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 269, Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, pp. 47-49; the latter distinguished between \\"carlismo nacional\\" (maximalist, orthodox and intransigent), and \\"carlismo regional\\" (possibilist and flexible), Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, pp. 214, 219-221 Carlist executive was decomposing.geographical dispersion of Carlist executive added to overall confusion; Fal resided in Toledo, some agendas of Junta Nacional in Burgos and some in Salamanca; the king was in Vienna, his envoy Don Javier in Sant-Jean- de-Luz, while the Navarrese Junta Central resided in Pamplona, Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, p. 238 As Requet√© units, the key Carlist argument, unconditionally left at generals‚Äô disposal were dispersed among various fronts,the strongest contingent, provided by the Navarrese, was divided between 4 areas: some units were engaged on the Basque front, some in the East against the Anarchists in Aragon, and some on the central front in Sierra de Guadarrama. Isolated units were active also in Andalusia, Extremadura and Castile. In all cases, Carlist units, a battalion the largest one, were attached to army divisions commanded by career generals. Most thorough military analysis in Ar√≥stegui 2013, political impact in Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, p. 204 Carlism ‚Äì in line with Fal's worst nightmares ‚Äì was indeed getting dominated by its alliance partners.Blinkhorn 2008, p. 270 During the outbreak of the Nationalist uprising in Navarre, a mass killing was conducted by the insurgents against all civilian dissidence in the Navarre rearguard, taking a death toll of circa 3,000. Fal's attitude towards the Republicans is subject to conflicting accounts. Some maintain that he was the instigator of bloody repressions, also directed against the clergy with Basque nationalist sympathies,in mid- September 1936 Fal addressed general Cabanillas, head of the Burgos Junta, protesting the \\"mild\\" nature of military repression in Gipuzkoa, especially this related to clergy with Basque nationalist inclinations; he alleged that the army commanders feared of \\"tropezar con la Iglesia\\", Paul Preston, The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain, London 2013, , p. 141. In his letter to cardinal Segura of early September Fal lamented limited repressive means administered in Gipuzkoa, \\"mientras los del sur se exceden. En Badajoz capital dicen que llegan a 5.000 los fusilados, mientras que en Tolosa solo van 17\\", quoted after Santiado Mart√≠nez Sanchez, Los papeles perdidos del cardenal Segura, 1880-1957, Pamplona 2004, p. 381. In letters to Segura and the Carlist war commissioner Luis Barrio, Fal recommended exemplary punishment of priests supporting the nationalists and suggested they are court-martialed, writing that \\"todos aquellos [of the priests] que est√©n incursos en el bando militar deben ser fusilados pero por consejo de guerra\\", quoted after Padro Barruso Bar√©s, La represi√≥n en las zonas republicana y franquista del Pa√≠s Vasco durante la Guerra Civil, [in:] Historia Contempor√°nea 35 (2007), p. 672. Some scholars stress that the only difference between Fal and the Falangists was that the Carlist leader wanted to see the pro-Basque priests killed after trial, while the latter did not consider the fiction of legal proceedings necessary, Mikel Aizpuru (ed.), El oto√±o de 1936 en Guip√∫zcoa. Los fusilamientos de Hernani, Irun 2007, , pp. 226-227. Detailed discussion in Pedro Barruso Bar√©s, La represi√≥n del clero diocesano guipuzcoano durante la Guerra Civil, [in:] Congreso La Guerra Civil Espa√±ola 1936 - 1939, Madrid 2006, for Fal see pp. 3-5 while others claim exactly the opposite, namely that he did his best to prevent executions.they note that Fal demanded all court-martialing cases be consulted with ecclesiastical authorities and prohibited impromptu executions, suggesting also that Requet√©s steer clear of the process, leaving it to the military.. They also claim that according to some accounts Fal did his best to prevent executions (\\"y nosotros fuimos los que despu√©s de otros, como Fal Conde, hicimos cuanto estuvo en nuestra mano para impedirlo [executions of priests]\\"), that he must have approved of an order issued by regional Carlist Navarrese jefe, banning improvised executions and published in El Pensamiento Navarro on July 24, that he tried to make sure Requet√© were not engaged in repression and that he saved some nationalist-minded priests personally, compare Martorell P√©rez 2009, pp. 100-101, 118, 121, 138, 165, 220-221. According to some sources, one of the conditions put forward by Fal when negotiating Carlists joining the coup with Mola was that Requet√© would not be used for policing, Luis Redondo, Juan de Zavala, El requet√©, Barcelona 1957, pp. 355, 359; this claim is supposedly backed by documents quoted in Melchor Ferrer, Historia del Tradicionalismo Espa√±ol, vol. XXX, Sevilla 1979, docs nr 58 and 60, also Fernando Miguel Noriega, Fal Conde y el Requet√© juzgados por el extranjero, Sevilla 1976, p. 32. The conclusion advanced by this group of scholars is that \\"todos estos hechos ponen, al menos, en duda una afirmaci√≥n tan tajante como que Manuel Fal Conde fue el principal \\"impulsor\\" de las ejecuciones de los sacerdotes nacionalistas en Guip√∫zcoa\\", Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 101 Discussion related to the Carlist - and, due to his political leadership, also Fal's personal responsibility for nationalist atrocities committed in the rearguard is not conclusive.there are many works focusing on Carlism during the Civil War, but there is no scholarly monograph dedicated to Requet√© and repression in the rear. Historians sympathetic to the Carlist cause tend to ignore or downplay the issue, which is almost absent in two large volumes of Pablo Larraz And√≠a, V√≠ctor Sierra-Ses√∫maga Ariznabarreta, Requet√©s: de las trincheras al olvido, Madrid 2011, , and Julio Ar√≥stegui, Combatientes Requet√©s en la Guerra Civil espa√±ola, 1936-1939, Madrid 2013, . Authors sympathetic to the Republican cause, especially when dealing with repression in Navarre and the Basque Country, reserve a prominent role for the Carlists, see Jos√© Ram√≥n Urtasun, Carlos Mart√≠nez, I√±aki Arzoz, No os olvidaremos, Pamplona 2013, , Jos√© Mari Ruiz Vilas, Juan Carlos Berrio Zaratiegui, Jos√© Mari Esparza Zabalegi, Navarra 1936: de la esperanza al terror, Estella 2004, , I√±aki Ega√±a, Los crimenes de Franco en Euskal Herria, Tafalla 2009, . Many works (especially the foreign ones) refer jointly to \\"Nationalist\\" or \\"fascist\\" repressions. Among these, the prevailing understanding is that Nationalist atrocities were unprovoked, systematic, pre- planned, committed by official structures and formed the very core of the regime, while Republican atrocities were spontaneous, circumstantial, committed by \\"uncontrollables\\" and offshoot criminals, provoked by the Nationalists and formed a pathological margin of the regime; excellent sample in Antony Beevor, The Battle for Spain, London 2006, . Recent work aspiring to historiographic summary of literature on civil war violence intends rather to \\"grapple with Francoist past\\" and its authors \\"do not aspire to treat each side equally\\", see Peter Anderson, Miguel √Ångel del Arco Blanco, Mass Killings and Violence in Spain, 1936-1952: Grappling with the Past, New York 2014, , p. 33 To enhance Carlist position versus the military Fal launched two new projects in November. The first one was Obra Nacional Corporativa, general labor organization,which opened its structures in all Nationalist-held provinces. Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 274-5 another one was Military Academy,initially to be named Real Academia de Estudios Militares de la Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista, it was established as Real Academia Militar de Requet√©s; it was most likely to be headed by an Andalusian and Fal‚Äôs close friend, the Seville requet√© commander Enrique Barrau. Location is unclear; some point to Navarre (Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, p. 232-7) and some to Toledo (Ar√≥stegui 2013, p. 139) intended to train Carlist command cadres.Canal 2000, pp. 336-7 Uncomfortable with Fal's independent stance,historians do not agree whether the project was pre-agreed with the military; some authors claim it was either approved or consulted by Mola, some point to Franco-Salgado and others even to Franco himself, for overview see Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o 2013, p. 31 Franco summoned him to Burgos in early December and presented with the choice between exile and firing squad.Franco did not speak to Fal personally; the Carlist leader was received by Davila, Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, pp. 239-241; detailed account in Maximiliano Garcia Venero, Historia de la Unificacion, Madrid 1970, p. 79 Rodezno-dominated Junta Nacional advocated compliancePe√±as Bernaldo 1996, pp. 241-2, Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o 2013, pp. 30-35, most detailed discussion in Jaime del Burgo Torres, Un episodio poco conocido de la guerra civil espa√±ola. La Real Academia Militar de Requet√©s y el destierro de Fal Conde, [in:] Principe de Viana 196 (1992), pp. 481-506 and Fal left Spain for Lisbon,Blinkhorn 2008, p. 276-7, Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o 2013, p. 34; according to his son, Fal complied fearing grave crisis in Nationalist ranks, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 53 remaining official though increasingly theoretical Carlist leader.though he resigned as leader of Junta Nacional, Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, p. 242; real power slipped mostly towards the Navarrese. The Carlist propaganda kept venerating Fal and ignored Franco as much as possible; in Carlist press the official slogan \\"Una Patria, Un Estado, Un Caudillo\\" was often juxtaposed with a photograph of Fal; references to Franco were few and tucked away on inside pages, while those to Fal were emphasized in front, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 279, detailed discussion of Carlist press resisting unification pressure, including hailing of Fal, in Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, pp. 115-122, also Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 52 Francisco Franco Faced with unification pressure Fal did not dismiss such a perspective, but talking to fellow Traditionalists in Insua he insisted it should be completed on Carlist terms,in February; most detailed discussion in Julio V. Brioso y Mayral, Fal Conde y la asamblea de Insua [in:] Aportes 27 (1995), pp. 3-39, also Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, p. 247, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 43, Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o 2013, p. 37-41, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 30-32; Josep Carles Clemente, Los d√≠as fugaces. El carlismo, de las guerras civiles a la transici√≥n, Cuenca 2013, , pp. 45-51 reiterating this position also during February talks with Falangists.following talks with Falange envoys D√°vila, Gamero and Escario in Lisbon, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 283, Garcia Venero 1970, pp. 82-3. In early February he replied in writing with his Essential Points for the Union. The document pointed out that only equitable and complementary fusion is acceptable, with a triumvirate heading the party until the war is won and with traditionalist monarchy declared afterwards, Don Javier accepted as the regent. A future corporative state would comprise national labor syndicates and all vestiges of liberal party system would be abolished, Payne 1961, p. 155. As the Falangists replied with counter-proposal which amounted to Carlist absorption into their party, Fal confirmed his position; the new document envisioned a unified party as a temporary measure to be dissolved following victory. Though during subsequent conversations of late February even a regency under Franco was discussed, both sides reached no agreement, Payne 1961, pp. 155-156 At meetings in Burgos (March) and Pamplona (April), unattended by Fal, the balance tilted towards Rodeznistas, ready to accept Franco's terms of amalgamation.the Falcondistas were represented only by Zamanillo and Valiente. Blinkhorn 2008, p. 287, Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, pp. 255-275, Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o 2013, pp. 40-43, Martorell P√©rez 2009, pp. 33-38 They presented Don Javier with an ultimatum and ensured that he at least did not object.Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 288-9, Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, pp. 276 Following Unification Decree Fal was passed over as leader of a technically non-existent movement.Blinkhorn 2008, p. 291, Ferm√≠n P√©rez-Nievas Borderas, Contra viento y marea, Estella 1999, , p. 122 Initially he did not protestwhat was heard from Fal was only \\"defeaning silence\\" according to Blinkhorn 2008, p. 290. Other authors claim that Fal protested, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 44; yet another scholar maintains that Fal and Don Javier issued two letters (to Carlists and to Requet√©s respectively) recommending \\"obedecer y callar\\" posture and refraining from opposition; Fal actually suggested to accept posts in FET given it is made clear they are accepted on orders of the Comuni√≥n, Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o 2013, pp. 54-6 and even advised to comply.Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o 2013, p. 50; the advice did not extend to the Falangist Consejo Nacional; Fal repeatedly warned the Carlists offered seats in this body that they must not accept Despite olive branch offered by FrancoFranco invited Fal to Salamanca and the two held talks on August 11, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 46, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 50; according to Fal the dictator was cordial and effusive; he awaited the guest half-way through the room, extended his arms and exclaimed: \\"¬°Bienvenido, qu√© alegr√≠a! ¬°Ya est√° usted entre nosotros, bienvenido! Qu√© alegr√≠a!\\", quoted after Robert Vallverd√∫ Mart√≠, La metamorfosi del carlisme catal√†: del \\"D√©u, P√†tria i Rei\\" a l'Assamblea de Catalunya (1936-1975), Montserrt 2014, , p. 63 ‚Äì including a ministerial jobaccording to some sources it was ministry of interior, see Ricardo Mart√≠nez de Salazar y Bascu√±ana, Manuel J.

Others claim Fal was not permitted to return until the end of the war, Stanley G. Payne, The Franco Regime, Madison 1987, , p. 189 He eventually abandoned quiet in favor of direct counter- action, suggesting to Don Javier that all those accepting seats in the FET executive be expelled; the regent acted on his advice.Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, p. 297; detailed discussion in Joaquin Cubero Sanchez, El carlismo en la guerra de Espana.

Some concluded that \\"hemos perdido la guerra. Preparemos la pr√≥xima\\", given the next war was to be \\"contra los azules\\", quoted after Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 54-57. Apart from newspaper frontpages featuring glorification of a \\"caudillo\\" with the photo of Fal placed next, there were even songs coined: \\"Es Fal nuestro jefe / es el hombre que m√°s vale / y a sus requet√©s / no se los merienda nadie\\", Emilio Herrera Alonso, Los mil dias del Tercio Navarra;: Biografia de un tercio de requetes, Pamplona 1974, , pp. 63-64. Fal‚Äôs home turf, Seville, was the province where most protests against Falangist domination in the new state party were recorded; Cad√≠z came third, Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o 2013, p. 96-7 In March 1939 Fal addressed Franco with a memorandum, titled Manifestaci√≥n de ideales.Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 371-2 Written with all due respect, the document claimed that the emerging regime was not sustainable and argued in favor of traditionalist monarchy; as transitory means it suggested a regency, either this of Don Javier or a collective one, alluding to Franco as its member.MacClancy 2000, p. 79, full text available in Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, pp. 90-96 Though sounding more like an offer, the document, together with other texts disseminated around that time,it has to be considered jointly with 3 other documents, El criterio tradicionalista sobre el Partido Pol√≠tico, (rejection of partido √∫nico and state omnipresence), Bosquejo de la futura organizaci√≥n pol√≠tica espa√±ola (confirmation of corporative and regionalist outlook) and Sucesi√≥n din√°stica en la Monarqu√≠a Espa√±ola, (defense of monarchical model represented by Javier de Borb√≥n Parma). Franco did not respond, but the documents in question were widely circulated and served as point of reference. Some add also Fijaci√≥n de Orientaciones (1940) as another important leaflet, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 186. It was stated that \\"los poderes del General√≠simo son circunstanciales\\" and that \\"nadie pudo pensar seriamente que un hombre es eterno y que en √©l pueden fundarse las instituciones del Estado\\". \\"Su misi√≥n ‚Äì the text went - acabada la guerra, nunca pudo ser otra que la de poner en marcha las instituciones del Estado, quedando √©l como pieza de la m√°quina, si cab√≠a, o cesando\\" para permanecer vigilante en la \\"reserva\\", quoted after Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 194 is viewed by some scholars as a milestone marking total breakup with the regime and adoption of a decisive opposition strategy.Martorell P√©rez 2009, pp. 171-172 Caudillo did not respond. He reacted, however, to mayhem which erupted in Pamplona following Fal's appearance on the ayunatamiento balcony during re- burial of Sanjurjo on October 21, 1939:Fal was among the officials invited; during the gathering in front of the ayuntamiento building the crowd largely ignored Francoist dignitaries speaking from the balcony and demanded to see Fal. When appearing, he cried ¬°Viva Cristo Rey! and ¬°Viva el Rey!, triggering enthusiasm which bordered mayhem; riots ensued. Those trying to cry ¬°Viva Franco! were assaulted, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 178 Fal was ordered house arrest in Seville.with 2 uniformed policemen in front of his house and undercover agents following him when permitted to leave by the civil governor, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, pp. 48-9, Clemente 2013, p. 32 Ferreries, Menorca, the Balearic Islands From his confinement Fal presided overunable to leave Seville, he managed the party business by proxies, e.g. a meeting of Carlist executive in Madrid in 1940 was presided on his behalf by a veteran, Rafa√©l D√≠az Aguado Salaberry, Manuel de Santa Cruz, Apuntes y documentos para la historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol, vol. 2, Madrid 1940, p. 26 most vehement Carlist opposition,even his photo, when found by security during search of the suspects, was approached as incriminating evidence, Martorell P√©rez 2009, pp. 207-9 comparable only to hostility of the early 1970s.Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 193 No collaboration with the regime was acceptable.Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 186; in 1943 Fal tried to lure back those Carlists who had joined FET earlier and declared they might return to ranks of the Comuni√≥n, excluding however key rebels like Rodezno or Bilbao, Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o 2013, pp. 90, 143 The strategy was to ignore all officialdom and go public styling Traditionalist initiatives as religious or combatant activities,Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 194 though conspiracy hand in hand with the communists has been rejected.it was via Manuel Jim√©nez Fern√°ndez, former CEDA minister of agriculture and Sevillan abogado that PCE intended to lure Carlism into their Uni√≥n Nacional, an all-in anti-Francoist alliance mounted by the communists, Martorell P√©rez 2009, pp. 285-6 Corresponding with regional leaders,like Antonio Arrue in Gipuzkoa or Joaqu√≠n Baleztena in Navarre, though co-operation with the latter has always been marked by mutual lack of confidence, Villanueva Mart√≠nez 2003, pp. 104-105 in 1940-41 Fal went on reconstructing Comuni√≥n structures either in traditional shapein 1941 he asked Fausto Gaiztarro to create delegaciones provinciales and collect money, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 198 or in a new format;in 1940 he asked Arrue to create an inter-provincial Vasco-Navarrese Carlist executive and celebrate Fiesta de los M√°rtires independently of official gatherings wherever possible. His idea was to re-built Carlist structures from the bottom to the top, which was contrary to Baleztena‚Äôs idea of appointments, stemming from anxiety that police would raid larger gatherings, which indeed became common in Navarre, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 199 official party executive existed only in a makeshift mode.for 1942 scholars mention \\"Junta Auxiliar\\" (composed of Manuel Senante Mart√≠nez, Calixto Gonz√°lez Quevedo, Jos√© Luis Zamanillo, Jos√© Mar√≠a Ar√°uz de Robles, Jos√© Mar√≠a Lamami√© de Clairac, Rafael de Olaz√°bal, Jos√© Mar√≠a Valiente, Fausto Gaiztarro and Juan S√°enz D√≠ez), see Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 240, and for 1944 \\"Junta Suprema\\", Martorell P√©rez 2009, pp. 298-9 He launched veiled Carlist educational network of Academia Vazquez de Mella.from Fal's later correspondence with Gambra it seems that he entrusted organizing specialized studies to Elias de Tejada, though they formally emerged as religious initiative of Maximo Palomar del Val, Jacek Bartyzel, Nic bez Boga, nic wbrew tradycji. Kosmopolityczna wizja tradycjonalizmu karlistowskiego w Hiszpanii, Warszawa 2015, , p. 246 Fal banned Carlists from enlisting to Divisi√≥n AzulMar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 47, Canal 2000, p. 349 and advocated strictly neutral stand in European conflict, considering the British and German wars equally unjust;\\"bien sentado que la Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista no tiene juicio alguno a favor de ninguno de los contendientes en la guerra europea; que la C. T. no es german√≥fila ni angl√≥fila porque es exclusivamente espa√±ola (...) Podr√° cada carlista opinar lo que quiera e inclinar su juicio a favor de Alemania o de Inglaterra. Los dirigentes, en cambio, han de estar especialmente atentos a la obligaci√≥n de no comprometer a la Comuni√≥n en tal materia\\". Scholars of Catholic background when discussing Fal‚Äôs hostility towards Nazism point mostly to religious motivations, see Moral Roncal 2009, p. 217, Jacek Bartyzel, Tradycjonalizm (hiszpa≈Ñski) wobec faszyzmu, hitleryzmu i totalitaryzmu, [in:] Pro Fide Rege et Lege 71 (2013), pp. 13-32. A progressist historian puts other features on the foreground, quoting Fal say that in Nazi Germany \\"en lo moral, el dominio de la materia, de las corrientes impetuosas racistas y de la educaci√≥n m√°s pagana; en lo pol√≠tico, la tiran√≠a del Estado; en lo social, el mecanismo de los individuos y profesiones en jerarqu√≠as sindicales tir√°nicas; en lo econ√≥mico, la subyugaci√≥n mayor imaginable de los derechos individuales y la negaci√≥n de la libertad (incluso la l√≠cita y necesaria), en beneficio de los intereses estatales\\", Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 264; similar approach by a student from Anglo-Saxon Protestant realm, see Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 163-185. Despite Fal‚Äôs stance, upon the outbreak of Nazi-Soviet war the German consulate in Bilbao was flooded with letters of support from Carlist leaders and there were many cases of Carlists enlisting to Division Azul, Xos√©-Manoel Nu√±ez-Seixas, An Approach to the Social Profile and the Ideological Motivations of the Spanish Volunteers of the \\"Blue Division\\", 1941-1944, [in:] Sonja Levsen, Christine Kr√ºger (eds.), War Volunteering in Modern Times, London 2010, , pp. 248-74 this did not spare him charges of entanglement in a British plot,\\"Operaci√≥n Azor\\" was a plot advanced by British consular services in Spain, intended as a response to would-be Nazi invasion of the peninsula; some Carlists in Vascongadas, Navarre and Andalusia might have been involved, triggering alarm among Franco‚Äôs security services. When on exile in Menorca Fal sent his own personal envoy to investigate the issue, Martorell P√©rez 2009, pp. 270-1. Some scholars claim that Fal was against any pro-British action; Joaqu√≠n Baleztena ‚Äì with approval if not on demand of Fal ‚Äì opposed an idea to turn Requet√© into a British espionage service, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 268-9. There are scholars, however, who claim exactly the opposite; a Carlist tercio was to be formed under Fal‚Äôs auspices to fight alongside the Allies against the Nazis, Clemente 2011, p. 223, P√©rez-Nievas 1999, p. 146; the source quoted is Mar√≠a Teresa de Borb√≥n Parma. Another version pertaining to Fal‚Äôs exile is that it was triggered by his refusal to call the Carlists to join Division Azul, Josep Carles Clemente, Historia del Carlismo contemporaneo, Barcelona 1977, , p. 31 resulting in 4-month-long Ferreries exile in 1941.the question of Fal‚Äôs exile is rather confused. Some authors claim it was limited to Menorca and lasted 3-4 months, between October and Christmas 1941, see Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 48, Canal 2000, p. 349. Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 270 provides ambiguous account which suggests he was released in 1942 or even later. Some claim that Fal was repeatedly ordered periods of exile, namely in Chiclana (1940), Menorca (1941) and Chipiona (1942), Clemente 2011, p. 223, Clemente 2013, p. 32. Another rather obscure issue is a possible assassination attempt on Fal, mounted allegedly by Serrano and the Nazis; the dates given are fall of 1941, see Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 270, or spring of 1942, see Vallverd√∫ 2014, p. 92 Back in Seville Fal was occasionally allowed to travel and was present during the massive Montserrat gatherings in 1942ending in riots and clashes between Carlists and Falangists, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 239 and 1945.during the Montserrat aplec of 1945, so far the largest Carlist gathering in Francoist Spain (some 30,000 attendants), Fal threatened with a new war in case liberal monarchy of Juan de Borb√≥n is established, Martorell P√©rez 2009, pp. 252-3 In 1943 he co-engineered Reclamaci√≥n del poder, another memorandum signed by many Carlists and left unanswered by Franco.Payne 1987, p. 328, Alfonso Ballestero, Jos√© Ma de Oriol y Urquijo, Madrid 2014, , p. 80, Vallverd√∫ 2014, p. 96. The document declared \\"la discrepancia mantenida por la Comuni√≥n con el ensayo totalitario, y su apartamiento del ‚Äòpartido √∫nico‚Äô, base del sistema\\" and stated that \\"en la zona nacional no hab√≠a ni sombra de Estado; fue la sociedad misma, movida por sentimientos profundos y eternos que le daban unidad y vida, la que hizo posible el Movimiento. Hay que tener fe en esta sociedad y respetar su repugnancia a sistemas que la violentan. Es innegable que la Sociedad espa√±ola no acepta el sistema totalitario.\\" It maintained that \\"la necesidad y la urgencia de proceder a un cambio de cosas es evidente\\" and \\"tan acusado es el clamor un√°nime de la naci√≥n que ni nuestro prolongado silencio ha podido evitar que se alcen voces de bienintencionados espa√±oles, no todos autorizados pol√≠ticamente para discrepar del r√©gimen ni para interpretar el que necesita Espa√±a\\", finally demanding that \\"entregado a esta gloriosa Comuni√≥n para que instaure el orden definitivo y nacional inspirado en el pensamiento tradicionalista\\", quoted after Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 244, Clemente 2013, p. 33 According to an unsure source, in 1944 he supported an aborted monarchist plot to depose the dictator.Martorell P√©rez 2009, pp. 298-300 In August 1945 Fal addressed Franco with a conciliatory personal letter; sort of acknowledging Falangist regime, but presenting Traditionalism as the unique long-term solution, he asked for release from confinement.Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 300, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 49 The house arrest was indeed lifted in November 1945;Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 306 during the 6-year long period of detention Fal went on practicing as a lawyer.the letter from the civil governor to Fal sort of apologised that 2 uniformed policemen in front of his house might have discouraged customers of his law office, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 306 Resurgence and demise Mauricio de Sivatte In December 1945 Valencia and Pamplona were rocked by Carlist riots; some speculate that they were pre-planned as a revolt against Franco.Aurora Villanueva Mart√≠nez, Los incidentes del 3 de diciembre de 1945 en la Plaza del Castillo, [in:] Principe de Viana 58 (1997), pp. 629‚Äì650, Manuel de Santa Cruz [Alberto Ruiz de Galarreta], Apuntes y documentos para la historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol (1939-1966), Madrid, 1984-1991, vol. 7, p. 155 and onwards. The moment was peculiar; following the end of World War Two many assumed that victorious Allies would inevitably topple Franco, considered last fascist standing, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 304-5 Fal's presence is unsure;though allegedly he was planned to be there, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 318; there is no proof of his presence, though Alfonso Carlos Fal-Conde Macias maintained that his father was present, Villanueva Mart√≠nez 1997, pp. 630, 649 3 weeks later he met Don Javier in San Sebasti√°n;first time since 1937, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 319 he also wrote to Don Juan, inviting him to recognize the regency.Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 50 Soon Fal commenced visiting provincial party structures; the exercise climaxed in monthly tour across the North in September 1946.Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 320, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 49 Considering re-organization complete, in 1947 he assembled 48 local jefes in Madrid, the first such meeting since Insua.among the present were Jos√© Mar√≠a Lamami√© de Clairac y de la Colina, Juan Antonio de Olaz√°bal, Jos√© Luis Zamanillo-Camino, Jos√© Mar√≠a Valiente Soriano, Guti√©rrez Colomer y Gonz√°lez Pons, Juan S√°enz D√≠ez, Marcial Solana, Manuel Senante, M√°ximo Palomar, Ram√≥n Contreras, Mauricio de Sivatte, Pedro Gaviria, conde de Samatier, Jos√© Mar√≠a Barber, Luis Ortiz Estrada, Jos√© Quint Zaforteza, Calixto Gonz√°lez-Quevedo, Fernando L√≥pez Barranco, Juan J.

La √∫nica soluci√≥n,full title La √∫nica soluci√≥n (Llamamiento de la Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista con la concreci√≥n pr√°ctica de sus principios. Con ocasi√≥n de la presi√≥n internacional y el cerco de la ONU. Inminente Ley de Sucesi√≥n); the document protested also international ostracism towards Spain. Martorell P√©rez 2009, pp. 321-2; 374 a document released afterwards, confirmed non-collaborative stance versus Francoism,according to the document, \\"el r√©gimen de Caudillaje\\" does not have \\"ni caracteres de estabilidad ni raiz espa√±ola, por ser un r√©gimen de poder personal, inconciliable con los derechos de la persona humana y de las entidades infrasoberanas en que aquella se desenvuelve\\" Juanismothis has not always been the case. In late 1934 he was quoted as declaring to a small circle of supporters that \\"la ley de sucesi√≥n determina el derecho a ocupar el trono a favor de don Juan de Borb√≥n\\", though he noted also that \\"si don Juan no deja de ser lo que es, no podra ocupar el trono legitimo\\", quoted after Francisco de las Heras y Borrero, Un pretendiente desconocido. Carlos de Habsburgo. El otro candidato de Franco, Madrid 2004, , p. 30 and Carloctavismo.already in 1943 Fal expulsed the Carloctavistas from Carlism, Canal 2000, p. 352 Addressing a massively attended Montserrat aplec of 1947during the Montserrat aplec of 1946 Fal delivered a vehemently anti- communist address; Franco liked it so much that he offered Fal the San Sebasti√°n bullring to hold a meeting, MacClancy 2000, p. 84 seemed to demonstrate that Carlism was getting back in shape.Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 322, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 50; text of his address Clemente 2013, pp. 100-105 Leadership of Fal was coming under fire from two groups. The Sivattistas suspected that by supporting overdue regency Fal intended to ensure the crown for Borb√≥n-Parmas by appeasing Franco.Alcal√° 2001, pp. 43, 59-62; 67, 71-72, Vallverd√∫ 2014, esp. the chapter L‚Äôenfrontament Sivatte ‚Äì Fal Conde, pp. 106-111; the moment which caused particular tension was the spring of 1948, when the annual Montserrat aplec was banned by the authorities; Sivatte accused Fal not only of mild compliance, but also of not uttering a single word of protest, Alcal√° 2001, pp. 82-3 They were enraged by Fal's recommendation to support Ley de Sucesi√≥n in referendum, considering it unacceptable backing of the regime,Sivatte claimed that even voting \\"no\\" in the referendum was improper; the only correct path was to ignore all Francoist referenda, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 27, Alcal√° 2001, pp. 74-80 and demanded that a new Carlist king is declared.Alcal√° 2001, pp. 56-60; the most logical choice, also according to Sivatte, would have been Don Javier himself. Also the Navarros, though not as militant as Sivatte, were disappointed by Fal‚Äôs refusal to call a grand Carlist assembly, which would declare a new king; in November 1944 the entire Navarrese junta resigned in protest, Villanueva 1998, p. 107 On the other hand, the possibilists were getting tired of what they perceived as ineffective intransigency and lack of legal outposts, recommending more flexible attitude.already in 1945 the first signs of dissent started to appear: Arauz de Robles worked out a document, Acta de Uni√≥n Nacional para la restauraci√≥n de la Monarqu√≠a Tradicional en Espa√±a, in which he called for a broad union against totalitarian designs, naming Fal as the one who clung to exclusivist Carlist strategy, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 299 Though in 1948 Consejo de la Tradicion confirmed non-collaborationist strategy,Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 326 in 1949 some voices called for a more active stance, especially following news of Franco's negotiations with Don Juan.especially that at the turn of the decades international pressure eased, the Francoist regime seemed consolidated and speculations about Franco‚Äôs imminent removal faded away, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 328 Don Javier as king on the cover of a Carlist periodical, 1950s Fal's reaction was multifold. On the one hand, he fought back militant dissenters like Sivatte.for review of mounting tension between Fal and Sivatte, leading to the latter being dismissed from Catalan jefatura in 1949, see Alcal√° 2001, pp. 84-91, Vallverd√∫ 2014, pp. 111-113. The dismissal note read:Excmo. Sr. D. Mauricio de Sivatte, Barcelona. Por tu actitud indisciplinada me veo en la necessidad de dimitirte y te ordeno hagas entrega del cargo, ficheros, documentaci√≥n y medios econ√≥micos a la persona o Junta que yo lo comunique.

Sivatte‚Äôs successor was Jos√© Puig Pellicer, Clemente 1977, p. 227 On the other, he tried to address questions raised. Intending to broaden the party's room for maneuvering, he permitted individual CarlistsCarlism as a movement abstained from taking part in elections to run in local elections,Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 326 especially that in some provinces the movement effectively competed for power with Falange.Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 218-226, At that time competition for power between the Falangists and the Carlists was taking place in all 4 vasco-navarrese provinces.

At that time Carlism controlled fully only one daily, the Pamplona-based El Pensamiento Navarro (disguised as commercial enterprise), with other periodicals issued by various combatant or quasi-religious associations, like Requet√©s, Tiempos Cr√≠ticos, Bolet√≠n de Orientaci√≥n Tradicionalista, Monarqu√≠a Popular, Boina Roja and other the title later served as an unofficial Carlist tribune.when it was taken over by the Alfonsinos. Its staff included Manuel Cerezales, husband of Carmen Laforet, the Juan Jos√© y Jos√© Luis Pe√±a Ib√°√±ez brothers and Jos√© Go√±i Aizpurua. Apart from the issuing the newspaper, the company remained an important Carlist Madrid outpost with a meeting hall, periodical conferences and other social activity going beyond journalism Student and worker groupings, AET and MOT, recorded increased activity.when discussing AET and MOT dynamism in the early 1950s, scholars fail to mention Fal as a person engineering or encouraging this activity, compare Martorell P√©rez 2009, pp. 328-331. In 1954 it was Fal who nominated Ram√≥n Mass√≥, the future leader of Huguistas, as jefe of AET, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 392, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 75. He kept corresponding with Mass√≥ also in the late 1960s, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 74 Though in 1951 Fal tried to keep low profile of Don Javier's tour across Levante,that proved hardly possible as news of the Carlist king arriving leaked out, prompting crowds to welcome their monarch to embarrassment of both Don Javier and Fal, Martorell P√©rez 2009, pp. 338‚Äì39 all this changed in 1952: during Eucharistic Congress in Barcelona Don Javier claimed his rights as a kingin as usual ambiguous terms; Don Javier avoided direct language and stated literally that \\"he resuelto asumir la realeza de las Coronas de Espa√±a en sucesi√≥n del √∫ltimo Rey\\", quoted after Canal 2000, p. 354. Though Fal for 15 years opposed terminating the regency, in 1952 it was he who convinced Don Javier to declare himself king; one scholar considers Acto de Barcelona \\"l‚Äôobra mestra de Fal, [which] aviv√° el carlisme i aill√° la Comuni√≥ del perill contaminant del joanisme i del franquisme\\", Vallverd√∫ 2014, p. 144 before having been promptly expulsed from Spain.Martorell P√©rez 2009, pp. 339‚Äì40, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, pp. 51‚Äì52 As Don Javier soon backtracked on the so- called Acto de Barcelona and Franco's regime showed no signs of cracking, the non-collaborative policy of the Falcondistas was increasingly looking like a dead end street. The so-called \\"duros\\" advocated a decisive anti-Francoist course,like Antonio Arr√∫e, the Baleztena brothers, El√≠as Querejeta, Ignacio Ruiz de la Prada or Pablo Iturria, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 392 the so-called \\"unionistas\\" opted for rapprochement towards the regime and possibly a dynastical accord with Alfonsinos,like Rafael Olaz√°bal or Jos√© Mar√≠a Ara√∫z de Robles, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 392, see also Mercedes V√°zquez de Prada, El final de una ilusi√≥n. Auge y declive del tradicionalismo carlista (1957-1967), Madrid 2016, , pp. 33-34 some in the party called for a \\"tercera v√≠a\\"Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 340; presumably it stood for a third way between collaboration and opposition. and many complained about Fal's \\"estilo autoritario\\".Mercedes V√°zquez de Prada Tiffe, La reorganizaci√≥n del carlismo vasco en los sesenta: entre la pasividad y el \\"separatismo\\", [in:] Vasconia. Cuadernos de Historia- Geograf√≠a, 38 (2012), p. 1115. Witness to the above is the Carlist political programme for 1954, ambiguous and self-contradictory. E.g., when it comes to Falange or the royal role of don Javier, see here. Some scholars claim that long personal command of Fal left the Carlist executive inoperational, as \\"nadie se entendia con nadie\\", V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 41 Fal himself has run out of steam; in his July 1955 letter to Franco he seemed settled for the perspective of mere survival of Carlism.\\"En general, en toda Espa√±a se nota en el Carlismo el efecto del cansancio. Ciertamente que no han podido nuestros adversarios hacernos desaparecer. En ning√∫n pa√≠s del mundo, bajo los totalitarismos, han perdurado los partidos de oposici√≥n ni siquiera cinco a√±os. En Espa√±a, por asistencia de Dios a esta nobil√≠sima Causa, a√∫n existimos al cabo de diecinueve a√±os en que nos faltan los medios precisamente vitales: la prensa, los actos de propaganda, los c√≠rculos, la libertad de constituci√≥n de Juntas, etc.\\" quoted after Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 381 Though he remained in perfect understanding with Don Javier and until that moment the terms \\"Falcondistas\\" and \\"Javieristas\\" were used interchangeably,compare Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 14 also the Carlist king felt that Carlism needed a new leader. In August 1955 Fal resignedMartorell P√©rez 2009, p. 393; resignation was in fact suggested by Don Javier. It came as a surprise, since earlier that year Fal staged many warm meetings with the royal family, e.g. in Seville, Lourdes and San Sebasti√°n, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 53. According to some accounts Don Javier sacked Fal in a cowardly and backhand manner, MacClancy 2000, p. 87, the version difficult to reconcile with later continuously cordial relations between Fal and his king. Franco was delighted to hear the news, convinced that Carlism would soon be domesticated \\"una vez eliminado ese hombre, intolerante, intransigente y dominante\\", quoted after Manuel Martorell P√©rez, Carlos Hugo frente a Juan Carlos. La soluci√≥n federal para Espa√±a que Franco rechaz√≥, Madrid 2014, , p. 110 as Jefe Delegado.so far he is the longest-serving Carlist political leader, with 21 years at the helm of the organisations. Out of other historical leaders (regardless of their formal title), Cerralbo headed Carlism for 15 years, Valiente 13, Villores 11, Carlos Hugo 11, Barrio 10, Nocedal 6, Feliu 3, Rodezno 2, Larramendi 2, Comin 1 and Sanz 1 Retiree Don Javier, 1960 Following his resignation Fal took a step back from daily politicsMar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 60; however, he remained moderately active in private, compare references to his correspondence with members of the Carlist executive in the 1960s, noted in V√°zquez de Prada 2016 and functioned as honorary member, sporadically invited to sittings of Carlist executive as late as 1964.Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 57 He remained loyal to the new Communion leader, Valiente,he was initially heading Secreteria Nacional and was appointed jefe delegado in 1960, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, pp. 12, 79 even given the latter embarked on new, collaborationist strategy.Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 20 Though continuously anti- Francoist, he avoided uncompromising radicalism. On the one hand, in 1956 he opposed backtracking on Acto de Barcelona, demanded by the Francoist authorities.Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 55 On the other, when consulted about planned appearance of Carlos Hugo at Montejurra in 1957, he spoke to the negative, warning about a violent reaction from Franco.Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 415 Though his advice was ignored, he maintained good relations with Carlos Hugohe was many times visited in his Seville home by Carlos Hugo and his sisters, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 56 and was consulted on his 1958 Montejurra address.Fal was generally approving though he considered references to a federal Europe excessive, V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 86 Upon first signs of breakup between Progressists and Traditionalists Fal praised Carlos Hugo for ousting Zamanillo in 1962.MacClancy 2000, p. 99 He attended some Montejurra aplecs, turning into the prince's promotional stage, himself; in 1963 he needed assistance when climbing the summit.but was greeted with enthusiasm by the crowd, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 57. Carlos Hugo, not yet ready for an open challenge and unveiled promotion of his socialist outlook, insisted on Fal‚Äôs presence to sustain his Traditionalist credentials, put into question by expulsing Zamanillo one year earlier, MacClancy 2000, p. 148. Out of Carlist annual gatherings of that time Fal preferred the Andalusian Quintillo over Catalan Montserrat or Navarrese Montejurra. However, though through most of his political career Fal either was pitted against the Navarrese leaders (like Rodezno) or at best remained in most circumspect co-operation with them (like Baleztena), he retained great respect for Navarre and its spirit, see his comments in Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, pp. 290-1 In the mid-1960s he recommended publication of a \\"libro blanco\\", advancing the Borb√≥n-Parma claim.V√°zquez de Prada 2016, pp. 258-259 In 1967 Don Javier made Fal Duque de Quintillo, Grandee of Spain,Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 58, V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 336 an exceptional honor as it was the only case of Don Javier granting a noble title to anyone beyond the royal family.Francisco de las Heras Borrero, Derecho premial de los reyes carlistas, [in:] Cuadernos de Ayala 39 (2009), p. 9; unlike most titles granted by Carlist kings, this one has not been recognized either by Franco of by post-Francoist Spain Despite the elevation, cordial relations between Fal and his king were deteriorating.already in the early 1960s Fal refused to join a planned Consejo Privado of Don Javier. Eventually the body failed to materialize, Daniel Jes√∫s Garc√≠a Riol, La resistencia tradicionalista a la renovaci√≥n ideol√≥gica del carlismo (1965-1973) [PhD thesis UNED], Madrid 2015, p. 54 Quoting health reasons, Fal did not attend the ducado ceremony in Fatima.on grounds of his health Fal refused to attend the act of elevation to Duque de Quntillo, arranged in Fatima; it was his son Domingo Fal-Conde Macias who representing him, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 58 Though Don Javier and Carlos Hugo urged him to recommend supporting Ley Org√°nica in the 1966 referendum, Fal agreed to recommend participation,V√°zquez de Prada 2016, pp. 293-293 but clinging to his anti-Francoism he refused to endorse the law.Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 58; he noted that as the proposed might have pursued a hidden agenda related to the Juanist restoration, the Comunion should refrain from recommending either a \\"yes\\" or a \\"no\\" vote, V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 293 When in 1968 the Borb√≥n- Parmas were expulsed from Spain, Fal resisted their repeated requests to meet Franco seeking reversal of the decision and responded that he had no reason to pay a penitent visit to the dictator.Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 59; the animosity was fully mutual and on Franco‚Äôs part included petty malignancy. In 1968 Ministry of Justice refused to honor Fal with customary golden medal, celebrating 50 years of his career as a lawyer, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 58. Instead, one year later the Seville Colegio de Abogados made him decano honorario, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 59 In wide correspondence he expressed concern about the socialist stand of Carlos Hugo of the late 1960s. Despite mounting doubts, he did not join those turned against the dynasty, like Zamanillo or Elias de Tejada;e.g. in 1968 he voiced against rapprochement with Sivatte, Zamanillo (former Falcondista, expulsed from the Comuni√≥n by Huguistas in the early 1960s) or Elias de Tejada, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 185; as late as 1972 he defended loyalty to the dynasty against the dissidents, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 231 when in 1970 the prince ordered termination of collaboration with El Pensamiento Navarro, re-claimed by orthodox Traditionalists, Fal complied.Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 61; he did not join the plot consisting of setting up Hermandad de Maestrazgo as a breakup Carlist grouping intended to wrest power away from Don Carlos Hugo and his entourage, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, pp. 234-6 He was particularly embittered by cancellation of annual Quintillo remembrance act in 1972.according to one source, the newly created Partido Carlista adopted a clandestine format and considered staging public celebrations in Qunitillo incompatible with this policy, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, pp. 60-1. The Montejurra gatherings went on, though with drastically diminishing attendance; it was down from 100,000 in the late 1960s to some 10,000 in 1973, MacClancy 2000, p. 275 In 1973 he considered himself dynastically loyal to Don Javier, but in disagreement with his political line.and with a number of other similarly minded Carlists, like Raimundo de Miguel, intended to write a collective letter to the king; the idea was to deliver the message of dynastic loyalty and ideological disagreement, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, pp. 276-9; The contents of his last political letter to Don Javier, written in 1973, is not known, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 61. On grounds of loyalty to the king, Fal kept defending Don Javier against attacks of Sivatte as late as 1973, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 180 In 1974 Fal lost any illusions as to the Leftist turn of the Borb√≥n-Parmas.in his 1974 letter he dubbed cursillos, organized by socialist Partido Carlista for its young militants, \\"brainwashing\\", Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 191 Don Carlos Hugo, 1970 Throughout all his life Fal was a fervent Catholic, receiving communion every day even when visiting frontlines during the Civil War.Jacek Bartyzel, Manuel (Jos√©) Fal Conde, [in:] legitymizm.org service, available here When released from political duties he was dedicating even more time to religious issues.he remained on very close if not cordial terms with cardenal Segura until the latter‚Äôs death, the two driven together by similarly Integrist, holistic vision of religion and politics. Fal is one of key protagonists in Mart√≠nez S√°nchez 2000 He co-founded religious associations,like La Confianza en el Coraz√≥n de Jesus in Higuera accepted posts in otherslike Sevillan branch of Congregaci√≥n de las Obreras del Coraz√≥n and was active in Andalusian initiatives of various orders.the Jesuits, Claretians, Sisters of Adoration, Salesians and other orders, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, p. 56 He headed Editorial Cat√≥lica Espa√±olathe publishing house he co-founded back in 1938 with Segura, Canal 2000, p. 392 and launched Premio Vedruna,in 1965 its first recipient was Rafael Gambra, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 38, Manuel Santa Cruz [Alberto Ruiz de Galarreta], Rafael Gambra. Un hombre cabal, [in:] Anales de la Fundaci√≥n Francisco El√≠as de Tejada 2004 (10), pp. 177-8 though remained perplexed by new course of the Vatican.commenting on increasingly progressist attitude of Spanish bishops, Fal wrote about \\"la obra del liberalismo, el diab√≥lico efecto de la pol√≠tica que interviene en la presentaci√≥n, el presupuesto de clero, los favores oficiales, coche y chaufer\\", quoted after Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 203 In the early 1970s \\"Don Manuel\\" enjoyed patriarch status in the realm of Andalusian Catholicismhis vision of Carlism became increasingly religion-focused. In the 1973 letter he wrote: \\"we used to say that where is a rifle and an arm to raise it, there is Carlism. Now we can say it is where a tabernacle and a person to adore it are\\", quoted after Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 264 and among Traditionalist Carlists nationwide.receiving massive homage correspondence during various anniversaries, Mar√≠n, Burgue√±o 1978, pp. 60-63; in 1974 Fal was even visited in his Seville home by his former arch-enemy, Sivatte, who intended to invite Fal to an anti-Huguista initiative, Alcal√° 2001, p. 177 He remained emotionally attached to Don Javier. Fal died one month after his abidcation. Reception and legacy Elections in Spain, 1977 As political event the death of Fal was soon eclipsed by the just commencing Spanish transition to democracy. In the late 1970s and the 1980s his memory was subject to competition on part of the socialist Partido Carlista and various breeds of Traditionalism, especially as they engaged in bitter political struggle. Followers of Don Carlos Hugo presented Fal focusing on his loyalty to Borb√≥n- Parmas and on his anti-Francoism, attempting to mount him in their overall vision of Carlism as a popular class struggle.compare e.g. recollections of Mar√≠a Teresa de Borb√≥n: when mentioning \\"amigos que ven√≠an a casa\\" she mentions in one go \\"Fal Conde, el padre Arturo Juncosa, Jos√© Mar√≠a de Zavala y Josep Carles Clemente\\", placing Fal among most hardline socialist progressists, quoted after Clemente 1999, p. 87. Most works of Clemente himself are good example of presenting Fal as supporter of Carlos Hugo and his vision of \\"popular Carlism\\". In his most notorious exercise Clemente presented short biographical portraits of Carlist leaders suiting his vision grouped as \\"Retratos populares del carlismo\\", while the others were presented under the heading \\"Retablo de traidores\\"; Fal was within the first group, Clemente 2011, pp. 220-224. Somewhat different approach is presented by another socialist from Partido Carlista, who shows little sympathy for Fal as an Integrist who together with Alfonso Carlos undid the progressist work of Don Jaime, P√©rez- Nievas 1999, p. 102 Traditionalists, including Fal's sons, reclaimed him as fervent Catholic and a conservative who guarded genuine Carlist orthodoxy against Francoism but has also never approved of the socialist turn of the Huguistas.compare Jos√© Miguel Gambra, leader of CTC, quoting Fal on the issue of Catholic unity, see carlismo.es service available here These two visions, offered by militants of both groupings, keep contending until today.compare the progressist site quoting Fal say \\"no son los pueblos por los reyes, sino los reyes por los pueblos\\", available here, and the Traditionalist site quoting Fal say \\"ante Dios nunca ser√°s h√©roe an√≥nimo\\", available here Fal started to figure prominently in historiography in the 1990s, and until today there have been numerous articles published in specialized reviews, dedicated either to particular episodes or to certain dimensions of his activity.compare Mar√≠a Cruz Rubio Liniers, Mar√≠a Talavera D√≠az, Bibliograf√≠as de Historia de Espa√±a, vol. XIII: El carlismo, Madrid 2012, However, he gained no full-blown scholarly monograph so far. Two books dedicated to Fal and published in 1978 and 1998 are formatted as homage rather than as scientific historical works.anonymous In memoriam Manuel J.

It is also useful to mention monographical issue of Aportes 27 (1995), dedicated to Fal He is usually presented as an intransigent opponent of Franco.MacClancy 2000, pp. 76-7, Ismael Saz, Fascismo y franquismo, Valencia 2004, , p. 132, Concha Langa Nu√±o, De c√≥mo se improvis√≥ el franquismo durante la Guerra Civil: la aportaci√≥n del ABC de Sevilla, Valencia 2007, , p. 15, Gonzalo √Ålvarez Chillida, Jos√© Mar√≠a Pem√°n: pensamiento y trayectoria de un mon√°rquico (1897-1941), C√°diz 1996, , p. 102, Gonzalo Redondo, Historia de la Iglesia en Espa√±a, 1931-1939: La Guerra Civil, 1936-1939, Madrid 1993, , p. 204, Raymond Carr, Juan Pablo Fusi Aizpur√∫a, Espa√±a, de la dictadura a la democracia, Madrid 1979, , p. 50, Enrique Moradiellos, Franco frente a Churchill, Madrid 2007, , p. 205. There are exceptions, though. Some authors claim that Fal and Don Javier were actually supporting Franco; according to this view, they courted the dictator by maintaining regency and refraining from claiming royal title for Don Javier; the objective was to ensure instauration of Carlos Hugo as the Francoist king , Alcal√° 2001, pp. 71-78, 148 He is generally recognized for excellent organizational skills, especially during early years of his leadership,Vallverd√∫ 2008, p. , p. 160 though there are exceptions.some scholars praise rather his key antagonist Rodezno for pragmatism, as \\"compared to Rodezno‚Äôs pragmatic strategy, Fal Conde‚Äôs was sheer wishful thinking\\", Blinkhorn 2008, p. 154 Fal is usually not acclaimed as a theorist; some students tend to view him as an inflexible doctrinaire,the view prevailing among students sympathetic to those Carlists who commenced collaboration with Franco, compare references to \\"intransigencia doctrinal que mostraban Fal Conde y don Javier\\", Ballestero 2014, p. 58 those who do not underline his Integrist, holistic vision of politics and religion.Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 162-3 Montejurra, 2014 In popular discourse Fal, unlike most Carlist political leaders, has generally evaded usual lambasting as \\"fascista\\" (fascist) or \\"reaccionario\\" (reactionary). Newspaper pieces claim that he \\"revived popular character of Carlism\\" and even maintain that his vision contained threads which could have contributed to \\"reencuentro de Espa√±a\\" (reuinion of Spain), but were lost in \\"tiempos de intolerancia\\" (times of intolerance).ABC 17.05.15 Nevertheless, naming of a major throughway street honoring Fal in Sevilla was contested; some historianslike Leandro √Ålvarez Rey or Francisco Espinosa Maestre, see C√©sar Rufino, El fascismo contra la pared, [in:] 'El Correo de Andalucia', 15.09.09, available here indicated that while in Germany and Italy apology of fascism was illegal, in Spain historical memory suffered a lobbotomy and street names commemorating Fal proved that it was \\"s√≥lo memoria hist√≥rica de la derecha\\" (only a historical memory of the Right).Rufino 2009 As a result, in 2009 the street was renamedDiario de Sevilla 14.05.09, available here; it now honours Victoria Dominguez Cerrato, local community activist from the Poligono Sur quarter of Seville, compare here with Fal's name retained only in a short adjacent drive.to have a glance, compare here See also * Carlism * Integrism (Spain) * Don Javier * Tom√°s Dom√≠nguez Ar√©valo * Maurici de Sivatte i de Bobadilla * Unification Decree (Spain, 1937) Footnotes Further reading * C√©sar Alcal√°, D.

The OP-1 is Teenage Engineering's first product; it was released in 2011 following an introduction at the NAMM Show. It is also considered their core product. The OP-1 is well known for its unconventional design, AMOLED display, and the depth of its synthesis engines. It has received some criticism for its physical limitations; however, according to Teenage Engineering cofounder Jesper Kouthoofd, these limitations were programmed into the synthesizer in order to stimulate the design process and the creativity of the user. Development Teenage Engineering was founded in 2005 by Jesper Kouthoofd, David Eriksson, Jens Rudberg and David Mollerstedt. The OP-1 is the first product developed by the company. At the time, the team consisted of nine engineers and software developers. Following an announcement at Frankfurt Musikmesse in 2009, they presented a prototype of the OP-1 at the 2010 NAMM Show in Anaheim, and it was released in the following year. The design of the OP-1 was influenced by the VL-Tone, a synthesizer and pocket calculator manufactured by Casio in 1979. The VL-1 is known for its toy-like novelty sounds and cheap build quality, as well as its inorganic design. In an interview with Damian Kulash of OK Go, CEO Kouthoofd explained that he worked in a music store when he was young, and he was inspired by Japanese synthesizers of the 1980s, such as the VL-Tone and the Casio SK-1, an inexpensive sampler. Kouthoofd has also stated that \\"limitations are OP-1's biggest feature\\". The synthesizer's designers attempted to use the limitation of physical hardware to encourage the unit to stimulate creativity, which might become unfocused in a limitless environment, such as a digital audio workstation. In 2012, Teenage Engineering introduced several \\"accessories\\" for the OP-1. These can be used to manipulate the unit's macro effect knobs. One of the accessories makes the OP-1 compatible with Lego gears and motors, which can be used to mechanically modulate low-frequency oscillators and other effects. The OP-1 became unavailable for a period from late 2018 to early 2019 due to Teenage Engineering exhausting their stock of the AMOLED display screen. Due to rumors that the synthesizer had been permanently discontinued, the resell value of the OP-1 dramatically increased to surpass its original retail price. In February, Teenage Engineering announced that they would resume production of the OP-1; however, the retail price increased by approximately 35% to cover the new parts and redesigned hardware. The price increase was met with criticism due to a perception of poor resource planning. Features =Sound synthesis= The OP-1 includes eleven synthesis engines. For each engine, the OP-1's four knobs act as different macro controllers. In addition to a sampler, the OP-1 is preloaded with sampled drum hits. The synthesizer is monotimbral, with six voices of polyphony. It also includes an FM radio, which can be recorded into the sampler or used to modulate effects. The operating system was updated in 2014 adding additional effects and features. The OP-1's eleven synthesis engines are FM, Cluster, Digital, DNA, DSynth, Dr Wave, String, Phase, Pulse, Sampler, and Voltage. Each is represented by a different graphic on the display screen. The FM engine is a simple FM synthesizer. The Cluster engine produces a distorted sound reminiscent of the Roland JP-8000 supersaw. DNA is a noise generator. Dr Wave resembles the sound of a talk box. Digital provides ring modulation and wave shape parameters to distort the sound signal. String creates string instrument emulation, ranging from bass to string pads. Pulse is a square wave engine. Phase provides two pulse waves that can be modulated and distorted. DSynth provides a dual oscillator synthesizer with multiple filter types. Voltage is a multi-oscillator synthesizer. The Sampler interface is a sampler, which can take input from the OP-1's built-in microphone, an external audio input, or the builtin FM radio. =Display screen= One of the key features of the OP-1 is its 320 x 160-pixel OLED display, which shows a graphical representation of the device's current mode. Although some of the displays use traditional symbols, such as the fairly straightforward ADSR envelope, others use more literal or unconventional graphics. For example, the \\"punch\\" effect (a compressor) is represented by a line art illustration of a boxer. =Keyboard= The OP-1 has a fixed-velocity keyboard with 24 keys. Arrow keys are provided to transpose up or down octaves while in synthesizer or drum mode. Four octave shifts up and four shifts down are available giving the user a total range of ten octaves. Reception Reception for the OP-1 was largely positive, citing its powerful synthesizer engines and unconventional format and design. However, it has received some criticism for its small size and simplicity, which make it resemble a toy. It also lacks velocity sensitivity, making it minimally expressive. = Awards and accolades = The OP-1 has gained recognition for both its design quality and its functionality as an instrument. The synthesizer won one of ten of Sweden's Design S Awards in 2012. The award committee described the OP-1 as \\"A technological product which through a clever colour scheme and fantastic graphics is intuitive, easily accessible and incredibly inviting. Music and machine in one\\". In 2014, the OP-1 was awarded second prize in Georgia Tech's Margaret Guthman Musical Instrument Competition. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art includes an OP-1, donated by Teenage Engineering, in its permanent collection.

He played all or part of four seasons in Major League Baseball, between 1978 and 1983, for the Chicago White Sox and Oakland Athletics.  Amateur career  Highly sought after out of Odessa High School in Odessa, Texas, Wortham was selected in the 5th round of the 1972 draft by the Texas Rangers,Rich Wortham transactions at Baseball-Reference but instead elected to attend the University of Texas and play for legendary Coach Cliff Gustafson. In 1973, he was also a member of Team USA during the Federaci√≥n Mundial de B√©isbol Amateur Amateur World Series, the first time Team USA won a Gold Medal in that competition. He defeated Dennis Mart√≠nez and Team Nicaragua in the final. Wortham had a great deal of success as a college pitcher with a record of 50‚Äì7 and was the ace of the 1975 Longhorns team that won the College World Series. He was drafted again that year by the Rangers in the 14th round, but again did not sign. He was then selected by the White Sox in the January secondary phase of the 1976 draft.  Professional career  = Early minor league career = After signing with the White Sox, he was assigned directly to Double-A Knoxville, skipping over the lower minor league levels. He appeared in eleven games for Knoxville, 10 as a starting pitcher, finishing with a 4‚Äì2 record and an ERA of 4.24. He began the 1977 season in Knoxville, but was promoted to the Triple-A Iowa Oaks after improving to a 9‚Äì7 record and 2.53 ERA in 22 games. His introduction to the highest minor league level was a rough one, however, as his ERA ballooned to 8.71 in nine starts, of which he won only one. = 1978: First taste of the majors = In 1978, Wortham opened the season in Iowa. However, when starting pitcher Ken Kravec got off to a rough start, he was sent to the minors, and Wortham was called up to replace him. He made his debut on May 3 against the Milwaukee Brewers, and he pitched 6.2 innings and gave up 3 runs in a 4‚Äì0 loss.Wortham's 1978 game log In his next start, he beat the Minnesota Twins, pitching 8 innings and giving up 2 runs on 9 hits. His next outing found him giving up 10 hits in just 4.1 innings, and he was returned to the minors, with Kravec returning to the majors. Wortham spent most of the rest of the season in Iowa, and was recalled in September when the rosters expanded. In five September starts, Wortham went 2‚Äì0 with a 2.70 ERA, lowering his overall ERA for the season to 3.02. He also pitched his first two major league complete games. Wortham was seen as a future star. = 1979: Taking a regular turn = In 1979, Wortham came out of spring training as the White Sox' number three starter. Although he did not have a spectacular year, he had a solid first full season in the major leagues. He won a career-high 14 games, but his ERA was a below-average 4.90, he was in the top ten in the league in losses with 14, and he finished fourth in the league in walks allowed with 100. However, he also finished 8th in the league in strikeouts per 9 innings pitched, and it appeared that he had solidified his position as a dependable starting pitcher. = 1980: A step backward = Wortham was moved to the bullpen to start the 1980 season, where he was used as a long reliever. He got off to an impressive start, as in his first three outings of the year, he pitched at least four innings, giving up no runs and a combined four hits in 12.2 innings while picking up a pair of wins.Wortham's 1980 game log However, as April ended, he had a bad outing, giving up five runs in two innings, followed shortly by giving up six runs without recording an out on May 4. Wortham was moved back to the rotation, and his first start of 1980 was excellent, as he pitched seven shutout innings against the Kansas City Royals to pick up his third win of the year. However, he gave up four runs in 4.2 innings in his next start, and he went back to the bullpen. The rest of the season went much the same, as he would have good and bad outings, but more bad than good, winding up with a 5.97 ERA and a record of 4‚Äì7. After the season, the White Sox traded him to the Montreal Expos for second baseman Tony Bernazard. = Back to the minors: Control problems = Wortham was assigned by the Expos to the Triple-A Denver Bears, where he struggled with wildness. He went 5‚Äì5 for Denver in 18 games with a 4.79 ERA, and was even worse in a brief demotion to the Double-A Memphis Chicks, where he posted an 8.00 ERA in 5 games. More alarming, however, was that he walked a combined 99 batters in just 95 innings, including 28 in 18 innings in Memphis. Wortham went to spring training with the Expos in 1982, but was released on April 1. He was signed by the Philadelphia Phillies, and was assigned to the Double-A Reading Phillies to work out his problems. Instead, they were magnified, as he not only posted 58 walks in just 36.2 innings, but he failed to win a game, going 0‚Äì5, and his ERA was a bloated 11.54. The Phillies released him during the offseason. = Last appearance = Shortly thereafter, Wortham was signed by the Athletics, whose pitching staff had collapsed after three seasons of abuse by manager Billy Martin. He was started slowly, being assigned to A-ball with the Modesto A's, the first time he had pitched at that lower level. After 14 games, in which he was 2‚Äì3 with a 6.75 ERA and 42 walks in 44 innings, he was moved up to the Double-A Albany A's. Even though his record there was even worse, the desperate Athletics summoned him to the major leagues. He made his last appearance in Major League Baseball on July 23, when he entered the game in the 8th inning in relief of Keith Atherton.July 23, 1983 box score He faced four batters, allowing three hits and a walk without retiring a batter. His catcher in that contest was former Longhorn teammate Bob Kearney.  Life after baseball  Wortham serves as the executive director of the Texas Beef Council. He resides in Leander, Texas.Texas Beef Council staff page In 2010, he was elected to the College Baseball Hall of Fame.Odessa American story  Notes  Sources *Baseball Almanac Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Oakland Athletics players Category:Knoxville Sox players Category:Iowa Oaks players Category:Memphis Chicks players Category:Denver Bears players Category:Reading Phillies players Category:Modesto A's players Category:Albany A's players Category:Texas Longhorns baseball players Category:Baseball players from Texas Category:People from Odessa, Texas Category:National College Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Pan American Games medalists in baseball Category:Pan American Games silver medalists for the United States Category:People from Leander, Texas Category:All-American college baseball players Category:Baseball players at the 1975 Pan American Games ","title":"Rich Wortham"},{"id":"32103815","text":"Sesamia inferens, the Asiatic pink stem borer, gramineous stem borer, pink borer, pink rice borer, pink rice stem borer, pink stem borer, purple borer, purple stem borer or purplish stem borer, is a moth of the family Noctuidae. The species was first described by Francis Walker in 1856. It is found from Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar to Japan and the Solomon Islands.\\"Asiatic pink stem borer\\". PaDIL. Australian Government Department of Agriculture. Retrieved 22 January 2019. A polyphagous species, it is a major pest in many crops worldwide. Description Its wingspan is about 28 mm. Hindwings with veins 3 and 4 from arise from the cell. Antennae of male ciliated and simple in female. Body ochreous. Forewings with a red-brown suffusion along median nervure and veins 2 to 5. A sub-marginal dark line present. Cilia paler. Hindwings are whitish. Larva smooth and shiny and lack obvious hairs or markings. Color variable but usually cream white with a distinctive pink suffusion. The head and prothoracic shield are brown. The dorsal part of the last abdominal segment bearing the anus is yellowish brown. Mature larvae are between 30‚Äì40 mm long, pink with buff and pink dorsal markings and a brown head. Pupae are up to about 18 mm long, brown to yellowish-brown with a wrinkled frontal region of the head and cremaster with four large and two small spines. Ecology The larvae mostly feed on Gramineae species, including Coix, Echinochloa, Oryza, Panicum, Saccharum, Setaria, Triticum, Zea and Zizania. Many of the food plants are of economic importance. Symptoms The caterpillars mainly bore into rice stems or the base of the panicle. After infection, the stem becomes wilted causing deadheart. Panicle attack leads to panicle to be cut leading to state called whitehead. Symptoms are mostly similar to other stem borers and hence closer look required to control the attack. Control Mechanical controlling using hand picking and pheromone traps are used. Cultural practices like crop rotation mechanisms, reducing water levels are also used in controlling. Natural enemies such as parasitoides are very effective and nature loving controlling measures. The tachinid fly Sturmiopsis inferens was also once used, but is now not effective due to their low abundance. In chemical control, BHC, DDT, fenthion, fenitrothion, quinalphos, phosphamidon sprays and granules of lindane are used. Eggs can be eliminated by introducing Trichogramma minutum and Telenomeus species. Apanteles flavipes, Bracon chinensis and Sturmiopsis inferens are effective against caterpillars, whereas Xanthopinpla species and Tetrastichus aygari are used in pupal stages.

There are generally considered to be three types of unsharpness: geometric unsharpness, motion unsharpness and photographic or system unsharpness. Motion unsharpness is caused by movement of the patient, the detector or the source of X-rays, during the exposure. Movement of the patient, either voluntary or otherwise, is the most common cause and this can be minimised in a number of ways: immobilizing the patient, asking the patient to keep still or to hold the breath and keeping exposure time short, and thereby giving them less time in which to move, are the most obvious. System unsharpness (previously called photographic unsharpnesss) is the result of the detector system employed. Every detector type has a limiting factor which determines its maximum spatial resolution. In film systems it is the size of the grains of photographic chemical. In computed radiography systems it the size of the laser used to read the phosphor plate in the cassette reader. In digital radiography systems it is the size of the individual thin film transistors. Since each type has a maximum capability, there is no way to minimise this system other than using a better and probably more expensive machine. Geometric unsharpness is caused by aspects of the geometry of the X-ray beam. Two principal factors play simultaneously: the apparent focal spot size and the ratio between object-film distance (OFD) and focus-film distance (FFD). Fine focal spot sizes will minimise geometric unsharpness, and therefore give more detailed images, but it is often impossible to employ them due to the tube loading necessary in the exposure. Keeping the ratio FFD:OFD high will minimise geometric unsharpness. This is most easily done by keeping the OFD to a minimum, i.e., keeping the part of the body being X-rayed as close to the detector as possible. If this is not possible however, then increasing FFD beyond the normal 100‚Äì110 cm will be necessary to keep the unsharpness level acceptable.

Early life Alois Hundhammer, the first of thirteen children, was born to Alois and Maria (Grill) Hundhammer on 25 February 1900 on his parents‚Äô farm in Moos. His upbringing was heavily shaped by the country lifestyle and his parent's Catholic religion. He attended the monastic school Scheyern Abbey and, despite his father's initial protest, the humanistic Dom-Gymnasium in Freising. Hundhammer's studies were interrupted in the summer of 1918 by World War I, in which he served briefly on the Western Front before enlisting in the Freikorps and taking part in the battle for Munich against the Bavarian Soviet Republic in April 1919. After the conclusion of fighting, he was able to begin studying history, philosophy, and economy at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in the winter semester of 1919/1920.Braun, Oliver (2004). \\"Alois Hundhammer.\\" Christliche Demokraten gegen Hitler: Aus Verfolgung und Widerstand zur Union. Ed. Buchstab, G√ºnter; Kaff, Brigitte; Kleinmann, Hans-Otto. Freiburg, Germany: Herder, 2004. p. 306. Print. He married Adelheid Hillenbrand in 1923. Hundhammer received his doctorate in 1923 with a thesis entitled \\"Die Geschichte des Bayerischen Bauernbundes\\" (\\"The History of the Bavarian Farmers' League). He completed a second doctorate three years later with a work on \\"the agricultural trade association of Bavaria.\\" In 1927 he became general secretary of the Upper Bavarian Christian Farmers Union. Hundhammer became the youngest representative in the Bavarian Landtag after being elected in the state elections of 1932.Braun p. 306 As a politician in the Weimar Republic, Hundhammer became known as a campaigner for farmer's rights. One of the results of his campaigning on behalf of the farming class was the published work Staatsb√ºrgerliche Vortr√§ge (Civic Lectures) in which he strongly rejected the tenets of National Socialism from a thoroughly Catholic viewpoint, labeling it the \\"new Germanic Hedonism.\\"Braun p.306-307 Nazi- era Staatsb√ºrgerliche Vortr√§ge was banned by the Nazis in 1933, the same year in which Hundhammer along with fellow Bavarian People's Party (BVP) members were arrested by the Bavarian Political Police (later: Gestapo). After being arrested on 21 June 1933, Hundhammer was placed in the newly opened Dachau concentration camp on 29 June. He was released on 22 July of the same year.Braun p.308 After his release Hundhammer entered a shattered professional and economical existence. His assets and attempts to find qualified work were both blocked by the Nazis, so he acquired a shoe-repair workshop in the fall of 1933 with the help of Father Rupert Mayer in order to continue providing for his growing family. This workshop became a point of contact for former members of the BVP as well as current members of the Munich Catholic circle before being closed by the Gestapo in November 1937.Braun p.309 Hundhammer avoided confrontation with the Nazis throughout the remainder of the Nazi-Era out of consideration for his family, which consisted of his wife and four sons by 1941. He was drafted into and served in the Wehrmacht from 1939 until 1944.Braun p.309 Postwar Hundhammer met and developed relationships with numerous politically interested prisoners while in American captivity at the end of the war. After being released in 1945, he worked with Karl Scharnagl, Josef M√ºller, and Fritz Sch√§ffer to establish the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU). As a result of his strong reputation as an opponent of the Nazis, Hundhammer experienced considerable success in building political strength. He played a crucial role in the writing of the Bavarian Constitution and was directly responsible for writing the preamble. ::*Preamble to the Constitution of the Free State of Bavaria: Hundhammer was elected parliamentary group leader of the CSU in 1946 and remained in power until 1951. He also served as Staatsminister of Education and Culture. From 1951 until 1954 he was president of the Landtag of Bavaria. In the years after the war, Hundhammer also remained particularly active in various Catholic associations. He founded the Katholischer M√§nnerverein Tuntenhausen in 1945, remained active in the Catholic student groups he had joined during his time at the university, and became a member of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre in 1957.

Frank Baum's great- grandson Roger S. Baum. The book details Dorothy Gale returning to the Land of Oz when a Jester has been using the wand of the Wicked Witch of the West (which also contained the ghost of the Wicked Witch of the West) to take over the Land of Oz. The book was adapted into a film called Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return in 2014 by Clarius Entertainment. Plot summary Several weeks after returning to Kansas from the Land of Oz, Dorothy Gale looks out of her bedroom window and sees a bright and beautiful rainbow on the horizon. She notices that the rainbow is approaching her and Toto as both of them run towards it. Dorothy starts to see Glinda the Good Witch, who tells Dorothy that she must return to Oz so that she can save the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion. Dorothy and Toto reclaim the silver shoes as they find a note from Glinda and Princess Ozma stating that the silver shoes can take her to the Land of Oz and back, for the Impassable Desert has taken away much of their power. Dorothy and Toto arrive in the Land of Oz, where the items that Dorothy has in her pocket are a small mirror, a safety pin, a glass bottle, and four of Aunt Em's homemade oatmeal cookies. Dorothy and Toto were wondering which direction they should take when they encounter a molasses- covered owl named Wiser. Wiser tells Dorothy that she is in Gillikin Country and tells her to head to Candy County and ask the Great Royal Marshmallow that rules over Candy Country. Arriving at Princess Gayelette's palace, Dorothy and Toto encounter the castle's Jester who welcomes them. The Jester tells them that Princess Gayelette and Prince Quelala have gone missing, adding that they disappeared during a party at the palace which had become haunted and points them in the direction of the castle. When Dorothy and Toto enter the palace, they find a wand that belonged to the Wicked Witch of the West lying on the table. Dorothy reminds the Jester that jesters are supposed to make people happy, causing the Jester to freeze in his tracks as the Wicked Witch of the West's ghost urges the Jester to turn Dorothy into a china doll. The Jester gives up the wand as the Wicked Witch of the West's ghost fades away. Thus, the spell is broken and everyone is returned to normal. The Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and Toto rejoice now that the spell is broken. When the Cowardly Lion asks Dorothy on what she plans to do with the Wicked Witch of the West's wand, the Scarecrow and the Tin Man plan to keep the wand locked up in a case until they can give it to Glinda and Princess Ozma. Dorothy and Toto return to Kansas where they reunite with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. The four of them then see a rainbow in the twilight sky which Dorothy has not seen before. Dorothy knows that is must be Princess Ozma, Glinda, and the Wizard of Oz's way of saying goodbye to her. The rainbow shimmers over the prairie with all the bright and true colors of the Land of Oz. Film adaptation Summertime Entertainment (the family entertainment division of Alpine Pictures) has adapted the book into the film Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return, which was released in 2014. The film stars Lea Michele as Dorothy, Dan Aykroyd as the Scarecrow, Kelsey Grammer as the Tin Man, James Belushi as the Cowardly Lion, Bernadette Peters as Glinda the Good Witch, Martin Short as the Jester, Hugh Dancy as Marshal Mallow (who is exclusive to the film), Megan Hilty as the China Princess, Patrick Stewart as Tugg, and Oliver Platt as Wiser the Owl.

He is a relative of Hawaiian music legends Henry Kapono of \\"Cecilio & Kapono\\", Billy Kaui of \\"Country Comfort\\", John and Jerome Koko of \\"The Makaha Sons\\" and Eric Lee of \\"Na Kama/\\"Ka'ala Boys\\". At the age of 14, Zinsman and Lee formed their own band called \\"Ho'onanea\\" and would perform together all throughout high school entering talent contests, playing at local bars and private functions and even placing second in the 15th Annual \\"Ka Himeni Ana\\" Hawaiian Song Contest. Early life Karl Zinsman Jr. (b. October 5, 1975) in Honolulu, Hawaii. He grew up in the town of Waianae, Hawaii, the second of four children. He got his first guitar on his twelfth birthday and taught himself to play by watching instructional videos and reading chord books. He has since taught himself to play multiple instruments. He cites the movie \\"La Bamba\\" and Michael J. Fox's guitar performance in the movie \\"Back to the Future\\" as his inspiration for wanting to become a musician. Zinsman is a 1993 graduate of St. Louis School (Honolulu, Hi.) where he was a standout offensive lineman and played on three of The Crusaders' 14 straight State Championship teams under two-time National Coach of The Year and the most prolific coach in Hawaii high school football history, Cal Lee. During his junior year, St. Louis football was ranked as high as No. 7 nationally by USA Today. He was also a teammate of former New Orleans Saints/Chicago Bears center Olin Kreutz, former Pittsburgh Steelers running back Chris Fuamatu-Maafala and former Carolina Panthers defensive tackle Vili Maumau. At St. Louis School, Zinsman and four of his teammates formed a vocal a cappella group called \\"The Soulmates\\" which would go on to win \\"Brown Bags To Stardom\\", Hawaii's biggest and most prestigious high school talent contest, in his junior and senior years. During his second year, Zinsman also won 2nd place as a solo artist. As a senior, Zinsman earned a football scholarship to Arizona Western College (Yuma, Az.) He transferred to Foothill College (Los Altos, Ca.) in 1995, where he met future \\"Three Plus\\" bandmate Tanoa Kapana. At Foothill, both Kapana and Zinsman were JC Gridwire All-West Coast Conference offensive line football selections. Zinsman also attended Menlo College (Atherton, Ca.) for a brief period of time before receiving a football scholarship to attend NCAA Division II school West Liberty University (West Liberty, W. Va.) in 1997. Three Plus Formed in late 1998 by Zinsman, Kapana and ukulele virtuoso Marcus Malepeai (a former standout offensive lineman and All-WAC performer at the University of Hawaii 1994‚Äì95), Three Plus exploded onto the Hawaiian music scene with their 1999 debut album Honeybaby. In April 2000, Honeybaby charted at number 6 on Billboard Magazines World Music and Pacific charts. The album produced six number one singles (\\"Two Person Party\\", \\"Mystic Man\\", \\"Honeybaby\\", \\"Driving Me Pupule\\", \\"Don't Have To Think Twice\\" and \\"Cool Operator\\"). In 2000, the album was also nominated for two Na Hoku Hanohano Awards (Hawaii's equivalent to 'The Grammys'), for Most Promising Artist and Island Contemporary Album of The Year. Soon thereafter, with sponsorships by Miller Lite, Da Hui, Young Ukulele's and Butigroove Clothing, Three Plus embarked on their \\"Honeybaby\\" tour through California, Oregon, Nevada, Washington, Colorado, Arizona, Guam and Saipan, as well as the Hawaiian islands, for over three years to promote the album. The title song \\"Honeybaby\\", written by Zinsman and Kapana, was featured in the original theatrical version of the Farrelly Brothers 2001 hit comedy movie Shallow Hal, starring Jack Black and Gwyneth Paltrow. The song is also featured in the 2012 biographical surfing film Chasing Mavericks, starring Gerard Butler. The movie details the life and death of American surfer Jay Moriarity, an accomplished soul surfer and waterman from Santa Cruz, California. In 2001, \\"Three Plus\\" recorded the single \\"Crusin' \\", written by Hawaii recording artist Glen Medeiros, for the soundtrack of the T.V. series Baywatch Hawaii. Also in 2001, Three Plus were featured as guest artists on Spread A Little Aloha, the four-time Na Hoku Hanohano award-winning album by The Mana'o Company, as well as the two-time Na Hoku Hanohano award- winning album Portraits by Ernie Cruz Jr. Three Plus are also mentioned in the November 26, 2001, issue of ESPN Magazine under the article entitled \\"Rockstar\\", a featured story about 6 ft 4 in, 363 lb. fellow Polynesian and former Nebraska Cornhusker-San Diego Chargers offensive guard Toniu Fonoti. On February 16, 2002, Three Plus performed as the opening act for the final show of Janet Jackson's \\"All For You Tour\\" at Aloha Stadium before a crowd of 32,000 people. The concert also featured a special appearance by hip hop performer Missy Elliott on the song \\"Son of A Gun\\". The concert was broadcast live on HBO the following day on February 17, 2002 and attracted 4.4 million viewers. The concert was released as a 2-disk DVD package entitled Janet Jackson - Live in Hawaii on September 3, 2002 and was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing for a Miniseries. Over the years, Three Plus has performed alongside some of the most renowned and top reggae music acts in the world, including: Maxi Priest, Shaggy, Inner Circle, Morgan Heritage, Third World (band) and Messenjah. On February 19, 2002, \\"Three Plus\\" released their second album, entitled For You, which was another commercial success, winning the 2003 Na Hoku Hanohano Award for Reggae Album of The Year.Hi-Town: About This Artist. reverbnation.com, 2010. Retrieved June 28, 2011. In March 2002, For You debuted at number 3 on Billboard Magazines World Music and Pacific charts (the highest placement by an artist from Hawaii on this respective chart since Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's 2001 number 1 chart position with Alone in Iz World), as well as charting at No. 45 on its Independent Label charts. The album featured more number one hit singles like (\\"Undercover Lover\\", \\"Jah Music\\", \\"Do What Lovers Do\\" and \\"Love To Love You\\") and prompted another few years of touring for the band to promote the album. In December 2002, \\"Three Plus\\" performed at the Monterey County Fairgrounds in Monterey, California to a crowd of over 10,000. 'The Fairgrounds' is best known for hosting the annual Monterey Pop Festival, which embodies the themes of California as a focal point for the counterculture. It is also the event and venue which popularized artists like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Ravi Shankar and The Who in America, and launched the beginnings of the 1967 \\"Summer of Love\\". Due to their large population of Pacific Islanders, Polynesians and \\"transplanted\\" Native Hawaiians (people of Hawaiian ancestry or former Hawaii residents that now live on the U.S. Mainland), \\"Three Plus\\" has become enormously popular among the states along the West Coast of the United States. In 2010, Three Plus's version of Bob Marley's 1978 hit song \\"Is This Love\\", performed by Zinsman, was featured on the compilation album Putamayo Presents: \\"A Tribute To A Reggae Legend: Bob Marley\\".http://www.staradvertiser.com/features/20100723_5_Things_We_Love.html The album, released in the Netherlands, is currently available in 10 different countries and has sold close 200,000 copies to date. In 2009, the song \\"Shade On Me\\" was featured on several episodes of the A&E; Network's television show Parking Wars, which is syndicated in five different countries. Most of their music are still in heavy rotation on a variety of radio stations across the states of Hawaii, Nevada, California as well as Guam, Tahiti, New Zealand and Japan. However, in 2007 Zinsman left the group to pursue other endeavors and re-located to the Big Island of Hawaii. Hi-Town Upon relocating, Zinsman decided to take a lesser \\"up front\\" role as an artist and focused more on producing, managing and developing other acts. In 2008, he formed the island reggae music sextet Hi-Town (short for Hilo town) and in 2010 they released their self-entitled debut album to rave reviews. Produced by Zinsman, the Hi- Town album would go on to win the 2010 Hawaii Music Award for Island Contemporary Album of The Year, as well as produce five number one singles, (\\"You're Beautiful\\", \\"All We Need\\", \\"Run & Hide\\" ft. O-Shen & Damon Williams, \\"He Come, He Go\\" and \\"Lose Your Love\\"). On August 12, 2010, \\"Hi-Town\\" released a follow up single to their debut album entitled \\"With You\\". The single obtained moderate success on local radio stations in Hawaii, peaking at No. 2 on some charts. Their single \\"Sunshine in My Life\\" is featured on the Las Vegas, Nevada based radio station, Pipeline 2 Paradise: Paradise Pa'ina Vol.1 CD Compilation. The Brown Boys The Brown Boys perform in the Island Contemporary/ Country Music genre and are currently based out of Puna, Hawaii. The group released their debut single \\"Kalapana Way\\" on August 1, 2014 to help push the release of their upcoming album. The up tempo \\"hapa-haole\\" single, which speaks of the humble way of life residents live in the peaceful community of Kalapana, Hawaii; charted respectably well on most statewide radio stations and continues to be in heavy rotation. The Brown Boys released their self-entitled debut album on June 15, 2015. The album features 7 original tracks and an array of talented guest musicians from the Big Island of Hawaii. Their single \\"Riding The World\\", written by Zinsman, was featured on an episode of Hawaii Five-0. The Brown Boys have been a staple of the island music scene on The Big Island for over 8 years performing at all major events, concerts and club venues; even sharing the stage with Rock and Roll Hall of Fame legend Neil Young at his home in Puako, Hawaii. Their second single \\"You're All I Need\\" charted on several radio stations across the Hawaiian Islands earning the No. 1 spot Aug.-Oct.2015. Personal life Zinsman currently resides in Kea'au, Hawai'i with his wife and children.

Built in 1965, she was the last of their vessels designed with two classes of passenger accommodation and the fifth company vessel to bear the name. She operated until 1984 and was broken up in 1989. History Ben-my-Chree is launched at Birkenhead, Friday, 10 December 1965 Ben-my-Chree (No.186355) was constructed by Cammell Laird at a cost of ¬£1,400,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). She was the second of four car ferries ordered by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company and was virtually identical to her sister , built four years earlier. She was launched by Mrs Margaret Brownsdon on Friday, 10 December 1965, and entered service, having gone through her trials and been accepted, with Capt J.E. Quirk in command and J.S. Kennaugh as Chief Officer. Ben-my-Chree made her maiden voyage from Liverpool to Douglas on Thursday, 12 May 1966. This was a happy occasion for the Steam Packet, for as the \\"Ben\\" slipped away from the Prince's Landing Stage and proceeded downstream towards the sea, she received a rousing salute from her sister Manx Maid, lying alongside the Liverpool terminal. The IOMSPCo Ltd's attitude and relationship with the Isle of Man Harbour Board bore significantly in the construction of the Manx Maid and Ben- My-Chree, as they were unable to agree to the building of, and who would pay the costs of linkspans required for a new RO-RO. However, it did result in a unique design that served the Isle of Man very successfully till the demise of the in 2005. Ultimately what scrapped these beautiful streamlined, whilst archaic ships, was not their inability, more their lack of efficiency as the economy of operating turbine steamers was eclipsed by motor vessels. Their nicknames by Steam Packet staff for both the \\"Maid\\" and the \\"Ben\\" in the 1960s and 1970s were \\"the money boxes\\", as they gained the Steam Packet all its profits through the carriage of cars and vans. Layout Ben-my-Chree was the last of the Company's ships designed with two classes of passenger accommodation.Connery Chappell. - Island Lifeline (1980) p64. She only operated in this configuration until the beginning of 1967, when all the Company's ships, including Ben-my-Chree, were converted to single class. The two-class system had been employed for 136 years.Connery Chappell. - Island Lifeline (1980) p64. Length 325'; beam 50'; and a depth of 18'; with accommodation for 1400 passengers and a crew of 60. Ben-my-Chree had a Gross tonnage of 2762 and a designed service speed of 21 knots. The machinery lay- out was similar to , developing shaft horse power. During her annual overhaul in 1978, she was fitted with a bow thruster, driven by a steam turbine of 500 brake horse power. Also at this time, she was fitted with the ship's whistle from the scrapped , a traditional organ type whistle, whose mighty reverberation was very much appreciated by lovers of Manx ships. Service life Mersey, as (right) greets her new sister Ben-my-Chree (left) as she departs on her maiden voyage to Douglas, Thursday May 12th, 1966. \\"The Ben\\", as she was always known, entered service in 1966, the year of the seaman's strike. This resulted in her being laid up for the first part of the summer. She serviced the main Douglas-Liverpool route on her own for part of April 1975 while was having her annual overhaul, and was forced to be idle through an industrial dispute. She was generally the winter boat i.e. out of Douglas at 09:00, and back at 10:30 from Liverpool the following day until the entered service. The winter job, and the boat that did it was sought after by the ratings, as they earned more sailing than when laid up. Disposal Ben-my- Chree at East Float, Wallasey Docks. During the early 1980s, as a result of the formation of Manxline with its RO-RO vessel , the side-loading car ferries of the Steam Packet were seen as becoming increasingly inefficient, and the decision was made to retire both the Manx Maid and the Ben-my-Chree. Whilst their higher fuel consumption would initially be seen as the cost to dispose, the reality was the steam plants were very expensive to maintain, and just not as efficient. The Steamers averaged 9 tons of fuel on a Douglas - Liverpool trip whilst the motor ships and less than 4. A 30% price increase in heavy- grade fuel oil during 1984, finally rendered the vessels as totally uneconomic.Steam Packet 175 (Manxline and the Merger, Chapter 9, p.78) Ben-my- Chree made her final voyage under Steam Packet ownership on 19 September 1984, ten days after her older sister. However, this wasn't quite the end for her, and in June 1985 she was chartered back from her new owners to cover the shortfall in capacity for the busy TT motorcycle races. Ben-my-Chree was finally laid up by Capt. Hall in Vittoria Dock, Birkenhead, on 10 June 1985. In August 1989, she was sold to Spanish breakers Cantabra Metalurgica S.A.

Loyalists. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. p.114 Although Andy Tyrie was the UDA's commander, there was intense rivalry between Herron and former UDA leader (and the organisation's founder), Charles Harding Smith. Upon Herron's killing, McCormick was appointed to succeed him as leader of the East Belfast Brigade. He was viewed as a disciplinarian with a bland, colourless personality. This suited the UDA leadership who felt that he presented a staid, responsible image in direct contrast to the flamboyantly corrupt Herron.McDonald, Henry & Cusack, Jim (2004): UDA - Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror. Dublin: Penguin Ireland. p.68 He was a loyal supporter of Tyrie and when Harding Smith placed Tyrie under house arrest in his Glencairn home McCormick arranged for the UDA Chairman to be moved across Belfast to a new house in the east of the city.Steve Bruce, The Red Hand, Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 105 His tenure as brigadier got off to an uneasy start. In February 1974, following UDA colonel Ned McCreery's release from internment, there was a raucous celebration held by him and his supporters which immediately escalated into a riot. The volatile McCreery and his men waged a gun battle in the streets of east Belfast against the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and British Army, resulting in the deaths of two men. One of the dead men, civilian Gary Reid, was a cousin of footballer George Best.McDonald, Henry & Cusack, Jim (2004). UDA - Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror.

He soon restored order from the earlier mayhem, and under his stern command, the formerly chaotic brigade became one of the most disciplined units in the entire UDA.

The two popular varieties of limes grown in Mexico are the Mexican or Key lime (Citrus aurantifolia) and the Persian lime (Citrus latifolia, simply called \\"lime\\" in the US); the former is of Indo‚ÄìMalayan origin introduced in Mexico by the Spaniards after the 1520s, while the latter, also called the Tahiti lime, was introduced from the United States. Persian lime production in Mexico caters specifically to the US market; a substantial increase in production has been attributed to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Lime production in Mexico has also expanded consequent to the increase in its per capita consumption in the United States and the European Union (EU). Geographical distribution Most limes are grown in the warmer southwest (60% of total) and southeast of the country (40%). Key limes amount to about 54% of the total lime production, and are grown in the southwestern states of Jalisco, Colima, Michoac√°n, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. Persian limes, about 42% of the lime production, are grown in Jalisco, Colima, Hidalgo, in micro-climates in northern Veracruz, and in the southeastern states of Tlaxcala, Chiapas, Tabasco and the Yucatan. The most important lime producing states are Michoac√°n and Colima. Characteristics of limes grown in Mexico = Key lime = The Key lime tree (also referred to in the vernacular as the ‚ÄúMexican lime‚Äù) is a slender tree which grows to heights of , bears scentless flowers (with white stems and yellow anthers) that mature into fruits, singly, in pairs or in larger clusters. The fruit, which is generally in diameter, as it ripens, changes its peel color from green to pale-yellow. The greenish-yellow pulp of the fruit, with its inseparable 6‚Äì15 segments, is juicy and highly acidic with flavor and aroma. It has either a few or many small seeds. Though the climatic conditions under which the Key lime thrives is moist, with annual precipitation in the range of the tree is more capable of enduring drought conditions than other citrus fruit varieties. However, in excessive rainfall, trees may be infected with fungus. The Key lime is also more sensitive to cold than the lemon, and can be grown only in protected locations. The Key lime has a longer shelf life than other limes, which is useful since refrigeration facilities are lacking in the country. The tree species of Indo-Malayan region was introduced to Mexico by Spanish Conquistadors after 1520. Now, 2,000,000 seedling trees are reported near Colima. However, there are very few varieties of the Key lime, except for several spineless selections, inasmuch as there is no great variation in the wild or under cultivation. =Persian lime= Persian lime (Citrus latifolia) Persian limes are larger and contain more juice than Key limes. It is an acid lime which has been developed in recent times. Its origin is inferred as a hybrid of the Key lime and citron. The Persian or Tahiti lime tree grows to height, with broad lanceolate leaves and slightly purple-tinged flowers (with no viable pollen) mostly in January. The fruit has vivid green peel till it ripens to pale-yellow. Its pulp with 10 segments of light greenish-yellow color is normally seedless. Production The biggest focus of Mexican citrus production is on Key limes; in 2003, Mexico produced 768,000 tonnes of Key limes and 235,000 tonnes of Persian limes. For the 2010/11 season, Mexico forecasts that it will produce a total of 1.9 million tonnes of limes. The largest importers of lime oil are the US, UK, Japan, Ireland and Belgium. In recent years, the Persian lime industry has taken off in Veracruz, dominated by large-scale producers, with over 25% of limes being produced using micro-jet irrigation or other irrigation systems, year-round in micro-climates. Transportation costs from Veracruz to the US border are reported to be approximately 11,500 pesos (US$912.69) per trailer, depending on fuel prices.

Thomsen who insisted on accuracy and detail, qualities which are reflected in his own work. As a result, Holm quickly became a master of his genre, not only as an illustrator but in the difficult technique of watercolour painting. He began to specialize in illustrating prospectuses, often sketching areas and buildings of interest before making multiple copies at home, often with minor variations. He sometimes produced skeleton drawings which he later coloured with watercolour. His subjects were taken mainly from the streets and squares of Copenhagen, comprising castles and churches, the stock exchange, the university, as well as views of the city from vantage points such as Rundet√•rn. In addition, he produced a series of works covering the surrounding countryside, for example the collection Sj√¶llands yndigste Egne (1826‚Äì28). Many of his plates appeared in magazines such as Magazin for Ungdommen (1839‚Äì40), its successor Cosmorama (1840‚Äì43), and Nyt Magazin for Natur og Menneskekundskab (1848). He also illustrated prospectuses for the Royal Procelain Factory, especially in regard to designs for tea and coffee cups. Despite Holm's high rate of productivity, he constantly suffered from lack of money, which frequently drove him to drink. The resulting vicious circle encouraged him to sell his works at low prices which explains how he was given the nickname: Fattigholm or \\"Poor Holm\\".John Erichsen, \\"H.G.F. Holm\\", Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbachs Kunstleksikon. Retrieved 16 June 2011. Works Holm's many small works continue to be of considerable value. They are of great topographical and cultural interest as they provide one of the best representations of Golden Age Copenhagen, both in terms of the city as a whole and its individual buildings, including life in the streets. In addition, thanks to their high technical quality and his sense of colour, his watercolours are of high artistic quality.

It especially highlights prisoners sent from urban areas to be incarcerated in rural supermax prisons, such as Red Onion State Prison and Wallens Ridge State Prison. The film delves into issues of parole reform, prisoner abuse, and prisoner suicide. Up the Ridge was created as a part of the Thousand Kites project, a nonprofit organization aimed at exacting prison reform through narrative means. (Kite is prison slang for sending a message) In 1998, Szuberla was a volunteer DJ for a hip-hop show \\"Lights Out\\" on WMMT, an Appalachian region radio station when he received hundreds of letters from inmates transferred into nearby Wallens Ridge State Prison, the region's newest prison, built to prop up the shrinking coal economy. The letters described human rights violations and racial tension between prisoner staff and inmates. Filming began that year. Through the example of Wallens Ridge State Prison, the documentary explores the United States prison industry and the social impact of moving hundreds of thousands of inner-city minority offenders to distant rural outposts. The film displays competing political agendas that seem to align government policy with human rights violations, and political expediencies that bring communities into racial and cultural conflict, sometimes with prisoner suicide and prisoner abuse as consequences. Connections exist, in both practice and ideology, between human rights violations in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and physical and psychological abuse recorded in U.S. prisons.

From 1908 to 1922 this vessel was named Bainbridge. Design and construction Bainbridge as built. Speeder was built in 1908 at Seattle, Washington for the Eagle Harbor Transportation Company The original name of the vessel was Bainbridge.Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at page 151. As originally built, the vessel was long, beam, and in depth of hold. Overall size was 39 gross and 26 registered tons. Only two crew were required according to the 1911 merchant vessel registry. As of 1911, the vessel was powered with a gasoline engine that generated 80 indicated horsepower. The vessel's U.S. Registry number was 205199.U.S. Dept. of the Treasury, Bureau of Statistics, Annual List of Merchant Vessels of the United States (for year ending June 30, 1911) (accessed 06-16-11). Bainbridge was built to run on the Seattle-Bainbridge Island route and was the fastest vessel of the type yet constructed when built. Career In 1910 Bainbridge was purchased by the Puget Sound Navigation Company. PSN was then engaged in a strong competition with the Kitsap County Transportation Company, which had deployed a similar vessel, the gasoline launch Doncella to run against Bainbridge. There was a near-collision between the two vessels off Duwamish Head, in which, it was reported at the time that ‚Äú'women fainted in fright.'‚Äù As a result of this incident, charges were brought against Capt. Carl Freese of the Bainbridge and Capt. George W. Keeney of Doncella.Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at pages 175 and 176. In 1911 the original gasoline engine was replaced with a new 75 horsepower Troyer-Fox gasoline engine assembled by the Astoria Iron Works, of Astoria, Oregon.Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at page 161. In 1922, Captain Norman I. Drigge, of Friday Harbor, Washington had Bainbridge rebuilt at the Jensen shipyard in Friday Harbor. He renamed the vessel Speeder. A 90-horsepower Gulwosen-Grei diesel engine was installed, and the rebuilt vessel had two smoke stacks. Following reconstruction, the vessel was long and had a passenger capacity of 100 persons. Under Driggs, Speeder was run between Bellingham and Anacortes, Washington by way of points in the San Juan Islands, including Deer Harbor, Orcas, Shaw Island, and Friday Harbor.Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at page 326. In 1924, Speeder with other motor launches, including Alverene were running in the San Juan Islands, and facing heavy competition from the powerful Crosby Marine Corporation, which had placed the ferry Mount Vernon on the San Juan route. Speeder was later operated on the Bellingham-San Juan Islands by the W.H. Kasch Navigation Co., owners of Alverene.Kline and Bayless, Ferryboats ‚Äì A Legend on Puget Sound, at page 133. In 1927, Speeder was back in the ownership of Eagle Harbor Transportation Company, whose principals then were E.L. Frank and J.B. Burns. In that year, Franks and Burns sold their two vessels,Speeder and the steamer Bainbridge to Kitsap County Transportation Company through an intermediary, Arthur E. Burr. Kitsap County Navigation Company was then under the control of John L. Anderson, whose wish to acquire the state-issued route certificate held by Eagle Harbor Transportation Co. was the motive for the purchase. E.L. Frank stayed on as chief engineer of the Bainbridge after the ownership transfer.Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at page 388.Kline and Bayless, Ferryboats ‚Äì A Legend on Puget Sound, at page 166. KCTC put Speeder on the Seattle-Winslow route. Later years Speeder with modified cabin structure, 1942 or later. In 1935 Speeder came into the ownership of Puget Sound Navigation Co. when PSN acquired Kitsap County Transportation Co. and the entire KCTC fleet. Speeder was not operated by PSN however, and seems to have been idle for a number of years following the purchase.Kline and Bayless, Ferryboats ‚Äì A Legend on Puget Sound, at page 353. In 1942, Speeder was acquired by Boles Harbor Island Ferries. The cabins of the vessel were cut down and the vessel was then and placed on a route running shipyard workers from downtown Seattle to the yards on Harbor Island. Master of the vessel in this service was Joe D. Williamson, who later became known as a prominent maritime photographer.Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at page 510. It is also reported that Speeder made runs to Bremerton during this period.Newell and Williamson, Pacific Steamboats, at page 104. As of 1966, Speeder was still operational, and was then owned by Seattle Pacific University.

She is the winner of the 2010 and 2012 ITU Long Distance Triathlon World Championships and took second at the 2010 and 2012 Ironman World Championship. Before competing as a professional triathlete she was a member of the Lifeforce Pro Cycling Team. Career Steffen was born in Spiez and began her early competitive career as a swimmer. She enjoyed success as a swimmer competing on the Swiss junior and senior national teams and winning multiple national titles. In 2002, Steffen underwent shoulder surgery and would eventually retire from competitive swimming afterwards. After taking some time off Steffen competed in a two-day Swiss multisport competition, the Gigathlon, which reignited her desire to compete and train again. In 2006, after having completed a few Olympic distance triathlons she entered and placed second in her age group at Ironman Switzerland, posting a sub-10 hour time. She went on to compete at the 2006 Ironman World Championships in Hawai'i where she posted another sub-10 hour time and place third in her age group as an amateur. =Cycling= Steffen moved on to concentrate on bicycle racing as she was not enjoying the swim training and felt that her running was a competitive weakness. Soon she was invited to join the Raleigh Lifeforce professional team alongside Nicole Cooke and Karin Th√ºrig. After it was determined that she was too big to be a climber and not fast enough to be a sprinter, her role on the team was to set the sprinters up for the finish of races. As a professional cyclist she was showing improvement but the sport was not providing her with satisfaction. In May 2008, Steffen decided to leave the team and try her luck as a pro triathlete. =Triathlon= Soon after, Steffen was competing in Ironman competitions again. She moved to Australia and eventually quit her job to focus on triathlon training in Mooloolaba on the Sunshine Coast. Steffen began enjoying successes at the 70.3 and Ironman distances which caused her to gain the attention of coach Brett Sutton who eventually invited her to join team TBB and earning the nickname \\"Xena the Warrior Princess\\" or simply \\"Xena.\\" In 2009, Steffen took fourth place the Ironman 70.3 World Championships in Clearwater, Florida. A few months later she won her first major race, the Ironman 70.3 in Geelong in February 2010.

They are also found in overflow ponds near rivers, boggy lakes, brackish tidal waters, and ditches with weedy bottoms. They live in water with a large range of pH's, and are able to survive at low oxygen levels, displaying high levels of environmental tolerance. The water can be clear or turbid. Brassy minnows appear to do better in habitats with minimal predators, or those that have structure for them to hide in, as they are very susceptible to predation Diet habits Hybognathus hankinsoni are omnivorous eating algae, plankton and aquatic invertebrates that live in the organic sediment or the weeds that grow in their environment. Although omnivorous, the brassy minnow is typically vegetarian, mainly eating the algae, especially diatoms and desmids, found growing in the streams and ponds it inhabits. The minnows feed in schools with peak feeding times around 1-3 pm. Additionally, brassy minnows are first level consumers and are therefore important in the transfer of nutrients to higher trophic levels. Reproduction and lifecycle The brassy minnow becomes sexually active at one to two years of age. The fish spawn (biology) during the months of April through July, depending on the location. In the more northerly range of the brassy minnow, they spawn later in the year than in the south part of their range. The spawning time occurs when the water temperature reaches sixteen to seventeen degrees Celsius. They lay their legs on the vegetation and along the bottom of the streams and ponds it inhabits. A female brassy minnow can lay up to 2500 eggs, depending on her size, and usually releases the eggs over the course of a week. The eggs take about 7‚Äì10 days to hatch and the larvae grow rapidly for the first months. The brassy minnow lives up to 5 years and spawns annually. The species is considered to be globally secure, and therefore does not have any conservation concerns.

It is endemic to the United States where it occurs in the Mississippi and Ohio drainages as well as some other rivers which drain into the Gulf of Mexico. Description The Cypress minnow is a rather stout-bodied, silvery fish which had reasonable large eyes and a small, upward pointing mouth. The scales on anterior portio of the flanks have prominent dark edges which form an obvious diamond-shaped pattern. There are no barbels. There is a distinct dusky or greenish-golden strip down the centre of the yellowish-olive back, this stripe is wider than the base of the dorsal fin, the back also has emerald spots. The flanks are silvery, lacking any dusky stripe while the belly is. The fins lack any markings. The males develop tubercules over most of the body when breeding. Adults are to in length. Distribution The Cypress minnow is endemic to the United States where it is found in the Ohio and River basins from south western Indiana to southern Illinois south to Louisiana. It is also found in the Escambia River in Florida and Alabama and in the Sabine River in Texas. Habitat The Cypress minnow is a lowland species which occurs in the backwaters of large, sluggish rivers and in oxbow lakes over substrates of sand, silt and organic debris. It avoids areas with faster currents. Biology The Cypress minnow has a lengthy intestine, which loops a number of times and the length intestinal tract is suggestive of a herbivorous diet digesting plant matter. This is supported by a study in Kentucky which found that these fish consumed sand, detritus, algae and other plant materials. These fish reach sexual maturity at around a year old, at a length of to . They appear to spawn in the spring, and as in its congeners the eggs are likely that to be scattered over the substrate with no parental care of either the eggs or the young. Conservation The Cypress minnow is not common and has been described as being sporadic or rare, and to have declined drastically in abundance at the edges of its range in the states of Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma, Florida, and Arkansas. However, its historical range within most of these states was rather limited in extent. The species was collected in Indiana since the early 1940s where it is known from 4 localities and it was only recently rediscovered in Missouri and Illinois. Cypress minnows may have become extinct in the southern bend of the Tennessee River in Alabama. In the core parts of the range, recent surveys indicate that the species is apparently maintaining its populations. The population trend is uncertain but the Cypress minnow probably has a relatively stable or slowly declining population.

After some years of relative calm following the 2005 agreement which ended the second Sudanese civil war between the Sudanese government and SPLM rebels, fighting broke out again in the lead-up to South Sudan independence on 9 July 2011, starting in South Kordofan on 5 June and spreading to the neighboring Blue Nile state in September. SPLM-N, splitting from newly independent SPLM, took up arms against the inclusion of the two southern states in Sudan with no popular consultation and against the lack of democratic elections. The conflict is intertwined with the War in Darfur, since in November 2011 SPLM-N established a loose alliance with Darfuri rebels, called Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF). As of October 2014, some two million people have been affected by the conflict, with more than 500,000 having been displaced and about 250,000 of them fleeing to South Sudan and Ethiopia. In January 2015, fighting intensified as Omar al-Bashir's government tried to regain control of rebel-held territory ahead of April 2015 general elections. With the overthrow of al-Bashir in April 2019 following months of protests, the SRF announced a three-month ceasefire, hoping to facilitate a Sudanese transition to democracy. This led to the beginning of peace negotiations between the rebels and the new interim government. The Sudanese peace process was formalised with the August 2019 Draft Constitutional Declaration, signed by military and civilian representatives during the Sudanese Revolution, that mandates that a peace agreement be made in South Kordofan and Blue Nile (and in Darfur) within the first six months of the 39-month transition period to democratic civilian government. On 31 August 2020, a comprehensive peace agreement was signed in Juba, South Sudan, between the Sudan's transitional government and the Sudan Revolutionary Front. The Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu and Sudan Liberation Movement/Army led by Abdul Wahid al Nur refused to sign the agreement. An agreement was reached between the transitional government and the SPLM-North al-Hilu rebel faction on 3 September 2020 in Addis Ababa to separate religion and state and not discriminate against anyone's ethnicity in order to secure the equal treatment of all citizens of Sudan. The declaration of principles stated that 'Sudan is a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi- religious and multi-cultural society. Full recognition and accommodation of these diversities must be affirmed. (...) The state shall not establish an official religion. No citizen shall be discriminated against based on their religion.' Background Although South Kordofan and Blue Nile are north of the international border separating Sudan and South Sudan, many of their residents (particularly in the Nuba Mountains) identify with the South. Many residents fought on the side of southern rebels during the long civil war. South Kordofan and Blue Nile were not allowed to participate in the January 2011 referendum to create South Sudan, and the \\"popular consultation\\" process they were promised also failed to take place. According to satellite imagery, during early Spring 2011, Sudan elevated dirt roads needed for tank transportation in the areas they are not traditionally elevated, and in March 2011 it started deploying police and military installations in the area. =May 2011 Abyei conflict= In May 2011, ahead of South Sudan's scheduled independence, tensions rose around the status of the Abyei Area, an oil-rich region that was statutorily part of both South Kordofan and Northern Bahr el Ghazal states. As South Kordofan was slated to remain with the North while Northern Bahr el Ghazal was seceding together with the rest of what was then Southern Sudan Autonomous Region, the status of Abyei was unclear, and both Khartoum and Juba claimed the area as their own. On 19 May 2011, militants reportedly affiliated with the Sudan People's Liberation Army attacked a convoy of mixed Sudanese Army and UNMIS vehicles 10 km north of Abyei town as they withdrew from the area's administrative centre, drawing sharp condemnation from both the Sudanese government and the United Nations. At least 15 Sudanese tanks entered Abyei town on 20 May, beginning large-scale fighting in Abyei. By 22 May, the Sudanese military had seized control of the town, and most of Abyei's residents had fled south toward Bahr el Ghazal. Both the Sudanese government and the government of Southern Sudan accused one another of violating the terms of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. In June 2011, an African Union panel headed by former South African president Thabo Mbeki tried to de-escalate the situation through north‚Äìsouth talks in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. On 20 June, the parties agreed to demilitarize the contested area of Abyei, and UN peacekeepers were deployed as part of United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei on 27 June. The agreement details the mechanism by which the Abyei administration council to replace the one dissolved by president Omer Hassan al-Bashir in May 2011. Its chief shall be picked by the SPLM but must be approved by the Northern National Congress Party (NCP). The deputy however, would be nominated by the NCP and endorsed by SPLM. Three of the five heads of the departments of the administrative council would be nominated by the SPLM and the remaining two by the NCP. A police service would be established for the region, with the size and composition determined by a joint committee co-chaired by northern and southern officials. The US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon welcomed the accord but said the real test would be how both sides would implement the deal. On 21 June, a statement was attributed to the NCP's official in charge of Abyei file, Didiri Mohamed Ahmed, as saying that there was an understanding reached at the Addis Ababa meeting between the two parties that South Sudan would concede future ownership of Abyei to the North. However, the spokesman of SPLA, Philip Aguer, told the press that the statement from the NCP senior official was incorrect.  Conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile =2011= June On 5 June 2011, armed conflict broke out between the government of Sudan and Sudan People's Liberation Movement (northern sector) in broader South Kordofan state, ahead of the scheduled independence of the South on 9 July. The Northern army said that SPLA launched an attack on a police station and stole weapons prompting a response. The SPLA claimed that the Northern army attempted to disarm their units by force. That day JEM rebels claimed to have destroyed an army camp in the area of Jama, South Kordofan, killing 38 soldiers and wounding other 27. On 14 June, the UN accused the Sudanese government of carrying out an \\"intensive bombing campaign\\" near the north‚Äìsouth border which has led to \\"huge suffering\\" for civilians in South Kordofan. Some 140,000 people have fled the fighting. Aid agency offices have been looted, churches have been ransacked and buildings destroyed. Aid workers say that ethnic Nubans are being targeted by the northern military and Arab militias. This was denied by Rabbie Abdelattif Ebaid, an adviser to Sudan's information minister, who said that only rebel fighters were being targeted. On 15 June, US President Barack Obama called for a ceasefire urging both the North and South to \\"live up to their responsibilities\\" to prevent a return to civil war. The head of the worldwide Anglican church, Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams said: \\"The humanitarian challenge is already great, and the risk of another Darfur situation, with civilian populations at the mercy of government-supported terror, is a real one\\". On 19 June, Sudanese president Omer Hassan al-Bashir accused the SPLM-N of \\"betrayal\\" in South Kordofan. \\"If they want war...we will show them practically like what happened in Abyei and South Kordofan\\" Bashir said. \\"It is better that they [SPLM-N] come to us in good terms and we will be better than them,\\" he added. The Northern Army said that it would continue its military campaign in South Kordofan, which included aerial bombardment, until it crushes the rebellion led by former deputy governor and leading SPLM-N figure Abdelaziz al-Hilu. Fighting intensified around the state capital of Kadugli. July‚ÄìAugust On 6 July JEM field commander announced that his forces were able to defeat an army battalion in a field near Heglieg, comprising fifty four members, arranged a trap for the army battalion, which was composed of nine Land Cruiser cars. The head of the battalion was killed, along with two other soldiers. On 11 July, clashes were reported in Fula, South Kordofan. Sudanese Federal National Front claimed that their forces killed 20 government troops, and destroyed four of the seven Landcruisers, that carried the government troops. Their spokesman said that they also seized fire arms and ammunition. The remainder of the government troops fled. Fighting continued after South Sudan gained independence on 9 July, though the Sudanese government insisted that order had been restored in South Kordofan proper. A UN report leaked on 18 July documented alleged war crimes in South Kordofan, blaming both sides but reserving many of its heaviest accusations for the Sudanese government. The following day, UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Valerie Amos called for an independent investigation into atrocities possibly committed during the conflict. Amos said the government of Sudan should lift its restrictions on access to the region. The alleged human rights abuses include \\"forced disappearances, targeting of UN staff and summary executions.\\" Joint SPLM-N and JEM forces defeated government forces from 10‚Äì17 July in the Nuba Mountains. An army garrison in Al-Tais was captured by rebels. By the end, 150 government soldiers and 1 rebel were killed, considerable numbers of weaponry including light and heavy machine guns and artilleries, RBJ, AK47 and anti air craft missiles were captured by rebels. Also 3 rebels were captured. However, a JEM leader among the militants captured was later sentenced to death by hanging, state-run media reported on 27 August. Around the same time, the Sudan Tribune reported that the SPLM-N, the JEM, and the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) had formed a tentative alliance to resist the federal government in Khartoum. September‚ÄìDecember On 1 September, SPLM-N rebels in South Kordofan claimed the military was deliberately destroying crops and farms belonging to the Nuba people in an attempt to starve the state into submission. Meanwhile, state-run media claimed SPLM-N guerrillas killed 17 civilians, including children, and wounded 14 in the Kalugi region of South Kordofan the same day. On 7 September, clashes between Abdel Wahid's Sudan Liberation Army and Sudanese army were reported in Jebel Marra, rebels claimed to have killed 40 government soldiers and captured six of their vehicles. Three rebels were killed and another four were wounded. A spokesman for the Sudanese military said that SPLM-N militants attacked army positions in Ad- Damazin, the capital of Blue Nile state, late on 1 September. Governor Malik Agar disputed this account, saying the army attacked Blue Nile state institutions first, including his official residence. The military quickly took control of Ad-Damazin, and Khartoum sacked Agar and replaced him with a military governor. Agar and his allies regrouped in southern Blue Nile. On 2 September, the federal government declared a state of emergency in the state. The Sudanese Air Force reportedly carried out strike missions, bombing SPLM-N villages and towns. The SPLM-N claimed four civilians were killed in an aerial bombing of Kormok. By 22 September, the SPLM-N claimed victory in several battlefields (in the areas of Ibri, locality of Dlami; Angrto, locality of Talodi and Abolhassan, in the locality of Cdarno) killing 25 soldiers and militias belonging to the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and captured several soldiers and weapons. Some degree of notoriety was accorded to the SPLM-N's use of Rick Derringer's \\"Rock 'n' Roll Hoochie Koo\\" as something of a battle anthem during the 2011 violence. The SPLM-N's Darfuri allies, the JEM and the SLM, issued a joint statement on 4 September condemning the Sudanese military's use of force against the SPLM-N in Blue Nile, calling it a plot to spread \\"chaos and killing\\" across the country. They also called on the United Nations Security Council to impose a no-fly zone over Blue Nile, Darfur, and South Kordofan. Helicopters, Antonov An-26s, MiG-29s and other aircraft at El Obeid Airbase where the SAF are believed to be attacking from. The Sudanese military claimed on 10 September to have broken an SPLM-N \\"siege\\" of Qiessan, near the Ethiopian border, and evacuated its wounded from the town, though it was unclear whether they took control of Qiessan outright or just escaped from the area. Both Agar and Yahia Mohamed Kheir, the military governor appointed by Bashir, claimed control of 80 percent of Blue Nile state. Meanwhile, the Sudanese government said 5,000 people had fled their homes in Blue Nile as a result of the fighting, and Information Minister Sana Hamad al-Awad claimed it had proof the South Sudanese government was paying the salaries of SPLM-N fighters across the border. By 3 October, SPLM-N forces clashed with Sudanese army in South Kordofan killing 47 army members, including three well-known militia leaders and cinjuring 23 more. On 9 October, SPLM-N rebels ambushed government soldiers in Khor Adrak in Blue Nile, killing 30 of them and destroying three army vehicles and capturing another one. The Sudanese military seized control of Kurmuk, the former stronghold of the SPLM-N in Blue Nile state, on 2 November. President Omar al-Bashir visited the town four days later to declare it \\"liberated\\". He also threatened South Sudan with war, accusing it of supporting the SPLM-N in its anti-government activities.

Two Antonov makeshift bombers were seen leaving the area. They were said to have dropped five bombs, four detonating. The local official Miabek Lang said at least 12 people had been killed and 20 wounded during the strike. The Sudanese government has denied the claims. Darfuri factions and the SPLM-N in Blue Nile and South Kordofan states announced the formation of an alliance called the Sudanese Revolutionary Front on 12 November. The stated goal of the coalition is to overthrow the Bashir government and install a democratic system in Sudan. On 23 November, SLA-AW forces clashed with SAF forces in North Darfur's Kabkabiya region and taking over 10 Land Cruisers loaded with guns in addition to capturing three soldiers, one of the rank of a sergeant. 35 army soldiers were killed in the clashes. Rebels claimed the victory on the battlefield. The Sudanese Armed forces said they managed on 5 of December to defeat the rebels of the SPLA in South Kordofan's region of Lake Alubaid, where the armed forces seized the head of division nine in all its three camps. The Sudan People's Liberation Movement however strongly denied this happening, and asserted in return that it had destroyed a whole unit of militias affiliated to the National Congress Party and its armed forces near the city Toroj, killing 60 of the Sudanese army and militia and destroying 3 armored vehicles. They also stated that they took over armored vehicles and artillery guns with a number of ammunition and fuel. On 9 December, SAF and SPLM-N rebels claimed victory (both) in South Kordofan battle. Rebels claimed to have killed 40 Abu Tira soldiers (pro-government), including the head of the team. They also said that three Land Cruiser cars loaded with guns were destroyed; three artilleries and tens of light weapons, including RBG 7 and BKM machine guns were taken over. They also claimed to have dispersed militias of the National Congress Party (NCP) under the head of Kafi Tayar who attacked Dalkoma, ten kilometers south of Kadugli, resulting in the death of nine. SPLM-N fighters in South Kordofan reported turning back Sudanese army elements attempting to dislodge them from positions in Warni on 10 December, as well as the capture of the localities of Abu al-Hassan and al-Rashad three days earlier. The battles left 19 dead, a spokesman for the rebel group claimed. By 12 December, fighting had shifted to Taruje, near the international border with South Sudan. In a related skirmish, South Sudanese and Sudanese regular divisions clashed at Jau, a disputed town on the border, in what a Sudanese army spokesman described as a victory for Khartoum's soldiers. On 21 and 22 December, students began protesting at the University of Khartoum and the Red Sea University in a flare-up of anti-government protests that began in January. A number of Darfuri students at the Red Sea University threatened to leave in protest after several student leaders were arrested late on 21 December, and by 25 December, they had declared their allegiance to the Sudan Revolutionary Front and were calling for the overthrow of the Sudanese government. Several students at the University of Khartoum, including at least one Darfuri student association head, were taken into custody by security troops on 22 December after a multiethnic protest against the Merowe Dam in solidarity with the Manasir facing displacement as a result of its construction. The students in Khartoum also began agitating for the government's ouster on 24 December, following the clashes and arrests on campus two days earlier. On 25 December, Justice and Equality Movement leader Khalil Ibrahim was intercepted and killed along with 30 of his fighters in North Kordofan, west of Wad Banda. Sudanese state media reported Ibrahim was defeated in fighting with the army. JEM confirmed Ibrahim's death, but said he had been killed by an airstrike, not in combat with Sudanese ground troops. Ibrahim's death came one day after JEM fighters struck three villages in the state. =2012= January‚ÄìApril By early January, reports of malnutrition and hunger increased in the conflict-afflicted zones. According to the United Nations, close to 417,000 people had been displaced, including 80,000 who fled to South Sudan. By 20 January, heavy clashes broke out in Blue Nile state between SAF and SPLM-N. Rebels claimed to have destroyed an army helicopter that was trying to rescue some troops. In the clashes 26 soldiers and 7 rebels were killed. Also 6 rebels were wounded. In the 1 February, clashes between Justice and Equality Movement soldiers and a group of armed Arab citizens in East Darfur left 3 rebels killed, the attacks occurred as a response to repeated violations by JEM in the area. On 22 February, SLM-MM forces killed 12 government soldiers and took control of the Alawna area, in Dar El Salaam locality, south of El Fasher, in North Darfur.

On 26 February, rebels from the recently formed Sudan Revolutionary Front claimed to have killed up to 130 Sudanese soldiers in an attack on a Sudanese army garrison around Lake Obyad, near the border with South Sudan. South Sudan accused the north of bombing two Southern oil wells using its air force on 1 March, destroying both structures, allegations the north denied. The incident raised fears that war could break out between the two countries. During this, in the 6 of this month, JEM rebels and Sudanese army clashed in North Darfur. The JEM claimed to beat and killed soldiers, and destroyed vehicles and weapons belonging to government troops. On 26 March, the Sudanese air force bombed areas of Unity state in South Sudan, and sent army and militia forces across the border.

On 8 December 2014, clashes between militants and government forces clashed in South Kordofan. On 9 December 2014, Sudanese authorities declared that ceasefire negotiations with the rebels have ended without a positive result. The reason behind the failure was the demand by rebels to conduct joint negotiations with the rebels in Darfur. A week earlier a big number of opposition parties signed a unity agreement with SPLM-N in order to support it in the negotiations. On 12 December 2014, SPLA-N insurgents captured the al-Daldako and Ruseiris and Jabal Nimir areas of South Kordofan.

The ceasefire was later extended in October to the end of the year and then on December 31, it was extended again by a whole month =2017= On January 16, 2017, Omar Al-Bashir extended the ceasefire by 6 months On February 21, 2017, Sudan attacked SPLM-N positions in the area of the town of Kadugli, violating the ceasefire. =2018= =2019= On 11 April 2019, amid weeks of demonstrations and ongoing protests in the capital of Khartoum, Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir was removed from power in a coup d'√©tat by the Sudanese Armed Forces after nearly 30 years in office. Vice president and defense minister Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf dissolved the government of al-Bashir and formed a military council to run the country. On 17 April 2019, SPLM-N announced a suspension of hostilities in South Kordofan and Blue Nile state. The leader of SPLM-N, Abdulaziz al-Hilu, said in a statement released by the armed group, ‚ÄúAs a goodwill gesture ‚Ä¶ to give a chance for an immediate transfer of power to civilians, I, commander of SPLM-N announce the suspending of hostilities for three months in all areas under its control until July 31, 2019.‚Äù Two weeks after the ouster of Sudan's Omar Al Bashir, Uganda's foreign minister Okello Oryem, has announced that his country may offer Bashir refuge. =2020= On 31 August 2020, a comprehensive peace agreement was signed in Juba, South Sudan, between the Sudan's transitional government and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF), except for Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM‚ÄìN) led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu and Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM) led by Abdul Wahid al Nur.

On 3 October 2020, another peace deal was signed by the SRF, SPLM‚ÄìN led by Malik Agar, SLM led by Minni Minnawi and the Sudanese government, with the absence of both al Nur and al-Hilu.  Human rights  = Ahmed Haron = Sometime during March an undated video emerged of the Governor of South Kordofan Ahmed Haroun telling Sudanese soldiers: \\"You must hand over the place clean. Rub it, crush it and sweep it. Don't bring them [Rebels] back alive. We have no space for them\\". An army commander standing near Haroun then says: \\"Don't bring them back, eat them alive\\" amid laughter by the group in the video. Haroun follows with \\"Don't create an administrative burden for us [by bringing back prisoners alive]\\".Ahmed Haron - The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay warned that the comments by the Governor could amount to \\"violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states\\". She followed with \\"Such comments are extremely worrying in this context and could amount to incitement.\\". The Sudanese Government has since claimed that Mr. Haroun, who has already been indicted for war crimes and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for his alleged role in the previous conflict in Darfur,International Criminal Court. was simply trying to boost the soldiers' morale. Mr Haron however, has called the video a fabrication, accusing al-Jazeera of editing the video to distort what he had said and vowed to sue the news channel. Ms. Pillay said that witnesses who have visited the Nuba mountain region, mainly inhabited by the Nuba people and located in Southern Kordofan, have been reporting the burning of villages and killing of civilians in \\"an apparent scorched-earth policy.\\" \\"We know very little about the scale of the military operation in Southern Kordofan, as we have been denied access to the area,\\" she said. \\"But as far back as August last year, we found that human rights violations that could amount to crimes against humanity or war crimes have taken place in Southern Kordofan.\\". = Emigration = Following what Yasir Arman, leader of SPLA-N and the UN have described as a \\"scorched earth policy\\" more than 105,000 Sudanese refugees from the states of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile have sought refuge in South Sudan. An additional 30,000 refugees fled Blue Nile into nearby Ethiopia. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and its partners started providing basic assistance to more than 16,000 refugees who settled in Yida, South Sudan, after fleeing violence in the Nuba Mountains region, located in Sudan's Southern Kordofan state. Another 2,300 refugees have so far moved southwards to safer sites in Nyeel and Pariang to another UNHCR camps. Meanwhile, in South Sudan's Upper Nile state, where an influx of refugees from Sudan's Blue Nile state is continuing, relocation from border zones has been ongoing. About 86,000 Sudanese refugees fleeing attacks in Blue Nile state have relocated to the safety of formal sites in Doro and Jammam, Ms. Fleming said. However, since the beginning of Sudanese border conflict in 2012 the UNHCR now considers the Yida refugee settlement as not safe for long-term stay due to its proximity to the volatile border zone. South Sudan authorities at central and local level are also urging refugee leaders to relocate, in line with the provisions of the 1969 OAU (now AU) Convention on Refugees. Article 2 stipulates that \\"for reasons of security, countries of asylum shall, as far as possible, settle refugees at a reasonable distance from the frontier of their country of origin\\". Attempts at resolution =August 2011 ceasefire= On 23 August 2011, President Omar al-Bashir announced a two-week unilateral ceasefire in the conflict while on a surprise visit to South Kordofan state. He said the government would continue to embargo foreign aid directed toward South Kordofan, and the only humanitarian access would be through the Sudanese Red Crescent. He said that after the two-week ceasefire, \\"the situation will be assessed on the ground\\". International reactions =Supranational organisations= * ‚Äì On 29 June, AU Commission Chairperson Jean Ping called on both sides in South Kordofan \\"to immediately cease hostilities, to allow the access of humanitarian aid and the return of displaced people\\" and hailed a ceasefire agreement as \\"decisive\\" and \\"a good omen\\". The AU, led first by former South African President Thabo Mbeki and then by Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, attempted to mediate a solution to growing tensions in Blue Nile, but it failed to prevent the spread of the conflict. * ‚Äì The United Nations Security Council voted on 3 June to demand that Sudan and Southern Sudan withdraw troops from the Abyei Area. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon voiced support for efforts to end the conflict in late June 2011, saying on 29 June that Sudan and the SPLM-N must work quickly for a cessation of hostilities. A United Nations Mission in the Sudan human rights investigation in June and early July, prior to the mission's disbandment, found that \\"condemnation is insufficient\\" for the atrocities it said had been committed by the Sudanese military during the fighting, including attacks on UNMIS offices and personnel, though it also criticised the SPLM for violations. In August, the United States attempted to persuade the Security Council to pass a resolution condemning the violence, but it was blocked by Sudanese allies Russia and China. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Ant√≥nio Guterres responded to the outbreak of violence in Blue Nile in September by saying both sides must work to prevent \\"yet one more refugee crisis\\" in the region. Ban also expressed concern over the violence. =Countries= * ‚Äì On 22 May, South Sudan denounced the seizure of Abyei as an \\"act of war\\". Information Minister Barnaba Marial Benjamin denied claims by the Sudanese government that Juba was offering material support to SPLM-N fighters in the North on 31 August and asserted that the SPLM had severed all ties with the SPLM-N after independence. He expressed concern at the violence in Blue Nile on 2 September and called on the Sudanese government to launch a full investigation and endeavour to prevent the violence from spreading. * ‚Äì Having condemned the military takeover of Abyei on 21 March, on 22 July, Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice accused the Sudanese military of perpetrating human rights violations in South Kordofan. Princeton Lyman, the US special envoy to Sudan, said on 10 August that Washington was concerned that fighting could spread to and involve newly independent South Sudan. * ‚Äì On 22 May 2011, France condemned the military takeover and demanded a Sudanese withdrawal from Abyei. France argued that Sudan's actions constituted a violation of 2005 peace agreement and of the Kadugli Accord signed in January, and that the conflict should be mediated by the African Union. * ‚Äì On 23 May 2011, the Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister, John Baird, condemned the \\"recent upsurge of violence in Abyei\\". Canada called for an immediate withdrawal by both sides, respect for human rights and avoidance of further escalation. Baird added that he hoped \\"Northern and Southern Sudan\\" would both \\"embrace the opportunity afforded by the African Union High-Level Implementation Panel to resolve the status of Abyei and other outstanding issues\\". * ‚Äì On 22 May 2011, Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned the violence, saying that the actions were \\"clear violations of the CPA and cannot be justified\\" and calling for \\"all sides to cease hostilities immediately. All unauthorised forces should be withdrawn from the entire area of Abyei in accordance with past agreements by the parties.\\" =NGOs= Groups such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have expressed concern about the humanitarian situation. In May 2012, researchers from the Humanitarian Policy Group at the Overseas Development Institute highlighted that the situation in South Kordofan was approaching crisis levels and called for stronger leadership and engagement from humanitarian actors, as well as a redoubling of diplomatic efforts to restart political dialogue in the hope of securing a lasting and peaceful resolution.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization report, in 1985, Nigeria produced 18.3 million tonnes of yam from 1.5 million hectares, representing 73.8 percent of total yam production in Africa. According to 2008 figures, yam production in Nigeria has nearly doubled since 1985, with Nigeria producing 35.017 million metric tonnes with value equivalent of US$5.654 billion. In perspective, the world's second and third largest producers of yams, C√¥te d'Ivoire and Ghana, only produced 6.9 and 4.8 million tonnes of yams in 2008 respectively. According to the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Nigeria accounted for about 70 percent of the world production amounting to 17 million tonnes from land area 2,837,000 hectares under yam cultivation. Yam is in the class of roots and tubers that is a staple of the Nigerian and West African diet, which provides some 200 calories of energy per capital daily. In Nigeria, in many yam-producing areas, it is said that \\"yam is food and food is yam\\". However, the production of yam in Nigeria is substantially short and cannot meet the growing demand at its present level of use. It also has an important social status in gatherings and religious functions, which is assessed by the size of yam holdings one possesses. Species Yam, a tropical crop in the genus Dioscorea, has as many as 600 species out of which six are economically important staple species. These are: *Dioscorea rotundata (white guinea yam) - closely related to Dioscorea cayennensis, another domesticated yam widely consumed in West Africa. Both are derived from the wild progenitor Dioscorea praehensilis. *Dioscorea alata (purple yam) - originally from Oceania *Dioscorea bulbifera (aerial yam) - cultivated primarily for its bulbils *Dioscorea dumetorum (trifoliate yam) - similar to Dioscorea hispida' *Dioscorea esculenta (lesser yam, Chinese yam) - Asian origin Out of these, Dioscorea rotundata (white yam) and Dioscorea alata (water yam) are the most common, and most economically important, species in Nigeria. Yams are grown in the coastal region in rain forests, wood savanna and southern savanna habitats. Other tubers consumed in Nigeria: *Cassava *Sweet potato *Hausa potato *Livingstone potato *Potato Geographic regions The farmland production system in the Ekiti State consists of wetland (20% farms are under this category), upland (50% farms in this category) types and a combination of the two types (30% by the balance farms). A study carried out on the efficiency of the three systems to improve crop outputs to meet growing demands for this food crop, indicates that the \\"wetland yam based enterprises are the most economically efficient with mean economic efficiency of 0.80 followed by upland yam based enterprises with mean efficiency of 0.79.\\" The combination of wetland/upland yam based enterprises is assessed as the least economically efficient, with mean efficiency of 0.76. Hence, it has been recommended that more yams should be grown more on wetlands. Another recommendation made is to adopt the yam minisett technology developed by the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and the National Root Crops Research Institute (NRCRI). Although it is grown widely in Nigeria, the area where it is grown most is the Benue State (land area of 802,295 km¬≤) one of the states in Benue valley of Nigeria where the labour-intensive practices are still the norm and the land holdings are small. In this state especially among Tiv people, the size of the yam farm or the tonnage of yams produced becomes the social status of that farmer. Because of high level of yam production in the State of Benue, Benue State is crowned as the Nigerian Bread Basket. Yams are planted on mounds rather than flat slopes depending on the hydromorphic nature of the soils which are generally of loose soil suitable to grow roots and tuber crops. While yam production issues have been stressed on agronomical practices, a research study carried out on the economic efficiency of this crop grown in this region with small farm holdings, which is labour- intensive, reveals that land, labour and material (fertilizers and chemicals), credit and extension services inputs have a significant bearing on the yield of yam in the region. The Zaki Ibiam International Yam Market is the biggest market for a single product in Nigeria. Cultivation practices Dioscorea bulbifera Dioscorea cf. dumetorum Yam is grown on free draining, sandy and fertile soil, after clearing the first fallow. Land is prepared in the form of mound or ridge or heap of height. The yams recommended for such soil conditions in Nigeria are white yam or white guinea yam (Discorea rotundata) and water yam or yellow yam (Discorea alata). Planting is done by seed yam or cut setts from ware tubers. One day before planting, the tubers have to be subjected to treatment with wood ash or a fungicide (thiabendazole) to prevent damage to the soils. The setts are planted at an interval of with the cut face facing up. Mulching is essential during October‚ÄìNovember with dry grass or plant debris weighed down with balls of mud. Dosage of fertilizer application, as essential, is decided after chemical analysis of the soil samples. Manual weeding by hoeing is done three or four times depending on the rate of weed growth. Two Stakes, each of height are used for staking the plants to vine over it; one for two plants with the other used for bracing with the adjacent stakes. Sorghum stovers are also used for this purpose in the savannah land. Pest and disease control is addressed by cultural control and chemical methods; the pests which affect the plant are nematodes such as root knot Meloidogyne spp. and yam nematode (Scutellonema bradys), and insects such as yam shoot beetle, yam tuber beetle and crickets. Weeding of the field is essential and maintaining a weed free border around the field is to be ensured. Disease resistant [cultivars] are normally recommended for use. Harvesting is done before the vines become dry and soil becomes dry and hard. Generally, a yield of 10‚Äì15 tonnes per ha for white yam and 16‚Äì25 tonnes for water yam are obtained by following prescribed management practices. The harvested yams are stored by tying them with ropes. They have a shelf life of about 5 months. Warehouses where they are stored should be made rodent proof with a metal base and wire netting. Rotten buds and sprouted buds should be removed. Uses Tuber is the main part of the yam plant which has high carbohydrate content (low in fat and protein) and provides a good source of energy. Unpeeled yam has vitamin C. Yam, sweet in flavour, is consumed as boiled yam (as cooked vegetable) or fufu or fried in oil and then consumed. It is often pounded into a thick paste after boiling and is consumed with soup. It is also processed into flour for use in the preparation of the paste. Its medicinal use as a heart stimulant is attributed to its chemical composition, which consists of alkaloids of saponin and sapogenin. Its use as an industrial starch has also been established as the quality of some of the species is able to provide as much starch as in cereals. Rituals and festivals Ritualism and festivity restriction are also associated with yam, which is the staple in southeastern Nigeria. A yam festival is held every year to mark the harvesting of this crop. The village chiefs and traditional title holders of lands in Nigeria who grow yam make it a religious practice by not consuming yam till it is offered to the gods. During this festival, villagers offer prayers thanking their ancestral gods for the blessings of the land and the women's fertility. The festivity observed in villages is in the form of a parade of traditional dances. Customs One of the marriage custom observed in some communities in Nigeria is to measure the bridegroom's wealth by the amount of yams that he can produce. Also, according to tradition, the groom has to present a minimum of 200 big tubers of yams to the in-laws as a proof that he can take care of his wife and the future family. Yam is depicted as a male totem in some areas of the Igbo land. Another custom observed is that women are not permitted to go to the yam farms till it is ready for harvesting; however, harvesting of the crop is the prerogative of the women.

Description  East African Highland bananas are easily distinguishable from other banana cultivars by the numerous black (or more rarely brown or bronze) blotches on their pseudostems, giving them the appearance of polished metal. The outermost sheath of their pseudostems is a medium green, superimposed over the pink to purple underlying sheaths. Their leaves are also darker green and dull, a difference more apparent when comparing them side by side with other banana cultivars from a distance. The inflorescence has peduncles covered with coarse hair. The bracts are ovate to lanceolate in shape with outer surfaces that are purple to brown and inner surfaces which are red fading to yellow towards the base. The male flowers have cream colored tepals with yellow lobes. The anthers are pink, while the stigmata are orange. The fruits are recurved and can vary in length. They are inflated with blunt tips. The pulp is white in unripe fruits and cream-colored in ripe fruits.  Taxonomy  East African Highland bananas are triploid (AAA) cultivars. Their official designation is Musa acuminata Colla (AAA-EA). Synonyms include Musa brieyi De Wild. Their paternal parent is the blood banana subspecies (M. acuminata ssp. zebrina) of the wild banana species Musa acuminata. East African Highland bananas are a subgroup that refers to about 200 individual banana cultivars (or clones). They can be subdivided into five distinct groups of clones known as clone sets: *Mbidde or beer clone set :The Mbidde clone set contains 14 cultivars. Mbidde means 'beer', and clones belonging to this clone set are usually used for making banana beer. Their pulp is bitter and astringent with sticky brown excretions. *Nakitembe clone set *Nakabululu clone set :Nakabululu clones are soft-textured and savory. They mature quickly, but their fruits are smaller and have lesser overall yields per bunch. *Musakala clone set :Musakala clones are characterized by slender fruits with bottle-necked tips. Other characteristics are the same as the preceding three clone sets. *Nfuuka clone set :Nfuuka clones are characterized by inflated, rounded, or almost rectangular fruits with intermediate-shaped tips. The bunch shape is mainly rectangular. Other characteristics are the same as the other clone sets. It is the most diverse of the five clone sets, a probable result of its tendency to mutate more frequently. They bear heavy compacted bunches and are thus more often exploited commercially than other clone sets. Over 500 local names are known for cultivars from the EAHB subgroup.  Origin and distribution  East African Highland bananas were introduced early into Africa from Southeast Asia during the first to sixth centuries AD, probably via trade . They are genetically distinct from the other AAA cultivars, having evolved locally in the African Great Lakes region for over a millennium. They are found nowhere else in the world, and the African Great Lakes has been called the secondary center of banana diversity because of this (with Southeast Asia being the first). East African Highland bananas are considered to be especially diverse in Uganda, Burundi, and Rwanda. However, genetic analysis has revealed that all East African Highland bananas are genetically uniform, having most likely originated from a single ancestral clone (introduced to Africa within past 2000 years) that underwent population expansion by vegetative propagation. The triploid East African Highland banana gene pool arose from a single hybridization event, which generated a genetic bottleneck during the foundation of the crop genepool. Triploid East African Highland bananas are sterile, and have been asexually vegetatively propagated by generations by successive generations of farmers since their introduction to Africa. This has likely led to the emergence of the genetically near-isogenic somatic mutants (i.e. todays East African Highland banana varieties) that have been selected by farmers and environments across East Africa.Kitavi M, Downing T, Lorenzen J, Karamura D, Onyango M, Nyine M, Ferguson M, Spillane C. The triploid East African Highland Banana (EAHB) genepool is genetically uniform arising from a single ancestral clone that underwent population expansion by vegetative propagation. Theoretical and applied genetics. 2016 Mar 1;129(3):547-61.  Economic importance  East African Highland bananas are one of the most important staple food crops in the African Great Lakes region, particularly for Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, and Rwanda. Per capita annual consumption of bananas in Uganda is the highest in the world at daily per person. Including Rwanda and Burundi, consumption is about per person annually (about three to 11 bananas each day). Uganda is the second-largest producer of bananas in the world. It is, however, one of the smallest exporters, with the crops being used mostly for domestic consumption. East African Highland bananas are so important as food crops, the local name matoke (or more commonly matooke) is synonymous for the word \\"food\\" in Uganda. Also, a portion of the East African Highland bananas locally known as mbidde is used to produce juice/beer.  Food preparation  Matoke fruits Matoke are peeled using a knife, wrapped in the plant's leaves (or plastic bags), and set in a cooking pot (Swahili: sufuria) atop the banana stalks. The pot is then placed on a charcoal or wood fire and the matoke is steamed for a couple of hours, water is poured into the bottom of the cooking pot multiple times. The stalks in the bottom of the pot serve to keep the leaf-wrapped fruits above the level of the hot water. While uncooked, the matoke is white and fairly hard; cooking turns it soft and yellow. The matoke is then mashed while still wrapped in the leaves or bags and often served on a fresh banana leaf. It is typically eaten with a sauce made of vegetables, ground peanut, or some type of meat (goat or beef). Ugandan traditional meal with Matoke steamed and served with luwombo, meat or groundnuts steamed in banana leaves. Matoke are also used to make a popular breakfast dish called Katogo in Uganda. Katogo is commonly cooked as a combination of the peeled bananas and peanuts or beef, though offal or goats meat are also common. In Bukoba, Tanzania, matoke (or ebitooke) are cooked with meat or smoked catfish, and beans or groundnuts. This method eliminates the need for preparing a separate sauce. In this recipe, the matoke are not mashed. Up until the early 1980s, this was the most common meal in Bukoba and would be eaten year round.

For example, cells which are genetically identical, even within the same tissue, are often observed to have different expression levels of proteins, different sizes and structures. These apparently random differences can have important biological and medical consequences. Cellular noise was originally, and is still often, examined in the context of gene expression levels ‚Äì either the concentration or copy number of the products of genes within and between cells. As gene expression levels are responsible for many fundamental properties in cellular biology, including cells' physical appearance, behaviour in response to stimuli, and ability to process information and control internal processes, the presence of noise in gene expression has profound implications for many processes in cellular biology.  Definitions  The most frequent quantitative definition of noise is the coefficient of variation: : \\\\eta_X = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X}{\\\\mu_X}, where \\\\eta_X is the noise in a quantity X, \\\\mu_X is the mean value of X and \\\\sigma_X is the standard deviation of X. This measure is dimensionless, allowing a relative comparison of the importance of noise, without necessitating knowledge of the absolute mean. Other quantities often used for mathematical convenience are the Fano factor: : F_X = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X^2}{\\\\mu_X}. and the normalized variance: : N_X = \\\\eta_X^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X^2}{\\\\mu_X^2}.  Experimental measurement  The first experimental account and analysis of gene expression noise in prokaryotes is from Becskei & Serrano and from Alexander van Oudenaarden's lab. The first experimental account and analysis of gene expression noise in eukaryotes is from James J. Collins's lab.  Intrinsic and extrinsic noise  A schematic illustration of a dual reporter study. Each data point corresponds to a measurement of the expression level of two identically-regulated genes in a single cell: the scatter reflects measurements of a population of cells. Extrinsic noise is characterised by expression levels of both genes covarying between cells, intrinsic by internal differences. Cellular noise is often investigated in the framework of intrinsic and extrinsic noise. Intrinsic noise refers to variation in identically-regulated quantities within a single cell: for example, the intra- cell variation in expression levels of two identically-controlled genes. Extrinsic noise refers to variation in identically-regulated quantities between different cells: for example, the cell-to-cell variation in expression of a given gene. Intrinsic and extrinsic noise levels are often compared in dual reporter studies, in which the expression levels of two identically- regulated genes (often fluorescent reporters like GFP and YFP) are plotted for each cell in a population. An issue with the general depiction of extrinsic noise as a spread along the main diagonal in dual-reporter studies is the assumption that extrinsic factors cause positive expression correlations between the two reporters. In fact, when the two reporters compete for binding of a low-copy regulator, the two reporters become anomalously anticorrelated, and the spread is perpendicular to the main diagonal. In fact, any deviation of the dual-reporter scatter plot from circular symmetry indicates extrinsic noise. Information theory offers a way to avoid this anomaly.  Sources  Note: These lists are illustrative, not exhaustive, and identification of noise sources is an active and expanding area of research. ;Intrinsic noise * Low copy-number effects (including discrete birth and death events): the random (stochastic) nature of production and degradation of cellular components means that noise is high for components at low copy number (as the magnitude of these random fluctuations is not negligible with respect to the copy number); * Diffusive cellular dynamics: many important cellular processes rely on collisions between reactants (for example, RNA polymerase and DNA) and other physical criteria which, given the diffusive dynamic nature of the cell, occur stochastically. * Noise propagation: Low copy-number effects and diffusive dynamics result in each of the biochemical reactions in a cell occurring randomly. Stochasticity of reactions can be either attenuated or amplified. Contribution each reaction makes to the intrinsic variability in copy numbers can be quantified via Van Kampen's system size expansion. ;Extrinsic noise * Cellular age / cell cycle stage: cells in a dividing population that is not synchronised will, at a given snapshot in time, be at different cell cycle stages, with corresponding biochemical and physical differences; *Cell growth: variations in growth rates leading to concentration variations between cells; * Physical environment (temperature, pressure, ...): physical quantities and chemical concentrations (particularly in the case of cell-to-cell signalling) may vary spatially across a population of cells, provoking extrinsic differences as a function of position; * Organelle distributions: random factors in the quantity and quality of organelles (for example, the number and functionality of mitochondria) lead to significant cell-to-cell differences in a range of processes (as, for example, mitochondria play a central role in the energy budget of eukaryotic cells); * Inheritance noise: uneven partitioning of cellular components between daughter cells at mitosis can result in large extrinsic differences in a dividing population. * Regulator competition: Regulators competing to bind downstream promoters can cause negative correlations: when one promoter is bound the other is not and vice versa. Note that extrinsic noise can affect levels and types of intrinsic noise: for example, extrinsic differences in the mitochondrial content of cells lead, through differences in ATP levels, to some cells transcribing faster than others, affecting the rates of gene expression and the magnitude of intrinsic noise across the population.  Effects  Note: These lists are illustrative, not exhaustive, and identification of noise effects is an active and expanding area of research. * Gene expression levels: noise in gene expression causes differences in the fundamental properties of cells, limits their ability to biochemically control cellular dynamics, and directly or indirectly induce many of the specific effects below; * Energy levels and transcription rate: noise in transcription rate, arising from sources including transcriptional bursting, is a significant source of noise in expression levels of genes. Extrinsic noise in mitochondrial content has been suggested to propagate to differences in the ATP concentrations and transcription rates (with functional relationships implied between these three quantities) in cells, affecting cells' energetic competence and ability to express genes; * Phenotype selection: bacterial populations exploit extrinsic noise to choose a population subset to enter a quiescent state. In a bacterial infection, for example, this subset will not propagate quickly but will be more robust when the population is threatened by antibiotic treatment: the rapidly replicating, infectious bacteria will be killed more quickly than the quiescent subset, which may be capable of restarting the infection. This phenomenon is why courses of antibiotics should be finished even when symptoms seem to have disappeared; * Development and stem cell differentiation: developmental noise in biochemical processes which need to be tightly controlled (for example, patterning of gene expression levels that develop into different body parts) during organismal development can have dramatic consequences, necessitating the evolution of robust cellular machinery. Stem cells differentiate into different cell types depending on the expression levels of various characteristic genes: noise in gene expression can clearly perturb and influence this process, and noise in transcription rate can affect the structure of the dynamic landscape that differentiation occurs on. There are review articles summarizing these effects from bacteria to mammalian cells; * Drug resistance: Noise improves short-term survival and long-term evolution of drug resistance at high levels of drug treatment. Noise has the opposite effect at low levels of drug treatment; * Cancer treatments: recent work has found extrinsic differences, linked to gene expression levels, in the response of cancer cells to anti-cancer treatments, potentially linking the phenomenon of fractional killing (whereby each treatment kills some but not all of a tumour) to noise in gene expression. Because individual cells could repeatedly and stochastically perform transitions between states associated with differences in responsiveness to a therapeutic modality (chemotherapy, targeted agent, radiation, etc.), therapy might need to be administered frequently (to ensure cells are treated soon after entering a therapy-responsive state, before they can rejoin the therapy-resistant subpopulation and proliferate) and over long times (to treat even those cells emerging late from the final residue of the therapy-resistant subpopulation). * Evolution of genome: Genome are covered by chromatin that can be roughly classified into \\"open\\" (also known as euchromatin) or \\"closed\\" (also known as heterochromatin). Open chromatin leads to less noise in transcription compared to heterochromatin. Often \\"housekeeping\\" proteins (which are proteins that carry out tasks in the required for cellular survival) work large multiprotein complexes. If the noise in proteins of such complexes are to discordinated, it can lead to reduced level of production of multiprotein complexes with potentially deleterious effects. Reduction in noise may provide an evolutionary selection movement of essential genes into open chromatin. * Information processing: as cellular regulation is performed with components that are themselves subject to noise, the ability of cells to process information and perform control is fundamentally limited by intrinsic noise  Analysis  chromatin remodelling and transcription factor binding). Active DNA is transcribed to produce mRNA which is translated to produce protein, both of which are degraded. All processes are Poissonian with given rates. As many quantities of cell biological interest are present in discrete copy number within the cell (single DNAs, dozens of mRNAs, hundreds of proteins), tools from discrete stochastic mathematics are often used to analyse and model cellular noise. In particular, master equation treatments ‚Äì where the probabilities P(\\\\mathbf{x},t) of observing a system in a state \\\\mathbf{x} at time t are linked through ODEs ‚Äì have proved particularly fruitful. A canonical model for noise gene expression, where the processes of DNA activation, transcription and translation are all represented as Poisson processes with given rates, gives a master equation which may be solved exactly (with generating functions) under various assumptions or approximated with stochastic tools like Van Kampen's system size expansion. Numerically, the Gillespie algorithm or stochastic simulation algorithm is often used to create realisations of stochastic cellular processes, from which statistics can be calculated. The problem of inferring the values of parameters in stochastic models (parametric inference) for biological processes, which are typically characterised by sparse and noisy experimental data, is an active field of research, with methods including Bayesian MCMC and approximate Bayesian computation proving adaptable and robust. Regarding the two-state model, a moment-based method was described for parameters inference from mRNAs distributions.

Biography  = Early Years = Born in the Bronx, Suben was the second of three sons in a middle-class Jewish family of Russian origin. He grew up in the small city of Cortland in Central New York. After showing signs of early musical talent, Suben began studying the trumpet and violin at age 8. He played in school bands and orchestras and sang in choirs throughout his childhood. At age 10, Suben began transcribing music from phonograph records. By age 13 he was creating arrangements for local dance bands. His music teachers encouraged him to study a number of instruments in the expectation that he would become a music teacher. During summers he undertook formal lessons in percussion (snare drum technique), clarinet, and string bass. Although he'd led dance bands as a teenager, his interests gravitated to classical music. At age 14 he auditioned for Syracuse Symphony Orchestra conductor Karl Kritz and was invited to play violin in the Symphony‚Äôs newly formed youth orchestra. = Advanced studies = During Suben‚Äôs final year of high school he auditioned for Louis Krasner at Syracuse University but declined a scholarship offer from the university in favor of a scholarship to study trumpet at the Eastman School of Music. In deference to his father‚Äôs wishes, Suben enrolled in a liberal arts degree program at the nearby University of Rochester and traveled to the Eastman campus for trumpet lessons and theory classes. In his second year, Suben transferred his enrollment entirely to Eastman and concentrated largely on composition and violin studies. He was allowed to declare a major in composition only after he won first prize in 1967 in a nationwide competition for composers.[Unsigned], ‚ÄúRochester Man Wins Hartford AOG Contest‚Äù (25 November 1967), The Hartford Times. The winning composition, a setting of Psalm 100 for tenor voice and organ, was published by Bellwin-Mills (who bought out H.W. Gray, the co- sponsors, along with the American Guild of Organists, of the competition). Suben left Eastman in 1969 with a B.Mus. degree cum laude. As a full fellowship doctoral student (1969‚Äì1972) at Brandeis University near Boston, Suben studied composition and theory under Seymour Shifrin, Arthur Berger, Harold Shapero, and Martin Boykan, and studied musical paleontology with Leo Treitler. Increasingly in demand as a conductor of other composers‚Äô works, Suben took a one-year position as orchestra conductor at Northeastern University and held simultaneous music directorships at a local church and synagogue. In March 1973 he led what is believed to be the Boston premiere of Darius Milhaud‚Äôs Service Sacr√© with an enlarged chorus and members of the orchestra of the Opera Company of Boston. In spring 1973 Suben resigned from all of his directorships, moved to New York City, and began four years of intensive private conducting study with Jacques-Louis Monod. During this time Suben ceased all composing activity and made an intensive study of the standard orchestral and opera repertoire. In 1975 he was admitted to Otmar Suitner‚Äôs conductors‚Äô class at the Mozarteum Sommerakademie in Salzburg; at the end of his second summer in Salzburg (1976) he was a finalist in the Hans Haring International Competition for Conductors,:nl:Joel Eric Suben administered annually by the music division of the Austrian Radio. During the run-up to the final round, the jury summoned Suben back to the podium three times to rehearse the orchestra in Anton Webern‚Äôs Six Pieces for Orchestra, op. 6. In August 1976 Witold Rowicki, visiting professor at the Vienna Music Academy (now called die Universit√§t f√ºr Musik und darstellende Kunst Wien), admitted Suben into his conductors‚Äô master class and subsequently invited him to come to Warsaw, where Rowicki was artistic director of the National Philharmonic (Filharmonia Narodowa). Suben won a Fulbright Fellowship and, following a month-long composition residency at the MacDowell Colony, arrived in Warsaw only to discover that Rowicki had retired from the directorship of FN. Suben lived from September 1977 until December 1978 in Katowice, where he was officially a composition student (in fact, the first American student) of Henryk Miko≈Çaj G√≥recki in that city‚Äôs music academy (now called Akademia Muzyczna im. Karola Szymanowskiego). During his tenure in Katowice, Suben organized a series of orchestral performances of contemporary American music;[Unsigned], ‚ÄúAmeryka≈Ñski kompozytor i dyrygent, Joel Suben‚Ä¶.‚Äù [‚ÄúAmerican composer and conductor Joel Suben‚Ä¶.‚Äù], Katowicki Informator Kulturalny issue no. 84, year viii no. 4, April 1978, pp.21‚Äì22. he also conducted the Rybnik Philharmonic Orchestra and the Ogniwo Choir.[Unsigned], ‚ÄúDiamenty Jubileusz Ch√≥ru ‚ÄòOgniwo‚Äô‚Äù [‚ÄúDiamond Anniversary of Choir ‚ÄòOgniwo‚Äô‚Äù] Dziennik Zachodni, 20 Nov. 1978, issue no. 263, year XXXIV, pp. 1‚Äì2. Suben‚Äôs final activity as a student came in 1984 when he was admitted to the master class for conductors given by Sergiu Celibidache at the Curtis Institute of Music. = Academic career = Returning to New York in 1979, Suben resumed teaching part-time at Fordham University and Baruch College (he had taught courses at both institutions from 1974‚Äì1977). He also completed his doctoral dissertation during this time, one part being the full score to a large composition (his Concerto for Piano and Orchestra [1978]), the other a theoretical paper (\\"Debussy and Octatonic Pitch Structure\\"Debussy and Octatonic Pitch Structure; Suben, Joel Eric, Brandeis University Ph.D. dissertation, 1980Stravinsky and the Russian traditions: a biography of the works through Mavra; Taruskin, Richard; Berkeley, 1996; vol. 1, p. 269; vol. 2, p. 1713; .). Armed with a Ph.D. from Brandeis, he took a professorship at the University of Richmond (VA), where in the fall of 1980 he organized an orchestral concert honoring American hostages in Iran.[Unsigned], ‚ÄúSuben in Debut at UR In ‚ÄòConcert for Hostages‚Äô‚Äù (25 October), Richmond News Leader, p. A13. This concert attracted considerable media attention. In 1983 he joined the music faculty of the College of William & Mary, where he remained until 1992 as Director of Orchestras. During this time Suben taught a number of private conducting and composition students. While at W&M;, Suben formed a chamber orchestra and created an annual series of the six Brandenburg Concerti of J.S. Bach in the historic Bruton Parish Chapel. He also inaugurated a contemporary music ensemble and an opera workshop at W&M; and in November 1989 gave the world premiere of American composer Philip James‚Äôs cantata To Cecilia with the William & Mary Orchestra and Chorus.[Unsigned], ‚ÄúOrchestra and Choir to Premiere Work by Philip James‚Äù (25 October 1989), William & Mary News, vol. IX no. 9, p. 4 In 1992 Suben resigned from his position at William & Mary, returned to live permanently in New York, and formed Save The Music, inc. as a tax-exempt nonprofit corporation. Apart from a three-year tenure as conductor of the Wellesley Philharmonic (the student orchestra at Wellesley College) during the mid-1990s, Suben has held no further permanent academic positions.  Compositions  = Stylistic evolution = Suben‚Äôs earliest serious compositions (e.g. Sonata da Camera [1966] for four violins), written while he was still in his teens, reflected a conservative aesthetic and an adherence to the trappings of tonality, prevalent characteristics of new works being composed then at the Eastman School. In his early and mid twenties, Suben‚Äôs work acquired a chromatic overlay that reflected the preoccupations of many of his peers and teachers with 12-tone procedures (e.g. Birthday FragmentNeville, Harry, ‚ÄúRan Blake and Joel Suben Fresh, Vivid Composers‚Äù (2 March 1972). Boston Herald, p. 42. [1972] for chorus and piano). His works from 1977 onward (following the three-year composing hiatus) are fully dodecaphonic (e.g. Concert Piece for Clarinet and Wind-Band [1977]). After 1978 his work began to show some influences of Witold Lutos≈Çawski and Witold Szalonek, the leading Polish composers of highly coloristic, voluptuous chromatic music of the time (e.g. Tr√§ume auf Dichterh√∂heBustard, C.A., ‚ÄúSuben dreams with Faust‚Äù (22 Oct. 1982). Richmond Times-Dispatch, p. C-1.Mahin, Bruce P., ‚ÄúRichmond Sinfonia‚Äù (23 Oct. 1982), Richmond Times-Dispatch, p. B-7. [1978] for horn and string orchestra), but notably no trace of any influence by his teacher G√≥recki. By the late 1980s Suben had begun to write functionally tonal music (e.g. Symphony in Old Style [1987], Winter Love [1988], Song BookGlacklin, William, ‚ÄúGirls Chorus Makes New Music Magic‚Äù (5 Nov. 1990), Sacramento Bee, p. E-8. [1989] for treble voices a cappella, Concerto Classico [1991] for flute and orchestra) while he continued to turn out highly detailed 12-tone works (e.g. Suite of Dances [1987] for 2 guitars, Seven Days [1992] for mezzo-soprano and piano). = Recent works = After 1993, Suben's compositional output diminished in direct proportion to his growing activity in making recordings. Between 1994 and 2010 his compositional output consists entirely of: television commercial music (1994) for Granta Magazine (aired on PBS networks),Playlist for March 1995, WNET-TV 13. Breve Sogno (1994) for large orchestra (his last completed 12-tone work), Fantasy-Variations on a Theme of Maria Theresia von Paradis (1999) for violin and orchestra, Seven (2004) for chorus a cappella, Ciacconetta (2008) for viola and orchestra, and Three Images (2010) for cello and orchestra.

MSR Classics, MS 1223 (2002)  Public persona  In the role of a public music personality during much of his career, Suben has displayed a tendency to engage in polemics. After reading a review of a performance of one of his earliest acknowledged (and therefore arguably listener-friendly) compositions, Suben wrote a letter to the editor protesting the critic‚Äôs fixation on the fact that the piece under review was the work of a student.Kennamer, Stephen, ‚ÄúNew Music Concert‚Äù (12 August 1981), Richmond Times-Dispatch, p.

In the mid 1980s, Yufeng Township accounted for one half of the entire county's production. Many women in Jiangxi province are occupied in the kumquat industry.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, as of 2010, peach production in China was 10 million tonnes (11 million short tons), accounting for 50% of world production. Other leading peach producers are Italy (10%), Spain (7%) and the United States (6%). Since most of China's peaches are for domestic consumption, China is not the world's largest exporter of peaches, but instead ranks as the fifth-largest peach exporter, behind Spain, Italy, France and the United States (4th). China's export of peaches to the U.S. during 2010 was valued at about US$55 million. The peach is indigenous to China, with its historical records traced from fossil stones in Wu County in Jiangsu province, during archaeological excavations. The two types of peaches (Prunus persica, a deciduous fruit) are clingstone and freestone; the history and cultivation of both types have been traced as far back as 1000 BCE in China. They are now grown worldwide.Layne, p.xiii‚Äìxiv, 1, 48‚Äì51 History The painting \\"The Tale of the Peach-Blossom Land\\" inside of the Long Corridor on the grounds of the Old Summer Palace in Beijing, China. Although its botanical name Prunus persica suggests that the peach is native to Persia, peaches actually originated in China, where they have been cultivated since the early days of Chinese culture. Recent evidence indicates that peach domestication occurred as early as 6000 BC in Zhejiang Province of China. The oldest archaeological peach stones are from the Kuahuqiao site near Hangzhou. According to archaeologists, > Five populations of archaeological peach stones recovered from Zhejiang > Province, China, document peach use and evolution beginning ca. 8000 BP. The > majority of the archaeological sites from which the earliest peach stones > have been recovered are from the Yangzi River valley, indicating that this > is where early selection for favorable peach varieties likely took place. Peaches were mentioned in Chinese writings and literature beginning from the early 1st millennium BC. Peaches play an important role in Chinese mythology and history and were said to have magical powers. Peaches are mentioned in many ancient pieces of Chinese literature and art, such as Tao Yuanming's The Tale of the Peach-Blossom Spring. In addition, the results of archaeological excavations in Banpo village, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province support references in ancient manuscripts to 17 different fruits, mostly deciduous and including peaches, beginning with Shi Jing, an ancient record of songs scripted in 1000 BC. Archaeological finds testify to a well-developed agricultural knowledge base in pomology. The Chinese knew about cultivar differences in winter peaches in the second century BC. Cultivation Peach blossoms Peach flowers Peach production is largely concentrated in northern, central to eastern and north-western China, although a significant part of the country grows them. In general, peach production in China can be divided into seven regions based on regional climate and ecological differences. These main areas of production are Northwest in Xinjiang, Ningxia, Shaanxi and Gansu; the Northern China plains in Beijing, Tianjing, Hebei, southern Liaoning, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Jiangsu and northern Anhui, especially along the Huai River; the humid Yangtze region in the centre and east in southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, southern Anhui, Jiangxi and Hubei; the Yunnan-Guizhou high plateau in Yunnan, Guizhou and southwest Sichuan; the Qinghai-Tibet cold plateau; the cold northeast in Jilin and Heilongjiang; and finally the subtropical region of Southern China, particularly to the south of the Yangtze, in the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, southern Hunan, north Guangdong, north Guangxi and Taiwan.Layne, p. 48 Peach/nectarine production for the year 2010 (January to December) was reported to be 10 million tonnes from an area of . While the area decreased by 1% over the previous year, production recorded an increase of 2%. In the well-managed areas of Shadang, yield was reported at 3.5 tonnes per mu (5,200 t/km2). Export forecast for 2010 was 52,000 tonnes, an increase of 30% over the previous year; this is attributed to better cold storage facilities and increase in demand from Southeast Asia, Central Europe and Russia. =Cultivars= The native peach of China is categorised under two major groups, namely, the cultivars and the ecotypes. North China has the Mitao cultivars, which bear larger fruits with a firm flesh. These are grown in Feicheng and Yidou in Shandong province, Shenzhou in Hebei province, Liquan and Fuping in Shaanxi province and Zhenging and Zhangye in Gansu province. Other major cultivars are Feicheng Tao, Shenzhou Mitao and Yidou Mitao. The Shuimitao peach, also known as the Water Honey peach, is grown extensively in the Yangtze River basin areas in South China. These cultivars are well adapted to conditions in the Yangtze River basin, which has suitable wet climatic conditions with high summer temperatures. They have tender flesh and are juicy, with high sugar content. Fenghua yulu and Baihua shuimi cultivars are popular in areas close to the cities of Nanjing, Wuxi, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Ningbo and Fenghua. Areas under production with early peach and nectarine cultivars have increased. The major root stocks used for peaches are Prunus davidiana Franc in Southern China and Prunus persica Stoke in Northern China. =Protected systems= Peach fruits Since 1959, the peach has also been grown under a protected system innovated by the Shandong Agricultural University which has substantially extended its marketing period. Protected system practices involve the application of chemicals under controlled conditions, setting foliage limits, pruning during summer, girdling during autumn, creating drought stress, pruning roots and use of \\"dwarfing root stocks and dwarfing or semi-dwarfing cultivars\\", micro-climate control (temperature, humidity, light, water, CO2:O2 ratio, additional illumination, covering with transparent films and use of reflective lights on ground to control air and light in order to induce ripening and improve fruit quality), apart from many other techniques in use of fertilisers, pruning, irrigation, inter-cropping systems and humidity control. The productivity of peach trees in greenhouses using this programme is limited to about 10 years.Layne, pp. 48‚Äì49 Uses Consumption of peaches within China has increased with marked preferences, people in Shanghai preferring the sweet and juicy variety, while Beijing people prefer the hard-flesh sourish variety. Canned peaches are also becoming popular in urban areas, yellow peaches being the preferred variety for canning. About 80% of peaches produced are for the domestic fresh market through well organised distribution centres. Fruit is harvested when about 80% ripe and then packed in cardboard boxes before dispatch to marketing centres. Export of fresh white-fleshed melting peach has been a trend in recent years and processed products (such as canned, dried, sliced dry products, juices, tea, beer, fruit jelly and candies) are exported to Europe and the US.Layne, pp. 50‚Äì51 References Bibliography * External links * Category:Agricultural production in China by commodity Category:Peach production ","title":"Peach production in China"},{"id":"32105088","text":"The Holcombe Site, also known as Holcombe Beach, is a Paleo-Indian archaeological site located near the intersection of Metropolitan Parkway and Dodge Park RoadThe NRHP lists the location of this site as \\"address restricted.\\" The Michigan State Housing Development Authority gives the location as noted, and has erected a marker at the site.

Wahla discovered evidence of an ancient settlement at this site. Later radiocarbon dating of hearth elements determined the site to be an 11,000-year-old Paleo-Indian settlement. A five- year dig by archaeologists from the University of Michigan uncovered numerous artifacts. The distinctive small, thin, fluted arrowheads found at the site were dubbed \\"Holcombe points;\\" similar flint arrowheads have been found at other sites in Michigan and southern Ontario, with scatterings in northern Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Historical description of the site The Holcombe site was situated on what was, at the time it was occupied, the strandline of a small glacial lake that probably drained into nearby Lake Algonquin. Arrowheads, flint chips, and bone fragments were recovered, indicating that these Paleo-Indians hunted Barren-ground Caribou, a species particularly adapted to the tundra-like conditions that existed at the time. The site yielded evidence of the Indigenous people's change in culture and subsistence as the climate in the area changed.

Family and education Louis-Andre Pichon was the son of Simeon Pichon, shoemaker, and Jeanne Fortier. He studied at the College of Oratory and then studied philosophy at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris from 1790. Diplomatic career He was originally a French diplomat in Philadelphia from 1793 to 1796, before returning to Paris to make a reconciliation, between the two countries after the Quasi-War, that led to the Treaty of Mortefontaine. He was ambassador to France and charg√© d'affaires in Washington, D.C. from 1801 to 1804. He expressed strong criticism, when the U.S. resumed trade relations with the parties in Haiti freed by the black general Jean-Jacques Dessalines, at the failure of the expedition to Saint-Domingue. During the Saint-Domingue expedition, he struggled to ensure adequate supplies to the military, but quarreled with Charles Leclerc. The brother of Peter Bauduy, Louis Alexander Amelia Bauduy Bellevue is also a captain in the army of Leclerc, after having fought in 1797, alongside the English against Toussaint Louverture. =Louisiana Purchase= France had then secretly acquired Louisiana, and diplomat Robert Livingston negotiated the Louisiana Purchase as a whole, in 1803. On 1 October 1802, Louis-Andre Pichon wrote to the U.S. government to reassure them, when the Spanish intendant of New Orleans decided to terminate the offloading of U.S. merchants in the port, which was French property, following a secret treaty in 1800. Later life He was recalled to Paris September 15, 1804, reportedly for failing to thwart the marriage of J√©r√¥me Bonaparte with an American, Elizabeth Patterson, but also for frankness. He finished his career under Napoleon, as a civil servant in Westphalia. He married Emilie Brongniart (1780‚Äì1847). He was made a baron, in the Bourbon Restoration.

Origins He was born at Carnally, Creggan parish, near Crossmaglen, in County Armagh, modern-day Northern Ireland, about 1720. His father's name is unknown although his mother was Aine. A grandfather was said to have been killed at the Battle of Aughrim in 1691 (see Diarmuid Mac Muireadhaigh). McMurphy had four sisters; one of whom, Aillidh, was married to Mr. Duffy, a nephew of the poet Niall McMurphy (Niall √ìge Mac Murchadha) to whom he was closely related. He was noted as a handsome man, and used to introduce himself to his victims as \\"Meet Seamus Mac Murphy, the handsomest man in Ireland.\\"(Mise Seumus 'A' Mhurchaidh is deise 'bhfuil in Eirinn). He had a reputation as a great drinker and a charming companion of many women. Yet it was over-indulgence in drink and promiscuity that were to lead to his downfall. Association with √ì Doirn√≠n His close friend was Peadar √ì Doirn√≠n, a fellow-poet with whom he founded a school of Gaelic poetry. They held regular sessions at Dunreavy Wood and Mullaghbane. In the summer of 1744, Mac Murchaidh and O'Doirnin organised a monster meeting on Slieve Gullion to motivate the people for the expected arrival of the Young Pretender. Raparee The two were active Jacobites in the years up to the 1745 rebellion; McMurphy was an active rapparee since at least 1740. His main adversary was John Johnson of Roxborough, known as Johnson of the Fews, a tory hunter. A truce In the summer of 1744, as a result of the unrest caused by the Slieve Gullion meeting, Johnson was attacked and very seriously wounded. Though he survived, he met with McMurphy and √ì Doirn√≠n, where they agreed to \\"an uneasy truce.\\" Molly MacDecker McMurphy and √ì Doirn√≠n often attended a sib√≠n or inn at Flagstaff (or Upper Fathom?), a mountain route to Omeath, owned by Patsy MacDecker, known as Paddy of the Mountain. The area remains particularly remote even in the 21st century, and in the 1740s was the perfect hideaway for raparees. McMurphy became a lover of Mac Decker's daughter, Molly. However, the affair was tempestous; after a fierce argument and break- up, Molly swore revenge on Mac Murphy. To this end, she plied √ì Doirn√≠n with drink one evening, and inveigled him to compose a satirical poem about Johnson, which he called The Heretic Headhunter. She took the poem to Johnson, saying McMurphy was the author. Johnson was angry at this breach of their truce. Molly was offered fifty pounds by Johnson to trap McMurphy. However, another version lays the blame on a lieutenant of Mac Murchaidh, Art Fearon, who wished to ingratiate himself with Molly. This version claims that he told her in-depth stories about infidelities McMurphy had with other women. Paddy of the Mountain decided to take advantage of the fifty pounds offered as reward money, and joined the scheme. On the Saturday night before the Pattern of Killeavy (a local religious festival), McMurphy was to spend the night at the inn; the MacDeckers were to get him insensibly drunk and off-guard. However it came about, Johnson and his men caught McMurphy at MacDecker's inn, sometime late in 1749 or early in 1750. Trial and aftermath McMurphy spent eight months in prison in Newry, County Down, before been tried, found guilty and sentenced to execution. He is said to have had not fear on the day and forgave all who helped his capture, including Molly. His body was left hanging for three days before it was taken down, waked for two nights at his mother's barn in Carnally, before been buried in Creggan churchyard. In 1973, Jem Murphy, a descendant of the family, erected a memorial headstone to Seamus and the McMurphy clan. Paddy MacDecker is said to have received his blood money at Armagh in copper coin, so disgusted with the authorities with him. Folk legend has it that the effort of carrying the reward twenty miles home caused him to die within sight of his home. Molly MacDecker became ostracised by her community, and became mentally ill. She eventually drowned herself at Narrow Water.

A strictly economic approach to development views a country's development in quantitative terms such as job creation, inflation control, and high employment ‚Äì all of which aim to improve the ‚Äòeconomic wellbeing‚Äô of a country and the subsequent quality of life for its people. In terms of economic development, quality of life is defined as access to necessary rights and resources including but not limited to quality education, medical facilities, affordable housing, clean environments, and low crime rate. Gender and development considers many of these same factors; however, gender and development emphasizes efforts towards understanding how multifaceted these issues are in the entangled context of culture, government, and globalization. Accounting for this need, gender and development implements ethnographic research, research that studies a specific culture or group of people by physically immersing the researcher into the environment and daily routine of those being studied, in order to comprehensively understand how development policy and practices affect the everyday life of targeted groups or areas. The history of this field dates back to the 1950s, when studies of economic development first brought women into its discourse, focusing on women only as subjects of welfare policies ‚Äì notably those centered on food aid and family planning. The focus of women in development increased throughout the decade, and by 1962, the United Nations General Assembly called for the Commission on the Status of Women to collaborate with the Secretary General and a number of other UN sectors to develop a longstanding program dedicated to women's advancement in developing countries. A decade later, feminist economist Ester Boserup‚Äôs pioneering book Women‚Äôs Role in Economic Development (1970) was published, radically shifting perspectives of development and contributing to the birth of what eventually became the gender and development field. Since Boserup's consider that development affects men and women differently, the study of gender's relation to development has gathered major interest amongst scholars and international policymakers. The field has undergone major theoretical shifts, beginning with Women in Development (WID), shifting to Women and Development (WAD), and finally becoming the contemporary Gender and Development (GAD). Each of these frameworks emerged as an evolution of its predecessor, aiming to encompass a broader range of topics and social science perspectives. In addition to these frameworks, international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have implemented policies, programs, and research regarding gender and development, contributing a neoliberal and smart economics approach to the study. Examples of these policies and programs include Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs), microfinance, outsourcing, and privatizing public enterprises, all of which direct focus towards economic growth and suggest that advancement towards gender equality will follow. These approaches have been challenged by alternative perspectives such as Marxism and ecofeminism, which respectively reject international capitalism and the gendered exploitation of the environment via science, technology, and capitalist production. Marxist perspectives of development advocate for the redistribution of wealth and power in efforts to reduce global labor exploitation and class inequalities, while ecofeminist perspectives confront industrial practices that accompany development, including deforestation, pollution, environmental degradation, and ecosystem destruction. Early approaches =Women in development (WID)= Theoretical approach The term ‚Äúwomen in development‚Äù was originally coined by a Washington-based network of female development professionals in the early 1970s who sought to question trickle down existing theories of development by contesting that economic development had identical impacts on men and women. The Women in Development movement (WID) gained momentum in the 1970s, driven by the resurgence of women's movements in developed countries, and particularly through liberal feminists striving for equal rights and labour opportunities in the United States. Liberal feminism, postulating that women's disadvantages in society may be eliminated by breaking down customary expectations of women by offering better education to women and introducing equal opportunity programmes, had a notable influence on the formulation of the WID approaches. The focus of the 1970s feminist movements and their repeated calls for employment opportunities in the development agenda meant that particular attention was given to the productive labour of women, leaving aside reproductive concerns and social welfare. This approach was pushed forward by WID advocates, reacting to the general policy environment maintained by early colonial authorities and post- war development authorities, wherein inadequate reference to the work undertook by women as producers was made, as they were almost solely identified as their roles as wives and mothers. The WID's opposition to this ‚Äúwelfare approach‚Äù was in part motivated by the work of Danish economist Ester Boserup in the early 1970s, who challenged the assumptions of the said approach and highlighted the role women by women in the agricultural production and economy. Reeves and Baden (2000) point out that the WID approach stresses the need for women to play a greater role in the development process. According to this perspective, women's active involvement in policymaking will lead to more successful policies overall. Thus, a dominant strand of thinking within WID sought to link women's issues with development, highlighting how such issues acted as impediments to economic growth; this ‚Äúrelevance‚Äù approach stemmed from the experience of WID advocates which illustrated that it was more effective if demands of equity and social justice for women were strategically linked to mainstream development concerns, in an attempt to have WID policy goals taken up by development agencies. The Women in Development approach was the first contemporary movement to specifically integrate women in the broader development agenda and acted as the precursor to later movements such as the Women and Development (WAD), and ultimately, the Gender and Development approach, departing from some of the criticized aspects imputed to the WID. Criticism The WID movement faced a number of criticisms; such an approach had in some cases the unwanted consequence of depicting women as a unit whose claims are conditional on its productive value, associating increased female status with the value of cash income in women's lives. The WID view and similar classifications based on Western feminism, applied a general definition to the status, experiences and contributions of women and the solutions for women in Third World countries. Furthermore, the WID, although it advocated for greater gender equality, did not tackle the unequal gender relations and roles at the basis of women's exclusion and gender subordination rather than addressing the stereotyped expectations entertained by men. Moreover, the underlying assumption behind the call for the integration of the Third World women with their national economy was that women were not already participating in development, thus downplaying women's roles in household production and informal economic and political activities. The WID was also criticized for its views on the fact that women's status will improve by moving into ‚Äúproductive employment‚Äù, implying that the move to the ‚Äúmodern sector‚Äù need to be made from the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù sector to achieve self-advancement, further implying that ‚Äútraditional‚Äù work roles often occupied by women in the developing world were inhibiting to self-development. =Women and development (WAD)= Women and development (WAD) is a theoretical and practical approach to development. It was introduced into gender studies scholarship in the second half of the 1970s, following its origins, which can be traced to the First World Conference on Women in Mexico City in 1975, organized by the UN. It is a departure from the previously predominant theory, WID (Women in Development) and is often mistaken for WID, but has many distinct characteristics. Theoretical approach WAD arose out of a shift in thinking about women's role in development, and concerns about the explanatory limitations of modernization theory.Rathgeber, Eva M. 1990. ‚ÄúWID, WAD, GAD: Trends in Research and Practice.‚Äù The Journal of Developing Areas. 24(4) 289-502 While previous thinking held that development was a vehicle to advance women, new ideas suggested that development was only made possible by the involvement of women, and rather than being simply passive recipients of development aid, they should be actively involved in development projects. WAD took this thinking a step further and suggested that women have always been an integral part of development, and did not suddenly appear in the 1970s as a result of exogenous development efforts. The WAD approach suggests that there be women- only development projects that were theorized to remove women from the patriarchal hegemony that would exist if women participated in development alongside men in a patriarchal culture, though this concept has been heavily debated by theorists in the field. In this sense, WAD is differentiated from WID by way of the theoretical framework upon which it was built. Rather than focus specifically on women's relationship to development, WAD focuses on the relationship between patriarchy and capitalism. This theory seeks to understand women's issues from the perspectives of neo-Marxism and dependency theory, though much of the theorizing about WAD remains undocumented due to the persistent and pressing nature of development work in which many WAD theorists engage. Practical approach The WAD paradigm stresses the relationship between women, and the work that they perform in their societies as economic agents in both the public and domestic spheres. It also emphasizes the distinctive nature of the roles women play in the maintenance and development of their societies, with the understanding that purely the integration of women into development efforts would serve to reinforce the existing structures of inequality present in societies overrun by patriarchal interests. In general, WAD is thought to offer a more critical conceptualization of women's position compared to WID. The WAD approach emphasizes the distinctive nature of women's knowledge, work, goals, and responsibilities, as well as advocating for the recognition of their distinctiveness. This fact, combined with a recognized tendency for development agencies to be dominated by patriarchal interests, is at the root of the women-only initiatives introduced by WAD subscribers. Criticism Some of the common critiques of the WAD approach include concerns that the women-only development projects would struggle, or ultimately fail, due to their scale, and the marginalized status of these women. Furthermore, the WAD perspective suffers from a tendency to view women as a class, and pay little attention to the differences among women (such as feminist concept of intersectionality), including race and ethnicity, and prescribe development endeavors that may only serve to address the needs of a particular group. While an improvement on WID, WAD fails to fully consider the relationships between patriarchy, modes of production, and the marginalization of women. It also presumes that the position of women around the world will improve when international conditions become more equitable. Additionally, WAD has been criticized for its singular preoccupation with the productive side of women's work, while it ignores the reproductive aspect of women's work and lives. Therefore, WID/WAD intervention strategies have tended to concentrate on the development of income-generating activities without taking into account the time burdens that such strategies place on women. Value is placed on income-generating activities, and none is ascribed to social and cultural reproduction. =Gender and development (GAD)= Theoretical approach The Gender and Development (GAD) approach focuses on the socially constructed differences between men and women, the need to challenge existing gender roles and relations, and the creation and effects of class differences on development. This approach was majorly influenced by the writings of academic scholars such as Oakley (1972) and Rubin (1975), who argue the social relationship between men and women have systematically subordinated women, along with economist scholars Lourdes Bener√≠a and Amartya Sen (1981), who assess the impact of colonialism on development and gender inequality. They state that colonialism imposed more than a 'value system' upon developing nations, it introduced a system of economics 'designed to promote capital accumulation which caused class differentiation'. GAD departs from WID, which discussed women's subordination and lack of inclusion in discussions of international development without examining broader systems of gender relations. Influenced by this work, by the late 1970s, some practitioners working in the development field questioned focusing on women in isolation. GAD challenged the WID focus on women as an important ‚Äòtarget group‚Äô and ‚Äòuntapped resources‚Äô for development. GAD marked a shift in thinking about the need to understand how women and men are socially constructed and how ‚Äòthose constructions are powerfully reinforced by the social activities that both define and are defined by them.‚Äô GAD focuses primarily on the gendered division of labor and gender as a relation of power embedded in institutions. Consequently, two major frameworks, ‚ÄòGender roles‚Äô and ‚Äòsocial relations analysis‚Äô, are used in this approach. 'Gender roles' focuses on the social construction of identities within the household; it also reveals the expectations from ‚Äòmaleness and femaleness‚Äô in their relative access to resources. 'Social relations analysis' exposes the social dimensions of hierarchical power relations embedded in social institutions, as well as its determining influence on ‚Äòthe relative position of men and women in society.‚Äô This relative positioning tends to discriminate against women. Unlike WID, the GAD approach is not concerned specifically with women, but with the way in which a society assigns roles, responsibilities and expectations to both women and men. GAD applies gender analysis to uncover the ways in which men and women work together, presenting results in neutral terms of economics and efficiency. In an attempt to create gender equality (denoting women having the same opportunities as men, including ability to participate in the public sphere),Development Assistance Committee (DAC), 1998, p.7 GAD policies aim to redefine traditional gender role expectations. Women are expected to fulfill household management tasks, home-based production as well as bearing and raising children and caring for family members. The role of a wife is largely interpreted as 'the responsibilities of motherhood.' Men, however, are expected to be breadwinners, associated with paid work and market production. In the labor market, women tend to earn less than men. For instance, 'a study by the Equality and Human Rights Commission found massive pay inequities in some United Kingdom's top finance companies, women received around 80 percent less performance-related pay than their male colleagues.' In response to pervasive gender inequalities, Beijing Platform for Action established gender mainstreaming in 1995 as a strategy across all policy areas at all levels of governance for achieving gender equality. GAD has been largely utilized in debates regarding development but this trend is not seen in the actual practice of developmental agencies and plans for development. Caroline Moser claims WID persists due to the challenging nature of GAD, but Shirin M. Rai counters this claim noting that the real issue lies in the tendency to overlap WID and GAD in policy. Therefore, it would only be possible if development agencies fully adopted GAD language exclusively. Caroline Moser developed the Moser Gender Planning Framework for GAD-oriented development planning in the 1980s while working at the Development Planning Unit of the University of London. Working with Caren Levy, she expanded it into a methodology for gender policy and planning. The Moser framework follows the Gender and Development approach in emphasizing the importance of gender relations. As with the WID-based Harvard Analytical Framework, it includes a collection of quantitative empirical facts. Going further, it investigates the reasons and processes that lead to conventions of access and control. The Moser Framework includes gender roles identification, gender needs assessment, disaggregating control of resources and decision making within the household, planning for balancing work and household responsibilities, distinguishing between different aims in interventions and involving women and gender-aware organizations in planning. Criticism GAD has been criticized for emphasizing the social differences between men and women while neglecting the bonds between them and also the potential for changes in roles. Another criticism is that GAD does not dig deeply enough into social relations and so may not explain how these relations can undermine programs directed at women. It also does not uncover the types of trade-offs that women are prepared to make for the sake of achieving their ideals of marriage or motherhood. Another criticism is that the GAD perspective is theoretically distinct from WID, but in practice, programs seem to have elements of both. Whilst many development agencies are now committed to a gender approach, in practice, the primary institutional perspective remain focused on a WID approach. Specifically, the language of GAD has been incorporated into WID programs. There is a slippage in reality where gender mainstreaming is often based in a single normative perspective as synonymous to women. Development agencies still advance gender transformation to mean economic betterment for women. Further criticisms of GAD is its insufficient attention to culture, with a new framework being offered instead: Women, Culture and Development (WCD). This framework, unlike GAD, wouldn't look at women as victims but would rather evaluate the Third World life of women through the context of the language and practice of gender, the Global South, and culture. Neoliberal approaches =Gender and neoliberal development institutions= Neoliberalism consists of policies that will privatize public industry, deregulate any laws or policies that interfere with the free flow of the market and cut back on all social services. These policies were often introduced to many low-income countries through structural adjustment programs (SAPs) by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Neoliberalism was cemented as the dominant global policy framework in the 1980s and 1990s. Among development institutions, gender issues have increasingly become part of economic development agendas, as the examples of the World Bank shows. Awareness by international organizations of the need to address gender issues evolved over the past decades. The World Bank, and regional development banks, donor agencies, and government ministries have provided many examples of instrumental arguments for gender equality, for instance by emphasizing the importance of women's education as a way of increasing productivity in the household and the market. Their concerns have often focused on women's contributions to economic growth rather than the importance of women's education as a means for empowering women and enhancing their capabilities. The World Bank, for example, started focusing on gender in 1977 with the appointment of a first Women in Development Adviser. In 1984 the bank mandated that its programs consider women's issues. In 1994 the bank issued a policy paper on Gender and Development, reflecting current thinking on the subject. This policy aims to address policy and institutional constraints that maintain disparities between the genders and thus limit the effectiveness of development programs.Thirty years after the appointment of a first Women in Development Adviser, a so-called Gender Action Plan was launched to underline the importance of the topic within development strategies and to introduce the new Smart Economics strategy. Gender mainstreaming mandated by the 1995 Beijing Platform for action integrates gender in all aspects of individuals lives in regards to policy development on gender equality.World Bank. An Evaluation of World Bank Support, 2002-08: Gender and Development. Washington, D.C.: World Bank, 2010. IEG Study Ser. Web. The World Bank's Gender Action Plan of 2007-10 is built upon the Bank's gender mainstreaming strategy for gender equality. The Gender Action Plan's objective was advance women's economic empowerment through their participation in land, labor, financial and product markets.World Bank. \\"Gender Equality as Smart Economics: A World Bank Group Gender Action Plan (Fiscal Years 2007-10).\\" IDEAS Working Paper Series from RePEc (2006): IDEAS Working Paper Series from RePEc, 2006. Web. In 2012, the World Development Report was the first report of the series examining Gender Equality and Development. An argument made on the functions behind institutional financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank are that they support capitalist ideals through their means of economic growth of countries globally and their participation in the global economy and capitalist systems. The roles of banks as institutions and the creation of new workers‚Äô economy reflect neoliberal developing ideals is also present in the criticisms on neoliberal developing institutions.Pradella, Lucia, and Thomas Marois. Polarizing Development: Alternatives to Neoliberalism and the Crisis. 2015. Web. Another critique made on the market and institutions is that it contributes to the creation of policies and aid with gender-related outcomes. An argument made on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is that it creates a neoliberal dominance that continues the construction and reconstruction of gender norms by homogenously category women rather than the gender disparities within its policies.Shields, and Wallin.\\"The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's Gender Action Plan and the Gendered Political Economy of Post-Communist Transition.\\" (2015): 383-99. ISSN 1474-7731. Web. = Gender and Outsourcing = One of the features of development encouraged in neoliberal approaches is outsourcing. Outsourcing is when companies from the western world moves some of their business to another country. The reasons these companies make the decision to move is often because of cheap labor costs. Although outsourcing is about businesses it is directly related to gender because it has greatly affected women. The reason it is related to gender is that women are mainly the people that are being hired for these cheap labor jobs and why they are being hired. One example of a popular place for factories to relocate is to China. In China the main people who work in these factories are women, these women move from their home towns to cities far away for the factory jobs. The reasons these women move is to be able to make a wage to take care of not only themselves but their families as well. Oftentimes these women are expected to get these jobs. Another example of a country the garment industry outsources work to is Bangladesh, which has one of the lowest costs of labor compared to other third world countries (see the ILO data provided in figure 1). With low labor costs, there is also poor compliance with labor standards in the factories. The factory workers in Bangladesh can experience several types of violations of their rights. These violations include: long working hours with no choice but to work overtime, deductions to wages, as well as dangerous and unsanitary working conditions. Figure 1 Although the discussions made around outsourcing do not often involve the effects on women, women daily endure constant results from it. Women in countries and areas that may not have been able to work and make their own income now have the opportunity to provide for themselves and their kids. Gender is brought to attention because unemployment is sometimes a threat to women. The reason for it being a threat is because without jobs and their own income women may fall victim to discrimination or abuse. It is very valuable to many women to be able to obtain their own source of income, outsourcing allows women in countries that may not easily obtain a job the opportunity to obtain jobs. Many times factory owners discuss how many women want the jobs they have to offer. With the availability of jobs and the seeming benefits comes a concern for the work conditions in these outsourced jobs. Although some women have acquired a job the work conditions may not be safe or ideal. As mentioned above the jobs are in extreme demand because of how limited opportunities for employment is in certain regions. This leads to the idea of women being disposable at the workplace. As a result of this the workers in these factories do not have room to complain. They also are not able to expect safe working conditions in their work environments. Women have to move far from their hometowns and families to work at these factory jobs. The hours are long and because they are not home they typically also move into dormitories and live at their jobs. = Gender and microfinance = Women have been identified by some development institutions as a key to successful development, for example through financial inclusion. Microcredit is giving small loans to people in poverty without collateral. This was first started by Muhammad Yunus, who formed the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Studies have showed that women are more likely to repay their debt than men, and the Grameen Bank focuses on aiding women. This financial opportunity allows women to start their own businesses for a steady income. Women have been the focus of microcredit for their subsequent increased status as well as the overall well- being of the home being improved when given to women rather than men. There were numerous case studies done in Tanzania about the correlation of the role of SACCoS (savings and credit cooperative organization) and the economic development of the country. The research showed that the microfinance policies were not being carried out in the most efficient ways due to exploitation. One case study went a step further to claim that this financial service could provide a more equal society for women in Tanzania. While there are such cases in which women were able to lift themselves out of poverty, there are also cases in which women fell into a poverty trap as they were unable to repay their loans. It is even said that microcredit is actually an \\"anti- developmental\\" approach. There is little evidence of significant development for these women within the 30 years that the microfinance has been around. In South Africa, unemployment is high due to the introduction of microfinance, more so than it was under apartheid. Microcredit intensified poverty in Johannesburg, South Africa as poor communities, mostly women, who needed to repay debt were forced to work in the informal sector. Some arguments that microcredit is not effective insist that the structure of the economy, with large informal and agriculture sectors, do not provide a system in which borrowers can be successful. In Nigeria, where the informal economy is approximately 45‚Äì60% of economy, women working within it could not attain access to microcredit because of the high demand for loans triggered by high unemployment rates in the formal sector. This study found Nigerian woman are forced into ‚Äúthe hustle‚Äù and enhanced risk of the informal economy, which is unpredictable and contributes to women's inability to repay the loans. Another example from a study conducted in Arampur, Bangladesh, found that microcredit programs within the agrarian community do not effectively help the borrower pay their loan because the terms of the loan are not compatible with farm work. If was found that MFIs force borrowers to repay before the harvesting season starts and in some cases endure the struggles of sharecropping work that is funded by the loan. Although there is debate on how effective microcredit is in alleviating poverty in general, there is an argument that microcredit enables women to participate and fulfill their capabilities in society. For example, a study conducted in Malayasia showed that their version of microcredit, AIM, had a positive effect on Muslim women's empowerment in terms of allowing them to have more control over family planning and over decisions that were made in the home. In contrast, out of a study conducted on 205 different MFIs, they concluded that there is still gender discrimination within microfinance institutions themselves and microcredit which impact the existing discrimination within communities as well. In Bangladesh, another outcome seen for some of the Grameen recipients was that they faced domestic abuse as a result of their husbands feeling threatened about women bringing in more income. A study in Uganda also noted that men felt threatened through increased female financial dominance, increasing women's vulnerability at home. Through the ‚Äúconstructivist feminist standpoint,‚Äù women can understand that the limitations they face are not inherent and in fact, are ‚Äúconstructed‚Äù by traditional gender roles, which they have the ability to challenge through owning their own small business. Through this focus, a study focused on the Foundation for International Community Assistance's (FINCA) involvement and impact in Peru, where women are made aware of the ‚Äúmachismo‚Äù patriarchal culture in which they live through their experiences with building small enterprises. In Rajasthan, India, another study found mixed results for women participating in a microlending program. Though many women were not able to pay back their loans, many were still eager to take on debt because their microfinance participation created a platform to address other inequities within the community. Another example is the Women's Development Business (WDB) in South Africa, a Grameen Bank microfinance replicator. According to WDB, the goal is to ensure ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] that rural women are given the tools to free themselves from the chains of poverty [‚Ä¶]‚Äù through allocation of financial resources directly to women including enterprise development programs. The idea is to use microfinance as a market- oriented tool to ensure access to financial services for disadvantaged and low-income people and therefore fostering economic development through financial inclusion. Diving into another example regarding Microfinance and women from Women Entrepreneurship Promotion in Developing Countries: What explains the gender gap in entrepreneurship and how to close it?is Vossenberg (2013) describes how although there has been an increase in entrepreneurship for women, the gender gap still persists. The author states ‚ÄúThe gender gap is commonly defined as the difference between men and women in terms of numbers engaged in entrepreneurial activity, motives to start or run a business, industry choice and business performance and growth‚Äù (Vossenberg, 2). The article dives into how in Eastern Europe there is a low rate of women entrepreneurs. Although the author discusses how in Africa nearly fifty percent of women make up entrepreneurs.http://web2.msm.nl/RePEc/msm/wpaper/MSM-WP2013-08.pdf As a reaction, a current topic in the feminist literature on economic development is the ‚Äògendering‚Äô of microfinance, as women have increasingly become the target borrowers for rural microcredit lending. This, in turn, creates the assumption of a ‚Äúrational economic woman‚Äù which can exacerbate existing social hierarchies). Therefore, the critique is that the assumption of economic development through microfinance does not take into account all possible outcomes, especially the ones affecting women. The impact of programs of the Bretton Woods Institutions and other similar organizations on gender are being monitored by Gender Action, a watchdog group founded in 2002 by Elaine Zuckerman who is a former World Bank economist. =Gender, financial crises, and neoliberal economic policy= The global financial crisis and the following politics of austerity have opened up a wide range of gender and feminist debates on neoliberalism and the impact of the crisis on women. One view is that the crisis has affected women disproportionately and that there is a need for alternative economic structures in which investment in social reproduction needs to be given more weight. The International Labour Organization (ILO) assessed the impact of the global financial crisis on workers and concluded that while the crisis initially affected industries that were dominated by male workers (such as finance, construction and manufacturing) it then spread over to sectors in which female workers are predominantly active. Examples for these sectors are the service sector or wholesale-retail trade. There are different views among feminists on whether neoliberal economic policies have more positive or negative impacts on women. In the post-war era, feminist scholars such as Elizabeth Wilson criticized state capitalism and the welfare state as a tool to oppress women. Therefore, neoliberal economic policies featuring privatization and deregulation, hence a reduction of the influence of the state and more individual freedom was argued to improve conditions for women. This anti-welfare state thinking arguably led to feminist support for neoliberal ideas embarking on a macroeconomic policy level deregulation and a reduced role of the state. Therefore, some scholars in the field argue that feminism, especially during its second wave, has contributed key ideas to Neoliberalism that, according to these authors, creates new forms of inequality and exploitation. As a reaction to the phenomenon that some forms of feminism are increasingly interwoven with capitalism, many suggestions on how to name these movements have emerged in the feminist literature. Examples are ‚Äòfree market feminism‚Äô or even ‚Äòfaux- feminism‚Äô. =Smart economics= Theoretical approaches Advocated chiefly by the World Bank, smart economics is an approach to define gender equality as an integral part of economic development and it aims to spur development through investing more efficiently in women and girls. It stresses that the gap between men and women in human capital, economic opportunities, and voice/agency is a chief obstacle in achieving more efficient development. As an approach, it is a direct descendant of the efficiency approach taken by WID which ‚Äúrationalizes ‚Äòinvesting‚Äô in women and girls for more effective development outcomes.‚Äù As articulated in the section of WID, the efficiency approach to women in development was chiefly articulated by Caroline Moser in the late 1980s. Continuing the stream of WID, smart economics‚Äô key unit of analysis is women as individual and it particularly focuses on measures that promote to narrow down the gender gap. Its approach identifies women are relatively underinvested source of development and it defines gender equality an opportunity of higher return investment. ‚ÄúGender equality itself is here depicted as smart economics, in that it enables women to contribute their utmost skills and energies to the project of world economic development.‚Äù In this term, smart economics champions neoliberal perspective in seeing business as a vital vehicle for change and it takes a stance of liberal feminism. The thinking behind smart economics dates back, at least, to the lost decade of the Structural Adjustment Policies (SAPs) in the 1980s. In 1995, World Bank issued its flagship publication on gender matters of the year Enhancing Women's Participation in Economic Development (World Bank 1995). This report marked a critical foundation to the naissance of Smart Economics; in a chapter entitled ‚ÄòThe Pay-offs to Investing in Women,‚Äô the Bank proclaimed that investing in women ‚Äúspeeds economic development by raising productivity and promoting the more efficient use of resources; it produces significant social returns, improving child survival and reducing fertility, and it has considerable intergenerational pay-offs.‚Äù The Bank also emphasized its associated social benefits generated by investing in women. For example, the Bank turned to researches of Whitehead that evidenced a greater female-control of household income is associated with better outcomes for children's welfare and Jeffery and Jeffery who analyzed the positive correlation between female education and lower fertility rates. In the 2000s, the approach of smart economics came to be further crystallized through various frameworks and initiatives. A first step was World Bank's Gender Action Plan (GAP) 2007-/2010, followed by the ‚ÄúThree Year Road Map for Gender Mainstreaming 2010-13.‚Äù The 2010-13 framework responded to criticisms for its precursor and incorporated some shifts in thematic priorities. Lastly but not least, the decisive turning point was 2012 marked by its publication of ‚ÄúWorld Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development.‚Äù This Bank's first comprehensive focus on the gender issues was welcomed by various scholars and practitioners, as an indicator of its seriousness. For example, Shahra Razavi appraised the report as ‚Äòa welcome opportunity for widening the intellectual space‚Äô. Other international organizations, particular UN families, have so far endorsed the approach of smart economics. Examining the relationship between child well-being and gender equality, for example, UNICEF also referred to the ‚ÄúDouble Dividend of Gender Equality.‚Äù Its explicit link to a wider framework of the Millennium Development Goals (where the Goal 3 is Promoting Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment) claimed a wider legitimacy beyond economic efficiency. In 2007, the Bank proclaimed that ‚ÄúThe business case for investing in MDG 3 is strong; it is nothing more than smart economics.‚Äù In addition, ‚ÄúDevelopment organisations and governments have been joined in this focus on the ‚Äòbusiness case‚Äô for gender equality and the empowerment of women, by businesses and enterprises which are interested in contributing to social good.‚Äù A good example is ‚ÄúGirl Effect initiative‚Äù taken by Nike Foundation. Its claim for economic imperative and a broader socio-economic impact also met a strategic need of NGOs and community organizations that seeks justification for their program funding. Thus, some NGOs, for example Plan International, captured this trend to further their program. The then-president of the World Bank Robert B. Zoellick was quoted by Plan International in stating ‚ÄúInvesting in adolescent girls is precisely the catalyst poor countries need to break intergenerational poverty and to create a better distribution of income. Investing in them is not only fair, it is a smart economic move.‚Äù The global financial meltdown and austerity measures taken by major donor counties further supported this approach, since international financial institutions and international NGOs received a greater pressure from donors and from global public to design and implement maximally cost-effective programs. Criticisms From the mid-2000s, the approach of smart economics and its chief proponent ‚ÄìWorld Bank‚Äì met a wide range of criticisms and denouncements. These discontents can be broadly categorized into three major claims; Subordination of Intrinsic Value; Ignorance for the need of systemic transformation; Feminisation of responsibility; Overemphasized efficiency; and Opportunistic pragmatism. This is not exhaustive list of criticisms, but the list aims to highlight different emphasis among existing criticisms. The World Bank's gender policy aims to eliminate poverty and enhance economic growth by addressing gender disparities and inequalities that hinders development. A critique on the World Bank's gender policy is it being ‚Äògender-blind‚Äô and not properly addressing gender inequity.‚ÄúA Citizen‚Äôs Guide to Gender and the World Bank.‚Äù Women‚Äôs International Network News, vol. 23, no. 1, Winter 1997, p.8. http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=aph&AN;=9702066185&site;=ehost- live&scope;=site Rather a critique made is that the World Bank's gender policy utilizes gender equality as an ends means rather than analyzing root causes for economic disparities and gender equity.Mahon, Rianne. ‚ÄúIntroduction: The World Bank‚Äôs New Approach to Gender Equality?‚Äù Global Social Policy, vol. 12, no. 2, Aug. 2012, pp. 173‚Äì174, doi:10.1177/1468018112443673. Smart economics‚Äô subordination of women under the justification of development invited fierce criticisms. Chant expresses her grave concern that ‚ÄúSmart economics is concerned with building women‚Äôs capacities in the interests of development rather than promoting women‚Äôs rights for their own sake.‚Äù She disagrees that investment in women should be promoted by its instrumental utility: ‚Äúit is imperative to ask whether the goal of female investment is primarily to promote gender equality and women‚Äôs ‚Äòempowerment‚Äô, or to facilitate development ‚Äòon the cheap‚Äô, and/or to promote further economic liberalization.‚Äù Although smart economics outlines that gender equality has intrinsic value (realizing gender equality is an end itself) and instrumental value (realizing gender equality is a means to a more efficient development), many points out that the Bank pays almost exclusive attentions to the latter in defining its framework and strategy. Zuckerman also echoed this point by stating ‚Äúbusiness case [which] ignores the moral imperative of empowering women to achieve women‚Äôs human rights and full equal rights with men.‚Äù In short, Chant casts a doubt that if it is not ‚Äúpossible to promote rights through utilitarianism.‚Äù A wide range of scholars and practitioners has criticized that smart economics rather endorse the current status-quo of gender inequality and keep silence for the demand of institutional reform. Its approach ‚Äú[d]oes not involves public action to transform the laws, policies, and practices which constrain personal and group agency.‚Äù Naila Kabeer also posits that ‚Äúattention to collective action to enable women to challenge structural discrimination has been downplayed.‚Äù Simply, smart economics assumes that women are entirely capable of increasingly contributing for economic growth amid the ongoing structural barriers to realize their capabilities. Sylvia Chant (2008) discredited its approach as ‚Äòfeminisation of responsibility and/or obligation‚Äô where the smart economics intends to spur growth simply by demanding more from women in terms of time, labour, energy, and other resources. She also agrees that ‚ÄúSmart economics seeks to use women and girls to fix the world.‚Äù She further goes by clarifying that ‚ÄúIt is less welcome to women who are already contributing vast amounts to both production and unpaid reproduction to be romanticised and depicted as the salvation of the world.‚Äù Chant is concerned that ‚ÄúAn efficiency-driven focus on young women and girls as smart economics leaves this critical part of the global population out.‚Äù Smart economics assumes that all women are at their productive stage and fallaciously neglects lives of the elderly women, or women with handicaps. Thus she calls for recognition of ‚Äúequal rights of all women and girls -regardless of age, or the extent of nature of their economic contribution.‚Äù Also, its approach does not talk about cooperation and collaboration between males and females thus leaving men and boys completely out of picture. Chant emphasize that ‚ÄúThe smart economics approach represents, at best, pragmatism in a time of economic restructuring and austerity.‚Äù Smart economics can have a wider acceptance and legitimacy because now is the time when efficiency is most demanded, not because its utilitarianism has universal appeal. She further warns that feminists should be very cautious about \\"supporting, and working in coalition with, individuals and institutions who approach gender equality through the lens of smart economics. This may have attractions in strategic terms, enabling us to access resources for work focusing on supporting the individual agency of women and girls, but risks aggravating many of the complex problems that gender and development seeks to transform.\\" Alternative Approaches Other approaches with different paradigms have also played a historically important role in advancing theories and practices in gender and development. =Marxism and Neo-Marxism= The structuralist debate was first triggered by Marxist and socialist feminists. Marxism, particularly through alternative models of state socialist development practiced in China and Cuba, challenged the dominant liberal approach over time. Neo-Marxist proponents focused on the role of the post- colonial state in development in general and also on localized class struggles. Marxist feminists advanced these criticisms towards liberal approaches and made significant contribution to the contemporary debate. =Dependency theory= Dependency theorists opposed that liberal development models, including the attempt to incorporate women into the existing global capitalism, was, in fact, nothing more than the \\"development of underdevelopment.\\" This view led them to propose that delinking from the structural oppression of global capitalism is the only way to achieve balanced human development. In the 1980s, there also emerged \\"a sustained questioning by post-structuralist critics of the development paradigm as a narrative of progress and as an achievable enterprise.\\" =Basic Needs Approach, Capability Approach, and Ecofeminism= Within the liberal paradigm of women and development, various criticism have emerged. The Basic Needs (BN) approach began to pose questions to the focus on growth and income as indicators of development. It was heavily influenced by Sen and Nussbaum's capability approach, which was more gender sensitive than BN and focused on expanding human freedom. The BN particularly proposed a participatory approach to development and challenged the dominant discourse of trickle down effects. These approaches focused on the human freedom led to development of other important concepts such as human development and human security. From a perspective of sustainable development, ecofeminists articulated the direct link between colonialism and environmental degradation, which resulted in degradation of women's lives themselves.

It was built in 1759 for George Heron. The house is constructed in a Georgian style in brown brick with stone dressings, and has a slate roof. It has three storeys and seven bays with a stone plinth and stone bands between the storeys. Framing the middle three bays are rusticated pilasters, and similar quoins at the corners. All the windows are sash windows. Along the top of the house is a plain parapet, with a pediment above the central three bays. The house is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. Built in 1759 for George Heron the hall descended in the Heron family until 1850, when it became the property of Samuel Beckett Chadwick. By 1892 it had been acquired by Sir Gilbert Greenall, later Baron Daresbury. During the Second World War it was used as a military hospital and for some years from 1955 by a charity, now known as Scope, as a residential home for handicapped people. It became semi-derelict after being bought by a millionaire who died before restoration could take place. In April 2015, a huge cannabis farm containing six hundred plants with an estimated street value of ¬£750, 000 was discovered at the former county mansion in an annex at the estate.

He is the author of The Myth of Choice: Personal Responsibility in a World of Limits and The Failure of Corporate Law: Fundamental Flaws and Progressive Possibilities, published by University of Chicago Press in 2006, and numerous scholarly articles. He is best known for his \\"stakeholder\\" critique of the conventional legal doctrine and theory of corporate law, and for his leadership in a legal battle between law schools and the Pentagon over free speech and gay rights. Early life and career Greenfield spent most of his childhood in Princeton, Kentucky, where his father worked as a Baptist minister and his mother as a school teacher. Greenfield earned an A.B. in economics and history with honors from Brown University in 1984. After graduating, he worked as a corporate policy advisor at Levi Strauss & Co. in San Francisco, and traveled through South America. Greenfield graduated with honors from the University of Chicago Law School in 1992 where he served as Topics and Comments Editor of the University of Chicago Law Review and became a member of the Order of the Coif. Upon graduation, he practiced at the law firm Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C. Professional career Kent Greenfield clerked for Justice David H. Souter of the United States Supreme Court and Judge Levin H. Campbell of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit before joining the law faculty at Boston College in 1995. He was Visiting Professor of Law at the University of Connecticut School of Law in 2002, Visiting Wallace S. Fujiyama Professor at University of Hawai‚Äôi William S. Richardson School of Law in 2005, and Visiting Professor of Political Science at Brown University in 2006. From 2007 to 2008, he served as the Distinguished Faculty Fellow at the Center on Corporations, Law and Society, at the Seattle University School of Law. He has also served as chair of the Business Associations Section of the American Association of Law Schools. In 2002, Greenfield became involved with a number of legal academics who believed the federal government's policy of excluding gay, lesbian, and bisexual people from service in the military under \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" conflicted with law schools' non-discrimination policies. Law schools typically require potential employers to sign pledges that they will not discriminate against students on various grounds. Recruiters from the military services refused to sign those pledges, and under the so-called Solomon Amendment, law schools and their parent universities stood to lose federal funding federal if they failed to permit military recruiters equal access to recruiting facilities. Greenfield founded and served as the president of the Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights (FAIR), an organization of over thirty law schools and other institutions, which was the named plaintiff in a lawsuit to contest the Solomon Amendment. The suit won in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit but was overturned by the Supreme Court on March 6, 2006. Multiple news outlets, including the New York Times, the Boston Globe, and the Wall Street Journal, have covered Kent Greenfield's activism with FAIR. Scholarship The Failure of Corporate Law was called \\"simply the best and most well-reasoned progressive critique of corporate law yet written\\" by professor Joseph Singer of Harvard Law School. Professor Singer also noted Failure for challenging conventional wisdom and seeking to broaden the scope of corporate management. Greenfield has published journal articles in the Yale Law Journal, the Virginia Law Review, the Boston College Law Review, the George Washington Law Review, the Tulane Law Review, and others. Greenfield has lectured and presented at numerous institutions nationally and internationally, including at Harvard University, Yale University, Brown University, Stanford University, the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan, and the London School of Economics. Greenfield's second book The Myth of Choice, forthcoming in October 2011 from Yale University Press, probes the role of free choice theory in American law, sociology, economics, and political theory. Greenfield uses anecdotes, hard data, and judicial opinions to draw inferences about choice in American society and offer policy recommendations and personal advice. Noah Feldman has written that The Myth of Choice unsettles our beliefs, our judgments, and our values. Criticism Greenfield's \\"stakeholder\\" critique of the conventional theory of corporate law has been criticized for undercutting economic efficiency. Critics argue that the stakeholder theory of corporate governance would damage the American economy by inducing capital to escape the added costs of accountability to more players than corporate shareholders.

The hospital was originally built in 1910, with several additions up until 1958. The hospital eventually merged with Northwestern Hospital in 1970 to form Abbott Northwestern Hospital, and the Abbott Hospital building closed in 1980. While the Abbott Hospital building is a contributing property to the Stevens Square Historic District, a separate listing was desired for the hospital because of its significance within the development of the health care system in Minneapolis. For that reason, a separate nomination was prepared and submitted, and the hospital was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 1, 2011. Founding Dr. Amos W. Abbott was born in 1844 in India, the son of missionary parents from New Hampshire. He moved to Minneapolis in 1877, where his sister lived. He maintained a private practice, and in 1887, he started renting houses where he could treat patients. He was never able to treat more than eight patients at a time, though. He practiced at Saint Barnabas Hospital, Saint Mary's Hospital, and Northwestern Hospital, but never was able to provide boarding for those patients. In 1902, he founded Abbott's Hospital for Women in a large house in the Stevens Square neighborhood. In 1910, he was able to establish his own hospital building with the backing of William Dunwoody, a wealthy businessman. Dunwoody's wife Kate had been one of Abbott's patients. Construction history The building was constructed in five sections, each of which reflects the health care practices of the times in which they were built. =Dunwoody= The original section of the hospital was named after William Hood Dunwoody. It was designed by architect William Channing Whitney and built in 1910. As originally built, the main entrance was a two-story brick and stone portico, with the doors on the porch on the second story. The main entrance was later relocated and the stairway was later removed. The original building had only 30 beds, so Dr. Abbott was able to personally oversee all of the patients. His motto was, ‚ÄúMake the patients comfortable and make them feel at home.‚Äù There were no communal wards. Instead, patients had single- and double-occupancy rooms. The Minneapolis Journal commented on the hospital's ‚Äúsun rooms, silent signal systems, spacious corridors, pleasing decorations and light and air in abundance.‚Äù Dunwoody owned the building and the land. When he died in 1914, he left the hospital with a $100,000 endowment and transferred ownership of the property to Westminster Presbyterian Church. =Janney Children's Pavilion= The first addition to the structure was the Janney Children's Pavilion, named after Thomas B. Janney, who funded its construction. This addition was four stories in height and had a flat roof. It was built in 1919-1920 and designed by William Kenyon and Francis Maine. When this section was built, the main entrance of the hospital was relocated to a recessed doorway on the first story of the west facade. Unlike the Dunwoody building, the Janney addition had a flat roof and a more modern design, resembling the style, massing, and setback of the apartment buildings around Stevens Square. The demand for pediatrics and obstetrics had been expanding. The pediatric unit had been located on the south side of the second floor of the Dunwoody building, but it often overflowed into other areas. At this time, there were four pediatricians working in the hospital: Dr. Julius Sedgwick, Dr. Nate Pearce, Dr. Rood Taylor, and Dr. Frederick C. Rodda. The Children's Pavilion was announced at a board of trustees' meeting in September 1919, when Janney provided a donation estimated between $200,000 and $330,000. Janney was another successful Minneapolis businessman. He was a founder of the hardware firm Janney, Semple, Hill and Company, and he also was president of Farmers and Mechanics Savings Bank and a director of Northwestern National Bank. When the addition was complete, the hospital had a capacity of 100 beds. =Wyman= The Wyman addition was an expansion built in 1938 and named after its major donor, Oliver C. Wyman. It was designed by Magney and Tusler, a prominent Minnesota architecture firm. Oliver C. Wyman was the president of Wyman, Partridge, and Company, as well as chairman of the board of directors at Northwestern National Bank and a vice president and trustee at Farmers and Mechanics Savings Bank. Through these connections, Janney and Wyman became friends, and Janney convinced Wyman to make a large donation in his will to Abbott Hospital. When he died in 1923, he left $500,000 to the trustees to be used at their ‚Äúdiscretion for the erection of a General Hospital to stand connected with those created by his friends.‚Äù The hospital had some financial difficulties in expanding, however. The previous administration of the hospital had not kept any set of business records, and no one at the hospital was skilled in business administration. In 1922, Westminster's Hospital Committee took notice, and decided to install a proper set of bookkeeping and administration at the hospital. They hired a business manager, and in 1925, they handed over management of the hospital to a committee of doctors and administrators. Dr. Abbott was named chief of staff in June 1925. He remained in this role for a short time before his death in February 1927, at the age of 83. Because of the financial difficulties, the trustees were cautious about expansion. Victor Anderson, the business manager, had proposed a 200- to 250-bed facility in 1927, but the projected construction costs were higher than expected. A study of the potential use of the new space, presented in October 1930, revealed that Minneapolis had too many hospital beds after a construction boom in the 1920s. In 1936, the demand for hospital beds had become favorable enough to build a new wing to the hospital. Magney and Tusler reworked some earlier plans to meet the latest standards in hospital architecture, while retaining a harmonious appearance on the outside by using brick similar to the Dunwoody and Janney wings and by using similar size and massing to the nearby apartment buildings. The Wyman wing was completed in September 1938 and added sixty beds to the hospital. The first floor of the addition was devoted to administrative and staff functions, and also contained the kitchen and dining rooms for the entire hospital. The second and third floors housed patient rooms, and the fourth floor had four operating rooms, an X-ray lab, and other laboratories. =Janney Pavilion Addition= Magney and Tusler returned to design the Janney Pavilion Addition in 1954. The corridor between Dunwoody and the Janney Children's Pavilion was expanded, and an addition was completed on the south side of the Dunwoody building. =Stevens Addition= In 1957, the final hospital addition was completed. This was designed by Magney, Tusler and Setter, which had gained an additional partner. The section was built on the east end of the Wyman building and named for Stevens Avenue South, which borders the east side of the property. Later history In 1964, the Westminster Presbyterian Church voted to transfer the ownership of the hospital to a new corporation, known as Abbott Hospital Incorporated. The church made this decision to prevent the church from loss of its assets or property in case of a disaster at the hospital. In 1970, Abbott Hospital merged with Northwestern Hospital, but did not consolidate their facilities until 1980. The plan resulted from an analysis that the separate campuses needed improvements. By consolidating facilities, the combined corporation could gain greater operating efficiency. The construction costs were projected at $24 million, and other costs were projected at $14 million. The Abbott campus was too small to continue supporting its level of services effectively, and a fairly large expansion would have been necessary. The Ebenezer Society agreed in 1978 to buy the main Abbott building and operate it as a nursing home, as well as providing other programs for the elderly. Those programs ceased in 2004 after which the building sat abandoned. After a failed attempt to renovate the building into a condominium tower, work began in 2012 to renovate the original building into apartments. Now called the Historic Abbott Apartments, residents began moving in 2014.

In this alternate world story, workers are rare people with magical abilities that sometimes run in families. Using their abilities requires skin contact and is illegal, which is why most workers are part of crime families. About 10% of the population are workers. There are 7 types of workers. Of those, about 60% are luck workers, while other skills, such as death working, emotion working, memory working, dream working and physical working less common. The rarest type of worker is a transformation worker: they can transform anything into something else. Plot Although Cassel Sharpe comes from a large family of workers who are well connected to one of the major crime families, he believes himself to have no worker abilities. He is the youngest son with a mother in prison for illegally emotionally working people, a dead father, a death-worker grandfather, and two older brothers who work for the nephew and current heir of one of the biggest crime families in the area. Cassel's friend Lila was the daughter of the crime lord and other possible heir, but Cassel believes he killed her when they were fourteen. Now seventeen, Cassel finds himself sleepwalking up on the roof at his prep school, dreaming of a white cat and nearly dies getting back down. This bizarre occurrence, the strange behavior of his brothers, and overheard conversations make Cassel suspicious that he's being manipulated, and he goes to a fortune teller to get amulets to protect himself from memory alteration, which he cuts and conceals inside his leg. Further investigation leads Cassel to discover that his brothers had been keeping a white cat just like the one from his dreams, which is now free and following him around. He knows that transformation workers are very rare, but wonders if it could in fact be his \\"dead\\" friend Lila, who has the ability to work dreams. The cat is captured again and taken to the pound, so he rescues it, certain that something strange is going on. Shortly after, he discovers that one of the rocks under his skin has broken, and that his second oldest brother Barron has been manipulating Cassel's memories. He also finds out that he is a worker after all; a transformation worker. His brothers have been using him by making him change people into lifeless objects, effectively murdering them, and his brothers have also been altering his memory to keeping Cassel from remembering that he is a transformation working who has killed people (at their direction). With this discovery, Cassel changes the white cat back into Lila. The two plan to reunite her with her father and allow her to take back her place as heir by revealing her cousin Anton's plan of killing her father and running the family himself. It succeeds, and things go mostly back to normal for Cassel despite his new-found ability. Lila still hates him for turning her into a cat, but when he arrives home from school a week later, she is waiting for him, having forgiven him. They kiss, which Cassel has always dreamed of, but are interrupted by a phone call from his mother, newly out of jail. His mother wants to surprise him with the news that she met Lila in New York and used her emotion ability to make Lila fall madly in love with Cassel. He demands she undo it, but his mother claims she cannot, and Cassel realizes that he was a mark himself, gullible enough to believe that Lila would forgive him and love him so easily. Reception White Cat received mostly positive reviews. Kirkus Reviews called Black's work \\"a dark, complex Chinese puzzle box, full of cons, criminals and curses\\" with expected sequels to be \\"equally compelling.\\" Kirkus concluded by encouraging readers to get the book: \\"Urban fantasy, con story, coming of age‚Äîwhatever you call it, read it.\\" Others followed with similar sentiments, including the reviewer \\"Jia\\" from DearAuthor.com: \\"I don‚Äôt know where we‚Äôre going from here, and I‚Äôd like to say that the ending was completely heartbreaking, but I‚Äôm definitely along for the ride.\\" Andrea Chettle of Fantasy Book Review stated, \\"I loved this book. I read it in three days and then wished I hadn't. I really didn't want to leave the world or the characters.\\" Others delivered somewhat mixed reviews. Maureen Speller, speaking of White Cat, said that while some novels \\"seem to work well enough for the first reading, subsequent readings reveal faults so glaring one wonders how on earth one missed them before.\\"  References   External links  Review in the School Library Journal * Review in the Manila Bulletin * Publisher's Weekly Category:2010 British novels Category:British young adult novels ","title":"White Cat (novel)"},{"id":"32105495","text":"McMurphy, and its variants Murphy, Morrow and MacMurrough, are anglicisations of the Irish language surname Mac Murchaidh, which belonged to a clan found in County Armagh in the 17th century. There are different origins than the Wexford, Cork and Fermanagh County septs (see Murphy and Morrow). The origins of the Gaelic surnames Morrow and Murphy as given by Rev. Patrick Woulfe. Overview The name Murchadh comes from the Irish words muir (meaning \\"sea\\") and cath (meaning \\"battle\\"). The name therefore comes to mean \\"Sea Warrior\\" and has been used in Ireland and Scotland the clan in Scotland is of Irish origin. Over time the name has been Anglicised as Murchison, Murphy, Morrow, Morrowson, MacMurphy, MacMorrow, Murrow and MacMurchie but most commonly as Murphy and Morrow and most famously as MacMurrough. The names McMurchie, Murchison and Murphy normally come from Murchaidh, pronounced roughly Murahy whereas Morrow and Murrow tend to come from Murchadha, pronounced roughly Morahoe. Origins of the clan in Ulster McMurphy was the surname of a branch of the Cen√©l nE√≥gain. They were originally native to the district of Munterbirn (now in the barony of Dungannon) and Tullyanvey (Tellach Ainbhith, in the neighbouring barony of Strabane), where they were chiefs of Siol Aodha, the \\"seed of Hugh\\". Their eponymous ancestor was one Murchad of this sept, who was alive in the 10th or 11th century. Pedigree The Clann Birnn's pedigree is Bern mac Ruadr√≠ mac Murchad mac M√°el D√∫in mac √Åeda All√°in. Their co- relatives are McRory and O'Friel. McMurphy of Munterbirn The earliest reference to the name occurs in 1172, when \\"Mulmaire McMurphy, lord of Munterbirn, was slain by Hugh Magennis and the Clan Hugh of the Iveagh of Ulster\\" (Maol Maire Mac Murchadha toiseach Muinntire Birn do mharbhadh la h-Aedh Mac Aenghusa agus la Cloinn Aeda do Uibh Eachdach Uladh). The Fews However, the McMurphy's were forcibly disposed and driven out by their more powerful O'Neill kinsmen, sometime in the 13th century. They subsequently settled in the highlands of south Armagh, ousting families such as Garvey, Hanratty and Callaghan. Over the course of the next two hundred years, the Tyrone O'Neill's would expand into The Fews and make the McMurphy their vassals again. By the end of the 15th century they were centered on Dunreavey Wood. A fiant of 1602 names some one hundred and seventy free clansmen of the Fews, of whom thirty-five were McMurphy's. The Plantation and after The townlands of Cashell and Legacroon in the barony of Orier were granted to McMurphy's c. 1610, but were seized by the time of Down Survey. There were seven McMurphy landholders in 1659, and twelve in 1664. The Hearth Money Roll of the same year lists several bearers of the name in Dorsey, Legmoylan, and Creggan, though none in Carnally. A census of 1766 listed at least eight families of the name in Carnally by that year. During the plantation, many Morrows came to Armagh from Scotland who were of the Scottish branch of MacMurchadha and mixed with the local families of MacMurchadha and MacMurchaidh.The Morrows and related families by Dr. John T. Morrow Since the 17th century, MacMurchadha and MacMurchaidh have become anglicised as Morrow and MacMurphy or Murphy respectively. In Ulster, bearers of the name are found in their greatest concentrations in County Armagh, with similar numbers in County Fermanagh and County Monaghan. 21st century Murphy is the single most common Irish surname. However, most Murphy's elsewhere in Ireland are unrelated, being descendants of various other Mac Murchaidh, Mac Murchadha, and √ì Murchadha families. Morrow's may stem from both the Scottish branch of MacMurchadha or from any of the Irish branches, and also from the Scottish name MacMuireadhaigh and tend to be also referred to as Scotch-Irish (or Scots-Irish) as well as Irish.Dr. John T.

The institute is under the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology of Nigeria. History The institute replaced the West African Building Research Institute which was established in 1952 by building professionals from Ghana and Nigeria in Accra, Ghana. Membership of the institute was made up of building engineers from both countries. When Nigeria gained independence from Britain, the Nigerian members of the institute left the West African Building Research Institute to form the Nigerian Building and Road Research Institute in 1978. The Ghanaian members formed the Building Research Institute of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences. Locations The headquarters of NBRRI is in Abuja, Nigeria. There are four zonal offices that facilitates the institutes activities. They are: #Eastern Zonal Office in Anambra State #Western Zonal Office in Ikoyi, Lagos #Northern Zonal Office in Kano, Kano State #National Liboratory & Production Complex in Otta, Ogun State Nation building The institute engages the Government of Nigeria on various policies that regulate and improve the quality of buildings in Nigeria. In May, 2011 the Federal Government of Nigeria announced that it would empower the Nigerian Building and Road Research Institute to set up a Material Testing Laboratory to be cited in the Federal Capital Territory. The testing lab was to provide a facility for the testing of building material before use. The facility had become necessary due to the regular occurrence of collapsing buildings. The facility was to function as research and education centre for tertiary institutions and the construction industry. Collaborations NBRRI has research collaboration with other state and foreign agencies. In 2009, the institutes and its Ghanaian counterpart signed a memorandum of understanding to research into building and road construction materials. In June 2011, the NBRRI announced it was partnering with the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria for the construction of 1,000 housing units every federal state of Nigeria. The partnership required that all the buildings be constructed using alternative building materials that had been developed by the institute. Achievements The institute in March, 2011 that it had developed a new technology for the moulding of bricks known as cement stabilized bricks technology. The new technology was to reduce the cost of building due to a cheap alternative building material that the technology used in the production of bricks.

The Johnson design was developed by the British engineer J. Johnson in the late 1920s. A patent was granted in 1931, and one of these boilers was installed in the . This was a time when water-tube boilers were being adopted in fast turbine ships, such as naval warships and passenger liners. There was also a shift to oil firing rather than coal burning. Oil had several advantages for a fast ship, particularly a warship that needed to combine both efficiency for long range with the ability to generate high power on demand when full speed was needed. Oil required fewer stokers, and a smaller crew required less space aboard given over to mess spaces. Refuelling was also quicker and cleaner with oil than with coal. The Johnson boiler was the first of the O-type boilers, a class of water-tube boilers characterised by single steam and water drums vertically above each other, with curved vertical water tubes to the sides forming an overall cylindrical volume. There is no grate at the base of this furnace space, so they are fired by liquid burners, rather than a solid fuel furnace producing ash. The large radiant heating area available allows a combustion rate, for a given furnace volume, of around twice that for a contemporary boiler, such as the Yarrow. The end walls of the furnace may be either water walls with more tubes, or else simple firebrick. The small amount of brickwork for the Johnson design, without requiring a furnace base, was seen as an advantage by the Navy. The Royal Navy trialled a Johnson boiler in 1936, when the H-class destroyer was built with two Admiralty 3-drum boilers and a Johnson, rather than the three Admiralties used for the rest of the class. This boiler had a water wall at the non-firing end. The initial design had poor circulation until external cold downcomers were added, increasing the weight by 10%.  Babcock-Johnson boilers  , and her sister ship , were both four-funnelled liners refitted in 1937 with Babcock-Johnson boilers and only two funnels The Babcock-Johnson is the developed form of the Johnson design, constructed by Babcock. The end walls of the furnace are tube-walled and there are large external downcomers. The boiler and its exhaust uptake is enclosed in an overall downward air duct, supplied through an air preheater in the exhaust stack. Early versions of this design used a thick tube nest, split into two layers and with the superheater placed as axially-parallel tubes between these. Later designs had thinner tube nests of only four rows of tubes, with the superheater placed in the uptake to the funnel. Working conditions would be '850/850', with a working pressure of and a steam temperature of . The superheater would be placed in one side of the uptake, with a reheater between the high and low pressure turbines placed in the other.  Fairfield-Johnson boilers  The Fairfield-Johnson boiler is a further development of the Babcock-Johnson type. The working pressure of the boiler is reduced from around 58 bar to 30 bar, but the steam temperature after the supheater remains the same at around . The engineering change for these boilers is to reduce the work done in the boiler's steam generating tubes, in favour of increased superheating. Radiant heating of the boiler tubes is the same, but there is less convective heat transfer, giving a higher superheater gas inlet temperature.

Early life Hugh Clark was educated at Bancroft School, Woodford Green, Hertford Grammar School and at King's College, University of Durham. He was commissioned into the Royal Artillery in July 1943 and later transferred to the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry and was posted to the 2nd Ox and Bucks (the 52nd) in September 1944. The 2nd Ox and Bucks was a Gliderborne Battalion, part of 6 Airlanding Brigade, 6 Airborne Division. He served with 2nd Ox and Bucks during the Ardennes Campaign and in the Netherlands from December 1944 to February 1945. Operation Varsity Clark was a platoon commander during Operation Varsity: the air assault landing over the River Rhine on 24 March 1945. The 2nd Ox and Bucks encountered fierce enemy opposition and sustained 50% casualties during the battle of the landing area. Clark's platoon was tasked to capture a road bridge over the River Issel and having captured the bridge came under heavy attack by enemy tanks and infantry which caused casualties and forced the platoon from its position. Clark immediately led the remnants of his platoon in a counter-attack with fixed bayonets to recapture the bridge; during the action he also manned anti-tank weapons to stop approaching tanks. An extract from the citation for his Military Cross reads: \\" It was entirely due to the determination and rapid action of this officer that a very important bridge was denied falling intact to the enemy. His courage and leadership inspired his whole platoon. \\" He then took part in the advance across Germany to the Baltic Sea.

This in turn affects the ability to understand speech in the presence of background noise.Cameron S and Dillon H; The Listening in Spatialized Noise ‚Äì Sentences Test: Comparison to prototype LISN test and results from children with either a suspected (central) auditory processing disorder of a confirmed language disorder; Journal of the American Academy of Audiology 19(5), 2008 People with spatial hearing loss have difficulty processing speech that arrives from one direction while simultaneously filtering out 'noise' arriving from other directions. Research has shown spatial hearing loss to be a leading cause of central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) in children. Children with spatial hearing loss commonly present with difficulties understanding speech in the classroom. Spatial hearing loss is found in most people over 70 years of age, and can sometimes be independent of other types of age related hearing loss.Frisina D and Frisina R; Speech recognition in noise and presbycusis: relations to possible neural mechanisms; Hearing Research 106(1-2), 1997 As with presbycusis, spatial hearing loss varies with age. Through childhood and into adulthood it can be viewed as spatial hearing gain (with it becoming easier to hear speech in noise), and then with middle age and beyond the spatial hearing loss begins (with it becoming harder again to hear speech in noise). Sound streams arriving from the left or right (the horizontal plane) are localised primarily by the small time differences of the same sound arriving at the two ears. A sound straight in front of the head is heard at the same time by both ears. A sound to the side of the head is heard approximately 0.0005 seconds later by the ear furthest away. A sound halfway to one side is heard approximately 0.0003 seconds later. This is the interaural time difference (ITD) cue and is measured by signal processing in the two central auditory pathways that begin after the cochlea and pass through the brainstem and mid-brain.Dobreva M, O‚ÄôNeill W and Paige G; Influence of Aging on Human Sound Localization; Journal of Neurophysiology 105, 2011 Some of those with spatial hearing loss are unable to process ITD (low frequency) cues. Sound streams arriving from below the head, above the head, and over behind the head (the vertical plane) are localised again by signal processing in the central auditory pathways. The cues this time however are the notches/peaks that are added to the sound arriving at the ears by the complex shapes of the pinna. Different notches/peaks are added to sounds coming from below compared to sounds coming from above, and compared to sounds coming from behind. The most significant notches are added to sounds in the 4 kHz to 10 kHz range.Besta V, Carlile S, Jin C and Van Schaik A; The role of high frequencies in speech localization; Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 118(1), 2005 Some of those with spatial hearing loss are unable to process pinna related (high frequency) cues. By the time sound stream representations reach the end of the auditory pathways brainstem inhibition processing ensures that the right pathway is solely responsible for the left ear sounds and the left pathway is solely responsible for the right ear sounds.Della Penna S, Brancucci A, Babiloni C, Franciotti R, Pizzella V, Rossi D, Torquati K, Rossini PM, Romani GL; Lateralization of Dichotic Speech Stimuli is Based on Specific Auditory Pathway Interactions; Cerebral Cortex 17(10), 2007. It is then the responsibility of the auditory cortex (AC) of the right hemisphere (on its own) to map the whole auditory scene. Information about the right auditory hemifield joins with the information about the left hemifield once it has passed through the corpus callosum (CC) - the brain white matter that connects homologous regions of the left and right hemispheres.At A, Spierer L, Clarke S; The role of the right parietal cortex in sound localization: a chronometric single pulse transcranial-magnetic stimulation study; Neuropsychologia 49(9), 2011 Some of those with spatial hearing loss are unable to integrate the auditory representations of the left and right hemifields, and consequently are unable to maintain any representation of auditory space. An auditory space representation enables attention to be given (conscious top-down driven) to a single auditory stream. A gain mechanism can be employed involving the enhancement of the speech stream, and the suppression of any other speech streams and any noise streams.Kerlin J, Shahin A and Miller L; Attentional Gain Control of Ongoing Cortical Speech Representations in a ‚ÄúCocktail Party‚Äù; Journal of Neuroscience 30(2), 2010 An inhibition mechanism can be employed involving the variable suppression of outputs from the two cochlea.Srinivasan S, Keil A, Stratis K, Osborne A, Cerwonka C, Wong J, Rieger B, Polcz V, Smith D; Interaural attention modulates outer hair cell function; Eur J Neurosci. 40(12), 2014 Some of those with spatial hearing loss are unable to suppress unwanted cochlea output. Those individuals with spatial hearing loss are not able to accurately perceive the directions different sound streams are coming from and their hearing is no longer 3-dimensional (3D). Sound streams from the rear may appear to come from the front instead. Sound streams from the left or right may appear to come from the front. The gain mechanism can not be used to enhance the speech stream of interest from all other sound streams. Those with spatial hearing loss need target speech to be raised by typically more than 10 dB when listening to speech in a background noise compared to those with no spatial hearing loss.Glyde H, Hickson L, Cameron S, Dillon H; Problems hearing in noise in older adults: a review of spatial processing disorder; Trends in Amplification 15(3), 2011 Spatial hearing ability normally begins to develop in early childhood, and then continues to develop into early adulthood. After the age of 50 years spatial hearing ability begins to decline.Cameron S, Glyde H and Dillon H; Listening in Spatialized Noise - Sentences Test (LiSN-S): Normative and Retest Reliability Data for Adolescents and Adults up to 60 Years of Age; Journal of the American Academy of Audiology 22, 2011 Both peripheral hearing and central auditory pathway problems can interfere with early development. With some individuals, for a range of different reasons, maturation of the two ear spatial hearing ability may simply never happen. For example, prolonged episodes of ear infections such as ‚Äúglue ear‚Äù are likely to significantly hinder its development.Farah R, Schmithorst V, Keith R, Holland S; Altered white matter microstructure underlies listening difficulties in children suspected of auditory processing disorders; Brain and Behavior 4(4), 2014 Corpus callosum Many neuroscience studies have facilitated the development and refinement of a speech processing model. This model shows cooperation between the two hemispheres of the brain, with asymmetric inter- hemispheric and intrahemispheric connectivity consistent with the left hemisphere specialization for phonological processing.Bitan et al.; Bidirectional connectivity between hemispheres occurs at multiple levels in language processing, but depends on sex; Journal of Neuroscience 30(35), 2010 The right hemisphere is more specialized for sound localization,Spierer et al.; Hemispheric competence for auditory spatial representation; Brain 132, 2009 while auditory space representation in the brain requires the integration of information from both hemispheres.Grothe et al.; Mechanisms of Sound Localization in Mammals; Physiol Rev 90, 2010 The corpus callosum (CC) is the major route of communication between the two hemispheres. At maturity it is a large mass of white matter and consists of bundles of fibres linking the white matter of the two cerebral hemispheres. Its caudal and splenium portions contain fibres that originate from the primary and second auditory cortices, and from other auditory responsive areas.Lebel C, Caverhill-Godkewitsch S, Beaulieu C; Age-related regional variations of the Corpus Callosum identified by diffusion tensor tractography; Neuroimage 52(1), 2010 Transcallosal interhemispheric transfer of auditory information plays a significant role in spatial hearing functions that depend on binaural cues.Hausmann M, Corballis M, Fabri M, Paggi A, Lewald J; Sound lateralization in subjects with callosotomy, callosal agenesis, or hemispherectomy; Brain Res Cogn Brain Res 25(2), 2005 Various studies have shown that despite normal audiograms, children with known auditory interhemispheric transfer deficits have particular difficulty localizing sound and understanding speech in noise.Bamiou D et al.; Auditory interhemispheric transfer deficits, hearing difficulties, and brain magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities in children with congenital aniridia due to PAX6 mutations; Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med 161(5), 2007. The CC of the human brain is relatively slow to mature with its size continuing to increase until the fourth decade of life. From this point it then slowly begins to shrink.Sala S, Agosta F, Pagani E, Copetti M, Comi G, Filippi M; Microstructural changes and atrophy in brain white matter tracts with aging; Neurobiology of Aging 33(3), 2012 LiSN-S SRT scores show that the ability to understand speech in noisy environments develops with age, is beginning to be adult like by 18 years and starts to decline between 40 and 50 years of age.Glyde H, Cameron S, Dillon H, Hickson L, Seeto M; The effects of hearing impairment and aging on spatial processing;; Ear & Hearing 34(1), 2013 =Roles of the SOC and the MOC= The medial olivocochlear bundle (MOC) is part of a collection of brainstem nuclei known as the superior olivary complex (SOC). The MOC innervates the outer hair cells of the cochlea and its activity is able to reduce basilar-membrane responses to sound by reducing the gain of cochlear amplification.Cooper N, Guinan J; Efferent-Mediated Control of Basilar Membrane Motion; J. Physiol. 576.1, 2006 In a quiet environment when speech from a single talker is being listened to, then the MOC efferent pathways are essentially inactive. In this case the single speech stream enters both ears and its representation ascends the two auditory pathways. The stream arrives at both the right and left auditory cortices for eventual speech processing by the left hemisphere. In a noisy environment the MOC efferent pathways are required to be active in two distinct ways. The first is an automatic response to the multiple sound streams arriving at the two ears, while the second is a top-down corticofugal attention driven response. The purpose of both is an attempt to enhance the signal to noise ratio between the speech stream being listened to and all other sound streams.Smith D and Keil, A; The biological role of the medial olivocochlear efferents in hearing; Front. Syst. Neurosci. 25, 2015 The automatic response involves the MOC efferents inhibiting the output of the cochlear of the left ear. The output of the right ear is therefore dominant and only the right hemispace streams (with their direct connection to the speech processing areas of the left hemisphere) travel up the auditory pathway.Bidelman G and Bhagat S; Right-ear advantage drives the link between olivocochlear efferent 'antimasking' and speech-in- noise listening benefits; NeuroReport 26(8), 2015 With children the underdeveloped Corpus Callosum (CC) is unable, in any case, to transfer auditory streams arriving (from the left ear) at the right hemisphere to the left hemisphere.Kimura D; From ear to brain; Brain Cogn. 76(2), 2011 With adults with a mature CC, an attention driven (conscious) decision to attend to one particular sound stream is the trigger for further MOC activity.Lehmann A, Schonwiesner M; Selective Attention Modulates Human Auditory Brainstem Responses: Relative Contributions of Frequency and Spatial Cues; PLoS ONE 9(1), 2014 The 3D spatial representation of the multiple streams of the noisy environment (a function of the right hemisphere) enables a choice of the ear to be attended to. As a consequence, instruction may be given to the MOC efferents to inhibit the output of the right cochlear rather than the left cochlear. If the speech stream being attended to is from the left hemispace it will arrive at the right hemisphere and access speech processing via the CC. Diagnosis Spatial hearing loss can be diagnosed using the Listening in Spatialized Noise ‚Äì Sentences test (LiSN-S), which was designed to assess the ability of children with central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) to understand speech in background noise. The LiSN-S allows audiologists to measure how well a person uses spatial (and pitch information) to understand speech in noise. Inability to use spatial information has been found to be a leading cause of CAPD in children. Test participants repeat a series of target sentences which are presented simultaneously with competing speech. The listener's speech reception threshold (SRT) for target sentences is calculated using an adaptive procedure. The targets are perceived as coming from in front of the listener whereas the distracters vary according to where they are perceived spatially (either directly in front or either side of the listener). The vocal identity of the distracters also varies (either the same as, or different from, the speaker of the target sentences). Performance on the LISN-S is evaluated by comparing listeners' performances across four listening conditions, generating two SRT measures and three \\"advantage\\" measures. The advantage measures represent the benefit in dB gained when either talker, spatial, or both talker and spatial cues are available to the listener. The use of advantage measures minimizes the influence of higher order skills on test performance. This serves to control for the inevitable differences that exist between individuals in functions such as language or memory. Dichotic listening tests can be used to measure the efficacy of the attentional control of cochlear inhibition and the inter-hemispheric transfer of auditory information. Dichotic listening performance typically increases (and the right-ear advantage decreases) with the development of the Corpus Callosum (CC), peaking before the fourth decade. During middle age and older the auditory system ages, the CC reduces in size, and dichotic listening becomes worse, primarily in the left ear.Lavie L, Banai K, Attias J, Karni A; How difficult is difficult? Speech perception in noise in the elderly hearing impaired; Jnl Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol 25(3), 2014 Dichotic listening tests typically involve two different auditory stimuli (usually speech) presented simultaneously, one to each ear, using a set of headphones. Participants are asked to attend to one or (in a divided-attention test) both of the messages.Musiek F and Weihing J; Perspectives on dichotic listening and the corpus callosum; Brain Cogn. 76(2), 2011 The activity of the medial olivocochlear bundle (MOC) and its inhibition of cochlear gain can be measured using a Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission (DPOE) recording method. This involves the contralateral presentation of broadband noise and the measurement of both DPOAE amplitudes and the latency of onset of DPOAE suppression. DPOAE suppression is significantly affected by age and becomes difficult to detect by approximately 50 years of age.Konomi U, Kanotra S, James A, Harrison R; Age related changes to the dynamics of contralateral DPOAE suppression in human subjects; Journal of Otolaryngology‚ÄìHead and Neck Surgery 43(15), 2014 Research Research has shown that PC based spatial hearing training software can help some of the children identified as failing to develop their spatial hearing skills (perhaps because of frequent bouts of otitis media with effusion).Cameron S, Dillon H; Development and Evaluation of the LiSN & Learn Auditory Training Software for Deficit-Specific Remediation of Binaural Processing Deficits in Children: Preliminary Findings; Jnl Am Acad Audiol 22(10), 2011 Further research is needed to discover if a similar approach would help those over 60 to recover the loss of their spatial hearing. One such study showed that dichotic test scores for the left ear improved with daily training.Bless J, Westerhausen R, Kompus K, Gudmundsen M, Hugdahl K; Self-supervised, mobile-application based cognitive training of auditory attention: a behavioural and fMRI evaluation; Internet Interventions 1(3), 2014 Related research into the plasticity of white-matter (see L√∂vd√©n et al. for example)L√∂vd√©n et al.; Experience-dependent plasticity of white-matter microstructure extends into old age; Neuropsychologia 48(13), 2010 suggests some recovery may be possible. Music training leads to superior understanding of speech in noise across age groups and musical experience protects against age-related degradation in neural timing.Parbery-Clark et al.; Musical experience offsets age-related delays in neural timing; Neurobiol. Aging 33(7), 2012 Unlike speech (fast temporal information), music (pitch information) is primarily processed by areas of the brain in the right hemisphere.Tervaniemi M, Hugdahl K; Lateralization of auditory-cortex functions; Brain Research Reviews 43, 2003 Given that it seems likely that the right ear advantage (REA) for speech is present from birth, it would follow that a left ear advantage for music is also present from birth and that MOC efferent inhibition (of the right ear) plays a similar role in creating this advantage. Does greater exposure to music increase conscious control of cochlear gain and inhibition? Further research is needed to explore the apparent ability of music to promote an enhanced capability of speech in noise recognition. Bilateral digital hearing aids do not preserve localization cues (see, for example, Van den Bogaert et al., 2006)Van den Bogaert et al.; Horizontal localization with bilateral hearing aids: Without is better than with; J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 119(1), 2006. This means that audiologists when fitting hearing aids to patients (with a mild to moderate age related loss) risk negatively impacting their spatial hearing capability. With those patients who feel that their lack of understanding of speech in background noise is their primary hearing difficulty then hearing aids may simply make their problem even worse - their spatial hearing gain will be reduced by in the region of 10 dB. Although further research is needed, there is a growing number of studies which have shown that open-fit hearing aids are better able to preserve localisation cues (see, for example, Alworth 2011)Alworth L.; Effect of Occlusion, Directionality and Age on Horizontal Localization; Doctoral Dissertation, 2011 See also * Cocktail party effect * Corpus callosum * Presbycusis * Spatial hearing * Unilateral hearing loss * SoundBite Hearing System References External links * http://www.nal.gov.au Category:Hearing loss Category:Space in life ","title":"Spatial hearing loss"},{"id":"32105744","text":"Aodh Bu√≠ Mac Cruit√≠n () (1680‚Äì1755) was an Irish poet, tutor, and soldier, Biography Mac Cruit√≠n was a descendant of a bardic family of Thomond.

An example would be moving a spacecraft from a low Earth orbit (LEO) to a higher-energy orbit like a geostationary transfer orbit, a lunar transfer, or an escape trajectory. The term is often used to refer to reusable, space-based vehicles. Some previously proposed or built space tugs include the NASA 1970s STS proposal or the proposed Russian Parom, and has sometimes been used to refer to expendable upper stages, such as Fregat, or Spaceflight Industries Sherpa. Background The space tug was first envisioned in the post-World War II era as a support vehicle for a permanent, Earth-orbiting space station. It was used by science fiction writer Murray Leinster as the title of a novel published in 1953 as the sequel to Space Platform, another novel about such a space station. NASA Space Transportation System Space Tug crew module concept A reusable space tug was studied by NASA in the late 60s and early 70s as part of a reusable Space Transportation System (STS). This consisted of a basic propulsion module, to which a crew module or other payload could be attached. Optional landing legs could be added to land payloads on the surface of the Moon. This, along with all other elements of STS except the Space Shuttle, was never funded after cutbacks to NASA's budget during the 1970s in the wake of the Apollo program. Space Shuttle era =Expendable upper stages= The Shuttle program filled the role of high-energy orbital transfer by the development of a solid-fueled single-stage Payload Assist Module and two-stage Inertial Upper Stage. A more powerful liquid hydrogen fueled Centaur-G stage was developed for use on the Shuttle, but was cancelled as too dangerous after the Challenger disaster. =Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle= NASA studied another space tug design, termed the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle (OMV), along with its plans for Space Station Freedom. The OMV's role would have been a reusable space vehicle that would retrieve satellites, such as Hubble, and bring them to Freedom for repair or retrieval, or to service uncrewed orbital platforms. In 1984, the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle (OMV) preliminary design studies were initiated through a competitive award process with systems studies conducted by TRW, Martin Marietta Aerospace, and LTV Corporation.Department of Defense appropriations for 1986, pt. 1, p. 242. Twenty-first century proposals = Parom = The Russian RKK Energia corporation proposed a space tug named Parom in 2005 which could be used to ferry both the proposed Kliper crew vehicle or uncrewed cargo and fuel resupply modules to ISS. Keeping the tug in space would have allowed for a less massive Kliper, enabling launch on a smaller booster than the original Kliper design. = SHERPA = Spaceflight Inc. developed SHERPA, which builds upon the capabilities of the Spaceflight Secondary Payload System (SSPS) by incorporating propulsion and power generation subsystems, which creates a propulsive tug dedicated to maneuvering to an optimal orbit to place secondary and hosted payloads. The maiden flight of two separate unpropelled variants of the dispenser was in December 2018 on a Falcon 9 rocket. This flight deployed 64 small satellites from 17 countries. =VASIMR= The VASIMR electric plasma rocket could be used to power a high-efficiency space tug, using only 9 tons of Argon propellant to make a round trip to the Moon, delivering 34 tons of cargo from Low Earth Orbit to low lunar orbit. , Ad Astra Rocket Company had put forward a concept proposal to utilize the technology to make a space tug. =ISRO PAM-G= Indian Space Research Organisation has built an upper stage called PAM-G (Payload Assist Module for GSLV) capable of pushing payloads directly to MEO or GEO orbits from low Earth orbits. PAM-G is powered by hypergolic liquid motor with restart capability, derived from PSLV's fourth stage. As of 2013, ISRO has realized the structure, control systems, and motors of PAM-G and has conducted hot tests. PAM-G would form the fourth stage of GSLV Mk2C launch vehicle, sitting on top of GSLV's cryogenic third stage. = Jupiter = Lockheed Martin made a concept proposal to NASA in 2015 for a design called the Jupiter space tug, to be based on the designs of two earlier Lockheed Martin spacecraft‚ÄîMars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission and the Juno‚Äîas well as a robotic arm from MDA derived from technology used on Canadarm, the robotic arm technology previously used on the Space Shuttle. In addition to the Jupiter space tug itself, the Lockheed concept included the use of a new -diameter cargo transport module called Exoliner for carrying cargo to the ISS. Exoliner is based on the earlier (2000s) ESA-developed Automated Transfer Vehicle, and was to be jointly developed with Thales Alenia Space. In the event, NASA did not agree to fund the Jupiter development, and Lockheed Martin is not developing the tug with private capital. = Mission Extension Vehicle = In 2011 ViviSat a joint project between U.S. Space and ATK proposed the Mission Extension Vehicle. In 2016 ViviSat was dissolved when U.S. Space declared bankruptcy and ATK merged with Orbital Science Corporation to form Orbital ATK. In 2017 Orbital ATK got the go ahead from the FCC to begin development of the spacecraft with new partner Northrup Grumman who was developing a tug of their own. In June 2018, both companies pooled their resources and merged to form a new company called Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems. On 9 October 2019 the first of these tugs MEV-1 was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on a Proton-M rocket. In February 2020, MEV-1 successfully docked with Intelsat 901 and returned it to geosynchronous orbit, allowing it to continue operating 4 years past its service life. MEV-1 will continue to maintain this position for a 5 year period, after which it will move the satellite back into a graveyard orbit for retirement. MEV-2 was launched 15 August 2020 with Galaxy 30 on an Ariane 5 to perform a similar maneuver with Intelsat-1002. = Artemis Transfer Stages = NASA's Artemis program is planning on using partially reusable three stage lunar landers. One of the main elements is the transfer stage which would move the lander from the Lunar Gateway's orbit to a low lunar orbit. Future versions will be able to return to the Gateway for refueling and reuse with another lander. Northrop Grumman has proposed building a transfer stage based on its Cygnus spacecraft. = Moon Cruiser = Designed by Airbus, the Moon Cruiser is a conceptual lunar logistics vehicle based on the ATV and ESM that is proposed to be used to support the international Lunar Gateway. If funded, it would make up a part of ESA's contribution to the Lunar Gateway program. As of January 2020, it was in the early design process. Planned to be launched on the Ariane 6‚Äîwith the capability to also be launched with US heavy launchers‚Äîthe vehicle is intended to be able to refuel lunar landers and deliver cargo to the Gateway. It will also be used to deliver the European ESPRIT module to the Gateway no earlier than 2025. It has also been proposed to turn the vehicle into a transfer stage for a lunar lander. Concepts for a lander variant of the vehicle exist but have not received funding.Airbus Moon Cruiser Concept, Airbus video, via YouTube, September 2019, accessed 20 May 2020. = Momentus Space = Momentus Space develops different space tug versions focusing on large velocity changes over 1 km/s. Demonstration missions are planned for 2020 with regular service starting 2021.

Metaphra also use guest instrumentalists such as saxophonist Gustave Savvy.  History  Richard Gale and Marie Bolt met in 2007 in Bristol when both were working on different music projects. They shared a love of the trip hop sound prevalent in Bristol in the 1990s and decided to work together to experiment musically, fusing trip-hop with modern electronica, glitch, and dubstep genres. Their blend of female vocals, bass- heavy yet laid-back rhythms, enchanting melodies, lush soundscapes, live instruments and cutting edge sound design takes listeners on an epic journey through sound. The lyrical themes of their debut album, 'Kleptocracy' range from political commentary to love songs, to the fantastical and magical, and they aim to inspire. Richard Gale, producer and musician and a lecturer in music technology and sound engineering at Deep Blue Sound in Plymouth and Camborne, had started playing guitar in city metal bands in his teens, before getting into production. He later played live electronic music at free parties and clubs around the UK, and was crowned UK Laptop Battle Champion 2006 and 2007. Richard also performs and Produces outside of Metaphra under the name Defazed, and is signed to Subtek Records. Marie Bolt, vocalist and lyricist, has been singing and performing from a young age. She had also been mixing 'old skool' jungle and drum'n'bass at free parties, clubs and on pirate/internet radio around the UK from 2000, as well as performing as a vocalist on experimental electronica for Loaf Recordings.

History  It is not known what occasion prompted Bruckner to compose this large-scale work or whether there was any performance in Bruckner's lifetime. The composition was presumably initiated during the St. Florian period () and completed in (at the latest 1858) in Linz, when Bruckner was studying with Simon Sechter.C. van Zwol, p. 697U.

The 652-bar long work in A major is scored for choir and soloists and orchestra (1 flute, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 4 trombones, timpani and strings). The work (total duration about 30 minutes) is divided into six parts: #Introduction: \\"Alleluja! Lobet den Herrn\\". Langsam, A major - Choir with soprano soloist and solo horn #Recitative: F sharp minor veering to D major ##\\"Der Herr bauet Jerusalem\\". Kr√§ftig - Bass soloist and trombones ##\\"Er heilet die geschlagenen Herzens sind\\". Weich - Soprano soloist and horns ##\\"Er z√§hlet die Menge der Sterne\\". Frisch - Tenor soloist and woodwinds (oboes & bassoons) #Choir: \\"Gro√ü ist unser Herr\\". Schnell, D minor veering to D major - Double choir in antiphony #Arioso with Choir: ##Arioso: \\"Der Herr nimmt auf die Sanften\\". Nicht zu langsam, B flat major - Soprano, tenor and alto soloists, with solo oboe and violin ##Choir: \\"Singet dem Herrn mit Danksagung\\". Etwas bewegter, E flat major ##Bridging arioso: ###\\"Er l√§√üt Gras wachsen auf den Bergen\\" - Soprano soloist ###\\"Er gibt dem Vieh seine Speise\\" - Tenor soloist with solo clarinet ###\\"Er hat nicht Lust an der St√§rke des Rosses\\" - Bass soloist with solo bassoon, veering to E minor #Arioso: \\"Der Herr hat Wohlgefallen an denen, die ihn f√ºrchten\\". Nicht schnell, E major - Soprano soloist #Finale with Fugue: \\"Alleluja! Lobet den Herrn\\", A major ##Final choir: Etwas schnell ##Fugue: Nicht schnell - Choir with soloists at the end As in the Missa solemnis there are clear influences of Haydn and Schubert, particularly in the ariosos. There are in the Finale two passages with brass instrument chords followed by an Alleluja, for which Bruckner drew his inspiration from the Hallelujah of H√§ndel's Messiah, on which he often improvised on organ. For the first time Bruckner is using a full orchestra, with yet some archaism such as the use of horns (part 4) and trombones (part 6) in homophony with the choir. \\"[The] closing Alleluja ... is Bruckner's most extended fugue prior to the Fifth Symphony.\\" The five-minute long fugue is more mature than the quite formal fugues of Bruckner's previous works - a consequence of Sechter's tuition. Bruckner uses, e.g., an inversion of the theme in its development. > Psalm 146 is also remarkable as the first piece in which Bruckner > experimented with organic thematic integration on a large scale ... [It] > also deserves to be heard more often for the lovely string pianissimo in its > opening bars that foreshadows the beginning of both the D minor and F minor > Masses.

It is included in Alfred Wainwright's Outlying Fells of Lakeland book, sharing a chapter with Dent. Wainwright's clockwise route to the two summits starts at Wath Brow. Topography Flat Fell has an elongated, slug- shaped profile, with a steep slope known as Flatfell Screes at the Eastern end. Flatfell Screes forms the one side of the valley of the Nannycatch Beck, along which runs part of the Coast to Coast Walk. Unlike Dent, Flat Fell is not forested and is mostly covered by open grassland, grazed by sheep and horses. The Southern and Eastern slopes are carpeted with large areas of bracken and Gorse (Ulex europaeus). Ascent Flat fell is flanked by two rights of way; a bridleway along the Southern slope and a footpath along the Northern aspect. The latter links to the Fell Road at the Kinniside Stone Circle. Both tracks link together at the end of Nannycatch road, to the West. There are no distinct paths leading from either track to the summit.

Oxford English Dictionary. It has arisen from the convergence of communications and Ubiquitous Computing,:es:Computaci√≥n ubicua intelligentJoseph W. Sullivan and William Mark, Intelligent User Interfaces (ACM Press Frontier Series), 1991, ACM Press.INTELLIGENT USER INTERFACES: Adaptation and Personalization Systems and Technologies by Constantinos Mourlas and Panagiotis Germanakos 2008, Idea Group Publishing. and adaptable user interfaces, and the common infrastructure of the intelligent or mixed pavement. The Intelligent Street is the basis of the intelligent city and is normally formed of four layers (physical infrastructure, sensors, networks and services), thus improving on the traditional street (which originated in Roman roadsCalzada Romana or Roman streets) which served solely as transit streets (but did not have any type of ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù). Concept The concept of the Intelligent Street is associated with that of the Intelligent Environment, since it is built of/ absorbs all information and communication technologies and sensor systems on any public transit street. This allows the facilities it offers to be integrated into its users‚Äô daily lives for their convenience, but without these users having to make any type of effort or undergo invasions of privacy. These dual objectives of comfort and simplicity are the basis of the concept of the Intelligent Street, which can be defined as an environment in which users interact in a transparent manner with a multitude of interconnected devices using different types of wireless communication. It is thus possible to construct ‚Äúintelligent cities‚Äù, in the sense indicated by Professor William John Mitchell of the MIT, , by taking advantage of the ‚Äòthird wave of technological innovation‚Äô provided by sensors and digital labels, and which will substitute previous waves, relative to the incorporation of computers and the era of connection implied by the introduction of the Internet. As this expert points out, inhabiting intelligent cities implies being continuously connected to different networks, thus allowing these cities to be able to ‚Äòextend‚Äô people's capacities in a more complete and global manner. The Intelligent Street thus becomes the basis for the Intelligent City, since it permits the creation of interactive spaces which take computing to the physical world, thus supporting a set of interconnected people who, together with their mobile phones, computers and other apparatus, will buy, sell, and exchange information and services. As has occurred with the television, it seems likely that there will be an ‚Äúanalogical blackout‚Äù in cities, and their inhabitants will be able to celebrate this with our new services (as are shown below) via a system of invisible and sustainable infrastructures. The concept of the Intelligent Street allows the vision of an Information Society in public zones to become a reality, and ensures its ease of use, efficient service support and the possibility of maintaining natural interactions with citizens. Its principal objective is characterized by the fact that it will provide people with intelligent and intuitive interfaces which will be integrated into normal pavements, and that it will be able to recognize and respond to the presence and needs of diverse individuals in a completely discrete and imperceptible manner. Apart from consisting of streets and squares, in which its principal utility resides, the Intelligent Street will also be of great use in schools, transport networks, airports, promenades, theme parks ... and in all those places in which it can assist the pedestrian to find information, relate to others, carry out activities, receive help ... and feel secure. This concept therefore takes ubiquitous and pervasive computing to public transit streets. Ubiquitous Computing\\"Ubiquitous computing\\" Weiser; Gold; Brown (1999-05-11). Retrieved 2008-05-07. signifies computing that is available everywhere and it is pervasive' Hansmann, Uwe (2003). Pervasive Computing: The Mobile World. Springer. in the respect that it is integrated, in this case invisibly, into normal pavements. The Intelligent Pavement Conventional pavements, be they formed of kerbs, tiles, paving stones, or any other construction material, are intended to be solely and exclusively a decorative element with which to make transit streets or open or enclosed spaces passable. This type of pavement is fundamentally characterized by its colour, form and resistance, and its other useful possibilities (whilst maintaining these characteristics) are not normally considered. The Intelligent Pavement, however, has the peculiarity that its interior contains elements which are not normally associated with pavements (electrical and electronic components, radio frequency components, communication components and components for telephones and the storage of any type of energy), signifying that, in addition to fulfilling its conventional function (a decorative element with which to make transit streets or open or enclosed spaces passable), it also fulfils a secondary function by supporting the infrastructure of the Intelligent Street's services. All this is possible since, as we know, the advance of technological innovation has led to a reduction in the size of certain objects and elements, both in communications and in other technological sectors, to the extent that tiny electrical, electronic, radiofrequency, communication, sensorial, telephonic and energy storage equipment now exists, which is used with civil or military purposes, and whose casings, casts or boxes are of different forms and textures, and are located in different places. The Intelligent Street‚Äôs Habilitating Elements As occurs with any intelligent environment, the Intelligent Street is based on the following technologies and characteristics: =Micro- servers= The Intelligent Street's mechanisms consist of people, other servers and micro-servers which support software applications that can be used by others, thus creating a distributed and in-built intelligence that is totally invisible to its users. These mechanisms connect with each other, without human intervention, solely through their insertion in the Intelligent Pavement. =Terminals and Sensors= The Intelligent Street supports sensorisationV. C. Gungor, G.P. Hancke, Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks: Challenges, Design Principles, and Technical Approaches, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, Vol. 56, Issue 10,(October 2009). and therefore offers services related to, amongst others, the following: \\\\- Temperature. \\\\- Humidity. \\\\- Contamination. \\\\- Barriers. \\\\- Pedestrian Transit Streets. \\\\- Wheeled Transit Streets. \\\\- Pedestrianisation. \\\\- Keys and Switches. \\\\- Video- Security. =Voluntary Identification= The machine codes in our mobile phones, or a simple ZigBee bracelet ZigBeeZigBee Alliance. ZigBee Specification (2008).A. Wheeler, Commercial Applications of wireless sensor networks using Zigbee, IEEE Communications Magazine, Vol. 45, Issue 4,(2007). can serve as both pagers and master keys with which to obtain services from the Intelligent Street. Nevertheless, in the future it might be possible to use identification techniques based on biometric characteristics, or on individual behaviour patterns, so that the service obtained will be personalised. =Personalisation of services= The services offered by an Intelligent Street of the future will be personalizable, signifying that they will be available, with the appearance desired by each individual, and that it will be possible to add elements depending on the context and circumstances (place, environmental conditions, capacity in terms of the provision of accessible communication networks etc.). =Reconfigurability, adaptability and learning= The Intelligent Street will be adaptable to space, and will thus be reconfigurable to serve the spatial function that its users may require at any given moment in the best possible manner. User numbers and behaviour are normally modified over time, since a zone might be commercial in one decade and residential the next, or because sensitivity and use necessitate another type of behaviour. The Intelligent Street can also learn from the people that use it in order to offer them services which are better adapted to their needs. The fact that a street reconfigures its services and reach implies a reconfiguration of its ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù, thus altering the ‚Äòapplications‚Äô that are supported by the micro-servers which are built into the intelligent pavement. =Multi-interface access= The Intelligent Street provides access to images, sound, voice, text etc. via any standard device(Multimedia Interaction and Intelligent User Interfaces: Principles, Methods and Applications (Advances in Pattern Recognition))by Ling Shao, Caifeng Shan, Jiebo Luo and Minoru Etoh, 2010, Springer and is always adapted to the utmost to the zone used, thus making it unnecessary to use special devices, which may need additional investment and training on the user's behalf if they are to interact with the environment. Examples of positive moments The Intelligent Street's specific services can assist in numerous situations: from making a call to the emergency services to requesting information about cultural activities, scholastic control, the generation of statistical data, the selection of restaurants, services for the disabled and even to promote citizens‚Äô security in situations such as those of heavy snowfalls or icy roads. Standardisation IEP ‚Äì Intelligent Environments Pavement ‚Ñ¢ is the Intelligent Pavement's first specific standard currently in force in the EU, and therefore supports the installation and maintenance of the Intelligent Street. The IEP (‚ÄúThe Intelligent Pavement‚Äù) standard is a de facto standard created by its manufacturers in order to allow public organisations and administrations to install the Intelligent Pavement in their cities with a total guarantee of service, supply, maintenance and connection to other cities. This standard provides for all the types of elements and organizations that may be interested in the pavement and its associated services. The IEP standard also allows knowledge and services to be modelled with regard to the technological validity of its developments and installations.

Edith Rathenau was born in 1883 in Berlin, only daughter of German- Jewish industrialist Emil Rathenau and his wife Mathilde Rathenau (born Nachmann), who belonged to a family descended from the rabbi Moses ben Nachmann - a mystic of the 12th century. She was the younger sister of the politician Walther Rathenau and the industrialist Erich Rathenau. On 10 February 1902, she married the banker Fritz Andreae, the son of the saloni√®re Bertha von Arnswaldt and Karl Louis Andreae (1839‚Äì1878), whose family were descended from both protestant theologian Jakob Andreae and his grandson, the Rosicrucian, Johann Valentin Andreae. In her youth Edith Andreae was a friend of Katia Mann. In 1913 the family moved into the Villa Andreae in Grunewald. Edith Andreae there showed an \\"ambitious high degree of sociability\\". She was known as \\"the most intellectual woman in Berlin\\", and she supported Max Reinhardt and numerous intellectuals of her time, including Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Gerhart Hauptmann, Ursula Herking and Thomas Mann. Also such politicians as Friedrich Ebert were guests in her house. After the death of her brother Walther Rathenau she was the owner of Castle Freienwalde. The castle became a memorial for Rathenau as a part of the Walther-Rathenau- Foundation, which was dissolved in 1939. During the Nazi era the family had to give up the house in the Grunewald in 1938 and emigrated to Switzerland in 1939. The family settled in Zurich. There Fritz Andreae died in 1950 and Edith Andreae two years later in 1952.

After attending high school, Marcel studied at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and attained a bachelor's degree in political sciences. He came to Brussels because he knew the VRT had her offices there. He didn't know at the time there was something like a drama school, like St.-Lukas in Brussels.

Musical career =Arbeid Adelt!= Marcel Vanthilt rose to fame with his group 'Arbeid Adelt!' (literally: \\"Labor ennobles\\"), formed in 1981. He provided vocals and played keyboard for the group, singing mainly in Dutch. They made 2 EPs ('Jonge Helden' and 'Le chagrin et Quatre-vingt') and scored minor hits with 'De Dag dat het zonlicht...' and 'Lekker Westers'. Despite the initial success, the group decided to split. One year later, they reformed, only to split again after releasing one single ('Stroom'). The reason behind this was the discontent of the group with their record label, and also differing opinions between the group members about the future of the band.Houbrechts, D. Arbeid Adelt!, \\"The Belgian Pop and Rock archives\\", December 2001. Retrieved 26 April 2011. Vanthilt noted the following comment: \\"They saw us as a kind of clowns. They refused to bring out the songs that were representative of what we were doing, and released \\"Stroom\\" en \\"Witte kom hie\\". Those were both good jokes, good for a laugh at the live gigs, but not good as a release two years after your last record.\\" In 1991 the group got together again and got a deal from Virgin Records. This resulted in their first full CD, 'Des Duivels Oorkussen'. However, they were not able to break through commercially. In 1996 he also recorded the song \\"I Shoot Dikke Jo\\" with the Tuvan throat singing ensemble Huun-Huur-Tu. =Other= Vanthilt tried to gain musical fame with two other groups: \\"The Y√©h-y√©hs\\" and \\"Groep Z\\"(in 2004). Both stints were unsuccessful. He also designed the album cover of Clouseau's record En Dans (2001). Television career =VPRO= In the early 1980s Vanthilt worked for VPRO on Dutch television. One of the projects he worked on was the presentation of Big Fun in the Big Town (1986), a documentary about Hip hop music, credited for making the genre very popular in the Netherlands. It became available on DVD in 2012. =MTV VJ= From 1987 to 1990, Vanthilt lived in London. There he became a VJ for the new music station MTV Europe. His most famous programme there was \\"Cokes & Vanthilt\\", which he presented in co-operation with Ray Cokes. The two got together again on New Year's Eve 2008 for a one time show on Belgian network Canvas.TV-visie, Cokes en Vanthilt in de overgang op Canvas, 30 December 2008 =United States= From 1996 to 1998, Vanthilt moved to the United States, in pursuit of his wife. He tried to launch an acting career, but was ultimately unsuccessful. He can be seen as an extra in an episode of Friends (S3E17). After he divorced his wife, he returned to Belgium. He also wrote columns and was reporter for the magazine Panorama. He bundled his columns in a book, called Ha!Merika! and also adapted it to a theatre show. =Belgian TV and radio career= From 1998 onwards, Vanthilt became involved with the media in Belgium, mostly on Flemish radiostation Studio Brussel and TV-station E√©n. On TV, he hosted various shows, such as quizzes ('Quix', 'ViaVia', 'De lage Landen'). His most famous quiz was perhaps 'Tien voor Taal', a language-centered quiz, which he co-hosted with Dutch presenter Anita Witzier. He had a short stint with vtm, for which he hosted 'Tilt' (1993‚Äì1995), but soon returned to the VRT. He further hosted reality show \\"Wit in Vegas\\" (2005), in which he accompanied couples wanting to get married in Las Vegas.

Much of the Moser Gender Planning Framework is focused in improving women's conditions in the Third World.The Moser Gender Planning Framework is a tool for gender analysis in development planning. It was developed by Caroline Moser. The goal is to free women from subordination and allow them to achieve equality, equity, and empowerment. Origin Moser developed the Framework for a Gender and Development (GAD) approach to development planning in the 1980s while working at the Development Planning Unit (DPU) of the University of London. Working with Caren Levy, she expanded it into a methodology for gender policy and planning. Moser and Levy published A Theory and Method of Gender Planning ‚Äì Meeting Women's Practical and Strategic Needs as a DPU working paper in 1986. The framework is based on Moser's concepts of gender roles and gender needs, and her views on the ways policies should approach gender and development planning. Overview The Moser framework follows the Gender and Development approach in emphasizing the importance of gender relations. As with the WID-based Harvard Analytical Framework, it includes collection of quantitative empirical facts. Going further, it investigates the reasons and processes that lead to conventions of access and control. The Moser Framework includes gender roles identification, gender needs assessment, disaggregating control of resources and decision making within the household, planning for balancing the triple role, distinguishing between different aims in interventions and involving women and gender-aware organizations in planning. The framework acknowledges a political element to gender planning, and assumes that the process will have to deal with conflicts. The framework rests on three basic concepts: the triple role of women, practical and strategic gender needs and categories of WID/GAD policy approaches. The triple role consists of reproductive, productive and community-managing activities. Practical needs are ones that, if met, help women in current activities. Strategic needs are needs that, if met, transform the balance of power between men and women. Different categories of WID/GAD policy approach, which may or may not be appropriate, include welfare (top- down handouts), equity, anti-poverty, efficiency and empowerment. Tools The framework provides six tools. *Tool 1 identifies gender roles: what women, men, boys and girls do in various productive, reproductive and community- managing activities. *Tool 2 identifies the practical and strategic needs of women. *Tool 3 defines an access and control profile for resources and benefits of economic activity. *Tool 4 examines the impact that a new policy, project or program will have on the three roles. A change addressing one area may affect others in a positive or negative sense. *Tool 5 looks at how welfare, equity, anti-poverty, efficiency or empowerment approaches will address practical or strategic needs. The approaches are not mutually exclusive. * Tool 6 looks at way women and gender-aware organisations and individuals can be involved in the process. Limitations Although widely used, the framework has been subject to some criticism. The concept of gender roles may tend to obscure the concept of gender relationships. It may give a sense of a stable balance, acceptance of each person's normal activities and rights, when in fact there is ongoing negotiation, conflict and compromise. The framework does not consider evolution of the socioeconomic structure over time. The framework only addresses gender inequality and does not consider other types of inequality such as caste, class or race. Naila Kabeer has argued that the triple role concept obscures the distinction between activity and outcome. For example, the outcome of child care could be achieved by the mother at home, by a communal creche or through paid private or state facilities. These are very different in terms of their effect on women.

He reluctantly accepts Mihoshi's offer for him to train the girls for only three days initially, until he learns that the club is at the brink of being disbanded without his help, realizing how important it is to Tomoka and her friends. After helping save the basketball team, Subaru ends up agreeing to be their trainer until they graduate. ; : :Aoi is Subaru's childhood friend and also a former member of his school's basketball club, who displays feelings for him despite refusing to admit them. She is always prone to help Subaru when he is in trouble or depressed, but for some reason he avoids telling her he is coaching a team of elementary schoolgirls, until she follows him and finds it by herself.

In Keishin Academy, she found new friends and realized that winning is not everything. Despite the fact that she still loves basketball, Tomoka is not willing to play without having her friends with her. Of all the girls, Tomoka is the one who gets closest to Subaru and seems to be the one who likes him the most. Due to her talent in basketball, Subaru nicknamed her . ; : Team Jersey Number: 5 : Position: Power Forward : :Coming from an extremely wealthy family, Maho is the most energetic member of the team, who is always coming up with ideas that always seem to cause embarrassment for the other girls. She was the first of the girls to befriend Tomoka, as well as the reason Tomoka decided to form the girls' basketball club. She is afraid of the dark. She is also described by Takenaka to be a genius, quickly adapting to any sport she gains interest in. Unfortunately she also loses interest just as fast, which is the source of her split with him due to his seriousness of basketball and her developing interest. Due to her hyperactive nature, Touko-sensei nicknamed her . ; : Team Jersey Number: 6 : Position: Shooting Guard, Point Guard : :The bespectacled and level-headed member of the team, who keeps Maho in check whenever the latter goes overboard with her enthusiasm.

In fact, she even encourages Aya on the benefits of being the tallest on the court. She happens to be the oldest girl in the group as well, being born in April.

Fifth graders ; : Team Jersey Number: 9 : Position: Forward-Center : :Hinata's younger sister. Unlike the frail Hinata who has just recently learned basketball, Kagetsu has incredible stamina and is a marathon runner in school. One snowy day, while asleep alone at home, she did not notice Hinata coming back from school. When she woke up, she was horrified to find her freezing with cold outside their door. She believed that it severely weakened her body, and blamed herself for it. Since then, she worries about Hinata whenever she engages in physical activity. :When Hinata's team went to the beach, Kagetsu followed her there with the help of the school nurse Touko Hatano, and was shocked to see that their basketball coach is a high school boy.

He has also written for The New Yorker. The author of four books, he won a Thurber Prize for his second, Big Kiss, an account of his attempt to become a working actor. His book about manners, Would It Kill You to Stop Doing That?, was published in January 2012 and he currently writes a column about manners for The New York Times. Sometimes called an \\"investigative humorist,\\" he is primarily known for his first-person quests and exploits. These include creating a gourmet meal out of food purchased at a 99-Cent Store, walking the streets of New York City in his pajamas, inviting a restaurant health inspector to rate his apartment's kitchen while he was serving lunch to friends, and trying to pass the National Dog Groomers Association's certification test by applying lipstick to his cocker spaniel's snout and telling the test's judge, \\"I like a dog with a face.\\" His humor pieces for The New Yorker have included his imagining British taxi drivers reciting W.H. Auden's poetry to their passengers (which erroneously suggested citizens of the Northern city of York speak in the Cockney dialect) and a playlet composed entirely of Eugene O'Neill's stage directions. (Both are collected in the New Yorker's humor anthology, Disquiet Please, and the O'Neill playlet has been taught at M.I.T.) In September 2007, the magazine published Alford's account of wearing a solar-powered jacket for three weeks. He has contributed frequently to the Styles sections of the New York Times and to the New York Times Book Review, and written extensively about food and travel. His January 2013 article in the Travel section of the \\"New York Times\\" about Medellin, Colombia was referenced by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the Benghazi hearings. Early life Alford was raised in Worcester, Massachusetts. He has painted a fairly rollicking portrait of his childhood; of his and his siblings' singing of Christmas carols in church, he wrote, \\"We can make 'Angels We Have Heard on High' sound like a scrum of Panzers.\\" He began his college career at Bard College at Simon's Rock (then Simon's Rock College of Bard).communication with Institutional Advancement Office, Bard College at Simon's Rock Later, he transferred to New York University and worked as a casting director in the film industry for three years. =Spy Magazine= From 1988 to 1994, Alford wrote for Spy, the monthly satirical magazine edited and co-started by Graydon Carter and Kurt Andersen. He began by sending in articles and later earned a staff writer position. During his time at Spy, Alford contributed such pieces as \\"What if the Bront√´ Sisters Were a Heavy Metal Band?\\", \\"How Famous Actors Sold Themselves When They Were Trying to Become Famous,\\" and \\"You'll Never Groom Dogs in This Town Again.\\" In Spy: The Funny Years, the magazine's 20th Anniversary history/anthology, Alford recounts how he was once told by Spy founder Kurt Andersen to \\"never curb your tendency to aphorize.\\" Books =Municipal Bondage= Alford's first book, Municipal Bondage was published in February, 1994 by Random House. A collection of essays and articles, many of which were previously featured in Spy and other magazines, the book documents Alford's adventurous exploration of modern urban living, including his hiring of two nude housecleaners, his trying to find work as an earlobe model, his volunteering to serve as the driver for the governor of Colorado during the 1992 Democratic Convention, and his untrained attempts to pass a variety of vocational exams. In his review of Municipal Bondage for The New York Times Book Review, novelist Robert Plunket called Alford \\"...a classicist, firmly in the mold of Wilde, Waugh, Benchley, and Lebowitz.\\" =Big Kiss= Big Kiss: One Actor's Desperate Attempt to Claw His Way to the Top is Alford's memoir of his attempt, at the age of 34, to become a professional actor. In it he chronicles his summer training session at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, playing an extra in the remake of Godzilla, his trip to improvisational comedy camp with his 69-year-old mother, his audition to voice Wilbur the Pig in Charlotte's Web, and his work on a phone-sex party line. The New York Times called the book \\"the definitive work on theatrical humiliation.\\" Alford found success in his new career when he was cast as the co-host of the VH1 show Rock of Ages. On the show, Alford interviewed groups of children and senior citizens as they viewed and analyzed current music videos and memorabilia from rock 'n roll history. In his review of the show, Joel Stein wrote in Time magazine that Alford \\"elicits lines from small children that Bill Cosby sweats whirlpools trying to score.\\" Big Kiss was also the genesis for an Off-Off Broadway show, \\"Big Kiss: An Evening of Humiliating Audition Stories.\\" Co- produced and directed by his editor at Random House, Jonathan Karp, the show consisted of Alford and eight other actors performing self-written monologues about their most embarrassing audition experiences. Alford told John Tierney of The New York Times, \\"Once you call yourself a pathetic loser, you take that power away from others. You reclaim your pathos.\\" Alford added, \\"Imagine if postal workers had an evening like this. We could save some lives.\\" =How To Live= How To Live: A Search For Wisdom From Old People (While They Are Still On This Earth) documents Alford's journey to find and define the hard-won wisdom of the elderly. Early in the book, Alford describes the motivation behind his efforts: \\"If people are repositories of knowledge -- the death of an old person, an African saying runs, is like the burning of a library -- then I want a library card. I want borrowing privileges for the rest of my life.\\" Over the course of the book, Alford speaks with and visits a number of people over the age of seventy, some famous (playwright Edward Albee, actress Sylvia Miles, and literary critic Harold Bloom) and some offbeat (a Lutheran Pastor who thinks napping is a form of prayer; writer Sandra Tsing Loh's eccentric retired aerospace engineer father, who eats food out of the garbage), with the hopes that they might reveal some kind of sagacity that they have accrued over their lengthy lifespan. When Alford asks his own mother, Ann, and step-father, Will, to reflect on what they've learned from their own experiences, he is the inadvertent catalyst to the couple's divorce. The book then follows Ann as she puts her wisdom on practical display, choosing to open a new chapter late in her life. The book was named a Best Book of the Year by Publisher's Weekly. Newsweek called Alford \\"the Socrates of dilettantes.\\" Reviewer Alex Beam wrote in the New York Times Book Review that when Alford tried to pass off a 14-year-old cat as a wise individual, Beam wrote in the margin of his copy of How to Live, \\"Check, please!\\" =Would It Kill You To Stop Doing That?= Would It Kill You To Stop Doing That?: A Modern Guide To Manners is Alford's fourth book and was released on January 3, 2012. In the book, Alford acts as a tour guide for foreigners; travels to the manners capital of the world, Japan; and speaks with manners experts ranging from Miss Manners and Tim Gunn to a former prisoner and an army sergeant, all in the hopes of finding \\"ways we can treat each other better.\\" The book was reviewed positively by The New York Times, Publishers Weekly, The Boston Globe, The Washington Post, and Salon.com. Alford has written about manners for The New York Times and Vanity Fair. Other works =Collages= Alford has written a number of fact-based humor articles in the style of collages. Their subject matter has included book acknowledgements, politician apologies, and bed and breakfast brochures. =Radio= Alford has contributed often to the public radio show \\"Studio 360\\"; his pieces include taking a former gang member to see the Broadway production of \\"West Side Story\\", starting his own artists colony, and creating a musical composition from the noises made by the radiator in his and others' apartments. He has also been heard on \\"Fresh Air\\", \\"All Things Considered\\", and the now defunct The Next Big Thing. Personal life Alford lives in New York City in a part of town he calls \\"the Adorable Restaurants district\\". He is openly gay. Alford's website states that his love of waffles has \\"caused small children to call him Henry Alfun\\". In an August, 2011 Vanity Fair article about Facebook, in which Alford likened having a Facebook page to \\"curating a tiny museum of ambiguous friendship,\\" Alford wrote that his Facebook friends include \\"Stupid Pet Tricks inventor Merrill Markoe, actresses Martha Plimpton and Sarah Thyre, the New Yorker's Rebecca Mead and Nancy Franklin\\" and 124 Greek priests. Alford graduated from Eaglebrook School in Deerfield, Massachusetts, but was kicked out of the prestigious boarding school, Hotchkiss, at age 16. On the occasion of being published in the New Yorker for the first time, Alford was told by his stepfather, \\"Thank God you're gay.\\" Alford has written about his late father's bon vivantism and alcoholism. (Alford's father, inebriated, once got in the backseat of the family car and, prepared to drive but sensing something was amiss, accused his wife of having stolen the steering wheel.) Alford's father once told his wife that he had a job in Stamford, Ct., but a year later Mrs. Alford discovered that her husband was unemployed and spending a lot of time in bars.

They are recognised under the Offender Management Act 2007, and can provoke a hostile reception in the communities in which they are located. There are one hundred such hostels in England and Wales, and a further six in Northern Ireland. Fourteen of the APs in England and Wales were banned from housing child sex offenders in 2006 following a media campaign, which has led to some criticism. Description Formerly known as either probation or bail hostels, the properties became known as Approved Premises once recognised under section 13 of the Offender Management Act 2007. They are still commonly called bail hostels in the media, although they house few offenders actually on bail with the majority of residents made up of those on release from prison on licence. There are one hundred Approved Premises in England and Wales, providing over two thousand residential bed spaces for offenders in the community, with a normal hostel holding between twelve and thirty offenders. They are run by either voluntary organisations or the National Probation Service, and may house high risk offenders. In 2006, fourteen of the hundred hostels were banned by the Ministry of Justice from housing child sex offenders after a media campaign due to those hostels' proximity to schools and nurseries. This has shown to have had an effect on housing such offenders, and in some cases they have been released without proper supervision, and in one case led to a child sex offender being housed temporarily in a Premier Inn hotel. In addition, the clustering of APs in certain areas have led to them being blamed for the increasing numbers of registered sex offenders in the surrounding areas. While staff provide support to the offenders and run programmes to address offending issues, they do not conduct searches of individual offenders and will use local police assistance as necessary. A staff to resident ratio of one to five is typical, with most staff made up of trained professionals, while night time staff may be from private security firms. Approved Premises are also run in Northern Ireland, which had six APs as of 2008. A report looked into the APs in Northern Ireland during 2008, and reported on their uneven distribution throughout the region and the volume of work conducted by staff. All of the Northern Irish APs are run by voluntary or community providers. Reception and controversy There can be opposition to locating an Approved Premises in a community, with certain communities mounting protests against them. A particularly long running campaign has been run against an AP in Stonall Road, Aldridge by the local residents. Local media in that case have highlighted when high-profile offenders, including child sex offenders, have been resident. Reports have shown that local opposition is a major obstacle to opening APs in new locations, and although expansion schemes have been announced in the past, the current number of hostels has remained relatively stable in the last five years. Official spokespersons have said that \\"Approved Premises are safer for the public than the alternative which is to disperse such offenders in the local community immediately after release, making supervision much less effective.\\" BBC documentary Panorama investigated the Brigstocke Road and Ashley Road hostels in Bristol during November 2006. The program showed a child sex offender interacting with children, and even bringing one into his room at the hostel. Brigstocke Road was identified as a property near to a nursery and became one of the properties which later had a ban on it housing child sex offenders. Ashley House was unaffected.

In August 1946, Fargues saved the lives of Cousteau and Fr√©d√©ric Dumas during their dive into the Fountain of Vaucluse. On September 17, 1947, while attempting to set a new depth record, Maurice Fargues became the first diver to die using an aqualung.  GRS and the Fountain of Vaucluse  In late 1945, Petty Officer Maurice Fargues joined the newly formed GRS (now called CEPHISMER), commanded by Philippe Tailliez, with Cousteau as its deputy commander and Dumas as civilian adviser and chief diver. Dumas trained Fargues and the GRS' other two new recruits, Petty Officers Jean-Paul Pinard and Guy Morandi√®re, as Aqua-Lung divers. Maurice Fargues became commander of the diving tender VP 8, a 21,6-meter (72-foot) twin-screw launch. On August 27, 1946, the GRS dove into the Fountain of Vaucluse, a mysterious spring in the village of Vaucluse, hoping to discover the secret of its yearly flooding. Maurice Fargues was the operation's surface commander, in charge of the guide rope which allowed divers to communicate with the surface. Tailliez and Morandi√®re dove together first, but they were rapidly affected by a narcosis that almost compromised their return to the surface. When Cousteau and Dumas dove together, they suffered the same symptoms, and Tailliez and Fargues probably saved their lives by pulling them back up to the surface. It was later determined that carbon monoxide had unexpectedly contaminated the air in their cylinders.  Death  In September 1947, just before the \\"Salon Nautique\\" in Paris, Cousteau pushed to organize a series of deep diving attempts to determine the maximum depth a scuba diver could reach. On September 17, Maurice Fargues made the first deep diving attempt near the French Navy base at Toulon. Maurice Fargues descended an anchor line with marker slates attached at 10 metre intervals, allowing him to sign his name on them to certify the depth he had reached, and periodically tugged on a safety line attached to his weight belt to let his colleague Fr√©d√©ric Dumas on the surface know that he was alive. After three minutes, at a record-setting depth of , Maurice Fargues stopped signalling. Philippe Tailliez ordered that he be pulled up, and Jean Pinard dove to meet him at 60 meters depth, only to discover that Fargues was unconscious, his mouthpiece hanging on his chest. Resuscitation attempts were continued for twelve hours, but Fargues was dead. Nitrogen narcosis or oxygen toxicity had caused him to lose his mouthpiece and drown.

In the words of Jacques Cousteau: \\"Dumas and I owed our lives to Maurice Fargues, who had resurrected us from the death cave at Vaucluse.

In addition to his given name, he makes music under the names Last Lizard and Dirty Beaches. Zhang released several EPs and three albums as Dirty Beaches on cassette-only labels before releasing his fourth full-length, Badlands, in March 2011.\\"Sadness suits Dirty Beaches\\". The Georgia Straight, May 25, 2011. Badlands, unlike Zhang's earlier work, included his vocals on most songs. The album was long listed as a nominee for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize.\\"2011 Polaris Music Prize Long List announced\\" . aux.tv, June 16, 2011. Drifters/Love Is The Devil followed in 2013, pushing further into no wave, electronic music, jazz and ambient territory. In 2014 Zhang decided to end the Dirty Beaches project after releasing the instrumental album Stateless, on which he played sax. As Last Lizard, Zhang collaborated with jazz and improvisational musicians and released new solo pieces on Soundcloud, Vimeo and Vine. In 2016 Zhang released the instrumental piano album Knave of Hearts under his own name. Zhang has also recorded original film soundtracks for several documentaries, including Water Park (2012) and Who Is Arthur Chu? (2017), in addition to directing music videos for himself and others. History Dirty Beaches began as a one-man band, sometimes employing sampling, inspired by Zhang's longtime love of hip hop. In addition to his own years moving between countries and on the road touring, films are one of Zhang's influences, particularly those by Wong Kar-wai. Zhang said Wong's movies are \\"usually about the passage of time, and how in relation it distorts your relationship with everything else in life. The central Dirty Beaches character is a product of those experiences. Of someone traveling long distances in search of something, in exile, misplaced, with no home to return to.\\" Zhang has lived in Taipei, Queens, Etobicoke, Honolulu, San Francisco, Shanghai, Vancouver, Montreal, Berlin, Lisbon and Los Angeles, among other cities. Dirty Beaches has released work on record labels throughout the world since his first album Old Blood came out on Montreal's Fixture Records in 2007. Dirty Beaches has recorded and toured with musicians such as Dum Dum Girls, U.S. Girls, Ela Orleans and Xiu Xiu. In 2011, Zhang was able to leave a kitchen job to play music full-time. First touring solo, he then put together a live band with sax player Francesco De Gallo and drummer Jesse Locke. On tour, Dirty Beaches moved away from the sample-based rock n roll of Badlands to embrace a more improvised sound. In 2012, guitarist Shub Roy and electronic musician Bernardino Femminielli joined Dirty Beaches live and in the studio, and they remain members of the band as of 2013. After the release of Badlands and a number of EPs and collaborations, Dirty Beaches recorded 75 minutes of new material in late 2012 and early 2013. One set of songs, Drifters, was begun at La Brique recording space in Montreal and features Zhang's vocals and songwriting, along with instrumental contributions by Roy and Femminielli and former bandmates De Gallo and Locke. Making use of live instruments- guitar, bass, keyboard, drum machines and saxophones- arranged into original loops, none of the eight songs include any samples of previously existent recordings, a change from Zhang's previous working methods. During the course of recording Drifters, Zhang's relationship of several years ended in Canada and he relocated to the studio of friend Anton Newcombe in Berlin, where he finished the record and also recorded Love is the Devil, an instrumental set of eight songs, in late hours when the studio was not in use. Drifters/Love Is The Devil was released as a double LP, as well as on a single CD and in digital formats, by the Zoo Music label in May 2013. In November, Dirty Beaches played the All Tomorrow's Parties festival held at the seaside resort of Camber Sands, United Kingdom. In August 2014, Dirty Beaches announced his 3rd album, Stateless, which would be entirely instrumental and released in November 2014. In a series of tweets in October 2014, Dirty Beaches announced their breakup.  Post-Dirty Beaches solo career  In early 2015, Zhang began releasing music under the project name of Last Lizard. He also started releasing music under his own name. According to Pitchfork, \\"since retiring the Dirty Beaches moniker in 2014, having completed the transition from songs to soundscaping, Zhang has fully indulged his newfound aesthetic freedom. Whether he's releasing meditative piano instrumentals, forming violent free-jazz trios, or constructing dark, dissonant sound collages with Love Theme, Zhang is never afraid to expose his work's jagged edges. He's long favored a raw field- recording ambience that amplifies the overarching sense of improvised experiments being caught on tape in real time.\\" On June 4, 2017, Zhang appeared in the fifth, David Lynch-directed episode of the revived third season of Twin Peaks. Playing with Dean Hurley and Riley Lynch as part of the group Trouble, Zhang played sax in the scene. The song, \\"Snake Eyes,\\" was issued as a single by Sacred Bones Records. In January 2018, he appeared alongside Jessica Henwick and Kiko Mizuhara in the short film \\"Yo! My Saint\\", directed by Ana Lily Amirpour and featuring music from Karen O and Michael Kiwanuka promoting the fashion label Kenzo's spring line. In July 2018, Zhang released the album Divine Weight. The recording process for Divine Weight originated with Zhang's dissatisfaction with his saxophone recordings prompting him to feed them through a laptop, \\"manipulating the sounds into entirely new forms, like rusted copper piping stripped out of an abandoned building and melted down into shiny, interwoven wiring.\\" The recordings were influenced by Chilean-French mystic and filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky, and the cover shows a distorted image of the recently deceased Japanese Butoh dancer Kazuo Ohno.

She is a member of the Federation of Canadian Artists (FCA) since 2000. Abstract themes are dominant in artist's work and expressionism is felt throughout all paintings. Author's poems are mostly influenced by neo-romanticism and modern rhyming techniques. In regard to fashion accessories, they are massive but with a close attention to the detail ‚Äì giving a social status. Early life Buz≈´naitƒó-≈Ωukaitienƒó's ancestors were minor aristocrats. However, when she was around ten her parents' house burned down so she spent many years living with her relatives. The artist left home when she was sixteen and started studying to become a librarian because of her love for books. In 1978, she began working in the House of Culture of Medvilne. At this time her poems started being published in newspapers and used in national and international events. The artist also tried her skills in commercial photography and business. Artist's career As art critic Rasa Sarkauskaite (2000) has noticed Buz≈´naitƒó-≈Ωukaitienƒó entered Lithuanian art world unexpectedly. The paintings were full of temperament and not bound by any rules ‚Äì they did not follow art school rules. Art critics compared her work to well known Georgia O'Keeffe who was painting in the beginning of the 20th century. Especially, the similarities are seen in the paintings collection Cactuses, the same synthesis of erotic, poetic and strong colour motives. Another art critic Romualdas Alekna (2001) referred to the artist as a phenomenon defined by Ignacy Witz in his book The Great Self-Taught Artists (1961). Romualdas Alekna (2005) has also stressed that Buz≈´naitƒó-≈Ωukaitienƒó never repeats herself, there are no repetitive motives ‚Äì just all original work. Furthermore, painting's composition is well balanced with abstract and figurative details.

Geographic distribution The native range of the Bigeye chub includes the Lake Ontario and Lake Erie drainages in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan as well as the Ohio River basin from New York to eastern Illinois and south to the Tennessee River drainage, Georgia and Alabama, and the Ozarks of southern Missouri, northern Arkansas, and northeastern Oklahoma. There is one record of this species in the Cottonwood River in Kansas. It is absent from the Missouri River drainage. This species in endangered in Illinois. Ecology The Bigeye chub is a freshwater fish of the United States. It prefers a habitat near riffles in quiet water with aquatic vegetation, in small to moderate size, clear-water tributaries with a sand, gravel, or rocky substrate. It is highly intolerant of siltation. Characteristics This species has a long, blunt snout with a down turned, overhanging mouth. It is a light greenish yellow color, besides the black lateral stripe stretching from its mouth to the tail. Like other Hybopisis, this genus has a single mouth barbel that contains taste buds. The bigeye chub has an elliptical eye shape that is directed upward. They reach about 2 to 3 inches in length. Their diet consists of aquatic insects such as different kinds of larvae and large mayfly. History The Bigeye chub experienced drastic population declines in the mid 20th century. In the 1970's and 1980's, they were so rapidly disappearing they were thought to be extirpated. With recovery methods and research, a steady increase has been seen since 2000 in central Illinois. However, they are still considered endangered.

Its synonym is Notropis amnis.Phillips, Gary L., Schmid, William D., and Underhill, James C. 1982. Fishes of the Minnesota Region. University of Minnesota Press. Minneapolis, MN. pg. 133 They are native to North America and can be found in the Mississippi watershed. The pallid shiner is considered a rare fish in its northern distribution but not in its southern distribution. The pallid shiner was first discovered in the early 1900s in the St. Croix river north of Taylor Falls, and its population has been declining since. Little is known about their feeding and reproductive habits.  Physical description  The pallid shiner is a small silver fish with very little pigmentation on its fusiform body and like most fishes, it is laterally flattened.Pallid Shiner, University of Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute, 2013. Retrieved 2015-04-23 The only marking on its body is a thin lateral stripe that extends from its head to its tail. The scales on its body are composed of round lateral scales called cycloid scales. It has a slightly subterminal mouth and no adipose fin. Like other members of the family Cyprinidae, the pallid shiner is a toothless fish and has no stomach. Instead they chew their food using gill rakers on their gills and pharyngeal teeth.Cyprinidae, Carps and Minnows. Encyclopedia of Life. . 2010. Retrieved 2015-05-07. Its caudal fin is white and is forked with pointed tips. The dorsal fin of the pallid shiner is high and has eight soft rays.Eddy, S., and J. C. Underhill. 1974. Northern fishes, with special reference to the Upper Mississippi Valley. Third edition. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, Minnesota. 414 pp. The pelvic fins are abdominal.  Geographic distribution  Today the pallid shiner can be found in the Mississippi river basin from southern Wisconsin and Minnesota to Louisiana. Specifically its distribution is from the Mississippi valley north to the St. Croix river in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Its southern distribution is to the Amite river in Louisiana and west to the Guadalupe river in Texas.Kwak, T.J. 1951. Ecological characteristics of a northern population of the pallid shiner. Transactions of the American Fisheries Society. 120:106-115. The pallid shiner is very rare in its northern distribution and there are more abundant populations in its southern distribution. Historically the pallid shiner was abundant in the state of Missouri, but the populations there declined greatly.Skelly, T. M., and Sule, M. J. 1983. The pallid shiner, Notropis amnis Hubbs and Greene, a rare Illinois Fish. Transactions of the Illinois State Academy of Science. 76:131-138. Distribution of the Pallid Shiner fish in United States  Habitat  As mentioned before, the pallid shiner is distributed in many rivers. These rivers are typically medium to large rivers. They can also be found more downstream of sand and gravel bars in streams.Hybopsis amnis Hubbs and Greene. 1951. Species Profile: Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Pallid shiners prefer slow moving waters and quiet waters over sand and silty bottoms.NatureServe 2013. Hybopsis amnis. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2014.3. . Retrieved on 02 May 2015. Because of increased human activity in the rivers that they are found, sedimentation has become more of a problem for the pallid shiners.  Conservation status  The pallid shiner is listed as least concern because, although its distribution and abundance have been reduced, the number of subpopulations and populations are still relatively large and have not declined greatly. Until recently the pallid shiner was thought to have become regionally extinct in Illinois, but was then rediscovered in the Kankakee River. It has been affected by sedimentation and increased human activity in the rivers that it is found in.

Wedgwood closed the Los Angeles plant, and moved the production of dinnerware to England in 1983. Waterford Glass Group plc purchased Wedgwood in 1986, becoming Waterford Wedgwood. KPS Capital Partners acquired all of the holdings of Waterford Wedgwood in 2009. The Franciscan brand became part of a group of companies known as WWRD, an acronym for \\"Wedgwood Waterford Royal Doulton.\\" WWRD continues to produce the Franciscan patterns Desert Rose and Apple. Trade names were Franciscan Pottery, Franciscan Ware, and Franciscan for dinnerware products. Trade names for tile products were Gladding, McBean, Interpace, Hermosa, Terra Tile, and Contours Tile. Ceramic production included terracotta garden ware, earthenware tableware & art ware, porcelain tableware & art ware, stoneware tableware, stoneware and earthenware tile. Currently only the trade name Franciscan is used by WWRD for tabletop products. Franciscan Desert Rose Franciscan AppleFranciscan Ivy  Gladding, McBean & Co.  Beginning in 1875, as a partnership between Charles Gladding, Peter McGill McBean, and George Chambers, Gladding, McBean & Co. would expand from one factory in Lincoln, California to multiple manufacturing plants throughout the Pacific West Coast producing clay products from sewer pipe to architectural terracotta. In 1927, Gladding, McBean & Co. consolidated with Los Angeles Pressed Brick Company solidifying the primacy of Gladding, McBean & Co. as the largest terra cotta manufacturer west of the Mississippi. Gladding, McBean & Co. retained ceramic engineer Max Compton from the former Los Angeles Pressed Brick Company's plant in Santa Monica California. Compton, a 1922 graduate of Alfred University, studied under Charles F. Binns. In 1929, Compton was sent to the Company's Lincoln plant to work on glazes and shortly thereafter became the plant's superintendent of the terracotta department. Compton would return to Los Angeles in 1937 to work in the glaze laboratory. Due to the economic collapse of 1929, Gladding, McBean & Co. saw its revenue decreasing due to the cessation of new construction, the main source of the demand for its ceramic products: roofing tile, sewer pipe, architectural terracotta, and brick. To offset the loss of revenues from the sales of ceramic building materials, the Company began the manufacture of earthenware dinnerware and art ware in 1933 in the former Tropico Potteries factory. Tropico Potteries was acquired by the company in 1923. The forty acre pottery, located at 2901 Los Feliz Boulevard in Los Angeles, California, bordered the city of Glendale. Gladding, McBean & Co. had two plant facilities in Los Angeles, so the former Tropico pottery was named the Glendale plant. = 1934‚Äì1939 = In 1934, Gladding, McBean & Co. hired Frederic J. Grant as a vice-president and the new Glendale dinnerware division's plant manager. Frederic, a chemical engineer, had retired as president of the Weller Pottery Company in Ohio, selling off his interest in the company. After becoming tired of touring around the country as a well known amateur golfer, he made up his mind to become active in business again. Mary K. Grant, prior to her marriage to Frederic, was the art director at R. H. Macy Co. in New York City. The company agreed to have Mary Grant style the pottery lines of tableware and art ware; however at this time she would not hold an official position. The tableware and art ware lines were produced in solid color glazes. Three other Southern California companies were already in production of solid colored dinnerware: J. A. Bauer Pottery Co., Pacific Clay Products Co., and Catalina Clay Products Division of Santa Catalina Island Co. Laboratory testing on the three competitive dinnerware lines revealed all three crazed in an autoclave test. Gladding, McBean & Co.‚Äôs ware would be produced in a new patented earthenware clay body known as Malinite. Dr. Andrew Malinovsky developed the high talc one-fire body using an amorphous flux in 1928 for Gladding, McBean & Co. Malinite was developed for use in the production of one-fire clay tile; however the company made the decision to use Malinite for their dinnerware production. By using the Malinite and adjusting the kiln temperature for a one fire process, the company solved the crazing problem in their own product. Glaze was applied to the unfired body, and the glaze and body matured together in the kiln, saving the company the time and expense of separate biscuit firing for the body. For the new line of pottery, Gladding, McBean & Co. decided to use Prouty tunnel kilns. The Prouty tunnel kiln patents were acquired in the purchase of the West Coast holdings of the American Encaustic Tiling Company in 1933. Prouty tunnel kilns allowed for the continuous flow of ware through the kiln to fire pottery. Thus the plant ‚Äúcombined mills, jiggering units, conveyors, dryers and kilns into a model of straight line output.‚Äù Oxblood glaze After the successful introduction of Franciscan Ware to Gladding, McBean & Co.‚Äôs products, Mary K. Grant in 1936 became a paid employee as Lead Stylist and Manager of the Glendale plant‚Äôs design department. Mary Grant designed many of the shapes and patterns for Franciscan Ware. The company also purchased shape and pattern designs from contract designers, which would either be used or adapted by Mary Grant for use in the various Franciscan Ware lines of dinnerware and art ware. To sell and market the dinnerware, the company first used the trade name of Franciscan Pottery. Later deciding the word ‚Äúpottery‚Äù denoted an inferior product, the company changed the trade name to Franciscan Ware. In 1937, Max Compton transferred from Gladding, McBean & Co.‚Äôs Lincoln Plant to the Glendale Plant to work on Franciscan Ware glazes, and by 1939 he took over the development the company‚Äôs glazes for all of their ceramic products. In an article for Popular Ceramics, Norris Leap wrote, ‚ÄúHe produced glazes for art ware that possibly never could have been equaled by either moderns or ancients ‚Ä¶ One of them is an oxblood red used on large decorative bowls and vases. He experimented with that glaze in odd moments over a period of a dozen or fifteen years. The color comes out in the kiln. By control of heat he controlled the behavior of the coloring. Another unique glaze he produced was a Persian blue, a turquoise blue with pebble effect. Those were just two glazes of thousands he produced.‚Äù Gladding, McBean & Co. acquired Catalina Clay Products on Catalina Island in 1937. Production of Catalina pottery was moved to the Glendale plant with the shapes being integrated into the company's art ware and dinnerware lines. Gladding, McBean & Co. continued to use the trademark Catalina Pottery for art wares. = 1940‚Äì1951 = Franciscan Fine China pattern Gold Band introduced in 1949 In 1940, the Gladding, McBean & Co. introduced their first hand-painted embossed earthenware dinnerware line Franciscan Apple, and shortly thereafter in 1941, Desert Rose. Apple was adapted from the embossed pattern Zona, produced by the Weller Pottery Company of Ohio. Desert Rose was based on a pattern design by contract designer Annette Honeywell. Desert Rose would become one of Gladding, McBean & Co.‚Äôs bestselling dinnerware lines. In 1942, after three years of experimentation, Gladding, McBean & Co. entered the fine china market with 14 patterns. The china was considered to have a medium to high cost. The glaze for the fine china line was developed by Max Compton with the shapes and patterns designed by Mary K. Grant, the design staff, and by contract designers. In 1942, World War II curtailed the introduction of new dinnerware lines and shapes. The Company continued to produce ware already in production, however discontinued all art ware lines. After World War II, the Southern California ceramic industry was booming. From garages to industrial plant facilities, pottery was being made to satisfy demand from the decline of imports from Europe and Japan. Competitors and the biggest potteries in Southern California were Gladding, McBean & Company, J. A. Bauer Pottery Co., Vernon Kilns, and Metlox Potteries. In 1948, the Company introduced Encanto, a new line of Franciscan fine china designed by Mary Grant. Encanto was introduced in a clear glaze, with or without platinum or gold banding. Encanto, in a clear glaze without banding, was chosen for The Museum of Modern Art 1951 Good Design Exhibition in New York. Also in 1948 the Company introduced Franciscan Ivy, a hand-painted embossed dinnerware pattern. Franciscan Ivy was designed and carved by Mary Jane Winans, a contract designer. = 1952-1954 = In 1952, a great change was occurring in the direction of the Gladding, McBean & Co., Atholl McBean, president from 1923 to 1938 and chairman of the board since 1938, decided to retire as Chairman though remaining on the Board of Directors. During his fifty four years of service, Atholl guided the company to a position of being one of the most important ceramic companies in the United States. Also in the fall of 1952, Frederic and Mary Grant resigned from Gladding, McBean & Co. With a new President and Chairman of the Board, the company reorganized. A. Lee Bennett became vice president of the newly formed research and development division at the Glendale plant carrying out the company policy of product diversification to maintain its trade position. Under Bennett, Max Compton would continue as chief glaze ceramic engineer and a new design department was created with Mary Jane Winans as the chief designer and stylist. Joining Winans in the newly formed design department were George T. James and Otto Lund. The tile department was managed and headed by Sheridan ‚ÄúSherry‚Äù Stanton, son of architect J.E. Stanton architect of Honnold Library for the Associated Colleges at Claremont. Gladding, McBean & Co. continued to produce their trademarked Franciscan Hermosa tile products at the Glendale plant. Mary Jane Winans graduated with a degree in Design and Decorative Arts from the Vancouver School of Art, Vancouver B.C. She taught at Vancouver School of Art for two years. Winans became a dinnerware decorator for three years in the decorating department of Gladding, McBean & Co.‚Äôs Glendale plant. After her employment as a decorator, Winans worked as a freelance industrial designer in the ceramic industry in the Los Angeles area for twelve years. As a freelance designer for Gladding, McBean & Co., she designed the embossed hand-painted dinnerware patterns Franciscan Ivy and California Poppy. Also she modeled and carved the shapes for the embossed dinnerware patterns Franciscan Apple, Desert Rose, Franciscan Ivy, and California Poppy. George T. James, an Alfred University graduate hired by Gladding, McBean & Co. in 1950 as a ceramic engineer was promoted to the design department. James, an admitted devotee of the Bauhaus movement, sought to bring this aesthetic to his design work. Otto Lund emigrated from Denmark in 1947. He was a pattern designer by trade and prior to his employment at Gladding, McBean & Co. he was the former director of Castleton China's design and decorating department. Lund's mastery was in the painting of flora and fauna, and he used this mastery in designing patterns for the Franciscan fine china lines. Besides designing surface patterns, Lund designed and participated in the development of dinnerware shapes. The new design team was quickly put into action designing new earthenware dinnerware shapes and patterns to be included in the Gladding, McBean & Co.‚Äôs 1954 Franciscan Ware marketing promotion Modern Americana. The Modern Americana promotion included a group of seven new patterns on three different shapes, to complement Franciscan‚Äôs popular hand-painted embossed dinnerware lines; Apple, Desert Rose, and Ivy. Two new lines with unique shapes were designed for Modern Americana; the 1800 Eclipse shape designed by George T. James and the 1900 Flair shape designed by Mary Jane Winans. The only shape not designed for Modern Americana was the Metropolitan shape. The Metropolitan shape was designed for Gladding, McBean & Co. by Morris B. Sanders to be included in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's 1940 Exhibition of Contemporary American Industrial Art. The shape was adapted into a dinnerware line sold by the company as the matt glazed Metropolitan Service from 1940-42. From 1948-54, the shapes were sold in gloss glazes as the dinnerware line Tiempo. Surface patterns for the Modern Americana dinnerware group were Eclipse White, Pomegranate, and Starburst on the Eclipse shape; Flair White, Echo, and Woodlore on the Flair shape; and Trio on the Metropolitan shape. Mary C. Brown, a contract designer, designed the surface patterns Starburst and Pomegranate for the Eclipse shape. For the Flair shape, Brown designed the surface pattern Echo and Woodlore was designed by the contract design group, The Millers. George T. James‚Äô wife Esta James, a ceramist whose ceramics were exhibited at The Egg & The Eye gallery in Los Angeles, designed the surface pattern Trio for the Metropolitan shape. The Modern American group of dinnerware patterns was marketed in the company's promotions in 1954; however the promotion of this grouping ceased in 1955 with all the patterns being folded into the general earthenware lines sold by the Company. = 1955-1961 = In 1955, Gladding, McBean & Co. introduced a new art ware line. The company had ceased manufacturing all their earthenware art ware lines under the trademarks of Franciscan and Catalina in 1942. However, the Company continued until 1955 to manufacture fine china blanks for the Max Shoenfeld Company and earthenware lamp bases for outside companies to assemble and sell under their trade names. This new Franciscan line was named Contours by George T. James. The Contours art ware line was sold in one color or duotone glazes, with or without decoration. The Contours art ware line was the only art ware or dinnerware line the company allowed the designer to use their name on the promotion and marketing. Three Franciscan Contours bud vases were chosen for the Pasadena Art Museum's second California Design Exhibition in 1956. Franciscan Contours did not appeal to the buying public, and was discontinued shortly after its introduction.Franciscan Contours by George T. James The late 1950s brought foreign imports flooding the American dinnerware market as well as the introduction of new competitive dinnerware manufacturing processes, melamine used in the brand Melmac and CorningWare by Corning Glass Works, placing pressure on Gladding, McBean & Co. to manufacture and market lower cost dinnerware lines to compete in the lower price tier dinnerware market. The only lower priced dinnerware line, introduced in 1958, to be manufactured in the Glendale plant was the earthenware Family China line designed by George T. James. Two lower priced dinnerware lines were produced in Japan and introduced in 1959. The earthenware Whitestone Ware, designed by George T. James, was manufactured by Toyo Toki Kaisha, and the Cosmopolitan China, designed by Mary Jane Winans, was manufactured by Nippon Toki Kaisha. Even with adding dinnerware lines to compete in the lower priced tiers, Gladding, McBean & Co. saw revenue fall in the dinnerware division. However, revenue was up in all other divisions. Aside from the dinnerware division, which was marketed throughout the United States and exported to other countries, the company was limited in all their other product divisions to distribution to the west coast states. To expand the market for all their products, the company made the decision to merge with an established East coast company to create a national and international corporation.  Interpace  In 1962, West coast based Gladding, McBean & Company merged with East coast based Lock Joint Pipe Company merged, forming a new corporation: International Pipe and Ceramics Corporation. The Lock Joint Pipe Company, based in New Jersey, was the largest producer of pre-stressed concrete pressure pipe in the United States and one of the leading manufacturers of concrete sewer, culvert, and sub-aqueous pipe. The merged companies became one of the four hundred largest corporations in the United States with sales of over one hundred million. Allan M. Hirsh, Jr., the former President of Lock Joint became the President of the newly formed corporation. Atholl McBean would continue to give his guidance to the corporation and serve as a member of the board. International Pipe and Ceramics Corporation's corporate name was later changed to Interpace: from International Pipe and Ceramics. The former corporate headquarters for Gladding, McBean & Co. were moved to Interpace's new corporate headquarters‚Äô in Parsippany, New Jersey. Management in New Jersey began their new mandate to overhaul operations in all their divisions. Gladding, McBean's former Glendale plant was now Franciscan Ceramics, Inc., a division of Interpace. = 1963-1978 = Millard Sheets was hired as a consultant to Interpace in 1963. One of his projects included the development of a new design staff for tile and dinnerware. George T. James resigned. Elliot House was hired as the manager of the dinnerware design department. Elliot House was formerly the design manager for the Southern California pottery Vernon Kilns. In 1966, George T. James returned as the manager of design & development department replacing Elliot House. Hired on a contract basis for designing tile were ceramists Dora De Larios, Harrison McIntosh, and Jerry Rothman. Hired on a contract basis for designing dinnerware were ceramists Richard Petterson and Helen Richter Watson. Hired full-time as dinnerware designers were Rupert J. Deese, and Francis Chun, joining Mary Jane Winans and Otto Lund. Ceramist Henry Takemoto joined Max Compton in the glaze department. In 1969, Henry Takemoto was hired as a full-time dinnerware designer. Notable ceramists hired on a consultant basis included Kenneth Price in the research & development group and Chouinard Art Institute graduates Mineo Mizuno and Elsa Rady were hired as trainee designers in 1968. Hilton Rainbow Village: Rainbow Tower The tile design team innovated new glazes and methods for decorating 12\\" by 12\\" tiles for wall murals. Major ceramic tile wall murals completed and still in existence include: Jules Stein Eye Institute outpatient clinic at UCLA, donated by Walt Disney and designed by Mary Blair (1966); North and South facades of the Honolulu Hilton Rainbow hotel, designed by Millard Sheets (1968); Disney World Contemporary Resort, Grand Canyon Concourse fourth floor lobby, designed by Mary Blair (1970); and Los Angeles City Hall East Family of Man West and East facades, designed by Millard Sheets (1972). The dinnerware design team designed the Madeira line of patterns, an innovative studio potter shape dinnerware. One of the companies top selling pattern on the Madeira shape designed by Rupert J. Deese was the pattern Madeira designed by Jerry Rothman with a dark glaze developed by Kathy Takemoto. The company also introduced a new fine china shape. The 7000 shape was designed by George T. James. Francis Chun designed many of the patterns on the 7000 shape. = 1968-1978 = In 1968, Interpace acquired its second largest company, Shenango China. Shenango was the owner and maker of Castleton China and was a large supplier of restaurant china. Shenango had acquired Mayer China in 1964 was included in the acquisition. The design staff of each division was maintained separately. However, Shenango manufactured Franciscan's Gourmet line of stoneware dinnerware and cookware. Franciscan Gourmet was designed by Otto Lund and Jeffrey Tousley. In 1969, Interpace purchased the Tiffin Glass Company, Tiffin, Ohio and began to manufacture glass to coordinate with their Franciscan dinnerware lines. Expanding Franciscan ware to the European market, Interpace bought the Alfred Meakin company of Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, England and Myott, Son & Co. Ltd. The Madeira line shapes were adapted to the existing equipment of the Alfred Meakin pottery by George T. James to produce the pattern Madeira and other Franciscan patterns for the European market. Millard Sheets resigned as a consultant to the Franciscan Ceramics division in 1973. \\"In 1975, the division suffered from the adverse effects of the general economy. The nation's longest recession since World War II drained consumer confidence and led to lower real spending on consumer household durables.\\" In 1976 Interpace sold Alfred Meakin to a group of investors and the former Gladding, McBean Lincoln plant to Pacific Coast Building Products. In 1977, all fine china products were discontinued. Mary Jane Winans and Otto J. Lund retired, and George T. James and Mineo Mizuno resigned in 1977.  Wedgwood 1979-present  In 1979 Interpace sold the Franciscan Ceramics division in Los Angeles to Wedgwood, Shenango China Company to the Anchor Hocking corporation, and Mayer China to a group of investors. The Tiffin Glass division of Interpace was sold to Towle Silversmiths. All glassware sold through Franciscan was discontinued. Tiffin closed in 1980. Interpace corporation was dissolved in 1984. After the sale of Franciscan Ceramics to Wedgwood in 1979, the design group was reorganized. In 1984, Wedgwood closed the Franciscan Ceramics division, what was the former Gladding, McBean & Co.'s Glendale plant in Los Angeles. The production of the Franciscan patterns Desert Rose, Apple, and Fresh Fruit were moved to the Johnson Brothers division of Wedgwood in England. All other dinnerware and tile lines were discontinued. Archival examples of the Franciscan ware were packed up and given to the Wedgwood Museum. In 1986, Waterford Glass Group plc purchased Wedgwood and the group was renamed Waterford Wedgwood. In March 2009, KPS Capital Partners announced that it had acquired group assets in a range of countries, including the UK, US and Indonesia, would invest ‚Ç¨100m, and move a jobs to Asia to cut costs and return the firm to profitability. In the acquisition of the Wedgwood-Waterford holdings, the Franciscan brand was also acquired. The Franciscan brand is now a part of the WWRD - The Luxury Lifestyle Group. WWRD is an acronym for \\"Wedgwood Waterford Royal Doulton.\\" The Franciscan patterns Desert Rose and Apple continue to be manufactured under the Franciscan brand by WWRD in China. The Fiskars Corporation, a Finnish maker of home products, agreed to buy 100% of the holdings of WWRD. On 2 July 2015 the acquisition of WWRD by Fiskars Corporation was completed including brands Waterford, Wedgwood, Royal Doulton, Royal Albert and Roga≈°ka. The acquisition was approved by the US antitrust authorities.

He was a leading figure in the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), he had served as head of the North Antrim and Londonderry East Tyrone Brigade of the group. Early years McFarland joined the UDA in the 1970s and for a time was active in a series of bomb attacks on Catholic-owned businesses in the North Antrim and County Londonderry area, activities for which he was eventually imprisoned.Wood, Ian S. (2006). Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA, Edinburgh University Press, pp. 211‚Äì12. Around this time he was given the nickname \\"the Mexican\\" on account of his swarthy appearance and his thick moustache. Brigadier Following his release from prison, McFarland, who also maintained legitimate business interests in the construction industry, was appointed brigadier for the North Antrim and Londonderry area, a brigade that was only sporadically active compared to those in Belfast. McFarland's brigade published its own magazine, Warrior, that spoke out against gangsterism and drug dealing and which also invited readers to send in their own ideas for the future of Northern Ireland which the magazine would then publish, something of a departure for the usually dogmatic UDA. In 1996, following the end of the IRA ceasefire, McFarland announced through the pages of Warrior his conversion to the Ulster nationalism previously advocated by the late South Belfast brigadier John McMichael. He called for the United Kingdom to be radically altered into a \\"British family of nations\\" in which Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England would all become fully self- governing and only loosely linked. Acknowledging that his independent \\"Ulster\\" would face the problem of an \\"Irish minority\\" McFarland argued that those who did not accept the new arrangement would be expected to move to the Republic of Ireland. McFarland's brigade was responsible for the Castlerock killings of 25 March 1993 in which four Catholics were killed. The Greysteel massacre of 30 October 1993 also happened within McFarland's brigade area and he was widely suspected of having ordered the attack, although suspicion also fell on West Belfast brigadier Johnny Adair who, even at this stage, was seeking to extend his influence beyond his own area.Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack, UDA ‚Äì Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror, Penguin Ireland, 2004, p. 251 Although McFarland's brigade was fairly active during this period, Adair had little respect for his fellow brigadier, considering him to be a \\"redneck\\" due to his rural origins.David Lister & Hugh Jordan, Mad Dog ‚Äì The Rise and Fall of Johnny Adair and 'C' Company, Mainstream, 2004, p. 211 Adair was also critical of McFarland for the latter's alleged paranoia over the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) as that group was highly active in McFarland's area of command.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, pp. 274, 281 Nevertheless, court documents released in late 2013 named McFarland as the brains behind the attack. In early 1994, the UDA's Inner Council, which was in charge of directing operations, was made up of its six brigadiers ‚Äì McFarland, Adair, Alex Kerr of the South Belfast Brigade, Tom Reid for North Belfast, Gary Matthews for East Belfast, and Joe English for Southeast Antrim who served as chairman. English was an advocate of a Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC) ceasefire and sought to win support from his fellow brigadiers. Whilst Reid and Matthews were supportive of this initiative and Adair wholly opposed, McFarland represented, along with Kerr, a middle ground that, whilst largely sympathetic to English also felt that Adair's main argument, that a recent upturn in UDA activity was defeating the Provisional IRA, had some merit.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, pp. 209‚Äì12 Power struggle Along with fellow brigadiers and Inner Council members Jackie McDonald (who had regained his former position as South Belfast brigadier) and John Gregg, McFarland was unenthusiastic about the Belfast Agreement, with the three especially irked by the prospect of Sinn F√©in entering the proposed power- sharing executive.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 302 Surprisingly Johnny Adair, under the influence of John White, became for a time a supporter of the Northern Ireland peace process and in December 1999, after a meeting with Independent International Commission on Decommissioning chairman General John de Chastelain, announced that he felt the UDA should unilaterally decommission part of its arsenal. McFarland criticised the proposal and the Inner Council vote produced a three votes to three tie.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, pp. 279‚Äì80 At a second meeting the following day, called at Adair's behest, the West Belfast brigadier did not attend but rather sent John White to read out a statement in which Adair attacked the other five brigadiers, denouncing McFarland as \\"a dinosaur with no forward thinking\\". McFarland then refused to attend a press conference that Adair had called to announce decommissioning, telling White \\"I'm going back to Jurassic Park\\".Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 281 McFarland was one of those to caution against any UDA involvement in the feud between the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) and he feared that Adair's open support of the LVF would provoke an unwanted war between the UVF and the UDA.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 314 Nonetheless he was not keen to antagonise the widely feared Adair and so, along with Gregg, McDonald and North Belfast brigadier Jimbo Simpson, attended Adair's \\"Loyalist Day of Culture\\" on the Lower Shankill on 19 August 2000. Unbeknownst to McFarland and the others, Adair would use this day to launch his assault on the UVF with members of Adair's C Company attacking the UVF's Rex Bar stronghold before forcing UVF members and their families out of the Lower Shankill and initiating a loyalist feud between the UVF and the UDA West Belfast Brigade.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 327 McFarland had known that trouble was brewing as soon as the UDA march began that day, as a west Belfast band asked to march with his brigade but he refused after noticing an LVF flag amongst their banners.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 289 Despite the earlier troubles McFarland, after a request from White, accompanied the other four brigadiers to publicly meet and greet Adair on the Shankill after he had been released from Maghaberry on 15 May 2002. McFarland later stated that he didn't want to go but had only agreed after the other brigadiers accepted White's argument that it was important to show unity publicly after a series of press reports about splits in the UDA.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, pp. 302‚Äì03. In the subsequent fall-out, McFarland backed McDonald in his move against Adair.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 319 Subsequent activity During February 2003 various reports appeared in the press regarding McFarland's status as brigadier. It was firstly claimed that McFarland was to be replaced as brigadier by Torrens Knight before being subsequently claimed that McFarland faced replacement by an anonymous figure as the UDA wished to end the practice of making its leaders public. Ultimately neither story proved true, not least because Knight had left the UDA, and McFarland remained as brigadier.Sectarian Attacks February 2003 from the Pat Finucane Centre In 2006, McFarland was one of three leading UDA men, the others being Jackie McDonald and Ihab Shoukri, to meet with Martin McAleese in Belfast to discuss decommissioning.President's husband in peace talks with UDA, independent.ie; accessed 24 April 2018. In 2009 McFarland was at the centre of reports about a split in the UDA over the issue of decommissioning. The Belfast brigadiers met with General de Chastelaine in a separate meeting to one conducted with McFarland. This came after the Ulster Political Research Group in McFarland's area announced unilaterally that it was abandoning its previous support for the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Assembly.UDA split widens as general visits McFarland subsequently told the other brigadiers at an Inner Council meeting that he could not deliver decommissioning as the strength of feeling within his brigade was too set against the move.\\"UDA's 'top man' cannot give weapons vow\\", belfasttelegraph.co.uk; accessed 24 April 2018. During Queen Elizabeth II's visit to the Republic of Ireland in 2011 McFarland was part of a delegation of UDA brigadiers who laid a wreath at the National War Memorial in Dublin.UDA chiefs join Queen at Irish War Memorial, belfasttelegraph.co.uk; accessed 24 April 2018. Removal as Brigadier In May 2013 McFarland was stood down from his position within the UDA and is no longer a brigadier. It was claimed that McFarland was summoned to the Waterside area of Derry and informed of numerous complaints made against him and his leadership. The complaints included mismanagement of UDA funds, dealings with Irish republicans and accepting protection money from expelled members from the UDA. The Coleraine commander of the brigade was alleged to have been instrumental in having McFarland removed from power.\\"Pumped up UDA chief ordered teen to be shot\\" , The Sunday World, 27 November 2013. The brigade area had garnered a reputation for growing criminality; the Ballymoney UDA were heavily involved in the selling of illegal cigarettes and tobacco,\\"Customs seize 113,000 cigarettes\\", Belfast Telegraph, 25 April 2013. whilst the Derry UDA were reported in the Sunday World as being involved with local drug dealers by accepting bribes in order to turn a blind eye to the dealers' activities.\\"UDA Drug Dealing in Derry\\", Sunday World, 29 December 2013 In contrast to a number of similar dismissals within the UDA, McFarland accepted the decision and was allowed to continue to live in the area and to remain as an ordinary member of the UDA. However subsequent to his removal, the Brigade split into several factions, with no new brigadier nominated.Derry Journal, 23 May 2013. In 2015 it was reported that there was a call for McFarland to return as Brigadier. Disillusioned members in the North Antrim and Londonderry brigade were claimed to have become dismayed with a growing criminal element within the organisation and believed the return of McFarland would stabilise the group. Alleged activity which prompted this included extortion of drug dealers, members previously expelled for criminality returning to the UDA and the killing of a man in Ballymoney which was only intended to be a punishment beating.\\"Tensions within notorious north Antrim UDA brigade\\", Belfast Telegraph 17 February 2015. However powerlifter Kyle Vauls, formerly the commander of the UDA in Coleraine, has subsequently emerged as brigadier; both remain in charge as of 2017.

In a classical or quantum local field theory, the generator of Lorentz transformations can be written as an integral : M_{\\\\mu u} = \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^3x \\\\, {M^0}_{\\\\mu u} of a local current : {M^\\\\mu}_{ u\\\\lambda}= (x_ u {T^\\\\mu}_\\\\lambda - x_\\\\lambda {T^\\\\mu}_ u)+ {S^\\\\mu}_{ u\\\\lambda}. Here {T^\\\\mu}_\\\\lambda is the canonical Noether energy‚Äìmomentum tensor, and {S^{\\\\mu}}_{ u\\\\lambda} is the contribution of the intrinsic (spin) angular momentum. Local conservation of angular momentum : \\\\partial_\\\\mu {M^\\\\mu}_{ u\\\\lambda}=0 \\\\, requires that : \\\\partial_\\\\mu {S^\\\\mu}_{ u\\\\lambda}=T_{\\\\lambda u}-T_{ u\\\\lambda}. Thus a source of spin- current implies a non-symmetric canonical energy‚Äìmomentum tensor. The Belinfante‚ÄìRosenfeld tensor is a modification of the energy momentum tensor : T_B^{\\\\mu u} = T^{\\\\mu u} +\\\\frac 12 \\\\partial_\\\\lambda(S^{\\\\mu u\\\\lambda}+S^{ u\\\\mu\\\\lambda}-S^{\\\\lambda u\\\\mu}) that is constructed from the canonical energy momentum tensor and the spin current {S^{\\\\mu}}_{ u\\\\lambda} so as to be symmetric yet still conserved. An integration by parts shows that : M^{ u\\\\lambda} = \\\\int (x^ u T^{0\\\\lambda}_B - x^\\\\lambda T^{0 u}_B) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}^3x, and so a physical interpretation of Belinfante tensor is that it includes the \\"bound momentum\\" associated with gradients of the intrinsic angular momentum. In other words, the added term is an analogue of the {\\\\mathbf J}_\\\\text{bound}= abla\\\\times \\\\mathbf {M} \\"bound current\\" associated with a magnetization density {\\\\mathbf M}. The curious combination of spin-current components required to make T_B^{\\\\mu u} symmetric and yet still conserved seems totally ad hoc, but it was shown by both Rosenfeld and Belinfante that the modified tensor is precisely the symmetric Hilbert energy‚Äìmomentum tensor that acts as the source of gravity in general relativity. Just as it is the sum of the bound and free currents that acts as a source of the magnetic field, it is the sum of the bound and free energy‚Äìmomentum that acts as a source of gravity. Belinfante-Rosenfeld and the Hilbert energy-momentum tensor The Hilbert energy-momentum tensor T_{\\\\mu u} is defined by the variation of the action functional S_{\\\\rm eff} with respect to the metric as \\\\delta S_{\\\\rm eff}=\\\\frac 12 \\\\int d^nx \\\\sqrt{g} \\\\,T_{\\\\mu u}\\\\,\\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u}, or equivalently as \\\\delta S_{\\\\rm eff}=-\\\\frac 12 \\\\int d^nx \\\\sqrt{g} \\\\,T^{\\\\mu u}\\\\,\\\\delta g_{\\\\mu u}. (The minus sign in the second equation arises because \\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u}= - g^{\\\\mu\\\\sigma} \\\\delta g_{\\\\sigma\\\\tau} g^{\\\\tau u}.) We may also define an energy-momentum tensor T_{cb} by varying a Minkowski-orthonormal vierbein {\\\\bf e}_a to get \\\\delta S_{\\\\rm eff}= \\\\int d^nx\\\\sqrt{g}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\delta S}{\\\\delta e^\\\\mu_a}\\\\right) \\\\delta e^\\\\mu_a \\\\equiv \\\\int d^nx\\\\sqrt{g} \\\\left(T_{cb} \\\\eta^{ca} e^{*b}_\\\\mu\\\\right) \\\\delta e^\\\\mu_a. Here \\\\eta_{ab} = {\\\\bf e}_a \\\\cdot {\\\\bf e}_b is the Minkowski metric for the orthonormal vierbein frame, and {\\\\bf e}^{*b} are the covectors dual to the vierbeins. With the vierbein variation there is no immediately obvious reason for T_{cb} to be symmetric. However, the action functional S_{\\\\rm eff}({\\\\bf e}_a) should be invariant under an infinitesimal local Lorentz transformation \\\\delta e^\\\\mu_a= e^\\\\mu_b {\\\\theta^{b}}_a(x), \\\\theta^{ab}=-\\\\theta^{ba}, and so \\\\delta S_{\\\\rm eff} = \\\\int d^nx\\\\sqrt{g} \\\\,T_{cb}\\\\,\\\\eta^{ca} e^{*b}_\\\\mu e^\\\\mu_d {\\\\theta^d}_a = \\\\int d^nx\\\\sqrt{g} \\\\,T_{cb}\\\\,\\\\eta^{ca} {\\\\theta^b}_a = \\\\int d^nx\\\\sqrt{g}\\\\, T_{cb}\\\\, \\\\theta^{bc}(x), should be zero. As \\\\theta^{bc}(x) is an arbitrary position- dependent skew symmetric matrix, we see that local Lorentz and rotation invariance both requires and implies that T_{bc}=T_{cb}. Once we know that T_{ab} is symmetric, it is easy to show that T_{ab}= e_a^\\\\mu e_b^ u T_{\\\\mu u}, and so the vierbein-variation energy-momentum tensor is equivalent to the metric-variation Hilbert tensor. We can now understand the origin of the Belinfante-Rosefeld modification of the Noether canonical energy momentum tensor. Take the action to be S_{\\\\rm eff}({\\\\bf e}_a, {\\\\omega}^{ab}_\\\\mu ) where {\\\\omega}^{ab}_\\\\mu is the spin connection that is determined by {\\\\bf e}_a via the condition of being metric compatible and torsion free. The spin current {S^\\\\mu}_{ab} is then defined by the variation {S^\\\\mu}_{ab}= \\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt g} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\delta S_{\\\\rm eff}}{\\\\delta \\\\omega^{ab}_\\\\mu}\\\\right)_{{\\\\bf e}_a}, and the \\"canonical\\" Noether energy momentum tensor T^{(0)}_{cb} is the part that arises from the variation where we keep the spin connection fixed: T_{cb} ^{(0)} \\\\eta^{ca} e^{*b}_\\\\mu= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{g}}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\delta S_{\\\\rm eff}}{\\\\delta e^\\\\mu_a}\\\\right)_{\\\\omega^{ab}_\\\\mu}. Then \\\\delta S_{\\\\rm eff} = \\\\int d^nx \\\\sqrt{g} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ T_{cb} ^{(0)} \\\\eta^{ca} e^{*b}_\\\\mu \\\\delta e^\\\\mu_a+ \\\\frac 12 {S^{\\\\mu}}_{ab} \\\\delta {\\\\omega^{ab}}_\\\\mu\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Now, for a torsion-free and metric-compatible connection, we have that (\\\\delta \\\\omega_{ij\\\\mu}) e^\\\\mu_k =-\\\\frac 12\\\\left\\\\\\\\{( abla_j \\\\delta e_{ik} - abla_k \\\\delta e_{ij}) +( abla_k \\\\delta e_{ji}- abla_i \\\\delta e_{jk}) -( abla_i \\\\delta e_{kj}- abla_j \\\\delta e_{ki})\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, where we are using the notation \\\\delta e_{ij} = {\\\\bf e}_i\\\\cdot \\\\delta {\\\\bf e}_j= \\\\eta_{ib}[e^{*b}_\\\\alpha \\\\delta e_j^\\\\alpha]. Using the spin-connection variation, and after an integration by parts, we find \\\\delta S_{\\\\rm eff} = \\\\int d^nx \\\\sqrt{g} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ T_{cb} ^{(0)} +\\\\frac 12 abla_a({S_{bc}}^a+{S_{cb}}^a-{S^a}_{bc})\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\eta^{cd}e^{*b}_\\\\mu \\\\,\\\\delta e_d^\\\\mu. Thus we see that corrections to the canonical Noether tensor that appear in the Belinfante-Rosenfeld tensor occur because we need to simultaneously vary the vierbein and the spin connection if we are to preserve local Lorentz invariance. As an example, consider the classical Lagrangian for the Dirac field \\\\int d^dx\\\\sqrt{g}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac i 2 \\\\left( \\\\bar \\\\Psi \\\\gamma^a e^\\\\mu_a abla_\\\\mu \\\\Psi - ( abla_\\\\mu \\\\bar\\\\Psi)e^\\\\mu_a \\\\gamma_a \\\\Psi\\\\right)+m\\\\bar\\\\Psi\\\\Psi \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Here the spinor covariant derivatives are abla_\\\\mu \\\\Psi =\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^\\\\mu}+\\\\frac 18 [\\\\gamma_b,\\\\gamma_c] {\\\\omega^{bc}}_\\\\mu\\\\right) \\\\Psi, abla_\\\\mu\\\\bar \\\\Psi =\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^\\\\mu}-\\\\frac 18 [\\\\gamma_b,\\\\gamma_c] {\\\\omega^{bc}}_\\\\mu\\\\right) \\\\bar\\\\Psi. We therefore get T^{(0)}_{bc}= \\\\frac i2\\\\left(\\\\bar \\\\Psi \\\\gamma_c( abla_b\\\\Psi) -( abla_b \\\\bar \\\\Psi)\\\\gamma_c \\\\Psi\\\\right), {S^a}_{bc}= \\\\frac i8 \\\\bar\\\\Psi\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma^a,[\\\\gamma_b,\\\\gamma_c]\\\\\\\\}\\\\Psi. There is no contribution from \\\\sqrt{g} if we use the equations of motion, i.e. we are on shell. Now \\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma_a,[\\\\gamma_b,\\\\gamma_c]\\\\\\\\}=4 \\\\gamma_a\\\\gamma_b\\\\gamma_c, if a,b c are distinct and zero otherwise. As a consequence S_{abc} is totally antisymmetric. Now, using this result, and again the equations of motion, we find that abla_a {S^a}_{bc}= T^{(0)}_{cb}-T^{(0)}_{bc}, Thus the Belinfante-Rosenfeld tensor becomes T_{bc} = T^{(0)}_{bc}+ \\\\frac 12(T^{(0)}_{cb}-T^{(0)}_{bc}) = \\\\frac 12 (T^{(0)}_{bc}+T^{(0)}_{cb}). The Belinfante-Rosenfeld tensor for the Dirac field is therefore seen to be the symmetrized canonical energy-momentum tensor. Weinberg's definition Weinberg defines the Belinfante tensor as :T_B^{\\\\mu u}=T^{\\\\mu u}-\\\\frac{i}{2}\\\\partial_\\\\kappa \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial(\\\\partial_\\\\kappa\\\\Psi^\\\\ell)}(\\\\mathcal{J}^{\\\\mu u})^\\\\ell_{\\\\,\\\\, m}\\\\Psi^m-\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial(\\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\Psi^\\\\ell)}(\\\\mathcal{J}^{\\\\kappa u})^\\\\ell_{\\\\,\\\\, m}\\\\Psi^m-\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial(\\\\partial_ u\\\\Psi^\\\\ell)}(\\\\mathcal{J}^{\\\\kappa\\\\mu})^\\\\ell_{\\\\,\\\\, m}\\\\Psi^m\\\\right] where \\\\mathcal{L} is the Lagrangian density, the set {Œ®} are the fields appearing in the Lagrangian, the non-Belinfante energy momentum tensor is defined by :T^{\\\\mu u}=\\\\eta^{\\\\mu u}\\\\mathcal{L}-\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial(\\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\Psi^\\\\ell)}\\\\partial^ u\\\\Psi^\\\\ell and \\\\mathcal{J^{\\\\mu u}} are a set of matrices satisfying the algebra of the homogeneous Lorentz group :[\\\\mathcal{J}^{\\\\mu u},\\\\mathcal{J}^{\\\\rho\\\\sigma}]=i\\\\mathcal{J}^{\\\\rho u}\\\\eta^{\\\\mu\\\\sigma}-i\\\\mathcal{J}^{\\\\sigma u}\\\\eta^{\\\\mu\\\\rho}-i\\\\mathcal{J}^{\\\\mu\\\\sigma}\\\\eta^{ u\\\\rho}+i\\\\mathcal{J}^{\\\\mu\\\\rho}\\\\eta^{ u\\\\sigma}.

MacDonald (Fionnlagh Domhnallach). Its first issue was published in Autumn 1952. MacDonald served as an editor until 1964; Thomson remained present for decades until it ceased publication in 2004, producing just over 200 issues in total. According to Alan Campbell, the magazine was a \\"one-man show;\\" he explained that Thomson \\"sustained something very valuable for a long period of time.\\" Although it had a relatively low circulation, it was influential on Gaelic literature as it was the longest-running Gaelic literary magazine of the 20th century, in circulation for more than twice as long as its predecessor, Guth na Bliadhna. Gairm attempted to encompass a variety of perspectives and themes, and \\"disseminated a lot of work that we weren't aware of\\" in the words of Martin MacDonald. As well as being familiar to most literate Gaels, the magazine attracted almost all influential Gaelic writers who were active, including Sorley MacLean, Iain Crichton Smith, George Campbell Hay, and D√≤mhnall MacAmhlaigh. Some of the most influential Gaelic poems of the twentieth century were published in the magazine, most notably \\"Hallaig\\" by Sorley MacLean in 1954. Gairm also published short stories by Eilidh Watt and Iain Crichton Smith. There were also translations (for example the poetry of Anna Achmatova translated by Cr√¨sdean Whyte, Issue 125, Winter 1983‚Äì1984) and other Gaelic literary works (by D√≤mhnall Eachann Meek or D√≤mhnall MacAmhlaigh) were an important part of Gairm. When Gairm ceased to publish, a new magazine, Gath (2003‚Äì8), took its place, followed by Steall, whose first issue was published in 2016. An index of articles in Gairm can be found on the Am Baile website using their newspaper index search.

It is located in the village of Sakshaug, just west of the municipal centre of Straumen. It is the former main church for the Inder√∏y parish which is part of the Stiklestad prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nidaros. History The stone church was built in a long church style during the 12th century on the basis of designs by an unknown architect. The medieval church is one of the oldest churches in Tr√∏ndelag, dating back to about 1150-1160. The choir was modernized with Gothic details in the early 1200s. At the end of the 18th century, an inscription was found that told church inauguration in 1184. The church was consecrated in 1184 by Eysteinn Erlendsson, Archbishop of the Diocese of Nidaros. The walls are built of limestone and the church is reinforced with supporting walls on the south side. It is Romanesque in design and has rounded portals to the south, west and north. The arch of the north gate is decorated with chevrones. The choir area is early Gothic in design. The church once had a west tower, but it had to be demolished in the Middle Ages. The pulpit is of wood and from 1646 and was carved by Tr√∏ndelag-based artist and craftsman Johan Johansen, bilthugger and painted by Johan Hanss√∏nn, kontrafeier. The baroque altarpiece dates back to 1692. The church was decommissioned in 1871 when the new Sakshaug Church (Sakshaug kirke) was consecrated. The roof, tower, decor and other woodwork were removed. The walls were left behind. The ownership of the church was transferred to the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments in 1873 and was renovated from 1910 to 1958 after having been without a roof and the interior since 1873. It has been suggested that the carving of a woman is one of three alleged examples of sheela na gig in Norway, the others being at Trondheim and Stiklestad; but the Sakshaug carving is \\"somewhat suspect as it appears to be more of a pine cone than sheela na gig.\\"http://www.sheelanagig.org/wordpress/trondheim/ Media gallery Sakshaug old church supporting walls.jpg Sakshaug gamle kirke 2013.jpg Sakshaug old church altarpiece and choir.jpg Sakshaug old church altarpiece detail 1.jpg Sakshaug old church anno 1774.jpg Sakshaug old church choir door and window.jpg Sakshaug old church interior eastwards.jpg Sakshaug old church layout choir.jpg Sakshaug old church organ and north wall window.jpg Sakshaug old church interior westwards 2.jpg Sakshaug_demonmaske.jpg See also *List of churches in Nidaros References Other sources *Kristoffersen, Kjersti Holien (2007) En bygningsarkeologisk unders√∏kelse av koret i Sakshaug kirke (University of Troms√∏) Category:Inder√∏y Category:Churches in Tr√∏ndelag Category:Stone churches in Norway Category:12th-century Church of Norway church buildings Category:12th-century establishments in Norway Sakshaug Church ","title":"Old Sakshaug Church"},{"id":"32107062","text":"your bitcoinJosef Haib√∂ck (28 February 1917 ‚Äì 3 July 2002) was a general in the Austrian Air Force.
