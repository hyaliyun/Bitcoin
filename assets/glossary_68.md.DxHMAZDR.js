Forster, written in 1957‚Äì1958 and published posthumously in The Life to Come (and Other Stories) in 1972.  Summary  The story begins with a group of children playing on the deck of a boat, which is travelling from India to England. Lionel, who is one of the children playing, is attempting to get one of his friends, Cocoanut (named for his oddly shaped head), to play battle with him. Lionel is one of the five children belonging to Mrs. March, and is aboard the ship because his father had deserted his mother for a native he had met while fighting in a war abroad. Mrs. March makes several comments about how she disapproves of Lionel's friend, Cocoanut. She refers to him as having a touch of the \\"tar brush\\", or not being entirely of European ancestry. However, she allows them to go ahead and play together for most of the voyage. When she observes that the children are playing in direct sunlight, she sees to it that they play under the awning before they become afflicted with sunstroke. Baby, the youngest of the March children, begins crying as Mrs. March is yelling at the children, so she picks him up to carry him inside. Before she can get inside, however, a young sailor hops out of his cabin and draws a white line around her‚Äîwhich puts her in a state of mind where she cannot escape the circle that surrounds her. Then, Cocoanut appears, screaming that she has been caught. She becomes infuriated with Cocoanut, telling him he is \\"a silly idle useless unmanly little boy.‚Äù Years later, Lionel has become a Captain in the British army, and is known for being a war hero, after he was injured in battle. He has grown into a handsome young man, with blonde hair, blue eyes, and broad shoulders. Lionel is aboard a ship to India, where he is to meet up with Isabel, a girl who we assume he is to marry. After boarding the ship, he is made aware that his old friend Cocoanut is also aboard, and had made arrangements for them to share a room together. Lionel seems rather shocked, and quite uncertain about sharing a room with a ‚Äúhalf-caste‚Äù. But because the ship is already full, and because he acknowledges that his prejudices are tribal, and not personal, he seemingly agrees to room with Cocoanut. At first, things seem normal. They unpacked as they talked about old times, joking with each other. And then suddenly things became awkward. As Lionel was sitting on his top bunk, Cocoanut grabbed his leg, and began feeling up until he had reached his groin. Lionel's mind begins to race. He is confused and disgusted as he leaps from his bunk, running out the door. At first he goes to see the Master at Arms, but comes to find out that he is nowhere to be found. He then heads to the Purser's office, demanding that he have his room switched, without giving any reason whatsoever. When the Purser explains that all of the rooms are already full, Lionel furiously marches out of the office. He goes to the front of the ship and watches as he moves farther away from England as he tries to decide what to do. While at the front of the ship he runs into Captain Arbuthnot and his wife, and they form a group known as the Big Eight. After a few drinks and jokes, Lionel begins to loosen up a bit, and complains about having to room with a ‚Äúwog‚Äù. Feeling a little bit better, Lionel decides to go ahead and deal with Cocoanut being his roommate for the voyage, and tries to forget about the strange incident that had happened earlier. Everything seemed to be going well. \\"Order had been reestablished\\", as Lionel put it. But Lionel can't help but think back on the night when Cocoanut had made his move, and even wonders what would have happened if he had granted Cocoanuts desires. The ship enters the Mediterranean Sea, and one night, after Lionel returns to his cabin, he is awaited by Cocoanut and a bottle of champagne. After a few drinks, Lionel gave in Cocoanut's seduction, and as they lay in bed together, they talked about their lives. At one point, Cocoanut questions the large scar that Lionel has on his groin area. It turns out that the scar was Lionel's \\"battle wound\\", which is what ended up making him a war hero. After the story of the battle wound, Lionel continues talking, getting further into deeply personal stories from his younger days. Cocoanut, who we know very little about, doesn't go into much detail about his past. We are able to gather that he is in charge some type of business, although his specific occupation is never revealed. We also know that he has several passports from different countries, which causes us to become sceptical of who Cocoanut really is. While the two men lay entwined in their cabin, we realise that they have become close with one another‚ÄîNot only on a physical level, but on an emotional level as well. At one point, Lionel says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fonder of you than I know how to say\\". Cocoanut's response is that Lionel should have someone to take care of him. The two men ponder being together, but Lionel comes to the realisation that it would be impossible. Suddenly, Lionel notices the bolt on the door. It had been unlocked the entirety of their lovemaking. Realizing that anyone could have walked into the cabin at any moment, Lionel becomes increasingly distressed. At first he blames himself for being too careless, but then Cocoanut claims that it was partly his fault also, because he knew that the door was unlocked the entire time. Furious with Cocoanut for not mentioning this before, Lionel decides he needs to go out on the deck for a smoke. Realizing the seriousness of what just transpired, Cocoanut says to Lionel as he is walking out the door, \\"When you come back you will not be you. And I may not be I.‚Äù As he is out on the deck for a smoke, he sees Colonel Arbuthnot sleeping, next to his wife. He thinks about everything which he would lose if anyone were to find out about the scandal with Cocoanut. He was the first born, and felt responsible for maintaining integrity of the family name. Thinking of Isabel, who is waiting on him in India, he decides what happened would not follow him any further. Hearing Lionel, Colonel Arbuthnot wakes up, and apologises to Lionel for having to bunk with a wog. Apparently, it had just been discovered that Cocoanut was not supposed to be on the boat at all. He had sent some \\"fat bribes\\" out to get himself aboard the ship. After his discussion with the Colonel, Lionel leaves the deck. Returning to the cabin, Lionel sees Cocoanut in his top bunk. Getting close to Lionel, Cocoanut insists that he kiss him. When Lionel rejects him, Cocoanut decides to go in for the kiss regardless and bites Lionel's forearm. Lionel flashes back to the war and strangles Cocoanut, then kisses his eyelids tenderly, then commits suicide by throwing himself into the ocean. His body is never found.

Founded in the early 1980s as the Islamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan (Ittehad-e Islami bara-ye Azadi-ye Afghanistan, ÿßÿ™ÿ≠ÿßÿØ ÿßÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ€å ÿ®ÿ±ÿß€å ÿ¢ÿ≤ÿßÿØ€å ÿßŸÅÿ∫ÿßŸÜÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ), it was originally an attempt to bring unity amongst Islamist opposition forces in Afghanistan. However, the creation of the new umbrella organization effectively created a split and the organization became a political party of its own. The organization was part of the 'Peshawar Seven', the coalition of mujahedin forces supported by the United States, Pakistan and various Arab states of the Persian Gulf in the war against the PDPA government and Soviet forces. Through the financial aid received from Saudi sources, the organization was able to attract a considerable military following. Arab volunteers fought in the militia forces of the organisation.  Afghan Civil War (1992‚Äì96)  After the ouster of the PDPA government in April 1992, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar initiated a bombardment campaign against the Islamic State of Afghanistan which had been established by the peace and power-sharing agreement Peshawar Accords. In addition, Saudi Arabia and Iran ‚Äì as competitors for regional hegemony ‚Äì supported Afghan militias hostile towards each other. According to Human Rights Watch, \\"Iran assisted the Shia Hazara Hezb-i Wahdat forces of Abdul Ali Mazari, as Iran attempted to maximize Wahdat's military power and influence.\\"Gutman, Roy (2008): How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban and the Hijacking of Afghanistan, Endowment of the United States Institute of Peace, 1st ed., Washington DC. Saudi Arabia supported the Wahhabite Abdul Rasul Sayyaf and his Ittihad-i Islami faction. Conflict between the two militias soon escalated into a full- scale war. Both Ittihad and Wahdat engaged in large-scale kidnapping campaigns against civilians and combatants of the \\"other side\\". The Islamic State and International Committee of the Red Cross regularly tried to mediate between the two sides, but cease-fires commonly were broken in a matter of days. In early 1993, the Hezb-i Wahdat joined an alliance with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar starting to shell northern Kabul. On February 11, 1993, Ittihad forces took part in the Islamic State's military Afshar operation which had the objective of ending the bombardment on residential areas in northern Kabul conducted by Hezb-i Wadat. After the military operation had ended and successfully forced Wahdat forces from the area, Ittihad forces started to escalate the situation by turning against the civilian population. During and after the operation 70 combatants and civilians were killed. After the operation Ittihad troops under the command of Abdul Rasul Sayyaf kidnapped up to 900 people, 200 of whom were released after ransoms were paid to Ittihad commanders, 700 were never returned by Ittihad forces. In 2001, Ittihad's leader Abdul Rasul Sayyaf was suspected of being complicit in the assassination of anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Shah Massoud. In 2005, the Ittihad organization was registered as a political party with the Ministry of Justice under its new name. Sayyaf and Ittihad are currently allied to the Karzai government. The party is strongest in the Paghman area and receives most of its support from Pashtuns. Ideologically, the party follows and advocates an Orthodox form of Islam.

The organisation was founded in England in 1927 by Sir Sydney Nicholson; today it operates internationally, with 8,500 members in over 40 countries worldwide, and is the largest church music organisation in Britain. The RSCM was originally named the School of English Church Music and was only open to members of the Anglican Communion; today it is an interdenominational organisation, although it is still overseen by the Church of England. * The Director is Hugh Morris (who began in 2018) *President of the Royal School of Church Music in America is Bert Landman. *President of RSCM Australia is Ross Cobb. *President of RSCM South Africa is Malcolm Chalmers *President of RSCM New Zealand is Paul Ellis. *The patron is the Queen. Choirs affiliated with the Royal School of Church Music often wear the RSCM medallion, which features a picture of Saint Nicolas, its patron saint. Awards and medals The RSCM provides a series of grades and awards to signify varying levels of musical achievement. There are four basic merit awards ‚Äì the light blue ribbon, the dark blue ribbon, the red ribbon and the yellow ribbon. These awards share the same medal. Beyond these are several medals awarded after successful coursework and examination: * The Bronze award * The Silver award * The Gold award The prerequisites of the Silver award are to hold either the Bronze award (or its predecessor the Dean's/Provost's award), to have attended an RSCM event as a member of the choir and it is suggested that the candidate have a Grade 3 Theory (ABRSM) level of understanding. The prerequisites of the Gold award are once again, to hold the level below, to have completed an RSCM course (preferably residential) and it is suggested that a Grade 5 Theory (ABRSM) level of understanding. The ABRSM Grade 8 Singing is of an approximate level but the Gold award has a larger syllabus and does not require the candidate to commit pieces to memory. Unlike the grade 8, a candidate must also create an order of service for any event he or she wishes, with an appropriate music list. The new awards are now available to choristers of any age and have been brought in to standardize the awarding process. There are many area based rules for the old medals, which will all disappear as the old award candidates decide not to wear their medals due to age. Examples include * in some areas a chorister may wear all medals at the same time while in others there is a limit of one. * a red ribbon (S.

Apophysis has many features for creating and editing fractal flames, including an editor which allows one to directly edit the transforms by manipulating triangles, a mutations window, which applies random edits to the triangles, an adjust window, which allows the adjustment of coloring and location of the image. It also provides a scripting language with direct access to most of the components of the fractal, which allows for effects such as the animations seen in Electric Sheep, which are also fractal flames. Users can export fractalflames to other fractal flame rendering programs, such as FLAM3. There is a separate version of Apophysis that has support for 3D. There are numerous clones, ports, and forks of it. History Scott Draves invented Fractal Flames and published an open source implementation written in C in the early 90s. In 2001, Ronald Hordijk translated his code into Delphi and created a non-animated screensaver. And in 2003 or 2004 Mark Townsend took Ronald's code and added a graphical user interface to create Apophysis. It has since been improved and updated by Peter Sdobnov, Piotr Borys, and Ronald Hordijk. Since 2009, there is a version of Apophysis called Apophysis 7X. Originally, it was targeting to provide support for modern Microsoft Windows operating systems like Windows Vista and 7. A strong feedback from the Apophysis users encouraged the developer Georg Kiehne to provide updates which made 7X the most popular and advanced version of Apophysis so far. Scripts Apophysis uses the Scripter Studio scripting library to allow users to write scripts which run and either create a new flame, edit the existing flames, or do bigger tasks. One such instance is rendering an entire batch of fractals. Plugins Apophysis supports a plugin API so that new variations can be independently developed and distributed.

It is native to tropical Asia and Wallacea. Due to its importance as a source of timber for the traditional shipbuilding of large outrigger ships, it has been spread in prehistoric times by the migrations of the Austronesian peoples to the islands of Oceania and Madagascar, along with other members of the genus Calophyllum. It has since been naturalized in regions in the East African coast. It is also a source of the culturally important tamanu oil. Names Calophyllum inophyllum is also known as Alexandrian laurel balltree, beach touriga, Borneo-mahogany, Indian doomba oiltree, Indian-laurel, laurelwood, red poon, satin touriga, and tacamahac-tree. In Island Southeast Asia and Oceania, they are also commonly known as bintangur, bitaog, tamanu, or kamani. Description Leaves Calophyllum inophyllum is a low-branching and slow-growing tree with a broad and irregular crown. It usually reaches in height. The flower is wide and occurs in racemose or paniculate inflorescences consisting of four to 15 flowers. Flowering can occur perennially, but usually two distinct flowering periods are observed, in late spring and in late autumn. The fruit (the ballnut) is a round, green drupe measuring in diameter and having a single large seed. When ripe, the fruit is wrinkled and its color varies from yellow to brownish-red.

Heritage tree, Penaga Laut (Calophyllum inophyllum) at Singapore Botanic Gardens thumb Now, it is widely cultivated in all tropical regions of the world. Because of its decorative leaves, fragrant flowers, and spreading crown, it is best known as an ornamental plant. This tree often grows in coastal regions, as well as nearby lowland forests. However, it has also been cultivated successfully in inland areas at moderate altitudes. It tolerates varied kinds of soil, coastal sand, clay, or even degraded soil. Uses=Shipbuilding Mastwood is notable for its ability to grow to massive sizes in sandy or rocky beaches of island and coastal habitats, as well as its habit of sending out arching large trunks over the water where its seeds are dispersed via the currents. Due to these characters, mastwood are of particular importance to traditional shipbuilding of the larger Austronesian outrigger ships and were carried with them as they migrated to Oceania and Madagascar. Other species of the genus Calophyllum were also used similarly, like Calophyllum soulattri, Calophyllum peekelii, and Calophyllum goniocarpum. They were comparable in importance to how oaks were in European shipbuilding and timber industries. Various parts of the mastwood were integral to the manufacture of outrigger canoes among various Austronesian peoples. The large curving limbs were commonly carved into the dugout canoe that formed the keel of the Austronesian outriggers ships. The strakes, which are attached to the keel by the uniquely Austronesian technique of \\"sewing\\" them with a combination of dowels and lashed lugs instead of nails, can also be made from mastwood, but it is more commonly made from other \\"softer\\" timber species like Artocarpus. Other pieces became masts, outrigger floats, and outrigger spars. Smaller curving limbs can also be carved into the ribs of the boat. In many parts of Polynesia, mastwood groves planted in marae were considered sacred and abodes of spirits. Mastwood were also carved into religious objects like tiki. They are also commonly mentioned in the chants and folklore of Polynesia. In Australia, the 1889 book The Useful Native Plants of Australia records \\"During a debate on the Pearl Fisheries Bill in the Queensland Assembly, a clause was specially inserted to protect trees of this species at Thursday Island. A fine of ¬£10 is inflicted on any person who cuts down or injures this or a cocoa-nut tree, or any other tree bearing edible fruit. This clause is, of course, in the interest of the aboriginals.\\". Other uses Aside from shipbuilding, tamanu oil extracted from the fruit kernels were important in Polynesian culture. The oils, as well as poultices made from leaves and flowers, are also commonly used for traditional medicine. The leaves contain compounds that are poisonous to fish and can be used as fish poison. The sap of the tree is poisonous and is used to make poison arrows in Samoa. The mature fruit is poisonous enough to use as rat bait. The seeds yield a thick, dark green tamanu oil for medicinal use or hair grease. The nuts are dried before cracking, after which the oil-laden kernel is removed and further dried. The first neoflavone isolated from natural sources (1951) was calophyllolide from C. inophyllum seeds.Neoflavones. 1. Natural Distribution and Spectral and Biological Properties. M. M. Garazd, Ya. L.

The fatty acid methyl esters derived from C. inophyllum seed oil meets the major biodiesel requirements in the United States (ASTM D 6751), and European Union (EN 14214). The average oil yield is 11.7 kg- oil/tree or 4680 kg-oil/hectare. In the northwest coastal areas of Luzon island in Philippines, the oil was used for night lamps. This widespread use started to decline when kerosene became available, and later on electricity. It was also used as fuel to generate electricity to provide power for radios during World War II.

La Motte-Picquet himself had his cheek cut away by a cannonball.Hennequin, p. 362 On 24 February 1784, La Motte-Picquet departed Brest as first officer on the 24-gun frigate Cumberland, under Captain M√©z√©dern, bound for Ile de France and Ile Bourbon. After calling A Coru√±a, Cumberland encountered a British 36-gun frigate, leading to an inconclusive battle where she lost 25 killed or wounded. After a 122-day travel, Cumberland reached Bourbon, and then Ile de France. From there, she departed for a cruise off India on 20 October 1748.Levot, p. 128. Peace being restored in October 1748 with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, La Motte-Picquet cruised in the Caribbean, in the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. In 1754, he rose to the rank of Lieutenant de Vaisseau.  Seven Years' War  In 1755, La Motte-Picquet earned his first command. In October 1756, he was made a Knight in the Order of Saint-Louis. In 1757, La Motte-Picquet was part of the staff of the 74-gun Diad√®me, under Captain Rosily-M√©ros, part of the squadron under Dubois de La Motte tasked to challenge the British off Qu√©bec. In 1758, he fought off Fort de Portzic in Brest Roads, and had to report his actions before the Secretary of State for the Navy Arnouville.Lettre du 9 ao√ªt 1758, au Ministre de la marine : \\"Il serait bien facheux pour moy, apr√®s 24 ans de services, dans lesquels je n'ay jamais donn√© la moindre prise sur ma conduite, qu'une occasion‚Ä¶ qui, j'ose le dire, me fait honneur‚Ä¶ vous laiss√¢t quelques mauvaises impressions sur mon compte ‚Ä¶\\". In 1760, he was on convoy escort duty between Brest and Rochefort. In 1762, he was promoted to Captain and appointed to Diad√®me. After the Peace of Paris in 1763, La Motte-Picquet served in squadrons under Admiral d'Orvilliers and Duchaffaut. In September 1763, he was given command of the 32-gun frigate Malicieuse to undertake a 6-month cruise off Canada.Hennequin, p.363 In the next years, he conducted several raids against the Barbary corsairs of Sal√©. In 1772, commanding the 16-gun corvette Cerf-Volant,Roche, p. 105 he distinguished himself in a training squadron under Orvilliers.. In 1776, he was given command of the 64-gun ship of the line Solitaire, with Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans as a notable participant.

In June 1777, Lamotte- Picquet commanded the 74-gun Robuste.Roche, vol.1, p.384 On 14 February 1778, he fired a nine-gun salute for USS Ranger, marking the first time a foreign warship recognised the US flag. In 1778, as a Squadron Commander, he took part in the Battle of Ouessant on the Saint-Esprit, and then cruised the English seas. During one month, he captured thirteen ships. During the American Revolutionary War, Picquet de la Motte distinguished himself as a member of Admiral d'Estaing's squadron in Martinique, during the Battle of Grenada, and the Siege of Savannah. Combat de la Martinique\\", by Auguste-Louis de Rossel de Cercy. On 18 December 1779, he attacked a British squadron under the command of Admiral Hyde Parker that was attempting to blockade a French convoy off Martinique; in the ensuing Battle of Martinique, La Motte-Picquet so impressed Hyde Parker that he sent him a letter of congratulation: In 1781, as commander of a nine-vessel squadron that included three frigates, Picquet de la Motte intercepted the fleet of Admiral Rodney en route from St. Eustatius which the British had captured in February 1781. Picquet de la Motte captured 26 British ships, along with Rodney's plunder in the amount of 5 million sterling. Soon afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant General of the Naval Armies.  Death  After fifty-two years of service and severe attacks of gout in his later years, La Motte-Piquet died on 11 June 1791 in Brest, aged 70. He was buried in the local graveyard.

The three primary reasons are spiritual, nutritional, and ethical. The ethical reasons may include a concern for God's creation, a concern for animal rights and welfare, or both. Likewise, Christian veganism is the abstaining from the use of all animal products for reasons connected to or derived from the Christian faith. Pescatarianism was widespread in the early Church, among both the clergy and laity. Some religious orders of various Christian Churches practice pescatarianism, including the Benedictines, Franciscans, Trappists, Carthusians and Cistercians.https://www.dhi.ac.uk/cistercians/cistercian_life/monastic_life/food_&_drink/index.phphttps://blog.historicenvironment.scot/2019/05/monks- menu/ Various Church leaders have recommended vegetarianism, including John Wesley (founder of the Methodist Church), William and Catherine Booth (founders of The Salvation Army), William Cowherd from the Bible Christian Church and Ellen G. White from the Seventh-day Adventists. Cowherd, who founded the Bible Christian Church in 1809, helped to establish the world's first Vegetarian Society in 1847.; Gregory, James (2007) Of Victorians and Vegetarians. London: I. B. Tauris pp. 30‚Äì35. Organizations such as the Christian Vegetarian Association (CVA) actively work to promote the concept. Additionally, many Christians may choose to practice vegetarianism as their Lenten sacrifice during the penetential season of Lent. Biblical support Christian vegetarianism has not been a common dietary choice throughout Church history. Some have argued, however, that \\"there is a long-standing tradition of vegetarianism in Christian history.\\" The two most prominent forms are a spirituality-based vegetarianism (where vegetarianism is adopted as an ascetic practice, or as a way of opposing the sin of gluttony, in the hope it will draw the person to God) and an ethically-based vegetarianism (where it is adopted for ethical reasons; for example, those to do with the treatment of non-human animals). Christian ethical vegetarianism (or veganism) usually carries with it a commitment to the normative claim that (at least some) Christians should be vegetarians. For this reason, Christian ethical vegetarians often give a scriptural justification for their position. While there are biblical passages which provide support for ethical vegetarianism, there are also passages which seem to imply that eating animals is morally permissible. Old Testament One of the most important passages for Christian vegetarians is the first creation narrative in the book of Genesis. After creating humans, God addresses them in chapter 1, verses 29‚Äì30 as follows: > God said, \\"See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the > face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have > them for food. And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the > air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the > breath of life, I have given every green plant for food\\". And it was so. In this passage, God prescribes a plant-based diet not just for humans, but for all land-based non-human animals. Christian vegetarians and vegans point out that it was this creation‚Äîwhere all creatures ate plants‚Äîthat God then declared \\"very good\\" in verse 31. Moreover, that God's initial creation was a vegan creation suggests that this is how God intended all his creatures to live. This idea‚Äîthat God intended for all his creatures to eat plants‚Äîis sometimes further supported by noting that the vision of the Peaceable Kingdom found in Isaiah suggests that God will one day restore creation to such a state. Isaiah 11:6‚Äì9 reads: > The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, > the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall > lead them. The cow and the bear shall graze, their young shall lie down > together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. The nursing child shall > play over the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put its hand on > the adder‚Äôs den. They will not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain; for > the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the > sea. Some Christian vegetarians have suggested that this eschatological view provides reasons to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet here and now. Moreover, the point has often been made that the dominion which humans are given over the non-human animals in Genesis 1:26‚Äì28 must be understood in light of Genesis 1:29‚Äì30 which decrees a plant-based diet for all creatures. Genesis 1:26‚Äì28 has, it is acknowledged by Christian vegetarians, often been used to justify the eating of animals. But this is a mistake, they suggest. Once it is recognized that humans are given dominion over creation, and that in the very next verse humans are prescribed a plant-based diet, it will become apparent that dominion should be understood in terms of stewardship or servant-hood: humans are called to rule creation in the sense of caring for it and seeking its flourishing, just as a good Sovereign would seek the flourishing of his or her realm. In a survey of the scholarly literature on the relevant Hebrew terms, Carol J. Adams lists governing, ruling, shepherding, caring-for, nurturing, and leading about as potential ways of understanding dominion, and notes that the common characteristic of these concepts \\"is their benignity\\". The opening chapters of Genesis are, of course, only the beginning of the biblical story. And just as there are passages which can be cited in support of a Christian vegetarianism or veganism, so there are passages which suggest that eating animals is morally permissible. The most problematic passages for Christian vegetarians are those which include an explicit permission to eat animals. Genesis 9:3‚Äì4 is the first such example. In this verse, God tells Noah and his family that animals will now be their food, although they are not to eat animal flesh which contains blood.[] This new situation ‚Äì that of humans eating animals ‚Äì is then taken largely for granted in much of the biblical narrative. records God giving the Israelites rules about what types of meat may be eaten, which implies that certain meats were acceptable. During the Exodus out of Egypt, God commanded that all of the Israelites to slaughter a lamb and eat it, and instituted the Passover as a lasting tradition to remember God's saving them.[] Some Jewish and Christian vegetarians have attempted to minimize the importance of these passages. It has been suggested, for example, that God's permitting Noah and his family to eat meat was only ever intended as a temporary permission, and was given because all the plants had been destroyed as a result of the flood. Others interpret the permission given to Noah and his family in Genesis 9:3‚Äì4, not as a free pass to kill animals for food because \\"no matter what you do you can never remove all the blood from the flesh of a slaughtered animal\\", but as an invitation to scavenge for and eat dead animals if any are found. These approaches are put under pressure, however, with the sheer number of passages which appear to presuppose the legitimacy of eating animals, and the normalcy with which meat eating is treated. Another approach to these texts is to suggest that God reluctantly permitted the eating of animals due to human sinfulness. In other words, God permitted humans to eat non-human animals as a concession to the Fallen state of humanity. Richard Young raises the possibility that both the introduction of animals into the human diet, and the use of animals in religious sacrifices, were concessions to a Fallen humanity that were used to deal with humanity where it was at. This approach allows the Christian vegetarian or vegan to take the entire biblical witness seriously, while also holding that God's preference is for a peace and shalom throughout creation. Other passages of relevance to the practice of vegetarianism include Numbers 11, where the Israelites tired of manna, a food of which \\"The Rabbis of the Talmud held that [‚Ä¶] had whatever taste and flavor the eater desired at the time of eating\\" and which probably was not an animal product. Manna was given to the Israelites by God, but they complained about it and wanted meat instead.[] They were condemned for this, although God relented and gave them meat, which then made them ill.[] Because of their lust, the place where the incident happened became known as Kibroth Hattaavah. A donkey temporarily given the ability to speak showed Balaam more than signs of sentience.[] Some people believe that the Book of Daniel also specifically promotes veganism as empowering. Daniel specifically refuses the king's \\"meat\\" (pa·πØba·∏°, Strong's #5698, p. 834.) and instead requests vegetables (zƒìr≈ç ø√Æm, Strong's #2235, p. 283.).[] However, current common theology argues that in this instance Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah are rejecting food that is considered to be unholy by their faith (eating food that had been sacrificed to pagan gods), and not meat per se, despite that \\"at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat\\".[] Philo says that the Essenes, \\"being more scrupulous than any in the worship of God [‚Ä¶] do not sacrifice animals [‚Ä¶], but hold it right to dedicate their own hearts as a worthy offering\\". They maintained that the sacrifices \\"polluted\\" the Temple. The Christian Vegetarian Association of the UK claims that the word \\"meat\\" is not used in any one instance in the authorized version of either the Old or New Testament as relating only to animal food (e.g. \\"flesh\\"). The CVA states that when the first English translations of the Bible were created, the word for \\"meat\\" meant food in general. When any particular kind of food was designated, it was referred to as meal, flour or grain.Meat www.christian- vegetariansvegans.org.uk, accessed 27 December 2019 According to the CVS, examples of New Testament words that were translated as \\"meat\\" include: broma (\\"that which is eaten\\"/usage: 16 times ); brosimos (\\"eatable\\"/usage: 1 time); brosis (\\"act of eating; that which is eaten, food; food of the souls/usage: 7 times); prosphagion (\\"anything eaten with bread; spoken of fish boiled or broiled\\"/usage: 1 time); sitometron (\\"a measured portion of grain or food\\"/usage: 1 time); trapeza (\\"a table on which food is placed, an eating place\\"/usage: 1 time); trophe (\\"food, nourishment\\"/usage: 13 times); phago (\\"to eat, to take food, eat a meal, devour, consume\\"/usage: 3 times).An Exegesis of \\"Meat\\" in the New Testament Archive of Comments and Discussions ‚Äì Questions and Answers From All-Creatures.org www.all-creatures.org, accessed 27 December 2019 New TestamentThe case for Christian vegetarianism= Christian vegetarians and vegans often appeal to the ethic that Jesus embodied, and called people to emulate, in making their case for a distinctively Christian vegetarianism. To begin with, Jesus inaugurated the Kingdom of God, but his Kingdom didn't involve the exercise of power as humans tend to think of it. As Andrew Linzey argues, Christ's power is \\"the power to serve\\". Human beings are called to have the same mind that was found in Jesus Christ, i.e., the mind to exercise power in service.[] And by considering Jesus's life, it is possible to get an idea of what that service means. Sarah Withrow King writes that Jesus \\"loved the unlovable. In first-century Palestine, the unlovable were women, children, sick people, poor people, Roman soldiers, zealots, lepers, the blind, the outcast\\", and so on. But today, the unlovable should include those non-human animals who are farmed for food in systems which preclude their flourishing and result in their (often painful) deaths. Christian vegetarians also stress the importance Jesus laid on peace and inclusion. These and other aspects of Jesus's attitudes towards others are used to extract ethical principles which, according to Christian vegetarians and vegans, lead one to a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle. Sarah Withrow King summarizes the point like this: > Aware of the suffering and pain experienced by animals raised and killed for > food, with a knowledge of the immense waste of natural resources and > subsequent impact on both our fellow humans and the rest of creation, and > acknowledging that flesh is not a dietary necessity for the vast majority of > Western humans, why would we continue to participate in a system that > dishonors God‚Äôs creation and perpetuates violence on a truly phenomenal > scale? =Difficult passages Luke 24 ‚Äì Jesus's eating of a fish  There are several passages that appear to count against the idea that vegetarianism or veganism could be mandatory for Christians. Some of the most challenging are those passages which speak of Jesus eating fish,[] and Jesus telling his disciples where to catch fish, before cooking it for them to eat.[] Jesus's eating of fish is supposed to cause a problem for Christian ethical vegetarians and vegans because, if Jesus ate fish, then, since Jesus was without sin, eating fish cannot be wrong. And therefore, so the argument goes, it must be permissible for Jesus's followers to eat fish. The same reasoning could be used to justify the eating of any meats that Jesus ate, if it is assumed that he did indeed eat other kinds of meat (the Bible does not explicitly say Jesus ate any meat other than fish, and some writers have made much of the fact that no lamb is mentioned at the Last Supper.) Although it is a question commonly posed to Christian vegetarians, Jesus's eating of fish (and potentially other meat) does not straightforwardly justify the eating of meat today. Many Christians in the West, for example, would consider the eating of cats and dogs morally wrong. Moreover, they would not change their judgement if it were claimed that the cats and dogs had \\"had a good life\\", or had been treated well prior to being slaughtered. But any Christian who thinks that eating a cat or a dog is wrong, cannot appeal to Jesus's eating of fish (and possibly other meat) as providing a blanket permission to eat meat. The same point can be made by appealing to the fact that many meat-eating Christians think that foods such as foie gras or veal should not be eaten because their production involves great cruelty. Foie gras, for example, is produced by over-feeding‚Äîoften by force-feeding‚Äîducks and geese so that their livers become artificially enlarged beyond their natural size. This controversial practice is illegal in the UK, Germany, and many other countries in Europe, as well as in Argentina, Australia, Israel, and several US states. Any Christian who agrees that the production and eating of foie gras is immoral cannot at the same time appeal to Jesus's eating of fish (possibly other meat) as a blanket permission to eat any meat whatever. The point can be put like this: the fact that Jesus ate fish (and possibly other meat) shows that, in some circumstances, it is sometimes permissible to eat some meats. But Jesus's eating of fish (possibly meat) doesn't show that eating meat is always justified. At this point in the debate, Christian vegetarians and vegans are likely to point to practices in the modern, industrialized farming system, which they think make the eating of meat produced in such farms morally problematic‚Äîpractices such as, to give just one example, the mass killing of day-old male chicks from laying hens. Some Christian vegetarians and vegans have appealed to biblical scholarship to argue that biblical passages often need nuanced interpretation, and to guard against a wooden literalism. Andy Alexis-Baker, for example, points to the work of Gerald O'Collins, SJ, who suggests that differences between the way Luke describes this appearance in Luke 24:41‚Äì43 and in Acts 1, and a tension between Luke 24:41‚Äì43 and 1 Corinthians 6, preclude us from reading this verse literally. This serves to caution readers of the Bible about drawing ethical conclusions from such biblical passages too quickly. Others have explained this passage by the appealing to a so-called \\"synoptic principle\\". Also available on the author's website; retrieved 2011-09-23.  Acts 10 ‚Äì Peter's vision  In the tenth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, there is an account of a vision given to the Apostle Peter. In this vision, Peter is shown a large sheet being lowered from heaven by its four corners. The sheet is said to contain animals of all kinds, and Peter then hears a voice (which he interprets as a command from God) saying, \\"Get up, Peter; kill and eat\\".[] Peter refuses, and the voice says \\"What God has made clean, you must not call profane\\".[] Many see this passage as teaching that it is permissible for Christians to eat any creatures, and that therefore while it is still permissible for Christians to follow a vegetarian or vegan diet if they wish, such a diet cannot be obligatory for any Christians. Christian vegetarians and vegans put forward another interpretation. To understand the meaning of Peter's vision, it is necessary to read Acts chapter 10 in its entirety. The opening of the chapter recounts how a Roman Centurion named Cornelius, a devout God-fearing Gentile, himself had a vision in which he is instructed to send someone to Peter. Cornelius obeys. The text then recounts how the next day Peter became hungry while he was praying.[] While waiting for his food, he fell into a trance and it is at this point that he receives the aforementioned vision. While Peter is puzzling over the meaning of the vision, the men that Cornelius sent to Peter arrive at the house where Peter is staying. Peter is instructed to go with them,[] and he does so. This is significant because Peter was a Jew, and it was against the Jewish law for Jews to associate with Gentiles.[] And so, what the text seems to be saying is that the vision Peter received about eating unclean animals was actually about the message of the Gospel and how it was for everyone, even \\"unclean\\" Gentiles. The text appears to report Peter himself as recognizing this. After Cornelius tells Peter of the vision that he received, and how he sent men to find Peter as a result of the angel's message to him, Peter exclaims: \\"I truly understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.\\"[] Christian vegetarians and vegans, in other words, tend to say that this passage is not about which animals one may or may not eat, but it is about who the Gospel is for, as Laura Hobgood-Oster puts it: > The vision, it seems, is not about eating animals; rather it is about > extending hospitality to all humans. While animals in sacred texts are often > real animals and should be considered as such, in this particular case it > seems that in Peter‚Äôs vision animals symbolized human categories that > exclude other humans from community. Sarah Withrow King writes that God uses this vision to remind Peter that he is to \\"remove barriers of fellowship and to reconcile with those from whom we have been separated in order to further the reign of God on earth.... the vision is one of radical inclusion\\". This interpretation is supported by (1) noting that there is no better way to get the attention of a hungry person than to use a vision involving food, and (2) there is no mention in the passage of what food is actually served, so we cannot assume that the vision is telling Peter that he must eat the unclean food when he visits Cornelius's house. John Vujicic agrees with the interpretation above and supports it with two further observations. First, he notes that after receiving the vision, Peter did not eat anything. But, Vujicic writes, \\"In the sheet were also so called CLEAN animals. Peter could have at least selected some sheep or cattle and killed but he didn‚Äôt.\\" Second, according to Vujicic, the reason Peter didn't simply take up and eat a clean animal was because Peter was in fact a vegetarian. Peter is reported as describing himself as a vegetarian in the Clementine Homilies. This last point will be unconvincing to many Christians, because the Clementine Homilies are not canonical literature. Mark 7 ‚Äì Jesus declares all foods clean In Mark 7:14‚Äì15, Jesus says the following: \\"'Listen to me, all of you, and understand: there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile, but the things that come out are what defile.'\\". His disciples fail to understand, so once they are alone with Jesus, they ask him about it, and Jesus elaborates as follows: \\"Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile, since it enters, not the heart but the stomach, and goes out into the sewer? ... It is what comes out of a person that defiles. For it is from within, from the human heart, that evil intentions come.\\"[] In the middle of this speech, the author of the Gospel of Mark writes explicitly that in saying these things, Jesus \\"declared all foods clean\\". In this passage, Jesus is teaching that his followers do not need to obey the Jewish dietary laws. The context also makes clear that Jesus's focus is on the status of the human heart, which he sees as the source of evil intentions, and not the mere observing of rules. In the opening verses of Mark chapter 7, Jesus is challenged by the \\"Pharisees and scribes\\" who \\"live according to the tradition of the elders\\".[] Jesus's reply is that following religious rules and traditions is often done as a way of avoiding following God and God's commandments.[] Jesus's teaching that all foods were now clean was a continuation of this: what matters is the human heart, not external observance to religious rules. Some Christians and Christian groups suggest that Jesus's teaching in Mark 7 demonstrates that Christians can eat whatever they want, that dietary choices are a matter of \\"Christian liberty\\", and that therefore vegetarianism or veganism could never be obligatory for Christians. Christian vegetarians and vegans counter, however, that the point of Jesus's teaching in Mark 7 is that his followers should concern themselves with the status of their heart which \\"informs our relationship with God, with each other, and the world\\". At most, we could deduce that when Jesus declared all foods clean, he was implicitly accepting the permissibility for his immediate audience of eating the meat that was available to them in Israel in the first- century. But it doesn't follow from this that all Christians everywhere can eat whatever they like. Christian vegetarians and vegans might make the point described above in the discussion of Luke 24, namely, that few Christians in the West think it is okay to eat cats, dogs, or foods such as foie gras. If, however, it is morally problematic to eat cats, dogs or foie gras, then Jesus's declaring all foods clean doesn't make eating animals purely a matter of \\"Christian liberty\\", if by that is meant that each person can decide for him- or herself what to eat. Quite the opposite appears to be true. If Jesus's point in this passage was that the source of human evil comes from the intentions within the human heart, then Jesus's followers should seek to avoid behaviors and practices which involve intentionally inflicting cruelty on the non-human animals that God has created. Early Christianity=New Testament Vegetarianism appears to have been a point of contention within some early Christian circles, notably in Rome. Within the Bible's New Testament, the Apostle Paul states that people of \\"weak faith\\" \\"eat only vegetables\\",[] although he also warns both meat-eaters and vegetarians to \\"stop passing judgment on one another\\" when it comes to food in verse 13 and \\"[It is] good neither to eat flesh\\" in verse 21. Paul also said, \\"The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. They [‚Ä¶] order [‚Ä¶] to abstain from certain foods\\".[] According to the Christian Vegetarian Association, Paul was not referring to vegetarianism, which they say was not an issue in those times, but to the practice of not eating meat from the meat market because of fear that (like the above issue involving Daniel) it was sacrificed to an idol.[] \\"Wherefore, if meat [br≈çma, Strong's #1033, 'anything used as food' Translated by Joseph Henry Thayer.] make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.\\" Patristic evidence In the 4th Century some Jewish Christian groups maintained that Jesus was himself a vegetarian. Epiphanius quotes the Gospel of the Ebionites where Jesus has a confrontation with the high priest. Jesus chastises the leadership saying, \\"I am come to end the sacrifices and feasts of blood; and if ye cease not offering and eating of flesh and blood, the wrath of God shall not cease from you; even as it came to your fathers in the wilderness, who lusted for flesh, and did sate to their content, and were filled with rottenness, and the plague consumed them.\\" According to Lightfoot, \\"the Christianized Essennes [‚Ä¶] condemned the slaughter of victims on grounds very different from those alleged in the Epistle of Hebrews, not because they have been superseded by the Atonement, but because they are in their very nature repulsive to God; not because they have ceased to be right, but because they never were right from the beginning\\". Other early Christian historical documents observe that many influential Christians during the formative centuries of Christianity were vegetarian, though certainly not all. The Clementine homilies, a second- century work purportedly based on the teachings of the Apostle Peter, states, \\"The unnatural eating of flesh meats is as polluting as the heathen worship of devils, with its sacrifices and its impure feasts, through participation in it a man becomes a fellow eater with devils.\\"Homily XII Although early Christian vegetarianism appears to have been downplayed in favor of more \\"modern\\" Christian culture, the practice of vegetarianism appears to have been very widespread in early Christianity, both in the leadership and among the laity. Origen's work Contra Celsum quotes Celsus commenting vegetarian practices among Christians he had contact with. Although not vegetarian himself and vehemently against the idea that Christians must be vegetarians, Augustine nevertheless wrote that those Christians who \\"abstain both from flesh and from wine\\" are \\"without number\\".On the Morals of the Catholic Church 33. Apud Churches and movements=Historical developments The Bible Christian Church founded by Reverend William Cowherd in 1809 followed a vegetarian diet. Cowherd was one of the philosophical forerunners of the Vegetarian Society. Cowherd encouraged members to abstain from eating of meat as a form of temperance. Cowherd emphasized that vegetarianism was good for health, whilst eating meat was unnatural and likely to cause aggression. Later he is reputed to have said \\"If God had meant us to eat meat, then it would have come to us in edible form [as is the ripened fruit].\\" Ellen G. White, vegetarian and co- founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The Seventh-day Adventists present a health message that recommends vegetarianism and expects abstinence from pork, shellfish and other foods proscribed as \\"unclean\\" in Leviticus.Caring for Creation ‚Äì A Statement on the Environment A number of the founders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, including Joseph Bates and Ellen White adopted a vegetarian diet during the nineteenth century, and Ellen White reportedly received visions regarding the health benefits of a vegetarian diet.White, Arthur. Ellen G. White Volume 2: The Progressive Years 1862‚Äì1876, Review & Herald Publishing, 1986. More recently, members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in California have been involved in research into longevity due to their healthy lifestyle, which includes maintaining a vegetarian diet.Loma Linda University Adventist Health Study: Mortality www.llu.edu accessed 28 December 2019 This research has been included within a National Geographic article.Longevity, The Secrets of Long Life ‚Äì National Geographic MagazineThese traditional diets can lead to long lives www.nationalgeographic.com, accessed 28 December 2019 Another denomination with common origin, the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement recommends vegetarianism as a part of fellowship, with many of its members being practicing vegans as well. Typically, however, these sabbatarian pro- vegetarian Christian fellowships do not \\"require vegetarianism as a test of fellowship.\\" The Word of Wisdom is a dietary law given to adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement (also known as Mormonism), which states that \\"flesh also of beasts and of fowls of the air... are to be used sparingly,\\" and that \\"it is pleasing unto [God] that they should not be used, only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine\\". Unlike injunctions against tobacco and alcohol, compliance with this part of the Doctrine and Covenants has never been made mandatory by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the largest Latter Day Saint denomination. Many LDS Church leaders have expressed their views on the subject of meat, but since Joseph F. Smith became church president in 1901, emphasis on refraining from meat has largely been dropped.Thomas G. Alexander, \\"The Word of Wisdom: From Principle to Requirement\\", Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 14:3 (1981) pp. 78‚Äì88. An official church publication states, \\"[m]odern methods of refrigeration now make it possible to preserve meat in any season\\".\\"Section 89 The Word of Wisdom\\", Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2002), pp. 206‚Äì11. As recently as 2012, official church spokesperson Michael Otterson stated \\"the church has also encouraged limiting meat consumption in favor of grains, fruits and vegetables.\\" Of note is that the LDS Church owns and operates Deseret Ranches in central Florida, which is one of the largest cow-calf operations in the United States.\\"Culture Clash\\".

Some members of the Religious Society of Friends (also known as Quakers) practice vegetarianism or veganism as a reflection of the Peace Testimony, extending non-violence towards animals. Historically, the early vegetarian movement had many Quaker promoters. Some Ranter groups ‚Äì non-conformist Christian groups that existed in 17th-century England ‚Äì were vegetarian. Roman Catholic monastic orders such as the Carthusians and Cistercians follow a strict vegetarian diet. Carmelites and others following the Rule of St. Albert also maintain a vegetarian diet, although the old and sick are permitted to eat meat according to this rule of life. The Liberal Catholic Movement traditionally had many people who were vegetarians and still have.\\"Liberal Catholic Church\\". Cross Denominational Mission. Quote: \\"[The Liberal Catholic Church] encourages its priests and its bishops to have a vegetarian diet and to refrain from using tobacco as well as alcohol.\\" Christian anarchists, such as Leo Tolstoy, Ammon Hennacy, and Th√©odore Monod, extend the Christian principles of compassion and nonviolence through following a vegetarian diet. Contemporary movements The Christian Vegetarian Association (CVA) is an international, non-denominational Christian vegetarian organization that promotes responsible stewardship of God's creation through plant-based eating. The CVA produced the 2006 film Honoring God‚Äôs Creation.Honoring God's Creation www.godtube.com accessed 28 December 2019 Sarx is a UK-based organization which aims to \\"empower Christians to champion the cause of animals and live peacefully with all God‚Äôs creatures\\". Sarx publishes interviews with Christian vegans and vegetarians on its website, and provides people to speak at Churches in the UK on topics such as Christianity and veganism, animal welfare and faith, creation and animals. CreatureKind is an organization which exists \\"to encourage Christians to recognize faith-based reasons for caring about the well-being of fellow animal creatures used for food, and to take practical action in response\\". It was founded by David Clough, Professor of Theological Ethics at the University of Chester, and is directed by Clough and Sarah Withrow King, an American author and deputy directory of the Sider Center at Eastern University. CreatureKind produces a course for churches to do which facilitates church groups to think through how Christians should respond to and treat animals. Catholic Concern for Animals (CCA) is a charity which calls Catholics \\"to cherish and care for all of [God's] creation\\". CCA has for \\"many years\\" promoted a vegetarian/vegan diet as a way of caring for creation, in particular animals. The group Evangelicals for Social Action have suggested that a vegan diet is a way of demonstrating Christian love and compassion to farmed animals, and argue in particular that this is what a consistently pro-life ethic looks like. Christian Vegetarians and Vegans UK is an organization seeking to promote a vegetarian/vegan lifestyle in the Church in the UK.CHRISTIAN VEGETARIANS & VEGANS UK www.christian-vegetariansvegans.org.uk, accessed 27 December 2019 Partial fasting and temporary abstinence During Lent some Christian communities, such as Orthodox Christians in the Middle East, undertake partial fasting eating only one light meal per day. For strict Greek Orthodox Christians and Copts, all meals during this 40-day period are prepared without animal products and are essentially vegan. Unlike veganism, however, abstaining from animal products during Lent is intended to be only temporary and not a permanent way of life. Eastern Orthodox laity traditionally abstains from animal products on Wednesdays (because, according to Christian tradition, Judas betrayed Jesus on the Wednesday prior to the Crucifixion of Jesus) and Fridays (because Jesus is thought to have been crucified on the subsequent Friday), as well as during the four major fasting periods of the year: Great Lent, the Apostles' Fast, the Dormition Fast and the Nativity Fast. Catholic laity traditionally abstain from animal flesh on Fridays and through the Lenten season leading up to Easter (sometimes being required to do so by law, see fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church), some also, as a matter of private piety, observe Wednesday abstinence. Fish is not considered proper meat in any case (see pescetarianism, though the Eastern Orthodox allow fish only on days on which the fasting is lessened but meat still not allowed). For these practices, \\"animal rights\\" are no motivation and positive environmental or individual health effects only a surplus benefit; the actual reason is to practice mortification and some marginal asceticism. Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox, and Eastern Catholic monastics abstain from meat year-round, and many abstain from dairy and seafood as well. Through obedience to the Orthodox Church and its ascetic practices,Disclaimer: \\"The meaning of asceticism discourses is complex.\\" The word, however, is frequently used in a derogatory way against the veg(etari)an movement. Characterizing veganism as asceticism, pp. 141‚Äì142. In: the Orthodox Christian seeks to rid himself or herself of the passions, or the disposition to sin. According to Canon Law, Roman Catholics are required to abstain from meat (defined as all animal flesh and organs, excluding water animals) on Ash Wednesday and all Fridays of Lent including Good Friday. Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are also fast days for Catholics ages 18 to 60, in which one main meal and two half-meals are eaten, with no snacking. Canon Law also obliges Catholics to abstain from meat on the Fridays of the year outside of Lent (excluding certain holy days) unless, with the permission of the local conference of bishops, another penitential act is substituted. Exceptions are allowed for health and necessity like manual labor and not causing offense when being a guest. The restrictions on eating meat on these days is solely as an act of penance and not because of a religious objection to eating meat. In 1966, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops the conference of bishops has made substitution of a different penitential or charitable act an option for ordinary Fridays in their territory. After previous abolition, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales restored the meatless ordinary Friday requirement for their territory effective September, 2011. A popular misconception is that Pope Gregory I (who ruled from 590 to 604, and who is also a canonized saint) declared that rabbits were not meat. This is apparently a corruption of a manuscript in which Saint Gregory of Tours described one person (who was also ill and might not have been Catholic) eating a rabbit fetus during Lent. The rules are widely ignored; a 2016 survey found that only 62% of U.S. Catholics said they avoid meat on Fridays during Lent.

It is notable for its covered bridge, which was destroyed on April 28, 2005, by a fire set by an arsonist. A historically accurate reconstruction of the bridge was completed in October, 2006. History Around 1823 a sawmill was built on the banks of Big Raccoon creek south of the Ten O'Clock Line by two men, Joseph Lockwood and Issac J. Sillman, for Joseph O'Niel and James Wasson. A buhrstone was added later to grind corn and wheat. Daniel Kalley and a James Searing would later buy the mill in 1837 from James and Mary Wasson for $1,600. Within a few several years a distillery was built but around 1845 the mill and distillery burned down. Here the story of the mill at Bridgeton splits between two different resources. One is from the Indiana Historical Society and the other is the paperwork submitted to the National Park Services for Bridgeton's application as an Historic District. The NPR version states that by 1848 the Onsley brothers and William Bean would replace the mill with a hewn log building to fill the need of a local mill. That same year a hewn log bridge was built to span the Big Raccoon Creek giving farmers to the north of town easier access to the mill. The Indiana Historical Society states that the fall after the mill was destroyed by fire that the townspeople staged a \\"frolic\\" to build a new log mill. Searing then sold the mill for $2,000 to James Mullikin and Dr. Henry T. Ketchem. Ketchum soon sold his share back to Searing and in 1851 Mullikin acquired complete ownership of the mill. Mullikin then, sometime before January 1859, tore down the mill and built a new one as well as a general store. Stones were installed for grinding corn as well as stones for wheat. In January 1859 William Beal purchased the mill and surrounding land but sold it to William Blaize in December 1860 for $8,000. In 1862 Ralph Sprauge would acquire the mill. Sprague and his son-in-law, George W. Phelon, entered into a partnership to run the mill. The partnership was dissolved in 1874 with Sprague continuing to run the mill until he sold it in 1882 to Daniel Webster. Daniel Webster had been born three miles outside of Bridgeton in 1830. Webster had been a farmer and had made a small fortune in the coal mining business before investing in the mill. Originally Bridgeton was known as Lockwood Mills for the local mill, but later became known as Sodom because of the drinking and fighting that took place. On Saturday's and public days the mill acted as a community social center with people conducting business and exchanging gossip. For twenty-five cents a gallon of whiskey could be bought and the townsmen would engage in horse races and sometimes fights. The village applied for a post office in 1849 and the name was changed to Bridgeton. The original plat was recorded the same year which included most of the town as it exists today. Bridgeton Historic District The Bridgeton Historic District in the city of Bridgeton, Indiana, is \\"home to the oldest continuously operating mill west of the Allegheny Mountains.\\"http://www.bridgetonindiana.com/ Welcome To Historic Bridgeton, Indiana Bridgeton Mill A significant figure in Bridgeton's history would be Ralph Sprague. In 1862 he bought the mill, however, in 1868 fire would claim this mill too. Sprague decided to rebuild and the present mill was erected in 1871, it is considered the most historically important building in the district. The new mill, 1871, would be equipped with a large set of burr stones for feed, roller mills for flour, and a small set of burr stones for corn. The total cost was $14,000. With a sandstone foundation and heavy timber frame the mill stands three stories and is capped by a gable roof. Water would enter the basement through large arches in the foundation to power water turbines which would provide mechanical power for the mill. Daniel Webster bought the mill in 1882 for $15,000 and in 1886 hired the Richmond Milling Company to modernize the mill by replacing the burr stones with more efficient steel roll mills, sieves, and sifters. Under Webster's direction the mill prospered and came to be known as the Bridgeton Roller Mills. The farmers originally paid for their milling services with 1/6th of their grain, in 1853 a new state law set it at 1/8th. During the Webster period the mill was operated on the exchange system. Farmers would receive 35 pounds of flour per bushel of wheat and forty pounds of meal per bushel of corn. The mill was capable of 75 barrels of flour per day. The Bridgeton Mill used assorted brand names over the years, including, Family, Anchor, White Satin, White Oak, Spring Wheat Patent, and Snowdrift for its flour. Daniel Webster died in 1895 and about three years later P.T. Winney of Clay County purchased the mill for $3,500. Winney had two 220 volt generators installed and from 1906 until his death in 1913 offered electricity for the town. George E. Brake, Winney's stepson, and Fred A. Mitchell bought the mill in 1914 for $2,700 and finished reinforcing the dam, started by Winney, with poured concrete. By 1915 Charles Mitchell bought Fred A. Mitchell's interest in the mill but then in 1922 he sold it to Earl D. Miller. Brake and Miller would continue to run the mill until 1935 when Hugh W. Knoll purchased it, but only for a brief period, before selling it to A. Dale Hough for $3,000. Hough had a new foundation laid in the mill and installed a bleaching system for the flour. Charles D. Hansel would purchase the mill after Hough died in 1938. The Bridgeton Mill followed the history of many other mills in Indiana when it was converted to a feed mill in 1938 by its new owner, C.D. Hansel. Hansel had the roll mill and burr stones removed and added a concrete block extension to the south. In 1940 Ernest and Mildred Weise and their son Robert bought the mill, which they operated as the Weise Milling Company. With the construction of the Mansfield Dam in 1957, and the already declining water level of the Big Raccoon Creek, the Weises converted the mill to an electric powered feed grain operation. A glazed block office was added on east side of the mill. 1969 brought the end of daily operations at the mill though products were still produced and sold to tourists and by mail order year-round. In 1972 the Weises purchased some burr stones from an old mill in New Palestine and reinstalled them at the Bridgeton Mill. The mill was then bought by Mike and Karen Roe in 1995. Along with help, and recipes, from the Weise family, the mill continues to operate today \\"10 till tired\\", April 1 through the second weekend of December. Sprague-Webster-Kerr House - \\"1878 House\\" Ralph Sprague had this classic gabled ell house built in 1878.(pictured at right) Located on Main Street it is a two story wood-frame house featuring Italianate ornamentation resting on a sandstone foundation. The house is sheathed in wood clapboard siding and has two gable roof sections. Both the front and side gable ends feature distinctive \\"1878\\" oculus vents. Sprague lived there until he sold the mill, which included the house, in 1882 to Daniel Webster. The Rockville Republican described Mr. Webster as, \\"one of your fat, jolly old fellows you like to meet.\\" He and his family lived in the house and owned the mill until 1899. In 1899 James H. Kerr purchased the house but after his death it sat empty for many years until Chales Peffley eventually bought it. The house served as a single family residence until 1980 when it was converted into a gift shop. Locally it is known as the \\"1878 House.\\" Free & Accepted Masons Lodge 169 File:Bridgeton Indiana Masonic Lodge.jpgBridgeton, Indiana, Masonic Lodge prior to the 1913 removal of the 3rd floor. In 1869 the Freemasons built a three story Masonic Lodge across the street from where the present mill would be built. In 1913 the third story was removed (after a fire ravaged the upper story). The Lodge is the oldest building in Bridgeton. It is also one of the last Masonic Moon lodges left in the country. Because of poor roads and traveling conditions meetings were held on the night of the full moon, or within a few days before or after the full moon, to make travel safer and easier.

News at Ten rose to popularity for its winning combination of in-depth, analytical news coverage and populist stories.' It simultaneously helped popularise newscasters such as Alastair Burnet, Andrew Gardner, Reginald Bosanquet, Sandy Gall, Anna Ford, John Suchet, Mark Austin, Alastair Stewart and Trevor McDonald into well-known television personalities. When the bulletin was axed in 1999 in order for primetime entertainment programming to air uninterrupted, there was a public outcry. ITV reluctantly brought the programme back ‚Äì under the name ITV News at Ten ‚Äì in 2001, airing it at 10pm for a minimum of three nights per week, but eventually replaced it with the ITV News at 10:30 in 2004. It was not until January 2008 that News at Ten was reinstated to the ITV schedule. The programme's current main anchor is Tom Bradby. History=1967 to 1999: the original run ITN had been ITV's news provider since the channel's launch in September 1955. News updates from ITN tended to run 14 minutes in length at most, with no fixed broadcast time. From his arrival in 1956, ITN editor Geoffrey Cox had consistently argued to the Independent Television Authority that ITN should be providing at least one news bulletin of substantial length, in order to cover and analyse major news stories more closely. ITV argued against the idea of a 30-minute evening bulletin, insisting a news programme of such length would eat into its primetime entertainment schedule and turn viewers away from the channel, but the ITA granted Cox's wish in 1967. ITV reluctantly agreed to give the proposed bulletin ‚Äì a Monday-to-Friday programme, fixed at 10pm ‚Äì a 13-week trial run to test its success. A still from a News at Ten opening sequence from its launch. News at Ten began broadcasting on 3 July 1967 under the editorship of Cox, who stipulated that the aim of the new programme was to \\"remove the spin and bring facts and the news as it really was.\\" ITV's stance was seemingly confirmed early; the programme had little news to cover in its first few editions, having launched in the middle of summer during a slow news week. However, a reversal of fortunes quickly took place after an \\"action story\\" from ITN reporter Alan Hart on the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders re- entering Crater, which ran for a then-unheard-of length of 5 minutes.' A series of similar in-depth reports eventually helped to give News at Ten a regular viewership of seven million every night, forcing ITV to keep the programme. By 1969, News at Ten had become the first news bulletin in Britain to enter the top 20 most-watched programmes of the week. The arrival of the new 30-minute programme allowed ITN to give a more in-depth and detailed treatment of serious news for the first time on British television, as well as coverage of populist stories and issues that would attract the viewing audience. The programme built on these concepts by introducing reporter packages, not the norm then but now a staple of television news, and a team of two newscasters taking turns to read stories instead of a sole presenter: a two-man team would inject personality into television news, as well as allow breaking news to be handed to the newscaster not in vision. The original newscasting team included Alastair Burnet, Andrew Gardner, Reginald Bosanquet, George Ffitch and Leonard Parkin. News at Ten also employed several other distinctive features which proved popular with viewers: the use of Big Ben's chimes (or \\"bongs\\") to separate the news headlines being read in the opening sequence, and the \\"‚Ä¶ And Finally\\" report ‚Äì a quirky and often humorous end piece designed to send the viewing audience to bed \\"on a high note\\" after 30 minutes of hard news coverage. News at Ten developed a solid reputation for its extensive coverage of international news stories. Foreign correspondent Sandy Gall, the first ITN journalist to cover the start of the Vietnam War in 1965, returned there on several occasions to produce reports for News at Ten until he was forcibly removed from the country following the Fall of Saigon in 1975. Michael Nicholson reported in-depth on the 1976 Soweto uprising for News at Ten, and later went on to cover the Falklands War in 1982, after which he was awarded the South Atlantic Medal for his work. News at Ten, by now the UK's most popular news programme, ultimately forced the BBC to follow ITN's lead and extend its own programming to match, although Lord Annan declared in his 1977 Committee into the Future of Broadcasting, \\"We subscribe to the generally held view that ITN has the edge over BBC News.\\" In the absence of Alastair Burnet (who left ITN in 1972 to pursue a career in print journalism), News at Ten paired Andrew Gardner and Reginald Bosanquet to create one of the programme's most well liked newscasting duos. In 1978, Anna Ford became the bulletin's first female newscaster, and Alastair Burnet rejoined the programme in the same year. For more than a decade onwards, Burnet was the newscaster most associated with News at Ten, his \\"serious persona\\", \\"sepulchral tones\\" and \\"deferential interviewing style\\" becoming respected hallmarks of the programme. By the late 1980s, Burnet ‚Äì now a member of the ITN board of directors and News at Ten's associate editor ‚Äì began to draw criticism that he was losing the personal touch with his audience, allowing News at Ten to settle into a \\"stodgy\\" and \\"old-fashioned\\" complacency. Nonetheless, the programme continued to maintain a solid high audience during the 1980s and well into the next decade. The development of satellite technology in the 1980s allowed News at Ten to broadcast live from several locations around the world, including the Great Wall of China during a visit from the Queen in 1986. Alastair Burnet presented News at Ten from the United States during several presidential campaigns, as well as the 1984 conventions of the Republican and Democratic parties. Alastair Stewart presented News at Ten live from Saudi Arabia, the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the liberated Kuwait City during the 1991 Gulf War. Burnet retired from ITN in 1991 after several clashes with the ITV companies over the future of the news organisation. In November 1992, News at Ten was given its first major relaunch, in part to address the criticism it had attracted over the last few years. In a bid to regain the personal touch that had been lost, the programme dispensed with the dual-presentation team in favour of a sole newscaster, Trevor McDonald, who subsequently became one of the most well-known newscasters in the UK. Julia Somerville, John Suchet and Dermot Murnaghan each presented News at Ten when McDonald was absent. The bulletin carried this format until March 1999. Despite News at Ten's continued stature and popularity, ITV announced its intention to axe the bulletin in 1993, proposing two new peak-time bulletins at 6:30pm and 11pm. ITV justified the move as a measure to stem the decline in television viewing audiences and to allow the uninterrupted broadcast of movies, dramas and other entertainment programmes, but the plans were met with widespread criticism from viewers, several Members of Parliament, the then-Prime Minister John Major and the National Heritage Committee.' The Independent Television Commission ruled that ITV had not established a solid case for the removal of News at Ten, pointing to BBC News having experienced a larger viewing decline than ITN, but were restructuring the contents of their news programmes rather than move them to different timeslots. The proposals were eventually withdrawn after the ITC threatened ITV with legal action. 1999 to 2008: axing and the News at When? era In September 1998, following intense lobbying from the ITV companies, the ITC finally reviewed plans for a new weekday primetime ITV schedule that saw the removal of News at Ten (and the 5:40pm Early Evening News) in favour of new 6:30pm and 11:00pm news bulletins. The ITC undertook extensive audience research which found that the public preferred News at Ten to stay by a proportion of 5 to 3, but nonetheless granted ITV permission to axe News at Ten for a one-year trial period. The programme's demise in March 1999 coincided with an overhaul of news on ITV, which continued to be produced by ITN, but now branded on screen as ITV News. Trevor McDonald presented the new flagship ITV Evening News at 6:30pm, a one-minute news summary was broadcast at 10pm, and this was followed by the 20-minute ITV Nightly News at 11:00pm presented by Dermot Murnaghan. But these changes ultimately resulted in a 13.9% decline in overall viewing figures for ITV News. In 2000, the ITC ordered ITV to reinstate News at Ten to stem the ratings decline. The BBC then decided to cash in on the move by shifting its own long-running Nine O'Clock News to 10pm. McDonald returned to front the retitled ITV News at Ten in 2001, with a dual-presenting team of Dermot Murnaghan and Mary Nightingale replacing McDonald on the ITV Evening News. However, the haphazard scheduling of the revived 10pm bulletin ultimately led to its downfall. While the BBC's Ten O'Clock News was fixed at 10pm for six nights a week, the ITV News at Ten was broadcast for only three nights a week, allowing entertainment programmes to be broadcast past 10pm for the rest of the week. In addition, the programme was often delayed by overrunning entertainment programmes on the nights that it was scheduled for 10pm. This inconsistency led to the bulletin being unceremoniously dubbed News at When? In 2003, ITV received approval from the ITC to axe the programme and replace it with the ITV News at 10:30, fixed at that time every weeknight. McDonald presented this bulletin from its launch on 2 February 2004 until his retirement on 15 December 2005. Mark Austin became the programme's main host from January 2006. 2008 to 2015: reinstatement to ITV schedules In October 2007, ITV chairman Michael Grade announced the return of News at Ten, following comments he made in March that the original removal of the programme was \\"a shocking mistake [that] damaged ITV more than anything else.\\" The bulletin returned with its original name on 14 January 2008, broadcast from Monday to Thursday at 10pm, with an 11pm bulletin titled The Late News airing on Friday evenings. The revived News at Ten saw the reintroduction of the dual-newscaster team, pairing new presenter Julie Etchingham with Trevor McDonald, who had temporarily come out of retirement. Etchingham and Mark Austin presented The Late News. In March 2009, The Late News was dropped in order for News at Ten to return to its traditional Monday- to-Friday 10pm slot, giving the programme a \\"consistent home at the heart of the schedule\\". McDonald finally retired from News at Ten in October 2008 after hosting the programme's special US election coverage from Washington and was replaced by Mark Austin in November. Austin presented the ITV News at 6:30 simultaneously until he was replaced on that programme by Alastair Stewart. News at Ten struggled to regain its high viewing figures following several years out of the 10pm timeslot, its 2008 return watched by 3.8 million viewers in comparison to 4.9m for the BBC. However, the bulletin occasionally beat the BBC News at 10 in the ratings: an overrunning football match on BBC One helped deliver ITV 4.3m at 10pm; severe weather conditions on 2 February 2009 saw terrestrial TV news bulletins receive a boost in ratings and News at Ten was watched by 4.8m; and a week of special Britain's Got Talent semi-final programmes in May 2009 saw News at Ten beat the BBC with figures of 6.1m (26 May) and 6.4m (28 May), the latter being the programme's highest audience figure since 2003. In November 2009, the famous Big Ben clock tower was removed from the programme's opening credits after concerns it alienated viewers outside London, but was ultimately reinstated to News at Ten's opening sequence following a further ITV relaunch in January 2013. From November 2009 onwards, the bulletin has been titled on screen as ITV News at Ten. 2015‚Äìpresent: refocus on reputation As part of a move to enhance the reputation of ITV's news and current affairs output, News at Ten was restructured and redeveloped across a number of months: the new format launched in October 2015, placing more emphasis on analysis, context and a more \\"conversational\\" presentation style under new presenter Tom Bradby, former ITV News political editor; then the appointments of former BBC News journalists Robert Peston (as political editor) and Allegra Stratton (as national editor), who both reiterated in the press ITV's newfound intention to challenge the dominance of BBC News; and a refreshed set and opening title sequence in January 2016. In November 2015, it was reported that tension had developed between senior figures at the BBC and ITV following comments made about the viewing figures for both 10pm news bulletins: prior to the News at Ten relaunch, Bradby commented on the powerful nature of BBC News during an interview with The Telegraph, saying that the scheduling of BBC One's 10pm news against ITV's News at Ten was not in the public interest and that the corporation should \\"mount a strategic retreat\\". The BBC's Huw Edwards posted on Facebook that ITV should end its \\"creative handling of audience figures\\". A senior ITV News executive said to The Guardian that the BBC's attitude \\"is such [that] they are trying to smash and crush us\\" and that the corporation's \\"arrogance has got to such a level.\\" Nigel Dacre, editor of ITV News between 1995 and 2001, criticised the channel's use of \\"junction management\\", which involves the deliberate overrunning of the 9pm programme so that viewing figures for News at Ten are inflated. As an experiment to try and boost ITV's viewing figures at the 10pm slot, on Monday 27 February 2017, News at Ten moved to 10.30pm for eight consecutive weeks to make way for new entertainment programme The Nightly Show. The bulletin returned to its original 10pm timeslot from 24 April 2017. For a number of weeks in the run-up to the 2017 general election News at Ten was extended by 15 minutes, pushing the late regional news to 10:45pm. On 3 January 2018, a fire alarm forced ITV News staff to evacuate the building during the live broadcast of News at Ten. By the time crew members were allowed into the studio, the following programme was already on air. Theme music and opening sequence News at Ten is famed for its use of the Big Ben clockface, the headline \\"bongs\\" and the dramatic and familiar theme music, all retained and reworked into various guises across five decades. From 1967 to 1992, its opening and closing themes were straightforward excerpts from The Awakening, a piece of library music composed by Johnny Pearson. In 1992, composer Dave Hewson was appointed to produce a new arrangement of The Awakening. Since April 1995, Hewson has produced several rearrangements of the famous theme for all ITV News programmes. The story of the adaptation of The Awakening was featured in an official TV tie-in book, although incorrectly referring to the title music as Arabesque: The most memorable series of News at Ten title sequences launched in 1969: a camera pan across the Houses of Parliament and up the Westminster Clock Tower, followed by a sharp zoom into the tower clockface and the programme's name appearing on screen in time to the strident beats of The Awakening, with the headline \\"bongs\\" playing directly afterwards. (If the bulletin started significantly after 10pm, the \\"bongs\\" were dispensed with.) Further refreshes of the opening sequence continued to use this basic concept for several years afterwards, even after the introduction of computer-generated titles in 1988 which incorporated a virtual flyover nighttime London. As part of the programme's 1992 revamp, the familiar sequence was replaced by simple camera shots of the clock tower and ITN's headquarters. In 2008, News at Ten reworked its 1988 flyover sequence for its relaunch. The programme used the same opening titles as other ITV News bulletins from 2001 to 2004 and again from 2009 to 2016, all loosely based on elements established by News at Ten title sequences from its early days. In 2016, a new title sequence was introduced focusing more closely on the traditional image of the Big Ben clockface. Awards News at Ten won its first award from the National Viewers and Listeners Association in August 1968. The programme has been honoured over the years by the prestigious RTS Television Journalism Awards, including the News ‚Äì International coverage award in 1997 and the coveted News Programme of the Year in 1998, 2010 and 2014. The programme has received the BAFTA News Coverage award twice: in 2009 for their coverage of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake; and in 2010 for the 2010 Haiti earthquake. News at Ten has also won awards in the television/news programme categories at the International Emmy awards (2009) and the Plain English Awards (2010).

She was the mother of Lady Jane Grey, de facto Queen of England and Ireland from 10 July until 19 July 1553,Williamson, David (2010). Kings & Queens. National Portrait Gallery Publications. p. 95. as well as Lady Katherine Grey and Lady Mary Grey. Early life and first marriage Frances Brandon was born on 16 July 1517 in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, and spent her childhood in the care of her mother. Although her father, the Duke of Suffolk, had obtained a declaration of nullity regarding his earlier marriage to Margaret Neville (the widow of John Mortimer) on the ground of consanguinity, in 1528 he secured a bull from Pope Clement VII assuring the legitimacy of his marriage with Mary Tudor, and therefore the legitimacy of his daughter Frances.O'Day, Rosemary. The Routledge Companion to the Tudor Age, Routledge, 2012 Frances was close to her aunt Catherine of Aragon, first wife of her uncle King Henry VIII, and was a childhood friend of her first cousin, the future Queen Mary I. In 1533 Frances married Henry Grey, Marquess of Dorset. The marriage took place at Suffolk Place, a mansion which belonged to her parents on the west side of Borough High Street in Southwark. Her first two pregnancies resulted in the births of a son and daughter who both died young. These were followed by three surviving daughters: * Lady Jane Grey (12 October? 1537 ‚Äì 12 February 1554). * Lady Katherine Grey (25 August 1540 ‚Äì 26 January 1568) - married Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford. * Lady Mary Grey (1545 ‚Äì 20 April 1578) - married 16 July 1565 Thomas Keyes. Frances is considered to have been a strong and energetic woman. Her residence at Bradgate was a minor palace in Tudor style. After the death of her two brothers, the title Duke of Suffolk reverted to the crown, and was granted to her husband as a new creation. She saw to it that her daughters were well educated. Around 1541 Bishop John Aylmer was made chaplain to the duke, and tutor of Greek to Frances's daughter, Lady Jane Grey.Mendle, Michael. Dangerous Positions; Mixed Government, the Estates of the Realm, and the Making of the \\"Answer to the xix propositions, University of Alabama Press, 1985. p. 61 At court As the niece of Henry VIII, Frances was frequently at court. It was through her friendship with Katherine Parr that Frances's daughter Jane secured a place in the queen's household. There, Jane came into contact with Henry VIII's son and future successor, Edward. Henry VIII died on 28 January 1547, and Edward VI succeeded to the throne. Jane followed Katherine Parr to her new residence and was soon established as a member of the inner circle of the nine year old king. Frances was third-in-line to the English throne, following Edward's half-sisters Mary (later Queen Mary I) and Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth I), because Henry VIII's elder sister Margaret Tudor's descendants had been removed from the succession. This took place under the terms of the Will of King Henry VIII which laid out the succession to the throne. Katherine Parr then married Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley and Lord High Admiral. Lady Jane followed her to her new household. Frances, her husband, and other members of the aristocracy saw Jane as a possible wife for the young King. Katherine Parr died on 5 September 1548. Jane returned home. Seymour, on the other hand, pressed the Suffolks with demands that he held Jane's wardship and she should be returned to his household. Jane returned to Seymour's household and moved into Katherine Parr's apartments. Seymour still planned to convince Edward VI to marry Jane, but the King had become distrustful of his two uncles. An increasingly desperate Seymour invaded the King's bedchamber in an attempt to abduct him, and shot Edward's beloved dog when the animal tried to protect its master. Not long after Seymour was tried for treason and executed on 10 March 1549. The Suffolks convinced the Privy Council of their innocence in Seymour's scheme. Jane was again recalled home. The Duke and Duchess lost hope of marrying her to the King, who was sickly and thought likely not to live. For a time it is claimed they contemplated marrying her to Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, son of the Lord Protector and Anne Stanhope. However, the Lord Protector fell from power and was replaced by John Dudley. In May 1553 Guildford Dudley, the second youngest son of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and de facto regent during the young Edward VI's minority, married Frances's daughter Jane. Her daughter Katherine was married to Henry Herbert, the son and heir of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke at Durham House. Dudley's daughter Katherine, was promised to Henry Hastings, heir of the Earl of Huntingdon.Loades, David (1996): John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland 1504‚Äì1553.

March 1997 It has been claimed since the early 18th century that Lady Jane was brutally beaten and whipped into submission by the Duchess. However, there is no historic evidence for it. Lord Guildford was, as a fourth son, not the greatest match for an eldest daughter of royal descent, and William Cecil, another close friend of the Suffolks, claimed the match was brokered by Katherine Parr's brother and his second wife.Leanda de Lisle: The Sisters who would be Queen, p. 98 According to Cecil, they promoted the match to Northumberland who responded rather enthusiastically. The Suffolks did not favour the match much, since it would have meant passing the crown out of their family to Northumberland's. However, since Northumberland claimed to have the King's support in the matter, they finally gave in. The only historic proof of some family quarrel concerning the marriage is written down by Commendone as \\"the first-born daughter of the Duke of Suffolk, Jane by name, who although strongly deprecating the marriage, was compelled to submit by the insistence of her mother and the threats of her father\\".De Lisle, p. 329 By June 1553, Edward VI was seriously ill. The succession of his Catholic half-sister Mary would compromise the English Reformation. Edward opposed Mary's succession, not only on religious grounds but also on those of legitimacy and male inheritance, which also applied to Elizabeth.Starkey, David (2001), Elizabeth. Apprenticeship, London: Vintage, 2001, , pp. 112‚Äì113 He drafted a document in which he undertook to change the succession, as had his father. Edward passed over the claims of his half-sisters and settled the Crown on his cousin Jane Grey. In doing so he also passed over Frances who otherwise would have been the heir presumptive. It is not clear to what extent Northumberland may have influenced the king's plan, but he supported it. Frances and especially her husband were at first outraged, but eventually, after a private audience with the King, she had to renounce her own rights to the throne in favour of Jane.De Lisle, p. 104 The arms of Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk Frances and her husband approved the plans for the succession. Queen's mother Edward VI died on 6 July 1553. Lady Jane was declared queen on 10 July. The Duchess joined her for the proclamation and during her stay in the Tower. She had been fetched when Northumberland realised Jane's confusion and overwhelming feelings, and she managed to calm her daughter down. Since she had seen the King himself and spoken to him about the succession, she could convince Jane that she was the rightful queen and heir.De Lisle, p. 110 Their success was short-lived. Jane was deposed by armed support in favour of Mary I on 19 July 1553. The Duke of Suffolk was arrested, but released days later thanks to the Duchess' intervention. The moment she heard of her husband's arrest, she rode over to Mary in the middle of the night to plead for her family. Despite all odds, not only did the Duchess manage to be received by the Queen, but also could secure him a pardon by placing all the blame on Northumberland. While in his household, Lady Jane had fallen sick of food poisoning and had suspected Northumberland's family.Leanda de Lisle, p. 105 The Duchess now used her daughter's suspicions and her husband's sickness to accuse Northumberland of having tried to kill her family.De Lisle, p. 126 Therefore, Mary was willing to pardon the Duke of Suffolk. She intended to pardon Jane once her coronation was complete, sparing the 16-year-old's life. However, Wyatt the younger declared a revolt against Mary on 25 January 1554. The Duke of Suffolk joined the rebellion, but was captured by Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon. The revolt had failed by February. The plot ringleaders had wished to supplant Mary with her half-sister Elizabeth, although Elizabeth played no part in the matter. After the attempt to put Jane on the throne Frances was confined in the Tower of London for a time. Jane was now becoming too dangerous for Mary and was beheaded on 12 February 1554 with her husband. Jane's father was convicted of high treason and was executed eleven days later on 23 February 1554. With two young daughters barely in their teens and her husband a convicted traitor, the Duchess faced ruin. As a wife, she held no possessions in her own right. All her husband's possessions would return to the Crown, as usual for traitors' property. She managed to plead with the Queen to show mercy, which meant at least she and her daughters had the chance of rehabilitation. The Queen's forgiveness meant some of Suffolk's property would remain with his family, or at least could be granted back at some later time.De Lisle, p. 157 Second marriage and death Frances lived in poverty during the reign of Mary I. Mary I made a point of placing her by her side, favoured but kept under the observation of the queen. She was still regarded with some suspicion and in April 1555 the Spanish ambassador, Simon Renard wrote of a possible match between Frances and Edward Courtenay, a Plantagenet descendant.Calendar State Papers Spain, vol. 13 (1954), no. 177 Once again, their children would have had a claim to the throne, but Courtenay was reluctant, and Frances escaped the marriage by another, much safer match. She married her Master of the Horse, Adrian Stokes. It was a safe marriage for her, since any children from it would be considered too low-born to compete for the throne. Her childhood friend and stepmother Katherine Willoughby had married her gentleman usher, so Frances moved on familiar ground. She and Stokes married in 1555.Eric Ives: Lady Jane Grey: A Tudor Mystery. Wiley- Blackwell 2009; p 38; Three children were born to the couple: *Elizabeth Stokes (20 November 1554), stillborn. *Elizabeth Stokes (16 July 1555 ‚Äì 7 February 1556), died in infancy. *A son (December, 1556), stillborn. Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk died on 20 November 1559. She was buried at Westminster Abbey at the expense of Elizabeth. Her daughter Katherine acted as chief mourner. Four years after her death, her husband crowned the grave with Frances' effigy which still remains. The inscription on her grave reads in Latin: ::Nor grace, nor splendour, nor a royal name, ::Nor widespread fame can aught avail; ::All, all have vanished here. ::True worth alone Survives the funeral pyre and silent tomb'De Lisle, p. 197 Reputation Frances Grey's posthumous reputation for being insensitive or cruel is largely based on Roger Ascham's account of a statement of her daughter Jane: From this passage it was ‚Äì and still is ‚Äì deduced that Frances and Henry Grey had mistreated their daughter. However, Ascham wrote these words years after the actual meeting, and to promote the idea that children learned well under a kind tutor. Also, his view might have been influenced by the later events concerning the Greys. The letter he wrote to Jane just a few months after the visit speaks admiringly of her parents and praises both Jane's and their virtues.De Lisle, p. 17 James Haddon, chaplain of the Greys, told his acquaintance Michel Angelo Florio how Jane was following in her parents' footsteps concerning piety, and how close she was to her mother Frances.De Lisle, p. 159 Jane's age certainly played a role in her words. At the age of fourteen and highly aware of her brightness and people's admiration of it, it couldn't sit well with Jane to still have to submit to her parents' authority. The Tudor times demanded, of all virtues, obedience, and Jane was spirited enough to even make her beloved teacher Aylmer agree with her parents that it was necessary to \\"provide bridles for restive horses.\\"De Lisle, p. 70 The alleged abuse of her daughter as well as her role in the machinations to bring Jane the crown are the subject of historical debate. While Jane was already with her husband Guildford Dudley, under the supervision of his parents, she heard news that Edward VI was changing his will to exclude her mother from the succession and name Jane as his heir instead. Jane, startled by the news, asked her mother- in-law permission to visit her mother, yet was met with refusal. Ignoring her, Jane sneaked out of the house and went back home. The evil mother from the myth was accused of having beaten Jane into submission to marry Guildford Dudley and certainly would not have taken kindly to her daughter running away from her husband. However, if Frances' claim of having opposed the match from the beginning on is true, Jane fleeing to her makes perfect sense. In fact, Frances was noted for her hospitality and generosity. When her brother-in- law's children Thomas, Margaret and Francis Willoughby were orphaned, the Greys took them under their wings. Thomas soon joined Henry and Charles Brandon at college and his siblings went to live with their uncle George Medley. However, during the Wyatt rebellion, Medley was imprisoned and taken to the Tower. At the time he was released, the imprisonment had taken its toll on him and he couldn't take care of the children any longer. Frances had already lost her eldest daughter, her husband and a considerable part of her lands. Nevertheless, she once more resumed care of Francis and Margaret Willoughby, organized a place in school for the boy and took the girl to court, along with herself and her surviving daughters.De Lisle, p. 162 Their elder brother was placed as ward under a Councillor's care. Since Thomas was his father's heir, the councillor had control over the Willoughby fortune during Thomas' minority. As biographer Leanda de Lisle writes: AncestryDramatic representation Frances, Duchess of Suffolk was portrayed by Sara Kestelman in the 1986 film Lady Jane and by Julia James in a 1956 episode of the BBC's Sunday Night Theatre.IMDb profile of Frances, Duchess of Suffolk References Category:1517 births Category:1559 deaths Category:People from Hatfield, Hertfordshire Category:Burials at Westminster Abbey Category:English duchesses by marriage Category:Daughters of English dukes Category:16th- century English nobility Category:16th-century English women Frances Frances ","title":"Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk"},{"id":"1886592","text":"Islamic Movement of Afghanistan (, Harakat-e Islami-yi Afghanistan) is a political party and former faction of the Afghan Northern Alliance (United Front) in Afghanistan. The movement is registered as a political party with the Ministry of Justice.Ministry of Justice - Islamic Republic of Afghanistan From its foundation to 2005, the movement was led by Ayatollah Muhammad Asif Muhsini. The movement emerged in 1978. Initially the movement was inspired by the Islamic revolutionary ideas of Ali Shari'ati, but over time this influence waned. During the 1980s, the movement was part of the 'Tehran Eight', an alliance of Shia mujahedin factions supported by Iran that fought against the PDPA government and Soviet troops. The movement joined the Hezb-e Wahdat, which was intended as a united Shia political front, but soon bolted out of it. During the Taliban years, it joined the 'Northern Alliance'. After the US occupation of Afghanistan, the movement was divided into two. A dissident sector broke away, and formed the People's Islamic Movement of Afghanistan. The dissidents, led by Seyyed Hossein Anwari, were based among the militia forces of the movement and had a more secular political outlook.

He worked as a civil servant, founded the political blog Left Foot Forward, was an associate director of the think-tank Institute for Public Policy Research, specialising in climate change, energy and transport, and is currently Chief Operating Officer of Clearly, a charity in the eye care sector. In the lead up to 2016's referendum on European Union membership, he was the executive director of Britain Stronger in Europe, the all-party umbrella organisation that unsuccessfully fought for the United Kingdom to remain a member of the European Union.  Early life and education  Straw was born in Lambeth, London in 1980. His parents are Alice Perkins and Jack Straw. He attended the comprehensive Pimlico School. In January 1998, aged 17, he was caught trying to sell ¬£10 of cannabis, after a friend was paid ¬£2,000 by the Daily Mirror to introduce him to an undercover reporter posing as an acquaintance. The story caused some embarrassment for his father, who was Home Secretary at the time, both for his opposition to legalising cannabis and his stance on parents taking responsibility for the poor behaviour or criminality of their children. He went to Oxford University where he read Politics, Philosophy and Economics (PPE) and was elected President of the Junior Common Room of New College and the Oxford University Student Union in 2001. In 2001, he and several other OUSU campaigners protested against tuition fees on the steps of Oxford's Bodleian Library by throwing off most of their clothes to reveal gold-painted torsos. After Oxford, he read for a master's degree in public administration as a Fulbright Scholar at Columbia University.  Policy research and journalism  Straw worked for four years as an adviser on enterprise and growth issues, in HM Treasury under Gordon Brown. In 2009, he founded the political blog Left Foot Forward, which was set up professionally as a counter to right wing media in the United Kingdom, and was sponsored by a variety of individuals and institutions, including Peter Kellner, Patrick Carter and the unions Connect and Unite. The blog grew to have about forty writers; Straw left it in 2010 to join the Institute for Public Policy Research.  Political ambitions  The \\"Nutters\\" performing in Bacup at Easter in 2014 In 2004, Straw became governor of Henry Fawcett Primary School in Kennington, which he had attended as a child. He moved to the US in 2007 but his name was not taken off the official register. In 2009, Straw was one of twelve governors removed by Lambeth Council amid concerns over financial management and poor teaching at the school. His retention on the list of governors was criticised at the time and it was suggested he was retained for his \\"high-profile name\\". Straw was the parliamentary candidate for the Labour Party, for the constituency of Rossendale and Darwen in the 2015 general election, but lost to the Conservative incumbent Jake Berry. Straw was one of 15 Labour candidates each given financial support of ¬£10,000 by Lord Oakeshott the former Liberal Democrat in January 2015. In April 2014, he posed with a local folk-dancing troupe, the Britannia Coconut Dancers. This generated some controversy, because of their use of blackface makeup, which Straw defended as a traditional custom linked to the coal mining heritage of the area. Along with Euan Blair (son of former British prime minister Tony Blair), Stephen Kinnock (son of former Labour Leader Neil Kinnock), and Joe Dromey (son of Labour MPs Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey), Straw has been criticised for being a 'Red Prince', which refers to the son of a Labour politician who goes into politics. It is suggested that this nepotism allows them better access to educational, employment and political opportunities. Of the four, only Kinnock has become an MP. Straw was the executive director of Britain Stronger in Europe, the group that campaigned for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union, ahead of the 2016 referendum. He was awarded a CBE in outgoing Prime Minister David Cameron's controversial resignation honours in 2016. He stated that he had accepted the award in order to take his wife to Buckingham Palace and \\"as something to remember the hard work that I and others put into the campaign\\".  Personal life  Straw lives in Clapham, London. He is married to Claire Straw (n√©e Howard), an American, with whom he has two sons, Matthew, born in 2013, and Samuel, born in 2016.

Early life Born in Sydney, Mortlock began playing rugby with Lindfield Juniors. Mortlock was educated at The King's School in Parramatta Sydney. He represented Gordon Juniors at Colt level and still represents Gordon at club level today. He represented Australia at Under 19 and Under 21 level before pursuing a professional career with the Brumbies. Professional career Brumbies Brumbies career In 1998, Mortlock joined the ACT Brumbies. He was part of the Brumbies Super Rugby championships team in 2001. In 2004 he succeeded George Gregan as ACT Brumbies Captain and played every game that season except the final due to injury and thus was unable to lead the team to claim the Super 12 title that year. Wallabies career Then Wallaby coach Rod McQueen plucked Mortlock out of club rugby at the young age of 20 to tour Argentina with the Wallabies in 1997. In 2000, he made his Test debut against Argentina. 2000 was a landmark year for Mortlock ‚Äì he became the fastest Australian to reach 50 and 100 Test points, he scored the most points and highest number of penalties [16] by any Australian in his first five Tests and created history by becoming the first Australian to score 20 points or more in four consecutive Tests. With the Wallaby team, Mortlock was instrumental in the famous Bledisloe and Tri-Nation Series' Victories of 2000. He scored a sideline penalty goal in 2000 against South Africa in Durban to win Australia's first Tri Nations crown. Mortlock won man-of-the-match and had an 80-metre intercept try at then-Telstra Stadium to help knock the All Blacks out of the 2003 Rugby World Cup in the semi-final. In 2006, Mortlock became the 73rd player to captain the Wallabies. In 2007, Mortlock was made co-captain with Phil Waugh. In February 2008, Mortlock announced that he hoped to continue playing with the Wallabies until at least the end of 2010. Australian Rugby Union CEO John O'Neill endorsed this decision saying that Mortlock is a \\"real captain courageous\\" and an \\"inspirational leader\\". He missed Wallabies' selection in October 2010. A press release from the Rebels said Mortlock was recuperating after surgery, and hoped to be \\"training in full by December.\\" Melbourne Rebels The Melbourne Rebels signed Mortlock in March 2010, to a three-year deal for an undisclosed amount. Mortlock was declared the Rebels inaugural Captain on 2 February 2011, with former Wales international Gareth Delve as Vice-Captain.

His father became a wealthy merchant, during the early years of St. Louis. After 1796, Charles was raised in the large stone house purchased by his father in St. Louis, near the Mississippi River. Portrait of Charles Gratiot Military career President Thomas Jefferson personally appointed him (and 3 other young Missouri men) as a United States Military Academy cadet in July 1804. The U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, was the first school of engineering in the United States and graduated its first class in 1802. Gratiot was a member of the Class of 1806, the fourth graduating class, and was commissioned in the Corps of Engineers. He became a captain in 1808 and assisted Alexander Macomb in constructing fortifications in Charleston, South Carolina. He returned to his alma mater in 1810 to be commander of the Army garrison at West Point during 1810‚Äì1811. As General William Henry Harrison's Chief Engineer in the War of 1812, he distinguished himself by planning and building Fort Meigs in 1813.

Description Virginia Reels used a side friction-like track resembling a trench. The tubs, which had inward-facing seats built around the perimeter, spun freely on their chassis as they traveled around the track. Instead of big hills or banks, Virginia Reels featured many unbanked turns and switchbacks to spin their tubs as much as possible. Near the end of the ride were a few helices and a relatively steep drop into a tunnel. History The Virginia Reel was designed by Henry Elmer Riehl, who named the ride after his daughter, Luna Virginia Riehl. The first Virginia Reel was built in 1908 at Coney Island's Luna Park, where Henry Riehl was superintendent. The last full- sized Virginia Reel was located at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in England until it closed in 1982. The modern equivalent is the Spinning Wild Mouse roller coaster.

After almost a whole century of political instability and many civil wars, the aim of the Restoration was to create a new political system, which ensured stability by the practice of turnismo. This was the deliberate rotation of the Liberal and Conservative parties in the government, so no sector of the bourgeoisie felt isolated, while all other parties were excluded from the system. This was achieved by electoral fraud. Opposition to the system came from republicans, socialists, anarchists, Basque and Catalan nationalists, and Carlists. Alfonso XII and the Regency of Maria Christina (1874‚Äì1898) Portrait of Alfonso XII The pronunciamiento by Mart√≠nez Campos established Alfonso XII as king, marking the end of the First Spanish Republic. After this, the Constitution of 1876 was written and enforced during the whole restoration. This constitution established Spain as a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature (Cortes Generales), consisting of an upper house (Senate), and a lower house (Congress of Deputies). This constitution gave the King the power to name Senators and to revoke laws if he wanted to, and he was also given the title of Commander-in- chief of the army. These years were marked by economic prosperity. Ever since the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Spain's economy had fallen even further behind those of other European countries. During these years the modernization of the country took place on a large scale. On most fronts domestic production was increased, supported by extreme protectionist measures. The two parties alternated in the government in a controlled process known as el turno pac√≠fico; the Liberal Party was led by Sagasta and the Conservative Party by Canovas del Castillo. The caciques, powerful local figures, were used to manipulate election results, and as a result resentment of the system slowly built up over time and important nationalist movements in Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, as well as unions, started to form. Reign of Alfonso XIII and crisis of the system (1898‚Äì1923) Alfonso XIII In 1898, Spain lost its last major overseas colonies (Cuba, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines) in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The rapid collapse was perceived as a disaster in Spain, undermining the credibility of both the government and its associated ideologies and almost leading to a military coup d'√©tat led by Camilo Polavieja. This was the start of the system's decline, giving energy to all manner of conflicting opposition movements at a local and national level.Earl Ray Beck, Time of Triumph & Sorrow: Spanish Politics during the Reign of Alfonso XII, 1874-1885 (1979) The failed attempts to conquer Morocco (Melilla War) caused great discontent at home and ended in a revolt in Barcelona, known as the Semana Tragica, in which the lower classes of Barcelona, backed by the anarchists, communists, and republicans, revolted against what they considered the unjust methods for recruiting soldiers. The government declared a state of war and sent the army to crush the revolt, causing over a hundred deaths and the execution of Francisco Ferrer. The socialist Uni√≥n General de Trabajadores (UGT) and the anarchist Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) decided to initiate a general strike across the country, but it failed because the unions could only mobilize urban workers. The problems in Morocco worsened as an army of natives attacked the Spanish army. They achieved surprise and, due to the skill of the Moroccan chieftain, Abd-Al-Krim, virtually annihilated the Spanish army, advancing almost as far as Melilla in the Battle of Annual. This Spanish defeat was due to improper planning and was blamed on the top military officers, causing great discontent among the military, who felt misunderstood, because they had been directed to advance into the interior without adequate resources to occupy the difficult territory. Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923‚Äì1930) The military discontent, the fear of anarchist terrorism or a proletarian revolution, and the rise of nationalist movements ultimately caused great agitation amongst the civilians and the military. On 13 September 1923, Miguel Primo de Rivera, Captain General of Catalonia, orchestrated a coup d'√©tat, after issuing a manifesto blaming the problems of Spain on the parliamentary system. Alfonso XIII backed the General and named him Prime Minister. Primo de Rivera proceeded to suspend the Constitution and assume absolute powers as a dictator. He created the Uni√≥n Patri√≥tica Espa√±ola, which was meant to be the sole legal party, abolishing all other parties. During this time, he greatly increased government spending on business and public services, which caused his government to go bankrupt. He lost the support of the military and faced serious health problems. Opposition to his regime was so great that Alfonso XIII stopped supporting him and forced him to resign in January 1930.Shlomo Ben-Ami, \\"The Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera: A Political Reassessment,\\" Journal of Contemporary History, Jan 1977, Vol. 12 Issue 1, pp 65‚Äì84 Final year (1930‚Äì1931) Alfonso XIII, in an attempt to return gradually to the previous system and restore his prestige, called on General D√°maso Berenguer to form a government. This failed utterly, as the King was considered a supporter of the dictatorship, and more and more political forces called for the establishment of a republic. Berenguer resigned and the King gave the government to Admiral Juan Bautista Aznar. Aznar called for local elections on 12 April 1931 in order to satisfy the democrats and republicans, to replace the dictatorship's local governments and to gradually re-introduce the restoration. Although the monarchists had not lost all their support, the republican and socialist parties won some significant victories in major cities. Street riots ensued, calling for the removal of the monarchy. The army declared that they would not defend the King and on 14 April he fled Spain. The Second Spanish Republic was immediately established under a provisional government led by Niceto Alcal√°-Zamora. ReferencesSources *Barton, Simon.

Black drink is a name for several kinds of ritual beverages brewed by Native Americans in the Southeastern United States. Traditional ceremonial people of the Yuchi, Caddo, Chickasaw, Cherokee, Choctaw, Muscogee and some other Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands use the black drink in purification ceremonies. It was occasionally known as white drink because of the association of the color white with peace leaders in some Native cultures in the Southeast. The preparation and protocols vary between tribes and ceremonial grounds; a prominent ingredient is the roasted leaves and stems of Ilex vomitoria (commonly known as yaupon holly), a plant native to the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Black drink also usually contains emetic herbs. Preparation Preparing Black Drink, engraving by Joseph-Fran√ßois Lafitau, 1723 Yaupon holly According to the ethnohistorical record, the yaupon leaves and branches used for the black drink were traditionally picked as close to the time of its planned consumption as possible. After picking, historically they were lightly parched in a ceramic container over fire. The roasting increases the solubility in water of the caffeine, which is the same reason coffee beans are roasted. After browning, they were boiled in large containers of water until the liquid reached a dark brown or black color, giving it its name. The liquid was then strained into containers to cool, until it was cool enough to not scald the skin, and drunk while still hot. Because caffeine is 30 times more soluble in boiling water than room temperature water, this heightened its effect. It was then consumed in a ritual manner. Its physiological effects are believed to be mainly those of massive doses of caffeine. Three to six cups of strong coffee is equal to 0.5 to 1.0 grams of caffeine; the black drink could have delivered at least this much and possibly up to 3.0 to 6.0 grams of caffeine. Owen gives the caffeine content of coffee as between 1.01 and 1.42 percent Owen, Daiel, 2006. Coffee and Cafeine FAQ: How much caffeine there is in X coffee? Access at http://coffeefaq.com/site/node/23 In comparison, Ilex vomitoria leaves contain 0.0038 to 0.2288 percent caffeine by weight according to experiments performed by Adam Edwards in 2002.Edwards, Adam, 2002. morton/pdfs/a_edwards.pdf \\"Variation of caffeine and related alkaloids in Ilex vomitoria Ait. (Yaupon holly): A model of intraspecific alkaloid variation.\\" Society for Economic Botany Julia F. Morton Award. Similar methods of production were adopted by European colonists for the production of a drink that often shared the same names with Native names for the black drink but used for different, secular purposes. While the general method of production is known, not all details of the preparation and ceremonial usage of the black drink are. The source of the emetic effect of black drink is not known and has been speculated upon by historians, archaeologists, and botanists. Some professionals believe it to be caused by the addition of poisonous button snakeroot. Contemporary preparation and usage of the black drink by Native Americans is less well documented. Online recipes for the black drink have been criticized by some Native Americans as potentially dangerous and potentially poisonous due to those recipes leaving out key steps. The berries of the yaupon holly are poisonous. Kidney failure is one possible outcome of consuming beverages containing holly leaves. Adam Edwards and Bradley Bennett tested stems, roots, and leaves of the yaupon. They found that the only possible toxic substance was theobromine, an alkaloid, but the amounts of the chemical were so low that a single gram of cocoa contained over 2,255 times more theobromine than yaupon. Archaeological accounts Map of the geographical extent of black drink use by Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands, prior to 19th century Indian Removal Archaeologists have demonstrated the use of various kinds of black drink among Native American groups stretching back far into antiquity, possibly dating to Late Archaic times. During the Hopewell period, the shell cups known from later black drink rituals become common in high-status burials along with mortuary pottery and engraved stone and copper tablets. The significance of the shell cups may indicate the beginning of black drink ceremonialism. The fact that both the shells and the yaupon holly come from the same geographical location may indicate they were traded together in the Hopewell Interaction Sphere. The appearance of shell cups can be used as a virtual marker for the advent of Hopewell Culture in many instances. During the Mississippian culture period, the presence of items associated with the black drink ceremony had spread over most of the south, with many hundreds of examples from Etowah, Spiro, Moundville and Hiwassee Island. Black drink at Cahokia woodhenge motif Archaeologists working at Cahokia, the largest Mississippian culture settlement located near the modern city of St. Louis, found distinctive and relatively rare pottery beakers dating from 1050 to 1250 CE. The beakers are small round pots with a handle on one side and a tiny lip on the opposing side. The surfaces of the unfired vessels was incised with motifs representing water and the underworld and resemble the whelk shells known to have been used for the consumption of the beverage during historic times. The inside of the vessels were found to be coated with a plant residue, which when tested was found to contain theobromine, caffeine and ursolic acid in the right proportions to have come from the Ilex vomitoria. The presence of the black drink in the Greater Cahokia area at this early date pushes back the definitive use of the black drink by several centuries. The presence of the black drink hundreds of miles outside of its natural range on the East and Gulf coasts is evidence of a substantial trade network with the southeast, a trade that also involved sharks teeth and whelk shells. Shell cups Engraved conch shell cup from Spiro Mounds In historic accounts from the 16th and 17th century, the black drink is usually imbibed in rituals using a cup made of marine shell. Three main species of marine shells have been identified as being used as cups for the black drink, lightning whelk, emperor helmet, and the horse conch. The most common was the lightning whelk, which has a left-handed or sinistral spiral. The left-handed spiral may have held religious significance because of its association with dance and ritual. The center columnella, which runs longitudinally down the shell, would be removed, and the rough edges sanded down to make a dipper-like cup. The columnella would then be used as a pendant, a motif that shows up frequently in Southeastern Ceremonial Complex designs. In the archaeological record columnella pendants are usually found in conjunction with bi-lobed arrows, stone maces, earspools, and necklace beads (all of which are motifs identified with the falcon dancer/warrior/chunkey player mythological figure). Artifacts made from these marine shells have been found as far north as Wisconsin and as far west as Oklahoma. Several examples of cups from Moundville and Spiro have been found to have rings of black residue in the bottoms, suggesting they were used for black drink rituals. Many examples of shell cups found in Mississippian culture mounds are engraved with S.E.C.C. imagery. A few examples portray what is theorized to be black drink rituals, including what some anthropologists have interpreted as vomit issuing from the mouths of mythological beings. Archaeological evidence for use in pre-Hispanic US Southwest and Mexican Northwest Pottery samples recovered from sites in modern Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico have tested positive for the ratio of methylxanthines associated with those produced by Ilex vomitoria. The same study also identified methylxanthines ratios associated with Theobroma cacao. Neither plants are native to the areas from which the pottery samples were recovered, which suggests trading between areas where those plants are native. The chemical analysis also suggests a possible increase in drinks prepared from cacao after the year 1200, and a decrease in the use of drinks prepared from Ilex vomitoria. Freshwater shells from Texas and Arkansas have been recovered from Pueblo Bonito, which have been used as possible evidence for the trade of Ilex vomitoria from the east. There are also some stands of Ilex vomitoria in Mesoamerica, so the exact origins of the Ilex vomitoria used to prepare the drinks is currently unknown. Historical accounts A number of tribes across the Southeastern United States use a form of the black drink in their ceremonies. Muscogee Creeks, Cherokees, Choctaws, Ais, Guale, Chickasaws, Chitimacha, Timucua and others are documented users of a type of black drink. Although rituals vary amongst the different tribes, there are some common traits among them. Black drink is most commonly drunk by men, who also prepare it, but there are some accounts of its preparation and use by women among some groups. Removal of tribes to areas outside the natural range of Ilex vomitoria has been partially responsible for a decline in the preparation of the black drink among present Native Americans. Ais In 1696, Jonathan Dickinson witnessed the use of a beverage brewed from the Yaupon Holly among the Ais of Florida. Dickinson later learned that the Spanish called the plant casseena. The Ais parched the leaves in a pot, and then boiled them. The resulting liquid was then transferred to a large bowl using a gourd that had a long neck with a small hole at the top, and a hole in the side. On the occasion Dickinson witnessed, he estimated that there were nearly three gallons of the beverage in the bowl. After the liquid had cooled, the chief was presented with a conch-shell of the beverage. The chief threw part of it on the ground as a blessing and drank the rest. The chief's associates were then served in turn. Lower status men, women, and children were not allowed to touch or taste the beverage. The chief and his associates sat drinking this brew, smoking and talking for most of the day. In the evening, the bowl that had held the beverage was covered with a skin to make a drum. The Ais, accompanied by the drum and some rattles, sang and danced until the middle of the night. Cherokee Cherokee black drink is taken for purification at several traditional ceremonies. Made with emetics, the complete recipe is not shared with the public. The black drink induces vomiting for purification purposes. Other ritual medicinal beverages are also used in the ceremonies. Ilex vomitoria was not native to the traditional area controlled by the Cherokee before removal, but it was brought in to the area through trade and then transplanted. Muscogean peoples Among the Muscogee the black drink is called √°ssi. In the ceremonies of some cultures that use the drink, after its preparation it is passed out to the highest- status person first, then the next highest status, and so forth. During each person's turn to drink, ritual songs may be sung. Its use was traditionally limited to only adult men. The ritual name Asi Yahola or Black Drink Singer is corrupted into English as Osceola). Timucua 16th-century engraving by Jacques le Moyne of a Timucua ceremony involving the black drink Among the Timucua, a type of black drink was called cacina by the Spanish. The preparation and consumption of the drink were strictly limited to the community council house. Women (other than an occasional female chief) were normally excluded from the council house except for activities such as dances, but did prepare the cacina. In 1678 a bedridden cacica (a female chief) was given permission to brew and consume cacina in her house, on the condition that no one else could be present while she did so. Cassina or yaupon tea After European contact with tribes in what is today the Southeastern United States, colonists began using the charred leaves of the yaupon holly to make a tea similar to the black drink, but without the ritual vomiting of it. Its use by colonists in Spanish Florida is documented as far back as 1615. An account from that year describes Spaniards as experiencing symptoms that would now be described as caffeine dependence due to daily consumption of what they called cacina or t√© del indio. The use of Ilex vomitoria by colonists for tea making and for medicinal uses in the Carolinas is documented by the early eighteenth century. In the English-speaking colonies, it was known variously as cassina, yaupon tea, Indian tea, Carolina tea, and Appalachian tea. It was commonly believed to be and used as a diuretic. By the late 1700s, yaupon tea was described as being more commonly used in North Carolina at breakfast than tea made with Camellia sinensis. In addition to using it on their own, Spanish and British colonist often drank black drink when engaging in discussions and treaties with Natives. Its preparation by British and Spanish colonists was nearly identical to the method of preparation used by their Native neighbors. Its use by colonists in French Louisiana is speculated to have occurred, but lacks documentation other than one source describing its medicinal uses from 1716. During the Civil War, yaupon tea was used as a substitute for coffee and tea throughout the South. Yaupon continued to be used in North Carolina for medicinal purposes and as a common drink until the late 1890s. At that point, its use was stigmatized because of its natural abundance as being a habit associated with rural poor people. By 1928 it was described as only being in common use on Knotts Island, North Carolina. During the Interwar period the United States Department of Agriculture investigated the use of cassina tea as a substitute for coffee and tea. There were also a few attempts at the commercialization of cassina tea during that same period. By 1973 it was believed that cassina tea was only being served at the Pony Island Restaurant on Ocracoke Island, North Carolina. In the early 2000s yaupon tea began witnessing a resurgence in its popularity, and can now be purchased online and at several historical sites related to Native Americans.

He developed the coal and iron industries across South Wales and built the Cardiff Docks. Bute's father, John, Lord Mount Stuart, died a few months after he was born and as a young child he was brought up first by his mother, the former Lady Elizabeth McDougall-Crichton, and later by his paternal grandfather, John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute. He travelled widely across Europe before attending Cambridge University. He contracted an eye condition and remained partially sighted for the rest of his life. Having inherited large estates across Britain, he married his first wife, Lady Maria North, in 1818, and together they lived a relatively secluded life in Mount Stuart House in Scotland, one of Bute's four seats. Bute was dour but industrious, with a flair for land management. He focused his daily routine around extensive correspondence with his estate managers, making biennial tours of his lands around the country. The couple did not conceive any children, and Maria died in 1841. Bute remarried four years later, to Lady Sophia Rawdon-Hastings, and she gave birth to Bute's only child, John, in 1847. Bute was a member of the House of Lords and controlled the votes of several members of the House of Commons. He was a political and religious conservative, a follower of the Duke of Wellington, but rarely took part in national debates unless his own commercial interests were involved. Early on, Bute realised the vast wealth that lay in the South Wales coalfields and set about commercially exploiting them through local ironmasters and colliers. He constructed the Cardiff Docks, a major project which, despite running heavily over budget, enabled further exports of iron and coal and magnified the value of his lands in Glamorganshire. When violence broke out in the Merthyr Rising of 1831, Bute led the government response from Cardiff Castle, despatching military forces, deploying spies and keeping Whitehall informed throughout. The contemporary press praised the marquess as \\"the creator of modern Cardiff\\", and on his death he left vast wealth to his son. Background and personal life Bute was the son of John, Lord Mount Stuart, and the former Lady Elizabeth McDouall-Crichton. His parents were both from wealthy, aristocratic backgrounds; his father was due to become the Marquess of Bute, with extensive landholdings in Scotland and in South Wales, and his mother was the sole heir to the Crichton estates, with over of land in Scotland. Bute's father died in a riding accident in February 1794, leaving Elizabeth to give birth to Bute's younger brother, Patrick Stuart, later that year. Dumfries House, Bute's first home Initially Bute was brought up at Dumfries House by his mother and grandmother, but following their deaths he passed into the care of his grandfather, the 1st Marquess of Bute, and travelled with him across England and Europe. His family considered him to be clever and he went to study at Christ's College in Cambridge in 1809. Over the next few years he visited the Mediterranean, Scandinavia and Russia, taking a keen interest in land economics. He developed an eye condition during this period and became partially blind, leaving him unable to travel without assistance or to tolerate bright lights, and finding it difficult to read or write. His maternal grandfather, Lord Dumfries, died in 1803, followed by his paternal grandfather in 1814, with Bute inheriting both sets of estates and adding Crichton to his surname after Lord Dumfries. As a consequence he held many hereditary titles and posts: in addition to being the Marquess of Bute, he was also the Earl of Windsor, Viscount Mountjoy, Baron Mount Stuart, Baron Cardiff, the Earl of Dumfries and Bute, the Viscount of Ayr and Kingarth, Baron Crichton, Lord Crichton of Sanquhar and Cumnock, and Lord Mount Stuart Cumra and Inchmarnock, and a Baronet of Nova Scotia. He was the Keeper of Rothsay Castle, the Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of Glamorgan, the Lord Lieutenant, the hereditary Sheriff and Coroner of Buteshire, and the High Steward of Banbury.; Bute had four major seats, Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute, Dumfries House in Ayrshire, Luton Hoo in Bedfordshire, and Cardiff Castle in South Wales, with his London townhouse, Bute House, on Campden Hill in Kensington. Bute preferred to live in Mount Stuart House; he disliked London and only spent a few weeks in Cardiff Castle each year. Twice each year he would travel from Mount Stuart House through Ayrshire to Edinburgh, down through northern England to London, and on to Cardiff and his South Wales estates. Bute's coat of arms Concerned about his growing blindness, and not enjoying the social life in London, Bute retired to his estates on the Isle of Bute for the next six years. While recovering, Bute married his first wife, Lady Maria North, in 1818. Maria was one of the three daughters of the 3rd Earl of Guilford, and a wealthy heiress. ¬£40,000 was settled on her at the time of her marriage and she was due to inherit a third of her father's extensive estates. Contemporaries considered Maria a kind and pleasant woman, but she was often unwell and the marriage proved childless. In 1820 his portrait was painted by Henry Raeburn, and published two years later as an engraving by William Ward.; In 1827 his father-in-law died and Maria inherited lands worth over ¬£110,000. The historian John Davies describes Bute as \\"dour, remote and overbearing on first acquaintance\\" but with a \\"sense of responsibility, considerable imagination and an enormous capacity for hard work\\". By the aristocratic standards of the day, Bute lived a reclusive lifestyle. As a result of his personality and poor eyesight, he did not enjoy hunting, shooting, or large social gatherings, nor did he like racehorses or gambling. His first wife's illnesses added to this sense of exclusion from wider aristocratic society. Compared to other landowners of the period, Bute was relatively philanthropic, giving away around seven to eight percent of his rental income from South Wales in charitable donations, for example. He was keen to fund local schools and to construct new churches, partially because in doing so he was able to discourage any moves towards Nonconformism and the disestablishment of the official Church. In 1841 Lady Maria died, and Bute blamed his excessive focus on the dock programme for exacerbating his wife's illness. As a result of the original marriage agreement, Bute continued to draw the incomes from his late wife's property for the remainder of his life, even though officially the estates would ultimately pass to Maria's sister, Lady Susan, on his own death. In November 1843, a fire swept through Luton Hoo House, destroying the interior; the house's historic library survived, however, and most of its famous collection of paintings were rescued from the blaze; it was subsequently sold off by Bute. From 1843, the London house was let out: first to the Lascelles family until 1856, then to the Duke of Rutland until 1888. Bute House was later acquired by Charles Weld-Blundell, who renamed it Blundell House: it was demolished 1912-1913. Bute was created a Knight of the Thistle in 1843 by Queen Victoria. In 1845 Bute fell from his horse and injured his eyes further in the accident, making it still harder for him to read and write. Bute remarried the same year, this time to Lady Sophia Rawdon-Hastings, the daughter of the Marquess of Hastings. Sophia was obsessive, hard to please and did not get on well with John's family, especially his brother. She soon became pregnant, but gave birth to a stillborn child; the couple's second child, whom they named John, was successfully born in 1847. Bute's relationship with his brother Patrick was often difficult. Their political views did not coincide, as Patrick was much more liberal than Bute and favoured political reform. Although Bute arranged for Patrick to become a Member of Parliament in 1818, in 1831 their differing views resulted in Bute removing him from Parliament. For many years, Patrick had good reason to expect that Bute would die childless, leaving him to inherit the family estates; after Bute's death, he disputed the occupancy of Cardiff Castle with Lady Sophia. Landowner and industrialist=Estate management Luton Hoo, Bute's residence in Bedfordshire, before the fire Bute was determined to develop his different estates and receive the best possible return from them. He was an active, ambitious manager, quick to generate new ideas for the properties, and spent the majority of his time managing his properties . Despite his poor eyesight, he wrote at least six letters to his managers each day. He had a detailed understanding of his various estates and businesses; he attempted to keep up with affairs in Glamorgan, for example, by reading the local Welsh newspapers from his house in Scotland and through exchanging letters with influential local figures. Bute recognised that his land holdings were too extended and disparate to be easily managed and attempted to rationalise them. He attempted to sell his Luton estates in the early 1820s but failed to obtain an adequate price; he successfully sold them in the early 1840s. Luton and Luton Hoo was finally sold in 1845, by then comprising around .; Unusually for an aristocrat of the period, Bute owned almost all of his lands fully, as an owner in fee simple, rather than having his rights diluted through arrangements with trustees. When he married in 1818, Bute placed his English and Wales estates into a trustee arrangement for any future children, but this agreement expired with Lady Maria's death in 1842; when he remarried in 1845 a similar trustee agreement was set up, although in this version the Glamorgan estates were administered separately from his other holdings in England and Wales. Bute continued to run his network of estates and estate managers personally, helped by Onesipherus Bruce, a barrister-agent and close friend. As early as 1815, Bute had his Glamorgan estates fully surveyed, which highlighted that the estates had been neglected for many years and were now in a poor condition. Edward Richards became the senior official in charge of the estates by 1824 and represented Bute on both estate and political affairs across the region. Despite this, Bute retained the final authority over even quite minor issues on the estates, including making decisions on the buttons to be used on local school uniforms or the reuse of a broken flag pole, for example, which could result in considerable delays as letters were sent between South Wales and Scotland. As the complexity of the Glamorgan estates grew, more officials were appointed to help manage the docks, farms and mineral interests, but these all reported separately to Bute, putting increasing pressure on the marquess. On the Isle of Bute, the marquess expanded his properties, purchasing land in Ascog, Kilmahalmag and Etterick Mill. Glamorganshire Dowlais Ironworks, one of the various enterprises with which Bute was involved Bute was closely involved in the developments across Glamorganshire during the first half of the 19th century. The region saw tremendous economic and social changes in a short period. The population almost trebled in the first forty years of the century and industrial outputs soared, with the output of pig iron increasing from 34,000 to 277,000 tons between 1796 and 1830.; Industry and mining replaced agriculture as the main sources of work. In driving forward and responding to these changes, Bute transformed his South Wales estate into a major industrial enterprise. Bute's land holdings in Glamorgan were spread out across the county and he took steps to consolidate them, selling around of some of the outlying properties in the west and investing heavily in buying of land around Cardiff between 1814 and 1826. The rising prices of land and the costs of the docks brought an end to this expansion. Estimating the profitability of the Glamorgan estates is challenging because of the way that the accounts were drawn up during the period, but estimates suggest that once land purchases and the dock building cost were factored in, the estates cost the marquess much more than they delivered in income. Bute borrowed heavily; he had inherited debts of ¬£62,500, but by the time of his death owed ¬£493,887. Financing and supporting this debt was difficult, particularly during the early 1840s, when credit was hard to come by, and John was forced to juggle lenders and different lines of credit. He believed that ultimately his investments would provide a rich return, and in 1844 noted that he thought \\"well of the prospects of my income in the distance\\". Remains of the Rhigos colliery, once owned by Bute The economic growth across South Wales drove up the demand for new housing for the growing workforce. Bute was not prepared to sell any of his lands for housing, and did not see much profit in building and renting housing himself, but was prepared to lease land in the growing urban areas and mining communities for land development. Initially, he attempted to negotiate 63 year long leases, which would have given his successors additional, early flexibility in how they managed the land, but these proved unpopular so he reverted to offering the more typical 99-year leases. None of the contracts offered by Bute allowed the lessee to buy the freehold or automatically renew the lease at the end of this term, which ultimately resulted in substantial political difficulties for the third and fourth marquesses when there was a storm of complaints in the late 19th and early 20th century. Bute left the style of the early developments up to the lessees, but was concerned by the poor results. Bute then began to approve the designs for new buildings personally, laying out some grand streets in the centre of Cardiff and retaining open areas for eventual use as parks. Very little money was invested in the sewage and drainage systems for his new developments, however, and a damning 1850 inquiry showed that this had resulted in cholera outbreaks across the town. At the start of the 19th century, scientific investigation began to indicate that the Glamorgan valleys were rich with coal deposits. Bute, who already owned coal mines in County Durham, commissioned further surveys in 1817 and 1823‚Äì24 which showed that there were potentially huge profits to be made from the reserves, both from the coal sitting beneath Bute's own lands, but also from the coal under common lands in the region that Bute could claim through his feudal titles. Bute set about consolidating his rights and existing investments during the late 1820s and 1830s, acquiring extensive rights to the coalfields in the process. Bute established and managed a few colleries ‚Äì such as that at Rhigos ‚Äì directly, but given the investment costs and attention they took up, generally preferred to lease out his coal fields and claim a royalty on the coal mined instead. The lessees might be iron- masters, who used the coal in their own operations, or colliery owners who sold the coal on to industrial or domestic customers. The profits increased from ¬£872 in the second half of 1826, to ¬£10,756 in 1848‚Äì49. Cardiff Docks Part of the Cardiff Docks in 1859 Between 1822 and 1848 Bute played a central role in the creation of the Cardiff Docks. The idea was first put forward to Bute by one of his staff in 1822, who suggested that, with the right investment, Cardiff could be transformed into a major port for exporting coal and iron. The existing seaport, used by the Glamorganshire Canal, was small and inefficient. The new port would then deliver a direct return to Bute from shipping rates, improve the value of his lands in Cardiff itself and increase the value of the royalties he could charge on his coal fields. Initially Bute opposed plans for docks put forward by the local ironmasters, but then changed his mind and pushed forward with his own scheme shortly afterward. The first phase was to build a new dock and connecting canal in Cardiff, making the Glamorganshire Canal redundant in the process, at an estimated cost of ¬£66,600, considered to opponents to be a \\"wild speculation\\". Parliamentary permission was acquired in 1830, despite opposition from the local canal companies of iron masters. The project proved more complex than originally planned, driving Bute to become irritable and angry with almost all of his associates, but the dock opened successfully in 1839. The costs of building the docks had been far more than anticipated, however. Instead of the original estimate, construction costs had soared to ¬£350,000, reaching ¬£10,000 a month in 1837. Bute had to mortgage his local estates to raise the sums required to finish the project. To make matters worse, when they first opened the docks did not receive the traffic he had expected, particularly from the larger ships; Bute put this down to a coalition of ironmasters and others intent on ruining him. Bute responded by putting commercial pressure on shipping companies to abandon the Glamorganshire Canal and using his feudal rights to force shippers to move their wharfs to his docks. His efforts paid off and although trade through the docks only came to 8,000 tons in 1839, they then rose quickly, reaching 827,000 tons by 1849. Between 1841 and 1848 the docks brought in a gross income of just under ¬£68,000, a relatively disappointing figure compared to the size of the investment. Successive marquesses would find themselves under huge pressure to continue investing and expanding in the docks and subsequent phases of construction over the coming decades. Politics=National the Disruption\\" Bute was born into the pre-Reform system of government in Britain. The British Parliament was divided into the hereditary House of Lords and the elected House of Commons, but voting systems varied widely across England and in many cases only very small numbers of local people were enfranchised to vote. Some members of the House of Lords, termed \\"patrons\\", often controlled these \\"closed\\" or \\"nominated\\" seats in the Commons, effectively appointing their own candidates. Criticism of the system, led by the Whigs, grew during the first half of Bute's life. Bute was a member of the House of Lords, able to vote on national affairs, but he had a reputation for not attending unless to vote on acts relating to his estates or business interests. When he did vote, it was usually as a moderate conservative, and Bute himself described himself as a follower of the Duke of Wellington, by then a leading Tory politician. John was in favour of Catholic Emancipation, opposed to slavery, the New Poor Law and the Game Laws. Like Wellington, he was in favour of repealing the Corn Laws. He passionately opposed electoral reform, however, and any attempts to disestablish the Church of England or Scotland. Bute had strong views on the necessity of encouraging the poor to work, and was in favour of removing the Irish poor from the mainland back to Ireland. He was a notoriously poor public speaker. In addition to his personal role in Parliament, Bute sought to control the votes of members of the House of Commons, primarily to ensure the passage of legislation affecting his business interests. Initially, the Isle of Bute had only 21 voters who were dominated by his private estate, but it only returned a Member of Parliament in alternate elections, and his estates in Luton were too limited to allow him to influence the electoral process there. The best remaining option for Bute was to control the voting in Cardiff, but even here he had to choose his candidate carefully and apply careful financial pressure through his control of leases and rents to ensure their election. In 1832 the Reform Act was passed by Parliament, widening the electorate across the country. The Isle of Bute's electorate rose to 300 and acquired a permanent Member of Parliament, still controlled by Bute. Cardiff saw a short-term drop in its electorate as a result of the act, and Bute benefited from the granting of the vote to many of his richer agricultural tenants. In the aftermath of the reforms, Bute secretly sponsored the creation of the conservative newspaper the Glamorgan Monmouth and Brecon Gazette and Merthyr Guardian, to increase support across the county, and underwrote its losses for many years. From 1842 to 1846 he acted as Her Majesty's High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. He was known for his generosity as a host in this role. He was in office during the schism in the Church of Scotland known as \\"the Disruption\\", when many many ministers of the Church broke away from the established Church to form the Free Church. Bute took a firm line on the matter: when his head-gardener at Mount Stuart House joined the Free Church, he was immediately sacked, and when the minister at one of Bute's churches in the north of the island attempted to hold a Free Church ceremony there, Bute demanded the keys to the church be returned and had the property closed up. South WalesRe-establishing authority= Bute was determined to control the local government around Cardiff, considering it part of his rights and duties as a major landowner and aristocrat. On inheriting his estates, however, he found himself facing a difficult political situation. The Butes' grip on Glamorganshire had been weakened in the late 18th century, and the management of their political interests had been left for many years in the hands of John Wood, a local solicitor, whose family was embroiled in local politics, with their own set of interests. Glamorgan was also politically split between factions in the west and the east of the county, with most of Bute's estates in the eastern half. Bute's residence in the area, Cardiff Castle, was understaffed and regarded as unsuitable as a residence; consequently, he lacked the easy local patronage that would have come with a major, properly functioning establishment. There were tensions between Bute and the new industrialists around the region, including ironmasters such as John Guest, the master of the Dowlais Ironworks. Bute was a financial competitor or landlord with many of these men, and keen to drive as good a deal as possible in his negotiations with them. He also had political differences, seeing himself as a benevolent feudal lord in South Wales, and perceiving the local iron-masters as arrogant, power-hungry individuals, abusing their economic power towards communities and workers. Nonetheless, Bute was able to personally appoint the Constable of Cardiff Castle, and the constable by law acted as the effective mayor of Cardiff, ran the town's council and had wide powers when appointing local officials. He inherited the title of Lord-Lieutenant of the county in 1815, giving him the right to recommend the appointments of new magistrates and various other civic posts; potential candidates for these posts were advised to vote for Bute's representatives at elections. In 1825 he became the colonel in chief of the Royal Glamorgan Militia, and used this authority to instruct the militia to vote for his candidates. Those who publicly voted against Bute faced charitable donations and support being cut off. His later control of the Cardiff Docks also helped to provide patronage and influence voting behaviour. In 1817, John Wood died in the midst of a financial scandal, and Bute decided to appoint two of his rivals to the posts of Constable and Cardiff's Town Clerk. This would have reaffirmed Bute's power to change the appointments and broken the Wood's family hold on local power, but it provoked a storm of local political wrangling. The Wood family turned on Bute, arguing that he should abandon his claims to control local Welsh affairs from Scotland. Bute replied by trying to crush the Wood family's bank and stacking the town council with his appointees in early 1818. The Woods successfully took legal action, challenging Bute's authority to take these actions, and anti-Bute violence flared that summer, resulting in arrests by Special Constables appointed by Bute. The pro-Bute faction in Cardiff rallied and the Woods were defeated at the Parliamentary elections that year, the results reaffirming Bute's authority over the town council. =Merthyr Rising= Cyfarthfa Castle, scene of part of the Merthyr Rising in 1831 Bute played a role in the event of the Merthyr Rising, a large, armed industrial protest that occurred in Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales in 1831. Political tensions amongst the working classes in Glamorgan had grown during the 1820s: although wages were impressive by contemporary standards during good years, they deteriorated quickly during depressions, plunging many into destitution; sanitation and health standards in the fast-growing industrial communities were appalling, child mortality rates were extremely high. 1831 saw a severe economic depression, with wages falling quickly and food prices rising, and complaints against the local debt courts and their bailiffs were numerous. Nationally, the electoral reform movement was making considerable protests and protests against the Corn Laws‚Äîwhich kept the prices of food high‚Äîwere growing. In South Wales, several of the major ironmasters were associated with these movements, promoting reform under the Whig administration voted into power between April and June 1831. By late 1830, and certainly by the spring of 1831, trouble in South Wales looked likely and, probably in response, Bute broke from his normal annual plans and in May travelled south from Scotland to Cardiff Castle.; With a reform bill looking likely, tensions grew between the different political factions in Glamorganshire and how the potential new parliamentary seats should be shared out, especially between Bute and his conservative allies, Crawshay and Guest. Radical demonstrations occurred in Merthyr Tydfil, one of the largest industrial communities, in May, and the crowd set light to effigies of conservative politicians. Violence broke out and arrests were made on 10 May; the prisoners were released by the angry crowd and the local authorities effectively lost any control of the town. A general insurrection ensued on 30 May. Two local magistrates, J. Bruce and Anthony Hill, were stranded in the Castle Inn in Merthyr Tydfil. They swore in around 70 men as special constables, but they were heavily outnumbered by the radical crowds. Bruce wrote an urgent letter to Bute in Cardiff Castle, asking for urgent advice on whether to call in the armed forces, and querying whether the Marquess had readied the Militia for action. Huge crowds marched on the local iron works, stopping production. The messages from Merthyr Tydfil reached Bute that afternoon, who began to assemble the Eastern and Central Yeomanry militia units and transport ready for deployment. Bute paused until the morning, hoping to hear better news, but messengers bought more desperate news from Bruce and Hill, and the Yeomanry were dispatched. Meanwhile, an 80-man unit of the 93rd Foot had arrived in the Castle Inn from Brecon. Bute continued to keep Whitehall informed of the events by letter throughout. On the morning of 3 May, the 93rd Foot reached the Castle Inn, where the magistrates had been joined by the established figures of the town, deputised as constables, including the High Sheriff and most of the ironmasters. Outside, the radical crowds had grown to an estimated number of between 7,000 and 10,000. Tensions rose alarmingly and the Riot Act was read in English and Welsh. Violence flared, the crowds attempted to seize the soldiers' weapons and the soldiers responded with volleys of musket fire. The town's working classes exploded in anger and set about searching the region for weapons. A messenger escaped the inn to reach Bute in Cardiff, who set about mobilising all the remaining armed forces he had available. Bute also despatched Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Morgan of the Militia into Merthyr to replace the commander of the 93rd Foot who had been badly injured. The men in the Castle Inn retreated to Penydarren House, who were joined by the initial reinforcements from the Yeomanry, bringing the establishment's numbers to around 300, not all of them were armed and able to fight. They faced increasingly well-armed insurgents and Bute became increasingly concerned about the quality of the opposition facing his men. Bute sent spies into the insurgency, and nearby Cyfarthfa Castle was pressed into service as an observation post. Bute mobilised military pensioners, and used them to start to bring Penydarren House additional weaponry from Cardiff; he was advised to be careful, however, in case the shipments fell into the hands of the insurgency. Morgan's forces were able to prevent the radical crowds from entering either Penydarren or Cyfartha, and Bute arrested potential insurgents in Cardiff. On 16 May, Morgan was in a position to advance in force into Merthyr, pushing forward and taking advantage of the poor communications between the various elements of the insurgency. The uprising collapsed, and over the next few days the authorities regained control, making arrests and forcing the workers back to business. Government inquiries into the incident began and Bute, among others, provided analysis and reports to Whitehall. In the aftermath, Richard Lewis, one of the radical crowd, was hanged in Cardiff. The execution proved controversial and it is unknown whether Bute, who had by then left to attend Parliament in London, approved of the decision.; =Later years= Concerns over possible violent outbreaks continued for many years. Chartism became prominent in the region in the late 1830s, again causing Bute considerable worries in 1839 and leading to him encouraging the mobilisation of military forces to deal with the threat. Bute began to advocate the creation of a police force to suppress the problems in the northern valleys, for once allying himself with the local ironmasters to overcome rural opposition to the scheme. In 1841 the scheme was passed by the Glamorgan magistrates, with a chief constable and headquarters established that year. In 1835 an act of Parliament reformed the local government structure, introducing a new town corporation structure with an elected mayor for the first time. Bute had to work harder to maintain his influence over the new corporation, using the various levers of influence at his disposal. He was successful, and in practice the elected officials and councillors were controlled by Bute and his interests. Death Bute's statue in Callaghan Square, Cardiff Bute died in Cardiff on 18 March 1848, and was buried in Kirtling, alongside Maria, his first wife. His funeral had 31 carriages in attendance and drew large crowds, although his funeral was snubbed by the local ironmasters. The national press gave his death little coverage, but the local Daily Chronicle noted Bute's unusual achievement in building up the industrial base of his South Wales estates, and particularly praised his role in constructing the Cardiff Docks. The Cardiff Docks, whose opening in 1837 had led the press to praise Bute as \\"the creator of modern Cardiff\\", continued to transform the city over the rest of the century. They would also form a financial liability to Bute successors, the costs of the continual investment needed to maintain and grow the facilities partially off- setting the huge profits that Bute's son enjoyed from the South Wales coalfields. A subscription was raised across Glamorgan to pay for a statue to be made of him, which was erected in Cardiff's High Street in 1853, outside the town hall. In 2000 the statue, Cardiff's oldest, was moved to Bute Square, but the location was renamed Callaghan Square in 2002, leading to proposals from local officials that Bute's statue might be better relocated once again, potentially to outside Cardiff Castle.

For those with drug or alcohol problems a six-month substance abuse program is offered. Alcoholics Anonymous also operates at the complex. History The prison was established in 1839, one year after Iowa became a territory, and seven years before it became a state in 1846. ISP was patterned after the penitentiary in Auburn, New York. In 1982 the prison was remodeled, and unitization was introduced at ISP. The unitization divided the large cell blocks into smaller units that were easier to manage. In 2008 the prison's library was moved to another location on the grounds. The ISP library offers an extensive book collection, as well as computers for inmate use. However, prisoners do not have access to the Internet. Before the abolition of capital punishment in Iowa, executions were performed at Fort Madison. An interesting note in the history of the prison was the execution of Victor Feguer. Feguer was a drifter who had murdered Dubuque doctor Edward Bartels. After appeals that even went as far as President John F. Kennedy were denied, Feguer was executed by hanging on March 15, 1963. Feguer was the last inmate in the Federal prison system to be put to death for nearly 40 years until the execution of Timothy McVeigh at the Terre Haute, Indiana Federal Prison in 2001. Feguer also became the last person in Iowa to be executed; soon after his death, Iowa abolished the death penalty. While Feguer's death attracted little attention at the time, the execution of McVeigh attracted renewed interest in the Feguer execution. 1981 Riot The 1981 riot was on September 2, and lasted from approximately 10:20 AM‚Äì9:25 PM. Several inmates started the uprising by taking four hostages, among them Security Director James Mekne and Assistant Security Director Larry Moline, who were later released in exchange for the offenders being allowed to talk to the news media about prisoner grievances. In addition, eight newly hired employees at ISP were also taken hostage and forced to trade clothes with the offenders. Most were beaten. It was originally thought this incident was spontaneous although it was later reported it was the result of a plan conceived and executed by a handful of inmates. Inmates used a tractor to pull the door off Cellhouse 20. By the time the offenders had broken in, law enforcement personnel had cut the bars out of the cell house, removed the employees who had been hiding there and rewelded the bars back shut. A forklift from the Prison Industries facility was taken in an attempt to break into Cellhouse 17 West, which held protective custody inmates. No prisoners escaped. Kenneth Sheffey, 21, was the original uprising spokesman. He was serving life in prison for the first-degree murder of Roddy Lee Hahn, 15. He made numerous demands, including getting to speak with selected members of the media to air some of the inmates' grievances. Three bloodied inmates (a robber, a burglar, and an arsonist) were found locked in their cells Monday morning after the riot had been contained. It was thought at least one was a person other inmates didn't like very well. After the incident, they were taken to University of Iowa Hospitals in Iowa City. Up to 15 prisoners were actively involved in the uprising, but estimated that 60 of the 90 inmates in the cellblock were outside their cells when the assault teams burst in. One inmate, Gary Eugene Tyson, was murdered. Other prisoners believed Tyson was talking to authorities investigating the May 1981 death of Allen Lewis, another inmate. It was because of this act that officials believed the riot had been started. Tyson's body was found in a storage room attached to the prison kitchen. Tyson had been stabbed nine times in the neck, nine times in the left side of the chest, three times in the left side of the back, and once in the left hand. A makeshift knife was still protruding from Tyson's neck. Evidence produced at trial would permit the jury to find the following facts: Tyson was a member of the prison gang known as the \\"Almighty Vice Lords.\\" During the murder investigation of Lewis, a number of Vice Lords were placed in \\"segregation\\" (locked status) in Cellblock 20. Among them were Tyson and the undisputed leader of the gang, Allen Langely. Langley received two life sentences in connection with the slaying of Tyson and a life sentence for the May 1981 slaying of Lewis. He was charged with first-degree murder in both slayings. Hal Farrier, Dept. of Corrections director at the time, ordered assault teams into the prison without consulting Gov. Terry Branstad as time was of the essence. The squads converged on the cellblock from all directions. Some inmates gave minor resistance. Some were armed with table legs and broken broom handles. Prison officials said there were 536 inmates in the 550-capacity prison when the uprising began. The warden at the time of the riot was David Scurr. The deputy warden was Paul Hedgepeth. More than $1 million in property damage was done. 2005 Escape And Prison Replacement On November 14, 2005 two inmates were the first to escape from the facility since 1979. The two men, Robert Joseph Legendre and Martin Shane Moon used upholstery webbing to scale one of the prison's limestone walls. This webbing was used by the prison industries program to make furniture. Both Legendre and Moon were serving life sentences. Moon was convicted of murdering his roommate in 1990. Legendre is serving a life sentence for attempted murder, weapons, and drug charges. Legendre is serving time at the prison as part of a program between the states of Iowa and Nevada. Following the escape the prison was locked down. The pair was believed to have stolen a 1995 gold Pontiac Bonneville with the license plate number 776-NOW. After escaping the pair split up. On November 17, Moon was captured near Chester, Illinois. Authorities discovered him sleeping in a stolen vehicle near Menard State Prison. Around 3 A.M. law enforcement approached the car and asked Moon for his I.D. Moon instead started the vehicle and led police on a short chase. He later left the vehicle and tried to flee on foot, but was apprehended at that point. He waived extradition and was returned to the Fort Madison prison. The next day Legendre was captured in Caruthersville, Missouri. He has yet to be returned to Iowa, and remains in custody in Missouri. The main reason the two inmates were able to escape was because the wall they scaled was unguarded - the nearest guard tower was unmanned due to low staff levels. Corrections officials have indicated that budget cuts had forced them to lower staffing levels. These escapes have already touched off a political debate in Iowa. Democratic state Senator Gene Fraise of Fort Madison suggested that the staffing levels were the primary reason the escapes were successful. Republicans have countered that advances in technology have allowed for prison resources to be redirected. Former Governor Vilsack had an investigation undertaken into this incident. Several employees were disciplined in the wake of the escapes, and warden Ken Burger was replaced by John Ault - who had been warden at the Anamosa, Iowa prison. Vilsack also asked for recommendations on whether or not a new maximum security institution should be built - which he estimates could cost up to $40 million. Groundbreaking ceremonies were held in Fort Madison on Thursday, April 22, 2010 for a new, 800 inmate prison to replace the Iowa State Penitentiary. Iowa Governor Chet Culver led the ceremony for the projected $130 million project which was scheduled to be completed in 2014. The new Iowa State Penitentiary was completed in 2014, though some problems kept the new facilityhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/21/delays-continue-for- new-iowa-state-penitentiary/ from opening on schedule, inmates were transferred from the old facility to the new on August 1, 2015.http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2015/08/01/fort- madison-iowa-prison-move/30993681/ As of August 2016, there continue to be concerns raised by AFSCME, the union representing Iowa's state employees, about staffing levels at Iowa's prisons; often after injuries of either prisoners and/or corrections officers become known to the public. However, Republican governor Terry Branstad and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives insist that staffing levels are adequate. The state offered to transfer ownership of the penitentiary over to the city who initially planned to turn the prison into a museum sometime in 2014, in order to boost tourism to the city. In May, 2017 the former prison was opened for a one time tour, with current and retired prison employees acting as guards. The prison is still owned by the state of Iowa, who pays about $1,000 a day to keep the lights on and the site secure. The city wants an environmental study to be done before prison ownership is transferred to a non profit. Religious freedom of prisoners In an MSNBC episode of Lockup: Raw, the prisons extensive religious programs were profiled. Iowa State Penitentiary allows inmates to participate in a wide range of religious observations, ranging from Buddhism and Wicca to Satanism. In the episode a group of inmates can be seen lighting candles and using a gong during a Satanic service, after which various aspects of the Satanic Bible are discussed on camera. During the filming, the prison's chaplain speaks of the importance of religious practice to the inmates daily lives.

Educated as a lawyer, she began publishing soon after she completed high school and simultaneously worked as a solicitor and writer throughout most of her career. She is a recipient of the Cam√µes Prize, the highest literary award of the Portuguese language and her works have received honors and awards from Brazil, Chile and France. She was elected as the third woman in the Brazilian Academy of Letters in 1985 and holds Chair 16. Early life Lygia Fagundes was born on 19 April 1923 in S√£o Paulo, Brazil to Maria do Ros√°rio Silva Jardim de Moura and Durval de Azevedo Fagundes. Her father was an attorney and public prosecutor who also served as a district attorney, commissioner of police and a judge. Her mother, known as Zazita, was a pianist. Because of the nature of her father's work, the family moved often throughout the state, living at various times in Apia√≠, Assis, Itatinga and Sert√£ozinho. When she was eight years old, Fagundes moved with her mother to Rio de Janeiro, where they remained for five years. Returning to S√£o Paulo, she enrolled in Caetano de Campos School, and graduated in 1937. With proceeds from her father, in 1938, she published Por√µes e Sobrados (Grounds and Townhouses), a collection of short stories. In 1939, Fagundes graduated with her pre-law and physical education degrees from the University of S√£o Paulo (USP). In 1941, she enrolled in the Law School at USP () as one of only six women students in a class of over one hundred men. Simultaneously, she began working for the government, with the Secretary of Agriculture, as well as writing her second book of short stories, Praia Viva (Living Beach), which she published in 1944. The following year, she graduated with her law degree and in 1947, married her international law professor, Goffredo Telles Jr. The couple would have their only child, Goffredo da Silva Telles Neto in 1952. Career An early photograph from the Brazilian National Archives Telles continued to work in civil service and became a collaborator with A Manh√£ (The Morning) writing a weekly column for the journal located in Rio. In 1949 she received the Afonso Arinos award from the Brazilian Academy of Letters for her short stories book O Cacto Vermelho (Red Cactus). Among her most successful books is Ciranda de Pedra (The Marble Dance) (1954 reprinted in 1986), which deals with women's sexuality. Telles felt that it was the first work she had produced that marked her maturity as a writer, often criticizing her earlier works. In 1958, she published Hist√≥rias do Desencontro (Uncontrollable Stories) which won the prize of the . In 1960, Telles divorced, and the following year began working as a solicitor for the Institute of Providence () of the State of S√£o Paulo. She would work in this office and continue her publishing efforts simultaneously until 1991. In 1962, she married, the film critic and writer , though as divorce was not technically recognized in Brazil at that time, their partnership was considered socially unacceptable. Telles continued writing in the following decades, such works as: Ver√£o no Aqu√°rio (Summer at the Aquarium, 1963), which won the Jabuti Prize in 1965; Capitu (1967, published 1993) a cinematic script co-written with her husband Gomes based upon Machado de Assis' work Dom Casmurro, which won the Candango Award for best screenplay in 1969; Antes do Baile Verde (Before the Green Ball, 1970), which won the Best Foreign Women Writers Grand Prix in Cannes (France) in 1969; As Meninas (The Girls, 1973), which received multiple awards, including the Jabuti Prize, the Coelho Neto Prize of the Brazilian Academy of Letters and the Best Fiction Award from the S√£o Paulo Association of Art Critics; Semin√°rio dos Ratos (Seminary of the Rats, 1977), which would win the award for best short story from the Pen Club of Brazil that same year; A Disciplina do Amor (The Discipline of Love, 1980), which won her another Jabuti Prize, as well as the S√£o Paulo Association of Art Critics Award; and As Horas Nuas, (Naked Hours, 1989), which won the \\"Book of the Year\\" and was honored with the Pr√™mio Pedro Nava. Telles' most acclaimed novel, As Meninas, tells the story of three young women in the early 1970s, a difficult time in the political history of Brazil due to the repression by the military dictatorship. She was among intellectuals who went to Brasilia in 1977, to deliver the Manifesto of the Thousand (). The protest was the largest demonstration of intellectuals since the press censorship instituted by president/dictator Em√≠lio Garrastazu M√©dici began in 1968. She led the delegation, composed of historian and the writers N√©lida Pi√±on and Jefferson Ribeiro de Andrade to present the signed petition to Armando Falc√£o, the Justice Minister in the cabinet of President Ernesto Geisel. Later that same year, her husband, Gomes would die. On 24 October 1985, Telles was elected to hold Chair 16, of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, the third woman ever to be elected to a chair. After her retirement from the Institute of Providence in 1991, she continued publishing works such as A Noite Escura e Mais Eu (The Dark Night and More Me, 1995), which won the Arthur Azevedo Prize from the National Library of Brazil; Oito contos de amor (Eight Tales of Love, 1996); Inven√ß√£o e Mem√≥ria (Invention and Memory, 2001), which earned her the Jabuti Prize, a parallel honor as Book of the Year, and the Grand Prize of the Critic of the Best of 2000 from the S√£o Paulo Association of Art Critics; Durante Aquele Estranho Ch√° (During the Strange Tea, 2002); Conspira√ß√£o de Nuvens (Cloud Compromise, 2007), which won the S√£o Paulo Association of Art Critics Prize; and Passaporte para a China (Passport to China, 2011). In 1985, Telles was honored as a commander in the Order of Rio Branco by the government of Brazil. In 1998, she was awarded the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in the grade of chevalier and was honored as a grand officer of the Gabriela Mistral Order of Educational and Cultural Merit from Chile. In 2005 Telles won the Cam√µes Prize, the highest literary award of the Portuguese language for her body of works. As of 2013, she was one of the four female members of the Brazilian Academy of Letters. Her books have been translated into Czech, English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Spanish, Swedish, and been reprinted in multiple editions in Portuguese. She was nominated for the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature by the Brazilian Writers' Union.

Located there are a harness racing track and the Hochschule f√ºr Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin (HTW), the largest University of Applied Sciences in Berlin, and the German-Russian Museum Berlin-Karlshorst. History The German-Russian Museum. Established in 1895 as the Carlshorst mansion's colony, Karlshorst from 1901 had access to the railway line from Berlin to Breslau (today Wroc≈Çaw, Poland) and developed to a quite affluent residential area, sometimes referred to as \\"Dahlem of the East\\". The locality encompasses the Waldsiedlung, a garden city laid out between 1919 and 1921 according to plans by Peter Behrens. In April 1945, as the Red Army approached the Reich's capital, Marshal Georgy Zhukov, commander of the 1st Belorussian Front, established his headquarters at a former Wehrmacht officer's mess hall in Karlshorst, where on May 8, the unconditional surrender of the German forces was presented to Zhukov by Colonel-General Hans-J√ºrgen Stumpff as the representative of the Luftwaffe, Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel as Chief of Staff of OKW, and Admiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg as Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine. From 1945 to 1949 the building complex served as the headquarters of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany. After the establishment of the German Democratic Republic it hosted the 6th Independent Motorized Rifle Brigade, the Soviets' \\"Berlin Brigade,\\" until the last Russian soldiers left Karlshorst in 1994. The former headquarters has been made the home of the German-Russian Museum Berlin-Karlshorst (Deutsch-Russisches Museum Berlin-Karlshorst) , formerly called the Capitulation Museum.

This integration of four functions into a single fuze reduces the logistics and cost to support mortar crews on the battlefield. Settings A typical mortar firing procedure is for a squad leader to select a target and call for one of the four fuze settings. A gunner sights the mortar onto the target and an ammunition bearer sets the fuze. An assistant gunner drops the shell into the tube upon a command to fire from the squad leader.FM 23-90, \\"Mortars,\\" Department of the Army, 1 March 2000, Chapters 3-7, Section I. Tools are not required to install or set the fuze. It is adjusted by hand, even with Arctic mittens, simply by rotating the top of the fuze clockwise until a three-letter engraving is above an index line. Additionally, the setting can be changed any number of times without causing damage to the fuze. The four engravings around the circumference of metal housing of the fuze have the following meanings for detonation height:FM 23-90, \\"Mortars,\\" Department of the Army, 1 March 2000, Sections 3-20, 4-21, 5-20. *PRX = Proximity air burst between 3 and 13 feet *NSB = Near surface burst between 0 and 3 feet *IMP = Impact burst on contact.

Retrieved: 10 June 2012. In all four settings, the high explosive in the mortar shell is detonated by a cascading explosive train of four increasing energies within the fuze. These are the Microdet electric detonator, the explosive lead, the explosive booster, and the delay primer assembly functioning as follows: :* In the PROX, NSB, and IMP fuze settings, a firing circuit applies a voltage to the small Microdet which faces and ignites a bigger explosive lead that channels into the explosive booster which initiates the shell's high explosive. :* In the DLY setting, the explosive lead is initiated instead by the delay primer assembly, which operates even in the event of power supply or electronics failures. :* Reliability against duds is increased by the fact that if the M734 fails to detonate the mortar shell at one setting, it will immediately and automatically use the next one along, i.e. failure at the PRX setting causes NSB detonation to be selected. Similarly, failure to detonate at the NSB setting will automatically cause IMP to be selected, and so on. :* This redundancy is a safety factor designed to prevent malfunctioning mortar shells from being buried upon ground impact and becoming a risk to civilians after a battle or becoming ammunition for enemy activities. Safety { M734 fuze components Mechanical arming } Fuzes assembled by the manufacturer are preset to PRX and stockpiled on mortar shells for immediate use. The fuze is safe to handle, however, because the two detonators are mounted in a safety and arming (S&A;) assembly that holds them 180 degrees out of alignment with the explosive lead and booster. The events required to rotate the explosive train into alignment and generate power for the fuze electronics cannot be accomplished by accident or deliberately by a vandal because three actions difficult to simulate must be applied in rapid succession:Campagnuolo, C. J., Fine, J. E., ‚ÄúPresent Capability of Ram-Air Driven Alternators Developed at HDL as Fuze Power Supplies,‚Äù Harry Diamond Labs, HDL-TR-2013, July 1983. # An axial acceleration pulse similar to the launch inside a mortar tube # Air flow through the nose cone air-inlet and air-outlet that is similar to flight # Motion that resembles the trajectory of a mortar shell in flight (on the product improved M734A1 fuze) Axial acceleration and wind stream forces combine to arm the fuze 100 meters or more from the launcher.Campagnuolo, C. J., Fine, J. E., ‚ÄúPresent Capability of Ram-Air Driven Alternators Developed at HDL as Fuze Power Supplies,‚Äù Harry Diamond Labs, HDL-TR-2013, July 1983, p.7. This mechanical arming is accomplished by a torsion spring rotating the detonators 180 degrees into an explosive train alignment as soon as the spring is unlocked by the acceleration forces depressing a zig-zag setback device and the wind stream forces unscrewing a jackscrew locking device. This delay in mechanical arming after two independent features of gunfire is a basic safety requirementMIL-STD-1316E, \\"Fuze Design Safety Criteria,\\" Department of Defense, 9 April 1991, Sections 4.2.1, 4.2.2. called \\"dual-safing\\". An unprecedented third safety factor incorporated as a product improvement in the M734A1 fuze was to delay the electrical arming of the PROX, NSB, and IMP settings beyond 100 meters out to the highest point of shell flight.TM 43-0001-28, \\"Army Ammunition Data Sheets,\\" Department of the Army, April 1977, p7-46.1.Ingersol, Phillip, ‚ÄúMethod and Apparatus for Mortar Fuze Apex Arming,‚Äù US Patent, Serial No. 5,390,604, February 21, 1995  See the Abstract. :* This electrical arming is simply the energizing of the firing circuit to the Microdet used by all three fuze settings :* Since the apex varies with each type of mortar, the firing angle, and the amount of propellant, a microprocessor in the fuze is used to calculate the time remaining after launch to reach peak height. This is accomplished by monitoring in real time the frequencies of the Doppler radar and the wind driven power supply (turbine alternator assembly) and comparing to a data bank in memory. Power supply {M734 fuze power supply components  Air turbine  Turbine spin governor } The wind stream in flight provides both the mechanical power needed to arm the S&A; and the electrical power needed for the fuze electronics. There is a system of components used in the M734 to capture and regulate air flow within the fuze and convert a portion of the air power to mechanical and electrical power before exiting the fuze.Fine, J. E., Campagnuolo, C. J., \\"Development of an Air-Driven Alternator for 60mm Mortar Application: Phase II,\\" Harry Diamond Laboratories, HDL-TM-73-7, May 1973. :* In this system, the air inlet directs the wind stream into a converging-diverging nozzle (Venturi tube) that limits the mass flow rate (choked flow) :* The axial flow then rams the center of a flat impeller and flows radially through the blades. The curvature of the blades continuously redirects the flow and the net pressure on the concave surface area generates a torque that rotates a drive shaft. :* The drive shaft is permanently connected to an alternating current generator called the turbine alternator assembly whose operating principles resemble an automobile belt-driven alternator miniaturized to provide 20 volts and withstand an acceleration of 20,000 g. :* The drive shaft is also engaged with the S&A; mechanism at the time of launch, and disengages after a specific number of shaft revolutions. This action unscrews a jackscrew locking device and enables the explosive train to snap into alignment, thereby completing the second step in mechanical arming. Since arming is required to occur after a flight of 100 meters for three mortars that have a wide range in launch velocities, the rpm that releases the jackscrew at the slowest launch velocity must increase in direct proportion to any increase in launch velocity. The turbine, however, will tend to spin faster than desired, so, to prevent early arming, three governors are used to reduce the spin:Campagnuolo, C. J., Fine, J. E., ‚ÄúPresent Capability of Ram-Air Driven Alternators Developed at HDL as Fuze Power Supplies,‚Äù Harry Diamond Labs, HDL-TR-2013, July 1983, p11. :*First, the number, size, and curvature of the turbine blades is designed to achieve arming at 100 meters or more for the lowest launch velocity of 45 m/s :*Second, the Venturi tube is designed to limit the mass flow rate of air available to propel the turbine :*Third, the tips of the turbine blades are undercut to introduce a flexibility that allows centrifugal force to bend the tips outward. This decreases the effective blade curvature, which lowers the surface pressure on the blade and the turbine spins slower than with an inflexible blade. By undercutting deep enough, the jackscrew drive shaft rotation is slow enough at all launch velocities to assure arming is beyond the minimum 100 meters. Once the air flows from the tips, the air outlet directs the exhaust into the atmosphere at an angle oblique to the external wind stream. The resulting turbulence degrades the accuracy of flight toward the target, so the exhaust is directed onto a vertical metal fin that guides the flow into the external wind stream. The performance of the turbine alternator is unaffected if the mortar shell encounters a tropical rainstormMIL-HDBK-310, \\"Global Climatic Data for Designing Military Products,\\" Department of Defense, 23 June 1997  See Rainfall Rate. while en route to the target.Fine, J.

Biography  Procopius was the son of Anthemius and of Marcia Euphemia, daughter of the Eastern Roman Emperor. His brothers were Anthemiolus, Marcian and Romulus; he also had a sister, Alypia. He lived at Constantinople, at Eastern Emperor Leo I's court, while his father later ruled the Western Roman Empire (467-472), unsuccessfully trying to restore Roman power in the Western provinces beyond Italy and Gaul. During this time, his brother Anthemiolus died while leading an attack against the Visigoths (in 471) and his sister Alypia married Ricimer, the powerful magister militum of barbarian origin. In 474, Leo died. He had left no sons and two daughters, the elder Ariadne, born before Leo was raised to the throne and married to the Isaurian general Zeno, and the younger Leontia, born when Leo was already emperor and married to Procopius' brother, Marcian. The people of Constantinople despised the Isaurians, whom they considered barbarians; furthermore, Leontia's status as \\"porphyrogenita\\" gave her some sort of precedence to the throne, according to the faction that opposed Zeno. For this reason Marcian tried to overthrow Zeno. With the help of Procopius and Romulus, he gathered in Constantinople troops composed of both citizens and foreigners in the house of a Caesarius, south of the Forum of Theodosius, and from there they marched at the same time on the imperial palace and on the house of Illus, an Isaurian general who supported Zeno. The emperor almost fell into the hands of the rebels, who, during the day, overwhelmed the imperial troops, who were also attacked by citizens from the roofs of their houses. During the night, however, Illus succeeded in moving an Isaurian unit quartered in nearby Chalcedonia into Constantinople and in corrupting Marcian's soldiers, who allowed Zeno to flee. On the following morning Marcian, understanding that his situation was desperate and that reinforcements under the Gothic general Theodoric Strabo would not arrive in time, took refuge in the church of the Holy Apostles, but was then arrested with his brothers. They were sent to Caesarea in Cappadocia. With the help of some monks, they tried to escape, but Marcian failed, while Procopius fled to Theodoric Strabo in Thrace,Theodorus Lector, Epitome 420.John of Antioch, fragment 211.3.\\\\--where the latter refused to hand him to ZenoMalchus, fragment 19.\\\\--and then to Rome. Later Procopius returned to Constantinople, during the reign of Anastasius I (491-518). Empress Ariadne asked Anastasius, whom she had married after Zeno's death, to appoint Procopius praetorian prefect; Anastasius refused, saying that the office required more learning than Procopius had.John Lydus, De mag.

Mathisen, Ruricius of Limoges and friends, Liverpool University Press, 1999, , p. 21).

Captain William Lonsdale, a police magistrate, was appointed in 1836 and the first case was heard at a location near the present site of Southern Cross station (formerly Spencer Street station). In 1838, a third court, the Court of Petty Sessions was created. By 1890, all three types of courts were held at 235 locations throughout Victoria. On 20 January 1914, the new City Court was opened at Russell Street in Melbourne and Phillip Blashki JP was the first Chairman of the City Court Bench.

Description S. seticornis off Hispaniola The body of S. seticornis is triangular, and the rostrum is drawn out into a long point with serrate edges. The legs are also long and thin, up to across, and the animal's carapace may be up to long. Colouration is variable in this species; the body may be golden, yellow or cream, marked with brown, black or iridescent-blue lines; the legs are reddish or yellow, and the claws are blue or violet. This species presents as diagnostic features: triangular body with long pointed snout (rostrum), carapace decorated with fine dark lines and claws often have violet tips. S. seticornis is most commonly associated with anemones, in groups ranging from one to six individuals in south-eastern Brazil. Distribution Stenorhynchus seticornis is commonly found in the shallow sub-tidal on rock bottoms, corals, calcareous algae, and also on soft sediments, such as shelly gravel and sand. Its geographical distribution is restricted to the Occidental Atlantic, from North Carolina to Argentina. Stenorhynchus seticornis is found in the western Atlantic Ocean, from North Carolina and Bermuda to Brazil, including throughout the Caribbean Sea,. It lives on coral reefs at depths of . Ecology and behaviour S. seticornis is nocturnal and territorial. It eats small feather duster worms and other coral reef invertebrates. This crab is commonly kept in reef aquariums to control bristle worm populations. S. seticornis is one of a number of different invertebrates that are found living in association with the sea anemone, Lebrunia danae. It is often found among the anemone's pseudotentacles along with Pederson's cleaning shrimp (Ancylomenes pedersoni) and the spotted cleaner shrimp (Periclimenes yucatanicus). S. seticornis have displayed notable negative phototaxis, meaning the organism prefers to avoid sunlight. This species changes location during the day and nighttime.  Symbiotic Relationships  There is a considerable number of reports on cleaning symbiosis among reef fish, moray eels, and squirrelfish. This is a somewhat unexpected relationship as moray eels and squirrelfish can be considered dangerous clients, because crabs are important elements of their diets. This behavior has only been observed in the natural environment in Brazilian waters but it is believed that this behavior also exists throughout its distribution. Life cycle & Reproduction During mating, the male places a spermatophore on the female, which she uses to fertilise her eggs. These fertilised eggs are then carried on the female's pleopods until they are ready to hatch into zoea larvae. These swim towards the ocean surface and feed on plankton. They grow through a series of moults, and eventually metamorphose into the adult form. When mature, the spermatozoa of S. seticornis show five lateral arms, similar to the sperm morphology of Inachus phalangium.  Breeding Period  Climate majorly regulates the breeding period of the arrow crab. Seasonal variation of water temperature and sunlight duration are considered as the most important variables determining the breeding period of arrow crabs. There is a positive relationship between fecundity and the size of the parental female. In fact, the size of the female is the key variable in determining the number of eggs per batch. The female also determines the reproductive output of arrow crabs.  Larval Stage  Larvae that have grown in shallow water differ from larvae that grow in deeper water. The key difference is in the setation of the endopodite of the maxilla. Taxonomic history Stenorhynchus seticornis was first described by Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Herbst in 1788, under the name Cancer seticornis. It was also described as \\"Cancer sagittarius\\" by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1793, a name which is now a junior synonym of S. seticornis. Pierre Andr√© Latreille erected the genus Stenorhynchus (originally mis-spelt Stenorynchus) in 1818, and S. seticornis was confirmed as the type species by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in 1966.

It starts at US Highway 2 (US 2) near Blaney Park north of Lake Michigan. The highway borders the eastern edge of the Seney National Wildlife Refuge and passes through the community of Germfask. At Seney, it overlaps M-28 to cross the Fox River before returning northward. The northern half has been designated as a Scenic Spur of the Lake Superior Circle Tour. M-77 runs along the eastern end of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore and terminates in Grand Marais north of H-58 near Lake Superior. Originally designated by 1919, the highway has not been changed much in its history. By the late 1950s, the highway was paved, completing the modern M-77 highway. Route description From US 2 near Blaney Park going north, M-77 runs past the former Blaney Park Resort and out of town by a small private airport next to Lake Ann Louise. The highway continues through rural woodlands past Chip Lake. The road crosses the Manistique River as it runs through Germfask. From just south of Germfask to just south of Seney, the road forms the eastern boundary of the Seney National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge is a managed wetland in Schoolcraft County in Michigan. Established in 1935, it has an area of bordered by M-28 and M-77 that is the remains of the Great Manistique Swamp, a perched sand wetland located in the central UP. The refuge contains the Strangmoor Bog National Natural Landmark within its boundaries. During the 1930s, work crews employed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) rebuilt, restored, and expanded the wetland drains, this time for active wetlands management purposes. These CCC ponds and drains are still used by the wetlands managers that staff the current National Wildlife Refuge. At Seney, M-77 crosses a line of the Canadian National Railway and turns east along M-28. Both run concurrently for less than half a mile (0.8 km) over a crossing of the Fox River before M-77 turns back northward. About north of Seney, the road turns sharply to the west, near Snyder Lake. The trunkline continues along several other lakes before turning northeasterly and then northward. The road marks the easternmost extent of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore around south of Grand Marais. Within Grand Marais, the highway follows Lake Avenue through downtown. M-77 intersects H-58 in town and the two designations run concurrently for two blocks. The trunkline continues one block farther north and ends at an intersection with Braziel Street by the Grand Marais harbor; the roadway continues northward as Lake Avenue at that point. Heading north on M-77 midway between Seney and Grand Marais in autumn Grand Marais is situated on the shores of Lake Superior some north of the mainline of the Lake Superior Circle Tour. Since the Tour runs only along state trunklines in Michigan, a Scenic Spur of the tour was created to route traffic north from Seney to Grand Marais. The scenic spur also terminates in Grand Marais with M-77 north of the junction with H-58. M-77 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2009 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-77 were the 1,924 vehicles daily between Floodwood and Ten Curves roads in Schoolcraft county; the lowest counts were the 799 vehicles per day north of M-28 in Seney. No section of M-77 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History The route was first designated by July 1, 1919, with a route very close to its present course. A pair of sharp turns were straightened north of Seney at Lavender Corner around 1950.

Although Bing Crosby made a 1938 Paramount musical called Sing You Sinners, this did not include the title song, according to the IMDb. Popular recordings in 1930 were by The High Hatters (on Victor 22322) and by Smith Ballew and his Orchestra. A good early recording is found on the album \\"The Song Hits of 1930 (Jazz Age Chronicles, Vol. 9)\\", and is sung by The Charleston Chasers. This is, perhaps, the way Coslow and Harling intended it to be performed. A version was released in 1930 by Hit of the Week Records, credited to Harlem Hot Chocolates but actually performed by Duke Ellington and his band. In Britain, the song was recorded by the duo Bob and Alf Pearson. A popular version was recorded by Tony Bennett for Columbia Records (No. CO44125) on July 20, 1950. Bennett also recorded the song on several more occasions. In addition it is featured on Tony Bennett album Duets: An American Classic when he sings it with singer John Legend. Rosemary Clooney included the song on her album Swing Around Rosie (1959). The song is the title track of Erin McKeown's October 24, 2006 album Sing You Sinners. Max Fleischer‚Äôs cartoon ‚ÄúSwing You Sinners!‚Äù (1930) from the Talkartoons series is entirely based on the modified version of this song, ‚ÄúSwing you Sinners‚Äù. The song was used in the 1955 film I'll Cry Tomorrow when it was sung and danced by Susan Hayward and the chorus. It is also heard in a medley montage by Susan Hayward (vocal) and Eddie Albert (piano).

During the 20th century, Australian government policies caused children to be separated from their families, with the intention of assimilating them into White Australian culture. This resulted in what became known as the \\"Stolen Generations\\", with the effects of these traumatic removals being felt by succeeding generations even today. On 26 May 1997, the Bringing Them Home report, the result of a government inquiry into the practice, was tabled in Parliament. The report made many recommendations, including that state and federal governments should issue formal apologies and that funding should be provided to help deal with the consequences of the policies. This date now carries great significance for the Stolen Generations and other Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders, and is also commemorated by many non-Indigenous Australians. The incumbent Prime Minister John Howard refused to apologise, but Kevin Rudd issued a formal apology on behalf of the government and people when he was prime minister, on 13 February 2008. Background and history A commemorative poster from 2008 An older Indigenous protest day is the Day of Mourning, which originated in 1938, focusing on civil rights for Aboriginal people. On 26 May 1997, Bringing them Home: Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families was tabled in Parliament. Among its many recommendations was one that the Prime Minister apologise to the Stolen Generations. Prime Minister John Howard refused to do so, stating that he \\"did not subscribe to the black armband view of history\\". The government policy of removing children from their families and placing them in care elsewhere was later described by American sociologist John Torpey as \\"Aboriginal children separated, often forcibly, from their families in the interest of turning them into white Australians\\". On 26 May 1998, the first National Sorry Day was held. On 26 August 1999, Prime Minister John Howard moved a Motion of Reconciliation, which included an expression of \\"deep and sincere regret that Indigenous Australians suffered injustices under the practices of past generations, and for the hurt and trauma that many Indigenous people continue to feel as a consequence of those practices\\". The opposition leader, Kim Beazley, moved to replace John Howard's motion of regret with an unreserved apology which was not successful. The annual commemorations are intended to raise awareness among politicians, policy makers, and the wider public about the forcible removal policies and their impact on the children who were taken, their families and their communities. On 28 May 2000, more than 250,000 people, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, participated in a walk across Sydney Harbour Bridge, organised by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation to protest the lack of a government apology to Indigenous people, show solidarity and to raise public awareness of the issue. In 2005, the National Sorry Day Committee renamed the day as the National Day of Healing, with the motion tabled in Parliament by Senator Aden Ridgeway. In his words, \\"the day will focus on the healing needed throughout Australian society if we are to achieve reconciliation\\". On 13 February 2008, then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd moved a motion of Apology to Indigenous Australians. His apology was a formal apology on behalf of the successive parliaments and governments whose policies and laws \\"inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss on these our fellow Australians\\". The apology was the new parliament's first order of business; Rudd became the first Australian Prime Minister to publicly apologise to the Stolen Generations on behalf of the Australian federal government. The apology was passed unanimously as a motion by both houses of parliament, as thousands of people gathered to hear the apology both in the Great Hall and outside Parliament House in Canberra and in large gatherings across the country, in schools, offices and public squares.

The municipality is divided into the barrios of Primero, Segundo, Tercero, Cuarto, Quinto y Sexto (part of the city of Manzanillo), as well as the rural communities of Blanquizal, Calicito, Canabacoa, Ca√±o, Ceiba Caridad, Congo, Jibacoa, Palmas Altas, Purial, Remate, Tranquilidad and Zarzal. History Manzanillo was founded in 1784. The settlement was sacked by the French in 1792, and in the following year a fort was built for its protection. In 1833 it received an ayuntamiento (council) and in 1837, for its ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù in not following the lead of Santiago in proclaiming the Spanish Constitution, received from the crown the title of Fiel. In 1827 the port was opened to commerce, national and foreign. It was the site of three battles during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Economy Local agriculture is based on raising coffee, sugarcane, rice, fruit and tobacco crops, as well as honey and cattle. Local industry is composed of sawmills, fish-canning, molasses plants, as well as some cigar and leather goods factories. Zinc and copper deposits are present in the municipality.

The Ka Lae area is registered as a National Historic Landmark District under the name South Point Complex. The area is also known for its strong ocean currents and winds and is the home of a wind farm. Geography The name for the southern tip of the island of Hawaii comes from Ka Lae in the Hawaiian language which means \\"the point\\". It is often spelled as one word, Kalae, or called South Point or South Cape. A confluence of ocean currents just offshore makes this spot one of Hawaii's most popular fishing spots. Both red snapper and ulua are plentiful here. Locals fish from the cliffs, some dangling perilously over the edge of steep lava ledges. Swimming here, however, is not recommended, due to the current. In fact, it is called the \\"Halaea Current\\", named after a chief who was carried off to his death. The confluence of currents also means the area is prone to accumulation of marine debris. Most of this coastline is very remote and difficult to access, and is probably the most debris-littered coast in the state, primarily due to its difficult access for debris removal. This debris poses an entanglement threat to wildlife and may refloat during storms. The shoreline is used by Hawaiian monk seals and hatchling hawksbill turtles, both endangered species. Efforts to clean the coastline are organized by the Hawaii Wildlife Fund in conjunction with the NOAA. Ka Lae is accessible via South Point Road, a 12-mile paved narrow road leading from State Route 11 (Hawaii Belt Road), the turn off being about 7 miles (11 km) west of the village of NƒÅƒÅlehu and east of Ocean View, Hawaii. The strong winds cause some trees to become almost horizontal with their branches all growing in the same direction near the ground. The road forks near its end, with one branch leading south to Ka Lae and the other east to Papakolea Beach, known for its green sand. Ka Lae is the southernmost point in the 50 United States. History=South Point archaeological site Ka Lae is the site of one of the earliest Hawaiian settlements, and it has one of the longest archaeological records on the islands. It is generally thought that this is where the Polynesians first landed because the Big Island is the closest of the Hawaiian Islands to Tahiti, and Ka Lae would be the point of first landfall. Ruins of an ancient Hawaiian temple (heiau) and a fishing shrine can be found here. In addition, ancient Hawaiians drilled numerous holes in the rock ledges to use for mooring their canoes. Tying long ropes to their boats, they would drift out to sea to fish without fear of being carried away by the strong currents. Anthropologists from the Bishop Museum excavated the area in the 1960s. Ka Lae Light On March 5, 1906 a small lighthouse opened at the point. In 1908 about were set aside for the United States Coast Guard to build a house for a keeper. At the request of William Tufts Brigham of the Bishop Museum, care was taken not to destroy the archaeological site. In 1929 a steel tower was built for the light, and in 1972 a new 32 foot (10m) concrete tower with solar power was built. A NOAA Weather Radio transmitter broadcasts weather reports from KBA99 with callsign WWG27 on 162.55 MHz. A weather station also monitors wind speed. Recent history Old Kamaoa wind farm at South Point South Point Light South Point Satellite Station During World War II, the US Air Force built a landing strip called Morse Field on the point. The airfield was closed in 1953. In 1961 South Point was on the list of final sites to be considered by NASA to launch manned rockets to space, but was considered too remote although it was later used to launch sounding rockets for testing of instruments at the Air Force's Maui Space Surveillance Center. The low latitude of the location also made it (and nearby areas that are as remote) attractive as a site for private rocket launches, but these plans were dropped in the face of high costs and local opposition. A space tracking station was operated from 1964 to 1965, and in the 21st century the Swedish Space Corporation's Universal Space Network again established a remote ground station for space tracking and communications, now consisting of two 13-meter parabolic antennas on the east side of South Point Road. Also at Ka Lae are the large shortwave radio antennas of World Harvest Radio International, which used callsign KWHR until 2009. In 1987 the Kamaoa Wind Farm began operation with thirty-seven Mitsubishi 250 kW wind turbines with an operationally typical total peak output of 7.5 MW. By 2006 the turbines at were falling into disrepair, and they were finally shut down on August 15, 2006. At the end of August 2006, components for a new set of wind turbines were transported to South Point. The Pakini Nui project consists of 14 General Electric wind turbines constructed at , about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from the old Kamaoa wind farm. Completed in April 2007, Pakini Nui supplies up to 20.5 MW of power to the island electricity grid of Hawaii Electric Light Company. The wind farm is operated by Tawhiri Power, LLC. Tawhiri Power, LLC It is the southernmost wind farm in the United States. The turbines of the old wind farm have been disassembled. Southernmost point Ka Lae Point is the southernmost point of all fifty states in the United States, but technically it is not the southernmost point in the United States. The southernmost point of all U.S. territory is Rose Atoll, American Samoa. However, Palmyra Atoll contains the southernmost point of all 'incorporated' U.S. territory, according to the doctrine of \\"incorporation\\" defined in the Supreme Court's Insular Cases. Palmyra's south point on Holei Island at 5¬∞52'15\\" N latitude is officially the southernmost point of all incorporated territory of the United States of America.

The highway starts on the west side of Saginaw at an intersection with M-58 and runs north through residential and commercial areas. There are two colleges or universities near the trunkline as it connects Saginaw with Bay City, providing an alternative to the freeway that carries Interstate 75/US Highway 23 (I-75/US 23). The northern terminus is at a pair of intersections with M-25 on the east side of the Saginaw River in Bay City. There have been two other highways to bear the M-84 moniker. The first was one in the Upper Peninsula and the second was in The Thumb area. The current highway was originally part of M-47 until that road was relocated onto what was formerly US 10 in the Tri-Cities area. Since the 1960s reuse of the number, M-84 has been extended in the 1970s to replace part of Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75, now Business Spur I-75, BS I-75) in Bay City. Other projects have reconstructed and widened the roadway through the Bay City area in the early 21st century. Route description M-84 begins at M-58 in a residential area on the west side of Saginaw heading due north on Bay Street. At this point, it is five lanes, with two lanes in each direction and a center turn lane. The highway enters Saginaw Township as Bay Road and serves as a major artery in the area, passing the Fashion Square Mall and several other shopping centers and major retail stores near Tittabawassee Road. The main entrance to Saginaw Valley State University is located on M-84 at Pierce Road just south of the Saginaw‚ÄìBay county line. North of the line, the highway follows West Side Saginaw Road through fields in a less urbanized area. East of University Center and the campus of Delta College, M-84 crosses over I-75/US 23 at exit 160 and proceeds through several curves into Bay City. At the intersection with Euclid Avenue on the city line, M-13 merges in from the north and the two highways run concurrently along Salzburg Avenue. Since this segment of highway is both northbound M-84 and southbound M-13 along eastbound Salzburg Avenue, the two trunklines form a wrong-way concurrency. M-13/M-84 crosses the west channel of the Saginaw River near the Ted Putz Nature Area to Middle Ground island. The highway continues over the east channel on the Lafayette Avenue Bridge, a drawbridge, to Lafayette Avenue on the eastern bank of the river. At the intersection with Broadway Street, M-13 turns southward, and M-84 continues eastward two more blocks. Turning north on Garfield Street, the highway runs parallel to the river through a residential area. North of the 14th Street intersection, Garfield Street curves northeasterly into Washington Avenue, passing to the east of an industrial complex on the river. At the intersection with McKinley Street, a one-way street, M-84 meets the eastbound direction of M-25 and BS I-75. One block north, M-84 terminates at the intersection with 7th Street, which carries westbound M-25 and BS I-75; both intersections also mark BS I-75's terminus immediately east of the Veterans Memorial Bridge. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) maintains M-84 like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic level along M-84 was 26,408 vehicles daily in Saginaw; the lowest count was 8,405 vehicles per day on Washington Street in Bay City. Two sections of M-84 have been listed on the National Highway System; the section from the southern terminus north to Tittabawassee Road in the Saginaw area, and from the I-75/US 23 interchange north to M-25 in the Bay City area. The system is a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History The first M-84 in Michigan was in the Upper Peninsula starting in 1919; the highway ran from Garnet to McLeods Corner, southeast of Newberry, following the current Borgstrom Road in Mackinac County and County Road 393 in Luce County. The highway was replaced by an extension of M-48 in 1926. The M-84 designation was then immediately reused for a section of the former M-31 in The Thumb; it ran from M-81 near Reese running through Fairgrove and Akron to M-29 at Unionville. This iteration was replaced by M-83 in 1930. The I-75/US 10/US 23 freeway was completed between Saginaw and Bay City in late 1960 or early 1961; M-47 was relocated to the former US 10 between Saginaw and Midland, and M-84 was redesignated along the former M-47 between M-81 at Saginaw and the freeway in Bay City. A new BL I-75 was created at the same time along the former M-47 in Bay City. This business loop would be split in half in 1971 resulting in a new business spur; M-84 was extended over the southern section between M-25 and I-75/US 10/US 23. A reconstruction project in 2004‚Äì05 resulted in the roadway being widened to four lanes between Pierce Road in Kochville Township of Saginaw County and Delta Road in Frankenlust Township in Bay County. The 2009 reconstruction resulted in new bridges over I-75 and widening of the road from Delta Road to 2 Mile Road. Additional construction scheduled for 2011 resulted in the widening of the road from 2 Mile to Euclid.

It is the main peak of the Ortler Range. It is the highest point of the Southern Limestone Alps, of South Tyrol in Italy, of Tyrol overall, and, until 1919, of the Austrian-Hungarian empire. In German the mountain is commonly referred to as \\"K√∂nig Ortler\\" (King Ortler), like in the unofficial hymn of South Tyrol, the Bozner Bergsteigerlied. Geography The massive mountain is capped by a glacier on the northwest flank and has a long north ridge that ends at the village of Gomagoi and separates the valleys of Trafoi and Sulden. The South ridge leads to the Hochjoch (3527 m) on the main ridge of the Ortler Alps that forms the border of the Province of Sondrio and South Tyrol. Going west on this main ridge are the Thurwieserspitze (3652) and Trafoier Wall (3565 m), while to the Southeast are the Monte Zebr√π (3740 m) and the majestic K√∂nigspitze (3859 m). From nearby mountains in the northeast the impressive lineup of K√∂nigspitze, Zebru and Ortler is known as ‚Äúdas Dreigestirn‚Äù (the three heavenly bodies). First ascent The Ortler was first climbed by (\\"Pseirer-Josele\\"), a chamois hunter from St. Leonhard in Passeier, and his companions Johann Leitner and Johann Klausner from Zell am Ziller on 27 September 1804. The ascent had been a request of Archduke Johann of Austria, who felt strongly that after the first ascent of the Gro√üglockner (3,798 m) in 1800, the highest mountain in his brother's empire ought to be climbed. The archduke ordered Johannes Nepomuk Gebhard, a \\"mountain official\\" and topographer from Salzburg, to climb the mountain with locals. The first five attempts failed and Gebhard was ready to give up, when Pichler responded to the prize money offered for reaching the peak. Pichler and his friends took a difficult, and because of avalanche danger until recently disused, route over the northwest face from Trafoi. (The route was re-opened in 2004.) Upon their return, the men were not believed on their words alone. Gebhard sent Pichler onto the mountain twice more, first in August 1805 with a flag that could be observed with a telescope from the valley, and again in September 1805 with a huge torch. Only after the torch had been seen burning at night was the accomplishment acknowledged. The route Pichler and his men (two brothers named Hell and an unnamed hunter from Langtaufers) took in 1805 was the currently still popular East ridge (\\"Hintergrat\\", literally \\"back-ridge\\") route. In 1834, at the age of 70, Pichler would make his fifth and final ascent, guiding professor to the top. Notable other ascents and descents Payer house on the North ridge The first time the Ortler was climbed via the easiest and currently normal route, the North (\\"Tabaretta\\") ridge, was more recently, in July 1865, as the approach is rather lengthy. In 1875 a hut was erected 3,029m high on the North ridge, to break up the climb in two steps. It was named the Payer house, after Julius von Payer, who had mapped the Ortler Alps between 1865‚Äì1868 and had climbed 50 of its peaks with as his guide. The first ascent of the South ridge from the Hochjoch followed in 1875, two couloirs on the East face (the Minnigerode and Sch√ºck couloir) were opened in 1878-79 and the two steep Northeast ridges (Marlet and Rothb√∂ck ridge) were conquered in 1889 and 1909, respectively. Members of the Pinggera family were involved in most of these ascents. The 1,200 m high ice route on the Ortler north face, longest in the Eastern Alps, was first climbed in June 1931 by Hans Ertl and and the remote Southwest face in 1934. The North face was soloed first in 1963 by Dieter Drescher who had also added some first winter ascents to his name, including a traverse of K√∂nigspitze, Monte Zebr√π, and Ortler in February 1975. On August 31, 1981, achieved the amazing feat of climbing the north faces of K√∂nigspitze, Zebr√π and Ortler all in one day. Extreme skiing started early in the Ortler mountains, with descending the Sch√ºck couloir in 1971 and the Minnigerode couloir in 1975. On June 24, 1983, skied down the North face. First World War trench in history near the Ortler's peak, 1917 The Ortler Alps were one of the main battlegrounds between Austrian and Italian troops in the First World War, being on the border of Italy and the Austrian Empire. The advantage of owning the highest point was very important. The Austrian troops had quickly occupied the highest peaks, and the Italian troops' main goal, for four years, was to dislodge them from the positions. In the mid-1990s, a mountain guide discovered two guns that had been stationed very near the top of the Ortler but had been hidden by snow ever since. The discovery was kept secret until the 200th anniversary of the first ascent in 2004. The cannons are now on display in a museum in Trafoi.

The Royalists were defeated, losing nearly half their officers and men. Prelude After the execution of Charles I in January 1649, the Scots Covenanters proclaimed his son Charles II king of Scotland. They agreed to restore him to the throne of England, which led to the Third English Civil War; although Oliver Cromwell and the New Model Army won a series of victories over the Scots during the course of 1650, Charles II was crowned at Scone on 1 January 1651. Cromwell decided to focus on Scotland, confident his forces in England could deal with any invasion. On 6 August 1651, Charles crossed into England at the head of a predominantly Scottish Royalist army, heading for Lancashire, an area strongly Royalist in sympathy. He reached Worcester on 22 August 1651, where he halted and awaited English reinforcements before pressing on to London. One of these was a small Royalist contingent of recruits from the Isle of Man and Lancashire commanded by the Earl of Derby. Regular troops under Colonel Robert Lilburne, supported by militia led by Colonel Thomas Birch, were ordered to intercept them before they reached Worcester. Lilburne with a company of foot from Manchester, two more from Chester, and fifty or sixty dragoons marched to Wigan, where the enemy was gathering, hoping to surprise them but found they had moved off to Chorley. The next day, on hearing the Royalists were at Preston, Lilburne set off in pursuit. He bivouacked within two miles of the town and sent out patrols to harass the enemy. The next afternoon they retaliated. \\"A party of the enemy's horse fell smartly amongst us, where our horse was grazing, and for some space put us pretty hard to it: but at the last it pleased the Lord to strengthen us, that we put them to the flight, and pursued them to Ribble bridge (this was something like our business at Mussleburg) and killed and took about thirty prisoners.\\" Lilburne heard Cromwell's regiment of foot was approaching Manchester. Cromwell had detached the regiment with a troop of horse from Rutherford Abbey in Nottinghamshire on the 20th or 21st. Lilburne halted by the Ribble, thinking the foot would join him but though it had marched very rapidly as far as Manchester, Cromwell's regiment was now obliged to advance with caution as Royalists were reported to have 500 men in Manchester. In addition, some of Derby's levies were lying between the regiment and Lilburne. Battle On the 25th, Lilburne received intelligence that the Earl of Derby was marching towards Wigan and assuming his force was retreating gave chase. However, it was Derby's intention to fall on Cromwell's regiment of infantry before Lilburne's cavalry could join it. When Lilburne reached Wigan he found the enemy in considerable force, both infantry and cavalry, marching out of the town towards Manchester. Having arrived ahead of his own infantry and the terrain surrounding the town consisting of fields and hedges with narrow country lanes unfavourable for cavalry, Lilburne determined to avoid a fight. He instead intended to await infantry reinforcements before flanking the Royalists in Wigan, sending his cavalry around the town to the south while his infantry advanced into the town from the north encircling and preventing Derbys retreat from the town. Royalist Commander, the Earl of Derby Derby, aware of Lilburne's inferiority in strength wheeled about and marched back through the town hoping to defeat the Parliamentarian forces piecemeal before they could combine. In spite of the unfavourable nature of the ground Lilburne decided to make a stand. Lilburne deployed part of his cavalry on Wigan Lane and lined the hedgerows either side of the road with dismounted cavalry forming a choke point. As the Royalists approached they were met with a volley of musketry. A fierce fight ensued in the same lanes through which Cromwell had chased the Scots in 1648. Derby divided his cavalry into two equal divisions of 300 men. Derby took command of the vanguard and gave the rear guard command to Sir Thomas Tyldesley. Three times during the day Derby led cavalry charges against the centre of Lilburne's line breaching but failing to break it. By the third charge, the ranks of the Royalists were severely depleted and they were overwhelmed by the superior numbers of Lilburne's arriving infantry, after an hour's fighting the remaining Royalists fled the field. Lord William Witherington, Sir William Throckmorton, Sir Thomas Tyldesley, Colonel Matthew Boynton and 60 others were killed or died of their wounds and 400 prisoners were taken. Cromwell's regiment, which had advanced to join Lilburne but arrived too late to directly participate in the fighting picked up many of the stragglers from the rout. Derby escaped badly wounded, and joined Charles at Worcester with only 30 horsemen. Aftermath The defeat was a blow to the king as this was the only English Royalist force of any size to attempt to ride to his standard in Worcester. Without large numbers of English Royalists to support him, his position was untenable and nine days later his predominantly Scottish army of about 15,000 men was decisively beaten at the Battle of Worcester by a Parliamentary army nearly twice the size under the command of Cromwell. This victory brought to an end Third English Civil War and ushered in nine years of republican rule. Charles escaped to France and lived in exile until his return at the Restoration in 1660. On the Isle of Man, the impact of the Royalist loss was also significant as few of the 170 men conscripted from the local population returned home. David Craine, in Manannan's Isle states that \\"those who did not fall in the fighting [were] hunted to their death through the countryside.\\" Such a loss was certainly a multiple of the islands normal mortality rate during this period.

It was this, together with the disappointment of not obtaining the throne, which led Cleonymus to invite Pyrrhus to Sparta in 272.

Of Domenico Scarlatti's 555 keyboard sonatas, G major is the home key for 69, or about 12.4%, sonatas. In the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, \\"G major is often a key of chain rhythms\\", according to Alfred Einstein,Alfred Einstein, Mozart, His Character, His Work, Chapter 10, \\"Mozart's Choice Of Keys\\" although Bach also used the key for some -based works, including his third and fourth Brandenburg Concertos. Pianist Jeremy Denk observes that the Goldberg Variations are 80 minutes in G major.Why I hate the Goldberg Variations Classical era Twelve of Joseph Haydn's 106 symphonies are in G major. Likewise, one of Haydn's most famous piano trios, No. 39 (with the Gypsy Rondo), and one of his last two complete published string quartets (Op. 77, No. 1), are in G major. In addition, G major is the home key of Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik, serving as the tonic for three of its four movements (the exception being the second movement, titled Romanze which is in the subdominant key). However, almost none of his large-scale works such as his symphonies or concertos are in this key; exceptions are the Piano Concerto No. 17, Flute Concerto No. 1 and his String Quartet No. 14, along with some examples among his juvenilia.

An electronic component is any basic discrete device or physical entity in an electronic system used to affect electrons or their associated fields. Electronic components are mostly industrial products, available in a singular form and are not to be confused with electrical elements, which are conceptual abstractions representing idealized electronic components. Electronic components have a number of electrical terminals or leads. These leads connect to other electrical components, often over wire, to create an electronic circuit with a particular function (for example an amplifier, radio receiver, or oscillator). Basic electronic components may be packaged discretely, as arrays or networks of like components, or integrated inside of packages such as semiconductor integrated circuits, hybrid integrated circuits, or thick film devices. The following list of electronic components focuses on the discrete version of these components, treating such packages as components in their own right. Classification Components can be classified as passive, active, or electromechanic. The strict physics definition treats passive components as ones that cannot supply energy themselves, whereas a battery would be seen as an active component since it truly acts as a source of energy. However, electronic engineers who perform circuit analysis use a more restrictive definition of passivity. When only concerned with the energy of signals, it is convenient to ignore the so-called DC circuit and pretend that the power supplying components such as transistors or integrated circuits is absent (as if each such component had its own battery built in), though it may in reality be supplied by the DC circuit. Then, the analysis only concerns the AC circuit, an abstraction that ignores DC voltages and currents (and the power associated with them) present in the real-life circuit. This fiction, for instance, lets us view an oscillator as \\"producing energy\\" even though in reality the oscillator consumes even more energy from a DC power supply, which we have chosen to ignore. Under that restriction, we define the terms as used in circuit analysis as: * Active components rely on a source of energy (usually from the DC circuit, which we have chosen to ignore) and usually can inject power into a circuit, though this is not part of the definition.For instance, a computer could be contained inside a black box with two external terminals. It might do various calculations and signal its results by varying its resistance, but always consuming power as a resistance does. Nevertheless, it's an active component, since it relies on a power source to operate. Active components include amplifying components such as transistors, triode vacuum tubes (valves), and tunnel diodes. * Passive components can't introduce net energy into the circuit. They also can't rely on a source of power, except for what is available from the (AC) circuit they are connected to. As a consequence they can't amplify (increase the power of a signal), although they may increase a voltage or current (such as is done by a transformer or resonant circuit). Passive components include two-terminal components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, and transformers. * Electromechanical components can carry out electrical operations by using moving parts or by using electrical connections Most passive components with more than two terminals can be described in terms of two-port parameters that satisfy the principle of reciprocity‚Äîthough there are rare exceptions.Nonreciprocal passive devices include the gyrator (though as a truly passive component, this exists more in theoretical terms, and is usually implemented using an active circuit)‚Äîand the circulator, which is used at microwave and optical frequencies In contrast, active components (with more than two terminals) generally lack that property. Active components= Semiconductors  Transistors = Transistors were considered the invention of the twentieth century that changed electronic circuits forever.

Dick, first published in Galaxy Science Fiction magazine, October 1954.  Plot summary The story is set on a separatist Earth colony where the society is becoming dominated by mutants with psionic abilities. The colony is protected from Earth by an enormously powerful but infantile mutant called Big Noodle. The central character is a precog, Curtis or Curt, who uncovers the existence of 'anti-psi's' - humans with the ability to cancel out or nullify the powers of the psionic mutants. He attempts to get the non-psychic or 'Norm'-led government to officially recognize the anti-psi's, knowing that this could balance out the corrupting power that the psi's would soon possess over the rest of humanity. He is thwarted, however, by the powerful psi Corps of mutants, who murder his anti-psi lover, Patricia Ann Connley or Pat. Curt has a young son, Tim, who, though seemingly a somewhat autistic, untalented 'norm', is actually the ultimate precog. This is due to both his ability to travel in time and his power to change the course of events as well. In the end, an older Tim appears to his father from the future, telling him that he was right about the need to balance the power of the psi's. His compassion for his father in the wake of Curt's recent loss compels him to alter the timeline in a very specific way.  Notes  *Dick very much disliked the insistence of people like John W. Campbell, that stories should positively portray psionics (beings with extrasensory powers as telepathy, telekinesis and precognition). This story was one of his replies, showing the price of these talents, and the distorted personalities that could result - chiefly through the perspective of a withdrawn little boy. *The character of Tim is a precursor to Manfred Steiner, a character in Dicks's 1964 novel, Martian Time-Slip. It is one of four of his short stories to be expanded into a novel. *Philip K. Dick's 1969 novel Ubik contained characters who were anti-psis, one of whom shares the name Patricia Conley.

It has grown recently as a dormitory settlement for Cambridge. History=Village Waterbeach is on the Car Dyke, a Roman waterway whose course can be traced as far as Lincoln. Recent archaeological investigations have found extensive evidence of Roman settlement at the south end of the village. Waterbeach appears in the 1086 Domesday Book as Utbech. In the 12th century, the Knights Templar occupied Denny Abbey to the north of the village, one of several Scheduled Ancient Monuments, which houses the Farmland Museum. Also scheduled are the site of Waterbeach Abbey, to the south of the present church, and a stretch of the Car Dyke. The lawyer/politician John Yaxley acquired an estate at Waterbeach by 1610 and lived there. He and Edward Aungier of Cambridge purchased the manors of Waterbeach and Causeway from the Crown for ¬£900 in 1614.History of Parliament Retrieved 9 July 2017. RAF and British Army A Royal Air Force station, RAF Waterbeach, was built on the northern edge of the village in 1940, for the RAF Bomber Command. After the Second World War, the station was operated by RAF Transport Command and then by RAF Fighter Command until 1966, when the site transferred to the Royal Engineers and became Waterbeach Barracks. The small Museum has closed, but its collection has been saved and put in storage. The barracks closed on 28 March 2013, after a move by all the remaining Army units to RAF Kinloss in Scotland and to RAF Wittering in 2012‚Äì2013. The site is being used to provide 6,000‚Äì10,000 new homes. Today St John's Church Waterbeach has expanded in recent years along with the economic growth in the region. It has increasingly become a dormitory for Cambridge. The village has several shops and businesses. There is a small industrial estate at the edge of the village and several small companies have premises in the village itself. Waterbeach Community Primary School has some 300 pupils. Adjacent to it is Waterbeach Independent Lending Library. An Anglican Church of St John the Evangelist, a Baptist church famous for its ties with Charles Haddon Spurgeon,Waterbeach Baptist Church, History and a corps of the Salvation Army are present in the village. Active community groups include Scouts and Girl Guides, the Army Cadet Force, playgroups and a play scheme, and a Community Association. The Denny End industrial estate and Cambridge Innovation Park accommodate businesses such as the Milton Brewery and A&R; Cambridge Ltd. To the south-east is a Woodland Trust nature area called Cow Hollow Wood, created in 2000 to mark the Millennium. Transport Waterbeach railway station is on the Fen Line between Cambridge and Kings Lynn. The village lies close to the busy London‚ÄìKing's Lynn A10 road. The village has a bus service linking it to Cambridge and to the towns of March, Wisbech and Littleport and the city of Ely. A proposal to move the railway station closer to the development at the Barracks was approved by the local planning committee in 2018. An Ordnance Survey map of the 1920s shows an agricultural tramway running north from Clay's Farm on Joist Fen to Middle Farm, between the railway and the River Cam, opposite the ferry to Upware. Notable people In birth order: *Richard Jugge (died 1577), the Royal Printer generally credited with inventing the footnote, was probably born in Waterbeach. *Robert Masters (1719‚Äì1798), a writer, historian and cleric, served as Rector of Waterbeach in 1775‚Äì1784. *William Keatinge Clay (1797‚Äì1867), an antiquary and cleric, served as Rector of Waterbeach from 1854 until his death in 1867. *Charles Haddon Spurgeon (1797‚Äì1867), the eventual Baptist Pastor of London's Metropolitan Tabernacle, served first at Waterbeach Baptist Church, when he was 17 years old. *David Stafford-Clark (1916‚Äì1999), a psychiatrist, poet and author, served with the RAF Bomber Command at Waterbeach during World War II. *Terry Hale (born 1936), a player for Cambridgeshire County Cricket Club (1957‚Äì1978), was born in Waterbeach.

Kleombrotos sent into Exile by Leonidas II, Oil on canvas, Benjamin West, c. 1768. Leonidas II (; , Le≈çn√≠das B', \\"Lion's son, Lion- like\\"), was the 28th Agiad King of Sparta from 254 to 235 BC. Biography Leonidas II was raised at the Seleucid court, and according to Plutarch's Life of Agis IV, he married a Persian woman. According to other sources, this non- Spartan wife was actually a Seleucid, possibly the daughter of Seleucus I Nicator by his Persian wife Apama. She was therefore not fully Persian, but half-Macedonian and half-Persian. His Persian-influenced lifestyle, his non- Spartan (therefore foreign) wife and his half-Spartan children would all be made issues by the ephor Lysander, the co-king Agis IV and their supporters. Leonidas II opposed the attempted reforms of his Eurypontid co-king, Agis IV. The ephor, Lysander, claimed to have seen a sign from the gods against Leonidas, and Leonidas fled to avoid his trial. In his absence, Leonidas was deposed from the throne and replaced by his son-in-law, Cleombrotus II. He later returned to Sparta while Agis was on campaign in Aetolia and deposed and exiled Cleombrotus II, and reclaimed his throne. Soon after, he deposed and executed Agis IV alongside his mother Agesistrate and grandmother Archidamia. Family He was the father of three children by his wife Cratesiclea,Sarah B.

His son Cleomenes III eventually succeeded him, having been married at age 18 to Agiatis (d. 224 BC), widow of Agis IV, the Eurypontid king; they had at least one son together who died in Egypt with his grandmother. His daughter Chilonis was married to Cleombrotus II who replaced his father-in-law as king for some time.

She first appeared in the 2002 video game Guilty Gear X2 as a boss. In the series, I-No is a servant of That Man‚Äîthe series' main antagonist. She fights with an electric guitar, and she also wears a sentient witch's hat that can fire projectiles. Video game reviewers have commented on her sex appeal, with some of them also remarking her winning pose as well as her clothes and electric guitar. Her fighting abilities and the difficulty to defeat her as a boss have also been noted by critics. Appearances I-No was first introduced in the third installment of the series, Guilty Gear X2 (2002), where she appears as the primary antagonist and final boss. She carries with her an electric guitar nicknamed that she uses to fight both using it as a bludgeon and playing it to create deadly sonic waves, and she also fights with her hat that can shoot projectiles out of a secret hole. I-No is one of That Man's servants, and she appears in every character's storyline, manipulating them against each other‚Äîfor example, she gives fake bounty lists with the name of the people her master wants to kill, consisting entirely of other cast members, to Jam Kuradoberi and Bridget. As she works for personal gain instead of being only a puppet, in Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus (2008), she arouses insecurity in That Man who uses Anji Mito to capture her, eventually succeeding. She has three possible endings: she is captured by That Man and Raven to be punished, and she argues she only wanted to remove those who stood in her boss' way, but her master says that they're beneficial to what he has in mind for the world; she fights and defeats Dizzy and May, either subsequently becoming overwhelmed by Dizzy's power, and kidnapping May; or she is defeated by Baiken, being stabbed repeatedly, thus leading to her death. I-No is a playable character in Guilty Gear Xrd (2014), where she worked for That Man and became associated with Axl Low. I-No is also a playable character in the spin-off games Guilty Gear Isuka (2003), Dust Strikers (2006), and Judgment (2006). Reception In a 2013 poll conducted by Arc System Works, I-No was voted as the 20th most popular character from the series. IGN named I-No their \\"first-favorite new character design\\" from Guilty Gear X2. GameDaily ranked I-No thirteenth on their \\"Top 25 Most Bizarre Fighting Characters\\", repeating the sentiment in a later article series called \\"Babe of Week\\", featuring her in \\"Asian Beauties\\" and \\"Guilty Gear Babes\\". Complex placed the boss battle with I-No in Guilty Gear X2 #Reload as the fourteenth coolest boss battle of all time, saying she is not a hard boss \\"but the fact that she fights with a blue guitar is pretty amazing\\", and along with her stage, the hell above the clouds, \\"you have one epic boss battle.\\" They also elected I-No as the twenty-sixth \\"hottest video game character\\", and ranked her at thirty-sixth place on the list of \\"The 50 Most Dominant Fighting Game Characters\\", where they commented \\"She fought with an electric guitar. Her cleavage was godlike. She cut you with a guitar extension cord. She got half naked when she won. 'Nuff said.\\" Destructoid included I-No on it \\"Badass of the Month\\", and described her as a combination of \\"[s]exy and deadly\\", adding \\"[w]e've seen it for years with characters like Morrigan and Chun-Li [...], but no one captured it quite like I-No, who induced many a people into chucking their controllers in frustration\\". They also noted the difficult defeat her in the game, saying \\"she is a total nightmare to fight against.\\" Joystiq ranked her first on their \\"top ten girls of PSP\\", noting her guitar is very appreciated by fans and that it makes her sexier. UGO Networks ranked her finish move as the third \\"Most Gruesome Finishing Move\\" in video game's history, also including I-No in their \\"Hot Girls We Wish Were Real\\" list at the fourteenth place. Joystiq's Jordan Mallory said her top removal victory pose \\"conjures up nostalgic memories of after-school\\" while GameDaily described it as \\"quite a reward in the game\\". On other hand, she was mentioned by 1UP.com as one of Guilty Gears \\"goofy characters\\" along with Faust and Millia. Marlene I-No's primary weapon of choice is a guitar she calls \\"Marlene\\", which she uses as a blunt object to bludgeon her opponents. This guitar is actually a direct replica of Duesenberg Guitars company's \\"Starplayer TV\\" (also known as \\"Starplayer II\\") real-life guitar model, though it was reinforced with such materials as titanium and aerospace-grade aluminum so that Marlene would be able to withstand such actions as heavy impacts when I-No is hitting her opponents or when this guitar is being directly smashed against the ground. The name \\"Marlene\\" that I-No gave to her beloved guitar is actually based on the German actress and singer Marlene Dietrich, as well as also being a direct nod to the musician Shiina Yumiko (since she has a guitar named \\"Dietrich\\" that is actually a Duesenberg Guitars' \\"Starplayer II/TV\\" model as well, down to them both even being of exactly same \\"surf green\\" color, and I-No's overall visual design was heavily based on Shiina Yumiko's choice of hairstyle and stage performing clothes during early years of her career).

Announced as The Commodore Gazette, the Gazette was a Commodore-only daughter magazine of the computer hobbyist magazine Compute!. It was first published in July 1983. An example of MLX type-in program code Compute!'s Gazette contained both standard articles and type-in programs. Many of these programs were quite sophisticated and lengthy. To assist in entry, Gazette published several utilities. The Automatic Proofreader provided checksum capabilities for BASIC programs, while machine language listings could be entered with MLX. Starting in May 1984, a companion disk containing all the programs from each issue was available to subscribers for an extra fee. Perhaps Gazettes most popular and enduring type-in application was the SpeedScript word processor. A monthly column entitled The VIC Magician by Michael Tomczyk presented BASIC programming tips and tricks for the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore 64. Gazette was reportedly profitable from its first issue, but towards the end of the 1980s, the magazine's size steadily decreased due to the increasing switch from 8-bit to 16-bit home computers. The last stand-alone issue of Compute!'s Gazette was published with cover date June 1990. At that point, the Compute! brand, including Gazette, was sold to the publishers of Omni and Penthouse. After a three-month publication hiatus, Gazette restarted publication, this time as an insert into the newly consolidated (and renamed) Compute (October 1990 issue) rather than as a separate magazine. It continued in this vein until December 1993, after which it switched to a disk-only format. Due to the declining Commodore userbase, publication ceased entirely after February 12, 1995.

Life and career Stanley Clements was born in Long Island, New York. Young Stan realized that he wanted a show-business career while he was in grammar school, and after he graduated from Brooklyn's PS 49 in 1938, for the next two years he toured in vaudeville and found work in radio. He then joined the touring company of the Major Bowes Amateur Hour. His career stalled in 1940, and Clements was reduced to panhandling for a time to survive. In 1941, he was signed to a contract by 20th Century Fox and appeared in juvenile/teen roles in several B films for the studio. East Side Kids In 1942 he was loaned to Monogram Pictures and landed a recurring role as \\"Stash\\" in the ensemble cast film series, the East Side Kids. He appeared as an East Side Kid in Smart Alecks, 'Neath Brooklyn Bridge, and Ghosts on the Loose. Clements also appeared as a character named Stash in a few films unrelated to the East Side Kids, such as Right to the Heart, 1950's Military Academy with That Tenth Avenue Gang, and Boots Malone. Marriage In August 1945, Clements married actress Gloria Grahame, who played bad girl Violet Bick in It's a Wonderful Life, and who later won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for The Bad and The Beautiful. The marriage was a stormy one, with Grahame objecting to Clements's drinking and gambling, and Clements being jealous of her dalliances with other men, and it ended in 1948. He married Maria Walek in 1951, and in 1964 they adopted her then eight-year-old nephew, Sylvester, bringing him to the United States from Poland. Other roles After the East Side Kids, Clements then set out on his own again, this time landing roles in more prestigious pictures. He was featured in perhaps his best-known role as teenage street-tough-turned-choirboy \\"Tony Scaponi\\" in the 1944 Bing Crosby hit Going My Way, and scored a great success as a jockey in the 1945 Alan Ladd feature Salty O'Rourke. Clements's acting career was interrupted by US Army service just after World War II, and when he returned in 1947, he began appearing in more adult roles in lower-budgeted films, including Johnny Holiday (cast against type as a psychopath) and Destination Murder (as a hired killer). He starred in a series of action/detective pictures at the successor to Monogram Pictures, Allied Artists, for producer Ben Schwalb and director Edward Bernds. The Bowery Boys In 1945 after Leo Gorcey left the East Side Kids in a contract dispute with producer Sam Katzman, Gorcey's teammate Bobby Jordan arranged a meeting with his agent, Jan Grippo. Gorcey partnered with Grippo to produce a new \\"gang\\" series called The Bowery Boys, with Gorcey owning a 40% share in the franchise. Gorcey's real- life father Bernard Gorcey was added to the cast as Louie Dumbrowski, proprietor of Louie's Sweet Shop, the headquarters of The Bowery Boys. Younger brother David Gorcey became one of the gang members. After Bernard Gorcey was killed in an auto accident in 1955, a grief-stricken Leo Gorcey turned to alcohol for solace and became a disruptive presence in the studio during the filming of Crashing Las Vegas, trashing scenery and destroying props. In 1956 Gorcey demanded a larger share of ownership from Allied Artists, which was denied, and after a heated conversation, Gorcey stormed off the studio lot and quit the series. When the series's then-producer Ben Schwalb needed a replacement for Gorcey, he asked Stanley Clements to step in as The Bowery Boys' new ringleader, Stanislaus \\"Duke\\" Coveleskie (although Huntz Hall received top billing). Clements comfortably settled into the role of Huntz Hall's sidekick, and co-starred in the final seven Bowery Boys comedies, beginning with Fighting Trouble. Later career and death Following the end of The Bowery Boys franchise in 1958, Clements went on to a steady career of supporting roles in film and television. In 1960 Clements appeared as Clyde Simpson in the TV western Tales of Wells Fargo starring Dale Robertson in the episode \\"Doc Dawson.\\" He appeared in a 1962 episode, \\"The Craziest Race in Town,\\" of the adventure drama series Straightaway. One of his last jobs was an appearance in a nationally advertised commercial for Pringle's potato chips. Clements co-wrote the 1958 film Devil's Partner that was not released until 1961. On October 16, 1981, Stanley Clements died at age 55 from emphysema in Pasadena, California, 11 days after the passing of his first wife Gloria Grahame. He is buried at Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California.

Since neutrons have no electric charge, they can enter a nucleus more easily than positively charged protons, which are repelled electrostatically. Neutron capture plays an important role in the cosmic nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. In stars it can proceed in two ways: as a rapid (r-process) or a slow process (s-process). Nuclei of masses greater than 56 cannot be formed by thermonuclear reactions (i.e. by nuclear fusion), but can be formed by neutron capture. Neutron capture on protons yields a line at 2.223 MeV predicted and commonly observed in solar flares.  Neutron capture at small neutron flux  Decay scheme of 198Au At small neutron flux, as in a nuclear reactor, a single neutron is captured by a nucleus. For example, when natural gold (197Au) is irradiated by neutrons (n), the isotope 198Au is formed in a highly excited state, and quickly decays to the ground state of 198Au by the emission of gamma rays (Œ≥). In this process, the mass number increases by one. This is written as a formula in the form 197Au+n ‚Üí 198Au+Œ≥, or in short form 197Au(n,Œ≥)198Au. If thermal neutrons are used, the process is called thermal capture. The isotope 198Au is a beta emitter that decays into the mercury isotope 198Hg. In this process the atomic number rises by one.  Neutron capture at high neutron flux  The r-process happens inside stars if the neutron flux density is so high that the atomic nucleus has no time to decay via beta emission in between neutron captures. The mass number therefore rises by a large amount while the atomic number (i.e., the element) stays the same. When further neutron capture is no longer possible, the highly unstable nuclei decay via many Œ≤‚àí decays to beta-stable isotopes of higher-numbered elements. Capture cross section The absorption neutron cross section of an isotope of a chemical element is the effective cross sectional area that an atom of that isotope presents to absorption, and is a measure of the probability of neutron capture. It is usually measured in barns (b). Absorption cross section is often highly dependent on neutron energy. As a generality, the likelihood of absorption is proportional to the time the neutron is in the vicinity of the nucleus. The time spent in the vicinity of the nucleus is inversely proportional to the relative velocity between the neutron and nucleus. Other more specific issues modify this general principle. Two of the most commonly specified measures are the cross section for thermal neutron absorption, and resonance integral which considers the contribution of absorption peaks at certain neutron energies specific to a particular nuclide, usually above the thermal range, but encountered as neutron moderation slows the neutron down from an original high energy. The thermal energy of the nucleus also has an effect; as temperatures rise, Doppler broadening increases the chance of catching a resonance peak. In particular, the increase in uranium-238's ability to absorb neutrons at higher temperatures (and to do so without fissioning) is a negative feedback mechanism that helps keep nuclear reactors under control.  Thermochemical significance  Neutron capture is involved in the formation of isotopes of chemical elements. As a consequence of this fact the energy of neutron capture intervenes in the standard enthalpy of formation of isotopes.  Uses  Neutron activation analysis can be used to remotely detect the chemical composition of materials. This is because different elements release different characteristic radiation when they absorb neutrons. This makes it useful in many fields related to mineral exploration and security. Neutron absorbers Neutron cross section of boron (top curve is for 10B and bottom curve for 11B) The most important neutron absorber is 10B as 10B4C in control rods, or boric acid as a coolant water additive in PWRs. Other important neutron absorbers that are used in nuclear reactors are xenon, cadmium, hafnium, gadolinium, cobalt, samarium, titanium, dysprosium, erbium, europium, molybdenum and ytterbium;Prompt Gamma-ray Neutron Activation Analysis. International Atomic Energy Agency all of which usually consist of mixtures of various isotopes‚Äîsome of which are excellent neutron-absorbers. These also occur in combinations such as Mo2B5, hafnium diboride, titanium diboride, dysprosium titanate and gadolinium titanate. Hafnium, one of the last stable elements to be discovered, presents an interesting case. Even though hafnium is a heavier element, its electron configuration makes it practically identical with the element zirconium, and they are always found in the same ores. However, their nuclear properties are different in a profound way. Hafnium absorbs neutrons avidly (Hf absorbs 600 times more than Zr), and it can be used in reactor control rods, whereas natural zirconium is practically transparent to neutrons. So, zirconium is a very desirable construction material for reactor internal parts, including the metallic cladding of the fuel rods which contain either uranium, plutonium, or mixed oxides of the two elements (MOX fuel). Hence, it is quite important to be able to separate the zirconium from the hafnium in their naturally occurring alloy. This can only be done inexpensively by using modern chemical ion-exchange resins. Similar resins are also used in reprocessing nuclear fuel rods, when it is necessary to separate uranium and plutonium, and sometimes thorium.

It is a \\"trans-peninsular\\" highway in that it travels through an agricultural area from Bay Port on Saginaw Bay to Harbor Beach on Lake Huron. The current trunkline in Huron County was originally parts of other state highways that date back to the initial 1919 signposting of the state highway system in the state. The designation was applied in 1939, and the road has remained unchanged since it was completely paved in the 1950s. One other highway, near Lake City, carried the number in the 1930s. Route description M-142 begins just a few miles south of Bay Port at an intersection with M-25 near the Bay Port Cemetery, about two-thirds of a mile (1.1 km) inland from Saginaw Bay. From there, the road travels eastward through farm country on Pigeon Road. The highway follows a direct course over the Pigeon River to the village of Pigeon, when M-142 turns south on Main Street to exit town. South of town, the Pigeon Road name resumes, and after about , M-142 turns back eastward near the Grand Lawn Cemetery. The road then continues eastward through more farms to Elkton, diverting off a direct course to cross a line of the Huron and Eastern Railway on the east side of town. North of Bad Axe, M-142 leaves Pigeon Road to turn southward along Van Dyke Road for about mile and a half (2.4 km). Along this section, the highway runs concurrently with M-53 into town. At the intersection with Huron Avenue, M-142 turns east and M-53 turns west, ending the overlap of the two highways. M-142 exits town and follows Sand Beach Road through farm country. About of Bad Axe, M-142 meets the northern terminus of M-19 (Ubly Road). Continuing eastward, the highway crosses two branches of the Willow River as it passes through the unincorporated community of Verona. East of that location, the trunkline turns northeasterly, roughly parallel to the Rock Falls Creek, as it angles to Harbor Beach. M-142 follows State Street through town, and the trunkline terminates at the intersection with M-25 about a quarter mile (0.4 km) west of Lake Huron. Like other state highways in Michigan, M-142 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 8,887 vehicles used the highway daily in the city of Bad Axe east of M-53 and 832 vehicles did so each day between M-25 and Pigeon, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. No section of M-142 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History=Previous designation The first highway to gain the M-142 moniker was designated by the end of 1929 running eastward from M-55/M-66 to a farm owned by Michigan State College (now Michigan State University) south of Lake City. By 1939, this highway was transferred back to local control. Current highway When the state highway system was first signed in 1919, one of the original trunklines was numbered M-31, originally running northward from Port Huron to Harbor Beach and then westward to Saginaw. When the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926, M-31 was decommissioned in favor of alternate numbers. The roadway between Bay Port and Harbor Beach was assigned the M-83 designation; Between Bay Port and Bad Axe, the highway was also a part of the contemporary M-29. By 1933, the M-29 designation was removed when that highway was realigned to follow the Saginaw Bay shoreline and later became parts of an extended US Highway 25 (US 25) and a new M-25. In 1939, a section of M-83 was returned to local control, which would have resulted in a discontinuous routing. Segments of the trunkline were absorbed into other existing highways. The former routing of M-83 from Bay Port, eastward across The Thumb, to Harbor Beach where it met up with US 25 was redesignated M-142. By early 1952, the last section of the highway was paved, stretching about eastward from the M-19 junctionMichigan State Highway Department (April 15, 1952). 1952 Official Highway Map (Map).

It is believed to be one of the oldest ballgames and was an unofficial demonstration sport at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. The score is similar to tennis. The first team scoring six games wins the match. Rules The major Frisian handball tournament, called the P.C. (short for Permanent Committee), has been held in the city of Franeker since 1854 and is considered the oldest regular sports tournament in the world. Frisian handball is played on a rectangular lawn of 61 meters by 32 meters, by two teams composed of 3 players. In the center of one short side of the field is a receiving zone of 5 meters by 19 meters defended by 2 players, the other team member remaining field player. One of the opponents serves the hard leather ball with his bare hand from a serving box at about 30 meters from the receiving zone. If he does not succeed in reaching the receiving zone, the receiving team gets a direct score. When the receiving team, of which the players are allowed to wear a single hardened leather glove, returns the ball over the short line behind the serving box (called the upper line, in West Frisian boppe) they also get a direct score. Of course, the serving team is allowed to prevent this happening by hitting or holding the ball before the upper line. The place where the ball remains after such a rally is marked with a small woodblock called a kaats, which is best defined as an undecided score. When two such undecided points occur (or one, if one of the teams is on game point) the teams change places. In the next rally, the team that then has the receiving position, tries to hit the ball past the first kaats and, if any, in the next rally past the second kaats, so deciding the undecided points. Then they start all over again. In parts of Belgium, the similar game of jeu de balle-pelote is played. This game is played by teams of 5 players on a trapezium shaped field, mostly located on marketplaces.

The show is about a rich Manhattan couple, Oliver and Lisa Douglas, who decide to buy and run a farm in the eccentric and surreal town of Hooterville. Hank Kimball (played by Alvy Moore) is an unusual, perhaps unique, comic creation. He is friendly and eager-to-please, but he is highly scatterbrained and appears to have been educated beyond his intelligence. He has an unusual self-correcting manner where he makes a statement, then qualifies it, then corrects it, then corrects it further, and finally loses track of what he was saying entirely. The Encyclopedia of Television states that Kimball \\"personifies a kind of infinite regress, where every empirical statement branches into multiple statements that in turn preclude it, spiraling each new observation back and away from itself like an inductive Escherism.\\" Encyclopedia of Television Newcomb, Horace ed. p. 1030 Hank Kimball was a more straightforward character when Green Acres first began. Over the course of the first season, however, he gradually changes into a scatterbrained flake who cannot seem to remember anything, unless, as Oliver Douglas figures out, you specifically tell him not to remember it. He frequently forgets Oliver's name while he is talking to him and has to ask him his name. Although Kimball is supposedly a farming expert, his advice is usually worthless. For example, in one episode, Oliver has children visiting his farm from New York City. He lets each one plant a small garden. Kimball comes and tells them he is the county agent and can tell them anything they would like to know about farming. A child asks how seeds know what to grow into.

India In India, the Bachelor of Information Technology is a 4-year degree course. The course is divided into eight semesters, and the degree is awarded after completion of a four-year program. The degree is conferred by government and private institutions, as well as a host of other prestigious institutes (both public and privately funded) for their professional engineering programs. However, most other institutions in India use the Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.)/Bachelor of Engineering (BE) in IT degrees. Admission to the program is done through a nationwide entrance test. There is also a three-year course which awards a B.Sc degree at the end of the program. Some universities even offer a B.Sc IT course either through regular programs or through distance-learning courses. However, there is not much as demand for the B.Sc. course as there is for the B.Tech or BE IT courses.

History Built in 1998 due to the instrumental work of Pennsylvania Governor Robert P. Casey, Sr. and his successor, Tom Ridge, due to the dedication and support of State Representative Kevin Blaum, and built on land given by the Greater Wilkes- Barre Chamber, the arena was originally named the Northeastern Pennsylvania Civic Arena and Convention Center. In 2000, the naming rights were sold to First Union Bank, becoming First Union Arena, until the summer of 2003, when First Union Bank merged into Wachovia, at which point it became Wachovia Arena at Casey Plaza. On January 20, 2010, the arena became Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza, as part of a 10-year naming rights contract with the Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs racetrack and casino. It has been home to the Wilkes- Barre/Scranton Penguins, of the AHL since 1999, and the former home of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Pioneers, of the AF2 League. In January 2012 it was planned to be the home to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Shamrocks of the North American Lacrosse League, but the league had folded. Recognition and events The Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza has been recognized by many entertainment magazines as one of the best in the country for arenas under 10,000 in capacity, especially for its attendance and ease of show setup and teardown. The Penguins hold the American Hockey League record for most sellouts in a season, selling out all 40 home games in 2002‚Äì2003 and 2003‚Äì2004, and ran a streak of 90 consecutive sellouts between March 2002 and October 2004, and 54 from December 2000 to February 2002. Panoramic View Other than Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins hockey games, other events that occur at the arena include circus performances, an annual Christmas-time Trans-Siberian Orchestra performance, professional ice-skating shows, Harlem Globetrotters, and the annual graduation ceremonies for nearby Crestwood High School, Penn Foster High School, King's College, University of Scranton, Luzerne County Community College, and Marywood University. The arena has regularly hosted professional wrestling since 2000. The first event was WCW Monday Nitro on January 31, 2000. The first WWE live event was on July 16, 2000 and headlined by The Undertaker vs. Kurt Angle. The arena also hosted the 2007 WWE Draft on June 11, 2007 which was the final WWE Monday Night Raw appearance for the late Chris Benoit. On November 15, 2016, the arena hosted the 900th episode of WWE Smackdown which saw the return of The Undertaker. Some notable concerts include Bob Dylan, The Dead, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Foo Fighters, Elton John, Cher, and The Eagles. Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus performed its last elephant show in its \\"Red\\" tour on May 1st, 2016, a year before the circus itself closed. On October 9, 2003, the New York Knicks and New Jersey Nets played a preseason game at the arena.  Political events  George W. Bush held a rally for re-election to the office of the president at the arena in 2004. The arena has hosted multiple Donald Trump events, with the first being a rally on April 25, 2016 during his run in the 2016 election. He held another rally on October 10, 2016. Trump later returned as president on August 2, 2018 to assist in Lou Barletta's campaign for Senate.

Tucker, The funding of scientific racism: Wickliffe Draper and the Pioneer Fund, University of Illinois Press, 2002, pg. 2 It covers physical and cultural anthropology, including human evolution, intelligence, ethnography, linguistics, mythology, and archaeology. It is published by the Ulster Institute for Social Research, which is presided over by Richard Lynn.  History  The journal was established in 1960 with funding from segregationists, who designed it to serve as a mouthpiece for their views. The costs of initially launching the journal were paid by the Pioneer Fund's Wickliffe Draper. The founders were Robert Gayre, Henry Garrett, Roger Pearson, Corrado Gini, Luigi Gedda (Honorary Advisory Board), Otmar von Verschuer and Reginald Ruggles Gates. Another early editor was Herbert Charles Sanborn, formerly the chair of the department of Philosophy and Psychology at Vanderbilt University from 1921 to 1942. It was originally published in Edinburgh, Scotland, by the International Association for the Advancement of Ethnology and Eugenics, an organization founded by Draper to promote eugenics and scientific racism. Its foundation may in part have been a response to the declaration by UNESCO, which dismissed the validity of race as a biological concept, and to attempts to end racial segregation in the American South. In 1961, physical anthropologist Juan Comas published a series of scathing critiques of the journal arguing that the journal was reproducing discredited racial ideologies, such as Nordicism and anti-Semitism, under the guise of science. In 1963, after the journal's first issue, contributors U. R. Ehrenfels, T. N. Madan, and Juan Comas said that the journal's editorial practice was biased and misleading. In response, the journal published a series of rebuttals and attacks on Comas. Comas argued in Current Anthropology that the journal's publication of A. James Gregor's review of Comas' book Racial Myths was politically motivated. Comas claimed the journal misrepresented the field of physical anthropology by adhering to outdated racial ideologies, for example by claiming that Jews were considered a \\"biological race\\" by the racial biologists of the time. Other anthropologists complained that paragraphs that did not agree with the racial ideology of the editorial board were deleted from published articles without the authors' agreement.John P. Jackson. 2005. Science for Segregation: Race, Law, and the Case Against Brown V. Board of Education. NYU Press 151‚Äì154Paul A. Erickson, Liam Donat Murphy. 2013. Readings for A History of Anthropological Theory. University of Toronto Press, p. 534 Few academic anthropologists would publish in the journal or serve on its board; when Gates died, Carleton S. Coon, an anthropologist sympathetic to the hereditarian and racialistic view of the journal, was asked to replace him, but he rejected the offer stating that \\"I fear that for a professional anthropologist to accept membership on your board would be the kiss of death\\". The journal continued to be published supported by grant money. Publisher Roger Pearson received over a million dollars in grants from the Pioneer Fund in the 1980s and 1990s.Mehler, Barry (7 July 1998). Race Science and the Pioneer Fund Originally published as \\"The Funding of the Science\\" in Searchlight, No. 277. During the \\"Bell Curve wars\\" of the 1990s, the journal received attention when opponents of The Bell Curve publicised the fact that some of the works cited by Bell Curve authors Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray had first been published in Mankind Quarterly. In The New York Review of Books, Charles Lane referred to The Bell Curves \\"tainted sources\\", that seventeen researchers cited in the book's bibliography had contributed articles to, and ten of these seventeen had also been editors of, Mankind Quarterly, \\"a notorious journal of 'racial history' founded, and funded, by men who believe in the genetic superiority of the white race.\\" The journal has been published by the Ulster Institute for Social Research since January 2015, when publication duties were transferred from Pearson's Council for Social and Economic Studies (which had published the journal since 1979). Editors The editor-in-chief is Richard Lynn. Previous editors include Roger Pearson, Gerhard Meisenberg and Edward Dutton. Hereditarianism and politics Many of those involved with the journal are connected to academic hereditarianism. The journal has been criticised as being political and strongly right-leaning,e.g., Arvidsson, Stefan (2006), Aryan Idols: Indo-European Mythology as Ideology and Science, translated by Sonia Wichmann, Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press. supporting eugenics, racist or fascist.

The arena was designed by Italian architect/engineer Pier Luigi Nervi in conjunction with the (now defunct) local firm Williams and Tazewell, which designed the entire complex. Nervi's design for the arena's reinforced concrete dome derived from the PalaLottomatica and the much smaller Palazzetto dello Sport, which were built in the 1950s for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Construction on Scope began in June 1968 at the northern perimeter of Norfolk's downtown and was completed in 1971 at a cost of $35 million. Federal funds covered $23 million of the cost, and when it opened formally on November 12, 1971, the structure was the second-largest public complex in Virginia, behind only the Pentagon. Featuring the world's largest reinforced thinshell concrete dome (though eclipsed by the Seattle Seattle Kingdome from 1976 to 2000), Scope won the Virginia Society of the American Institute of Architects Test of Time award in 2003. Wes Lewis, director of Old Dominion University's civil engineering technology program, called it \\"a beautiful marrying of art and engineering.\\" Noted architectural critic James Howard Kunstler described the design as looking like \\"yesterday's tomorrow.\\" The name \\"Scope\\", a contraction of kaleidoscope, emphasizes the venue's re-configurability. The facility logo (right), which features a multi- colored, abstracted kaleidoscope image, was designed by Raymond Loewy's firm Loewy/Snaith of New York. History and design After watching the 1960 Rome Summer Olympics on television, and seeing the Palazzo dello Sport and Palazzetto dello Sport, Brad Tazewell and Jim Williams, two Norfolk architects, solicited Senator A. Willis Robertson, father of Pat Robertson, to build a sports complex in Norfolk. Subsequently, President Lyndon B. Johnson asked Robertson to support federal funding for a multimillion-dollar cultural center in Colorado, and Robertson said he would if Johnson would support one in Norfolk. Williams and Tazewell was subsequently commissioned; they in turn commissioned Nervi. The complex was an important part of the first phase of Norfolk's post-World War II revitalization. A large section of the city's downtown was razed, and the Scope complex was to \\"anchor\\" its northern corner, with the Vincent Kling designed courthouse and civic complex anchoring the eastern edge of downtown. The arena is located on its site above a raised plinth, below which is located a parking garage for 640 cars. The facility includes a exhibit hall as well as the adjacent Chrysler Hall, a music and theater venue, home to the Virginia Symphony Orchestra. The arena's seating can be reconfigured to accommodate from 10,253 for sporting events up to 13,800 for concerts. With a concrete monolithic dome measuring in diameter and a height of , the dome was, at the time of its construction, the largest of its kind in the world -- and was displaced as the record holder after the construction of the Seattle Kingdome. After the demolition of the larger Kingdome in 2000, Scope reclaimed the title as having the world's largest reinforced thin-shell concrete dome. Supported by 24 flying buttresses, the arena roof encloses . With over 1,000 pilings, the facility was constructed below the city's water table. The roof is a ribbed concrete dome, independent of seating bowl formed of sloped concrete beams supporting precast treads and risers which form the seating bowl. The perimeter of the dome roof is supported by a combination of vertical columns and inclined buttresses, which tie into a tension ring below ground. A concentric ring, approximately 7' 9\\" wide, is suspended from the dome, for service and lighting needs. During preparations for the first hosting of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, a bear escaped its cage and ran across the wet paint on the floor of the unfinished Exhibition Hall below. During the first presentation in the Exhibition Hall of the Hampton Roads Automobile Show, visitors could spot bear tracks in the painted floor, between the exhibitions. (Source: The Virginian- Pilot) The arena has undergone $11 million of renovations since 2003, including the replacement of a center-hung scoreboard with a matrix screen on each side with a center-hung scoreboard with LED video and matrix boards and two LED end-zone videoboards in 2008. A new glass wall has been installed, and is expected to be extended in order to expand the arena's main concourse at a cost of $3.5 million in 2014. This would result in additional restrooms and concession stands at the arena. There has been discussion about expanding the Norfolk Scope, by adding 5,000 seats and 24 luxury suites, in the near future, in order to remain competitive with neighboring venues in the southeastern and mid-Atlantic states. In 2018, the city decided to move on from the renovation concept, which would total $200 million. In his 2019 State of the City address, Norfolk mayor Kenny Alexander announced plans to study the possibility of building a new arena, in a not yet named location. National Wrestling Alliance, Jim Crockett Promotions, World Championship Wrestling, World Wrestling Entertainment had wrestling shows in Scope many times from the 1960s on, many times as a pay-per-view event. The biggest was Starrcade 88 in December 1988. The venue also hosted WCW's World War 3 PPV in November 1996, featuring the 3 ringed battle royal. Also during the Monday Night Wars D generation X drove a tank up to the doors of the venue during an episode of WCW Monday Nitro.

History The inside consists of one deck rising 24 rows, 14 seats across at its widest, and 30 separated sections around. The arena floor features of space, making it useful for trade shows and conventions in addition to sports and concerts. The arena has locals sponsor individual seats at the arena. Those who pay to sponsor seats at the Cross Insurance Arena can have their name engraved on their seats or dedicate the seat to someone they know. The arena's official name is the George I. Lewis Auditorium at Cross Insurance Arena. The press box is named for local sportscaster Frank Fixaris. ZZ Top was the very first headline act to play the arena when it opened on March 3, 1977. Elvis Presley was to have flown from Memphis to Portland on August 16, 1977, for a performance at the arena the following day, but he was found dead at his Graceland mansion that morning. A re-enactment of the preparations for the Portland show is featured in the bio film This Is Elvis. The venue hosted the America East Conference (then the ECAC North) men's basketball tournament in 1980. Two AHL hockey clubs that have called the arena home, include the Portland Pirates and three time Calder Cup champions, the Maine Mariners. On December 4, 2009, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) held their first house show in Maine at the Cumberland Civic Center. The United States Lacrosse League announced that the Maine Moose Trax would play its home games at the Cross Insurance Arena when the league was to begin play in the fall of 2014, though arena trustees called the announcement premature and stated no final agreement had been reached. It was the first franchise announced for the league, but the league never played any matches. Arena trustees reached a 10-year agreement in June 2014 with Cross Insurance Agency for the sale of the facility's naming rights for $2.5 million. The facility was renamed Cross Insurance Arena despite the fact that Cross Insurance also holds the naming rights to Bangor's Cross Insurance Center, away. Both parties to the deal state that there should be no confusion between the two facilities. The deal was also signed despite the naming rights of one of the entrances being named for the Clark Insurance company, though Clark Insurance stated their deal would remain. The arena is also the alternate home ice of the Maine Black Bears men's ice hockey team, who normally play at Alfond Arena in Orono, Maine. Renovations and lease dispute Maine Red Claws at the renovated CIA In October 2010, a task force voted to fund renovations costing $27 to $29 million. The renovations will include addition of premium seating, as well as upgrades to the locker rooms, an increased number of restrooms, and other improvements. The renovations would add just over 34,000 square feet to the building. It required approval by both the then-civic center board and approval of a bond issue by county voters. The bond was approved by county voters in November 2011. Renovations began after the 2011‚Äì12 hockey season. Following completion of the Portland Pirates' 2012‚Äì13 season, the arena closed for a second renovation phase, and is scheduled to reopen in January, 2014. The Pirates intended to play the first portion of their 2013‚Äì14 season at the Androscoggin Bank Colis√©e, through at least December 31. All renovations were completed by February 2014, and the first event in the facility was scheduled to be the Maine Home, Remodeling and Garden Show on Saturday, February 15. Civic Center trustees in 2013 ceased negotiations with the Pirates over terms of a new lease, and further stated they would seek new tenants for the calendar slots originally given to the Pirates. The Pirates announced on September 26, 2013 that the entire 2013‚Äì2014 home schedule would be played at the Androscoggin Bank Colis√©e in Lewiston over the dispute, instead of the, already scheduled, first 13 games. The dispute was primarily over share of food and beverage sales the Pirates would receive, though other issues existed. The Pirates are not able to share revenues of alcohol, due to not being the property's owner. Therefore, management asked for a larger percentage of food revenues.http://www.centralmaine.com/2013/08/30/pirates- refuse-to-sign-lease-with-civic-center/ Civic Center trustees stated that they only break even on the presence of the Pirates in the building, and that their expenses would actually be less without them. The Chairman of the Board of Trustees further criticized the Pirates for demanding more of a \\"subsidy\\" for themselves and stated their desired lease agreement would cost county taxpayers money. The Pirates also stated they would continue a lawsuit against the arena with the hopes of playing there in the future. New Pirates majority owner Ron Cain announced on December 19, 2013, that the team dropped its lawsuit and that arena trustees would resume negotiations, both seeking \\"to strike a balance between the team's business needs and the arena's financial obligations\\" according to Cain. The chairman of the trustees stated that he found Cain's comments on the issue \\"constructive\\" and he thus was willing to restart talks. Maine Senate President Justin Alfond, who is from Portland, announced that he submitted emergency legislation to the Maine Legislature to allow the Pirates to receive a share of alcohol revenue, as the original agreement called for but was ruled to be illegal. Cain said that Alfond's efforts did not play a role in their decision on the lawsuit, but could help the team going forward. On February 4, 2014, arena trustees and the Pirates announced that a 5-year lease agreement had been reached and that the team would return to the not yet renamed Civic Center for the 2014‚Äì15 season. The agreement includes the sharing of concessions revenue the Pirates sought, which may or may not include alcohol sales pending passage of Sen. Alfond's bill. However, on May 4, 2016, it was announced that the Portland Pirates had signed a letter of intent to sell the franchise and would relocate the team to Springfield, Massachusetts. Less than a week after the announcement, a team of investors headed by former Pirates executives W. Godfrey Wood and Brad Church announced their intentions to put an ECHL team in Portland to fill the void, possibly joining as early as 2017. It would take an extra year, but Comcast Spectacor, the arena owners, purchased the franchise rights of the Alaska Aces and relocated the team to Portland for the 2018‚Äì19 season as a new version of the Maine Mariners.

The sponsorship also includes health programming and the continuation of Upstate's sponsorship with the Syracuse Crunch. Tenants The Upstate Medical University Arena is home to the Syracuse Crunch ice hockey team. Previous teams to call the War Memorial home included the NBA's Syracuse Nationals, the NLL's Syracuse Smash, the Major Arena Soccer League's Syracuse Silver Knights, and several now-defunct American Hockey League teams. The Nationals defeated the Fort Wayne Pistons in a deciding seventh game at home to win the 1954‚Äì55 NBA Championship. The War Memorial also hosted the NBA All- Star Game in 1961 and the NCAA Frozen Four in 1967 and 1971. The 1977 film Slap Shot included the War Memorial among the various arenas used as shooting locations for in-game action. War Memorial at OnCenter (2006) Notable events The Onondaga County War Memorial was home to the annual NYSPHSAA wrestling tournament in 1968, from 1970 to 1972, and then for 29-straight years, 1974‚Äì2003. The championship event has since been hosted by various venues around the state. Professional wrestling has also experienced its share of history at the War Memorial. Shortly after completion of filming of the WCW-produced film Ready to Rumble, actor David Arquette won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship title on April 26, 2000 in a taping of the company's weekly Thunder broadcast, which is often cited as being the first legitimate sign of the demise of WCW. It also hosted the first WWF In Your House pay-per- view in 1995. In April 1998 the Oncenter hosted WWF Monday Night Raw. The Oncenter is occasionally host to WWE house shows. The American Hockey League's Syracuse Crunch have hosted the AHL All-Star Classic twice (1998, 2016) and reached the Calder Cup Finals in 2013 and 2017.

Maines Veterans Memorial Arena (formerly known as the Broome County Veterans Memorial Arena) is a 7,200-seat multi-purpose arena located in Binghamton, New York. The arena was completed in 1973, providing an entertainment venue for residents of the Greater Binghamton area. The arena contains eight luxury suites, each holding 25 fans (200 total). A longtime home to minor league hockey, the arena is currently home to the Binghamton Devils of the American Hockey League. History In the 1960s, the city of Binghamton started planning a number of urban renewal projects to revitalize the urban core, collectively known as Project 1. Based on the recommendations of a citizen committee, city and county leaders included a proposal as part of Project 1 to construct a downtown cultural complex. The proposed complex would consist of two buildings: a multipurpose veterans memorial auditorium and a performing arts center. A nationwide design competition for the complex (at the time referred to as the Broome County Cultural Center) was held, with Elbasani, Logan & Severin (ELS) being selected as the winners in November 1967. ELS was formed specifically to enter in the competition, and has since gone on to become a nationally-recognized architectural firm. The winning design placed the arena between State Street and Washington Street, and the performing arts center along the river on Washington Street, with an elevated walkway over Washington Street connecting the two buildings. The arena plans made use of an innovative space frame based design to avoid view-obstructing columns. The first (and ultimately only) phase of construction, consisting of the arena and a short portion of the elevated walkway, lasted from 1971 to 1973, with the total cost coming to $7.5 million at the time (equivalent to $ million in ). The arena was built with 17,000 square feet of space on the arena floor, with an additional 12,000 square feet on the concourse. The first act, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, took place in an unfinished arena in May 1973. Chicago played the first concert at the arena (with Bruce Springsteen as opener) on June 13, 1973. The ribbon cutting and first event on ice was with the Ice Capades. The proposed second phase of the complex, consisting of the remaining elevated walkway and the riverside performing arts center, was never built due to budgetary issues; the portion of the walkway built during the first phase remains as an extension of the arena. In place of the new performing arts center, the county refurbished and expanded the Capri Theatre, which became the Broome County Forum. The Broome Dusters of the North American Hockey League were the building's first full- time tenant. After a tepid first year of support, the Dusters grew greatly in popularity, and were able to draw many sellouts, and the community passion for the team led the Hockey News to declare Binghamton as Hockey Town USA. The Broome Dusters became the Binghamton Dusters in 1977 and moved into the American Hockey League. That AHL franchise would go through a number of name changes, becoming the Whalers and Rangers before relocating to Hartford, Connecticut in 1997. The Rangers were replaced by the BC Icemen, of the United Hockey League, for five seasons. The AHL returned in 2002 with the Binghamton Senators, who were affiliated with the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League. In 2017, the Senators were replaced with the New Jersey Devils' affiliate, the Binghamton Devils, who are the current tenants. The arena has hosted some notable names in entertainment, including AC/DC, Bob Dylan, B.B. King, Bon Jovi, The Eagles, Kenny Rogers, Aerosmith, Fleetwood Mac, Metallica, Van Halen, Elton John, Keith Sweat, Cher, Dolly Parton, Grateful Dead, Phish, Green Day, Twisted Sister, Stone Temple Pilots and Carrie Underwood. Trade shows, the Binghamton Philharmonic, the Harlem Globetrotters, and the Circus all make yearly visits. Every December, the arena plays host to the Stop-DWI Holiday Classic, a high school basketball tournament. From 1992 to 2014, the Classic included a national bracket, and was considered to be one of the premiere high school basketball tournaments in the United States. In 2016, the arena hosted the New York State Public High School Athletic Association boys' basketball championship. It was announced on August 14, 2020 that the arena will be renamed the Visions FCU Veterans Memorial Arena effective January 4, 2021. The Visions Federal Credit Union will take over naming rights from the Maines Family who chose not to renew their contract. http://www.wicz.com/story/42497824/visions-federal-credit-union-finalizes- deal-for-naming-rights-to-the-arena Notable events Elvis Presley performed back-to-back sold out concerts at the Arena, May 26 & 27, just prior to his death in the summer of 1977. The New Jersey Nets of the NBA, Hartford Whalers, Washington Capitals, and Ottawa Senators of the NHL have all hosted exhibition games at the Arena. The Grateful Dead performed at the Arena on November 6, 1977, May 9, 1979, and April 12, 1983. The 1977 concert will be featured on the upcoming album Dave's Picks Volume 25. Phish's December 14, 1995 performance at the Arena was released as Live Phish Volume 1 in 2001. On April 21, 1997, July 20, 1998, and June 13, 2005 World Wrestling Entertainment brought RAW to the Arena. The April 21, 1997 episode was the RAW after In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker. The July 20, 1998 episode was the RAW before Fully Loaded: In Your House. The June 13, 2005 episode was the RAW after the inaugural ECW One Night Stand pay-per-view. On November 13, 1999 Extreme Championship Wrestling taped an episode of ECW on TNN at the Arena. It aired on November 19, 1999. On February 1, 2000 World Championship Wrestling taped an episode of WCW Thunder that was aired the following evening.

It runs between the two English university cities of Oxford and Cambridge via Milton Keynes and other settlements in Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, at the northern rim of the London commuter belt. It is significant only in economic geography, with little physical geography in common. The original Oxford to Cambridge (O2C) Arc initiative was launched in 2003 by three English regional development agencies (RDAs), EEDA, EMDA and SEEDA. The aim of the initiative is to promote and accelerate the development of the unique set of educational, research and business assets and activities that characterise the area and in doing so, create an ‚Äúarc‚Äù of innovation and entrepreneurial activity that would, in time, be ‚Äòbest in the field'. In November 2017, a report for the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) noted that \\"in 2014, the Gross Value Added (GVA) of the \\"corridor\\" was ¬£90.5bn (2011 prices); by doubling housebuilding rates in the area, and delivering East West Rail and the Oxford- Cambridge Expressway, this [would] increase by ¬£163bn to a GVA of ¬£250bn\\".National Infrastructure Commission calls for major investment in transport links between Oxford and Cambridge Transport Xtra (Mark Moran), 17 November 2017 Industry The Arc is a major centre of the UK's high tech manufacturing and research industries. It is serviced by four international airports (Stansted, Luton, Heathrow and Birmingham), all located just outside the Arc itself. Cranfield Airport and Cambridge Airport take executive jets. Cambridge Airport is an important centre for aircraft maintenance. Other major industries include agriculture, tourism, construction, entertainment, education, retail and finance. A high proportion of the population commutes daily to London. Commuting and business travel within the arc is relatively difficult in the absence of important east‚Äìwest infrastructure. Future The National Infrastructure Commission projects that the Arc will become host to major hi-tech industrial developments and will be the site to one million new homes by 2050, with Milton Keynes alone doubling in population to 500,000. To facilitate this development (and wider national infrastructure needs for outer orbital routes around London), two major projects are underway or planned. Work has begun to extend East West Rail from Bicester to the West Coast Main Line at (Milton Keynes); onward extension to Cambridge is planned. Concurrently, detailed route options planning has begun on the Oxford-Milton Keynes phase that is to complete the Oxford-Cambridge Expressway (linking the A34 with the A14). Universities The Arc has a major university sector with 20,000 workers as part of the knowledge economy: Oxford University, Oxford Brookes University, Buckingham University, The Open University (HQ Milton Keynes), Cranfield University, University of Bedfordshire, the University of Cambridge, and the Anglia Ruskin University at Cambridge. Demographics The Arc is one of the most ethnically diverse regions of the UK. Bedford, roughly central to the Arc and with a population of 100,000, is home to native speakers of over 100 languages, a figure which rivals London, Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. The Arc has the fastest growing population of any of the similar regions within the UK; several of the major towns, most notably Bicester and Milton Keynes, are set to double in size over the coming few decades,xMilton Keynes set to double in size swelling population to half a million Sally Murder, Milton Keynes Citizen, 23 January 2018 and others, such as Cambourne, have been built from scratch since the late 1990s. Politically, the Arc is largely a Conservative stronghold, with only the urban constituencies returning Liberal Democrat or Labour MPs. Transport The region is well served by major radial routes from London (the M40, M1, A1(M) and M11 motorways, and the West Coast Main Line, the Midland Main Line and the East Coast Main Line railways). However, routes around the arc are poor, with a disjointed and overloaded road network (A428, A421/A422 and A43) and a fragmentary railway line (remnants of the former Varsity Line). A twice-hourly express bus service, route X5, is operated by Stagecoach UK Buses between Cambridge and Oxford, serving the more important of the settlements below en route but taking 3 hours and 40 minutes to travel the . In November 2017, in its report on the Arc, the NIC called for the railway line between Bicester and Bletchley to be reopened by 2023 and Bedford/Cambridge by 2030, and for the development and construction of a new grade separated dual carriageway between the M1 and Oxford by 2030, as part of the proposed Oxford-Cambridge Expressway.

The major organization on base is known as DLA Land and Maritime. Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) is also a major tenant on base. The base has been affected several times by the United States Base Realignment and Closure program. It is located in the Columbus, Ohio suburb of Whitehall. The DSCC has a historical marker. The base was opened in 1918. History The DLA in the CSCC as seen from the East DSCC has served in every major military engagement since World War I. In 1917, the site was a combination of swamp land and farmland. America's production effort in World War I reached a climax in 1918, when transportation lines to ports of embarkation for men and materials were filled to capacity. This site was advantageous because it afforded immediate access to three important railroad lines. The U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps made the first purchase of land, , to construct a government military installation in April, 1918. Warehouse construction began in May of that year, and by August, six warehouses were receiving material for storage. Those warehouses are still in use today. The lull between World War I and World War II reduced center operations to mostly reconditioning and sale of the stockpiles which had been needed earlier to ensure the nations defense. During World War II the center became the largest military supply installation in the world. In December 1942, an additional were purchased. With more than 10,000 civilian employees, it played a large part in the overall war effort. Some of the warehouses were turned into secured barracks to house prisoners of war. Amidst the wars, the conflicts and humanitarian relief efforts, the installation has continuously worked to establish direct and fast moving supply lines to support American armed forces in all parts of the world. The installation's operational activities were assigned to the U.S. Army Supply and Maintenance Command in July 1962. The following year, it became the Defense Construction Supply Center under what is now known as the Defense Logistics Agency.

Some time later, the scene gained more publicity with the rise of a publicly feuding pair of crew leaders, Stezo of the Flotte Imperiale and Almighty of the Minist√®re Authentik. There is a kind of gangsta rap-influenced Ivorian hip hop called rap dogba, inspired by Angelo & les Dogbas. \\"Foreigness\\" and growth Overall, hip hop is still perceived in Ivory Coast as a foreign type of music and artists do not enjoy the popularity of their zouglou or Coup√©-D√©cal√© counterparts. It is considered a marginal movement with a specific following because most Ivorians did not find material or situations to relate to or connect with in Ivorian hip-hop. However, since 2006 and the rise of a new school of Ivorian rap crews such as the very popular Garba 50 (whose name is inspired by a very cheap and popular Ivorian dish eaten by the common people), hip hop is enjoying a newfound following among the Ivorian population. By blending Nouchi, the particular and very evocative Ivorian vernacular and street language, with hip hop beats and rhyming style, groups like Garba 50, Sans Soi,Sans Soi Website and Rage Man (among others) have managed to revitalize the movement and make it more accessible to Ivorians. Ivorian artists outside Africa A new generation of Ivorian rappers who live overseas in France or the U.S like Djafoul Koncept, Dynamik Boobah Siddik, DDF, and many others have added to the growth of the movement in Ivory Coast by keeping in close touch with their Ivorian fan base and pushing technological and musical changes back to their native land.Rapalloco Ivorian hip hop portal References *africanhiphop.com: Ivorian Hip Hop: 2002.

For example, the myths of Adonis and Osiris share several elements, leading some scholars to conclude that they share a source, i.e. images passed down in cultures or from one to another, being ascribed new interpretations of the action depicted, as well as new names in various readings of icons. Overview Claude L√©vi-Strauss (1908‚Äì2009), who gave the term wide circulation,First described, as a \\"gross constituent unit\\", in reprinted as \\"The structural study of myth\\", Structural Anthropology, 1963:206-31; the term mytheme first appears in L√©vi-Strauss' 1958 French version of the work. wrote, \\"If one wants to establish a parallel between structural linguistics and the structural analysis of myths, the correspondence is established, not between mytheme and word but between mytheme and phoneme.\\" L√©vi-Strauss, La poeti√®re jalouse, Paris, 1985 (The Jealous Potter, Chicago, 1988) pp 144-46. The structuralist analyzer of folk tales, Vladimir Propp, treated the individual tale as the unit of analysis. The unitary mytheme, by contrast, is the equivalent in myth of the phonemes, morphemes, and sememes into which structural linguistics divides language, the smallest possible units of sound, structure, and meaning (respectively) within a language system. In the 1950s Claude L√©vi-Strauss first adapted this technique of language analysis to analytic myth criticism. In his work on the myth systems of primitive tribes, working from the analogy of language structure, he adopted the French term myth√®me, with the assertion that the system of meaning within mythic utterances parallels closely that of a language system. Roman Jakobson varies this idea, treating mythemes as concepts or phonemes which have no significance in themselves but whose significance might be shown by sociological analysis. Philosophers such as Daniel Dennett have also used the term \\"mytheme\\".

It is situated approximately north of Kaiserslautern. Otterberg is the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde (\\"collective municipality\\") Otterbach-Otterberg. History The following events occurred, in each year: *1143 The monastery was established. *1168 Construction of the monastery began. *1254 The church was inaugurated on May 10. *1380 The monastery was in steady decline beginning about 1380 until the 15th century. *1504 During the Bavaria-Landshut War of Succession, the monastery was plundered. *1525 During the German Peasants' War (Bauernkrieg); the insurgent peasants fell on the remainder of the monastery. *1556 The Reformation was introduced to the area. *1559 The remaining monks were instructed to convert. *1561 The last Abbott Wendelin Merbot left the monastery. *1564 The monastery was left open. The gates of Otterberg were opened. *1579 Pfalzgraf Johann Casimir invited religious refugees from the Spanish Netherlands to settle Otterberg and there was active settlement by the Walloons. They used the stones of the monastery complex for the building of their houses, so that today only the abbey church and the chapter hall remain. *1581 Gained town privileges from Pfalzgraf (Count-Palatine) Johann Casimir. *1582 to 1593 Many previous residents of Otterberg were in Frankenthal. *1618 to 1648 The Thirty Years' War severely affected the area. *1650 Existing church records in Otterberg begin. *1689 Many residents of Otterberg arrived in Holzappel under the leadership of Charles Faucher after a long period of wandering after fleeing Otterberg due to the War of the League of Augsburg which lasted from 1688 to 1697. *1708 Joint use of the church by the Protestants and Catholics led to problems. The solution was to add a wall inside the church so that the Catholic part (in the transept) was separated from the Protestant part (in the nave). *1979 During a very extensive restoration project, this wall was removed. The church is now shared by both church communities. Objects of interest * Monastic church: Part a former Cistercian monastery, this abbey church is the second largest in the Palatinate (after the Speyer Cathedral). The church was built between 1168 and 1254. The monastery reached its peak around the year 1340 and declined around 1561. In 1579 groups of refugees of the reformed faith arrived from the Spanish Netherlands and from northern France.

It functions as a connector highway wholly contained in Fife Lake Township, Grand Traverse County, which is located in the northwestern Lower Peninsula. The western terminus is at M-113 east of Kingsley and the eastern terminus is at U.S. Highway 131 (US 131) west of downtown Fife Lake. The current incarnation of M-186 is the second usage of the designation. The first was used for a highway in the Upper Peninsula in the 1930s. Route description M-186 forms an easterly extension of M-113 from Kingsley to Fife Lake. M-186 starts south of a ninety-degree curve in M-113 and runs east through flat, wooded terrain to Fife Lake. The roadway runs parallel to the survey section lines in Fife Lake Township, and it passes several residences along the whole length. From the eastern terminus, State Street connects M-186 and US 131 with downtown Fife Lake. M-186 at its western terminus, M-113, near Fife Lake In 2007, the average annual daily traffic (AADT) surveys conducted by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) showed that 2,100 vehicles used M-186. M-113 west of M-186 logged an average of 7,800 vehicles a day north of the junction and 4,400 vehicles south of the junction. On the east end, US 131 carried 5,100 vehicles north and 4,800 vehicles south of the junction in Fife Lake. Of the 2,100 vehicles on M-186, only 140 trucks travelled the highway each day on average. History=Previous designation In the 1930s, M-186 was designated on a connector route in the Upper Peninsula between US 2/US 41 at Rapid River and M-35 near Brampton. This designation existed from 1933 until July 26, 1939, forming a route for westbound US 2 traffic to access M-35 northbound towards Gwinn and Negaunee. Current designation In 1940, US 131 ended at a three-way convergence with M-113 and M-131 four miles (6 km) north of Walton Junction in Paradise Township. From this intersection, US 131 ran south to Walton Junction, M-113 ran west to Kingsley, and M-131 ran east toward Fife Lake before turning north to Petoskey. A new alignment of US 131 was built from Walton Junction directly to Fife Lake. This formed a third leg of a triangle of roads, allowing US 131 to bypass the Paradise Township intersection. US 131 replaced M-131 north from Fife Lake to Petoskey. M-113 was extended along the former section of US 131 south to Walton Junction. The remaining leg of the triangle from Paradise Township to Fife Lake along a portion of the former M-131 was designated M-186 at this time. In 2017, MDOT announced plans to build a roundabout at the eastern terminus of M-186 at US-131. This is the result of many crashes at this intersection (nearly 80 from 2007 to 2017), many of which because of low visibility. The project was supposed to be started and completed in the first half of 2019, although the project was finished in late July of that year.

He always works in co-operation with a defense attorney, who is the other main character on the show. The character of the defense attorney has changed several times in the lifetime of the show. In chronological order, the attorneys have been Dieter Renz, Rainer Franck, Johannes Voss and Markus Lessing, who () is the current attorney. The former attorneys left the show because of various reasons: Renz retired due to his old age, Franck accepted a job as a teacher at a law school, and Voss was shot dead by an escaping criminal. In the beginning of the first episode in 1981 he mentioned his birthplace to be Oberhausen and his age to be 31 years. So he was going to celebrate his 60th birthday in 2010. Despite this advanced age, Matula is in good physical condition and can put up quite a fight when challenged. According to research done by a German fan of the show, Matula has been beaten up 37 times and knocked unconscious 7 times. Still he somehow manages to stay healthy and fit for his duty. Matula's method of detective work is very direct and hands-down. While the attorney he works with handles the juridistical part of the current case, Matula gets his hands dirty and tracks down the people he suspects of being involved in the crimes. This frequently involves him posing as a reporter or other similar profession to avoid discovery. Matula's direct, action-oriented way of work often gets him into trouble with the police. He has been arrested 12 times, and the entire plot of one episode centered on Matula being suspected of murder and having to escape the police into Austria.

The ship was originally built in Belfast by William J. Woodside and was launched in 1885. Polly Woodside is typical of thousands of smaller iron barques built in the last days of sail, intended for deep water trade around the world and designed to be operated as economically as possible. Voyages 1885‚Äì1904 Polly Woodside was built at the north shipbuilding yard of Workman, Clark and Co, Queen's Island, Belfast during 1885, for William J. Woodside and Co. She was launched on 7 November 1885; the christening performed by the owner's wife, Mrs Marian (\\"Polly\\") Woodside, after whom the ship was named.Darroch, V.(1978) Barque Polly Woodside (Rona) p. 1. Lowden Publishing, Kilmore, Australia. Polly Woodside captained by Gilbert Yeates, operated as a cargo vessel carrying coal, nitrate, and wheat between British ports and the ports of South America, such as Montevideo, Valparaiso and Buenos Aires. In sixteen voyages between December 1885 and August 1903 she made a number of arduous passages around Cape Horn. The Polly Woodside's operating crew, including master and mate was generally less than 20. Voyages 1904‚Äì1922 In 1904 Polly Woodside was sold to A.H. Turnbull of New Zealand and renamed Rona after Miss Rona Monro, daughter of a shareholder in the company. Valued in 1906 at ¬£4,300, Rona then generally operated on the New Zealand‚ÄìAustralian run, carrying timber, salt, cement, grain and coal. The ship changed hands in 1911 for ¬£3000 to Captain Harrison Douglas,Evening Post, Volume LXXXII, Issue 52, 30 August 1911, p. 8 of New Zealand and again in 1916 to the George H. Scales Company. Because of the heavy loss of shipping in the 1914‚Äì1918 war, Rona also traded between New Zealand ports and San Francisco, carrying case oil and copra.Darroch, V.(1978) pp. 68‚Äì71 Two mishaps occurred in the last years of the ship's sailing career. In March 1920 the schooner W. J. Pirie, under tow in San Francisco harbour, collided with Rona at anchor, carrying away her headgear. Then in June 1921 the Rona, carrying a cargo of coal, grounded on Steeple Rock, off Wellington Heads. The shingle bottom caused little damage and she was able to be towed into Wellington harbour. However, some slight stress fractures to the hull plating could still be seen when the ship was dry-docked in 1974.Darroch, V.(1978) p. 79 As a coal lighter 1922‚Äì1962 Maritime historian Georg K√•hre has described the early 1920s as the final abandonment of sail by most of the world's maritime nations. \\"In the hectic economic climate of the great war there had been no question of scrap prices [for sailing ships].\\"K√•hre,G (1948) The Last Tall Ships. p. 101. 1978 Translation and new edition, Bay Books, Sydney However, by 1922 this had changed. \\"World freight rates were sliding in the post war slump; what had been marginal before was now uneconomic.\\"Darroch, V (1979) The Polly Woodside. National Trust of Australia (Victoria) p. 12. A few larger sailing ships defied this trend,Gustaf Erikson's Passat and Pamir made the final commercial voyages under sail from Australia as late as mid 1949. but not the relatively small Rona. In September 1921 the ship was laid up, then sold to Adelaide Steamship Company for service as a coal hulk in Australia. She arrived in Sydney on 8 October 1922, and by early 1923 had been stripped down. In March 1925 the Lammeroo towed Rona to Melbourne for this purpose. She spent the next 40 years quite unremarkably, bunkering coal-burning ships in the Port of Melbourne. An exception was her war service; during the Second World War. In 1943 she was requisitioned as a dumb lighter (coal hulk) by the Royal Australian Navy for service with other hulks in New Guinea waters. She was taken under tow of ST Tooronga on 28 October 1943 and arrived in Cairns on 19 November 1943. She was then taken in tow by ST Wato and towed to Milne Bay in New Guinea waters. Captain Douglas Strath described her thus; \\"queen of this dumb (ie lacking self propulsion) but mighty workforce was Rona. She was big enough to supply, unload, store, repair, construct and function in so many ways... she was an integral part of the vital servicing fleet.\\"Darroch, V. p. 81 She was towed back to Melbourne in 1946, resuming her career as a coal hulk. Preservation and restoration since 1968 A number of half-hearted efforts were made in the mid 20th century to preserve Australia's sailing heritage, at the same time as it rapidly disappeared from Australian ports. In 1934, the Shiplover's Society of Victoria arranged for the coal hulk Shandon (a 1,400 ton former barque) to be partially re-rigged and refitted as a static display, to celebrate the centenary of European settlement.Centenary Maritime Exhibition Program, Souvenir Catalogue, Ship Lovers Society of Victoria, 1934. The Shandon, owned by McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co, returned to her former duties as a coal hulk after the exhibition, until broken up around 1960. However, by the early 1960s, Rona was the last of her kind still afloat in Australia. A few others lay full of water, abandoned and forgotten ‚Äì the James Craig in Recherche Bay, Tasmania; the Santiago in the Port River, near Adelaide. The Polly Woodside's restoration owes much to the efforts of Karl Kortum, former director of the San Francisco Maritime Museum, who inspired Dr. Graeme Robertson of the National Trust of Australia (Victoria) to put up a proposal to save the ship in 1962. In the context of the time, this proposal was quite risky but showed extraordinary vision.Only a few years before, the National Trust had been thwarted in an effort to preserve the famous Melbourne steam tug James Paterson. The Government of the day would have none of it. The National Trust of Australia relied entirely on volunteer labour, and it had no experience in restoring a sailing ship, even for static display. The restoration of the Rona/Polly Woodside would be a massive task. A long campaign led to the National Trust of Australia purchasing her from Howard Smith Industries for one cent in 1968. An estimated 60,000 hours of painstaking voluntary labour saw the ship refurbished close to its original state.Darroch, V (1979) The Polly Woodside. National Trust of Australia (Victoria) p. 12. The project received strong support from businesses, unions, former crewmembers and several Captains. The first Master of Restoration, Captain G.H.Heyen was a master in sail. Polly Woodside's chief rigger for 27 years of restoration was Tor Lindqvist, a former able seaman and sailmaker on Lawhill, Passat and Viking.Carter, R (2004) Windjammers, The final story. p. 230 Rosenberg Publishing, NSW, Australia. In 1978 she was opened under her original name to the public, and is now permanently moored at the old Duke and Orr's Dry Dock on the Yarra River near Melbourne. Now landlocked by a nearby roadbridge, she cannot take to sea like the restored barque James Craig, of Sydney. In 1988 the World Ship Trust awarded their seventh maritime heritage award to Polly Woodside, for \\"supreme achievement in the preservation of maritime heritage\\" ‚Äì a first for a restored merchant ship.Brouwer, N.J. (Ed.) (1993) International Register of Historic Ships. p. 41. Second Edition. Anthony Nelson, Avon, England. In March 2007, Polly Woodside was added to the Victorian Heritage Register. Polly Woodside scores top heritage listing, The Age, 9 March 2007 Redevelopment and dry dock works after 2006 Polly Woodside was closed to the public on 30 April 2006 to allow for the major redevelopment of the lower Yarra River's southern bank. The $1.4 billion redevelopment, announced by the Victorian Government in February 2006, included construction works for the new Melbourne Convention and Exhibition CentreMelbourne Convention Centre immediately next to the Polly Woodside. The ship was temporarily relocated approximately 50 metres away to a mooring on the adjacent Yarra River on 26 August 2008 ‚Äì its first move in 33 years ‚Äì for a $13 million operational refurbishment and restoration of its dry dock home, board walk, and adjacent former wharf sheds. Between this time and May 2009 the water within the Duke and Orr's Dry Dock was pumped out and a gated dam wall built at the entrance. The bottom of the dry dock was excavated and permanent keel supports built into the concrete base for Polly Woodside to sit upon, allowing the ship to be periodically dry docked for repairs. On 19 May 2009 the dam wall gates were opened allowing water to flow into the dry dock and Polly Woodside was returned to the Duke and Orr's Dry Dock.

CAD/CAM software is a PC-based system, which is made up of program modules. Today, there are 2D and 3D versions of CAD/CAM systems in the shoe industry. Computer aided design was introduced in the shoe industry in the 1970s. Initially it was used primarily for pattern grading. It enabled manufacturers to perform complex grading relatively easily and quickly. CAD systems today have been developed with a much wider range of functions. Logos, textures and other decorations can be incorporated into product designs of both the uppers and soles to help reinforce branding on all areas of the model. It automates routine procedures, increasing speed and consistency whilst reducing the possibility of mistakes. CAD data can now be used effectively for a wide variety of activities across footwear manufacturing business. CAD/CAM generates data at the design stage, which can be used right through the planning and manufacturing stages. Latest improvements in the CAD/CAM technology are: * Graphic capabilities and interconnectivity have improved enormously, * Software developments have progressively made systems more intuitive and easier to use, * With 2D sketch and paint modules, a serviceable sketch can be produced and then colour and texture can be added. * 3D systems enable the last and design to be viewed from any perspective and several angles even simultaneously. With CAD/CAM software, footwear manufacturers can cut their time to market dramatically and so increase market share and profitability. In addition, the power and flexibility of the software can overcome restrictions to the designer‚Äôs creativity imposed by traditional methods. Sole design CAD/CAM software can be used to generate machining data for shoe sole models and moulds Shoe sole mould makers are able to strengthen their capabilities of mould design and production techniques to meet the market demands for shorter product life cycle, quality improvement and handling versatile pattern design. This helps especially sports shoe producers to manufacture products rapidly and to introduce them earlier than their competitors. 3D CAD/CAM is the core technology for shoe sole mould in the footwear industry and develops towards specialization. Benefits of CAD/CAM in the mould manufacturing are: * Total modeling for rapid generation of design concepts and variations, * Reverse engineering from existing models or parts, * Easy design modification and morphing capability, * Completely accurate designs regardless of complexity, * Group grading of soles and uppers, * Advanced decorating techniques, * Realistic onscreen visualization, * Rapid generation of molds from product designs.

It runs from Belding to south of Lakeview. Its length exists entirely within Ionia and Montcalm counties. It is all undivided surface route. Aside from the two Michigan state highways that are its termini, it has only one other intersection with any Michigan state highway, and that is with M-57 in Greenville. M-91 was formed when M-66 was rerouted in the 1940s. At the time, the highway continued south to Lowell, but subsequent transfers or roadway sections have truncated the route to its present form. For a time period in the 1980s, M-91 was even a discontinuous highway when a section in the middle was transferred to county control before the southernmost section was transferred. Route description M-91 starts at an intersection with M-44 west of Belding in Otisco Township. The road runs north along Storey Road and past the Candlestone Golf Course and farmlands. At Bricker Road, M-91 crosses out of Ionia County into Montcalm County. The trunkline runs along Greenville Road and passes the Greenville Municipal Airport. As it continues north, the highway curves to the northeast running between the Flat River and Baldwin, Como and Manoka lakes. As it enters the south side of Greenville, M-91 runs along on Lafayette Street. In the center of Greenville, M-91 meets M-57 on Washington Street. North of downtown, M-91 crosses a bend in the Flat River and continues to parallel the river on the east out of town. In rural Montcalm County, M-91 is once again named Greenville Road and it curves to the west of Turk Lake and continues due north to the community of Langston. North of Langston are Tacoma, West and Spring lakes. Further north, M-91 curves to the northwest around Farnsworth Lake, resuming its due-north course a mile (1.6 km) to the west . Running through farmlands again, M-91 terminates at an intersection with M-46 in Lakeview, just south of Tamarack Lake. History=Previous designations The first routing of M-91 in Michigan was located between Menominee and Cedar River in the Upper Peninsula. This routing was designated by July 1, 1919. The designation remained until sometime before December 1927 when it was replaced by M-35. In 1927, all of the current M-91 was originally part of M-66. A second usage of M-91 was designated from Rogers City towards Cheboygan County along the Lake Huron shore by 1930. It became part of US 23 by the end of 1940. Current designation M-91 was designated for the third time by June 1942. The number was assigned between US 16 (Cascade Road/Grand River Avenue) south of Lowell running northeast along Alden Nash Avenue into Lowell and Lincoln Lake Road north of town. The highway followed Lincoln Lake Road to M-44 east of Belding and turned to run concurrently along M-44 to the Belding area. From there it ran north to Greenville and on to Lakeview along the present route. The last section of gravel roadway was paved in Ionia County in 1954. The highway designation was extended south to the then-new US 16 freeway (now Interstate 96) around 1958. It was later truncated back to M-21 in Lowell in 1968. By 1980, the section of M-91 in Ionia County south of M-44 to the Kent County line was turned back to local control. The highway section in Kent County remained marked as M-91, resulting in a discontinuous highway. The southern section between Lowell and the county line was turned back by 1985, resulting in the modern routing of M-91.

The name \\"Coreidae\\" derives from the genus Coreus, which derives from the Ancient Greek () meaning bedbug.http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/coreidi/ As a family, the Coreidae are cosmopolitan, but most of the species are tropical or subtropical. Common names and significance The common names of the Coreidae vary regionally. Leaf-footed bug refers to leaf-like expansions on the legs of some species, generally on the hind tibiae. In North America, the pest status of species such as Anasa tristis on squash plants and other cucurbits gave rise to the name squash bugs. The Coreidae are called twig-wilters or tip-wilters in parts of Africa and Australia because many species feed on young twigs, injecting enzymes that macerate the tissues of the growing tips and cause them to wilt abruptly. Morphology and appearance The Coreidae commonly are oval-shaped, with antennae composed of four segments, numerous veins in the membrane of the fore wings, and externally visible repugnatorial stink glands. They vary in size from 7 to 45 mm long, which implies that the family includes some of the biggest species of Heteroptera. The body shape is quite variable; some species are broadly oval, others are elongated with parallel sides, and a few are slender. Many species with the \\"leaf-footed\\" tibiae are very slender with conspicuous expansions of the hind tibiae, but some robust species also have decided expansions. Some species are covered with spines and tubercles. As an example of these, the tribe Phyllomorphini Mulsant & Rey, 1870, are strikingly aberrant, with thin legs, spiny bristles, and laciniate outlines and adornments. Many of the more robust species have grossly enlarged, thickened, and bowed hind femora armed with spikes on the inner edge, and with hind tibiae to match, though the enlargement of the tibiae is less exaggerated. In the nymphs, the openings of the two repugnatorial stink glands of the Coreidae are visible as two projections or spots on the medial line of the dorsal surface of the abdomen, one at the anterior and one at the posterior edge of the fifth abdominal tergite above the glands inside. During the final ecdysis, the anatomy is rearranged and the glands end up in the metathorax, opening laterally through ostioles between the mesothoracic and metathoracic pleura.Beard, Raimon L. The Biology of Anasa tristis DeGeer. Bulletin 440. Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, New Haven 1940 Biology and habits The Coreidae generally feed on the sap of plants. Some species reportedly are actively carnivorous,Comstock, J. H. An Introduction to Entomology, Comstock Publishing. 1949. May be downloaded from: but material evidence is lacking, and in the field, some are easy to confuse with some species of the Reduviidae, so doubt has been cast on the veracity of the claims.University of Kentucky Entomology/Kentucky Critter Files/Kentucky Insects/True Bugs/Leaf-footed Bugs Some Coreidae, such as Phyllomorpha laciniata, exhibit parental care by carrying their eggs. This behaviour significantly improves the eggs' chances of avoiding the attacks of parasitoids. Taxonomy and systematics The Coreidae are placed in the order Hemiptera and closely related to the families Alydidae, Hyocephalidae, Rhopalidae, and Stenocephalidae. Together, these five families form the superfamily Coreoidea. The family is large, with more than 1,900 species in over 270 genera. Most taxonomists dealing with the Coreidae divide the family into three or sometimes four subfamilies. Numerous tribes of the Coreinae have previously been proposed for elevation to subfamily rank, for example, the Agriopocorini, Colpurini, Hydarini, Phyllomorphini, and Procamptini, but the only one of these changes that at least a significant minority of researchers currently accept is the elevation of the Agriopocorinae, and recent reviews tend to treat them as a tribe again, recognizing only the three subfamilies known by 1867. Another difficulty is that the genus Eubule has not yet been placed.

A≈°kerc was born into a peasant family near the town of Rimske Toplice in the Duchy of Styria, then part of the Austrian Empire (now in Slovenia). His exact birthplace is unknown because his family was on the move at the time of his birth. After graduating from high school in Celje he entered the Roman Catholic theological seminary in Maribor. He was ordained a priest in 1880. The same year he published his first poem entitled Trije popotniki (\\"The Three Travelers\\") in the progressive literary magazine Ljubljanski zvon. He started his literary career by writing lyric poetry, but after 1882 moved to more epic themes. His post-romantic poems express his patriotism, love and religious doubt. The themes of his ballades and romances come from Slovene and Slavic history, the Bible, folk traditions as well as contemporary life. He became strongly influenced by literary realism, writing some of his best known poems in this style, but never fully rejected post-romanticism. A≈°kerc published his poems in the journal Ljubljanski zvon under the pseudonym Gor√°zd from 1881, but used his real name in his first poetry collection, Balade in romance (\\"Ballades and Romances\\") published in 1890. The collection was warmly accepted by the reading public and critics, but was criticized from the emerging Catholic political activists, such as the bishop Anton Mahniƒç, who disapproved of A≈°kerc's national, freethinking and progressive social ideals. A≈°kerc took an early retirement from his priesthood service. Soon afterwards, he was appointed by Ivan Hribar, the liberal mayor of Ljubljana, as a chief archivist of the Ljubljana City Archives, which he remained until his death. During the last twenty years of his life, his relationship with the conservative Catholic clergy worsened, as did the quality of his literary work. He continued to enjoy full support from the liberal political establishment in Carniola, led by Ivan Tavƒçar and Ivan Hribar. His friendship with the Swedish slavist and historian Alfred Anton Jensen opened him the doors to international recognition: his poems were published in Sweden, Russia, Galicia, Croatia, Serbia, and in the Czech Lands. However, he started losing his influence over younger Slovenian authors. He rejected the poetry of Dragotin Kette and Josip Murn and entered in a dispute with the poet Oton ≈Ωupanƒçiƒç, from which he came as a clear loser. The young writer Ivan Cankar, whom A≈°kerc admired, also published several critically sarcastic essays on A≈°kerc's late poetry, in which he targeted A≈°kerc as being the symptom of the decay of old the Slovenian provincial national-liberal √©lite. Despite the bitter last years of his life ‚Äì in addition to everything mentioned, he lived in a constant fear of losing his job if the conservative Slovenian People's Party had won the municipal elections, which didn't happen -, his funeral in Ljubljana was attended by a huge mass of people, among whom were many of his former adversaries. One of the main thoroughfares in south-central Ljubljana, A≈°kerc Street (), is named after him, as are several other public places and institutions.

Born in Swansea, he signed for Manchester United on leaving school in the summer of 1955 and played on the youth team's outside-right position. He turned professional in 1956 but continued to play for the youth team until the following year, and was captain of the FA Youth Cup winning team in 1957. Career He made his first team debut on 21 December 1957, aged 18, against Leicester City in a league match at Old Trafford, and was soon the club's first-choice outside-right, at the expense of the older and more experienced Johnny Berry. He was injured in the Munich air disaster on 6 February 1958, when still only 18 years old. He was the youngest player involved in the crash and the last survivor to be rescued from the mangled wreckage of the BEA Elizabethan airliner after he was found unconscious amongst the debris by two journalists five hours after the official search was called off. He had played in the last match before the disaster, the European Cup quarter-final second leg against Red Star Belgrade, and had so far made 10 senior appearances for United. He was in hospital for around three weeks after the crash.Five hours after the crash they found me caught under a wheel, says Munich survivor Morgans Although he made a full recovery following the crash and was back in the side before the end of the season, playing a further nine games, he showed little of his previous form on the pitch, and made just four appearances for the first team over the next three seasons. He finally left United in 1961, having made 23 first-team appearances without scoring a goal, and signed for Swansea Town in a ¬£3,000 deal. He then played for Newport County, where he played his last Football League game in 1967 at the age of 28. He then played for Barry Town and his final role in football was as player-manager of Cwmbran Town in the Welsh League. After leaving Manchester United in 1961, he had returned to his native South Wales, where he lived until the end of his life. In 1972 he was appointed as manager of Welsh Football League side Blaenavon Blues where he managed them for a season.https://www.pitchero.com/clubs/blaenavonbluesafc/a/club- history-22121.html After leaving football, he worked as a pub landlord for 10 years at the Lower New Inn Pub in Pontypool South Wales. He later finished his working life as a ship's chandler. Morgans rarely spoke to the media about the Munich air disaster or his time with Manchester United until he was in his sixties, but during the early years of the 21st century, he contributed to a number of media projects, including television documentaries, centred on the Busby Babes and the Munich Air Disaster. Morgans was taken ill at his home in Swansea on 17 November 2012 and admitted to hospital. He died the next morning at the age of 73. He was survived by Stephanie, his wife more than 50 years, and their sons John and Greg.

History The Bodydonnas were formed in 1995 in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) with Skip and Sunny introducing themselves via a series of vignettes. They were fitness fanatics who often made fun of their opponents and the fans. They also demonstrated how fit they were by doing jumping jacks during Skip's matches and performed push ups on fallen opponents. On the July 9, 1995 episode of WWF Wrestling Challenge, Skip was defeated in a booked loss to longtime jobber Barry Horowitz. He got into a feud with Horowitz and lost several more matches. A subsequent storyline saw the Bodydonnas approached by Rad Radford, who wanted to be a Bodydonna. He teamed with Skip until Sunny fired him after The Smoking Gunns defeated the Bodydonnas on the December 23, 1995 episode of Superstars. Skip soon got another partner who was an official Bodydonna in Zip (originally Flip), his kayfabe cousin. They won the vacant WWF Tag Team Championship on March 31, 1996 on the WrestleMania XII pre-show. They then feuded with The Godwinns until they dropped the title to them on May 19. Sunny left the Bodydonnas to follow the gold, becoming the Godwinns' manager until the Godwinns also lost their title, this time to The Smoking Gunns. Sunny then defected to the Gunns' side because she only wanted to manage champions. Meanwhile, the Bodydonnas announced that they were searching for a new manager. They appeared on WWF television programs urging fans to apply for the position. This storyline culminated in the Bodydonnas \\"hiring\\" Cloudy (also spelled Kloudi), who was Candido's friend and wrestler Jimmy Shoulders aka James Haney, dressed as a woman. In September 1996, Skip was injured and the Bodydonnas disbanded. Skip was shortly released while he was injured. He went to ECW and WCW where he met the height of his career and reunited with Sunny. Zip changed gimmicks and became the masked Dr.X as jobber until 1998 when he became a trainer for the WWF. He was released by the company in 2004. The two met each other in ECW on June 28, 1997 when Skip won on ECW Hardcore TV. On April 28, 2005 Skip (Chris Candido) died due to a blood clot following complications from surgery. Zip made a return to WWE (formerly WWF) in January 2007 as the head trainer for Deep South Wrestling, a development territory for WWE. After DSW shut down later that year, he worked for Florida Championship Wrestling a new development territory for WWE. He was released from WWE in May 2012 before FCW folded in August 2012.

Career While in his junior year in Lake View High School, he and several friends formed a small radio clique and obtained amateur licenses. In the early 1920s, there was considerable prestige for amateur operators to have commercial radio licenses, and Bernds was in a good position to enter broadcasting when he graduated in 1923, a year when radio stations began to be established all over Chicago. He found employment -- at age 20 -- as chief operator at Chicago's WENR. When talking pictures began in the late 1920s, Bernds and broadcast operators like him relocated to Hollywood to work as sound technicians in \\"the talkies\\". After a brief period at United Artists, Bernds resigned and worked at Columbia Pictures, where he functioned as sound engineer on many of Frank Capra's classics in the 1930s. He soon established himself as Columbia's best recording technician. Directing the Three Stooges Bernds wanted to be a director, but could not work up the nerve to approach Columbia president Harry Cohn about the reassignment. Frank Capra ran into Bernds one day, and made Bernds promise to talk with Cohn that evening. Cohn, although well aware of Bernds's prowess in the sound department, grudgingly granted Bernds's wish. In 1945, Bernds became a screenwriter and director, first for the Three Stooges short subjects. His first effort with the team was the lackluster A Bird in the Head (1946), which features an ailing Curly Howard. The 41-year-old Howard had suffered a series of minor strokes prior to filming; as a result, his tired performances were marred by slurred speech and slower timing. Though Bernds was initially thrilled at being a director, he was horrified when he realized that Curly was in such bad shape (something Columbia short-subject head Jules White failed to tell Bernds). Years later, Bernds discussed his trying experience during the filming of A Bird in the Head: Realizing that Curly was no longer able to perform in the same capacity as before, Bernds devised ways to cover his illness. Curly could still be the star, but the action was shifted away from the ailing Stooge. In A Bird in the Head, the action focuses more on crazy Professor Panzer and Igor. This allowed Curly to maintain a healthy amount of screen time without being required to contribute much. Bernds often commented that he and Jules White never really got along. As a result, Bernds feared that his directing days would be over as soon as they began if he released A Bird in the Head with a weak Curly as his first entry. Producer Hugh McCollum reshuffled the release order, and the superior Micro-Phonies (1945) was released first, securing Bernds's directing position. Bernds struggled through three additional films, all released in 1946, (The Three Troubledoers, Monkey Businessmen and Three Little Pirates, with Curly in varying stages of decline) until the comedian suffered a debilitating stroke that ended his career. When Shemp Howard replaced his brother Curly as the third Stooge, it breathed new life into the Stooges' films, and allowed Bernds to add new flair and wit to the team's antics. Columbia's short-subject department operated two units, one headed by Jules White, the other by Hugh McCollum. Edward Bernds worked for the McCollum unit, usually collaborating on scripts with Elwood Ullman. Every Columbia series alternated between the White and McCollum units, allowing Bernds to direct the other Columbia comedians: Shemp Howard. Hugh Herbert, Andy Clyde, Gus Schilling and Richard Lane, Joe Besser, Curly Joe DeRita, Vera Vague, Wally Vernon and Eddie Quillan, Harry Von Zell, and Billie Burke, among others. Bernds also began directing the feature-length Blondie series of comedies with Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake. When the Columbia shorts department downsized in 1952, Hugh McCollum was fired and Bernds voluntarily resigned, out of loyalty to McCollum.  Later years  In 1950 Bernds directed Gold Raiders, an independently produced comedy-western co-starring veteran cowboy star George O'Brien and The Three Stooges. This led to an assignment at the Allied Artists studio, directing action features starring Stanley Clements, which in turn led Bernds into Allied Artists' breadwinning series starring The Bowery Boys. Bernds directed Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, and company as though he was still working with the Stooges; the Bernds efforts in the series have the most slapstick content. Bernds has the distinction of receiving an Oscar nomination by mistake. In 1956 the Academy nominated him and co-writer Elwood Ullman for the screen story to High Society. The Academy actually intended the nomination to be for the big-budget Frank Sinatra-Bing Crosby musical. Bernds and Ullman did make a film in 1955 called High Society -- but theirs was a low-budget feature with The Bowery Boys. Graciously and voluntarily, Bernds and Ullman withdrew their nomination, though it still stands in the record books. Bernds graduated to dramatic features in the late 1950s, although he was reunited with the Three Stooges in the 1960s for their feature films, and the live-action portions of their TV cartoons in The New 3 Stooges; due to their advancing age (Moe and Larry were in their 60s by this point) and the constraints of children's television, he was forced to tone down much of the slapstick. He and Ullman also collaborated on an Elvis Presley feature for Allied Artists, Tickle Me. His best-known work from this time period is arguably the 1959 horror film Return of the Fly. Bernds is also known for directing the cult classic science fiction films World Without End, Queen of Outer Space and Valley of the Dragons. Although Bernds had become a proficient all-around director, he confessed to enjoying his short-subject comedies more. Bernds retired in 1965. Bernds's autobiography is \\"Mr. Bernds Goes to Hollywood,\\" published in 1999. It details the earlier stages of his career, before he was a director. Bernds's directorial career is chronicled in \\"The Columbia Comedy Shorts,\\" first published in 1986; Bernds wrote the foreword and is quoted throughout. Outliving most of his peers, Edward Bernds died peacefully on May 20, 2000, in Van Nuys, California.

It is the county seat and had a population, as of the Canada 2011 Census, of 11,491. The city is on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River, east of Quebec City, and was founded more than 350 years ago. It is Canada's Snow Goose Capital, and festivals include the International Accordion Festival in September and the Festival of the Snow Geese in October. The city was named after Charles de Montmagny, the first to have the title of governor of New France. (Samuel de Champlain was commander in chief.) Montmagny was the county seat of the former Montmagny County.

It lies on the Nordgeorgsfehnkanal and is the youngest city in the East Frisia area having been bestowed city rights on the 16th of March 2006, two days later on the 18th of March 2006, Wiesmoor celebrated the Centenary of the settlements founding. The city owes its growth to the industrialisation of the harvesting of peat from the surrounding moors. Wiesmoor holds an annual flower festival and the city is also known as the ‚ÄòFlower City‚Äô, the name originates from the large numbers of flowers which are grown in the city‚Äôs industrial greenhouse. Formerly the greenhouses were heated by waste heat from the now defunct peat burning power station which was located in the city. Wiesmoor also has the official title of a Luftkurort; tourism now plays an important role in the local economy. Geography Wiesmoor liesaround 30 km inland from the North Sea in the North West of Germany in the centre of the historic district East Frisia. The city of Wiesmoor and its surroundings have a population of between 35,000 and 40,000 people. The most South-Easterly community in the Landkreis of Aurich Wiesmoor lies centrally within the East Frisian peninsula. The city is in the district Aurich. In the East, the city borders with the Friedeburg in the district of Wittmund, in the south with Uplengen in the district of Leer. West of Wiesmoor is the village of Gro√üefehn lies and to the North of that the city of Aurich, both in the district of Aurich. The closest large cities to Wiesmoor are Wilhelmshaven (30 km to the North East), Oldenburg (45 km to the South East), Bremen (80 km to the South East) as well as the Dutch city of Groningen (80 km to the South West). The entire metropolitan area of Wiesmoor extends to an area of 82.99 km¬≤. The city has dimensions of approximately 11 km in the North-South direction and about 7 km in the East-West Direction. The city of Wiesmoor lies in the middle part of the East Frisian raised bog, which was formed by glaciation, and contained up to 1900 layers of peat up to 8m deep. Originally the bog had an area of around 100km2 although the majority of that is now covered by the city. The city ranges over heights of 10.6 to 14m above sea level, with the average being 11m. Wiesmoor was laid out in 1906, the city today consists of the original 20th century planned city and an additional 9 quarters. A peculiarity of Wiesmoor lies therein that almost all current quarters of the city are older than the City Centre itself. History The bog area around Wiesmoor remained mostly uninhabited for a long time. The earliest records for the presence of people are a Stone Age axe and an earthen vessel from the pre-Roman Iron Age that were discovered in Marcardsmoor. It is likely that these items belonged to someone who drowned in the bog rather than an indication of a durable settlement. In the bog in Wilhelmsfehn a neck ring from around 700BCE has also been found. In 1999 a bronze hatchet which has dated to the middle of the Bronze Age was discovered amongst rubbish in Ostgro√üefehn. The hatchet is unique to East Frisia and it is likely that it was disposed of in the bog rather than originating in the area. In 1633 colonisation of the bog area surrounding Wiesmoor began, however by 1880 there was still only around 100 inhabitants living within the current city area. In the beginning of the 20th century plans were drawn up by Dr. Eberhard Ramm from the Prussian Ministry of Agriculture to begin industrial harvesting of peat from the bogs, this would be done use large machinery rather than the traditional methods of spades and hoes. Further to this Dr. Ramm, in co-operation with Carl Friedrich von Siemens, also planned to construct a new peat burning power plant in the area. In 1906, the Nordgeorgsfehnkanal was constructed through the bog in order to be able to drain the area. While in the beginning only specialists and prison labourers came to work by 1907 the first residents to Wiesmoor began to arrive and by 1909 the peat power plant was in operation. The plant was originally owned by Siemens until 1921 when it was taken over by the North West German Power Plants Company (Nordwestdeutschen Kraftwerke AG). The plant provided power all the way from Ems down to the lower Elbe. The waste heat from the power plant was used from 1925 onwards to warm greenhouses to allow the year- round growing of flowers and vegetables, with an area of about 75,000 square meters the greenhouse at Wiesmoor was the largest in Europe at the time. During the Second World War, there was a slave labor camp at Wiesmoor where a large number of civilian prisoners were brought from Poland, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and France, among other countries, to forced labor in the bogs. According to Eugeniusz Popielarz, who was imprisoned there as a young Polish teenager from May 1942 until May 1945 with his mother and three brothers, the older teens and adults dug the peat while the younger pre-teen and teenage boys would push loaded railwagons up an incline on a narrow gauge railway so that they could coast downhill to assemble the train, powered by a peat-fired small locomotive, which would then take the peat to the power plant. In order to make it harder for the boys up the incline, often a German guard or Ukrainian collaborator known as a vorarbeiter would sit atop the already laden railwagon shouting his commands. The living conditions were deplorable in shabby barracks with ill-fitting doors and rotten floorboards through which rats and weasels would make their way into the prisoners living quarters at night, especially in the colder months. The daily ration, according to Eugeniusz, was \\"not enough to promote life and too much to permit death.\\" Though the camp was basically open, with moderate security to prevent mutiny, there was really no hope for these civilian slave laborers to escape. There was one exception, however, with regards to this camp, namely a section for Soviet POWs. Their misfortune, according to Eugeniusz, was to be fenced-in behind barbed wire and literally starved to the point that they denuded the earth in the corral of grass which they ate, roots and all, seeking sustenance. They were mocked by the German, Ukrainian, and few Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian guards, when they begged for \\"a nibble of bread\\" - \\"–∫—É—Å–æ–∫ —Ö–ª–µ–±–∞.\\" If a slave laborer ever approached out of pity to share his/her ration with these hapless Soviets, they were shot - even for sharing a cigarette. Needless to say, beatings of slave laborers were commonplace to make them work \\"more efficiently.\\" If a slave took sick and could not work, he/she did not eat. In order to possibly increase their food ration, slaves were permitted to take on extra work as farm laborers for any of the local Bauern (farmers). For example, honey, aspirin, and other items for ill relative internees were obtainable this way from a few kindhearted farm families. Eugeniusz recalled his own illness when honey for a pustule in his throat was obtained in this way. After their additional work on the farms, the slave laborers were expected to observe a curfew and return to their barracks for evening Appel. Because of the proximity of Emden, Wilhelmshaven, Oldenburg, and Bremen, Wiesmoor had lain under major air corridors used by the RAF and their Commonwealth allies and others at night, and the USAAF during the day. There were, weather permitting, very frequent nighttime and daylight air raids traversing overhead. At night, the RAF and others (including Poles, Czechs, Norwegians, Dutch, and South Africans) often enough missed their targets with bundled incendiary and fragmentation bombs which inadvertently hit the area around Wiesmoor and embedded themselves in the peat bogs. Eugeniusz remembered that prisoners caught stealing food were condemned to the \\"disposal\\" of these unexploded bombs (UXBs), all too often with tragic results of which he was a witness from a distance. Other \\"violations\\" were dealt with by public hangings, or outright shooting of the prisoner by a guard or guards. There were, at least, three Allied plane crashes in the area - a bomber and two fighters which he remembered. One of the downed fighters was a P-51 Mustang of the famed Tuskegee Airmen (\\"Red Tails\\"). The pilot successfully bailed out and was rescued by one of his squadron-mates who landed to allow his buddy to climb behind him into the cockpit while part of the squadron covered them from above. The camp at Wiesmoor was liberated on the morning of 5 May 1945 by forward units of the 1st Polish Armored Division commanded by Major General Stanisaw Maczek. Two days later, the Division received the surrender of the command of the Kriegsmarine's base at Wilhelmshaven where most of Germany's U-boots were moored. After the second world war, the Ernst Benary flower company erected a further twenty greenhouses and sowed forty hectares of outdoors area. This can be regarded as the start of Wiesmoor as the ‚ÄòFlower City‚Äô. Around 40,000 people were visiting the town annually by this time and plans were put down to for the building of a baths, an open-air stage and for the extension of the park into a health establishment. In 1951 the boundaries of Wiesmoor were redrawn, several local villages became part of the towns and the area was incorporated into the district of Aurich. With 51.64 square kilometers, Wiesmoor was now the largest town by area in East Frisia, at this time the town had a total of 5,166 inhabitants. 1952 saw the staging of the first flower festival or Bl√ºtenfest in German. In that year the peat power plant was employing around 1,200 people and roughly 120,000 tons of peat was being harvested annually. A Further 200 people worked in the greenhouses, whose products, such as tomatoes and cucumber, were exported into neighboring European countries. The peat power plant was dismantled 1966 to be replaced with a larger capacity gas turbine power plant. The loss of jobs caused by the closure of the power plant was helped by the growth of local company Bohlen and Doyen who have grown to become easily the largest employer in the city. In 1972 further changes to local boundaries meant that Wiesmoor continued to grow in size and population by incorporating more local villages. In 1977 the town was designated as a Luftkurort, literally an air spa, due to its high air quality. On Friday 13 January 1989, a half year after the Ramstein Airshow Disaster, there was a collision of several military jets at low altitude over the Hinrichsfehn area of Wiesmoor. A tornado of the Royal Air Force collided with a squadron of German Alphas Jets of the Jagdbombergeschwader 43 division. One of the German Alpha Jets was seriously damaged but managed to make an emergency landing, the a further Alpha Jet and the Tornado were destroyed, the pilot of the Alpha Jet managed to eject but the two pilots in the Tornado died in the accident. The wreckage from the jets landed near a primary school in South Wiesmoor. In 1995 the gas turbine power plant was demolished. On the 16th of March 2006, Wiesmoor was granted city status. Lower Saxony Secretary of the Interior, Uwe Sch√ºnemann, delivered the documentation personally and congratulated the city on its rapid growth over the last 100 years. Bl√ºtenfest The flower festival in Wiesmoor was first took place in 1952, the festival is held annually on the first weekend in September (from Thursday to Monday). The festival consist of displays of flowers as well as a parade with floats. Each year at the time of the festival a new Bl√ºtenk√∂nigin or Blossom Queen is selected. On the Saturday evening of the festival the old Bl√ºtenk√∂nigin parachutes over the sports ground which is the signal to start a party which culminates in a large fireworks display. A new Bl√ºtenk√∂nigin is selected on the Sunday afternoon and on Monday the festival concludes with the ‚ÄòKanal in Flammen‚Äô (literally canal in flames) which is a large fireworks display held on and around the Nordgeorgsfehnkanal See also *Vossbarg ReferencesExternal links * Official site * Wiesmoor-info * Wiesmoor in Nordwest Travel Magazin * Wiesmoor forum Category:Towns and villages in East Frisia Category:Aurich (district) ","title":"Wiesmoor"},{"id":"1887104","text":"Rete may refer to: *Net (device), in Latin *The Network (), a former Italian political party *Rete algorithm, an efficient pattern matching algorithm for implementing production rule systems *Part of an astrolabe, a historical astronomical instrument *Net-like anatomic structures: Rete canalis hypoglossi, Rete carpale dorsale, Rete mirabile, Rete ovarii, Rete patellare, Rete pegs and ridges, Rete testes, Rete venosum.

It runs from Ferrysburg to Nunica in Ottawa County, passing through Spring Lake. The highway serves as a connector between Interstate 96 (I-96) and US Highway 31 (US 31), helping connect Grand Haven with the Grand Rapids metro area. A related Connector 104 runs between the M-104 and US 31 in Ferrysburg. During the 1920s and 1930s, a different highway bore the M-104 designation. The current highway was previously a section of US 16 until 1940 when that designation was shifted to a road going from Nunica to Muskegon; the orphaned highway was redesignated M-104 at the same time. Since then, two routing changes have caused short segments to be transferred to local control and removed from the highway. Route description The western terminus of M-104 is at US 31 in Ferrysburg at the north end of the drawbridge spanning the Grand River north of Grand Haven. The highway runs along Savidge Street and crosses a bridge over the channel that connect the river with Spring Lake. On the opposite shore, the trunkline continues along Savidge Street, running between the river to its south and the lake to its north. M-104 crosses the central business area of the village of Spring Lake. East of downtown, the highway transitions to follow Cleveland Street which continues due east to Nunica. The landscape becomes more rural east of Spring Lake where the highway crosses terrain with a mix of open fields and woods. There are various businesses and homes that line the roadway. The eastern terminus of M-104 is located at the exit 9 interchange along I-96 just west of Nunica. Like other state highways in Michigan, M-104 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 20,663 vehicles used the highway daily in near the western terminus in Ferrysburg and 8,018 vehicles did so each day near the eastern terminus near Nunica, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. No section of M-104 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History=Previous designation From 1927 until 1939, the first M-104 followed a gravel road from M-47 (now M-52) at Pittsburg, through Laingsburg, to DeWitt, and the current M-104 was originally part of US 16. Current designation In 1940, a rerouting of US 16 eliminated M-126 between Nunica and Muskegon; the previous routing of US 16 between Nunica and Ferrysburg was redesignated M-104 at this time. This highway designation was truncated on November 25, 1961, after the I-96/US 16 freeway opened, and the section of M-104 between the freeway and the old US 16 routing was transferred to local control. Another short segment of the highway was bypassed when a new bridge was built between Spring Lake and Ferrysburg in 1965. Major intersectionsRelated trunkline Connector 104 is an unsigned trunkline in Ferrysburg that runs north along Pine Street and west along 3rd Street to connect exit 104B on US 31 to M-104. According to MDOT, 14,231 vehicles used the trunkline on average each day.

Pollack is involved in the women's spirituality movement. Tarot reading Pollack has written Salvador Dali's Tarot, a book-length exposition of Salvador Dali's Tarot deck, comprising a full-page color plate for each card, with her commentary on the facing page. Pollack's work 78 Degrees of Wisdom on Tarot reading is commonly referenced by Tarot readers. She has created her own Tarot deck, Shining Woman Tarot (later Shining Tribe Tarot). She also aided in the creation of the Vertigo Tarot Deck with illustrator Dave McKean and author Neil Gaiman, and she wrote a book to accompany it. Comics Pollack, known for her run of issues 64‚Äì87 (1993-1995) on the comic book Doom Patrol, on DC Comics' Vertigo imprint,, a continuation of a 1960s comic which had recently became a cult favorite under Grant Morrison. She took over the series in 1993 after meeting editor Tom Peyer at a party, telling him it was the only monthly comic book she would want to write at the time, and sending him a sample script. Towards the end of Morrison's run Pollack began writing monthly \\"letters to the editor\\" in what she describes as a \\"gee-whiz fangirl\\" voice asking to take over the book when Morrison was finished. In the final letter she claims that she had already told her mother that she had been given the job. Peyer then used that response to that letter to officially announce that Pollack was, in fact, taking over the book. As a result of these letters being printed in the letter column of Doom Patrol issues some people seem to believe that the letters are the way she actually got the job. During her tenure Pollack dealt with such rarely addressed comic-book topics as menstruation, sexual identity, and transsexuality. Pollack's run ended two years later, with the book's cancellation. In addition to Doom Patrol, Pollack has written issues of the Vertigo Visions anthology featuring Brother Power the Geek (1993) and Tomahawk (1998), the first 11 issues of the fourth volume of New Gods (1995), and the five issue limited series Time Breakers (1996) for the short lived Helix imprint. Author Neil Gaiman has sometimes consulted Rachel Pollack on the tarot for his stories. In 2019 it was announced that Pollack was reuniting with Doom Patrol artist Richard Case and letterer John Workman to create a short story--titled \\"Snake Song\\"--for the Kickstarter funded \\"music themed horror anthology\\" Dead Beats.

Representing Manchester United, he played in the 1956 and 1957 Football League championship-winning teams. Known for his pace and agility, Wood had the opportunity to be a professional sprinter, but opted instead to play football. He played for England at international level on three occasions between 1954 and 1956 and, after retiring from playing in 1968, managed football clubs in the US, Cyprus, Greece, Kenya and the United Arab Emirates. Playing career Wood (back row, fourth from left) in a Manchester United team photo in 1957 Wood started his career as an amateur with Newcastle United, though he failed to make a first team appearance and moved to Darlington in 1949. He only stayed for three months though before joining Manchester United, making his first team debut against Newcastle at Old Trafford in the league on 3 December 1949. Over the next few seasons he gradually displaced the ageing Jack Crompton as United's first choice goalkeeper. During the 1957 FA Cup Final against Aston Villa, Wood was the victim of what was then a perfectly legal shoulder charge. In the sixth minute of the game Wood successfully claimed a cross; however, Villa outside-left Peter McParland clattered into him, breaking Wood's jaw due to him ducking to avoid the challenge. As this game was played in the era before substitutes Jackie Blanchflower was forced to play in goal following the incident, Wood eventually came back on after treatment to play as a forward, United went on to lose the game 2‚Äì1. His compensation for this was a Football League First Division title medal to add to the first medal he had gained a year earlier. In 1954, when only 23 years old, he was selected to play for the England team. In December 1957, United signed Harry Gregg from Doncaster Rovers for ¬£23,500 ‚Äì the world record fee for a goalkeeper at the time ‚Äì and Wood found his first-team opportunities limited. Wood was among the survivors of the Munich air disaster on 6 February 1958, suffering minor injuries, but played just one first-team game afterwards and was later sold to Huddersfield Town within a year. He spent seven seasons at Huddersfield, playing more than 250 first-team games, although he was unable to help them win promotion to the First Division. In 1965, he played in the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League with Toronto Inter-Roma. He then played one season at Bradford City, before finishing his career with two seasons at Barnsley. Several years after leaving Manchester United, Matt Busby unsuccessfully tried to re-sign him for Manchester United when Harry Gregg was injured. Managerial career He continued as a manager in several countries including United States, Ireland, Zambia, Canada, Greece, Kenya, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates. He coached Cyprus and Kenya national football teams. He also coached the NASL team Los Angeles Wolves and the Cypriot team APOEL in 1971‚Äì72. Personal life Wood married his wife Elizabeth in 1954. They had two daughters, but the couple divorced during the 1970s. He died in July 2002 aged 71 in Bexhill-on-Sea, having returned to England after the end of his coaching career overseas. His death was the result of a heart attack.

The genre is known for its association with the lower middle class to upper-class youth in Zimbabwe, with Trap Music being the most popular sub- genre. History=1990‚Äì2000 During this golden era, hip hop emerged as a global voice, spreading like wildfire. It was only a matter of time until it spread to Zimbabwe, where the youth embraced it with open arms. The earliest recordings of hip hop were mostly on vinyl and tape and were not converted to cd, mp3, or modern media and hence they have become very rare. The most mainstream acts of the time were Piece of Ebony, Fortune Muparutsa, [with rap verses on songs like Rumors (1991)], and Midnight Magic [with songs like Blackness featuring Mau Mau ]. Since most vinyl records and cassette tapes are no-longer accessible or in playable condition, Zimbabwe lost a huge chunk of its earlier catalog, from which, the next generation of artists could draw inspiration from. This also rendered sampling from predecessors virtually non- existent. During the second half of this 10-year period, beginning on their own and later with the influence of Innocent Tshuma (then known as The Millennium Man), youths across the country would begin to participate in the genre. The instrumentation, form, and culture began to lean more towards adopting the globally successful American hip hop trend, leaning less on the stagnant and non-evolving local Mbira Hip Hop. Though exported globally by groups like Zimbabwe Legit, Hip hop was and still is in the shadow of other genres like Museve, Reggae, Kwaito, jazz, choral, folk and African House).In 2016 artists like Takura took over the stage and having a number of people following his music but he wasn't the only who was singing hip hop but he was the first to be recognized as he was in stiff competition with Zimdancehall 2001‚Äìpresent Since 2001 a number of artists and businessmen have branched out to form their own brands, record labels, and radio stations. This has resulted in most monopolies losing their grip on the industry and diluting their power in distribution, influence, airplay, and the ability to predict the next big artist. Artists began selling their own CDs in the streets with varying success. Shows such as Mashoko and The Circle done at The Mannernburg in Harare are also measures that have been taken to popularize hip-hop in Zimbabwe. Poets and emcees include Osama, Outspoken, Synik, Upmost, Godobori, Aura, Blackbird (now known as Temple) among others. Some of these poets incite politics in their music and have started a movement known as House Of Hunger. Mashoko later developed from a once a month festival known as Shoko Fest, which included international acts like Hired Gun (USA) and Akala, among others. Many Zimbabwean emcees performed at the show, ongoing since 2010. The same year, Zim Hip Hop Awards began; although controversial, they have survived to the present day. Artists have recently begun to bypass physical means of distributing their music and have joined digital distribution channels, linked to social media and clout. Music videos and promotional music are now being used to gather followers. Prolific artists are now hiring or being approached by industry managers, to handle their affairs in a more professional manner. In 2018 there was an introduction of female artists in the industry like Tashamiswa, who is one of the most important female pioneers of the game Style and influences=Influences Hip hop has grown more and more influential since its inception. Its use of high tech equipment has also ensured that it remains fresh and relevant, being re-birthed with each technological advancement. America has remained at the forefront of the movement with the rest of the world catching up. Zimbabwe, as with most countries, usually mirrors the trending sound in America, and uses it as a benchmark for quality and is up to date. This has seen many acts using the same flow and drum kits used by their favorite rapper and producer. Zimbabwean identity There are a few pioneering acts that are now trying to move away from the influence of American hip hop and reinvent themselves by building and branding themselves as kings, nobles, and sons of renown. Some have resorted to making remakes and remixes of old records they consider hits, whereas some have resorted to sampling traditional or folk songs and making collaborations with bigger and more established names from competing and more successful genres. Acts are also making more use of their traditional languages (Shona and Ndebele), and in-cooperating local instruments such as Mbira, Marimba, Ngoma (traditional drums) or Hosho (traditional shaker). Colonial-era acts like August Musarurwa and Simon Mashoko have proved that influencing, inspiring, or impressing American musicians, is possible as they were sampled or covered for their work by greats like Louis Armstrong and 213 ( Snoop Dogg, Warren G, Nate Dogg), supporting the argument to incorporate or establish local, unique, distinguishable identities. Media=Radio Radio has helped the genre a lot, with some hits only existing online, within podcasts such as Radio Kunakirwa, which are now the only proof of their existence. This means that radio catalogs and podcasts are now a vital source of history and library for the genre. Apart from airplay, some radio stations have devoted segments dedicated to one genre. * School of Hip Hop * Zim Hip Hop Explosion Television There are a few shows dedicated to Hip-Hop on Zimbabwe's local broadcaster. * HipHop263 Fresh hip-hop zw hiphopZW References ","title":"Zimbabwean hip hop"},{"id":"1887121","text":"Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) is a chronic disorder in which a person has flashbacks of visual hallucinations or distortions experienced during a previous hallucinogenic drug experience, usually lacking the same feelings of mental intoxication experienced before. Hallucinations are usually not intense or impairing and consist of visual snow, trails and after images (palinopsia), light fractals on flat surfaces, intensified colors or other psychedelic visuals. To be diagnosed, the disorder must cause distress or impairment in work or everyday life. The flashbacks may be continuous or just occasional. Symptoms often get worse when focused on. HPPD subtypes According to a 2016 review, there are two theorized subtypes of the condition: Type 1 HPPD This is where people experience HPPD in the form of random, brief flashbacks. Type 2 HPPD People with this kind of HPPD experience ongoing changes to their vision, which may vary in intensity. Cause The only certain cause for HPPD is prior use of hallucinogens. Some evidence points to phenethylamines carrying a slightly greater risk than lysergamides or tryptamines. There are no known risk factors, and what might trigger any specific disturbing hallucination is not known. Some sort of disinhibition of visual processing may be involved. It has been suggested MDMA (ecstasy) use with other drugs is linked to the development of HPPD. Diagnosis HPPD is a DSM-5 diagnosis with diagnostic code 292.89 (F16.983). For the diagnosis to be made, other psychological, psychiatric, or neurological conditions must be ruled out and it must cause distress in everyday life. Treatment As of 2020 there is still no good evidence of any specific medicinal treatment as being commonly effective for HPPD. Some reports point to sedatives being helpful and stimulants and cannabis worsening symptoms. Avoiding any additional use of psychoactive drugs (including cannabis and alcohol) from an early stage of the disorder seems to be the most effective way in which most sufferers achieve recovery, as these substances apparently worsen the condition over time. Some prescription drugs (Lamictal, clonazepam and keppra) have been known to relieve symptoms for some, but worsen symptoms or create dependencies for others. Antipsychotic drugs and SSRIs have also been reported to help some people but worsen symptoms for others. Some sufferers have reported benefits from prolonged water fasting, medications like NAC and Lithium, and from supplements like L-Tyrosine, Ashwagandha and lion's mane, although some users report lion's mane and Ashwagandha as having potentially negative effects or creating dependencies. Sunglasses and talk therapy might also help those who are dealing HPPD, but in general it seems that maintaining sobriety from all psychoactive substances is still the best solution available for this condition, as it's been proven to naturally relieve the disorder over time. Prevalence The prevalence of HPPD was unknown as of 2018. Estimates in the 1960s and 1970s were around 1 in 20 for intermittent HPPD among regular users of hallucinogens. It is not clear how common chronic HPPD may be, but one estimate in the 1990s was that 1 in 50,000 regular users might have chronic hallucinations. In popular culture In the second episode of the first season of the 2014 series True Detective (\\"Seeing Things\\"), primary character Rustin Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) is depicted as having symptoms similar to HPPD such as light tracers as a result of \\"neurological damage\\" from substance use.

Their look was from the new wave music scene with black eye paint and spiked hair with a rattail (Borden's bleached blonde and Hellwig's dyed black). The two men would go on to individual success under the ring names of Sting and the Ultimate Warrior, respectively. History Steve Borden and Jim Hellwig originally teamed as part of Powerteam USA, a group of four wrestlers who debuted in 1985 after being trained by Red Bastien and Rick Bassman. In addition to Borden and Hellwig, the group consisted of Garland Donoho and Mark Miller. The team was managed by Bassman as they tried to break into the wrestling business. After only a short time in the business both Donoho and Miller quit due to lack of success and business savvy. Initially, Hellwig and Borden wrestled as The Freedom Fighters (Justice and Flash, respectively) in Jerry Jarrett's Continental Wrestling Association initially as fan favorites then later as villains, first led by \\"coach\\" Buddy Wayne,\\"January, February and March 1986 ...

On December 28 1985, the duo gave a TV interview with Lance Russell in which they wore black makeup and announced that they would henceforth be known as The Blade Runners (Hellwig was called Rock and Borden became Sting). Shortly afterwards the team began working for Bill Watts' Mid-South Wrestling (renamed the Universal Wrestling Federation soon after) in early 1986. The Blade Runners were managed by \\"Hot Stuff\\" Eddie Gilbert and as part of \\"Hot Stuff International, Inc.\\" the team feuded with Ted DiBiase and Steve Williams. In his autobiography The Road Warriors: Danger, Death, and the Rush of Wrestling, Joseph Laurinaitis (aka Road Warrior Animal) stated that Watts was the actual creator of the Blade Runners and that he brought them into Mid-South Wrestling with the intent of presenting them as a parody of The Road Warriors. Less than six months after arriving in Mid-South, Hellwig and Borden split up with Hellwig moving on to World Class Championship Wrestling, where he became known as The Dingo Warrior, laying the foundation for his famous Ultimate Warrior gimmick in the WWF. Laurinaitis further stated that Hellwig kept the Warrior gimmick to present himself as an offspring of the Road Warriors. Borden remained in the UWF and under the tutelage of Eddie Gilbert for a while before turning face. As Sting, Borden was among the wrestlers whose contracts were acquired by Jim Crockett Jr. when he bought the UWF in 1987. Reunion The two men reunited for one match on WCW Monday Nitro on October 12, 1998, against Hollywood Hogan and Bret Hart of nWo Hollywood. However, the Blade Runners name was not used for this appearance. Sting and Warrior won the match via disqualification due to interference from the nWo.

It was first released in 1919 and stars Conrad Veidt and Reinhold Sch√ºnzel. The story was co-written by Richard Oswald and Magnus Hirschfeld, who also had a small part in the film and partially funded the production through his Institute for Sexual Science. The film was intended as a polemic against the then-current laws under Germany's Paragraph 175, which made homosexuality a criminal offense. It is believed to be the first pro-gay film in the world.In 1919, the first pro-gay movie was made. A year later, it was banned. The cinematography was by Max Fassbender, who two years previously had worked on Das Bildnis des Dorian Gray, one of the earliest cinematic treatments of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. Director Richard Oswald later became a director of more mainstream films, as did his son Gerd. Veidt became a major film star the year after Anders was released, in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Anders als die Andern is one of the first sympathetic portrayals of homosexuals in cinema. The film's basic plot was used again in the 1961 UK film, Victim, starring Dirk Bogarde. Censorship laws enacted in reaction to films like Anders als die Andern eventually restricted viewing of this movie to doctors and medical researchers, and prints of the film were among the many \\"decadent\\" works burned by the Nazis after they came to power in 1933. Plot Veidt portrays a successful violinist, Paul K√∂rner, who falls in love with one of his male students. A sleazy extortionist threatens to expose K√∂rner as a homosexual. Flashbacks show us how K√∂rner became aware of his orientation and tried first to change it, then to understand it. K√∂rner and the extortionist end up in court, where the judge is sympathetic to the violinist, but when the scandal becomes public, K√∂rner's career is ruined and he is driven to suicide. The film opens with Paul K√∂rner (Conrad Veidt), a successful violinist reading the daily newspaper obituaries, which are filled with vaguely worded and seemingly inexplicable suicides. K√∂rner, however, knows that Paragraph 175 is hidden behind them all‚Äîthat it hangs over German homosexuals \\"like the Sword of Damocles.\\" After this thesis statement, the main plot begins. Kurt Sivers (Fritz Schulz) is a fan and admirer of K√∂rner and approaches him in hopes of becoming a student of his. K√∂rner agrees, and they begin lessons together, during which they fall for one another. Both men experience the disapproval of their parents. Neither are out, but Sivers's parents object to the increasingly large amount of attention he focuses on the violin and his unusual infatuation with K√∂rner, and the K√∂rners do not understand why he has shown no interest in finding a wife and starting a family. K√∂rner sends his parents to see his mentor, the Doctor (Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld). The Doctor appears several times in the film, each time to deliver speeches more intended for the audience than the advancement of the plot. In this, his first appearance, he tells K√∂rner's parents: After K√∂rner's coming out, he and Sivers begin seeing each other more openly. While walking together, hand in hand, through the park, they pass a man who recognizes K√∂rner. Later that day, when K√∂rner is alone, this man, Franz Bollek (Reinhold Sch√ºnzel) confronts him and demands hush money or else he will expose Sivers. K√∂rner pays him and keeps it a secret from Sivers that he does so. Eventually, however, the blackmailer's demands become too great and K√∂rner refuses to pay (Bollek reads K√∂rner's reply to his demand in a gay bar). Bollek decides instead to break into K√∂rner's house while he and Sivers are performing, but he is discovered by Sivers and K√∂rner on their return and a fight breaks out. In the course of the fight, Bollek reveals to Sivers that he has been blackmailing him. Sivers runs away and faces hardships trying to survive alone. K√∂rner is left dejected and, over a photo of Sivers, remembers his past. His first memory is of boarding school, when he and his boyfriend Max are discovered kissing by their teacher and he is expelled. Next, he remembers University and his solitary and lonely life there, and the growing impossibility of trying to play straight. alt=Thin, intense young man and mustachioed older one, looking at each other He remembers trying an ex-gay hypnotherapist, but finding him only to be a charlatan. Then he first met the Doctor, whose reaction was much different from those he had previously met. Among other things, he told him: Remembering further, he recalled first meeting Bollek at a gay dance hall, and Bollek leading him on before ultimately turning on him and using his homosexuality to blackmail him. Back in the present, K√∂rner takes Else Sivers (Anita Berber), Kurt Sivers' sister, to the Doctor's lecture on alternative sexuality. The Doctor speaks on topics such as homosexuality, lesbianism, gender identity, intersexuality, the perils of stereotypes, and the idea that sexuality is physically determined, rather than a mental condition. Enlightened by the presentation, Else renounces her wish for a relationship with K√∂rner and instead pledges her friendship and support. K√∂rner reports Bollek for blackmail and has him arrested. In retaliation, Bollek exposes K√∂rner. The Doctor gives testimony on K√∂rner's behalf, but both are found guilty of their respective crimes. Bollek is sentenced to three years for extortion. The judge is sympathetic to K√∂rner, and gives him the minimum sentence allowable: one week. Allowed to go home before starting his term, K√∂rner finds himself shunned by friends and strangers alike, and no longer employable. Even his family tells him there is only one honorable way out. He then takes a handful of pills, committing suicide. Sivers rushes to his side as he lies dead. K√∂rner's parents blame Sivers for what has happened, but Else harshly rebukes them. Meanwhile, Sivers attempts to kill himself as well, but the Doctor prevents him and delivers his final speech: The film closes with an open German law book, turned to Paragraph 175, as a hand holding a brush crosses it out.  Reception  The film premiered in May 1919 and was initially successful at the cinema. Shortly after the premiere, conservative Catholic, Protestant, and anti-semitic right- wing groups started to protest and disturb the public screenings. This initiated an extensive public debate on censorship. The constitution of the Weimar Republic initially assured freedom of speech and expression, but special qualifications were created for cinema in response to the Different from the Others production and screenings. According to these special articles, films which were characterised as obscene or as dangerous to young people were to be censored. Hirschfeld organised screenings of the film for members of Weimar National Assembly, Prussian State Council, Landtag of Prussia, and government officials in Institut f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft. This did not yield any results, and in May 1920, specific censorship provisions for films were approved by legislators. The censor office was created in Berlin and its first review was of Different from the Others. The censorship commission consisted of three psychiatrists: Emil Kraepelin, Albert Moll, and Siegfried Placzek, all opponents of Hirschfeld and his advocacy of the legalization of homosexuality. The panel eventually recommended a ban on the public screening of the film, which was put in place in October 1920. The judgement was that the film was biased towards Paragraph 175 and thus presents a one-sided view, confuses young audience about homosexuality, and can be used for the recruitment of underage viewers to become homosexuals. The film was allowed to be shown only in private and to medical professionals. At the end, the only venue where the film was screened for public was Institut f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft, where it was shown for education and at special events. Other information The film, which co-starred and was co-written by sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld, refers to Hirschfeld's theory of \\"sexual intermediacy\\". The theory places homosexuality within a broad spectrum comprising heterosexuality, bisexuality, transgenderism, and transvestism (a word invented by Hirschfeld). The film's protagonist first meets his blackmailer at a costume party, and the blackmailer also frequents a drag club; these scenes are the earliest film footage of gay men and lesbians dancing. The film was initially shipped in 40 copies throughout Germany and the Netherlands by Oswald, and it was shown for nearly a year before the authorities stepped in and banned public screenings, allowing it to be shown only to doctors and lawyers. The Nazis destroyed the majority of the prints and only one copy of the film is known to exist. UCLA Film and Television Archive purchased an original fine-grain master positive of film's footage, which Hirschfeld inserted in his own film ‚ÄúLaws of Love‚Äù from the Russian State Film and Photo Archive. The early gay anthem Das lila Lied from 1920 appears to reference the film's title at the start of its chorus (\\"Wir sind nun einmal anders als die Andern\\"). Modern screenings The film was screened as part of the official program at Outfest in 2012. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Teddy Awards, the film was selected to be shown at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2016. In October 21, 2016, Different from the Others was screened at NewFest - New York's LGBT Film Festival. The film was also screened in a special event in Jerusalem Cinematheque.

Retrieved 2015-6-28. Proceeding from Cohen's initial question \\"What are the minimum conditions under which a set of marks functions as an image?\\", AARON has been in continual development since 1973. The name \\"AARON\\" does not seem to be an acronym; rather, it was a name chosen to start with the letter \\"A\\" so that the names of successive programs could follow it alphabetically. However, Cohen did not create any other major programs.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xbt8lzWxIQ Initial versions of AARON created abstract drawings that grew more complex through the 1970s. More representational imagery was added in the 1980s; first rocks, then plants, then people. In the 1990s more representational figures set in interior scenes were added, along with color. AARON returned to more abstract imagery, this time in color, in the early 2000s. Cohen used machines that allowed AARON to produce physical artwork. The first machines drew in black and white using a succession of custom-built \\"turtle\\" and flatbed plotter devices. Cohen would sometimes color these images by hand in fabric dye (Procion), or scale them up to make larger paintings and murals. In the 1990s Cohen built a series of digital painting machines to output AARON's images in ink and fabric dye. His later work used a large-scale inkjet printer on canvas. Development of AARON began in the C programming language then switched to Lisp in the early 1990s. Cohen credits Lisp with helping him solve the challenges he faced in adding color capabilities to AARON. An article about Cohen appeared in Computer Answers that describes AARON and shows two line drawings that were exhibited at the Tate gallery. The article goes on to describe the workings of AARON, then running on a DEC VAX 750 minicomputer. Raymond Kurzweil's company has produced a downloadable screensaver of AARON for Microsoft Windows PCs. This version of AARON can also produce printable images. AARON's source code is not publicly available, but Cohen has described AARON's operations in various essays and it is discussed in abstract in Pamela McCorduck's book. AARON cannot learn new styles or imagery on its own; each new capability must be hand-coded by Cohen. It is capable of producing a practically infinite supply of distinct images in its own style. Examples of these images have been exhibited in galleries worldwide. AARON's artwork has been used as an artistic equivalent of the Turing test.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps2j85GpjLg It does seem however that AARON's output follows a noticeable formula (figures standing next to a potted plant, framed within a colored square is a common theme). Cohen is very careful not to claim that AARON is creative. But he does ask \\"If what AARON is making is not art, what is it exactly, and in what ways, other than its origin, does it differ from the 'real thing?' If it is not thinking, what exactly is it doing?\\" ‚Äî The further exploits of AARON, Painter. However, it could be argued that AARON is simply following procedural instructions and that the real artist behind each piece is AARON's creator, Cohen. Adding further weight to this argument is AARON's seemingly narrow 'library' of human form variations, poses and scene compositions and the requirement of hard coding to add new 'styles'.

The parish covers an area of . History The fen edge north of Cambridge was well populated in Roman times, and the village's situation on a Roman road will have helped its growth. The road, Akeman Street, which once joined Ely to London, passes close to the village from north to south. Car Dyke, the Roman drainage canal known locally as the Tilling, also runs through the village and in medieval times marked the boundary between the marshes of Landbeach and neighbouring Waterbeach. Drainage of the parish was not completed until the 18th century, and for much of the year large areas of the parish were inundated. The village was listed as Utbech (\\"out bec\\") in the Domesday Book and in the 13th and 14th centuries was occasionally referred to as Inbech (\\"in bec\\"). The original meaning of the \\"beach\\" part of the names is not universally agreed. One theory invokes the Anglo Saxon word bec meaning \\"stream\\", but a more plausible one gives the meaning as \\"shore\\", much like the modern \\"beach\\", as both Waterbeach and Landbeach were at the edge of The Fens, then an area of marshland. Population reached a peak of 526 in 1851 but fell to 389 in 1911. It passed 600 for the first time in the 1950s and 800 in the 1990s. The village has three archaeological sites with remains of mediaeval manor houses, which together form a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Church Church of All Saints The parish church of All Saints comprises a chancel with north chapel, a nave with south porch, and a three-stage west tower with a slim octagonal spire. The majority of the present building was constructed in the 14th century, though there are some remains of the 13th-century building at the base of the tower and chancel. The church retains much of its medieval woodwork. The spire was rebuilt in 1972. Tithe barn Landbeach Tithe Barn Landbeach Tithe Barn was constructed in the sixteenth century, or possibly earlier, for the collection and storage of tithes paid by the villagers to the church. It is thatched, timber framed and weatherboarded, and is a grade II listed building. In 2016 the tithe barn was taken over by a charitable trust, which in 2019‚Äì20 renovated and rethatched the building. The tithe barn is used for village events. Village life Landbeach has two churches (Anglican and Baptist), a village hall and an Indian restaurant (formerly The Slap Up public house). The nearest railway station is Waterbeach, on the Fen Line. The village lies close to the A10 road that links Cambridge to King's Lynn. There were up to seven public houses in the village in the 19th century, of which none remain. These included The Black Bull which opened in the mid-18th century. The Black Bull, The Bower and The British Queen are now private houses and The Red Cow remains only in that a part of its tiled floor can be seen in the garden of one of the houses in the High Street. There is no remaining trace of The Windmill, The Coach and Horses, The Queen Adelaide or The Bricklayers Arms. By the 1960s only The Slap-Up, which opened in around 1860 on the Cambridge to Ely turnpike (now the A10) remained, but this is now a restaurant.Landbeach - A Pocket History Within the parish boundary, but outside the residential area, is Cambridge Research Park, on the site of the former Landbeach Marina, itself a flooded former gravel pit.

He is known as the third of Elizabeth Taylor's seven husbands, and is the only one whom she did not divorce (he died in a private plane accident a year after their marriage). He was the driving force behind the development of the eponymous Todd-AO widescreen film format. Early life Todd was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Chaim Goldbogen (an Orthodox rabbi), and Sophia Hellerman, both of whom were Polish Jewish immigrants. He was one of nine children in a poor family, the youngest son, and his siblings nicknamed him \\"Tod\\" (pronounced \\"Toat\\" in German) to mimic his difficulty pronouncing the word \\"coat.\\" It was from this that his name was derived.Cohn, Art. (1959) The Nine Lives of Michael Todd. Hutchinson of London. p. 24 The family later moved to Chicago, arriving on the day World War I ended. Todd was expelled in the sixth grade for running a game of craps inside the school. In high school, he produced the school play, The Mikado, which was considered a hit. (As Mike Todd, he would produce a jazz version of the musical on Broadway in 1939.) He eventually dropped out of high school, and worked at a variety of jobs, including shoe salesman and store window decorator. One of his first jobs was as a soda jerk. When the drugstore went out of business, Todd had acquired enough medical knowledge from his work there to be hired at Chicago's Michael Reese Hospital as a type of \\"security guard\\" to stop visitors from bringing in food that was not on the patient's diet. Career=Construction Todd began his career in the construction business, where he made, and subsequently lost, a fortune. He opened the College of Bricklaying of America, buying the materials to teach bricklaying on credit. The school was forced to close when the Bricklayers' Union did not view the college as an accepted place of study. Todd and his brother, Frank, next opened their own construction company. His first flirtation with the film industry was when he served as a contractor to Hollywood studios, soundproofing production stages during the transition from silent pictures to sound. The company he owned with his brother went bankrupt when its financial backing failed in the early days of the Great Depression. Not yet 21, Todd had lost over $1 million (equivalent to about $ in today's funds). Todd married the former Bertha Freshman on February 14, 1927, and was the father of an infant son with no home for his family. Todd's subsequent business career was volatile, and failed ventures left him bankrupt many times. Theatrical impresario Lake View neighborhood in the 1940s that provided dinner with live presentations and music. During the 1933‚Äì1934 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago, Todd produced an attraction called the \\"Flame Dance\\". In this number, gas jets were designed to burn part of a dancer's costume, leaving her naked in appearance. The act attracted enough attention to bring an offer from the Casino de Paree nightclub in New York City. Todd got his first taste of Broadway with the engagement and was determined to find a way to work there. After seeing the Federal Theatre Project's Chicago run of The Swing Mikado, an adaptation of the Gilbert and Sullivan opera The Mikado with an all African-American cast conceived by Harry Minturn, Todd decided to do his own version on Broadway, The Hot Mikado, despite protests by the FTP. The Hot Mikado, starring Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson, opened on Broadway March 23, 1939. The subsequent success of Todd's production, at the expense of the Chicago production, contributed to the financial crisis and ultimate demise of the Federal Theatre Project unit in Chicago. Todd's Broadway success gave him the nerve to challenge showman Billy Rose. Todd visited Grover Whalen, president of the 1939 New York World's Fair, with a proposal to bring the Broadway show to the Fair. Whalen, eager to have the show at the fair, covered Todd's Broadway early closing costs. Rose, who had an exclusivity clause in his fair contract, met Todd at Lindy's, where Rose learned his contract covered new forms of entertainment only. To avoid any head-to-head competition, Rose quickly agreed to promote Todd's production along with his own. First act finale from A Night in Venice The production was replete with a cast of 500 and fireworks. Todd ultimately produced 17 Broadway shows during his career, including the immensely successful burlesque revue Star and Garter starring comedian Bobby Clark, The Naked Genius written by and starring stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, and a 1945 production of Hamlet starring Maurice Evans. His greatest successes were in musical comedy revues, typically featuring actresses in deshabill√©, such as As the Girls Go (which also starred Clark) and Michael Todd's Peepshow. Todd floated the idea of holding the 1945 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in newly liberated Berlin. Although baseball's new commissioner Happy Chandler was reportedly \\"intrigued\\" by the idea, it was ultimately dismissed as impractical. The game was finally cancelled due to wartime travel restrictions. In 1952, Todd made a production of the Johann Strauss II operetta A Night in Venice, complete with floating gondolas at the then-newly constructed Jones Beach Theatre in Long Island, New York. It ran for two seasons. Widescreen cinema and film productions CBS paid Mike Todd for the rights to cover the first anniversary celebration at Madison Square Garden for Around the World in 80 Days as a television special in 1957. Todd and his wife Elizabeth Taylor are seen here at home in a film clip which was used for the special. In 1950, Mike Todd formed Cinerama with the broadcaster Lowell Thomas (who founded Capital Cities Communications) and the inventor Fred Waller. The company was created to exploit Cinerama, a widescreen film process created by Waller that used three film projectors to create a giant composite image on a curved screen. The first Cinerama feature, This is Cinerama, was released in September 1952. Before its release, Todd left the Cinerama Company to develop a widescreen process which would eliminate some of Cinerama's flaws. The result was the Todd-AO process, designed by the American Optical Company.part one of 5 The process was first used commercially for the successful film adaptation of Oklahoma! (1955). (Ironically, the producer had famously dismissed the stage musical during tryouts a decade earlier, quipping ‚ÄúNo jokes, no legs, no chance.‚Äù) Todd soon produced the film for which he is best remembered, Michael Todd's Around the World in 80 Days, which debuted in cinemas on October 17, 1956. Costing $6 million to produce (equivalent to approximately $), the movie earned $16 million at the box office. In 1957, Around the World in 80 Days won the Best Picture Academy Award. In the 1950s Todd acquired the Harris and Selwyn Theaters in downtown Chicago. The Selwyn was renamed Michael Todd's Cinestage and converted into a showcase for Todd-AO productions, while the Harris was renamed the Michael Todd Theatre and operated as a conventional cinema. The facades of both theaters survive as part of the Goodman Theatre complex, although the interiors have been demolished. A William Woolfolk novel from the early 1960s, entitled My Name Is Morgan, was considered to be loosely based on Todd's life and career. Personal life Todd with Elizabeth Taylor in BelgradeTodd with daughter Liza and wife Elizabeth Taylor, 1957 At age 17, Todd married Bertha Freshman in Crown Point, Indiana, on Valentine's Day 1927. He had been interested in Freshman since age 14, but needed to develop confidence before even asking her out.Cohn (1959) p. 24 In 1929, the couple's son, Mike Todd, Jr., was born. The death of his father in 1931 was a turning point for Todd; he decided to change his name to Mike Todd on the day of his father's death. Todd's wife, Bertha, died of a pneumothorax (collapsed lung) on August 12, 1946, in Santa Monica, California, while undergoing surgery at St. John's Hospital for a damaged tendon in her finger. Todd and his wife were separated at the time of her death; less than a week before Freshman's death, he had filed for divorce. On July 5, 1947, Todd married actress Joan Blondell. They divorced on June 8, 1950, after Blondell filed for divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty. Todd's third marriage was to the actress Elizabeth Taylor, with whom he had a tempestuous relationship. The couple exchanged vows on February 2, 1957, in Mexico, in a ceremony performed by the mayor of Acapulco. It was the third marriage for both the 24-year-old bride and her 47-year-old groom. Mario Moreno, better known as Cantinflas, was their witness. Todd and Taylor had a daughter, Elizabeth Frances (Liza) Todd, born on August 6, 1957. Death On March 22, 1958, Todd's private plane the Liz crashed near Grants, New Mexico. The plane, a twin-engine Lockheed Lodestar, suffered engine failure, while being flown overloaded in icy conditions at an altitude that was too high for only one engine working under the heavy load. The plane went out of control and crashed, killing all four on board. (a text version is also available) (if links above fail to load report, visit http://dotlibrary.specialcollection.net and select \\"Historical Aircraft Accident Reports (1934‚Äì1965)\\", then retry report links) Five days before the crash, Todd flew on this plane to Albuquerque, east of the crash site, to promote a screening of Michael Todd's Around the World in 80 Days. This ad for Trans World Airlines appeared in Playbill on February 10, 1958, about six weeks prior to Todd's fatal plane crash. In addition to Todd, those who died in the crash were screenwriter and author Art Cohn, who was writing Todd's biography The Nine Lives of Michael Todd, pilot Bill Verner, and co-pilot Tom Barclay, a replacement for the plane's regular co-pilot. Verner was a veteran military pilot who had flown heavily loaded Curtiss C-46 Commando cargo planes over The Hump between India and China. Todd paid for the installation of two extra fuel tanks in his leased Lodestar aircraft; this made the aircraft weigh more than its official rating when all the tanks were full, without the flight crew, passengers or luggage aboard. Verner had flown the plane overloaded like this before without incident, including piloting Todd on trips over the Atlantic and around Europe. The tanks had been filled to capacity prior to the fatal flight. Todd was on his way to New York to accept the New York Friars Club \\"Showman of the Year\\" award. Taylor wanted to travel with her husband, but stayed home with a cold after Todd overruled her pleas to join the trip. Just hours before the crash, Todd described the plane as safe as he phoned friends, including Joseph Mankiewicz and Kirk Douglas, in an attempt to recruit a gin rummy player for the flight: \\"Ah, c'mon,\\" he said. \\"It's a good, safe plane. I wouldn't let it crash. I'm taking along a picture of Elizabeth, and I wouldn't let anything happen to her.\\" His son, Mike Jr., wanted his father's body to be cremated after it was identified through dental records and brought to Albuquerque, New Mexico, but Taylor refused, saying he would not want cremation. Todd's mother, aged 91 and a sanitarium patient at the time of her son's death, was not told of the accident as it was felt that the shock would be detrimental to her fragile health. Todd was buried in Forest Park, Illinois, at Beth Aaron Cemetery in plot 66, which is part of Jewish Waldheim Cemetery. In his autobiography, Eddie Fisher, who considered himself to be Todd's best friend, stated: With Frank Sinatra, 1956 > There was a closed coffin, but I knew it was more for show than anything > else. The plane had exploded on impact, and whatever remains were found > couldn't be identified... The only items recovered from the wreckage were > Mike's wedding ring and a pair of platinum cuff links I'd given him. In June 1977, Todd's remains were desecrated by graverobbers. The thieves broke into his casket looking for a $100,000 diamond ring, which, according to rumor, Taylor had placed on her husband's finger prior to his burial. The bag containing Todd's remains was found under a tree near his burial plot. The bag and casket had been sealed in Albuquerque after Todd's remains were identified following the 1958 crash. Todd's remains were once more identified through dental records and were reburied in a secret location.

The home of the Boise Hawks of the short season Class A Northwest League, it has a current seating capacity of 3,452 on land owned by Ada County, adjacent to the Western Idaho Fairgrounds on the banks of the Boise River. The stadium opened in 1989, with several significant improvements over time. It was privately built by an investor group led by Bill Pereira and General Manager, Fred Kuenzi. The natural grass playing field at Memorial Stadium is aligned northeast, at an approximate elevation of above sea level. Hawks' history After moving from the Tri- Cities after the 1986 season, the renamed Boise Hawks continued as an independent in the Northwest League and played their first two seasons at Bill Wigle Field on the campus of Borah High School. They moved to Memorial Stadium in 1989 and became an affiliate of the California Angels organization in 1990. The Hawks' relationship with the Angels lasted for 11 years before a change to the Chicago Cubs in 2001. The Hawks made another affiliation change to the Colorado Rockies in 2015. Since their arrival in 1987, the Hawks have won four league titles (1991, 1993‚Äì1995) and during the tenure of manager Tom Kotchman, the Hawks won 835 games. In 2002, Steve McFarland became manager of the Hawks and since then, the Hawks have won two league championships and three divisional titles. Previous teams Starting in 1939, Boise was a longtime member of the Pioneer League. The teams were originally known as the Pilots, and later as the Yankees (1952‚Äì53) and Braves (1955‚Äì63). They played at Airway Park, about a half-mile (0.8 km) east of Albertsons Stadium, in Municipal Park (now Kristin Armstrong M.P.) in east Boise, now the site of the headquarters of the state's fish & game department. (photo - 1950s) The present-day campus of Boise State University was the site of the original Boise airport, Varney Field, until 1940. In its final years, the ballpark was known as \\"Braves Field.\\" The last season of the Pioneer League in Boise was 1963 and the city went eleven summers without minor league baseball. Boise's original team in the Northwest League was the Boise A's of 1975 and 1976. Fresh from Oakland Technical High School, future hall of famer Rickey Henderson was a member of the 1976 team as a 17-year-old. The independent Buckskins debuted in 1978, but after a season, the team folded. Both teams played their home games at Bill Wigle Field, then known as \\"Borah Field.\\" Boise went without minor league baseball for eight summers until the Hawks arrived in 1987.

While an art student under George Grosz at Columbia University, she and Barnard student and friend Joan Vollmer shared an apartment on 118th Street in New York City which came to be frequented by many of the then unknown Beats, among them Vollmer's eventual husband William S. Burroughs, and fellow Columbia students Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg as well as Lucien Carr. Born in Detroit, Parker was raised in Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan. Edie and Jack were married on August 22, 1944 at Manhattan Municipal Building in downtown New York. At the time, Jack was in jail as an accessory after the fact in Lucien Carr's murder of David Kammerer. This event expedited their intention to marry as Jack's father, Leo, refused to bail him out of jail. Jack was released from jail long enough for him and Edie to be escorted downtown by two N.Y.P.D detectives to be married. Once married, Edie could access an inheritance from her grandfather's then-unprobated estate to post Kerouac's bail. The marriage was annulled in 1948.

It is the only known member of the genus Eurypharynx and the family Eurypharyngidae. It belongs to the \\"saccopharyngiforms\\", members of which were historically placed in their own order, but are now considered true eels in the order Anguilliformes. The pelican eel has been described by many synonyms, yet nobody has been able to demonstrate that more than one species of pelican eel exists. It is also referred to as the gulper eel (which can also refer to members of the related genus Saccopharynx), pelican gulper, and umbrella-mouth gulper. The specific epithet pelecanoides refers to the pelican, as the fish's large mouth is reminiscent of that of the pelican. Description Pelican eel specimens can be hard to describe, as they are so fragile that they become damaged when recovered from the immense pressure of the deep sea. The pelican eel's most notable feature is its large mouth, which is much larger than its body. The mouth is loosely hinged, and can be opened wide enough to swallow a fish much larger than the eel itself. The pouch-like lower jaw resembles that of a pelican, hence its name. The lower jaw is hinged at the base of the head, with no body mass behind it, making the head look disproportionately large. Its jaw is so large that it is estimated to be about a quarter of the total length of the eel itself. When it feeds on prey, water that is ingested is expelled via the gills.Gulper Eel ‚Äì Pelican Eel, Frightening Deep Sea Jaws  Animal Pictures and Facts. FactZoo.com. Retrieved 2016-11-14. The pelican eel is very different in appearance from typical eels. It lacks pelvic fins, swim bladders, and scales. Its muscle segments have a \\"V-shape\\", while other fish have \\"W-shaped\\" muscle segments. The pelican eel has an aglomerular kidney that is thought to have a role in maintaining the gelatinous substance filling the \\"lymphatic spaces\\" that are found around the vertebrae. It has been hypothesized that these gelatinous substance filled \\"lymphatic spaces\\" could function in a similar way to a swim bladder. Unlike many other deep sea creatures, it has very small eyes. It is believed that the eyes evolved to detect faint traces of light rather than form images. The pelican eel also has a very long, whip-like tail. Specimens that have been brought to the surface in fishing nets have been known to have their long tails tied into several knots. The pelican eel uses a whip-like tail for movement. The end of the tail bears a complex organ with numerous tentacles, which glows pink and gives off occasional bright-red flashes. The colors on its tail are displayed through its light-emitting photophores. This is presumably a lure to attract prey, although its presence at the far end of the body from the mouth suggests the eel may have to adopt an unusual posture to use it effectively. Pelican eels are also unusual that the ampullae of the lateral line system projects from the body, rather than being contained in a narrow groove; this may increase its sensitivity. The pelican eel grows to about in length, though lengths of 1m are plausible.Bray, Dianne J. (2011), . Fishes of Australia, accessed 7 October 2014 Another interesting fact is that the pelican eel does not appear to display sexual dimorphism. Pelican eels are black or olive and some subspecies may have a thin lateral white stripe. Diet The stomach can stretch and expand to accommodate large meals, although analysis of stomach contents suggests they primarily eat small crustaceans. Despite the great size of the jaws, which occupy about a quarter of the animal's total length, it has only tiny teeth, which would not be consistent with a regular diet of large fish. The large mouth may be an adaptation to allow the eel to eat a wider variety of prey when food is scarce. It can also be used like a large net. The eel can swim into large groups of shrimp or other crustaceans with its mouth closed, opening wide as it closely approaches prey, scooping them up to be swallowed. The pelican eel is also known to feed on cephalopods (squid) and other small invertebrates. When the eel gulps its prey into its massive jaws, it also takes in a large amount of water, which is then slowly expelled through its gill slits. Pelican eels themselves are preyed upon by lancetfish and other deep sea predators. Recent studies have shown that pelican eels are active participants in their pursuit of food, rather than passively waiting for prey to fall into their large mouths. The pelican eel is not known to undergo vertical diurnal migration like other eels. Reproduction and life cycle Not much is known about the reproductive habits of the pelican eel. Similar to other eels, when pelican eels are first born, they start in the leptocephalus stage, meaning that they are extremely thin and transparent. Until they reach their juvenile stage, they interestingly have very small body organs and do not contain any red blood cells. As they mature, the males undergo a change that causes enlargement of the olfactory organs, responsible for the sense of smell, and degeneration of the teeth and jaws. The females, on the other hand, remain relatively unchanged as they mature. The large olfactory organs in the males indicates that they may locate their mates through pheromones released by the females. Many researchers believe that the eels die shortly after reproduction.Gulper Eel ‚Äì Deep Sea Creatures on Sea and Sky. Seasky.org. Retrieved 2016-11-14. Distribution and habitat The pelican eel has been found in the temperate and tropical areas of all oceans. In the North Atlantic, it seems to have a range in depth from . One Canadian- arctic specimen was found in Davis Strait at a depth of 1,136-1,154 meters, and also across the coasts of Greenland. More recently, pelican eels have been spotted off the coast of Portugal, as well as near Hawaiian islands. Interactions with humans Because of the extreme depths at which it lives, most of what is known about the pelican eel comes from specimens that are inadvertently caught in deep sea fishing nets. Although once regarded as a purely deep-sea species, since 1970, hundreds of specimens have been caught by fishermen, mostly in the Atlantic Ocean. In October 2018, the first direct observation of a gulper eel was made by a group of researchers about 1500 kilometers off the coast of Portugal near the islands called the Azores. The team witnessed the aggressive nature of the eel's hunting process, as it was constantly moving around in the water column to attempt to find prey. In September 2018, the E/V Nautilus team also witnessed a juvenile gulper eel inflating its mouth in attempt to catch prey in the PapahƒÅnaumokuƒÅkea Marine National Monument (PMNM). Until these recent explorations, not much has been analyzed by researchers of the behavior of gulper eels.  Phylogenetic relationship to other species  In 2003, researchers from the University of Tokyo sequenced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from specimens of Eurypharynx pelicanoides and Saccopharynx lavenbergi. After comparing the sequences from the specimens with other known sequences, they found that Eurypharynx pelicanoides and Saccopharynx lavenbergi were closely related and genetically distinct from anguilliformes.

It is named after Charles Stein of Stanford University, who discovered the phenomenon in 1955. An intuitive explanation is that optimizing for the mean-squared error of a combined estimator is not the same as optimizing for the errors of separate estimators of the individual parameters. In practical terms, if the combined error is in fact of interest, then a combined estimator should be used, even if the underlying parameters are independent. If one is instead interested in estimating an individual parameter, then using a combined estimator does not help and is in fact worse.  Formal statement  The following is perhaps the simplest form of the paradox, the special case in which the number of observations is equal to the number of parameters to be estimated. Let Œ∏ be a vector consisting of n ‚â• 3 unknown parameters. To estimate these parameters, a single measurement Xi is performed for each parameter Œ∏i, resulting in a vector X of length n. Suppose the measurements are known to be independent, Gaussian random variables, with mean Œ∏ and variance 1, i.e., :{\\\\mathbf X} \\\\sim N({\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta}, 1). Thus, each parameter is estimated using a single noisy measurement, and each measurement is equally inaccurate. Under these conditions, it is intuitive and common to use each measurement as an estimate of its corresponding parameter. This so-called \\"ordinary\\" decision rule can be written as :\\\\hat {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta} = {\\\\mathbf X}. The quality of such an estimator is measured by its risk function. A commonly used risk function is the mean squared error, defined as :\\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left[ \\\\left\\\\ {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta} - \\\\hat {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta} \\\\right\\\\^2 \\\\right]. Surprisingly, it turns out that the \\"ordinary\\" estimator proposed above is suboptimal in terms of mean squared error when n ‚â• 3\\\\. In other words, in the setting discussed here, there exist alternative estimators which always achieve lower mean squared error, no matter what the value of {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta} is. For a given Œ∏ one could obviously define a perfect \\"estimator\\" which is always just Œ∏, but this estimator would be bad for other values of Œ∏. The estimators of Stein's paradox are, for a given Œ∏, better than X for some values of X but necessarily worse for others (except perhaps for one particular Œ∏ vector, for which the new estimate is always better than X). It is only on average that they are better. More accurately, an estimator \\\\hat {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta}_1 is said to dominate another estimator \\\\hat {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta}_2 if, for all values of {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta}, the risk of \\\\hat {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta}_1 is lower than, or equal to, the risk of \\\\hat {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta}_2, and if the inequality is strict for some {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta}. An estimator is said to be admissible if no other estimator dominates it, otherwise it is inadmissible. Thus, Stein's example can be simply stated as follows: The ordinary decision rule for estimating the mean of a multivariate Gaussian distribution is inadmissible under mean squared error risk. Many simple, practical estimators achieve better performance than the ordinary estimator. The best-known example is the James‚ÄìStein estimator, which works by starting at X and moving towards a particular point (such as the origin) by an amount inversely proportional to the distance of X from that point. For a sketch of the proof of this result, see Proof of Stein's example. An alternative proof is due to Larry Brown: he proved that the ordinary estimator for a n-dimensional multivariate normal mean vector is admissible if and only if the n-dimensional Brownian motion is recurrent. Since the Brownian motion is not recurrent for n ‚â• 3, the ordinary estimator is not admissible for n ‚â• 3\\\\.  Implications  Stein's example is surprising, since the \\"ordinary\\" decision rule is intuitive and commonly used. In fact, numerous methods for estimator construction, including maximum likelihood estimation, best linear unbiased estimation, least squares estimation and optimal equivariant estimation, all result in the \\"ordinary\\" estimator. Yet, as discussed above, this estimator is suboptimal. To demonstrate the unintuitive nature of Stein's example, consider the following real-world example. Suppose we are to estimate three unrelated parameters, such as the US wheat yield for 1993, the number of spectators at the Wimbledon tennis tournament in 2001, and the weight of a randomly chosen candy bar from the supermarket. Suppose we have independent Gaussian measurements of each of these quantities. Stein's example now tells us that we can get a better estimate (on average) for the vector of three parameters by simultaneously using the three unrelated measurements. At first sight it appears that somehow we get a better estimator for US wheat yield by measuring some other unrelated statistics such as the number of spectators at Wimbledon and the weight of a candy bar. This is of course absurd; we have not obtained a better estimator for US wheat yield by itself, but we have produced an estimator for the vector of the means of all three random variables, which has a reduced total risk. This occurs because the cost of a bad estimate in one component of the vector is compensated by a better estimate in another component. Also, a specific set of the three estimated mean values obtained with the new estimator will not necessarily be better than the ordinary set (the measured values). It is only on average that the new estimator is better.  An intuitive explanation  For any particular value of Œ∏ the new estimator will improve at least one of the individual mean square errors \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left[ \\\\left( {\\\\theta_i} - {\\\\hat \\\\theta_i} \\\\right)^2 \\\\right]. This is not hard ‚àí for instance, if \\\\theta_1 is between ‚àí1 and 1, and œÉ = 1, then an estimator that moves X_1 towards 0 by 0.5 (or sets it to zero if its absolute value was less than 0.5) will have a lower mean square error than X_1 itself. But there are other values of \\\\theta_1 for which this estimator is worse than X_1 itself. The trick of the Stein estimator, and others that yield the Stein paradox, is that they adjust the shift in such a way that there is always (for any Œ∏ vector) at least one X_i whose mean square error is improved, and its improvement more than compensates for any degradation in mean square error that might occur for another \\\\hat \\\\theta_i. The trouble is that, without knowing Œ∏, you don't know which of the n mean square errors are improved, so you can't use the Stein estimator only for those parameters. An example of the above setting occurs in channel estimation in telecommunications, for instance, because different factors affect overall channel performance.

Life F√©lix de Azara was born on May 18, 1746, in Barbunales, Aragon.F√©lix de Azara, Viajes por la am√©rica meridional (Buenos Aires: El Elefante Blanco, 1998), 1:11. He joined the army and attended a Spanish military academy. He was commissioned as an engineer, distinguishing himself on various expeditions. He spent the next thirteen years of his life in the military and rose to the rank of Brigadier General in the Spanish Army. In 1777, Spain and Portugal signed the Treaty of San Ildefonso. As dictated by the treaty, each nation would send a delegation to the R√≠o de la Plata region to negotiate the border dispute between the Portuguese and Spanish colonies. Azara was selected as a member of this delegation, departing quickly for the New World.Azara, 1:13 The Portuguese delegation, however, never arrived, and Azara ended up remaining in the region from 1781 to 1801. To pass the time, he decided to create an accurate map of the region.Azara, 1:39. On these expeditions, Azara began observing the nature of the region. Over the course of his time there, he \\"described 448 birds...This number is reduced to 381 when duplications of sex, age, and plumage are taken into account (eight remain unidentified), and 178 of them are the types upon which the scientific names are based.‚ÄùBeddall, Barbara. ‚ÄúIsolated Spanish Genius: Myth or Reality: Felix de Azara and the Birds of Paraguay.‚Äù Journal of the History of Biology 16, no. 2 (1983): 228. He also identified 78 quadrupeds, 43 of which were new.Beddall, ‚ÄúIsolated Spanish Genius,\\" 228. A number of animals were named after him, including Azara's night monkey (Aotus azarae), Azara's agouti (Dasyprocta azarae), Azara's grass mouse (Akodon azarae), Azara's spinetail (Synallaxis azarae), and Azara's tree iguana (Liolaemus azarai ).Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Azara\\", p. 13). Dorsum Azara on the Moon is also named after him. Before leaving South America, he sent his brother Jos√© Nicol√°s de Azara (then Spanish Ambassador at Paris) his zoological notes and observations, which M√©d√©ric Louis √âlie Moreau de Saint- M√©ry published at Paris in 1801 under the title of Essai sur l'histoire naturelle des quadrup√®des du Paraguay. In 1802 there appeared at Madrid the essay Apuntamientos para la Historia natural de los cuadr√∫pedos del Paraguay y R√≠o de la Plata. Upon his return to Europe in 1801, he traveled to Paris to meet his brother. There, he published Voyage dans l'Amerique meridionale depuis 1781 jusqu'en 1801 (1809), which included his observations on many topics ranging from the geography of the region to characteristics of the many indigenous groups in the region. Following the death of his brother, Azara returned to Spain and held a variety of minor government positions.Barbara Beddall, ‚ÄúUna Naturalista Original: Don Felix de Azara, 1746-1821,‚Äù Journal of the History of Biology 8, no. 1 (1975): 23.

His works His works were well received though not without criticism. Azara had largely written his works to correct what he considered to be many errors in Histoire naturelle by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon.Helen Cowie, ‚ÄúA Creole in Paris and a Spaniard in Paraguay: Geographies of Natural History in the Hispanic World (1750-1808),‚Äù Journal of Latin American Geography 10, no. 1 (2011): 180. Intellectuals praised him for his thoroughness and accuracy. Charles Darwin had a high regard for Azara's work (despite the latter not being a professional naturalist), and in several of his books spoke approvingly of Azara's authority. Some, however, thought that his work was too harsh a critique of Buffon.

After the divorce, she established a family with Moshe Albalek in Jerusalem. By 1985, she had two children and little involvement in the music industry. Then she began working as a violinist and violist, appearing with the Israeli Kibbutz Orchestra, and as an actress. 1990s and 2000s She became a successful lyricist, writing for prominent musicians and singers in Israel; \\"Shara Barkhovot\\" (\\"Singing in the Streets\\"), the Israeli entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1990 performed by Rita, featured her words, and some of her songs are considered icons of Israeli music.Tamar Sukenik, \\"They're playing my song\\", Haaretz, May 10, 2007. She also recast existing song lyrics from other languages into Hebrew, such as the Leonard Cohen song \\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\" in 1993. In 1999, she wrote the lyrics for the multi-ethnic collaborative, Glykeria's recording \\"Tfilat Ha'imahot\\" (\\"The Mothers' Prayer\\"), which also featured Amal Murkus and Yehudit Tamir. In 2003, the album No Longer the Sea: A Collection Of Tzruya Lahav's Songs was released, featuring performances by Rita, Yehudit Ravitz, Meir Banai, Yehuda Poliker, and others. Her songs have also been performed by Israeli artists Gidi Gov, Rami Kleinstein, and Ricky Gal. In 2004, a show of her songs was produced in Tel Aviv. Lahav authored screenplays, including the 1996 Israeli crime film Kesher Dam, and two novels: Andre‚Äôs Wooden Clogs (Kinneret, 2002), based on the true-life story of a boy's survival of The Holocaust in the Netherlands (in Hebrew, also translated to Dutch, Italian ), and The Swamp Queen Does The Tango (Am Oved, 2004), an adult fairy tale (in Hebrew).

The tumors cause fibrosis of tissues and impede digestion or organ function, and if left untreated, the tumors and mucin they produce will fill the abdominal cavity. This will result in compression of organs and will destroy the function of the colon, small intestine, stomach, or other organs. Prognosis with treatment in many cases is optimistic, but the disease is lethal if untreated, with death occurring via cachexia, bowel obstruction, or other types of complications. This disease is most commonly caused by an appendiceal primary cancer (cancer of the appendix); mucinous tumors of the ovary have also been implicated, although in most cases ovarian involvement is favored to be a metastasis from an appendiceal or other gastrointestinal source. Disease is typically classified as low- or high-grade (with signet ring cells). When disease presents with low-grade histologic features the cancer rarely spreads through the lymphatic system or through the bloodstream.  Signs and symptoms  Signs and symptoms of pseudomyxoma peritonei may include abdominal or pelvic pain and/or bloating, distension, digestive disorders, weight changes, increased girth, and infertility.{{citation needed Cause The primary tumor appears to arise from the MUC2 expressing goblet cells and most commonly from these cells in the appendix. The K-Ras and p53 genes may be involved in the oncogenesis. It may be diagnosed with a range of conditions. While the majority of these cases are associated with appendiceal carcinomas, other conditions may also be found, including disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis (DPAM), peritoneal carcinomas, several mucinous tumors (mucinous adenocarcinoma, mucinous cystadenoma, and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma), as well as other disease states. Other primary sites that have been reported include colon, rectum, stomach, gallbladder, bile ducts, small intestine, urinary bladder, lung, breast, fallopian tubes, and the pancreas. Diagnosis This disease is often discovered during surgery for other conditions, e.g., hernia repair, following which an experienced pathologist can confirm the diagnosis. Advanced stages may present as tumors palpable on the abdomen or distention of the belly (\\"jelly belly\\" is sometimes used as a slang term for the condition). Due to the rarity of this disease, it is important to obtain an accurate diagnosis so that appropriate treatment may be obtained from a surgical oncologist who specializes in appendix cancer. Diagnostic tests may include CT scans, examination of tissue samples obtained through laparoscopy, and the evaluation of tumor markers. In most cases a colonoscopy is unsuitable as a diagnostic tool because in most cases appendix cancer invades the abdominal cavity but not the colon (however, spread inside the colon is occasionally reported). PET scans may be used to evaluate high- grade mucinous adenocarcinoma, but this test is not reliable for detecting low-grade tumors because those do not take up the dye which shows up on scans. New MRI procedures are being developed for disease monitoring, but standard MRIs are not typically used as a diagnostic tool. Diagnosis is confirmed through pathology. Classification There is substantial debate regarding histopathologic classification of pseudomyxoma peritonei. In 1995, Ronnett et al. proposed separating pseudomyxoma peritonei cases into two diagnostic categories: adenoma (disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis, DPAM) or carcinoma (peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis, PMCA) with a third category reserved for cases with intermediate features. In this classification system, cases of DPAM were characterized by peritoneal lesions composed of abundant extracellular mucin containing scant simple to focally proliferative mucinous epithelium with little cytologic atypia or mitotic activity (in other words, most cells looked fairly normal and there was no evidence of mitosis which would indicate that cells were rapidly dividing), with or without an associated appendiceal mucinous adenoma. Cases of PMCA were characterized by peritoneal lesions composed of more abundant mucinous epithelium with the architectural and cytologic features of carcinoma (irregular cells, evidence that cells were rapidly dividing, and other criteria), with or without an associated primary mucinous adenocarcinoma. Bradley et al. (2007) argued that continued use of non-malignant terms, i.e., adenoma, for those frequent cases with low-grade features (such as DPAM), is misleading because pseudomyxoma peritonei is a disease state that results from invasion of the abdominal cavity by cells with uncontrolled growth. Bradley states that an adenoma, by definition, is a tumor confined to the appendiceal mucosa with absolutely no evidence of invasion beyond the muscularis mucosae. The term mucinous adenocarcinoma is used in different contexts depending on the reference material used by the pathologist for disease classification. For example, neoplasms characterized by high-grade features, invasive glands and or signet ring cells, are termed adenocarcinoma in pathology literature.e.g., http://surgpathcriteria.stanford.edu/gitumors/appendix-adenocarcinoma/ However, some pathologists (e.g., Odze and Goldblum, Surgical Pathology of the GI Tract, Liver, Biliary Tract and Pancreas, 2nd ed.) also use the term mucinous adenocarcinoma when referring to low-grade, well-differentiated tumors lacking high-grade features. Low-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma is used by the American Joint Committee on Cancer and World Health Organization and is nearly or completely synonymous with the DPAM designation. For low-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma, disease may be designated as \\"benign\\" because tumors do not invade deeply into tissue and rarely metastasize to parenchyma of organs; this designation may be misleading and confusing to the layperson because pseudomyxoma peritonei is not a harmless condition, fatal if untreated. High-grade or poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma has a generally poorer prognosis, though surgical treatment with heated intra- peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is yielding promising outcomes (see surgical treatment). Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemical features: #Diffuse expression of SATB2, CK20, CDX2, and mCEA #Sometimes patchy CK7; negative PAX8 #High-grade neoplasms may show loss of DPC4 (10%)  Treatment  Treatment is variable, both due to its rarity and to its frequently slow-growing nature. Treatment ranges from watchful waiting to debulking and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC, also called intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy, IPHC) with cytoreductive surgery. Surgical The standard of care for mucinous adenocarcinoma with clinical condition PMP involves cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), performed by surgical oncologists who specialize in treating PMP. Some surgeons also apply early post-operative intraperitonial chemotherapy (EPIC), adjunct to surgical cytoreduction and HIPEC. In situations where surgery is not required immediately, patients can be monitored via CT scans, tumor marker laboratory tests, and physical symptoms, to determine when, and if, surgery is warranted. Although some surgical procedures may be rather extensive, patients can and do recover from surgery, and the majority of these patients can and do live productive lives. In debulking, the surgeon attempts to remove as much tumor as possible. CRS or cytoreductive surgery involves surgical removal of the peritoneum and any adjacent organs which appear to have tumor seeding. Since the mucus tends to pool at the bottom of the abdominal cavity, it is common to remove the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and parts of the large intestine. Depending upon the spread of the tumor, other organs might be removed, including but not limited to the gallbladder, spleen, and portions of the small intestine and/or stomach. For organs that cannot be removed safely (like the liver), the surgeon strips off the tumor from the surface. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy (typically utilising the chemotherapeutic agent Mitomycin C) may be infused directly into the abdominal cavity after cytoreductive surgery (curgery removing all visible disease to kill remaining microscopic cancerous tumors and free floating cells. The heated chemotherapy (HIPEC) is perfused throughout the abdominal cavity for an hour or two as the last step in the surgery, or ports are installed to allow circulation and/or drainage of the chemicals for one to five days after surgery, known as early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC). EPIC may be given in multiple cycles for several months after surgery. Systemic chemotherapy may be administered as additional or adjuvant treatment. Due to the increased availability of new chemotherapies developed for colorectal cancer patients, some patients have experienced stability in tumor growth with systemic chemotherapy. Systemic chemotherapy is generally reserved for patients with advanced disease, recurrent disease, or disease that has spread to the lymph nodes or distant sites. This disease may recur following surgery and chemotherapy. Periodic post operative CT scans and tumor marker laboratory tests are used to monitor patients for disease progression. Epidemiology The overall incidence was previously estimated at 0.5 to 1 cases per 100,000 people per year. Recent resarch in Europe indicates that the previous estimate of 1-2 persons per million may be underestimating the actual rate by approximately half, with the real incidence being approximately 3.2 persons per million, and the prevalence being 22 persons per million. It is slightly more common in women than men (male:female ratio of approximately 1:1.3,), although the actual ratio is difficult to identify due to potential misdiagnoses and possibly inclusion bias in reported studies. The median age at presentation is typically about 50 years with a range of 20‚Äì25 years, but PMP may strike persons of any age,.  History The first case was described by Carl F. Rokitansky in 1842. Werth in 1884 coined the term pseudomyxoma peritonei, describing it in association with a mucinous ovarian tumor. In 1901 Frankel described the first case associated with a cyst of the appendix.

On March 13, 1662, a second purchase was made from Kilcocanen, another Yeopim. By 1662 Durant was living in Virginia on property adjacent to the Albemarle Sound, which became part of the Carolina colony in 1665. His plantation, called \\"Wicocombe\\" (subsequently known as \\"Durant's Neck\\"), was located in Perquimans County, North Carolina. The exact location of his home is unknown, but the present town of Durant, on the peninsula between the Perquimans River and the Little River, lies on the neck of land five miles east of Edenton, that was sold to George Durant by the two Indian leaders. A mariner turned planter, Durant was one of the ablest and most influential men in the county and a leader of the 1677 Culpeper's Rebellion,Harcourt Social studies, North Carolina Geography, History, and Culture, 2009, page 57 an uprising over the requirement that all colonial goods be transported in British ships. Durant's open opposition to Seth Sothel, one of the Lords Proprietor, led to his arrest and imprisonment. But when Sothel confiscated of Durant's property, residents of the Albemarle region rose in defense of Durant and banished Sothel from the area. The Durant family Bible, printed in 1599 and brought by Durant to the New World, is displayed in a locked cabinet at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Durant died on February 6, 1692, at the age of 59.

Taking place on a set of island archipi√©lagos where the wolf Badler and his legion of mouse-like Chews are threatening to pollute the locations through industries and machinery, players assume the role of the titular main protagonist in an attempt to overthrow Badler and his BB Brigade army with the help of his companions Nash and Kelly. Its gameplay mainly consists of platforming using a main three-button configuration. Punky Skunk was conceived by Ukiyotei founder Kenshi Naruse during his time working at the company, who began creating a mascot action game intended for younger audiences reminiscent of Sony's Skyblazer on the Super Famicom as a commission by Bullet-Proof Software but later settled on doing a new title directed towards western audience with Visit using the same game engine after Bullet-Proof Software changed their direction. The arrival of PlayStation in both eastern and western markets led Ukiyotei with suspending development of the project on Super Famicom before ultimately deciding on making a different version for the former platform, while integrating some of their previously established ideas from the original version into the final release. Upon its release, Punky Skunk was met with a mostly negative reception, with critics panning its visual presentation, audio and gameplay.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Punky Skunk is a side-scrolling action-platform game similar to Skyblazer where the player takes the role of an anthropomorphic skunk named Punky, who settles on saving the world with the aid of his friends Nash and Kelly from the evil BB Brigade army led by Badler as the main objective.Punky Skunk manual (PlayStation, US) Throughout the stages, players may find a set of special tools for Punky via a \\"gear\\" icon, including a skunk spray, a parasail, a pogo stick, inline skates, digging claws and a snowboard. Besides the main stages in the game, minigames are also featured which can benefit Punky in his journey with items like extra lives. Similar to Super Mario Bros. and Sonic the Hedgehog, there are collectible stars scattered on almost every stage and obtaining 100 of them grants Punky with an extra life. Punky loses a live if he sustains a number of hits or falls of the stage and once all lives are lost, the game is over. Progress in the game is saved via the PlayStation's memory card.  Development  Punky Skunk was the creation of Ukiyotei founder Kenshi Naruse, whose previous works at the company included Hook, Skyblazer and Todd McFarlane's Spawn: The Video Game. Kenshi recounted about the game's development process and history in a 2012 online interview. Kenshi stated that the title went through various circumstances before its eventual release to market, initially starring a different main protagonist on a mascot action game titled Metamoru Kid G≈´min for the Super Famicom as a commission by Bullet-Proof Software, who wanted a game intended for younger audiences while Ukiyotei settled on creating a concept reminiscent of Skyblazer but aimed at kids. Despite work on Metamoru Kid G≈´min being nearly complete, development was later halted due to Bullet-Proof Software changing their direction. Ukiyotei started afterwards negotiations with Japanese publisher Visit, who proposed to the team with reusing the same game engine written for Metamoru Kid G≈´min on a new project but the arrival of PlayStation in Japanese markets led Ukiyotei focusing towards the western market of the Super Famicom instead. Kenshi claimed that Punky's design and main method of attack were a product of Visit, who told the team that \\"this incorporated the opinions of North American buyers\\". Although work on the Super Famicom version of Punky Skunk was nearly completed, the launch of the PlayStation in North America and the subsequent decrease in the 16-bit market for Super Famicom titles resulted in suspending its development. Ukiyotei would later propose Visit in resuing Punky and continue development of Punky Skunk on PlayStation, to which the latter agreed at the request of elements such as the visuals matched the system's capabilities. The programming team used Punky as research in order to code previous techniques they were able to perform with Super Famicom on PlayStation such as character animation and parallax scrolling, as software development kits for the latter console were deemed to be not suitable for 2D titles, converting several elements from the former version while finishing level design and other aspects during the process. Punky Skunk was created by most of the same team that previously worked on Skyblazer for the Super Famicom at Ukiyotei. Development was helmed by Kaori and Kenshi Naruse acting as directors, with Kenshi also being its sole game designer. Artists Midori Nasu, Michiyo Komura, Rika Ueno, Sadaki Matsumoto, Tadashi Aoyama and Teruo Nagato were responsible for the character designs and pixel art respectively. Norihiro Tokeshi, Satoshi Kuroda, Tadakatsu Makiuchi, Takeru Yamada and Yasushi Kamiya acted as programmers. Former Capcom composers Harumi and Yasuaki Fujita co-wrote the soundtrack. Visit also collaborated on the project's making as well.  Release  Gameplay screenshot from the unreleased Super Famicom version. Punky Skunk was first showcased to the public in a playable state on Super Famicom under its Japanese title, Cooly Skunk, at the 1995 Famimaga Earth World show, where an actor in a Punky costume appeared. The game was later previewed in gaming magazine such as Famitsu, touting its launch with a 23 February 1996 release date. The original Super Famicom version of Punky Skunk was never released due to dying 16-bit markets and the launch of PlayStation in North America. Prior to its cancellation on Super Famicom, a playable demo was broadcast via Satellaview. In 2019, the demo was discovered on a 8M Memory Pak at the Japanese video game store Super Potato and a ROM image of said demo was later leaked online in January 2020. Punky Skunk was later moved and eventually published on PlayStation by Visit in Japan on 1 November 1996 under the name Cooly Skunk, and later in North America by Jaleco in February 1998. On December 2, 1999, the game was later re-released as budget title exclusively in Japan.  Reception  Punky Skunk was met with mostly negative reviews from critics since its release. Next Generation reviewed the game, rating it one star out of five, and stated that \\"Nuts to this - you might as well hook up your SNES and play Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel\\". Electronic Gaming Monthly criticized the game's marketing for claiming the titular character had attitude, stating Punky was \\"...a Generation X skunk with an attitude!\\". The titular character is ranked eighth on Game Informer‚Äôs list of \\"the top 10 worst character names\\". Ryan Geddes of IGN considered the game and its English title to be equally bad. Screen Rants Evan Hopkins placed its titular character as number 14 in his \\"20 video game mascots that tried to dethrone Mario\\" feature.

This petition was granted, although the island had already been included in the original incorporation in 1714 (Banks, 1911). It is situated about 3 miles (4.8 km) off the southwest corner of the island of Martha's Vineyard. The island was used by the United States Navy as a practice bombing range from 1943 to 1996. In 1998, the Navy transferred the island to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for use as an unstaffed wildlife refuge. Due to safety risks from unexploded ordnance and its value as a wildlife habitat, the island is closed to all public use.  History  FB-111A from the 509th Bombardment Wing dropping Mark 82 practice bombs during a training mission over the island In 1602, during the British ship Concords exploration of Cape Cod, Captain Bartholomew Gosnold named Nomans Land \\"Martha's Vineyard\\" after his eldest daughter, Martha.\\"Concord of Dartmouth\\" (ship arrived at Cape Cod on May 15, 1602), Packrat, 2005, webpage: PackRat-Concord-voyage. However, the name was later transferred to the larger island currently known as Martha's Vineyard, which is located northeast of Nomans Land. The island was probably named \\"Nomans Land\\" after a Martha's Vineyard Wampanoag sachem, Tequenoman, who had jurisdiction over the island when the English came in the early 17th century: named from \\"TequeNoman's Land\\" (figurative phrase). An entail of 1695 mentions that William Nicoll of Islip Grange, Long Island, New York, owned the Island of Normans Land near \\"Martins Vineyard\\" recalling the fact that on December 19, 1685, Governor Dongan, Lord of the Manor of Martha's Vineyard (including Normans Land) had made Nicoll his Steward there.Publications of the Order of Colonial Lords of Manors in America - The Nicoll Family and Islip Grange, by Rosalie Fellows Bailey, 1940 An airfield was constructed by the U.S. Navy on the southern edge of the island between November 1942 and May 1944, and the island was used, beginning in World War II, as Nomans Land Range for 53 years (1943‚Äì1996). In 1952, the island was sold by the Crane family to the Navy. The airfield was abandoned by the Navy sometime between 1945 and 1954, though usage as a bombing range continued until 1996. Photograph of the island Nomans Land, Massachusetts during airplane flyover. The eastern third of the island has been managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service since 1975. Following an effort to clear the island of ordnance in 1997 and 1998, the rest of the island was transferred to the Fish and Wildlife Service for use as a wildlife refuge, primarily for migratory birds. Rune stone A stone covered in runes mentioning the Viking explorer Leif Erikson, believed to be the first European to set foot in North America, was reportedly discovered in 1926 and photographed near the coast the island. While this suggests that Vikings might have travelled as far south as present-day Massachusetts, and that it is the true location of the settlement of Vinland, archaeologists have considered it a hoax. Translations of the runes on the stone contained unusual grammar as well as Roman numerals, which has led to skepticism about its credibility. Undetonated bombs on and around the island have prevented further investigations.

The final episode of the 1990s, it originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 19, 1999. In the episode, mafia boss Fat Tony successfully extorts a large sum of money from Springfield Elementary School, forcing Principal Skinner to close it down. However, a toy company called Kid First Industries, led by Jim Hope, later buys the school and privatizes it. Classes now start focusing on toys and marketing only, and soon a new toy called Funzo that resembles the children's ideas is released by Kid First Industries in time for the Christmas shopping season. Bart and Lisa decide to destroy all Funzos in Springfield but Gary Coleman, Kid First Industries' security guard, tries to intercept them. \\"Grift of the Magi\\", which satirizes the commercialization of Christmas, was written by Tom Martin and directed by Matthew Nastuk. The episode features several guest appearances; Tim Robbins as Jim Hope, Gary Coleman as himself, Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony, and Clarence Clemons as a narrator that tells the viewers at the end of the episode how the story ends. Around 7.76 million American homes tuned in to watch the episode during its original airing. It was first released on DVD in 2003 in a collection of five Christmas-related Simpsons episodes, titled Christmas With the Simpsons. Critics have given \\"Grift of the Magi\\" generally mixed reviews, particularly because of its plot. The episode has been praised for some of its gags and Coleman's appearance. Plot Bart and Milhouse have to remain inside The Simpsons house when an ozone hole moves over Springfield. The two dress up as ladies and jump on the bed, singing \\"Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves\\". When Homer comes in abruptly, Bart falls off of the bed and lands on one of Homer's bowling balls and breaks his coccyx. Dr. Hibbert informs Homer and Marge that Bart will have to use a wheelchair until the bone has healed. When Bart arrives at Springfield Elementary School the following day, he finds that he cannot enter because the school lacks ramps for the disabled. As Principal Skinner considers a ramp for the school, mafia boss Fat Tony emerges and suggests that his construction company would be a good choice of company to build it. Although the new ramp system almost immediately collapses (due to it being made out of bread sticks), Fat Tony informs Skinner that the construction supposedly cost US$200,000 and that the school will still have to pay. In response, Principal Skinner decides to close Springfield Elementary due to lack of funds (having used them to pay off Fat Tony and thus avoid brutal mob reprisals). All pleas for financial help are in vain, including a private school play performed in front of Mr. Burns at his mansion, until Jim Hope, the president of a company named Kid First Industries, buys the school and privatizes it. The school's staff is replaced, and classes now focus on toys and marketing. Lisa soon discovers that the company that bought Springfield Elementary is a toy company, using students for research to make a new popular toy in time for the Christmas shopping season. She is then frightened by the appearance of a robotic figure. When Bart and Lisa are back at home, watching television, they see an advertisement for a toy named Funzo. It has many features suggested by Springfield Elementary students during a brainstorming session at the school. They visit Jim Hope's office to complain, and he apologetically gives them a free Funzo toy. Bart and Lisa later discover that Funzo is programmed to destroy other toys. On Christmas Eve, with Homer's help, the two steal all the Funzo toys from underneath every Christmas tree in Springfield with the intention of burning them in the town's long-running tire fire. However, Gary Coleman, who is a security guard at Kid First Industries, comes to stop them. The two parties argue all night until the next morning when they settle down into civilized discussion about the commercialization of Christmas. Coleman changes his opinion about the toy company and helps the Simpsons destroy the remaining functioning Funzo toys that were not destroyed in the tire fire. Afterwards, Homer invites Coleman to Christmas dinner at the Simpson family's house, where Mr. Burns shows up after deciding to donate money to Springfield Elementary following an epiphany he had that night and Moe joined in after being renounced from committing suicide via visions of what life would have been like without him. Production Tim Robbins guest starred in the episode as Jim Hope. \\"Grift of the Magi\\" was written by Tom Martin and directed by Matthew Nastuk as part of the eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999‚Äì2000). It was the first episode that Martin wrote on his own, having previously co-written the season ten episode \\"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\\" with George Meyer, Brian Scully, and The Simpsons showrunner Mike Scully. Martin got the inspiration for \\"Grift of the Magi\\" after reading a magazine article about how major companies were receiving permission to advertise their products in school students' textbooks. He thought it \\"seemed like a gigantic conflict that could lead to big problems\\", and therefore believed an episode based on it would be a good idea.Martin, Tom (2008). Audio commentary for \\"Grift of the Magi\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. According to DVD Talk reviewer Adam Tyner, the episode is a satire of the commercialization of Christmas. A writer for Newsday has commented that episode skewers \\"the annual craze for that one 'hot' toy.\\" This has also been pointed out by Mike Scully, who said in 2008 that \\"Grift of the Magi\\" was produced around the time when \\"every year there seemed to be a hot toy. Like the Furbies, or whatever ‚Äì some toy that kids just had to have that year.\\"Scully, Mike (2008). Audio commentary for \\"Grift of the Magi\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In response to Scully's comment, Martin added that every year \\"the media would create this gigantic rush at the toy store for various things. This [episode] was coming on the heels of, yeah, the Furby.\\" Guest stars in the episode include Tim Robbins as Jim Hope, Gary Coleman as himself, Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony, and Clarence Clemons as a narrator. Scully thought Robbins \\"did a great job\\" because the Simpsons staff wanted the character of Jim Hope to be \\"fun and upbeat and somebody the kids would love.\\" Clemons narrates a few scenes at the end of the episode, telling the viewers how the story ends. When Coleman agrees to spend Christmas with the Simpsons, Clemons says, for example: \\"And Gary Coleman was as good as his word, and as for old Mr. Burns, he was visited by three ghosts during the night and agreed to fund the school with some money he found in his tuxedo pants.\\" Shortly after Coleman's death in 2010, an article appeared in the newspaper El Comercio that noted that \\"the nod to the harsh reality of Gary Coleman in [the episode] is given: in real life a few years ago Gary had to make a living as a shop security guard.\\" Release Gary Coleman's performance in the episode has been praised by critics \\"Grift of the Magi\\" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 19, 1999. It was viewed in approximately 7.76 million households that night. With a Nielsen rating of 7.7, the episode finished 39th in the ratings for the week of December 13‚Äì19, 1999 (tied with an episode of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC)'s 20/20). It was the second highest-rated broadcast on Fox that week, following an episode of Ally McBeal (which received a 9.9 rating). On October 14, 2003, \\"Grift of the Magi\\" was released in the United States on a DVD collection titled Christmas With the Simpsons, along with the season one episode \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\", the season four episode \\"Mr. Plow\\", the season nine episode \\"Miracle on Evergreen Terrace\\", and the season thirteen episode \\"She of Little Faith\\". On October 7, 2008, the episode was released on DVD again as part of the box set The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Eleventh Season. Staff members Martin, Scully, Meyer, Matt Groening, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Matt Selman, Tim Long, and Lance Kramer participated in the DVD audio commentary for \\"Grift of the Magi\\". Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set. Since airing, \\"Grift of the Magi\\" has received generally mixed reviews from critics. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that the episode \\"feels like an amalgamation of elements from prior holiday programs and never really elicits much humor. Christmas is commercialized and corporations use and abuse their customers? Those aren‚Äôt exactly rich insights, so ['Grift of the Magi'] comes across as a below average episode.\\" In his review of the DVD Christmas With the Simpsons, Digitally Obsessed critic Joel Cunningham wrote that the episode \\"comes from Season 11, well past the point when the series had sacrificed character for absurdist humor. Unless you don't think evil toy marketers, sentient Furbys, and Gary Coleman qualify. Anyway, after the school nearly goes bankrupt, Principal Skinner signs a contract with corporate backers who use the kids to conduct market research. There are some good gags, but the story doesn't hang together very well.\\" Adam Tyner of DVD Talk argued that the episode \\"has a couple of good gags (Gary Coleman chatting on the phone being my favorite) but is quickly forgettable\\". Brian James of PopMatters described Coleman's cameo as \\"hysterical\\" in 2004, and Meghan Lewit of the same website listed \\"Grift of the Magi\\" at number eight on her 2009 list of the \\"10 best holiday themed TV episodes.\\" ReferencesExternal links * \\"Grift of the Magi\\" at The Simpsons.com  Category:1999 American television episodes Category:Christmas television episodes Category:The Simpsons (season 11) episodes ","title":"Grift of the Magi"},{"id":"1887281","text":"Szczerc√≥w () is a village in Be≈Çchat√≥w County, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Voivodeship, in central Poland.

Already as a gifted student in Paris and London he mixed with the leading lights of music and literature. Most notably, he became a friend of compatriot Joseph Conrad. During World War I, the young Retinger became politically active in Austria- Hungary and Russia on behalf of the Polish independence movement. Following a failed attempt to broker peace between Austria-Hungary and the Allies of World War I, he had to retreat to Central America, where he became an economic adviser. After the outbreak of World War II, he was principal adviser to the Polish government-in-exile. Early in 1944, a daring mission into Occupied Poland by parachute, with the help of British intelligence, added to his air of mystery and subsequent controversy. A Freemason with a reputation as a grey eminence, after World War II he went on to cofound the European Movement, which led to the establishment of the European Union, and was instrumental in forming the secretive Bilderberg Group. In 1958, he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Early life Emilian Czyrnia≈Ñski, Retinger's maternal grandfather, 1878 photo by Walery Rzewuski W≈Çadys≈Çaw Zamoyski (1853-1924) Misia Godebska Sert, Retinger's Parisian cousin J√≥zef Retinger was born in Krak√≥w, Poland (then part of Austria-Hungary), the youngest of five children: his father had a daughter, Aniela, from a first marriage to Helena Jawornicka. His mother was Maria Krystyna Czyrnia≈Ñska, daughter of a Greek Catholic Lemko professor of chemistry at the Jagiellonian University. His father, J√≥zef Stanis≈Çaw Retinger, was the personal legal counsel and successful adviser to French-born Count W≈Çadys≈Çaw Zamoyski. Retinger's great-grandfather, Filip Rettinger, was a Jewish tailor from Tarn√≥w who with his family converted to Catholicism in 1827. When his lawyer grandson died, Count Zamoyski took the promising youngster, J√≥zef, into his household and paid for him to attend the Bart≈Çomiej Nowodworski High School in Krak√≥w. Retinger's eldest brother, Emil, became a commander in the Polish Navy, while his son, , was stationed in the United Kingdom during World War II (1943‚Äì45), as a member then leader of Squadron 308 of the Polish Air Force. Retinger's brother, Juliusz, taught physiological chemistry at the University of Chicago and University of Wilno. Retinger himself initially considered a career in the priesthood, but three months in the Jesuit novitiate in Rome confirmed he would not be suited to the life. Further financed by Count Zamoyski in 1906, Retinger entered simultaneously the Ecole des sciences politiques and the Sorbonne in Paris and two years later, aged twenty, became the youngest person ever to earn a Ph.D. in literature from there. While in the French capital, armed with introductions from Zamoyski and his own relative, the salonni√®re and pianist Misia Sert, he moved in intellectual circles and was befriended by among others, Andr√© Gide, Fran√ßois Mauriac, , Jean Giraudoux, Erik Satie and Maurice Ravel. His early literary ambitions were stopped in their tracks when he presented his first novel, \\"Les Souffleurs\\" to Andr√© Gide for his opinion. Gide told him: Joseph, you will never be a writer. He next went to Munich to study comparative psychology for a year. From there, encouraged by Zamoyski, in 1910 he moved to England, where he entered the London School of Economics for a year's study and began a lobbying operation on behalf of the Polish cause and its populations scattered across three ailing empires. Formally he became Director of the London Office of the Polish National Committee (1912‚Äì1914). During this time he continued to move in √©lite circles and thanks to an introduction by Arnold Bennett whom he had met in Paris, Retinger developed a close friendship with his older Polish compatriot, the already well established novelist, Joseph Conrad. Retinger urged Conrad to visit Poland, and on 28 July 1914, the day World War I broke out, Retinger, his wife Otolia, and Conrad, his wife, and their two sons arrived in Krak√≥w, the two men's childhood stamping grounds (they were alumni of the same secondary school). Due to the closeness of the Russian border (Russia was then allied to Great Britain), the Conrads soon sought greater safety in the Tatra Mountains resort of Zakopane.Zdzis≈Çaw Najder, Joseph Conrad: A Life, Rochester, New York, Camden House, 2007, , pp. 459‚Äì63. Retinger would write about Conrad in his 1943 book, Conrad and His Contemporaries. Historian Norman Davies suggests that it was probably Conrad who introduced the \\"polyglot and polymath\\" Retinger to the British intelligence services. Later Retinger became a personal friend of Major-General Sir Colin Gubbins, wartime head of SOE, and after the war an MI6 \\"asset\\". World War I Joseph Conrad With the clouds of war closing in, the project of writing a play together with Conrad based on the latter's novel, Nostromo had to be abandoned as both men hurriedly left Austria Hungary. Retinger would have been eligible for military call up in Galicia, but no mention of this is made by his biographers. Instead, he put aside literary endeavours and once more assumed the role of a political lobbyist for Poland, publishing pamphlets and travelling between London, Paris and New York, aided by Conrad in London. In the first years of the war, this was not on the agenda of the major powers. Retinger looked instead for other potential alliances and political leverage which led to meetings with leading Zionists of the time, including Chaim Weizmann, Vladimir Zhabotinski and Nahum Sokolow who were seeking international recognition and rights for the Jewish diaspora. In 1916 guided by Zamoyski and with the approval of Herbert Asquith, David Lloyd George and Georges Clemenceau with his old Parisian connections, Sixtus and Xavier de Bourbon Parme, the Duchess of Montebello and Marquis Boni de Castellane, as well as Zamoyski's friend the Polish General of the Jesuits, W≈Çodzimierz Led√≥chowski, Retinger became a \\"courier\\" in the secretive European dynastic negotiation suing for peace with Austria. It became known as the Sixtus Affair but was a failure, due to Germany's refusal to cooperate thus making Austria more dependent on it. In 1917 he met Arthur \\"Boy\\" Capel, the half-French dilettante, polo player and \\"sponsor\\" of Coco Chanel. Capel is said to have planted in Retinger's mind the idea of a world federal government based on an Anglo-French alliance. After concerns for his personal safety due to his \\"political meddling\\" in Austria-Hungary and in the emergent Soviet Union, in 1918 Retinger was banned from France, and sought sanctuary in Spain for several months. Mexican years Jane Anderson 1917 He travelled on to Cuba and then to Mexico, where he became an unofficial political adviser to union organizer Luis Morones whom he fortuitously met crossing the Atlantic, and to President Plutarco El√≠as Calles. A glimpse of Retinger, newly divorced and love lorn for the American journalist, Jane Anderson, appears in the biography of another American woman, the communist sympathiser Katherine Anne Porter, a member of the Morones circle. In it he is described as a \\"Polish intriguer\\" and \\"British Marxist\\". In 1921 while on an obscure mission to the United States to buy saddles, Retinger was arrested and imprisoned in Laredo and Porter was despatched from Mexico to get him released. That same year Retinger had proposed that Katherine Porter and her friend Mary Doherty accompany him to Europe to do \\"collaborative work\\", an offer that was spurned. Retinger helped advance Mexico's nationalization of its oil industry in 1928. Ethridge's full review is on pp. 94‚Äì95 His activities in Mexico lasted a total of almost seven years and only ended with Calles's fall from power in 1936. They inspired Retinger to write three volumes on the tumultuous events of that Latin American republic. The Mexican years were punctuated by trips back to Europe where he took on the role of Representative in the United Kingdom of the Polish Socialist Party (1924‚Äì1928). In 1926 he married his second wife, Stella, with whom he travelled to Mexico on one occasion. After her death in 1933 his two daughters were left in the care of their maternal grandmother and were estranged from him until the 1950s. In the rest of the interwar period, he published many contributions in periodicals, such as the Polish Wiadomo≈õci Literackie (Literary News) (see Wiadomo≈õci), on literary and political subjects. Building blocks on the table W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, Polish prime minister in 1923 During World War II, Retinger who was in London, was involved in arranging for Polish troops to be transferred to Britain from France. He was bidden by Winston Churchill personally to escort W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski by plane to England from France which had just capitulated to the invading Germans. He became principal adviser and confidant to the Prime Minister of the Polish Government in Exile now re-established in London. In fact, their political relationship went back to 1916 and was strengthened during Wladyslaw Sikorski's earlier brief stint as prime minister, 1922-23 in newly independent Poland, and came to greater fruition when both men were later in exile in London. Sikorski's dependence on Retinger was the greater as he did not have mastery of English. At this time Retinger was despatched to talk with other exiled government representatives in London, who included Marcel-Henri Jaspar, Paul Van Zeeland, Paul-Henri Spaak in preparation for a post-war geopolitical landscape. He went on to posit a \\"Sikorski Plan\\" consisting of two stages, the first of which was signed in January 1942 and proposed a Polish-Czech confederation. The idea was to expand it into a Central European confederation with Poland and Lithuania, Czechoslovakia as its nucleus around which would be grouped Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia and Greece. The agenda behind this was to create a common political blue-print for smaller countries abutting larger European powers and became the basis of a Belgian-Dutch union which would mirror the Polish-Czech arrangement. This scheme of Retinger's caused problems between London and Moscow. In order not to tread on Soviet toes, the British altered their position and refused to back Sikorski's negotiations with the eight smaller European states. In his speech on the Council of Europe, Winston Churchill BBC radio broadcast on 21 March 1943 referred to the necessity of smaller nations forming groupings, but that it was too early to go into detail. The most Retinger was able to achieve was to push through the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement, signed on 30 July 1941, which provided for the formation of the Anders' army, thus ridding Stalin of the immediate human problem posed by the hundreds of thousands of Polish POWs and deportees from the Soviet occupied Kresy regions of the former Second Polish Republic, who after an arduous odyssey across thousands of miles would eventually end up as the United Kingdom's human problem. This trade-off adumbrated the Tehran and Yalta Conferences. Brushes with death Retinger narrowly avoided perishing in the sea off Gibraltar with W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, in July 1943, but for the fact that he was not needed to accompany the premier on a troop inspection in the Middle East and would be better employed in London. The spare seat on the plane went to Sikorski's daughter who died with her father. Retinger was devastated by this turn of events. His relationship with Sikorski's successor, Stanislaw Mikolajczyk was much more ambivalent, but he obtained his consent for a special mission to Poland under SOE in April 1944.Bu≈Çhak, W≈Çadys≈Çaw. \\"The Foreign Office and the Special Operations Executive and the Expedition of J√≥zef Hieronim Retinger to Poland, April‚ÄìJuly 1944\\", The Polish Review, vol. 61, no. 3, 2016, pp. 33‚Äì57. With an SOE brief and without prior training, Retinger, aged 56, parachuted into occupied Poland with 2nd Lt. Tadeusz Chciuk-Celt, (see Operation Salamander), to meet with Polish underground figures, to deliver money to the Polish underground, and to \\"explain to his fellow Poles in the homeland 'how are we going to lose this war'\\". Following at least one assassination attempt on him, Retinger expressed his frustration thus: The latter quip was a reference to elements in the Polish Underground Army, the AK who were convinced Retinger was not serving the interests of his country and should therefore be \\"removed\\". One apparent attempt to liquidate him in Poland was on the grounds of a \\"death sentence\\" to be carried out on the alleged orders of general Kazimierz Sosnkowski. It was foiled by the intervention of an old friend and AK fighter, Tadeusz Gebethner. There was also an attempt during his visit in occupied Poland to poison him, which failed. On his return to London, he spent some time in the Dorchester Hotel in London's Park Lane recovering from his ordeal of the trip, which left him lame in one leg for the rest of his life, possibly due to the Polyneuritis brought on by the poison. His first visitor at the Dorchester was Sir Anthony Eden, the foreign secretary. Immediately after the war, in 1945-6 Retinger travelled to Warsaw with emergency aid for the capital's population. It consisted largely of tons of British and US Army surplus, such as equipment, blankets and field-kitchens. When his erstwhile military escort from \\"operation Salamander\\", Tadeusz Chciuk and his new wife, Ewa, were arrested in Poland as subversives by the Polish Communist security service, Retinger allegedly appealed over their heads directly to Molotov in Moscow to have them released. Apparently the personal intervention succeeded. In 1948 the Chciuks became refugees in Germany. Jan Chciuk-Celt is the younger son of Tadeusz Chciuk, Retinger's military courier during \\"Operation Saamander\\" and was a co-author and editor of his father's war memoirs. Unwanted intrusion Dark days followed World War II when tensions rose between former Western and Eastern allies and in April 1946 Retinger's flat in Bayswater, West London, was broken into and his and his secretary's files ransacked by persons unknown. He reported the matter to Scotland Yard, but the Metropolitan Police were not overly bothered. As a result, Retinger escalated his complaint and ended up being interviewed by the Britain's security services. His view was that the newly communist embassy of the Polish People's Republic were responsible for the break-in. From the moment Winston Churchill had made his \\"Iron Curtain\\" speech in Fulton, Missouri, in April 1946, Retinger turned his efforts to a modified European project he had harboured for decades. Vision for Europe Krak√≥w plaque commemorating Retinger, \\"great pioneer of European unity\\". After World War II, Retinger feared another devastating war in Europe, this time fought between \\"Russia\\" and \\"the Anglo-Saxons\\". He became a leading advocate of European unification as a means of securing peace. Correction: although the original states Royal Institute of Foreign Affairs, it should read Royal Institute of International Affairs, known today as \\"Chatham House\\", this is likely a copyediting error at CVCE (ed.). He helped found both the European Movement and the Council of Europe, somewhat to the dismay of the philosopher Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, the post-World War I anti-bolshevist founder of the Paneuropean Union movement. Retinger, with his connections in Holland, Belgium, and Switzerland (he was a friend of Denis de Rougemont), took his cue from Winston Churchill's 1947 Zurich speech and found fertile ground with thirteen British Conservative members of Parliament who backed the idea of a loose European association of states. Working in particular with Britain's Duncan Sandys, incidentally Churchill's son-in-law, he took on the lion's share of the work and became Honorary Secretary General of the European Movement. He organised the 1948 Hague Congress which brought together the two camps of those for a unified Europe and those in favour of a federal Europe. During the congress, Retinger networked assiduously among the delegates, who included the Vatican diplomat, Giovanni Montini, the future Pope Paul VI. Ensuing discussions led eventually to the formation in 1951 of a European Coal and Steel Community. Creator of Bilderberg Retinger was the initiator and architect of the informal Bilderberg conferences in 1952-54 and was their permanent secretary until his premature death in London in 1960. The original group which met in the eponymous Dutch hotel in 1954 was gathered by Retinger and included David Rockefeller, Denis Healey with Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, as chairman. The purpose was to stimulate understanding between Europe and the US as the Cold War developed by bringing together financiers, industrialists, politicians and opinion formers. All discussions were to be strictly under Chatham House Rules. A founding member of the group, later British Labour Foreign Secretary, Healey, described the secretive Bilderberg meetings as the \\"brainchild\\" of Retinger. Grave, North Sheen Cemetery, London Despite eschewing any distinctions or medals throughout his life, in 1958 he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. He died in poverty of lung cancer. He was buried at North Sheen Cemetery in the presence of five British cabinet ministers as well as of his two younger daughters who were finally reconciled with him. According to the oration of Sir Edward Beddington-Behrens, Retinger not only had special access to 10 Downing Street but also to the White House. Retinger's long time personal assistant and the editor of his posthumous memoirs, John Pomian, actually , was another Polish emigr√© in London, later a director of the Heim gallery in London's St James's, owned by the influential Polish art historian and philanthropist, Andrzej Ciechanowiecki. Personal life Retinger married twice. In 1912 he wed the well-born Otolia Zubrzycka (divorced 1921, died 1984), with whom he had a daughter, Malina (later Puchalska). In 1926 he wed Stella Morel (died 1933) ‚Äì daughter of French-born pacifist and Dundee member of Parliament, E.D. Morel, and Mary, n√©e Richardson ‚Äì with whom he had two daughters, Maria (later Fforde) and Stasia (later French). Among his grandchildren are David French ‚Äì translator into English of Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher Saga ‚Äì and fantasy novelist Jasper Fforde. During the Great War and after, Retinger appears to have fallen under the spell of several women, especially the American journalist Jane Anderson, a supposed lover of Joseph Conrad. Retinger's own liaison with Anderson brought about the breakdown of Retinger's marriage to Otolia and drove a wedge between him and his friend Conrad. However Conrad biographer, John Stape, gives an alternative version for the cooling of relations between the two men, suggesting instead that as Retinger's enthusiasms were not shared by the novelist, shortly after the war, without his charming wife by his side, Retinger's proneness to exaggeration and tactlessness made him less socially acceptable. Controversy Over the decades since his 1960 death, the left-leaning Retinger continues to draw fascination and controversy with his political skill, his apparently selfless single-mindedness, and his lasting institutional legacy in Europe and beyond. Adam Pragier, a notable Polish exile and trenchant political commentator (and a secondary-school contemporary of Retinger's), has described him as \\"a sort of adventurer, but in the good sense of the word\\". On the other hand, detractors impugn his influence due to alleged connections, with deeply secret and malign factions, for which there is so far no reliable evidence. see fn. 19. He remains an enigma, and probably the one substantial contributor to postwar European peace who has no physical monument. In 2000 The Daily Telegraph's Ambrose Evans-Pritchard revealed, from declassified US Government records, that: This revelation touching on Cold War circumstances was subsequently analysed in greater detail in 2003 by Le Figaro commentator . However, as professor Hugh Wilford shows, the initiative to win American backing for a \\"United States of Europe\\" came neither from Allen Dulles, deputy chief, then chief of the CIA, nor from Senator William Fulbright, chairman of the American Committee on United Europe, but from European lobbyists of disparate motivation, namely Coudenhove-Kalergi and Retinger, the latter eclipsing the former due to Retinger's close connection with Winston Churchill on European matters. Retinger's plan was that the United States should be integral to political and economic support for a war- damaged Western Europe. As \\"head of casting\\" for his project, he set about finding key Americans to collaborate with him, among them Charles Douglas Jackson, Time-Life publisher in the 1940s and one-time head of propaganda at the Eisenhower White House. Retinger has inspired disparate opinions. He was a figure whose allegiances, like his roots, remain obscure and whose accounts of himself varied according to his audience, thus undercutting his reliability ‚Äì as reflected in various Joseph Conrad biographies and numerous other sources, including the considered, annotated review, by Norbert W√≥jtowicz of Poland's Institute of National Remembrance, of Marek Celt's 2006 posthumously published Z Retingerem do Warszawy i z powrotem. Raport z podziemia 1944, [To Warsaw with Retinger and Back. A Report from the Underground 1944] edited by Wojciech Frazik. The book was subsequently translated into English by Jan Chciuk-Celt and published by McFarland in 2013 as Parachuting into Poland, 1944: Memoir of a Secret Mission with Jozef Retinger, \\"Marek Celt\\", the pseudonym of Tadeusz Chciuk, was the military courier who accompanied Retinger on his parachute mission to Poland in 1944. A bond of friendship developed between the two men and they collaborated again on supplying aid to Warsaw from London in 1945-6. The disparity in views on Retinger, despite the perception of some personality flaws, does not alter Retinger's mature postwar European legacy.  Selected works By J. H.

He was a guardian of civil and political liberty. Background and early career Bernstorff was born in Hanover as a nephew of the statesman Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff (1712-72), whose position probably introduced him to Danish politics. His uncle induced him to study in the German and Swiss universities and travel for some years in Italy, France, England and Holland, to prepare himself for a statesman‚Äôs career. During these years he made the acquaintance of the poets Gellert and Jacobi, the writer Jean-Jacques Barth√©lemy, the duc de Choiseul, and Gottfried Achenwall, the statistician. After his European tour, he joined the Danish state service, first as a courtier and then from 1760 as a state official, both in foreign political and financial matters. His career was slow but steady. During the 1760s, he placed himself as an able but not outstanding official closely connected to his uncle. In the Struensee years from 1770‚Äì71, he was dismissed, but soon he was recalled by the new regime of Ove H√∏egh-Guldberg. He worked at first in the financial and economical departments, and took a special interest in agriculture. The improvements he introduced in the tenures of his peasantry anticipated in some respects the agricultural reforms of the next generation. In 1773, Bernstorff was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and his real Danish career began. He carried through the final solution of the Gottorp question through an exchange of territory with the Russian imperial family (in the 1773 Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo) and a Russian alliance. In general he supported a pro-Russian (but independent) line trying to hold Sweden in check. Since he saw Sweden as \\"Denmark-Norway's most active and irreconcilable enemy\\" and France as a Swedish ally, he avoided any conflict with England, seen as France's adversary. He created an outstanding position for himself but also made many enemies within the government. This was partly due to his alleged willfulness and partly due to political rivalry. The difficult years during the American War of Independence strengthened his wishes of an \\"active neutrality\\". His sympathy with England grew stronger when in 1779 Spain joined her enemies; and he was much inclined, the same winter, to join a triple alliance between Great Britain, Russia and Denmark-Norway, proposed by England for the purpose of compelling the Bourbon powers to accept reasonable terms of peace. But he was overruled by the Crown Prince Frederick, who thought such a policy too hazardous, when Russia declined to have anything to do with it. In 1780 he concluded a League of Neutrality with Russia and Sweden, a great foreign political triumph. At the same time he concluded a special agreement with England that secured Danish trade. A deep but temporary Russian dissatisfaction with the treaty, however, was exploited by his Danish rivals, and in November 1780, he was dismissed by Guldberg. Bernstorff kept in the background in 1780-84 as an interested observer of the political situation, but he still enjoyed support in Copenhagen merchant circles and did not give up his political ambitions. Very early, he was connected to Crown Prince Frederick (Frederick VI) and became a part of the conspiracy against Guldberg. He supported the coup d'√©tat of 1784, which made Frederick the Prince Regent. Foreign Minister 1784-97 Bernstorff was for second time made Minister of Foreign Affairs in May 1784, and that opened his real golden age. Until his death, he was in reality ‚Äúprime minister‚Äù of Denmark, the leading man of the cabinet by whose advice the Prince Regent was normally guided. He was also temporarily the President of Danish Chancellery (Home Office) in 1788-89. In Scandinavian matters, Bernstorff carried on a cautious pro-Russian policy without clashing with Sweden. The Russo-Swedish War in 1787-90 led to an abortive Danish involvement in 1788, and he managed to escape without any open breaks. During the next years he gradually phased out the Russian alliance and tried to improve relations to Sweden. Bernstorff's most important problem in this period was the French Revolution and the wars in its wake. He firmly maintained a neutral line and showed his special virtuosity in balancing the great powers in order to protect Danish trade. He strongly kept to international law but avoided provocation. His diplomacy was strong but not rigid, and he maintained the economic position of the Danish merchants and in spite of problems with both France and England. All the while, he made his course respected. Among other things, he firmly avoided a politics of convoy while he clearly refused to take any part in the intervention in France. This was probably due to his principally neutral line but also partly to his growing respect of national integrity. Domestic politics and conclusion Bernstorff was of course a foreign politician, but because of his leading role he clearly influenced domestic politics. Very early on he was known as a supporter of independent farmers and of the great agrarian reforms (the abolition of Adscription 1788) and other reform laws of the 1790s. A loyal supporter of Danish absolutism, he was, however, in many ways a liberal by nature and the relative freedom of the press of this period was probably due to his wishes. His sympathies toward England and English political conditionsquite contrary to those of his uncleinfluenced him. His cultural interests were great but he did not much influence them to any extent. Bernstorff is still considered one of the great Danish statesmen of the 18th century probably overshadowing his uncle. To his contemporaries his relatively early death was felt as a great misfortune ‚Äì though it is impossible to decide whether he would have been able to maintain his political line. Being characterised a hot-tempered and cantankerous official as a young man, he gradually emerged as a brilliant and adroit man of the world. In many ways he was one of the last representatives of the German aristocratic statesmen of Danish state service before the national reaction began. Family Count Bernstorff was twice married, his wives being the two sisters of Counts Christian of Stolberg-Stolberg and Friedrich Leopold zu Stolberg-Stolberg. He left seven sons and three daughters. His son Count Christian G√ºnther von Bernstorff (1769-1835) served as Danish secretary of state for foreign affairs and privy councillor. Another son Count Joachim Frederik Bernstorff (1771-1835) was attached to the Danish service and was associated with his brother in representing Denmark at the Congress of Vienna and in 1815 was appointed ambassador at that court. Posthumous honours Bernstorff Fjord and Bernstorff Glacier in Eastern Greenland were named after Andreas Peter Bernstorff. The Bernstorff-Gymnasium Satrup, a school in Schleswig-Holstein, is named after both Andreas Peter von Bernstorff and his uncle Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff.

Most controllers have a means of setting the frequency of irrigation, the start time, and the duration of watering. Some controllers have additional features such as multiple programs to allow different watering frequencies for different types of plants, rain delay settings, input terminals for sensors such as rain and freeze sensors, soil moisture sensors, weather data, remote operation, etc. There are two basic types of controllers, electric and hydraulic. Most automatic irrigation valves are diaphragm valves in which the water above the diaphragm must be discharged for the valve to open. In a hydraulic system, the controller and valves are connected via small plastic tubes approximately 4 mm (¬º in) in diameter. The controller opens the tube connected to the valve, allowing that valve to open. Most newer systems employ electromechanical or electronic controllers. In this scenario, the controller is connected to an electrical circuit that operates a solenoid attached to each valve (solenoid valve). When the solenoid is actuated, the water above the diaphragm is relieved and the valve opens. Although sophisticated controllers that allow irrigation schedules to be automatically adjusted according to the weather have been available for many years, until recently these controllers were out of reach of the average consumer. One type is evapotranspiration controllers or \\"ET controllers\\". Several manufacturers are now producing controllers that can be automatically updated by either a simple weather sensor, via a pager that receives a daily update from a network of local weather stations, or through soil moisture sensors.https://watergreat.com WaterGreat SR-1: An inexpensive, very easy to use, self-contained, solar powered watering system based on auto timing and soil moisture Several companies have also introduced products that gathers information from the internet to update the watering schedule.Los Angeles Times There are broadly two categories of irrigation controllers: domestic ones for gardening applications, and professional controllers for more demanding agricultural applications. While most domestic (gardening) controllers can only open/close zones based on a time duration, without any feedback from the irrigation process, professional irrigation controllers can irrigate based on volume (quantities defined in cubic meters / Gallons), receive feedback from the process, and react to actual events happening during the process. For example, the typical professional controller will calculate the actual flow rate running in the system when a specific zone is operated, compare this to a pre-configured required amount, and adjust the irrigation process if deviation from the zone's flow rate is detected; This mechanism is called \\"Flow monitoring\\", and can prevent irrigation when a burst is occurring in the main line or in the zone's hydraulic components. The controller can also alert the operator locally via its interface, or remotely by sending an SMS or a message to a central control. See also *Timer *Soil moisture sensor References * W.O.O.D.

They are best known for the hits \\"Sunday Morning\\" and \\"A way\\" or \\"Away\\" (the name is interchangeable and has been noted as both on different albums/singles). History The band formed in 1984 in Trowbridge, Wiltshire. The original lineup consisted of singer/guitarist Trevor Tanner, drummer Jan Kalicki, and bassist Graham Cox. Tanner and Kalicki had previously played together in the short-lived punk band Moskow, where Trevor performed as Trevor Flynn (his mother's maiden name). Early gigs supported the likes of the Cult, the March Violets and the Lords of the New Church. After eight gigs bass player Graham Cox was replaced by Nick Chown. In 1985, the band released their debut single, \\"Sob Story\\", followed by the mini-album, Giants and their hit song \\"Happy Boy\\". Word of mouth was such that the Bolshoi were able to sell out many of their early headlining performances. The band moved to London in 1985, and their lineup expanded to include Paul Clark on keyboards. In 1986, they released their first full-length album, Friends, and expanded their touring schedule to the U.S., South America and Poland. It was followed in 1987 by the album Lindy's Party, on which the sound was more pop-oriented. TC Wall, reviewing the album in Underground magazine, described Lindy's Party as \\"completely confident, commercial, professional, and dangerously catchy\\" and \\"a fine album that'll be caressed for generations.\\"Wall, TC (1987) \\"The Bolshoi Lindy's Party\\", Underground, October 1987, Issue 7, p. 11 Stylistically, the Bolshoi was difficult to categorize. The band has been described as a proto-goth band, similar in their live act to fellow Beggars Banquet signees, Bauhaus. Tanner was recognized for his dark, pensive lyrics that belied a social responsibility and awareness. After the release of Lindy's Party, the band recorded a fourth album, but problems with their record label management impeded its release, and they disbanded as the 1980s drew to a close. The previously unreleased fourth album, titled Country Life, had been lost for years but has now been resurrected by Beggars Banquet with extensive help from Tanner's current record label-head and Creative Director, David Paul Wyatt Perko. This new release is now available as one of five CDs in Beggar's 5-CD box set, put out via Beggar's imprint, Arkive. In December 2018, the Bolshoi's official Facebook page announced that Trevor Tanner and Paul Clark were recording a new album, under the name The Bolshoi Brothers.

Portrait in Mappin Hall of the University of Sheffield Joseph Jonas (1845 ‚Äì 22 August 1921) was the German-born Lord Mayor of Sheffield, England in 1904‚Äì05. Background Jonas was born in Bingen am Rhein, in the Grand Duchy of Hesse in 1845, and became a naturalized British citizen in 1876. (transcribed by Eric Youle). The same year he married Lucy Ann Earle; they had five sons and one daughter. He had fled his home country in 1867 to avoid military service. He went to Sheffield in about 1870 to start a steel business. He prospered and with partners ran the Continental Steel Works, which by 1890 was one of the most successful in the area, particularly with its production of high speed steel. He became a town councillor in 1890 and Lord Mayor in 1904. In 1905 he received a knighthood. He was a Justice of the Peace and a benefactor of the University of Sheffield, particularly the Applied Sciences, and also helped establish chairs in German and French.H. Mathers (2005 ) Steel City Scholars - the centenary history of the University of Sheffield; His picture now hangs in Mappin Hall of the University, and his mansion became student accommodation, Halifax Hall. Trial In 1918, Jonas was charged with two others of conspiring to contravene the Official Secrets Act 1911 with regards to discussions about munitions with a German friend and customer in 1913. One of the defendants was released before the trial was concluded as there no evidence against him and Jonas and the other defendant were found not guilty of the main felony charges, but guilty of two minor misdemeanour charges. Jonas was fined ¬£2,000 (equivalent to approximately ¬£ today) and the co-defendant ¬£1,000 and ordered to pay the prosecution's costs. Following his conviction, Jonas's Knighthood was removed in August 1918. In addition, his British citizenship was revoked, but he was not deported. Death Joseph Jonas died in August 1921 from a stroke. He was buried in All Saints Church, Ecclesall. His funeral on 25 August 1921 was attended by many local dignitaries, including the Lord Mayor of Sheffield, the local MP and representatives of Sheffield University and the local chamber of commerce.

The film is based on the biblical drama \\"Joseph and His Brethren\\". The film is considered to be the first talkie filmed in Yiddish. Production notes Joseph in the Land of Egypt was intended to exploit the burgeoning Yiddish-speaking theater-going in America by introducing them to the new medium of film. Rather than creating an original film, Green took an Italian silent film of Jewish interest and dubbed it in Yiddish. Joseph Green, the producer, also took the starring role of Joseph for himself. Reception The film was well received by audiences in both the United States and Europe. That summer, Green took his film to Poland, then the largest Jewish center in Europe. Although most theater owners were reluctant to show it there, fearing that it would spark anti-Semitism, he eventually found two theater owners who were willing to show the film during the week of Passover. According to one story, the theater owners barred the door of their office with their bodies and declared that Green could not leave until he agreed to allow them to show the film. Joseph in the Land of Egypt was an immediate success and had a 30-week run at that theater before making its way through the rest of the country. With the film's success, Green went on to produce several more films in Poland, all of which were considered highlights of the Yiddish cinema.

They were founded in 1971 by Janusz Kruk and El≈ºbieta Dmoch. The band have recorded ten studio albums, three of which have been certified Gold in Poland, and established such evergreen hits as \\"Chod≈∫, pomaluj m√≥j ≈õwiat\\", \\"WindƒÖ do nieba\\" and \\"I≈õƒá w stronƒô s≈Ço≈Ñca\\". They have won a number of local and international awards, and performed in countries around the world, such as Germany, the Soviet Union, the United States, Canada and Cuba. 2 Plus 1 enjoyed the biggest popularity in the 1970s, but remained successful into the mid-1980s. At the turn of the two decades the band achieved a notable success in Western Europe and Japan with songs \\"Easy Come, Easy Go\\" and \\"Singapore\\". The end of 2 Plus 1's activity was marked by the death of Janusz Kruk in 1992. A successful, but short lived reunion took place at the end of the 1990s. 2 Plus 1 remain one of the most successful bands in the history of Polish popular music, and their musical legacy still proves influential in Poland.  History = 1971-1975: Formation and early success  The band was founded in Warsaw in January 1971 by a guitarist Janusz Kruk and a flautist El≈ºbieta Dmoch, who both had been part of a short lived band Warszawskie Kuranty in the 1960s. The two were joined by another guitarist, Andrzej Rybi≈Ñski, and played their first live shows in hotel Bristol in Warsaw. The band worked with Polish lyricist Katarzyna G√§rtner and became the first artist to perform her songs live. Initially called Smak Miodu (Polish for \\"Taste of Honey\\"), the trio would soon rename to Dwa Plus Jeden (2 Plus 1). In the summer of 1971, the group performed their first concert to a mass audience, at the National Festival of Polish Song in Opole, and were awarded for the song \\"Nie zmog≈Ça go kula\\". Andrzej Rybi≈Ñski very soon left the group to work on his own project, Andrzej i Eliza, and was replaced by Andrzej Krzysztofik. The band performed \\"Ju≈º nie bƒôdƒô taki g≈Çupi\\" at the festival in Ko≈Çobrzeg and recorded their first EP, which featured four folk-flavoured songs. The band started to perform abroad, among others in West Berlin and the Soviet Union. 1972 saw 2 Plus 1 achieve mainstream popularity with hits \\"Czerwone s≈Çoneczko\\" and \\"Chod≈∫, pomaluj m√≥j ≈õwiat\\". The band performed at Sopot International Song Festival and in November recorded for RCA Italiana. In December 1972, their debut LP Nowy wspania≈Çy ≈õwiat was released by Polskie Nagrania Muza. Beside two previously known hits, it included songs \\"Wstawaj, szkoda dnia\\" and \\"Hej, dogoniƒô lato\\" which also became popular. The album sold very well and was later certified Gold. 2 Plus 1 were proclaimed the band of the year by several media outlets, and their acoustic pop-folk music proved especially popular with teenagers. In March 1973, Janusz Kruk and El≈ºbieta Dmoch got married. The group then performed the song \\"Zjechali≈õmy kapelƒÖ\\" at a German TV show Disco and were met with warm reception. In June, 2 Plus 1 performed for the third time at the Opole Festival and received an award for the song \\"Codzienno≈õƒá\\". In the same year, the band recorded a hit song \\"Gwiazda dnia\\" for the movie In Desert and Wilderness, based on Henryk Sienkiewicz's novel of the same name. In the spring of 1974, 2 Plus 1 performed in the United States and Canada for the first time, followed by Scotland, France, Switzerland and West Germany. With the song \\"Ko≈Çysanka matki\\", they took the 3rd place at the festival in Sopot. The group made an appearance in an all-star TV special ', performing \\"Na luzie\\", alongside such artists as Anna Jantar and Danuta Rinn. British magazine Music Week proclaimed 2 Plus 1 the star of the year. The band continued performing frequently in 1975, among others in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. Their second LP, Wyspa dzieci, was a concept album and turned out to be another success, including previously known hits \\"Gwiazda dnia\\", \\"Ko≈Çysanka matki\\" and \\"Na luzie\\" as well as the popular title song.  1976-1979: Artistry development  The group scored another hit with the song \\"Odp≈Çyniesz wielkim autem\\", which they recorded in English and released as a single in Germany. Their next project was a tribute suite to Zbigniew Cybulski, a famous Polish actor who had died in the late 1960s. The musical spectacle, showcasing more sophisticated sound than the group's previous efforts, was premiered in Opole in 1976 and received flattering feedback. Andrzej Krzysztofik left the group and was replaced by Cezary SzlƒÖzak, what gave shape to what would turn out the band's most successful line-up. In the early 1977, on the 10th anniversary of Cybulski's death, the band started to work on their third studio album, Aktor, based around the previously known musical spectacle. 2 Plus 1 toured with that repertoire not only in Poland, but also in East Germany and Czechoslovakia, where the album was released as Herec. In the same year, 2 Plus 1 released another single in West Germany, which featured songs \\"Ring Me Up\\" and \\"Free Me\\". In 1978, the band recorded Teatr na drodze, an album embracing their pre-Aktor, accessible pop-folk style. It is this album that features one of 2 Plus 1's biggest hits \\"WindƒÖ do nieba\\", which went on to become an evergreen. Other notable songs on the LP included \\"Ding-Dong\\", \\"Romanse za grosz\\" and \\"Ballada ≈Çom≈ºy≈Ñska\\", the latter with a contribution from the legendary Polish musician Czes≈Çaw Niemen. In the summer, 2 Plus 1 went to Cuba, where they performed \\"La Habana mi amour\\" and taped a TV special. At the Sopot Festival, the band won an award for \\"WindƒÖ do nieba\\" and \\"Ding-dong\\". In the same year, they released a new single \\"Taks√≥wka nr 5\\", which turned out another success. In March 1979, 2 Plus 1 visited Cuba again, where they successfully toured for two weeks. Their double A-side single, featuring songs \\"Margarita\\" and \\"La Habana mi amour\\", was the first record by a Polish artist ever released in Cuba. Meanwhile, in Poland, 2 Plus 1 released their fifth studio album, Irlandzki tancerz. The LP was inspired by Irish folk music and contained Polish translations of thirteen old Irish ballads. The album received highly favourable reviews and was another major seller in 2 Plus 1's career. A promotional musical film of the same name was premiered on television in May 1979.  1979-1981: International career  In the summer of 1979, 2 Plus 1 recorded their third single for the German market, the disco-pop song \\"Easy Come, Easy Go\\". The band performed it on the popular West German TV show Musikladen, and the East German variety show Ein Kessel Buntes. The song was a surprise success, charting within the German top 40. The follow-up album Easy Come, Easy Go, recorded entirely in English with German and American musicians, was released in early 1980. It was met with a modest success and would eventually receive Gold certification in Poland. It spawned another hit, \\"Singapore\\", which reached number 7 in Japan. In the same year, 2 Plus 1 were headlining the Sopot Festival where they performed their English-language material. In 1981, the band released a non-album song \\"I≈õƒá w stronƒô s≈Ço≈Ñca\\", which went on to become one of their biggest hits in Poland. Their second international album, Warsaw Nights, was released in the same year, promoted by singles \\"Mama Chita\\" and \\"Lady Runaway\\". The band performed in Villach, Austria and spent several months touring in the USA. However, the growing popularity of 2 Plus 1 in Western Europe was suddenly interrupted by the breakout of martial law in Poland in December 1981. As this had complicated travelling abroad, the group focused back on the Polish market. Their last international offering was the song \\"Rocky Doctor\\", released two years later.  1982-1987: New musical direction  In 1982, 2 Plus 1 released a new wave-inspired double A-side single, with songs \\"Kalkuta nocƒÖ\\" and \\"Ob≈Çƒôdu chcƒô\\", which enjoyed considerable popularity. In 1983, the band gave a critically acclaimed, avant- garde performance at the Opole Festival, where they premiered songs from the forthcoming album. Their eighth studio LP, Bez limitu, introduced the band's new image and musical style, which now explored new wave, rock and synthpop. The album spawned hits \\"Nic nie boli\\", \\"Requiem dla samej siebie\\", \\"Superszczur\\" and \\"XXI wiek (Dla wszystkich nas)\\", and was certified Gold the following year. 2 Plus 1 were in fact one of the very few artists from the 1970s who remained commercially successful in the 1980s. In February 1984, 2 Plus 1 performed a concert at the Warsaw Congress Hall, which was broadcast on television. Their next single, the uptempo synthpop track \\"Wielki ma≈Çy cz≈Çowiek\\", became one of their biggest hits. The group teamed up with Maciej Zembaty and John Porter to work on their ninth album, Video. Released in 1985, it was largely drawing from synthpop and New Romanticism, and turned out another success. The LP spawned further hits \\"Video\\" and the Polish-English \\"Chi≈Ñskie latawce\\", the latter a duet between El≈ºbieta Dmoch and John Porter. A TV special was filmed to promote the album. In 1985, Cezary SzlƒÖzak released a solo single, featuring songs \\"Bezp≈Çatny kurs\\" and \\"Inne ≈ºycie, inny ≈õwiat\\". After the release of Video, 2 Plus 1 have significantly limited their live appearances and media exposure. 1986 saw the release of the retrospective Greatest Hits Live. In 1987, Janusz Kruk started to compose music to theatrical plays, including Szale≈Ñstwa pana Hilarego, based on Julian Tuwim's short story. The band recorded one new song, \\"Ocaliƒá co≈õ\\", later released on a various artists compilation Ca≈Çuj gorƒÖco. Janusz and El≈ºbieta broke up in the second half of the 1980s, after Janusz left her for another woman. The couple divorced in 1989, but remained friends.  1988-2008: The break-up and aftermath  In 1988, 2 Plus 1 started to work on a new album and performed several new songs on a TV show Premie i premiery. In 1989, their tenth and final studio album Antidotum was released. The record didn't go as far as previous albums, but several tracks gained a moderate popularity, most notably \\"Ocalƒô Ciƒô\\". The band embarked on a tour in the USA. During one of the concerts, Janusz Kruk, who had already grappled with heart problems, fainted on stage. That prompted the group to take some time off from extensive touring, and Janusz focused on composing soundtracks to plays. In 1991, the hits collection 18 Greatest Hits became their first album released directly in CD format. In June 1992, Janusz Kruk died of a heart attack. El≈ºbieta, who never got over the loss, moved from Warsaw to a countryside, and subsequently gave up public and artistic life. In 1997, another compilation Greatest Hits Vol. 2 was released, which focused on rare and previously unreleased tracks. In the fall of 1998, Cezary and El≈ºbieta decided to reactivate 2 Plus 1, recruiting two new musicians. Their first performances were met with enthusiastic response and the band embarked on a successful tour. They appeared on several TV shows, including Szansa na sukces. However, in early 1999, El≈ºbieta suddenly decided to withdraw from all the future plans and 2 Plus 1 ultimately disbanded. Cezary SzlƒÖzak founded his own group, Cezary SzlƒÖzak Band. At the end of the 1990s, and after 2000, numerous 2 Plus 1 compilations appeared on the market, released by various record companies. In 2002, El≈ºbieta made a guest appearance at a community centre in ≈Åom≈ºa, where a teenage group staged a play as a tribute to 2 Plus 1 and their music. In January 2005, a Polish TV program Uwaga! reported on her apparently poor living conditions, which caused a massive sympathetic response. In August 2008, El≈ºbieta attended a secret 2 Plus 1 fans gathering in Warsaw.

The current Commanding General of the Military District of Washington is Major General Omar J. Jones IV. The Military District of Washington Chief of Staff, and liaison to the JFHQ-NCR, is Colonel Brandon S. Robbins. The Commanding General, Chief of Staff, and Command Sergeant Major of the Military District of Washington hold the same positions at the JFHQ-NCR, which supervises military planning for the defense of the National Capital Region. History MDW can trace its origin back to 1921 when the War Department created the District of Washington. Today MDW is one of the Army's major commands. Its installations include Fort McNair, the nation's second-oldest military post still in use, and Fort Myer, Gen. Philip Sheridan's cavalry showplace and site of the first military aircraft flight. The District of Washington initially included Fort Washington, Md., Fort Hunt, Va., the District of Columbia and Fort Myer. With the dissolution of the District of Washington in 1927, the commanding general of the 16th Infantry Brigade at Fort Hunt became responsible for conducting military ceremonies and administering discipline to service members in the nation's capital. In 1942, about five months after the U.S. entered World War II, the War Department created the U.S. Army Military District of Washington to plan for a ground defense of the nation's capital. MDW was headquartered during those years in \\"temporary\\" buildings at Gravelly Point, Virginia., near Washington National Airport. It moved to Second Street, S.W., in Washington, D.C., in the early 1960s, and to its present headquarters at Fort Lesley J. McNair in 1966. During the World War II era, MDW was gradually reorganized as a service-and- support command. One of MDW's main responsibilities was servicing the newly built Pentagon through the Army Headquarters commandant. The United States Army Band, \\"Pershing's Own,\\" also became an integral part of the command's ceremonial mission during this period. At the end of World War II, the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) was deactivated in Germany. This regiment, the oldest U.S. infantry unit, was reactivated in 1948 and assigned to MDW to meet the command's tactical commitments and for military ceremonies. Although MDW's mission has remained the same, it has gained, lost and regained various installations and support responsibilities over the years. Vint Hill Farms and Arlington Hall Station, both in Virginia, and Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., were once part of MDW. Cameron Station and Davison Army Airfield, near Fort Belvoir, joined MDW in the 1950s. In 1980 MDW gained responsibility for the administration and daily operation of Arlington National Cemetery, in addition to the ceremonial support the command has always provided. In 1987 MDW's support responsibilities for the Pentagon were transferred elsewhere. Fort Belvoir became a major subordinate command in 1988. In 1992 Davison Aviation Command was reorganized as the Operational Support Airlift Command, with responsibilities for fixed-wing Army aircraft support throughout the United States. Additionally, they provide rotary-wing (helicopter) support to Army leadership and distinguished officials in the National Capital Region. In April 1993, MDW reorganized its MACOM staff and the Fort Myer Military Community formed a garrison staff to support Forts Myer and McNair, and Cameron Station. On 1 October 1993, Fort Meade, and Fort Ritchie in Maryland, and A.P. Hill in Virginia joined the MDW family of installations. The command more than doubled in size as MDW went from four posts totaling to eight posts totaling . The number of service members and civilians on MDW installations also increased from 16,166 to 61,531. Cameron Station officially closed on 30 September 1995. Most of the organizations were relocated to either Fort Belvoir or Fort Myer. Fort Hamilton, New York, became the newest member of MDW's family of installations when it was transferred to MDW from U.S. Army Forces Command 6 October 1997. The post is 172 years old. On 10 June 2010, Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh rescinded MDW's responsibility for the administration and daily operation of Arlington National Cemetery. However, MDW still maintains ceremonial support for funerals and guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Ceremonial duties Since its inception in 1942, the Military District of Washington has been involved in protecting and staging special event ceremonies. These ceremonies include inauguration ceremonies starting with Franklin Roosevelt's 4th inauguration on January 20th, 1945. the MDW is also responsible for state funerals. They include anyone within Washington who is granted a state funeral. This includes former Presidents, Senators, Representatives, and other dignitaries. The MDW is extensively involved in the planning of and execution of a state funeral including advice and consent from the family and ceremonial support outside of Washington. The latter included a state funeral held for Richard Nixon held in the shadow of his boyhood home when he died following a stroke in April 1994.

ABC&E;'s first location was on Chicago's \\"Magnificent Mile\\" in September 1978 on the 15th floor of a North Michigan Avenue office building, along with ABC&E;'s in-house advertising agency. From 1978 to early 1990, ABC&E; remained internally financed. By 1990 the company had 34 locations including a full-service lens manufacturing facility. In April 1990, Grody sold the majority of the company in an LBO to Boston-based financial investors, Berkshire Partners, for $24 million, retaining minority ownership along with his senior management team. In December, 1993, Grody orchestrated a management-led leveraged buyout of ABC&E;, repurchasing the majority of the company for $40 million, with Berkshire Partners choosing to maintain a minority position. In April 1997, Grody sold ABC&E; in its entirety for $50 million to a strategic buyer, Chrysallis Management. Grody led the company throughout its growth until its final sale in 1997. A retail outlet in Hillsboro, Oregon By 1997, ABC&E;'s revenues were $103 million and it had about 1,400 employees plus 150 independent doctors of optometry, 100 retail stores in 25 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 28, 1999. In the episode, Homer wins a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and starts his own outlaw motorcycle club, naming it \\"Hell's Satans\\". However, this attracts the real club called \\"Hell's Satans\\" to crash at their house. After a while, they begin to appreciate Marge, who takes care of them, and kidnap her. Homer tracks them down and scuffles with Meathook, the leader of the gang. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Neil Affleck, and features several guest appearances. Plot After viewing an advertisement on TV, the family visits the 1950s-themed Greasers Cafe where Homer and Marge win a dancing contest. Their prize is a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, awarded by \\"Wolfguy Jack\\" just 3 days before the restaurant goes out of business. After Homer learns how to a motorcycle from Bart and enjoys it, he forms an outlaw motorcycle club named the Hell's Satans with Moe, Lenny, Carl, and even Ned Flanders, even though Ned rides a bicycle, Carl rides a Vespa, Lenny rides a lawnmower, and Moe's motorcycle is old. They get in trouble all across Springfield, until Homer is confronted by a Bakersfield outlaw motorcycle club named the Hell's Satans, and forced to eat all his Hell's Satans apparel for using their name. The rival group, led by two men named Meathook and Ramrod, start living at the Simpson house, generally being destructive and intimidating the Simpson family. Fortunately, Marge is able to clean up after the gang and take care of them, which they come to appreciate. One day, the Hell's Satans leave and take Marge with them, later assuring her she is safe because none of them find her sexually attractive, much to her own relief and subsequent sadness. Homer tracks them down to a campsite, where he fights with Meathook and wins back Marge. The two of them say goodbye to the gang, who plan to take advice given to them by Marge and find normal jobs. Homer returns with Marge to a biker bar where he had earlier been repeatedly beaten up, and leaves with a Duff keg. Production and themes John Goodman voiced the character Meathook in the episode. \\"Take My Wife, Sleaze\\" was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Neil Affleck as part of the eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999‚Äì2000). Guest starring in the episode were John Goodman as Meathook, Henry Winkler as Ramrod, Jay North as himself, NRBQ as themselves, and Jan Hooks as Manjula. NRBQ drummer Tom Ardolino said in an interview before \\"Take My Wife, Sleaze\\" aired that the band's appearance is \\"real quick. We're in a bar that Homer goes in looking for Marge. We're the band playing in the bar.\\" Bass player Joey Spampinato commented, \\"We got to sit around the table when they read the script and it was pretty funny stuff.\\" In addition to appearing in the episode, NRBQ performed the Simpsons theme music over the closing credits. Executive producer Mike Scully considers NRBQ to be one of his favorite bands, and their songs had already been used in three episodes of the show that aired not long before this episode was produced. The name of Homer's gang, the Hell's Satans, is a reference to the real-life motorcycle gang and organized crime syndicate Hells Angels. Authors Paul Broughton and Linda Walker analyzed the episode in their 2009 book Motorcycling and Leisure: Understanding the Recreational PTW Rider, writing: \\"This episode feeds on the stereotypical image of riders, for example, Homer says: 'Yeah, that's the life for me, Marge. Cruising and hassling shopkeepers.' The outlaw image is further reinforced within this episode when another group of bikers, also called the Hell's Satans, take offence at Homer using the name. This gang act in a stereotypical gang manner, wrecking Homer's house and kidnapping his wife. The fact that an iconic cartoon series can use such stereotypical images of riders to good effect demonstrates how much the negative rider image is ingrained within society.\\" Other references to popular culture include to the 1938 film The Adventures of Robin Hood. Homer's motorcycle sword fight with Meathook parodies the ending sword fight between Robin and Guy of Gisbourne in the film. Wolfguy Jack is a parody of radio host Wolfman Jack; his girlfriend resembles Debbie from the film American Graffiti. When Apu shoos Homer from the Kwik-E-Mart with a broom, he and Manjula adopt a stance reminiscent of Grant Wood‚Äôs painting, American Gothic. Release The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 28, 1999. On October 7, 2008, it was released on DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Eleventh Season. Staff members Mike Scully, George Meyer, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Julia Thacker, Dan Castellaneta, and Neil Affleck participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented: \\"Should we blame ['Take My Wife, Sleaze'] for the movie Wild Hogs? Maybe not, but the episode doesn‚Äôt do a lot to rise above the level of that John Travolta mediocrity. I like guest stars Henry Winkler and John Goodman, so the episode‚Äôs not a loss, but it‚Äôs not a winner either.\\" ReferencesExternal links *\\"Take My Wife, Sleaze\\" at The Simpsons.com * * Category:The Simpsons (season 11) episodes Category:1999 American television episodes Category:Motorcycle television series Category:Works about outlaw motorcycle clubs Category:Television shows written by John Swartzwelder ","title":"Take My Wife, Sleaze"},{"id":"1887415","text":"Lieutenant-Colonel William Lambton, FRS (c. 1753 ‚Äì 20 or 26th January 1823) was a British soldier, surveyor, and geographer who began a triangulation survey in 1800-1802 that was later called the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. His initial survey was to measure the length of a degree of an arc of the meridian so as to establish the shape of the earth and support a larger scale trigonometrical survey across the width of the peninsula of India between Madras and Mangalore. After triangulating across the peninsula, he continued surveys northwards for more than twenty years. He died during the course of the surveys in central India and is buried at Hinganghat in Wardha district of Maharashtra. He was succeeded by his assistant George Everest. Life Great Theodolite by Jesse Ramsden, similar to the one made by William Cary that was used by Lambton in the early surveys. Lambton was born around 1753 at Crosby Grange, near Northallerton, in North Yorkshire, the son of a farmer. He was extremely reserved about the details of his family. Even the year of birth is speculated on the basis of an incident he recounted of a dinner in Madikeri in 1803 hosted by Veer Rajender Wadeer, the ruler of the province of Coorg. The Coorg Raja made all present declare their age and Lambton is said to have mentioned his as fifty. For many years he spent a substantial portion of his salary to support his parents from which it has been suggested that he came from humble origins.Markham notes from his name that he was probably from the county of Durham and it is known that he spent early life at Darlington. He often mentioned a mathematics teacher at school by the name of Emerson. His skill in mathematics earned him a place in a grammar school at Northallerton, and he studied under Dr. Charles Hutton. On 28 March 1781, Lambton was appointed ensign in Lord Fauconberg's regiment of foot, and transferred to the 33rd Regiment of Foot. He was commissioned in the 33rd Regiment, and his ability at surveying led to work on measuring land for settlers in America. He spent most of his earning to support his parents. With his regiment he took part in the American War of Independence and was taken prisoner at Yorktown. Observing a solar eclipse through the telescope of a theodolite without darkened glasses led to the burning of the retina of his left eye. After this accident he obtained with the help of his friends, especially Sir Brook Watson, an appointment as barrack-master in New Brunswick with a salary of 400 pounds per year. He had considerable leisure during which he was able to lay, in his words, \\"...the foundation of that knowledge, which was one day to bring him to the notice of the world.\\" He was appointed barrack master in Nova Scotia and he spent many years studying mathematics on his own. In 1795 the Duke of York ordered that all civilian officers should be struck off from the regiments. Lambton then joined the 33rd at Calcutta after 13 years away from regimental duties. The 33rd Regiment was commanded by Sir Arthur Wellesley at Calcutta. Lambton's area of work Triangulation map in central India signed by Lambton and Everest In 1796, he was promoted to Lieutenant and posted with his regiment to India, under the leadership of Colonel Arthur Wellesley. He took part in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War in 1799. He was a brigade major during the Siege of Seringapatam where he led the left column after the fall of his superiors. He was also able to demonstrate his skills in navigating by the stars during the campaign by pointing out to General Baird that he was headed in the wrong direction while attempting to around Tipu's camp at night. After the capture of Mysore Lambton proposed to Wellesley that the territory be surveyed, using the new techniques of geodesy employed by William Roy in Great Britain. Lambton's proposal to conduct the survey was nearly shot down by Major James Rennel who declared that it was not needed since Colonel Colin Mackenzie was already undertaking a similar survey. The proposal was however examined by Nevil Maskelyne, Astronomer Royal and a relative of Lord Clive. Maskelyne saw the scientific value of the survey and pointed out to Rennel that he had been misinformed and gave his support to the project. Just around the time that Lambton got his survey approved by Lord Clive, he happened to hear of some instruments being carried back from China by astronomer Dr. James Dinwiddie. A set of instruments had been sent to China along with Dr Dinwiddie but the Chinese Emperor had not shown interest and the equipment was returned. Lambton was able to examine the instruments when Dinwiddie broke journey at Fort William. The instruments included a zenith sector (an upward pointing telescope with measuring instruments) of 5 ft radius, a Ramsden chain, leveling instrument, and a chronometer. Lambton also ordered an altitude and azimuth circle with a theodolite. The equipment arrived in 1801. Although a baseline was measured in Bangalore between October and December 1800, this appears to have been rejected (it was not connected to the triangulations) and another baseline was made in 1804 (using better equipment and on better terrain) to compare with the Madras baseline whose measurement began on 10 April 1802 from St. Thomas Mount and was completed with seven and a half miles measured by 22 May 1802. They then triangulated their way to Bangalore where the 1804 baseline was measured by John Warren to check the survey accuracy. The triangulation extended west to end at Mangalore. In 1806 he began his latitudinal measurement 100 miles northwards from Bangalore, where the British territory ended. He then surveyed southwards to Cape Comorin. Lambton then recommenced the survey northwards until his death. He died at Hinganghat, and the exact date of death is not known but is either 20th as recorded by most contemporary newspapers or 26 January 1823. A memorial was erected by the Resident of Nagpur, Richard Jenkins. Lambton had three acknowledged children through an Indian mistress named Kumerboo. One of them was also named William Lambton while another possibly died in infancy. He had another daughter and son through another woman Frances, possibly a Franco- Indian or Anglo-Indian. William Lambton junior joined the Survey in 1815.Keay:68-70. Surveys 587x587px Around the time that Lambton proposed a triangulation survey of the Peninsula of India, Colonel Colin Mackenzie had already begun a topographical survey of the Mysore region. Mackenzie was later designated as the Surveyor General. Lambton, with his support from Lord Clive, however did not have to report to Mackenzie and it has been suggested that Mackenzie felt undermined. Their correspondence however showed cordial relations being maintained. The triangulation survey was officially given the name of Great Trigonometrical Survey only in 1818. Lambton essentially followed a system established in England by General Roy for the Principal Triangulation of Great Britain. Lambton's initial aim was to measure the arc of a meridian so as to establish the shape of the earth. Lambton did not wish to assume any specific theoretical shape and preferred to make exact measurements. In the earliest surveys conducted in Bangalore he noted: 259x259px The Bangalore baseline of 1800 made use of a chain laid in long coffers supported on pickets and the heads were aligned using a telescope. The ground chosen was not appropriate and this early baseline measurement had to be dropped. The equipment needed for careful survey arrived only in 1801. The subsequent baselines including were made more carefully with the use of a Ramsden's chain specially calibrated for tropical temperatures, a boning telescope for angle measurements and linear alignment. A Ramsden chain consisting of 40 links of 2.5 feet each and measuring 100 feet at 62¬∞ Fahrenheit. He took special precautions to account for the expansion of the chain under the Indian weather; and repeated measurements with rotations of the telescope of the Zenith sector so as to account for collimation errors in determining the latitude (the elevation of the pole star directly provides the latitude but owing to errors related to determining the horizon and from refraction, the preferred method in surveying was to use well known stars located closer to the zenith, such as Aldebaran for India, whose declination from the pole-star had been pre-established. Lambton's assistant John Warren investigated the effect of refraction on errors in calculating the latitudes.). The main survey instrument from 1802 for the primary triangles was a Great Theodolite made by William Cary. This was very similar to the instruments used in France and Britain for previous trigonometrical surveys. It had a horizontal circle that was 36 inches wide and the readings were taken using a microscope. The vertical graduated circle was 18 inches in diameter. It weighed about half a ton and needed twelve men to carry it. Lambton measured all three angles of triangles in several cases to establish the spherical excess (angles of triangles on a sphere sum up greater than 180¬∞). When the survey was carried out from Madras to Bangalore, Lambton was able to compare the Bangalore baseline of 1804 with the calculated measurements and the difference was about three and a half inches. Honours Lambton was made a Fellow of the Royal Society (9 January 1817) and a corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1817. A narrow ridge above the Bhavani valley along the Nilgiris is named after him as Lambton's Peak Range. A commemorative bust is placed at St. Thomas Mount, Chennai, India.

It is the second largest stadium in India by seating capacity.https://www.fifa.com/u17worldcup/destination/stadiums/stadium/5008920/ Before its renovation in 2011, it was the second largest football stadium in the world, having a seating capacity of 150,000. Prior to the construction and opening of Rungrado May Day Stadium in 1989, it was the largest football stadium in the world. The stadium hosted the final match of the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup, alongside hosting other matches of the tournament. As part of security measures for the 2017 U-17 World Cup, the stadium was only open for 66,687 viewers. It will be used again for the 2021 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. The stadium's record attendance was recorded in 1997 when 131,781 spectators watched the Federation Cup semifinal between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan. The stadium switched back to natural grass from artificial turf as part of the preparations for hosting the U-17 World Cup in 2017. The new turf was unveiled in a Kolkata Derby match between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan during the 2015‚Äì16 Calcutta Premier Division match. About The stadium was established in 1984 because the club grounds in the Maidan area, each with capacity around 20,000, were proving too small for the huge crowd that occupied the grounds on matchdays. And while the Eden Gardens was there to handle some of the bigger games, like the Kolkata Derby, the pressure of handling both cricket and football was proving to be a bit too much for the stadium. The stadium is situated approximately 10 kilometres to the east of the Kolkata downtown. The roof is made of metal tubes and aluminum sheets and concrete. The stadium was inaugurated in January 1984. There are two electronic scoreboards and control rooms. There is illumination at night . There are special arrangements for TV broadcasting. The gigantic stadium features three tiers of concrete galleries. The stadium has 9 entry gates and 30 ramps for the spectators to reach the viewing blocks. The nine gates include the VIP gate. The gates 1 and 2 are on kadapara road, gate no.3, 3A, 4, 4A and 4B are on the side of Broadway; gate no 5 and the VIP gate are on the side of EM By pass. The ramps are inside the stadium and link the inner ring road to the different levels of the stadium complex. The stadium covers an area of . The stadium has a unique synthetic track for athletic meets. It has a main football arena measuring . It also houses electronics scoreboards, elevators, VIP enclosures, peripheral floodlighting arrangement from the roof- top, air-conditioned VIP rest room, conference hall and much more. The stadium has its own water arrangements and standby diesel generation sets. Renovation The renovation project started in February 2015. The artificial turf at the stadium has been replaced by an all-natural grass pitch. The new grass is from Reivera Bermuda seeds procured from the United States and below it there are two layers of sand and gravel. The next layer is fitted with perforated pipes to prevent water-logging. German company Porplastic provided the elastic coating for the running track around the pitch which was replaced for the first time since the stadium was built in 1984. The old track has been scooped out and the new surface was laid. The lobby of the VIP entrance that leads to the player's arena, was air-conditioned. The broadcast rooms and stadium offices were renovated. Bucket seats replaced the concrete benches in the galleries, which brought down the stadium's capacity from 120,000 to 85,000. The VIP and press boxes, both in the middle tier, were pulled down and a new press box with a capacity of 240 seats is now on the third tier. The VIP box remained on the second tier, with an added 240 seats. The press conference room that used to be cramped during derbies and matches featuring international teams has been shifted to a 19 x 8.5-metre space under a gallery. A spacious broadcast room of similar dimensions has been built as well. Two full-sized practice grounds with perforations on the surface for underground drainage and eight floodlight towers have come up at the Hyatt end of the stadium, as recommended by FIFA. The same imported Reveria Bermuda grass used on the main turf will cover the practice grounds. The drainage network has been designed to ensure that the surface never becomes slushy. The referees rooms have been built alongside the practice grounds. The number of gates to the stadium has been increased from seven to nine. Some of the existing gates has been widened too, as are the approaches that connect the entrances and exits to the ring road. Each link road is 21 meters wide. The surroundings has been beautified by the forest department. To the left of the lobby, rooms have been constructed for referees and ball boys. Location The stadium is located in the satellite township of Salt Lake in North 24 Parganas and it also lies beside the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass which makes it easily accessible by road.  Transportation  There are numerous buses which ply around the city to the stadium. The Line 2 of the Kolkata Metro is passing near the stadium, therefore the stadium has its own station, opened on 13 February 2020 . The stadium is approx away from N.S.C.Bose International Airport. Football matches After its inauguration in January, 1984 with the Jawaharlal Nehru International Gold Cup, the Salt Lake Stadium has hosted several important international tournaments and matches such as matches of the 1986 FIFA World Cup qualification in 1985, Super-Soccers in 1986, 1989, 1991 and 1994, 3rd South Asian Games in 1987, USSR Festival Cup in 1988, Charminar Challenger Trophy in 1992 and the Jawaharlal Nehru International Gold Cup in 1995. The Salt Lake Stadium hosts the home games of the local clubs Mohun Bagan and East Bengal who play in the I-League. It also hosts the games of Mohammedan, who currently play in the 2nd Division I-League. Many of the home games of the Indian Team are also played in the Salt Lake Stadium. Since 2014 a new tenant team Atl√©tico de Kolkata (playing in the ISL) has made the stadium their home ground. Aerial view of the Yuva Bharati Krirangan On June 5, 2011 FIFA scheduled a friendly match to be played at the Salt Lake on 2 September 2011. The match was played between Argentina and Venezuela. This was a historic occasion in the history of Indian football and also for the stadium as the match featured Argentine superstar Lionel Messi. The stadium has also hosted Oliver Kahn's official farewell match for Bayern Munich when they played a friendly match against Mohun Bagan. Bayern Munich won the match 3‚Äì0. In December 2012, a friendly match was played between Brazil Masters and IFA All Stars. Brazil Masters won it 3‚Äì1. Beto scored twice and Bebeto scored one goal for Brazil Masters. Football match during 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup On 12 October 2014, the stadium hosted the first match in the Indian Super League, preceded by an opening ceremony which featured superstars from the footballing world as well as from Bollywood. In the opening match, Atl√©tico de Kolkata defeated Mumbai City FC 3‚Äì0.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super- league/top-stories/Atletico-de-Kolkata-beat-Mumbai-City-FC-3-0-in-ISL- opener/articleshow/44794124.cms The stadium hosted its last match of the inaugural edition of ISL on 14 December where Atl√©tico de Kolkata played FC Goa in the first leg of the semi-finals. Salt Lake stadium was the only stadium among the eight venues of ISL where matches were allowed to be played on artificial turf. It hosted 11 matches in 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup, including the Final. It will be used again for the 2020 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup including the quarter-finals. Other uses The stadium also hosts important athletic events. It has hosted the SAF Games in 1987 and various national athletics events in India. The stadium also hosts different kinds of cultural programs such as dance and music concerts. The stadium also hosted the opening ceremony of 2013 IPL Season.

The game was developed as an arcade game for Midway Games by Game Refuge Inc. designers Brian Colin and Jeff Nauman, who conceived and designed the original in 1986. It was ported to the Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64, Game Boy Color, PlayStation, Microsoft Windows and has been re-released on Midway Arcade Treasures 2 as well as being included in Rampage: Total Destruction. Plot George, Lizzie, and Ralph have been released due to an explosion at a Scumlabs facility. The trio begin to destroy all of Scumlabs' bases scattered throughout the world and kill its employees. In the last levels, Scumlabs CEO Eustace DeMonic turns himself into a monster in an attempt to combat George, Lizzie, and Ralph, but is defeated during a battle on a lunar base. After this, the only surviving Scumlabs employee Dr. Elizabeth Veronica tries to disintegrate the monsters with a ray gun on her spaceship, but it only shrinks them to a miniature size, and they wind up inside her ship. George and Ralph pose on the shelves, while Lizzie bounces atop of Veronica's breasts (though the latter portion is censored on home ports). Gameplay The player's goal is to destroy buildings; as pictured here in the arcade version, George is smashing a building as a tank approaches. Like in the first Rampage game, the goal of every stage is to destroy all the buildings in each city while avoiding or destroying the military forces. If the player takes too long in destroying the city, jets will fly in and bomb the remaining buildings, ending the stage with a lower score. In the first level, Peoria, a tourism billboard cycles through different regions in the country (Northeast, Southwest, etc.). Destroying the billboard when it is showing one of these regions will send the player in that direction. Players may also choose to eat or ignore the \\"World Tour\\" power-ups and control which country they can visit. After getting a World Tour power-up, the next few levels take place in a foreign location until a Scumlabs plant is destroyed. Purple radioactive waste temporarily transforms the player into a super monster known as V.E.R.N. The game will not end until every Scumlabs city has been destroyed, which may cause some erratic traveling around towards the end of the game (including multiple world tour trips if the players have missed or purposely kept from getting world tour flags). The arcade version supports up to three players simultaneously. Though it was announced that the PlayStation version would also support three players, both the PlayStation and Saturn versions allow only two players. Three player support apparently was programmed into the port at one point and pulled at the last minute, since a review of the PlayStation version in Electronic Gaming Monthly describes three player gameplay. The Nintendo 64 conversion includes full three-player functionality. Reception Next Generation reviewed the arcade version of the game. They derided the decision to continue using sprites for the graphics instead of polygons, concluding that \\"Rampage World Tour seems aimed at satisfying gamers' yearning for past titles like Space Invaders or Pac-Man. Fair enough, but all this remake will accomplish is to make gamers yearn for the original more than ever\\". Critics agreed that the console ports are nearly arcade-perfect, though some criticized the PlayStation and Saturn versions for supporting only two players instead of the three supported in the arcade version. However, they were divided about the game itself. Many hailed it as a fun revival of an arcade classic. For example, Shawn Smith wrote in Electronic Gaming Monthly that \\"there's nothing like sitting down and playing a good old- time game. It's even better to do it when it has been enhanced, but still has the same feel as the original\\". Despite giving the PlayStation version a score of only 5.7 out of 10, Jeff Gerstmann highly recommended the game due to its new gameplay tricks and larger levels, and said the only possible way to improve on it would be with three-player support. On the other hand, the majority criticized the game's 2D sidescrolling format as antiquated, and some further remarked that the simplicity and repetitiveness of the Rampage gameplay, while highly enjoyable in arcades, was not suited to the home console format. Adam Douglas explained in IGN that the Rampage series \\"was great for getting your aggressions out and then moving on. Why would you want to play this game for hours at a time?\\" Sega Saturn Magazine similarly held that \\"the coin-op was a great laugh for about ten minutes or so, but the lack of variety in the level design and the shallow nature of the gameplay meant that it soon grew quite tiresome. Despite the meagre improvements to the update, the very same criticisms can be levelled at Rampage World Tour\\". In a review of the PlayStation version, GamePro was more undecided: \\"With plenty of special moves and power-ups to discover as you lay waste to more than 100 cities, the gameplay certainly lasts - just don't expect it to change much. Then again, sometimes it's good to turn off your brain and turn up the cosmic carnage\\". A different GamePro critic reviewed the Saturn version, and opined that the game's \\"utter failure to take advantage of new technology and add new elements to the original Rampage is inexcusable\\". Next Generation reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game, and stated that \\"despite the three-player mode, no amount of graphic flash or nostalgia can improve a style of gameplay whose day has passed\\". Charles Ardai of Computer Gaming World noted that the PC port of the game had performance and graphics issues when played in full- screen mode. The best performance was achieved when the screen was set to a postcard-sized frame. He found the action to be basic, although there is a variety of animation. He added that it is \\"suffused with all the monster movie fun that was conspicuously lacking in the recent Godzilla film\\".

It is a process by which light is converted into electrical signals in the rod cells, cone cells and photosensitive ganglion cells of the retina of the eye. This cycle was elucidated by George Wald (1906‚Äì1997) for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1967. It is so called \\"Wald's Visual Cycle\\" after him. The visual cycle is the biological conversion of a photon into an electrical signal in the retina. This process occurs via G-protein coupled receptors called opsins which contain the chromophore 11-cis retinal. 11-cis retinal is covalently linked to the opsin receptor via Schiff base forming retinylidene protein. When struck by a photon, 11-cis retinal undergoes photoisomerization to all-trans retinal which changes the conformation of the opsin GPCR leading to signal transduction cascades which causes closure of cyclic GMP-gated cation channel, and hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor cell. Following isomerization and release from the opsin protein, all-trans retinal is reduced to all-trans retinol and travels back to the retinal pigment epithelium to be \\"recharged\\". It is first esterified by lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) and then converted to 11-cis retinol by the isomerohydrolase RPE65. The isomerase activity of RPE65 has been shown; it is still uncertain whether it also acts as hydrolase. Finally, it is oxidized to 11-cis retinal before traveling back to the rod outer segment where it is again conjugated to an opsin to form new, functional visual pigment (rhodopsin).  Photoreceptors  The photoreceptor cells involved in vision are the rods and cones. These cells contain a chromophore (11-cis retinal, the aldehyde of Vitamin A1 and light-absorbing portion) bound to cell membrane protein, opsin. Rods deal with low light level and do not mediate color vision. Cones, on the other hand, can code the color of an image through comparison of the outputs of the three different types of cones. Each cone type responds best to certain wavelengths, or colors, of light because each type has a slightly different opsin. The three types of cones are L-cones, M-cones and S-cones that respond optimally to long wavelengths (reddish color), medium wavelengths (greenish color), and short wavelengths (bluish color) respectively. Humans have a trichromatic visual system consisting of three unique systems, rods, mid and long-wavelength sensitive (red and green) cones and short wavelength sensitive (blue) cones.  Process  The absorption of light leads to an isomeric change in the retinal molecule. To understand the photoreceptor's behaviour to light intensities, it is necessary to understand the roles of different currents. There is an ongoing outward potassium current through nongated K+-selective channels. This outward current tends to hyperpolarize the photoreceptor at around -70 mV (the equilibrium potential for K+). There is also an inward sodium current carried by cGMP-gated sodium channels. This so-called 'dark current' depolarizes the cell to around -40 mV. Note that this is significantly more depolarized than most other neurons. A high density of Na+-K+ pumps enables the photoreceptor to maintain a steady intracellular concentration of Na+ and K+. In the dark Photoreceptor cells are unusual cells in that they depolarize in response to absence of stimuli or scotopic conditions (darkness). In photopic conditions (light), photoreceptors hyperpolarize to a potential of -60mV. In the dark, cGMP levels are high and keep cGMP-gated sodium channels open allowing a steady inward current, called the dark current. This dark current keeps the cell depolarized at about -40 mV, leading to glutamate release which inhibits excitation of neurons. The depolarization of the cell membrane in scotopic conditions opens voltage-gated calcium channels. An increased intracellular concentration of Ca2+ causes vesicles containing glutamate, a neurotransmitter, to merge with the cell membrane, therefore releasing glutamate into the synaptic cleft, an area between the end of one cell and the beginning of another neuron. Glutamate, though usually excitatory, functions here as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. In the cone pathway glutamate: * Hyperpolarizes on-center bipolar cells. Glutamate that is released from the photoreceptors in the dark binds to metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR6), which, through a G-protein coupling mechanism, causes non-specific cation channels in the cells to close, thus hyperpolarizing the bipolar cell. * Depolarizes off-center bipolar cells. Binding of glutamate to ionotropic glutamate receptors results in an inward cation current that depolarizes the bipolar cell. In the light In summary: Light closes cGMP-gated sodium channels, reducing the influx of both Na+ and Ca2+ ions. Stopping the influx of Na+ ions effectively switches off the dark current. Reducing this dark current causes the photoreceptor to hyperpolarise, which reduces glutamate release which thus reduces the inhibition of retinal nerves, leading to excitation of these nerves. This reduced Ca2+ influx during phototransduction enables deactivation and recovery from phototransduction, as discussed in Visual phototransduction#Deactivation of the phototransduction cascade. Representation of molecular steps in photoactivation (modified from Leskov et al., 2000). Depicted is an outer membrane disk in a rod. Step 1: Incident photon (hŒΩ) is absorbed and activates a rhodopsin by conformational change in the disk membrane to R*. Step 2: Next, R* makes repeated contacts with transducin molecules, catalyzing its activation to G* by the release of bound GDP in exchange for cytoplasmic GTP, which expels its Œ≤ and Œ≥ subunits. Step 3: G* binds inhibitory Œ≥ subunits of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) activating its Œ± and Œ≤ subunits. Step 4: Activated PDE hydrolyzes cGMP. Step 5: Guanylyl cyclase (GC) synthesizes cGMP, the second messenger in the phototransduction cascade. Reduced levels of cytosolic cGMP cause cyclic nucleotide gated channels to close preventing further influx of Na+ and Ca2+. # A light photon interacts with the retinal in a photoreceptor cell. The retinal undergoes isomerisation, changing from the 11-cis to all-trans configuration. # Opsin therefore undergoes a conformational change to metarhodopsin II. # Metarhodopsin II activates a G protein known as transducin. This causes transducin to dissociate from its bound GDP, and bind GTP, then the alpha subunit of transducin dissociates from the beta and gamma subunits, with the GTP still bound to the alpha subunit. # The alpha subunit-GTP complex activates phosphodiesterase, also known as PDE6. It binds to one of two regulatory subunits of PDE (which itself is a tetramer) and stimulates its activity. # PDE hydrolyzes cGMP, forming GMP. This lowers the intracellular concentration of cGMP and therefore the sodium channels close. # Closure of the sodium channels causes hyperpolarization of the cell due to the ongoing efflux of potassium ions. # Hyperpolarization of the cell causes voltage-gated calcium channels to close. # As the calcium level in the photoreceptor cell drops, the amount of the neurotransmitter glutamate that is released by the cell also drops. This is because calcium is required for the glutamate-containing vesicles to fuse with cell membrane and release their contents (see SNARE proteins). # A decrease in the amount of glutamate released by the photoreceptors causes depolarization of on-center bipolar cells (rod and cone On bipolar cells) and hyperpolarization of cone off-center bipolar cells. Deactivation of the phototransduction cascade In light, low cGMP levels close Na+ and Ca2+ channels, reducing intracellular Na+ and Ca2+. During recovery (dark adaptation), the low Ca2+ levels induce recovery (termination of the phototransduction cascade), as follows: # Low intracellular Ca2+ makes intracellular Ca-GCAP (Ca-Gunylate cyclase activating protein) dissociate into Ca2+ and GCAP. The liberated GCAP ultimately restores depleted cGMP levels, which re-opens the cGMP-gated cation channels (restoring dark current). # Low intracellular Ca2+ makes intracellular Ca-GAP (Ca-GTPase Accelerating Protein) dissociate into Ca2+ and GAP. The liberated GAP deactivates activated-Transducin, terminating the phototransduction cascade (restoring dark current). # Low intracellular Ca2+ makes intracellular Ca- recoverin-RK dissociate into Ca2+ and recoverin and RK. The liberated RK then phosphorylates the Metarhodopsin II, reducing its binding affinity for transducin. Arrestin then completely deactivates the phosphorylated- metarhodopsin II, terminating the phototransduction cascade (restoring dark current). # Low intracellular Ca2+ make the Ca2+/Calmodulin complex within the cGMP-gated cation channels more sensitive to low cGMP levels (thereby, keeping the cGMP-gated cation channel open even at low cGMP levels, restoring dark current) In more detail: GTPase Accelerating Protein (GAP) interacts with the alpha subunit of transducin, and causes it to hydrolyse its bound GTP to GDP, and thus halts the action of phosphodiesterase, stopping the transformation of cGMP to GMP. In other words: Guanylate Cyclase Activating Protein (GCAP) is a calcium binding protein, and as the calcium levels in the cell have decreased, GCAP dissociates from its bound calcium ions, and interacts with Guanylate Cyclase, activating it. Guanylate Cyclase then proceeds to transform GTP to cGMP, replenishing the cell's cGMP levels and thus reopening the sodium channels that were closed during phototransduction. Finally, Metarhodopsin II is deactivated. Recoverin, another calcium binding protein, is normally bound to Rhodopsin Kinase when calcium is present. When the calcium levels fall during phototransduction, the calcium dissociates from recoverin, and rhodopsin kinase is released, when it (what?) proceeds to phosphorylate metarhodopsin II, which decreases its affinity for transducin. Finally, arrestin, another protein, binds the phosphorylated metarhodopsin II, completely deactivating it. Thus, finally, phototransduction is deactivated, and the dark current and glutamate release is restored. It is this pathway, where Metarhodopsin II is phosphorylated and bound to arrestin and thus deactivated, which is thought to be responsible for the S2 component of dark adaptation. The S2 component represents a linear section of the dark adaptation function present at the beginning of dark adaptation for all bleaching intensities. All-trans retinal is transported to the pigment epithelial cells to be reduced to all-trans retinol, the precursor to 11-cis retinal. This is then transported back to the rods. All-trans retinal cannot be synthesised by humans and must be supplied by vitamin A in the diet. Deficiency of all-trans retinal can lead to night blindness. This is part of the bleach and recycle process of retinoids in the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium. Phototransduction in invertebrates Phototransduction process in invertebrates like the fruit fly is different from the vertebrates. PI(4,5)P2 cycle underlies the phototransduction process. Here, light induces the conformational change into Rhodopsin and converts it into meta-rhodopsin. This helps in dissociation of G -protein complex. Alpha sub-unit of this complex activates the PLC enzyme (PLC-beta) which hydrolyze the PIP2 into DAG. This hydrolysis leads to opening of TRP channels and influx of calcium.

The belts can be used as medical restraints in institutions for bed and wheelchair restraints, and for safety in activities such as abseiling or construction work. When they are used in sexual bondage plays they are commonly referred to as bondage belts, and also worn in fetish clothing. The belts are usually fastened with buckles and some by a locking mechanism, which enables quick release. Use in fall arrest Historically body belts were used as a personal fall arrest system but OSHA rule changes meant they ceased to be acceptable for such use from 1 January 1998.  Prisoner transport  Handcuffed prisoner secured with a transport belt When transporting prisoners, leather or nylon belts are often used instead of belly chains to secure the prisoner's arms at waist level. These restraint belts have a metal ring on the front, through which the handcuffs are plugged and then put on the detainee's wrists. The belt is then placed around the detainee's waist and secured with a buckle; some models can also be locked with a padlock. For further control, a stun belt may be fastened around the prisoner's waist. In the case of misbehaviour, the device may give the subject an electric shock. Use in sexual bondage For sexual bondage plays a body belt is usually called a bondage belt. Though it is not a physical restraint by itself, it can be used to provide an anchoring point for other restraints, such as bondage cuffs, rope, etc. Lengths of simple leather strapping with buckles are sometimes also referred to as bondage belts, because they can be used quickly to bind limbs. Most bondage belts are made of fabric or leather as these materials tend to be more comfortable and better distribute pressure over the skin. Use in fashion Leather bondage belts have been worn as a fashion accessory by subcultures such as punks and goths. Sid Vicious has been cited for popularising the item in alternative fashion.

Life Haydn Wood was born in the West Riding of Yorkshire town of Slaithwaite on 25 March 1882. When he was three years old his family moved to the Isle of Man, an island which was often a source of inspiration for the composer. His two older brothers were also musicians: Harry (1868-1939) was a violinist, composer and conductor known as \\"Manxland's King of Music\\",The Life and Times of Harry Wood, Manxland's King of Music, Manxnationalheritage.im, Maurice Powell, 2018 while Daniel S Wood (1872-1927) was principal flautist with the London Symphony Orchestra from 1910, taught flute at the Royal Academy of Music and composed practice pieces that are still in use today. In 1897, at the Royal College of Music, Haydn Wood studied violin with Enrique Fern√°ndez Arb√≥s and composition with Charles Villiers Stanford.Haydn Wood, in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, by Ernest Tomlinson In 1901, he was soloist at a special concert commemorating the opening of the Royal College of Music's Concert Hall. The concert was attended by Joseph Joachim (who had heard him play before) and Pablo de Sarasate. They were so impressed that they sent him to Brussels for study with the renowned teacher C√©sar Thomson. He then embarked on a world tour, accompanying the Canadian soprano Dame Emma Albani and they continued their association for a further eight years. From 1913 he toured extensively with the soprano Dorothy Court whom he married in 1909. During this period he wrote popular songs and contributed to musical comedy productions: for example, he contributed seven numbers to the musical play Tina, which opened at the Royal Adelphi Theatre in London on 2 November 1915, and wrote all the music for Cash on Delivery at the Palace Theatre in 1917. In 1916, Haydn Wood composed his most popular song, \\"Roses of Picardy\\" for Dorothy, reportedly selling 50,000 sheet music copies per month and earning a six figure royalty sum The Life and Music of Eric Coates, Michael Payne, 2012 The song Love's Garden of Roses was written in 1915, but didn't become well known until popularised by John McCormack's recording, one of the biggest hits of 1918.Music of the First World War, Don Tyler, 2016Love's Garden of Roses, John McCormack, 1918 Another big success came in 1923 with A Brown Bird Singing. By 1926 he was able to support himself as a full time composer for the first time. From 1939, he served as a director of the Performing Right Society. On the occasion of his 70th birthday he was given a full concert dedicated to his music by the BBC. He died in a London nursing home on 11 March 1959, two weeks before his 77th birthday.Obituary, The Times, 13 March 1959, p15 Works Alongside his 200 or so individual songs and seven song cycles, Haydn Wood was a prolific composer of orchestral music, including 15 suites, nine rhapsodies, eight overtures, three concertante pieces and nearly 50 other works scored for a variety of forces. His orchestral pieces were primarily of the \\"light music\\" style; a well known piece of his is the three-movement Fantasy-Concerto. Another is his London Landmarks Suite, particularly \\"Horse Guards, Whitehall\\", which was used for many years as the signature tune for the BBC Radio Series Down Your Way. In 2018 the BBC Concert Orchestra issued a new recording of the Snapshots of London Suite (1948) and premiere recordings of five other suites: Egypta (1929), Three Famous Cinema Stars (1929), Cities of Romance (1937), Manx Countryside Sketches (1943), and Royal Castles (1952). ] The short orchestral work Soliloquy of 1946 is a miniature of more serious intent. The first of Haydn Wood's more extended concert pieces to gain attention was the Phantasie Quartet which won second prize in the first W W Cobbett chamber music competition of 1905 Musicians' Company Archive: The Cobbett Phantasy Prize, 1905 The Piano Concerto was performed at a Patron‚Äôs Fund Concert at Queen‚Äôs Hall on 14 July 1909, with soloist Ellen Edwards and Stanford conducting.Holbrooke & Wood (H): Piano Concertos, Hyperion recording, 2000 It received its Proms premiere in 1915, also at Queen's Hall.

Wood also wrote a Symphony (1908 - score now lost), and the Philharmonic Variations for cello and orchestra (1939).Song of the Birds: English Cello Music, BBC Concert Orchestra, Raphael Wallfisch, ASV 2003 The Isle of Man and folk tunes from the island inspired Wood's music, resulting in the compositions Manx Rhapsody, Rhapsody Mylecharaine, Manx Countryside Sketches, Manx Overture, and Mannin Veen. The tone poem (pub. 1933, Manx for \\"Dear Isle of Man\\") was based on four Manx folk tunes, and is one of two works written originally for wind band by Wood. The work is also occasionally performed in its orchestral version. Choral pieces include the short cantatas for chorus and orchestra Lochinvar (1912) and Ode to Genius (1940).

It is the traditional home venue of major Turkish multi-sport club Fenerbah√ße SK. The stadium was inaugurated in 1908 and renovated between 1929 and 1932, 1965 and 1982, and 1999 and 2006. On October 4, 2006, after numerous inspections by UEFA, √úlker Stadium was selected to host the 2009 UEFA Cup Final√úlker Stadium selected for 2009 UEFA Cup Final that went down to history as the last Final of the UEFA Cup football tournament, which was rebranded as the UEFA Europa League starting from the 2009‚Äì10 season. History Before √úlker Stadium was built, the field was known as Papazƒ±n √áayƒ±rƒ± (The field of the priest). The field, however, became the very first football pitch of Turkey, where the first league games of the Istanbul Football League were all held consecutively. In 1908, the local teams in the league needed a regular football field, so this land was leased from the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II for 30 Ottoman gold pounds a year. The total construction cost was 3,000 Ottoman gold pounds. The name was changed to the Union Club Field after the club which made the highest donation for construction of the ground. The Union Club Field was used by many teams in ƒ∞stanbul, including the owner, Union Club (which changed its name to ƒ∞ttihatspor after World War I), Fenerbah√ße, Galatasaray, and Be≈üikta≈ü. However, it lost its importance when a bigger venue, the Taksim Stadium, was built in 1922, inside the courtyard of the historic Taksim Top√ßu Kƒ±≈ülasƒ± (Taksim Artillery Barracks), which was located at the present-day Taksim Gezi Parkƒ± (Taksim Park). ƒ∞ttihatspor (which had close relations with the political ƒ∞ttihat ve Terakki), was forced to sell it to the state, in which ≈û√ºkr√º Saracoƒülu was a member of the CHP government. Thus, the ownership of the stadium passed to the state, but the field was immediately leased to Fenerbah√ße.

In the following years, Fenerbah√ße SK renovated the stadium and increased its seating capacity. By the year 1949, Fenerbah√ße Stadium was the largest football venue in Turkey, with a seating capacity of 25,000. The name of the stadium was changed once more in 1998, becoming Fenerbah√ße ≈û√ºkr√º Saracoƒülu Stadium, named after Fenerbah√ße's legendary chairman and Turkey's 5th Prime Minister ≈û√ºkr√º Saracoƒülu. In 1999, the latest round of renovations and capacity increasing projects started.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 21, 1999. In the episode, after Manjula gives birth to octuplets that were the result of fertility drugs, she and Apu unintentionally allow a zookeeper to exploit their babies in exchange for help after corporate sponsors abandon them for a Shelbyville mom that has given birth to nonuplets. Reception of the episode from television critics has been mixed. Plot The family visits Sh√∏p, a store based on Ikea, and decides to go to the food court. There, they meet Apu and Manjula. They say that they would like to have a baby. They eventually do, and Manjula gives birth to octuplets with the help of fertility drugs, given by the Simpsons and Apu. It makes headlines across Springfield, with local companies giving the Nahasapeemapetilons free products. However, their feat is eclipsed when a family in Shelbyville give birth to nine babies. With the discovery, the gifts are revoked. Apu and Manjula swiftly find they are not up to the task of raising eight kids all at once. Later, Apu is met by the sleazy owner of the Springfield Zoo, a man named Larry Kidkill. Kidkill offers to put Apu's children in a nursery. Although Apu is not open to the idea at first, he caves in and reluctantly accepts. The children are the stars of a show at the zoo named \\"Octopia\\", but Apu is not impressed and he wants to liberate his children from the zoo's owner, but Kidkill will not let them because they are under contract. Apu and Homer sneak into the zoo at night to rescue the octuplets. Unfortunately, Homer accidentally wakes up the nanny, who sounds the alarm. They quickly rush the octuplets to the Simpson household only for Kidkill to track them there. Homer manages to negotiate that he perform at the zoo through a new contract with a new act. After Kidkill refuses his original act (which was Homer prancing around in a monkey suit), he goes to his second plan; an act where he rides a tricycle with Butch Patrick on his shoulders, both of them dressed as Eddie Munster, on a stage as both are being attacked by cobras (some real, some animatronic snakes packed with venom). Inspired by Homer's example, Apu and Manjula resolve that they can take care of their kids, while Homer is mercilessly attacked by several of the snakes and a mongoose put in to contain them. Production and themes Actress Jan Hooks voiced Manjula in the episode. \\"Eight Misbehavin'\\" was written by Matt Selman and directed by Steven Dean Moore as part of the eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999‚Äì2000). Guest starring in the episode were Jan Hooks (as Manjula), Garry Marshall (as Larry Kidkill), and Butch Patrick (as himself). According to Jonathan Gray in his 2006 book Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality, the episode makes fun of the \\"conflation of real time and occasional predilection for time jumps\\" often seen in sitcoms. He further noted that in \\"Eight Misbehavin\\", \\"in order to fit a character's pregnancy into one episode, we skip nine months.\\" Here, Gray refers the part in the episode where a new scene starts and Homer says: \\"Man, the last nine months sure were crazy.\\" Bart responds \\"I'll say. I learned the true meaning of Columbus Day,\\" and then Marge says \\"I enjoyed a brief but memorable stint as Sideshow Marge,\\" followed by Lisa who says \\"I became the most popular girl in school, but blew it by being conceited.\\" Bart then concludes by commenting: \\"And then I learned the true meaning of winter.\\" Gray wrote in his book that \\"Here, we are treated to a parody not only of how awkwardly time jumps are proposed, but also of how ultimately irrelevant any sitcom time is ‚Äî nothing really changes, after all ‚Äî and finally, of the sort of plots that traditionally fill sitcom time.\\" The title \\"Eight Misbehavin'\\" is a reference to the song Ain't Misbehavin', by Fats Waller. Cultural references Several references to popular culture are featured in the episode. The episode's plot is loosely based on the life of the Dionne quintuplets. The store Sh√∏p is a parody of the Swedish furniture business IKEA, and the name is a reference to the similar business ST√òR. The songs played during \\"Octopia\\" are \\"Drop a Beat\\" by Moby, \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" by Guns N' Roses, Ride of the Valkyries by Richard Wagner and \\"R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.\\" by John Mellencamp. Homer's act is set to the song \\"Danger Zone\\" by Kenny Loggins. In the octuplets room there is a picture of the character Babar the Elephant dressed as former Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru. Release and legacy \\"Eight Misbehavin'\\" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 21, 1999. On October 7, 2008, it was released on DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Eleventh Season. Staff members Mike Scully, George Meyer, Matt Selman, Julia Thacker, and Steven Dean Moore participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode, as well as guest voice Garry Marshall. Deleted scenes and concept drawings from the episode were also included on the box set. The episode has received mixed reviews from critics. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that \\"With such a silly concept, [the episode] probably should flop. However, it actually works pretty well. The best moments come from those that feature the kids at the zoo, but a mix of other amusing scenes emerge. Though the show often threatens to falter, it usually succeeds.\\" Nancy Basile of About.com, on the other hand, listed the episode as one of the worst episodes of the season‚Äîthe episodes that \\"made me cringe because they included blatant gimmicks and outlandish plots\\". The episode has become study material for sociology courses at University of California Berkeley, where it is used to \\"examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects, in this case, a satirical cartoon show\\", and to figure out what it is \\"trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of American society, and, to a lesser extent, about other societies.\\" Homer's quote \\"Kids are the best, Apu. You can teach them to hate the things you hate. And they practically raise themselves, what with the Internet and all\\", entered The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations in August 2007.

It broadcasts for thirty minutes each Monday to Friday from 18:30, covering British national and international news stories and is presented by Mary Nightingale. History On 22 September 1955 when the ITV television service was launched, ITN provided an early evening news service at 5:50pm. It was known as ITN News, and presented by Gordon Honeycombe. This simple bulletin made use of a single camera, and was intended as a round-up of the day's headlines and looking at stories to be covered in more length by that evening's edition of News at Ten. On 6 September 1976, ITN News moved to 5:45pm and was renamed News at 545. The 545 marked a major departure in presentational style from the ITN News that had preceded it. Initially, the bulletins were broadcast from the Police Five studio, which enabled the producers to make extensive use of chromakey to display images behind the newscaster, several studio cameras, interviews with correspondents in the studio and on a TV monitor, and wide screen shots of the studio set at the beginning and end of the programme, and when handing over to correspondents. Alastair Burnet was the original presenter of the News at 545. Michael Nicholson fronted the bulletin on Fridays, and was also a relief presenter. Immediately after the animated visual 'roll' and electronic theme music at the beginning, an announcer intoned in a hushed tone: \\"The news at 5:45, with Alastair Burnett/Michael Nicholson\\". Other relief presenters in the late 1970s included Leonard Parkin, who at the time also regularly hosted the News at One, and Martyn Lewis. In March 1980, when Burnet departed the 545 to present News at Ten, Nicholson replaced him as lead presenter, with Carol Barnes taking over as relief presenter. In September 1986, Nicholson left the 545 to return to war reporting, and was replaced by Alastair Stewart. On 4 April 1988 the News at 545 underwent some cosmetic changes, with the animated visual 'roll' logo and electronic theme music being dropped in favour of a new computer-generated opening sequence and a more contemporary theme tune; the studio images were still inlaid using chromakey, although these were now also generated by computer. The programme was moved to the main newsroom within the ITN headquarters building, and full-length reports were now featured as part of the programme. ITN dispensed with the \\"main\\" presenter and relief host format, and instead a \\"team\\" of newscasters - Alastair Stewart, Fiona Armstrong, Nicholas Owen, Trevor McDonald, Sue Carpenter and Carol Barnes - began presenting the show on a \\"rotation\\" basis. On 13 February 1989, the introduction of a national weather forecast at the end of the programme led to the bulletin's timeslot starting earlier at 5:40pm, being extended in length and the title being changed to News at 540. Due to the Gulf Crisis of 1991, ITN were temporarily granted a full half-hour slot each evening; the continued change of time (and length) of the bulletin around this time led to the News at 540 being known simply as the ITN News. On 2 March 1992, ITN News at 540 was renamed ITN Early Evening News. The new look made good use of ITN's impressive headquarters in London with opening sequence consisting of a camera panning across the building towards the newsdesk giving a panoramic view of the newsroom. John Suchet became the lead presenter, a role in which he continued until 1999. Barnes and Owen acted as relief presenters. On 6 March 1995 all of ITN's news programmes on ITV were relaunched with a more unified look, with exception to News at Ten which maintained its separate identity. The new look, however, brought elements of News at Ten to ITN's other bulletins such as the use of the clockface of Big Ben and the News at Ten theme-tune, however the tune was rearranged differently. The studio at the time made heavy use of the colour blue - ITN's corporate colour at the time. The intro showed different images of Big Ben's clockface with the hands of the clock eventually striking the time at 5:40 - the time at which the programme began. Around this time, Dermot Murnaghan became the main relief presenter.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yLs_8TMzCU The ITV Evening News was launched on the 8 March 1999. The launch coincided with major changes to the scheduling of news programmes on ITV. ITN's Early Evening News programme was moved from 5:40pm to 6:30pm and renamed the ITV Evening News. The programme was extended to become a 30-minute programme, effectively replacing News at Ten as the channel's flagship news programme which itself was also axed at this time and replaced with a shorter 20 minute bulletin at 11:00pm entitled the ITV Nightly News. Initially, the programme was fronted by Trevor McDonald, with Murnaghan and Kirsty Young the most regular relief presenters. The axing of News at Ten proved unpopular at the time and caused outcry from politicians and the general public, and ratings for ITV's news programmes fell. ITV News at Ten returned on 22 January 2001, with McDonald once again at the helm; Murnaghan and Young became the lead presenters of the dual-headed Evening News. Mary Nightingale replaced Young a few months later when Young decided not to return following maternity leave. Mark Austin replaced Murnaghan following his defection to BBC News in late 2002. The programme relaunched on 2 February 2004 in what was then a state of the art virtual studio set dubbed the Theatre of News along with the other ITV News programmes. The move saw the ITN newscasters standing (or walking) in front of a news-wall and presenting graphics to viewers. The Theatre of News was scaled back following a relaunch on 9 February 2009, with a return to a more traditional style of presenters sat behind a desk. On 3 August 2009, it was announced that after 16 years co- presenting London Tonight, Alastair Stewart was to leave the regional news programme to become lead co-presenter of the ITV Evening News. Mark Austin would focus on ITV News at Ten, but continue as a relief presenter for the 6.30pm bulletin. On 2 November 2009 the programme was retitled as the ITV News at 6:30. The studio set was virtual, using a new green screen electronic compositing system known as 'Ultimatte'. Virtual sets can be created instantly and at low cost. Unlike traditional Chroma key systems, Ultimatte allows for such things as full camera movement and can generate artificial reflections on glass and metallic surfaces. It was announced in June 2015 that, as part of a wider restructure at ITV News, Mark Austin would return to the programme full- time, alongside Mary Nightingale from October 2015. Alastair Stewart continues to appear on the programme as a relief presenter, alongside his duties on the ITV Lunchtime News. Coinciding with the main presenter line-up, the programme is once again being referred to as the ITV Evening News. After thirty years with ITV News, it was announced on 26 October 2016 that Austin would leave at the end of the year.ITV News presenter Mark Austin to step down after 30 years with ITN Dominic Ponsford, Press Gazette, 26 October 2016 It was later confirmed on 13 December 2016 that Nightingale would become the sole presenter of the ITV Evening News from January 2017 onwards.Mary Nightingale to be sole anchor of ITV Evening News in 2017 Jasper Cox, Press Gazette, 13 December 2016 Austin presented his final bulletin alongside Nightingale on 22 December 2016.

It is a Moorland colony consisting mostly of pasture land and is predominantly an agricultural area. History After the reclamation edict of the king Frederick II of Prussia in East Frisia many new settlements were created to secure a place for the increasing population area. In 1780, after two years of debate for rights to the land, the measurement for the first piece of land, 3 Diemat (about 1.5 hectares) was awarded to Rencke Janssen. Following him were other settlers Claas Janssen, Otto Christoffers, January Focken and Harm Habben. Vossbarg initially belonged Strackholt, a town to the west, but few years later, in 1787, Vossbarg emerged as an independent municipality. The first Moorland lived as farmers of the cultivation of wheat. Starting from 1824 some craftsmen, carpenters, restaurant operators/barkeepers, cutters, bakers, and shoemakers began to settle in Vossbarg. Peat was harvested for personal fuel needs, however, there was no canal present and transportation of large quantities of peat became nearly impossible. After some years the moorland soil became depleted. The town, which had a promising beginning, began to experience poverty. The heads of families hired themselves out as day laborers to the moor companies in the neighboring towns of Spetzerfehn and Gro√üefehn. Others sought work as harvest hands in the marsh areas or in the Netherlands. During time, Vossbarg citizens were persuaded to emigrate to America in response to the other citizens who had emigrated there. Between 1850 and 1900 numerous residents of Vossbarg emigrated because of the economic and political difficulties. By the end of the 19th century, the situation in Vossbarg had improved. Artificial fertilizers were in use and the crop yields had increased. A particular blessing for Vossbarg was the founding of the power-station at Wiesmoor. Many men and women were employed there for the production of peat. Modern In 1972, Vossbarg came under the jurisdiction of Wiesmoor as a result of the district reforms instituted by the state of Lower Saxony. Through the efforts of the villagers, the 200th anniversary of the founding of Vossbarg was celebrated in 1987. Heinz Saathoff, the Vossbarg village manager, published an anniversary booklet for the occasion. Richard Ahlrichs, a teacher and native of Vossbarg, wrote the text. Numerous old photos and documents were produced by the residents and printed in the booklet or displayed in the school building of Vossbarg. The entire community was spruced up festively for the occasion. In 1972, Vossbarg came under the jurisdiction of Wiesmoor as a result of the district reforms instituted by the state of Lower Saxony.

Carpenter Canyon is accessible via State Route 160 and Carpenter Canyon Road near Pahrump. Carpenter Canyon Road is a minimally maintained dirt road reaching roughly 10 miles into the mountains and Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. A clearwater stream, the Carpenter Canyon Creek, runs through Carpenter Canyon the entire year, supporting a small population of trout, which is uncommon in the Spring Mountains and Mojave Desert. Natural history=Geology The Spring Mountains divide the Pahrump Valley, Mesquite Valley, and upper Amargosa River basin to the west from the Las Vegas Valley, to the east and which drains into the Colorado River, thus the mountains define part of the boundary of the Great Basin and Mojave Desert ecoregions. A number of springs can be found in the recesses of the Red Rock Canyon area which lies on the mid-eastern side of the range. One of the more notable springs feeds Carpenter Canyon Creek. Plants In Lower Carpenter Canyon, Creosote bush - Larrea tridentata and golden native bunchgrasses dominate the landscape. Moving further up in elevation, Banana yucca - Yucca baccata, Mojave yucca - Yucca schidigera, and the Joshua Tree - Yucca brevifolia appear more frequently. Small flowering plants also become common. At around 5,000 feet, Utah Juniper -Juniperus osteosperma trees and Single-leaf Pinyon - Pinus monophylla are introduced, and above this elevation they dominate the terrain. Towards the source of the creek, and the head of the canyon Ponderosa Pine - Pinus ponderosa and a wide variety of flowering plants are prevalent.

It also took over the insurance functions of the former Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB). Between 1989 and mid-1995, the Resolution Trust Corporation closed or otherwise resolved 747 thrifts with total assets of $394 billion.http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/banking/2000dec/brv13n2_2.pdf Its funding was provided by the Resolution Funding Corporation (REFCORP) which still exists to support the debt obligations it created for these functions. History The Resolution Trust Corporation was established in 1989 by the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA), and it was overhauled in 1991., Resolution Trust Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring, and Improvement Act of 1991, 12 December 1991, 102nd Congress. In addition to privatizing, and maximizing the recovery from the disposition of, the assets of failed S&Ls;, FIRREA also included three specific goals designed to channel the resources of the RTC toward particular societal groups. The goals included maximizing opportunities for minority- and women- owned contractors, maximizing availability of affordable single- and multi- family housing, and protecting local real estate and financial markets from asset dumping. Of the three goals, only the protection of local markets and concerns over dumping was given a great deal of attention. The agency was slow to implement Minority and Women-owned Business (MWOB) and Affordable Housing programs. The Resolution Trust Corporation was a 501(c)(1) organization.\\"Section 501(l)\\". Internal Revenue Code. Legal Information Institute. Cornell University Law School. Retrieved 21 June 2017. In 1995, the Resolution Trust Corporation's duties were transferred to the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). In 2006, the SAIF and its sister fund for banks‚Äîthe bank insurance fund (BIF)‚Äîalso administered by the FDIC, were combined to form the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) under the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005. Equity partnership After initially emphasizing individual and bulk asset sales, the Resolution Trust Corporation pioneered the use of equity partnerships to help liquidate real estate and financial assets inherited from insolvent thrift institutions. While a number of different structures were used, all of the equity partnerships involved a private sector partner acquiring a partial interest in a pool of assets, controlling the management and sale of the assets in the pool, and making distributions to the RTC based on the RTC's retained interest. The equity partnerships allowed the RTC to participate in any gains from the portfolios. Prior to introducing the equity partnership program, the RTC had engaged in outright individual and bulk sales of its asset portfolios. The pricing on certain types of assets often proved to be disappointing because the purchasers discounted heavily for unknowns regarding the assets, and to reflect uncertainty at the time regarding the real estate market. By retaining an interest in asset portfolios, the RTC was able to participate in the extremely strong returns being realized by portfolio investors. Additionally, the equity partnerships enabled the RTC to benefit by the management and liquidation efforts of their private sector partners, and the structure helped assure an alignment of incentives superior to that which typically exists in a principal/contractor relationship. The following is a summary description of RTC Equity Partnership Programs: Multiple Investor Fund Under the Multiple Investor Funds (MIF) program, the RTC established limited partnerships (each known as a Multiple Investor Fund) and selected private sector entities to be the general partner of each MIF. The RTC conveyed to the MIF a portfolio of assets (principally commercial non- and sub-performing mortgage loans) which were described generically, but which had not been identified at the time the MIF general partners were selected. The assets were delivered in separate pools over time, and there were separate closings for each pool. The selected general partner paid the RTC for its partnership interest in the assets. The price was determined by the Derived Investment Value (DIV) of the assets (an estimate of the liquidation value of assets based on a valuation formula developed by the RTC), multiplied by a percentage of DIV based on the bid of the selected general partner. The general partner paid its equity share relating to each pool at the closing on the pool. The RTC retained a limited partnership interest in the MIF. The MIF asset portfolio was leveraged by RTC-provided seller financing. The RTC offered up to 75% seller financing, and one element of the bid was the amount of seller financing required by the bidder. Because of the leverage, the amount required to be paid by the MIF general partner on account of its interest was less than it would have been if the MIF had been an all-equity transaction. The MIF general partner, on behalf of the MIF, engaged an asset manager (one or more entities of the MIF general partner team) to manage and liquidate the asset pool. The asset manager was paid a servicing fee out of MIF funds, and used MIF funds to improve, manage and market the assets. The asset manager was responsible for day-to-day management of the MIF, but the general partner controlled major budgetary and liquidation decisions. The RTC had no management role. After repayment of the RTC seller financing debt, net cash flow was divided between the RTC (as limited partner) and general partner in accordance with their respective percentage interests (the general partner had at least a 50% interest). Each of the MIF general partners was a joint venture among an asset manager with experience in managing and liquidating distressed real estate assets, and a capital source. There were two MIF transactions involving more than 1,000 loans having an aggregate book value of slightly over $2 billion and an aggregate DIV of $982 million. Mortgage trusts The N-series and S-series mortgage trust programs were successor programs to the MIF program. The N-series and S-series structure was different from that of the MIF in that the subject assets were pre-identified by the RTC (under the MIF, the specific assets had not been identified in advance of the bidding) and the interests in the asset portfolios were competitively bid on by pre-qualified investors with the highest bid winning (the RTC's process for selecting MIF general partners, in contrast, took into account non-price factors). =N series= The \\"N\\" of the N series stood for \\"nonperforming\\". For the N series, the RTC would convey to a Delaware business trust a pre- identified portfolio of assets, mostly commercial non- and sub-performing mortgage loans. Pre-qualified investor teams competitively bid for a 49% interest in the trust, and the equity for this interest was payable to the RTC by the winning bidder when it closed on the acquisition of its interest. The trust, at its creation, issued a class A certificate to the private sector investor evidencing its ownership interest in the Trust, and a class B certificate to the RTC evidencing its ownership interest. The class A certificate holder exercised those management powers typically associated with a general partner (that is, it controlled the operation of the trust), and the RTC, as the class B certificate holder, had a passive interest typical of a limited partner. The class A certificate holder, on behalf of the trust, engaged an asset manager to manage and liquidate the asset pool. The asset manager was paid a servicing fee out of trust funds. Typically, the asset manager was a joint venture partner in the class A certificate holder. The asset manager used trust funds to improve, maintain and liquidate trust assets, and had day-to-day management control. The class A certificate holder exercised control over major budgetary and disposition decisions. The trust, through a pre-determined placement agent designated by the RTC, leveraged its asset portfolio by issuing commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs), the proceeds of which went to the RTC. Because of the leverage, the amount required to be paid by the class A certificate holder on account of its interest was less than it would have been if the N-Trust had been an all- equity transaction. Net cash flow was first used to repay the CMBS debt, after which it was divided between the RTC and class A certificate holder at their respective equity percentages (51% RTC, 49% class A). There were a total of six N-series partnership transactions in which the RTC placed 2,600 loans with an approximate book value of $2.8 billion and a DIV of $1.3 billion. A total of $975 million of CMBS bonds were issued for the six N-series transaction, representing 60% of the value of N-series trust assets as determined by the competitive bid process (the value of the assets implied by the investor bids was substantially greater than the DIV values calculated by the RTC). While the original bond maturity was 10 years from the transaction, the average bond was retired in 21 months from the transaction date, and all bonds were retired within 28 months. =S series= The S-series program was similar to the N-series program, and contained the same profile of assets as the N-series transactions. The S series was designed to appeal to investors who might lack the resources necessary to undertake an N-series transaction, and differed from the N-series program in the following respects. The S-series portfolios were smaller. The \\"S\\" of S series stands for \\"small\\"; the average S-series portfolio had a book value of $113 million and a DIV of $52 million, whereas the N-series average portfolio had a book value of $464 million and a DIV of $220 million. As a consequence, it required an equity investment of $4 to $9 million for investor to undertake an S-series transaction, versus $30 to $70 million for an N-series transaction. The S-series portfolio was not leveraged through the issuance of CMBS, although it was leveraged through a 60% RTC purchase money financing. In the N-series program where CMBS were issued, the asset managers had to be qualified by debt rating agencies (e.g., Standard & Poor's) as a condition to the agencies' giving a rating to the CMBS. This was not necessary in the S-series program Assets in the S-series portfolios were grouped geographically, so as to reduce the investors' due diligence costs. There were nine S-series transactions, into which the RTC contributed more than 1,100 loans having a total book value of approximately $1 billion and a DIV of $466 million. The RTC purchase money loans, aggregating $284 million for the nine S-transactions, were all paid off within 22 months of the respective transaction closing dates (on average, the purchase money loans were retired in 16 months). Land Fund The RTC Land Fund program was created to enable the RTC to share in the profit from longer term recovery and development of land. Under the Land Fund program, the RTC selected private sector entities to be the general partners of 30-year term limited partnerships known as Land Funds. The Land Fund program was different from the MIF and N/S-Series programs in that the Land Fund general partner had the authority to engage in long-term development, whereas the MIFs and N/S-Series Trusts were focused on asset liquidation. The RTC conveyed to the Land Fund certain pre-identified land parcels, and non/sub-performing mortgage loans secured by land parcels. The selected general partner paid the RTC for its general partnership interest in the Land Fund. The winning bid for each Land Fund pool would determine the implied value of the pool, and the winning bidder, at closing, would pay to the RTC 25% of the implied value. The land fund investors were given the option of contributing 25%, 30%, 35%, or 40% of the equity for commensurate interest, but all chose to contribute 25% of the equity. The Land Fund general partner could, at its discretion, transfer assets in Land Fund pools to special-purpose entities, and those entities could then borrow money collateralized by the asset to fund development. Furthermore, a third-party developer or financing source could acquire an equity interest in the special purpose entity in exchange for services or funding. The general partner was authorized to develop the land parcels on a long term basis, and had comprehensive authority concerning the operation of the Land Fund. Costs to improve, manage and liquidate the assets were borne by the Land Fund. Net cash flow from the Land Fund was distributable in proportion to the respective contributions of the general partner (25%) and RTC (75%). If and when the Land Fund partnership distributed to the RTC an amount equal to the RTC's capital investment (i.e., 75% of the implied value of the Land Fund pool), from and after such point, net cash flow would be divided on a 50/50 basis. Land Fund general partners were joint ventures between asset managers, developers and capital sources. There were three land fund programs, giving rise to 12 land fund partnerships for different land asset portfolios. These funds received 815 assets with a total book value of $2 billion and DIV of $614 million. Judgments, deficiencies, and chargeoffs (JDC) program Under the judgments, deficiencies, and chargeoffs Program (JDC), the RTC established limited partnerships and selected private sector entities to be the general partner of each JDC Partnership. The JDC program was different from the MIF, N/S Series and Land Fund programs in that the general partner paid only a nominal price for the assets and was selected on a beauty-contest basis, and the general partner (rather than the partnership itself) had to absorb most operating costs. The RTC would convey to the limited partnership certain judgments, deficiency actions, and charged-off indebtedness (JDCs) and other claims which typically were unsecured and considered of questionable value. The assets were not identified in advance, and were transferred to the JDC partnership in a series of conveyances over time. The general partner was selected purely on the basis of perceived competence. It made payments to the RTC in the amount of one basis point (0.01%) of the book value of the assets conveyed. The general partner exercised comprehensive control in managing and resolving the assets. Proceeds typically were split 50/50 with the RTC. Operating costs (except under special circumstances) were absorbed by the general partner, not the JDC partnership. JDC general partners consisted of asset managers and collection firms. The JDC program was adopted by the FDIC and is still in existence. See also *Fractional-reserve banking *Tax Reform Act of 1986 *Cottage Savings Association v.

It is an elective procedure that is done to relieve pain and restore function to the joint after damage by arthritis or some other type of trauma. Types=Joint replacement Hip joint replacement. Humerus-Head Endoprosthesis. Epoca Shoulder Arthroplasty System by Synthes For the last 45 years the most successful and common form of arthroplasty is the surgical replacement of arthritic or destructive or necrotic joint or joint surface with a prosthesis. For example a hip joint that is affected by osteoarthritis may be replaced entirely (total hip arthroplasty) with a prosthetic hip. This would involve replacing both the acetabulum (hip socket) and the head and neck of the femur. The purpose of this procedure is to relieve pain, to restore range of motion and to improve walking ability, thus leading to the improvement of muscle strength. Other types of arthroplasty *Interpositional arthroplasty, previously a popular form of arthroplasty, with interposition of some other tissue like skin, muscle or tendon to keep inflammatory surfaces apart *Excisional or resection(al) arthroplasty in which joint surface and bone is removed. The remaining ends are attached, or left to give time for scar tissue to fill in the gap. One variant of is the Stainsby procedure which consists of excision of part of a proximal phalanx in a metatarsophalangeal joint, reduction of the plantar plate and kirschner wire fixation of the metacarpal bone to the remaining phalanx. *Resurfacing arthroplasty, where one or both bone surfaces are trimmed and replaced with a smooth metal covering.

The museum was originally founded in 1932 by the Republican Government of Catalonia. The modern institution was created under the Museums of Catalonia Act in 1990 by the Ministry of Culture of the same Government. The head office is located in the former Palace of Graphic Arts, which was built on the Montju√Øc hill for the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition. The pavilion was initially to be dismantled once the event was over, but it was conserved and refitted by the architect Josep Gudiol before the museum opened its doors in 1932.  Venues  The museum is composed by a group of five museum venues archaeological sites in several places of Catalonia:  1. MAC Barcelona  Barcelona venue (MAC Barcelona) Officially, Museu d'Arqueologia de Barcelona i Institut de Prehist√≤ria i Arqueologia. The museum was designed by Pelagi Mart√≠nez i Patricio, covers an area of 4,000 m and is structured into five chronological spaces: prehistory; protohistory, the Greek and Phoenician colonisations; the Roman Empire; and, finally, the Visigoths, marking the start of the medieval period. Some of the main attractions are the Greek statue of Asclepius from the 3rd century BCE which was discovered in Emp√∫ries, the Iberian Treasure of Tivissa and the votive crown from the Treasure of Torredonjimeno.  2. The Greco-Roman city of Emp√∫ries  The village of Sant Mart√≠ d'Emp√∫ries is on a small isthmus that has been settled since the 9th century BCE, when it was inhabited by Indigetes. The town itself was built around the 6th century BCE by Greek colonists and was later occupied by the Romans during the Punic Wars. Archaeological recovery of the site began in 1908 and 25% of the site has been excavated. In addition to the outdoor exhibits, many of the artifacts discovered here can be seen in the museum on the site.  3. MAC Girona  Founded in 1846 as the \\"Provincial Museum of Antiquities and Fine Arts\\", making it one of the oldest museums in Catalonia. It was relocated on several occasions until it arrived at its current location in the Benedictine monastery of Sant Pere de Galligants in 1857. It became a part of MAC in 1992.  4. The monuments of Ol√®rdola  Th settlement at Ol√®rdola was continuously inhabited from the 8th century BCE to the time of the Reconquista. The site includes an Iron Age fortified nucleus, an Iberian settlement, a Roman fortification and a medieval town with Romanesque and pre- Romanesque churches and medieval tombs cut into the rock. It was opened to the public in November 1971 and became part of the Archaeology Museum of Catalonia in 1995.  5. The Iberian settlement of Ullastret  Located in the Baix Empord√†, the Iberian town of Ullastret is the largest Iberian settlement discovered so far in Catalonia, with a history stretching back to the 5th Century B.C. Excavations started in 1948 and continue to this day. Visitors can walk around the ruined walls and cobbled streets of the village, as well as visit the Ullastret Monographic Museum, which is also part of the complex.  The Submarine Archaeology Centre of Catalonia  Officially, Centre d'Arqueologia Subaqu√†tica de Catalunya (CASC) in Girona. Created in 1992 to protect underwater archeological sites and part of MAC since 1996, the centre's mission is to take inventory, protect, conserve, and study underwater heritage sites in Catalonia. In addition to its own projects, CASC provides support for external archeological teams.

He was a member of the Craon family, son of Renaud le Bourguignon and Ennoguen de Vitr√©. Robert was born around the turn of the 12th century, the youngest of the three sons of Renaud de Craon. He settled in Aquitaine and was engaged to the daughter of the lord of Angoumois, but gave up his wedding and travelled to Palestine after learning of the foundation of the Templar Order by Hughes de Payens. He soon showed his military valour and his piety, and in 1136, after the death of Hughes, he was chosen as the new Grand Master. He proved to be a brilliant organizer and legislator, and turned the Order into a major force in the Crusader states. On March 29, 1139, Pope Innocent II issued the bull Omne Datum Optimum, which exempted the order from tithes and made them independent of any ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The Templars were also granted the habit of a red cross over a white tunic, which has since become the popular image of any crusader. He was less fortunate as a military leader. As soon as he had been elected, he defeated Zengi, the emir of Aleppo and let his knights plunder the enemy camp; Zengi returned and destroyed the unorganized pillagers. Robert authorized the Spanish Templars to lead a naval expedition of about 70 ships against Lisbon, but this also ended in defeat. In 1140 the Templars resisted a numerically superior Turkish army at the Battle of Tecua. In 1143, after protracted negotiations between Raymond Berenguer IV (the Count of Barcelona and a Templar) the order's mission on the Iberian peninsula was defined. According to William of Tyre, Robert participated in the Council of Acre during the Second Crusade in 1148, but according to the Obituary of Reims, he died in January 1147, and was succeeded by Everard des Barres in April that year.

It broadcasts for twenty-five minutes each Monday to Friday from 13:30, covering British national and international news stories and is presented by Nina Hossain. History Television broadcasting hours in the United Kingdom had been tightly regulated and controlled by the British government until 1972, when the then Conservative government under Prime Minister Edward Heath decided to end all limits and restrictions on the broadcasting hours of television. ITV had been campaigning for the end of the restrictions since the mid 1960s, and finally on 19 January 1972, the government announced the lifting of all restrictions, allowing proper daytime television to launch on both the BBC and ITV.https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1972/jan/19/television- and-radio-broadcasting-1 ITN had provided a short lunchtime news summary to start the ITV schedules on a Saturday since 1959, with an afternoon news summary on a Sunday starting in the mid 1960s, however it was the lifting of the restrictions in 16 October 1972 which helped ITN to launch a codified, more solid weekday lunchtime news programme as part of a raft of new programming which would now take up broadcasting hours which were up to 1972 restricted to schools programming and adult education.http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/itw/features/Limits.htmlhttps://www.transdiffusion.org/2002/01/01/daytime The programme was first broadcast on 16 October 1972 as First Report, a twenty-minute bulletin presented by Robert Kee at 12:40pm. The bulletin was moved to 1:00pm on 7 September 1974 and retitled as News at One on 6 September 1976. Leonard Parkin and Peter Sissons alternated as the programme's lead presenters in the same year after Kee's departure. On 20 July 1987, the bulletin was relaunched as News at 12:30. Jon Snow and former BBC newsreader Julia Somerville fronted alternate editions of the programme. On 7 March 1988, ITV's daytime programming was rejigged and the bulletin was moved back to its 1:00pm timeslot. News at One later relaunched on 16 October 1989 with John Suchet as its lead presenter. On 7 January 1991, the programme moved this time to 12:30pm. On 2 March 1992, News at 12:30 was relaunched as the Lunchtime News with a dual-presenting team comprising Nicholas Owen and Carol Barnes. On 6 March 1995, ITN's news bulletins were relaunched with a cohesive identity. The Lunchtime News on air team was revamped, this time with a returning Julia Somerville alongside Dermot Murnaghan. Owen and Barnes remained as relief presenters. On 8 March 1999, coinciding with a further relaunch of ITN's news bulletins, John Suchet returned to the newly named ITV Lunchtime News to replace Murnaghan, now lead presenter of the new ITV Nightly News. On 22 January 2001, the ITV Lunchtime News reverted to single presentation with Nicholas Owen. On 2 February 2004, ITV News was relaunched and the 12:30pm bulletin was restructured: Owen was joined by Katie Derham in a return to a dual-presenting team; then, on 11 April 2005, the programme was extended to 60 minutes. The 15-minute regional news bulletin at 3:00pm was axed and incorporated into the new 60-minute ITV Lunchtime News. On 4 September 2006, the 60-minute format was axed, returning to its shorter length and at a new broadcast time of 1:30pm. On 5 February 2007, Owen left to join BBC News and was replaced by Alastair Stewart. On 27 July 2009, the ITV Lunchtime News returned to a single presenter, with Stewart and Katie Derham alternating. Derham later left ITV News in June 2010 and was replaced by Nina Hossain. On 2 November 2009, the bulletin was retitled as ITV News at 1:30 as part of a rebrand of the channel's news programmes. Since 12 October 2015, the programme was being referred to as the ITV Lunchtime News.

Film rights were purchased by the Robert Leder Company for $100,000. Originally TV director Don Stewart was meant to direct and Chuck Connors was going to star as the sheriff. Film rights were bought by a black film producer, William D. Alexander, who formed a company, The Movie People, to make the film and reportedly spent a year putting it together. Bill Schiffrin who sometimes acted as Sam Fuller's agent said he put the film together. The first draft of the script was done by Sam Fuller. It was rewritten by Millard Kaufman. Schiffrin says Kaufman \\"distorted\\" much of what Fuller wrote. \\"I wanted Fuller\\", he said. Schiffin says Terence Young was hired as director at the insistence of the European investors. Young was best known for his work on the James Bond films. In a bit of stunt casting, he hired Luciana Paluzzi, who had played Bond villain Fiona Volpe in Thunderball, as Trixie in this film. The studio had American Joanna Moore dub in Paluzzi's lines. Schiffin says he wanted Moore to play Paluzzi's role originally. \\"I never thought an Italian should play a Southern girl.\\" \\"The day Young was hired I should've left the show\\", said Schiffin. \\"Four times during filming I wasn't speaking to Young.\\" Fuller claimed Paramount had a prior commitment with Italian partners as a payback for a prior deal and when Young came on the film Fuller walked off the project Alexander obtained a $1 million guarantee from Paramount. The rest was raised from various banks and tax shelters in the US and Europe. Richard Burton was to be paid $40,000 a week for ten weeks work plus a percentage. Lee Marvin got 10% of the profits. Production Although Simpson appeared in an unreleased 1973 film called Why?, this film marks his acting debut.AFICatalog Filming took place in Oroville, California, just outside Sacramento. Burton and wife Elizabeth Taylor stayed in a rented house in town.Elizabeth Taylor Confesses 'Pure Animal Pleasure' for Richard Burton in Steamy Love Letter ABC News \\"It's enchanting here\\", Burton told the press during filming. \\"It reminds me of my old valley in Wales.\\" Richard Burton allegedly drank so much alcohol during the making of this film that many of his scenes had to be shot with him seated or lying down, due to his inability to stand. In some scenes, he appears to slur his words or speak incoherently. Burton later said that he could not remember making the film. Simpson said \\"There would be times when he couldn‚Äôt move\\". Burton gave a young girl in town, Kim Dinucci, a $450 diamond ring and arranged for her to get a small walk-on part in the film as Lee Marvin's daughter. This made national news. Burton went to hospital after filming and was treated on bronchitis. While he was staying there it was announced Burton and Taylor would be getting divorced. Burton ended up residing in hospital for six weeks. Walter Schiffin later said Burton should not have been paid \\"at all considering the performance he gave. He was... drinking three quarts a day. He didn't know what town he was in let alone what film\\". Schiffin says that, in contrast, Lee Marvin \\"was highly helpful throughout the shooting\\". Simpson said that despite being incapacitated, Burton \\"could change the meaning of a scene with just his voice. I studied that. We used to play a game: try to ignore Richard Burton when he's talking. It's impossible\\". Aldo Tonti, the cinematographer who had worked on Reflections in a Golden Eye, was also the cinematographer on this film, though he was not credited. Post-production difficulties Lee Marvin later said his character was meant to be a war hero and had a son who did not want to go to West Point. There was a subplot where Burton's character sided with the son. All this was cut from the final film. In addition, Marvin was not paid a final $50,000 owed to him. While the film was being edited at Sam Goldwyn Studios, the studios caught fire. At the last minute, one of the investors failed to come up with the money so Marvin and Burton were not paid their full salary and Paramount put a lien on the film. Fuller said he later met Terence Young when both were members of the Festival du Film Policier de Cognac. Though Fuller originally had a grudge against Young, he was won over by Young's insistence that he had never read the original script and had only accepted the direction of the film to pay debts. Fuller admired his honesty. Reception Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it \\"a thoroughly clumsy adaptation of William Bradford Huie's novel\\", adding that the filmmakers \\"effectively defuse the very real drama by so lovingly depicting the horrors that one comes to suspect their motives. As the movie progresses, the events comes to seem less and less urgent and particular to a specific time and place, and more and more like the automatic responses to the demands of cheap, easy melodrama.\\" Arthur D. Murphy of Variety declared it \\"a perfect example of screen trash that almost invites derision ... There's not a shred of quality, dignity, relevance or impact in this yahoo-oriented bunk\\". Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film one star out of four and called it \\"a tawdry rip-off of a half-dozen films: In the Heat of the Night, The Liberation of L.B. Jones, tick ... tick ... tick ... what's amazing about this drivel is that Lee Marvin and Richard Burton lent their talents to it. They must have been offered a very sweet deal, because The Klansman is pure \\". Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times slammed the film as \\"one of those sleazy, exploitative, incompetent pieces of motion picture waste which makes you suddenly unsure that film reviewing is a fit occupation for a grown man ... If any frame of the film carried a convincing sense of the real tensions, fears, hatreds and tempers of the rural American South you might be able to forgive some of the rest. But the acting is so amateurish in the lesser roles as to be comical and the dialogue in the major roles is unplayable.\\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called it \\"the sort of film that raises only academic questions. Could the original source, a novel by William Bradford Huie, have been as terrible as the movie? Probably not, but it must have given the screenwriters, Millard Kaufman and Sam Fuller, a few ugly situations to kick around, like a castration and a pair of interracial rapes and a shootout with the Ku Klux Klan, and they've proceeded to kick them around like champion Hollywood hacks, leaning hard on the exploitation elements and reducing characterization and social analysis, if there were any, to a bare minimum\\". Alexander, Young and Burton were meant to make a film with Robert Mitchum and Charlotte Rampling called Jackpot but it was never made.

There were 76 episodes across four series, the first broadcast on 22 January 2001 and the last on 31 July 2004. Premise The series focused on six young adults who lived in London. Each episode was presented from a different character's point of view, which up to that point in time had never been done before in a comedy-drama television programme. The programme had a cult following and received critical acclaim. It was considered groundbreaking and was compared to another British serial drama Hollyoaks. Part of the programme's identity was the style, such as surreal fly-on-the-wall style camera work, fast camera transitions, wacky sound effects added to some scenes and the distinctive theme music (the tune \\"Would you...?\\" by the band Touch and Go). Episode four of the first series was awarded an RTS Television Award for Best Tape or Film Editing - Drama. Several notable episodes were centred around parodies of other films or TV shows, including The Blair Witch Project (episode 1x16); Moulin Rouge (2x20); The Italian Job (3x12) and 24 (4x04). In the beginning, the gang was divided in two. We learn Sooz, Jamie and Alex are good friends. Jamie has a crush on Nikki, who he sees as a nice, innocent, delicate girl. Nikki was friends with Sasha, who was in a relationship with Rob. When Jamie invited Nikki to a fake party, the destinies of these six persons crossed and friendships were born. While Rob, Jamie and Alex became good friends, Nikki and Sasha didn't get along with Sooz, although the three had their moments together. Characters=Main * Jamie Collier (Paul Chequer) :The loveable joker of the group is a well-meaning pleasant guy, but has a tendency to get himself into trouble due to his rather naive attitude. He has an optimistic outlook and is content to play the role of the group's clown. Despite the foolish mistakes he sometimes makes, he is well liked by the group as his heart seems to be in the right place. :During the first series, Jamie enjoys the freedom of single life: he dates an older, married woman he met over the internet; idealizes Nikki, courts her and fails miserably; and eventually ends up kissing Sooz in the last episode. The second series follows the Jamie-Sooz relationship turmoil: from the problematic beginning, to the outing and eventual ending of the relationship by Sooz. Jamie ends up with Nikki for a one-night stand. The third series follows Jamie's undying love and sacrifice for Sooz, his coping with her coma, and eventually the distance torn between them due to her suicide attempt. The fourth series focuses primarily on Jamie's academic career or the lack of such: he fakes his leaving to Inverness; attempts to retake the qualifying tests and eventually is accepted to study psychology. Sooz and Jamie are together throughout most of the fourth series, but end up breaking up after Sooz is unfaithful. * Suzanne 'Sooz' Lee (Emily Corrie) :A sarcastic punk who tends to be blunt and is something of a loner. She is rebellious, and does not follow social conventions, preferring to live by her own rules. :Sooz has a brief crush on Rob, which starts when he is in a break up with Sasha. When they get back together, Sooz has to get over it. :Sooz has to deal with ongoing mental health problems. She favours punk rock style clothing, has a number of tattoos and facial piercings, and is known for her trademark multicoloured dreadlocks. She is a talented artist. She has a tough exterior but inside is very insecure. :Sooz's dreadlocks inspired the 2004 McFly hit \\"Five Colours In Her Hair\\". * Nikki Sutton (Jemima Rooper) :A girl who initially considered a \\"slut\\" in that she slept around and stole other people's boyfriends. Nikki is a man-eater and spoiled, but inside is a nice girl and a good friend. She suffered a lot after her father was sent to prison and because her mother didn't pay her enough attention. The last episode of the series was from Nikki's point of view, in which she chose between staying with Rob or going on an around the world trip, a present her mother gave her. * Alexander \\"Alex\\" Stanton (Orlando Wells) :A gay character who is a fan of Star Wars, Dead Poets Society and football, hates Hollywood musicals and modern art, and prefers sex to shopping. Alex is in several relationships during the series, including police officer Dan, and Mark. When he serves as auxiliary teacher at a school, he meets one of the students, Allen (who calls himself \\"Little Al\\" after Alex, who is also known as Al). Allen forces him into a relationship; after feeling threatened at first, Alex put things clear to Allen. Alex then tries to insert Allen to the gay world, and they become friends. In the last episode, Alex realizes he wants to be with Allen, but Allen rejects him. * Sasha Williams (Caroline Chikezie) :The \\"bitch\\" of the group. She is classy and loves fashion. She does not suffer fools gladly, and is often derided for shallowness. In the first seasons, Sasha is romantically involved with Rob, but they eventually break up after Sasha is unfaithful. She later tries to get Rob back, but without success. * Robert \\"Rob\\" Conway (Benjamin Waters) :Rob is someone who cares a lot for the others and always seems sensitive to their problems. Sooz has a crush on him in the first season, but because Rob is with Sasha, Sooz knows that she and Rob will never be a couple. After Rob finds out Sasha was cheating on him, he starts a new relationship with Nikki. In the last episode, they go their separate ways, with Nikki having to decide between him and a trip around the world. He receives a few letters Nikki had sent way before leaving, and he realizes she went to Spain. He finds her, telling her he came for her. Recurring characters * Louise (Jaki Walker): a friend of Nikki and, later, the whole gang, although they all found her annoying and try to avoid her most of the time. Nikki hung out with her every time Sasha neglected her for Rob. Louise was always looking for a lost cause to fight for, and the gang made fun of her for it. * Chris (Freddie Annobil-Dodoo): Sasha's boyfriend in between Rob, who was with her just for sex. Alex once told the group Chris was gay because he saw him hugging another man in a bathroom, but it was a misunderstanding. Nikki later tried a move on Chris, just to be used for sex and dumped afterwards. * Gaby (Anna Wilson-Jones): a married woman who Jamie met on the internet. She was mother to a little boy (Jackson). Gaby and Jamie spent a night together and Gaby broke up with him the next day. After a while, Jamie thought Gaby was carrying his baby, but it was really Philip's (Gaby's husband). * Dan Parker (Adam Sinclair): a gay cop Alex met in a club and lied to about his age. When Dan learnt the truth, he broke up with Alex, although they eventually got to be friends. Dan always worried about Alex and his well- being. * Gary (Gerard Monaco): Louise's boyfriend who cheated on her with Nikki. It is not known if Louise ever knew about this or they just broke up, as Gary just stopped appearing in the show, but Louise seemed to stay friends with Nikki and the gang. * Anna (Georgina Rylance): a woman Jamie meets in a club. * Riggs (Ray Fearon): a musical producer who Nikki was interested in, but he hit on Sasha instead, which caused Nikki to get jealous and have constant arguments with Sasha. Sasha first rejected Riggs, although he invited her to work with him. Finally, she cheated on Rob with him. After that, Sasha and Rob broke up for good. The relationship didn't work. * Mark Wilde (Callum Blue): Alex's bisexual boyfriend. Alex learned Mark was previously married, and broke up with him for lying about his bisexuality; they later got back together just to break up again. After that, Mark went into a relationship with Nikki. * Christian (Matthew Chambers): an estate agent Nikki dates to get a flat for her and Sasha. While Nikki thought she was using Christian to her advantage, the truth is he was using her as well. * Tyler (O. T. Fagbenle): an Art student with whom Sooz cheated on Jamie. * Amber (Angel Coulby): Rob's fiancee. They didn't get married because Rob broke up with her before the wedding after realising his feelings for Nikki. * Allen Rissbrook (James Kristian): also known as \\"Little Al\\", Allen is a gay student that approached Alex and threatened him into a relationship. Later, Alex set things clear and became friends with Allen, trying to introduce him to the gay world. When Alex finally realised his feelings towards Allen and tried to be with him, Allen rejected him. * Katie (Jemima Abey): a student friend of Allen who fell in love with Jamie. She was the one who told Jamie about Sooz cheating on him with Tyler. * Darna (Jessica Gerger): Sasha's co-worker at a fashion boutique. * Paul Sutton (Jesse Birdsall): Nikki's father who went to prison for tax evasion.

Traditions Before Harvard opted to use a lottery system to assign residences to upperclassmen (beginning with the class of 1999), Eliot was known as a 'prep' house, providing accommodation to the university's social elite, and being known as \\"more Harvard than Harvard\\". Describing Eliot House in the late 1950s and early 1960s, author Alston Chase wrote, \\"[A]lthough most Harvard houses in those days reflected the values of Boston Brahmin society ... Eliot was more extreme\\". The motto 'Floreat Domus de Eliot' and 'Domus' are traditional chants and greetings, particularly on Housing Day, when freshman find out their housing assignments. Some traditions of Eliot House are the charity event An Evening with Champions, the Eliot Boat Club (an intramural crew team), formal dinners such as the Charles Eliot Dinner, a strong sense of house pride, and the annual Spring Fete.

The College Area is dominated by San Diego State University (SDSU; once known as San Diego State College), after which the area is named. Several neighborhoods in the College Area were developed in the 1930s, with others becoming established in the post-war period.‚ÄúHistorical Neighborhoods.‚Äù College Neighborhoods, 2013. http://collegeneighborhoods.com/history/baja.html. The College Area is bordered on the west by Kensington and Talmadge and on the east by the city of La Mesa.

The region includes Alvarado Hospital, a 306-bed acute care facility, and the College-Rolando branch of the San Diego Public Library.  History  On August 18, 1948, the \\"Campus Drive-In\\" movie theater with a capacity for 900 cars was built at the intersection of College Avenue and El Cajon Boulevard. The opening night films were Give My Regards to Broadway and The Kansan. The final two features in 1983 were The Dark Crystal and Dragonslayer. In 1961, snack-bar employee Tom O'Leary was convicted of manslaughter for stabbing a patron named Dennis O'Connor to death at the drive-in. The O'Connor family sued the company for wrongful death but did not prevail. The dead man's family became active in city politics and eventually his sister Maureen O'Connor was elected mayor of San Diego in 1986. Three neon drum majorettes wearing Indian headdresses from the Drive-In are preserved in the Vons shopping center at this location and one large one is preserved in the College Grove Shopping Center in Rolando Park.

It is home to HC Sparta Prague of the Czech Extraliga and is the second-largest ice hockey arena in Europe. It has hosted important sporting events such as the two Ice Hockey World Championships (2004 and 2015), first edition of prestigious tennis Laver Cup, the European Athletics Indoor Championships, the Euroleague Final Four 2006, the World Floorball Championship, the Davis Cup finals, as well as a handful of NHL and KHL games, including a 2014 Gagarin Cup final. It can also host stage shows, such as concerts, and other large-scale events. History An ice hockey match at O2 Arena Laver Cup at O2 Arena The idea of building a new arena in Prague came on the heels of the \\"golden era\\" of Czech ice hockey: winning the gold medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics and three gold medals in a row at the Ice Hockey World Championships. The arena was proposed to be built in time to host the 2003 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships, but due to unforeseen complications with the investors, the ice hockey governing body had to switch that tournament to Finland. The arena's main backer then became Sazka a.s., a Czech betting company. The construction of the arena (which began in September 2002) was not without problems, but it was finally finished in time to host the 2004 tournament, the 2004 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships. In March 2008, the building was renamed O2 Arena.Praha prijde o Sazka Arenu.

Slavia won the national championship on home ice in Game 7 of the 2008 Extraliga finals against HC Karlovy Vary 4-0 in front of a then- league-record crowd of 17,117. In 2015, Slavia was relegated to the 1.liga, and the club chose to move back to the smaller Zimn√≠ stadion Eden, the team's former home and current training centre. In its place, O2 Arena reached an agreement with cross-town rivals Sparta Prague on 24 June 2015. Sparta ownership cited the need for significant renovations at Tipsport Arena as the main reason for the move. For two seasons, 2012‚Äì13 and 2013‚Äì14, O2 Arena also hosted occasional home games of HC Lev Prague of the Kontinental Hockey League. The club played its home games of the 2014 Gagarin Cup Finals at O2 Arena, attracting the three largest crowds in league history. In 2015, O2 Arena co-hosted the IIHF World Championship with ƒåEZ Ar√©na in Ostrava for the second time. This time, the tournament re-established the record for World Championship attendance. In 2017, it hosted the 1st edition of Laver Cup international indoor hard court men's tennis tournament between Europe and Team World.

It is considered \\"the most conservative Iranian newspaper.\\" Hossein Shariatmadari is the editor-in-chief of Kayhan. His official position is representative of the Supreme Leader. Kayhan has about 1,000 employees worldwide. There are conflicting reports about its circulation numbers: in 2006 the BBC gave \\"60-100,000\\", in 2007 the New York Times gave \\"about 70,000\\", and in 2008 a New York University School of Law journal article gave \\"350,000\\". Kayhan also publishes special foreign editions, which include the English-language Kayhan International. History and profile Kayhan was founded in February 1943 by owner Abdolrahman Faramarzi and Mostafa Mesbahzadeh as editor-in-chief. Later the roles of Faramarzi and Mesbahzadeh were reversed. Published in Iran as well as in London, the newspaper had a circulation greater than one-million prior to the 1979 Islamic Revolution. In 1974 Kayhan media group introduced itself as \\"the largest newspaper and magazine publishing house in the Middle East\\".Forugh Mesbahzadeh, the wife of Kayhan's major owner, officially appeared as the manager of the leading Iranian women's magazine, Zan-e Rouz. After the overthrow of the Shah all of Mesbahzadeh's assets were seized, including the publishing plant, which was the main headquarters of the daily. In May 1980, Ayatollah Khomeini named Ebrahim Yazdi, then foreign minister, as head of the daily. Under the guidance of Mesbahzadeh, the London office of Kayhan continued its work and publishes a monarchist weekly issue known as Kayhan London, which has a small circulation. In 2006, Mesbahzadeh died at the age of 98 in Los Angeles, California. The paper focuses on political, cultural, social and economic news. (subscription required) Political orientation Kayhan supports the Iranian government and the policies of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Shariatmadari stated that the newspaper and its staff \\"defend the ideology of the Islamic Revolution.\\" Gareth Smyth, the former Iran correspondent of the Financial Times, contends that Kayhan articulates the political views of the \\"regime's fundamentalist camp.\\" The New York Times correspondent Michael Slackman writes that the newspaper \\"offers insight into the most extreme views of Iran‚Äôs leaders and into the mind-set and plans of those who are at the center of power.\\" A former editor of Kayhan, Mahmoud Shamsolvaezin, a \\"reformist\\" and a staunch anti government activist, states, \\"The truth is, Kayhan is an intelligence newspaper.\\" Shariatmadari rejects the labels \\"conservative\\" and \\"fundamentalist\\", saying \\"They make us sound like the Taliban.\\" Instead, he calls himself and those with similar views \\"principalists.\\" Principalists is also the name of the majority faction of the Iranian Parliament. This group is also referred to as \\"neo-principalists\\" and includes such figures as Gholamali Haddad Adel and Saeed Jalili among the others. In fact, the daily is the print media outlet of the group. Controversies The newspaper became controversial in 2010 for iterating an unequivocal condemnation of then French First Lady Carla Bruni for her open letter about the death sentence against Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani for adultery and alleged murder; the newspaper called Bruni an \\"Italian prostitute\\" and \\"the singer and decadent actress who managed to break [up] the Sarkozy family\\" who \\"deserves to die\\" for her \\"perverted lifestyle\\", reiterating the striking similarities between Ashtiani and Carla Bruni, and also condemned actress Isabelle Adjani as a prostitute. The French foreign ministry condemned the comments as \\"unacceptable\\" and summoned the Iranian ambassador to France; the Iranian foreign ministry sought to distance itself from Kayhan's comments, with spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast stating that \\"The media can properly criticize the wrong and hostile policies of other countries by refraining from using insulting words. This is not correct.\\" In 2020, following its expulsion from Iran, Kayhan's editor, Hossein Shariatmadari, described M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) as an \\"American puppet\\" because it is \\"based in France and all anti-Iranian groups have a base in France.\\" See also * List of newspapers in Iran References Category:1943 establishments in Iran Category:Mass media in Tehran Category:Newspapers published in Iran Category:Persian-language newspapers Category:Publications established in 1943 ","title":"Kayhan"},{"id":"1887658","text":"Kirkju√° is a river which runs through the village of S√∏rv√°gur in the Faroe Islands.

As Preceptor of the Templars in France from 1143, he was one of the highest dignitaries of the Order when Robert de Craon died in 1147. He was chosen to succeed Robert, and as soon as he was elected, he accompanied Louis VII of France on the Second Crusade, and was among those sent ahead to Constantinople before Louis' arrival there. He later saved Louis during a battle with the Seljuk Turks in Pisidia. According to the chronicler Odo of Deuil, Everard was extremely pious and valiant. He seems to have had a strong influence on Louis. After the failure of the crusade at the Siege of Damascus in 1148, Louis returned to France, followed by Everard, who was in charge of the king's treasury. Everard's Templars stayed behind and helped defend Jerusalem against a Turkish raid in 1149. Back in France, Everard abdicated officially in 1151 and became a monk at Clairvaux, despite the protests of the Templars. He was succeeded by Bernard de Tremelay (who actually led the Order since Everard's departure in 1149) and died in 1174.

Early years Lauter was born in White Plains, New York. He worked as a model for a professional photographer and was a rodeo rider before moving into acting. Lauter came from an entertainment-oriented family, with his father and grandfather having been part of The Flying Lauters trapeze act. Career Lauter's acting break came with a role in The Magnificent Rogue (1946), in which he played a model. He came to be a familiar presence in supporting roles in low-budget films, serials (where he was often cast because of his facial resemblance to stuntman Tom Steele, who would double for him), and television programs in the 1950s. Only once did he really came close to stardom, as Clay Morgan, one of the leads in the CBS television series Tales of the Texas Rangers, which aired fifty-two episodes from 1955 to 1958. His co-star was Willard Parker as Ranger Jace Pearson. Lauter portrayed Ralph Cotton on the television version of The Roy Rogers Show. He made appearances on many television programs, particularly westerns: The Gene Autry Show (sixteen episodes), Annie Oakley (twelve episodes), The Lone Ranger and The Range Rider (eleven episodes each), Gunsmoke and Rawhide (ten episodes each), Death Valley Days and The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet (seven episodes each), Laramie and Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater (six episodes each), The Virginian and State Trooper (five times each), and Cheyenne, Bonanza, and Maverick (three episodes each). Lauter appeared twice as Johnny Tyler in 1959-1960 in two episodes of the ABC/Warner Brothers western series Colt .45, starring Wayde Preston. Lauter was cast twice on the NBC children's western series Fury, with Peter Graves and Bobby Diamond, and on Tombstone Territory, starring Pat Conway. Lauter also appeared on NBC's Jefferson Drum, National Velvet, and Riverboat, on CBS's Have Gun - Will Travel, with Richard Boone, and the syndicated western-themed crime drama U.S. Marshal. In 1958 he appeared in the episode \\"Rodeo\\", along with Lee Van Cleef, Barbara Baxley, and Dan Blocker, on the CBS crime drama Richard Diamond, Private Detective, starring David Janssen. Later he guest-starred in the 1962-1963 ABC drama series Going My Way with Gene Kelly. He also made a guest appearance in 1963 on CBS's Perry Mason in \\"The Case of the Potted Planter.\\" His last screen appearance was in 1979 as Marshal Charlie Benton in James Arness's ABC series How the West Was Won. Most of his career was spent as a serviceable second lead or heavy, though he continued to play bit parts in larger pictures, including an uncredited part as a plain-clothes policeman in the 1949 crime drama White Heat, which starred James Cagney and Edmond O'Brien. He also had an uncredited, non-speaking role in the 1963 Stanley Kramer comedy It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World as a police dispatcher. The son of an artist, Lauter devoted much of his energy late in his life to his own painting and the operation of an art gallery. Personal life Lauter was married to Barbara Ayres. Death Lauter died of a heart attack on October 30, 1990, in Ojai in Ventura County, California, at age 76. His ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean.

History  The castle was built in 1295 by Roger Mortimer de Chirk, uncle of Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March as part of King Edward I's chain of fortresses across the north of Wales. It guards the entrance to the Ceiriog Valley. It was the administrative centre for the Marcher Lordship of Chirkland. The castle was bought by Sir Thomas Myddelton in 1593 for ¬£5,000 (approx. ¬£11 million ). His son, Thomas Myddelton of Chirk Castle was a Parliamentarian during the English Civil War, but became a Royalist during the 'Cheshire rising' of 1659 led by George Booth, 1st Baron Delamer. Mullioned and transomed windows were inserted in the 16th and 17th centuries; the castle was partly demolished in the English Civil War and then rebuilt. Following the Restoration, his son became Sir Thomas Myddelton, 1st Baronet of Chirke. The castle passed down in the Myddelton family to Charlotte Myddelton (on the death of her father in 1796). Charlotte had married Robert Biddulph, who changed his name to Robert Myddelton-Biddulph, leaving the castle on his death to their son Robert. It then passed down in the Myddelton-Biddulph family. From before WWI until after WW2 the castle was leased by Thomas Scott-Ellis, 8th Baron Howard de Walden, a prominent patron of the arts and champion of Welsh culture. In 1918 Chirk Castle was used as film location for Victory and Peace, directed by Herbert Brenon. The Baron opened up parts of the castle to evacuees during the later part of the Second World War.https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/18/a3970118.shtmlhttps://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north- wales-news/evacuees-who-were-made-kings-2911141 The Myddelton family returned to live at Chirk Castle until 2004.https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north- wales-news/welshmans-home-not-castle-2932383 Lieutenant-Colonel Ririd Myddleton was an extra equerry to Queen Elizabeth II from 1952 until his death in 1988. Chirk remained in the Myddelton family until it was transferred to the National Trust in 1981. The castle and gardens are open to the public between March and October, with limited opening dates in November and December. The castle is from Chirk railway station. Landscape The property is also notable for its gardens, with clipped yew hedges, herbaceous borders, rock gardens and terraces and surrounded by 18th century parkland. The surrounding parkland was originally laid out as a deer park in the 14th century. From the early 17th century there were both formal and kitchen gardens adjacent to the castle, probably on the eastern side. The gardens continued to develop after the Civil War, including the construction of an outer courtyard to the north, surrounded by stone walls with a wrought-iron gateway. By 1719 the courtyard had been turfed over and the gates replaced by a magnificent set of wrought-iron gates and gatescreen made by Robert and John Davies of Bersham. A panoramic view of the park by Thomas Badeslade, published in 1742, shows the resulting grand baroque layout of formal gardens and avenues. This included formal gardens to the east of the castle, with a walled outer courtyard and kitchen gardens to the north. Most of this layout was swept away by extensive landscaping in the 1760s and 70s, undertaken by William Emes, on behalf of Richard Myddelton, including the construction of a ha-ha and the removal of the Davies gates to be re-erected at the New Hall entrance. These works were largely responsible for the present-day appearance of the park. A prominent feature of the park is the earthwork of Offa's Dyke, which passes within 200 metres of the castle. This is shown on the Badeslade drawing, labelled as ‚ÄòKing Offa‚Äôs Ditch‚Äô, with the ornamental lake beyond. The earthwork was partly submerged by the creation of the lake. In 2018 and 2018 the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust excavated a section across Offa‚Äôs Dyke here, and found substantial remains of the ditch and bank. The parkland landscape had partly been responsible for preserving the remains of the Dyke. The Oak at the Gate of the Dead lies 300m from Chirk Castle and marks the site of the 1165 Battle of Crogen. The castle was used as a special stage in the 2013 Wales Rally GB.

Life and career Born in Bloomington, Illinois to Rufus and Nellie n√©e Scott,Obituary of Rufus Mowrer - Chicago Daily Tribune; January 1, 1942 - Page 35 Mowrer graduated from the University of Michigan in 1913. From his elder brother, Paul Scott Mowrer, the editor of Chicago Daily News, Mowrer received a job and in 1914 went to France as a foreign correspondent. From there he reported on events throughout the First World War, including the Italians' defeat at the Battle of Caporetto. In 1916, he married Lilian Thomson; the two had a daughter, Diana, and would remain together until Mowrer's death 61 years later. Mowrer remained a correspondent in Europe throughout the 1920s and 1930s, living in Rome for eight years until 1923, before moving to Berlin. In 1933, Mowrer won the Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence for his reporting on the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany, and was named president of the Berlin Foreign Press Association. In his dispatches from Germany he had managed to cut below the patina of normalcy to capture events that challenged the belief that Germany's transformation was democratic and natural; he was therefore a target of Nazi ire. In addition to reporting for the Chicago Daily News, Mowrer wrote a best-selling book, Germany Puts the Clock Back, published in 1933, which had angered Nazi officials to the point where Mowrer's friends believed he faced mortal danger. The German government openly pressured him to leave the country, with Germany's ambassador to the United States notifying the State Department that because of the \\"people's righteous indignation\\" the government could no longer hope to keep Mowrer free from harm. When the Chicago Daily News learned about the threats, Frank Knox, the owner of the newspaper, offered Mowrer a position in the paper‚Äôs bureau in Tokyo. Mowrer, who did not want to leave Germany, agreed to leave before covering the annual Nazi Party spectacle in Nuremberg set to begin 1 September 1933. After American diplomatic missions to Germany refused to guarantee his and his family's safety, and after a futile personal appeal to newly appointed US ambassador to Germany William Dodd, Mowrer agreed to depart immediately, in return for the release of Paul Goldmann, an elderly Jewish correspondent for the Austrian newspaper Neue Freie Presse, who was being held by the Gestapo for high treason. A Nazi official, assigned to make sure Mowrer actually left Berlin, approached him as he was boarding the train and asked when he was coming back to Germany; Mowrer answered: \\"Why, when I can come back with about two million of my countrymen.\\"Larson 2011, Chapter Twelve: Brutus Initially, he became the Chicago Daily News Tokyo correspondent, then later took over as the Paris bureau chief, continuing to report on European affairs until France's defeat by German forces in 1940. Returning to the United States, Mowrer served as the Deputy Director, first of the Office of Facts and Figures, then, after the OFF's consolidation, of the Office of War Information, from 1942 until 1943. Upon his departure, he started his column \\"Edgar Mowrer on World Affairs,\\" which he later supplemented with a column entitled \\"What's Your Question on World Affairs?\\" After the Second World War, Mowrer wrote a number of books and helped organize the Americans for Democratic Action. In 1956, he took over as editor of Western World magazine, a position he held for four years. In 1969, he moved to Wonalancet, New Hampshire and wrote a column for The Union Leader until 1976.

His 1969 book Black Theology and Black Power provided a new way to comprehensively define the distinctiveness of theology in the black church. His message was that Black Power, defined as black people asserting the humanity that white supremacy denied, was the gospel in America. Jesus came to liberate the oppressed, advocating the same thing as Black Power. He argued that white American churches preached a gospel based on white supremacy, antithetical to the gospel of Jesus. Cone's work was influential from the time of the book's publication, and his work remains influential today. His work has been both used and critiqued inside and outside the African-American theological community. He was the Charles Augustus Briggs Distinguished Professor of Systematic Theology at Union Theological Seminary until his death. Life and career Cone was born on August 5, 1938, in Fordyce, Arkansas, and grew up in the racially segregated town of Bearden, Arkansas. He and his family attended Macedonia African Methodist Episcopal Church. He attended Shorter College (1954‚Äì1956), a small AME Church junior college, before receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from Philander Smith College in 1958, where he was mentored by James and Alice Boyack. In his 2018 memoir Said I Wasn't Gonna Tell Nobody, Cone wrote that they were the first whites he met who respected his humanity. Although he had decided against parish ministry, their advice led him to obtain a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Garrett‚ÄìEvangelical Theological Seminary in 1961, and Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees from Northwestern University in 1963 and 1965, respectively. He was shocked to learn that most northern whites would not treat him with respect like the Boyacks. Yet he was excited to learn of unfamiliar theologians, controversies and biblical study methodologies. At the urging of and with support from the white theologian William Hordern at Garrett he applied and gained acceptance into the doctoral program in theology. He taught theology and religion at Philander Smith College, Adrian College, and beginning in 1970 at Union Theological Seminary in New York City, where he was awarded the distinguished Charles A. Briggs Chair in systematic theology in 1977. In 2018, he was elected as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Cone and his wife, Rose Hampton, married in 1958 and divorced in 1977. They had two sons, Micheal and Charles, and two daughters, Krystal and Robynn. In 1979, Cone married Sondra Gibson, who died in 1983. He died on April 28, 2018. Theology=Hermeneutics Cone wrote, \\"Exodus, prophets and Jesus‚Äîthese three‚Äîdefined the meaning of liberation in black theology.\\" The hermeneutic, or interpretive lens, for James Cone's theology starts with the experience of African Americans, and the theological questions he brings from his own life. He incorporates the powerful role of the black church in his life, as well as racism experienced by African Americans. For Cone, the theologians he studied in graduate school did not provide meaningful answers to his questions. This disparity became more apparent when he was teaching theology at Philander Smith College in Little Rock, Arkansas. Cone writes, \\"What could Karl Barth possibly mean for black students who had come from the cotton fields of Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, seeking to change the structure of their lives in a society that had defined black as non-being?\\" Cone's theology also received significant inspiration from a frustration with the black struggle for civil rights; he felt that black Christians in North America should not follow the \\"white Church\\", on the grounds that it was a willing part of the system that had oppressed black people. Accordingly, his theology was heavily influenced by Malcolm X and the Black Power movement. Martin Luther King Jr. was also an important influence; Cone describes King as a liberation theologian before the phrase existed. Cone wrote, \\"I was on a mission to transform self-loathing Negro Christians into black-loving revolutionary disciples of the Black Christ.\\" Nevertheless, \\"The black church, despite its failures, gives black people a sense of worth.\\" Methodology His methodology for answering the questions raised by the African-American experience is a return to scripture, and particularly to the liberative elements such as the Exodus-Sinai tradition, prophets and the life and teaching of Jesus. However, scripture is not the only source that shapes his theology. In response to criticism from other black theologians (including his brother, Cecil), Cone began to make greater use of resources native to the African-American Christian community for his theological work, including slave spirituals, the blues, and the writings of prominent African-American thinkers such as David Walker, Henry McNeal Turner, and W. E. B. Du Bois. His theology developed further in response to critiques by black women, leading Cone to consider gender issues more prominently and foster the development of womanist theology, and also in dialogue with Marxist analysis and the sociology of knowledge.; cf. . Contextual theology Cone's thought, along with Paul Tillich, stresses the idea that theology is not universal, but tied to specific historical contexts; he thus critiques the Western tradition of abstract theologizing by examining its social context. Cone formulates a theology of liberation from within the context of the black experience of oppression, interpreting the central kernel of the Gospels as Jesus' identification with the poor and oppressed, the resurrection as the ultimate act of liberation. As part of his theological analysis, Cone argues for God's own identification with \\"blackness\\": Despite his associations with the Black Power movement, however, Cone was not entirely focused on ethnicity: \\"Being black in America has little to do with skin color. Being black means that your heart, your soul, your mind, and your body are where the dispossessed are.\\" Cited in . In 1977, Cone wrote, with a still more universal vision: > I think the time has come for black theologians and black church people to > move beyond a mere reaction to white racism in America and begin to extend > our vision of a new socially constructed humanity in the whole inhabited > world ... For humanity is whole, and cannot be isolated into racial and > national groups. In his 1998 essay \\"White Theology Revisited\\", however, he retains his earlier strong critique of the white church and white man for ignoring or failing to address the problem of race. Early influences Cone credits his parents as being his most important early influences. His father had only a sixth- grade education but filed a lawsuit against the Bearden, Arkansas, school board despite threats on his life. White professors of religion and philosophy, James and Alice Boyack at Philander Smith College aided his belief in his own potential and deepened his interest in theodicy and black suffering. He found a mentor, advisor and influential teacher in Garrett scholar William E. Hordern. Professor Philip Watson motivated him to intensive remedial study of English composition. Classmate Lester B. Scherer was a great help in this. Scherer volunteered to edit manuscripts of Cone's early books while Cone's wife Rose typed them, yet Cone complained that neither understood him. Cone wrote his doctoral thesis on Karl Barth. A 1965 breakfast meeting with Benjamin Mays, president of Morehouse College in Atlanta, convinced him that teaching and scholarship were his true calling. The sociologist C. Eric Lincoln found publishers for his early books (Black Theology and Black Power and A Black Theology of Liberation) which sought to deconstruct mainstream Protestant theologians such as Barth, Niebuhr and Tillich while seeking to draw on the figures of the black church such as Richard Allen (founder in 1816 of the AME Church), black abolitionists ministers Henry Highland Garnet, Daniel Payne, and Henry McNeil Turner (\\"God is a Negro\\") and Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, James Baldwin, and other figures of the black power and black arts movement.  Criticism =Womanist critique Womanist theologians, such as Delores Williams, have critiqued Cone for both male- centered language and for not including the experiences of black women in his sources. Williams, in 1993, acknowledged in a footnote in her book Sisters in the Wilderness, that Cone has modified exclusive language for the reprinting of his works and acknowledged the issues with the previous language. However, she argues that he still does not use the experiences of African-American women in his method, and therefore still needs to deal with the sexism of his work. Other scholarly critiques Other critiques of Cone's theological positions have focused on the need to rely more heavily on sources reflecting black experience in general, on Cone's lack of emphasis on reconciliation within the context of liberation, and on his ideas of God and theodicy. (citing especially ; ; ; ). Charles H. Long and other founding members of the Society for the Study of Black Religion were critics of Cone's work. Long rejected black theology contending that theology was a western invention alien to black experience. Others objected to his endorsement of Black Power, lack of interest in reconciliation and concern with scoring academic points. Political commentary and controversy Aspects of Cone's theology and words for some people have been the subject of controversy in the political context of the 2008 US presidential campaign as Jeremiah Wright, at that time pastor of then-candidate Barack Obama, noted that he had been inspired by Cone's theology.. Some scholars of black theology noted that controversial quotes by Wright may not necessarily represent black theology. Cone responded to these alleged controversial comments by noting that he was generally writing about historic white churches and denominations that did nothing to oppose slavery and segregation rather than any white individual. Hoover Institute fellow Stanley Kurtz, in a political commentary in National Review, wrote: Educator After receiving his doctorate, Cone taught theology and religion at Philander Smith College and Adrian College. At the urging of his mentor, C. Eric Lincoln, Union Theological Seminary in New York City hired him as assistant professor in 1969. He remained there until his death in 2018 rising to assume an endowed full professorship. Cone made significant contributions to theological education in America. Prior to Cone's arrival in 1969, Union Theological Seminary had not accepted a black student into its doctoral program since its founding in 1836. During his career there, Cone supervised over 40 black doctoral students. These included Dwight Hopkins and some of the founders of womanist theology Delores Williams, Jacquelyn Grant, and Kelly Brown Douglas. He delivered countless lectures at other universities and conferences.

The Explorer offered a radical, \\"futuristic\\" body design, much like its siblings: the Flying V, which was released the same year, and the Moderne, which was designed in 1957 but not released until 1982. The Explorer was the final development of a prototype design that, years later, Gibson marketed under the name Futura. The Explorer's initial run was unsuccessful, and the model was discontinued in 1963. In 1976, Gibson began reissuing the Explorer after competitor Hamer Guitars had success selling similar designs. The Explorer became especially popular among the hard rock and heavy metal musicians of the 1970s and 1980s. First Explorers Gibson produced very few Explorers during the 1958 run of the original korina wood model. Because production records have been lost and shipping records are unclear, it is not known exactly how many were made, but the original run total has been estimated to be no more than 50. After the first few guitars, the Explorer had a long drooping headstock with the tuners placed in a straight line on one side (referred sometimes as \\"banana\\" and \\"hockey-stick\\"). This headstock design was incorporated by Grover Jackson, founder of Jackson Guitars and other electric guitar makers such as Kramer 20 years later, giving rise to the \\"pointy-headstock era\\" of guitars. However, the very earliest Explorers made between 1957 and spring 1958 featured an unusual \\"split\\"-shaped head with the tuners placed in a standard 3+3 arrangement, carried over from the Explorer prototype (better known as the Futura). The 1958‚Äì1959 korina Explorer is one of the most valuable production-model guitars on the market, ranked at #4 on the 2011 Top 25 published by Vintage Guitar, worth between $250,000 and $300,000. Only 22 were shipped in its first two years, 19 in 1958 and 3 in 1959; an unknown (small) number of leftover bodies were completed with nickel 1960s hardware and sold in 1963. 38 examples are presently known to exist. Explorer variations 50-Year Commemorative Explorer (DSX50) with rounded edges There have been several variants produced by Gibson. These include several smaller-bodied, more \\"user friendly\\" versions such as the X-Plorer Studio; the Matthias Jabs-designed Explorer 90 (named so because it was 90% the body size of a regular Explorer), and the Explorer Pro, introduced in 2007. In 1976 Gibson released a \\"Limited Edition\\" Explorer in mahogany with gold hardware.reverb.com In 1979 Gibson introduced the E2 model (also known as the Explorer II), featuring a 5-piece walnut/maple laminated construction and a contoured body. This model was discontinued after 1983,See Alan Greenwood, Gil Hembree, The Official Vintage Guitar Magazine Price Guide (2006 ed.), p. 85 (Hal Leonard Corp. 2005). but was partially returned as the \\"Thunderhorse\\", a signature model for comedian/musician Brendon Small, which was heavily based on the E2. From 1979 to 1983 Gibson produced the \\"Explorer II\\", not to be confused with the later E/2 Explorers. The distinction is that the Explorer- II/E-II has a straight edge body with cream binding. These E-II's are made with a mahogany back and figured/flamed maple tops in \\"burst\\" colors, namely \\"cherry-burst\\" and \\"Tobacco burst\\". They did not come in clear or solid colored finishes. Also, they have the TP6 tail-piece, gold hardware, and \\"velvet brick\\" or \\"dirty fingers\\" pickups, cream color body binding, with a black pickguard and 3 knobs in a row. The necks have ebony fretboards. Those items together distinguish an Explorer II from the later E/2. For the E/2 Explorer, Gibson optioned them with various different parts. The biggest difference was the curved/contoured body. Some came with \\"dirty fingers\\" pickups where some are cream and black colored (Zebra) or all black. Most had the standard stop-bar tailpiece, but some E/2's did come with a TP6 tailpiece. The E/2 was also offered in burst colors and clear finishes, whereas the E-II did not come in clear finishes. Gibson also produced a range of Explorer models between 1981 and 1984 with high-output \\"dirty fingers\\" pickups, maple neck and body, and a bound figured maple top available in natural, cherry sunburst, or vintage (tobacco) sunburst finishes. These were alternately named E/2, Explorer CMT, or The Explorer.id. They could be equipped from the factory with either a standard tune-o-matic bridge/stopbar tailpiece or a Kahler tremolo. From 1984 to 1987 the standard Explorer's body wood varied between mahogany and alder. The neck wood would vary between maple and mahogany and the fretboard wood varied between Indian rosewood and ebony. Other additions to this model included rear-loaded pickup cavities, no pickguard, and control knobs arranged in a triangle pattern (rather than a straight line as on the original model). In 1984 and 1985 Gibson produced the Explorer III, with three single-coil P-90 pickups and an alder body, as well as the Designer Series Explorer (and Flying V), which had factory-painted graphics in geometric and \\"Artist Original\\" designs. In 1998 Gibson introduced an Explorer in its \\"Gothic\\" line, which featured Gibson's guitars (including the Explorer, Flying V, SG, and Les Paul) in matte black finishes. Several variants are also produced by Epiphone Gibson's lower-cost, non-US manufacturer. These include a model produced in korina wood and Epiphone's own \\"Goth\\" model, available with a stop-tail or Floyd Rose locking tremolo bridge. Epiphone also produced an Explorer Bass in ebony black and velvet natural finishes with two humbucking pickups and a 34\\"-scale 22-fret dark rosewood fingerboard. The Explorer Bass employs a set-neck design rather than the bolted-neck construction used in the Epiphone version of the Gibson Thunderbird. (Gibson produced some 32\\"-scale Explorer basses in the 1980s, including one model that featured a futuristic piezo pickup in place of the traditional pickups found on the other models) In 2001 Gibson produced limited editions of Eric Clapton's modified 1958 Explorer, the Explorer Clapton Cut, featuring a shortened bass bout that allows more comfortable arm positioning and the Explorer Split Headstock, a faithful recreation of the original 1958 korina Explorer with the \\"forked\\" headstock found only on the very earliest examples.. In 2003 Gibson Guitars produced limited editions of Lynyrd Skynyrd guitarist Allen Collins's Gibson Explorer. The guitar is made of African limba wood and features an aged finish, Maestro vibrola, and classic humbucking pickups In 2008 Gibson released two new versions of the guitar, the first of which was the \\"50-Year Commemorative Explorer\\". This version features a solid mahogany body with AA- grade maple top, and the body style is the so-called \\"new retro Explorer\\", which has rounded edges. The second is called the \\"Reverse Explorer\\" due to its inverted body style. The reverse model features a carbon fibre-like pickguard and inlays as well as a McCarty-era inspired headstock. Only a limited run of 1000 of each model were built for the Guitar of the Month feature. In the same year Gibson also released the Robot Explorer, an Explorer version of the Gibson Robot Guitar together with a similar version of the Flying V featuring custom red metallic nitrocellulose finish, ebony fingerboard with white lining and trapezoid inlays, and lacking a pickguard. Production of this guitar was discontinued in 2008. In 2009 the company released two new versions of the guitar, the first of which is the Tribal Explorer. It features a Kahler-style tremolo and tribal designs and lacks a pickguard. The final new 2009 model is the Holy Explorer, designed as a counterpart to the Holy V, with numerous notches cut through the body of the guitar. After creating Matt Heafy of Trivium a white seven-string Explorer, Gibson released a statement that they would make a regular production version. It has many classic characteristics such as a rosewood fretboard, 22 frets, 24.75 scale length and a 12\\" radius while acquiring some more metal-oriented hardware and styling with the addition of active EMG pickups (81-7 bridge & 707 neck), and no fretmarkers on the fretboard. Although thought to be a staple in the Gibson lineup, the Explorer was discontinued and brought back multiple times in the late 2000s, along with the Flying V. In 2014 a limited edition 120th Anniversary model, with a special 12th-fret inlay and neck binding, was made available. In 2016 the Explorer was brought back into the standard lineup. Other makers Greco Explorer (EX-800) Hamer Guitars created a tribute to the Explorer in 1974 called the Hamer \\"Standard\\". This model typically differed from the original Explorer in that it had no pickguard and a mahogany body with a highly figured maple top in a cherry sunburst finish, though custom finishes were also available. Gaining popularity with the hard rock musicians of the day, including Rick Nielsen, Hamer's success led the way for other copies and was partly responsible for prompting Gibson's own decision to reissue the Explorer. Jackson Guitars (now a subsidiary of Fender) was sued by Gibson for their line of Kelly guitars, which are very similar to the Explorer. The Kelly was sleeker and lighter, with basically the same shape but with beveled edges. High-end guitar company Alembic Inc produced the Exploiter bass guitars for the late John Entwistle of the Who. These basses had the body shape of the Explorer with either a cone- or V-shaped headstock. The Exploiter is different in that the edges are rounded over and the lower bout cuts more deeply into the body than an Explorer. After Entwistle's death, Alembic released the \\"Spyder\\" based on John's custom basses, with production limited to 50 guitars. Warwick also produces the \\"Stryker\\" basses, based on the custom Explorer-style basses. Dean Guitars produced a John Entwistle Spyder Signature Bass in 2013, limited to 25 US models and a low-cost Korean import series. Ibanez introduced the Destroyer model in the 1970s, with a korina-coloured Japanese Sen body that closely resembled the original 1958 Explorer. In about 1981 Ibanez changed the shape of the Destroyer body. Although the new Destroyer II model was still clearly inspired by Gibson's original Explorer design, the body lines were modified, most notably around the treble \\"horn\\" and the rear edge, and the headstock was changed to a slight variation of the traditional Ibanez headstock shape, no longer resembling Gibson's \\"hockey stick\\" shape. Other guitars similar to the Explorer include the ESP EX Dean Guitars' Z, Greco guitars' Explorer, Aria Pro II, Kramer's Condor, Peavey's Rotor series, Rondo Music's Douglas Halo and Agile Ghost,rondomusic.com Gordon-Smith's Explorer, Chapman's Ghost Fret, and the Cort Effector (an Explorer version with built-in effects, but no pickup toggle switch). Gibson owns for the mark EXPLORER in connection with guitars. Gibson also owns for the Explorer's headstock design, and for the Explorer's body shape design. However, the enforceability of the latter two design trademarks is uncertain in light of Gibson's unsuccessful lawsuit against PRS Guitars for allegedly infringing Gibson's Les Paul shape. In 2005 the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ordered summary judgment against Gibson in that action, on the grounds that there was no evidence to support a finding of likelihood of confusion. cert. denied, .

The Large Plasma Device (often stylized as LArge Plasma Device or LAPD) is an experimental physics device located at UCLA. It is designed as a general purpose laboratory for experimental plasma physics research. The device began operation in 1991 and was upgraded in 2001 to its current version. The modern LAPD is operated as the primary device for a national user facility, the Basic Plasma Science Facility (or BaPSF), which is supported by the US Department of Energy, Fusion Energy Sciences and the National Science Foundation. Half of the operation time of the device is available to scientists at other institutions and facilities who can compete for time through a yearly solicitation.  History  The first version of the LAPD was a 10 meter long device constructed by a team led by Walter Gekelman in 1991. The construction took 3.5 years to complete and was funded by the Office of Naval Research (ONR). A major upgrade to a 20 meter version was funded by ONR and an NSF Major Research Instrumentation award in 1999. Following the completion of that major upgrade, the award of a $4.8 million grant by the US Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation in 2001 enabled the creation of the Basic Plasma Science Facility and the operation of the LAPD as part of this national user facility. Gekelman was director of the facility until 2016, when Troy Carter became BaPSF director.  Machine overview  Photo taken through an end port with the plasma off, showing the thermionic cathode. The LAPD is a linear pulsed-discharge device operated at a high (1 Hz) repetition rate, producing a strongly magnetized background plasma which is physically large enough to support Alfv√©n waves. Plasma is produced from a barium oxide (BaO) cathode- anode discharge at one end of a 20-meter long, 1 meter diameter cylindrical vacuum vessel (diagram). The resulting plasma column is roughly 16.5 meters long and 60 cm in diameter. The background magnetic field, produced by a series of large electromagnets surrounding the chamber, can be varied from 400 gauss to 2.5 kilogauss (40 to 250 mT).  Plasma parameters  Because the LAPD is a general-purpose research device, the plasma parameters are carefully selected to make diagnostics simple without the problems associated with hotter (e.g. fusion-level) plasmas, while still providing a useful environment in which to do research. The typical operational parameters are: * Density: n = 1‚Äì4 \\\\times1012 cm‚àí3 * Temperature: Te = 6 eV, Ti = 1 eV * Background field: B = 400‚Äì2500 gauss (40‚Äì250 mT) In principle, a plasma may be generated from any kind of gas, but inert gases are typically used to prevent the plasma from destroying the coating on the barium oxide cathode. Examples of gases used are helium, argon, nitrogen and neon. Hydrogen is sometimes used for short periods of time. Multiple gases can also be mixed in varying ratios within the chamber to produce multi-species plasmas. At these parameters, the ion Larmor radius is a few millimeters, and the Debye length is tens of micrometres. Importantly, it also implies that the Alfv√©n wavelength is a few meters, and in fact shear Alfv√©n waves are routinely observed in the LAPD. This is the main reason for the 20-meter length of the device.  Plasma sources  The main source of plasma within the LAPD is produced via discharge from the barium oxide (BaO) coated cathode, which emits electrons via thermionic emission. The cathode is located near the end of the LAPD and is made from a thin nickel sheet, uniformly heated to roughly 900 ¬∞C. The circuit is closed by a molybdenum mesh anode a short distance away. Typical discharge currents are in the range of 3-8 kiloamperes at 60-90 volts, supplied by a custom- designed transistor switch backed by a 4-farad capacitor bank. A secondary cathode source made of lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6) was developed in 2010 to provide a hotter and denser plasma when required. It consists of four square tiles joined to form a 20 \\\\times20 cm2 area and is located at the other end of the LAPD. The circuit is also closed by a molybdenum mesh anode, which may be placed further down the machine, and is slightly smaller in size to the one used to close the BaO cathode source. The LaB6 cathode is typically heated to temperatures above 1750 ¬∞C by a graphite heater, and produces discharge currents of 2.2 kiloamperes at 150 volts. The plasma in the LAPD is usually pulsed at 1 Hz, with the background BaO source on for 10-20 milliseconds at a time. If the LaB6 source is being utilized, it typically discharges together BaO cathode, but for a shorter period of time (about 5‚Äì8 ms) nearing the end of each discharge cycle. The use of an oxide-cathode plasma source, along with a well-designed transistor switch for the discharge, allows for a plasma environment which is extremely reproducible shot-to-shot. One interesting aspect of the BaO plasma source is its ability to act as an \\"Alfv√©n Maser\\", a source of large-amplitude, coherent shear Alfv√©n waves. The resonant cavity is formed by the highly reflective nickel cathode and the semitransparent grid anode. Since the source is located at the end of the solenoid which generates the main LAPD background field, there is a gradient in the magnetic field within the cavity. As shear waves do not propagate above the ion cyclotron frequency, the practical effect of this is to act as a filter on the modes which may be excited. Maser activity occurs spontaneously at certain combinations of magnetic field strength and discharge current, and in practice may be activated (or avoided) by the machine user.  Diagnostic access and probes = Probes  The main diagnostic is the movable probe. The relatively low electron temperature makes probe construction straightforward and does not require the use of exotic materials. Most probes are constructed in-house within the facility and include magnetic field probes, Langmuir probes, Mach probes (to measure flow), electric dipole probes and many others. Standard probe design also allows external users to bring their own diagnostics with them, if they desire. Each probe is inserted through its own vacuum interlock, which allows probes to be added and removed while the device is in operation. A 1 Hz rep-rate, coupled with the high reproducibility of the background plasma, allows the rapid collection of enormous datasets. An experiment on LAPD is typically designed to be repeated once per second, for as many hours or days as is necessary to assemble a complete set of observations. This makes it possible to diagnose experiments using a small number of movable probes, in contrast to the large probe arrays used in many other devices. The entire length of the device is fitted with \\"ball joints,\\" vacuum-tight angular couplings (invented by a LAPD staff member) which allow probes to be inserted and rotated, both vertically and horizontally. In practice, these are used in conjunction with computer-controlled motorized probe drives to sample \\"planes\\" (vertical cross-sections) of the background plasma with whatever probe is desired. Since the only limitation on the amount of data to be taken (number of points in the plane) is the amount of time spent recording shots at 1 Hz, it is possible to assemble large volumetric datasets consisting of many planes at different axial locations. Visualizations composed from such volumetric measurements can be seen at the LAPD gallery. Including the ball joints, there are a total of 450 access ports on the machine, some of which are fitted with windows for optical or microwave observation.  Other diagnostics  A variety of other diagnostics are also available at the LAPD to complement probe measurements. These include photodiodes, microwave interferometers, a high speed camera (3 ns/frame) and laser-induced fluorescence.

TSB is historically notable as the platform that released the first public versions of the game Star Trek. The system implements a dialect of BASIC as well as a rudimentary user account and program library that allows multiple people to use the system at once. The systems were a major force in the early-to-mid 1970s and generated a large number of programs. HP maintained a database of contributed-programs and customers could order them on punched tape for a nominal fee. Most BASICs of the 1970s trace their history to the original Dartmouth BASIC of the 1960s, but early versions of Dartmouth did not handle string variables and vendors added their own solutions. This led to two general styles; DEC introduced the \`MID/LEFT/RIGHT\` functions, while TSB used a system more akin to Algol 68, Matlab, Fortran 77 and other languages with array slicing. As microcomputers began to enter the market in the mid-1970s, many new BASICs appeared that based their parsers on DEC's or HP's syntax. Altair BASIC, the original version of what became Microsoft BASIC, was patterned on DEC's BASIC-PLUS. Others, including Apple's Integer BASIC, Atari BASIC and North Star BASIC were patterned on the HP style. This made conversions between these platforms somewhat difficult if string handling was encountered.  Nomenclature  The software was also known by its versioned name, tied to the hardware version on which it ran, such as HP 2000C Time- Shared BASIC and the operating system came in different varieties ‚Äî 2000A, 2000B, 2000C, High-Speed 2000C, 2000E, and 2000F. HP also referred to the language as \\"Access BASIC\\" in some publications. This matched the naming of the machines on which it ran, known as the \\"2000/Access\\" in some publications. This terminology appears to have been used only briefly when the platform was first launched.  Platform details  Except for the 2000A and 2000E systems, the system is implemented using a dual-processor architecture. One fully configured HP 2100-series processor is used for the execution of most of the system code and all of the user code, while a second, smaller HP 2100-series processor is used to handle the RS-232 serial lines through which the time- sharing users connected. Depending on the hardware configuration, the system supports up to 16 or up to 32 simultaneous remote users. The usual terminal for a TSB system was a Teletype Model 33 ASR and connected directly to the I/O processor or through a modem or acoustic coupler. Account names are a combination of one alphabetic character, followed by three decimal digits, e.g., B001. Privileged accounts started with the letter \\"A\\" and had some additional command and program storage capabilities. The superuser account is A000. This scheme allows up to 26,000 user accounts. During execution, user programs are swapped to a fixed head drive ‚Äî physically a disk, but operating like a magnetic drum. When not executing, user programs are stored on moving- head cartridge- or pack-loaded disk storage. Privileged users can also store programs on the much-faster drum. The hard drive was backed up to magnetic tape. Program and file names consist of a mix of up to six alphabetic characters (A-Z) and numbers (0-9). Programs are stored in a tokenized format, using the SAVE command. They can also be stored in a semi-compiled format, using the CSAVE command, which allows them to start quicker. Since the system was closely tied to the use of commonly available teleprinters, line endings in files consisted of the carriage return character (ASCII CR, 0D hexadecimal), followed by the linefeed character (ASCII LF, 0A hexadecimal).  Syntax  The language is a fairly standard implementation of BASIC, providing an integrated editing and runtime environment. Statements are analyzed for correct syntax as they are entered and then stored in tokenized form. Each BASIC statement has to be on a uniquely numbered line, e.g. 10 PRINT \\"HELLO WORLD\\" Line numbers are mandatory, and statements are automatically placed in ascending numeric sequence. TSB lines can contain one statement, chaining multiple statements with the colon as in MS BASIC is not supported. Multiple variable assignments are allowed, e.g., 20 LET A=B=C=42. As in most versions of BASIC, use of the word \\"LET\\" was optional. In the earliest version (2000A), the language supported the following features.HP 2000A - User's Guide, August 1969 Part Number 02000-90002, .

By default, they are allocated one character in memory, and if a string of longer length is needed, they have to be \`DIM\`entioned before use. For instance, DIM A$[10] will set up a string that can hold a maximum of 10 characters. The maximum length of a string in TSB is 72 characters. Substrings within strings are accessed using a \\"slicing\\" notation: A$(L,R) or A$[L,R], where the substring begins with the leftmost character specified by the index L and continues to the rightmost character specified by the index R, or the A$[L] form where the substring starts at the leftmost character specified by the index L and continues to the end of the string. TSB accepts () or [] interchangeably. Array and substring indices start with 1. This is in sharp contrast to BASICs following the DEC pattern that use functions such as \`LEFT$()\`, \`MID$()\`, and \`RIGHT$()\` to access substrings, although ANSI BASIC continues to use a similar substring syntax to that introduced by Hewlett- Packard. HP's notation can also be used on the destination side of a LET or INPUT statement to modify part of an existing string value, for example 100 A$[3,5]=\\"XYZ\\" or 120 B$[3]=\\"CHANGE ALL BUT FIRST TWO CHARS\\", which cannot be done with early implementations of LEFT/MID/RIGHT. The main advantage to this style of string access is that it eliminates the need for complex memory management that is otherwise required when string lengths change. MS BASIC had a lengthy library to handle the compression of memory by removing dead space in the string heap when the system ran out of memory. It was also notoriously slow, and was modified several times over its lifetime in order to improve performance or fixe bugs. The downside to the TSB style is that the string always takes up the full amount of DIMed space even if the string inside is empty, and simple tasks like concatenation can potentially overflow the string unless it was set to a large size to begin with. Later versions of Dartmouth BASIC did include string variables, based on the same pattern found in BASIC- PLUS and MS BASIC. However, this version did not use the LEFT/MID/RIGHT functions for manipulating strings, but instead used the \`CHANGE\` command which converted the string to and from equivalent ASCII values. HP included identical functionality, changing only the name to \`CONVERT\`. Additionally, one could use the single-quote to convert a numeric constant to an ASCII character, allowing one to build up a string in parts; \`A$='23 '64 '49 \\"DEF\\"\` produced the string \\"ABCDEF\\", without the need for the \`CHR$()\` function.  MAT commands  Later versions of Dartmouth BASIC included a suite of \`MAT\` commands that allowed operations on entire arrays (matrices) with a single statement. These were also available in later versions of TSB. In their simplest form, the \`MAT\` is used like an alternate form of \`LET\`, applying an expression to all the elements in an array. For instance: 100 DIM A(20),B(20) ... 200 MAT A=A+B Will add the value of every value in B to every entry in A, in the same fashion as: 100 DIM A(20),B(20) ... 200 FOR I=1 TO 20 210 A[I]=A[I]+B[I] 220 NEXT I As well as making the code shorter and more obvious, these commands also have the advantage of being highly optimized, easily outperforming the use of FOR/NEXT. Additional functions and statements modify \`PRINT\` and \`INPUT\`, invert arrays, and build identity matrixes and such in a single statement.  Other differences  TSB also includes a number of more minor differences with other dialects. Among the most important are: * \`#\` is an optional form of the not-equal comparison, identical to \`<>\` * computed-goto using the \`ON...GOTO/GOSUB\` syntax is not supported. Instead, the \`GOTO expression OF 1,2,3...\` performs the same function by picking a line number from the list based on its ordinal position. For instance, GOTO 1 OF 10,20,30 will always go to line 10, whereas GOSUB A OF 100,200,300 will branch to different lines if the value of A is 1, 2 or 3. * Boolean and relational operators can be used in any mathematical expression, returning 0 for false or 1 for true, which was unusual for BASIC languages of that time, but popular in languages like C. For instance, IF C+D THEN 1600 will branch to line 1600 if either C or D are greater than zero, because the expression \`C+D\` will evaluate to 'true' in the \`IF\`. If C and D are both zero, the \`IF\` will evaluate it to 'false' and the branch will not be taken. * TSB includes \`ENTER\`, a variation on the standard \`INPUT\` statement that continues after a time limit is reached. \`ENTER\` has three inputs, a time limit in seconds, a return variable containing the actual time elapsed (or a status code), and then finally the user input. For instance, ENTER 15,T,A$[1,1] will wait 15 seconds for the user to type in a single character. T will contain the actual time they took, -256 if the timer expired, or -257 or -258 to indicate problems with the terminal. * When printing string constants (literals), semicolons are not needed within the line. For instance, PRINT \\"THE NUMBER IS\\"A\\", TRY A LARGER VALUE.\\" does not require semicolons between the string constants and the variable A. Some other BASICs, including MS, also supported this syntax. Others, like Atari or Integer, did not. * Commas in \`PRINT\` use tab stops very 15 characters, leaving 12 at the end of the line to total 72. * The \`LIN\` function operates as a vertical counterpart to \`TAB\`. LIN(3) will insert three carriage returns, potentially on the existing line if a trailing semicolon or comma was active, while the special-case LIN(-1) will always advance to the next line. Integer BASIC had a similar feature, called VTAB.

He outlined a system of Stoic philosophy that was, in many ways, closer to earlier Cynic philosophy. He rejected the logical and physical sides of philosophy endorsed by Zeno and emphasized ethics. Although agreeing with Zeno that Virtue was the supreme good, he rejected the idea that morally indifferent things such as health and wealth could be ranked according to whether they are naturally preferred. An important philosopher in his day, his views were eventually marginalized by Zeno's successors. Life Aristo, son of Miltiades, was born on the island of Chios sometime around 300 BC.His date of birth is uncertain. He attended lectures by Zeno (born 333 BC, lectured between c. 302-264), and also became his most significant Stoic rival. He also attended lectures by Polemo (died 270/269 BC). 290 BC is the latest we can say he was born, but the late 4th century is quite probable. He came to Athens where he attended the lectures of Zeno of Citium, and also, for a time, the lectures of Polemo,. (the head of the Academy from 314 to 269). Although he was a member of Zeno's circle he soon departed from Zeno's teachings, largely rejecting the two non-ethical parts of Stoic philosophy ‚Äì physics and logic ‚Äì endorsed by Zeno. A man of persuasive eloquence, Aristo was such a good speaker that he was called the Siren. He was also called Phalanthus, from his baldness. He set up his own school in the Cynosarges gymnasium. (a place associated with Cynic philosophy) and attracted many pupils, so much so that when he was accused of exposing the dignity of philosophy by his freedom to all-comers, he answered, that \\"he wished that Nature had given understanding to wild beasts, that they too might be capable of being his hearers.\\"Plutarch, Lives: That a Philosopher Ought to Converse with Great Men. His followers called themselves Aristonians and included the scientist EratosthenesAthenaeus, Deipnosophists, Book VII. and the Stoics: Apollophanes, Diphilus, and Miltiades. Aristo engaged in much debate with Arcesilaus, the leader of the Academy, defending Stoic epistemology against Arcesilaus's skeptical views. On one occasion he accused Arcesilaus of being: \\"Plato the head of him, Pyrrho the tail, midway Diodorus\\".; and Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism. meaning that Arcesilaus presented himself as a Platonist, the substance of what he taught was the dialectics of Diodorus, but his actual philosophy was that of Pyrrhonism.\\"Arcesilaus ... does indeed seem to me to share the Pyrrhonean arguments, so that his Way is almost the same as ours.... he made use of the dialectic of Diodorus, but he was an outwardly Platonist.\\" Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism Book I, Chapter 33. In his old age, he reportedly lapsed from the Stoic ideal and indulged in pleasure. \\"Eratosthenes the Cyrenean ... in his treatise which is entitled Ariston, represents his master as subsequently being much addicted to luxury, speaking as follows: \\"And before now, I have at times discovered him breaking down, as it were, the partition wall between pleasure and virtue, and appearing on the side of pleasure.\\" And Apollophanes (and he was an acquaintance of Ariston), in his Ariston (for he also wrote a book with that title), shows the way in which his master was addicted to pleasure.\\" It is not known when he died,He was a vigorous opponent of Arcesilaus (head of the Academy from 265 to 241) and he also taught Eratosthenes (born 276), so he was presumably alive in the 250's and perhaps beyond. but he is supposed to have died from sunstroke on account of his baldness.. Philosophy Zeno divided philosophy into three parts: Logic (which was a very wide subject including rhetoric, grammar, and the theories of perception and thought); Physics (including not just science, but the divine nature of the universe as well); and Ethics, the end goal of which was to achieve happiness through the right way of living according to Nature. It is impossible to describe in full Aristo's philosophical system because none of his writings survived intact, but from the fragments preserved by later writers, it is clear that Aristo was heavily influenced by earlier Cynic philosophy: Logic Aristo regarded Logic as unimportant, saying that it had nothing to do with us. \\"Dialectic reasonings,\\" he said, \\"were like cobwebs, artificially constructed, but otherwise useless.\\" It is unlikely that he rejected all Logic,\\"Crude sentences of the form 'x rejects logic' are unsatisfying, ... it is one thing to decline to study the subject of logic, and quite another to decline to produce arguments. No ancient philosopher is accused of abjuring reason.\\" and it is notable that Zeno, too, compared the skills of dialecticians \\"to right measures that do not measure wheat or anything else worthwhile but chaff and dung.\\"Stobaeus, 2.22, 12-15. According to Stephen Menn, Aristo recognized the need to add somehow disposed in relation to something to the Stoic Categories. Physics Aristo also rejected Physics, saying that it was beyond us. This is reflected in his views concerning God: > Aristo holds that no form of God is conceivable, and denies him sensation, > and is in a state of complete uncertainty as to whether he is, or is not, > animate.Cicero, [De Natura Deorum (On the Nature of the Gods)], 1, 14. This was in marked opposition to Zeno to whom \\"the universe was animate and possessed of reason.\\"Cicero, De Natura Deorum (On the Nature of the Gods), 2, 8. He did, however, agree with Zeno that Nature was comprehensible, arguing against the Academics. He once asked an Academic \\"Do you not even see the man who is sitting next to you?\\", and when the Academic replied, \\"I do not,\\" Aristo said: \\"Who then has blinded you; who has robbed you of your eyes?\\". Ethics For Aristo, Ethics was the only true branch of philosophy, but he also limited this category, removing its practical side: advice concerning individual actions was largely useless: > He holds that it does not sink into the mind, having in it nothing but old > wives' precepts, and that the greatest benefit is derived from the actual > dogmas of philosophy and from the definition of the Supreme Good. When a man > has gained a complete understanding of this definition and has thoroughly > learned it, he can frame for himself a precept directing what is to be done > in a given case.Seneca, Epistles, 94. 2. For Aristo, only the sage makes flawless decisions and does not need advice, for everybody else with clouded minds, advice is ineffective: > For precepts will be of no avail while the mind is clouded with error; only > when the cloud is dispersed will it be clear what one's duty is in each > case. Otherwise, you will merely be showing the sick man what he ought to do > if he were well, instead of making him well.Seneca, Epistles, 94. 5. The purpose of life was to seek the Supreme Good, and here Aristo set up a challenge to Zeno. While agreeing with Zeno that Virtue was the supreme good, he totally rejected the idea that external advantages (health, wealth, etc.), although morally \\"indifferent\\", could be ranked in terms of whether they are naturally preferred or not: > Aristo of Chios denied that health, and everything similar to it, is a > preferred indifferent. To call it a preferred indifferent is equivalent to > judging it a good, and different practically in name alone; For without > exception things indifferent as between virtue and vice have no difference > at all, nor are some of them preferred by nature while others are > dispreferred, but in the face of the different circumstances of the > occasions, neither those said to be preferred prove to be unconditionally > preferred, nor are those said to be dispreferred of necessity dispreferred; > For if healthy men had to serve a tyrant and be destroyed for this reason, > while the sick had to be released from the service and, therewith also, from > destruction, the wise man would rather choose sickness in this circumstance > than health.Sextus Empiricus, Against the Professors, 11. 64-7. Zeno would have agreed that there could be circumstances when one might choose illness for the good of the world, but for Zeno, health is a naturally preferred state; Aristo rejected this. For Aristo, not only are there times when illness might be preferred over health, (health cannot always be unconditionally preferred), but health is not even a natural advantage, and one can never assume that it is better than illness. Although the sage can (and often must) choose between various indifferent things, he should never make the error of assuming that they could be naturally preferred. For Zeno, the chief good was to live according to Nature; for Aristo, the chief good was: > to live in perfect indifference to all those things that are of an > intermediate character between virtue and vice; making not the slightest > difference between them, but regarding them all on a footing of equality. > For that the wise man resembles a good actor; who, whether he is filling the > part of Agamemnon or Thersites, will perform them both equally well. The highest good is thus to follow virtue as the supreme good, avoid vice as the supreme evil, and to live in a state of perfect indifference towards everything else.Seneca, Epistles, 94. 8. Aristo did, however, agree with Zeno on the unity of virtue, even if it is often labelled as different things: > Aristo made virtue one thing in its essence, and called it health; but in > what it is somehow related to, he made the virtues differentiated and > plural, just as if one wanted to call our vision in grasping light-colored > things light-sight, but dark-sight in grasping dark-colored ones. For virtue > in considering things to be done and not to be done is called wisdom, but it > is called temperance in bringing order to our appetites and defining what is > measured and timely in pleasures, and justice in busying itself with joint > enterprises and contracts with other people.Plutarch - On Moral Virtue, > 440e-441a. The problem remains of how one can achieve a virtuous state if one can not make rational choices between which things in life are preferred and dispreferred and has only an abstract goal of perfect virtue. Aristo left the question unanswered, and Cicero writing in the first century BC gave what has been the standard view of Aristo's philosophy ever since: > For if we maintained that all things were absolutely indifferent, the whole > of life would be thrown in confusion, as it is by Aristo, and no function or > task could be found for wisdom, since there would be absolutely no > distinction between the things that pertain to the conduct of life, and no > choice need be exercised among them.Cicero, De Finibus (On Ends) , 3. 15. Whether or not this view is correct,Thomas B√©natou√Øl has, for example, argued that for Aristo, uniform indifference was the consequence of, rather than the path to achieving perfect virtue. See the Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2007.04.64 Aristo clearly thought he was doing something more positive than playing the Cynic and trying to undermine the roots of the Stoic system: > He who has equipped himself for the whole of life does not need to be > advised concerning each separate item, because he is now trained to meet his > problem as a whole; for he knows not merely how he should live with his wife > or his son, but how he should live aright.Seneca, Epistles, 94. 3. Legacy Aristo came to be regarded as a marginal figure in the history of Stoicism, but in his day, he was an important philosopher whose lectures drew large crowds.. Eratosthenes, who lived in Athens as a young man, claimed that Aristo and Arcesilaus were the two most important philosophers of his age.Strabo, Geography, 1.2.2. But it was the more moderate Zeno, not the radical Aristo, whose views would win out. Chrysippus, (head of the Stoic school from c. 232 to c. 206 BC), systemized Stoicism along the lines set down by Zeno, and in doing so, was forced to repeatedly attack Aristo: > To maintain that the only Good is Moral Worth is to do away with the care of > one's health, the management of one's estate, participation in politics, the > conduct of affairs, the duties of life; nay, to abandon that Moral Worth > itself, which according to you is the be-all and the end-all of existence; > objections that were urged most earnestly against Aristo by > Chrysippus.Cicero, De Finibus (On Ends) , 4. 25. And yet, Aristo never quite went away, as can be seen by the repeated references to his views by later writers. By outlining a version of Stoicism rooted in Cynic philosophy, he provided fruitful food for thought for both the supporters and the opponents of Stoicism ever since.

The Cougar was a twin-engine development of the Gulfstream American AA-5B Tiger and traces its lineage to the AA-1 Yankee Clipper and the Bede BD-1.  Development  As a development of the company's single-engined designs, Grumman American developed a twin-engined version, designated the GA-7 which it named the Cougar, in keeping with the existing Lynx, Cheetah and Tiger names for aircraft in the company's line. The prototype Cougar with two Lycoming O-320 engines first flew on the 29 December 1974. The prototype had a sliding canopy but this was soon changed to a starboard side door on the production aircraft. With other rework required the production prototype did not fly until 14 January 1977.Wood, Derek: Jane's World Aircraft Recognition Handbook, page 233. Jane's Publishing Company, 1982. Before production started the company was taken over on 1 September 1978 by American Jet Industries, who changed the company name to Gulfstream American. Production of the Cougar ran for only two model years, 1978 and 1979, before production was halted. Just 115 Cougars were delivered. In 1995 the type certificate for the GA-7 was sold to SOCATA of France who intended to produce the aircraft as the TB 320 Tangara for the training market. It was also to develop a variant with two Lycoming O-360-A1G6 engines of each and a re-designed cockpit, it was designated the TB 360. The first Tangara was a modified Cougar, had engines and first flew in mid-1996. The complete Tangara prototype was also a converted Cougar and had the engines. It first flew in February 1997. After delays in getting the type certified SOCATA announced at the end of 1999 that it had delayed indefinitely plans to certify the type. On 23 May 2019 the type certifcate was transferred by SOCATA to the Cougar Aircraft Corporation in the United States.European Aviation Safety Agency Type Certificate 'Cougar Aircraft Corporation GA7 EASA.IM.A.381 dated 15 August 2019  Design  The Cougar is a twin-engined low-wing cantilever monoplane using a honeycomb and bonded metal construction that is the hallmark of the line since the BD-1. The prototype's single spar wing was upgraded to a double-spar configuration and this allowed a wet wing. The Cougar is powered by a pair of wing-mounted Lycoming O-320-D1D engines of .

He is best known as the former drummer for Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura, which he co-founded with his brother Max in 1984. Max left the band in 1996, and Cavalera himself would depart ten years later, making him the last original member of Sepultura to leave the band. The brothers have since reunited in the band Cavalera Conspiracy. He has played in the bands Nailbomb and Strife. As his hip-hop influences grew stronger he began to DJ. Cavalera is one half of DJ duo Mixhell, a project he founded with his wife Laima Leyton. Biography Cavalera started playing drums around 7 years old. He was into samba music as a child but, after watching Queen live in 1981 along with his brother Max, he started listening to rock music. When Sepultura was formed, Cavalera was the youngest member at the age of 13, his brother Max was 14 at the time. Sepultura was a big success and gave Cavalera an early start. On April 21, 1984, Cavalera played, for the first time, on a real drum kit, which was borrowed from Helinho of the band Overdose, that also played that night. After the band split with his brother Max (lead vocals/rhythm guitar) in 1996, their relationship underwent a crisis. In recent times their relationship has improved. Cavalera joined Max's current band Soulfly on stage at the 2006 tenth annual D-Low Memorial Show, to play the Sepultura songs \\"Roots Bloody Roots\\" and \\"Attitude\\". It was the first time the brothers had played together in ten years. In 2006, with the release of Dante XXI, he began spelling his name \\"Iggor,\\" preferring the way it looks. On January 13, 2006, it was announced that he was taking a break from the band due to the birth of his fourth child, initially leaving Sepultura temporarily. He later announced that he was quitting Sepultura due to \\"artistic incompatibility.\\" Sepultura replaced him with Jean Dolabella. Cavalera was scheduled to collaborate with underground hip hop artist Necro, on a project described by Necro as in the style of \\"old-school '80s thrash/death metal.\\" However, Necro mentioned later that the project will not go ahead. In 2008 he released the album Inflikted together with his brother Max in a project named Cavalera Conspiracy. He is credited as having made a guest appearance on Biohazard's 2001 release Uncivilization on the track \\"Gone\\". In 2012, Cavalera performed drums for the entire Strife album Witness A Rebirth, released via 6131 Records. In 2017, Cavalera performed drums for Soulwax on their album \\"From Deewee\\" and in their live tour, along with two other live drummers. In 2018, Cavalera formed the Noise music duo PET BRICK with Wayne Adams of Big Lad and Death Pedals Personal life Cavalera collects toys and football shirts and has many hobbies, including Brazilian jiu-jitsu, snowboarding, surfing, drawing and supporting Brazilian football club Palmeiras. He admires his father Graziano Cavalera as his role model. He has four children: Christian Bass Cavalera (b. November 7, 1996), Raissa Bass Cavalera (b. April 26, 2000), Iccaro Bass Cavalera (b. November 23, 2002), Antonio Leyton Cavalera (b. January 15, 2006) (the first with his current wife Laima Leyton) and a stepson Pedro Leyton Pereira. In 1996 he started the fashion label \\"Cavalera\\". His fashion label has faced controversy of its use of the Albanian flag as its logo. In 2020, a petition called for \\"Cavalera\\" to change it. He lives in London since 2013. Playing style Cavalera cites drummers Roger Taylor, Bill Ward, Dave Lombardo, Stewart Copeland and Mike Bordin among his major influences. In the early Sepultura albums his drumming was loud and fast, following the thrash metal style of the 80s. He mastered this style by 1987‚Äì1991 (with Schizophrenia, Beneath the Remains and Arise). His innovative style in the album Chaos A.D. brought tribal elements into the songs. One example of his contribution is the introduction of the song \\"Territory\\" (1993, Chaos A.D.). He further developed this style in the 1996 Roots album, adding more tribal elements to Sepultura's music. Throughout his career, Cavalera has been widely recognized as a hard-hitting drummer (acknowledged by producer Scott Burns during the recording of Beneath the Remains). In later years, Cavalera adopted a drumset conformation with upright toms and fewer cymbals, as seen in Live in S√£o Paulo. In reference to his work on the Sepultura album Nation, Allmusic wrote \\"Drummer Igor Cavalera's timing and tempo couldn't be more perfect as the adrenaline heightens until the album's intensity burns right through the speakers.\\"  Discography = with Sepultura  *Bestial Devastation (1985) *Morbid Visions (1986) *Schizophrenia (1987) *Beneath the Remains (1989) *Arise (1991) *Chaos A.D.

The Act concerned employment, training, education, harassment, the provision of goods and services, and the disposal of premises. The Gender Recognition Act 2004 and The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (Amendment) Regulations 2008 amended parts of this Act to apply to transsexual people. Other amendments were introduced by the Sex Discrimination Act 1986, the Employment Act 1989, the Equality Act 2006, and other legislation such as rulings by the European Court of Justice. The Act did not apply in Northern Ireland, however The Sex Discrimination Gender Reassignment Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1999 does. The Act was repealed in full by the Equality Act 2010. The Equal Opportunities commission The Act established the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) whose main duties were to work towards the elimination of discrimination, to promote equality of opportunity between sexes and to keep under review the workings of the Sex Discrimination Act and the Equal Pay Act 1970. The EOC helped individuals bring cases to Employment Tribunals and to the courts. The EOC is now subsumed into the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). ‚ÄòSex Discrimination‚Äô, as it is referred to in employment law, was introduced in the 1970s alongside equal pay legislation. Whilst in recent years we have seen an increase in gender pay gap reporting, it is important however to recognize that these are workplace-based and relate solely to comparing employees in the same, similar or equivalent roles in the workplace.

Geographical position Like the close village of Hinterm√ºhle, Vorderm√ºhle has its own water supply. Villages near Vorderm√ºhle are Neeskotten, Klemenseichen, Wingenbach and Berrenberg. Three rivers run through this village: the \\"Wingenbacher Siefen\\", the \\"St√ºttemer Siefen\\" and the \\"Dierdorfer Siefen\\". All of them finally flow into the \\"Lindlarer S√ºlz\\". The country lane L302 from Wipperf√ºrth to the town of Frielingsdorf (Lindlar) passes through the village. History The village was first mentioned in the year of 1548 as tho der Mollen. A simple translation of the village's name is \\"In front of the mill\\", which refers to the existence of a mill in this village. The chapel The chapel of Vorderm√ºhle was built in 1683. The population of the surrounding villages gather there in May to pray. In the year of 1843 the small chapel was destroyed; its owner, Peter Wilhelm Stege, r rebuilt the chapel. The new chapel was bigger, 22 feet long and 15 feet wide and had a small tower with a bell. The population of Vorderm√ºhle longed for the chapel's lustration in order to celebrate Mass in the chapel. It failed because the question of who paid the charges was unanswered. In 1845 Peter Wilhelm Steger and his family donated the chapel to the catholic parish in Wipperf√ºrth and announced together with Johann Peter Schnippering to care for the chapel. On May the 17th 1845 priest D√ºnner lustrated the chapel to the Virgin Mother. In 1857 a fire destroyed four houses and the chapel in Vorderm√ºhle. Again, Petr Wilhelm Steger rebuild the chapel with help of Johann Christian B√∂rsch. Two years later priest D√ºnner lustrated two small bells. The chapel was renovated in 1930. The expenses were paid by a collection in the school district of Vorderm√ºhle. Till 2004 the mass was celebrated every month in the chapel. A lack of priests in Wipperf√ºrth makes this no longer possible today. The Mill Today the former mill is a bakery with a water wheel. The old school The building of the former school is renovated and used as a tenement. Pupils from Vorderm√ºhle go to Agathaberg in order to attend a primary school.

It is an occlusive emollient, meaning that it restores the layer of oil on the surface of the skin to slow water loss. This gives its tendency to make the applied area sticky. Ingredients Diprobase contains no 'active ingredients'. It is made from a combination of liquid paraffin, white soft paraffin and water, as well as cetomacrogol and cetostearyl alcohol as emulsifying agents, chlorocresol as an antimicrobial preservative, phosphoric acid, sodium dihydrogenphosphate and sodium hydroxide. Effects Dry skin results from lack of water in the outer layer of skin cells (the stratum corneum). When this layer becomes dehydrated it loses its flexibility and becomes cracked, scaly and sometimes itchy. The stratum corneum contains natural water-holding substances that retain water seeping up from the deeper layers of the skin, and water is also normally retained in the stratum corneum by a surface film of natural oil (sebum) and broken-down skin cells, which slow down evaporation of water from the skin surface. Diprobase works by increasing that layer of oil. Manufacturer Diprobase is a British brand of the American pharmaceutical company Schering-Plough. Its trademark stems from the now older range of corticosteroids the company still manufactures; Diprosone and Diprosalic. The Dipro being suggestive of betamethasone dipropionate.

A hostile crowd gathered, shots were fired, and three people (two Turkish Cypriots and one Greek Cypriot) were killed. As the news spread, members of underground organizations began firing and taking hostages. North of Nicosia, Turkish forces occupied a strong position at St. Hilarion Castle, dominating the road to Kyrenia on the northern coast. The road became a principal combat area as both sides fought to control it. Much intercommunal fighting occurred in Nicosia along the line separating the Greek and Turkish quarters of the city (known later as the Green Line). Severe intercommunal fighting occurred in March and April 1964. When the worst of the fighting was over, Turkish Cypriots began moving from isolated rural areas and mixed villages into enclaves. Turkish Cypriots state that the hostilities forced such an amalgamation while the Greek Cypriots state that the Turkish Cypriots did so without any pressure from them, but rather by the Turkish Cypriot paramilitary organization TMT so that to apply uniformity. It is believed by progressive Cypriots that both events occurred. Before long, a substantial portion of the island's Turkish Cypriot population was crowded into the Turkish quarter of Nicosia and other enclaves, in tents and hastily constructed shacks. Slum conditions resulted from the serious overcrowding. Attempts of the Cypriot National Guard under control of General George Grivas, who claimed to be acting under a mandate given to Cyprus by the UN, to re- capture a beach-head at the Kokkina/Erenk√∂y enclave which the Turkish Cypriots claimed was their last link with the outside world but the Greek Cypriots feared would be used as a landing post for Turkish mainland forces, caused an intervention by the Turkish Airforce. On 8 ‚Äì 9 August, Turkey bombed the Tylliria area for two days, resulting in the death of 33 Greek Cypriots and 230 injuries. Pierre Oberling noted that according to official sources, the 1963‚Äì64 crisis resulted in the death of 364 Turkish Cypriots and 174 Greek Cypriots.Oberling, Pierre. The road to Bellapais (1982), Social Science Monographs, p.120: \\"According to official records, 364 Turkish Cypriots and 174 Greek Cypriots were killed during the 1963‚Äì1964 crisis.\\" 209 Turkish Cypriots and 41 Greeks were reported as missing. Nearly 25,000 Turkish Cypriots, about one sixth of the Turkish Cypriot population at that time, had been forced to leave their homes to live into enclaves.Daily Express 28 December 1963 Finally, more than 3000 Armenian ethnics who had been living in the areas of Nicosia that came under the control of Turkish paramilitaries were forced out of their homes. 1974: Coup d'Etat and the Turkish invasion With the coup d'√©tat of 21 April 1967, Greece entered a period under the rule of the Colonels' Junta. On 15 July 1974, the Republic of Cyprus government was overthrown by the Greek Cypriot national guard acting under orders from the Greek junta. The Greek junta installed an EOKA veteran and a member of the Cyprus Parliament, Nikos Sampson as the new president. The attempt to murder president Makarios failed, however, and he fled Cyprus with the help of the British army. On 20 July 1974, in response to the coup, Turkish troops landed near Kyrenia, forcing a narrow corridor to Nicosia within 2 days, until a ceasefire was negotiated on 22 July. On the second day of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus the Colonels' Junta collapsed. Karamanlis returned from Paris and formed his civilian Government. In Cyprus, Nikos Sampson resigned and Glafkos Clerides took over the presidency as acting president, according to the 1960 Constitution. In August of the same year, almost a month after the coup had dissolved the three guarantor powers, together with representatives of the two communities, met in Geneva. The Turkish Cypriots under Rauf Denkta≈ü demanded a federal state with 34% of the territory ceded to Turkish Cypriots. Glafkos Klerides ‚Äì the Greek Cypriot representative ‚Äì asked for 36 to 48 hours in order to consult with his superiors. While still in talks, a second Turkish invasion was launched on Cyprus. When a ceasefire was declared, more than 36% of the territory was occupied by Turkish forces. The ceasefire line of 1974 today still separates the two communities and is generally referred to as the Green Line (or the 'Atilla Line'), and also runs through Nicosia, making it the only divided capital in the world. The Turkish Army and the Greek side conducted policies ethnic cleansing in the territories that came under their respective control.1st Report of the European Commission of Human Rights; Turkey's intervention in Cyprus and aftermath (20 July 1974 ‚Äì 18 May 1976) 2nd Report of the European Commission of Human Rights; Turkey's intervention in Cyprus and aftermath (19 May 1976 to 10 February 1983) Turkey was found guilty by the European Commission of Human Rights for displacement of persons, deprivation of liberty, ill treatment, deprivation of life and deprivation of possessions.European Commission of Human Rights, \\"Report of the Commission to Applications 6780/74 and 6950/75\\" , Council of Europe, 1976, p. 160,161,162,163. The Turkish policy of violently forcing a third of the island's Greek population from their homes in the occupied North, preventing their return and settling Turks from the mainland there is considered an example of ethnic cleansing.Van Coufoudakis, Eugene T. Rossides, American Hellenic Institute Foundation, 2002, , , p. 236William Mallinson, Bill Mallinson, Cyprus: a modern history , I.B.Tauris, 2005, , , p. 147.Robert F. Holland, Britain and the revolt in Cyprus, 1954‚Äì1959, Oxford University Press, 1998, , In 1976 and again in 1983, the European Commission of Human Rights found Turkey guilty of repeated violations of the European Convention of Human Rights. Turkey has been condemned for preventing the return of Greek Cypriot refugees to their properties. The European Commission of Human Rights reports of 1976 and 1983 state the following: Enclaved Greek Cypriots in the Karpass Peninsula in 1975 were subjected by the Turks to violations of their human rights so that by 2001 when the European Court of Human Rights found Turkey guilty of the violation of 14 articles of the European Convention of Human Rights in its judgement of Cyprus v. Turkey (application no. 25781/94), less than 600 still remained. In the same judgement, Turkey was found guilty of violating the rights of the Turkish Cypriots by authorising the trial of civilians by a military court. The European commission of Human Rights with 12 votes against 1, accepted evidence from the Republic of Cyprus, concerning the rapes of various Greek-Cypriot women by Turkish soldiers and the torture of many Greek-Cypriot prisoners during the invasion of the island.European Commission of Human Rights, \\"Report of the Commission to Applications 6780/74 and 6950/75\\" , Council of Europe, 1976, p. 120,124. The high rate of rape resulted in the temporary permission of abortion in Cyprus by the conservative Cypriot Orthodox Church. According to Paul Sant Cassia, rape was used systematically to \\"soften\\" resistance and clear civilian areas through fear. Many of the atrocities were seen as revenge for the atrocities against Turkish Cypriots in 1963‚Äì64 and the massacres during the first invasion.Cassia, Bodies of Evidence, p. 55. In the Karpass Peninsula, a group of Turkish Cypriots, called a \\"death squad\\", reportedly chose young girls to rape and impregnated teenage girls. There were cases of rapes, which included gang rapes, of teenage girls by Turkish soldiers and Turkish Cypriot men in the peninsula, and one case involved the rape of an old Greek Cypriot man by a Turkish Cypriot. The man was reportedly identified by the victim and two other rapists were also arrested. Raped women were sometimes outcast from society. Greek Cypriot EOKA-B militants committed a massacre in the village of Tochni, where all men between the ages of 13 and 74 were found shot (Tochni massacre).narrative from William Hale Likewise other mass graves were exhumed in the villages of Aloa, Sandalaris and Maratha, containing 126 dead civilians, including women and children (Maratha, Santalaris and Aloda massacre). There is also evidence of the rape of Greek Cypriot women by Turkish soldiers.European Commission of Human Rights, \\"Report of the Commission to Applications 6780/74 and 6950/75\\" , Council of Europe, 1976, p. 120,124. Legal challenges In 1976 and in 1983 Cyprus challenged Turkey at the European Court of Human Rights over a number of issues, including missing civilian Greek Cypriots, of which Cyprus claimed there were at least 1491. The ECHR concluded that there was a presumption that Turkey had a responsibility for clarifying the fate of civilians last known to be under its control, but also that there was \\"no proof that any of the missing persons were killed in circumstances for which [Turkey] could be held responsible; nor did the Commission find any evidence to the effect that any of the persons taken into custody were still being detained or kept in servitude by [Turkey]\\".Cyprus v. Turkey, 25781/94, Council of Europe: European Court of Human Rights, 10 May 2001, available at unhcr.org A further 1994 case brought by Cyprus, on which judgement was made in 2001, concluded that Turkey continued to offer insufficient support in clarifying the fate of missing Cypriots. Another case is the book war crimes written by Andreas Parashos claiming at least 180 reported missings are fake and forged by Cyprus state, and 40 of them are already buried to the graves before 74, he also admittedParashos ? killing 100 Turkish Cypriot civilians Kƒ±brƒ±s harek√¢tƒ±nƒ±n faili me√ßhullerine fotoƒüraf kanƒ±tƒ± ‚Äì D√ºnya Haberleri.

A new case was brought in 2009, following comments by Turkish actor Atilla Olgac about committing war crimes during his service in Cyprus, although Olgac later retracted the remarks, saying he had been testing public reaction to a TV script.The Independent, 29 January 2009, Turkish TV actor faces war crimes charges In 2006, owing to the potential huge number of lawsuits against Turkey, the European Court of Human Rights called on Turkey in December to find \\"effective domestic remedies\\" for the mass displacement of Greek Cypriots. The result was a property commission established by the Turkish Cypriots purportedly offering right of return of Greek Cypriot properties so long as the property was unoccupied, or not in an area of military significance. A small number of applicants have received compensation. The Greek Cypriots have refused to recognise the commission as a proper means of redress, with some politicians going as far to suggest treason for those who accept.Turkish land offer rejected by Greeks. Washington Times (25 June 2006). The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that the property commission does provide an adequate domestic remedy.(ref: Demopoulos & Ors -v- Turkey 1 March 2010)  Notes Further reading * * See also * Cyprus dispute * Kokkina/Erenk√∂y * Loizidou v.

The company was formed in 1974 by banjoists Rick Shubb and Dave Coontz. Shubb capos remain a top- selling capo forty years after their invention. Shubb wanted to create a capo that would not make his instrument go out of tune, which has resulted in ongoing efforts to refine his invention. Capo design The Shubb Capo utilises an over-centre locking action, which is lever operated. The design includes a screw for adjusting the clamp's tightness, and has been described as \\"a turning point in modern capo design.\\" Shubb capos are available in variety of models to fit different types of guitars, banjos, dobros, and ukuleles. For example, there are Shubb Capos for Steel String Guitar which fit most acoustic and electric guitars; the Shubb Capos for Nylon String Guitar are designed for guitars with wide flat fretboards, etc. Furthermore, each model is available in different styles, namely Original (nickel-plated or plain, unplated brass), Capo Noir (black chrome) and Deluxe (stainless steel with improved roller design on the lever). The Shubb capo was introduced at the 1980 NAMM Show, and became a favorite on the Usenet acoustic guitar newsgroup. An advantage with using this type of capo is that it does not change the intonation in a way that makes the instrument difficult to tune, as it \\"mimics the grip of a human hand.\\" A disadvantage is that the rubber sleeve may wear, and may need to be replaced. The Shubb partial capos can be useful for playing fingerstyle guitar and for playing in alternate tunings.Reid, Harvey. A Careful Comparison of Shubb, Kyser Esus (3-string) Partial Capos.

A well-known example is the Arab Baath Socialist Party, established as an Arab nationalist and socialist party aspiring to pan-Arab political union. The party's central governing body, the National Command, included representatives from its organisations in all the Arab countries where Baathists had a significant presence. Each branch of the party, in turn, had a local governing body, the Regional Command, and although practical power became centred in the Syrian and Iraqi Regional Commands and the National Command of each faction assumed an essentially symbolic role, the party split in 1966, with different factions taking control in Syria and Iraq, each faction retained a pan-Arab structure. Another example of a transnational political party is Sinn F√©in, which has 7 Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom Parliament, and 37 Teachta√≠ D√°la in the Irish D√°il √âireann. Sinn F√©in also has 26 MLAs in the Northern Ireland Assembly. Some transnational organisations also have a party-political dimension. The best example of this is the European Union, in which groups of national political parties operate together when participating in EU institutions, especially the European Parliament, as European political parties, or \\"Europarties\\". However, Europarties are distinct from transnational political parties in that they do not operate at the national level. In a broad sense, global movements such as communism, socialism, and Islamism have transnational qualities, but in most such cases the party organization is separate in each country, with the transnational aspect being one more of consultatation and coordination, often through political internationals. One notable exception to this rule is the Progressive Labor Party (United States), which views proletarian internationalism as requiring that they set up party collectives all over the globe. Some Trotskyist parties behave similarly.

It was founded in April 1968 and raised considerable public attention in 1972 with its report The Limits to Growth. From 1970 to 1972 at MIT Meadows was director of the \\"Club of Rome Project on Predicament of mankind at MIT\\" which constructed the world model underlying that publication. The Limits to Growth The Limits to Growth is a 1972 book modeling the consequences of a rapidly growing world population and finite resource supplies, commissioned by the Club of Rome. Meadows coauthored the book with his wife Donella H. Meadows, J√∏rgen Randers, and William W. Behrens III. The book used the World3 model to simulateThe models were run on Dynamo, a simulation programming language. the consequence of interactions between the Earth's and human systems. Meadows led the team that developed this model. The book echoes some of the concerns and predictions of the Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus in An Essay on the Principle of Population (1798). The eventual purpose of The Limits to Growth was not to make specific predictions, but to explore how exponential growth interacts with finite resources. Because the size of resources is not known, only the general behavior can be explored.  The 30-year update  There has been a major cultural shift in the thinking about global processes in the last three decades of the 20th century. In a 2004 interview, Meadows explained: :\\"In 1972 it was inconceivable to most people that the physical impact of humanity's activities could ever grow large enough to alter basic natural processes of the globe. But now we routinely observe, acknowledge, and discuss the ozone hole, destruction of marine fisheries, climate change and other global problems.\\"Interview with Dennis L. Meadows , 2004. at euronatur.org. Retrieved October 20, 2009. In their 1972 publication Limits to Growth, their recommendations were focused on \\"how to slow growth\\". In the 2004 Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update, the message has changed. Meadows explained: \\"Now we must tell people how to manage an orderly reduction of their activities back down below the limits of the earth's resources.\\" In 2014, research at the University of Melbourne confirmed that the predictions from the book Limits to Growth were largely correct. Presently we are very close to tracking the \\"business-as-usual\\" scenario from the book.

Two or four players use solid paddles made of wood or composite materials to hit a perforated polymer ball, much like a wiffle ball, with 26-40 round holes, over a net. The sport shares features of other racquet sports: the dimensions and layout of a badminton court, and a net and rules somewhat similar to tennis, with several modifications. Pickleball was invented in the mid 1960s as a children's backyard game. In the United States and Canada, the game has exploded in popularity in senior citizen communities and nursing homes. History The game started during the summer of 1965 on Bainbridge Island, Washington, at the home of Joel Pritchard, who later served in Congress and as lieutenant governor. He and two of his friends, Bill Bell and Barney McCallum, returned from golf and found their families bored one Saturday afternoon. They attempted to set up badminton, but no one could find the shuttlecock. They improvised with a perforated plastic ball, lowered the badminton net, and fabricated paddles of plywood from a nearby shed. McCallum made the first paddles that were specifically for pickleball on his basement bandsaw. He tried several alternative paddles, but one he called ‚ÄúM2‚Äù became the paddle of choice for most players. In 1972, McCallum incorporated Pickle-Ball, Inc. and manufactured wooden paddles to help grow the sport. His son David McCallum now runs the business, which is headquartered in Kent, Washington. Official company website Some sources claim that the name \\"Pickleball\\" was derived from that of the Pritchard's family dog, Pickles, or from the term \\"pickle boat\\". According to Joan Pritchard, Joel Pritchard's wife, ‚ÄúThe name of the game became Pickle Ball, after I said it reminded me of the Pickle Boat in crew where oarsmen were chosen from the leftovers of other boats. Somehow the idea the name came from our dog Pickles was attached to the naming of the game, but Pickles wasn‚Äôt on the scene for two more years. The dog was named for the game, but stories about the name‚Äôs origin were funnier thinking the game was named for the dog.\\" Court court dimensions The pickleball court is similar to a doubles badminton court. The actual size of the court is 20 by 44 feet for both doubles and singles. The net is hung at 36 inches on the ends, and 34 inches at center. The court is striped like a badminton court, but the serving line being 7‚Äù further from the net than the badminton service line. That line in pickleball is the non-volley line. The non-volley zone extends 7 feet from the net on either side. Play Pickleballs The ball is served with an underarm stroke so that contact with the ball is made below waist level (waist is defined as the navel level) in an upward arc. The server hits from behind the baseline on one side of the center line and aims diagonally to the opponent's service court (as in the \\"court dimensions\\" figure). Only the serving side may score a point. Play ends for a point when one side commits a fault. Faults include: * not hitting the serve into the opponent's diagonal service court * not hitting the ball beyond the net * not hitting the ball before the 2nd bounce on one side of the net * hitting the ball out of bounds * volleying the ball on the service return * volleying the ball on the first return by the serving side * stepping into the non-volley zone (the first seven feet from the net, also known as the 'kitchen') in the act of volleying the ball. * touching the net with any body part, paddle, or assistance device (includes walkers, canes, or portable oxygen concentrators) A player may enter the non-volley zone to play a ball that bounces and may stay there to play balls that bounce. The player must exit the non-volley zone before playing a volley. The first side scoring 11 points leading by at least two points wins the game. If the two sides are tied at 10 points apiece, the side that goes ahead by two points wins the game. Tournament games may be played to 11, 15 or 21 points with players rotating sides at 6, 8 or 11 total points respectively. The server, or server and partner, usually stay at the baseline until the first return has been hit back and has bounced once. At the beginning of a doubles game, before any serving, the score is 0‚Äì0. Then the side serving first gets only one fault before their side is out, meaning that their opponents serve next. After the first fault, each side gets 2 faults (one for each team member serving) before their side is \\"out\\". In singles play, each side gets only one fault before a side is out and the opponent then serves. The server's score will always be even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10...) when serving from the right side, and odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9...) when serving from the left side. Para-Pickleball Para-Pickleball, sometimes called adaptive or wheelchair pickleball, was officially recognized as a competitive branch of Pickleball by the United States of America Pickleball Association in 2016. Rules for those in wheelchairs are similar to the standard rules with minor alternatives. The player's wheelchair is considered to be part of the player's body and all applicable rules that usually apply to the body will also apply to the player's wheelchair. A pickleball player in a wheelchair is allowed two bounces instead of the one a standup player would receive. When a player in a wheelchair is serving the ball, they must be in a stationary position. They are then allowed one push before striking the ball for service. When the player strikes the ball, the wheels of the wheelchair must not touch any baselines, sidelines, center lines or the extended center or sidelines. When there is a mixed game of those in wheelchairs and those standing, the applicable rules apply for those players respectively. Standing players will adhere to the standing pickleball rules and the wheelchair players will adhere to the wheelchair pickleball rules. USA Pickleball Official Rules Terminology Pickleball players ;Around-the-post, ATP: A shot that travels outside the net posts, allowing its trajectory to stay below the height of the net. ;Baseline: The line at the back of the pickleball court (22 feet from the net). ;Carry Hitting the ball in such a way that it does not bounce away from the paddle but tends to be carried along on the face of the paddle.

He was born in the castle of Tramelay near Saint-Claude in the Jura. According to Du Cange, he succeeded a certain Hugues as Master of the Temple, although this Hugues is otherwise unknown. He was elected Grand Master in June 1151, after the abdication of Everard des Barres, who had returned to France following the Second Crusade. King Baldwin III of Jerusalem granted him the ruined city of Gaza, which Bernard rebuilt for the Templars. In 1153 the Templars participated in the Battle of Ascalon, a fortress at that time controlled by Fatimid Egypt. The Templars constructed a siege tower, which was burned down by the Egyptian soldiers inside Ascalon. The wind caught the flames and part of the walls of Ascalon burned down as well. According to William of Tyre, knights of the Order rushed through the breach without Baldwin's knowledge while Bernard prevented other crusaders from following, as he did not want to share the spoils of the city with the king. Bernard and about forty of his Templars were killed by the larger Egyptian garrison. Their bodies were displayed on the ramparts and their heads were sent to the sultan. Other more modern accounts say that William of Tyre's version may have been distorted, since it may have been based on the defensive accounts given by the army's commanders as to why they did not follow the Templars into the breach. In yet another differing account by a Damascene chronicler in the city, the breach of the wall is mentioned as a precursor to the fall of the city; he makes no mention of the incident with the Templars. Regardless of which account is believed, Bernard was killed and beheaded during the fighting. A few days later, Baldwin captured the fortress; shortly thereafter, the Templars elected Andr√© de Montbard as their Grand Master.

R.M. had many adventures in Australia's rugged outback as a bushman, and became known for creating an Australian style of bushwear clothing and footwear recognised worldwide and the company that bore his name. Personal life Dry Creek From Welsh ancestors, his maternal grandfather Richard Mitchell being from Cornwall, Reginald Murray Williams was born to Joe Williams and his wife. When he was 10 years old, R.M.'s family moved to Adelaide so that he and his two sisters could attend school there. School did not agree with R.M. and so, at 13, R.M. packed his swag and left for the land he loved. At 18 he started work as a camel driver and spent 3 years trekking through the Australian desert, living with Indigenous Australians and learning to survive the harsh conditions. During the Great Depression, R.M. returned to Adelaide, where he met Thelma Ena Cummings, who would become his first wife South Australian Marriages, Registrations 1917‚Äì1937; compiled by South Australian Genealogy & Heraldry Soc. Inc., published in Sep 2002 by SAGHS Inc. and Macbeath Genealogy Services Pty. Ltd. After they married, they settled in South Australia's Flinders Ranges and had six children. After the marriage broke up in the 1950s, Williams purchased 55 hectares of land behind Yatala Labour Prison, South Australia. There, R.M. constructed a homestead, planted vineyards and thousands of roses, and ran rodeos on the floodplain of Dry Creek. When the land was compulsorily acquired during the time of former State Premier Sir Thomas Playford, R.M. left South Australia for his Rockybar property in Eidsvold, Queensland, vowing never to return to South Australia. He remarried in 1955 to Erica, had four more children, living at the North Burnett cattle station in Queensland. In 1985, he co-wrote his autobiography, Beneath whose hand. In 2003 Williams died at his home in Toowoomba on the Darling Downs in Queensland. Company R.M. learned his leather-working skills from a horseman called Dollar Mick, making bridles, pack saddles and riding boots. In 1932, with his son's illness and the expense of hospital treatment, he was in need of money and began selling his saddles to Sir Sidney Kidman, a wealthy pastoralist. R.M. soon had a small factory running in his father's back shed in Adelaide that rapidly expanded. To address financial problems, he also became involved with the Nobles Nob gold mine, near Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory. A pair of R. M. Williams elastic-sided boots Williams established a national magazine, Hoofs and Horns, in 1944, aimed at cattlemen and horsemen. Williams' most successful products were handcrafted riding boots. Williams' boots were unique when they were introduced to the market, as they consisted of a single piece of leather that was stitched at the rear of the boot (the models that featured an elastic side have been particularly popular). Following the founding of the R.M. Williams company in 1932, Williams sold the business in 1988 to the long established South Australian stock and station agents Bennett & Fisher Limited. That business went into receivership in 1993, after banks were concerned about $16 million AUD of debts. R.M. Williams Pty Ltd was then placed under the ownership of long-time friend Ken Cowley, who acted in partnership with Australian business mogul Kerry Stokes, and together with his family, presided over R.M. Williams Pty Ltd for two decades. In October 2020 the LVMH Mo√´t Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) Group agreed to sell the company to Andrew Forrests' Tattarang investment company.

Other related mistreatment of Judas effigies include hanging, flogging, and exploding with fireworks. Anthropologists generalize these types of activities as \\"scapegoating rituals\\". A similar ritual in Jewish tradition would be the hanging and burning an effigy of Haman and his ten sons during Purim, although this is not a widespread contemporary practice. Though not an official part of the Easter liturgical cycle, the custom is typically a part of the reenactment of the story of the Passion that is practiced by the faithful during Easter. Customs vary, but the effigy of Judas is typically hanged (reenacting ) on Good Friday, then burned on the night of Easter Sunday. In many parts of Latin America this practice occurs on the eve of the New Year as a symbol of ridding one's self of evil and beginning a new year in spiritual purity. Some communities observe this ritual using various effigies, including the biblical Judas (who betrayed Jesus). This custom, during which the effigy is burned on a stake, is called \\"Quema del Judas\\" (\\"the burning of Judas\\") in Uruguay and Argentina, and \\"Quema del A√±o Viejo\\" (\\"the burning of the old year\\"):es:A√±o viejo in other places.

The very last burning of the Judas was in 1971 and was conducted by local legend Alan Rietdyk on waste ground between Prophet Street and Northumberland Street in the Liverpool 8 area. The burning of Judas is not traditional to England, although a very similar custom of burning Catholic rebel Guy Fawkes in effigy exists.

The untapped keystone is clearly visible in the bunghole below the label. A keystone is a small wooden or plastic fitting used in ale casks. For some years wooden casks have been effectively obsolete, with the majority now being aluminium or stainless steel, and a few sturdy plastic ones beginning to appear. Nevertheless, the standard tap is still designed to be hammered into yielding material, punching a hole as it goes. All modern casks, even the few wooden ones still in use, use a replaceable keystone to accept the tap. Background The bung-hole of the cask is on one of the circular faces, near the rim.

Some time before the cask is to be served, the end of the tap is placed against this weakened section and, with the aid of a mallet, driven through it. The shaft of the tap is tapered, so that as it is forced in fully it seals against the undisturbed outer part of the keystone. A small amount of beer may leak out during this process, but with sufficient skill and firm action with the mallet, no spillage at all can occur. When the cask is empty, it is a courtesy to the drayman (the brewery's delivery driver who also collects the empty casks) to stop up the hole in the keystone with a small cork bung which can be obtained for this purpose. This prevents old beer being spilled on him or in his vehicle. Similarly, the shive hole may be sealed with a spile. It is common for wooden keystones to acquire a layer of mould on the outside between filling and tapping. This does not indicate a problem with the beer, but because part of the keystone is driven into the cask (where it floats on top of the beer) it must be thoroughly cleaned before the cask is tapped. This action is worthwhile even when plastic keystones are used.  Changing a tap or keystone  Tapping a cask. The escaping beer is due to insufficient force with the mallet, swiftly rectified with a second hit. Due to the somewhat rustic nature of this standard connection system, leaks occasionally appear. If beer is leaking around the tap then hammering it further in will normally fix the problem; otherwise the keystone itself may be split or the tap may be faulty and the offending item will need to be changed. Because of the way ale is conditioned, upending the cask to bring the keystone above the level of the liquid would render the beer undrinkable for at least a day and probably longer, and depending on the condition of the finings may have a permanent effect. Instead, the keystone must be changed in situ. Perhaps surprisingly, this can be achieved without serious loss of beer - half a pint or so is reasonable and half that again is eminently possible. # If possible (depending on the severity of the leak) soak the new keystone in water for some hours to render it less brittle. Ordinarily, they will have been softened by contact with the beer. This step is of course not necessary if using plastic keystones. # Ensure the keystone is the correct size for the cask. Most keystones will fit most casks but there are exceptions and the time to find out is not as the beer chugs out round it. # Hammer a hard spile or perhaps even a plastic sealing peg into the shive hole. This prevents air entering and helps hold the beer in the cask. # Take hold of the tap and move it around to dislodge the old keystone from the cask. # When the old keystone is very loose, get ready to swap it for the new one. It may be easier to have one person remove the old keystone and another insert the new one. Hold the new keystone just to one side of the bung hole. # Swiftly remove the old keystone and insert the new one, then give it a tap with the mallet. If done smoothly, hardly any beer will be lost. # Hammer the tap through the keystone as normal. If the tap is the problem, one may either replace the keystone as above and insert a new tap, or perform a similar operation but removing only the tap, leaving the keystone in place, and quickly inserting a new tap in the hole. Some authorities recommend using a small cork bung between removing the old tap and inserting the new one.  Notes  This is more likely to be the case at beer festivals where there are many taps, infrequently used and maintained. A possibly-faulty tap is not worth having in a pub where casks are changed all year round.

In 1628, it was given to Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg by King Ferdinand II when he bestowed upon Hans Ulrich the title of Duke of Krumlov. The Bohemian possessions of the Eggenbergs later went to Hans Ulrich's son, Johann Anton von Eggenberg (1610‚Äì1649). In 1649, the title passed to Johann Anton's son, Johann Christian von Eggenberg. He married Marie Ernestine of Schwarzenberg, who was a member of the noble House of Schwarzenberg. Upon the death of Johann Christian, the male line of the House of Eggenberg came to an end. The death of Marie Ernestine in 1719 caused the Bohemian possessions of the Eggenbergs to pass to her closest relatives in the Schwarzenberg family. As a result, the Duchy of Krumlov was obtained by Prince Adam Francis Charles of Schwarzenberg in 1723, and the title of Duke of Krumlov is reserved for the head of the House of Schwarzenberg.

GlobeXplorer has been credited as the first company to establish a business around compiling and distributing online aerial and satellite imagery. In 2007, the company was acquired by DigitalGlobe. GlobeXplorer's imagery and property data was licensed to many online information websites. GlobeXplorer obtained its content through online distribution relationships with about 30 of the world's top acquirers of aerial, satellite, and property data. GlobeXplorer's primary products were the ImageAtlas viewer and ImageBuilder web developer toolkit. It also provided ImageConnect extensions and web services for GIS and Computer-aided design. GlobeXplorer's defensible core competence was its ability to meter custom profiles of content for consumers and pay royalties to providers based on 512x512 \\"standard image units\\" (SIU). This was accomplished through content hosting, delivery via APIs and application plugins, and building a custom billing system modeled around TELCO call rating and inter-bank settlement accounting. Beyond imagery, the billing system also supported metering of vector data and usage of floating license tokens for programs such as Arc/INFO, PCI and ERDAS. History GlobeXplorer was founded in 1999 by Rob Shanks, Michael Fisher, Chris Nicholas, and Paul Smith (former executives at HJW GeoSpatial, Inc.) through partnerships with Sun Microsystems, NASA, and Oracle Corporation. It grew from a NASA EOCAP project of HJW's to place ready-made orthophotography online, and an internal project of Sun Microsystems and Oracle to counter the Microsoft \\"Terraserver\\" technology demonstration. The EOCAP project concluded with the creation of an 'earth imagery' searchable website in 1998. HJW was acquired by Harrods of London, who provided financial backing to spin out the online effort into GlobeXplorer, which launched its public website in September 2000. An article entitled \\"Now you, too, can be a Spy\\" appeared on the front page of the Wall Street Journal's business section, and traffic reached nearly 4 million page views the first day. In 2000, the company unveiled the largest Earth imagery archive. In 2005, GlobeXplorer acquired AirPhotoUSA, a provider of aerial imagery. In January 2007, Stewart Title sold the company to DigitalGlobe.

A letter-quality printer operates in much the same fashion as a typewriter. A metal or plastic printwheel embossed with letters, numbers, or symbols strikes an inked ribbon, depositing the ink (or carbon, if an expensive single-strike ribbon was installed) on the page and thus printing a character. Over time, several different technologies were developed including automating ordinary typebar typewriter mechanisms (such as the Friden Flexowriter), daisy wheel printers (dating from a 1939 patent, but brought to life in the 1970s by Diablo engineer David S. Lee) where the type is moulded around the edge of a wheel, and \\"golf ball\\" (the popular informal name for \\"typeball\\", as used in the IBM Selectric typewriter) printers where the type is distributed over the face of a globe-shaped printhead (including automating IBM Selectric mechanisms such as the IBM 2741 terminal). The daisy wheel and Selectric-based printers offered the advantage that the typeface was readily changeable by the user to accommodate varying needs. These printers were referred to as \\"letter-quality printers\\" during their heyday, and could produce text which was as clear and crisp as a typewriter (though they were nowhere near the quality of printing presses). Most were available either as complete computer terminals with keyboards (or with a keyboard add-on option) that could double as a typewriter in stand-alone (\\"off-line\\") mode, or as print-only devices. Because of its low cost at the time, the daisy wheel printer became the most successful, the method used by Diablo, Qume, Brother and Apple. Letter-quality impact printers, however, were slow, noisy, incapable of printing graphics or images (unless the programmable microspacing and over-use of the dot were employed), sometimes limited to monochrome, and limited to a fixed set (usually one) of typefaces without operator intervention, though certain font effects like underlining and boldface could be achieved by overstriking. Soon, dot-matrix printers (such as the Oki Microline 84) would offer \\"Near Letter Quality\\" (NLQ) modes which were much faster than daisy-wheel printers, could produce graphics well, but were still very noticeably lower than \\"letter quality\\". Nowadays, printers using non- impact printing (for example laser printers, inkjet printers, and other similar means) have replaced traditional letter-quality printers in most applications. The quality of inkjet printers can approach the old letter- quality impact printers (but can be limited by factors such as paper type). Use in word processing Dedicated word processors and WP software for general-purpose computers that rose in popularity in the late 1970s and 1980s would use features such as microspacing (usually by 1/120 of an inch horizontally and, possibly, 1/48 of an inch vertically) to implement subscripts, proportional spacing, underlining, and so on. The more rudimentary software packages would implement bold text by overtyping the character in exactly the same spot (for example, using the backspace control code), but better software would print the letter in 3 slightly different positions. Software did exist to (slowly) produce pie charts on such printers (and on some daisywheels the dot was reinforced with metal to cope with extra wear).

He is a graduate of Green Templeton College, Oxford and an honorary fellow of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. In addition to his work in medicine and tropical diseases, he has published popular works in the fields of genetics and human prehistory. This latter work has been the subject of a number of television and film projects. Career Oppenheimer trained in medicine at Oxford and London universities, qualifying in 1971. From 1972 he worked as a clinical paediatrician, mainly in Malaysia, Nepal and Papua New Guinea. He carried out and published clinical research in the areas of nutrition, infectious disease (including malaria), and genetics, focussing on the interactions between nutrition, genetics and infection, in particular iron nutrition, thalassaemia and malaria. From 1979 he moved into medical research and teaching, with positions at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Oxford University, a research centre in Kilifi, Kenya, and the Universiti Sains Malaysia in Penang. University of Oxford: Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology: Stephen Oppenheimer: Summary of main research interests . Retrieved 18 November 2009. He spent three years undertaking fieldwork in Papua New Guinea, studying the effects of iron supplementation on susceptibility to infection. His fieldwork, published in the late 1980s, identified the role of genetic mutation in malarious areas as a result of natural selection due to its protective effect against malaria, and that different genotypes for alpha-thalassaemia traced different migrations out to the Pacific. Following that work, he concentrated on researching the use of unique genetic mutations as markers of ancient migrations. From 1990 to 1994 Oppenheimer served as chairman and chief of clinical service in the Department of Paediatrics in the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He worked as senior specialist paediatrician in Brunei from 1994 to 1996. He returned to England in 1997, writing the book Eden in the East: the drowned continent of Southeast Asia, published in 1998. The book synthesised work across a range of disciplines, including oceanography, archaeology, linguistics, social anthropology and human genetics. He continued to write books and articles, and began a second career as a researcher and popular-science writer on human prehistory. He worked as consultant on two television documentary series, The Real Eve (Discovery Channel) and Out of Eden (Channel 4), and published a second book, Out of Eden: the Peopling of the World (retitled The Real Eve in USA). This was followed in 2006 by The Origins of the British: a genetic detective story, on the post-glacial peopling of Great Britain and Ireland. In 2009 he was consultant on the BBC TV series The Incredible Human Journey.

Eden in the East In his book Eden in the East: The Drowned Continent of Southeast Asia, published in 1998, Oppenheimer makes a case that the rise in ocean levels that accompanied the waning of the ice age‚Äîas much as ‚Äîduring the period 14,000‚Äì7,000 years ago, must be taken into account when trying to understand the flow of genes and culture in Eurasia. Citing evidence from geology, archaeology, genetics, linguistics, and folklore, he hypothesizes that the Southeast Asian subcontinent of Sundaland was home to a rich and original culture that was dispersed when Sundaland was mostly submerged and its population moved westward. According to Oppenheimer, Sundaland's culture may have reached India and Mesopotamia, becoming the root for the innovative cultures that developed in those areas. He also suggests that the Austronesian languages originate from Sundaland and that a Neolithic Revolution may have started there.  The Real Eve (documentary and US book title) / Out of Eden (UK book title)  In 2002, Oppenheimer worked as consultant on a television documentary series, The Real Eve, produced by the American cable TV network the Discovery Channel and directed by Andrew Piddington. The series was known as Where We Came From in the United Kingdom. The \\"Eve\\" in the title refers to Mitochondrial Eve, a name used for the most recent common ancestor of all humans in the matrilineal (mother to daughter) line of descent. Following the series, Oppenheimer published a book on the same theme, originally titled Out of Eden in the UK and republished as The Real Eve in the US. This work, published in 2004, focuses on Oppenheimer's hypothesis: that approximately 85 thousand years ago, a group of modern humans migrated from East Africa across the Red Sea to South Asia in a single major exodus numbering no more than a few hundred individuals. This lone group of wanderers, he suggests, were the ancestors of all the peoples of the earth except sub-Saharan Africans, their descendants having since migrated all over the Eurasian continent, North Africa, the Pacific islands, and the New World, and radiated into a plurality of physical characteristics, languages, ethnicities and cultures as seen today.Out of Eden: The Peopling of the World, Stephen Oppenheimer, Constable and Robinson 2004  Origins of the British  In his 2006 book The Origins of the British (revised in 2007), Oppenheimer argued that neither Anglo-Saxons nor Celts had much impact on the genetics of the inhabitants of the British Isles, and that British ancestry mainly traces back to the Palaeolithic Iberian people, now represented best by Basques, instead. He also argued that the Scandinavian input has been underestimated. He published an introduction to his book in Prospect magazine Stephen Oppenheimer, \\"Myths of British ancestry\\", Prospect, October 2006. Retrieved 23 August 2008. and answered some of his critics in a further Prospect magazine article in June 2007. Stephen Oppenheimer, \\"Myths of British ancestry revisited\\", Prospect, June 2007. Retrieved 23 August 2008. Although Basque-like Neolithic farmers did populate Britain (and much of Northern Europe) during the Neolithic period, upwards of 90% of their DNA was overturned by a North European population of ultimate Russian Steppe origin as part of an ongoing migration process that brought large amounts of Steppe DNA (including the R1b haplogroup) to North and West Europe. Modern autosomal genetic clustering is testament to this fact, as the British and Irish cluster genetically very closely with other North European populations, not Iberians, Galicians, Basques or those from the south of France.

The band officially reunited on October 10, 2013. Biography Combining many different music styles (1960s psychedelic, jazz, piano recital, heavy metal, circus music and vocals, among others) Dog Fashion Disco is primarily considered an avant-garde metal and alternative metal band. The band's lyrical content is often highly esoteric and satirical, with constant tongue-in-cheek references to the occult, drug use, and mutilation. Their sound has often been compared to the Northern California genre-defying act, Mr. Bungle. The band members themselves have cited their collective influences as being Mike Patton (Mr. Bungle, Faith No More), Clutch, Tool, System of a Down and Frank Zappa. Early years (1995‚Äì2000) Dog Fashion Disco, or DFD as many fans refer to them as, was formed in 1995 by Todd Smith, Greg Combs, and John Ensminger, who all went to high school together. Originally their name was Hug The Retard, but this was changed name to Dog Fashion Disco before releasing any material, as they felt the name Hug The Retard was too offensive and might cost them fans. Their first two releases were self-released and low budget products. The first ‚Äì Erotic Massage ‚Äì was funded by a loan taken out by drummer John Ensminger, which his father had to co-sign on and \\"took nearly a year of local shows to pay off the part of the loan that was used for studio time, printing and pressing\\" and was released independently by the band in 1997. The second self-released album was titled Experiments In Alchemy and released in 1998. Experiments saw more heavy metal numbers, as opposed to the more ballady feel on many of Massage's songs. That same year, DFD signed with Outerloop Records and released The Embryo's in Bloom. The studio quality of the album is noticeably better than its predecessors, and the band was very pleased with the resulted sound. It was then that their management by Maryland resident Derek J. Brewer began and lasted until they disbanded. Polkadot Cadaver is now also managed by Derek J. Brewer under Outerloop Management. In late 1998, Jeff Siegel would join the band as the keyboard player, replacing Sennen Quigley. This lineup would be the longest lasting lineup and stay intact for over 4 years. Rising popularity and personnel changes (2000‚Äì2004) In 2000, DFD played on USA Network's FarmClub. The exposure DFD received from the show lead them to signing with Spitfire Records. With the release of their major label debut Anarchists of Good Taste in 2001 on Spitfire Records, DFD saw much wider popularity and distribution of their music than ever before, and recorded a track with System of a Down front-man, Serj Tankian providing vocals, \\"Mushroom Cult\\" on the Anarchists album. This song is often wrongly attributed to System of a Down, although Serj Tankian was the only member of System of a Down to perform on the track. The band shot their first music video for the song \\"Leper Friend,\\" and embarked on their first UK tour in support of the album. DFD also toured with the likes of Mindless Self Indulgence and Tub Ring through 2002. In 2003, they released Committed to a Bright Future on Spitfire Records and supported Lacuna Coil on their first U.S. headlining tour. Although the album contains the same lineup as Anarchists, both guitarist Greg Combs and drummer John Ensminger left the band before it was released, the latter being replaced by Mike \\"Ollie\\" Oliver before the album was released (and is pictured in the album booklet, as well as being listed as an official member of the band). Ensminger and Combs were credited as performing on the album, though not as band members. The spot of lead guitar was temporarily filled by Jason Stevens for the Committed tour, during which bassist and original member Stephen Mears left the band to join the Navy. Mears was replaced by Brian White, and after the tour, Stevens was replaced by Margret Heater member Jasan Stepp as lead guitarist. This lineup recorded the Day of the Dead EP and the live album The City Is Alive Tonight, released in 2004 and 2005 respectively, and is the band lineup in DFDVD. Rotten Records, Adultery and hiatus (2005‚Äì2007) Guitarist Jasan Stepp performing with DFD at Fletchers Bar in Baltimore, Maryland.The members of Dog Fashion Disco hugging after performing their final song. After a short period of off-time in the first half of 2005 (in which The Alter Boys sole album was made and released), Oliver quit the band. Shortly after, DFD's contract with Artemis was ended, and DFD were signed to Rotten Records. On April 4, 2006, they released their sixth studio album, Adultery, which featured the return of original drummer John Ensminger. Their CD release party was held at Peabody's in Cleveland on the April 6th with Tub Ring. The band toured in support for the release of Adultery along with Tub Ring during the summer of 2006, in which keyboardist Tim Swanson temporarily replaced Jeff Siegel. Many of the shows took place in smaller venues (with subsequently smaller audiences) than their tours while signed to Spitfire and Artemis, and, according to Jasan Stepp, resulted in low morale among the band. On December 5, 2006, Todd Smith Dog posted a blog entry on Dog Fashion Disco's official MySpace stating that the band had decided to call it quits. They performed their farewell show at the Sonar Lounge in Baltimore, Maryland on January 13, 2007, to a capacity crowd, with fans coming from as far away as the United Kingdom. The band played a marathon 25+ song set, ending with the crowd-favorite \\"Albino Rhino\\" from the 1998 Experiments in Alchemy album (this was a common concert-closer), and played the song \\"Sweet Insanity\\" from their newest album, Adultery, for an encore song. Other past band members including Sennan Quigley and Mike \\"Ollie\\" Oliver attended to show support for their former musical family. The show was opened by the band Oddzar. The event was recorded and then released on the DVD DFDVD II by Rotten Records on October 28, 2008. Post‚Äìdisbandment bands=Polkadot Cadaver On April 17, 2007, a bulletin was posted on the Dog Fashion Disco MySpace page, announcing a new project, Polkadot Cadaver, which is stylistically similar to Dog Fashion Disco. The project features Todd Smith, Jasan Stepp and John Ensminger. The project's MySpace page has four songs and an album (Purgatory Dance Party) which was released on the week of November 17, 2007 for pre-orders and had a street date of November 27, 2007. They released their second album, Sex Offender on May 10, 2011. Their third album (and first on their own record label Razor to Wrist Records), titled Last Call in Jonestown, was released on May 14, 2013. Knives Out! In late 2008, Todd Smith and Jasan Stepp teamed up with members of Nothingface as well as Hellyeah to form Knives Out!. They released their debut album, Black Mass Hysteria, on February 14, 2012. Their follow-up album, Left in the Lurch, was released on August 19, 2016. El-Creepo! In 2010, Smith released his first solo album titled El-Creepo! under this moniker. He released his second album under the El-Creepo! name, entitled Aloha, in 2012, and the third Bellissimo! on January 1, 2016. Celebrity Sex Scandal In 2012, ex- guitarist Greg Combs's new band Celebrity Sex Scandal released their first single \\"Ode to Katy Perry\\". Their full-length debut, entitled Derivative, was released in February 2013. In 2015 Celebrity Sex Scandal released their second album Integral. Other projects Todd Smith, Matt Rippetoe and Jeff Siegel are members of The Alter Boys since 2005, although Todd Smith has stated that The Alter Boys will not release any new material. Tim Swanson has since formed the band Ideamen. The band released an EP titled Progress in 2007 Their full- length debut studio album, May You Live in Interesting Times, was released in 2009 on Rotten Records and their second full-length album Schemata, was released in 2014. Matt Rippetoe released a solo record, BOINK in 2007, and formed a side project, Willamette, who released their self-titled debut in 2012. Reunion (2013‚Äìpresent) The group reunited four times after breaking up before reforming as an active band again in 2013. 2008 They first reunited on September 12, 2008, for the release of DFDVD II and their compilation Beating a Dead Horse to Death... Again. The show featured Stephen Mears on bass for the first time in nearly 5 years. 2010 The second reunion (and first with the final lineup) took place on April 17, 2010, at The Ottobar. The show was opened by Smith and Stepp's side projects Polkadot Cadaver and Knives Out! 2011: Anarchist and Adultery shows They reunited once more on June 24 and 25 2011 for the tenth and fifth anniversary of their albums Anarchists of Good Taste and Adultery, respectively. At the second show, Dog Fashion Disco announced that they will be releasing an acoustic album. Attendees of the reunion shows with VIP passes were provided with a code that allowed them to download an acoustic version of their song \\"Sweet Insanity.\\" it was also announced that the concert series are to be released on DVD sometime in the future. However, these DVD and acoustic plans have been postponed, and their fate is uncertain. 2013: Committed shows and reformation The most recent reunion was a two-night set of shows that took place on May 31 and June 1, 2013 at Baltimore Sound Stage, featuring the Adultery lineup like the previous two reunions. These Shows were preceded by an El-Creepo! \\"warm up\\" show at The Ottobar on May 30, which included drummers John Ensminger and Scott Radway, as well as Jasan Stepp. The first night of the reunion featured original guitarist Greg Combs on stage with DFD for the first time in over 10 years. At the second show, Smith announced plans for a new album, with the title \\"Sweet Nothings\\". On October 10, 2013, a status update via the Polkadot Cadaver Facebook page confirmed that Dog Fashion Disco is officially back together as a band. The line-up is the same as the previous three reunion line-ups, however, Tim Swanson will replace Jeff Siegel on keyboards once again. It was then announced that Mike Oliver would be playing drums on the summer tour of 2014. 2014 The first album from DFD in eight years, Sweet Nothings, was released on July 22, 2014, after being funded through Indiegogo. Due to the success from their Indiegogo campaign, in 2015 the band announced that they will be releasing a follow up album entitled 'Ad Nauseum'. They also announced three nights in London, England, for September 2014, and the success of those sell-out dates prompted a UK tour with Psychostick in 2015. The album was released on October 2, 2015. 2017‚Äìpresent The band began releasing re-recorded versions of their earlier albums, in order to reclaim the rights to the music from their former record labels. The first of these was Erotic Massage, which was released on May 19, 2017. This was followed up by another re-recorded album, Experiments in Embryos, released on July 6, 2018. The third album, Anarchists of Good Taste, was released in December 7, 2018 and the last of the re-records, Committed to a Bright Future, was released on June 28, 2019. The Adultery novelization Moonlight City Drive, a novelization of DFD's 2006 concept album Adultery was written by Brian Paone and published in November, 2017.

She was the daughter of William IV, Prince of Orange, Stadtholder of the Netherlands, and Anne, Princess Royal. She was regent of the Netherlands from 1765 until 1766 during the minority of her brother. Life Princess Carolina was born in Leeuwarden. In 1747, it was declared that the position of stadtholder could be inherited by females, thus making the young Princess Carolina the heir presumptive to the position of stadtholder. However, in 1748, a male heir, William, was born to her parents, thus displacing her and putting her second in line to the position. Princess Carolina's father died in 1751, making her three-year-old brother William V of Orange. At that point, her mother was appointed regent. However, in 1759, her mother died, and William V was still just ten years old. Then, Princess Carolina's paternal grandmother, Princess Marie-Luise, was made regent. Marie- Luise was regent until 1765, when she died. William V was now seventeen, but that was still not old enough to rule on his own. So, Princess Carolina was made regent. She ruled until 1766, when William V turned eighteen. She died 6 May 1787 in Kirchheimbolanden, aged 44. Marriage and children On 5 March 1760 in The Hague, during the regency of her grandmother Princess Marie Luise, Princess Carolina married Karl Christian, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg.

A shive is a wooden or plastic fitting used in ale casks. It is found on the curved side of the cask, arranged so that when the cask is on its side and the keystone is at the lowest part of the rim, the shive will be the highest point of the cask. The hole in that part of the cask is used for two purposes. Firstly, it is used for cleaning out and then refilling the cask, which requires a large hole. Once the cask arrives at its destination, the hole is used to control the amount of carbon dioxide present in the container, which requires a small hole. The shive is effectively an adaptor that reconciles these conflicting requirements. It is a wooden disk, larger than a keystone, that fits in the hole in the cask and has a smaller hole in its centre. For washing and filling, the old shive is removed using a chisel or a special tool, revealing a hole around 3 inches (7.5 cm) across. Once the cask has been filled and fined, a new shive is hammered into place. The hole in the centre of the shive will be sealed with a small wooden or plastic peg. The cask is then transported to the pub. Some time before the beer is to be served (two or three days is common; especially strong beers may require more) the cask is opened or \\"vented\\". This entails breaking the seal in the middle of the shive by punching it through into the cask with a mallet and some kind of tool, usually just a hard spile. A spile is then placed in the hole to regulate the gas flow. If the beer is particularly \\"lively\\" (common in warm weather and with specific beers) the contents may spray out when the cask is vented. During use, the hole in the centre of the shive can also be used (with the spile removed) to insert a marked dipstick in order to measure the quantity of beer remaining. As with keystones, it is considered good form to close up the hole in the shive when returning empty casks, both to prevent spillage and to reduce bacterial and fungal contamination.

The Montbard family came from Hochadel in Burgundy, and Andr√© was an uncle of St. Bernard of Clairvaux, being a half- brother of Bernard's mother Aleth de Montbard. She had married Tescelin Sorus, a knight, the father of Bernard. He entered the Order in 1129 and went to Palestine, where he quickly rose to the rank of seneschal, deputy and second- in-command to the Grand Master.

It resembles a roller bearing but, instead of cylindrical rollers, non-revolving asymmetric figure-eight shaped sprags, or other elements allowing single direction rotation, are used. When the unit rotates in one direction the rollers slip or free-wheel, but when a torque is applied in the opposite direction, the sprags tilt slightly, producing a wedging action and binding because of friction. The sprags are spring-loaded on their pivots to ensure that they lock with very little backlash once drive is engaged. Applications=Automatic transmissions A sprag clutch is used in some automatic transmissions as a method of allowing the transmission to smoothly change gears under load. Various models of General Motors' Turbo-Hydramatic transmission have used this system as well as many transmissions from Ford, such as the Ford C6 transmission. A sprag clutch is used in most older automatic transmissions and some newer ones for shifts which require the synchronized engagement of one clutch with the disengagement of another. Using an overrunning clutch instead of a hydraulically actuated one makes this synchronization automatic. The sprag clutch simply \\"lets go\\" once the reaction force it provides is no longer needed. In a Simpson planetary gearset, common to many automatic transmissions, this happens on the 1-2 shift, and reverses on the 2-1 downshift. The 2-3 shift is done by engaging a single clutch, and nothing is released. Some newer electronically controlled transmissions make \\"clutch to clutch\\" shifts, without any sprags. This can also be used exclusively in first gear (transmission shift lever in D, but auto valve body or management selecting 1st) on some autos. That way it will automatically provide forward drive, but will not provide any engine braking. This is done not so much to avoid engine braking per se, but rather to allow a low throttle opening 2-1 downshift as a car decelerates, to avoid a loud (and potentially abrupt) and unnerving jolt as a result of the downshift. On transmissions so equipped, manual selection of 1st gear typically engages an additional band that grips the same section as the one way clutch would engage, and thus allows for engine braking. Turbine Starter A sprag clutch may be used in the starting turbine of a turbojet engine, so that the running main engine does not keep the starter engaged at high speeds. Helicopters A sprag clutch is used in many helicopter designs to transfer power from the engine to the main rotor. In the event of an engine failure, the sprag clutch allows the main rotor to continue rotating faster than the engines so that the helicopter can enter autorotation. Motorcycle applicationsStarters= A sprag clutch is used in the electric starter motors of modern motorcycle engines to replace the Bendix gear common to automobile starters. =Primary drive= Many modern sport and racing motorcycles use sprag clutches in the primary drive between the engine and transmission. This prevents the rear wheel from losing traction during rapid downshifts when the engine speed is not matched to road speed. If a sprag clutch is not present, much greater care is required when downshifting, because losing rear wheel traction can cause dangerous highside accidents. Conveyors On conveyor drives, a sprag clutch is used for indexing and anti-runback. =Overrunning= Overrunning occurs when two or more motors can be used to drive the same machine, including through the same shaft. A typical setup is as follows. The service drive, or prime mover, provides a combination of high speed and high power for normal operation. The secondary drive, or pony drive, can be run at low speed and low power, usually to position the conveyor for maintenance. The overrunning clutch allows the secondary drive to remain stationary during normal high speed operation of the conveyor drive. =Indexing= An indexing motion provides for accuracy in the drive system. A link is installed between the prime mover and one race of the sprag clutch. The reciprocating motion of the prime mover is converted to an indexing movement on the other race of the sprag clutch. =Backstopping= Backstopping prevents a loaded inclined conveyor from running back when the drive system is stopped. The outer race of the sprag clutch is fixed to the machine frame, usually via a torque arm. The inner race rotates freely in the forward direction of the conveyor drive. When the machine tries to run backward, the sprag clutch prevents this motion. In this application the sprag clutch is often called a \\"backstop\\" or \\"holdback\\". =Hoist load brake= A hoist load brake is used as a secondary brake to prevent industrial hoists from catastrophically dropping their loads in the event of mechanical failure. Lubrication Sprag clutches may be oil or grease lubricated. Most sprag clutch manufacturers don't allow the use of lubricants containing extreme pressure additives.

He is known for tough-guy and western roles, including the 1960 film The Magnificent Seven (1960), and producing several films for Sidney J. Furie such as Lady Sings the Blues. He is also known for a short marriage to Peggy Lee, a friendship with Marilyn Monroe and for saving Frank Sinatra from drowning. Dexter's tough-guy roles contrasted with his easygoing and friendly real-life personality. Life and career=Early life Dexter was born in Goldfield, Nevada, the second of three children (all males) born to Marko and Ljubica ≈†o≈°o (later known as Marko and Violet Soso), who were ethnic Serb immigrants from Bosnia-Herzegovina. Serbian was Dexter's first language.\\"Myth #93: So Who Was Actor Brad Dexter Anyway? by Guy Rocha, Former Nevada State Archivist\\" , nsla.nv.gov (PDF); accessed October 9, 2016. The family soon decamped for Los Angeles, where he attended Belmont High School. Tall, burly and handsome with bright blue eyes, Dexter was usually given supporting roles as a rugged character. After a stint as an amateur boxer, Dexter attended the Pasadena Playhouse, where he studied acting. He had a small role in The Mortal Storm (1940). During World War II he enlisted for military service with the U.S. Army Air Corps, where he met and befriended Karl Malden, a fellow Serbian-American, and appeared uncredited in the Corps play and film Winged Victory (1944). As Barry Mitchell After the war, Dexter had a role in Heldorado (1946), a Roy Rogers western, as \\"Barry Mitchell\\". He was also credited under this name in Sinbad, the Sailor (1947). He appeared on Broadway in Magnolia Alley (1949). As Brad Dexter He eventually changed his name to Brad Dexter and landed roles in The Asphalt Jungle (1950) and Fourteen Hours (1951). Dexter's breakthrough role was as a villain in RKO's The Las Vegas Story (1951), starring Victor Mature and Jane Russell. RKO cast him in a similar part in Macao (1952), also with Russell. RKO signed him to a contract. From January to November 1953, he was married to singer Peggy Lee. The union ended in divorce. She claimed that during their marriage he hardly worked. Dexter was villainous to John Payne in 99 River Street (1953). He then signed a contract with 20th Century Fox, for whom he made Untamed (1955), Violent Saturday (1955) for director Richard Fleischer, House of Bamboo (1955) for director Samuel Fuller, The Bottom of the Bottle (1956), and Between Heaven and Hell (1956) again with Fleischer. Dexter was villainous to Joel McCrea in The Oklahoman (1957), produced by Walter Mirisch, and also appeared in Run Silent Run Deep (1958), again as a villain. He largely focused on television, however, appearing in episodes of Climax!, The Gale Storm Show, How to Marry a Millionaire, Pursuit, Studio One in Hollywood, Wagon Train, Have Gun - Will Travel, Zane Grey Theatre, Behind Closed Doors, Cimarron City, Yancy Derringer, This Man Dawson, 77 Sunset Strip, Colt 45, The Man from Blackhawk, Tightrope, Mr. Lucky, Bat Masterton, and Wanted: Dead or Alive, starring Steve McQueen. He made the occasional feature film, such as Last Train from Gun Hill (1959), directed by John Sturges, and Vice Raid (1959), and was second billed in 13 Fighting Men (1960). The Magnificent Seven Dexter was then cast as a gunslinger in The Magnificent Seven (1960), directed by John Sturges for Walter Mirisch's production firm The Mirisch Company. Both Sturges and Mirisch had worked with Dexter before. It became his best-known role and most famous film. Characterizing him as a \\"tough guy at his best in The Magnificent Seven\\", Dexter's obituary in The Guardian singled out his portrayal of Harry Luck and claimed he was \\"overshadowed\\" by his contemporaries: > A question that comes up regularly in film trivia quizzes is to name the > Magnificent Seven of the 1960 John Sturges western. Easy to start with: Yul > Brynner, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, and > Horst Buchholz. But if Brad Dexter... is usually the last to be mentioned, > it is mainly because of the fame of the others; actually, he was rather good > as the most mercenary of the septet. ... the cool and taciturn Harry > Luck....Ronald Bergan, Obituary, The Guardian], December 23, 2002; accessed > May 1, 2012.  Return to television  The success of The Magnificent Seven did not immediately benefit Dexter's career: he returned to television, guest starring in The Aquanauts, Hawaiian Eye, General Electric Theatre, Tales of Wells Fargo, Surfside 6, The Investigators, and Alcoa Premiere. He could be seen in It Started in Tokyo (1961), The George Raft Story (1961) (playing Bugsy Siegel), X-15 (1962) with Charles Bronson and Johnny Cool (1963). Dexter supported Yul Brynner again in Taras Bulba (1962), Kings of the Sun (1963) (from the producers of Magnificent Seven), and Invitation to a Gunfighter (1964). In 1963, Dexter was cast as California Supreme Court Justice David S. Terry in \\"A Gun Is Not a Gentleman\\" on the syndicated anthology series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. Carroll O'Connor portrayed U.S. Senator David C. Broderick of California, who mortally wounded Justice Terry in an 1859 duel. Though past allies in the Democratic Party, Terry, a slavery advocate, challenged the anti-slavery Broderick. Frank Sinatra Dexter's friendship with Frank Sinatra began when Dexter saved Sinatra from drowning on May 10, 1964, during production of the World War II film None but the Brave (1965) on the island of Kauai, Hawaii. Sinatra and Ruth Koch, the wife of producer Howard Koch, were swimming when they were swept out to sea by the outgoing tide and nearly drowned. Sinatra's co-star Dexter and two surfers swam out and rescued them. Dexter was later awarded a Red Cross medal for his bravery. Grateful, Sinatra made him vice president of Sinatra Enterprises. After Dexter appeared in Bus Riley's Back in Town (1965), he made another film with Sinatra, Von Ryan's Express (1965). That year, Dexter complained that acting made him \\"frustrated as hell. As an actor you don't have control over the medium you're in... you have no control over your destiny.\\" Dexter produced The Naked Runner (1967), which starred Sinatra and was filmed in London. Dexter and director Sidney J. Furie clashed with Sinatra over the latter's unwillingness to finish the film, and, after it was completed, Dexter resigned. \\"I was the only guy who dropped Sinatra ... I couldn't put up with his nonsense\\", Dexter said at the time. Publicly, Dexter denied any falling out with Sinatra. He claimed to have left Sinatra's company to make a film with Furie based on the Sam Sheppard case. The project eventually became The Lawyer (1970) starring Barry Newman as Petrocelli. He produced two more films for Furie: Little Fauss and Big Halsy (1970) starring Robert Redford, and Lady Sings the Blues (1972) starring Diana Ross as Billie Holiday. Later career Dexter returned to acting with roles in Jory (1973), Shampoo (1975), Vigilante Force (1976), The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover (1977), House Calls (1978) and Winter Kills (1979), and guest parts on McCloud, Kojak, S.W.A.T., Project U.F.O., and The Incredible Hulk. Dexter produced the TV series Skag (1980) starring Karl Malden. His last role was in Cognac (1988). Family He was married to Star-Kist tuna heiress Mary Bogdanovich from January 27, 1971, until her death on June 12, 1994. Later in 1994, he married June Deyer and remained with her until his death. Death Dexter died in Rancho Mirage, California, from emphysema, on December 11, 2002, at age 85, and is interred at Desert Memorial Park.

His association with Francis Drake, on a 1577 voyage to raid Spanish treasure fleets, ended in a shipboard trial for treason and witchcraft, and Doughty's execution. Although some scholars doubt the validity of the charges of treason, and question Drake's authority to try and execute Doughty, the incident set an important precedent: according to a history of the English Navy, titled To Rule the Waves: How the British Navy Shaped the Modern World by Arthur L. Herman, Doughty's execution established the idea that a ship's captain was its absolute ruler, regardless of the rank or social class of its passengers. Source of conflict Doughty befriended Drake during Drake's military actions in Ireland. Drake, Doughty and John Wynter left Plymouth, England in 1577, purportedly on a simple trip to Alexandria. Drake's real mission was to interfere with Spanish treasure fleets in the New World; whether he proceeded with the full knowledge and sanction of Queen Elizabeth I, and whether his original intent was the circumnavigation of the globe are still topics of scholarly debate (see Kelsey, \\"Sir Francis Drake: the Queen's Pirate.\\") The three men apparently shared responsibility for the voyageKelsey, p.83 but Drake soon assumed the role of commander of the expedition, a matter which caused friction between Drake and the aristocratic Doughty. Doughty was given command of a captured Portuguese ship, the Santa Maria (renamed Mary). The tension between Drake and Doughty worsened when Doughty caught Drake's brother, Thomas Drake, stealing from the captured cargo of the vessel.Kelsey 97 Drake assumed command of the Mary and reassigned Doughty to command his flagship the Pelican. During the long voyage across the Atlantic, Drake's hostility increased, fuelled by the rancor of his brother.Kelsey, p.98 Drake eventually demoted Doughty to command of a tiny supply vessel named Swan. This insult proved too much for Doughty to take, and he began to complain bitterly about \\"the Captain General.\\" Charges When the Swan became separated from the rest of the fleet during a severe storm, Drake became convinced that Doughty was practising witchcraft. On 17 May 1578, upon the reunion of the fleet, Drake and Doughty had a final quarrel; Drake struck Doughty and ordered him tied to the mast. By 3 June both Doughty and his brother, John Doughty, had been put under house arrest and the sailors forbidden from interacting with them. Drake accused Doughty of being \\"a conjurer and a seditious person,\\" and his brother of being \\"a witch and a poisoner.\\"Kelsey p.104 Trial and execution The fleet arrived at Puerto San Juli√°n, a natural harbour in Patagonia in the Santa Cruz Province of Argentina on 20 June. Doughty's trial began on the 30th; Drake charged Doughty with not only mutiny, but treason. Doughty first appealed to be taken with the fleet as a prisoner and tried upon return to England, but Drake refused. Doughty next demanded that Drake show his commission from the Queen allowing him such jurisdiction, which Drake again refused, to which lawyer and friend of Doughty, Leonard Vicary, responded, \\"This is not lawe nor agriable to justice.\\" Drake responded, \\"I have not...to do with you crafty lawyars, neythar care I for the lawe, but I know what I wyll do.\\" The main body of evidence against Doughty is referenced in manuscripts found in the British Library and compiled in William Sandys Wright Vaux's edition of The World Encompassed, based on a log kept by Drake's chaplain, Francis Fletcher. This material contains a number of statements by Doughty that may have been made in the heat of anger. The statements could be interpreted as seditious, but would not be likely to be judged mutinous by a court of law (examined at length in Robinson and Hannay; the charges are reproduced in Vaux). There were two very damning pieces of evidence: the testimony of Edward Bright, the ship's carpenter, which, alone of the accusations, Doughty openly denied, and Doughty's own admission that he had disclosed the true purpose of their voyage to William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, a staunch advocate of avoiding trouble with the Spanish. Drake painted the disclosure to Burghley as a betrayal of Queen Elizabeth; nevertheless, the jury of crewmen convicted Doughty of mutiny only, rejecting the charge of treason, and only after Drake prevaricated about whether he would seek Doughty's death. After obtaining the guilty verdict, Drake convened the jury and produced various documents from English nobility in support of Drake; he did not, however, produce a royal commission, which he claimed to have left on board his ship. Arguing that Doughty was a threat to his life and the expedition in general, Drake demanded execution. The men eventually agreed although some reluctantly; Drake then asked if there were any reasonable proposals of alternative solutions. Doughty himself suggested that he be set loose once the fleet reached Peru, but Drake refused, claiming that Doughty would alert the Spaniards to their mission. John Wynter volunteered to keep Doughty prisoner on his ship, Elizabeth, to which Drake initially agreed, but qualified the statement by saying that the ship would then have to return to England with no share of the treasure they would gain from attacking Spanish ships. Wynter was soon shouted down by his crewmen, and Doughty's fate was sealed.Kelsey, pp.108‚Äì109 Doughty requested that he and Drake receive Communion together, and as reported by the contemporary account of Francis Fletcher, \\"And after this holy repast, they dined also at the same table together, as cheerfully, in sobriety, as ever in their lives they had done aforetime, each cheering up the other, and taking their leave, by drinking each to other, as if some journey only had been in hand.\\" On 2 July 1578, Thomas Doughty was beheaded. Shortly thereafter, Drake changed the name of his flagship from The Pelican to The Golden Hind purportedly to honour Christopher Hatton, whose crest was the hind, perhaps as an attempt to smooth over the Doughty incident. Aftermath and analysis The conditions of the case ‚Äì the initial close friendship of the men, the unlikely amicability of Doughty upon his demise ‚Äì have inspired numerous theories as to what may have truly transpired between Doughty and Drake. Drake's own family eventually perpetuated the rumour that Doughty had been intimate with Drake's wife, Mary.Kelsey, p.110; Sugden 112. Other historians have speculated that Doughty had been a spy in the employ of Burghley throughout the voyage.Corbett p.220 Analysis indicates, however, that not all of the men wished to be a part of what was swiftly becoming a pirate raid; John Wynter specifically spoke against it. Kelsey concludes that Drake wanted to set a stern example against indiscipline in the crew; his choice to hold Doughty's trial on the same spot where Ferdinand Magellan had executed his mutineers could hardly have been coincidental. Nevertheless, the rest of the circumnavigation was plagued by bouts of dissent. In January 1580, when Drake became stranded upon a reef off the Celebes Sea, the ship's chaplain Francis Fletcher gave a sermon connecting their woes to the unjust demise of Doughty. For this action, Drake not only relieved Fletcher of his duties but chained him to a hatch cover and, despite his obvious lack of authority to do so, pronounced him excommunicated. The Doughty incident continued to haunt Drake upon his return to England. There, John Doughty, brother of the deceased, sought legal recourse, but the action was dismissed on a technicality.Senior, p.295. There was also gossip about the inexplicable promotion of the carpenter, Edward Bright, to the position of master of the ship Marigold, which was inevitably read as payment for falsifying testimony against Doughty. Drake was never able to produce documents showing he had clear authority to act as he did. There was even a rumour, almost certainly false, that Drake was under hire by the Earl of Leicester to kill Doughty. According to the contemporary screed Leicester's Commonwealth (1584), Leicester desired Doughty's death because Doughty could incriminate him in the alleged murder of Walter Devereux, Earl of Essex. John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, refers to the Doughty incident in his poem \\"Portsmouth's Looking Glass,\\" as if it is a casual reference to judicial malfeasance that his readership will immediately recognise. In popular culture Doughty's execution is the subject of Robert E. Howard's Solomon Kane poem, \\"The One Black Stain.\\" In the episode of the 1960s UK children's TV series Sir Francis Drake 'The Doughty Plot', the story of how Doughty was tried and executed is recounted, though it is not historically accurate and makes Drake out as the hero. In 1980, \\"Drake's Venture\\", a full costume drama of the key events was made for television, with John Thaw as Francis Drake and Paul Darrow as Thomas Doughty.

One of the writings that influenced the Master was Saint Augustine's Letter 211, which was sent to a community of women founded by Augustine in the city of Hippo. Augustines's writings were well known in the West in the sixth century (though unknown in the East until several centuries later) and his texts on religious or monastic life were considered standard. The writings of John Cassian are also indicated.Feiss OSB, Hugh. \\"Humility\\", The Monastery of the Ascension, Jerome, Idaho Influence The Regula Magistri is three times as long as Benedict's rule. It was possibly used by St Benedict as source material for his own \\"Rule\\". The structure of the Rules is similar, and there are parallel passages. However, Benedict did not simply copy the Regula Magistri. He deleted some sections, and adapted others based on his own experience, placing more emphasis on fraternal love. Benedict's Rule demonstrates a more positive view of human nature than the Master.Fortin OSB, John R., \\"Saint Augustine's Letter 211 in The Rule of the Master and The Rule of Saint Benedict\\", Journal of Early Christian Studies, vol. 14, No.2, Summer 2006, pp.225-234 There is no historical record of the Regula Magistri having ever been used by any particular monastic community.

It consists of a Java and a C++ implementation of the SOAP server, and various utilities and APIs for generating and deploying Web service applications. Using Apache Axis, developers can create interoperable, distributed computing applications. Axis development takes place under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation. Axis for Java When using the Java version of Axis there are two ways to expose Java code as Web service. The easiest one is to use Axis native JWS (Java Web Service) files. Another way is to use custom deployment. Custom deployment enables you to customize resources that should be exposed as Web services. See also Apache Axis2. JWS Web service creation JWS files contain Java class source code that should be exposed as Web service. The main difference between an ordinary java file and jws file is the file extension. Another difference is that jws files are deployed as source code and not compiled class files. The following example will expose methods add and subtract of class Calculator. public class Calculator { public int add(int i1, int i2) { return i1 + i2; } public int subtract(int i1, int i2) { return i1 - i2; } } =JWS Web service deployment= Once the Axis servlet is deployed, you need only to copy the jws file to the Axis directory on the server. This will work if you are using an Apache Tomcat container. In the case that you are using another web container, custom WAR archive creation will be required . =JWS Web service access= JWS Web service is accessible using the URL http://localhost:8080/axis/Calculator.jws . If you are running a custom configuration of Apache Tomcat or a different container, the URL might be different. Custom deployed Web service Custom Web service deployment requires a specific deployment descriptor called WSDD (Web Service Deployment Descriptor) syntax. It can be used to specify resources that should be exposed as Web services. Current version (1.3) supports * RPC services * EJB - stateless (Enterprise Java Bean) =Automated generation of WSDL= When a Web service is exposed using Axis it will generate a WSDL file automatically when accessing the Web service URL with ?WSDL appended to it. Axis for C++ An example for implementing and deploying a simple web-service with the C++ version of Axis can be found in the Axis-CPP Tutorial (link in the Reference section below). The steps necessary are: * Create the wsdl file * Generate client and server stubs using wsdl2ws * Provide the server side web service implementation (e.g. the add method of the calculator service) * Build the server-side code and update the generated deploy.wsdd with the .dll path * Deploy the binaries to the directory specified in the wsdd * Build client * Run and enjoy...

Such an archive is called a solid archive. It is used natively in the 7z and RAR formats, as well as indirectly in tar-based formats such as .tar.gz and .tar.bz2. By contrast, the ZIP format is not solid because it stores separately compressed files (though solid compression can be emulated for small archives by combining the files into an uncompressed archive file and then compressing that archive file inside a second compressed ZIP file). Explanation Compressed file formats often feature both compression (storing the data in a small space) and archiving (storing multiple files and metadata in a single file). One can combine these in two natural ways: * compress the individual files, and then archive into a single file; * archive into a single data block, and then compress. The order matters (these operations do not commute), and the latter is solid compression. In Unix, compression and archiving are traditionally separate operations, which allows one to understand this distinction: * Compressing individual files and then archiving would be a tar gzip-compressed files this is very uncommon. * Archiving various uncompressed files via tar and compressing yields a compressed archive: a .tar.gz file this is solid compression. Rationale=Benefits Solid compression allows for much better compression rates when all the files are similar, which is often the case if they are of the same file format. It can also be efficient when archiving a large number of small files. Costs On the other hand, getting a single file out of a solid archive requires processing all the files before it, so modifying solid archives could be slow and inconvenient. On newer formats such as 7-zip, there is a solid block size option that allows for the concatenated data block to be split into individually-compressed smaller blocks, so that only a limited amount of data in the block must be processed in order to extract one file. Parameters control the maximum solid block window size, the number of files in a block, and whether blocks are separated by file extension. Additionally, if the archive becomes even slightly damaged, some of the data (sometimes even all data) after the damaged part in the block can be unusable (depending on the compression and archiving format), whereas in a non-solid archive format, usually only one file is unusable and the subsequent files can usually still be extracted.

It is owned by the Municipality of Anchorage and operated by SMG, a nationwide property management company. For hockey, the Sullivan Arena offers 6,251 seats with a standing room capacity of 6,451. If areas designated for wheel chairs are included, the arena can seat 6,290, plus standing room, during hockey games. The arena is noted for having an international-dimension (Olympic-sized) ice rink (61 m √ó 30 m / 200 ft √ó 98.5 ft) instead of the NHL dimensions (200 ft √ó 85 ft / 61 m √ó 25.9 m) common among North American venues. The main arena floor contains 32,000 square feet of space. In 2014, a new center-hung scoreboard, with four 8-by-8-foot video screens and a wraparound LED display system was installed to replace the 80s style scoreboard which had a black-and-white dot matrix display. The new scoreboard was previously installed at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California where it was used by the ECHL affiliate of the San Jose Sharks, the San Francisco Bulls. The Bulls purchased the scoreboard for their first season in 2012 but the team folded less than two years later. The scoreboard is made by Colosseo, a European company specializing in stadium and arena LED and entertainment technology.http://www.adn.com/article/20140308/new-scoreboard- will-bring-sullivan-arena-video-age There are currently plans, projected for 2015, for the neighboring Mulcahy Stadium to be demolished and rebuilt to its west in order to create 400 new parking spaces for the Arena.http://www.adn.com/article/20131225/city-boosters-eye-moving-mulcahy- ballpark-new-sullivan-arena-parking In addition, all seats and telescopic risers inside Sullivan Arena were replaced, the arena floor was rebuilt, and its ice-making equipment was upgraded for the 2015-16 hockey season. With the loss of the Aces, which leaves the Seawolves and WWE wrestling as sole tenants of the arena, another renovation in 2017 expanded the arena's storage space by 5,000 square feet, replaced the arena's portable stage, floor seating and artificial turf, and improved the arena's acoustics.

He is known as a great reformer of the order.  Personal life  He was born around 1109, although no exact date is recorded. The Obituary at Reims gives his death as 2 January 1169. He was the youngest of a family of boys, the children of Lord Godfrey de Blanchefort of Guyenne. He trained in combat from a young age, but during his time as Grand Master, placed more emphasis on reform and negotiation. This helped to foster the Templars image as guardians, not brutes.  Military record  His earliest action as Grand Master was with Baldwin III of Jerusalem, with whom he fought against Nur ad-Din Zangi. However, he was taken prisoner after King Baldwin was defeated at Banyas in 1157. The defeat allowed an ambush to be set for Blanchefort, who had dismissed his Frankish soldiers after battle ceased. He was held in captivity for three years in Aleppo before being released to Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus when the emperor made peace with Nur ad-Din. Bertrand accompanied King Amalric I during the expedition against Egypt in 1163. The expedition ended in failure, despite the considerable numbers the Christians could draw upon. Bertrand refused to participate in a second expedition in 1168, as heavy losses were almost certain. He was succeeded by Philip of Milly.  Reform  Blanchefort petitioned the Pope to use the title, \\"Master by Grace of God\\", which fitted the Templar's position as rising stars in the church, a favor which Rome gladly granted. His internal reforms were more important however. He wrote the \\"Retraits\\", which established structure within the order. This meant knights had clearer roles and protocols. He also established checks within the leaderships of the order, which stopped future Grand Masters deciding the direction of the Templars, without the backing of the knights. His work on creating negotiating roles within the order is also worth noting. After the failed expedition to Egypt, it was the Templars that helped draw up a peace treaty.  In popular culture  From the 1960s onwards it has erroneously been asserted that Bertrand de Blanchefort was related to a family of the same name located near Rennes-le-Ch√¢teauG√©rard de S√®de, L‚ÄôOr de Rennes, later published as Le Tr√®sor Maudit de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau(1967).

It refers to meat dishes prepared or served together with a light gravy, or broth, made from the fluids secreted by the meat as it is cooked.. In French cuisine, cooking au jus is a natural way to enhance the flavour of dishes, mainly chicken, veal, and lamb. In American cuisine, the term is mostly used to refer to a light sauce for beef recipes, which may be served with the food or placed on the side for dipping.\\"Justin Quek: Passion & Inspiration\\", Justin Quek with Tan Su-Lyn, Bon Vivant Publishing Pte Ltd, 2006, Page 30 Ingredients and preparation In order to prepare a natural jus, the cook may simply skim off the fat from the juices left after cooking and bring the remaining meat stock and water to a boil. Jus can be frozen for six months or longer, but the flavor may suffer after this time.Labensky and Hause (1999), On Cooking, Prentice-Hall In American recipes au jus often use soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, white or brown sugar, garlic, beets, carrots, onions, or other ingredients to make something more like a gravy. The American jus is sometimes prepared separately, rather than being produced naturally by the food being cooked. An example could be a beef jus made by reducing beef stock to a concentrated form, (also known as Glace de Viande) to accompany a meat dish. It is typically served with the French dip sandwich. Jus can also be made by extracting the juice from the original meat and combining it with another liquid e.g. red wine (thus forming a red wine jus). A powdered product described as jus is also sold, and is rubbed into the meat before cooking or added afterwards. Powdered forms generally use a combination of salt, dried onion, and sometimes sugar as primary flavoring agents. Use as noun In the United States, the phrase au jus is fairly often used as a noun, owing to its having been corrupted in culinary references into the noun form: rather than a \\"sandwich au jus\\", the menu may read \\"sandwich with au jus\\".

The term is nowadays often used in Morocco to refer to a hotel or guest house-style accommodation with shared common areas and private rooms, often within a restored traditional mansion. History Fes. Although it follows the model of a Moroccan courtyard house, it does not have a garden like a true riad. The term riad originates from the Arabic term for garden, (riyad).Blaser, Werner. (2004). Courtyards in Marrakech. Basel, Switzerland: Publishers for Architecture. Historically, the term referred to a common but specific type of interior garden: one that is symmetrically divided into four parts along its central axes and typically has a fountain at its middle. Riad architecture ultimately has ancient roots in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern domestic architecture. Houses centered around inner courtyards existed across the ancient Greco-Roman world and, before that, in the ancient Middle East. Interior gardens are also an ancient feature of domestic architecture in the Middle East, and the geometrically arranged gardens of Islamic architecture derive from Iranian civilization in particular. Archaeological remains of similar gardens have been found in and around ancient Mesopotamia, and the evolution of such gardens can be found in the grand geometrically-arranged gardens of later Iranian and Indian architecture, known as chahar bagh. A large riad garden in Marrakesh currently known as Le Jardin Secret (The Secret Garden) In addition to the existing influences of Greco-Roman culture in the Mediterranean, the formation of the Islamic world after the 7th century also spread and established these architectural models across the region and all the way to al-Andalus in the Iberian Peninsula. The ancient Roman city of Volubilis also provided reference for the beginnings of riad architecture during the Idrisid Dynasty in Morocco.Boele, Vincent. Ed. (2005). Morocco: 5000 years of Culture. Amsterdam: KIT Publishers. Interior gardens were a popular feature of palace architecture in the Islamic world because water and greenery were associated with images of paradise in Islam. Prominent examples in al-Andalus (Spain under Muslim rule) were found at Madinat al-Zahra, the Aljaferia, and the Alhambra. When the Almoravids conquered al-Andalus in the 11th century they sent Muslim, Christian and Jewish artisans from al-Andalus to Morocco to work on monuments.Parker, R. (1981). A Practical Guide to Islamic Monuments in Morocco. Charlottesville, Virginia: Baraka Press. p.14 The earliest known example of a true riad garden (with a symmetrical four-part division) in Morocco was found in the Almoravid palace built by Ali ibn Yusuf in Marrakesh in the early 12th century. The era of the Almoravids and their successor dynasties (such as the Almohads, the Marinids, and the Nasrids) was a formative period of Moroccan architecture and of wider Moorish architecture during which the model of the riad garden was perfected and established as a standard feature of interior secular or palace architecture in the region. It was particularly successful and common in Marrakesh, where the combination of climate and available space made it well-suited to the architecture of the bourgeois mansions and royal palaces built throughout the city's history. Architecture alt=The 18th-century riad Chbanate in leftThe riad is one of the main types of a traditional Moroccan house, often with two or more stories around an Andalusian-style courtyard that centered around a fountain. Riads were the stately city homes of the wealthiest citizens such as merchants and courtiers.Messier, Ronald A. (2010) The Almoravids and the Meanings of Jihad. Santa Barbara, California: Praeger. p.126 In many cases, especially for palaces, the gardens were surrounded by a gallery. Moroccan houses were inward focused, which allowed for family privacy and protection from the weather. This inward focus was expressed with a centrally placed interior garden or courtyard, and the lack of large windows on the exterior walls of rammed earth or mud brick. This design principle also found support in the social mores of Islamic society, which placed great value on privacy and encouraged a separation between private family spaces (where women lived and worked) and semi-public spaces where outside guests were received. The central gardens of traditional riads wre often planted with fruit trees such as orange trees or lemon trees. The walls of the riads could be adorned with tadelakt plaster, stucco decoration, and zellige tiles, sometimes with Arabic calligraphy and quotes from the Quran.. The book provides photographs of several of the most elegantly-restored Marrakech Riads. Saadian-period mansion in the Mouassine district of Marrakesh The style of these riads has changed over the years, but the basic form is still used in designs today. Recently there has been a surge in interest in this kind of house with a wave of renovation in towns such as Marrakech and Essaouira, where many of these often-crumbling buildings have been restored to their former glory as hotels or restaurants. Many of the crumbling or ruined properties in Marrakech have been bought by foreigners. This foreign interest has brought new challenges but the investment has helped with the restoration of the UNESCO site and has helped revive many of the handcrafts and artisan trades that were gradually being lost before this trend. Many of the restored riads in the districts of Mouassine and Lakssour offer the finest examples of restoration as historically these areas contained many of the grand palaces from Marrakech's Saadian period.

Spiles can also be used to broach water from trees. Ale use Cask ale is dispensed without the addition of externally supplied gas. That it is served \\"flat\\" with no bubbles at all, though, is a misconception. Properly conditioned cask ale will have enough dissolved carbon dioxide to produce bubbles of carbon dioxide. This has been generated by the natural action of the yeast living in the beer while it is stored and transported. In fact, the yeast can produce more carbon dioxide than is required, and it is for this reason that the cask is vented through the hole in the shive. When it is first delivered to the place where beer will be poured from it or where it will be connected to the beer engine, the cask is sealed. It has a keystone (where the tap will be driven in) and a shive (through which it was it was filled). Once it has been laid down in the location at which the beer is going to be dispensed, a venting punch is used to pierce the shive, which is either partially pre-drilled or has a hardwood tutt sealing the completely drilled hole. This breaks the seal, and the tap can then be driven into the keystone ‚Äì if it is hammered in when there is still a high internal pressure, it can be blown out again, with embarrassing consequences. To allow the loss of excess gas, soft spiles, made of open- grained softwood, bamboo, or harder wood with cuts in, are used. Once the cellarman judges this process to be complete, a hard spile is inserted which does not allow any more gas out. These are made of harder wood (usually still technically \\"softwood\\", but denser and more solid than soft spiles). When beer is being drawn from the cask this is removed and can be replaced by a soft spile, or left open. When no beer is being dispensed a hard spile is put back in. Plastic spiles are also available.. Once the spile is reinserted, enough gas will be generated by the yeast to replace the volume of gas that will have come out of solution. But the amount of carbon dioxide that can be produced is limited, so a hard spile is kept in as much as possible. This is one of the reasons for real ale's short shelf-life once a cask is opened ‚Äì if too much carbon dioxide is lost, the beer will become flat. Typically, the beer will be good only for two to four days; this short shelf life is why it is important that a pub serving real ale have sufficient turnover for casks to be emptied while still at their best.  Other uses for spiles  Like many such older terms, the word spile has other local meanings. For example: * Tapper, an implement used to tap any sort of tree, e.g. for birch sap, maple syrup, rubber tapping, palm wine from a toddy palm * The iron or wood spigot driven into a sugar maple to produce maple syrup. * At Indian Harbour in Nova Scotia, the shores on which fish processing \\"stores\\" were located were called spiles. * A Spile is also a term used in boatbuilding to describe the means/actions which a builder uses to determine the shape of any curved piece needing to be fitted to a curved surface. * A wooden stake or fence post. In popular culture A spile is utilized to obtain water in the novel Catching Fire and subsequent film The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. The spile consists of a tube with one end sharpened and the other split. When pounded into a tree, a stream of fresh water flows from the tube. Most of the year, this is not consistent with the nature of trees, as water diffuses upward through very tiny capillary passages. When a tree is cut down, water does not flow out of the cut surface. The technique used in the movie would only work in early spring or late winter, when the watery sap runs high in the trees. The taps that are placed in maple trees are placed into drilled holes and the resultant fluid is sap, not water.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Athletics, St. Louis Browns, Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox, and Boston Red Sox. Although Hayes was considered one of the best catchers in the American League in the late 1930s and early 1940s, he played for an Athletics team that routinely finished in last place. A six-time All-Star, he holds the major league record of most consecutive games played by a catcher. Early years Born and raised in Jamesburg, New Jersey, Hayes was nicknamed \\"Blimp\\", even though he was listed at and . He first caught the attention of an umpire who then recommended him to Connie Mack, the owner and manager of the Philadelphia Athletics. Philadelphia Athletics Hayes made his major league debut with the Athletics on September 21, 1933, at the age of 18, making him the youngest player in the league at the time. He was hitless in five at bats that season. After the Athletics' regular catcher, Charlie Berry, suffered an injury in 1934, Hayes took his place and set a major league record for most games caught in a season by a teenager when he appeared in 92 games as a nineteen-year-old. In September , Hayes joined a group of American baseball players led by Connie Mack in a barnstorming tour of Japan when Charlie Berry, who had originally been selected to go, was struck with appendicitis. Among the baseball players who joined Hayes in Japan were Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx and Charlie Gehringer. He was sent to the minor leagues in , where he played for the Buffalo Bisons and the Albany Senators of the International League. Hayes returned to the major leagues in , replacing Paul Richards as the Athletics starting catcher, a position he held for six seasons. On July 25, 1936, he tied a major league record by hitting 4 doubles in a game against the Cleveland Indians. In 1939, Hayes earned his first All- Star selection when he was named as a reserve behind Bill Dickey on the American League team in the 1939 All-Star Game. He ended the year with a .283 batting average along with career-highs of 20 home runs and 83 runs batted in. His batting average improved in 1940, when he posted a .308 batting average with 16 home runs and 70 runs batted in. Hayes' on-base percentage also improved from .348 in 1939 to .389, and was once again named as a reserve player for the American League team in the 1940 All-Star Game. He had another respectable season in 1941, hitting for a .280 average along with 12 home runs and 63 runs batted in, and for the third consecutive year, was named to as a reserve player for the American League in the 1941 All-Star Game. Despite his contributions, the Athletics finished in last place for the second consecutive season. Brief stint with the Browns In January 1942, Hayes had a knee operation which delayed his appearance at spring training and consequently caused him to gain weight. This setback along with the impressive performance by his replacement, Hal Wagner, made Hayes dispensable and on June 1, 1942, he was traded to the St. Louis Browns for Bob Harris and Bob Swift. After hitting for only a .188 batting average in 1943, it appeared as if his baseball career might be at an end when Connie Mack brought him back to the Athletics in a trade for Sam Zoldak in February 1944. Back in Philadelphia, his career was rejuvenated, producing a career-high 144 hits in 581 at bats, for a .248 batting average, with 13 home runs, 18 doubles, 6 triples and led the Athletics with 78 runs batted in while batting as their cleanup hitter. Hayes caught every one of the Athletics' 155 games and led American League catchers in games played, putouts, assists, and in baserunners caught stealing. He was also named to the American League All-Star team for the fourth time in his career and, ranked 14th in the American League Most Valuable Player Award balloting. Cleveland Indians Although Hayes was rated as one of the top catchers in Major League Baseball, he had a reputation for being temperamental and, this may have played a role in Mack's decision to trade him to the Cleveland Indians for catcher Buddy Rosar in May 1945. Contemporary news reports expressed astonishment over the trade, as Hayes was considered one of the best catchers in the league while Rosar was refusing to play for the Indians due to a salary dispute. Hayes immediately assumed the starting catcher's role for the Indians, leading American League catchers with 145 games played and a .988 fielding percentage.Baseball Digest, July 2001, P.86, Vol. 60, No. 7, He was selected to be a reserve catcher for the American League in the 1945 All-Star Game however, the game was cancelled due to wartime travel restrictions. From October 2, 1943, to April 21, 1946, Hayes caught 312 consecutive games, a record for major league catchers that has never been broken. Hayes was the Indians catcher on April 30, , when Bob Feller threw a no hitter and, he provided the only run of the game with a ninth-inning home run. Chicago White Sox In the middle of the season while mired in a hitting slump, Hayes had a falling out with Indians' manager Lou Boudreau over being benched in favor of Sherm Lollar. Five days after starting for the American League in the 1946 All-Star game, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox. He was released by the White Sox after the 1946 season then, signed with the Boston Red Sox as a free agent. He was given his unconditional release by the Red Sox on May 17, 1947, at the age of 32. Career statistics In a fourteen-year major league career, Hayes played in 1,364 games, accumulating 1,164 hits in 4,493 at bats for a .259 career batting average along with 119 home runs, 585 runs batted in and a .343 on- base percentage. He ended his career with a .977 fielding percentage. He compiled 30 career stolen bases along with 213 doubles and 32 triples. During his career, he was named to six All-Star teams. He led the American League three times in total chances per game, twice each in putouts, double plays, and once each in assists and fielding percentage as a catcher. When he caught 155 games in 1944, he set a still-standing American League record for games played in a season as catcher.Frankie Hayes in Baseball Digest, August 1978, Vol. 37, No. 8, His accomplishment of 312 consecutive games caught remains an unbroken major league record. Hayes' 29 double plays in 1945 is the second- highest season total ever for a catcher, behind Steve O'Neill's record of 36, set in 1916. Later life Hayes operated a sporting goods store in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, after his playing career. He died at the age of 40 in Point Pleasant in , eight years after retiring as a professional baseball player. His family declined to reveal the cause of his death.

Fulton's riding of Scarborough East was among those who received an illegal contribution. On August 2, when Peterson shuffled his cabinet in the wake of the scandal, Fulton was not included. The Liberals were defeated in the 1990 provincial election, and Fulton lost his seat by 1,774 votes to Bob Frankford of the Ontario New Democratic Party. The Liberal Party asked him to run again in the 1995 election, but he declined the offer in order to spend more time on his consulting business.

It is part of the North Charleston Convention Center Complex, which also includes a Performing Arts Center, and is owned by the City of North Charleston and managed by SMG. The Coliseum was built in 1993 (the Performing Arts Center and Convention Center opened in 1999), and is located on the access road to the Charleston International Airport. The Coliseum is home to the ECHL's South Carolina Stingrays professional ice hockey team and serves as an alternate home for the Charleston Southern University basketball team. It is the area's primary venue for concerts and other major indoor events expected to draw large crowds. The Coliseum is currently undergoing an expansion project intended to increase concourse space, provide additional points of sale, and create venues for banquets, receptions, and other smaller-scale events. The arena contains 9,875 permanent seats, including 7,175 in the upper deck, and 1,646 riser seats. Tenants The Coliseum is the current home of the South Carolina Stingrays, a minor league professional ice hockey team that plays in the ECHL. When construction first began on the arena there were no plans to include ice-making equipment. However, after an ECHL franchise application for the city of North Charleston had been pre-approved by the league in April 1992, the city council approved the funds required for the installation of an ice surface into the building that was already well under construction. The Stingrays began play there for the 1993-94 ECHL season. It is the alternate home arena for the Charleston Southern University basketball team. Typically, Charleston Southern University uses the Coliseum for non-conference games that draw audiences greater than their home arena's 798-seat capacity, such as cross-town rivals College of Charleston and The Citadel. Furthermore, its size allows them to play major conference teams such as Virginia Tech at home (some major conference arenas do not seat 10,000). In addition, the North Charleston Coliseum has hosted the Big South Conference (1993‚Äì94) and the Southern Conference basketball tournaments. The Coliseum has previously hosted arena and indoor football teams, as well as a National Basketball Development League team, as well as an all female production of Ben Hur that drew several noise and indecency complaints. Events In addition to sporting events, the arena hosts concerts, comedy shows and various other events. The Coliseum has served as the venue for several televised events, to include In Your House 8: Beware of Dog pay-per-view after the Florence Civic Center's infrastructure failed (1996), WCW Uncensored (1997), Shania Twain (2004), WWE Raw (2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2013, 2015), PBR Built Ford Tough Series (2006), Wheel of Fortune (2006), and American Idol (2007, 2011) and The X Factor (2013) auditions. Other major concerts and events have included KISS playing their final show with the original lineup (2000), Oprah Winfrey (2006), Walking with Dinosaurs (2008), a CNN Presidential Debate (2012), a Fox Business Presidential Debate (2016), Kid Rock (2008, 2011), Taylor Swift (2009), The Dave Matthews Band (in 1996, and since 2005), Kenny Chesney (2011), Jay-Z (2013), Brad Paisley (2011, 2014), Prince (2011). and Trans-Siberian Orchestra's winter concerts and Beethoven's Last Night shows (2004-2012). The Coliseum hosted Metallica in '93 Nowhere Else to Roam Tour, Columbia's Hootie & the Blowfish with Greenville's Edwin McCain in '95, Gainesville's Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers in '95, Athens GA's R.E.M. in '95, Green Day in '95, Macon GA's Allman Brothers Band in '96, Pearl Jam in '96, Stone Temple Pilots in '97, Jay-Z in '99, and N'SYNC in 2000. The Beach Boys performed at the North Charleston Performing Arts Center in 2018 for their Reason for the Season Tour. History=Planning and construction Planning for the coliseum began in 1985, when a city- sponsored study determined that the city could support a venue seating 10,000-plus people. In October of that year, the McNair Realty and Development company of Greenville, South Carolina, who owned the Centre Pointe development tract, donated of that land valued at approximately $100,000 an acre to the city for construction of the coliseum. The coliseum was originally planned to be part of a redevelopment dubbed \\"City Center,\\" which was to include the coliseum, a convention center, a performing arts center, a transportation hub, a library, an art gallery and museum, an arts school, parking garages, and scenic park areas, and was to have been completed by 2000. As of June 2011, only the coliseum, convention center, and performing arts center have been completed. In September 1988, the city considered five architectural firms for design and supervision of the coliseum's construction, eventually settling on Odell Associates, Inc. City Council approved a $25 million budget for design and construction of the coliseum and by February 1991 accepted a $19.8 million bid for the construction contract by McDevitt and Street Co. of Charlotte, North Carolina. Construction began on April 29, 1991, with an estimated completion time of 20 months. In September 1992, the City Council approved $879,000 to fund installation of an ice rink in the coliseum, which at that time was scheduled for completion by December 26 of that year. The ECHL Board of Governors met in November 1992 to vote on bringing a hockey franchise (whose application had been pre-approved that April) to the Charleston area. At that meeting, the league approved creation of the expansion franchise for the 1993-94 ECHL season, giving the coliseum its first professional sports team as a tenant. Grand opening The coliseum opened its doors on January 29, 1993 to a capacity crowd with its first event, the World Cup Figure Skating Champions ice skating exhibition. The opening night was plagued by parking issues that resulted in traffic congestion on local roads and up to an hour delay in clearing the parking lots following the show. The following night saw another sellout crowd for a concert featuring country music star Alan Jackson, for which the traffic problems were reduced due to early arrivals and improved traffic direction. The city expedited the expansion of available parking spaces from 4,000 to 5,030 soon after. Accident On November 10, 1997, the 5-ton coliseum scoreboard dropped while it was being lowered, landing on and killing Billie Wayne Garrett, a rodeo volunteer from Columbia. Coliseum officials believed the issue was with the board's hoisting mechanism, which was manufactured by a New Jersey company that had recently experienced hoist failures in two of its mechanisms, one resulting in a scoreboard dropping to the floor. The fall also caused a crack in the coliseum floor, but it was repaired and no damage was found to have been done to the piping system that makes ice for the coliseum floor. Garrett's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the company that manufactured the scoreboard, the company that had recently inspected and passed the scoreboard, and Ogden Entertainment, the coliseum's managing company. The lawsuit was settled for $3.5 million. An upgraded scoreboard featuring improved video panels and a safer hoisting setup was installed in October 1999. This scoreboard was replaced in 2012 by another video scoreboard, part of a $21 million renovation that saw the addition of two food courts, the largest of which is the Montague Terrace, as well as a new ticket office and upgrades to eight luxury suites. New management In August 2000, Ogden Entertainment--which had managed the coliseum since its opening in 1993--was purchased by Aramark. Aramark urged city officials to transfer management of the coliseum to SMG, of which Aramark was a half owner at the time, in an effort to leverage SMG's entertainment industry connections to bring more concerts to the area. In an effort to bolster attendance at the coliseum, which had been operating at a loss for two years, SMG took over management of the coliseum in late 2001, agreeing to construct a large freestanding marquee visible from Interstate 526 as part of the management contract. Expansion An ambitious expansion project was approved for financing by the city of North Charleston in 2009. The expansion consists of extensions built onto the Coliseum's north and south entrances, increasing concourse space by and adding up to 40 additional points of sale for concessions. The expansion will allow for renovation of existing suites and upgrades to the Coliseum's sound system, spotlights, and rigging bridges. Construction on the south side extension, dubbed Montague Terrace, commenced in August 2010 with a planned completion date of October 2011. Construction of the north side extension was completed in 2012.

It featured sports newscasts twice an hour, and sports talk during the evening and overnight. Creation and programming Enterprise Radio was created by Scott Rasmussen, the son of Bill Rasmussen, who was the founder of ESPN. The all sports radio network went on the air in January 1981 and lasted until September 21, 1981. The network broadcast sports reports twice an hour and did live phone in sports talk from 6 pm to 8 am Eastern Time seven days a week. Talk show hosts and update announcers included John Sterling, the current voice of the New York Yankees; Don Chevrier, the longtime TV voice of the Toronto Blue Jays; network radio veterans John O'Reilly, Dan Davis and Bob Buck; Curt Chaplin, the announcer for the iconic TV show, The People's Court; Jay Howard, the radio voice of the San Antonio Spurs' first NBA championship; and Bill Denehy, a former major league pitcher. The network reached approximately 74 stations nationwide at its peak, with most local stations broadcasting the talk shows and the sports reports to supplement their local programming. ER also carried the 1981 Stanley Cup Finals and did extensive coverage of the National Sports Festival in Syracuse, New York. Network radio veteran John Chanin was the executive producer. Struggle to keep afloat While the station had hired over 100 reporters, announcers and producers from across the country, they failed to secure enough advertising to keep the operation afloat. The final six weeks of existence saw the staff go without pay, hoping an investor would save the network. It did not happen and the last broadcast was the overnight show with Greg Gilmartin that ended at 8 am on the 21st.

It comprised several advice-oriented call-in talk shows, the most notable personalities being Bruce Williams and Sally Jessy Raphael. At a time when talk radio was a mostly local format, Talknet, among similar services, brought the format to a national level. History Prior to the late 1970s, AM radio was still largely dominated by all-music formats. Many individual radio stations had introduced some talk programming to their lineups, but it was almost universally locally produced. The concept of national talk radio, broadcast over a radio network, had not been tried. In 1978, Larry King began broadcasting six hours of talk programming nightly on the Mutual Broadcasting System. His success in the field proved to radio programmers that there was an audience for both late-night talk programming and national talk radio programming. NBC and ABC were quick to enter the late- night talk radio market. ABC launched a nightly block of programming called TalkRadio and NBC launched Talknet. Programming At the time when Talknet was introduced, the Fairness Doctrine was still in place, requiring radio and television stations, among other things, to give equal time to both sides of controversial issues presented on the air. As a result, most radio stations avoided opinion programming and instead opted for call-in shows such as those featured on Talknet that were advice-oriented, with listeners calling in to ask questions and receive help with various issues and problems in their lives. Talknet premiered on 21 stations nationwide on Monday, November 2, 1981. Early affiliates included WRC Washington, WIOD Miami, KXL Portland, WJW Cleveland, KFBK Sacramento, WLW Cincinnati, KOB Albuquerque, WDAY Fargo, WOOD Grand Rapids, WCAR Detroit, and WSTV Steubenville, OH. Maurice Tunick was creator and executive producer. :Tunick: \\"I came up with the name 'Talknet' and created and developed the 'Dear Abby' format for Sally Jessy Raphael which I tested earlier that year on NBC's WRC in Washington D.C. Prior to Talknet the only radio advice shows were hosted by clinical psychologists. My idea for Sally was 'a friend.' Over the back fence advice. Someone to talk to, someone who cares (as the theme music said). A daring, revolutionary idea at the time. Sally was a well-traveled but unknown broadcaster at the time. Sally's TV show would start a couple of years later (1983), a direct result of her Talknet success. Much forgotten is that Bruce Williams originally aired at 10 PM Eastern to Midnight, and Sally Jessy Raphael aired Midnight to 3 AM Eastern time. That quickly changed, I'm not sure how long, maybe a couple of months, to 7-10 PM and 10-1 AM. The shows were a hit out of the box and stations asked for earlier feed time. Weekend programming was added a year later with Bernard Meltzer and Dr. Harvey Ruben.\\" Bruce Williams answered questions from listeners on issues related to money, personal finance, investments, business, and other similar topics. On December 5, 1982, Williams crashed while attempting to land his airplane in Princeton, New Jersey. Tunick: \\"He was critically injured and nearly clinically dead when he arrived at the Medical Center of Princeton. One week later Bruce was back on the air from his hospital room and did his show from there for a week before he was released and originated his program from home for the next three months. We were told at the time this was the first national radio show to originate from a hospital.\\" (Williams later said he was in a coma for 20 days following the crash, making his return to radio more like a month after the crash.) Sally Jessy Raphael hosted the 10 pm-1 am time slot and spoke to callers about issues involving relationships and their personal lives. Williams was a tentpole of the Talknet lineup and continued with the service until its demise. Raphael, however, remained as host for a total of six years, from 1981-1987. Following her departure, several other hosts filled the 10 pm-1 am slot, dispensing personal and relationship advice. These included Myrna Lamb, Lee Mirabal, Dara Welles and Neil Myers. Bruce Williams retired from broadcasting on March 29, 2013. Demise Tunick: \\"I left Talknet in late 1985 after being recruited by ABC Radio where I became Vice-President of Programming for the ABC Talkradio Network. I stayed close to Sally during the next year, knowing she had one year remaining on her contract. In late 1986, the radio world was shocked to learn Sally Jessy Raphael was jumping to ABC Radio. I also hired the legendary Tom Snyder to make Sally (7-10) and Tom (10-1) the new bookends of nighttime listening.\\" In 1986, NBC, along with its parent company, RCA, was purchased by General Electric. GE absorbed RCA primarily to acquire the NBC television network, and shortly thereafter sold the rest of the corporation's various other divisions. The NBC Radio Network was sold to Westwood One. NBC radio continued as a programming service through 1989. After that date, the NBC brand name continued to be used on some programming, but NBC radio no longer existed as a separate programming service. Westwood One continued the \\"Talknet\\" programming through the mid-1990s, but eventually dropped the \\"Talknet\\" name as well as the 10 pm-1 am personal advice programming. The time slot is currently held by Jim Bohannon, a carryover from the now retired Mutual Broadcasting System (which was acquired by Westwood One in 1985). Bruce Williams remained with Westwood One hosting his own individual program from 7 pm-10 pm for some years more, but eventually moved to the Talk America Radio Network (then owned by IDT) on June 25, 2001, and later Business Talk Radio Network until 2008. From 2008 to 2010, he self syndicated the show, which included a relay on the Sirius-XM channel also called \\"America's Talk\\" as well as on the Cable Radio Network. Raphael focused her efforts on television, but after her TV show was canceled, relaunched her show as \\"Sally JR's Open House\\", originally an Internet-only effort, but later transferred to radio syndication. Raphael's last radio show aired July 7, 2008.

The Mutual Black Network (MBN) was founded by the Mutual Broadcasting System in 1972 as the first national full-service radio network aimed at African Americans; it was initially branded as Mutual Reports before the branding change to MBN. With 98 affiliated stations across the United States, including flagship WBLS in New York, the network broadcast an hourly five-minute newscast at 50 minutes past the hour. It also aired sports and feature programs, and for one year beginning in the spring of 1974, a 15-minute daily soap opera called Sounds Of The City. Some of its special programming focused on African American history, much of which was researched, written and narrated by MBN news anchor Ben Frazier. Programming is what separated the Mutual Black Network from the rest of the pack. But its highest mark was made in the coverage of hard news and its savvy advocacy style of journalism. This was a genre of journalism, practiced by news anchors Ben Frazier, Glen Ford, John Askew and others. They would interview black news- makers who had largely been ignored by most traditional mass media outlets, including Mutual's main network. Thanks to the Mutual Black Network, those news-makers, their agenda, dreams and anger would finally make it to the forefront of the American body politic. Their sound bites made it to the air and to a new level of relevancy because of the Mutual Black Network's hourly newscasts. Tape editors James Barber and Gregory S. Kearse provided the bulk of sound bites for the hourly newscasts. Kearse produced the Soul of Entertainment hosted by legendary newsman Ed Castleberry and interviewed stars such as Gladys Knight, Glynn Turman and the Pointer sisters. Kearse began as a weekend tape editor in 1974 while completing his B.A. degree in English, and left MBN to pursue a career in book publishing at Howard University Press in 1978. In 1981, the Mutual Black Network was purchased by Sheridan Broadcasting, an African American-owned company which had been a minority stockholder in MBN, and renamed the Sheridan Broadcasting Network. A decade later, SBN merged with the rival National Black Network, forming the present- day American Urban Radio Networks.

Achaemenid king Darius I with the typical Persian cap. The origins of the papal tiara remain somewhat nebulous and clouded in mystery, first appearing in the Early Middle Ages, but developing a recognizable form in the High Middle Ages, after the Great Schism of 1054. The word tiara itself occurs in the classical annals to denote a Persian headdress, particularly that of the \\"great king\\". A camelaucum which was similar in shape to papal tiaras, was part of court dress in Byzantium; it was also inspired by the Phrygian cap, or frigium. Given that other rituals associated with the Papal Coronation, notably the use of the sedia gestatoria, were copied from Byzantine and eastern imperial ceremonial, it is likely that the tiara is also of Byzantine origin. First mention Pope Gregory the Great wearing the camelaucum. A form of papal crown is first mentioned in the vita of Pope Constantine (8th century) contained in the Liber Pontificalis; there it is called a camelaucum, a folded cap of white linen that was part of Byzantine court dress. A contemporary depiction of Gregory the Great (died 604) shows such a cap. Coins of Pope Sergius III (904-11) and Pope Benedict VII (974-983) depict these popes wearing such a helmet-like-cap augmented at the base with a single coronet-like fillet. It subsequently was mentioned in the supposed Donation of Constantine which is a forgery embedded among the forged Decretals in the early 9th century: Papal headgear Pope Leo VIII (963‚Äì964) in helmet-shaped tiara Popes since ancient times had worn some sort of head covering. By the 9th century it would appear that this took the form of a helmet-shaped white head-cap. Pope Gregory the Great (r. 590-604) is shown in contemporary artwork wearing such a headpiece. When exactly it developed its first lower tiara is unclear, though the Catholic Encyclopaedia speculates that it was in or around the 10th century, perhaps to distinguish the ceremonial papal head covering from the ecclesiastical one, the Mitre, which appeared around this era. The first explicit mention of the word tiara associated with the papacy appears in the account of the life of Pope Paschal II (r1099-1118) in the Liber Pontificalis. A decorated circlet or ornamental band which may be the origins of the first tier of the tiara, is shown on coins of Pope Sergius III (r. 904-911) and Pope Benedict VII (r. 974-983) Second tier Pope Benedict XI (1303‚Äì1304) in two-tier tiara Pope Nicholas I is thought to have been the first to unite the princely crown with the white headcovering. However the common belief that Pope Boniface VIII (r. 1294‚Äì1303) around 1300 added the second crown, is disputed. While an inventory of the papal treasures in 1295 suggests that the tiara had at that stage only one tier, Pope Innocent III (r. 1198-1216) is represented wearing a two tiered crown in a painting that predates Boniface. What is certain, from statues of Boniface made during his lifetime and which he saw (and so did not dispute the accuracy of), is that he wore a two-tiered tiara, so the two-tiered tiara originated no later than his reign. Two of these statues of Pope Boniface are in the crypt of St. Peter's Basilica. Why the second tiara was added is not formally stated in any documents, but historians such as James-Charles Noonan suggest that it may have been symbolic of growing papal claims to both temporal and spiritual power, the two tiers in the papal crown contrasting with the single tier of standard monarchical crowns. Third tier Pius X (1903‚Äì1914) in three-tier tiara The first notice of three crowns appears in an inventory of the papal treasures of the year 1315 or 1316. An effigy of Pope Benedict XII, which is on display in Avignon shows him wearing a three-tiered tiara. The lappets (two decorated strips of cloth which hang at the back of a tiara) are shown in paintings from the 13th century but may well have existed before then. A fresco in the Chapel of Saint Sylvester (consecrated in 1247) in the church of the Santi Quattro Coronati in Rome seems to represent the Pope wearing a tiara with two bands and with lappets. Chronology uncertain Constructing a certain chronology for the evolution of the three tiers on the papal tiara is problematical, given the lack of definitive records and conflicting evidence in contemporary artistic representation of popes. While it is certain that the three tiers had been introduced by the 14th century as late as the 15th century some representations were still appearing in art which showed the existence of a single-tiered tiara.

Faubert (April 25, 1931 ‚Äì June 20, 1999) was a Canadian provincial and municipal politician in Ontario, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Liberal from 1987 to 1990, and was the final Mayor of Scarborough before its amalgamation into the City of Toronto. Background Faubert was born in Scarborough, Ontario. He graduated from Scarborough Collegiate (now known as R. H. King Academy) and was later educated at the Ontario College of Art, receiving a degree in Fine Arts and Commercial Design. He worked as a communications consultant in private life. Faubert was also a member of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, the Knights of Malta (becoming a Knight of Grace in 1981) and the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. He married Marilyn Porter in 1956.

He is best known as the lead singer for the Serbian and Yugoslav rock band Riblja ƒåorba. Renowned for his brand of poetic lyrics and husky baritone voice, ƒêorƒëeviƒá is widely considered as one of the top and most influential authors of the Serbian and Yugoslav rock scene. Early life=ƒåaƒçak years ƒêorƒëeviƒá was born in ƒåaƒçak in 1952 to machinist father Dragoljub and mother Nerand≈æa, professor of Serbian. At age thirteen, he formed his first band, Hermelini (trans. The Ermines), with Borko Iliƒá (lead guitar), Prvoslav Saviƒá (rhythm guitar), and Aca Dimitrijeviƒá (drums). ƒêorƒëeviƒá played bass guitar and the band's sound was influenced by the Zagreb-based beat band Roboti. Two years later ƒêorƒëeviƒá switched to rhythm guitar and began writing lyrics/poetry. One of his earliest songs/poems, \\"Moje tuge\\", would later be recorded and released on Suncokret's debut single \\"Kara Mustafa\\" / \\"Moje tuge\\" as well as included on their debut album Moje bube. After Hermelini, ƒêorƒëeviƒá played with numerous ƒåaƒçak-based bands: Vesnici Ljubavi, Safiri, Deƒçaci sa Morave, and ƒåaƒçanski Plemiƒái. For a time, he was a member of PORS (Poslednji Ostatak Romantiƒçnog Sveta, trans. Last Remnants of Romantic World) with Radomir Mihailoviƒá Toƒçak on guitar. Simultaneously, teenage ƒêorƒëeviƒá, along with a group of friends, began breaking and entering into apartment units around his hometown ƒåaƒçak, looking for money and other valuables. Some of the stolen funds obtained this way were used to purchase musical equipment. After three years of committing burglaries, they were arrested and charged as juvenile delinquents. ƒêorƒëeviƒá spent seven days in prison detention before being released to await the sentencing. The sentence was soon delivered in the form of an order for \\"enhanced parental supervision and occasional control of the social services\\". Upon being released from prison detention, he got promptly expelled from the gymnasium he had been attending. Move to Belgrade ƒêorƒëeviƒá's parents decided to move the family to Belgrade where he enrolled at the Fifth Belgrade Gymnasium. For three years after arriving to Belgrade he didn't participate in any music-related activities. At the time of his matriculation, nineteen-year- old ƒêorƒëeviƒá auditioned for the staging of the Jesus Christ Superstar rock opera at Atelje 212, getting one of the apostle roles. Featuring Korni Grupa singer Zlatko Pejakoviƒá in the lead role of Jesus Christ, Branko Miliƒáeviƒá as Pontius Pilate, and acoustic singer-songwriter Srƒëan Marjanoviƒá as one of the priests, the show premiered in June 1972. It was performed 21 times over the next year until its last show in June 1973. ƒêorƒëeviƒá would continue acting in theatre, mostly as an extra, appearing in Atelje 212 plays Purpurno ostrvo, Tom Pejn, and Caca u metrou. Early career=Zajedno In late March 1973, twenty-year-old ƒêorƒëeviƒá formed the acoustic rock band Zajedno (Together) with three female vocalists ‚Äî Ivana Kaƒçunkoviƒá alongside twin sisters Vukica \\"Viki\\" and Gordana \\"Goca\\" Stefanoviƒá ‚Äî and keyboardist ƒêorƒëe Petroviƒá, all fellow students at the Fifth Belgrade Gymnasium. The band often recorded jingles for radio shows. On invitation from actor Zoran Radmiloviƒá, whom ƒêorƒëeviƒá had met while participating in the Jesus Christ Superstar staging at Atelje 212, the band joined a conceptual theatre tour named Selu u pohode. Featuring a somewhat hippie vibe, the summer 1973 tour, that in addition to Zajedno members and Radmiloviƒá also featured painter Zagorka Stojanoviƒá, visited numerous remote Socialist Republic of Serbia villages with the aim of exposing its inhabitants to various forms of arts and culture such as acoustic music, painting, and theatre. Zajedno's debut release, seven-inch single with tracks \\"Vizija\\" and \\"Goro moja\\", was released in 1974 by PGP RTB. ƒêorƒëeviƒá composed the music for the A-side track while the B-side track used the lyrics from the eponymous poem by Aleksa ≈†antiƒá. With liner notes written by radio disk jockey Zoran Modli who used the opportunity to draw comparisons to YU Grupa's debut single from four years prior, the release brought Zajedno a small measure of prominence. In May 1974, Zajedno members wrote the music for the theatre play Bonton (ili kako se pona≈°ati prema osobama suprotnog pola), starring Feƒëa Stojanoviƒá and Ru≈æica Sokiƒá, that was staged on Atelje 212's secondary 'Theatre in the Basement' stage. The play was performed 43 times over the following two years until the last show in May 1976 with Zajedno members ‚Äî ƒêorƒëeviƒá, Petroviƒá, and Ivana Kaƒçunkoviƒá ‚Äî in addition to Kaƒçunkoviƒá's sister Jasna appearing in acting roles as singers and musicians on stage. In parallel with being in Zajedno, young ƒêorƒëeviƒá worked numerous temporary side jobs. He was part of the production crew of the Radio Belgrade show Veƒçe uz radio that was created, hosted, and produced by the Yugoslav rock'n'roll media pioneers Nikola Karaklajiƒá and Peca Popoviƒá. ƒêorƒëeviƒá additionally filed radio reports from acoustic music festivals in Sivac, wrote articles for the D≈æuboks magazine about Yugoslav acoustic rock scene, and wrote a number of jingles for Beograd 202 and Studio B. He left Zajedno in late 1974. Suncokret In January 1975, ƒêorƒëeviƒá formed acoustic rock band Suncokret (Sunflower). They gained popularity with folk rock-oriented songs and ƒêorƒëeviƒá's humorous lyrics. Suncokret worked with disk jockey Zoran Modli (whom ƒêorƒëeviƒá met as a member of Zajedno when Modli produced Zajedno's first single) with whom they released the seven-inch single \\"Na putu za Stambol\\" / \\"Anƒëelija, ƒçuvaj se Turaka\\" under the name Hajduk Stanko i Jataci. Another single with Modli, \\"Rock and roll duku duku\\" / \\"Gili, gili bluz\\", was released under the name Zoran Modli i Suncokret. With Suncokret, ƒêorƒëeviƒá recorded three more singles and album Moje bube. Rani Mraz ƒêorƒëeviƒá left Suncokret after the band refused to perform his song \\"Lutka sa naslovne strane\\". He accepted ƒêorƒëe Bala≈°eviƒá's invitation and, with another former Suncokret member, female vocal Bilja Krstiƒá, became a member of Bala≈°eviƒá's band Rani Mraz. This was the most famous, but a short-lasting Rani Mraz lineup, and besides ƒêorƒëe Bala≈°eviƒá, Bora ƒêorƒëeviƒá and Bilja Krstiƒá featured female vocal Verica Todoroviƒá. This lineup held several performances in Dom omladine and Student's Cultural Centre in Belgrade. ƒêorƒëeviƒá performed songs \\"Lutka sa naslovne strane\\", \\"Mirno spavaj\\" and \\"Zvezda potkorvlja i suterena\\" (all of them will later be recorded on Riblja ƒåorba's debut album Kost u grlu) and Bala≈°eviƒá entertained the audience with his humorous stories. This Rani Mraz lineup recorded famous song \\"Raƒçunajte na nas\\", which praised People's Liberation War from a slightly different perspective than habitual socialist realism, and soon became an anthem of Yugoslav youth. This lineup also recorded single with songs \\"Oprosti mi, Katrin\\" and \\"≈Ωivot je more\\". Riblja ƒåorba Bora ƒêorƒëeviƒá in concert, 2008 After Rani Mraz performance on Split music festival and only forty-five days spent in the band ƒêorƒëeviƒá left Rani Mraz. After returning to Belgrade he formed hard rock band Riblja ƒåorba with SOS members Mi≈°a Aleksiƒá, Rajko Kojiƒá and Vicko Milatoviƒá. Their debut album Kost u grlu saw huge success and the band became very popular in a few months. The band's popularity grew, but it has also started manifesting in ƒêorƒëeviƒá's alcoholism, which has, together with his provocative social-related lyrics, caused him to become one of the most controversial musicians in Yugoslavia. He has remained a frontman and leader of Riblja ƒåorba from its formation to today. Solo projects ƒêorƒëeviƒá's unplugged performance with Arsen Dediƒá in Terazije Theatre in 1987 resulted in a famous bootleg album Arsen & Bora ƒåorba Unplugged \`87. Bora priƒça gluposti, released in 1988 features a recording of his poetry evening. In 1996 he released Njihovi dani on which he demonstrated his anti-Milo≈°eviƒá attitudes. Guest appearances and collaborations ƒêorƒëeviƒá made a guest appearance on numerous projects. With Minƒëu≈°ari he recorded controversial songs \\"E, moj dru≈æe zagrebaƒçki\\" and \\"Ljetovanje\\", released on Minƒëu≈°ari 1993 album Armija srpska. Other artist he recorded songs with include Bijelo Dugme, Balkan, Kerber, Zoran Predin, Arsen Dediƒá, Rambo Amadeus, Biljana Krstiƒá, Dejan Cukiƒá, Vlada i Bajka and others. He was also involved in recording of a cult compilation album Paket aran≈æman. He wrote songs for Zdravko ƒåoliƒá, Bisera Veletanliƒá, Generacija 5, ƒêorƒëe Marjanoviƒá, Neda Ukraden, Rajko Kojiƒá, Du≈°an Preleviƒá, Oliver Mandiƒá, ≈†aban ≈†auliƒá, Poslednja Igra Leptira, Denis & Denis, Viktorija, ≈Ωeljko Bebek, Lepa Brena, Ceca Ra≈ænatoviƒá, Zana, Prljavi Inspektor Bla≈æa i Kljunovi, Baja Mali Knind≈æa, Nedeljko Bajiƒá Baja and others. Literary work ƒêorƒëeviƒá signing his books at the Belgrade Book Fair ƒêorƒëeviƒá released his first book of poems Ravnodu≈°an prema plaƒçu (\\"Apathetic towards Crying\\") in 1985. In 1987 he released his second book of poems Hej, Sloveni (\\"Hey, Slavs\\") and in 1988 became a member of the Association of Writers of Serbia (UKS). ƒêorƒëeviƒá, reputedly, wrote the application on a table napkin. His membership in the Association of Writers of Serbia was not well received by some of the members. ƒêorƒëeviƒá released eight more books: * {{langsrPrvih deset godina je najte≈æe (First Ten Years Are the Hardest), * (I Don't Want To) * (A Psychopath and a Shovel) * (Serbs without Trouble) * * (What has the Poet meant to say) * {{langsrDebela tragedija}' (Fat Tragedy) * (Deserted island), Andriƒá's award, 2018. Politics and controversy Because of his provocative social and political-related lyrics, his support for Serbian nationalism coupled with his opposition to communism, Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and the political involvement as the Democratic Party of Serbia member, ƒêorƒëeviƒá was a subject of many controversies: *In 1984, after the release of Veƒçeras vas zabavljaju muziƒçari koji piju, the state's censors declared songs \\"Mangupi vam kvare dete\\" and \\"Besni psi\\" ethically unacceptable. \\"Besni psi\\" caused an international scandal. Because of the lyrics \\"Grƒçki ≈°verceri, arapski studenti, negativni elementi, maloletni delikventi i besni psi\\" (\\"Greek smugglers, Arabian students, negative elements, juvenile delinquents and mad dogs\\"), the embassies of three Arabian countries and Zaire protested, complaining that Bora ƒêorƒëeviƒá had equated foreign students and mad dogs. The Yugoslav Ministry of culture ordered an analysis of the song by the experts. *In 1985, record label Jugoton refused to publish four songs on Riblja ƒåorba's album Istina, thus prompting the band's re-signing with PGP-RTB, which refused to record only one song, \\"Snage opozicije\\" (\\"Opposition Forces\\"), which was not officially published until the issue of the compilation album Treƒái srpski ustanak in 1997. *In 1987, ƒêorƒëeviƒá was indicted for \\"disturbing the public\\" when he read his poems in Sava Centar, however the charges were dropped because he was reading poems already published in his books and in various magazines. *In 1988, after reading his poems in Bar, he was indicted for \\"insulting the working people of Yugoslavia\\", but these charges were also dropped. *After the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars, ƒêorƒëeviƒá became an active supporter of the Serbian troops in Republika Srpska and Republika Srpska Krajina which he demonstrated by recording controversial songs \\"E moj dru≈æe zagrebaƒçki\\" (which was recorded as a response to Jura Stubliƒá's song \\"E moj dru≈æe beogradski\\") and \\"Ljetovanje\\" with band Minƒëu≈°ari from Knin, but he was also strongly opposed to then- Serbian president Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and his administration as he demonstrated his attitude by writing a number of anti-government songs released on Riblja ƒåorba albums Zbogom, Srbijo, Ostalo je ƒáutanje and Nojeva barka and by publishing Njihovi dani in his own name rather than that of his band in 1996. In 1997, Riblja ƒåorba issued a compilation album Treƒái srpski ustanak (trans.

His family immigrated to the United States in 1815, when he was 2 years old, settling in Little York, Pennsylvania. While his mother had been a member of the Presbyterian Church while in Ireland, her husband was not affiliated with any sect. His father died when Andrew was 8 years old after a long illness. During this time the family was frequently visited by a Methodist minister, which resulted in the family becoming Members of the Methodist Church.The Arkansas Historical Quarterly The Arkansas Historical Quarterly Vol. 4, No. 3 (Autumn, 1945), pp. 234-240 Hunter attended college in Missouri for a short time before moving in 1835 he moved to Manchester, Missouri, near St. Louis, and began teaching school. While there he saw in a church paper a letter from Peter McGowan, the Superintendent of South Indian Missionary District urgently calling for teachers in Indian Schools. Hunter decided to travel the three hundred miles to the Indian Mission in Fort Gibson. At the time this was over very rough terrain through routes that typically followed streams, often having to sleep out in the open. The school consisted of around 20 students, and was located near where Kansas, Missouri and Texas Railroad crossed the Arkansas River North to Muskogee, in a yard donated by a Mr. Lott. Although Hunter was living in relative poverty, sleeping in a makeshift bed in the school house and eating with whomever would have him, Hunter considered this the happiest time of his life. In 1836, due to his service in the school, he was give a license to preach and a recommendation from the quarterly conference, which consisted mostly of Indians. The Arkansas Conference had been set up the same year, and Hunter was received \\"on trial.\\" The conference was divided into four districts, over which the presiding elders traveled quarterly. Hunter was first appointed to a missionary school at Bayou Baynard, and this began his long career as a Methodist minister. He was ordained a deacon in Fayetteville, Arkansas in 1839 he became an elder in Little Rock, Arkansas. In the fall of 1842 he was made presiding elder of the Washington District, which comprised a large portion of Southern Arkansas. He served as pastor of what is now First United Methodist Church in Little Rockhttp://fumclr.org/welcome/history/ twice, first appointed in 1842. He became one of the most popular preachers in Arkansas as well being well respected throughout the country.[https://books.google.com/books? Andrew Hunter was also somewhat of an historian and recorded numerous significant and interesting occurrences during those early days of Methodism. The January 24, 1838, issue of the Arkansas Gazette carried an advertisement for Lincoln‚Äôs Book Store in Little Rock . The ad listed Fr. Hunter‚Äôs Sacred Biography. He was married in York, Pennsylvania, in 1844, to Anna M. Jones, and had four children. Dr. James Anderson in his Centennial History of Arkansas Methodism says, ‚ÄúThere was a remarkable weight of character about the man, his personal dignity, his unselfish and blameless life, and his wisdom won the especial regard of all men.‚Äù One participant in an early revival held at Scott‚Äôs Campground described Hunter‚Äôs preaching: ‚ÄúOld Dr. Hunter‚Äôs favorite sermon was on the Prodigal Son. When he reached the climax and called for mourners, they filled the aisles.‚Äù id=6hUUAAAAYAAJ&dq;=robert%20c%20newton%20arkansas&pg;=PA978#v=onepage&q;=andrew%20hunter&f;=false Google Books] - Centennial history of Arkansas Volume 1 In 1866-67 he was elected to represent Dallas and Bradley Counties in the Arkansas State senate and was president of that body. In 1866 Hunter was elected US Senator from Arkansas by the State Legislature along with Elisha Baxter, however he was not allowed to take his seat in Congress due to disenfranchisement of Southern States at the beginning of Reconstruction. Augustus Hill Garland took his place instead. Dr. Hunter died on June 3, 1902, in his 89th year, after having held almost every office his church offered: teacher, missionary, pastor of both small and great churches, presiding elder for 20 years, delegate to Annual Conferences, a member of 12 General Conferences, and of the 1891 Ecumenical Conference. He was laid to rest in Oakland Cemetery, beside his wife. The Hunters were married in 1844 and had four children. Mrs. Hunter was active in establishing the Woman's Missionary Society of the Little Rock Conference in 1878. Elected president of the organization in 1879, she served in that office for five years. At the time of Hunter's death, Dr. John H. Riggin described him as a pulpiteer, saying: ‚ÄúHis mellow, vibrant voice made his speech impressive. His hearers soon understood that there was nothing rash or inconsiderate in his words, nothing light or trifling, nothing for show or merely to attract attention to the speaker, that the message ‚Äì not himself ‚Äì was his concern‚Ä¶‚Äù The Andrew Hunter House, a house he lived in, is near Bryant, Arkansas, built in c.1870 is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Hunter Memorial Methodist Church A newspaper clipping dated December 3, 1898, reads: ‚ÄúLast Sunday should be a red letter day in its history and one to be remembered by members of Hunter‚Äôs Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church, South. On that day was formally opened for public worship one of the prettiest, neatest, most comfortable and, in everything, completest houses dedicated to God that Little Rock has yet had built within her bounds. Well may the good folks of Hunter Memorial feel proud. With becoming modesty, they are loath to assume the credit for what has been done, giving praise to God first for enabling them to carry our that work which He has put in the mind of their reverend benefactor, Leon Le Fevre to design and plan for the,.‚Äù Aside note appeared in the 1947 publication stating that ‚ÄúLeon Le Fevre, member of a French family that had settled at the Little Rock site before the region became American territory, had bequeathed $2,800 in cash and a plantation, for the construction of a Methodist Church .‚Äù The Rev. James Major, pastor of Hunter Church from 1945 to 1948, wrote a history of the church for the 50th anniversary celebration which included the following statements: ‚ÄúIt was the life of Andrew Hunter that inspired a wealthy man by the name of Leon Le Fevre to leave in his will property valued at $5,000 to be sold and the proceeds used for the building of a Methodist Church east of what is now McArthur Park and south of East 9th Street.‚Äù The cornerstone for the first church was laid on March 27, 1897, on Barber Avenue, between 11th and 12th streets. Dr. Hunter dedicated the church on the last Sunday in March 1901, after all the indebtedness was paid.

When it began operations on October 1, 1979, the initial RKO network was the first new full- service American radio network in 40 years. Satellite distribution allowed high-fidelity (15 kHz) stereo programming to its affiliates. The original RKO Radio Networks logo News and programming The newscasts, aimed at a young adult audience, had a conversational, high-energy style developed by co- founders Vice President and News Director Dave Cooke, and Vice President of Programming Jo Interrante. RKO was popular from the start, signing up hundreds of affiliates coast to coast. Its base was the RKO General-owned radio stations in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and other large markets. RKO initially purchased downlink satellite dishes for its affiliates, creating the nation's first satellite-delivered commercial radio network. The original network, which fed newscasts at :50 repeated at :00, became known as RKO 1 when RKO 2 debuted on September 1, 1981. RKO 2 fed newscasts at :20 repeated at :30 and was aimed at an older audience. Both networks offered sportscasts, music, public affairs programming and closed-circuit affiliate feeds of news and sports correspondent reports and news-maker actualities. The networks were home to three groundbreaking long-form programs. NightTime America with Bob Dearborn was the first live, daily, satellite-delivered music show in radio history. Dearborn produced and hosted the five-hour adult contemporary show from January 9, 1981, until 1984. January 9, 1981, was also the premier of America Overnight, a six-hour interview and call-in show hosted by Eric Tracey in Los Angeles and Ed Busch from Dallas. It was the first national talk show delivered by satellite. It also marked the first time a network offered simultaneous overnight programs. Dick Bartley created, produced and hosted the first live national oldies radio show, Solid Gold Saturday Night. Headquarters The RKO Radio Networks were headquartered at 1440 Broadway in New York City, also the home of co-owned WOR (AM). The offices were the former headquarters of the Mutual Broadcasting System when RKO General owned Mutual. RKO also staffed news bureaus in Washington, D.C., and London. Notable events=Last John Lennon interview The network aired the last interview with John Lennon, recorded at The Dakota just hours before his death on December 8, 1980, by Dave Sholin, a San Francisco DJ, with radio producer Ron Hummel, who put together many music specials for RKO. Billing scandal and sale After advertising billing scandals involving RKO's television stations and later the radio networks came to light, the RKO Radio Networks were sold in 1985 to the United Stations Radio Networks. Dick Clark Productions, owner of United Stations, sold the RKO Radio Network entity to Tom Ficara in 1990. United Stations was merged with Transtar Radio Networks to form Unistar Radio Networks in 1987. Unistar was absorbed by Westwood One in 1994 and its affiliates were switched to the Mutual Broadcasting System.

History Egoldt bootlegged 1950s rockabilly recordings in the early 1970s before starting the Rock-O-Rama mail order service, which was the first significant source for English and American punk records in Germany. The label was originally an outlet for (more or less left wing) German punk bands such as the Vomit Visions and the Razors. These early bands sang in English, which led to the following comment by John Peel, who wrote to Egoldt in May 1980: \\"One thing about the records. Why do German singers sing in English? Is it because it is fashionable? Or is it a marketing consideration? Whichever it is, I think they should sing in German anyway.\\"Same Old Song zine, No. 29, June 1980 In the mid-1980s, Rock-O-Rama was best known for white power rock bands like Skrewdriver. By then, the label had left its punk roots behind and concentrated on records by neo-Nazi and far right bands. Egoldt had developed a reputation for questionable business practices before he began to release records by right wing bands.

Development on Ghaznavi started in 1990s after the refusal of export of M-11 missiles from China to Pakistan. The Ghaznavi was pursued alongside the Abdali program, and its features are extremely close to those of the Chinese M-11. The Ghaznavi program contract was awarded to NDC. The Pakistan military officials consistently maintained that the Ghaznavi program is locally designed and indigenously built. In 1995, its engine was successfully tested and was said to be a \\"major break-through in missile development in Pakistan\\".

The Coliseum was the largest arena in South Carolina at the time of its completion. It was the home of the USC men's and women's basketball teams for many years as well as Columbia's main events venue until 2002, when the Colonial Life Arena (originally named Carolina Center), opened a block away on Greene Street. The Coliseum was once home to the Columbia Inferno hockey team, a franchisee of the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL), until poor ticket sales caused the Inferno to leave. The team planned to move to another venue, but it did not materialize. The facility is also home to university classrooms with classes held in the lower levels. The high school commencement ceremonies of many high schools in the South Carolina Midlands are held annually in the arena as many school venues are too small for such ceremonies. Prior to the building of the Coliseum, the Gamecocks had played in Carolina Fieldhouse from 1927 until it burned in 1968, and the Carolina Gymnasium (now the Longstreet Theater) prior to that. The Coliseum was the host of the NCAA Basketball Tournament East Regional in 1970.

Although it is an older facility, its many positive technical attributes have made it a desirable venue for tour rehearsals. The Coliseum is university owned but it is managed by Comcast Spectacor subsidiary Spectra. A conflict with a Miranda Lambert concert at Colonial Life Arena resulted in the USC Athletics Department moving the January 17, 2013 women's basketball game against Louisiana State University to the Coliseum. This was the first use of the facility as the official backup venue for the USC teams since play began in Colonial Life Center. Officials subsequently announced that no more games will be played in the Coliseum. In the fall of 2014, 3000 seats were removed and the arena floor was converted into two practice courts for the Gamecock men's and women's teams. The old Coliseum playing surface was auctioned in January for $23,215.

The group sometimes refers to its fans as \\"zuggalos\\".  Background  Zug Izland formed in 2001, named after an industrial site near Detroit. The band was formed by Insane Clown Posse member Violent J (Joseph Bruce) and Mike Puwal, out of Bruce's love of rock music. Bruce wanted to know what a \\"Juggalo Rock\\" band would sound like. Zug Izland's songs were written and developed during the recording of Insane Clown Posse's album The Wraith: Shangri-La. Bruce and Puwal completed the basic tracks for two songs, but still required a lead singer. Bruce wanted a singer similar to Kurt Cobain, Eddie Vedder, Jim Morrison or Axl Rose. Although Syn was sought by three other bands at the time, he joined Zug Izland as their official singer. The band broke onto the national competitive music scene in 2003 with their debut album, Cracked Tiles. The album peaked at No. 48 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart and at No. 31 on the Top Independent Albums chart. Zug Izland released a follow-up album 3:33 the 1st of June 2004. It peaked at No. 26 on the Top Heatseekers chart and at No. 22 on the Top Independent Albums chart. The release of the 3:33 album amicably fulfilled Psychopathic Records contract with Zug Izland. After parting ways with Psychopathic Records after the release of 3:33, Zug Izland began writing and recording songs for a new album entitled \\"Promised Land\\". The ill-fated album was never released however tracks 'Next To Me\\", \\"Lies\\" and \\"How Does it Feel\\" were released officially online with leaked songs \\"Promised land\\" and \\"Woke Up Screaming\\" surfacing online some time later. The Syn written and recorded \\"Chemical Girl\\" was also released via the official Zug Izland MySpace page, however it has also never featured on an album. In 2005, Zug Izland recorded a cover of Pink Floyd classic \\"Another Brick In The Wall\\". The track was a crowd favourite that Zug Izland would often cover at their live shows. Re-working the lyrics, the new track took a \\"Juggalo\\" theme replacing Pink Floyd's child chorus with a group of angry Juggalos screaming \\"Hey! People! Leave Juggalos alone!\\" in reference to the Juggalo culture's misrepresentation in mainstream media. The finished track was made available through the ZugIzland.com, but never made available on an official release. Following years of touring and various line up changes, Zug Izland reunited, and returned to Psychopathic Records, announcing plans to reissue Cracked Tiles record a new album and tour with Insane Clown Posse in promotion of ICP's Mighty Death Pop! album. In the December 21, 2012 edition of Hatchet Herald, it was revealed that Zug Izland would release a \\"greatest hits\\" album, featuring three newly recorded songs recorded by Violent J and Mike Puwal. In August 2013 Zug Izland's greatest hits compilation \\"Toxicology: Zug Izland's Dopest Bangers\\" was released on Psychopathic Records, their first official release since 3:33 in 2004. The album featured a collection of tracks from their debut album Cracked Tiles, three remastered songs from 3:33 and three new recordings. The new songs reverted to the writing/recording process of Cracked Tiles with Violent J of Insane Clown Posse writing lyrics and Mike P writing the music. According to Faygoluvers.net the line up is now Syn, Mike P, D-Lay & 2 Phat. Music style Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus describes Zug Izland's music style as incorporating elements of piano ballads, goth, industrial and electronic music, nu metal and horror film scores. According to Loftus, \\"Zug Izland's sparer style [is] unique in an alt-metal climate of two-guitar lineups and monstrous six-string bass bottom ends.\\" Band members ;Current *Syn ‚Äî Lead Vocals (2001‚Äì2009; 2012‚Äìpresent) *2 Phat - drums (2005‚Äì2009; 2018- present) *Mike P. ‚Äî guitar (2001‚Äì2004; 2012‚Äìpresent) *D-Lay ‚Äî bass (2012‚Äìpresent) *DJ Clay - DJ (2012‚Äìpresent) ;Former *Guido Milligan ‚Äî bass (2001‚Äì2002, 2004) *Rex Hamilton ‚Äî bass (2004‚Äì2007) *Dan Miller ‚Äî keyboards (2003‚Äì2004) *Lil Pig ‚Äì drums (2001‚Äì2004; 2012‚Äì2017) * The Son Of Rock, Joey V. ‚Äì lead guitar (2007‚Äì2009, 2012) Discography *Cracked Tiles (January 31, 2003) (Psychopathic Records) *3:33 (June 1, 2004) (Ax & Smash Records/Psychopathic Records) *Toxicology: Zug Izlands Dopest Bangers (August 13, 2013) (Psychopathic Records) *The Promised Land / Nebula (September 10, 2016) (independent release) *The Promised Land / Event Horizon (July 17, 2018) (independent release) Features On the Bloodstepp track \\"Underground MVP\\" also featuring Big Hoodoo, Axe Murder Boyz, Spice 1, DJ Clay and KidCrusher from the album Grand Theft UFO: Floppy Disk Edition released in 2014.

History  The company was founded by Theophile Mortier (1855‚Äì1944). Mortier started in 1898 as a vending agent for the Parisian organ builder Gavioli & Cie, in a period when the French and German organ industry was in full bloom. Theophile Mortier was originally the manager of a dance hall, in which there was always a Gavioli organ playing. He made it a habit to sell the installed organ after a short while. He was fortunate enough most of the time to make a profit on selling these used organs. As time went by he became more and more an organ dealer and a very good customer of Gavioli. He set up a repair shop in order to provide maintenance and repair for the organs, which he had sold. The organ builder Guillaume Bax managed this shop. In 1906 Mortier started to build organs himself, as an annex of the Gavioli company. Due to internal operations difficulties, Gavioli could after a while not deliver enough orders and Mortier began to manufacture the dance organs under his own name. After the First World War the company expanded to a size where they employed 80 personnel and had a capacity to build about 20 large dance organs per year. No other manufacturer has matched the cubic meter volume of organs produced by Mortier. The company stayed active until 1948.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 9, 2000. In the episode, while the rest of the Simpson family goes skiing, Marge remains at the ski lodge due to her fear of skiing, only to break her leg from a falling clock. As a result, while hospitalized, Marge leaves Lisa to take care of the house. When Bart and Homer refuse to help out with the chores, Lisa pulls a prank on them by making it look like they have leprosy. The episode includes a guest appearance from Elwood Edwards, and features several references to Lucille Ball and her television work. Plot When Marge is cleaning out the attic and looking for old things to send away to charity, Homer and the children refuse to let her, prompting Marge to look at all the junk she is trying to get rid of. She shows Homer several skis he never used since buying them after the Nagano Olympics. To spite Marge, he decides to use them, so the family go on a skiing trip. When they are there, Marge decides that she wants to avoid skiing or snowboarding for fear of injury, which makes her stay at the ski lodge. Ironically, she winds up breaking her leg here when a loose-hanging cuckoo clock falls on it. She is sent to the hospital where she is told that she must stay there until her cast is removed. In the meantime, Lisa offers to take her place, making a structured plan for Homer and Bart to do some of the chores, which Lisa chooses through a chore hat. Unfortunately, Homer and Bart do them in an extremely apathetic, ineffective, sandy-eyed manner. Marge is enjoying her time in the hospital, due to getting a massage, among other things. The lazy lifestyles of Homer and Bart have taken their toll on the house, which is now a disorganized, filthy hovel with trash, and Lisa struggling to make ends meet. She eventually calls Marge and asks if she can return, but Marge, who enjoys the lifestyle of lying all day in bed not working, lies to Lisa saying she is still too injured to come back. Lisa, angered and desperate for answers, sees the ghost of Lucille Ball, who has an idea to get revenge. She suggests that she pull a clever trick on Homer and Bart while they are asleep. She does just that, using green poster paint mixed with oatmeal on the men. The next morning, Homer and Bart are horrified to find what they think are sores all over their bodies. After a Virtual Doctor computer program diagnoses Homer and Bart with leprosy, they panic and decide to visit Ned Flanders in search of a cure. Ned sends Homer and Bart to a leper colony in Hawaii, where they will receive electric needle treatment and sanded. Once Marge's cast has finally come off, she comes home to see Lisa finally finished cleaning the entire house. They decide to seek out Homer and Bart in Hawaii. When they arrive, Lisa admits that she only played a trick on Homer and Bart, though they already know the leprosy is fake because Homer ate one of its sores and found it tasty; however, the whole family wants to stay there on account of it being a \\"free vacation\\", despite Homer and Bart suffering through the painful treatments. Production Actress Lucille Ball, seen here just four weeks before her death in 1989, is referenced in the episode. \\"Little Big Mom\\" was written by Carolyn Omine and directed by Mark Kirkland as part of the eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999‚Äì2000). Elwood Edwards, known as the voice of the Internet service provider America Online, guest starred in the episode as the Virtual Doctor that confirms Homer and Bart's leprosy. The episode features several references to the late American actress Lucille Ball and her many television sitcoms starring characters named Lucy. For example, it is the ghost of Ball that gives Lisa the idea to trick Homer and Bart into thinking they have leprosy. Ball is portrayed with a cigarette in her hand in that scene, and speaks with a raspy voice. When Lisa first sees the ghost, she cries out \\"Lucy?\\", to which Ball responds \\"Lucy McGillicuddy Ricardo Carmichael. [Coughs] And I think there's some more.\\" According to Michael Karol, author of the 2004 book Lucy A to Z, the last names \\"are those of Ball's characters from I Love Lucy and The Lucy Show. Left out were Lucy Carter of Here's Lucy and Lucy Barker of Life with Lucy.\\" The Simpsons cast member Tress MacNeille provided the voice of Ball in the episode. Additional references to Ball's work featured in \\"Little Big Mom\\" include Homer and Bart watching I Love Lucy with the volume turned up high, disturbing Lisa when she is trying to sleep. An Itchy & Scratchy cartoon that references the \\"Job Switching\\" episode of I Love Lucy is also seen in the episode. Release and reception The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 9, 2000. On October 7, 2008, it was released on DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Eleventh Season. Staff members Mike Scully, George Meyer, Matt Selman, Carolyn Omine, and Mark Kirkland participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented: \\"We‚Äôve seen 'the family goes to crap without Marge around' episodes in the past, so don‚Äôt expect any reinvented wheels here. Still, the sight of Lisa in charge adds a decent spin, and the leprosy twist ‚Äì while silly ‚Äì proves amusing. It‚Äôs another unexceptional show but one with its moments.\\" Before this episode, The Simpsons had referenced Lucille Ball several times. Michael Karol wrote in Lucy A to Z that \\"perhaps the funniest tribute came in [...] 'Little Big Mom.'\\" Dan Castellaneta, who provides the voice of Homer in the series, considers this episode to be one of his personal favorites. Because \\"Little Big Mom\\" deals with leprosy, it has never been released in Japan. According to Shari Ross Altarac in her doctoral dissertation \\"The Adaptation of U.S. Television in Foreign Markets: How France and Japan Put Their Distinctive Spin on The Simpsons\\", the reason behind this is that \\"Former segregation laws remain a sensitive topic in Japan, where litigation of leprosy cases and charges of human rights abuses by the Japanese government have ensued.\\" (See Leprosy in Japan.)

It was first shown as a Halloween special on CBS television, which aired on October 26, 1994. Later it was awarded the Grand Prix at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival. The film is loosely structured, jumping between several simple stories. Many of these situations use staple clich√©s of horror films, such as undead monsters and the dark and stormy night. The stories sometimes turn macabre, but are presented in a lighthearted fashion. They are mainly as those in the printed comic, including many background throwaway gags from well-known panels. The characters and settings are all common to Larson's work, such as aliens, anthropomorphic animals and other objects, and cowboys in the Old West. The art style is essentially the same as that of The Far Side, though the film necessarily adds animation and sound effects. The animation was made in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, at director-animator Marv Newland's International Rocketship Productions. The film features an original music score by jazz guitarist Bill Frisell. Some of the compositions from the soundtrack are included on his 1996 album Quartet. In 1997 the film spawned a sequel, Tales from the Far Side II. This follow-up was never broadcast on American television, but it aired in the UK on BBC and appeared in numerous film festivals. Both films were released on VHS and DVD and were available for purchase by U.S. addresses from the official Far Side website.

Early years The idea for a National Black Network was conceived by former ABC Radio and Mutual Broadcasting System President Robert Pauley in 1969 as a way to utilize Mutual's contracted but unused network lines for the benefit of African-Americans. The goal was to tie together the 117 black-oriented radio stations in the country. Pauley, a white American, was unable to organize the niche African American oriented news business and therefore turned to Eugene D. Jackson, an African American electrical engineer working as a consultant raising capital for black business investments. Sydney L. Small, a former employee of ABC Radio Network was recruited to join the group. Mr. Pauley finally became frustrated with the difficult task of raising the $1,000,000 in capital needed to start the operation and abandon the effort. Jackson and Small along with Del Raycee of Mutual Broadcasting System persevered and finally launch the National Black Network on July 2, 1972 in New York City with 25 affiliates. NBN aired 5-minute newscasts at the hour and sportscasts several times a day at the half-hour. NBN also aired a wide variety of public affairs programs and a live overnight talk show hosted by Bob Law. In 1972 there were only 17 African American owned radio stations even though there were over 125 African American oriented station in the country, and by 1976 Eugene D. Jackson became the only African American on the 125 member Board of Directors of the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB). With over 80 affiliates associated with NBN, Jackson wanted to see more radio stations owned by African Americans and therefore, conceived and started the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters (NABOB) in Atlanta as a complement to his position on the NAB Board. Within 15 years, the number of African American owned radio station moved to almost 50 through the creation of Broadcap, a capital raising institution formed by the NAB and the captains of the television and radio industry. In the early 1980s NBN offered a second news service, American Urban Information Radio, which broadcast an hourly newscast at 50 minutes past the hour, but concentrated on in-depth reporting. By the early 1990s, NBN merged with its main competitor, the Sheridan Broadcasting Network (formerly the Mutual Black Network), to form the American Urban Radio Networks. The first news director was Roy N. Wood Sr., from the famed Chicago radio station WVON, \\"The voice of the Negro.\\" In 1975 Roy Wood was replaced by Vince Sanders, another Chicago area talent and veteran of local black- formatted radio. Sanders, served as Vice President of Broadcast Operations at NBN until its demise in 1995. He joined NBN following 3 years with NBC news and its Chicago owned-and-operated station: WMAQ-AM. Before NBC, Sanders was a talk show host for 8 years at WBEE-AM in the Chicago market. His final assignment with NBN Broadcasting included vice president and general manager of its New York City station, WWRL-AM. Small and Jackson hired WABC's Malvin (Mal) Russell Goode to be a senior consultant and the network's United Nations correspondent. Working for ABC, Mr. Goode gained notoriety while being stationed at the UN, reporting the responses of President John F. Kennedy to the Bay of Pigs Invasion initiative of Fidel Castro. Mr. Goode continued working as a senior UN correspondent for National Black Network until 1991 when the two largest black radio networks in American merged to form the American Urban Radio Networks. Eugene Jackson and Sidney Small dissolved their partnership shortly before this merger, leaving Small to form the alliance with Ronald R. Davenport of the Sheridan Broadcasting Network.  Notable personalities  Long before Bob Law gained fame with \\"Night Talk,\\" there were a number of Black radio stars on the airwaves at NBN, such as Frank Bannister Jr., who also wrote the \\"Black College Polls\\" for Jet Magazine each week. The heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali made his presence known visiting Frank Bannister after a defeat to Leon Spinks. After his death from a heart attack, Bannister was replaced by Ron Pinkney, a former colleague of Gerald Bentley and Ed Castleberry, who were already on the airwaves of NBN. Roy Wood's \\"One Black Man's Opinion\\" was a major showcase of the former-WVON anchor, allowing him a no-holds-barred avenue to the listeners each week. Joseph \\"Joe\\" Brown hosted \\"Black Issues In The Black Press,\\" another weekly news program that focused on the issues of the day. The guest and talented performers ranged from Judge Bruce Wright to Evelyn \\"Champagne\\" King. Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin of The Temptations were seen joking and laughing it up with Ed Castleberry before airtime. Castleberry made his mark working with Larry Dean at Cincinnati's famed WCIN. Many in the business knew that Castleberry and \\"Gentleman\\" Dean were the real models for Venus Flytrap and Dr. Johnny Fever of television's WKRP in Cincinnati.  Locations  NBN moved from 1350 Avenue of the Americas, New York City, to 10 Columbus Circle, and ended its reign at 4130 58th Street, Woodside, Queens. This was the same location that housed WWRL, a 1960s Black radio powerhouse that helped launch the career of black radio personality Francis \\"Frankie\\" Edward Crocker.

Her popular radio shows spanned more than 40 years. In the 1940s the daily audience for her housewife-oriented program numbered from six to eight million listeners. She was called \\"The First Lady of Radio.\\"  Early life  McBride was born on November 16, 1899 in Paris, Missouri, to a farming family. Their frequent relocations disorganized her early schooling, but at the age of six she became a student at a preparatory school called William Woods College, and at 16 the University of Missouri, receiving a degree in journalism there in 1919. She was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta at the University of Missouri. She worked a year as a reporter at the Cleveland Press, and then until 1924 at the New York Evening Mail. Following this, she wrote freelance for periodicals including The Saturday Evening Post, Cosmopolitan, Good Housekeeping, and starting in 1926 collaborated in writing travel-oriented books.  Radio and sidelines = As Martha Deane  McBride first worked steadily in radio for WOR in New York City, starting in 1934. This daily women's-advice show, with her persona as \\"Martha Deane\\", a kind and witty grandmother figure with a Missouri-drawl, aired daily until 1940. Originally, McBride's character \\"Martha Deane\\" was to be a grandmother with six children and many grandchildren-all imaginary. They were all named and described; she was to memorize the details. Her job was to talk colloquially and dispense philosophy. She kept getting all her \\"grandchildren's\\" names mixed up and within three weeks she jettisoned the whole tribe on air. She remained Martha Deane, but was no longer a grandmother.Barnouw, Erik (1969). The Golden Web: A History of Broadcasting in the United States, p. 92. Concurrently with working as \\"Deane\\", in 1934 and 1935, she was the women's page editor for the Newspaper Enterprise Association syndicate.  As herself  In 1937, she launched on the CBS radio network the first of a series of similar and successful shows, now as Mary Margaret McBride. She had to abandon the Deane persona because WOR owned the name. She interviewed figures well known in the world of arts and entertainment, and politics, with a style recognized as original to herself. She accepted advertising only for products she was prepared to endorse from her own experience, and turned down all tobacco or alcohol products. She followed this format in regular broadcasts on * CBS until 1941 * NBC (where her audience numbered in the millions) from then until 1950 * ABC from then until 1954 * NBC again until 1960, and * The New York Herald Tribune's radio broadcasts with a wider audience via syndication. Her NBC show in the 1940s had broad range of guests, from politicians to generals to movie stars; she never announced her guests in advance, so the audience tuned in with no idea what they would get. Beginning during World War II, she began \\"breaking the color line\\", mixing in African American guests. McBride was a popular media figure; the tea rose, 'Mary Margaret McBride' was named for her. In September 1948, NBC brought McBride to television for a 30-minute prime time show on Tuesdays at 9pm EST. However, NBC abandoned the show in its partial third month, with Variety describing the attempt sarcastically, and The New York Times calling her the first major \\"fatality\\" of this kind. Below is a review of one of her first television performances, reviewed by The New York Times: :Perhaps the ladies in the daytime can survive Miss McBride's effusive and interminable commercials, but for the men at home in the evening they are hard to take after a day at the office. To watch Miss McBride shift-without pause or loss of breath-from a eulogy of Kemtone paint to an analysis of Russia is an ordeal not quickly forgotten. If nighttime television is to be daytime radio, away video, away! From 1953 to 1956 she also conducted a syndicated newspaper column for the Associated Press. About 20 years apart, she wrote two books for girls, each with \\"Elizabeth\\" in the title. As time went on, she appeared in smaller radio media markets, in upstate New York, and toward the end of her life hosted \\"Your Hudson Valley Neighbor\\" three times a week on WGHQ Kingston, NY from the living room of her home. Her longtime companion and business partner, Stella Karn, died in 1957.Ware, It's One O'Clock and Here is Mary Margaret McBride, p. 225 She died at the age of 76 on April 7, 1976 at her home in West Shokan, New York. McBride's ashes were placed in her former rose garden. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her work in radio.  Cultural impact  An account of her career, It's One O'clock and Here is Mary Margaret McBride: A Radio Biography by Susan Ware was published in early 2005. She is also discussed in depth in Radio Voices by Michele Hilmes. The character of \\"Mary McGoon\\", featured in the comedy routines of Bob and Ray, is a parody of Mary Margaret McBride. The TV host \\"Molly Margaret McSnide\\" in Fantastic Four issue 16 is an obvious reference. Her name was spoofed on the classic CBS-TV sitcom I Love Lucy in Episode # 79, \\"The Million Dollar Idea\\", which aired on January 11, 1954. In that installment, Lucy (Lucille Ball) comes up with an ambitious idea to make money. She decides to appear on television selling her Aunt Martha's salad dressing. Assisting her on the program is her best friend Ethel Mertz (Vivian Vance) as \\"Mary Margaret McMertz.\\" McBride's celebrity was hardly a secret confined to daytime radio listeners, either: her 15th anniversary celebration in 1949 was held in Yankee stadium, the only facility large enough to hold the 75,000 people who filled every seat and formed huge crowds outside. Her magazine show was on the air continuously for 25 years. McBride pioneered a style of ad-libbing her radio shows, meaning that the content in her show was not rehearsed prior to going on the air. She was acknowledged by Current Biography as \\"the first woman to bring newspaper technique to radio interviewing and to make daytime broadcasts profitable.\\" The method of sustaining her show was also distinct. McBride and manager Stella Karn would produce their show and then market it directly to sponsors in the New York area or broader national arena. This format allowed McBride and Karn to have complete agency over the content and format of the show. The two were consistently able to maintain a level of support from sponsors, meaning that they were able to produce content that was exactly how they envisioned it, free of outside changes. This model was also one of McBride's notable contributions to broadcasting, as it paved the way for independent producing.  Personal relationship  Mary Margaret McBride and Stella Karn met in the early 1920s in an instance of complete happenstance. As McBride describes it as, ‚ÄúOne day a bouncy woman, with eager brown eyes and auburn hair rolled into a bun, burst into our office and announced that she would be handling publicity for us.‚Äù McBride and Karn worked together for years, with Karn managing McBride and her show. McBride described the two of them in a Reader's Digest edition in 1962 as, \\"No two people were more unlike. My reaction to a crisis was to dissolve into tears; Stella's was to charge into battle.\\" The two moved in together in a small apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City. McBride and Karn relied on each other for the entirety of their professional and personal lives. McBride describes their first endeavor as a complete gamble motivated solely by Karn's optimism. During the Great Depression, the opportunity came for McBride to audition for a radio show, one of the only sources of entertainment at the time. When McBride got the job, she immediately recommended Karn as the person to handle the business side of the show's affairs. Karn and McBride became business partners, and Karn's first act on the job was to give her partner a raise. McBride and Karn made a name for themselves as pioneers in the field of broadcasting, and also as trailblazers for the future of lesbian and bisexual journalists. McBride and Karn established their show as a connection point for lesbian and bisexual female creatives, forging friendships with influential names in broadcasting such as Ann Batchelder and Lisa Sergio.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a New Democratic MPP from 1975 to 1988. Background Swart was born in London, Ontario. he went to school at Smithville Secondary School, and worked as a foreman. He served as an alderman in Thorold from 1948 to 1950, and was deputy reeve from 1951 to 1954 and reeve from 1955 to 1965. He became a warden for Welland County in 1961, and was president of the Association of Ontario Mayors and Reeves in 1961-62. He later served temporarily as its part-time executive director around 1970. Politics Swart campaigned for the House of Commons of Canada five times, but was never successful. He was defeated in Welland as a candidate of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation in a 1950 by-election, and in the general elections of 1953, 1957 and 1958. He ran again for the federal New Democratic Party in the 1962 election, and was again defeated. On all five occasions, he finished third against his Progressive Conservative and Liberal opponents. His provincial career was initially no more successful. He challenged Progressive Conservative incumbent Ellis Morningstar for the Welland provincial constituency in the 1967 election, but lost by 260 votes. He ran again in the 1971 election, and lost by a greater margin. He had left the municipal council to concentrate on provincial politics, and stayed out of council until 1972, when he ran for Regional Councillor of Niagara Region and was elected, elected again in 1974. He served a two-year term as president of the New Democratic Party of Ontario beginning in 1974. Morningstar retired at the 1975 election, and Swart was able to defeat his successor, Allan Pietz, by 1,115 votes. He defeated Pietz again for the newly created riding of Welland‚ÄîThorold in the 1977 election, and won by much greater margins in the elections of 1981, 1985 and 1987. He retired in 1988, and was replaced in the legislature by Peter Kormos, also of the NDP. Two years after his retirement, the NDP won a majority government under Bob Rae. Despite having nominated Rae at the 1982 Ontario NDP leadership convention, Swart became highly critical of Rae's leadership in government, and blamed the Premier for falling NDP membership and financial contributions in the early 1990s. Swart had been the leading advocate of public auto insurance in Ontario in the 1980s and was especially critical of the Rae government's decision to go back on its promise to introduce the program. In 1994, Swart publicly called on Rae to resign as NDP leader. Legacy The Mel Swart Lake Gibson Conservation Area is in Thorold, Ontario. Swart was considered a political mentor to Peter Kormos who inherited both his predecessor's seat in the legislature and his strong advocacy of public auto insurance.

The company was established in about 1988 to place the Gulfstream American AA-5B Tiger back in production. The Tiger had originally been produced by Grumman American and then later by Gulfstream American with production ending in 1979. The Tiger remained a popular aircraft amongst pilots and owners and American General sought to capitalize on that popularity with the production of new aircraft. American General actually carried out a redesign of the Tiger, introducing many improvements over the older AA-5B, including a new split nose bowl that could be removed without removing the propeller, a new instrument panel, improved exterior lighting, a new fuel indication system, a 28 volt electrical system replacing the previous 12 volt system, a new style throttle quadrant and improvements to the heat and ventilation systems. These were enough changes that the FAA required an amended type certificate. This added to the time required to get the aircraft into production and the cost of doing so. The redesigned aircraft was known as the American General AG-5B Tiger. The newly redesigned aircraft was well received by the civil aviation community. Many aircraft reviewers at that time wrote that the AG-5B was an evolutionary improvement over the previous production AA-5B Tigers and a worthy successor. The company commenced production with the 1990 model year, building 13 production aircraft that year. 87 aircraft were produced in 1991 and 54 in 1992. The final year of production was 1992 when 24 were produced before the company closed its doors. Total AG-5B production at American General was 181, including prototypes. Production of the AG-5B design was taken up again in 2001 by a new company, Tiger Aircraft.

The Frog Princess is a fairy tale that has multiple versions with various origins. It is classified as type 402, the animal bride, in the Aarne‚ÄìThompson index.Georgias A. Megas, Folktales of Greece, p 224, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970 Another tale of this type is Doll i' the Grass.D. L. Ashliman, \\"Animal Brides: folktales of Aarne‚ÄìThompson type 402 and related stories\\" Russian variants include the Frog Princess or Tsarevna Frog (–¶–∞—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∞ –õ—è–≥—É—à–∫–∞, Tsarevna Lyagushka) and also Vasilisa the Wise (–í–∞—Å–∏–ª–∏—Å–∞ –ü—Ä–µ–º—É–¥—Ä–∞—è, Vasilisa Premudraya); Alexander Afanasyev collected variants in his Narodnye russkie skazki. Synopsis The king (or an old peasant woman, in Lang's version) wants his three sons to marry. To accomplish this, he creates a test to help them find brides. The king tells each prince to shoot an arrow. According to the King's rules, each prince will find his bride where the arrow lands. The youngest son's arrow is picked up by a frog. The king assigns his three prospective daughters-in-law various tasks, such as spinning cloth and baking bread. In every task, the frog far outperforms the two other lazy brides-to- be. In some versions, the frog uses magic to accomplish the tasks, and though the other brides attempt to emulate the frog, they cannot perform the magic. Still, the young prince is ashamed of his frog bride until she is magically transformed into a human princess. In Calvino's version, the princes use slings rather than bows and arrows. In the Greek version, the princes set out to find their brides one by one; the older two are already married by the time the youngest prince starts his quest. Another variation involves the sons chopping down trees and heading in the direction pointed by them in order to find their brides.Out of the Everywhere: New Tales for Canada, Jan Andrews Illustration to The Frog Tsarevna by Ivan Bilibin In the Russian versions of the story, Prince Ivan and his two older brothers shoot arrows in different directions to find brides. The other brothers' arrows land in the houses of the daughters of an aristocratic and wealthy merchant. Ivan's arrow lands in the mouth of a frog in a swamp, who turns into a princess at night. The Frog Princess, named Vasilisa the Wise, is a beautiful, intelligent, friendly, skilled girl who was forced to spend 3 years in a frog's skin for disobeying Koschei. Her final test may be to dance at the king's banquet. The Frog Princess sheds her skin, and the prince then burns it, to her dismay. Had the prince been patient, the Frog Princess would have been freed but instead he loses her. He then sets out to find her again and meets with Baba Yaga, whom he impresses with his spirit, asking why she has not offered him hospitality. She tells him that Koschei is holding his bride captive and explains how to find the magic needle needed to rescue his bride. In another version, the prince's bride flies into Baba Yaga's hut as a bird. The prince catches her, she turns into a lizard, and he cannot hold on. Baba Yaga rebukes him and sends him to her sister, where he fails again. However, when he is sent to the third sister, he catches her and no transformations can break her free again. In some versions of the story, the Frog Princess' transformation is a reward for her good nature. In one version, she is transformed by witches for their amusement. In yet another version, she is revealed to have been an enchanted princess all along. Variants Andrew Lang included an Italian variant of the tale, titled The Frog in The Violet Fairy Book.Andrew Lang, The Violet Fairy Book, \\"The Frog\\" Italo Calvino included another Italian variant from Piedmont, The Prince Who Married a Frog, in Italian Folktales,Italo Calvino, Italian Folktales p 438 where he noted that the tale was common throughout Europe.Italo Calvino, Italian Folktales p 718 Georgios A. Megas included a Greek variant, The Enchanted Lake, in Folktales of Greece.Georgias A. Megas, Folktales of Greece, p 49, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970 This tale is closely related to Puddocky and its variants, in which a king sets three tasks to his sons to determine which is best suited to rule the country, and a transformed frog helps the youngest prince. Adaptations * Vasilisa the Beautiful, a 1939 Soviet film directed by Aleksandr Rou, is based on this plot. It was the first large-budget feature in the Soviet Union to use fantasy elements, as opposed to the realistic style long favored politically.James Graham, Baba Yaga in Film * In 1953 the director Mikhail Tsekhanovsky had the idea of animating this popular national fairy tale. Production took two years, and the premiere took place in December, 1954. At present the film is included in the gold classics of \\"Soyuzmultfilm\\". * Vasilisa the Beautiful, a 1977 Soviet animated film is also based on this fairy tale. * In 1996, an animated Russian version based on an in-depth version of the tale in the film \\"Classic Fairy Tales From Around the World\\" on VHS. This version tells of how the beautiful Princess Vasilisa was kidnapped and cursed by the evil wizard Kashay to make her his bride and only the love of the handsome Prince Ivan can free her. * Taking inspiration from the Russian story, Vasilisa appears to assist Hellboy against Koschei in the 2007 comic book Hellboy: Darkness Calls. * The Frog Princess was featured in Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child, where it was depicted in a country setting. The episode features the voice talents of Jasmine Guy as Frog Princess Lylah, Greg Kinnear as Prince Gavin, Wallace Langham as Prince Bobby, Mary Gross as Elise, and Beau Bridges as King Big Daddy. Culture Music The Divine Comedy's 1997 single The Frog Princess is loosely based on the theme of the original Frog Princess story, interwoven with the narrator's personal experiences.

Located in the Northern Gondar Zone of the Amhara Region, its territory covers the Semien Mountains and includes Ras Dashan, the highest point in Ethiopia. It is home to a number of endangered species, including the Ethiopian wolf and the walia ibex, a wild goat found nowhere else in the world. The gelada baboon and the caracal, a cat, also occur within the Simien Mountains. More than 50 species of birds inhabit the park, including the impressive bearded vulture, or lammergeier, with its ) wingspan.WordTravels Ethiopia Travel Guide, Retrieved on June 22, 2008 The park is crossed by an unpaved road which runs from Debarq, where the administrative headquarters of the park is located, east through a number of villages to the Buahit Pass (4,430 m), where the road turns south to end at Mekane Berhan, 10 kilometers beyond the park boundary.Philip Briggs, Ethiopia: The Bradt Travel Guide, 5th edition (Chalfont St Peters: Bradt, 2009), p. 240  History  The park was established in 1969, having been set up by Clive Nicol, who wrote about his experiences in From the Roof of Africa (1971, ). The Simien region has been inhabited and cultivated for at least 2,000 years. Initially, erosion began to reveal that the clearing began at the gentle slope of the highland valley but later expanded to a steep slope. It was one of the first sites to be made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO (1978). However, due to serious population declines of some of its characteristic native species, in 1996 it was also added to the List of World Heritage in Danger.  Geography  Over millions of years, due to the large erosion of the Ethiopian plateau, serrated mountain peaks, deep valleys, and 1,500 meters of sheer cliffs have been created, making it one of the most spectacular scenery in the world. The heritage area is on the western side of the Simien Mountains and is 120 km from the Gondar province of Begemder in the northwestern part of Ethiopia. The Simien area is rich in perforated basalt, and serves as an ideal catchment basin. Water is reserved by the Mayshasha River, which runs through the two rainy days and the national park from north to south. As a result, national parks are abundant with wildlife and plants.  Flora and fauna  The vegetation is mixed with African alpine forests, wilderness forests and alpine vegetation. High altitude areas include montane savannah and tree heath (Erica arborea), giant lobelia (Lobelia rhynchopetalum), yellow primrose (Primula verticillata), everlastings (Helichrysum spp.), A lady's mantle (alchemilla), and a moss (mosses, Grimmiaceae). Lichen covers the trees of the alpine area. Vegetation throughout the park is divided into three sections, Montane forest (1900-3000m), Ericaceous Belt or SubAfroalpine (2700-3700m) and the Afroalpine (3700-5433m). Within the Montane forest there are Juniper trees (Juniperous procera), African Redwood (Hagenia abyssinica), African Olive (Olea africana), Fig Trees (Ficus spp), and Waterberry Trees (Szygium guineense). There are also many varieties of shrubs including Nightshade (Solanum sessilistellatum), Abyssinian rose (Rosa abyssinica), Cowslip (primula verticillata), and Stinging Nettle (Urtica). The ridges and canyons have scattered meadows, forests and bushes. At one time, the St. John's wort (Hypericum spp.) Forests grew from 3,000 m to 3,800 m above sea level, but now it is almost gone. The exact number is not known. Wildlife found in Simien Mountains National Park The park is populated with over 130 bird species and over 20 large mammal species such as gelada baboon (Theropithecus gelada), Ethiopian wolf (also called Simen fox, Canis simensis), Walia ibex (Capra walie), wild mountain goats and the Anubis baboon. Inhabits on the slope of the northern slope of massif are mostly native to the Semien Mountains, and most of them are found in the park. The Ethiopian wolf is endemic to Ethiopia and other mammals include hamadryas baboon, colobus monkey, leopard, caracal, wild cat, spotted hyena and golden jackal. There are also large herbivores, such as bushbuck, common duiker, and klipspringer. The 400 species of birds include bearded vulture, Verreaux's eagle, kestrels, vultures, lanner falcon, augur buzzard and thick-billed raven. A total of 21 species of mammals, 3 species of endemic species, 63 species of birds and 7 species of endemic species are recorded.  Conservation  It was established as a national park in 1969 and is protected under the National Reserve Act. Current heritage requires effective management. The number of management staff should be increased and education should be strengthened. The management of national parks effectively protects the representative species of parks and works closely with local residents to reduce the pressure on park resources by expanding arable land, overfishing livestock, and overcapacity of natural resources. Due to global climate change, pressure on heritage sites is growing. Sufficient financial support is needed for park management and livelihood alternative development of local residents. It is necessary to prepare, implement, review and monitor the management plan, to revise and expand the boundary of the park, and to participate fully in the local residents. Local cooperation is particularly important to prevent sustainable use of national park resources and to develop sustainable livelihoods. Adequate financial support for resettlement of inhabitants in the heritage area and the introduction of effective livestock management are essential to reduce the severe stress on wildlife. In order to maintain excellent universal values, environmental education and training programs of residents living in and out of the heritage are needed as well as obtaining the cooperation and support of local residents in heritage management.

He was appointed to a lectureship at Merton College in 1900, and elected to a tutorial fellowship at Oriel College in October 1902. Ross joined the army in 1915. During World War I, he worked in the Ministry of Munitions and was a major on the special list. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1918 in recognition of his services during the war, and was promoted to a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1938.Cooley, Ken. Sir David Ross's pluralistic theory of duty (the beginnings) Ross was White's Professor of Moral Philosophy (1923‚Äì1928), Provost of Oriel College, Oxford (1929‚Äì1947), Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 1941 to 1944 and Pro-Vice-Chancellor (1944‚Äì1947). He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1939 to 1940. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy and was its President 1936‚Äì1940.Proceedings of the British Academy Volume LVII Of the many governmental committees on which he served one was the Civil Service Tribunal, of which he was chair. One of his two colleagues was Leonard Woolf, who thought that the whole system of fixing governmental remuneration should be on the same basis as the US model, dividing the civil service into a relatively small number of pay grades.The Journey not the Arrival Matters by Leonard Woolf, 1969. Ross did not agree with this radical proposal. In 1947 he was appointed chairman of the first Royal Commission on the Press, United Kingdom. The Ross family grave, Grange Cemetery He died in Oxford on 5 May 1971. He is memorialised on his parents grave in the Grange Cemetery in Edinburgh. Family His younger brother was Rev Donald George Ross (1879-1943). He married Edith Ogden in 1906 and they had four daughters, Margaret (who married Robin Harrison), Eleanor, Rosalind (who married John Miller Martin), and Katharine. Edith died in 1953. He was a cousin of Berriedale Keith. Ross's ethical theory W. D. Ross was a moral realist, a non-naturalist, and an intuitionist.Stratton-Lake, Philip. (2002). 'Introduction'. In Ross, W. D. 1930. The Right and the Good. Reprinted 2002. Oxford: Oxford University Press: ix. He argued that there are moral truths. He wrote: > The moral order...is just as much part of the fundamental nature of the > universe (and...of any possible universe in which there are moral agents at > all) as is the spatial or numerical structure expressed in the axioms of > geometry or arithmetic.Ross, W. D. 1930. The Right and the Good. Reprinted > with an introduction by Philip Stratton-Lake. 2002. Oxford: Oxford > University Press. Thus, according to Ross, the claim that something is good is true if that thing really is good. Ross also agreed with G.E. Moore's claim that any attempt to define ethical statements solely in terms of statements about the natural world commits the naturalistic fallacy. Ross rejected Moore's consequentialist ethics. According to consequentialist theories, what people ought to do is determined only by whether their actions will bring about the most good. By contrast, Ross argues that maximising the good is only one of several prima facie duties (prima facie obligations) which play a role in determining what a person ought to do in any given case. In The Right and the Good, Ross lists seven prima facie duties, without claiming his list to be all-inclusive: fidelity; reparation; gratitude; justice; beneficence; non- maleficence; and self-improvement. In any given situation, any number of these prima facie duties may apply. In the case of ethical dilemmas, they may even contradict one another. Someone could have a prima facie duty of reparation, say, a duty to help people who helped you move house, move house themselves, and a prima facie duty of fidelity, such as taking your children on a promised trip to the park, and these could conflict. Nonetheless, there can never be a true ethical dilemma, Ross would argue, because one of the prima facie duties in a given situation is always the weightiest, and over-rules all the others. This is thus the absolute obligation or absolute duty, the action that the person ought to perform. It is frequently argued, however, that Ross should have used the term \\"pro tanto\\" rather than \\"prima facie\\". Shelly Kagan, for example, wrote: Explaining the difference between pro tanto and prima facie, Kagan wrote: \\"A pro tanto reason has genuine weight, but nonetheless may be outweighed by other considerations. Thus, calling a reason a pro tanto reason is to be distinguished from calling it a prima facie reason, which I take to involve an epistemological qualification: a prima facie reason appears to be a reason, but may actually not be a reason at all\\". A frequent criticism of Ross's ethics is that it is unsystematic and often fails to provide clear-cut ethical answers. Another is that \\"moral intuitions\\" are not a reliable basis for ethics, because they are fallible, can vary widely from individual to individual, and are often rooted in our evolutionary past in ways that should make us suspicious of their capacity to track moral truth.For a discussion of these and other common criticisms of Ross's ethics, see Simpson, \\"William David Ross.\\" Selected works * 1908: Nicomachean Ethics.

The title is awarded to those \\"who perform great deeds in the name of freedom, independence and prosperity of the Republic of Belarus\\".National Legal Internet Portal of the Republic of Belarus Resolution N 3599-XII. Retrieved May. 16 2005. The deed can be for military performance, economic performance or great service to the State and society. The design of the medal is similar to that of its predecessor, Hero of the Soviet Union. Similar titles to the Hero of Belarus include the Hero of the Russian Federation, Hero of Ukraine, and Hero of Uzbekistan. Since its creation, the title has been awarded to eleven people.  Legislation  The title and other Belarusian state awards, their creation, nomination and awarding, are regulated by a set of legal documents: Belarusian Constitution, Law N 288-–ó \\"About state awards of the Republic of Belarus\\" and presidential decrees. The title was created by the Belarus Supreme Soviet on April 13, 1995, with the passage of Resolution N 3726-XII, titled \\"System of State Awards for the Republic of Belarus\\". Alongside the Hero of Belarus title, the resolution authorized the creation of medals, orders, and titles that can be presented by the Belarusian government. The creation of the awards was a way to honor those who have made valuable contributions to Belarus, irrespective of whether they were performed by a citizen or a foreigner. This resolution was outlawed and replaced by Law N 288-–ó on May 18, 2004.  Recommendation process and awarding  To be considered for title, a person must perform a deed that greatly benefits the state and Belarusian society at large. The title can be awarded to those serving in the military, public service or private enterprise. It can only be awarded once to an individual, and can be awarded posthumously. The official criteria are stated in Chapter 2, Article 5 of Law N 288-–ó. Chapter 3, Article 60 of Law N 288-–ó allows any group (association) of workers to submit a recommendation (petition) for an individual to be awarded the title. Governmental bodies, the National Assembly, the Council of Ministers, cabinet officials and public unions, among others, are also eligible to submit nominations for the title. The candidate is evaluated, and if deemed worthy, the nomination is forwarded to the Council of Ministers and then, after having been allowed by the Governmental Secretariat of the Belarusian Security Council, to the President of the Republic. Under the Belarus Constitution (Part 4, Chapter 3, Article 84), the President of the Republic has the power to bestow state awards. To announce an award, the President issues a decree conferring the title to a person.President of the Republic of Belarus Constitution of Belarus ‚Äì Duties of the President . Retrieved November 25, 2006. Within two months, the title will be presented by the President in a formal setting, usually at the Independence Palace in the capital city of Minsk. A certificate (gramota) will also be presented to the recipient, signed by the President of the Republic.  Privileges  Initially, social privileges for those, who achieved Hero of Belarus, according to the Resolution of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Belarus under April 13, 1995 N 3727-XII, were equal to the privileges for people, whom Hero of Soviet Union, Hero of Socialist Labour, Order of Glory or Order of Labor Glory was given. These privileges are regulated by Resolution of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Belarus under February 21, 1995 N 3599-XII. Now this question is regulated by Law of the Republic of Belarus under June 14, 2007 N 239-–ó \\"About social privileges, rights and guarantees to a definite category of citizens\\". According to it, Heroes of Belarus have rights: * of free supplying with medicines in the list of main medicines, which are given under recipes in hospitals; * of free production and repairing of dentures in governmental organizations domiciliary and of free supplying with other technical means of rehabilitation in accordance with the Governmental register of technical means of social rehabilitation; * of pecuniary aid for recovery or, instead of pecuniary aid, of free out-of-turn sanitary-resort recovery; * of free trip on all kinds of urban transport (except taxi) irrespective of domicile; * of free trip on the transport (railway, water, auto, but not taxi) of suburban traffic; * of one free roundtrip by rail, airplane, or truck per year of interurban traffic; * rent- free housing, utilities, and services within 20 square meters of living space; * of free home phone installation if the extension of the subscriber line is less than 500 meters; * of free usage of the home phone (except interurban and international talks). The consumptions, connected with these privileges, are financed from means of republican and local budgets and of governmental social insurance.  Construction and display  1996‚Äì1999 medal The recipient of the title is given a medal called the Medal of the Hero of Belarus (Belarusian: –º–µ–¥–∞–ª—å –ì–µ—Ä–æ—è –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å—ñ, Russian: –º–µ–¥–∞–ª—å –ì–µ—Ä–æ—è –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å–∏). The star and suspension are made of gold, and thus it is nicknamed \\"Gold Star\\", as was its predecessor, the Hero of the Soviet Union. The star has a total diameter of 33 millimeters, and is attached to a rectangular suspension device (boot tree). In the center of the rectangle is a ribbon of two sections of red and one section of green. The red and green bars on the ribbon evoke the design and colors of the national flag. The amount of gold is set at 585‚Äì1 Test, with the total weight of the medal being 19 grams.President of the Republic of Belarus Medal ‚Äì Hero of Belarus design . Retrieved November 25, 2005. The present design was enacted into law by Presidential Decree Number 516 on September 6, 1999. The design of the medal is modeled after one used for the Hero of the Soviet Union. Unlike the Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Socialist Labor and the Hero of the Russian Federation titles, there is no engraving on the reverse of the star. The ribbon also copies the Soviet Hero medal's ribbon, since a flag design was also used to make the ribbon of that medal. The medal is always worn in full on the left side of the breast above all other medals and orders. Chapter 4, Article 69 of Law N 288-–ó states that any awards and titles presented by the Soviet Union and the Byelorussian SSR must be placed after awards from the Republic of Belarus.  1996 medal  When the title was created, a suggested medal was drafted and designed by the government. The major difference between this medal and the current medal is the design of the suspension and the star medallion at the bottom: the top suspension is longer than the bottom, and the bottom star is outlined differently and is adorned with rubies. The suspension was made from gold-plated silver, while the suspension of the current medal is made from gold, as the medal. The design of the star evokes the Marshal's Star, which Soviet Marshals wore around their necks.

Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. .Freedberg, et al. (2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. . This commonly results from the sufferer frequently wearing their hair in a particularly tight ponytail, pigtails, or braids. It is also seen occasionally in long- haired people who use barrettes to keep hair out of their faces. Traction alopecia is recession of the hairline due to chronic traction, or hair pulling, and is characterized by a fringe along the marginal hairline on physical exam. Even though this \\"fringe sign\\" is considered a useful clinical marker of this condition, cases of frontal fibrosing alopecia presenting with an unusual retention of the hairline (pseudo-fringe sign) have been described. Cause It is commonly seen with certain hair styles or braiding patterns that pull the hairline forcefully towards the vertex of the scalp, and has been reported more often in African American women (as some wear their hair tightly pulled back), in whom it can cause scarring. It has also been seen in female ballerinas, and in cultural traditions where the hair is voluntarily not cut in religious obeisance, the latter caused by progressively increasing weight of the hair itself. Traction alopecia is mechanical in cause, rather than androgenic, and treatment is typically not pharmaceutical. Management includes cessation of the chronic traction, cosmeses, with surgical restoration reserved for more severe cases. Traction alopecia is a substantial risk in hair weaves, which can be worn either to conceal hair loss, or purely for cosmetic purposes. The former involves creating a braid around the head below the existing hairline, to which an extended-wear hairpiece, or wig, is attached. Since the hair of the braid is still growing, it requires frequent maintenance, which involves the hairpiece being removed, the natural hair braided again, and the piece snugly reattached. The tight braiding and snug hairpiece cause tension on the hair that is already at risk for falling out. Traction Alopecia is one of the most common causes of hair loss in African American women. Sikh men are also susceptible to traction alopecia if the hair under the turban is tied too tightly for many years. Other causes include: * Hairstyle. Although the aforementioned style is one of the culprits, hairstyles such as dreadlocks and single (extension) braids can also have the same effect. Men and women who have suffered from traction alopecia have found that the hair loss occurs most at the hair line‚Äîprimarily around the temples and the sides of their heads. * Headgear. Compressive safety helmets worn tightly and closely to the scalp are a cause of traction alopecia. The lining of tightly fitted safety helmets like those worn for activities such as motorcycling, cycling, skiing and snowboarding are responsible for the constant rubbing and tugging of localised areas of the hair and scalp. Frequent wearers or those who use such helmets for prolonged periods seem more likely to suffer traction alopecia. * Chemicals. A condition known as CCCA (central cicatricial centrifugal alopecia), seen almost exclusively in African American women, can cause extensive hair loss. It is caused by a combination of too much stress (traction) on the hair and the use of harsh relaxers and dyes.

Origin The status of the sentence as an archetype for bad writing comes from the first phrase of the opening sentence (incipit) of English novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton's 1830 novel Paul Clifford:  Evaluations of the opening sentence  Writer's Digest described this sentence as \\"the literary posterchild for bad story starters\\". On the other hand, the American Book Review ranked it as No. 22 on its \\"Best first lines from novels\\" list. In 2008, Henry Lytton-Cobbold, a descendant of Bulwer-Lytton, participated in a debate in the town of Lytton, British Columbia with Scott Rice, the founder of the International Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest. Rice accused Bulwer-Lytton of writing \\"27 novels whose perfervid turgidity I intend to expose, denude, and generally make visible.\\" Lytton-Cobbold defended his ancestor, noting that he had coined many other phrases widely used today such as \\"the pen is mightier than the sword\\", \\"the great unwashed\\", and \\"the almighty dollar\\". He said that it was \\"rather unfair that Professor Rice decided to name the competition after him for entirely the wrong reasons.\\"] Later usage=Literature The Peanuts comic strip character Snoopy, in his imagined persona as the World Famous Author, sometimes begins his novels with the phrase \\"It was a dark and stormy night.\\" Cartoonist Charles Schulz made Snoopy use this phrase because \\"it was a clich√©, and had been one for a very long time\\". A book by Schulz, titled It Was a Dark and Stormy Night, Snoopy, and credited to Snoopy as author, was published by Holt, Rinehart, and Winston in 1971. Janet and Allan Ahlberg wrote a book titled It Was A Dark and Stormy Night in which a kidnapped boy must keep his captors entertained with his storytelling. It is the opening line in the popular 1962 novel A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle: L'Engle biographer Leonard Marcus notes that \\"With a wink to the reader, she chose for the opening line of A Wrinkle in Time, her most audaciously original work of fiction, that hoariest of cliches ... L'Engle herself was certainly aware of old warhorse's literary provenance as ... Edward Bulwer-Lytton's much maligned much parodied repository of Victorian purple prose, Paul Clifford.\\" This is an anthology of multiple biographical essays. The quote is from the introduction by the editor.

The Lex Iulia de Civitate Latinis (et sociis) Danda of 90 BC conferred Roman citizenship on all citizens of the Latin towns and the Italic towns who had not rebelled. The Lex Plautia Papiria de Civitate Sociis Danda of 89 BC granted Roman citizenship to all federated towns in Italy south of the River Po (in northern Italy). The Lex Pompeia de Transpadanis of 89 BC granted the ius Latii to the communities of Transpadania, a region north of the Po, which had sided with Rome during the Social War. It also granted Roman citizenship to those who became officials in their respective municipia (cities). The exact content of the ius Latii, under Roman law, varied from city to city. It could include some or all of the following rights: * Ius commercii: the right to trade, i. e., the right to have commercial relations and trade with Roman citizens on equal status and to use the same forms of contract as Roman citizens; * Ius connubii: the right to marry pursuant to law; * Ius migrationis: the right to migrate, i. e., the right to retain one‚Äôs degree of citizenship upon relocation to another municipium. In other words, Latin status was not lost when moving to other locales in Italy. * Ius suffragii: the right to vote, but only if they migrated to Rome. * Ius civitatis mutandae: the right to become Roman citizens. Outside of Italy, the term Latinitas continued to be used for other cases. Cicero used this term in relation to Julius Caesar's grant of Latin rights to the Sicilians in 44 BC.Cicero, ad Atticus, 14, 12. This use of \\"ius Latii\\" or \\"Latinitas\\" persisted to the reign of Emperor Justinian I in the sixth century AD. This status was later given to whole towns and regions: Emperor Vespasian granted it to the whole of HispaniaPliny the Elder, Natural History, 3, 4. and Emperor Hadrian gave it to many towns.Historia Augusta, The Life of Hadrian, 21.Some of the material for this paragraph is from Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities. Origin Rome was one of the many Latin cities of Italy. From 340 to 338 BC the Latin League, a confederation of circa 30 towns in Latium (land of the Latins) which was allied with Rome, rebelled in what has been called the Latin War. The Romans won the war and dissolved the Latin League. Many of the city-states of Latium were fully incorporated into the Roman Republic, while others were given limited rights and privileges which could be exercised in dealings with Roman citizens. These came to be known as ius Latii. The ius Latii was given to some Roman colonies which were founded around Italy in the fourth and third centuries BC to strengthen Roman control, as Rome expanded its hegemony over the peninsula. They were colonies which were given Latin legal status, and their settlers the ius Latii, instead of the Roman legal status of other colonies whose settlers were given Roman citizenship. Colonies of Latin status were called \\"Latin colonies\\" and those of Roman status were called \\"Roman colonies\\". Roman citizens who settled in a Latin colony lost their Roman citizenship and acquired ius Latii. Latin colonies were usually smaller than Roman colonies. With Roman expansion beyond Italy, Latin colonies were also founded outside Italy, e. g. Carteia (contemporary San Roque), which was founded in Hispania in 171 BC and was the first Latin colony outside of Italy. In 122 BC, the plebeian tribune Gaius Gracchus introduced a law which extended the ius Latii to all other residents of Italy. This reflected the increasing ties between Rome and the Italic peoples through trade and the ties between the leading families in the Italian towns and patrician families in Rome.Pearson, M., Perils of Empire: The Roman Republic and the American Republic (2008), p. 210 In 44 BC, Julius Caesar granted the ius Latii to all free-born Sicilians.Wilson, R. J. A., \\"Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica\\", in Bowman, A. K., Champlin, E., Lintott, A., (eds), The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 10: The Augustan Empire, 43 BC - AD 69 (1996), p. 434. Under the Empire Following the great spate of colonial settlements under Julius Caesar and Augustus, the ius Latii was used more as a political instrument that aimed at integration of provincial communities via their local leadership. Latin status included the acquisition of Roman citizenship upon the holding of municipal magistracy (ius adipiscendae civitatis per magistratum), which presumed a trajectory of development that would carry at least the local magistrates along the path to the institution of a Roman-style community. In AD 123, Emperor Hadrian made a key modification to Latin rights. He introduced \\"Latium maius\\" (\\"greater Latin [rights]\\"), which conferred Roman citizenship on all the decurions of a town as opposed to \\"Latium minus\\", which conferred it only on those who held a magistracy.Birley, \\"Hadrian and the Antonines\\", in Bowman, A.K., Garnsey. P., The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 11: The High Empire, AD 70 (2000), P. 139Studi in onore di Remo Martini, Vol. 3 (Guffre Editore), 210, p. 470 The acquisition of ius Latii was wholly dependent on imperial gift. This beneficence could span the whole range from grants to individuals to awards made to whole towns, and could even be applied to an entire population, as when Emperor Vespasian gave the ius Latii to all of Hispania in AD 74. Although this decree could encompass whole cities, it is important to note that it did not necessarily entail the establishment of a municipium (self-governing town). Often, as in Hispania, formal municipia might have been constituted several years after the initial grant.

As of 2020, school review website Niche ranks Catlin Gabel as the number one best overall private high school and number one best high school for STEM in the state of Oregon. History With roots that go back to 1859, the school was formed by the 1957 merger between the Catlin Hillside School (founded in 1911 as Miss Catlin's School, named after the founder Ruth Catlin) and the Gabel Country Day School (originating as the Portland Academy, named after founder Priscilla Gabel). The school had initially hoped to expand onto the Gabel school property, but lost it to eminent domain. Since the Catlin property was too small to support the school, Catlin Gabel purchased the Honey Hollow Farm in 1958, relocating the Upper School there in the fall. Nine years later, the Middle School relocated there, followed by the Lower School a year later, in 1968. The school sold the Catlin Hillside buildings to the Portland Art Museum for its art school. The buildings were later converted to a community center for the Hillside neighborhood. In 2005, the Malone Family Foundation endowed Catlin Gabel with a $2 million grant for financial aid under its Malone Scholars Program. Students As of the 2014‚Äì15 school year, there were 760 students. The student body is divided into four groups: Upper School (grades 9‚Äì12), Middle School (grades 6‚Äì8), Lower School (grades 1‚Äì5), and Beginning School (preschool through kindergarten). Academics Catlin Gabel is accredited by the Northwest Association of Independent Schools (NWAIS). Science research Catlin Gabel has a long history of science research competition success. Over the years, many scientists have placed highly in competitions such as the Intel Science Talent Search, the Siemens Competition, the Davidson Fellows Scholarship, and the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. The school ranked #1 on Oregon's 25 Best K-12 Schools for 2018, according to the Portland Business Journal. Activities Catlin Gabel has operated a team in the FIRST Robotics Competition since 2005, called \\"The Flaming Chickens\\". The team has consistently qualified for the FIRST World Championships competition almost every year. Catlin Gabel has been a successful participant in the Oregon Mock Trial competition, and has often gone to the national competition. Sports Catlin Gabel's traditional rival in athletics is the Oregon Episcopal School. The Middle School fields teams of soccer, volleyball, cross-country, basketball, and track. The Upper School competes in soccer, cross-country, basketball, baseball, track, golf, swimming, skiing, women's volleyball, and tennis.  School traditions  Some of the early traditions at Catlin Gabel School included the beginning-of-the- year ‚ÄúBacon Bat‚Äù picnic. Bacon Bat is an event involving games, competitions and a cookout with the intention of building school spirit. The first ‚ÄúClean- Up Day‚Äù took place in 1937, and the school has continued that tradition since. Though the name of this tradition has been renamed to Campus Day, the central idea of taking care of the school's campus is still at the heart of it. Additionally, in 1931 students first performed ‚ÄúSt. George and the Dragon,‚Äù a tradition which has been going on since. Students still remember ‚ÄúSt. George‚Äù as one of the highlights of their time in middle school. One of the most common traditions has been the recitation of the School Chapter, a tradition dating back to 1935 for ninth graders to memorize I Corinthians 13 in their English 9 classes. This rummage sale was similar to a large garage sale ‚Äì‚Äì people would donate items that would be sorted and then later sold. The ‚ÄúRummage Sale‚Äù became a school tradition. Faculty sexual assault and misconduct allegations Beginning in 2017, several former students began writing about sexual abuse by faculty on social media. Coinciding with the Me Too movement, the number of accounts increased, prompting the school to commission an investigation in October 2019. The investigation issues a report on November 11, 2019. It found that at least 21 Catlin Gabel faculty had taken advantage of their positions at the school in committing various degrees of sexual impropriety. This ranged from the rape of a 6th grade minor to generally inappropriate behavior and relationships between faculty and students that went back as early as the 1960s and was recorded occurring as recently as 2016. In December 2019, the Washington County Sheriff's Department opened a criminal investigation of the school. In January 2020, The Oregonian documented allegations by over 15 former students from age 21 to 61. Six more former students sued the school in April 2020 saying they were fondled, groped, and sexually abused by former teachers Richardson Shoemaker, Robert Ashe, Art Leo and Sam Crawley. A total of 16 former students have filed suit against Catlin Gabel.

He played in Major League Baseball for the Florida Marlins, New York Mets, and Minnesota Twins from 1996 through 2010. Castillo is a three-time All-Star, three-time Gold Glove winner, and won the World Series with the Marlins in 1997 and 2003. He is also the only player who played for the Marlins in both of their World Series winning seasons who did not get traded in between the two seasons.  Professional career = Early career  On August 19, 1992, Castillo was signed as a non-drafted free agent by the Florida Marlins. In 1994, he played his first year of baseball in the Gulf Coast League, playing for the Gulf Coast Marlins. He also set a Marlins short-season record in stolen bases, with 31. In 1995, he was called up to the Kane County Cougars in the Class-A Midwest League, and was selected to the All-Star team. He injured his shoulder in July, causing him to miss the rest of the season. That year, he led the entire Marlins organization in batting average with .326, as well as being second in stolen bases. Castillo spent most of the 1996 season in the Eastern League, but was called up to the Marlins mid-season and made his major league debut on August 8. His first major league hit came in a game against the New York Mets, where he knocked in the game-winning run in the 10th inning. He was named to the Eastern League All-Star team and post-season All-Star team.  Florida Marlins  1997‚Äì99 = Castillo started playing full-time for the Marlins at second base during the 1997 season. Both at age 21, he and √âdgar Renter√≠a were the youngest middle infield combination in the history of the National League. He bruised his left heel mid-season, and missed the entire month of May with the injury. He was optioned to the Triple-A Charlotte Knights on July 28 and did not come back to the major leagues until the next season. Due to this, he did not play for the Marlins during the 1997 World Series. Castillo remained with the Charlotte Knights until being recalled to the Marlins on August 4, 1998. While in Charlotte, he had a streak of 32 consecutive games reaching base safely. With the Marlins, his highest hit streak was eight games, between August 14 and 19. By the end of the season, he was third among Marlins minor leaguers in stolen bases, and a .203 batting average, 3 stolen bases and 10 RBIs. Castillo improved in 1999, with many short hitting streaks. These streaks included six games from May 10 to 17, and six games from August 1 to 7. He also had a 22-game hitting streak in a stretch between August 9 and September 3. He finished fourth in the league in stolen bases, and was fourth among leadoff hitters in on-base percentage at .385. He was named the Marlins Most Valuable Player by the South Florida Chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. = 2000‚Äì02 = Castillo started the 2000 season with a seven-game hitting streak from April 5 to 12, though he was placed on the disabled list with a strained back shortly afterwards. A week after coming back, he set a single-game team record with four stolen bases on May 17. He had three in the next game, falling short of the National League record of 8 in two games, set by Walt Wilmot in 1894. In 2000, he also became the Marlins all-time stolen base leader by stealing his 116th career base on June 20 while playing the Milwaukee Brewers. He finished the season with 62 stolen bases, leading the entire major leagues. In 2001, Castillo had two hitting streaks, eight games from May 6 to 13 and 14 games from June 29 to July 22. He finished fifth in the league in stolen bases with 33. He also had a .263 batting average, 45 RBIs, and 10 triples, a career high. In 2002, Castillo had a 35-game hitting streak, which is the longest ever by a second baseman (since matched by fellow second baseman Chase Utley of the Philadelphia Phillies in 2006). This was the sixth-longest streak in the history of the National League, and also the 10th longest in the history of Major League Baseball.New York Times Castillo played second base in the 2002 All-Star Game, the first All-Star selection of his career. In 2002, he hit .305 with 39 RBIs and 48 stolen bases, leading the league in stolen bases for the second time in his career. He was again named the Marlins Most Valuable Player by the South Florida Chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. = 2003‚Äì05 = Batting for the Minnesota Twins in 2006 Castillo was a member of the National League All-Star team in 2003, his second career All-Star selection. He also led the Marlins in hitting and won his first career Gold Glove Award. Castillo was a central figure in the NLCS Game 6 comeback by the Marlins against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field after a foul ball that he hit was knocked away from the Cubs' Mois√©s Alou by fan Steve Bartman. The Marlins went on to win that game, as well as Game 7, to get to the 2003 World Series, in which the Marlins defeated the heavily favored New York Yankees. This was the second World Series of Castillo's career, but the first in which he actually played. In 2004, Castillo had a .291 batting average with 47 RBIs, a career best. He also had two home runs and seven triples. He was second only to Juan Pierre on the Marlins with a .373 on-base percentage and set a Marlins record with his 425th career walk, passing Gary Sheffield's previous mark of 424. Castillo won his second straight Gold Glove and posted the National League's second-best fielding percentage at second base (.991), behind Philadelphia's Pl√°cido Polanco. In his final season with the Marlins, Castillo won his third Gold Glove award in a row. He led the majors in batting versus left-handed pitchers with a .423 average. Castillo was also a member of the 2005 National League All-Star team, and replaced Jeff Kent of the Los Angeles Dodgers at second base in the second inning. He was traded to the Minnesota Twins on December 2, 2005, in exchange for two minor leaguers, Scott Tyler and Travis Bowyer. The Marlins replaced Castillo at second base with Dan Uggla, a Rule 5 selection from the Arizona Diamondbacks.  Minnesota Twins  Castillo takes a lead on June 23, 2008 In 2006, Castillo began his only full season playing for the Minnesota Twins. He had an impressive first month of hitting, batting .432 with 19 hits. Over that stretch, Castillo drove in runs in five straight games from April 13 to 19. Castillo had three four-hit games for the Twins this season, on April 15, August 5, and August 9. He had a six-game hitting streak from May 6 to 13, and recorded his 300th career stolen base while facing the Chicago White Sox on August 26. In the 2007 season, Castillo set a new Major League Baseball record, going 143 games at second base without an error. He also recorded his 1,500th career hit on May 29 while facing the Chicago White Sox. Castillo was traded by the Twins to the New York Mets on July 30, 2007 for two minor league players, catcher Drew Butera and outfielder Dustin Martin. He finished the season with a .301 batting average with one home run, 38 RBIs and 19 stolen bases. On November 18, the Mets re-signed him to a four-year contract worth a reported $25 million.  New York Mets  Castillo had a strong finish to the 2007 season after being traded. He reached base safely in 40 of his last 46 games, and scored 34 runs in his last 42 games. In 50 games as a Met, Castillo batted .296 with 20 RBIs and 10 stolen bases. In 2008, a year plagued with injuries and several bench stints, Castillo hit .245 in 87 games, but still managed to steal 17 bases in 19 attempts. In 2009 spring training, Castillo led all major league players in walks, with 17 from 56 official at-bats. On March 16, 2009, Castillo was presented the opportunity to bat right-handed instead of being a switch hitter. He declined, and continued to be a switch hitter throughout the rest of his career. Although the Mets struggled as a team, Castillo enjoyed a bounce-back year in '09, hitting .302 with 77 runs scored and a .387 on-base percentage. However, on June 12, with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning and runners on first and second base, Castillo dropped an easy pop fly hit by Alex Rodriguez for a two-run game-ending error at Yankee Stadium, earning him a measure of infamy in the Mets‚ÄìYankees rivalry and a place in Mets' history. On June 4, 2010, the Mets put Castillo on the disabled list because of problems in both his feet. He was replaced by Rub√©n Tejada who played at second base in the Mets' 5‚Äì4 win against the Florida Marlins at Citi Field. He was criticized, along with Carlos Beltr√°n and √ìliver P√©rez, for not going to the hospital that had soldiers who had amputated arms and legs; he claimed that he did not want to be horrified by the experience. Castillo commented on not being happy with his playing time and \\"has to work something out this offseason\\". During spring training of 2010, he was booed by the home fans at Digital Domain Park where the Mets play their spring training games. He was released from the Mets spring training roster on March 18, 2011.  Philadelphia Phillies  On March 21, 2011, Castillo signed a minor league deal with the Philadelphia Phillies. On March 22, he reported to Phillies training camp. Castillo was released shortly thereafter on March 30, 2011. He appeared on the ballot for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum 2016 election and earned zero votes. Career statistics In 1,720 games over 15 seasons, Castillo posted a .290 batting average (1,889-for-6,510) with 1,001 runs, 194 doubles, 59 triples, 28 home runs, 443 RBI, 370 stolen bases, 800 bases on balls, .368 on-base percentage and .351 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .984 fielding percentage playing every inning of his major league career at second base. In 20 postseason games, he hit .220 (18-for-82) with 6 runs, 4 doubles, 4 RBI, 3 stolen bases and 11 walks.  Personal life  Castillo graduated from the class of 1991 at Colegio San Benito Abad in the Dominican Republic. He is married and has two children‚ÄîLuis Jr., born on October 12, 2001, and Adonai, born on July 30, 2009. In August 2019, Castillo was cited on charges related to a drug trafficking and money laundering operation, while Octavio Dotel was arrested on related charges. In late August 2019, Castillo was cleared of money laundering charges, and it was determined that there was no evidence to link Castillo to any money laundering activity.

Interior of Memorial Centre. The Kingston Memorial Centre is a 3,300-seat multi-purpose arena located at 303 York Street in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Opened in 1951, the Kingston Community Memorial Health and Recreation Centre was designed as a community sports and entertainment centre that would become a \\"living memorial\\" in remembrance of Kingstonians who gave their life in both world wars and the Korean War (Planning Partnership-Hughes Downey Architects 2007, p. 5). The Memorial Centre lands and facilities include a war memorial, a large ice pad in the arena building, a new outdoor aquatic centre, agricultural barns, softball diamonds, a cinder track, off leash dog park and a linear park at the east, north and west perimeter of the property. Just east of the arena building was the International Hockey Hall of Fame (IHHOF) museum building at 277 York St. In July 2012, Kingston City Council approved the relocation of the collection on a short-term basis to the Invista Centre on Gardiners Road in Kingston. The existing building was found to have costly repair issues related to moisture penetration. It was demolished after the IHHOF moved to the Invista Centre in Kingston's west end. The Memorial Centre land has been publicly owned since it was acquired in 1841 by the British Government. Its cultural significance reflects local Kingston agricultural, military and recreational history (Planning Partnership-Hughes Downey Architects 2007, p. 4). As the Memorial Centre building aged consideration was given by the City of Kingston for ways to rehabilitate the property. In 1993 Parkin Consultants Limited issued a Final Report on the possible uses of the property based primarily on 1980s data. In 1987, the Kingston Canadians junior hockey club was the main tenant with 60% of the facilities events. Entertainment programing accounted for 12% and trade or consumer shows 24% of events. In 1987 there were $774,862 in ticket sales, facility rentals and other income. But operating costs were $1,093,473. The Parkin report noted that the deficit of $318,311 could be reduced with decreased through measures to reduce maintenance and energy costs and by increasing rent, ticket sales, and canteen revenues. The Memorial Centre was the home to the Kingston Frontenacs ice hockey team and its predecessors, the Kingston Canadians and Kingston Raiders from 1973‚Äì2008. It was also home to the Kingston Frontenacs of the Eastern Professional Hockey League from 1959-1963. When a new downtown arena, the Leon's Centre opened in 2008, the Frontenacs moved to the new facility, playing their last game at the Memorial Centre on February 15, 2008. The Kingston Memorial Centre is the site of the annual Kingston Fall Fair operated by the Kingston and District Agricultural Society.http://www.kingstonfair.com Kingston & District Agricultural Society Established in Kingston in 1830 as the Midland Fair and revived in 1912, the Kingston Fall Fair is held over four days each September. It is the second oldest Fair in Ontario, with attendance over 16,000. The society sponsors the Fair with the objective of promoting education through agriculture. The fair includes the largest dairy show held in Ontario.http://kingston.cioc.ca/record/KGN2228 Kingston & District Agricultural Society background Since the 1950s the Memorial Centre has been used for many cultural and recreational events including performances by Johnny Cash in 1958 and 1987.

After 2008, the Memorial Centre became the permanent home of the Queen's Golden Gaels (Queen‚Äôs varsity hockey), figure skating, and Queen‚Äôs intramural ice sports. It replaced the Jock Harty Arena which had been demolished to allow for the construction of new athletic facilities at Queen's University. The Church Athletic League of Kingston hockey teams are based at the centre. History In 1792, John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of the province of Upper Canada, assisted with the formation of the Agricultural Society of Upper Canada based at Niagara-on-the-Lake to further the development of agriculture in Upper Canada. The society helped to promote agriculture through local agricultural societies and fairs. On July 12, 1825, the Upper Canada Herald contained an advertisement for the Frontenac Agricultural Society Fair to be held near Kingston. The fair operated on and off until 1925. That year the group reorganized under the name of the Kingston and District Agricultural Society. It has operated the Kingston Fair successfully since that time. As of 1855 the Midland Agricultural Association (which later evolved into the Frontenac Agricultural Society) leased a 23-acre site at the north end of the federal penitentiary reserve bounded on two sides by Palace and Bath Roads. There they built the Crystal Palace (hence the name Palace Road) in 1858 which was moved to the south-east corner of the Memorial Centre site at York and Alfred and re-erected in 1880 after they acquired the land. Frontenac Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Joseph Longford Haycock (1894 to 1898) served for a number of years as President of the Frontenac Agricultural Association. The association sold the land to the City of Kingston in January, 1897 for $17,000. (See transfer dated July 5, 1897, Instrument no. CK13650 and Abstract Index 36072-0235 (R) for Land Registry Office #134). Some of the buildings were transferred from the penitentiary grounds along with the Crystal Palace. A 1915 fire insurance map shows buildings (poultry, dairy, horse barns and exhibition building), a grandstand and half-mile track and palace on the property. Capital fund raising In November 1944 the Corporation of the City of Kingston passed a by-law for the Establishment, Development and Management of the Kingston Community Memorial Health and Recreation Centre and a by-law authorizing debentures of $100,000 toward the establishment of the centre. But money was not to be provided until the building committee raised $225,000 from the community. The Legislative Assembly of Ontario confirmed the expenditure in Bill 9, \\"An Act respecting the City of Kingston\\" which received Third Reading on March 22, 1945. A campaign fund raising pamphlet indicates objective of $400,000 plus $100,000 from the City of Kingston. Donations of more than $38,000 had been received from 65 donors in the closing months of 1945. The pamphlet includes reference to \\"the grounds enclosed by the already established half-mile race track‚Ä¶ will be used for softball and baseball diamonds, tennis courts etc\\".Memorial Centre Fund Raising Campaign pamphlet, c.1945 By August 1945, at the end of World War II, $80,000 had been raised for the building of the centre. In 1949 Bill Henderson was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for Kingston and the Islands. In 1950 Henderson found federal funds through the Minister of Agriculture for the centre. But the capital funding was tied to the project being dedicated to agricultural purposes and activities as there were no federal funds for an arena. Further capital funding came from the Province of Ontario.Kingston Whig Standard, Ken Cuthbertson City of Kingston and Agricultural Society, 1950 agreement In a 1950 agreementExplanatory Memo dated March 21, 2006 by Legal counsel for the Corporation of the City of Kingston between the City of Kingston and the Agricultural Society, the Society assigned grants of $300,000 ($150,000 by the Government of Canada and $150,000 by the Province of Ontario) to the city with the following provisions: \\\\- provides for a Memorial Centre Board (this local board was terminated with the 1997 Provincial Amalgamation Order creating the new City of Kingston and was replaced by an Advisory Committee; the City took over all functions of Board) \\\\- s. 2: rights to use are subject to the Society abiding by regulations and rates set by the City of Kingston \\\\- s. 2(a) Society has right to use and enjoyment of Fair Grounds, Auditorium and other ancillary buildings and equipment of the Kingston Community Health Recreation Centre for the period when fairs are held. This right does not generally extend beyond the period in September when fairs are held. \\\\- 2(b) Society has use and enjoyment of other buildings and erections constructed for the purposes of advancing interests of agriculture. [structures are owned by the City of Kingston] \\\\- 2( c) Society has use and enjoyment of the auditorium when not otherwise allocated or required by the Board of Trustees, for the purposes of the Society. [the \\"Auditorium\\" is the arena area and the City of Kingston allocates use of it fully throughout year] \\\\- 2(d) to have expended toward the cost of constructing other buildings for purposes of advancing interests of agriculture, an amount equal to 50% of net profit from operating the Centre [since there has never been a net profit from operations this section of the agreement has never been operative]. Recent history In November 2003, Harvey Rosen was elected mayor of the City of Kingston by a resounding margin. A major plank in his campaign was his commitment to solve the issue of the aging Kingston Memorial Centre, the home to the local OHL hockey team the Kingston Frontenacs, which had a game cancelled during the election campaign due to a leaky roof. The Memorial Centre built in 1951 had not been kept up-to-date during its existence and did not now meet promoters and performers needs. Very few performers had performed at the Memorial in the prior 15 years. There had been a number of studies and attempts in the past two decades to address the issues by either renovating the Memorial Centre or building a new facility. Mayor Rosen had committed during his campaign to appoint a citizen task force to explore the problem and present a solution including funding suggestions within 100 days. In April 2004 the Mayor‚Äôs Task Force submitted its report to the Mayor which contained 22 recommendations; the main recommendation was to build a new large venue entertainment centre (lvec) in downtown Kingston. The mayor presented the report to city council and city council constituted a five-person council committee to verify the validity of the report. The committee and then city council verified the general validity of the report in particular the recommendation to build a 5,500 seat venue in downtown Kingston and constituted a steering committee of public and city council members to make its own implentation recommendations to see a lvec become a reality, including develop a funding solution, as the funding suggestions in the Mayor's Task Force Report were far from complete, it being implicit that a full funding solution would have to be presented to council for approval. Although selling a portion of the Memorial Centre was suggested in recommendation 7 of the mayors Taxk Force Report the steering committee made alternate recommendations regarding funding the new centre which did not include selling any portion of the Memorial Centre grounds to the joy of most of the community. Council endorsed the recommendations of their steering committee. Although controversial at the time, some in community thinking that the Memorial Centre had been saved from the abyss, the truth is that the recommendation of the volunteer member's of the Mayor's Task Force to sell a portion of the Memorial Centre was never brought to a vote at City Council. Although council's steering committee had not tabled its final report regarding the implementation plan for council approval, there was community pressure to address the volunteer task forces finance recommendation to use the Memorial Centre as a financing source. Though the sale of Memorial Centre was never more than a funding idea presented by a citizen‚Äôs task force, and although there was never an indication that it was going to be adopted by the steering committee, Council didn't remove it from the business plan for a year and a half and deferred a motion to do so in November, 2004. [source: Council minutes] At the November, 2004 Council meeting delegations were made before Council including that by a local architect who presented her research showing Williamsville District has by far the least park, recreational and cultural space per capita (less than 2/3 of the next lowest District (Kingscourt Strathcona) and pointed out the Official Plan designation of Memorial Centre, singled out as a significant element in the recreational land use system,as Open Area Space and Recreational Space. The Official Plan provides that public open space shall not be sold or alienated in any way unless disposal is warranted by extenuating circumstances and that disposal of any public open space shall be discouraged. This delegation also noted that the Ontario Provincial Policy Statement promoted the equitable distribution of publicly accessible built and natural settings for recreation. Another delegation presented statistics on the importance of recreational facilities and park space to physical health. Petitions presented to Council between March 30, 2005 and November 20, 2005 totaling 7,380 signatures opposed the sale of the property, the destruction of the building, and the loss of much-needed public park and recreational lands. The signatories recognized the facilities as a living Memorial to those to sacrificed their lives for our Country and, as such, should continue to serve their purpose as a focal point for the many and varied community activities in the neighbourhoods and the City. [Source: Council minutes; see also letters to Friends of the Memorial Centre from City Clerk dated March 30, 2005, April 20, 2005, May 4, 2005, May 20, 2005, and November 10, 2005 when the majority of signatures were presented] In November, 2005, Kingston City Council unanimously passed the November, 2004 motion to save the Memorial Centre with some amendments: \\\\- voted unanimously to endorse the use of the site as public community facilities \\\\- to strike a revitalization committee \\\\- to hold a public meeting before a report on revitalization was brought back to the City =Mandate of the Memorial Centre Revitalization Committee= The Memorial Centre Revitalization Committee has a mandate to prepare and recommend to City Council a development concept plan and detailed multi-year implementation strategy for revitalization and rejuvenation of the entire 23 acre Memorial Centre site as a public community recreational facility or facilities that will also serve as a fitting living memorial to the men and women of Kingston who lost their lives in the two world wars, the Korean war and subsequent military commitments. The committee would ensure ongoing and inclusive community consultation on the use and operation of the Centre. In November 2006, a City Workshop report on a Planning Partnership for the Memorial Centre was released.  Planning Approach Over 120 interest groups and agencies were contacted for the report, including the Agricultural Society which indicated the need for improved fencing for crowd control; and improve and increase indoor display space and promote education. In July 2007, a Planning Partnership Concept Plan and detailed a multi-year implementation process for the Revitalization and Rejuvenation of the Memorial Centre site report was presented by the City of Kingston. It identifies the Kingston District Agricultural Society (KDAS) as an important stakeholder and the need to respond to physical requirements of the annual fall fair. Members of the design team met with Fair Board to try to understand those needs (see p. 10)http://www.cityofkingston.ca/pdf/cityhall/committees/memorialcentre/agendas/2007/MC_A0407-SchedA.pdf Final Report on the Revitalization of the Memorial Centre Site Planning Partnership-Hughes Downey Architects, 2007 At a City of Kingston Revitalization Committee meeting held in October 2008, it was noted that it would be difficult to plan for entire site until the completion of discussions with the Agricultural Society on the needs of the Fair. In May 2009, Kingston City Council approved the building of a linear park on the east, west and north side of the Centre. Fencing was designed to meet the needs of the Kingston District Agricultural Society during the Fall Fair in September. In February 2010, a linear park was developed in part through discussions by the City with the Agricultural Society to ensure there was no negative impact on the Fall Fair. For example, temporary fencing was not adequate for animal control. In July 2010, a City of Kingston Traffic Division staff report does not support proposed pedestrian crossings as it asserts that traffic does not have to yield. In May 2011, an e-mail to Friends and Neighbours of the Memorial Centre from City staff noted that the Kingston Community can be very proud of its contribution in reshaping the venue including the creation or sustaining of: * accessible walking paths * off leash dog park, shade structure * local hockey leagues * men's and women's university hockey * a splash pad * a lazy river pool * a 10m swimming pool * diving pool * zero entry pool * shade structures and lounge chairs * running track * continuation of the Fall Fair * softball diamonds * community gardens office * softball diamonds * pollinator garden * new memorial gardens * memorial walls * the Kingston and District Agricultural Society office Kingston Memorial Centre Advisory Committee The City of Kingston, Kingston Memorial Centre Advisory Committee  Mandate: Kingston Memorial Centre Advisory Committee advises City Council and staff on the following issues: *Capital upgrades to the Kingston Memorial Centre site and related facilities and amenities. *Future developments and plans for the Kingston Memorial Centre site and facilities and amenities. *Community partnerships and programs Committee Members for 2011-12 Councillor Sandy Berg, Councillor Jim Neill, Janine Handforth, Michael Dakin, David Garrick, Steve Garrison, Ken Ohtake Memorial Centre Farmers‚Äô Market In 2012, Kingston City Council approved the establishment of a new farmers' market at the Memorial Centre. The Memorial Centre Farmers‚Äô Market started up on May 20, 2012. It promotes local food grown and produced within about 100 km of the market. The market's goal is to expand the market for \\"sustainably-produced food in Kingston\\".http://memorialcentrefarmersmarket.ca/about/ About the Memorial Centre Farmers' Market School development proposal In early summer 2012, news of discussions to sell part of the Memorial Centre to the Limestone District School Board for a new high school was released. Early public comment on the suggestion was largely negative and city councillors seem divided on the issue.http://www.emckingston.ca/20120719/news/A+school+at+Memorial+Centre%3F+City+council+drawn+into+school+closure+debate A school at Memorial Centre? City council drawn into school closure debate July 19, 2012 By Bill Hutchins, EMC Kingston The results of any further discussions between the City and the school board were undecided as of early 2013. On June 4, 2013 Kingston City Council adopted a motion to not sell any of the land at the Memorial Centre or the Cook's Brothers Arena for a new school building. A year later, in June 2014, Kingston City Council re confirmed its 2013 decision not to sell any portion of the property. On February 3, 2015, the newly elected Kingston City Council, featuring seven (of thirteen) first-time Councillors, voted 9-3 NOT to consider the property for a school.https://www.cityofkingston.ca/documents/10180/7762529/COU_Minutes-0615.pdf/32edf6e1-3a97-4952-90b8-31fd74c9ff9e This was completely a politically motivated move as the VAST majority of Williamsville constituents and parents with school age children wanted the Memorial Centre site for the new school.http://www.thewhig.com/2015/11/03/m-centre-site-best-for-school References ;Notes  Bibliography  * External links * City of Kingston - Kingston Memorial Centre * Kingston Memorial Centre The OHL Arena & Travel Guide * Memorable Memorial Centre Concerts www.thewhig.com April 30, 2008; A look back at some of the musicians who played the Memorial Centre since it opened in 1951, for example, Johnny Cash, 1958 and Oct. 21, 1987. * KC DESIGN Kingston Centre Logo for the period 1980 to 1997, \\"The drawing is lined for the colours red and blue.\\"; Services linked to the logo for the period: Sport, recreational and entertainment activities, more particularly described as ice hockey, figure skating, public skating, basketball, indoor soccer, lacrosse, outdoor soccer, baseball, softball, exhibitions (including trade shows, car shows, home appliance shows), fairs, flea markets, rock concerts, country and western concerts, swimming, circuses, dog shows, horse shows, banquets and dances. * Kingston Memorial Centre Images * Memorial Centre Farmers' Market Category:Sports venues in Kingston, Ontario Category:Indoor arenas in Ontario Category:Indoor ice hockey venues in Canada Category:Fairgrounds in Canada ","title":"Kingston Memorial Centre"},{"id":"1888333","text":"Sandeep or Sundeep (Devanagari: ‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä‡§™‡•ç sandƒ´p or ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä‡§™‡•ç sa·πÉdƒ´p) is a common Indian given name.

After conquering the Japanese settlements on Tsushima and Iki islands, Kublai Khan's fleet moved on to Japan proper and landed at Hakata Bay, a short distance from Ky≈´sh≈´'s administrative capital of Dazaifu. Despite the superior weapons and tactics of the Mongols, who established the Yuan dynasty in China in 1271, the Yuan forces that disembarked at Hakata Bay were grossly outnumbered by the samurai force; the Japanese had been preparing, mobilizing warriors and reinforcing defenses since they heard of the defeats at Tsushima and Iki. The Japanese defenders were aided by major storms which sunk a sizable portion of the Mongolian fleets. Ultimately, the invasion attempt was decisively repulsed shortly after the initial landings. The Yuan troops withdrew and took refuge on their ships after only one day of fighting. A typhoon that night, said to be divinely conjured wind, threatened their ships, persuading them to return to Korea. Many of the returning ships sank that night due to the storm.Davis, Paul K. (2001). The battle After landing in the bay, the Yuan force quickly overran the town of Hakata (now a ward of Fukuoka), but were engaged by a number of samurai soon afterwards. At first, the samurai were hopelessly outmatched; accustomed to smaller scale clan rivalries, they could not match the organization and massed firepower of the invaders. The Mongols fought with precision, loosing heavy volleys of arrows into the ranks of the Japanese. The Mongols also employed an early form of rocket artillery, and their infantry used phalanx-like tactics, holding off the samurai with their shields and spears. Though unable to conclusively defeat the Yuan forces, the Japanese fought hard and inflicted heavy casualties. In the course of the day's fighting, the Hakozaki Shrine was burned to the ground.Turnbull, Stephen R. (2003). Despite their initial victories, the Yuan did not pursue the samurai further inland to the defenses at Dazaifu.Davis, Nihon ≈ådai Ichiran explains that the invaders were defeated because they lacked arrows.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). More likely this was a result of their unfamiliarity with the terrain, the expectation of Japanese reinforcements, and the heavy losses already suffered. The Yuan force, which may have intended to carry out a reconnaissance in force rather than an immediate invasion, returned to their ships. That night, the Yuan lost roughly one-third of their force in a typhoon. They retreated back to Korea, presumably at the prodding of their sailors and captains,Davis, rather than regrouping and continuing their attack.

When Rover Scouts were part of Scouting in the UK, the Group included a Rover Crew, the 13th Oxford. The stated aim of the group is to enable members of the University of Oxford to ‚Äúmaintain, acquire, or renew an interest in the Scout and Guide Movements‚Äù.  History  The group was founded in 1919 under the name of \\"O.U.B.P. Scout Club\\", with the first formal meeting held on 24 November that year. Women were first admitted to OUSGG the following year. For a number of years, the group ran in parallel with Oxford University Rover Crew and Oxford University Girl Guide Club, until 1939, when these merged into the Scout group. In 1940 the O.U. Guide Club was reformed, though it turned out it had never officially disbanded. Missing records make the exact tracking of various mergers and separations between the Rover, Scout, and Guide groups difficult, but the name Oxford University Scout and Guide Group was officially accepted when the group constitution was rewritten in 1962. For 50 years the Group camped in the Easter vacation, and the late summer vacation, at the Ennerdale Scout Camp of the Cumbria Scout Country.Oxford University Scout and Guide Group history The Group was responsible for organising the first two international Scout and Guide camps at Gilwell Park in 1959 and 1961.History of OUSGG, 1955 - 1963 These events are called Witans, named after the Anglo- Saxon gathering of the wise called a Witan.  Membership  Its membership mainly comprises members of the University of Oxford; however within certain limits other people may join. It is affiliated to the Student Scout and Guide Organisation (SSAGO). During the University's term the group meets on Monday nights, with a lunchtime meeting (‚ÄòNnN‚Äô) held on Thursdays. During University vacations the group goes on trips, the most notable being ‚ÄúWinter Walking‚Äù held over the New Year.  Mascot  The mascot of the group is Erik the Panda. Erik is a stuffed toy, given to the group in 1974, by a member formerly of St Hugh's College. At this time his name was spelled Eric; this has changed over the years, and has even at times been spelled with a backwards k. His \\"birthday\\" is celebrated at the meeting preceding Shrove Tuesday. Erik's official costume is sub-fusc, including a commoners' gown embroidered with the group name, and a mortarboard - though the latter has been lost.  Publication  PostScript is the thrice-termly publication of the Group. It is not only a newsletter informing members, ex-members and old members of upcoming events and activities, but also serves as a permanent record of the group's history. A copy of each new issue is stored in the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford.Postscript magazine See also *Student Scout and Guide Organisation *Delftsche Zwervers probably the oldest student Scout group in the world ReferencesExternal links *Oxford University Scout and Guide Group *Student Scout And Guide Organisation Category:Youth organizations established in 1919 Scout and Guide Group Category:Scouting and Guiding in the United Kingdom ","title":"Oxford University Scout and Guide Group"},{"id":"1888365","text":"The Episcopal School of Dallas (ESD) is an independent, co-educational preparatory day school located in Dallas, Texas. History The Episcopal School of Dallas is a coeducational academic community founded in 1974 by Stephen B. Swann and a group of Episcopalian local leaders. The first ESD class was held in 1974 and included eight 7th graders. Today, approximately 1,150 students attend ESD, aged Beginner (age 3) through 12th grade, with 435 students in the Upper School (9th ‚Äì 12th grade). David L. Baad is the Head of School. Campus The campus, which is continuing to expand, contains three major buildings, with a total of 248,000 sq ft (23,000 m¬≤) in facilities.\\"ESD is situated on three campuses and continues to develop\\" CJMARTINS.COM. Accessed 10/30/2012. The campus encompasses over . The school's first building, the gymnasium, was built in the late 1970s. Until the main building was in 1981, classes were held in the gym. In 1986, the school had another major expansion, which added a library, publication suite, and fine arts facilities, along with additional classrooms and offices. The Cook Math and Science Building was completed in 1994 to allow the construction of additional science labs, computer labs, and math classrooms. Daily chapel was moved from the gym to the All Saints Chapel following its completion in 2002. In 2005, another project, the Susan M. Frank Center for Arts and Humanities Building opened, allowing for the construction of additional humanities classrooms, as well as expanded music facilities. In addition, the school also offers a Proscenium and a black box theater, ceramics studio, and a digital imaging suite and darkroom. Additional improvements include a 55,000 sq ft (5,100 m¬≤) humanities building added to the Merrell Road campus, a new stadium and new turf field, and improved locker room facilities. The new stadium also features improved accommodations for fans. The school also acquired an outdoor education center in northern Collin County, spanning spans 165 acres (0.67 km¬≤). In 2010, the school opened its Stephen B. Swann Athletic and Wellness Center. The building houses Dining Commons, physical education facilities, and additional office space. The building, covering over 100,00 sq.ft., also includes a gymnasium, indoor track, conditioning and workout facilities, a dance studio, and sports medicine facilities. The building was later modified to expand locker rooms and add a team room and athletic offices. The new dining facilities can seat 480 students, and overlook the school's quarry and Louise Crespi Benners Courtyard. The kitchen also houses a laboratory for instruction from nutritional experts and professional chefs, based on guidelines from the Center for Human Nutrition at The University of Texas Southwest Medical Center.  Demographics  ESD has an enrollment of more than 1,100 students and more than 200 faculty and staff members. They have a student-faculty ratio of 7:1. The student population contains a plurality of Episcopalian (30%) and Caucasian students (82%). The school also provides tuition assistance to students through grants.http://www.esdallas.org/page.cfm?p=3069 Controversy In 2012, the school was found guilty of fraud and negligent behavior for mishandling a 2009 statutory rape.

Lang serves as the main antagonist of the film and was portrayed by American actor and professional wrestler Mr. T. Lang is a professional boxer fighting out of Chicago, Illinois and a one-time world heavyweight champion, having taken the title from Rocky Balboa only to lose it back to Balboa in his next fight. The character is very loosely based on a combination of Sonny Liston, Larry Holmes and George Foreman.Jan Philipp Reemtsma. More than a champion: the style of Muhammad Ali (Random House, 1998) .  Fictional character biography  James Lang lost both of his parents at an early age, and spent most of his childhood in orphanages and on the streets of Chicago's Southside; he eventually became involved with crime, and served time in juvenile facilities.Edward Gross. Rocky: The Ultimate Guide (Dk Pub, 2007) Later, as an adult, Clubber was sent to prison for five years for felony aggravated assault. During his time in prison, he discovered boxing as a way to let out his frustration and anger, which leads to the events of Rocky III. This is also evident in the game Rocky Legends, where Clubber's storyline begins with him fighting in the Chicago Prison in a ring actually inside the prison itself. One novelization of the film called Lang's manager \\"Donut.\\"  Rocky III  During Rocky III's intro, Rocky is shown easily defeating numerous contenders in a montage, during which Lang is shown annoyed at Rocky apparently coasting through his title defenses. Lang decides to begin training himself to challenge Rocky and his methods bring results as he puts together a string of knockouts that soon make him the number one contender. He appears at a public event to goad a now complacent Rocky who is announcing his retirement. Lang finally infuriates Rocky by propositioning his wife Adrian in front of Rocky's numerous fans and the television media, and Rocky agrees to fight him. Rocky expects another easy victory and continues his complacent attitude towards training, which angers and worries his manager and trainer Mickey Goldmill. On the night of the fight, Lang taunts the champion in the hallway as they are walking to the ring and provokes a scuffle between the two camps, shoving Mickey so hard that the latter suffers a heart attack which further distracts Rocky from the fight (and later proves fatal). He also angers former champion Apollo Creed by refusing to shake his hand before the fight and mocking him as a \\"has been\\". Creed tells Balboa, \\"Give everybody a present and drop this chump.\\" Lang overwhelms Rocky and knocks him out in two rounds. Lang's first defense of his newly-won title is a rematch against Rocky. Balboa has learned a newer boxing style based on speed and finesse from Creed. The champion has trouble with Rocky's new technique and soon tires after becoming enraged and throwing a large number of wild hooks, attempting to knock Rocky out quickly. Although several punches are damaging, Balboa taunts Lang by saying \\"knock me out, champ\\" and claiming the resulting punches were \\"nothing\\", further enraging Lang who continues to swing wildly. Rocky exploits his opponent's exhaustion and knocks him out in the third round. Lang's career results following the second fight with Balboa are unknown; outside of a replay of the final round in the beginning of Rocky IV, he was not seen in any of the four films that followed. In one version of the script of Rocky Balboa, Lang became a born- again Christian and was now addressed by his given name of James. Lang was also slated to be one of the commentators of the Balboa vs. Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon fight..

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 16, 2000. In the episode, Bart believes he has the power to heal others through faith after removing a bucket glued to Homer's head. Meanwhile, Homer creates a homecoming game float for Springfield University. The episode, which features guest appearances from Don Cheadle and Joe Mantegna, received generally positive reviews from critics following its release on home video in the season 11 DVD. Plot Homer receives a letter from Springfield University inviting him to an upcoming reunion party, where Dean Bobby Peterson reveals it is actually a fundraiser for the college's football team and forcibly takes all of the attendees' money. As revenge, Homer decides to pull a prank on Dean Peterson with his old nerd friends, Benjamin, Doug, and Gary. He tries to put a bucket filled with glue on the Dean's head, but another fraternity had already hung another bucket full of glue over the door; it falls on Homer's head, and he cannot get it off. He tries to drive with holes cut in the bucket over his eyes, but he drives the family off course -- to a religious revival, hosted by a faith healer named Brother Faith, where Bart pulls the bucket off Homer's head. Brother Faith considers this act a sign that Bart has \\"the power\\" of healing. Lisa is skeptical and attempts to use reason to explain that the hot stage lights heated the metal bucket, causing the glue to liquefy and thus loosen, while at the same time expanding the bucket and allowing Bart to pull it off. Undaunted, Bart becomes a faith healer, pulls miracles of his own, and even forms his own church which massively outdraws Reverend Lovejoy's congregation on its first day of operation. There, Bart heals Springfield's residents (when in fact, his demonstrations for the day consist of punching Grandpa in his paining artificial hip, Professor Frink where he had been suffering a cramp in his back, and slapping Patty's cigarette out of her mouth). The church is cut short, however, when Milhouse is run down, though not fatally, after he mistakes an oncoming truck for a dog; Bart had \\"healed\\" him of his myopia during his revival meeting by knocking his glasses off his face. Subsequently, Bart decides to end his career as a faith healer. Meanwhile, Homer prepares for Springfield University's homecoming football game by building a float that he has fashioned out of flowers he has stolen from Ned Flanders. At the game, everyone cheers for S.U.'s football team's star player, a kicker named Anton Lubchenko. Homer gets drunk and forgets he has made a float to celebrate SU. He crowd surfs down to the playing field, and runs to his float. Unfortunately, the other floats have left the field and the players have come back on. Homer drives his float over the leg of Lubchenko, horribly wounding him. Fat Tony, who had bet a substantial amount of money on Lubchenko's performance, threatens to kill Homer with an ice pick if Lubchenko does not return to the game. Homer convinces Bart to try to heal the kicker. Bart prays to God to help him heal the kicker. With his team down by two points, Lubchenko returns to the game and kicks the winning field goal, losing his leg in the process. Bart announces at the end of the game that he now knows that he does not have special powers and so is not a healer. Dr. Hibbert tells Bart he is happy with this: \\"Fine, more money for me.\\" Production and themes Joe Mantegna returned as Fat Tony in the episode. \\"Faith Off\\" was written by Frank Mula and directed by Nancy Kruse as part of the eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999‚Äì2000). The episode features guest appearances from Don Cheadle as Brother Faith and Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony. A major theme in \\"Faith Off\\" is the Christian practice of faith healing. In his 2008 book The Springfield Reformation: The Simpsons, Christianity, and American Culture, Jamey Heit wrote that \\"The Simpsons reiterates the vibrancy that defines black Christianity in 'Faith Off.' A faith healer, Brother Faith, inspires Bart to nurture his spirituality. Bart responds to the call and at least for the rest of the episode embraces the spiritual vibrancy that he learns from a black Christian leader.\\" Release and reviews The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 16, 2000. On September 4, 2000 the episode was included on the VHS compilation set The Simpsons: On Your Marks, Get Set, D'oh!. On October 7, 2008, it was released on DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Eleventh Season. Staff members Mike Scully, George Meyer, Matt Selman, and Nancy Kruse participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set. A song Bart sings in the episode, called \\"Testify\\", was released on the soundtrack album The Simpsons: Testify in 2007. Reception from critics has been generally positive. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on \\"Faith Off\\", noting: \\"If nothing else, I like this one for the sight of Homer with the bucket stuck on his head; something about seeing him with those little eyeholes entertains me. Otherwise there‚Äôs not much powerful at work here. The healing plot is a decent one, and Don Cheadle gives us a good guest performance. The program is fine but not much more than that.\\" Nancy Basile of About.com, on the other hand, listed the episode as one of the episodes she felt \\"shined in season eleven\\". Alison Kerr of The Herald called the episode \\"brilliant\\". In his review of the eleventh season, Den of Geek critic Mark Oakley wrote that \\"there are some fine episodes to be found\\", such as \\"Faith Off\\", which he described as a \\"highlight\\". He added that the \\"song Testify harks back to the brilliance of the show‚Äôs great musical numbers like The Stonecutters Song.\\" In 2003, the Orlando Sentinels Gregory Hardy named \\"Faith Off\\" the fifth best episode of the show with a sports theme. Jerry Greene, another Orlando Sentinel columnist, listed the episode at number seven on his 2004 list of the show's \\"Top 10 Sporting Episodes\\". He particularly liked the inscription on Springfield University's gateway that says: \\"If you can read this, you're accepted.\\" References External links  *\\"Faith Off\\" at The Simpsons.com * * Category:The Simpsons (season 11) episodes Category:2000 American television episodes ","title":"Faith Off"},{"id":"1888381","text":"Count Antoni Jan Ostrowski (1782-1845) was a Polish noble (szlachcic), landowner, political and economic activist, general and publicist.

It has recently been published as The Game. Plot introduction The book is a hard science fiction dystopian novel set in 2154, a time when machines and robots perform most jobs and children go to government schools. Because of this, very few people are employed, with many people living on a social welfare system for support. The unemployed people have nothing to look forward to, except various illicit drugs. Some have formed gangs, some are shown to be agitating for political reform (in chapter 5, there is a reference to leaflets being printed up), and many are involved in organized crime of some form or another. The government, possibly the only government in existence at this point, is shown to have complete control over its citizens by restricting the unemployed to designated areas (DAs), and having similar control over the working class. The working-class people are taught to hate the unemployed citizens, while the unemployed generally want money and employment, in a classic class struggle. The story is told from the perspective of Lisse, a recent graduate of school. Plot summary Lisse and her nine friends are unemployed after graduating from a respected private school, and are assigned to live as a group in an abandoned warehouse in a Designated Area (DA). They discover that by day, the area they live in is a dreary, dirty, and unsafe place. By night, however, the unemployed residents party. Lisse and her friends spend care-free evenings after they realize that they are a team and that this is their life now. The thought police quickly step in to quell any large problems or disputes. For their own safety, they study karate and other self-preservation skills. In the night, Lisse and her friends hear of a mysterious 'game', called \\"The Game\\" with capital letters. It is known that participants can only be selected, and that anyone who requests to join will always be declined. In the unsafe night, they encounter a suspicious man named Charlie, who offers Lisse's friend and housemate Alden a partnership. Charlie wants to use Alden's skills in chemistry; this incident and encounters with other young, homeless people suggest the use of drugs in their DA. Alden declines and is beaten up by a gang of Charlie's thugs. Lisse and her friends learn that they need to protect themselves. Another housemate, Brad, scrounges for materials to turn their warehouse into a protected \\"castle\\". One day, the group gets invited to \\"The Game\\", which turns out to be a virtual-reality, full-world simulation. They are given electronic passes and have to travel by train to where The Game is taking place. During the journey, they are treated disdainfully by the employed workers they encounter. Once at The Game's location, they lay on couches and enter the simulated world of The Game. This simulation is based in an outdoor environment and the aim seems to be survival in this different climate. Having little else to look forward to in their lives, the group focuses on training and information gathering during their time between Game sessions. They develop a schedule of regular exercise (consisting of jogging and weight-training), search for information in the local library, and discuss their experiences and motivations. As they progress in The Game, they find that they have needs (for a doctor and someone with agricultural knowledge). People they knew from school re-enter their lives, filling those needs, although they initially believe this to be a coincidence. During their sessions in The Game, they are always brought back to reality if they experience danger, such as eating poisoned berries. In the real world, they record everything that happens in The Game, mapping the areas they find and keeping track of the flora and fauna they encounter. They also speculate what they would win if they won The Game, thinking about prizes of credits to buy anything they like, including travel. After a year of such training, The Game session changes; they have a different initial experience. And although they are placed in the same world, it feels different. They discover that they are not awakened if they are in danger of hurting themselves. At first, they think that this means they have progressed to a new, higher level of The Game ‚Äì but start to realize that they are never going to \\"wake up\\" and that they are in their new home forever. Next, they believe that they have been sent to another country ‚Äì but they recognize that this cannot be true when they realize they have never seen the moon, which is visible from everywhere on Earth. They stay up at night to look at the stars, whose position in the sky makes them realize that they are in a totally different part of the galaxy. This planet is very different from Earth ‚Äì colorful, fresh, underwhelming, quiet, healthy, and more. This is a new opportunity to create a world with problems: health problems, political problems, pollution, etc. They come to realize that The Game was a kind of training program meant to prepare their group, and others like them, for an off-world colony project ‚Äì a project designed to halt the massive overpopulation their world is suffering. The different start of this phase of The Game, which they thought was a new level, was in fact their transportation to the new world, where they have been left forever. Lisse starts to remember them landing in an egg-like structure. They retrace their steps and rediscover the landing site ‚Äì this confirms that they have been transported, and that their memories had been tampered with. Eventually, they christen the new world \\"Prize\\" ‚Äì ironically at first ‚Äì as their new life there is what they have won in The Game. It is hinted that part of the reason such a group of people were unemployable out of school was to help in the colonization of other worlds, since each seed group would need a variety of talents. Indeed, an early portion of the book reinforces this supposition, as it explains that the prestigious school from which Lisse and her friends graduated once had a 90% job-placement rate, which is now a mere 10% ‚Äì possibly suggesting that the most qualified workers are being placed within the Game system rather than the workforce. Lisse and her group encounter and integrate with another group; they all eventually pair off into relationships. Lisse explains that her original group could not intermarry as they are too close and feel like family. The book ends with Lisse making paper to write a story to the unborn baby she is revealed to be carrying, which she thinks will be a girl ‚Äì the first child born on Prize. The first sentence she writes is the first of the book; by this literary device, it is revealed that the book itself is Lisse's recounting of these events of her life.

Life Konrad was a son of Count Lothar of Hochstadt, canon of St. Maria ad Gradus and of the old Cologne Cathedral, and Mathilde of Vianden. His date of birth is unknown, and nothing is known of his early youth. In 1216 he became incumbent of the parish of Wevelinghoven near D√ºsseldorf; in 1226 he was canon and, some years later, provost of the cathedral of Cologne. After the death of Heinrich von M√ºllenark (26 March 1238) the cathedral chapter elected Konrad Archbishop of Cologne. He received the archiepiscopal insignia from the Emperor Frederick II at Brescia in August of the same year. The following year, on 28 October, he was ordained priest and consecrated archbishop by Ludolf von Holte, Bishop of M√ºnster. A Man of Influence For the first few months of his reign, the new archbishop sided with the emperor in his conflict with Pope Gregory IX, but for unknown reasons went over to the papal party shortly after the emperor's excommunication (12 March 1239). The whole temporal administration of Konrad was a series of struggles with neighbouring princes and the citizens of Cologne, who refused to acknowledge the temporal sovereignty of the archbishop over their city. Konrad was generally victorious, but his often treacherous manner of warfare has left many dark spots on his reputation. When Pope Innocent IV deposed Frederick II (17 July 1245), it was chiefly due to the influence of Konrad that the pope's candidate, Henry Raspe, Landgrave of Thuringia, was elected king; when Henry died after a short reign of seven months (17 February 1247), it was again the influence of Konrad that placed the crown on the head of the youthful William of Holland. Konrad von Hochstaden at the tower of Cologne City Hall standing atop an autofellatio-performing grotesque. In recognition of these services, Pope Innocent made him Apostolic legate in Germany (14 March 1249), an office which had become vacant by the death of Archbishop Siegfried III of Mainz, five days previously. The clergy and laity of Mainz desired to have the powerful Konrad of Cologne as their new archbishop. Konrad seems to have secretly encouraged them, but for diplomatic reasons referred them to the pope, who kindly but firmly refused to place the two most important ecclesiastical provinces of Germany under the power of one man. Shortly after this decision the hitherto friendly relations between Pope Innocent IV and the archbishop ceased, and in April 1250, the Apostolic legation in Germany was committed to Pierre de Colmieu, Bishop of Albano. At the same time began Konrad's estrangement from King William, which finally led to open rebellion. With all the means of a powerful and unscrupulous prince, Konrad attempted to dethrone William and probably would have succeeded had not the king's premature death made the archbishop's intrigues unnecessary. After the death of King William (28 January 1256), Konrad played an important role in the election of the new king. He sold his vote for a large sum to Richard of Cornwall, brother of Henry III of England, and crowned him at Aachen on 17 May 1257. This was the last important act of Konrad. He died on 28 September 1261 and is buried in the cathedral of Cologne, of which he laid the cornerstone on 15 August 1248.

WIOT's call letters came about from doodle using the frequency numbers 1-0-4-7 and in the Spring of 1972 newly appointed operations manager Chuck Schmidt was trying to derive the calls from the frequency number dials 1=I 0=O and 7=T. W-I-O-T. \\"W\\" because the station is East of the Mississippi. The origins of the calls and what they mean are hotly contested but it took longtime WIOT engineer Dennis P Moon confirms this. Dennis was present when Chuck created the calls in 1972 as a derived on the word \\"Riot\\" but with a \\"W\\" instead, to this day Dennis is still the chief engineer as of 2020 the call letters were in the past WTOL-FM and WCWA-FM. Buck and O'Connor hosted mornings in the early 1980's the morning show was consisted of 2 WIOT morning DJ's Bucky \\"Buck\\" McWilliams and Christopher O'Connor, they left WIOT to Milwaukee at WZUU now WRIT and then Minneapolis at the legendary KDWB. Other WIOT DJ's during that time in the '80's were Terry Sullivan one half of the Sullivan and O'Connor show, Lee Randall, Joanie Major, Lawrence \\"Larry Wyatt\\" Weseman, with Donald \\"Don\\" Jardine, and of course WIOT's 1st ever male and female morning duos of all themselves, Patrick Still and Janet Perry A.K.A. Pat and Jane. In the late 1980's Bob and Brian became the next Toledo favorite morning duo, they also too left for Milwaukee where they remain to this day currently at WHQG. The next morning duo that created an impact was The WIOT's Dawnbusters A.K.A. Jeffrey Lamb and Mark Benson. Jeff provided all of the voices and skits while Mark kept the shows pace, somehow the WIOT's Dawnbusters was a major success. Other WIOT DJs during this time in the '90's were Program Director Lyn Casey, Michael \\"Party!\\" Young, Don Davis, Dave Duran, Rebecca \\"Becky\\" Shock, Dennis O'Brian, with Beth Daniels, and the one and only Will Worster. In 1994 The station introduces the 2nd WIOT's Dawnbusters Karlson and McKenzie, these two brought a new life in morning radio for Toledo and Karlson and McKenzie drew large morning numbers. But after about 2 years at WIOT Karlson and McKenzie left for Boston at WZLX, and the new owners Enterprise Media rehired the 1st WIOT's Dawnbusters themselves Jeff and Mark. In 1998 the station was bought by Jacor Media where they tweaked the format a bit more hard rock and they inked a deal with syndicated morning show The Bob and Tom Show where it airs to this day. Around this time new WIOT DJ's were introduced to the listeners, like Susan Gates, Troy Michaels, and Grizzly Brown, while Darrin Arrens became the PD, and then one year later both Darrin and Susan left in 1999. Longtime WIOT DJ Don Davis left the station in 2001 and he was replaced by Dave Rossi as PD from WAVE-FM in South Carolina. WIOT began to return to its major stranglehold on the Toledo rock ratings. Dave Rossi left in 2003 to head back to South Carolina, Troy Michaels took over the afternoon shift and Grizzly Brown moved up to the evening shift. WIOT's broadcast studio is at the iHeartRadio building at South Superior. The station's transmitter is located at North Wynn and Cedar Point Roads in Oregon, Ohio. In September 2019 WIOT's transmitter site was named the Dennis P Moon Transmitter Site, in honor of engineer Denny Moon's 50 years at the station. Prior to its home on South Superior, the station was located on the third floor of Fort Industry Square. WIOT's beginnings were at 604 Jackson Street, the site of the former News-Bee building and what is now One Government Center. Their longtime owner was Reams Broadcasting, begun by Fraser Reams Sr. and later by his son, Fraser Junior. Reams also owned WCWA and WTOL-TV and WCWA-FM's transmitter was on WTOL-TV's tower. WIOT is licensed for HD Radio operations. Its HD2 programming consists of a simulcast of WCWA- AM's Fox Sports Radio format.http://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=84 HD Radio Guide for Toledo Broadcast area The station serves Toledo and northwest Ohio, but its signal also reaches downtown Detroit, the southern and western suburbs (the latter due to the hills) as well as most of Essex County, Ontario, including Windsor, Ontario and Leamington, Ontario. Under exceptionally good conditions (such as fog), the station's signal can reach Chatham, Ontario. The signal reaches as far south as Marion, Ohio and Bucyrus, Ohio and into Michigan as far north as Flint, Michigan, Lapeer, and Port Huron, Michigan before it starts to interfere with Woodstock, Ontario's CIHR-FM, which is also on 104.7 FM. The station also experiences regular interference from Geneva, Ohio's WKKY, which is also on 104.7, near the Wheatley, Ontario and Comber, Ontario areas (mostly in the southeastern corner of Essex County). During 2011, WIOT was also experiencing interference from Detroit repeater W284BQ, which was simulcasting WGPR's The Oasis smooth jazz subchannel on 104.7 MHz. In May 2011, WIOT filed a complaint with the FCC,FCC document of WIOT's complaint, May 19, 2011. saying that W284BQ interferes with WIOT in the Michigan portion of their broadcast area. WIOT had also solicited comments and reception reports from listeners in the affected area.WIOT website: \\"Signal Interference\\" Martz Communications Group, which owns the repeater and programs The Oasis, would soon after establish a website, http://www.savetheoasis.com/, which explains the station's position on the issue, stressing that WIOT should not get special treatment on the grounds that it is an Ohio radio station that serves no part of Detroit, though the statement is not exactly true. WIOT's protected contour does serve parts of the Detroit area, in part due to its grandfathered status. On October 18, 2011, the FCC sided with Clear Channel on the issue, and ordered W284BQ to cease operation immediately. Martz would later apply with the FCC to relocate W284BQ to 93.9, potentially interfering with Windsor, Ontario station CIDR-FM, then later to 93.5,FCC licensing data for W284BQ before giving up on the concept altogether.http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/55478/detroits-bone-oasis- go-dark/#.TyiGlZiqC70 ReferencesExternal links *104.7 WIOT * Category:1949 establishments in Ohio Category:Active rock radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1949 IOT Category:IHeartMedia radio stations ","title":"WIOT"},{"id":"1888406","text":"Originally named \\"UPI Audio,\\" the United Press International Radio Network was a news service for radio and television stations from wire service United Press International. It was the first such service offered by a major news agency and existed from 1958 to 1999. A late 1950s offshoot of UPI's television footage service, \\"UPI Movietone,\\" later known as United Press International Television News or UPITN, \\"UPI Audio,\\" began selling the sounds of newsmakers stripped from newsfilm, plus the voices of UPI reporters and stringers to client radio stations. It was originally done on a piecemeal basis, with UPI's wire for broadcasters, known as the National Radio Wire, carrying lists of available material. Over time, that list came to be called a billboard, and it moved several times a day. As the operation grew, it was expanded from dial-up telephone to feeds by leased line, the audio material, now branded as Audio Roundup was fed at specific times, usually at ten minutes past the hour. In early 1966, UPI acquired the assets and key personnel of a similarly named (but previously unrelated) competing service, Radio Press International. Out of that merger came an audio service that at its peak served more than a thousand U.S. radio stations and many foreign clients, including other networks such as NPR, RKO, Britain's Independent Radio News and even CNN in its early years when CNN, then headed by former UPI and UPTN executives Reese Schonfeld and Burt Reinhardt, effectively reunited UPI audio with UPITN video. In the early 1970s, UPI Audio began offering a newscast at the top of the hour. Soon thereafter, it added live sportscasts and business reports. Among UPI Audio's sportscasters of the late 1970s were Keith Olbermann and Sam Rosen. Unlike most commercial radio networks, which usually paid local stations to air their programming (and commercials), UPI charged stations cash for its broadcast services, allowing them to sell their own advertising within or adjacent to UPI broadcasts. It is the model that then- rival wire service Associated Press also used when it followed UPI into the radio network field in the mid-1970s. The service name was changed from UPI Audio to UPI Radio Network in 1983 to reflect the greater focus on live programming. After a long period of changing ownerships, business models and bankruptcies, UPI declined into a shell of a news service by 1999, when its then-Saudi Arabian ownership was convinced by its handpicked CEO, Arnaud de Borchgrave, to exit the broadcasting business United Press had pioneered back in the 1930s. The rump UPI sold its client list of its radio network and broadcast wire to its former rival, the AP.

The film also features Joyce Grenfell, Keenan Wynn, and William Windom. The screenplay by Chayefsky is loosely adapted from the 1959 novel of the same name by William Bradford Huie, who had been a SeaBee officer during the Normandy Invasion. The film is set in 1944 London during World War II in the weeks leading up to D-Day.Life Magazine, 9 October 1944, article by Huie: SeaBees ‚Äì They Build the Roads to Victory Linked 2013-08-09 Controversial in its own time, it has since been praised as a \\"vanguard anti-war film\\". Both GarnerJames Garner of Charlie Rose, ~6' from beginning and AndrewsBlank, Ed. Andrews as Maria a result of 'happy circumstances' . Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. 17 November 2005. have considered the film their personal favorite of those in which they acted. Plot Lieutenant Commander Charlie Madison (James Garner), United States Naval Reserve, is a cynical and highly efficient adjutant to Rear Admiral William Jessup (Melvyn Douglas) in London in 1944. Charlie's job as a dog robber is to keep his boss and other high-ranking officers supplied with luxury goods and amiable Englishwomen. He falls in love with a driver from the motor pool, Emily Barham (Julie Andrews), who has lost her husband, brother, and father in the war. Charlie's pleasure-seeking \\"American\\" lifestyle amid wartime rationing both fascinates and disgusts Emily, but she does not want to lose another loved one to war and finds the \\"practising coward\\" Charlie irresistible. Profoundly despondent since the death of his wife, Jessup obsesses over the US Army and its Air Force overshadowing the Navy in the forthcoming D-Day invasion. The mentally unstable admiral decides that \\"The first dead man on Omaha Beach must be a sailor\\". A combat film will document the death, and the casualty will be buried in a \\"Tomb of the Unknown Sailor\\". He orders Charlie to get the film made. Despite his best efforts to avoid the duty, Charlie and his now gung-ho friend, Commander \\"Bus\\" Cummings (James Coburn), find themselves and a film crew with the combat engineers, who will be the first sailors ashore. When Charlie tries to retreat from the beach, the manic Cummings shoots him in the leg with a Colt .45 pistol. A German artillery shell lands near the limping-running Charlie, making him the first American casualty on Omaha Beach. Hundreds of newspaper and magazine covers reprint the photograph of Charlie running ashore, alone (in reality trying to escape from Cummings), making him a war hero. Jessup, having recovered from his breakdown, is horrified by his part in Charlie's death. He plans to use the heroic death in support of the Navy when testifying before a Senate committee in Washington, D.C. Losing another man she loves to the war devastates Emily. Then comes unexpected news: Charlie is not dead, but alive at the Allied 6th relocation center in Southampton, England. A relieved Jessup plans to show him off during his Senate testimony as the \\"first man on Omaha Beach\\", a sailor. Charlie, limping from his injury and angry about his senseless near-death, uncharacteristically plans to act nobly by telling the world the truth about what happened, even if it means being imprisoned for cowardice. By recounting what he had told her previously, Emily persuades Charlie to choose happiness with her, instead, and to keep quiet and accept his role as a hero. Main cast *James Garner as Lt. Cmdr.

It was later recorded by Andy Williams for Dear Heart (1965) and by Barbra Streisand for The Movie Album (2003). Comparison with the novel Cover of the novel The Americanization of Emily is based on William Bradford Huie's 1959 novel of the same name. \\"'Has Pat been Americanized?' ...

The New York Times ran a brief news item mentioning Huie's novel prior to its publication,\\"Books--Authors\\", The New York Times, July 14, 1959, p. 27: \\"'The Americanization of Emily, William Bradford Huie's new novel, will be published Aug. 12 by Dutton....

H. \\"Movie Panorama from a Local Vantage Point, The New York Times, April 7, 1963, p. X15 A first draft of the screenplay for the film was written by George Goodman who previously had a success at MGM with his The Wheeler Dealers (1963), also with James Garner in the male lead and the same director and producer. In 1964 a Broadway musical with music written by John Barry was announced.Plays and Players, volume 16, page 10 Linked 2013-08-09 Chayefsky's adaptation, while retaining the title, characters, situation, background and many specific plot incidents, nevertheless told a very different story. \\"I found the book, which is serious in tone, essentially a funny satire, and that's how I'm treating it\\". The screenplay's theme of cowardice as a virtue has no parallel in the novel; in fact, the novel does not mention cowardice at all. The screenplay implies, but never explicitly explains, what is meant by the term \\"Americanization\\". The novel uses \\"Americanized\\" to refer to a woman who accepts, as a normal condition of wartime, the exchange of her sexual favors for gifts of rare wartime commodities. Thus, in reply to the question \\"has Pat been Americanized\\", a character answers: This theme runs throughout the novel. Another character says, \\"We operate just like a whorehouse ... except we don't sell it for cash. We swap it for Camels and nylons and steak and eggs and lipstick ... this dress ... came from Saks Fifth Avenue in the diplomatic pouch\\". Emily asks Jimmy, \\"Am I behaving like a whore\\"? Jimmy replies, \\"Whoring is a peacetime activity\\". The screenplay uses Hershey bars to symbolize the luxuries enjoyed by Americans and their \\"Americanized\\" companions; the novel uses strawberries rather than chocolate bars, in a parallel way. In his first dinner with Emily, he orders the waiter to bring strawberries. \\"She protested that they were too forbidden, too expensive\\". Jimmy convinces her to accept them by arguing, \\"If you don't eat them, they'll be eaten by one of these expense-account correspondents\\". Later, she asks Jimmy, \\"If I fall in love with you, how can I know whether I love you for yourself or for the strawberries?\\" The novel briefly mentions that Emily's mother, Mrs. Barham, has been mentally affected by wartime stress, but she is not a major character. There is no mention of her self-deception or pretense that her husband and son are still alive. The film contains a long scene between Charlie and Mrs. Barham, full of eloquent antiwar rhetoric, in which Charlie breaks down Mrs. Barham's denial and reduces her to tears while nevertheless insisting that he has performed an act of kindness. The novel has no parallel to this scene. In the film, Charlie is comically unprepared to make the documentary film demanded by Admiral Jessup and is assisted only by a bumbling and drunken serviceman played by Keenan Wynn. In the novel Charlie has been a PR professional in civilian life, takes the assignment seriously, and leads a team of competent cinematographers. Reception=Critical The Americanization of Emily has a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 13 reviews, with an average score of 7.39/10. Bosley Crowther praised Chayefsky's screenplay as including \\"some remarkably good writing with some slashing irreverence\\". In Slant magazine, Nick Schager retrospectively wrote, \\"Though a bit overstuffed with long-winded speeches, Chayefsky's scabrously funny script brims with snappy, crackling dialogue.\\" In A Journey Through American Literature, academic Kevin J. Hayes praised Chayefsky's speeches for Garner as \\"stirring\\". Accolades The film was nominated for two Academy Awards in 1965, for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography, and in 1966 Julie Andrews' portrayal of Emily earned her a nomination for a BAFTA Award for Best British Actress.IMDb: Awards for The Americanization of Emily Linked 2013-08-09 The Americanization of Emily was among the films selected for The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made.

Though licensed to Bowling Green, its primary market and its studios are in the nearby city of Toledo. The station broadcasts at 93.5 on the FM dial, and plays classic hits music. Its transmitter is located near Haskins, Ohio. Overview Before becoming WRQN on July 11, 1983, the station was WAWR, founded by Port Clinton, Ohio resident Robert W. Reider. The station first went on the air on Wednesday, June 3, 1964. Reider eventually started and operated WAWR, WRWR in Port Clinton, WLKR in Norwalk, and WKTN in Kenton, all via his \\"Ohio Radio Incorporated\\" banner. WAWR programmed easy listening music during the day and rock in the evenings changing to contemporary rock and underground rock in the evenings with Bob Ladd, geared toward the college students at local BGSU. Earl Sharninghouse (aka Rick Allen) had the oldies weekend show playing 1950s and 1960s oldies in the evenings in the mid 1960s. Steve Wright held the morning slot with Terry Waltz anchoring the news and news director. Jim (Marick) Obrien worked part-time in production and occasional on air talent. General Manager Jerry (Tschappit) McCullen conducted local talks shows at local restaurants. Eventually, the call sign was changed to WKIQ. When it became WRQN the station began as a Rock/Top 40 A.K.A. Rock 40 station as \\"Toledo's New Hit Rock, The All New 93 And A 1/2 FM WRQN\\", playing mix of artists like Robert Plant, The Motels, The Police, Donna Summer, Quarterflash, Air Supply, Culture Club and Billy Squier. The station later adopted a CHR format, calling itself \\"Hit Rock, Hit Radio, 93Q\\". Despite its weak signal and poor audio quality, the station became very successful and competed with then 92.5 WMHE. The daily on-air lineup included Mason, Diane and The Q Morning Zoo, Brad Hanson, Joseph \\"Indiana Jones\\" Thomas, Ted Kelly and Scott Greggory. Eventually former intern turned local personality favorite Johny D was heard in the evenings, hosting a show called \\"Dial D\\" in which most of the time was spent taking phone calls from listeners and rapping about anything the listeners wanted to talk about. Around 1990 the station boosted their transmitting power to 6,000 watts and improved their sound quality by switching to compact discs from the \\"cart machine\\". It also aired syndicated programs like \\"Future Hits\\", \\"Casey's Top 40\\", and \\"Saturday Night Hot Mix\\". The station also had its own program that aired on Sunday nights called \\"93Q's On The Edge\\" that played alternative rock that had not yet reached mainstream. But despite consistently beating 92.5 in the ratings, the station did not bill very well. On October 17, 1991, instead of hearing The Q Morning Zoo, WRQN was playing \\"Louie Louie\\" by The Kingsmen over and over, similar to the way WHNN in Saginaw, Michigan did before it changed to an oldies format on Labor Day of 1990, referring to itself as \\"Louie 93.5, All Louie, All the Time!\\". The station also played a marching band rendition of the song during this stunting. On the following Monday, Mason and Diane returned to talk about the new format change to oldies. There was an enormous backlash from the listeners, many of them signing petitions demanding the return of 93Q. Mason talked about this but said that they were \\"fighting for a lost cause\\", and that the station was not changing back. Mason and Diane remained at the station for a little while longer and then left. For majority of the 1990s the station was known as \\"WRQN Oldies 93.5\\", focusing on mostly music from the 1950s and 1960s. By the 2000s WRQN began adding more 1970s classic hits and Motown, then WRQN removed most 1950s doo wop hits from their playlist. The year 2006 saw even more improvements at WRQN-FM, as transmitter power was increased to 7,000 watts, a new tower was built, and the station was the first in the Toledo market to broadcast with IBOC / HD-Radio. Toledo radio legend Bob Kelly was inducted into the Ohio Radio Hall of Fame in October 2006. The current lineup at WRQN features long-time Toledo radio favorites Jim Brady, Ron Finn, Buddy Carr, as well as Bob Kelly with his new partner Becky Shock (replacing Bob's sidekick of 19 years, Dennis Staples). On Friday, June 10, 2011, longtime radio host Bob Kelly retired, as did the morning show \\"Bob and Becky\\". The following Monday, June 13, 2011, a new morning show was introduced, \\"Ron and Lyn\\", formerly the morning show on WWWM-FM. Ron Finn previously hosted the 10a-2p shift on WRQN which former morning show personality, Becky Shock hosted for sometime. Finn's counterpart in the morning, Lyn Casye still aired on Star 105.5's new morning show, \\"Tim and Jeff\\" offering news, weather, and traffic updates. Then on Monday, June 13, 2011, WRQN slightly updated their programming. WRQN now advertises themselves as \\"Feel Good Favorites\\" and removed most 1960s hits from their playlist and added 1980s pop music hits to the playlist, including hits from George Michael, Prince, Soft Cell, Michael Jackson, Heart (band), Level 42, Mr. Mister and many others. Previously, WRQN offered \\"Rock & Roll Hits\\" mainly from the 1960s and 1970s.

Soy milk makers work similarly to a combination between a home blender and an automatic coffee maker. Some soy milk makers can also be programmed to make almond milk, rice milk, and other vegetable-based steeped beverages. Homemade soy milk can be made to the drinkers' tastes and nutritional requirements, providing added value. Soy pulp, a by-product of soy milk preparation, can be used as an ingredient in many recipes and food products. Ordinary methods for making soy milk at home are often very labor- intensive (requiring beans to be soaked, ground in a blender, strained, and then cooked). Soy milk machines perform many of these steps automatically, greatly simplifying home-based soy milk production.  Standard operation  Before use, dried beans are rinsed with water to remove particulate debris, soaked for 6‚Äì10 hours to moisten and soften the dried beans, and then rinsed again before use. The moistened soy beans are placed into the grinding chamber, where they are ground into a fine paste, and fall into a finely screened strainer chamber immersed in a pot of water. The paste is steeped in the water in a process similar to that of tea making; the pot of water is heated, fully cooking both the dissolved soy milk and the strained soy solids, which become soy pulp. The new models on the market now have no filter cup ‚Äî soy beans are placed directly inside the machine jug. Most soy milk makers include a mechanism to stop the boiling soy milk from overflowing. The heater is turned off as the water level approaches the top of the chamber, and then turned back on as the soy milk returns to an acceptable level.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 23, 2000, and was watched in around 11.3 million homes during the broadcast. In the episode, Mr. Burns goes to the Mayo Clinic for a check-up after being declared the oldest man in Springfield at an awards ceremony. He leaves the Simpson family to house-sit his mansion for him. When Homer throws a party on Burns' private yacht in international waters, the party goers are captured by Chinese pirates. American pop singer Britney Spears guest starred in \\"The Mansion Family\\" as herself. She appears as the host of the awards ceremony. The episode, which was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Michael Polcino, features several cultural references. Many parts of the story were inspired by real-life events experienced by some of the staff members of the series. Since airing, the episode has received generally mixed reviews from critics. It was released on the DVD collection The Simpsons Gone Wild in 2004, and The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Eleventh Season in 2008. Plot At the annual Springfield Pride Awards hosted by Kent Brockman and Britney Spears, awards are given to prominent Springfield citizens for their achievements. They present the award for the oldest man in Springfield to Cornelius Chapman, who is 108 years old. Chapman comes up to accept his award, but when Spears gives him a congratulatory kiss on the cheek, he dies of a heart attack. The award is therefore given to the now oldest Springfieldian in the crowd, Mr. Burns. After Burns wins, he realizes he is not a young man anymore, so he and his assistant Smithers go to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota for a check-up. Burns decides to give the Simpson family an opportunity to house sit his private mansion while he is being tested for various diseases. After enjoying life as a billionaire for a few days, Homer decides to throw a party before Burns returns. He heads to Moe's Tavern to buy some beer and invite his friends to the party. However, Moe informs Homer that he can not sell him alcohol on account of it being Sunday before 2:00 PM. After Homer is told the only way he could buy alcohol would be to sail out to international waters where there are no laws, he and his friends (including his son Bart) set sail in Burns' private yacht to throw the party there. Back at the Mayo Clinic, Burns discovers that he not only has all previously discovered diseases, but numerous new diseases the doctors have just discovered in him. However, the sheer number of diseases prevents any one disease from actually doing harm to him. This leads Burns to (incorrectly) conclude that he is indestructible, even though the doctors protest that even a slight breeze could disrupt the balance in his body. Meanwhile, the party continues and the party goers force Burns' monkeys into having a knife fight. The yacht is eventually boarded by Chinese pirates who take the ship hostage. The pirates rob everyone on board and tie them up in a net which they then toss overboard. But to the luck of Homer and some of the other guests who happen to be above ocean surface level, it floats and they avoid drowning while the others who were beneath the net drowned. Eventually Homer and Bart make it back to the mansion where the family returns the house to Burns after Marge and Lisa have scrubbed all the rooms clean. Back at the Simpsons home, everyone is glad to live a normal life again‚Äîwith the exception of Homer, who is upset that he does not live the lifestyle of rich people. The episode ends with Homer wailing about how rich all the persons in the closing credits are (except Richard K. Chung, whom he dismisses as poor) and threatening to report them to the Internal Revenue Service and telling the Gracie Films woman not to shush him. Production Singer Britney Spears appears in the episode. \\"The Mansion Family\\" was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Michael Polcino as part of the eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999‚Äì2000).Polcino, Michael. (2008). Commentary for \\"The Mansion Family\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. It was the first of many episodes of the series that Polcino directed. Executive producer Mike Scully was the one who received the idea for the first part of the story. He explained on a DVD audio commentary for the episode that his grandmother was the oldest citizen of his hometown West Springfield, Massachusetts, and \\"they had a ceremony where she was awarded a cane that had a golden head on it. And the weird thing of the ceremony is her name wasn't on the cane, and the mayor of the town stood up and he says: 'And now, of course as soon as Hazel passes away, her name will be engraved on the cane.' So she would never live to see it happen. But nonetheless, she was given the cane.\\" The subplot of \\"The Mansion Family\\", where Mr. Burns gets a medical examination, was inspired by Swartzwelder's own visit to a Mayo Clinic.Meyer, George. (2008). Commentary for \\"The Mansion Family\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. George Meyer, an executive producer on the series, has said that \\"John, I don't think he is a guy who goes to the doctor very often. And every 20 or 30 years, he decides he needs to get a tune up. So he went to the Mayo Clinic, had they give him an entire battery of tests. And as John [jokingly] tells it, they said that his constant smoking had done no harm to him whatsoever. Might even be benefiting him.\\" While writing the parts of the episode that involve international waters, the writers did research and found that the actual laws of international waters are more complex and ambiguous compared to what they had already written in the story, but they decided to ignore that.Long, Tim. (2008). Commentary for \\"The Mansion Family\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. American pop singer Britney Spears guest starred in the episode as herself. According to Scully, she was seventeen to eighteen years old when she recorded her lines, and \\"She was a lot of fun to work with. She was a fan of the show, and she was willing to do all the lines. It was all the people around her that were crazy, the management and all that. We originally had her introduce herself [in the episode] as 'I'm teenage songbird Britney Spears.' And she recorded a few takes and they were fine. And suddenly, all these guys come rushing in [saying] 'She can't say songbird.' [We asked] what's wrong with songbird? And they were somehow convinced that it was some sort of slam or an insult.\\"Scully, Mike. (2008). Commentary for \\"The Mansion Family\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The staff members were therefore forced to change her opening line to \\"I'm teen sensation Britney Spears.\\" Many scenes in \\"The Mansion Family\\" were inspired by popular culture. For example, there is a painting hanging on one of the walls in Burns' mansion that depicts Burns playing poker with dogs, referencing the oil paintings series Dogs Playing Poker. Another painting, showing a nude Burns, is a callback to a previous episode of the series, \\"Brush with Greatness\\" (1991), in which Marge produced the painting for Burns. Featured in the episode is also a joke that makes fun of the Grammy Awards. During the awards ceremony, Homer complains, \\"Why won't anyone give me an award?\\" When Lisa points out that \\"You won a Grammy,\\" Homer says \\"I mean an award that's worth winning.\\" At this point the screen freezes and a message scrolls across the bottom of the screen reading \\"LEGAL DISCLAIMER: Mr. Simpson's opinions do not reflect those of the producers, who don't consider the Grammy an award at all.\\" Release and reviews The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 23, 2000. It was viewed in approximately 11.3 million households that night. With a Nielsen rating of 11.2, the episode tied Becker (CBS) for the 14th place (compared the season average of 37) in the ratings for the week of January 17‚Äì23, 2000. The episode was the third highest-rated broadcast on Fox that week, following a NFC Championship post-game show and Malcolm in the Middle. On September 14, 2004, the episode was released in the United States on a DVD collection titled The Simpsons Gone Wild, along with the season one episode \\"Homer's Night Out\\", the season ten episode \\"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\\", and the season thirteen episode \\"Homer the Moe\\". On October 7, 2008, \\"The Mansion Family\\" was released on DVD again as part of the box set The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Eleventh Season. Staff members Mike Scully, George Meyer, Ron Hauge, Matt Selman, Tim Long, Michael Polcino, Donick Cary, and Pete Michels participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set. \\"The Mansion Family\\" has received generally mixed reception from critics. Susan Dunne of The Hartford Courant described it as \\"debauched but hilarious.\\" While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on \\"The Mansion Family\\", writing that \\"Although The Simpsons started out as moderately reality based, pretty much any grounding was gone by [the point this episode aired]. That doesn‚Äôt mean the show fails to depict funny bits, especially during the dark humor of Burns‚Äô hospital visit. Nonetheless, [the episode] occasionally goes too far to the side of silliness; those gags are hit or miss.\\" In a review of the episodes featured on The Simpsons Gone Wild, PopMatters critic Stephen Haag wrote that \\"none of these episodes will end up in the Simpsons Hall of Fame\\", and that \\"The Mansion Family\\" is \\"hardly a classic episode, but Lord knows there are plenty worse from season 11.\\" He further commented that \\"if anything, this episode should be included in the 'batshit-crazy endings' DVD,\\" referring to the ending scenes with the Chinese pirates. David Packard of DVD Verdict was more positive in his review of The Simpsons Gone Wild, writing that \\"The Mansion Family\\" is \\"another all-around hilarious episode, with a nice swipe at the Grammy Awards, the Simpsons family running amok in the mansion and enjoying all it has to offer, and Burns' various tests at the Mayo Clinic (my favorite gag is when Burns is slid into an MRI machine, only to hear the thing grind to a halt with an error message reading 'Clear body jam in Area 1.')\\" References External links  *\\"The Mansion Family\\" at The Simpsons.com * * Category:The Simpsons (season 11) episodes Category:2000 American television episodes Category:Television shows written by John Swartzwelder ","title":"The Mansion Family"},{"id":"1888454","title":"List of mammalian gestation durations"},{"id":"1888455","text":"The Moderate Youth League (, MUF), officially known in English as the Swedish Young Conservatives, is the youth wing of the Swedish Moderate Party.

In 1946 the organization changed its name to the Youth Association of the Right (Swedish: H√∂gerns ungdomsf√∂rbund). The current name was adopted in 1969.  Organization  The Moderate Youth League is led by a national executive committee, elected every two years at the national congress. The President is supported by two vice- chairmen. Normally, members of the national executive have served at district level first. The current chairman, for example, used to be chairman of the Stockholm district. The national chairman also sits on the national board of the Moderate Party. Districts follow county borders. The largest one is Stockholm, followed by Sk√•ne. They maintain a rivalry, sometimes staging competitions on who can recruit the most members. Other large districts include Uppsala and √ñsterg√∂tland.  Young Conservative Moderates  The Young Conservative Moderates (Unga konservativa moderater) are an internal faction of the Moderate Youth League. It was founded in 2004 as M√∂rkbl√•tt v√§rn (literally Dark-Blue Defence), but changed to its current name after the founder left to join the Christian Democrats. Young Conservative Moderates seek to promote a conservative alternative to the current dominance of liberalism within the organisation. The organisation compromises both traditionalists and neoconservatives.  Moderate School Youth  The Moderate School Youth (Moderat skolungdom, MSU) is a part of the organisation and includes all MUF members between 12 and 20 years of age. At the annual conference, a national executive is elected. They are not decision-makers but more of an elite campaigning team which travel around Sweden. The national chairman has a place on the national executive of the Youth League. The current chairman, since 2020, is Rebecca Nordin Vainio.Rebecca Nordin Vainio elected chair of Moderate School Youth 2020-03-11 (in Swedish)  Moderate Students  In 2008, the Moderate Students was founded as a student network within the Moderate Youth League and it has since then grown to become the largest student political organization in Sweden. It is the official student organization of the Moderate Youth League, the youth wing of the Swedish Moderate Party. Organization Moderate Students is a national organization consisting of student associations on various universities and campuses in Sweden. Individual membership is sorted by district. Moderate Students originally existed as a party in the student union at Lund University, before the union was dissolved in 1998. Today, the Moderate Students exist as parties at other universities, such as Uppsala University and Ume√• University. Politics Moderate Students focuses primarily on students' economical situations. They have advocated for an extended \\"work-tax reduction\\" for young people () and for removing taxes on work and studies in general. They specifically want to repeal the tax on students who take out a student loan and work in addition to their studies. They have also become involved in discussions about the availability of student housing. National board members The 2009 Moderate Students national board consisted of chairman Caroline Garsbo, first vice chairman Jonas Grafstr√∂m, second vice chairman Anna Alriksson, Erik Persson, Pirita Isegran, and Cecilia Hellgren. The 2010 board was led by chairman Erik Persson and first vice chairman Michael Wigg. Additional members included Lars Hindrum, Ida Drougge, Evelina Kogsta, and P√©teris Timofejevs Henriksson. The 2011 board was led by chairman Ida Drougge, first vice chairman Andrea Str√∂m, and second vice chairman Alexandra Westman. Additional members included Evelina Kogsta, Erik Raita, Simon Vallin, and Petter Kr√∂nmark. The 2012 board was chaired by Andrea Str√∂m, with Filip Solsj√∂ and Olivia Andersson serving as first and second vice chairmen, respectively. Additional members included Jeanette Wid√©n, Erik Gestrinius, Therese Lindstr√∂m, and Clara Enocson. The 2014 board, was chaired by Benjamin Dousa, with Armend Dushica and Annie Widerberg serving as first and second vice chairmen, respectively. Additional members included Caroline Jarbratt, Mikael Persson, Jesper Skalberg Karlsson and Denice Sigvardsson.

The Confederation of Swedish Conservative and Liberal Students (Fria moderata studentf√∂rbundet, FMSF) was dislodged from the party because of its radical neoliberalism. Therefore, many students join the Youth League instead. This results in the age of members spanning the whole age-spectrum from roughly 15 to 30. There is, however, widespread cross-membership between the youth and student leagues. In Uppsala, a traditional student town, the radicalism of the Student League has also spread to the local MUF district due to almost all local leaders also being active in the Confederation of Swedish Conservative and Liberal Students. Naturally many current politicians of the Moderate Party, started their careers in the Youth League. The most famous being the current leader of the party, Fredrik Reinfeldt, who is a former chairman. The last chairman, Christofer Fjellner, was elected to the European Parliament before resigning from his Youth League position. The Moderate Youth League played a great part in this, lobbying for him inside the party and campaigning for him in the election. In 2002, Tove Lifvendahl became the first Youth League chairman to be elected to the national board of the party directly after resigning from the Moderate Youth League. Many former leaders left politics but gained prominence in other spheres of society, most of all in business. The Moderate Youth League has around 9,500 members (2004/2005).  Ideology  The Moderate Youth League defines its ideology in four statements. Apart from these, the Youth League publishes no manifestos or political programmes of any sort. These are: * For the freedom of the individual. Against political oppression and coercion. * For every human's responsibility for his/her own future. Against paternalism and the nanny state (f√∂rmynderi och politisk kl√•fingrighet). * For diversity and respect for differences. Against intolerance and conformity. * For a free market and a world without borders. Against walls and regulations. The modern Moderate Youth League are staunch supporters of capitalism, deregulation and lower taxes. They also adhere to individualism, which extends to wide-reaching support for gay rights. The League supports free trade, free immigration\\"MUF f√∂r fri invandring efter Skellefte√•f√∂rslag\\", V√§sterbottens Folkblad and wants to abolish foreign aid.\\"Muf i Sk√•ne fick igenom krav p√• slopat bist√•nd\\" , Helsingborgs Dagblad Like its opponents in the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League, the Moderate Youth League has suffered from divisions between different factions. The 1990s saw many battles between modernising neoliberals and conservatives. At the congress in Lycksele in 1992, Fredrik Reinfeldt, the former leader between 25 October 2003 ‚Äì 10 January 2015 of Moderate Party, was elected chairman, defeating the neoliberal Ulf Kristersson. In recent years, however, the division have largely disappeared. With the Moderates becoming more cosmopolitan, the traditionalist Conservatives have all but disappeared. Gay rights were a source of division, but now almost all of the Moderate Youth League supports equal rights of marriage and adoption for homosexuals. A conservative fringe group, however, was formed - Young Conservative Moderates (Unga konservativa moderater) - but did not gain widespread membership. In foreign policy, MUF tends to support the United States, including the 2003 Iraq War and Swedish NATO membership. Chairwoman Tove Lifvendahl proudly wore an \\"I love Bush\\" shirt after George W. Bush's election in 2000, although she was quick to criticise him for the steel tariffs he later imposed. It is also strongly supportive of Israel.\\"Israel tar nu sitt ansvar och angriper terroristerna som bedrar, hj√§rntv√§ttar och f√∂rst√∂r livet f√∂r ett helt folk.

These \\"Dead Inside\\" strive to regain or rebuild their souls. The game provides a variety of means by which souls may be lost, stolen, traded, regained or rebuilt. The game is considered unusual for its attempt to reverse the typical \\"Kill monsters and take their stuff\\" path to power found in most RPGs and replace it with the \\"Heal people and give them stuff\\" concept. Essentially, selfless and noble actions by the characters are rewarded with Soul Points, the measure of a character's soul integrity. These Soul Points can be used to fuel metaphysical powers or to improve a character's abilities, much as experience points are used in other RPGs. Dead Inside won the People's Choice Award in the 2004 Indie RPG Awards. Cosmology Dead Inside is chiefly divided into two realms - the stable, modern-day \\"Real World\\" and the dreamlike, mercurial \\"Spirit World\\". The \\"Real World\\" is familiar and mostly devoid of the supernatural, at least on the surface (all supernatural powers and abilities in the game are weak and very difficult to use there). Its main denizens are \\"Average People\\" - those who own their original soul, who are incapable of visiting the Spirit World or perceiving the supernatural. The \\"Spirit World\\" is an ever shifting dreamscape. Its geography is hard to pin down, but consists of five chief areas: the Wood in the East, the Waste in the South, the Mists in the North, the Sea to the West, and in the center, The City. Across the Sea (although direction has little real meaning in the Spirit World) lies the Source; the centre of the cosmos from which all souls are born and to which they return after death. Outside of this whole lies the Void, a limitless expanse of utter nothingness, into which any soul is lost forever. It is said that the Real World protects the Spirit World and Source from the Void much as the shell of an egg protects the yolk. The Real and Spirit Worlds may be travelled between by the supernaturally aware via \\"Gates\\": shimmering portals between the realms that can be opened by those who know how. It is impossible to travel to the Source short of death; or at least, no-one who has ever attempted the trip has returned. The concept of Soul The concept of Soul is key to Dead Inside. It is key to one's spiritual well-being - beings without enough soul (like the Dead Inside) feel a strong sense of loss, of being empty, which manifests as physical and emotional desensitivity, depression, even pain. Those with plenty of soul, conversely, are dynamic, energetic and full of life. Soul is also a valuable resource and commodity. It can be expended to use supernatural Abilities and Powers, it can be traded and it can even be stolen. It is also a moral barometer - different actions are regarded as either 'soul-cultivating' or 'soul rotting'. In this way it is possible to gain or lose soul based purely upon how your character acts, although the justification for action is also important. Players are thus encouraged to role-play in a selfless and virtuous manner, and also to explain 'why' their characters act in the way they do. In the mechanics of the game, your amount of soul is expressed as \\"Soul Points\\". Character types The game features a wide variety of types of characters, most of which are suitable for use by players (depending on the power level desired). They include:  Average People  People with exactly the right amount of soul, such that they have a thickened spiritual \\"shell\\" around themselves. Due to this spiritual health, they are protected from (but also blinded to) most forms of supernatural influence. Their souls can be stolen by cracking the \\"shell\\" (although this is difficult), or they can be traded away with the owner's consent (easier). An Average Person who loses their soul for whatever reason becomes Dead Inside. Dead Inside Beings who lack a complete soul. As they lack the \\"shell\\" of Average People, the Dead Inside are aware of the supernatural; however, they lack the spiritual resources to make frequent use of supernatural powers. Instead, most Dead Inside seek to regain their old souls, or build new ones. If they are successful in this endeavour and they manage to 'ensoul', they will become Sensitives. If, however, they lose their last shards of a soul, they will become Qlippoth. Sensitives Beings with more than enough soul, Sensitives are vibrant individuals. Their surfeit of soulstuff allows them to use supernatural abilities more often, but not greatly so. Sensitives may be helpers, seeking to aid the Dead Inside and other beings. Others are less selfless - some remain happy with their lot; still others go on to seek further power by becoming Magi. Magi Beings with a double soul (that is, twice as much as an average person), Magi possess significant spiritual power, of which they will make frequent use. Zombis Dead bodies lacking souls, Zombis possess only just enough spiritual force to keep them preserved and animated. As such, they become emotionless, cold beings. They are not stupid or slow, however - their cold rationality and force of will mean they are often smart, skilled and strong, and many have had centuries of existence to practice. Dead Inside become Zombis when they die, and the death of a Mage will also create a Zombi (as well as a Ghost). Zombis can also lose their last shreds of a soul. If they are in the real world, they stop moving, and finally appear to be dead. If they lose these shreds in the Spiritual World, they become Qlippoth. Ghosts Dead souls lacking bodies are ordinarily called back to the Source; however, some remain in the Worlds (both Real and Spirit), usually due to some ties they still have to their previous existence. These beings are Ghosts. Qlippoths Beings that no longer have any trace of a soul. They hate everything and wish for the destruction of the Source to end their suffering. They consume souls to ease their suffering. All others revile Qlippoths as abominations. Author and publisher The game was created by Chad Underkoffler and is produced by Atomic Sock Monkey Press, a small-press RPG company.

It is generally referred to as the Irish Sweepstake, frequently abbreviated to Irish Sweeps or Irish Sweep. The Public Charitable Hospitals (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1930 was the act that established the lottery; as this act expired in 1934, in accordance with its terms, the Public Hospitals Acts were the legislative basis for the scheme thereafter. The main organisers were Richard Duggan, Captain Spencer Freeman and Joe McGrath. Duggan was a well known Dublin bookmaker who had organised a number of sweepstakes in the decade prior to setting up the Hospitals' Sweepstake. Captain Freeman was a Welsh-born engineer and former captain in the British Army. After the Constitution of Ireland was enacted in 1937, the name Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake was adopted. History The sweepstake was established because there was a need for investment in hospitals and medical services and the public finances were unable to meet this expense at the time. As the people of Ireland were unable to raise sufficient funds, because of the low population, a significant amount of the funds were raised in the United Kingdom and United States, often among the emigrant Irish. Potentially winning tickets were drawn from rotating drums, usually by nurses in uniform. Each such ticket was assigned to a horse expected to run in one of several horse races, including the Cambridgeshire Handicap, Derby and Grand National.Coleman 2009. Tickets that drew the favourite horses thus stood a higher likelihood of winning and a series of winning horses had to be chosen on the accumulator system, allowing for enormous prizes. F. F. Warren, the engineer who designed the mixing drums from which sweepstake tickets were drawn The original sweepstake draws were held at The Mansion House, Dublin on 19 May 1939 under the supervision of the Chief Commissioner of Police, and were moved to the more permanent fixture at the Royal Dublin Society (RDS) in Ballsbridge later in 1940. The Adelaide Hospital in Dublin was the only hospital at the time not to accept money from the Hospitals Trust, as the governors disapproved of sweepstakes. From the 1960s onwards, revenues declined. The offices were moved to Lotamore House in Cork. Although giving the appearance of a public charitable lottery, with nurses featured prominently in the advertising and drawings, the Sweepstake was in fact a private for-profit lottery company, and the owners were paid substantial dividends from the profits. Fortune Magazine described it as \\"a private company run for profit and its handful of stockholders have used their earnings from the sweepstakes to build a group of industrial enterprises that loom quite large in the modest Irish economy. Waterford Glass, Irish Glass Bottle Company and many other new Irish companies were financed by money from this enterprise and up to 5,000 people were given jobs.\\"Fortune Magazine, November 1966 By his death in 1966, Joe McGrath had interests in the racing industry, and held the Renault dealership for Ireland besides large financial and property assets. He was known throughout Ireland for his tough business attitude but also by his generous spirit. At that time, Ireland was still one of the poorer countries in Europe; he believed in investment in Ireland. His home, Cabinteely House, was donated to the state in 1986. The house and the surrounding park are now in the ownership of D√∫n Laoghaire‚ÄìRathdown County Council who have invested in restoring and maintaining the house and grounds as a public park. In 1986, the Irish government created a new public lottery, and the company failed to secure the new contract to manage it. The final sweepstake was held in January 1986 and the company was unsuccessful for a licence bid for the Irish National Lottery, which was won by An Post later that year. The company went into voluntary liquidation in March 1987. The majority of workers did not have a pension scheme but the sweepstake had fed many families during lean times and was regarded as a safe job. The Public Hospitals (Amendment) Act, 1990 was enacted for the orderly winding up of the scheme, which had by then almost ¬£500,000 in unclaimed prizes and accrued interest. A collection of advertising material relating to the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes is among the Special Collections of National Irish Visual Arts Library. In the United Kingdom and North America At the time of the Sweepstake's inception, lotteries were generally illegal in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. In the absence of other readily available lotteries, the Irish Sweeps became popular. Even though tickets were illegal outside Ireland, millions were sold in the US and Great Britain. How many of these tickets failed to make it back for the drawing is unknown. The United States Customs Service alone confiscated and destroyed several million counterfoils from shipments being returned to Ireland. In the UK, the sweepstakes caused some strain in Anglo-Irish relations, and the Betting and Lotteries Act 1934 was passed by the parliament of the UK to prevent export and import of lottery related materials.Coleman 2005.Coleman 2009. The United States Congress had outlawed the use of the US Postal Service for lottery purposes in 1890. A thriving black market sprang up for tickets in both jurisdictions. From the 1950s onwards, as the American, British and Canadian governments relaxed their attitudes towards this form of gambling, and went into the lottery business themselves, the Irish Sweeps, never legal in the United States, declined in popularity.

Zhang Zeduan (; 1085‚Äì1145),China Online Museum, article on Zhang Zeduan courtesy name Zheng Dao (), was a Chinese painter of the Song Dynasty. He lived during the transitional period from the Northern Song to the Southern Song, and was instrumental in the early history of the Chinese landscape art style known as shan shui. Historical significance In terms of historical significance, Zhang's original painting of the Along the River During the Qingming Festival reveals much about life in China during the 11th-12th century. Its myriad depictions of different people interacting with one another reveals the nuances of class structure and the many hardships of urban life as well. It also displays accurate depictions of technological practices found in Song China. For example, it depicts one river ship lowering its bipod mast before passing under the prominent bridge of the painting.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 463. It shows ships in two major types, yet all of which have slung rudders for steering; the painting depicts freighters with narrow sterns or passenger boats and smaller craft with broad sterns, sailing upriver or docked along the banks while loading and unloading goods. Large stern sweeps and bow sweeps can be seen on at least three of the river ships, worked by up to eight men each. It also shows how personal gardens had begun to take root in China‚Äîin addition to the immense walled garden on the far left of the scroll, for example, one sees several private gardens with their man-made mountains and rockery (for example, the small private garden close to the city gate, squeezed between a chemist's shop and a large building selling furniture, consisting of a small pond surrounded by trees and bamboo).

Ross Robertson Cup"},{"id":"1888490","text":"Rheopecty or rheopexy is the rare property of some non-Newtonian fluids to show a time-dependent increase in viscosity (time-dependent viscosity); the longer the fluid undergoes shearing force, the higher its viscosity. Rheopectic fluids, such as some lubricants, thicken or solidify when shaken. The opposite and much more common type of behaviour, in which fluids become less viscous the longer they undergo shear, is called thixotropy. Examples of rheopectic fluids include gypsum pastes and printer inks. In the body synovial fluid exhibits the extraordinary property of inverse thixotropy or rheopexy. There is ongoing research into new ways to make and use rheopectic materials. There is great interest in possible military uses of this technology. Moreover, the high end of the sports market has also begun to respond to it. Body armor and combat vehicle armor are key areas where efforts are being made to use rheopectic materials. Work is also being done to use these materials in other kinds of protective equipment, which is seen as potentially useful to reduce apparent impact stress in athletics, motor sports, transportation accidents, and all forms of parachuting. In particular, footwear with rheopectic shock absorption is being pursued as a dual-use technology that can provide better support to those who must frequently run, leap, climb, or descend. Confusion between rheopectic and dilatant fluids An incorrect example often used to demonstrate rheopecty is cornstarch mixed with water, which is a very viscous, white fluid. It is a cheap and simple demonstration, which can be picked up by hand as a semi-solid, but flows easily when not under pressure. However, cornstarch in water is actually a dilatant fluid, since it does not show the time-dependent, shear-induced change required in order to be labeled rheopectic. These terms are often and easily confused since the terms are rarely used; a true rheopectic fluid would when shaken be liquid at first, becoming thicker as shaking continued. Just as the opposite behaviour of becoming thinner with time is thixotropism (time dependent pseudoplastic behaviour), rheopectic behaviour may be described as time- dependent dilatant behaviour.

It was established by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of 6 April 1930 but its statute was only defined in decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of 5 May 1930. That statute was amended by decrees of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of 7 May 1936, of 19 June 1943, of 26 February 1946, of 15 October 1947, of 16 December 1947 and by decree No 1803-X of 28 March 1980.  Award statute  The Order of the Red Star was awarded to soldiers of the Soviet Army, Navy, border and internal security forces, employees of the State Security Committee of the USSR, as well as NCOs and officers of the bodies of internal affairs; to units, warships, associations, enterprises, institutions and organizations; as well as to military personnel of foreign countries: *for personal courage and bravery in battle, for the excellent organization and leadership in combat that contributed to the success of our troops; *for successful operations of military units and formations which resulted in the enemy suffering considerable casualties or damage; *for outstanding service in ensuring public safety and the security of the State Border of the USSR; *for courage and valour displayed during the performance of military duties, or, in circumstances involving a risk to life; *for exemplary performance of special command tasks and other outstanding deeds committed in peacetime; *for great contribution in maintaining the high combat readiness of troops, excellent performance in combat and political training, in the mastery of new combat equipment and other services associated with strengthening the defensive might of the USSR; *for merit in the development of military science and technologies used in training of the Armed Forces of the USSR; *for merit in strengthening the defence capabilities of the socialist community. The Order of the Red Star is worn on the right side of the chest and when in the presence of other orders of the USSR, placed immediately after the Order of the Patriotic War 2nd class. If worn in the presence of Orders or medals of the Russian Federation, the latter have precedence.  Long service award  The Order of the Red Star was also used as a long service award from 1944 to 1958 to mark fifteen years of service in the military, state security, or police. Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of 14 September 1957 emphasised the devaluation of certain Soviet high military Orders used as long service awards instead of their originally intended criteria. This led to the joint 25 January 1958 decree of the Ministers of Defence, of Internal Affairs and of the Chairman of the Committee on State Security of the USSR establishing the Medal \\"For Impeccable Service\\" putting an end to the practice.  Award description  The Order of the Red Star is a red enamelled 47mm to 50mm wide (depending on the variant) silver five pointed star. In the center of the obverse, an oxydised silver shield bearing the image of an erect soldier wearing an overcoat and carrying a rifle, along the shield's entire circumference, a narrow band bearing the Communist motto in relief, \\"Workers of the world, unite!\\" (), the band below the soldier bore the relief inscription \\"USSR\\" (). Below the shield, the hammer and sickle also of oxydised silver. The otherwise plain reverse bore the maker's mark and the award serial number. The Order was attached to clothing by a threaded stud and screw attachment. When the order wasn't worn, a ribbon could be worn in its stead on the ribbon bar on the left side of the chest. The ribbon of the Order of the red Star was a 24mm wide silk moir√© dark red with a 5mm wide central silver stripe.

The family was originally based in Dundrum having come to Ireland in the year 1210. The Fitzwilliams built Merrion Castle on lands which are today the property of the Sisters of Charity and St Mary's Home and School for the Blind. Merrion features on the 1598 map \\"A Modern Depiction of Ireland, One of the British Isles\\" by Abraham Ortelius as \\"Mergon\\". By 1710 the castle was in such a bad state of repair that Richard, the 5th Viscount Fitzwilliam, selected 100 acres (0.4 km¬≤) on which he built Mount Merrion House, surrounding the house by an granite wall. The house was completed in 1711 and served as a new seat by the 5th Viscount Fitzwilliam on the hill at Mount Merrion. The Fitzwilliam family left for England around 1726. Although the family no longer lived in Mount Merrion House, they retained possession of it, and rented the house out. The next Fitzwilliam to take a major interest in Mount Merrion was Richard FitzWilliam, 7th Viscount FitzWilliam, who remained a bachelor all his life. It was he who willed ¬£100,000 to build the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, his former university. Prior to his death in 1816, he bequeathed his vast estates to his cousin George Herbert, 11th Earl of Pembroke. Mount Merrion was occupied for a time by the Fitzwilliam agent Barbara Verschoyle and her husband, then Lord Herbert of Lea, and later by Sir Neville Wilkinson, from 1903 to 1914. On first edition OSI Maps (early to mid 19th century) the townland is named 'Mount Merrion or Callary', and that name is still in evidence by Callary Road which runs to the east of Foster Ave. Deer Park Deer Park was landscaped by the 5th Viscount Fitzwilliam. The parklands comprise the area behind the site of Mount Merrion House. The park is now open to the public. It was created in 1971 from a collection of open public spaces and some acquisitions of private land. The park contains both sporting facilities (soccer and Gaelic football pitches and Deerpark Tennis Club) and landscaped land for more informal pursuits. Its location and altitude also provide it with a great view of Dublin city towards the north, which is often used by photographers for panoramas and also by developers to assess the impact of development on the cityscape. Crowds also gather in Deerpark to look out at the annual Skyfest fireworks display around St. Patricks Weekend which is sometimes held in Dublin city centre. It can also be a good vantage point for observing the Northern Lights, also known as the Aurora Borealis when they are visible in the Dublin area. There is also a view of parts of the Dublin mountains to the south. It is claimed that Strongbow's white stallion is buried somewhere in Deer Park. :\\"Perhaps the most interesting remaining part of the 18th-century development is the landscape element. The present Deerpark is a public park to the west of the house and included a wooded area which corresponds exactly to the walled woodland area laid out with radial paths shown on the earliest map (1757). The position of the 'gazebo' is now a platform with an assembly of cut stone elements lying on the ground, the origin of the material is not known to me. I believe that the radial form of the landscape can still be detected and consider that this may offer scope for an exercise in landscape conservation.\\" (from historical research, carried out by Denis Cogan, 1999) 20th century Church of St. Therese The estate at Mount Merrion started to be sold off to property developers Mount Merrion Estates around 1925, as this area of Dublin rapidly built up with suburban housing in the mid-20th century. Mount Merrion House itself was sold to the Catholic church in 1936. The main house was converted for use as a Catholic church, and a new church, the Church of St. Therese, was built alongside in 1956. Much of the house was demolished in the late seventies. However, the front block of the house was retained and a new community centre was built onto the back of it. The plans for recent construction work on the community centre originally involved the demolition of the house, however, the plans were amended due to protests. The stables survive beside the church. The original granite gateway was salvaged and now stands as the entrance to Willow Park School on the Rock Road (Willow Park's own original gateway on Booterstown Avenue was later removed). Part of the estate eventually became the men-only Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club on Appian Way. These lands were part of the Fitzwilliam and later Pembroke Estates. Maps such as John Roque's (1760) and Barker's Estate Maps (1762) show much of what is now Deerpark as a formal walled garden and many of the prominent avenues and boundaries of the nearby Mount Merrion House lands form the basis of the present local road network.See also: \\"Mount Merrion: 1711-2011\\", by local historian, Joe Curtis. Sport Deerpark now hosts sports such as football and tennis. The football pitches are used by Mount Merrion Youths Football Club and Kilmacud Crokes GAA club. Deerpark Tennis ClubDeerpark Tennis Club is a community tennis club, founded in the 1970s. The tennis club, established in 1976, is known as Deerpark Tennis Club.http://www.deerparkltc.com The club has six synthetic surface courts, all floodlit. Competitions are organised throughout the year. The club participates in the Dublin Lawn Tennis Council (DLTC) Leagues in the greater Dublin area. Deerpark opened its new clubhouse in August 2010. Mount Merrion Youths Football Club is a community-based club. The club first represented Mount Merrion at the 1974 Community Games. In 2007 the club established its first representative all-girls team. All representatives of the club operate on a voluntary basis. In 2005, the club's under-18 representatives won the Leinster Football Association Youths' Cup. Although there is no GAA club in Mount Merrion, some residents play for Kilmacud Crokes who play their juvenile matches in Deer Park. A local school, Scoil San Treasa, plays both Gaelic football and hurling.

King was 17 when she was invited to speak at the United Nations. Twenty years after her father was assassinated, she preached her trial sermon. Inspired by her parents' activism. Her mother suffered a stroke in 2005 and, after she died the following year, King delivered the eulogy at her funeral. A turning point in her life, King experienced conflict within her family when her sister Yolanda and brother Dexter supported the sale of the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change. After her sister died in 2007, she delivered the eulogy for her as well. She supported the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008 and called his nomination part of her father's dream. King was elected president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 2009. Her elder brother Martin III and her father had previously held the position. She was the first woman elected to the presidency in the organization's history, amidst the SCLC holding two separate conventions. King became upset with the actions of the SCLC, amid feeling that the organization was ignoring her suggestions and declined the presidency in January 2010. King became CEO of the King Center only months afterward. King's primary focus as CEO of The King Center and in life is to ensure that her father's nonviolent philosophy and methodology (which The King Center calls Nonviolence 365) is integrated in various sects of society, including education, government, business, media, arts and entertainment and sports. King believes that Nonviolence 365 is the answer to society's problems and promotes it being embraced as a way of life. King is also the CEO of First Kingdom Management, a Christian consulting firm based in Atlanta, Georgia. Early life= Early childhood and tragedies  Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph Bernice Albertine King was born on March 28, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia. The day after she was born, her father had to leave for Birmingham, Alabama, but he rushed back when it was time for Bernice and her mother, Coretta, to leave the hospital. He drove them home himself but, in what was all too typical with the work he was doing, had to leave them again within hours.McPherson, p. 56. Following her birth, Harry Belafonte realized the toll the Civil Rights Movement was taking on her mother's time and energy and offered to pay for a nurse to help Coretta with the Kings' four children. They accepted and hired a person that would help with the children for the next five or six years.Bagley, p. 256. Her father died a week after Bernice's fifth birthday.Bagley, p. 238. Once, she and her sister Yolanda thought it would be funny to pour water into their father's ear while he was sleeping. Their father, though, was furious. It was the first and only time he would ever spank them. Later on, Coretta told Bernice that her father had celebrated her fifth birthday, knowledge that has been special to her since. King said she has only two strong memories of her father, one of him at home with their family and the other of him lying in the casket at his funeral. \\"I don't let people know this, but I think of my father constantly,\\" King said at age 19. \\"Even though I knew him so little, he left me so much.\\" When her father was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, Bernice was asleep. When she woke up, her mother told her that the next time she saw her father would be at his funeral. In the April 1998 issue of BET Entertainment Weekly, King reflected, \\"I was five when my father was assassinated, so I had no concept of who my father really was. I have been told, but imagine trying to really understand or put it in its proper perspective at that age. When it finally became clear to me around fifteen or sixteen, I was angry at him because he left me. So I didn't want to have anything to do with my father.\\"Barras, p. 136. After her husband's death, Coretta Scott King took on the role of raising four children as a single mother. Family friends recall that she spent considerable time with Bernice, who feels that being raised by a single parent has given her special insight into single-parent homes. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have a father to deal with about boyfriends. I didn‚Äôt have a father to show me how a man and woman relate in a family setting. Therefore I have given over my life to mentoring young people. I‚Äôm adamant about young people who have been denied a father/daughter relationship.‚Äù Other tragedies followed. King's uncle, Alfred Daniel Williams King, drowned in a swimming pool when Bernice was six on July 21, 1969. Five years later, a mentally ill man shot her grandmother Alberta Williams King to death during a service at the Ebenezer Baptist Church on June 30, 1974. King recalled of her grandmother's death, \\"I remember that day because I had recovered from having my tonsils removed, and I was really looking forward to getting back to Ebenezer, which was pastored by my grandfather on my dad's side of the family.\\"Hanna, pp. 81-82. Just two years later in 1976, her 20-year-old cousin Darlene King died of a heart attack. Her grandfather Martin Luther King Sr. also died of a heart attack on November 11, 1984. Also her other cousin Alfred King the second in 1986. Finding strength through these childhood tragedies, King jokingly said, required \\"A lot of prayer. Some crying. Some screaming.\\" Through all of her struggles, she has looked for someone to relate to in \\"moments\\" because \\"nobody fits the bill.\\" Her sister, Yolanda, nearly eight years older, lived through parts of the Civil Rights Movement that she never did. On the other hand, she has written that she believes her brothers have had a life significantly different from hers because \\"Guys process things differently.\\"  Call to ministry  Bernice has said that the deaths of her grandmother and uncle caused her to have anger issues since she was 16 years old. At that age, she saw Montgomery to Memphis, a documentary film on her father's life from the time of the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955 to his assassination in 1968, and \\"went through almost two hours of crying\\" and questioning. She had seen the film many times growing up, but the particular viewing \\"triggered an emotional explosion that later would thrust her into the arms of a loving God.\\" King reflected: \\"When I saw the funeral scene, I just broke down. I ran out of the cabin into the woods, and for nearly 2-1/2 hours, I just cried.\\" She credited the viewing with influencing her to become a minister like her father, who served as a minister at Ebenezer Baptist Church. She was with her church youth group in Georgia mountains. King aspired to become the first female President of the United States at the time of seeing the documentary. Timothy McDonald brought the tape of the documentary and comforted her when she started crying. According to McDonald, he explained to her that it was good that she let out how she felt and called coming to terms with her father's death \\"a stepping stone upon which you will build the rest of your life‚Äù. King attended Douglass High School in Atlanta. Her brother Dexter Scott King attended the school as well and graduated when she was a sophomore. At 17, she was invited to speak at the United Nations in the absence of her mother. According to King, she also received a call to ministry that year. Adult life King in 2006 At the age of 19, she made her first major speech in Chicago, and stated that \\"We've come a long way. But we have a long way to go.\\" In early 1983, King gave a speech at St. Sabina Church in Chicago. Many members of the audience said that she reminded them of her father. King attended Grinnell College in Iowa, and graduated from Spelman College, a historically black college in Atlanta, with a degree in psychology in 1985. Jabari Simama, The Quiet Storm: Bernice King, atlantamagazine.com, USA, October 1, 1997 King says she had thoughts of suicide before \\"God intervened.\\" King was arrested with her mother Coretta and her brother Martin Luther King III on June 26, 1985 with the offense of demonstrating in front of an embassy. They were participating in anti-apartheid demonstration in front of the South African Embassy. The three stayed in jail overnight. The youngest daughter of Martin Luther King, his widow and his eldest son were charged with a misdemeanor, demonstrating within 500 feet of an embassy. On January 7, 1986, King was arrested with her sister Yolanda and her brother Martin Luther King III for \\"disorderly conduct.\\" Bernice and her siblings were arrested by officers deployed to the Winn Dixie supermarket. The supermarket had been subject to protest since September 1985, which was when the Southern Christian Leadership Conference began boycotts of South African canned fruit. It was the first time Bernice and her siblings had been arrested together at a protest. On January 15, 1987, what would have been her father's 58th birthday, King spoke in Chicago and told denizens to stay away from drugs. At the age of 24, Bernice decided to become a minister, and she earned a Master's degree in Divinity and a juris doctor from Emory University in 1990.

No blood, no sweat, no tears could earn me this high calling.\\" On January 18, 1992, President George H. W. Bush visited the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change. King spoke during his visit of the problems of racism, poverty and violence remained in America since her father was alive, but did not directly align any of the issues with President Bush. In January 1994, King voiced her opposition to New Hampshire's refusal to recognize Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, calling the decision \\"racist and separatist.\\" On May 21, 1994, she attended the African-American Women's Conference where she said that parents should not let their children listen to \\"gangster rap\\" because of messages in the lyrics. In 1996, King published a collection of her sermons and speeches called Hard Questions, Heart Answers.Hard Questions, Heart Answers, In 2000, she narrated a performance of Aaron Copland's Lincoln Portrait at the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival in Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.

She was an elder at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, but resigned in May 2011. King joined the church in 2002 and came to regard Bishop Eddie Long as her mentor and spiritual father. The church was the setting for her mother's funeral. Despite her leaving of the church coinciding with Bishop Eddie Long's settlement agreement in sexual misconduct lawsuits he had fought since September 2010, King said that she had planned to leave New Birth Missionary Baptist Church for weeks. \\"It has nothing to do with anything that's going on with Bishop Long,\\" King said on May 25, 2011. \\"I always knew I would not be at New Birth forever. This is the time for me to leave.\\" On May 25, 2011, King told an interviewer that her last time serving as a member of the church was the past Sunday. She has said her decision to leave was because of her desire to continue the legacy of her parents, which had grown stronger since the death of her mother. At the time that she chose to leave the church, she planned on starting her own ministry. King said her mother heard Obama's speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention and contacted her the following day over the senator's address, expressing her belief in Obama's political future.\\"HAPPY BIRTHDAY MARTIN! MLK's Daughter Moved to Tears\\". YouTube. January 15, 2009. Retrieved April 21, 2014. In June 2006, King told a teenage audience that she intended to do more to carry on the legacy of nonviolence espoused by her parents during the 20th annual 100 Black Men of America conference in Atlanta. \\"My desire is not to be a hypocrite,\\" King said. \\"I want to make sure my life is not a contradiction when I take a platform.\\" On January 30, 2007, one year after the death of her mother Coretta, King founded the Be A King Scholarship at Spelman College, her alma mater, in honor of her mother's legacy. On June 10, 2007, King acted as a presenter at the 2007 Atlanta H.U.F. Awards. Afeni Shakur said she was happy to have King and the other presenters \\"participating\\" that year. On May 4, 2013, a rose was planted for King's mother, Coretta, at the Alabama Capitol. Bernice said that while her mother loved roses, she did not have much time to tend to them because she was continuing her husband Martin Luther King, Jr.'s legacy. On April 29, 2014, King and her brother Martin Luther King III joined Governor of Georgia Nathan Deal while he signed legislation to provide a statue of their father. ‚ÄúWe all know that monuments and statues are that, they‚Äôre things we put in place for people to remember and it's not always for our generation,‚Äù Bernice King said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really about the next generation.‚Äù On May 31, 2014, King accepted a $50,000 grant from Microsoft during the opening of its store at Perimeter Mall in Atlanta. Also in attendance to the ceremony were Mary Carol Alexander, Georgia Department of Labor Commissioner Mark Butler and Representative Tom Taylor.

King was the keynote speaker at the Atlantic City Rescue Mission 50th anniversary gala, held on August 14, 2014. During her college years, King considered a career as a television anchor. In May 1988, King was among the students of Emory charging that the college should hire more African-Americans as teachers and teach the works of African- American theologians in its courses. She said, \\"Black students on predominately White campuses have been ignored, humiliated, intimidated...and in many instances, eliminated.\\" She said the students and people in general had excused the \\"insensitivity\\" of the administration and faculty \\"for too long.\\" Bernice served as a student chaplain at the Georgia Retardation Center and Georgia Baptist Hospital as part of the requirements for her theology class and interned at the Atlanta City Attorney's office. She is a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, as was her mother. On March 27, 1988, nearly 20 years after her father's assassination, King delivered her first sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church. The sermon's theme was \\"You've Got To Rise Above The Crowd.\\" King said her decision to deliver the sermon as \\"affirming a call I received at 17.\\" She also said, \\"At some point in our lives, comes the moment of decision. For me, that moment is now. I submit myself totally to the will of God.\\" Andrew Young, who attended the sermon, compared her style to her father's and noted their similarities while calling listening to her speak \\"a very emotional occasion for me.\\" Young also said that King becoming a minister \\"almost makes you believe preaching is hereditary,\\" after her service. By delivering an \\"acceptable sermon,\\" King was given her license to preach by Joseph Roberts, pastor of Ebenezer who stated, \\"We rejoice with God, the angels and the archangels that another warrior, a peaceful warrior, is fighting under the spirit of her father, grandfather and uncle.\\" Veteran members of the church said her style was similar to her father's. King's mother said at the time that she was satisfied with her daughter's decision to become a minister and stated that they had become closer than ever in the months leading up to the sermon. She also said listening to her daughter delivering a sermon with the same fervor and intensity her father had \\"was a joyous occasion; a real thanksgiving.\\" Also in attendance where all three of her elder siblings, Yolanda, Martin Luther King III and Dexter. King's maternal grandparents were reported by her mother to have also been moved by the speech. Her sermon was delivered the day before her twenty-fifth birthday. King Center In 2008, King and her brother, Martin Luther King III, filed suit over the alleged mismanagement of funds from the King Center against their brother Dexter Scott King, who then filed a countersuit against them. Dexter King articulated his distress over Bernice's conservative religious views as departing from their father's legacy. In October 2009 the lawsuits were settled out of court. In January 2012, King was named CEO of the King Center. On May 19, 2012, King met with A√Øssata Issoufou Mahamadou, First Lady of Niger and wife of Mahamadou Issoufou. Mahamadou's visit to the King Center was a priority during her trip to the United States, having been an ardent admirer of King's father and mother. King accepted a plaque bearing crucifix symbols from Mahamadou. On September 26, 2013, Evelyn G. Lowery died at her home. The King Center released a statement from Bernice King in response to her death, with her saying \\"I am deeply saddened by the death of Mrs. Evelyn Gibson Lowery, and my heart goes out to her husband, Dr. Joseph E. Lowery and their three daughters, Yvonne Kennedy, Karen Lowery and Cheryl Lowery-Osborne. We are never prepared to say 'goodbye' to a loved one.\\" When Vice President Joe Biden aligned with her in celebrating a \\"naturalization ceremony\\" for an estimated hundred immigrants on November 16, 2013, she displayed distaste for the terms \\"illegal aliens\\" and \\"illegals\\". On March 28, 2014, in honor of King's 51st birthday, the King Center hosted a girl and women's empowerment event. The organization held a special screening of the documentary \\"Girls Rising.\\" King herself said the experience was \\"designed to educate, empower and inspire young women to confront and overcome the obstacles they face in their struggles to fulfill their dreams and impact the global community.‚Äù On August 13, 2014, King addressed the shooting death of Michael Brown and demonstrators reacting in response. She called on demonstrators to channel their responses into constructive nonviolent action, and mentioned witnesses giving conflicting accounts of the shooting. On August 19, King expressed her belief that the community of Ferguson, Missouri was crying out for help after years of neglect. It was reported that a small delegation from the King Center would travel to Ferguson and planned to meet with \\"every element\\" of the community. The following day, August 20, King released a statement on Michael Brown's death, sympathizing with his parents. On August 26, King addressed students at the Riverview Gardens High School. King told the students her father's legacy was \\"on the line\\" and if ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt turn out the right way, it could begin to have people question what happened years ago.‚Äù Public speaking King was the keynote speaker at the Seminole County Prayer Breakfast in February 1998. Geoff Koach, spokesman for Strang Communications, said prior to the breakfast that there was an expectation to see \\"a lot more people of color there\\" and another reason for her being chosen to speak was to quell racial tensions in the county. He added: \\"We felt she could help unify citizens, the various organizations, government and church officials.\\" In June 2006, five months after her mother's death, King made it known to a number of teenagers during the panel discussion at the 20th annual 100 Black Men of America conference in Atlanta that she intended to continue the legacy of nonviolence that had been attributed to her parents. That same year, King and her brother Martin Luther King III expressed interest in creating a civil rights museum near Ebenezer Baptist Church and the King Center, where both of their parents are buried. On January 20, 2009, she joined her brother Martin Luther King III on CNN's The Situation Room to discuss the inauguration of the 44th President of the United States, Barack Obama. On April 17, 2009, King delivered an address at Liberty University. LU Chancellor Jerry Falwell, Jr. said that the university had been looking forward to King speaking all year. He said King helped \\"to bridge the divide that was created between different groups of students during the 2008 election season. For example, she gave a strong Gospel message today. African American Christians and white Christians have been separated into different political camps in the last generation or so but they share many of the same core values, especially when it comes to social issues like abortion, marriage and school vouchers.\\" King said the university was a place for \\"kings-in-training.\\" She told Liberty University students they were \\"very blessed and highly favored to be at an institution such as this.\\" She called for students to accept ‚Äúyour identity. You‚Äôre a king. Don‚Äôt ever see yourself as a subject.\\" On July 7, 2009, King spoke alongside her brother Martin at the Staples Center in Los Angeles at a ceremony commemorating the life of Michael Jackson.

She and her brother Martin supported Occupy Wall Street protests. On January 13, 2012, King was the keynote speaker at the 24th Annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Awards Dinner. On March 29, 2012, a month after the shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin, King released a statement through the King Center. In her remarks, she referred back to the deaths of her father and paternal grandmother, who like Trayvon Martin, were killed by firearms. She concluded her statement by saying we \\"are still on the journey to the Mountaintop. Join me on the journey as we pray for Trayvon's family, the community of Sanford and all who are in danger of being victims of violence.\\" She made a public statement with regard to the State of Florida v. George Zimmerman verdict on July 15, 2013 via a CNN appearance with Wolf Blitzer. She clarified a tweet she had posted on Twitter, and explained that the handling of the verdict would \\"determine how much progress we've made\\". She spoke at a town hall meeting dedicated to Trayvon Martin and has admitted to having been \\"heartbroken\\" by the verdict. She said Trayvon Martin's death and Zimmerman's acquittal were a wake-up call for Americans. On August 28, 2013, the fiftieth anniversary of the March on Washington, in which her father took part, King spoke and related that the denizens of the United States were \\"still bound by a cycle of civil unrest and inherit social biases, in our nation and the world, that oftentimes degenerates into violence and destruction\\". Despite this, she admitted to being pleased to see many young people and women at the event, noting that was not the case during the March on Washington itself. King alluded to the death of teenager Trayvon Martin in February 2012 and said \\"If freedom stops ringing, then the sound will disappear and the atmosphere will be charged with something else. Fifty years later, we come once again to this special landing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to reflect, to renew and to rejuvenate for the continued struggle of freedom and justice.\\" She spoke at the Boys & Girls Clubs of Northeast Florida fundraiser on October 29, 2013, where she encouraged involvement in the lives of children.

On March 19, 2014, King gave a speech at Seminole State College of Florida as part of the school's Speaker Series.

King spoke at Fontbonne University on September 17, 2014. She was joined by members of the King Center staff, who aided her in urging the community to not act out with violence. March against same-sex marriage On December 11, 2004, King participated in a march against same-sex marriage in Atlanta. This action was in contrast to the advocacy of her mother, Coretta, and her older sister Yolanda, both longtime, outspoken supporters of gay rights. She was joined by senior pastor at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church Eddie Long, who said in a written statement that the march was not \\"to protest same-sex marriage, but to present a unified version of righteousness and justice.\\" At the time of the march, King said she had become a \\"spiritual daughter\\" of Eddie Long and the issue of same-sex marriage legalization had left many divided. \\"The question is, how do you overcome that pain?\\" she said. \\"It may be the wedge that stays with us for a long time. We have to get to a place where it does not become the most defining issue of our time.\\" She incorporated the King Center and the eternal flame at her father's tomb into the march. The King Center denied her permission to begin the march at her father's tomb and accused her of doing so to \\"provide support for her own personal cause\\" and \\"to enhance her personal standing in New Birth.\\" The event was also criticized by gay rights organizations, which stated it betrayed the legacy of her father. Chuck Bowen, a spokesman for Georgia Equality, stated that he was surprised to learn of the march. \\"I think it's very sad,\\" Bowen said. \\"I think she's abusing the good name of Dr. King and the work he did creating equality for all Americans.\\" Deaths of mother and sister and King Center sale King's mother, Coretta Scott King, had a stroke in August 2005. She died on January 30, 2006. King delivered the eulogy at her funeral. King called her mother's death a \\"major turning point.\\" She felt that her mother's death was a \\"rebirth\\" for her, \\"in terms of understanding that I come from roots of greatness and I am called to greatness and there's nothing I can do but try to be my best self.\\" On October 24, 2005, Rosa Parks died of natural causes. Her funeral took place on November 2, 2005. Bernice King attended the funeral and delivered remarks on behalf of her mother. Bernice was the only one of the four King children to be with Coretta Scott King when she died and learned that her mother's remains could not be transported back to Georgia, since Mexican authorities required an autopsy first.Farris, p. 185. In the months between her stroke and death, Bernice and her brother Martin Luther King III vowed to fight the sale of the King Center to the National Park Service. The siblings were put against their brother Dexter and sister Yolanda, who supported and voted in favor of the sale in early December 2005. On December 30, 2005, King and her brother Martin stated that their priority was to preserve their \\"father's legacy and their mother's dream.\\" Bernice stated of her mother's opinion on the sale that \\"She felt at some point that it may, in fact, end up with the government, but she never envisioned that in her lifetime.\\" Andrew Young said transferring power would allow the family to focus more on Martin Luther King's message of nonviolence and less on maintaining the grounds. Bernice King said government ownership, which would befall the King Center if it were sold to the National Park Service, would result in \\"a loss of ideological independence.\\" Martin Luther King III stated that Bernice had been removed as secretary and that he had been replaced as chairman by their brother Dexter. 16 months later, on May 15, 2007, King's sister Yolanda King died after collapsing and was unable to be revived. King delivered the eulogy at her sister's memorial on May 24, 2007. During Yolanda King's eulogy, King admitted that her death was even more difficult than her mother's and said her sister often addressed her as her \\"one and only sister.\\" She added, \\"It's very difficult standing here blessed as her one and only sister. Yolanda, from your one and only, I thank you for being a sister and for being a friend.\\" She joined her brothers in lighting candles in their sister's memory. Southern Christian Leadership Conference With her brother Martin Luther King III, she has played an active part in reforming the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) once led by her father. When she was elected President and CEO of SCLC on October 30, 2009, a position previously held by both her father and brother, she became the first woman to lead the group, but discord in the organization has prevented her taking that position. King's election was won by a 23-to-15 vote, allowing her to defeat Arkansas judge, Wendell Griffen. Specialists said King would need to move beyond her family history when she took the position the following year. Andra Gillespie, a professor at Emory University in Atlanta, said King could hark back to her father's legacy, but that she was going to have to \\"redefine\\" it. Gillespie also stated that King would have to \\"figure out a way to push that legacy forward so we don't perpetuate a stagnant, chauvinistic civil rights agenda.\\" Despite her excitement being \\"high\\", King noticed the SCLC's board of directors had started \\"ignoring\\" suggestions she made to \\"revitalize\\" the organization. King said that she had made suggestions to the SCLC about how the presidency might operate in October 2010, but was not contacted formally until January, three months later. She stated that she felt \\"disrespect\\" by the three months in between her suggestions to the organization and their response. Despite this, she said that she would continue to \\"pray for them to move in a positive direction\\". On October 1, 2010, she led a prayer to an audience of around 200 people that had come to pray for healing and reconciliation of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Through prayer, King said, they would \\"seek to destroy the work of the enemy.\\" King called the SCLC preparing to hold two separate conventions \\"an unfortunate turn of events.\\" In January 2011, three months after making the plea, she declined to be SCLC's president. While in Birmingham, Alabama on August 11, 2014 for the national convention of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, King endorsed having the 2016 Democratic National Convention be held in Birmingham, reasoning the \\"golden anniversary of civil rights events throughout the south and Birmingham in particular offers added significance\\" to it being held there. Legal issues King and her brother Martin Luther King III accused their brother Dexter of having disengaged them from decisions and shareholder meetings. They alleged that their brother had done this since 2004. On October 12, 2009, the dispute was settled out of court. The King siblings spent the entire day of October 12 locked away. The purpose of the lockdown was for the three to settle on a deal. Following the completing of their meeting, Bernice and her brother Martin said outside the Fulton County Courthouse that the results of the settlement seemed positive. Book deal Bernice King and Martin also opposed the giving up of photographs, personal letters and papers of their mother to a biographer. Their brother Dexter asked a judge to force them to comply. The biographer, Ms. Reynolds, met Coretta Scott King in 1972 and said that the widow had asked for her to write a follow up to her 1969 memoir. King and her brother's lawyer stated that their mother had changed her mind about the biography citing Mrs. King's apparent disapproval of Reynolds's writing style. A judge ordered the Kings to appear in court on October 14, 2008. David J. Garrow, biographer of King's father, said that it was \\"sad and pathetic to see the three of them behaving in this self-destructive way.‚Äù By September 2009, the book deal was defunct and a judge ordered the three siblings to have a meeting. On September 14, King and her brother Martin sat through court motions, testimony and proceedings for more than 13 hours. In a separate hearing, Dexter Scott King's attorney Lin Wood argued that Bernice King willingly ignored a court order. He reasoned this because Bernice did not reveal the contents of the safe deposit box. Wood also said King's brother Martin and one of Bernice's lawyers, who was no longer on the case, was aware of the letters and refused to reveal them. Bernice's attorney Charles Mathis said she \\"did not conceal anything\\" and said \\"She thought she was doing what she was supposed to do when she told her first lawyer. There was not an intentional failure to disclose.\\" The next day, Dexter Scott King's lawyers contended that Bernice was legally compelled to turn the letters over to Dexter, but ignored the order. Dexter's attorney Wood said \\"Regardless of what your last name is, if you have willfully withheld then you must suffer the consequences.\\" Wood noted that Bernice denied the existence of the safety deposit box several times while under oath, which she said she found after the death of her sister Yolanda, who once owned it. Mishandling of memorabilia On August 28, 2013, the fiftieth anniversary of the March on Washington, the King estate filed a lawsuit against the King Center alleging that it had been careless with its handling of Martin Luther King, Jr. memorabilia. The lawsuit also claimed that attempts to resolve the issue with King Center CEO Bernice King have failed and that there had been a \\"total breakdown in communication and transparency.\\" The King estate sent a 30-day notice to the Center on August 10, 2013. It notified the center that the licensing agreement for the King memorabilia was being terminated and that the center could avoid this by placing Bernice King on administrative leave and pulling Andrew Young and Alveda King from the board. According to the estate, Alveda King tried to \\"impede\\" the audit. The estate sought a court order barring the center from using the memorabilia after the license expired. Bernice King announced in a statement on January 22, 2015 that the estate of her father, run by her brothers, had voluntarily dropped the lawsuit. She said the King Center's positions on its legal rights were vindicated by the estate's dropping of the lawsuit and that the action was a sign that the siblings' feud was on the road to reconciliation. Belafonte documents Harry Belafonte filed a lawsuit in October 2013, where he asked to be declared the owner of three documents given to him by the Kings and for their daughter Bernice King to be barred permanently from trying to claim ownership. The documents are Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \\"Casualties of the War in Vietnam\\", which Belafonte stated he had been in possession of since 1967, the undelivered \\"Memphis Speech\\" found in Martin Luther King's pocket after his assassination and a letter of condolence sent by President Lyndon B. Johnson to the then-newly widowed Coretta Scott King. The King estate and Bernice King disputed Belafonte's ownership of the documents when in 2008, he took the items to Sotheby's auction house in New York to be appraised and put up for sale. On April 11, 2014, Belafonte and the King estate said in a joint statement that a confidential compromise \\"resulted in Mr. Belafonte retaining possession of the documents.\\" Bible and Nobel Peace Prize family dispute King's brothers Martin Luther King III and Dexter Scott King are interested in selling their father's Nobel Peace Prize and his Bible, which was later used by Barack Obama during his second presidential inauguration in 2013. Her brothers filed a lawsuit against her, complaining that she had \\"secreted and sequestered\\" the two items of interest in violation of a 1995 agreement that gives the brothers sole control of all of their father's property. King said in her defense, \\"I take this strong position for my father because Daddy is not here to say himself my Bible and medals are never to be sold.\\" Martin Luther King III was reported to have sent her, on January 20, 2014, the year's Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, a letter requesting a meeting to \\"discuss and vote on whether to offer for purchase at a private sale the Nobel Peace Prize and the King Bible.‚Äù On January 22, 2014, Dexter Scott and Martin Luther King III voted as board members of the King estate to pursue the sale of their father's award and Bible. The items had been in Bernice's care since the death of their mother, Coretta Scott King, in 2006. Bernice's position had support by members of the civil rights community, including C. T. Vivian, Andrew Young, and Joseph Lowery. King's cousin, Alveda King, was also supportive of Bernice. She said, \\"I am standing with her because I do believe we can't have a sale to the highest bidder with those family heirlooms.\\" On February 4, 2014, Bernice King stated that she would protest the sale of her father's Bible and Nobel Peace Prize and as a result, oppose her brothers. She said profiting from the Nobel Peace Prize's sale would be \\"spiritually violent\\" and \\"outright morally reprehensible.\\" On February 6, 2014, King asked in a press conference in Ebenezer Baptist Church for the media to ‚Äúrefrain from grouping me with my brothers.‚Äù On February 19, 2014, a judge ordered her to give up the items, and had them kept temporarily in a safe deposit box under the name of the King estate. The judge will remain in possession of the key until the matter is settled. The judge compared King's stance against the sale of her father's Bible and Nobel Peace Prize to Coca-Cola not wanting to sell its recipe, and later noted that he was not trying to trivialize the value of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s possessions by making the comparison. While King said that people had urged her to retain the Bible and Nobel Peace Prize and go to prison instead, she complied with the judge's order. On March 6, 2014, she asked her brothers to hold another vote and said she hoped one of them would change his mind. Despite facing an estrangement from her brothers, she hoped that she would be able to reconcile with them on the matter and said she is open to an out-of-court settlement. She appealed to anyone who would consider purchasing the bible and Nobel Peace Prize should they be put on sale to take the moral high road by leaving the \\"sacred in its sacred state.\\" While she was given a deadline of turning them over by March 3, it was extended another five days, according to one of Bernice's lawyers. King said that she would never support her brothers in selling the Nobel Peace Prize and Bible. She said that if her father was alive, he would say, \\"my Bible and my medal are never to be sold, not to an institution or even a person.‚Äù On March 10, 2014, King turned over the Nobel Peace Prize and Bible to Martin Luther King III for placement in a safety deposit box in a meeting that lasted five minutes. A lawyer involved in the dispute said few words were exchanged while Bernice surrendered the items. Eric Barnum, an attorney of Bernice King, said that his client \\"complied with the court order.\\" On March 14, 2014, Ron Gaither, one of Bernice King's lawyers, argued that William Hill, lawyer of Martin Luther King III and Dexter King, should not have any role in the case because of his involvement in the 2008 dispute between the King children. A judge appointed Hill as Special Master in 2008. Lawyers of Bernice King in a court hearing said that \\"Hill played a vital and substantial role in adjudicating a multitude of disputes that arose between the parties.\\" The lawyers argued that this gave Hill an advantage while putting Bernice at a disadvantage. Hill's defense of himself was that he only had access to documents related to Coretta Scott King's estate and that Bernice King's lawyers were using a stalling tactic by trying to disqualify him. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney stated that he would soon issue a ruling on whether Hill would be disqualified. McBurney granted Bernice King's lawyers request and disqualified Hill. A full hearing is scheduled to take place in late September. Honors and awards On December 14, 2007, at the State Bar of Georgia Headquarters, King was honored by the Georgia Alliance of African American Attorneys with the \\"Commitment to Community\\" award for her work as an attorney and community leader. On October 7, 2009, King received an award for her \\"lifetime of service to women and other causes\\" at the National Coalition of 100 Black Women Convention.\\"Rev. Bernice King What Really Makes a Woman Beautiful\\". YouTube. October 12, 2009. Retrieved April 21, 2014. On November 7, 2013, as part of the \\"Celebrating the Dream‚Äù, in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the I Have a Dream speech done by her father, King received the Legend Award as a tribute to his legacy and after she delivered a speech. Ebony magazine named her one of their Ten of Tomorrow future leaders of the black community. Views=Gay rights In 2005, she led a march to her father's gravesite and at the same time called out for a constitutional ban on gay marriage. She once said to LGBT supporters that her father did not take a bullet for same-sex marriage. During Atlanta's 2012 Martin Luther King Jr. Day rally, King included LGBT people among the various groups who needed to come together to \\"fulfill her father‚Äôs legacy.\\" When speaking at Brown University in 2013, King made statements regarding her beliefs about the origins of marriage: \\"I believe that the family was created and ordained first and foremost by God, that he instituted the marriage, and that's a law that he instituted and not... that we instituted\\" and about the origins of same-sex attraction: \\"I also don't believe everybody's born that way. I know some people have been violated. I know some people have unfortunately delved into it as an experiment\\". King has publicly stated that her father would have been against gay marriage. Her statement was in contradiction of her mother, Coretta Scott King, who was an avid supporter of the LGBT community and publicly stated her husband would have been also.https://www.huffpost.com/entry/coretta-scott-king_b_2592049 However, by 2015, it appeared she had changed her stance on the matter, as she issued a press release as CEO of the King Center supporting the Supreme Court's Same- Sex Marriage ruling. Abortion King is opposed to abortion. She believes that life begins and should be protected by law at conception. On August 22, 2013, King expressed her belief that \\"life begins in a woman‚Äôs womb.‚Äù References=Works cited  External links * * Bernice A.

WNYL broadcasts an alternative rock format branded as Alt 92.3, with studios located in the Hudson Square neighborhood in Manhattan and transmitter located at the Empire State Building. The station was the flagship of The Howard Stern Show from November 1985 to December 2005, and The Opie and Anthony Show from April 2006 until March 2009. WNYL also broadcasts in HD Radio. History=Early years (1948‚Äì1975) The station, first went on the air on December 25, 1948 as WMCA-FM. The station was co-owned with WMCA (570 AM) by former New York state senator Nathan Straus Jr.. FM radio was not a successful venture for Straus, and he decided to either sell the FM station or close it down altogether. In late 1950, Straus sold the station to the owners of WHOM radio (1480 AM) and WHOM-FM went on the air on February 26, 1951, featuring a variety of formats, including ethnic, background music, classical, Spanish, and easy listening. By the early 1970s, WHOM-FM had a Spanish-language easy listening format. WKTU (1975‚Äì1985)Mellow 92/Disco 92= WHOM and WHOM-FM, in the early 1970s, were sold to SJR Communications. On June 5, 1975, WHOM-FM became WKTU, taking on an Adult Contemporary format and was positioned as \\"soft rock\\". They were known as \\"Mellow 92\\". They played current AC songs that crossed over to Top 40 as well as a mix of music from 1964 forward. Core artists included Eagles, Stevie Wonder, Elton John, James Taylor, Paul Simon, Stylistics, Linda Ronstadt, Four Tops, Carly Simon, Barry Manilow, and some more contemporary cuts by Barbra Streisand. For 1960s music the station played softer Beatles songs, Mamas and Papas, Spanky and Our Gang, Association, Fifth Dimension, among others. The station steered clear of AC only songs and standards vocalists as well as hard rock or uptempo R & B. Eventually the station evolved, re-positioned as mellow rock, dropped artists like the Carpenters, most R & B product, and added some softer songs from AOR artists. Unlike today's Adult contemporary music formats, WKTU, by early 1978, was only playing artists heard on Album-oriented rock stations, using the softer songs from their popular albums. Artists found primarily on Top 40 stations were no longer included. WKTU was still called \\"Mellow 92\\" at that point. Ratings were relatively low. The \\"Mellow 92\\" format continued until June 1978. Meanwhile, station executive David Rapaport (father of actor Michael Rapaport) visited New York's Studio 54 discoth√®que on half a dozen occasions, and was very impressed with the crowds there. He got the idea that a disco-based station was needed, as several FM-based Top 40 stations were leaning disco in other markets, although no one was airing all disco music around the clock. As a result, Rapaport purchased 200 disco records and brought them into the station. WKTU abruptly flipped to a disco-based rhythmic top 40 format with the tagline \\"Disco 92\\" at 6 p.m. on July 24, 1978. The same disc jockeys from the mellow format were at first kept on, with Paco from Spanish language sister station 1480 WJIT added for afternoons. That fall, the station rose from \\"Worst to First\\", unseating long-time leader 770 WABC in the 18‚àí30 age demographic. Air personalities of this era included Kenn Hayes, Randy Place, Paul Robinson, Trip Reeb, Mary Thomas, Dave Mallow and Joe Guarisco. During the height of the disco craze, WKTU was the station to follow in New York. Initially, WKTU played mostly dance/disco and a few rhythm-friendly pop and rock songs (such as \\"Miss You\\" by the Rolling Stones for example), but by 1979, the station began to add more R&B; music (though they played some at the launch in 78 as well) as well as rhythm friendly new wave rock. By then, WKTU was still regarded as a disco station, but could be more accurately described as rhythmic contemporary hit radio. Since that term was not yet used, the station had been classified as urban contemporary. During this period, the disc jockeys included Paco, G. Keith Alexander, Rosko, J.D. Holiday (Paul Zarcone), Dale Reeves, Bob Bottone, Jim Harlan, Carlos DeJesus, Joe Causi, Guy Broady, Jay Thomas, Freddie Colon, Don Geronimo, Al Bandiero and Diane Pryor. Paco later went to jail for drug dealing. =92KTU (1981‚Äì1985)= In 1981, SJR Communications sold WKTU to Infinity Broadcasting (which merged with CBS Radio in 1997). Also that year, WKTU added more dance-based new wave to the format. WKTU remained among the top ten New York City radio stations through 1983. Shortly thereafter, WKTU received new competition from WHTZ and WPLJ, both of which adapted a CHR format. The station maintained respectable but declining ratings, due to the new competition. By mid-1984, WKTU moved to a mainstream CHR format as well, giving up its disco past, but the ratings continued to decline. That fall, the station added legendary WABC host Dan Ingram to afternoons, and Jo Maeder, \\"The Madame\\", from Miami's Y-100, joined Jay Thomas in the morning and did her own midday show, but the station continued to struggle in the ratings. To make matters worse, then-named 103.5 WAPP also went CHR that fall. So strong was the memory of the late-1970s WKTU that despite all the subsequent on-air changes, the general public still regarded it as a disco station. Even though WAPP moved back to playing mostly rock music in the form of a rock-based CHR in June 1985, giving WKTU one less competitor, the station management thought a more drastic change was needed. Since New York City only had one full-time rock station with WNEW-FM, there was an opportunity. WXRK (1985‚Äì2005)92.3 K-Rock= On July 13, 1985, at midnight, on the same day WKTU aired the historic Live Aid concert, the station switched to an album-oriented rock format, adopted the moniker \\"K-Rock\\", and changed their call letters to WXRK. (The WKTU call letters later reappeared on New York City's 103.5 FM with a dance pop format in 1996). Initially, the format at WXRK was similar to the pre-1983 WPLJ, as the air personalities left the station gradually in the next several months (exceptions were Maria Malito and Jo Maeder, who became known as \\"The Rock and Roll Madame\\"). Jimmy Fink from WPLJ was one of the first new radio personalities to be hired. After being fired from WNBC in October 1985, Howard Stern signed on to do afternoons, and initially combined music with talk, but on February 18, 1986, Stern took over the morning slot. His morning show became the highest-rated in the market, dethroning Don Imus, who previously had the highest-rated morning show for several years on 660 WNBC. Later that year Stern's show became syndicated, with WXRK as its flagship station. By 1987, Stern stopped playing music on his show altogether, while the station changed to a classic rock format on June 5 of that same year. The airstaff, which included Flo & Eddie from classic rock band The Turtles, became full of veterans from other New York rock stations, including Dave Herman, Pete Fornatale, Meg Griffin, Vin Scelsa, and Alison Steele from WNEW-FM, along with Jimmy Fink, Tony Pigg, Marc Coppola, and John Zacherle from WPLJ. In 1993, The Greaseman's syndicated show was put in the nighttime slot, bookending Stern with an act that was often quite controversial. By the mid-1990s, modern rock had become popular. In mid-1993, in New York City radio, WHTZ began to play a lot of modern rock despite primarily being a CHR station. Late in 1993, Classical music station WNCN switched formats and became WAXQ (\\"Q 104.3\\"), with a mix of hard and modern rock. Moreover, WNEW-FM switched to a modern rock format in the summer of 1995, and later evolved to first an adult-based modern rock format by the end of that year, and then to a more eclectic adult rock mix by 1996. Nevertheless, by the beginning of 1996, there was no full- time modern rock station in New York City. To fill the void, WXRK switched to an alternative leaning active rock format on January 5, 1996, right after Stern's show. To kick off the new format, which he enthusiastically endorsed as a better fit for his audience, Stern stayed on the air until 1:06 p.m. that day playing music. The first song Stern played was Marilyn Manson's cover of \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\\". WXRK's Format Change to Modern Rock - 1/5/96 Most of the classic rock DJs, including Jimmy Fink, Tony Pigg and Marc Coppola, disappeared from the station with this change, as did The Greaseman. By August 1997, the station added more music that suited an active rock station and removed pop leaning alternative product (which they played very little of anyway), and it continued this format of a hybrid active rock/alternative for several years. By 2003, with a new program director, the station dropped the active rock variant of music. No matter what the format, the longtime problem for the station was that while Stern always had very high ratings, the rest of the station did not fare as well. Moreover, it was hard to classify K-Rock an alternative station (considering classic rock acts like Led Zeppelin were being played), while it was hard to label it as active rock due to the inclusion of some, but not all, alternative artists. Concerned about Stern's move to Sirius Satellite Radio at the beginning of 2006, and acknowledging that its target audience was looking elsewhere for modern rock music, WXRK made another format adjustment on April 4, 2005 to a mainstream rock format, which relied heavily on classic rock from artists such as Guns N' Roses, Metallica, The Smashing Pumpkins, and Nirvana, while playing new music from such established artists as System of a Down, Nine Inch Nails, Green Day and Weezer. At this time, New York City was one of the few large cities in the United States without an alternative rock station. To prevent any backlash from fans of modern rock, an Internet-only radio station called \\"K-Rock2\\" was launched at the same time as the format adjustment. The strategy did not work, as ratings did not improve much. As a result of the imminent departure of Howard Stern to Sirius Satellite Radio, an announcement was made on October 25, 2005 that the station would adopt a Hot talk format on January 3, 2006. At 10 a.m. on Friday, December 16, after the last terrestrial Howard Stern show, K-Rock began a 20-minute stunt with a melange of audio sound bites, music and program line-up announcements. At 10:20, K-Rock DJ Julie Slater announced \\"Welcome to Free FM\\", and went into music. WFNY-FM (2006‚Äì2007)92.3 Free-FM= The WXRK call letters were replaced by WFNY-FM (standing for \\"Free New York\\") on January 1, 2006, with the official \\"Free FM\\" launch two days later at 6 a.m. The station, which was one of several CBS Radio stations around the nation branded as \\"Free FM\\", featured rock singer David Lee Roth as its morning show host. Other talk shows from hosts such as The Dog House with JV & Elvis, Penn Jillette, Leslie Gold, Chris Booker, and Jake Fogelnest & Jackie Clarke aired weekdays, while an active rock music format continued to be played on the weekends, called \\"Free Rock Weekends. Simultaneously, the WXRK call sign moved to the former WXTM in Cleveland, also owned by CBS Radio, and coincidentally at the same 92.3 frequency, and was rebranded as 92.3 K-Rock. WFNY's ratings plummeted with the change to an all-talk format. As the replacement for Howard Stern, Roth lost nearly three-quarters of Howard Stern's previous audience, dropping a 7.9 share to a 1.8. Among the core audience‚Äî18- to 34-year-old men‚Äîthe numbers fell from 13.8 to 1.3. Overall station ratings went from 3.2 in Summer/Fall of 2005 to 2.7 in Winter of 2006, and later to a 2.0, leaving it in 20th place in the New York market. On April 25, 2006, Chris Booker, host of The Booker Show, announced that he was broadcasting his last show on Free FM. He soon moved over the morning show at Q102 in Philadelphia. The abrupt end of his show, which had evolved on afternoon drive before the format switch, led the station to revert to \\"Free Rock\\" music at nights. The following day, on April 26, 2006, Opie and Anthony replaced David Lee Roth in morning drive on Free FM, while simulcasting on XM Satellite Radio. The show aired from 6‚Äì9 am on both terrestrial and satellite radio, then continued on XM exclusively to 11 am. By spring 2007, Opie and Anthony managed to slightly improve WFNY-FM's ratings to a 1.4. However, this performance left the radio station ranked #22 of 25 in the NY market.FMQB: Radio Industry News, Music Industry Updates, Arbitron Ratings, Music News and more! Weekends continued to use the \\"Free Rock Weekend\\" format, which included hour-long \\"Freecasts\\" in which a single listener chose the (approximately 15) songs played during the hour. The listener also acted as guest DJ over the phone during the time. The station was also used as a secondary broadcaster of sister station WFAN, serving as a secondary outlet for NFL football games, New Jersey Devils hockey games and New Jersey Nets basketball games when there was a conflict with another game on WFAN. After Jim Cramer's Real Money went off the air on in December 2006, WFNY-FM was left with just 4 talk shows (one from syndication). As a result, the station attempted to revamp its lineup with the addition of several new talk shows, the first of which occurred on December 20, 2006. Ron and Fez, who also have a show on XM radio, signed an agreement to broadcast a 92.3 Free FM-exclusive radio show from 6pm to 9pm. Ron and Fez had previously been employed by CBS at WNEW-FM shortly after that station switched to FM Talk in 1999. Additional new shows soon followed. On December 28, 2006, John and Jeff started being broadcast from syndication out of sister station 97.1 Free FM in Los Angeles. They broadcast live 2‚Äì6 am. On January 2, 2007, Larry Wachs, who was half of The Regular Guys morning show on WKLS-FM in Atlanta, began hosting the 10pm to midnight slot on the station for 2 weeks. That same day, Nick DiPaolo became host of the 12pm to 3pm time slot. He had done some preview shows the previous week. Beginning January 3, Loveline with Dr. Drew Pinsky & Stryker aired Late Nights, tape delayed, from 12am to 2am. Danni was Free FM's Music Director and was still a Free Rock disc jockey. She has been heard doing DJ shifts on co-owned Fresh 102.7 as well. Free Rock Weekends aired 6am Saturday ‚Äì 12am Sunday, and 6am Sunday ‚Äì 2am Monday. Game Show Radio ran 12‚Äì2am on Sundays, while infomercials ran 2am‚Äì6am Sunday. Free FM was using guest hosts for the 10pm to 12am time slot. March 2, 2007 was the last day for the Penn Jillette show on Free FM and CBS Radio stations. The following Monday, WFNY-FM expanded the guest host time slot by an hour, making it 9pm to 12am. In April 2007, during an interview with a local band \\"A Brief Smile\\" on The Dog House, the hosts JV and Elvis directed numerous homophobic insults at the band's bassist. The hosts referred to the bassist as \\"Fag Number 1\\" and asked, \\"How many badges of honor do you have in your colon?\\" and kicked him out of the studio. After playing a song by the band the hosts also called the bass part \\"a little faggy.\\" The bass player returned to the studio, stated he was bisexual and that he found their use of the word \\"faggot\\" offensive. Gay rights groups such as GLAAD criticized the show as being homophobic for their remarks. JV and Elvis were later suspended on April 30 over a six-minute prank phone call peppered with ethnic and sexual slurs to a Chinese restaurant, after numerous Chinese American advocacy groups complained to CBS demanding the hosts be fired. Beginning on May 7, Free-FM started using guest hosts 9 am to 12 pm to replace The Dog House. On May 12, 2007, AP News reported that CBS Radio spokeswoman Karen Mateo said, \\"The Dog House with JV and Elvis will no longer be broadcast [on Free-FM].\\" CBS fired the co-hosts JV and Elvis, as well as the producer of The Dog House after numerous complaints received from various civil rights groups. On May 15, 2007, XM Satellite Radio suspended the Opie and Anthony Show for 30 days because of comments made by a homeless man about raping Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and First Lady Laura Bush made on an uncensored May 9 broadcast. Their suspension was effective immediately. During this time, CBS Radio kept the show on from 6 to 9am. However, it was not simulcast on XM. Re-launch for WXRK (2007‚Äì2009)K-Rock returns= At 9 a.m. on May 24, 2007, after Opie and Anthony, an eight-hour countdown clock began on the former \\"Free FM\\" website and a sound collage was broadcast for most of the day. The stunting came to an end at 4:57 p.m. with an apology from general manager Tom Chiusano, who apologized to listeners for taking K-Rock away. Minutes later, at 5 p.m., the station returned to the air as K-Rock, playing an alternative rock format with a playlist focused on rock from the 1990s and 2000s, along with heavy classic rock. The first song on the resurrected K-Rock was \\"All Apologies\\" by Nirvana, while the first host on air was Gregg \\"Opie\\" Hughes of Opie and Anthony, who confirmed that O&A; would still be on the station under its new format. The station reverted to its previous call letters, WXRK, on May 31, 2007. The previous WXRK (92.3 K-Rock in Cleveland, also owned by CBS Radio) received the callsign WKRI. The Cleveland station is now WKRK-FM. Initially, WXRK had no on-air staff, although on Mondays it featured a Hostile Takeover show where guest(s) sat in as the DJ. The station also had contests which begun after Opie and Anthony. On February 8, 2008, it was announced that program director Tracy Cloherty was among the many non-programming staffers let go by CBS Radio, in an attempt to \\"more effectively monetize the aggregate number of listeners who hear us on the radio and the Internet.\\" The advent of WRXP caused WXRK to morph to active rock at that time. In December 2008, as a result of another change in the station's management, K-Rock made an adjustment to a mainstream rock format focusing more on classic rock and playing even less current rock songs. With the format adjustment, Paul Turner, who was the voice of the Howard Stern Show and K-Rock when it was a classic rock station in the 1990s, returned as voice of the station's promos. As a result of the format shift, on December 16, 2008, FMQB announced that afternoon jock Ian Camfield had left K-Rock to go back to XFM in London. K-Rock vet Chris Booker took his place, airing in afternoon drive from 2‚àí7 pm. Due to low ratings, the final terrestrial airing of Opie and Anthony show aired on March 9, 2009. 92.3 Now (2009‚Äì2014) At 4:45 p.m. on March 11, 2009, after playing \\"Right Now\\" by Van Halen, WXRK began stunting with the sound of a ticking clock. At 4:55 p.m., the station announced that K-Rock was moving to 92.3 HD2, and after an introductory package, officially flipped to a rhythmic-leaning CHR format, branded as \\"92.3 Now\\". The first song on \\"Now\\" was \\"Boom Boom Pow\\" by The Black Eyed Peas. By July 2012, major directional changes were made with a shift to a more mainstream Top 40 format. The station also added Ty Bentli for mornings. This would eventually become known as \\"Ty Loves NY.\\" On November 8, 2012, a full 3 1/2 years after Now's debut, the station changed call letters to WNOW-FM to match their moniker. This was made possible by a format and call-letter change at the former WNOW-FM in Gaffney, South Carolina. =Tic Tak stunt= On December 17, 2010, WXRK afternoon host Mark \\"Tic Tak\\" Allen pulled an on-air tirade in which he dissed the music director (while he was in West Virginia, on vacation) and went against playing the usual Top 40 songs, including \\"slamming\\" Katy Perry singles, by declaring that \\"I'm playing what I want... this is my Christmas present to you\\" and started mixing in certain songs that do not fit WXRK's current format. Allen was hoping that station management would fire him, but from the comments from message boards like Radio-Info, this \\"event\\" was either staged or a poor ratings ploy to attract more listeners, since Allen has been known to pull successful stunts at other stations that he had worked at in the past.From Radio-Info New York City Message Board =Howard Stern returns= On January 17, 2012, Howard Stern made a live appearance on WXRK for the first time in over six years. Stern was a guest on the Nick Cannon morning show, via telephone, at the same time as Cannon was guesting on Stern's SiriusXM Satellite Radio show.Nick Cannon to Howard Stern: You‚Äôre going to work you‚Äôre butt off on ‚ÄòAmerica's Got Talent' =Hurricane Sandy= As a result of damage suffered to WINS' transmitter during Hurricane Sandy, WINS was being broadcast on 92.3. Although its transmitters were restored, WINS' transmitters were on low power for at least a day. The simulcast ended at 10 a.m. on October 31, 2012, when WINS' transmitter went back to full power. 92.3 AMP Radio (2014‚Äì2017) 150px Following the station's flip in 2009, WXRK/WNOW held only a 2 share as compared to WHTZ, which usually has a 7 share of the market. In addition, WXRK/WNOW had a constant turnover of program directors and airstaff, including the sudden releasing of all the then-current airstaff (with the exception of midday host Niko and evening host Toro) on May 21, 2014, as rumors of a complete rehauling of 92.3's format abounded. The following day at 2 p.m., after stunting by giving away $1,000 to callers every 9 minutes for 2 hours, WNOW-FM relaunched as 92.3 AMP Radio under veteran PD Rick Thomas, launching with commercial-free weekends until Labor Day weekend. The final song on \\"Now\\" was \\"Lose Yourself\\" by Eminem, while the first song on \\"AMP\\" was \\"Summer\\" by Calvin Harris. On June 23, 2014, WNOW-FM changed its call letters to WBMP to match the \\"AMP\\" branding (unlike Los Angeles sister station KAMP-FM, the WAMP call letters are held by an American Family Radio religious talk radio station in Jackson, Tennessee, and the network's conservative foundational owner was unlikely to give them to a commercial operation). Concurrently, the WNOW-FM call letters were transferred to WNOU in Indianapolis, Indiana. After the rebrand, the station's ratings improved significantly. On January 22, 2015, WBMP launched a new morning show titled Shoboy in the Morning with Edgar \\"Shoboy\\" Sotelo, Micho Rizzo (both of whom were once part of sister station KMVK in Dallas) and Nina Hajian from then- sister station KZZO in Sacramento. WBMP Launches 'Shoboy in the Morning' Alt 92.3 (2017‚Äìpresent) On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. CBS Radio to Merge with Entercom The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was completed on November 17.Entercom Receives FCC Approval for Merger with CBS Radio Entercom Completes CBS Radio Merger On that day, at 10 a.m., after playing \\"Too Good at Goodbyes\\" by Sam Smith and \\"Encore\\" by Brooklyn native Jay-Z, WBMP flipped back to alternative as Alt 92.3, launching with \\"My Hero\\" by the Foo Fighters. The switch marked the return of the format to the market for the first time since 2012, when WRXP switched to a simulcast of WFAN as WFAN-FM after its sale to CBS. A sister \\"AMP\\" station in Dallas, KVIL, also flipped to alternative with a similar brand the same day. On June 12, 2018, the call letters were changed to WNYL to match their format. On September 13, 2020, WNYL became a superstation and began simulcasting on several of Entercom's other alternative stations across the United States.Entercom Sets Programming Plans for Alternative & CountryEntercom Rebrands Alternative Stations in Buffalo, Kansas City, Las Vegas & Richmond \\"K-Rock2\\" and HD radio operations As part of the K-Rock format change on April 4, 2005 from alternative rock to mainstream rock, K-Rock2, a new Internet-only radio station, was created. Throughout the Free FM period and during the resurrection of K-Rock, K-Rock2 continued to stream on krock2.com. Following the main channel's format change to \\"Now\\" on March 11, 2009, the HD2 channel became known as simply \\"K-Rock\\", but retained the alternative rock format. K-Rock HD2, at one point had a full-time air staff, including a local music show, but later ran completely automated. Starting shortly after 2 a.m. on October 6, 2008, the K-Rock2 audio stream was added to WXRK-HD2. A few minutes earlier, a simulcast of sister station WFAN was added to WXRK HD3. 92.3-HD3 was initially using the delayed audio feed from wfan.com complete with internet only commercials and not the over the air broadcast feed used by WFAN on 660 AM. After a day or so, WXRK HD3 switched to the over the air feed of WFAN, but still had a time delay of over a minute. The HD3 was dropped altogether when WFAN began simulcasting on 101.9 FM on November 2, 2012. In December 2015, WBMP added Radio Disney to HD3 under a time brokerage agreement,National Stations (Family) - HD Radio making the return of the radio network to New York since Radio Disney's owned-and-operated WQEW (now WFME) was sold to Family Radio in February of that year (which would be discontinued in February 2018 after the agreement between Disney and Entercom, which inherited the agreement from CBS, expired). After the analog/HD1 channel's flip back to alternative in November 2017, the HD2 channel changed to a simulcast of sister station WNEW-FM. As of October 2018, WNYL's HD2 channel flipped to New Alternative as \\"New Arrivals\\". In February 2019, WNYL launched an LGBTQ-centric talk/dance format on its reactivated HD3 subchannel, branded as \\"Channel Q\\".Channel Q Expands to Six More Markets Radioinsight - February 26, 2019 See also * WKTU: the \\"new\\" WKTU started in 1996 on 103.5 MHz.

Slabs of salt from the mines of Taoudenni stacked on the quayside at the port of Mopti (Mali) Rock salt at the market in Mopti. It is sold here in slabs, broken and weighed, and packaged into smaller amounts. The Azalai (Tamasheq, var. Azalay) is a semi-annual salt caravan route practiced by Tuareg traders in the Sahara desert between Timbuktu and the Taoudenni salt mine in Mali,Mali - Azalai - URL retrieved July 6, 2008 or the act of traveling with a caravan along that route. The other major West African salt caravan route, heading from around Agadez to Fachi and Bilma in Niger, is called Taghlamt (in Tamasheq, or Taglem or Tagalem in Hausa language). The two are among the last caravan routes in the Sahara that are still in use. Both caravans have largely been replaced by unpaved truck routes.  Timbuktu-Taoudenni  At one time the caravan route from Timbuktu extended through Taoudenni to Taghaza, another salt-mining site, and on to the lands north of the Sahara on the Mediterranean Sea. Caravans with up to 10,000 camels carried gold and slaves north, returning with manufactured goods and salt from Taghaza and Taoudenni. Until the 1940s, the Taoudenni caravans were made up of thousands of camels, departing Timbuktu at the beginning of the cool season in November, with a smaller caravan departing Timbuktu at the beginning of the hot season in March. After the Azalai reaches Timbuktu, the rock salt it is taken by boat to Mopti and further on to other Sahel and Sudanian markets.  Agadez-Bilma  beza (front) and kantu salt in Fachi The Agadez-Bilma route, passing through the T√©n√©r√© desert and the oasis town of Fachi, takes around three weeks to complete (both ways). It is traditionally a twice yearly caravan from the capital of the A√Ør region to the natron salt pans along the string of oases formed by the Kaouar cliffs. Food and supplies were carried from Agadez each November and March and traded for bricks of salt, condensed in the natron pits of oasis towns, and to a lesser extent, dates and vegetables. The salt was then generally traded for animal use in the Hausaland regions to the south.Decalo, p.41, 133, 134 The Agadez- Bilma Taghlamt was historically a monopoly of the Tuareg, and successively the Kel Gress, Kel Owey and Kel Ayr confederations in particular. Many Tuareg traders owned the salt pits and date plantations in Kaouar, as well as holding bonded laborers there, and traveled the caravan to administer their property. The Tuareg Taghlamt, numbering 10,000 camels and stretching 25 km at the beginning of the colonial period, is led by the representative of the Amenokal (confederation leader), followed by each sub group.Decalo, p.41.  Pre- colonial history  The Camel was introduced into the Sahara in the late first millennium, and Tuareg tribes moved south into the region in the 13th century. In the 18th century, Tuareg confederations captured the Kaouar oases from the Kanem-Bornu Empire and began transporting goods from Agadez.Decalo, p.133.  Colonial and post-colonial history  The disruptions of the French colonial expansion in the first years of the 20th century led to inter clan rivalries, and later, the rise of mechanised traffic. In 1904, Ouled Sliman raiders from what is now Chad destroyed the caravan at Bilma, and again in 1906 at Fachi. The French reported that the 1906 caravan numbered 20,000 camels. Following the Kaocen revolt, no Taghlamt traveled the route until 1925, and then it was accompanied by French colonial forces. By 1948, the caravans had shrunk to 8000 camels, and continued to shrink thereafter. The northern road route, marked by the Tree of T√©n√©r√©, has supplanted most camel trains, but small Taghlamt trains continue to head out each November.

Early life and military career Wilkinson was born in Highgate, Middlesex, the son of a barrister. He was educated at Harrow School and entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in 1889. He was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards in 1890, promoted Lieutenant on 1 July 1896, and Captain on 1 April 1899. He served twice with his regiment in the Second Boer War, the second time from April 1902 when he was in command of reinforcements of 250 officers and men. They left Southampton in the troopship Dilwara on 15 April, arriving in South Africa the following month. He retired from the army in 1907, although he returned to service in the First World War as a staff officer. He was promoted Major in 1915. Heraldic career The office of Ulster King of Arms, Principal Herald of Ireland, was created 1552 by Edward VI, with full jurisdiction over Irish heraldry. There were two disparate heraldic traditions in Ireland at that time ‚Äì the old Gaelic Irish tradition, and the Norman and Anglo-Irish traditions which were part of the European heraldic mainstream. At this time, Ulster King of Arms was Principal officer of arms of all Ireland. Most of Ulster King of Arms's work was heraldic rather than genealogical, although collecting genealogies and proving pedigrees were essential to ensure that arms were used and inherited by the rightful heirs. However, from the start of the eighteenth century Ulster began to acquire other duties, as an officer of the crown intimately linked to the government. These duties were largely ceremonial. For example, Ulster King of Arms had to decide and arrange precedence on state occasions at the court of the English Viceroy (later Lord Lieutenant) of Ireland, formally introduce new peers to the Irish House of Lords, and record peerage successions. An additional responsibility came in 1783, when Ulster King of Arms became registrar for the newly established chivalric Order of St Patrick. This was an Irish equivalent of such long- established English institutions as the Order of the Garter. Ulster became its registrar, responsible for administering its affairs. He continued to be responsible for the recording of peerage successions, since Irish peers (like Scottish peers) were allowed to elect representative peers to the House of Lords at Westminster until 1922. The heraldic and ceremonial duties of Ulster continued down to the twentieth century until 1922. The post was effectively in suspense between 1940 and 1943, after which the heraldic and genealogical duties were carried out by a Chief Herald of Ireland. Wilkinson was appointed Ulster King of Arms in 1908, succeeding the disgraced previous office-holder Sir Arthur Vicars after the theft of the St Patrick regalia in 1907. He was the last person to hold that office. As such, he was Principal Officer of Arms of Ireland, and one of the chief heraldic officers in the United Kingdom. It is not known what his qualifications for the job were, apart from his undoubted artistic abilities and his marriage to a well-born lady. His job was to manage Irish heraldry ‚Äì mostly the granting and use of arms. He was also to examine the genealogical records and pedigree relating to Irish families, and to maintain the register of members of the Order of St Patrick, as the premier civilian honour for Irish peers and others. The order was suspended 1922 after the promulgation of the Irish Free State. Major Wilkinson apparently spent most of his time in London at the Office of the Keeper of Royal Arms. It is not clear why he did so, given that the Office of Arms (and presumably all records) were located in the Bedford Tower in Dublin Castle. By 1923, Wilkinson had begun visiting the office regularly, which caused a minor political problem for the fledgling Irish Government for sixteen years. It was discovered around 1923 that the office of Ulster King of Arms had not been legally transferred to the Irish Government and since the office was created by Royal Prerogative in 1552, the British Government said that they could not transfer the office to Ireland. Eventually, the Irish Government decided in 1930 to let Wilkinson continue his work until his death, at which point the office would be considered by the Irish Government to have lapsed. The National Library of Ireland website shows that Wilkinson granted and confirmed arms right up to 1940. Indeed, more than two dozen confirmations of arms are dated 21 December 1940, the day before he died. One of Wilkinson's achievements in his capacity as Ulster King of Arms was the establishment of the State Heraldic Museum in 1909. Wilkinson was appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) after the visit of King George V to Dublin in 1911, knighted in the 1920 New Year Honours, and appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) after the state opening of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in June 1921. Personal life Wilkinson married Lady Beatrix Francis Gertrude Herbert, first daughter of The 14th Earl of Pembroke and his wife Lady Beatrix Lambton, herself eldest daughter of The 2nd Earl of Durham, in 1903. The couple moved into Mount Merrion House, in the south of County Dublin, Ireland, where they lived until the start of the First World War in 1914. They had two daughters, Guendolen and Phyllis. To celebrate their births, two redwood trees were planted opposite the entrance to the Church of St Therese. Wilkinson built two famous dollhouses, Titania's Palace (completed and inaugurated in 1922 by Queen Mary) and Pembroke Palace (completed in 1907). Titania's Palace remained in the family for many years, but was sold after 1960 first to an English amusement park, then to Legoland and is currently lent to Egeskov Castle. Pembroke Palace Dolls House is now at Wilton House, seat and home of The 15th Earl of Pembroke. Wilkinson was survived by his widow and his two daughters. Lady Beatrix was remarried in 1942 to The 7th Earl of Wicklow (1877‚Äì1946), a title which is now extinct.

He was the first director of the Lunar Section of the British Astronomical Association (BAA), and is remembered by the lunar crater Elger. Biography Thomas Elger was born on 27 October 1836 in Bedford, where his family had been established for several generations, and educated at Bedford School. His father Thomas Gwyn Elger (1794 - 1841) was an architect and builder. Grandfather, father and son engaged in town politics, and all held the post of mayor. Elger studied at University College London and adopted the profession of a civil engineer. He was engaged in several important works, including the Metropolitan Railway and the Severn Valley Railway. However, his surveys for railway construction in Holstein were put to a stop by the war with Prussia and Austria in 1864. Soon afterwards he relinquished the active pursuit of his profession and devoted himself to scientific studies. He had developed a strong taste for astronomy already at an early age and erected his first observatory in Bedford. Elger observed with an 8.5 inch reflector. His sketches from 1884 to 1896 are now in the possession of the BAA. He is best known as a careful and indefatigable selenographer, and for this work his artistic skill eminently qualified him. He is most remembered for his book The Moon: A full Description and Map of its Principal Physical Features. Published in 1895, its maps are still highly regarded by lunar observers due to their uncluttered nature. The visual brightness of lunar features is expressed in the Elger's Lunar Albedo Scale. This scale had been established in 1791 by the German astronomer Johann Hieronymus Schr√∂ter and popularized by Elger. Elger was a member of several astronomical associations, and he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society on 10 February 1871. He was a founding member of the short-lived Selenographical Society, in 1878, President of the Liverpool Astronomical Society, and a founding member of the British Astronomical Association, in 1890, becoming the first director of its Lunar Section. He was appointed an associate of the Astronomical Society of Wales, a form of honorary membership. Besides his astronomical work, he was an ardent archaeologist and founded the Bedfordshire Natural History Society and Field Club. Thomas Gwyn Elger died on 9 January 1897, aged 60, and the lunar crater Elger was named in his honour in 1912.

It frequents small lakes, ponds, and streams or nearby wet forests. The eastern newt produces tetrodotoxin, which makes the species unpalatable to predatory fish and crayfish. It has a lifespan of 12 to 15 years in the wild, and it may grow to in length. These animals are common aquarium pets, being either collected from the wild or sold commercially. The striking bright orange juvenile stage, which is land-dwelling, is known as a red eft. Some sources blend the general name of the species and that of the red-spotted newt subspecies into the eastern red-spotted newt (although there is no \\"western\\" one). Sub-species The eastern newt includes these four subspecies: *Red- spotted newt (N. v. viridescens) *Broken-striped newt (N. v. dorsalis) *Central newt (N. v. louisianensis) - Central newts measure from to in length. They are brown or green, with fine black dots all over the body. There may be a row of red spots on each side of the body. The belly is yellow or orange and is noticeably lighter than the rest of the body. The skin of newts is not as slippery as the skin of salamanders and may appear to be rough and dry for parts of their lives. *Peninsula newt (N. v. piaropicola) Life stages Eastern newts have three stages of life: (1) the aquatic larva or tadpole, (2) the red eft or terrestrial juvenile stage, and (3) the aquatic adult. Larva The larva possesses gills and does not leave the pond environment where it was hatched. Larvae are brown-green, and shed their gills when they transform into the red eft. Red eft The red eft (juvenile) stage is a bright orangish-red, with darker red spots outlined in black. An eastern newt can have as many as 21 of these spots. The pattern of these spots differs among the subspecies. An eastern newt's time to get from larva to eft is about three months. During this stage, the eft may travel far, acting as a dispersal stage from one pond to another, ensuring outcrossing in the population. The striking coloration of this stage is an example of aposematism ‚Äî or \\"warning coloration\\" ‚Äî which is a type of antipredator adaptation in which a \\"warning signal\\" is associated with the unprofitability of a prey item (i.e., the saturation of the eft's tissues with tetrodotoxin) to potential predators. Adult After two or three years, the eft finds a pond and transforms into the aquatic adult. The adult's skin is a dull olive green dorsally, with a dull yellow belly, but retains the eft's characteristic black-rimmed red spots. It develops a larger, blade-like tail and characteristically slimy skin. It is common for the peninsula newt (N. v. piaropicola) to be neotenic, with a larva transforming directly into a sexually mature aquatic adult, never losing its external gills. The red eft stage is in these cases skipped. Homing Eastern newts home using magnetic orientation. Their magnetoreception system seems to be a hybrid of polarity-based inclination and a sun-dependent compass. Shoreward-bound eastern newts will orient themselves quite differently under light with wavelengths around 400 nm than light with wavelengths around 600 nm, while homing newts will orient themselves the same way under both short and long wavelengths. Ferromagnetic material, probably biogenic magnetite, is likely present in the eastern newt's body. Habitat and diet Eastern newts are at home in both coniferous and deciduous forests. They need a moist environment with either a temporary or permanent body of water, and thrive best in a muddy environment. During the eft stage, they may travel far from their original location. Red efts may often be seen in a forest after a rainstorm. Adults prefer a muddy aquatic habitat, but will move to land during a dry spell. Eastern newts have some amount of toxins in their skin, which is brightly colored to act as a warning. Even then, only 2% of larvae make it to the eft stage. Some larvae have been found in the pitchers of the carnivorous plant Sarracenia purpurea. Eastern newts eat a variety of prey, such as insects, small mollusks and crustaceans, young amphibians, worms, and frog eggs. Conservation concerns Although eastern newts are widespread throughout North America, they, like many other species of amphibians, are increasingly threatened by several factors including habitat fragmentation, climate change, invasive species, over-exploitation, and emergent infectious diseases. Wild eastern newts are known hosts of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and Ranavirus. They are also highly susceptible to the newly emergent chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans.

It is set over the course of about one week in 1945 in a Joseph Stalin-era Soviet prison camp. As in many of Solzhenitsyn's works, the author paints a vivid and honest picture of the suffering prisoners and their incompetent but powerful wardens. Most of the prisoners depicted in the play are serving 10 year sentences for violations of Soviet Penal Code Article 58. In this play, the author first explores the analogy of the camp system to a separate nation within the Soviet Union, an analogy which would dominate his later work, most clearly in The Gulag Archipelago. The play has a fairly large cast of characters, mostly prisoners at the camp. The play has many difficult staging and set directions. Truckloads of prisoners arrive onstage, characters appear onstage pouring (and spilling) molten iron in a camp foundry, and one scene calls for a three-story building in the foreground of the set, with layered barbed wire and bare steppe stretching into the background \\"as far as the eye can see,\\" with an excavator operating in the distance. Despite this, the play has been performed in public many times, making its American premiere at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1970. A television adaptation of the play was broadcast by the BBC in the Play of the Month series in 1973. Plot summary The prisoner Nemov, apparently the story's hero, is an honest man serving a term of 10 years for violations of Article 58. At the play's start, Nemov is the production chief of his work group and is later replaced by, Prisoner Engineer Khomich. One of the play's clear recurring themes is the idea that Nemov's honesty is worthless in the face of the realities of camp life. All of the characters who prosper in the play can only do so by means of moral compromises. The most accessible and traditional plot element is the romance between the two prisoners Nemov (the \\"innocent\\" of the title) and Lyuba (the \\"love-girl\\"). Nemov learns that Lyuba is having sex with the camp doctor Mereshchun in exchange for better food and living conditions. When Nemov demands that she stop seeing Mereshchun, Lyuba refuses and a conflict arises. This lovers' conflict does not arise until almost the end of the play, in the final scene of Act III. Their dilemma is apparently resolved in the very brief Act IV, at the end of which an injured and dejected Nemov watches Lyuba enter Mereshchun's office yet again. The title of the play suggests that the romance of Nemov and Lyuba is meant to be the central plot element, but the romance occupies relatively little stage time. Most of the play is spent in developing the characters of Nemov and Lyuba as they live and work in total ignorance of each other, and in exploring the realities of camp life. Much of the play develops characters and situations that have little or nothing at all to do with the specifics of the romance.

Norris was born in Kilmacthomas, County Waterford, Ireland on 29 December 1978 to Mary Norris and Desmond Norris, a carpenter and well-known tenor. Norris is the youngest of five children. She started dancing at the age 10, when her parents signed her up for dance lessons at the Higgins School of Irish Dance in Waterford. She later won the All-Ireland, Great Britain, and British National titles and placed 3rd at the World Championships. Norris debuted as a professional dancer when she played \\"Morrighan, The Temptress\\" in Michael Flatley's show, Lord of the Dance. Gillian danced with the show from its premiere in July 1996 at the Point Theater in Dublin until her departure in 2000. Gillian toured the world with the show. Her rendition of Morrighan has been featured in two videos: The original video and the 1998 Feet of Flames video (taped live in Hyde Park, London). When the show began in 1996, she danced with Michael Flatley in the original show for a year, and then in late 1997 joined the second touring company (Troupe 2) in the United States. In July 1998, she returned to Troupe 1 and danced the lead in Feet of Flames in Hyde Park. She remained with Troupe 1 and toured Europe until she left the show in 2000. After Gillian left the show, she returned to Ireland and briefly pursued a modeling and singing career. In summer 2001, she briefly danced in the show Ragus in Dublin.

Rick Didjit) on guitar/vocals, Doug Evans on bass, and Rick's brother Brad Sims, on drums. Didjits were known for the aggressive guitar playing and persona of Rick Sims, who often baited the audience between songs, and took plenty of abuse for it. Moreover, the band also added odd stunts and theatrical bits to some of their stage shows, particularly when playing in Chicago and Champaign. They released their first album in 1986 on Bam Bam Records and disbanded in 1994, but briefly reunited in 2006. Brad Sims left the band in 1992. Former Scratch Acid drummer Rey Washam filled in for the Little Miss Carriage EP, and Todd Cole eventually took over as the drummer. Their song \\"Killboy Powerhead\\" was covered by The Offspring on their breakthrough 1994 album Smash. Recording history Fizzjob, their debut album, was produced by Iain Burgess (who has worked with Naked Raygun, Effigies and Mega City Four, among others). Many of the songs on the album (and a couple subsequent releases) had appeared on self-released cassettes such as Whoop My Head and Signifies My Go-T. The album showcased the burgeoning songwriting talents of Rick Sims, along with his fast, stinging guitar leads. They played their souped up rock and roll with plenty of speed. Underneath the fun and fury, the band displayed a real feel for classic rock forms from Jerry Lee Lewis (spoofed and honored in the opening cut \\"Jerry Lee\\") to Ramones to AC/DC and others. Highlights include the dynamic \\"Fix Some Food Bitch\\", the melodic \\"California Surf Queen\\", the dramatic \\"Mexican Death Horse\\" and the smart ass \\"Beast Le Brutale\\". Hey Judester, the follow-up album, was a big step forward, as the band, produced by Burgess again, was noticeably tighter and the production was accordingly beefed up. Furthermore, the Rick Didjit persona was truly crystallized, with sarcastic lyrics about bad asses, big cars, and fish dominating the proceedings. Considered by many fans to be the band's best album, the LP kicks off with the furious \\"Max Wedge\\" and segues directly into \\"Stingray\\". The first side also has the Cramps-like \\"Skull Baby\\", the lightning fast \\"Plate in My Head\\", sung from the point of view of a Vietnam vet, the heavy \\"Under the Christmas Fish\\", a frequent concert opener with its pounding bass and drum rhythm and Sims hooky lead guitar line, and the closer, a wobbly version of Little Richard's \\"Lucille\\". Side two was nearly as good, with \\"Axhandle\\" sounding like a cross between AC/DC and Buzzcocks, \\"Joliet\\" encouraging singalongs, Doug Evans's bass dominating \\"King Carp\\", and Sims showing that he could pen a great mid- tempo song on \\"Dad\\" (\\"you know I really hate it/when you hit me with that belt\\"), a tough guy song tinged with melancholy. Judester was the band's first album released on Touch & Go Records, and was subsequently released as a two- for-one CD with Fizzjob. The band's following solidified with the release of Hornet Pinata, which equaled, if not bettered, its predecessor. The album was littered with memorable riffs and careening, pile-driving rhythms, and perhaps the best set of lyrics on any Didjits record. Whether it was Rick Sims telling the story of a one-legged drug dealer who stored his stash in his peg leg in \\"Lone Lone Ranger\\" (\\"just touch my leg/and Santa Claus'll get you high\\"), offering a put down in \\"Evel Knievel\\" (\\"it takes a better woman than you baby/to call me a slut\\") or the pearls of wisdom dripping from \\"Sweet Sweet Satan\\" (\\"c'mon let me tell you my recipe/it takes 10 tons of bullshit/for 10 ounces of glory\\"), the album is a cackling joyride. It leads off with \\"Killboy Powerhead\\", later covered by The Offspring on their breakthrough album, Smash, has a worthy cover of The MC5's \\"Call Me Animal\\" and sloppy bash through Jimi Hendrix's \\"Foxy Lady\\", with bassist Doug Evans on lead vocals. The band shot a video for \\"Captain Ahab\\", an excellent midtempo song featuring some of Sims' most memorable guitar lines, which MTV refused to play due to drug references in the lyrics. Nevertheless, a clip of the video was shown on MTV's 120 Minutes show, and the clip contained some of those drug references. The video for \\"Judge Hot Fudge\\" appeared in a season five episode of Beavis and Butt- head entitled \\"Choke\\"; the boys were not impressed. Reunion All of the original members of the band appeared at the Touch and Go 25th anniversary celebration in Chicago, Illinois on September 9, 2006. The next weekend, the band played another reunion show in Champaign. In late 2016, preparations were also underway for another reunion in 2017. However, due to the death of Evans at the end of 2016, this reunion will no longer be happening. Current projects Sims now works with the Lookingglass Theatre Company in Chicago and has his own business as a composer/sound designer. For a few years, Evans resided in the Austin, Texas area where he regularly performed with his band, Bl√∂wer (now disbanded), built nitro dragsters, and raised his children Lola Evans and Dodge Evans.

RKU believes that the only long-term solution to the problems of capitalism is a violent revolutionary rearrangement of society at large, and the construction of a new socialist society, where production will be organised from people's needs.

A banner below shows the New York State motto Excelsior, Latin for \\"Ever Upward\\", and the secondary motto E Pluribus Unum, Latin for \\"Out of Many, One\\"‚Äîadopted in 2020. Allegorical figures of Liberty (left) and Justice (right) support the shield and an American eagle spreads its wings above on a world globe. Liberty's left foot treads on a crown, a symbol of freedom from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and holds a staff topped with a Phrygian Cap, a symbol of freedom and the pursuit of liberty. Justice is blindfolded and holds a sword in one hand and a scale in the other, symbolizing impartiality and fairness. The center shield displays a masted ship and a sloop on the Hudson River (symbols of inland and foreign commerce) bordered by a grassy shore and a mountain range with the sun rising behind it. History The first seal of New York was created by a committee appointed April 15, 1777, with the intent that it be used \\"for all the purposes for which the Crown Seal was used under the Colony.\\" On the front of the seal there is an image of a rising sun with the motto \\"Excelsior\\" and the legend \\"The Great Seal of the State of New York.\\" On the back is an image of a rock in the ocean, with the legend \\"Frustra.\\" The first seal was formally established by chapter 112 of the Laws of 1778, with some modifications in 1798 and 1809. There were apparently some informal variations over time as well, which led to the formation of a commission, in 1880, to determine the \\"exact description of the arms established in 1778.\\" The commission's conclusions, which were reported to the New York Legislature in 1881 and included \\"a description of the arms in language such as might be sufficient for the exact arms of the state to be constructed,\\" resulted in the fourth version of the seal, established by chapter 190 of the (New York State) laws of 1881. In April 2020, New York passed a state budget which included a modification to the state arms; E Pluribus Unum (\\"Out of many, one\\") was appended to the existing motto.

R. Martin, and its television adaptation Game of Thrones. Introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones, Joffrey is the eldest son of Cersei Lannister from the continent of Westeros. He subsequently appeared in Martin's A Clash of Kings (1998) and A Storm of Swords (2000). He is characterized as a spoiled, sadistic bully and is a frequent abuser of Sansa Stark, to whom he becomes engaged in the first novel, and his uncle Tyrion, whom he enjoys ridiculing. Joffrey is portrayed by Irish actor Jack Gleeson in the HBO television adaptation, a role for which he has received significant critical attention and praise.  Overview  Joffrey Baratheon is not a point of view character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, such as his uncle Tyrion Lannister and his one-time fianc√©e Sansa Stark. He inherits his mother's traditional Lannister looks, and has blond hair and green eyes, and is believed by many to be very handsome.  Character description  In public, Joffrey is allegedly the oldest son and heir of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister, both of whom entered into a political marriage alliance after Robert took the throne by force from the \\"Mad King\\" Aerys II Targaryen. In reality, his biological father is his mother's twin brother, Jaime Lannister. He has a younger sister, Myrcella, and a younger brother, Tommen, both of whom are also products of Jaime and Cersei's incestuous relationship. Their sole biological grandparents, Tywin and Joanna Lannister, were also first cousins. Joffrey is an amoral sadist who disguises his cruelty with a thin veneer of charm. This is best epitomized by his response when his (then) betrothed offends him: Joffrey pronounces that his mother had taught him never to strike a woman, and so commissions a knight of the Kingsguard to hit her instead. He enjoys forcing people to fight to the death, and enforces cruel punishments for lesser crimes. He has no sense of personal responsibility, blaming failures on others. He lacks self-control and often insults his allies and family members. He is noticeably unintelligent and impulsive, which frequently leads him to make irrational decisions. He appears to have virtually no interests other than sadism and extreme violence, paying no attention to actually governing his kingdom or to anything involving sex even when he is offered exceptionally beautiful women. Joffrey is 12 years old at the beginning of A Game of Thrones (1996).  Storylines  Joffrey Baratheon's personal coat of arms  A Game of Thrones  Prince Joffrey is taken by his parents to Winterfell and is betrothed to Sansa Stark in order to create an alliance between House Baratheon and House Stark. At first, Joffrey is kind and polite to Sansa. However, he refuses to show sympathy with the family when Bran Stark falls from a tower, until physically forced to by his uncle, Tyrion Lannister. While on the Kingsroad to King's Landing, Joffrey and Sansa come across Arya Stark practicing swordplay with a commoner Mycah. Joffrey accuses Mycah of assaulting a noble girl and makes a cut on his face with a sword. This causes Arya to hit Joffrey, allowing Mycah to escape. When Joffrey then turns on Arya, her direwolf Nymeria attacks Joffrey, injuring him. Later, Joffrey lies about the attack, saying it was unprovoked and demands Nymeria to be killed; however, Sansa's direwolf Lady is killed instead. He later has his bodyguard Sandor \\"The Hound\\" Clegane hunt down and kill Mycah. Later, Eddard Stark discovers that Joffrey is not King Robert's biological son and refuses to acknowledge Joffrey's claim to the throne when King Robert dies. He is taken into custody. On Sansa's pleas, Eddard issues a false confession of his treason. Joffrey promised Sansa that he would be merciful but then beheads Eddard anyway and later forces Sansa to look upon her father's head.  A Clash of Kings  Joffrey is briefly seen in A Clash of Kings (1998). He rules with whim and caprice, proving difficult for even his mother to control. Sansa becomes imprisoned to his will, and he frequently has his guards beat her when she displeases him. When Stannis Baratheon attacks King's Landing, Joffrey leaves the battlefield, damaging the morale of his army. The battle is only won by his uncle Tyrion's use of wildfire and his grandfather Tywin's last-minute counterattack aided by the forces of House Tyrell.  A Storm of Swords  Joffrey sets aside his earlier betrothal to Sansa Stark in favor of Margaery Tyrell, cementing an alliance between the Lannisters and House Tyrell. At Tyrion and Sansa's wedding, he humiliates his uncle and is outraged when his uncle threatens him after he commands him to consummate their marriage. Tyrion only avoids punishment when his father Tywin assures Joffrey that his uncle was drunk and had no intention of threatening the king. Later after the events of the \\"Red Wedding\\", Joffrey gleefully plans on serving Sansa her recently deceased brother's head. His uncle Tyrion and his grandfather Tywin are outraged and the former threatens Joffrey once again. After another disagreement, Tywin sends Joffrey to his room, much to Joffrey's chagrin. During his wedding feast, he repeatedly torments Tyrion and Sansa, presenting an offensive play about \\"The War of the Five Kings\\", with each of the kings played by dwarves to humiliate his uncle, whom he also forces to act as his cupbearer. At the conclusion of the dinner, however, Joffrey dies from poisoned wine. Tyrion is falsely accused and arrested by Cersei in A Storm of Swords (2000) but it is later revealed that Lady Olenna Tyrell and Lord Petyr Baelish were the true perpetrators.  Later novels  Joffrey is mentioned a few times in the later novels.  Family tree =TV adaptation= Season 1  After Robert's death, the Lannisters make Joffrey King, and his mother uses him as a puppet. A cruel ruler, Joffrey makes a mistake when, against Cersei's and Sansa's wishes, he refuses to honor his promise to spare Ned Stark; instead, Joffrey has him executed.  Season 2  Joffrey's act worsens the situation with the Lannisters' war effort, as his uncle Jaime is captured by the Starks, and Joffrey's paternal uncles Renly and Stannis challenge his claim to the Iron Throne. Joffrey frequently orders his Kingsguard to beat Sansa. His cruelty and ignorance of the commoners' suffering makes him unpopular after he orders the City Watch to kill all of his father's bastard children in King's Landing; consequently, he is almost killed during a riot. When Stannis attacks King's Landing, Joffrey serves only as a figurehead and avoids the heavy fighting. When the battle eventually turns in Stannis' favor, Cersei calls her son into the safety of the castle, damaging the morale of his army. The battle is only won by his uncle Tyrion and grandfather Tywin, aided by the forces of House Tyrell. To cement the alliance between those families, Joffrey's engagement to Sansa is annulled so he can marry Margaery Tyrell.  Season 3  The marriage is yet to take place, and rifts are growing between Joffrey, and his uncle Tyrion and grandfather Tywin, who are (in their respective ways) rebutting his cruelty. Joffrey also seems to take little interest in his betrothed, but is amazed and altered by her ways of winning the people's favor, in which he takes part. At Tyrion and Sansa's wedding, he humiliates his uncle and is outraged when his uncle threatens him after Joffrey commands him to consummate the marriage. Tyrion only avoids punishment when his father Tywin assures Joffrey that Tyrion was drunk and had no intention of threatening the king. Later, after the events of the \\"Red Wedding\\", Joffrey gleefully plans on serving Sansa her recently deceased brother Robb's head. Tyrion and Tywin are outraged, and the former threatens Joffrey once again. After another disagreement, Tywin sends Joffrey to his room, much to Joffrey's chagrin.  Season 4  Joffrey finally marries Margaery. During his wedding feast, he repeatedly torments Tyrion and Sansa, presenting an offensive play about \\"The War of the Five Kings\\", with each of the kings played by dwarves to humiliate his uncle, whom he also forces to act as his cupbearer. At the height of the festivities, Joffrey is suddenly overcome by poison and dies. His last act is an attempt to point at Tyrion, and as a result Tyrion is falsely accused and ordered arrested by Cersei, but it is later revealed that Lady Olenna Tyrell and Lord Petyr Baelish were the true perpetrators. Olenna Tyrell, Margaery's grandmother, later confides to Margaery that she would never have let her marry \\"that beast\\". Following Joffrey's funeral, his younger brother and heir, Tommen, is crowned King and proceeds to marry Joffrey's widow Margaery. Development and reception In January 2007, HBO secured the rights to adapt Martin's series for television. Years later young actor Jack Gleeson was cast as Joffrey Baratheon. Jack Gleeson plays the role of Joffrey Baratheon in the television series. Jack Gleeson received critical acclaim for his role as Joffrey Baratheon in the television series. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked the character #4 in their list of the \\"40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\\". Author Martin described Joffrey as similar to \\"five or six people that I went to school with ... a classic bully ... incredibly spoiled\\".

The 121st episode overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 10, 2004. In the episode, the boys' arch-enemy from preschool Trent Boyett is released from juvenile hall and seeks revenge after taking the blame for starting a fire that permanently disfigured their pre-school teacher. Several plot elements reference the 1991 film Cape Fear as well as the Star Trek episode \\"The Menagerie\\". Plot A horrified Stan announces to Kyle, Kenny, Cartman, and Butters that Trent Boyett, a notorious bully from their preschool years, is being released from juvenile hall after a five-year sentence. In a flashback set five years previously, the boys play \\"fireman\\", a game in which they put out a fire by urinating on it. Wanting to put out an actual fire, they ask Trent to start one. However, the fire soon gets out of control and their teacher, Miss Claridge, is badly burned. Instead of going the easier way by saying that the fire was an accident, explaining how Miss Claridge got injured, and risking getting into trouble, the four boys immediately place the sole blame on Trent. Trent attempts to have Butters defend him, but Butters refuses to say what really happened out of fear of getting in trouble with his parents. Trent is sentenced to juvenile hall. Now that Trent is free, he seeks revenge. For knowing of Trent's innocence, but not defending him, Butters ends up in the hospital after sustaining a number of childhood pranks. The boys know that this is Trent's way of sending a warning to them and ask the sixth- graders for protection from him, which they will give them in exchange for a photo of Stan's mother's breasts (which are actually Cartman's buttocks with nipples drawn on with a black Sharpie, using Madonna‚Äôs book SEX as a guide). After Trent dispatches all of the sixth-graders, sending them to the hospital, the boys ask Stan's sister, Shelley, to defend them. She softens her usually- mean stance against them when she sees how truly terrified of Trent her brother is, but she only agrees to help them on the condition that they confess to Miss Claridge what really happened five years ago. The boys meet Miss Claridge, who now must use a futuristic machine to get around and beep a single light on it one time to say yes and two times to say no, and attempt to confess about what happened five years ago, but Trent arrives to confront them before they can. Cartman takes out his mother's taser and fires it at Trent. But the electrodes land on Miss Claridge's electoral chair instead, causing it to crash into a propane shop, creating an explosion that destroys the shop and sets Miss Claridge on fire and crashes into a pet shop. The police arrive and ask Miss Claridge if Trent caused this. She replies \\"no\\" with two beeps, but the police misinterpret the two beeps to mean \\"yes, yes\\" and arrest Trent. The boys, having learned nothing from the experience, make the same mistake they made five years earlier, claiming that they were not involved with the incident at all. Trent is taken away, with Cartman taunting him with his buttocks. However, the sixth-graders, having been newly released from the hospital, come upon Cartman and see the \\"breasts\\" on his buttocks while he is mocking Trent. They mistake his rear end for actual breasts and carry him off to pleasure themselves to the very sight of them, with Cartman interjecting in slight panic. Production The plot is based on the 1991 film Cape Fear. Miss Claridge's motorized wheelchair is based on Christopher Pike's from Star Trek: The Original Series. The boys as pre-schoolers were voiced by actual children. The children's censored swearing are not actual swear words but were instead words like \\"big dumby\\". The episode started as an idea for a spin-off titled \\"South Park Kids\\". Home release \\"Pre-School\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Parks eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 29, 2006. The set includes brief audio commentaries by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone for each episode.

R. Martin, and its television adaptation Game of Thrones. Introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones, Renly is the youngest of the three sons of Lord Steffon Baratheon and Cassana Estermont, and the younger brother of Robert and Stannis Baratheon. He is Lord of Storm's End and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. He served as master of laws in his eldest brother's small council, before crowning himself king in the wake of Robert's death with the support of the Reach and the Stormlands, an act that helps kick off the War of Five Kings. This brings him into conflict with his older brother Stannis, whose claim is greater. Renly's homosexual relationship with Loras Tyrell is alluded to in the books and is made clearly evident in the television show. Both men are among Martin's most prominent LGBTQ characters, although Renly and Loras' adapted relationship and the show's portrayal of the latter has received mixed criticism. Renly Baratheon is portrayed by Gethin Anthony in the HBO television adaptation.  Character description  Renly Baratheon is the younger brother of King Robert and of King Stannis. He is a handsome and charismatic man that wins friends easily, which makes him popular with the smallfolk. He is thought to look extremely similar to his older brother Robert, albeit smaller and slimmer, inheriting the Baratheon height and long black hair. Although he is well-liked and charismatic, many powerful lords at court secretly consider him to be vain and frivolous. He is described as disdainful of reading, although he enjoys hunting and jousting. Renly is also a closeted homosexual engaged in a relationship with Loras Tyrell. Renly is not a point of view character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, such as Ned and Catelyn Stark. He is also often mentioned and remembered by Brienne of Tarth, who had fallen in love with him at a young age. Renly is mostly a background character in the novels.  Storylines  left Renly Baratheon is the youngest of the Baratheon brothers and Lord of Storm's End. He is described as handsome and charismatic, winning friends easily. Renly serves on Robert's council as Master of Laws. After Robert dies, Renly declares himself King of the Seven Kingdoms in A Clash of Kings, wins the support of the Baratheon bannermen as he is their Lord Paramount, and seals an alliance with House Tyrell by marrying Margaery Tyrell. Before he can march on the capital though, he hears Stannis is besieging Storm's End. Renly marches there, intending to kill his brother in battle, and turning down an offer to become Stannis' heir. Before the battle he is assassinated by a shadow conjured by Melisandre, though it is unclear if Stannis is aware of this or not. TV adaptation Banner of arms of King Renly Baratheon in Game of Thrones Renly Baratheon is played by the British actor Gethin Anthony in the television adaption of the series of books. Gethin Anthony on his character: \\"The reason why I like playing him is I think he's a fantastic man who believes in Westeros being a cultured and enlightened place. His major advantage -- and why he gets on well in the world -- is that he gets on well with people.\\"  Season 1  Renly Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End, is the youngest brother of King Robert and Master of Laws in the Small Council. He is popular with the people because he is handsome, jovial, and throws extravagant balls and masquerades. He is not fond of fighting or bloodshed, and would rather make friends than kill enemies. He is secretly the lover of Ser Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers, who convinces him that those qualities make him better ruling material than either of his older brothers. While Robert lies dying, Renly attempts to convince Ned of this, and that the two of them should kidnap Joffrey and rule the realm themselves. However, Ned refuses, so Renly, Loras, and their followers flee south. Once Joffrey becomes King and has Ned executed, Renly challenges his alleged nephew's claim to the throne.  Season 2  Renly declares himself King of the Seven Kingdoms during Season 2 and wins the support of the Baratheon bannermen and the support of other houses, despite Stannis' better claim. He also seals an alliance with the powerful House Tyrell and its bannermen (including Randyll Tarly, father of Samwell Tarly) by marrying Margaery Tyrell. He leads his massive army slowly through southern Westeros, biding his time. Catelyn Stark tries to convince Renly and Stannis to put aside their differences and unite against the Lannisters but it fails as both brothers refuse to give their claim for the throne. On the night before a battle between his and Stannis' forces, Renly agrees to Catelyn to allow Robb Stark to keep the title \\"King in the North\\" and rule the North and Riverlands, but on the condition that he swear fealty to Renly as King on the Iron Throne. Before Catelyn can offer a real negotiation, Renly is assassinated by Melisandre, who gives birth to a shadow demon and sends it to kill Renly in order to remove him from Stannis' path. Stannis is initially unaware of the exact nature of Melisandre's crime, and is later visibly shocked and saddened of the role he played in his brother's death, which he visibly regrets.  Season 5  Renly is later avenged in the Season 5 finale when Brienne of Tarth executes his brother Stannis after the battle outside Winterfell against the Boltons, spitefully telling Stannis that Renly was the rightful King.

R. Martin, and its television adaptation Game of Thrones. He is the second son of Steffon Baratheon and Cassandra Estermont, as well as the brother of Robert ‚Äì lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Renly ‚Äì lord of Storm's End. He is the Lord of Dragonstone, and after his elder brother's death, becomes a claimant to the Iron Throne of Westeros and a key player in the subsequent civil war. Stannis's goals are frequently impeded by his lack of manpower and resources, owing to his unpopularity with other noble houses. He must therefore rely on the counsel of the foreign priestess Melisandre and his right-hand man, lowborn smuggler Davos Seaworth, who he later promotes to Hand of the King. Stannis often struggles to escape the shadow of his two more overtly charismatic brothers, particularly Robert. Though first mentioned in 1996's A Game of Thrones, Stannis formally appeared in A Clash of Kings (1998), A Storm of Swords (2000) and A Dance with Dragons (2011). In December 2011, Martin posted a sample chapter from the yet-unfinished The Winds of Winter, told from Theon Greyjoy's viewpoint, which confirmed Stannis' return in the sixth book. Stannis is portrayed by English actor Stephen Dillane in the HBO television adaptation of the series, who has received significant critical praise for his performance. Stannis is a divisive character among fans of the books and television show alike, enjoying both great popularity for his dedication to justice and dark horse status, as well as opposition for his unrelenting attitude towards the Iron Throne. He has earned particular attention for the differences in his characterization between the novels and show, particularly during season five.  Character description  Stannis Baratheon is the younger brother of King Robert and older brother of Renly. He is portrayed as a brooding and humorless man with a harsh but fair sense of duty and justice whose dour demeanor is often off-putting in comparison to his two more charismatic brothers. He is renowned as a skilled and prescient military commander. Although he is initially said to be extremely stubborn and inflexible, in later books he has shown some ability to use diplomacy and deception to achieve his goals. Background Stannis was born as the second of Steffon Baratheon and Cassana Estermont's three sons, and in his youth he was constantly overshadowed by his older brother Robert. When Stannis was fourteen he witnessed his parents' death in a shipwreck off the coast of House Baratheon's castle of Storm's End, and subsequently lost his faith in the Seven Gods. During Robert's Rebellion, a teenage Stannis holds Storm's End in Robert's absence, but is besieged by Mace Tyrell and Paxter Redwyne for the best part of the year. Stannis' garrison only avoids starvation thanks to the smuggler Davos Seaworth, who evades the blockade by the Redwyne fleet to bring the Baratheon soldiers a cargo of onions and fish. When Eddard Stark arrives to lift the siege, Stannis knights Davos as reward for his aid, but also insists that Davos have four fingers removed as punishment for his years of illegal smuggling; Davos agrees, on the condition that Stannis removes the fingers himself. Stannis is subsequently tasked with building a new royal fleet to assault Dragonstone and capture the island, but arrives to find that Aerys II Targaryen's children Viserys and the newborn Daenerys had fled. Robert names Stannis Lord of Dragonstone, giving him control over the islands of Blackwater Bay and the nearby peninsula of Massey's Hook - but Stannis feels slighted, as their younger brother Renly is named Lord of Storm's End, giving him control over the entirety of the Stormlands. It is suggested that this was because Robert was following the custom of granting Dragonstone to the king's heir, but Stannis perceives it as an insult. Several years later, Stannis is married to Lady Selyse Florent, but Robert soiled their wedding bed by deflowering Selyse's cousin Delena, further insulting Stannis. Stannis and Selyse have a single daughter together, Shireen, who nearly dies in infancy after contracting greyscale and is left disfigured. Stannis, who is named Robert's Master of Ships, destroys the Iron Fleet under the command of Victarion Greyjoy at Fair Isle during the Greyjoy Rebellion and leads the conquest of Great Wyk, the largest of the Iron Islands, adding to his significant military resume. At the beginning of the first novel A Game of Thrones, Stannis comes to suspect that Robert's children with Cersei Lannister are not actually his, and reveals his suspicions to Robert's Hand of the King, Lord Jon Arryn. The two discover several of Robert's bastard children in King's Landing, and begin to gather proof, before Jon's sudden, untimely death. Appearance and personality Stannis is frequently described as a large and sinewy man that towers over others, such as Davos Seaworth and Jon Snow, a Baratheon trait. He lacks the long black hair of his brothers, and is instead balding, although he keeps a close-cropped beard of the signature Baratheon black. His face is described as 'tight like cured leather' with hollow, gaunt cheeks. His eyes are described by Asha Greyjoy as 'deep, sunken pits', with a powerful stare that suggests an 'iron ferocity'. Stannis' most prominent characteristics are his flinty and austere demeanor, unrelenting stubbornness, and powerful sense of duty and justice, the latter of which he is notorious for throughout Westeros. He rarely forgives a slight; Jon Snow once comments that \\"Stannis Baratheon with a grievance was like a mastiff with a bone; he gnawed it down to splinters.\\" His signature tic is grinding his teeth, often in the face of unpleasant or unforeseen circumstances. He is a renowned commander, sailor, and warrior, although he is a better tactician than fighter. Stannis is known for his brusqueness and lack of tact in social situations and finds himself uncomfortable around women, including his own wife. He abhors brothels and once tried to have them banned from King's Landing, which made him unpopular with the smallfolk there. He dresses plainly in dark clothing and is rarely seen without his sword and dagger. Stannis is plagued with bitterness at the lack of respect and affection he has been shown by his older brother King Robert, and even in childhood was described by the Baratheon family maester as \\"the most unloved of the three\\"; a \\"solemn and joyless\\" child \\"mature beyond his years\\". Stannis is an atheist, despite claims that he is being manipulated by the red priestess Melisandre. Although Stannis suffers from a lack of support and resources during the War of Five Kings, he is frequently described by his adversaries, including Tywin Lannister, as the most dangerous rival claimant. Above all he is characterized by his fearless and uncompromising pursuit of justice and duty - he is described by Varys in this way: \\"His claim is the true one, he is known for his prowess as a battle commander, and he is utterly without mercy. There is no creature on earth half so terrifying as a truly just man.\\"  Storylines  Personal coat of arms of Stannis Baratheon  Novels  Stannis is not a point of view character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, predominantly Davos Seaworth and Jon Snow, and later Asha and Theon Greyjoy. = A Game of Thrones = When Robert travels to Winterfell to name Eddard as his new Hand, Stannis flees to Dragonstone with his forces, including most of the royal navy. Stannis suspects Cersei's involvement in Jon's death. It is later revealed that the true culprit was Jon's wife Lysa, who was persuaded to poison her husband by her lover, Petyr Baelish. Eddard continues Stannis and Jon's investigations, and discovers that Cersei's children are the products of her incestuous affair with her twin brother Jaime Lannister. After Robert's death, Eddard tries to replace Robert's presumed heir Joffrey Baratheon with Stannis, but loses the political struggle against the Lannisters and is executed. = A Clash of Kings = Stannis comes under the influence of the red priestess Melisandre, who believes that Stannis is the reincarnation of Azor Ahai, a messianic figure in her faith. Stannis declares himself the one true King; however, most of the Baratheon bannermen support the claim of his younger and more charismatic brother Renly, as does the powerful House Tyrell due to Renly's marriage to Margaery Tyrell. Stannis tries to negotiate with Renly, offering him the chance to become his heir, which Renly rejects, planning to use his superior numbers to destroy Stannis' army the next day. However, Renly is unexpectedly assassinated by a living shadow conjured by Melisandre using Stannis' life force. After his death, many of Renly's bannermen immediately swear allegiance to Stannis, although the Tyrells side with the Lannisters due to their offer to have Margaery marry Joffrey. Renly's protector Brienne of Tarth swears to avenge his death by killing Stannis, but is talked out of it by Catelyn Stark. Now equipped with the strongest army and navy in Westeros, Stannis attempts to capture the capital city of King's Landing by sea, but many of his men are killed when Tyrion Lannister detonates jars of wildfire in the Blackwater River and burns most of his fleet. Stannis' forces still nearly claim victory, but Lannister and Tyrell reinforcements arrive in time to drive Stannis' men away from King's Landing. However, with the help Rolland Storm, the Bastard of Nightsong, Stannis flees to Dragonstone to fight another day. = A Storm of Swords = Stannis retreats to Dragonstone with what is left of his army. He imprisons his Hand Lord Alester Florent, one of his wife's uncles, for trying to offer terms of surrender to the Lannisters. Another of Selyses' uncles, Ser Axell Florent, castellan of Dragonstone, aims to become Stannis' Hand of the King. He suggests a plan to attack Claw Isle in retaliation for Lord Celtigar's bending the knee to Joffrey, but Davos derides an attack on this defenseless island as evil. For this honest counsel Stannis names Davos as his new Hand. Melisandre tells Stannis to burn Edric Storm, one of Robert's bastards, as a sacrifice to raise dragons from Dragonstone. Stannis is conflicted about burning his nephew but uses Edric's blood collected by three leeches to curse the rival kings: Balon Greyjoy, Joffrey Baratheon, and Robb Stark. After Joffrey's, Balon's and Robb's deaths seem to prove the power of king's blood, Stannis considers sacrificing Edric. Davos smuggles Edric off Dragonstone to the Free Cities, and then persuades Stannis to sail to the North and save the Night's Watch from the wildling army. After Melisandre burns Alester Florent as a sacrifice to R'hllor to ensure favorable winds, Stannis takes most of his remaining army and sails north to the Wall to relieve the Wildlings' threat on Castle Black. Stannis' sudden arrival at the Wall catches Mance Rayder, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, by surprise, and his cavalry routs the whole Wildling host with few casualties. Afterwards, he remains at Castle Black to negotiate settlement over the Wildling prisoners, and offers to legitimise Eddard Stark's bastard son Jon Snow as the new lord of Winterfell if Jon swears loyalty to him and joins the fight against House Bolton. Despite being tempted, Jon however declines the offer as he has made an oath binding him to serve the Night's Watch, and does not want Winterfell's godswood to be burned by Melisandre. Later, Stannis pressures the Night's Watch to finish electing a new Lord Commander, and Jon is eventually elected through secret lobbying by Samwell Tarly. = A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons = Stannis sends ravens to the Northern houses asking for their support in the name of the legitimate king, but only House Karstark and a small faction of House Umber swear allegiance. Stannis has Mance Rayder burned at the stake, and most of the Wildlings end up bending the knee to Stannis, although Stannis is unaware that Melisandre had used blood magic to disguise Mance as his lieutenant, the Lord of Bones, and vice versa. To rally the northern houses to his side, Stannis intends to attack House Bolton's castle The Dreadfort with the help of Arnolf Karstark, castellan of Karhold. In reality, Arnolf is working with the Boltons, hoping to entrap Stannis and have his great-nephew Harrion Karstark (who is the heir of Karhold and captured by House Lannister as hostage) executed, so his branch of the family can take control of Karhold. Jon Snow, however, advises Stannis to march west instead and attack the Ironborn invaders, so that he can rally the Northern lords in the west coast and the northern mountain clans. In exchange, Jon wants the Wildling prisoners so he can reinforce the defense of the Wall. Stannis accepts Jon's counsel and defeats the Ironborn holding Deepwood Motte and taking Asha Greyjoy captive. He restores the castle to House Glover, thus winning their support and that of the nearby House Mormont. He then marches on Winterfell to confront the Boltons, joined by the men of Arnolf Karstark and Mors Umber, but his army is waylaid by heavy snows and forced to camp at a small crofter's village three days' marching away from Winterfell. Some time later, Jon Snow receives a letter allegedly written by Ramsay Bolton, claiming that Stannis has been defeated and killed, though it is unknown how much of the letter is true or whether it was even written by Ramsay. George R. R. Martin confirmed to a fan in 2015 that Stannis is still alive in the books. = The Winds of Winter = In December 2011, Martin posted a sample chapter from the yet-unfinished sixth book The Winds of Winter, told from Theon Greyjoy's viewpoint, where Stannis is actively and efficiently preparing for the looming battle against the Bolton-Frey alliance. He secures a loan by signing a blood contract with the Braavosi banker Tycho Nestoris, whose convoy managed to find Stannis' army, and plans to immediately send Tycho back to the Wall for safety. Tycho also brought along a message from Jon Snow informing Stannis of Arnolf Karstark's planned treachery, after which Stannis arrested Arnolf, his son Arthor and his three grandsons and plans to execute them. He also subdued Tybald, the Dreadfort maester, who out of fear confesses that he has already revealed Stannis's position to the Boltons in Winterfell. Stannis then sends Ser Justin Massey to escort Tycho and the escaped \\"Arya Stark\\" back to Castle Black to reunite her with Jon Snow, in gratitude for Jon's counsel of gathering the northern mountain clans. Massey is to then travel to Braavos and use a loan from the Iron Bank to hire twenty thousand sellswords for Stannis. Stannis tells Massey that in case of his reported death, even if that news is true, Massey is to follow the orders as to seat his daughter Shireen on the Iron Throne. Stannis then interrogates Theon for information regarding the Boltons' military strength. When Theon taunts Stannis for not taking Ramsay seriously enough, Stannis confidently reveals that he already has a battle plan to utilize the terrain against the incoming Frey army. Stannis next receives Asha Greyjoy, and informs her that her brother Theon must be executed, as showing him mercy would mean losing all of the northmen. To spare Theon the agony of death by burning, Asha pleads with Stannis to personally behead him before a weirwood tree in the tradition of the northmen.  TV adaptation  Stephen Dillane plays the role of Stannis Baratheon in the television series. Stannis Baratheon is played by Stephen Dillane in the television adaption of the series of books. = Season 2 = Stannis' personal banner in the TV series. Stannis falls under the influence of Melisandre, a priestess of R'hllor who believes Stannis is the reincarnation of a legendary hero from her religion. After Robert's death, Stannis claims himself the true heir to the Iron Throne as Cersei's children are bastards born of incest. However, most of the Baratheon bannermen support the claim of the younger but far more charismatic Renly. Stannis confronts Renly and offers to make him his heir if he supports him, but Renly refuses, only using the negotiations as an opportunity to mock his brother, and intending to kill Stannis in battle the next day. Melisandre, who had seduced Stannis, gives birth to a shadow baby bearing Stannis' face that kills Renly, and many of Renly's bannermen immediately swear allegiance to Stannis. He then attacks King's Landing by sailing up Blackwater Bay. Stannis' force breaches the walls, but due to Tyrion Lannister's use of wildfire and the arrival of last- minute Lannister and Tyrell reinforcements, he is defeated. Nonetheless, he is convinced to continue fighting by Melisandre, and is further convinced by her magic as she shows him a vision of a battle in the flames. = Season 3 = Stannis acquires one of Robert's bastards, Gendry, from the Brotherhood Without Banners and plans to sacrifice him to further his quest for the Iron Throne. After Davos Seaworth questions his course of action, Stannis has three leeches drawn with Gendry's blood and throws them into a fire, calling for the death of Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy and Joffrey Baratheon. Upon the news of Robb's death, Davos releases Gendry to prevent him from being sacrificed. Stannis subsequently sentences Davos to death but is swayed by Melisandre, who encourages him to travel North to aid the Night's Watch against the White Walkers emerging from beyond the Wall. = Season 4 = Stannis hears of Joffrey's death and chastises Davos again for releasing Gendry and not finding him a suitable army, prompting Davos to write to the Iron Bank of Braavos in Stannis' name to help pay for an army. The Iron Bank nearly refuses Stannis' request, but Davos manages to convince them that Stannis is the only one they can turn to since Tywin Lannister is nearing old age. Stannis and his army arrive at the Wall shortly after the Battle of Castle Black, interrupting a parley between Jon Snow and Mance Rayder and crushing the wildling force. Stannis learns that Jon is Ned Stark's son, and on Jon's advice, he places Mance and his men under arrest. He is later present at the funeral of the Night's Watch brothers who died during the Battle for Castle Black. = Season 5 = Stannis begins plans to retake the North from Roose Bolton, hoping to recruit Mance's wildling army, if Mance will bend the knee to him. Mance refuses, and Stannis has him burnt at the stake. Stannis offers to legitimise Jon as a Stark to win the loyalty of the Northerners who refuse to recognise Stannis as their king, but Jon decides to remain loyal to his vows to the Night's Watch. Stannis marches on Winterfell, but his army is delayed by a large snowstorm. In the chaos Ramsay Bolton and his men infiltrate Stannis's camp, and destroy all supplies and horses. Melisandre persuades a profoundly reluctant Stannis to sacrifice Shireen to ensure victory. Although the act seems to lift the snowstorm, Stannis is visibly mentally broken, and the next day half of Stannis's army deserts him, Selyse commits suicide out of guilt, and Melisandre flees to Castle Black. Stannis decides to complete the march on foot. As his army arrives at Winterfell, it is swiftly defeated by a cavalry charge led by Ramsay Bolton. Surviving the battle, Stannis fends off Bolton soldiers in a nearby forest but is severely wounded and, at a point of utter despondency, confronted by Brienne of Tarth, former member of Renly's Kingsguard. Stannis confesses to killing his brother with blood magic and finally accepts responsibly, telling to \\"do [her] duty\\", whereupon she beheads him with a single stroke from Oathkeeper. Brienne enunciates she is executing him in the name of the 'rightful' King Renly, her slain love.  Critical reception  The English actor Stephen Dillane has received positive reviews for his performance as Stannis Baratheon, especially in the fifth season. On her review for \\"Sons of the Harpy\\", Sarah Hughes of The Guardian wrote, \\"Stephen Dillane has always been wonderful at showing us the core of this rigid, complex man.\\" His performance on the same episode also received positive reviews from Vulture. Harri Sargeant of Hypable wrote, \\"Stephen Dillane has always been one of the classiest actors on the show, and his last moments as the King Who Almost Was saw as commanding a performance as ever.\\" In her review for Mother's Mercy, Meghan O'Keefe of Decider wrote, \\"Whether you like Stannis or not, you have to admit that Stephen Dillane delivered a monumental performance this season.\\" Cindy Davis of Pajiba wrote \\"After Shireen's seemingly pointless death, it's a testament to Stephen Dillane's phenomenal skills that we could feel anything at all for a man who watched his daughter burned alive.\\" Nick Steinberg of Goliath wrote, \\"Credit has to go to Stephen Dillane for his performance, especially in these last few episodes where he's had to convey a form of grim tragedy that's effectively conveyed the character's downfall.\\" For his part, Dillane expressed misgivings about his performance, telling The Times newspaper, \\"I didn't know what I was doing until we'd finished filming and it was too late. The damage had been done. I thought no one would believe in me and I was rather disheartened by the end. I felt I'd built the castle on non-existent foundations.‚Äù'''''  Family tree of House Baratheon  References Sources * Category:A Song of Ice and Fire characters Category:Literary characters introduced in 1996 Category:Fictional filicides Category:Fictional fratricides Category:Fictional kings Category:Fictional knights Category:Fictional lords and ladies Category:Fictional people sentenced to death Category:Fictional revolutionaries Category:Fictional military strategists Category:Fictional swordsmen Category:Fictional war veterans Category:Male characters in literature Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Stannis Baratheon"},{"id":"1888720","text":"The Siege of Numantia () is a tragedy by Miguel de Cervantes set at the siege of Numantia, captured and razed by Scipio Aemilianus in 133 BC. The play is divided into four acts, (jornadas, or \\"days\\"). The dialogue is sometimes in tercets and sometimes in redondillas, but for the most part in octaves. The work was composed circa 1582 and was apparently very successful in the years before the advent of the playwright Lope de Vega. It remained unpublished until the eighteenth-century. Since then, it has been hailed by many as a ‚Äúrare specimen of Spanish tragedy‚Äù Raymond MacCurdy, ‚ÄúThe Numantia Plays of Cervantes and Rojas Zorrilla: The Shift from Collective to Personal Tragedy,‚Äù Symposium14 (1960): 100-120 and even as the best Spanish tragedy not only from the period before Lope de Vega, but of all its literature.Alfredo Hermenegildo,La tragedia en el Renacimiento espa√±ol.Barcelona: Planeta, 1973 Some critics have seen resemblances between Cervantes' tragedy and Aeschylus's The Persians,Frederick A. de Armas, Cervantes, Raphael and the Classics.Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 77-96 while others reject that the play is a conventional tragedy.Paul Lewis-Smith, \\"Cervantes' Numancia as Tragedy and as Tragicomedy,\\" Bulletin of Hispanic Studies 64 (1987): 15-26. Some envision the play as containing epic elements or even exhibiting opposing epics: Virgil's Aeneid and Lucan's Pharsalia,Emilie Bergmann, ‚ÄúThe Epic Vision of Cervantes Numancia,‚Äù Theater Journal 36 (1982); Frederick A. De Armas, Cervantes, Raphael and the Classics, pp. 116-53. while Barbara Simerka argues for generic instability and the counter-epicBarbara Simerka, Discourses of Empire. Counter-Epic Literature in Early Modern Spain University Park, Penn State University Press, 2003, pp. 87-95. Plot In the first act, Scipio appears with his generals in the Roman camp before Numantia. He explains that this war has been going on for many years and that the Roman Senate has sent him to finish the task. He reprimands his troops, whose martial spirit has begun to be superseded by the pleasures of Venus and Bacchus. The soldiers are re-inspired with courage. Numantian ambassadors enter with proposals for peace, which are rejected. The Greek Chorus, in Cervantes' work is replaced by allegorical figures. Spain appears, and she summons the river Duero, on whose banks Numantia stands. The old river god appears, attended by a retinue of the deities of the smaller rivers of the surrounding country. These allegorical characters consult fate, in the guise of Proteus and discover that Numantia cannot be saved. The lengthy speech dealing with Spanish history has been taken as a moment of praise for the future Spanish empire,Juan Bautista Avalle-Arce, Nuevos deslindes cervantinos.Barcelona: Ariel, 1976; Francisco Vivar, \\"El ideal pro patria mori en La Numancia de Cervantes,\\" Cervantes 20.2 (2000):7-30 and as containing elements that question imperial expansionism.Frederick A. de Armas, Cervantes, Raphael and the Classics.pp. 116-35. In Act Two, the scene is now transferred to Numantia. The senate is assembled to deliberate on the affairs of the city. The senate adopts bold resolutions. The story moves into light redondillas - the loves of a young Numantian, named Marandro for Lira. Although Venus is invoked, Marandro assures his friend Leoncio that true love (as opposed to Roman lust) does not impede his duties as citizen and soldier.Veronica Ryjic, \\"Mujer, Alegoria e imperio en el drama de Miguel de Cervantes El cerco de Numancia\\" Anales cervantinos38 (2006):203-19. A solemn sacrifice is prepared; but amidst the ceremony an evil spirit appears, seizes the sacrificial ram, and extinguishes the fire. The confusion in the town increases. A dead man is resuscitated by magic in a dramatic scene reminiscent of the necromantic revivification by the witch Erichto in the Pharsalia. In the third act, all hope for a successful resolution of the dispute between Romans and Numantians has now vanished. While the men would go out and fight the Romans in the field rather than die of hunger in the siege, the women of the play prevent them from doing this. It is they who recommend a mass suicide, for, in this manner, they will not become enslaved to the Romans. It is the women, then, who impel Theagenes to carry out this fatal action, thus playing a key role in the tragic denouement.Veronica Ryjik, \\"Mujer, Alegoria e imperio en el drama de Miguel de Cervantes El cerco de Numancia, pp 212-15. The city resolves to burn all their valuable property, to put their wives and children to death, and to throw themselves into the flames, lest any of the inhabitants of the town should become the slaves of the Romans. Scenes of domestic misery and of patriotism ensue. Famine rages in Numantia. Marandro, accompanied by his friend, Leoncio, ventures to enter the Roman camp. The tragic denouement ensues in Act Four. Here, Marandro returns with some bread smeared with blood in order to feed Lira, but he falls at her feet mortally wounded, foregrounding the theme of sacrifice.William M. Whitby, \\"The Sacrifice Theme in Cervantes' Numancia,\\" Hispania, 45.2 (1962): 205-10. Scenes of destruction and mass suicide ensue, as men kill their women and then turn the sword on themselves or duel with each other. The allegorical figures of War, Sickness and Hunger take over the stage in an apocalyptic ambiance.Brian N. Stiegler, \\"The Coming of the New Jerusalem: Apocalyptic Vision in Cervantes' La Numancia,\\" Neophilologus, 80.4 (1996): 569-81. When Bariato, the last youth left alive, commits suicide by throwing himself from a tower, the Roman general realizes that he cannot go home with slaves and spoil, and that the small city of Numantia has triumphed over the power of the Romans. His lament signals for some critics the final catastrophe and his role as tragic hero. His hubris and desire for domination rather than negotiation has brought him to his knees. The allegorical figure of Fame enters at the end of the piece, and announces the future glory of Spain, a great power that will rise out of the ashes of Numantia like the phoenix.

Spanning the last century and a half, the industry has seen two booms, and continues into the 21st century, albeit less dominant today. Invention To most the invention of the bicycle was by the German Baron Karl von Drais, who rode his 1816 machine while collecting taxes from his tenants. He patented his \\"draisine\\" (or \\"draisienne\\"), a \\"pushbike\\" powered by the action of the rider's feet pushing against the ground. Reports of early forebears of the bicycle were velocipedes, and included many human-powered vehicles. One, the scooter-like dandy horse or celerifere of the French Comte de Sivrac, dating to 1790, was long cited as the earliest bicycle, however, most historians now believe these unsteerable hobby-horses probably never existed, but were made up by Louis Baudry de Saunier, a 19th-century French bicycle historian. Commercialization In the 1860s, the Michaux family, Parisian coach builders, developed a new drive mechanism, placing pedals and cranks on an enlarged wooden front wheel with iron tires, which was mounted on a heavy steel frame. The credit for their innovative crank and pedals remains in dispute. Pierre Lallement, a Michaux mechanic, claimed to have collaborated with Ernest Michaux, while Henry Michaux told in March 1893 in the newspaper L'√âclair how his brother Ernest, together with their father Pierre have developed the idea in 1861 after modifying a draisine brought for repairs. The design was an adaptation of the crank-handles the two inventors had seen on a grinding wheel. In any event, Pierre Michaux's factory started producing crank-and-pedal driven velocipedes : two the first year, 142 the following year. Perhaps owing to dispute over the invention, in 1865 Lallement emigrated to The United States, where, with the financial backing of James Carroll of Ansonia, Connecticut, he recorded the first U.S. patent on a bicycle, in 1866. Meanwhile, by 1865, the Michaux family was manufacturing 400 velocipedes annually; their bicycles were on display at the first international bicycle exhibition in 1867, and by 1869, the Michaux factory, with a daily production of 200, began selling in the United States. Their wood and iron construction earned these velocipedes the sobriquet Boneshakers. The first boneshaker race was in 1868, in Paris' Parc de Saint Cloud; the winner was James Moore, a friend of the Michaux family. Moore also won the 123 km Paris‚ÄìRouen race in 1869, finishing in 10 hours and 40 minutes. However, tensions between France and Prussia building since the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 erupted into the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, and production of bicycles at Michaux was suspended to support the war effort. As a result, the next innovations occurred in Great Britain. Prior to the Franco-Prussian war, the Michaux family had reached an agreement with Rowley B. Turner of the Coventry Sewing Machine Company to manufacture 400 Michaux velocipedes to be sold in France. With the war, Turner arranged instead to sell them in England. James Starley, a foreman at Coventry, began to make improvements and in 1885, the Starley Rover, a safety bicycle manufactured by Starley's nephew, John Kemp Starley, was the first recognisably modern bicycle. Golden age While the bicycle was popular among wealthy young men in cities such as London, New York City, and Paris, Starley's safety bicycle ushered in the \\"golden age of bicycles.\\" A bicycle craze swept Europe and North America during the Gay Nineties; suddenly, the bicycle was safe, affordable, and available for transport and leisure for the ordinary person. Although France was swept up in the craze, production remained centered in England and the United States. However, the seeds were sown for the rebirth of the French industry. In 1881, Paul de Vivie, a man of twenty-eight, bought his first bicycle, an ordinary. By 1887, de Vivie decided to devote his attention to his avocation; he sold his business, and moved to Saint-√âtienne, where he opened a bicycle shop and started a magazine, Le Cycliste. Velocio, as de Vivie was known, began to import bicycles from Coventry; within two years, however, he had begun to produce his own bicycles. His 1889 La Gauloise was the first bicycle produced in France.

It was located on the lands around Ortenburg Castle, about west of Passau. Though the Counts of Ortenburg - formerly Ortenberg - emerged in the 12th century as a cadet branch of the Rhenish House of Sponheim (Spanheim) who then ruled over the Duchy of Carinthia, an affiliation with the Carinthian Ortenburger comital family is unverifiable. Ortenburg Castle, Bavaria The first Count Rapoto I of Ortenburg was mentioned about 1134. Born at Kraiburg, the fourth son of Duke Engelbert II of Carinthia, he retained several Bavarian territories held by the Spanheimer family, while his elder brothers Ulric and Engelbert III succeeded their father in Carinthia and Istria. Rapoto had the Ortenburg Castle erected about 1120 whereafter he began to call himself a Graf von Ortenberg. When his brother Engelbert III died without heirs in 1173 he could unite a significant number of territories under his rule and confirmed his independence when the Bavarian ducal title passed to the House of Wittelsbach in 1180. After Otto VIII of Wittelsbach had assassinated the German king Philip of Swabia in 1208, Rapoto's son Count Rapoto II even held the office of a Count Palatine of Bavaria. Rapoto's II descendants however soon entered into fierce conflicts with the neighbouring Bishops of Passau and also with the mighty Austrian House of Babenberg. Upon the death of Count Rapoto III in 1248, his territories as well as the office of the Count Palatine again passed to the Wittelsbachs. The Ortenburg territory was further diminished by an ongoing inheritance conflict between Rapoto's III nephew Henry II and his brothers, of which the surviving Count Rapoto IV in 1275 could only retain the lands around Ortenburg Castle. Upon the death of Count Henry IV of Ortenburg in 1395, the county was partitioned into Ortenburg-Altortenburg, Ortenburg-Neuortenburg and Ortenburg-Dorfbach. The Neuortenburg branch again inherited the Altortenburg county in 1444 following the death of Etzel I and Dorfbach county in 1462 following the death of Count Alram II. Meanwhile, the county had fallen under the influence of the Wittelsbach Bavaria-Landshut duchy, and also sided with Duke Albert IV of Bavaria-Munich in the 1503 Landshut War of Succession. Since the dynasty of the Counts of Celje had become extinct with the death of Count Ulrich II in 1456, the Ortenburg counts had claimed the Carinthian Grafschaft Ortenburg, but failed to prove any kinship apart from the name similarity. Count Joachim (1530-1600) Under Count Joachim of Ortenburg-Neuortenburg, the state turned to Protestantism in 1563, fiercely opposed by Duke Albert V of Bavaria challenging Ortenburg's Imperial immediacy which however was confirmed by the Imperial Chamber Court in 1573. The county remained a Lutheran enclave within the mainly Catholic Bavarian lands and became a refuge for expellees during the Thirty Years' War. Though deeply in debt after numerous lawsuits against the Wittelsbach dukes, Ortenburg-Neuortenburg retained its independence until in 1805 Count Joseph Charles Leopold finally sold it to Elector Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. The county was incorporated into the newly established Kingdom of Bavaria in the course of the Empire's dissolution in 1806. Tambach Castle In exchange for his county, the count received the former monastery of Tambach (today part of Weitramsdorf) in Franconia in 1806, which was elevated to the status of Imperial County of Ortenburg-Tambach, but shortly later became part of the Grand Duchy of Wurzburg by mediatisation, and in 1814 fell to the Kingdom of Bavaria. Since then the counts of Ortenburg belong to the Mediatized Houses. In 1827 count Joseph Carl bought his family's ancestral seat, Ortenburg Castle, back from the Bavarian Crown. Count Alram (1925‚Äì2007) however, who converted to the Roman Catholic Church, sold it in 1971. His son, count Heinrich (b. 1956), the former husband of Princess D√©sir√©e of Hohenzollern, owns Tambach Castle (the former monastery) and its vast estate to this day.

R. Martin and its television adaptation, Game of Thrones. Ellaria first appears in A Storm of Swords (2000), and while she is only mentioned in A Feast for Crows (2005), she returns in A Dance with Dragons (2011). She is the paramour to Oberyn Martell and mother to several of his bastard daughters, the Sand Snakes. After the death of her lover in a duel at the hands of Ser Gregor Clegane, she is sent into deep mourning, although her subsequent characterization differs between the novels and the television adaptation. In the novels, she sues for peace, seeking an end to the cycle of revenge. In the television adaptation, however, she is portrayed as ruthless and vengeful, willing to do anything to destroy House Lannister, even if it means killing Oberyn's own family in the process. The character is portrayed by Indira Varma in the HBO television adaptation. Character description Ellaria Sand is a bastard from Dorne but is not discriminated against for this, as Dorne's views and customs towards children born out of wedlock differ from those of the rest of Westeros, where bastards are often discriminated against. She is the paramour of Oberyn Martell, as even in Dorne a Prince cannot marry a bastard. She is the mother of the youngest four Sand Snakes (Oberyn's bastard daughters). Like Oberyn, she is bisexual. In the novels, Ellaria Sand is mostly a background character. She is not a point of view character; rather, her actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, such as Tyrion Lannister, Arianne Martell, and Areo Hotah. Storylines Coat of arms of House Martell  A Storm of Swords  Ellaria comes with Oberyn to King's Landing, as part of Tyrion Lannister's efforts to win them to the Iron Throne. Oberyn, however, clearly wants revenge for his sister's death, apparently committed on the orders of Tywin Lannister, during King Robert's rebellion. Oberyn wants Ellaria to sit with him at Joffrey Baratheon's wedding, causing trouble when Olenna Tyrell calls her \\"the serpent's whore\\". Later, when Tyrion is condemned for poisoning Joffrey Baratheon, Oberyn acts as his champion in a Trial by Combat against Ser Gregor Clegane, who had raped and murdered Oberyn's sister, Elia Martell, during the Sack of King's Landing. Oberyn wounds Gregor with a poisoned spear but is killed by Gregor. Afterwards, Ellaria returns to Dorne.  A Dance with Dragons  Gregor Clegane apparently dies of the poison after spending days in agony (Oberyn having treated the poison to work slowly). His skull is sent to Dorne, where Oberyn's brother, Doran Martell, the ruling Prince of Dorne, sees it. Despite Gregor and Tywin's deaths, Oberyn's bastard daughters want revenge. Ellaria argues against revenge, saying all those they want revenge against are dead and the Lannisters they are now targeting took no part in their kin's deaths. She reminds them Oberyn died trying to avenge his sister's death and worries they too will die, if they seek vengeance. Doran sends her back to her father, Lord Harmen Uller of Hellholt with her youngest daughter Loreza Sand. TV adaptation English actress Indira Varma portrays Ellaria Sand. Ellaria Sand is played by the British actress Indira Varma in the television adaption of the series of books. She won the Empire Hero Award along with the rest of the cast in 2015. She was also nominated, along with the rest of the cast for Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2016.  Season 4  Ellaria Sand's storyline in this season is very similar to her storyline in A Storm of Swords.  Season 5  Ellaria tries to persuade Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne, to avenge his brother's death. However, Doran refuses, as Oberyn's death was via trial by combat, and therefore by Westerosi law, Gregor Clegane did not murder Oberyn. Ellaria soon learns that Jaime Lannister is sailing for Dorne, planning to rescue his daughter Myrcella, betrothed to Doran's son, Trystane. When Jaime arrives at the Water Gardens, the Sand Snakes attack him and Bronn, but the skirmish ends with all arrested by Martell guards. Doran and Jaime reach a deal, Trystane will marry Myrcella, but the two will live in King's Landing and Trystane will be granted a seat on the Small Council. Ellaria is threatened with death by Doran if she ever defies him and she feigns allegiance to him. She kisses Myrcella goodbye at the docks, secretly wearing lipstick coated with a slow- acting poison, which kills Myrcella on the ship headed for King's Landing.  Season 6  After Doran Martell realises that Myrcella has been murdered, Ellaria stabs Doran, while in King's Landing, Obara and Nymeria, who had snuck onto the ship headed to King's Landing, kill Trystane. This makes Ellaria the de facto ruler of Dorne. A while later, Ellaria meets Olenna Tyrell, whose son and grandchildren have been killed by Cersei, the present Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Ellaria then reveals that she has allied herself with Daenerys Targaryen after hearing that Yara and Theon Greyjoy have done the same. Later, Martell and Tyrell ships can be seen in Daenerys' fleet heading for Westeros.  Season 7  Ellaria and the Sand Snakes arrive in Dragonstone to discuss the conquest of Westeros with Daenrys. Yara and Theon Greyjoy return Ellaria and the Sand Snakes to Dorne so they can gather their army. En route, Euron Greyjoy attacks them and burns Yara's fleet. He kills Obara and Nymeria and captures Yara, and takes Ellaria and Tyene to Cersei, as a gift. In the dungeons Cersei recalls the death of Oberyn Martell and explains how much she loved Myrcella. Then she kisses Tyene using the same poison that Ellaria used to murder Myrcella. She tells Ellaria that she will be watching Tyene die and after Tyene's death, she will be kept alive to watch as her daughter's body rots away.

While his previous work was composed by his playing solo on acoustic guitar and then recorded with a shifting cast of session musicians, Open Road was Donovan's effort toward writing and recording music as a member of a band. History After working with producer Mickie Most on the string of successful albums, Donovan parted ways with Most upon completion of the Barabajagal sessions. He moved back to the UK against the wishes of his management, who objected due to Britain's heavy taxation and its distance from the American market. For the first two months of 1970, Donovan booked time at London's newly renovated Morgan Studios and began recording and producing the tracks that would form his next album. He made demos of around 20 new songs with just vocals and acoustic guitar, including solo versions of \\"Changes\\" and \\"People Used To\\", before assembling his new band. Dubbed \\"Open Road\\", the band was Donovan on guitar and harmonica, his frequent collaborator \\"Candy\\" John Carr on drums, and bassist/guitarist Mike Thompson who'd been a bandmate of Carr's in a group called Dada Lives and briefly in an early version of the band Amber. Donovan also hired engineers Robin Black and Mike Bobak, the latter of whom would work on several of Donovan's following albums. The sessions marked Donovan's first time playing electric guitar extensively in the studio, and he also took up producing the record himself. The trio were joined by former Nero and the Gladiators/Heads Hands & Feet keyboardist Mike O'Neill for some of the album's songs, and O'Neill stayed on to play a few gigs with Open Road. Donovan's intention was for Open Road to be the band he'd tour with indefinitely, primarily by sea on his own yacht. The plan was to leave Britain for one year, in part to avoid the exorbitant tax that the British government was levying on pop stars. The band met up on the Mediterranean isle of Crete to prepare the ship, rehearse material, and document their time there for the film There is an Ocean, which went unreleased until 2005 when it surfaced as a DVD in the box set Try for the Sun: The Journey of Donovan. The group ended up flying from Greece to France, to the Soviet Union, and then Japan, never fully embarking on their sea voyage. They also played a concert in Viareggio, Italy that was broadcast on Italian television. Donovan cut the tour short, returning to the UK to focus on his family and record his next album, 1971's H.M.S. Donovan, on which John Carr and Mike Thompson also appeared. The last gig that Donovan did with Open Road was at the third annual Isle of Wight Festival on 30 August 1970. Subsequently, Thompson and Carr continued to perform as Open Road, reassembling the group that same year with former Dada Lives bandmate Barry Husband on guitar and vocals, and church organist Simon Lanzon on keyboards. They recorded and released one more album, 1971's Windy Daze, before disbanding. Songs Many of the songs on Open Road ponder the negative side of industrialization and the lost peacefulness of a previous time. While Donovan had touched on this some of his previous work, Open Road was his first album to expound on the topic at length, though the versions recorded for the album scaled back on some of his more politically charged lyrics. The lyrics printed on the inner gatefold sleeve include some not sung on the actual record, like the first verse of \\"Celtic Rock\\": > Ye sons of Britain Who once were free Ye now are slaves to factory Those who > walk the path of mole Expect in time to kill thy soul The album's sole single, \\"Riki Tiki Tavi\\" (b/w \\"Roots of Oak,\\" also on the album), uses the mongoose from Rudyard Kipling's story in The Jungle Book as a metaphor for how people wait for institutions (\\"i.e.: the church, i.e.: the government, i.e.: school\\") to exterminate social ills. An earlier version of the song also preached abstinence from psychedelic drugs, stating, \\"Laboratory synthetic stimuli, only goes to fog up your third eye.\\" The song, \\"Poke at the Pope\\" decries religious faith, particularly Catholicism. \\"Song for John\\" was one of Donovan's epistles written for his friends, this one dedicated to fellow songwriter John Sebastian. \\"New Year's Resovolution\\" was inspired by Paul McCartney who, fresh from his break with The Beatles, was recording his first solo album in the studio below Donovan, as the two musicians saw themselves transitioning out of the 1960s and heading into new directions with their music. McCartney also loaned Donovan a guitar for some of the recording of Open Road. In addition to his mix of folk and rock, Donovan and his band explored a number of musical styles on the album. \\"Riki Tiki Tavi\\" takes Kipling's Indian setting and riffs it off of a reggae beat. Brazilian guitarist Carlos Jobim inspired the title of \\"Joe Bean's Theme\\", which alternates between a bossa nova rhythm and psychedelic pop melodies. And the album's allegorically fantasy-themed song \\"Celtic Rock\\" coined the name of a new musical subgenre.D. Leitch, The Autobiography of Donovan: The Hurdy Gurdy Man (Macmillan, 2007), p. 259. Releases and reception Open Road was released on vinyl LP in the US on Epic in July 1970, and then in the UK on Dawn Records in September. The album's cover features a photo, taken by Donovan's best friend \\"Gypsy Dave\\" Mills, of Donovan flanked by his two bandmates with their names typewritten in small print beneath each person. Some versions of the record featured neither Donovan's name nor the album title on the front, highlighting the name \\"Open Road\\" on the back, both as the album's title and as the name of the band featured on it. Other versions highlighted either \\"Donovan\\" or \\"Open Road\\" on the front. Open Road was Donovan's third-highest charting album in the U.S., reaching No. 17 within two weeks of its release and peaking at No. 16. In the U.K. the album reached No. 30. In August 2000, the German label Repertoire Records reissued Open Road for the first time on CD. Track listing All tracks by Donovan Leitch.

R. Martin, and its television adaptation Game of Thrones. Margaery is first mentioned in A Game of Thrones (1996) and first appears in A Clash of Kings (1998). She is a member of the House Tyrell, the second wealthiest and largest of the eight Great Houses in Westeros. She is twin sister to Loras Tyrell and the granddaughter of Olenna Tyrell. She subsequently appeared in A Storm of Swords (2000), A Feast for Crows (2005), and A Dance with Dragons (2011). Like her grandmother, she is shrewd, ambitious and adaptable, and uses her beauty, generosity and family influence to secure power for herself. Having wed herself to three kings over the course of the narrative, she is one of the most influential political figures in Westeros, which often brings her into conflict with her chief rival at court, Cersei Lannister. Margaery is portrayed by English actress Natalie Dormer in the HBO television adaptation, a role for which she has received critical acclaim. Margaery is one of the most popular supporting characters in both the books and television show, and is often cited as a prominent example of the story's strong feminist themes. Character description Margaery is the only daughter of Alerie Hightower and Mace Tyrell, the Lord of Highgarden in the Reach. Her older brothers are the heir Willas, Garlan and Loras the Knight of Flowers, who is a member of the Kingsguard. One of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Westeros, House Tyrell is actually guided by the willful Lady Olenna, Mace's mother, who has arranged Margaery's marriages and mentors her in politics and court intrigue. Margaery Tyrell is not a point of view character in the novels, so her actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of Sansa Stark and Cersei Lannister. Storylines Coat of arms of House Tyrell Margaery appears in A Clash of Kings (1998), having married Renly Baratheon and supporting his claim to the Iron Throne. After Renly's assassination, the Tyrells switch allegiance and Margaery is instead offered to wed King Joffrey Baratheon. In A Storm of Swords (2000), she becomes popular among the citizens of King's Landing through her various charitable activities. Margaery forms an amiable relationship with the King's ex-fiancee Sansa Stark and through Sansa she learns much about Joffrey's true nature. Margaery weds Joffrey, but he is poisoned at their wedding feast. In A Feast for Crows (2005) Margaery marries Joffrey's younger brother, Tommen, and encourages him to assert himself as king. Margaery's growing influence over Tommen puts her in a bitter power struggle with his mother Cersei Lannister, which eventually culminates in Cersei framing Margaery for adultery. In A Dance with Dragons (2011), Margaery is released from prison and placed under house arrest, where she awaits trial. TV adaptation In HBO's Game of Thrones, Margaery's backstory and plotline in the early seasons remain largely unchanged from the novels, though the character is more prominent in the series and this version of Margaery is an adult as opposed to a teenager. Margaery first appears in the second season, following her marriage to Renly; she is well aware that her marriage is a political one, and displays pragmatism regarding Renly's homosexuality and his relationship with her brother Loras. Season 2 Margaery, newly married to Renly, reveals that she is aware of his romantic relationship with her brother and is willing to work around his desires to secure their alliance and her position. Following Renly's assassination, Margaery indicates to Petyr Baelish that she is aware that her brother-in-law, Stannis Baratheon, is more likely to be behind the assassination than Brienne of Tarth, the official suspect. She also makes it clear that her ambition is to be the Queen of Westeros, and that she will not settle for anything less. Season 3 Margaery has relocated to King's Landing and taken up residence in the Red Keep. She swiftly proves that she is one of the few people capable of managing Joffrey, which pleases his grandfather, Tywin Lannister, but makes her an enemy in Cersei. The series also expands on Margaery's friendship with Sansa Stark, though her motives are unclear and Margaery swiftly replaces Sansa as Joffrey's fiancee. Through several shrewd PR moves towards the city's poor and orphaned, Margaery becomes extremely popular with the common people as their future Queen. Season 4 Margaery Tyrell has been married to Joffrey Baratheon, but she is widowed hours later when he is poisoned at the wedding feast. Soon after, Olenna reveals herself as masterminding the poisoning, but Margaery, now aware that Tyrion Lannister's trial is a farce, keeps quiet. Arrangements are made to wed Margaery to Joffrey's younger brother Tommen, to whom Margaery swiftly ingratiates herself. Cersei and Margaery continue their bitter rivalry; Cersei resents being displaced as Queen and being forced to marry her very young child to the much older Margaery, while Margaery tries to outmaneuver her. Season 5 Margaery and Tommen marry, and she finally becomes the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. She taunts Cersei over her triumph, and exhorts Tommen to send Cersei away from the capital. Cersei, in a shortsighted attempt to get rid of her rival, consents for the Faith of the Seven to once again bear arms. Cersei intends for the zealously fervent religious order to seize and condemn Loras for his homosexual behavior, thus tricking Margaery into perjuring herself by denying knowledge of his proclivities. Margaery finds herself arrested and awaiting trial, although Cersei is arrested as well for her unrelated charges, ie. her incestuous behaviors. Season 6 After a period of captivity, Margaery is permitted to visit Loras in his cell. She discovers that he is beginning to break under the Faith's questioning, and that the meeting is a ploy to break her too. Jaime Lannister leads the Tyrell army on the Sept of Baelor to secure Margaery's release, but it is revealed that she has been absolved, by convincing Tommen to forge an alliance between the Faith and the Crown. To placate Cersei, Margaery surreptitiously convinces Olenna to return to Highgarden, subtly indicating that she is still loyal to House Tyrell. Margaery persuades the High Sparrow, the leader of the Faith, to release Loras if he surrenders his claim as heir of House Tyrell and joins the Faith. However, when Cersei fails to arrive for her trial Margaery deduces Cersei is plotting something. Panicking, she desperately tries to convince the High Sparrow to evacuate the Sept of Baelor, but the High Sparrow refuses and has the Faith Militant bar the exits. Moments later, wildfire set beneath the Sept by Qyburn on Cersei's orders is ignited, causing the entire Sept and its surroundings to be engulfed in flames. Margaery is killed instantly, along with hundreds of others present. Her death, and those of her brother and father, lead Olenna to accept a proposal by the Sand Snakes (who currently lead the Reach's ancient rival, Dorne) in supporting Daenerys Targaryen's invasion of Westeros. Family tree of House TyrellReception=A Song of Ice and Fire Adam Whitehead of the wertzone feels Margaery's rivalry with Cersei Lannister is a major driving force in A Feast for Crows. Sean T. Collins writing for Rolling Stone feels that author Martin has been vague about Margaery's ambition and political cunning and describes her as a; \\"mute mystery whose motives and level of involvement in the game of thrones are unknown [by A Clash of Kings]\\" However other writers feel Margaery's political ambition is more obvious. Madeline of Feministing writes; \\"Margaery is an ambitious politico as well as being a damn good actress ‚Äì she plays the part of the tragic, virginal twice-widow so well that almost no one suspects that she is dead set on winning the throne. Despite frequently being used as a bartering chip, Margaery uses her womanhood to her advantage, knowing that producing an heir will shoot her to power.\\" Similarly, Danica Liu writing for The Duke Chronicle describes Margaery as \\"subtle and graceful\\" and like most of the women in A Song of Ice and Fire, deals in the currencies of power. Game of Thrones Natalie Dormer plays the role of Margaery Tyrell in the television series. David Sims writing for The A.V. Club enjoyed the introduction of Margaery's character in \\"What Is Dead May Never Die\\" commenting; \\"the fun twist to this plot is that Margaery Tyrell is obviously not the blushing maiden she appears to be, but an operator just like everyone else,\\" and \\"Margaery could just be a cypher, a mostly silent cog in Renly's plans for dominance, but instead she's going to be a lot more.\\" He uses her character to praise the writing of Game of Thrones, stating that it; \\"rarely traffics in cliched characterization.\\" Jenna Busch of Zap2it calls Margaery a \\"power player\\" who will \\"do anything to stay on the throne.\\" Writer and editor Silvia Moreno Garcia describes Margaery as \\"a sleeker, more determined player of this game of thrones\\" when compared to her book characterization and goes on to comment that she is a \\"shrewd politician,\\" who might give the other good players a run for their money.\\" She also believes she is \\"older and worldlier than the one in the books.\\" In \\"Valar Dohaeris\\", Diana Huang of UC Riverside's Highlander News appreciated the development of Margaery's character and called her \\"self aware and quick-witted\\" and believes she has the power to wreak havoc in King's Landing. Many commentators notice Margaery's desire and ability to gain the support of the public. Rhiannon of feministfiction writes: \\"this Margaery is ambitious but kind, clearly sweet and generous, but also a master at working people's emotions in her favor. Graceful, elegant, and aware of how powerful every word can be. She's an expert at the game that Sansa has only just begun, and it is stunning to see her.\\" Tiffany Brown, writing for TV After Dark, states \\"Margaery has gained the favor and love of the people of King's Landing, and has even garnered the affections of her future king.\\" Natalie Dormer, the actress who plays Margaery, when interviewed by HitFix discussed Margaery's political savviness: > Margaery brings this whole new element to the Game that you haven't seen > before, which is basically PR. It's quite a modern ethos on PR and courting > public affections, hopefully. We've all seen politicians kiss babies. It > doesn't mean that she's insincere in her genuine hope to do charitable work > and it's just an interesting new comment on how you handle the masses and > how you win power that maybe we haven't seen in Westeros before. She also noted that Margaery comes from a matriarchal family and \\"that she's more cut from the cloth as a protegee of her grandmother, so she knows what it's like for a woman to be in charge.\\" For her performance in the show, Natalie Dormer, along with the rest of the ensemble cast, was nominated for four Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively, and the cast was awarded the Empire Hero Award in 2015 by the British film magazine Empire. For her performance in the third season of the show, Dormer won the Ewwy Award for Best Supporting Actress - Drama.

R. Martin, and the first season of the television adaptation Game of Thrones. Introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones, Viserys and his younger sister, Daenerys are the last confirmed members of House Targaryen who, until fifteen years before the events of the first novel, ruled on the Iron Throne in Westeros for nearly three hundred years. As such, they are hunted by the forces of the new king, Robert Baratheon, and have been forced to flee to the neighboring continent of Essos. Viserys is characterized by his vanity and bitterness, and often behaves cruelly towards his younger sister. Viserys is portrayed by Harry Lloyd in the HBO television adaptation.  Character description  Viserys Targaryen is the middle child and younger son of Aerys II Targaryen, also known as The Mad King, and his sister-wife Rhaella Targaryen. He is the older brother of Daenerys Targaryen and the namesake of Viserion, one of his sister's three dragons. Viserys Targaryen is not a point of view character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of his sister Daenerys. Storylines Coat of arms of House Targaryen  A Game of Thrones  Viserys Targaryen is the second born son of Aerys II Targaryen. Thirteen years before the events of the series, he and his sister Daenerys fled Westeros to escape death at the hands of rebel Robert Baratheon. Viserys is an arrogant, cruel and ambitious man given to violent mood swings. In A Game of Thrones, he sells his sister as a wife to the Dothraki Khal Drogo, as a means to secure the allegiance of Drogo's army toward his goal of reclaiming the throne. Frustrated with Drogo, Viserys demands a crown and threatens Daenerys and her unborn child; Drogo kills him by pouring a pot of molten gold over his head. Daenerys later names one of her dragons Viserion, after Viserys. She explains that in spite of everything, he was still her brother, and that his draconic namesake will help do what he could not. She also tries to remember him as the good person he was before the stresses of their exile made him violent and bitter, and acknowledges that he at least kept her alive and safe through her childhood. TV adaptation Viserys Targaryen is played by British actor Harry Lloyd in the television adaption of the books. Harry Lloyd on Viserys Targaryen: > As soon as I looked into more of the history of the Targaryen family and > actually read the other books, I found out more and pieced together his > backstory, and he became sympathetic. I understood more what motivated him, > and the fear he had, and the responsibility he had, and his childishness. I > mean, he never really had a parent. That changed a lot my view from reading > it to playing it. Lloyd on his character's death scene: > I've never had to die on camera before, let alone in such a grisly way. So > you just have to kind of give it everything. You talk to the two actors > holding you and say, ‚ÄòLet's not pansy around here. I'm gonna absolutely try > and get out of this, so don't let me.' Then, you let it rip. It can't be > some sort of half-assed whimpering ‚Äì you've got to really believe the pain > and the fear. It's actually quite liberating. Lloyd has received positive reviews for his role as Viserys in the TV series.  Season 1  Viserys Targaryen is the exiled prince and heir of the Targaryen dynasty and is known as \\"The Beggar King\\" for his search for an army to recapture his throne. A narcissist, he is arrogant and self-centered, caring only about himself and looking down on others, especially his sister Daenerys. In exchange for an army to help regain the Iron Throne, Viserys marries off his sister to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo in the first episode, \\"Winter Is Coming\\", and follows his horde's journey to the Dothraki capital to ensure Drogo will keep his end of the bargain. But as they journey, it becomes evident that Viserys does not have any leadership skills to reclaim the throne as his arrogance and disrespect for the Dothraki does not win him any hearts. Furthermore, Daenerys, whom he has always threatened throughout his life, starts to stand up to him. Seeing that Daenerys is loved by the Dothraki and that her and Drogo's unborn son is prophesied to unite the world, Viserys realizes that it is not he but Daenerys who will reclaim the Iron Throne. In the sixth episode, \\"A Golden Crown\\", Viserys gets drunk, and in a fit of rage he demands that Drogo give him his army and crown, threatening to kill his sister and her unborn son if his demands are not met. Having had enough of his behavior, Drogo kills Viserys by giving him a \\"Golden Crown\\": molten gold poured over his head. Daenerys watches her brother's agonizing death, proclaiming that he wasn't a true dragon, as \\"fire cannot kill a dragon\\". Daenerys later names one of her dragons Viserion, as a tribute to Viserys, although the reasoning is not explained on-screen.

The Signs Gospel or the semeia source is a hypothetical gospel account of the life of Jesus Christ which some scholars have suggested could have been a primary source document for the Gospel of John. This theory has its basis in source criticism. Since the commentary of Rudolf Bultmann was published in 1941,Das Evangelium des Johannes (1941), translated as The Gospel of John: A Commentary, Westminster ,John Knox Press, 1971, the hypothesis of a semeia (sign or miracle) source has gained some acceptance.D.

However, this disciple died unexpectedly, necessitating that a revised gospel be written.

Anderson, John, Jesus, and History: Critical Appraisals of Critical Views, Volume 1, Symposium series, no. 44, Society of Biblical Literature Pub, 2007 p.78 Therefore, scholars are no longer looking for the identity of a single writer but for numerous authors whose authorship has been absorbed into the gospel's development over a period of time and in several stages. Raymond Edward Brown, The Community of the Beloved Disciple, Paulist Press, 1979 pp.31 - 34The Muratorian fragment dates from around 180 It states that while John was the primary author, several people were involved, that mutual revision was part of the original intent of the authors, and that the editors included the apostle Andrew. (Geza Vermes, The authentic gospel of Jesus, London, Penguin Books. 2004. A note on sources, p. x-xvii.)Paul N. Anderson, John, Jesus, and History: Critical Appraisals of Critical Views, Volume 1, Symposium series, no. 44, Society of Biblical Literature Pub, 2007 p.77 Bultmann  The hypothesis of the Gospel of John being composed in layers over a period of time originated in the work of Rudolf Bultmann in 1941. Bultmann suggested that the author(s) of John depended in part on an author who wrote an earlier account.Frank E. Peters \\"How to Proceed\\" The Quest: The Historians' Quest for the Historical Jesus and Muhammad, Modern Scholar 2008. This hypothetical \\"Signs Gospel\\" listing Christ's miracles was independent of, and not used by, the synoptic gospels. It was believed to have been circulating before the year 70 AD. Bultmann's conclusion was so controversial that heresy proceedings were instituted against him and his writings. Later scholarship  Nevertheless, this hypothesis has not disappeared. Scholars such as Raymond E. Brown believe the original author of the Signs Gospel to be the Beloved Disciple. They argue that the disciple who formed this community was both a historical person and a companion of Jesus Christ. Brown also suggests that the Beloved Disciple had been a follower of John the Baptist before joining Jesus. Raymond Edward Brown, The Community of the Beloved Disciple, Paulist Press, 1979 pp.31 - 34 It is now widely agreed that the Gospel of John draws upon a tradition of Miracles of Jesus which is substantially independent of the three synoptic gospels.D. Moody Smith (1976), \\"The Setting and Shape of a Johannine Narrative Source\\", in Journal of Biblical Literature, Vol. 95, No. 2 (June 1976), pp. 231-241: \\"Although the evidence is not entirely unambiguous and scholarly opinion is not unanimous, the trend of much recent work is against John's dependence upon the Synoptics\\", accessed 6 February 2016  Robert T. Fortna  Robert Fortna, a member of the Jesus Seminar, argued that there are at least two distinct writing styles contained in the Gospel of John. The later style contains highly developed and sophisticated midrash and theological essays attached superficially - even \\"mechanically\\" at some points - to the former source. The other - earlier - style is the original 2-part Signs Gospel, consisting of a Signs Source (SQ) and a Passion Source (PQ).

However, many features were left out from the original release in an effort to meet the release date. In 2006, they re- released the game as Dungeon Lords Collector's Edition with more complete features. In 2012, after the demise of DreamCatcher Interactive and subsequent acquisition by Nordic Games, they announced the release of a completely \\"remastered\\" version of the game, titled Dungeon Lords MMXII. Dungeon Lords MMXII was released in Europe on September 28, 2012, and in North America on October 5, 2012. In 2015, a version of the game titled Dungeon Lords Steam Edition was released on Steam. Gameplay Dungeon Lords' gameplay features a combat system where weapon combos are controllable by mouse movements. It includes quests, personal missions, skills and special abilities for customizing the character hero from a small set of races and class specializations. Dungeon Lords can be played either single-player stand alone or in multi-player group sessions. The combat was inspired by console fighting games. PlotReception Many gamers experienced extensive problems while playing the original release of the game, including quest items disappearing from inventories, NPCs getting stuck, key quests failing, doors that do not work, etc. The game received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Many reviews criticized the game's initial release as a rushed project, released before it was truly finished. Some have gone so far as to say the game is still in the beta development stage. Steve Carter of Game Over wrote, \\"Dungeon Lords marks a new low for how incomplete a game can be and still get released.\\" Dan Adams of IGN wrote, \\"Dungeon Lords is a disaster. It's an unfinished, unpolished, and un-fun game that I thankfully never have to play again.\\" Greg Kasavin of GameSpot wrote that the game, though fun, is unbalanced and was missing key features at launch. Legacy An Xbox version was planned, but was later cancelled. Dungeon Lords: The Orb and the Oracle, the sequel to Dungeon Lords, was in development with expected release in Q4 2009. It has since been put on hold indefinitely due to market research results and game engine instability. Later the game was cancelled and replaced with Dungeon Lords MMXII.

Steiner (born April 26, 1937, Sibley, Iowa) is a children's advocate and nationally recognized expert on child abuse and neglect, a former chairman of the Orange County, California board of supervisors, founder of both the Orangewood Children's Home, located in Orange, California and the Good Samaritan Boy's Home, in Corona, California, and a former school board member and city councilman for the City of Orange. In addition to his numerous positions as a public official and child advocate in the non-profit sector, he served 16 years on the board of directors for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, based in Alexandria, Virginia. Education and early career Steiner earned his bachelor's degree in criminology from the University of California, Berkeley, and his master's degree in social work from the University of Southern California. While still in his twenties, Steiner founded and became the director of the Good Samaritan Boy's home, which expanded over the years to include a number of group homes across California. Public service In 1985, the Orangewood Children's Home, a public-private partnership, opened its doors to serve as Orange County's transitional shelter for children, after Steiner led efforts to raise $8.5 million for the facility. Steiner served as executive director of the Orangewood Foundation, which over the years has raised over $20 million to address problems of child abuse and neglect in Orange County. California Governor George Deukmejian appointed Steiner to the State Child Development Programs Advisory Committee in 1986, and from 1990 to 1998 he served as a policy advisor to the Cabinet Secretary for Child Development and Education in the Administration of Governor Pete Wilson. He has taught Political Science at the University of California, Irvine, Public Policy at the University of Southern California, and child abuse courses at Chapman University. Steiner has also worked with the California Youth Authority, the Los Angeles Department of Adoptions, Metropolitan State Hospital, and various residential treatment agencies serving abused and neglected children. Steiner served as a delegate from the United States to Poland, Czechoslovakia and the former Soviet Union in 1991. Orange County supervisor In 1993, Steiner was appointed to the Orange County Board of Supervisors, by Governor Pete Wilson, to serve out the term of incumbent Don Roth, ousted by a scandal involving a criminal probe into gifts accepted from local real-estate developers and corporate lobbyists. Steiner was subsequently elected to a four-year term the next year, through January, 1999, serving as Chairman of the Board for 1997. During his tenure, Steiner helped lead the county back from financial disaster after it filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy on December 6, 1994, due to a $1.64-billion collapse in the value of the county's investment portfolio. The bankruptcy was precipitated by investment decisions made largely by county staff prior to Steiner's tenure on the board. In its wake, Steiner survived an aborted recall effort. Semi-retirement At the end of his elected term on the Orange County board of supervisors, in 1999, Steiner moved to Scottsdale, Arizona for four years to become the national program director for Childhelp USA, serving there until 2003. While in Arizona, Steiner oversaw the conversion of Merv Griffin's 192 acre (0.7 km¬≤) Wickenberg Inn & Dude Ranch, located in Wickenburg, into the Merv Griffin Village of Arizona, a treatment center for abused kids. Also in 1999, Steiner joined with Florida based partners, Bill Hebrock and Daryl McLaughlin, to form Hebrock Steiner McLaughlin, Inc., a public policy consulting and lobbying firm. Steiner has been involved in business and cultural exchanges with the People's Republic of China, and travels there frequently to develop public/private partnerships for the firm's clients. He is also an investor in, and vice chairman of, Zhao International, Inc., an international exporting company which exports scrap metal to Tianjin, China, a 'sister city' of Orange. Steiner has served on the Juvenile Justice Commission for several years, having been appointed by the presiding judge of the Superior Court. Personal Steiner is the father of five children, including Orange County judge Scott Steiner, and grandfather of sixteen. Recognition Steiner has been named Child Advocate of the Year by the California Court Appointed Advocates, and Citizen of the Year by the City of Orange. In 1989, he was awarded the Commissioner's Award for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect by the US Department of Health and Human Services. In 1992, he was named Outstanding Elected Official by the Orange County Chapter of the American Society of Public Administrators. In October 2019, Steiner was honored with the Orangewood Foundation‚Äôs ‚ÄúCrystal Vision‚Äù award, acknowledging his lifetime of service to abused and neglected children.

Part of the National Wildlife Refuge system, the park is a popular destination for bird watchers and tourists. About 85 percent of the refuge's is freshwater wetlands. Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge United States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Department of the Interior. Retrieved January 1, 2007.  History  The original Concord, Massachusetts parcel that was the beginning nucleus of the sanctuary, has been known as the \\"Great Meadows\\" since the 17th century. The parcel was donated to the U.S. Government by Concord resident Samuel Hoar in 1944. Hoar purchased a part of the Meadows in 1928, and built earthen dams (dikes) to hold the water within the marshlands, enhancing their value as waterfowl habitat for hunting. To provide greater protection for the area‚Äôs wetlands and wildlife, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began buying additional land during the 1960s.  Wildlife and protected species  A great diversity of birds have been recorded at the refuge, including nesting waterfowl: mallards, black ducks, wood ducks, and blue-winged teal. White-tailed deer, muskrats, red fox, raccoons, cottontail rabbits, weasels, beaver, squirrels, and a variety of small mammals are common. Many species of amphibians and reptiles are active during the warmer months. The Concord unit is primarily two small lakes (referred to as \\"pools\\" or \\"impoundments\\") that are drained into the Concord River every summer. The resulting mudflats provide ideal feeding grounds for many species of shore birds and waterfowl that migrate in mid to late summer. In late July and in August, there will be wide range of birds at these feeding grounds, including various species of sandpipers, killdeer, lesser and greater yellowlegs, and great egrets. Large numbers of great blue herons, ducks and Canada geese are also attracted to these muddy and nutrient-rich feeding grounds.  Access and facilities  Bird watchers in Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge The Sudbury unit of the refuge includes the headquarters and a visitor center. It is located in Sudbury, Massachusetts and is open weekdays. The Concord unit is open daily from dawn to dusk; it includes of trails.

Not all central force fields are conservative or spherically symmetric. However, a central force is conservative if and only if it is spherically symmetric. Properties Central forces that are conservative can always be expressed as the negative gradient of a potential energy:- : \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = - \\\\mathbf{ abla} V(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\text{, where }V(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{r}}^{+\\\\infin} F(r)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}r (the upper bound of integration is arbitrary, as the potential is defined up to an additive constant). In a conservative field, the total mechanical energy (kinetic and potential) is conserved: :E = \\\\frac{1}{2} m \\\\mathbf{\\\\dot{r}}^2 + V(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\text{constant} (where ·πô denotes the derivative of r with respect to time, that is the velocity), and in a central force field, so is the angular momentum: :\\\\mathbf{L} = \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\times m\\\\mathbf{\\\\dot{r}} = \\\\text{constant} because the torque exerted by the force is zero. As a consequence, the body moves on the plane perpendicular to the angular momentum vector and containing the origin, and obeys Kepler's second law. (If the angular momentum is zero, the body moves along the line joining it with the origin.) It can also be shown that an object that moves under the influence of any central force obeys Kepler's second law. However, the first and third laws depend on the inverse-square nature of Newton's law of universal gravitation and do not hold in general for other central forces. As a consequence of being conservative, these specific central force fields are irrotational, that is, its curl is zero, except at the origin: : abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{F} (\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\mathbf{0}\\\\text{.} Examples Gravitational force and Coulomb force are two familiar examples with F( \\\\mathbf{r} ) being proportional to 1/r2 only. An object in such a force field with negative F( \\\\mathbf{r} ) (corresponding to an attractive force) obeys Kepler's laws of planetary motion. The force field of a spatial harmonic oscillator is central with F( \\\\mathbf{r} ) proportional to r only and negative. By Bertrand's theorem, these two, F( \\\\mathbf{r} ) = -k/r^2 and F( \\\\mathbf{r} ) = -kr , are the only possible central force fields where all bounded orbits are stable closed orbits. However, there exist other force fields, which have some closed orbits. Notes This article uses the definition of central force given in Taylor. Another common definition (used in ScienceWorld ) adds the constraint that the force be spherically symmetric, i.e. \\\\vec{F} = \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = F( \\\\mathbf{r} ) \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}} .

Initially associated with the Peronist right, the organisation opposed the Peronist left and other leftist organizations. The AAA acted against a wide range of government opponents, not just communists. The Triple A allegedly was secretly led by Jos√© L√≥pez Rega, Minister of Social Welfare and personal secretary of Juan Per√≥n. Rodolfo Almir√≥n, arrested in Spain in 2006, was alleged to be his chief operating officer of the group, and was officially head of L√≥pez Rega's and Isabel Per√≥n's personal security. He was extradited from Spain in 2006 and prosecuted; he died in jail in June 2009. SIDE agent Anibal Gordon was another important member of the Triple A, although he always denied it. He was tried in Argentina in 1985 after the restoration of democracy and convicted in October 1986. Gordon died in prison of lung cancer the next year.\\"Qui√©n fue An√≠bal Gordon?\\" (Who was Anibal Gordon), Clar√≠n, 14 October In 2006, Argentine Judge Norberto Oyarbide ruled the Triple A had committed \\"crimes against humanity,\\" which meant their crimes were exempt from statutes of limitations. Suspects can be prosecuted for actions committed in the 1970s and early 1980s. Creation The Triple A was believed to have been organized in 1973 by Jos√© L√≥pez Rega and Alberto Villar, deputy chief of the Argentine federal police, during the brief interim presidency of Ra√∫l Lastiri in 1973. Reportedly, the movement was conceived at a high-level Peronist meeting on October 1, 1973, attended by President Ra√∫l Lastiri, Interior Minister Benito Llamb√≠, Social Welfare Minister Jos√© L√≥pez Rega, general secretary of the Presidency Jos√© Humberto Martiarena and various provincial governors.Manuel Justo Gaggero, ‚ÄúEl general en su laberinto‚Äù, Pagina/12, 19 February 2007 The group operated under the governments of Lastiri, Per√≥n and Isabel Per√≥n through L√≥pez Rega resignation and exile in July 1975. Villar and his wife were murdered in 1974 with a bomb that was planted on his cabin cruiser in Tigre by members of the Montoneros, a militant, leftist group. L√≥pez Rega, a devotee of occultism and self-styled divinator, became a powerful force in the Peronist movement. He exerted great influence over Per√≥n, who was elected to the presidency and took office in 1973, and his wife Isabel Mart√≠nez de Per√≥n, elected as vice-president, who succeeded to the presidency upon Per√≥n's sudden death on 1 July 1974. To support the paramilitary group, L√≥pez Rega drew on funds from the Ministry of Social Welfare, which he controlled.\\"Un juez argentino ordena capturar al ex jefe de la 'Triple A', que vive en Valencia\\" (An Argentine judge ordered the capture of the ex-chief of 'Triple A', who lives in Valencia, El Mundo, December 20, 2006 Some of the members of the Triple A had earlier taken part in the Peronist 1973 Ezeiza massacre. On the day Per√≥n returned from exile, snipers shot and killed numerous (13 at least killed) left-wing Peronists at the mass gathering to welcome his return, leading to the definitive separation between left and right-wing Peronists. The Spanish Judge Baltazar Garz√≥n's investigations, directed at human rights abuses internationally, revealed that Italian neofascist Stefano Delle Chiaie had also worked with the Triple A, and was present at Ezeiza. Delle Chiaie also worked with the Chilean DINA in Chile, and for Hugo Banzer, a Bolivian dictator. According to a 1983 article in The New York Times, the group was founded when there were an increasing number of guerrilla attacks by left-wing militant groups, which were met by harsh repression of political dissidents on the part of the military, paramilitary and police forces. This environment of social unrest was the justification used by the subsequent military junta for its Dirty War against political opponents. But testimony at the 1985 Juicio a las Juntas trial established that by 1976, both the ERP and the Montoneros had been dismantled, and the political dissidents had never posed a real threat to the government. Victims The group first came to national attention on 21 November 1973 in its attempt to murder Argentine Senator Hip√≥lito Solari Yrigoyen by a car bomb. The AAA went on to kill 1,122 people, according to an appendix to the 1983 CONADEP report, including suspected Montoneros and ERP leftist terrorists and their sympathizers, but the group expanded its targets to other political opponents, including judges, police chiefs, and social activists. In total, it is suspected of having killed more than 1500 people.\\"Justicia argentina conden√≥ delitos de la Triple A\\" (Argentine justice condemned crimes of Triple A) , Agencia Pulsar, 27 December 2006, URL accessed on January 4, 2007 The group is strongly suspected in the 1974 assassination of Jesuit priest Carlos Mugica, a friend of Mario Firmenich, the founder of Montoneros. Other people murdered by the organisation include Silvio Frondizi, brother of former president Arturo Frondizi; Julio Troxler, former-vice director of the police; Alfredo Curutchet, a defense attorney for political prisoners; and Hip√≥lito Atilio L√≥pez, a key union leader of C√≥rdoba. The CONADEP commission on human rights violations documented the Triple A's execution of 19 homicides in 1973, 50 in 1974 and 359 in 1975, while its involvement in several hundred others is also suspected. The 1986 study by Ignacio Jansen Gonz√°lez is often cited; he estimates the group committed 220 terrorist attacks from July to September 1974, which killed 60 and severely wounded 44; as well as 20 kidnappings.Gonz√°lez Jansen, Ignacio (1986), La Triple A, Buenos Aires, Contrapunto.

The object is to destroy the mutants aliens and, most importantly, the Mother Creature. The mutants hatch from moving eggs at the top of the screen. Because the Mother Creature replenishes eggs when they hatch or are destroyed, it must be defeated before the player can advance to the next wave. If a mutant or a bomb thrown by a mutant comes into contact with the cannon, the cannon will be destroyed and a reserve must be called up. A new cannon is awarded on every other wave. Game options An in-game menu allows a variety of gameplay changes. The player may toggle the shield option on or off.

He was a distinctive singer and an accomplished musician who played autoharp, banjo, fiddle, dulcimer, guitar, mouth harp, mandolin, dobro, jaw harp, and pan pipes. Seeger, a half-brother of Pete Seeger, produced more than 30 documentary recordings, and performed in more than 40 other recordings. He desired to make known the caretakers of culture that inspired and taught him. Family and early life Seeger was born in New York and grew up in Maryland and Washington D.C. His father, Charles Louis Seeger Jr., was a composer and pioneering ethnomusicologist, investigating both American folk and non-Western music. His mother, Ruth Crawford Seeger, was a composer.1911 New York Times wedding announcement for Charles Louis Seeger and Ruth Crawford Seeger. His eldest half-brother, Charles Seeger III, was a radio astronomer, and his next older half-brother, John Seeger, taught for years at the Dalton School in Manhattan. His next older half brother was Pete Seeger. His uncle, Alan Seeger, the poet who wrote \\"I have a rendezvous with Death\\", was killed during the First World War. Seeger was a self-taught musician who began playing stringed instruments at the age of 18. He also sang Sacred Harp with British folk singer Ewan MacColl and his son, Calum. Seeger's sister Peggy Seeger, also a well-known folk performer, had married Ewan, and his sister Penny had wed John Cohen, a member of Mike's musical group, New Lost City Ramblers.A Vision Shared, Austin Chronicle, weeklywire.com, 18 August 1997. Retrieved on May 2, 2009. The family moved to Washington D.C. in 1936 after his father's appointment to the music division of the Resettlement Administration. While in Washington D.C., Ruth Seeger worked closely with John and Alan Lomax at the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress to preserve and teach American folk music. Ruth Seeger's arrangements and interpretations of American Traditional folk songs in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s are well regarded. Musical career At about the age of 20, Mike Seeger began collecting songs by traditional musicians on a tape recorder. Folk musicians such as Lead Belly, Woody Guthrie, John Jacob Niles, and others were frequent guests in the Seeger home. In 1958 he co-founded the New Lost City Ramblers, an old-time string band in New York City, during the Folk Revival. The other founding members included John Cohen and Tom Paley. Paley later left the group in 1962 and was replaced by Tracy Schwarz. The New Lost City Ramblers directly influenced countless musicians in subsequent years. The Ramblers distinguished themselves by focusing on the traditional playing styles they heard on old 78rpm records of musicians recorded during the 1920s and 1930s. Tracy was also in Mike's other band, Strange Creek Singers. So was Mike's former wife, Alice Gerrard. She was Alice Seeger in that band and sang and played guitar in it. The other people in Strange Creek Singers were bass player and singer Hazel Dickens and banjo player Lamar Grier. Mike sang and played guitar, banjo, fiddle, mandolin, autoharp, and harmonica in the band. Seeger received six Grammy nominations and was the recipient of four grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, including a 2009 National Heritage Fellowship, which is the United States' highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. His influence on the folk scene was described by Bob Dylan in his autobiography, Chronicles: Volume One. He was a popular presenter and performer at traditional music gatherings such as Breakin' Up Winter. Eight days before his 76th birthday, Mike Seeger died at his home in Lexington, Virginia, on August 7, 2009, after stopping cancer treatment. The Mike Seeger Collection, which includes original sound and video recordings by Mike Seeger, is located in the Southern Folklife Collection of the Wilson Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

He was one of the first American artists to take up Impressionism in the late 1880s, visiting Giverny and developing a close friendship with Claude Monet. Several of his works are considered masterpieces of American Impressionism.  Training and early career  Robinson in 1882 Robinson was born in Irasburg, Vermont. His family moved to Evansville, Wisconsin, and Robinson briefly studied art in Chicago. In 1874 he journeyed to New York City to attend classes at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League.. In 1876 he traveled to Paris to study under Carolus-Duran and at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, with Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me. He first exhibited his paintings at the 1877 Salon in Paris, and spent the summer of that year at Grez-sur-Loing. After trips to Venice and Bologna, he returned to the United States in 1879 for several years. In 1881 he moved into a studio in New York and became a professional painter and art teacher. During this time Robinson painted in a realist manner, loosely brushed but not yet impressionistic, often depicting people engaged in quiet domestic or agrarian pursuits.  Giverny  La Vach√®re (ca. 1888) Smithsonian American Art Museum In 1884 Robinson returned to France where he lived for the next eight years, visiting America only occasionally. Robinson gravitated to Giverny, which had become a center of French impressionist art under the influence of Claude Monet. Historians are unclear when Robinson met Monet, but by 1888 their friendship was enough for Robinson to move in next door to the famous impressionist. Robinson's art shifted to a more traditional impressionistic manner during this time, likely due to Monet's influence. While a number of American artists had gathered at Giverny, none were as close to Monet as Robinson. Monet offered advice to Robinson, and he likewise solicited Robinson for opinions on Monet's own works in progress. Not only did he take to heart Monet¬¥s theoretical admonitions and his requirement to portray the beauties and mystery of nature in a manner stringently truthful to one's personal vision, but he also studied works that were available to him in \\"The Master¬¥s\\" studio. For instance, Capri, painted in 1890, was probably inspired by Monet¬¥s paintings of the cliffs at Varengeville, Pourville, and Etretat and the rocks at Bell-Ile of the early 1880s. At Giverny, Robinson painted what art historians regard as some of his finest works. These depicted the surrounding countryside in different weather, in the plein air tradition, sometimes with women shown in leisurely poses. An example of his mature work during this period is La D√©b√¢cle (1892) in the collection of Scripps College, Claremont California.  Return to America  La D√©b√¢cle 1892 Robinson left France and Monet for the final time in 1892, although he meant to return. Back in America, Robinson obtained a teaching post with the Brooklyn Art School and conducted summer classes in Napanoch, New York, near the Catskill Mountains, where he painted several canal scenes. He also taught at Evelyn College in Princeton, New Jersey, and later at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. With New York City as his base, Robinson circulated among a growing number of American artists pursuing Impressionism. He was particularly close to John Henry Twachtman and Julian Alden Weir, and spent time at the nearby Cos Cob Art Colony in Connecticut. There he painted a series of boat scenes at the Riverside Yacht Club which have come to be regarded as among his finest works. While his reputation as an important American Impressionist was growing, Robinson still needed to teach to support himself. He also harbored doubts about the quality of his work. Throughout his career, Theodore Robinson kept meticulous diaries, but only the last several years of the diaries are known to exist. These are in the collection of the Frick Art Reference Library in New York and available to scholars. The art historian Sona Johnson, of the Baltimore Museum of Art, plans to publish an annotated edition of the Robinson diaries.  Final years  Nantucket, 1882 In the last year of his life he was asked to contribute to the book of essays titled Modern French Masters by the editor and art historian John Charles Van Dyke. He wrote an essay on the Barbizon painter Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and, because of his friendship with the French Impressionist, he wrote and illustrated the essay on Claude Monet. The book was published in 1896 and his illustration of Monet was featured in the exhibition \\"In Monet's Light.\\" In 1895, Robinson enjoyed a productive period in Vermont, and in February 1896 he wrote to Monet about returning to Giverny, but in April he died of an acute asthma attack in New York City. He was buried in his hometown of Evansville, Wisconsin. He was 43 years old., a review of the exhibition In Monet's Light: Theodore Robinson at Giverny. Today Robinson's paintings are in the collections of many major museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City; the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; and the Art Institute of Chicago.

He was given a five-year term appointment of Harvard College Professor, which recognizes excellence in undergraduate teaching. He holds a joint appointment in the economics department and in Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and the Harvard School of Public Health, is a faculty member for the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies, and serves as commissioner on the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission. Cutler graduated from Harvard College, summa cum laude, with a degree in Economics, and then joined the Harvard faculty after receiving his Ph.D. in Economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1991.Harvard Econ Department David Cutler: CV He served in the administration of Bill Clinton and was the senior health care advisor to Barack Obama.Obama's economic advisers are brainy academics Kevin G. Hall, April 4, 2008 From 2003 to 2008, Cutler was Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences for Social Sciences. While his work on health economics covers a broad range of subtopics, he is particularly notable for his work on the value of the health care system as a whole. Much of his work argues that the United States has realized good \\"bang for its buck\\" by any reasonable measure of the value of a statistical year of life in good health: health care there is extremely expensive, but Americans also place a very high value on documentable health gains. He also argues that they could gain considerably more health for the dollar if reimbursement for care were tied to the health value of the service instead of the intensity of the service. His book Your Money or Your Life gives an introduction on the US health care system. The book and Cutler's ideas were the subject of an article in the New York Times Magazine, \\"The Quality Cure\\". Professor Cutler published a book with the same title in 2014 which details how \\"Focusing on Health Care Quality Can Save Your Life and Lower Spending Too.\\" Cutler's 2003 study \\"Why have Americans become more obese?\\" discusses rising obesity as an outcome of the revolution in mass food packaging. He includes vacuum packing, improved preservatives, deep freezing, and microwaves as culprits. Consumer prices on items like various frozen foods, soda, and potato chips are increasing at half the rate of fresh fruits and vegetables, and mass preparation makes for lower costs and more food consumption. Calories expended, however, changed little. Accordingly, Cutler posits that the 20 min average reduced time of food preparation has resulted in an average increase of 100 Cal per day per individual. The extra 100 Cal can largely account for a weight gain of 10-12 lb in the American population over the past 20 years. Movement of individuals across health care plans An article, ‚Ä≥Selection Stories: Understanding Movement across Health Plans,‚Ä≥ was written by Cutler, Bryan Lincoln, and Richard Zeckhauser and published in the Journal of Health Economics in 2010. It explored why some employees who participate in employee-sponsored insurance programs change enrollment status between Health Maintenance Organization-managed care and fee for service options. The authors theorized that there are three different health insurance selection processes that individuals engage in that influence personal insurance selection, which include backward-looking selection, adverse retention, and aging in place. Backward-looking selection is explained as past experiences influencing the level of insurance acquired by an individual. For example, someone who became severely ill and did not have enough insurance coverage might seek out more insurance coverage, as a result of the previous experience. Adverse retention refers to both those choosing to maintain the current level of coverage when they are ill and the unlikelihood of the individual switching insurance plans the more they are ill. Aging in place refers to someone remaining on the same plan for life because insurance provided is sufficient and the cost of switching is too high. The study conducted analyses by creating models based on data from the Massachusetts state employee health insurance programs. The data was aggregated by HMO and FFS. Based on the analyses and modeling, adverse selection and adverse retention were very small compared to the projected impact from premium increases for enrollees. In other words, as premiums increase, enrollment in FFS dramatically decreased. That finding was also demonstrated in a literature review published by the RAND corporation. Although there is little difference in terms of selection effects between HMOs and FFS since the enrollee pays a small portion of marginal costs, Cutler contends that adverse selection (less- healthy individuals moving from more restrictive HMO to less-restrictive and more-costly FFS plans) has a greater impact than adverse retention on enrollees' choice of health plans. In summary, movement from adverse selection and adverse retention is minimal, but it is highly correlated and concentrated in the older and less healthy population, favoring HMO plans by their lower premiums and economic stability. Overall, adverse selection and retention are not critical factors in adjusting risk for health care plans, but demographics such as sex and age seem to be significant in spending patterns and differences in plan choices. The article explored the trends and rationale behind the shift from FFS to HMO. In terms of overall quality of care provided, based on the type of health insurance, current literature suggest that the quality of care does not differ between HMO and FFS plans. The article is timely in that it is relevant to the overall shift towards managed care in an effort to reduce health care costs, without reducing quality of care. In addition, it is relevant to the current discussions concerning the possibility of having competitive choice health insurance plans based upon risk adjustments.

Bunch is currently the founding director and senior scholar at the Center for Women's Global Leadership at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. She is also a distinguished professor in the Department of Women's and Gender Studies at Rutgers.\\"Faculty: Bunch, Charlotte\\". Department of Women's and Gender Studies. Rutgers University. Retrieved April 22, 2017.  Biography  Bunch, one of four children to Charles Pardue Bunch and Marjorie Adelaide (King) Bunch, was born in West Jefferson, North Carolina. That same year, her family moved to Artesia, New Mexico. She attended public schools in Artesia before enrolling at Duke University in 1962. She was a history major at Duke and graduated magna cum laude in 1966, and was involved with many groups such as the Young Women's Christian Association and the Methodist Student Movement. Bunch has said that she participated in \\"pray-ins\\" organized by the Methodist Student Movement at Duke University, but later took a \\"break\\" from Christianity because of the homophobia within the religion. She has been extremely active in political movements for decades and is openly lesbian. She found inspiration for being a women's and human rights activist through her family's dedication to \\"activism as good works.\\"  Career  Shortly after graduating from Duke University, Bunch became a youth delegate to the World Council of Churches Conference on Church and Society in Geneva, Switzerland. That same year she became president of the University Christian Movement in Washington D.C. for one year. Following this position, Bunch became a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington D.C., and she founded the Washington D.C. publications, Women's Liberation and Quest: A Feminist Quarterly. Through inspiration from Black Nationalism, Bunch took part in founding The Furies Collective, a group that published its first newspaper, The Furies, in January 1972. The goal was to give a voice to lesbian separatism. While the collective only survived for about one year, the home of the Furies Collective later was named the first lesbian-related historic landmark in Washington D.C., and became the first lesbian site on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1977, Bunch became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. She participated in or facilitated numerous international workshops and conferences, and from 1979 to 1980 she was a consultant to the secretariat for the World Conference for the United Nations Decade on Women which was hosted by WIFP. In 1989, she founded the Center for Women's Global Leadership at Douglass College, Rutgers University, of which she remains the founding director and senior scholar. She was succeeded as executive director by Radhika Balakrishnan in September 2009. The Center for Women's Global Leadership (CWGL) lobbied the United Nations and the international community to view women's rights as a human rights issue. CWGL is a component of the Gender Equality Architecture Reform (GEAR) Campaign, working towards the establishment of a new United Nations Gender Entity that works for equality for all of the world's women. Bunch has been a major voice for this campaign. The gender entity was finally created after four years of advocacy on July 2, 2010, and deemed UN Women. At its 20th-anniversary symposium on March 6, 2010, following panel discussions on body, economy, and movement, CWGL organized a tribute to its founder, Charlotte Bunch, who transitioned on September 1, 2009 from her role as executive director to working with CWGL in her new capacity as founding director and senior scholar. Attendees watched a short preview of the then-upcoming documentary film Passionate Politics: The Life & Work of Charlotte Bunch (2011), directed by Tami Gold, which chronicles Bunch's lifelong personal and political commitment to women's human rights. The Center for Women's Global Leadership launched the Charlotte Bunch Women's Human Rights Strategic Opportunities Fund in recognition of her contributions to the global women's human rights movement. She has served on the boards of numerous organizations and is currently a member of the Advisory Committee for the Human Rights Watch Women's Rights Division, and on the boards of the Global Fund for Women and the International Council on Human Rights Policy. She has been a consultant to many United Nations bodies and recently served on the Advisory Committee for the Secretary General's 2006 Report to the General Assembly on Violence against Women. She has also voiced her support for the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reform in the United Nations. Awards and recognition Bunch in 2011 In October 1996, Bunch was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. In December 1999 she was selected by United States President Bill Clinton as a recipient of the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights. She received the \\"Women Who Make a Difference Award\\" from the National Council for Research on Women in 2000, and was honored as one of the \\"21 Leaders for the 21st Century\\" by Women's eNews in 2002, and also received the \\"Board of Trustees Awards for Excellence in Research\\" in 2006 at Rutgers University. * 2008 Joyce Warshow Lifetime Achievement Award SAGE (Services and Advocacy for LGBT Elders) * 2008 Rutgers College Class of 1962 Presidential Public Service Award Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey * 2007 Honorary degree of Doctor of Laws University of Connecticut * 2006 Board of Trustees Award for Excellence in Research Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey * 2004 New Jersey Honorary United Nations Day Chair Appointed by the Governor of New Jersey * 2002 Board of Governors Distinguished Service Professor Recipient Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey * 2002 Women Who Make a Difference Award International Women's Forum * 2002 21 Leaders for the 21st Century Women's Enews * 2001 Spirit of American Women Award Girls Incorporated of Central New York * 2000 Women Who Make a Difference Award National Council for Research on Women * 1999 Church Women United Human Rights Award Church Women United * 1999 Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights President William Jefferson Clinton * 1998 The Hubert H.

The original MƒÅori name of the locality was Mokoreta (clear or sweet water). The name \\"Wyndham\\" was first used in the district when John Anderson named his runs 161 and 162 Upper Windham Station and Lower Windham Station in 1857. The name was soon mis-spelt to its more common form and the Mokoreta river also became known as the Wyndham river. The town was then named in 1869 for the adjacent river, so indirectly named for General Sir Charles Ash Windham who fought in the Crimean War. The streets are in turn named for events, places, battles and personalities from that war. The town was initially surveyed in 1869 and gazetted a town district in 1882. Wyndham is situated on the east banks of the Mataura River, between the Mimihau Stream to the north and the Wyndham (Mokoreta) River to the south. Protected now by a floodbank, Wyndham is a service centre for the surrounding districts with a shopping centre, library, museum and hotel. For eighty years, it was served by the Wyndham Branch railway which provided a connection with the Main South Line, and for forty years, an extension past Wyndham was operated to Glenham. Wyndham has a primary school, Wyndham Primary School, whose principal is Kim Scott and educates students between year zero and year six. Situated directly beside the primary school is Menzies College, Wyndham's secondary school. Menzies College has approximately 300 students who range from year seven to year 13. The current principal is Gerry Ward. A recreational area has a golf course, race course, rugby ground, softball diamond, bowling green, tennis/netball courts and camping ground. Brown trout fishing is within walking distance as well. The town used to host the Wyndham street races as part of the Burt Monro Challenge, Wyndham one day street racing event of the week-long calendar. The biggest current gathering of motorcycle enthusiasts in the Southern Hemisphere. Wyndham originally had a dairy factory established in 1885 and a flax milling factory named The Field-Gibson Flax Milling Company established in 1903, but these have both long since closed.

The mall was built by Sonny Abramson and Ted Lerner of Lerner Enterprises, and opened in 1972. Like its neighbor, Capital Plaza Mall, it was a major attraction through its opening years in Prince George's County. The mall featured many anchors and smaller tenants; however, upon the decline and closing of its major anchors, the mall itself entered a state of decline. Finally, in 2002, the mall's doors were closed and it ultimately was demolished in 2006. Sears remained open because it owned the land beneath the store. Sears later sold the land underneath its store to Lerner. In January 2014 Sears announced that it would close in March.Sears, final vestige of Landover Mall, to close in March Washington Post, January 6, 2014  History =Fountains The mall had three fountains, one adjacent to Hecht's, Sears, and in center court. According to an article in the Washington Post published the day of the mall's grand opening, the Hecht's \\"The water display consists of seven 3\\" geysers that are programmed in continuously changing programs of water height (3' to 15') for the perimeter nozzles, and the center nozzle can push the water to a height of 30' if desirable. All splash will be contained in the perimeter six geysers.\\" The main fountain in the mall contained three circular platforms, each representing a loop within the Capital Beltway interchange at Landover Road. During the holiday season the center ring fountains would be shut off and replaced with its annual secular Holiday displays, which featured gingerbread house, fairies, candy canes, snowmen, reindeer, sleigh ride, doves and a \\"Cupcake Boat Ride\\", but no Santa or explicit references to Christmas.https://www.flickr.com/photos/29067476@N05/sets/72157622508742335/with/4032517198/ Toys For Tots once did a charity event where they would go fishing in the fountain. Prime and downfall In its prime, Landover Mall had three local department store anchors: Hecht's, Garfinckel's, Woodward & Lothrop (Woodies), and two national chains, Sears and F. W. Woolworth Company. It was the first mall in the region to have four anchors until Fair Oaks Mall opened in 1980. There was a six-screen theater in the basement, which had its own escalators, but it closed in 1991. In 1990, Garfinckel's filed for bankruptcy and went out of business. The former Garfinckel's anchor store was never replaced. Five years later, Woodies went out of business. JCPenney moved into the former Woodies location but found business unprofitable. The store was converted to a JCPenney outlet location in fall 1998 and was closed altogether in early 2001. In early 2002, Hecht's closed after opening a new store at Bowie Town Center in nearby Bowie, Maryland. Closure and demolition After the closure of the main anchors to the mall, Ted Lerner decided to shut the mall down completely. The mall's doors were sealed shut with cinder blocks, although the Sears store remained open. Demolition began in 2006, and was completed in early 2007. The entire mall was demolished, and its aftermath was recycled. Sears was the only store that remained open after the mall's closure because it owned the land on which the building stood. However, its former entrances to the mall were sealed shut on both its levels. Sears subsequently sold the land underneath the store to Lerner. In January 2014 Sears announced that it would not renew its lease with Lerner and closed its store in March. Today In 2014 the FBI announced they were looking at possibly purchasing the land for a future FBI Headquarters after the acquisition of Sears land, but this fell through and in October 2018, Lerner put the whole site, with the Sears now demolished, up for sale. it is still on the market.  Demolition aftermath  The mall before it was demolished in 2002 Sears was tentatively planning on relocating to the Ritchie Station Marketplace shopping center on Ritchie Road near Capitol Heights, Maryland. The area of the former mall and parking lot is now fenced off and barricaded with cement blocks. Landover Mall's main entrance sign has been modified to eliminate its stylized cloverleaf logo shape with the remaining part of the sign and pedestal refurbished to new-like appearance and saying \\"Home to Future Development\\".

G. Wodehouse, all with a golfing theme. It was first published in the United Kingdom on 3 February 1922 by Herbert Jenkins Ltd of London. It was later published in the United States by George H. Doran of New York on 28 May 1924 under the title Golf Without Tears.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 38‚Äì39, A27. The short stories were originally published in magazines between 1919 and 1922. There are some slight differences between the two editions, chiefly as regards the names of characters, places, and famous golfers, which were adapted to suit the country of publication. The first story in the collection introduces the Oldest Member, a repeat Wodehouse character, who narrates all but the last story. Contents=\\"The Clicking of Cuthbert\\" 1921 illustration by Wilmot Lunt for \\"The Clicking of Cuthbert\\" in The Strand Magazine * UK: Strand, October 1921 (as \\"The Unexpected Clicking of Cuthbert\\") * US: Elk's Magazine, July 1922 (as \\"Cuthbert Unexpectedly Clicks\\") As with most of the stories in the collection, the UK version of the story is set in England, while the US version is set in the United States. ;Plot The Oldest Member (of a golf club with varying names) sees a young man giving up his clubs because he thinks golf is waste of time. To show the young man that playing golf can be useful, the Oldest Member tells him the following story about Cuthbert Banks. In the suburb of Wood Hills, there is a divide between the Cultured, the intellectuals of the Wood Hills Literary and Debating Society, and the Golfers, the members of the local golf club. Mrs Emily Smethurst, president of the literary society, wants the neighbourhood to be cultured and disapproves of the golf club. The society's meeting place is near the golf course, and their sudden applause during a novelist's lecture causes golfer J. Cuthbert Banks to accidentally hit his ball into the room onto a table. He apologetically comes in to play the ball where it lies, and falls in love with Mrs Smethurst's niece, Adeline. He eventually proposes to her but she turns him down, since she is ambitious and, feeling she is too ordinary herself to be noteworthy, wants to marry someone noteworthy. Cuthbert is a skilled golfer and won the French Open Championship the previous year, but Adeline does not consider this a noteworthy achievement. She admires Raymond Parsloe Devine, the novelist who gave the lecture. Cuthbert joins the society to please Adeline, but she continues to adore Devine. Vladimir Brusiloff, a famous Russian writer of dreary novels, is in the country on a lecturing tour and comes to Wood Hills, to the delight of Mrs Smethurst and her society. Brusiloff, tired of giving lectures and meeting aspiring writers, is in a bad mood when Mrs Smethurst introduces him to Devine. Devine says he was greatly influenced by Russian writers named Sovietski and Nastikoff, but Brusiloff coldly remarks that they are no good. Devine's prestige in the literary society is immediately shattered and he slinks away. Adeline loses all her respect for him. Brusiloff mentions that he wants to meet the golfers Abe Mitchell and Harry Vardon. (Walter Hagen and Jock Hutchison in the US version of the story.) Cuthbert mentions that he knows them. Brusiloff recognizes Cuthbert's name and is honoured to meet him, since he won the French Open. Adeline now admires Cuthbert. She marries him and becomes a fan of golf. Devine had to leave the neighbourhood and is now writing scenarios for films in California. As the Oldest Member is finishing the story, his listener rushes out to get back his clubs. \\"A Woman is Only a Woman\\" * US: Saturday Evening Post, 7 June 1919 * UK: Strand, October 1919 In this story, the golf club is called the Woodhaven Golf Club in the Strand version, and the Manhooset Golf Club in the Saturday Evening Post version. ;Plot From the terrace in front of the golf club, the Oldest Member sees Peter Willard and James Todd playing golf together, and tells the following story about them. Peter and James are close friends who regularly play golf together. Both have little skill at golf but greatly enjoy the game. However, their relationship becomes strained when they both fall in love with Grace Forrester. Grace seems to like them equally. Since they are always around Grace at the same time, James and Peter believe that they have got each other stymied by preventing each other from wooing her, so they agree to decide the matter with an eighteen-hole match. The loser will stay away from Grace long enough for the winner to have a chance to court her. In their match, Peter and James play about the same, both sometimes playing well and sometimes worse. After the ninth hole, James takes a short break, claiming he needs to get a few more balls, though he is actually looking at his golf book for tips. When James joins Peter on the tenth tee, Peter announces he is forfeiting the match and says that James is free to propose to Grace. James thanks him and goes to talk to Grace, who plays tennis nearby. He talks to her in detail about golf, and is shocked when Grace says she finds golf boring and silly. James is revolted and rejoins Peter. Peter says he had spoken to Grace a few minutes before and also heard her feelings about golf. They are glad they found out in time and plan to play golf more often together. James tells Peter about his golf book and invites James to read it. They clasp hands and are close friends again. \\"A Mixed Threesome\\" * US: McClure's, June 1920 * UK: Strand, March 1921 ;Plot A golfer at the club is annoyed by children playing on the course and says golf should only be played by adults. The Oldest Member disagrees and argues that golf, like measles, should be caught young. If not, a golfer who starts playing later in life may become too absorbed in the game too quickly. He tells the story of Mortimer Sturgis to illustrate his point. The Oldest Member's friend Betty Weston, who plays golf, is engaged to 38-year-old Mortimer Sturgis, who is not a golfer but is amiable and has independent means. Eddie Denton, Mortimer's best friend, is an explorer and returns from Central Africa. Betty admires bravery and is fascinated by Eddie. Soon, she has fallen in love with him, and goes to the Oldest Member for advice. Eddie returns Betty's feelings but neither of them want to hurt Mortimer. The Oldest Member gets an idea. He will lie to Mortimer that Betty is a kleptomaniac so he will not want to marry her. Betty thanks the Oldest Member for his help. Mortimer is learning golf from the Oldest Member for Betty's sake. Initially, Mortimer dislikes the game, but he begins to enjoy it after he starts playing better. The Oldest Member tells Mortimer that Betty is a kleptomaniac, but this fails to change Mortimer's opinion of her. Mortimer quickly becomes extremely devoted to golf, and as a result he spends less time with Betty. When Betty complains that he is neglecting her, Mortimer only talks more about golf. Hurt, Betty ends their engagement. Mortimer recovers quickly from this and remains focused on golf. Betty and Eddie are now happily married. Mortimer was too busy with a tournament to attend their wedding, but sent golf balls and a patent Sturgis putter as wedding gifts. \\"Sundered Hearts\\" * UK: Strand, December 1920 * US: McClure's, December 1920 ;Plot A young man comes into the club-house, having just played golf because of his enthusiasm for the game despite the cold and snowy weather. The Oldest Member is reminded of another enthusiastic golfer, Mortimer Sturgis. The young man heard the first story about him, \\"A Mixed Threesome\\". The Oldest Member tells him another story about Mortimer. Mortimer is now 42 years old and has a handicap of twelve. He is more passionate about golf than ever. In the winter, Mortimer goes to the sunny South of France to play golf there. At the hotel, he meets a woman with golden hair, Miss Somerset, and the two fall in love. Her left wrist is in a sling. She says she strained it playing the championship. Mortimer assumes she is Mary Somerset, champion of the Ladies' Open Golf Championship, and is thrilled to meet her. They spend more time together. When he is golfing, she vaguely suggests he give the ball a hard knock when he asks for advice, and he is delighted to have her help. She says yes when he asks if he can call her Mary. He proposes to her. She gladly accepts him, though she seems somewhat disquieted when he says he is excited to be marrying a first- class golfer. They are quietly married a few weeks later. They spend their honeymoon in Italy and then go to Mortimer's little house near the golf course. When he asks her to play golf with him, she confesses that she deceived Mortimer. She is actually Mabel Somerset, a champion croquet player. Mary Somerset is her cousin. She did not clarify this to Mortimer because she was in love and wanted to marry him. Distraught, she disappears before Mortimer can talk to her and leaves a letter saying she wronged him and is going away somewhere. Mortimer still loves her and tries to find her by hiring private detectives and advertising in all the papers. On Christmas Eve, Mabel returns at last. She explains that she left to study golf in Scotland under a famous golfer named Tammas McMickle. Her handicap is 24. Mortimer's handicap has risen to 24. He is delighted to have her back, and happy that they will be playing golf together. \\"The Salvation of George Mackintosh\\" 1921 illustration by E. H. Shepard for \\"The Salvation of George Mackintosh\\" in the Strand * UK: Strand, June 1921 * US: McClure's, September 1921 ;Plot The Oldest Member discusses annoying golfers who talk incessantly on the course. He tells the following story about George Mackintosh, a golfer who was very talkative before being cured. George falls in love with Celia Tennant, but is too diffident to speak to her. He asks the Oldest Member for advice. The Oldest Member points out an advertisement in a magazine for a correspondence course on becoming a convincing talker. George decides to try out the course for a week or two and then ask for a higher salary at the law firm where he works. If this succeeds, he will continue the course. A few weeks later, George is now talkative, confident, and somewhat overbearing. He has convinced his boss to give him a raise and has also become engaged to Celia. George talks incessantly on the links, and the other players get annoyed and avoid him. Celia also becomes irritated by George's constant talking. The Oldest Member invites Celia to play golf with him, and suggests she bring George along so they can reason with him. While the Oldest Member and Celia play golf, George talks a great deal about a variety of subjects but particularly criticizes Celia's playing. This exasperates Celia, though George does not notice. The Oldest Member, whose concentration on the game is affected by George's prattling, slices his drive into the woods on the right, and after playing another, he goes into the woods to find his ball. While searching, he hears Celia call out to him. She tells him she snapped and hit George with her niblick. Celia regrets hitting him, though he quickly recovers. She and the Oldest Member tell him what happened. He is back to normal and is amazed Celia stuck with him despite his bothersome chatting. They share an embrace. The Oldest Member concludes that it is possible but difficult to cure extremely chatty golfers. \\"Ordeal by Golf\\" * US: Collier's, 6 December 1919 * UK: Strand, February 1920 (as \\"A Kink in His Character\\") In this story, the club is called the Marvis Bay Golf and Country Club in the Strand version. It is called the Manhooset Golf and Country Club and is located near New York in the Collier's version. ;Plot The Oldest Member watches a group of players struggle on the course. After one of them tries to blame his caddie for distracting him, The Oldest Member remarks that few men possess the proper golfing temperament, and is reminded of a story about Mitchell Holmes. Mitchell is a young man employed by the Paterson Dyeing and Refining Company, of which the president is Alexander Paterson, an old friend of the Oldest Member. Mitchell is engaged to Millicent Boyd, but needs a larger salary to get married. One evening, Alexander Paterson visits the Oldest Member and asks him for advice. The treasurer of his company is retiring soon, and there are two men capable of holding the job, but he does not know which one is more trustworthy. The Oldest Member suggests that Alexander find out each man's true character by playing golf with him, without telling them it is a test. Whichever man behaves better on the links should be promoted to the position. Alexander thanks him for the idea. After he mentions the men are named Holmes and Dixon, the Oldest Member regrets having given advice before hearing the names. He is fond of Mitchell, though Mitchell is apt to lose his temper when playing golf, while Rupert Dixon is supercilious and unpleasant but suave on the golf course. The Oldest Member tells Mitchell that Alexander Paterson will test him by playing golf with him. Millicent buys a self-improvement book about controlling emotions called Are You Your Own Master?, which is simply a collection of quotations from Marcus Aurelius sold under a different name. Alexander first tests Rupert Dixon, who does not lose his temper and wins the match. When Mitchell plays with Alexander, the Oldest Member and Millicent also come to provide moral support. Alexander plays very slowly, which irritates Mitchell. Millicent reads quotations from her book to encourage Mitchell to stay calm, which helps somewhat. However, Mitchell becomes overconfident and loses his lead, which makes him lose his temper. Millicent leaves to avoid making Mitchell nervous. Mitchell is distracted by his caddie eating an apple and loses his temper again. He concedes the match. To his surprise, Alexander offers him the position of treasurer, since he knows he can always beat Mitchell at golf just by playing slowly and making him lose his temper. \\"The Long Hole\\" * UK: Strand, August 1921 * US: McClure's, March 1922 ;Plot After a young man complains about players who use rules to try to disqualify opponents, the Oldest Member says that rules must be followed and is reminded of a story. He notes that the story is similar at first to the events of \\"A Woman is Only a Woman\\", but it develops quite differently. Ralph Bingham and Arthur Jukes (US: Rollo Bingham and Otis Jukes) are already unfriendly rivals before they meet Amanda Trivett, but once they do, they fall in love in her and despise each other. Ralph and Arthur are both skilled at golf to an equal degree, handsome, and arrogant. When neither of them attracts Amanda's attention, they believe it is because they are keeping each other from having a chance to woo her, so they agree to a contest at golf. The winner will have the chance to court Amanda without competition. The match will consist of a single long hole. They will start at dawn on the club's first tee, and hole out in the town in the doorway of the Majestic Hotel in Royal Square (US: Hotel Astor in Times Square). It is a distance of about sixteen miles, which will prevent either from winning just by being lucky. The Oldest Member disapproves, thinking freak matches like this are travesties on the sacred game, but thinks it will be historic anyway and agrees. In the beginning of the match, Ralph gets ahead by chipping his ball aboard a boat he moored on the lake and rowing it to the other side. Arthur protests, stating the boat is a hazard, but Ralph points out that there is nothing in the rules against moving a hazard. Arthur reaches the road after Ralph and tries to play straight while covering distance. Arthur hits his ball into a car and pays the driver five pounds (US: twenty dollars) for a ride to Royal Square, planning to open the car door once he gets there and chip the ball out. Ralph does not protest, because Arthur would forfeit the match by opening the car door, since it is against the rules to tamper with a hazard. The Oldest Member realizes this and warns Arthur. At Royal Square, people on the street watch Arthur try unsuccessfully to hit his ball out of the car. Ralph and Rupert arrive. Ralph's score is close to Arthur's since a dog grabbed his ball and took it back some distance. Rupert wants breakfast before they continue, and everyone agrees. Afterwards, they find the car gone. Ralph bought it and paid the driver to take it to Glasgow (Boston in the US version). Ralph claims Arthur is disqualified since he cannot reach his ball in five minutes, while Arthur claims that Ralph is disqualified because he (jokingly) asked a bystander for golfing advice. Amanda happens to come out of the hotel. They ask Amanda to decide who was disqualified first. Amanda is not sure but she offers to ask her fianc√©, who is very good at golf. Ralph and Arthur are stunned and tell her it doesn't matter. \\"The Heel of Achilles\\" * UK: Strand, November 1921 * US: Chicago Tribune, 11 June 1922McIlvaine (1990), p. 145, D13.2. * US: St. Louis Globe-Democrat, 11 June 1922McIlvaine (1990), p. 155, D58.1. ;Plot The Oldest Member says that golf is an uncertain game and it is never safe to bet on any player. This leads to him telling the following story of Vincent Jopp, the American multi-millionaire, who played golf for only one season. In the story, the Oldest Member is a young man who has just come down from Cambridge. He secures the job of secretary to Vincent Jopp and goes with him to Chicago. The Oldest Member types Jopp's appointments in a ledger and notices that Jopp wrote \\"Propose to Amelia\\" under May 3rd. The Oldest Member is not surprised by this, since Jopp has divorced three times. What is more remarkable is that the extremely confident Jopp also wrote \\"Marry Amelia\\" under June 1st. However, on May 4th, Jopp says nothing about Amelia. Instead, he asks his secretary for information on golf, including who the best professional golfer is. The Oldest Member tells him Scottish golfer Sandy McHoots won both British and American Open events last year. Jopp tells him to have McHoots brought from Scotland to Chicago to teach Jopp golf. Jopp, as confident as ever, plans to win the Amateur Championship on September 12th and marry Amelia on the 13th. He also becomes a member of the Wissahickey Glen, a club to which the Oldest Member belongs. Jopp rapidly becomes a very skilled player. He wins smaller competitions and is considered to be the probable winner of the American Amateur Championship, held that year in Detroit. The Oldest Member accompanies his employer there as both secretary and caddie. Amelia Merridew meets the Oldest Member. She explains that Jopp asked her to marry him, but she does not want to, so she said she would marry him if he won this year's Amateur Championship, thinking it would be impossible. She asks the Oldest Member to shout at him while he is golfing to distract him, but he refuses, since he has a bet on Jopp to win. Later, he gets a telephone call from each of Jopp's former wives, who say they will be on the course tomorrow to see Jopp play the final. He mentions this to Jopp, who seems nervous for the first time. Jopp plays well until the three Mrs Jopps appear: Luella Mainprice Jopp, who talks baby-talk to her Pekingese dog, Agnes Parsons Jopp, who fusses about Jopp's health, and Jane Jukes Jopp, who makes fun of how Jopp looks wearing knickerbockers. They make Jopp anxious and he loses the match. The Oldest Member, who lost his wager on Jopp, concludes that there are no safe bets in golf. \\"The Rough Stuff\\" * US: Chicago Tribune, 10 October 1920 * UK: Strand, April 1921 ;Plot Eunice Waters stops by the club with her baby. Eunice is married to Ramsden Waters, who is away seeing her young brother Wilberforce off on the train to school in Scotland. The Oldest Member tells the story of how Eunice and Ramsden came to be married. Ramsden Waters is shy and plays golf by himself. One morning, a boy calls out at him while he is golfing and causes him to mis-hit a ball. The boy is Wilberforce, and he is accompanied by his older sister, the beautiful and haughty Eunice Bray. She says that Wilberforce enjoys watching golf, and for her sake, Ramsden invites Wilberforce to come round with him. He finds out from Wilberforce that Eunice is not engaged to be married. After playing golf, he returns Wilberforce to Eunice, who has been reading a novel, and she thanks him without looking up from her book. Ramsden has little hope of courting Eunice. He calls at her home, but his multiple handsome rivals take up Eunice's attention while he talks with her seaweed-collecting aunt. One day, Eunice takes up golf, mainly because her rival Kitty Manders won a small silver cup at a monthly handicap and keeps bringing it up in conversation. Eunice takes lessons and soon acquires some skill in the game. She is paired with Ramsden in the annual mixed foursomes. Ramsden looks on this as a sign and proposes to her. Eunice refuses and tells him to play well in the foursomes because she wants to win. At the competition, their only real threat is a skilled golfer named Marcella Bingley, who is paired with the less impressive George Perkins. Like Eunice, Ramsden wants to win the competition and talks to her earnestly without any diffidence, telling her to play steadily and not try fancy shots. Eunice is surprised and annoyed by the change in Ramsden's manner. Throughout the match, Ramsden tells her how she should play. At first, she is offended and ignores him, but her feelings change when she realizes that he reminds her of the rugged, domineering heroes in the romance novels she reads. Eunice has wanted to meet such a man. She plays worse than Ramsden and is humbled. Ramsden makes a mistake and kicks Wilberforce after he laughs at him. Ramsden and Eunice lose the match, and Ramsden coldly strides off, again reminding Eunice of romance novels. That night, Ramsden is no longer affected by golf and reproaches himself for alienating Eunice. However, he gets a telephone call from her. She invites him to come see her to discuss marriage. \\"The Coming of Gowf\\" * UK: Strand, May 1921 * US: McClure's, June‚ÄìJuly 1921 ;Plot In the story's prologue, an author humbly approaches a regal editor and offers his historical story. The editor says the public does not want historical stories, and that the magazine needs stories with warm human interest and a strong love-motive. At the moment, the editor needs a golf story. The author says that his work is just what the editor is looking for, and presents the following story. King Merolchazzar of Oom has heard good things about the Princess of the Outer Isles and hopes to court her. He sends her gifts and asks to meet her. She receives the gifts but simply says she will let him know later. He has not heard from her since then and is disappointed. In his gardens, he notices a Scottish gardener hitting a rounded stone with a hoe. The King asks his Grand Vizier what the man is doing. The Vizier believes it is some sort of religious ceremony done to propitiate a deity named Gowf, who is not among Oom's sixty-seven deities. The King is fascinated and learns how to play golf from the gardener. Some members of the king's court arrange for minstrels to play for him to cheer him up after being ignored by the Princess, but they only annoy the King while he is trying to hit the ball. Word spreads that the King has become an adherent of a new religion. Merolchazzar now spends most of his time on the Linx, as the outdoor temple of the new god is called. The gardener is given riches and the title of Promoter of the King's Happiness, or The Pro for short. The Grand Vizier is loyal to the King and takes to Gowf right away, but the priesthood, especially the influential High Priest of Hec, resist the new religion. The King's half-brother, Ascobaruch, wants the King's position for himself and plots against him with the High Priest. According to their plan, the High Priest will assassinate the King while Ascobaruch is away on a trip, and Ascobaruch will become the new monarch when he returns. The High Priest goes to the Linx, but before he can do anything, the King gives him a stick and tells him to play. A month later, Ascobaruch returns from his trip and finds that golf is now widespread. After seeing the King and Vizier playing a foursome against the Pro and the Highest Priest of Hec, Ascobaruch gives up and leaves. One day, the beautiful Princess of the Outer Isles visits the King. She did not send him a message before because she was busy, her subjects having recently converted to the religion of Gowf. The King says that the same thing has happened in Oom. They bond over their love of golf and walk hand in hand into the palace. Ultimately, the editor accepts the story. He tells his majordomo to give the man a purse of gold and then throw him out.

These tires were most commonly used from the early 1900s to around the mid 1970s. Background The use of whitewall rubber for tire has been traced to a small tire company in Chicago called Vogue Tyre and Rubber Co that made them for their horse and chauffeur drawn carriages in 1914. Early automobile tires were made of pure natural rubber with various chemicals mixed into the tread compounds to make them wear better. The best of these was zinc oxide, a pure white substance that increased traction and also made the entire tire white. However, the white rubber did not offer sufficient endurance, so carbon black was added to the rubber to greatly increase tread life.Cameron, p. 169. Using carbon black only in the tread produced tires with inner and outer sidewalls of white rubber. Later, entirely black tires became available, the still extant white sidewalls being covered with a somewhat thin, black colored layer of rubber. Should a black sidewall tire have been severely scuffed against a curb, the underlying white rubber would be revealed; it is in a similar manner that raised white letter (RWL) tires are made. Overview The status of whitewall tires versus blackwall tires was originally the reverse of what it later became, with fully black tires requiring a greater amount of carbon black and less effort to maintain a clean appearance these were considered the premium tire; since the black tires first became available they were commonly fitted to many luxury cars through the 1930s. During the late-1920s gleaming whitewalls contrasted against darker surroundings were considered a stylish, but high-maintenance feature. The popularity of whitewalls as an option increased during the 1930s. On April 6, 1934, Ford introduced whitewall tires as an $11.25 option on all its new cars. But automobile designs incorporating streamlining directed visual interest away from tire walls. 1950s Rambler American with vintage aftermarket \\"curb feeler\\" The availability of whitewall tires was limited in the U.S. during the supply shortages of raw materials during World War II and the Korean War. Wide whitewall tires reached their height in popularity by the early-1950s. The 1957 production version of the Cadillac Eldorado Brougham was fitted with whitewalls that were reduced to a 1\\" wide stripe floating on the tire sidewall with a black area between this stripe and the wheel rim. The whitewall stripe width began to diminish as an attempt to reduce the perceived height of the wheel/tire. During the decade, increasingly lower vehicle heights were in vogue. During the 1950s, Fender skirts also covered up white wall tires. Wide whitewalls generally fell out of favor in the U.S. by the 1962 model year. They continued as an option on the Lincoln Continental for some time thereafter but most common were narrower 3/4\\"-1\\" stripe whitewalls. During the mid-1960s variations on the striped whitewall began to appear; a red/white stripe combination was offered on Thunderbirds and other high-end Fords, and triple white stripe variations were offered on Cadillacs, Lincolns, and Imperials. Whitewall tires were a popular option on new cars during the 1950s and 1960s, as well as in the replacement market. In some cases, having whitewall tires were a \\"must have\\" to get the right look on a car; and for those who could not afford the real deal, add-ons could be installed over the rim of the wheel that could leak if the pressure was too high. New tires were wrapped in paper for shipping, to keep the white stripe clean, and for preventing the black of other tires from rubbing on the whitewall side. Maintaining a clean sidewall was an issue. Some motorists added aftermarket \\"curb feelers\\" that were attached at the bottom of the wheel opening lip to help reduce scraping the whitewall tire against curbs. By 1968, wide whitewall tires were no longer available on the Chevrolet Corvette; replaced by F70x15 bias-ply nylon cord tires with thin stripes, either a narrow white or narrow red stripe. The single-sided whitewall remained a desirable option through the 1970s, becoming a hallmark of \\"traditional luxury\\". Radial tires made by Vogue Tyre featured a narrow whitewall with a thin gold stripe line toward the edge of the tire. They were most often fitted to luxury cars. Modern Full- fledged wide whitewalls have made a return within modified car culture. The resurgence of traditional hot rods, customs, retro, lowriders and resto-cal cars have also contributed to the resurgence in whitewall tires. Although wide whitewalls are virtually nonexistent as a factory option on modern automobiles, they are still manufactured in original bias-ply or radial form by specialty outlets such as Coker Tire and Vogue Tyre. The last car available in the United Kingdom with whitewall tires was the Kia Pride. Some companies manufacture wide whitewall inserts - the so-called \\"Portawall\\" inserts are usually sold through Volkswagen Beetle restoration companies. Another modern incarnation has been tire decals, which can be applied to a normal tire to give the whitewall look. Modern trends toward more minimal styling, and large wheels favoring very low-profile tires leave little room for a whitewall.

It bears many similarities to the emblem of the previous Uzbek SSR, which Republic of Uzbekistan succeeded. Like other post-Soviet republics whose symbols do not predate the October Revolution, the current emblem retains some components of the Soviet one. Prior to 1992, Uzbekistan had an emblem similar to all other Soviet Republics, with standard communist emblems and insignia. The coat of arms displays the natural wealth of the country. On the left there is a cotton plant, which has been immensely important to the country's industry and agriculture since the Soviet era as the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic was one of the main producers and supplies of cotton in the entirety of the USSR, thus it is often called the white gold symbolizing its sheer significance. To the right is a wreath of wheat ears, symbolizing the country's wealth and prosperity. Together, both cotton and wheat plants are intertwined with the ribbon of the state flag, which portrays the peace and consolation of different peoples and ethnic groups living within the republic. It is surmounted by the blue star of Rub El Hizb (€û) with white star and crescent inside, a symbol of Islam, which a majority of Uzbeks profess. In the center, a right-facing Huma (or Khumo) is displayed with outstretched wings. This legendary bird symbolizes peace, happiness and striving for freedom. Enclosed by the Huma's wings is a depiction of the rising sun over mountains, overlooking green pastures. Two rivers, the Amu Darya and Sir Darya, flow from the mountains and crepuscular rays emanate from the rising sun at the rear of the emblem. The Khumo is perched on a banner at the base of the cotton and wheat borders which bears the national colors and the name of the country in Latin script (). Karakalpakstan, an autonomous republic within Uzbekistan uses an emblem based on Uzbekistan's, but featuring the regional colors blue, gold, and green. It features only one river, the Amu Darya, along with a local monument at the background of the emblem, adjacent to the mountains.  History  Prior to the October Revolution and the subsequent establishment of the Soviet regime in the country, the local khanates and emirates such as the Emirate of Bukhara and the Khanate of Khiva that gave way to the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, lacked the coat of arms in the western sense of the word, with the local states using more traditional ways of self-representation and symbols of governance. Bukharan People's Republic Bukharan People's Soviet Republic on the map of the U.S.S.R marked in green, circa 1922 On September 1, 1920, the Young Bukharians and bukharan communists started a revolt in the city of Charjow supported by the RSFSR, against the emir of Bukhara Mohammed Alim Khan and the government of the Emirate. On the second September, the bolsheviks and their allies captured the city after heavy aerial bombardment and an effective destruction of numerous parts of the city. Emir of Bukhara and his court first fled to the Eastern Bukhara and subsequently into Afghanistan. 14 September 1920 marked the date when a republican form of government was adopted and all the related government institutions were established. On October 8, during the All-Bukharan Kurultai, formation of the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic was announced, followed by an adoption of a constitution on 23 September of the next year, by the same congressional body, the kurultai. Emblem of the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic The 78th Article of the contituition of Bukharan P.S.R. was as follows: Uzbek S.S.R The original emblem of the Uzbek SSR from 1925 On 13‚Äì15 February 1925, in the city of Bukhara, the first Uzbek Congress of the Soviets issued a declaration about the establishment of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. And 22 June 1925, the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of the Uzbek SSR adopted a resolution No.67 Concerning the emblem and the flag of the Uzbek SSR, which temporarily, until the establishment of the Constitution of the Uzbek SSR. established the emblem of the republic. The project of the emblem taken as basis of the final design consisted of depictions of uraq (a sickle) and a hammer criss-cross with the handles down and surrounded by a wreath of ears and branches of cotton. The red ribbon, surrounding the wreath, is adorned with the insciption Uz.S.S.R (in the Arabic script of the Uzbek Language and in Russian. A red star with a golden borders is located at the upper side of the emblem; the emblem is surrounded with the inscriptio, both in Russian and Uzbek, of the communist motto: \\"Proletarians of the world, unite!\\".http://www.heraldicum.ru/uzbekstn/ussr.htm In 1927‚Äì1928, a series of reforms were made to change the writing system of the Uzbek Language into a latinized alphabet, known as Ya√±alif, intended as a singular alphabet for all the Turkic Languages of the USSR. In accorance with this, the inscription on the coat of arms was altered, in order to reflect the current reforms. Furthermore, several smaller changes were implemented due to the secession of Tajikistan as a separate republic within the Soviet Union in 1929 and separation of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic from Uz.S.S.R. Emblem of the Uzbek SSR from 1929 to 1937 On July 11, 1939, a decree was issued by the Central Government of the Soviet Union, as to alter the alphabets of several republics within the union into the cyrillic script. Thus, on 8 May 1940, the Uzbek script was changed from latin alphabet, into the new cyrillic one, based on Russian. And later on on 16 January 1941, the emblem of the republic followed suit, and it too, switched its inscription from latin script to cyrillic. Hence, the coat of arms got a new insignia of ¬´”Æ–∑.–°.–°.–†.¬ª in the place of the old latin one. Emblem of the Uzbek SSR, as prescribed in the 1978 Constitution Further down the line, in the new constitution of 19 April 1978, a new description of the emblem was given, which brought forth several alterations to the design. The article 178. read thusly: This version of the emblem survived until the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, when a new coat of arms, along with other state insignia such as a flag was adopted, for the newly independent Republic of Uzbekistan. Post Independence The current state emblem of Uzbekistan approved by the 10th session of the Supreme Assembly of Uzbekistan on 2 July 1992 in accordance with the law No. 616-XII \\"About the State emblem of the Republic of Uzbekistan\\".http://parliament.gov.uz/en/coat/  The symbolism  In the centre of the emblem depicts Khumo with wings spread ‚Äî in Uzbek mythology, the symbol of happiness and freedom. Uzbek poet Alisher Navoi characterized the bird Humo as the kindest of all living beings.http://parliament.gov.uz/en/coat/ In the upper part of the emblem is an octagon, symbolizing the unity and the confirmation of the republic. The crescent and star inside the eight-pointed star are the sacred symbols of Islam. The image of the sun symbolizes the light that illuminates the path of the Uzbek state, whilist the flourishing valley emphasizes the unique and favorable natural and climatic conditions of the Republic. Two rivers, run through the valley, representing the Amu-Darya and Syr-Darya, which flow through the territory of Uzbekistan. The ears of wheat are the symbol of bread, and mark the wealth and prosperity of the republic, with open cotton boxes characterizing the previously vital cotton industry of Uzbekistan. Together, wheat and cotton boxes entwined with ribbon of the tricolor of national flag, symbolize the consolidation of the peoples living in the Republic.http://parliament.gov.uz/en/coat/ Gallery Current emblem of Uzbekistan Emblem of Karakalpakstan An Uzbek passport with the national emblem displayed on the front The Soviet Emblem in the Latin script, during a parade in Moscow A Soviet stamp with the Emblem of the Uzbek SSR References External links  * Embassy of Uzbekistan to the United States  About Uzbekistan  State Symbols * Category:National symbols of Uzbekistan Uzbekistan Uzbekistan Uzbekistan Uzbekistan Uzbekistan Uzbekistan Uzbekistan Uzbekistan ","title":"Emblem of Uzbekistan"},{"id":"1888982","text":"is a company that offers information about international politics and economy, and does investment consulting based in Minato, Tokyo, Japan.

The two-hour special stars the cast of the Hanna-Barbera sitcomes The Flintstones and The Jetsons as they cross paths following a time travel experiment gone wrong. Plot In the future, while Elroy is busy working on a time machine, George Jetson comes to Mr. Spacely's office for a serious discussion. Spacely's rival, Cogswell, has been stealing Spacely's business ideas - putting their jobs in jeopardy. Spacely wrongfully blames George - suspecting that he was spying for Cogswell. Spacely orders George to spy on Cogswell to clear his name to avoid getting fired. George finds out that Cogswell's robot computer, S.A.R.A., has been seducing the Spacely robot computer, R.U.D.I., into leaking Mr. Spacely's secrets. George tries to report this to Spacely, but R.U.D.I. sabotages his efforts. In the Stone Age, Wilma and Betty are trying to convince Fred Flintstone to have their vacation in Honolurock (Honolulu), but Fred ignores their advances. Later, at work, Fred tells Barney Rubble that he plans to take the girls someplace better. He tells Barney that a poker tournament is being held at the Water Buffalo lodge and wants to go, but Mr. Slate shows up and tells them that due to their going on vacation, they must work the late shift because Turk Tarpit, Slate's business rival and nemesis, has been outproducing them. Fred and Barney later disobey Slate's orders and go to the poker tournament. However, after seeing that Slate is playing there too, they disguise themselves. Fred plays against Slate but loses. A spider exposes Barney - and ultimately Fred. Furious that they deceived and disobeyed him, Slate fires Fred and Barney. Back in the future, Elroy completes his time machine. The Jetsons decide to use it to take a trip to the 25th century to relax. Right before Elroy gets the machine working, his dog, Astro, accidentally sets the switch to \\"Past.\\" With no job, the Flintstones and Rubbles are forced to settle for a camping holiday. As Fred and Barney set up the tent, the Jetsons arrive from the future. Fred and George eventually communicate, and the families become friends. Fred is amazed by George's futuristic gadgets and decides to use them to help Mr. Slate in a competition at the upcoming company picnic. Fred introduces George to Slate - claiming that George is a distant cousin. Slate is reluctant at first to trust George, but since rival businessman Turk Tarpit's cheating has set him back, Slate accepts their help in exchange for giving them their jobs back. George and Fred use future technology to help Slate win several games, but in the last event, Astro's and Dino's actions causes Tarpit to become the winner. In the end, Slate once again fires Fred and Barney. While Mr. Spacely continues to vent over his failing business, Henry Orbit and Rosie the Robot Maid assemble a \\"time machine retriever\\" to bring the Jetsons back. But when they turn it on, the time machine returns with the Flintstones instead. Upon seeing they really are cavemen, Spacely introduces them to the press. Stuck in the past, George asks Mr. Slate for a job. Slate initially rejects, but when Tarpit offers George work, Slate immediately makes George his partner, and George soon becomes famous. Using their newfound fame and riches, the Jetsons buy multiple local businesses and are soon overwhelmed. Meanwhile, Mr. Spacely makes Fred the spokesman for his company, but R.U.D.I. leaks this information to S.A.R.A. When Spacely is introducing Fred to some important investors, Cogswell introduces Barney instead - leading to a rift in Fred's and Barney's friendship. Meanwhile, Rosie requests R.U.D.I. to help Henry and her try to fix the time machine to find the Jetsons. S.A.R.A. appears and demands that R.U.D.I. get rid of Rosie before she departs, but R.U.D.I. agrees to do whatever he can to get the Jetsons back and leaves S.A.R.A. for good. They fix the time machine, and Rosie is transported to the Stone Age where she finds her family. Now able to return home, the Jetsons leave, taking Fred's car with them, after Judy says goodbye to a teen idol - Iggy. Mr. Spacely concocts a plan to use Fred's car as a model for futuristic replicas. Cogswell sends his robotic dog, Sentro, to steal this information since S.A.R.A. is no longer useful when she tells him that R.U.D.I. broke up with her and told her off. The two families manage to stop Sentro - destroying the evidence he had collected. Spacely's business of selling Stone Age style cars becomes successful, and he even agrees to sell one to Cogswell - but not without warning Cogswell that if he copies any part of it, Spacely will sue him and take over his business. Fred and Barney repair their friendship, Spacely lets George keep his job, and George offers his partnership with Mr. Slate to Fred and Barney to give them their jobs back. Just as they are about to leave for home, Elroy tells them the time machine is broken and cannot be repaired. Fortunately, they are able to return to the Stone Age because Fred's car absorbed the time machine's \\"quadrapotents.\\" The Flintstones and the Rubbles then bid a fond farewell to the Jetsons and are sent back to the Stone Age.

His best known work, As a Man Thinketh, has been mass- produced since its publication in 1903. It has been a source of inspiration to motivational and self-help authors.  Background  Born in Leicester, England, into a working-class family, Allen was the elder of two brothers. His mother could neither read nor write. His father, William, was a factory knitter. In 1879, following a downturn in the textile trade of central England, Allen's father travelled alone to America to find work and establish a new home for the family. Within two days of arriving his father was pronounced dead at New York City Hospital, believed to be a case of robbery and murder. At age fifteen, with the family now facing economic disaster, Allen was forced to leave school and find work. For much of the 1890s, Allen worked as a private secretary and stationer in several British manufacturing firms. In 1893 Allen moved to London and later to South Wales, earning his living by journalism and reporting. In South Wales he met Lily Louisa Oram (Lily L. Allen) whom he then wed in 1895. In 1898 Allen found an occupation in which he could showcase his spiritual and social interests as a writer for the magazine The Herald of the Golden Age. At this time, Allen entered a creative period where he then published his first of many books, From Poverty to Power (1901). In 1902 Allen began to publish his own spiritual magazine, The Light of Reason, later retitled The Epoch. In 1903, Allen published his third and most famous book As a Man Thinketh. Loosely based on the Biblical passage of Proverbs 23:7, \\"As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he,\\" the small work eventually became read around the world and brought Allen posthumous fame as one of the pioneering figures of modern inspirational thought. The book's minor audience allowed Allen to quit his secretarial work and pursue his writing and editing career. In 1903, the Allen family retired to the town of Ilfracombe where Allen would spend the rest of his life. Continuing to publish the Epoch, Allen produced more than one book per year until his death in 1912. There he wrote for nine years, producing 19 works. Following his death in 1912, his wife continued publishing the magazine under the name The Epoch. Lily Allen summarised her husband's literary mission in the preface to one of his posthumously published manuscripts, Foundation Stones to Happiness and Success saying: \\"He never wrote theories, or for the sake of writing; but he wrote when he had a message, and it became a message only when he had lived it out in his own life, and knew that it was good. Thus he wrote facts, which he had proven by practice.\\"\\"James Allen: A Life in Brief\\" by Mitch Horowitz, from As a Man Thinketh: Keepsake Edition (Tarcher/Penguin 2009) James Allen is still relevant today. His book \\"As a Man Thinketh\\" was converted into an audiobook entitled \\"As A Woman Thinketh\\" in 2015. That same year, \\"Through the Gates of Good, or Christ and Conduct\\" was also released in audiobook format. In 2016, an audiobook entitled \\"The Secret of Abounding Happiness\\" by James Allen, William Walker Atkinson, Florence Scovel Shinn & Hillary Hawkins was released. In 2020, \\"Morning and Evening Thoughts for the Soul, 31 Days of Wisdom\\", \\"New Thought Theatre\\" and \\"From Passion to Peace\\" were released as audiobooks and James Allen is listed as an author on all three books.

They primarily licensed programs from independent producers, rather than producing their own content.  History = ABC Films Syndication  In spring 1954, American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc. created the ABC Films Syndication, Inc. (AFS), a subsidiary headed by George Shupert, which specialized in syndication and in-house program production. By , AFS formed a 50/50 joint venture production company, Rabco Productions, with Hal Roach, Jr.. In , AFS announced an expansion in production and sales staff for the year. Five new properties were acquired by the company and all received pilots, with two set for syndication if not placed nationally. Two were to be produced by John Gibbs and Meridian Pictures, Renfrew of the Mounted and Ripley's Believe It or Not!, while Rabco's Bernard Fox was assigned with Forest Ranger. The two pilots set for production were The Americano by Martin Gosch and filmed in Spain and The Force produced by Victor Stoloff about the plain clothed Canadian Mounties division. Two shows, Code 3 and The Three Musketeers were already under production for syndication. One of AFS's earliest successes was Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, produced largely in Mexico by Nassour Studios and starring Irish McCalla as the comic-book heroine. Even though only 26 episodes were filmed, the series ran for years in reruns on local stations, in kiddie-show time slots. In 1959, ABC International created Worldvision Enterprises to syndicate programs for overseas markets. Henry G. Plitt, previously president of Paramount Gulf Theatres, became president of the company in February 1959, replacing Shupert after he left for Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer. Kevin O‚ÄôSullivan later became president of the company.  Worldvision Enterprises  In 1971, the FCC barred the participation of networks in the syndication of their own programs, though this rule was eliminated by 1993. Worldvision Enterprises was formed by five former ABC Films executives to purchase the network's syndication assets in 1973. Their home video division released numerous Hanna-Barbera titles and Jack Nicklaus' Golf My Way instructional video series. They were also responsible for the television distribution of a majority of the Carolco Pictures feature film library (inherited from Orbis Communications, which was a division of Carolco before the studio went bankrupt). Worldvision has been owned by many companies over the years. The growth of its home video division was primarily under the ownership of Taft Broadcasting, which acquired the company in 1979. In October 1987, Taft's assets including Worldvision were acquired by Great American Communications. During the mid-1990s, Blockbuster Inc., operator of the now- defunct video store chain, briefly held a controlling interest in the company, and its logo appeared on programs alongside Worldvision's. Television producer Aaron Spelling, attempting to find an outlet to distribute his programs, attempted to buy Worldvision from Great American, but chief company shareholder Carl H. Lindner told Spelling that he was not interested in selling the company.Interview with Aaron Spelling. Archive of American Television (November 18/24, 1999). Lindner did agree to sell Worldvision to Spelling Productions for 50% of Spelling, Inc., the combined company, in 1988. The merger was finalized on March 1, 1989. The company put its \\"Worldvision 3\\" movie package on the market at NAPTE in January 1993. Worldvision 3 was the first since Spelling Entertainment's acquisition of the Carolco library. Some of the movies in the package were Chaplin, Basic Instinct, L.A. Story, Rambling Rose, Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Universal Soldier. In August 1994, Worldvision's Spelling Premiere Network was launched. The network's initial years shows were Robin's Hoods, Heaven Help Us, and University Hospital, Heaven's mid-season replacement. In 1994, Worldvision's home video division was folded into Republic Pictures's Home Video division after Spelling Entertainment's purchase of Republic in the same year. When Spelling Entertainment Group merged with Viacom on May 26, 1999, Worldvision's operations were folded into Paramount Domestic Television. Today, the former Worldvision Enterprises productions are all owned by ViacomCBS thru CBS Television Distribution. In December 2019, CBS Corporation and Viacom remerged into a single entity under the name ViacomCBS, which reunited the former Worldvision Enterprises assets.  Legal issues with World Vision International  The company's logo, as it appeared at the end of the programs it distributed, carried the following disclaimer: \\"Not affiliated with World Vision International, a religious and charitable organization.\\" This was because, in the mid-1970s, the charity sued the company for its use of the \\"Worldvision\\" name, which eventually led to trademark infringement. They eventually settled, with Worldvision allowed to continue using the name for the syndication company, provided that a disclaimer was included to distance itself from World Vision International, which was implemented starting in 1974.

History Mid-1920's Celestion radio loudspeaker, Science Museum, London, South Kensington  Origins  What became Celestion was started in Hampton Wick (suburban London) in 1924. Cyril French and his three brothers had taken over a plating works and established the Electrical Manufacturing and Plating Company. They were listed as \\"electrical instrument manufacturers\\". Eric Mackintosh approached Cyril French for assistence with improving a new loudspeaker he had already filed a patent for (British Patent No. 230,552 on December 15th, 1923, issued March 16th, 1925). The BBC had started their programme in November 1922 and was building up new senders, public interest in radio broadcasting grew rapidly. But listeners still needed to connect either earphones or gramophone horns to the first radio receivers. Installing a loudspeaker sensitive enough in decorative cabinets quickly made these sought- after pieces of furniture in the roaring twenties. French and Mackintosh perfected the design, the modified French/Mackintosh model used a clamped edge, its conical paper diaphragm was strengthened with strips of Chinese bamboo (British Patent No. 245,704, filed October 24th, 1925, issued January 14th, 1926). Cyril French became the driving force of the endeavour to start manufacturing it in his company. The first housed loudspeaker, Celestion, was launched in early 1925. Customers had a choice of oak, walnut or mahogany for the enclosure. One of French's brothers, Ralph, devised the name of the new product. He was also in charge of the cabinet designs and advertising, the two other brothers continued the plating business. A complete range with the models A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 was introduced soon, and a dependance in Paris was formed, Constable-Celestion, to export first speakers. In 1927 the Celestion Radio Company and Celestion Ltd. were formed, which grew and became highly successful quickly. The new models C10, C12, C14 and C24 were came to market, especially the C10 and C12 were highly praised. For many years Celestion advertising would carry the phrase \\"The very Soul of Music\\". In 1929 Celestion Ltd. moved across the Thames to Kingston upon Thames, now listed as \\"Gramophone Works\\". (archived) In 1931 the C range of loadspeakers were supplemented by the new models D10, D12 and D50. Technological improvements meant Celestion had to stay up to date. The first electrical disc-playing machines appeared on the market in the late 1920s. These electric \\"phonographs\\" (since the 1940s known as record players, or nowadays as turntables) became more widespread, later to be combined with a radio receiver. Also in the 1930s receivers became more sophisticated and smaller, loudspeakers now were being built into the receiver cabinet itself, thus a separate unit was not necessary anymore. Many ingenious ideas were incorporated in new designs in order to raise the quality of sound reproduction, such as the Celestion Reetone and Reetone Dual matched speaker units. The former incorporated two equal-sized speakers with a transformer, the matched units were staggered. This eliminated the tendency to \\"boom\\" greatly, because the bass could be better suppressed. The latter had large and small speakers built in and a transformer. The two units were so coupled that the treble was accepted by the treble unit and the bass by the bass unit, being essentially a two-way, crossover-less splitting system. In 1932 Celestion brought the Ppm Permanent Magnet Moving Coil Speaker to market. The business was hit hard by the Great Depression, like so many. Furthermore, in 1934 a dependance of the U.S. Rola Company of Cleveland, Ohio, opened in London, the British Rola Company. Rola being another loudspeaker manufacturer with similar products, the two companies began competing for the home and export markets. In 1935 Cyril French resigned from the board of Celestion Ltd, Eric Mackintosh also left in the early 1930s. (archived) With the 1940s wartime restrictions forced Celestion and the British Rola to produce loudspeakers to the same specification, the utility \\"W\\" type. Micro Precision Products, later a camera maker, was formed as a subsidiary during the war. British Rola bought Celestion in 1947 and moved production to Thames Ditton a year later. The name of the company now changed to Rola Celestion, with its products sold under the brand name Celestion. The company continued making radio, \\"high fidelity\\", and television speakers in the postwar years. In 1949, Rola Celestion was bought by Truvox, a public address system manufacturer. In 1968 Celestion started production in Ipswich, Suffolk, moving all manufacturing there by 1975. The firm merged with a clothing company in 1970, and the result was now named Celestion Industries, which in turn became Celestion International Ltd. in 1979. In 1992 the loudspeaker part of the business (Celestion International) was sold to Kinergetics Holdings (UK) Ltd., which also bought the company KEF.  Currently  Today Celestion International and KEF together form Gold Peak Acoustics UK. In 2006 Celestion ceased to manufacture finished professional audio systems and consumer hi-fi / home cinema products, and now focuses on the design and manufacture of lead guitar, bass guitar, profesional audio and sound reinforcement speakers.  Noteable Products = Consumer Audio Equipment  In 1981 Celestion built the hi-fi box model SL6, a compact two-way loudspeaker with a single-piece metal dome tweeter made of copper and a cone-shaped bass unit of PVC with integrated dustcap. Both speaker drivers designed with the help of laser interferometry. Afterwards followed the model SL600, which won worldwide awards in the audiophile hi-fi scene. Instead of wood for the loudspeaker enclosure a rigid honeycomb alloy called Aerolam was chosen, a material previously used only in the aerospace industry. Then followed versions with aluminium dome tweeter, designated as SL6s in standard cabinets (MDF and wood veneer), and the SL6si with an improved audio crossover and woofer surround. Aluminium-domed models using the Aerolam cabinet were the models SL700, and SL700SE with dual inputs. Another of the copper-domed versions, with Aerolam cabinet, dual inputs and improved crossover elements, was marketed as the SL600si. The speakers of the SL model range were generally well regarded for their natural sound and wide sound dispersion, and a detailed mid and bass range. Their tweeters produced very clear voices, good especially for vocal and classical music recordings. But the copper dome versions were also known for a somewhat \\"depressed\\" sounding high-frequency range, due to the relatively heavy material. Later versions used an aluminium diaphragm dome. This lighter and more efficient driver provided an output now more balanced with the mid-range part the woofer presented, which in the first version had lacked of bass to better connect to the tweeter frequencies. In 1986 Celestion introduced the System 6000, a double-dipole subwoofer system with active audio crossover to complement and enhance the SL series. In 1992 the Model 100, a final variation of the SL design, came to market. It featured a conventional, but highly refined MDF / wood veneer cabinet, dual inputs, updated mounted plates, improved audio crossover and woofer design, and a variation of the aluminium tweeter with an updated faceplate. The Celestion Kingston was introduced in 1995 as an evolution of the SL family. The innovative speaker case is made from Alphacrystal, a stone/resin mould. It tapers to the rear in a way that there is no traditional back panel anymore. In 1989 the Celestion 3 with metal dome tweeter was introduced. It set new performance standards for low-cost quality hi-fi loudspeakers, highly acclaimed by both public and critics. The later 3 Mark II model was awarded the \\"1994/95 European Loudspeaker of the Year\\" by the European Imaging and Sound Association. (archived) (archived)  Professional Audio Equipment  According to the company the Celestion Blue, the model G12 T530 driver, was the world's first dedicated guitar loudspeaker. The 1950s emergence of louder guitar amplifiers created a need for a rugged, reliable loudspeaker. Celestion responded by modifying their standard \\"G12\\" radio speaker. The tonal character, combined with valve amp circuits of the time, helped to define the electric guitar sound. It was rapidly adopted by pioneers of rock & roll and popular music throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s. In 1984 the Sidewinder range of guitar speakers were unveiled. These were endowed with a special edgewound aluminium voice coil - a process developed to maximise the ratio of motor strength to mass which resulted in very high efficiency designs. In 1986 Celestion introduced its B15 and B18 range of double suspension public address systems, with power ratings up to 1000 Watts. In 1987 the SR (Sound Reinforcement) loudspeaker series with integral aluminium dome followed. A number of companies use Celestion speakers, including Orange Music Electronic Company, Fender Musical Instrument Corporation, Vox, and Marshall Amps. In June 2019, Celestion selected Sensey Electronics as its distribution partner in Mexico, to represent its entire range of pro audio and MI products. In September 2019, Celestion announced the launch of the F12-X200 guitar loudspeaker, the first speaker designer specifically for use with profiling amps, modeling software, impulse responses and other technologies which are designed for emulating the tones from guitar amps and speaker cabinets.

The Rule 5 draft aims to prevent teams from stockpiling too many young players on their minor league affiliate teams when other teams would be willing to have them play in the majors.MLB Draft Rules - DraftSite.com. The Rule 5 draft is named for its place in Major League Rules. (It is sometimes erroneously referenced with a Roman numeral.) The June Rule 4 draft, known as simply \\"the draft\\", \\"amateur draft\\", or \\"first year player draft\\", is a distinctly different process in which teams select high school and college players. History Prior to its current incarnation, from 1959 until the creation of the Rule 4 draft in 1965, top first-year prospects of teams were exposed to the Rule 5 draft. This was in some ways an outgrowth of the Bonus rule that existed from 1946 to 1950 and from 1953 to 1957.Baseball America history of the draft Description As in the amateur draft, the selection order of the teams is based on each team's win-loss record from the prior regular season, each round starting with the team with the worst record and proceeding in order to the team with the best record. Teams may choose not to select any player with their pick, passing to the next team in the order. Any player selected under Rule 5 is immediately added to his new team's 40-man roster; thus, teams who do not have an available roster spot may not participate in the Rule 5 draft. Players who are not currently on their team's 40-man roster are eligible to be selected in the Rule 5 draft, but only after a standard exemption period has elapsed. See Selection eligibility below. If chosen in the Rule 5 draft, a player must be kept on the selecting team's 26-man (prior to the 2020 season, 25-man) major league roster for the entire season that follows the draft‚Äîhe may not be optioned or designated to the minors. The selecting team may, at any time, waive the Rule 5 draftee. If a Rule 5 draftee clears waivers by not signing with a new MLB team, he must be offered back to the original team, effectively canceling the Rule 5 draft choice. Once a Rule 5 draftee spends an entire season on his new team's 26-man roster, his status reverts to normal and he may be optioned or designated for assignment. To prevent the abuse of the Rule 5 draft, the rule also states that the draftee must be active for at least 90 days. This keeps teams from drafting players, then placing them on the injured list for the majority of the season. For example, if a Rule 5 draftee was only active for 67 days in his first season with his new club, he must be active for an additional 23 days in his second season to satisfy the Rule 5 requirements. Any player chosen in the Rule 5 draft may be traded to any team while under the Rule 5 restrictions, but the restrictions transfer to the new team. If the new team does not want to keep the player on its 26-man roster for the season, he must be offered back to the team of which he was a member when chosen in the draft. Selection eligibility Players are eligible for selection in the Rule 5 draft if they are not on their major league organization's 40-man roster and: * were 18 or younger on the June 5 preceding their signing and this is the fifth Rule 5 draft upcoming; or * were 19 or older on the June 5 preceding their signing and this is the fourth Rule 5 draft upcoming. These exemption periods (one year longer than those in effect previously) went into effect as part of a new Collective Bargaining Agreement in October 2006. The change took effect immediately, exempting many players from the 2006 Rule 5 draft even though they had been signed in some cases more than four years before the new agreement came into effect. Prior to the rule change, players were exempt from the first two or three Rule 5 drafts held after their signing (regardless of the year they were drafted), rather than from the first three or four Rule 5 drafts after their signing. There can be exceptions to these rules, however. Players may also be eligible to be selected due to having a previous contract voided and then resigning with their original signing team within a year. Notable players selected due to this rule include Wei-Chung Wang and Elvis Luciano. MLB Rule 5 Draft Cost and example To prevent excessive turnover in the minor league levels, each draftee costs $100,000. If the draftee does not stay on the selecting team's 26-man (major league) roster all season, the player must be offered back to his original team at half-price ($50,000). Prior to the 2017-2021 CBA, each draftee cost $50,000 and therefore $25,000 to be reacquired by his original team.http://m.mlb.com/glossary/transactions/rule-5-draft Organizations may also draft players from AA or lower to play for their AAA affiliates (for $12,000) and may draft players from A teams or lower to play for their AA affiliates (for $4,000).MLB Draft Rules - DraftSite.com.MLB Rule 5 Draft FAQ - MLB.com. The Rule 5 draft has opened opportunities for teams to take other teams' top prospects who may not be ready for the major leagues. A prominent example is Johan Santana, who was chosen in the 1999 Rule 5 draft by the Florida Marlins when the Houston Astros declined to put him on their 40-man roster, and then traded to the Minnesota Twins in a pre-arranged deal. The Twins kept Santana on their roster for the 2000 season, despite the pitcher's subpar performance that season (6.49 ERA). After the 2000 season, the Twins had the right to option Santana to their minor league system, but chose not to during the 2001 season. He was briefly optioned to Class AAA at the start of the 2002 season, then returned to the major leagues at the end of May and established himself as an above-average pitcher; he went on to win Cy Young Awards in 2004 and 2006. Santana had not played above Class A in minor league baseball before being chosen in the Rule 5 draft.

Noble (November 30, 1922 ‚Äì December 21, 2016) was an American music educator and conductor. The Ervin and Phyllis Johnson Professor of Music Emeritus at Luther College since 2005, he was best known for his 57-year tenure on the faculty as conductor of the Nordic Choir from 1948 to 2005 and the Luther College Concert Band from 1948 to 1973. He served as guest director for over 800 music festivals in all three media, choral, orchestral and wind, spanning four continents. Following retirement from Luther in 2005, he engaged in a series of guest professorships at sister Lutheran colleges in the Midwest: artist-in-residence at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where he taught in the music department and conducted the Carthage Choir; visiting professor and interim conductor of the Wartburg Choir at Wartburg College in Waverly, Iowa; and guest conductor of the Augustana Choir at Augustana College in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Biography= Early life and education  Weston Henry Noble was born and raised on a farm located just west of Riceville, Iowa to parents of English ancestry. Later, he was confirmed in the Free Methodist Church and received his early education in a country one-room schoolhouse until the eighth grade, afterward attending the local Riceville High School. Like many young Iowans with an interest in music at that time, Noble played in the high school band, sang in the choir, and played clarinet solos at state music contest. He first demonstrated his talents when taking piano lessons at the urging of his paternal aunt, Ruby (Noble) Dunton, and came to master the clarinet, organ, and piano as well. Graduating from high school at the age of 16, his original intention was to enroll at The University of Iowa, then the largest and most prominent institution of higher learning in the state. Through the influence of his father, Merwin Henry Noble, Weston enrolled instead at nearby Luther College in Decorah in 1939. Majoring in history with studies in music (not yet a major at the college), he quickly drew the attention of the music faculty due to his demonstrated talents in conducting, which were sparked, according to Noble, by the last minute request of Schola Cantorum director Theodore Hoelty-Nickel to lead a rehearsal of the choir in his absence. In his second year, he began leading rehearsals for the ensemble. He completed his student teaching at the local Decorah High School.  Military career  Due largely to the intense patriotism of World War II and anticipating eventual conscription, Noble volunteered for military service and was called to active duty in February 1943, in the spring semester of his senior year. Nevertheless, arrangements were made for him and others to accelerate their studies and complete their final semester prior to commencement. He graduated magna cum laude. Trained as a tank driver, he saw action in the Battle of the Bulge in 1944 and was part of the main Allied thrust into the heart of Nazi Germany in 1945. Noble \\"liberated\\" some items from Berlin during the initial stages of the Allied occupation which he mailed home. After arriving home and teaching high school for a year in Iowa, Noble's father sent him a letter notifying him that he had a large package to pick up. The package contained a marble bust of Beethoven possibly previously owned by Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring. It was somehow acquired by an acquaintance of Noble who attended the Nuremberg Trials. Today the sculpture is being analyzed to find out who made it and when it was made.  Teaching  Discharged from military service, Noble returned to Iowa in 1946 and took a position as a high school teacher in Lu Verne, where he directed the school's music program and taught courses in the social sciences. After a two-year stint, he began graduate studies in music at the University of Michigan. In 1948, his alma mater, Luther College, sought him out to fill a one-year faculty appointment as interim director of the band and choir. His appointment was extended to two years, and then became more permanent beginning in 1950. During a highly distinguished 57-year career, Noble served as music director of the Luther College Concert Band from 1948‚Äì1973 and the Nordic Choir from 1948-2005. Following his retirement, he served a one-year appointment as visiting conductor-in-residence at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wisconsin during the 2007-08 academic year. During 2008-09, Mr. Noble conducted The Wartburg Choir and Ritterchor at a nearby sister institution, Wartburg College, in Waverly, Iowa.  Musical activities  Noble was an internationally acclaimed conductor as well as a music educator. His distinguished career included conducting more than 900 music festivals throughout the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, Russia, Asia, and South America. The venues included Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall in New York, the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., the Los Angeles Music Center, Chicago Orchestra Hall, the Ordway Theater in St. Paul, Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis, and the Bolshoi, Kremlin and Tchaikovsky Halls in Moscow. He is the only director to have led all-state choruses, bands and orchestras in all fifty states. In 2006, Noble was guest director of a choir partly made up of Nordic Choir alumni. This choir had a two-week concert tour of Europe in which they held a residence at the Salzburg Festival. From that tour was formed the Weston Noble Alumni Choir, a 70-voice choir that meets on the campus of Luther College every summer for a week of rehearsals and a performance. The Alumni Choir returned to Europe in 2010 for a two-week concert tour and in the summer of 2012 completed a one-week tour of California. In the spring of 2006, he conducted the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in a national radio broadcast. He also received the Distinguished Service Award from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, making him the only non-Mormon to ever receive this award. In June 2006, he was once again the guest conductor at Guam's 3rd Annual Pacific Summer Music Festival. Most recently he guest conducted the JMU ACDA Choral Fest. In December 2010, at the age of 88 years, Noble traveled to South Korea for the first time, conducting a concert of Handel's \\"Messiah\\" for the Camarata Music Company. Noble died in December 2016 at the age of 94 of complications from a fall.http://www.classicalmpr.org/story/2015/07/27/weston- noble-the-legacy-of-an-american-choral-giant Legacy Noble built the 72-voice Nordic Choir into one of the most elite a cappella college choirs in the United States. His Nordic Choir has performed throughout the United States and, indeed, much of the world. He served as guest conductor at more than 950 music festivals around the world.

In fact, in the sanctum sanctorum, we see the idol of Valampuri Varasiddhi Vinayakar with Consort Siddhi held at His left. Over this idol, we see a small Ganesh Idol. This was the original idol that was being worshipped at the original site. Subsequent developments took place rapidly, like, construction of an auditorium behind the praharam on the eastern side and Goshala. The Temple conducts music program during Vinayakar Chathurthi time in this auditorium, which is also permitted for the conduct of musical / cultural programs by other organizations.

Major Characters = Magicians  The Magicians of Xanth are a subset of fictional characters from the Xanth series of fantasy genre novels by Piers Anthony (b. 1934). The Magicians are usually humans. They possess powerful magical abilities, and so are the only humans who are able to take the role of King of Human Xanth.

When Arnolde is ninety, his magic is discovered and he is banished from Centaur Isle by his fellow centaurs. Arnolde is well regarded by humans, however, because his magical ability enabled the rescue of King Trent and Queen Iris from a Mundanian prison. He is an acting-king during the reign of Trent. In Night Mare, when Arnolde is ninety-eight, he is for a short time, a centaur king. During his reign, he declares that Sorceresses are merely female Magicians, and therefore eligible to serve as Kings of Xanth.

Bink is banished for not possessing a magic talent when, in fact, he does possess magical ability. Bink's magic does not want to be known because, if it were, those of non-magical means would injure Bink and his family, with the magic being indirectly responsible. Hence, in order to keep itself hidden, Bink's magic works in quiet ways, by seeming coincidence, and very few people know of it.

A small moon called Ptero orbits over her, holding every person in Xanth there ever was or might be. The Ida on Ptero has another moon (Pyramid) where the inhabitants use a barter system that results in givers gaining size and receivers losing size. This Ida has Torus, whose Ida has Cone, whose Ida has Dumbbell, and so on. This continues into infinity, with each moon having different shapes, inhabitants, and rules.

Ivy is capable of enhancing any quality she desires, or even to make things as she unconsciously perceives them; for example, when she first met Humprey's son Hugo, who was described as mentally slow and had the talent to conjure rotten fruit, she enhanced his qualities while he was in her presence, making him more intelligent and giving him the ability to conjure ripe fruit, all because she perceived him as intelligent.

He is an elderly, withered, gnome-like man with five and a half wives. Humfrey is very curious and has a good memory. He is said to possess all knowledge, but his magical talent is actually the ability to find the answers to all questions. In Heaven Cent it is implied that Humfrey's magical talent may be no more than that of locating other magic that may be of use to him. His story of becoming a master of information is recounted in Question Quest. Humfrey believes his magical abilities are not those of a Magician, and so he studies for a degree in magic at Demon University in order to validate his title of Magician. Humfrey was a king pro-tem during Trent's reign. He lives in the Good Magician's Castle, the former Castle Zombie. It is an enchanted place that provides easy access for Humfrey, but any visitor must face three challenges posed by him. Visitors must prove their worthiness to approach Humphrey with their queries.

Four years into his reign, Aeolus made an edict that anyone born without a magic talent would be exiled from Xanth. In his later years, Aeolus fell into senility, a fact he never acknowledged. In Question Quest, Good Magician Humfrey has flashbacks that give details as to how Humphrey found Aeolus, how Aeolus became king and how he made his edict. Later in the series, in Xone of Contention, Magician Grey and Robota, a golem, travel back in time to the events of A Spell for Chameleon. They meet Aeolus and learn he is not the fool he appears: Aeolus keeps his soul in a soular cell that was created centuries before by Magician Yin/Yang. The cell prevents the aging and death of the person whose soul is held within. However, the cell cannot undo aging that occurred before the person's soul was stored. Aeolus' magic resides with his soul, which he removes from the cell only when he needs to use it. Aeolus claims he does not need his soul day to day, and that he feigns senility in order to avoid mundane tasks, but Grey realises that Aeolus' unconscionable behaviour is the result of his lack of soul. Aeolus' efforts to stave off death fail, and he succumbs shortly after Grey and Robota depart. He is succeeded by Magician Trent. = Trent = Magician Trent has been a major character in the Xanth series since the very beginning. He is the nineteenth king of Xanth and is married to Sorceress Iris. Trent's power allows him to transform any living thing into any other living thing. Whatever form he renders becomes one's \\"natural\\" form. Any offspring sired or birthed while in a form will be in that form. In his childhood, Trent was trained by Good Magician Humfrey. After trying to take the throne, he was exiled to Mundania for 20 years, then returned to Xanth and was crowned King after the passing of the Storm King. He later retired and moved to the North Village with Sorceress Iris. The Magician of Transformation, King Trent used to be referred to as the Evil Magician for attempting to take over the throne prior to A Spell for Chameleon. For this offense he was exiled to Mundania. There he married, and he and his wife had a son, but he lost them both to illness. Later he was accidentally helped back into Xanth by Magician Bink and Chameleon. After the Storm King died, Trent was made king on the condition that he marry Sorceress Iris. He did so, but only out of convenience; it took him over twenty years to recover from the loss of his first wife and son. Eventually, though, Trent came to love Iris. He stepped down as king in the 6th Xanth novel, Night Mare, after which Bink's son Magician Dor became the new King of Xanth, with Trent's daughter Sorceress Irene as his wife. Trent now lives in quiet retirement in North Village. He was instrumental in all of the first six Xanth books, but was featured as a main character in A Spell for Chameleon and Centaur Aisle. Later in the series, he makes a rejuvenated appearance in Harpy Thyme. He remains one of the few people to recognize Bink's extraordinary talent.  Minor Characters = Beauregard the Demon  A highly intelligent demon of Xanth who is writing a doctoral thesis on the supremacy of demons over other lifeforms entitled \\"Fallibilities of Other Intelligent Life in Xanth\\". He repaid a debt to the Good Magician Humfrey, incurred by seeking information from him on other lifeforms, by serving time in a small vial answering questions for people. After repaying the debt, he stayed in the vial to gain further information. Beauregard met Good Magician Humfrey in demon school, where they became friends and greeted each other with insults. In the book Air Apparent, it is revealed that he works as a tour guide in hell, and has fallen in love with Angela Angel, when their toes accidentally brushed a love spring while they were arguing with each other. Angela later returns in Knot Gneiss trying to find substance so she and Beauregard can be together in Xanth.  The Brain Coral  A form of coral kept in stasis in preservative fluids in the land of Xanth. Its goal was to prevent the awakening of the Demon X(A/N)th, but it failed. Many people are held, or have been held, in its preservative fluids for eventual release including (Neo-)Sorceress Vadne, Magician Murphy, and Harold Harpy. The Brain Coral was a main character in the book The Source of Magic.  Chlorine  The wife of the Demon X(A/N)th and mother of Nimbus. She lives in the Nameless Castle. Her talent is to form poison from water (more like the chlorine used to clean things with). Before she met Demon X(A/N)th, she was plain, mean, and stupid. She wished to be smart, nice, and beautiful, and Nimby (Demon X(A/N)th in disguise) changed her. She had only one tear left in her eyes, half a tear in each, and if she was to cry that last tear, she would become blind. In the end she shed the tear when Nimby was set on fire by her horrible parents. Nimby and Chlorine have a son named Nimbus. She has a twin sister named Fluorine, who unfortunately is just as mean and nasty as Chlorine used to be.  Demon X(A/N)th  The Demon whose extended presence created Xanth's magic. He is constantly at battle with Earth, Jupiter, Neptune, and other Demons who represent the planets in an astral game of gaining recognition. Earth is currently the most recognized one with Xanth coming dead last because nobody seems to believe in it. X(A/N)th first appears in the second book, The Source of Magic, and is the star of the 20th Xanth book, Yon Ill Wind (as Nimby, a horrendously ugly donkey-headed dragon), and the 23rd, Xone of Contention. He currently enjoys living in the floating castle with his consort Chlorine and son Nimbus. He has also been known to travel in the form of Nimby.  Fracto  Also called Cumulo-Fracto-Nimbus, this demon cloud roams the land of Xanth, blowing up storms to cause mischief. Later, he tamed Happy Bottom in the Region of Air and had a daughter, Fray Cloud (Fracto and Happy Bottom). He was introduced in Centaur Aisle and appeared in many subsequent books.  The Gap Dragon  The Gap Dragon or Stanley Steamer is a dragon that lives in the Gap Chasm that runs the width of Xanth. Because the Gap Chasm had a forget spell put on it by Dor in Castle Roogna, nobody could remember it and therefore couldn't remember the dragon, making anyone who entered the Chasm easy prey. In Dragon on a Pedestal, he was de-aged at the fountain of youth, after which he was befriended by three-year-old Princess Ivy. Ivy renamed him Stanley Steamer because the Gap Dragon can only breathe steam, not fire. After an accident with Jordan The Barbarian, Stanley was sent far away. He was later found by Jordan The Barbarian, Threnody, Grundy The Golem, Rapunzel, and Snortimer at a Faun and Nymph lake retreat. The Gap Dragon still today protects the Gap Chasm from intruders, catching prey, and always being a faithful friend to Princess Ivy. He is married to Stella/Stacey Steamer (Princess Ivy named her Stacey but the Xanth lexicon put it down as Stella). They alternate guarding the Gap Chasm and watching their son Steven.  Happy Bottom  Formerly called Tropical Storm Gladys, Happy Bottom was blown into Xanth from Mundania when the Demon X(A/N)th entered the land of Xanth, stirring out magic dust and causing madness. She was tamed by Fracto later. Their daughter is Fray Cloud.  Jenny Elf and Sammy Cat  Jenny is named after a fan of the Xanth series who corresponded with Piers Anthony after a severe car accident that left her partially paralyzed. Jenny, who is based on the elves of the ElfQuest series by Wendy and Richard Pini, comes from the world of Two Moons. Her constant companion is her cat Sammy, who can find anything but home. Her friends are Che Centaur and Gwendolyn Goblin. They are introduced in Isle of View. Jenny marries the werewolf Prince Jeremy in Zombie Lover. Sammy Cat, who is named for the Mundanian Jenny's pet cat, has his own adventure as a main character in Up in a Heaval, meeting his own true love Claire Voyant Cat in the process.  Justin Tree  A man transformed into a tree by Trent for 76 years in the Xanth universe. He rejected offers to be transformed back into a man and seems to like being a tree during that time. His talent is Voice Projection, letting him speak from anywhere without the use of his vocal cords, and he retained this ability even as a tree. By the time of the novel Zombie Lover, he eventually felt a desire to have an adventure of his own. With his spirit temporarily anchored to Breanna of the Black Wave, he traveled around Xanth with her, and the pair ultimately fell in love. In the process, he and Breanna developed a newfound appreciation for the zombies of Xanth, and he agreed to become the new Zombie Master in place of Jonathan, who was seeking to retire. Justin was subsequently returned to human form and took youth elixir to restore him to the age of 18, spending the next three years with Breanna and marrying her when he was 21 again (following the events of Swell Foop, during which time he bore the Ring of Idea), then assuming the duties of the Zombie Master full-time. He and Breanna subsequently became the parents of a child named Amber Dawn, who had been delivered by the time of Cube Route.  Okra Ogress  An ogress born with the talent of a supersonic voice. Having her ogre characteristics diluted by having accidentally gotten a magic talent she isn't as ugly and stupid as a normal ogre. Because of this she wanted to be a main character since nothing bad happens to a main character. She traveled with Mela Merwoman and Ida in \\"The Color of Her Panties\\" in order to ask the Good Magician Humfrey. She marries Smithereen Ogre and has two children with him: Og and Not-Og  Sim  Son and heir to Simurgh. He is being tutored by Che Centaur. He has dated Ilene, the second daughter of Trent and Iris.

She married Chex Centaur to Chieron Centaur, and commanded all winged monsters to protect their son Che. Her chick is Sim.  Snortimer  Snortimer is the monster under Ivy's bed in the land of Xanth. He loves to grab at pretty young ankles. He will fade out of existence when Ivy gets too old to believe in bed monsters. He stayed with the fauns and nymphs in place of Stanley Steamer (the Gap Dragon).  Volney Vole  The mate of Wilda Wiggle, Volney was a main character in Vale of the Vole. Volney replaces his S's with V's in speech; however, to his ears, S's from others sound like hissing.  Fray Cloud  Daughter of Fracto and Happy Bottom.

It has been called one of the five biggest porn studios and, in 2006, was described by Reuters as one of the handful of studios that dominate the U.S. porn industry. History Adult director Joone founded the company in 1993, originally making adult CD-ROM computer games. The company became an innovator in making pornography available on personal computers. In 2003, DP began working with a company specializing in hologram technology, with the aim of bringing the actress \\"into the viewer's living room\\". DP began filming in high-definition in 2005. In January 2006 the company chose Blu-ray Disc over rival format HD DVD because Joone felt Blu-ray Disc was more future- proofed. DP initially had difficulty finding a company prepared to produce its films in the Blu-ray Disc format, as companies that replicated DVDs were reluctant to deal with the pornography industry. The Digital Playground studios have been at the forefront for iPads, HD and three-dimension technology for cinema and television in the porn industry.\\"Superbrands' success fuelled by sex, religion and gossip\\" BBC, May 16, 2011 The company has claimed that \\"many technology brands have used the adult industry (and DP, in particular), to test new markets\\" because of \\"the sheer scale of the porn industry\\". The studio was acquired by Manwin in March 2012. Innovation Digital Playground introduced the virtual sex genre of CD-ROMs and DVDs, in which the viewer can control a famous pornographic actress by selecting from a menu of explicit scenes. The first film in the series was released in 1998. In the series the actress looks directly at the camera, and appears to talk directly to the viewer. Virtual Sex with Jenna Jameson is one of the best- selling adult DVDs of all time according to adultdvdempire.com sales charts. In 2004, Digital Playground produced the first HD pornographic film, Island Fever 3, shot on location in Tahiti and Bora Bora.

The game was endorsed by professional off-road racer Ivan Stewart. Virgin Games produced several home versions in 1990. In 1991, a home console version for the Nintendo Entertainment System was later released by Leland's Tradewest subsidiary, followed by versions for most major home formats including the Master System, Genesis, Super NES, Amiga, and DOS. A port for the Atari Jaguar was announced but never released. Some of the ports removed Ivan Stewart's name from the title due to licensing issues and are known simply as Super Off Road. Gameplay Arcade version screenshot. In the game, up to three players (four in the NES version through use of either the NES Satellite or NES Four Score) compete against each other or the computer in racing around several top-view indoor off-road truck tracks of increasing difficulty. There are eight different tracks (twelve in the SMS version and sixteen in the SNES version) and 99 races altogether on most versions (the SNES version loops through 64 races without ending). All races are raced more than once. First place results earn the player points to continue in the championship and money with which to upgrade their truck or buy more nitro. The goal is to reach the end of the season with the most money earned. Continues are available but whereas players can get extra money in the arcade version, in the home versions, the player's money is reset to zero. This is one of the first games where the player could upgrade his or her vehicle by earning points or money (although in Atari Games' Sprint series, one could upgrade their racer using wrenches), a system that is used in many racing games today. The Spectrum version of the game was voted number 47 in the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time. The game was ranked the 35th best game of all time by Amiga Power.Amiga Power magazine issue 0, Future Publishing, May 1991 MegaTech gave the game a score of 83%Super Off-Road rating, MegaTech, EMAP, issue 12, page 96, December 1992 Licensing In the original arcade game, the red, blue, and yellow CPU trucks were 'driven' by \\"Madman\\" Sam Powell, \\"Hurricane\\" Earl Stratton, and \\"Jammin'\\" John Morgan, respectively. The names were taken from the development staff: Sam composed the music, and Earl and John were two of the software programmers. The Track Pack added \\"Steamin'\\" Steve High and \\"Hot Rod\\" John Rowe, representing graphics and project direction, respectively. By using these names, this meant that further licensing deals were not required. The Super NES version was notable for prominently featuring the Toyota brand; the name and logo were displayed on various tracks, and pre-race music was inspired by the \\"I love what you do for me Toyota\\" jingle that was used by the company's marketing campaign at the time of the game's release. This version also lacked any licensing or reference to Ivan Stewart, replacing him instead with the late Mickey Thompson in the gray truck (primarily without approval from Danny Thompson). The NES version does have the Toyota label on its cartridge art, but otherwise the ad is not present. The game was not originally developed or published by Williams, Midway, or Atari Games, but by the Leland Corporation (which was acquired by WMS Industries, the holding company of said developers, in 1994). Both the arcade version of the game and its Track Pack upgrade can be found in Midway Arcade Treasures 3 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. However, it does not have the \\"Ironman\\" Ivan Stewart license, and as such is known simply as Super Off Road, with the white, computer-controlled car being \\"driven\\" by \\"'Lightning' Kevin Lydy\\" (in the original arcade cabinet, the white car is \\"driven\\" by Ivan Stewart), a real-life graphic designer on the original arcade game, continuing the previous tradition regarding the CPU drivers being named for its programmers. Super Off Road was also included in the 2012 compilation Midway Arcade Origins for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Upgrades Screenshot of Ivan \\"Ironman\\" Stewart's Super Off Road: The Track Pack. The Track Pack, released in 1989, was an add-on board for arcade units that contains eight brand new tracks: Shortcut, Cutoff Pass, Pig Bog, Rio Trio, Leapin' Lizards, Redoubt About, Boulder Hill, and Volcano Valley. It also gave the brand new ability for players to choose between either the regular truck or the dune buggy; both vehicles had different characteristics accordingly and added a new element to the game. Reception Sinclair User rated the arcade version an 8 out of 10 and recommended the game to anyone who enjoyed playing the Sprint games, calling Super Off Road \\"Super Sprint with dirt\\".Super Off Road. Sinclair User. May 1989. p. 83. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Lynx version a 3.75 out of 10, commenting that though Super Off Road was an excellent arcade game, the choppy animation and scrolling in the Lynx version make it almost unplayable. Sequels Super Off Road gained a number of sequels, the first was titled Super Off Road: The Baja. It was released for the SNES in 1993 and is based on the Baja 1000 race. The format was changed to a third-person camera instead of an overhead camera. In 1997, an arcade sequel, Off Road Challenge, was released, which again adopted the third-person 3D driving view, and was ported to the Nintendo 64 in 1998. The second sequel, Offroad Thunder, was released in arcades in 1999, but not ported to consoles until the release of Midway Arcade Treasures 3 in 2005.

President Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of State William H. Seward, representing the Union, met with three commissioners from the Confederacy: Vice President Alexander H. Stephens, Senator Robert M. T. Hunter, and Assistant Secretary of War John A. Campbell. The representatives discussed a possible alliance against France, the possible terms of surrender, the question of whether slavery might persist after the war, and the question of whether the South would be compensated for property lost through emancipation. Lincoln and Seward reportedly offered some possibilities for compromise on the issue of slavery. The only concrete agreement reached was over prisoner-of-war exchanges. The Confederate commissioners immediately returned to Richmond at the conclusion of the conference. Confederate President Jefferson Davis announced that the North would not compromise. Lincoln drafted an amnesty agreement based on terms discussed at the Conference, but met with opposition from his Cabinet. John Campbell continued to advocate for a peace agreement and met again with Lincoln after the fall of Richmond on April 2. Overtures for peace In 1864, pressure mounted for both sides to seek a peace settlement to end the long and devastating Civil War.Johnson, \\"Lincoln's Solution to the Problem of Peace Terms\\" (1968), p. 576. Several people had sought to broker a North‚ÄìSouth peace treaty in 1864. Francis Preston Blair, a personal friend of both Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis, had unsuccessfully encouraged Lincoln to make a diplomatic visit to Richmond. Blair had advocated to Lincoln that the war could be brought to a close by having the two opposing sections of the nation stand down in their conflict, and reunite on grounds of the Monroe Doctrine in attacking the French-installed Emperor Maximilian in Mexico.Harris (2000). Lincoln asked Blair to wait until Savannah had been captured.Donald, Lincoln (1995), p. 556. South Alexander Stephens had been trying to end the war since 1863. Davis was pressed for options as the Confederacy faced collapse and defeat. Peace movements in the South had been active since the beginning of the war, and intensified in 1864.Sanders, \\"Jefferson Davis and the Hampton Roads Peace Conference\\" (1997), pp. 804‚Äì805. =Alexander Stephens= Alexander H. Stephens, Vice President of the Confederate States, had by 1863 become an active advocate for ending the war.Sanders, \\"Jefferson Davis and the Hampton Roads Peace Conference\\" (1997), pp. 806‚Äì807. \\"Stephens was also the best-known peace advocate in the South. In June 1863 he had petitioned President Davis for permission to proceed to Washington to resolve prisoner of war issues and, if the circumstances warranted, to engage Union authorities in discussions that might lead to 'a correct understanding and agreement between the two governments . . . .' In July 1863, the Southern vice president was poised to enter Washington and initiate negotiations, but the Confederate defeat at Gettysburg doomed his efforts at obtaining an audience with President Abraham Lincoln.\\" Stephens had almost begun negotiations with Lincoln in July 1863, but his efforts were thwarted after Confederate defeat in the Battle of Gettysburg. By 1864, Stephens was an outright dissident against the power of Davis's CSA government, and was invited by General William T. Sherman to discuss independent peace negotiations between the State of Georgia and the federal Union. Stephens addressed the Confederate States Senate as its nominal presiding officer in Richmond on January 6, 1865, urging peace talks with the North. Some Confederate legislators agreed with Stephens and began to agitate for negotiations.Sanders, \\"Jefferson Davis and the Hampton Roads Peace Conference\\" (1997), p. 808. =John Campbell= John Campbell, another of the peace commissioners, had also opposed secession. Campbell served earlier on the Supreme Court of the United States from 1853 to 1861, but began to consider resignation after Lincoln's first inaugural address in March 1861. He stayed on for the spring term of 1861 and supported the Corwin Amendment to protect slavery from federal intervention.Mann, The Political and Constitutional Thought of John Archibald Campbell (1966), p. 194.Johnson, \\"Fort Sumter and Confederate Diplomacy\\" (1960), pp. 455‚Äì456. \\"This widely esteemed gentleman was destined to have the vital role of intermediary during the rest of the negotiations. As the secession crisis had developed, Campbell had shown himself wholeheartedly devoted to the cause of peace; to him all other questions were secondary.\\" John A. Campbell had already attempted once to broker peace between Confederates and the Lincoln administration. Hoping to prevent a war, Samuel Nelson enlisted Campbell to help broker negotiations over the status of Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor in South Carolina. On March 15, Campbell relayed to Martin Jenkins Crawford a supposed promise from Secretary of State Seward that the federal government would evacuate Fort Sumter within five days.Johnson, \\"Fort Sumter and Confederate Diplomacy\\" (1960), pp. 458‚Äì459. \\"Seward said he could inform Southerners that Sumter would be vacated within five days, and that the government did not intend to make any changes with regard to the Gulf of Mexico coastal forts. Later that morning Campbell went to Martin Crawford and told him that he was satisfied that Fort Sumter would be given up within five days and that there would be no change with respect to the Gulf forts.\\" As the Fort remained occupied on March 21, Confederate commissioners pushed Campbell to find out more; Seward reassured Campbell that evacuation would take place and Campbell reassured Crawford: on March 21, March 22, April 1, and hesitantly on April 7.Johnson, \\"Fort Sumter and Confederate Diplomacy\\" (1960), pp. 460‚Äì466. \\"Thereupon the commissioners asked Campbell to see Seward and find out what was the matter. Campbell and Nelson took newly appointed Confederate commander of South Carolina forces, General Beauregard's telegram and went to the State Department building east of the White House on the 21st. They found Seward too busy for an extended conference, although he did take time to assure them that everything was all right and to make an appointment with them the following afternoon. On the strength of the Secretary's remarks Campbell left a memorandum with the Crawford commission reaffirming his confidence that steps had been taken to evacuate Sumter and that no changes unfavorable to the South would be made at Fort Pickens.\\" Lincoln had already ordered the fort resupplied. By April 12th, diplomacy had evidently failed and the Bombardment of Fort Sumter began. Campbell resigned his position on the Supreme Court and went South. Fearing he would be persecuted as a Union sympathizer in his home state of Alabama, he moved instead to New Orleans.Mann, The Political and Constitutional Thought of John Archibald Campbell (1966), pp. 23, 198‚Äì199. \\"In Campbell's own words, he was 'coldly received and came near being mobbed' upon his return to Alabama, following the close of the Spring Term of the Supreme Court in 1861.\\" Campbell declined a number of positions in the CSA government, but accepted the post of Assistant Secretary of War in President Davis' cabinet in 1862.Mann, The Political and Constitutional Thought of John Archibald Campbell (1966), p. 99. For the duration of the job, Campbell was criticized for trying to limit the scope of wartime conscription.Mann, The Political and Constitutional Thought of John Archibald Campbell (1966), pp. 202‚Äì209. By late 1864, he was pushing again for an end to the war. In an 1865 letter to Judge Benjamin R. Curtis, he described the disastrous state of the Confederacy and marveled: \\"You would suppose there could be no difficulty in convincing men under such circumstances that peace was required. But when I look back upon the events of the winter, I find that I was incessantly employed in making these facts known and to no result.\\"Mann, The Political and Constitutional Thought of John Archibald Campbell (1966), pp. 209‚Äì210. North Lincoln would clearly insist on full sovereignty of the Union. Slavery posed a more difficult problem. The Republican platform in 1864 had explicitly endorsed abolition; but pushing too hard on the slavery issue might offend mainstream politicians and voters.Johnson, \\"Lincoln's Solution to the Problem of Peace Terms\\" (1968), pp. 577‚Äì578. \\"The lowest common denominator of all the important factions was the preservation of the Union, but if Lincoln did not go beyond that in negotiating with the South, he would be repudiating his party's platform and would irrevocably alienate the Radicals. Yet if he made abolition a sine qua non, he would offend conservative Republicans and War Democrats. No matter what his offer, it seemed that the Democrats' chances in November would be improved. Still he could not simply remain silent (so desperate was the longing for peace) should an occasion for negotiations arise.\\" Within this precarious political situation, in July 1864 Lincoln issued a statement via Horace Greeley:\\"The Sham Peace Negotiation\\", New York Times, 16 August 1864. Lincoln confided to James W. Singleton that his primary concern was the Union. In Singleton's words: \\"that he never has and never will present any other ultimatum‚Äîthat he is misunderstood on the subject of slavery‚Äîthat it shall not stand in the way of peace\\".Johnson, \\"Lincoln's Solution to the Problem of Peace Terms\\" (1968), p. 579 Lincoln's reassurance earned him Singleton's support in the 1864 election.Johnson, \\"Lincoln's Solution to the Problem of Peace Terms\\" (1968), pp. 579‚Äì580. \\"So impressed was Singleton with what the South could expect from Lincoln that he refused to support the Democratic candidate George Brinton McClellan, who he believed would be more severe.\\" Seward openly suggested in September 1864 that if the Confederate States relented on the question of independence, the question of slavery would fall \\"to the arbitrament of courts of law, and to the councils of legislation\\". (He did not mention the ongoing debate over what became the Thirteenth Amendment, and declined to clarify his position in written correspondence.) Seward invited the South to return to the \\"common ark of our national security and happiness\\" as \\"brethren who have come back from their wanderings\\".Cox & Cox, Politics, Principle, and Prejudice (1963), p. 4., p. 37. Having won the election, Lincoln told Congress that reaching a peace agreement with Davis would be unlikely: \\"He affords us no excuse to deceive ourselves. He cannot voluntarily reaccept the Union; we cannot voluntarily yield it.\\" However, said Lincoln, the South could end the War by laying down arms:Johnson, \\"Lincoln's Solution to the Problem of Peace Terms\\" (1968), pp. 580‚Äì581. > They can, at any moment, have peace simply by laying down their arms and > submitting to the national authority under the Constitution. . . . If > questions should remain, we would adjust them by the peaceful means of > legislation, conference, courts, and votes, operating only in constitutional > and lawful channels. . . . In presenting the abandonment of armed resistance > to the national authority on the part of the insurgents, as the only > indispensable condition to ending the war on the part of the government, I > retract nothing heretofore said as to slavery. I repeat the declaration made > a year ago, that \\"while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt > to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall I return to > slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation, or by any > of the Acts of Congress. Preparation for conference Blair duly renewed his efforts in January 1865, and traveled to Richmond on January 11. He met with Davis and outlined a plan to end the war, based partly on a North‚ÄìSouth alliance against the French presence in Mexico. Blair assured Davis that Lincoln had become more willing to negotiate.Sanders, \\"Jefferson Davis and the Hampton Roads Peace Conference\\" (1997), p. 810‚Äì811. Francis Preston Blair traveled back and forth between Richmond, VA, and Washington, DC, relaying messages between Davis and Lincoln. On January 12, Davis wrote a letter inviting Lincoln to begin negotiations \\"with a view to secure peace to the two countries\\".Escott, \\"What Shall We Do with the Negro?\\" (2009), pp. 201‚Äì202. Lincoln replied, via Blair, that he would discuss only \\"securing peace to the people of one common country.\\"Escott, \\"What Shall We Do with the Negro?\\" (2009), p. 203.Ethan S. Rafuse, \\" Hampton Roads Conference\\"; Encyclopedia Virginia, 29 March 2011. Davis was upset by this response; Blair blamed the political climate in Washington. At Blair's suggestion, Davis proposed a meeting between Generals Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant.Sanders, \\"Jefferson Davis and the Hampton Roads Peace Conference\\" (1997), p. 813. Lincoln refused. Grant ultimately smoothed over the \\"two countries\\" dispute and convinced Lincoln to meet the Confederates at Fort Monroe.Donald, Lincoln (1995), p. 557. \\"At this point Grant, who was increasingly eager to finish off the war and who was not attuned to the niceties of diplomatic negotiations, intervened. He persuaded the commissioners to delete from their instructions the reference to two separate countries and wired to Washington that he hoped Lincoln could meet with them. Agreeing with Grant that to send the three Confederates back to Richmond 'without any expression from anyone in authority' would be impolitic, Lincoln forthwith joined Seward at Fort Monroe for a conference from which he expected little.\\" Davis appointed his three commissioners on January 28 and instructed them to explore all options short of renouncing independence.Sanders, \\"Jefferson Davis and the Hampton Roads Peace Conference\\" (1997), p. 817‚Äì819. (Davis's precise understanding of what an \\"independent\\" Confederacy might be, in 1865, is not fully clear.)Sanders, \\"Jefferson Davis and the Hampton Roads Peace Conference\\" (1997), p. 825. Of the three commissioners, Alexander Stephens and Robert Hunter wanted to focus more on the possibility of an alliance against France; Campbell focused more on a scenario for domestic peace.Mann, The Political and Constitutional Thought of John Archibald Campbell (1966), p. 16‚Äì17. \\"Stephens and Hunter seem to have been primarily concerned with Francis P. Blair's proposal for a combining of Northern and Southern forces for a joint war against Mexico, but Campbell's purpose was to secure a magnanimous peace for the Southern states.\\" Campbell wrote in his letter to Curtis:Mann, The Political and Constitutional Thought of John Archibald Campbell (1966), p. 210. > He duped Mr. Davis with the belief that President Lincoln regarded the > condition of Mexico with more concern than the war; that he would be willing > to make a suspension of hostilities under some sort of collusive contract, > and to unite Southern and Northern troops on the Rio Grande for the invasion > of Mexico, and that after matters were assured in Mexico affairs might be > adjusted here. This was the business at Hampton Roads. I was incredulous, > Mr. Hunter did not have faith. Mr. Stephens supposed Blair to be \\"the mentor > of the Administration and Republican party. The Union Congress was shaken by the news of possible Confederate peace negotiations in late January, just days before a rescheduled Thirteenth Amendment vote. Some Congress members feared that adopting an emancipation amendment would signal hostility and undermine the talks.Vorenberg, Final Freedom (2001), p. 205. The Thirteenth Amendment passed despite fears connected to the peace talks. Radical Republicans, hoping for a complete victory and stringent terms of surrender, were dismayed by the prospect of a compromise.Escott, \\"What Shall We Do with the Negro?\\" (2009), p. 203. \\"Radical Republicans distrusted the Blairs for their conservative views and their persistent influence over Lincoln. They also believed, reasonably enough, that the war would soon come to a successful end and that negotiations ran the risk of compromising away key elements of victory.\\" Opponents of the Amendment exploited these fears in an attempt to prevent its passage in the House. (Stephens later blamed this political reaction for the failure of the Conference.)Sanders, \\"Jefferson Davis and the Hampton Roads Peace Conference\\" (1997), p. 820. Reassurance from Lincoln's secretary John Hay was not convincing to Ohio Democrat Sunset Cox who demanded that Ashley investigate the rumor of impending negotiations. Lincoln issued a memo denying the arrival of Confederates‚Äîin Washington.Cox & Cox, Politics, Principle, and Prejudice (1963), p. 23.Vorenberg, Final Freedom (2001), pp. 205‚Äì206. \\"He eventually would meet them in Hampton Roads, Virginia, south of Washington, but he never intended to receive them in the nation's capital. To do so would contradict his position that the Confederacy was not a legitimate nation deserving official recognition. So Lincoln wrote a clever reply to Ashley to put the rumors to rest: 'So far as I know, there are no peace commissioners in the city, or likely to be in it.'\\" Cox investigated further, decided that Lincoln was \\"mistaken or ignorant\\", and shocked a crowd of onlookers by voting 'nay' to the Amendment.Vorenberg, Final Freedom (2001), pp. 206‚Äì207. \\"The Ohio War Democrat had planned to vote for the amendment and had even prepared a speech in its favor. But Cox now believed that, despite Lincoln's suggestion to the contrary, peace commissioners from Richmond were headed north, and that the adoption of the amendment might turn them back. To the surprise of many in the hall, the Ohioan voted nay.\\" When the Amendment passed anyway, two members of the \\"Seward lobby\\"‚ÄîGeorge O. Jones and William Bilbo‚Äîboth telegraphed congratulations to Seward and commented on his upcoming meeting with the Confederate diplomats. Historians LaWanda Cox and John Cox (no relation to Sunset Cox) wrote: \\"It is worthy of note that these messages of Jones and Bilbo implied a verbal commitment from the Secretary of State that passage of the Amendment would be coupled with a policy of peace and reconciliation which Southerners might accept with relief and Northern Democrats with enthusiasm.\\"Cox & Cox, Politics, Principle, and Prejudice (1963), p. 24. On January 29, a Confederate Officer with a flag of truce interrupted the Siege of Petersburg to announce the passage of the three Confederate peace commissioners.Sanders, \\"Jefferson Davis and the Hampton Roads Peace Conference\\" (1997), p. 803. Soldiers from both armies cheered.Sanders, \\"Jefferson Davis and the Hampton Roads Peace Conference\\" (1997), p. 818. On February 1, Seward dropped off a copy of the new amendment in Annapolis, then departed with the River Queen for Fort Monroe.Stahr, Seward (2012), p. 421. Conference Scene from Hampton Roads, Virginia. Lincoln and Stephens had been political allies before the war and the meeting began on friendly terms.Escott, \\"What Shall We Do with the Negro?\\" (2009), p. 205. Stephens discussed the topic of a military alliance against France in Mexico, but Lincoln cut him off and asked directly about the question of sovereignty. Prodded by Campbell, Lincoln insisted that the South would have to disband its armies and submit to federal authority. Campbell wrote: \\"We learned in five minutes that the assurances to Mr. Davis were a delusion, and that union was the condition of peace.\\"Mann, The Political and Constitutional Thought of John Archibald Campbell (1966), p. 211. On the question of slavery, Lincoln reportedly told the Confederates that Northern opinion was divided on the question of how new laws would be enforced. Regarding the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln reportedly interpreted it as a war measure that would permanently affect only the 200,000 people who came under Army protection during the War‚Äîbut noted that the Courts might feel differently.Johnson, \\"Lincoln's Solution to the Problem of Peace Terms\\" (1968), p. 581.Escott, \\"What Shall We Do with the Negro?\\" (2009), p. 219. \\"As a consequence of his view of the Constitution, he favored and repeatedly proposed a method of emancipation that would depend entirely upon state initiative and state choice, even if the federal government might help. For the same reason, he viewed his Emancipation Proclamation as a war measure, a step to be chosen only by the commander in chief, to be justified only by 'actual armed rebellion,' and to become inoperative as soon as the war itself ceased. Likewise, he told Confederate commissioners that in the judgement of the courts this war measure might apply only to 200,000 black Americans who had actually experienced its benefits.\\" Seward reportedly showed the Confederates a copy of the newly adopted Thirteenth Amendment, referred to this document also as a war measure,Johnson, \\"Lincoln's Solution to the Problem of Peace Terms\\" (1968), p. 582. and suggested that if they were to rejoin the Union they might be able to prevent its ratification.Escott, \\"What Shall We Do with the Negro?\\" (2009), p. 206. After further discussion, Lincoln suggested that the Southern states might \\"avoid, as far as possible, the evils of immediate emancipation\\" by ratifying the Amendment \\"prospectively, so as to take effect‚Äîsay in five years.\\" Seward and Lincoln denied that they were demanding \\"unconditional surrender\\"; Seward said that rejoining the Union, under the Constitution, could not \\"properly be considered as unconditional submission to conquerors, or as having anything humiliating in it.\\" Lincoln also offered possible compensation for emancipation, perhaps naming the figure of $400,000,000 which he later proposed to Congress. Reportedly, Seward disagreed with Lincoln; Lincoln responded that the North had been complicit in the slave trade.Stahr, Seward (2012), p. 426. The Conference ended with agreement on prisoner-of-war exchange. Lincoln would release Stephens' nephew in exchange for a Northern official in Richmond‚Äîand would recommend that Grant establish a system for prisoner exchange. Historical uncertainties There are no official records of the conference itself, so all reports originate from the subsequent commentary of involved parties.Escott, \\"What Shall We Do with the Negro?\\" (2009), p. 204. \\"Historians have debated ever since precisely what was said at the conference. No records were kept of the discussion as it was taking place, and so scholars have had to rely on accounts written later, principally recollections by two of the Confederate commissioners, John A. Campbell and Alexander H. Stephens.\\" The two lengthy accounts of the Conference‚Äîwritten by Confederates Stephens and Campbell‚Äîconcur on most of the details.Escott, \\"What Shall We Do with the Negro?\\" (2009), p. 207. These accounts, along with secondary records from the archives of Lincoln and Seward, suggest that Lincoln and Seward would have compromised on the issue of slavery.Nystrom, \\"'What Shall We Do with the Narrative of American Progress?'\\" (2010), p. 70. \\"Escott has been able to make a case for the veracity of Campbell's and Stephens' accounts through a methodological approach that pays close attention to the documentary 'echoes' that resonated from those who had been in attendance at Hampton Roads. The evidence that he presents establishes that important figures within the government in Richmond‚Äîas well as other individuals in North Carolina and Georgia‚Äînot only knew of Lincoln and Seward's offer, but that a willing historian could check Escott's footnotes and find the corroborating sources that speak to the matter. Such documentation includes private letters in North Carolina and a never- before‚Äìcited 1865 recounting of the meeting by the Augusta Chronicle and Sentinel based on an interview with Stephens.\\" Did William Seward suggest that Confederate States could avert ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment by rejoining the Union? Lincoln's personal communications, even from around the time of his To Whom it May Concern letter, indicate that he might have been willing to privately give ground on slavery.Donald, Lincoln (1995), p. 559. \\"Stephens' record would be highly suspect were it not confirmed by other, more contemporary evidence that Lincoln did not now insist upon the end of slavery as a precondition for peace. He told Representative Singleton that his 'To Whom it May Concern' letter to the Confederate commissioners at Niagara Falls had 'put him in a false position‚Äîthat he did not mean to make the abolition of slavery a condition' of peace and that 'he would be willing to grant peace with an amnesty, and restoration of the union, leaving slavery to abide the decisions of judicial tribunals.' On the day before Christmas, Lincoln repeated these views to Browning, who was advising Singleton; he declared 'that he had never entertained the purpose of making the abolition of slavery a condition precedent to the termination of the war, and the restoration of the Union.'\\" That Lincoln proposed a delayed ratification plan is mentioned by the Augusta Chronicle and Sentinel in June 1865‚Äîbased on a report by Stephens from after the meeting.Escott, \\"What Shall We Do with the Negro?\\" (2009), p. 207‚Äì208. From a legal standpoint, Lincoln never believed that the federal government had the authority to ban slavery in the states‚Äîthus his constant emphasis on the status of the Emancipation Proclamation as a measure effective only during wartime.Escott, \\"What Shall We Do with the Negro?\\" (2009), p. 219. \\"Unlike some legal experts and many in his party, Lincoln held to a belief that the U.S. Constitution forbade interference by the federal government with slavery in the states. As a result, this man who decreed emancipation solely on his authority as a commander in chief was also far more of a state-rights president than many tend to remember.\\" According to Paul Escott, Lincoln's moral opposition to slavery did not override his understanding of the Constitution; therefore, Lincoln may have believed that the rebel states would have a right to reject the Thirteenth Amendment if they rejoined the Union.Escott, \\"What Shall We Do with the Negro?\\" (2009), pp. 219‚Äì220. \\"And, again, as a result of his ideas about the Constitution, he wanted the rebel states to be restored their rights swiftly, if not immediately, and to be able to vote on the Thirteenth Amendment. Lincoln could hold all of these views even though he was antislavery and believed that for one human being to enslave another was morally wrong.\\" Seward's biographers generally agree that the Secretary of State may have suggested an outright rejection of the Amendment.Escott, \\"What Shall We Do with the Negro?\\" (2009), p. 211. \\"Could Seward have made such a statement? Biographers of Seward have accepted that he did and have not questioned accounts of Campbell and Stephens. For example, in an early study, Frederic Bancroft concluded that Seward 'at least suggested' that the rebellious states could 'defeat the adoption of the amendment' by a speedy return to the Union.\\" The Confederate delegates spread word of this suggestion privately, contradicting Jefferson Davis's public statements that the surrender terms had been unconscionable.Escott, \\"What Shall We Do with the Negro?\\" (2009), pp. 211‚Äì212. \\"When Stephens, Campbell, and Hunter returned to Richmond, Jefferson Davis controlled the presentation of their report‚Äîas Stephens feared he would‚Äîin order to convince his public that the South had to fight on. The commissioners refused to state that only insulting terms had been offered, but Davis then prefaced a very brief summary by them with his own interpretation that 'unconditional submission' had been demanded. This irritated the Confederate emissaries.\\" Some historians dispute Stephens's interpretation of the Conference. Michael Vorenberg writes that Lincoln would have known that a constitutional amendment cannot be \\"prospectively\\" ratified, and therefore \\"the story is suspicious at best.\\"Vorenberg, \\"The Deformed Child\\" (2001), p. 256. Vorenberg suggests that although Lincoln might have expressed his preference for \\"gradual emancipation\\", he would not have sought to portray this option as legally or politically possible.Vorenberg, \\"The Deformed Child\\" (2001), p. 257. William C. Harris also doubts the 'prospective ratification' story, on the grounds that this offer is not mentioned by Campbell in his 1865 letter to Curtis. James McPherson suggests: \\"It is probable that Stephens was reading his own viewpoint into Seward's remarks.\\"McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom (1988), p. 823. According to David Herbert Donald, Lincoln and Seward may have offered olive branches to the Confederates based on their sense that the institution of slavery was doomed and would end regardless. Relenting on the slavery issue might thus have prevented unnecessary warfare.Donald, Lincoln (1995), p. 559‚Äì560. \\"Since Lincoln himself left no record of any of these interviews, it is possible that all the witnesses distorted his message. But it is more likely‚Äîthough this can only be a speculation‚Äîthat Lincoln's remarks stemmed from his realization that slavery was already dead. His principal concern now was that the war might drag on for at least another year. His purpose was to undermine the Jefferson Davis administration by appealing to those 'followers' mentioned in his annual message to Congress.\\" Seward biographer Walter Stahr supports this inevitability theory, confirming that Seward would have accepted delay in ratification in order to end the war.Stahr, Seward (2012), pp. 424‚Äì425. \\"More plausible, in light of Seward's general views on slavery and reconciliation, is that by this time Seward believed slavery was dying a rapid death, and that it did not matter much whether the process ended in one year or ten years. What mattered most to Seward was to end the war and to bring the Southern states back into the Union, and he was prepared to delay ratification of the antislavery amendment in order to hasten the reunification of the nation.\\" Ludwell H. Johnson theorizes that peace negotiations reflected Lincoln's efforts to consolidate political power by creating \\"a new conservative coalition which would include Southerners\\".Johnson, \\"Lincoln's Solution to the Problem of Peace Terms\\" (1968), p. 584‚Äì585. Johnson argues that negotiations would have built support among Northern Democrats as well as nascent Southern governments.Johnson, \\"Lincoln's Solution to the Problem of Peace Terms\\" (1968), p. 585. Aftermath Congress debated a resolution asking Lincoln to provide a report on the Conference. Willard Salisbury introduced an amendment stipulating that Lincoln reveal the precise terms he had offered. Salisbury's amendment failed and the resolution passed. Lincoln released a set of documents which met with an exceptionally positive reaction from Congress. Response from Davis Davis portrayed the conference in harsh terms, saying that Lincoln had demanded unconditional surrender and that the Confederacy must continue to fight. Some historians argue that Davis entered the Conference in bad faith in order to generate publicity around Northern hostility.E.g.: McPherson, \\"No Peace without Victory\\" (2004), p. 15. \\"Davis expected their efforts to fail because he knew Lincoln would stick to his terms of Union and freedom. This was the outcome Davis wanted, for it would enable him to rally flagging Southern spirits to keep up the fight as the only alternative to degrading submission. This peace effort almost foundered before it was launched.\\" Charles Sanders contends that Davis did not retain enough control over the negotiations to ensure they would serve his purpose, writing: \\"If Davis's motive, therefore, was to discredit the 'croakers,' he was running the enormous political risk that the negotiations might actually succeed.\\"Sanders, \\"Jefferson Davis and the Hampton Roads Peace Conference\\" (1997), p. 812. Sanders also argues that if Davis had intended to sabotage the Conference, he would not have considered such prominent representatives as Lee or Stephens.Sanders, \\"Jefferson Davis and the Hampton Roads Peace Conference\\" (1997), pp. 814, 817. \\"Indeed, a strong case can be made that Stephens was exactly the wrong man to send if Jefferson Davis truly intended to scuttle the conference. Had that been his object, he would have been much better served by sending someone less prominent, less skilled, and less dedicated to peace than Alexander H. Stephens. Stephens left Richmond and went home to Georgia on February 9.Sanders, \\"Jefferson Davis and the Hampton Roads Peace Conference\\" (1997), p. 821. Lincoln amnesty resolution Abraham Lincoln pleased Congress with his report on the Conference, but couldn't gain its support for $400,000,000 compensating the South for emancipation. Lincoln followed through on his promise to pursue compensation, requesting amnesty and $400,000,000 for the Southern states if they ended armed resistance and ratified the Thirteenth Amendment.Johnson, \\"Lincoln's Solution to the Problem of Peace Terms\\" (1968), pp. 582‚Äì583.Donald, Lincoln (1995), p. 560 Soon after returning to Washington, Lincoln wrote an amnesty resolution offering pardons and the return of confiscated property \\"except slaves\\".Escott, \\"What Shall We Do with the Negro?\\" (2009), p. 214‚Äì215. The resolution stipulated that the Confederacy would receive $200,000,000 if it ceased \\"resistance to national authority\\" before April 1, 1865, and $200,000,000 more for successful ratification of the Thirteenth amendment before July 1, 1865. These terms were unpopular, particularly with Lincoln's (relatively Radical) cabinet, and no such resolution was adopted.Nystrom, \\"'What Shall We Do with the Narrative of American Progress?'\\" (2010), p. 70. \\"Moreover, that as part of the re-United States of America, white Southerners might dictate not only the nature of emancipation‚Äîpotentially enacting a gradual freedom that might extend servitude until the turn of the twentieth century‚Äîbut also receive significant compensation from the federal government in return for manumitted property. Lincoln ultimately returned to Washington to face the universal disapproval of his Cabinet, which soundly rejected the lenient terms that the president allegedly favored.\\"Escott, \\"What Shall We Do with the Negro?\\" (2009), pp. 215‚Äì216. The New York Herald reported that Seward had been seeking a peace agreement in order to bolster a new coalition of conservative Republicans and Democrats; \\"that Secretary Seward seized upon the movement to secure whatever √©clat there might be connected with it, in hopes that if peace was the result he would be able to ride upon the wave of joy of a grateful people, and thus become the standard bearer of the great conservative party in 1868.\\"Cox & Cox, Politics, Principle, and Prejudice (1963), pp. 4., p. 38‚Äì42. Cox & Cox note that this theory would be difficult to prove decisively because Seward explicitly avoided the topic in his letters. Nevertheless, they conclude (from Seward's post-election speech on November 11, 1864): \\"A careful reading confirms the hints and speculations found in other sources: the Secretary was looking forward to a grand alliance that would dominate the future political scene.\\" (Johnson's \\"Presidential Reconstruction\\" would achieve some of these goals by other means.)See, e.g., Cox & Cox, Politics, Principle, and Prejudice (1963), pp. 137 ‚Äì 139. Lincoln‚ÄìCampbell meetings Campbell continued to push a peace settlement within the CSA, writing to John C. Breckinridge on March 5 that \\"The South may succomb [sic.] but it is not necessary that she should be destroyed.\\"Mann, The Political and Constitutional Thought of John Archibald Campbell (1966), p. 213. Campbell was the only member of the Confederate government to stay in Richmond after it fell to the Union.Mann, The Political and Constitutional Thought of John Archibald Campbell (1966), p. 206. He met twice with Lincoln to discuss the future of the South. On April 5, Lincoln delivered the following message in writing:Mann, The Political and Constitutional Thought of John Archibald Campbell (1966), p. 215; transcription from Campbell's \\"Recollections on the Evacuation of Richmond \\", Supreme Court Historical Society, 2008. According to Campbell, Lincoln said he would be willing to pardon most Confederates other than \\"Jeff Davis\\".Mann, The Political and Constitutional Thought of John Archibald Campbell (1966), p. 216. Campbell pushed the peace terms advanced by Lincoln, but his letter to the CSA published on April 11 was undercut by Lee's Appomattox surrender on April 9.Mann, The Political and Constitutional Thought of John Archibald Campbell (1966), p. 215‚Äì216. Campbell was subsequently arrested under suspicion of conspiring to assassinate Lincoln, when his initials were discovered on an incriminating document.Mann, The Political and Constitutional Thought of John Archibald Campbell (1966), p. 17. \\"After the fall of Richmond, he met twice more with Lincoln with the same end in view. Following the surrender of Lee at Appomattox, Campbell was arrested in Richmond by the Union army. As Assistant Secretary of War, Campbell had initialed a letter sent to president Jefferson Davis suggesting the possibility of assassinating Lincoln and his Cabinet. The unknown author and his letter were ignored by Confederate officials but the correspondence fell into Union hands when the capital was captured.\\" In culture The film Lincoln (2012) includes a brief dramatization of the conference, focusing on the slavery aspect and the desire of the Confederates to block adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment if re- admitted to the Union. Neither Lincoln nor Seward suggests any compromise on slavery, and Lincoln describes slavery as \\"done\\" and the Thirteenth Amendment as certain to be ratified. The conference also makes an appearance in Jeff Shaara's novel The Last Full Measure.
