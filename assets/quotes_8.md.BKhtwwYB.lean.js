Iceland received a constitution and limited home rule in 1874. A minister for Icelandic affairs was appointed to the Danish cabinet in 1904. Full independence was granted in 1918 through the Danish-Icelandic Act of Union. This was followed by the severance of all ties to Denmark with the declaration of the republic in 1944. Background Through the signing of the Old Covenant in 1262, following the civil strife of the Age of the Sturlungs, Icelanders had relinquished sovereignty to Haakon IV, King of Norway. Iceland remained under Norwegian kingship until 1380, when the death of Olav IV of Norway extinguished the Norwegian male royal line. Norway (and thus Iceland) then became part of the Kalmar Union with Sweden and Denmark, in which Denmark was the dominant power. While attempts have been made to find evidence of pre-19th century nationalist sentiments, not much comprehensive evidence has been found of nationalism as we understand it today. Portrait of J√≥nas Hallgr√≠msson, contributor to Fj√∂lnir. Nationalist movement Around the middle of the 19th century a new national consciousness was revived in Iceland, led by Danish-educated Icelandic intellectuals who had been inspired by romantic and nationalist ideas from continental Europe. The most notable of these were the so-called Fj√∂lnismenn‚Äîpoets and writers for the journal Fj√∂lnir‚Äî Brynj√≥lfur P√©tursson, J√≥nas Hallgr√≠msson, Konr√°√∞ G√≠slason and T√≥mas S√¶mundsson. According to historian Gu√∞mundur H√°lfdanarson, the first calls for autonomy in Iceland were in the early 1830s. The demand for autonomy become dominant in Icelandic domestic discourse by the middle of the 19th century. Meanwhile, an independence movement developed under J√≥n Sigur√∞sson. In 1843, a royal decree re-established a national parliament, the Althing, as a consultative assembly. It claimed continuity with the Althing of the Icelandic Commonwealth, which had remained for centuries as a judicial body and had been abolished in 1800. The advocates of Icelandic independence pursued their aims peacefully, soliciting Danish officials via legal means. The struggle for independence reached its height in 1851 when the Danes tried to pass new legislation which ignored the comments and requests made by the Icelanders. The Icelandic delegates, under the leadership of J√≥n Sigur√∞sson, passed their own proposal, much to the displeasure of the King's agent, who dissolved the meeting. This caused Sigur√∞sson to rise up with his fellow delegates and utter the phrase V√©r m√≥tm√¶lum allir (\\"We all protest\\"). Historian Gu√∞mundur H√°lfdanarson theorizes that Icelandic farmers allied with Icelandic liberal academics, such as J√≥n Sigur√∞sson, in the cause for national freedom because they wanted to decrease the influence of Danish liberalism on their own privileged position in Icelandic society. Icelandic farmers worried that various social restrictions in Icelandic society (for instance, on free labour and free migration) would be abolished. Historian Gunnar Karlsson expresses some support for this theory but notes that \\"there is hardly sufficient evidence to conclude that social conservatism was the major force behind the nationalism of Icelandic farmers\\". The failure of liberal nationalist parties (the Icelandic National Front and the Icelandic National Front), which stood for liberal, democratic and social-radical (not socialist) positions, similar to those of leftist parties in Norway and Denmark to take root and lead the Icelandic independence movement can be seen as evidence of this theory. The historian Gu√∞mundur H√°lfdanarson ties Icelandic nationalism to the state of Danish politics in the first half of the 19th century. H√°lfdanarson writes, \\"the Danish composite or conglomerate monarchy ‚Äì den danske helstat ‚Äì lost its legitimacy not only among Icelandic intellectuals in the first half of the 19th century, but also among their Danish colleagues. Both groups considered the nation-state, unified on the basis of common culture and language, as the state form of the future while complex monarchies, mixing people of various cultural backgrounds under one government, were linked to absolutism and the reactionary politics of the past.\\" However, many Danes were skeptical of Icelandic independence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, characterizing the nation as too small to govern itself, too dependent on financial aid from Denmark, and worried that a successful Icelandic independence would give credence to German nationalist claims in Schleswig- Holstein. The Icelandic independence movement was peaceful from its start in the post-Napoleonic period to the accomplishment of independence in 1944. Common explanations for the peaceful nature of Iceland's independence struggle include: * Iceland's distance to Copenhagen. * Iceland's homogenous population. * The accommodating responses of Denmark to Icelandic demands. * The unwillingness of Denmark to respond violently, in part due to a respect for Icelandic culture but also an unwillingness to shoulder the costs of quelling the Icelandic independence movement. * The peaceful trends in the Nordic region after the Napoleonic Wars. Home rule and independence In 1874, a thousand years after the first acknowledged settlement, Denmark granted Iceland home rule. By the end of the 19th century, the various efforts made on behalf of Iceland had their desired result. The constitution, written in 1874, was revised in 1903, and a minister for Icelandic affairs, residing in Reykjav√≠k, was made responsible to the Althing. Hannes Hafstein served as the first Minister of Iceland from 31 January 1904 until 31 March 1909. The Act of Union, signed on 1 December 1918 by Icelandic and Danish authorities, recognized Iceland as a fully sovereign state (the Kingdom of Iceland), joined with Denmark in a personal union with the Danish king. Iceland established its own flag and asked Denmark to represent its foreign affairs and defense interests. The Act would be up for revision in 1940 and could be revoked three years later if agreement was not reached. The Act was approved by 92.6% of Icelandic voters (turnout at 43.8%) in a referendum on 19 October 1918. Historian Gu√∞mundur H√°lfdanarson interprets this low turnout as a sign that Icelandic voters did not consider the referendum of importance. Consistent with the transfer of sovereignty in 1918, the Supreme Court of Iceland was established in 1920, which meant that Icelanders were in charge of all three branches of the Icelandic government. Union through the Danish king was finally abolished altogether in 1944 during the occupation of Denmark by Nazi Germany, when the Al√æing declared the founding of the Republic of Iceland. A referendum on 20‚Äì23 May 1944 to abolish the Union with Denmark was approved by 99.5% of voters in a 98.4% turnout.

The most common method for air separation is fractional distillation. Cryogenic air separation units (ASUs) are built to provide nitrogen or oxygen and often co-produce argon. Other methods such as membrane, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) are commercially used to separate a single component from ordinary air. High purity oxygen, nitrogen, and argon, used for semiconductor device fabrication, require cryogenic distillation. Similarly, the only viable source of the rare gases neon, krypton, and xenon is the distillation of air using at least two distillation columns.  Cryogenic distillation process Distillation column in a cryogenic air separation plant Pure gases can be separated from air by first cooling it until it liquefies, then selectively distilling the components at their various boiling temperatures. The process can produce high purity gases but is energy-intensive. This process was pioneered by Carl von Linde in the early 20th century and is still used today to produce high purity gases. He developed it in the year 1895; the process remained purely academic for seven years before it was used in industrial applications for the first time (1902). The cryogenic separation process requires a very tight integration of heat exchangers and separation columns to obtain a good efficiency and all the energy for refrigeration is provided by the compression of the air at the inlet of the unit. To achieve the low distillation temperatures, an air separation unit requires a refrigeration cycle that operates by means of the Joule‚ÄìThomson effect, and the cold equipment has to be kept within an insulated enclosure (commonly called a \\"cold box\\"). The cooling of the gases requires a large amount of energy to make this refrigeration cycle work and is delivered by an air compressor. Modern ASUs use expansion turbines for cooling; the output of the expander helps drive the air compressor, for improved efficiency. The process consists of the following main steps: # Before compression the air is pre-filtered of dust. # Air is compressed where the final delivery pressure is determined by recoveries and the fluid state (gas or liquid) of the products. Typical pressures range between 5 and 10 bar gauge. The air stream may also be compressed to different pressures to enhance the efficiency of the ASU. During compression water is condensed out in inter-stage coolers. # The process air is generally passed through a molecular sieve bed, which removes any remaining water vapour, as well as carbon dioxide, which would freeze and plug the cryogenic equipment. Molecular sieves are often designed to remove any gaseous hydrocarbons from the air, since these can be a problem in the subsequent air distillation that could lead to explosions.Particulate matter from forest fires caused an explosion in the air separation unit of a Gas to Liquid plant, see The molecular sieves bed must be regenerated. This is done by installing multiple units operating in alternating mode and using the dry co-produced waste gas to desorb the water. # Process air is passed through an integrated heat exchanger (usually a plate fin heat exchanger) and cooled against product (and waste) cryogenic streams. Part of the air liquefies to form a liquid that is enriched in oxygen. The remaining gas is richer in nitrogen and is distilled to almost pure nitrogen (typically < 1ppm) in a high pressure (HP) distillation column. The condenser of this column requires refrigeration which is obtained from expanding the more oxygen rich stream further across a valve or through an Expander, (a reverse compressor). # Alternatively the condenser may be cooled by interchanging heat with a reboiler in a low pressure (LP) distillation column (operating at 1.2-1.3 bar abs.) when the ASU is producing pure oxygen. To minimize the compression cost the combined condenser/reboiler of the HP/LP columns must operate with a temperature difference of only 1-2 K, requiring plate fin brazed aluminium heat exchangers. Typical oxygen purities range in from 97.5% to 99.5% and influences the maximum recovery of oxygen. The refrigeration required for producing liquid products is obtained using the Joule‚ÄìThomson effect in an expander which feeds compressed air directly to the low pressure column. Hence, a certain part of the air is not to be separated and must leave the low pressure column as a waste stream from its upper section. # Because the boiling point of argon (87.3 K at standard conditions) lies between that of oxygen (90.2 K) and nitrogen (77.4 K), argon builds up in the lower section of the low pressure column. When argon is produced, a vapor side draw is taken from the low pressure column where the argon concentration is highest. It is sent to another column rectifying the argon to the desired purity from which liquid is returned to the same location in the LP column. Use of modern structured packings which have very low pressure drops enable argon with less than 1 ppm impurities. Though argon is present in less to 1% of the incoming, the air argon column requires a significant amount of energy due to the high reflux ratio required (about 30) in the argon column. Cooling of the argon column can be supplied from cold expanded rich liquid or by liquid nitrogen. # Finally the products produced in gas form are warmed against the incoming air to ambient temperatures. This requires a carefully crafted heat integration that must allow for robustness against disturbances (due to switch over of the molecular sieve beds). It may also require additional external refrigeration during start-up. The separated products are sometimes supplied by pipeline to large industrial users near the production plant. Long distance transportation of products is by shipping liquid product for large quantities or as dewar flasks or gas cylinders for small quantities. Non-cryogenic processes  A nitrogen generator Bottle of 4√Ö molecular sieves Pressure swing adsorption provides separation of oxygen or nitrogen from air without liquefaction. The process operates around ambient temperature; a zeolite (molecular sponge) is exposed to high pressure air, then the air is released and an adsorbed film of the desired gas is released. The size of compressor is much reduced over a liquefaction plant, and portable oxygen concentrators are made in this manner to provide oxygen-enriched air for medical purposes. Vacuum swing adsorption is a similar process; the product gas is evolved from the zeolite at sub-atmospheric pressure. Membrane nitrogen generator Membrane technologies can provide alternate, lower-energy approaches to air separation. For example, a number of approaches are being explored for oxygen generation. Polymeric membranes operating at ambient or warm temperatures, for example, may be able to produce oxygen-enriched air (25-50% oxygen). Ceramic membranes can provide high-purity oxygen (90% or more) but require higher temperatures (800-900 deg C) to operate. These ceramic membranes include Ion Transport Membranes (ITM) and Oxygen Transport Membranes (OTM). Air Products and Chemicals Inc and Praxair are developing flat ITM and tubular OTM systems, . Membrane gas separation is used to provide oxygen-poor and nitrogen-rich gases instead of air to fill the fuel tanks of jet liners, thus greatly reducing the chances of accidental fires and explosions. Conversely, membrane gas separation is currently used to provide oxygen-enriched air to pilots flying at great altitudes in aircraft without pressurized cabins. Oxygen-enriched air can be obtained exploiting the different solubility of oxygen and nitrogen. Oxygen is more soluble than nitrogen in water, so if air is degassed from water, a stream of 35% oxygen can be obtained. Applications = Steel = In steelmaking oxygen is required for the basic oxygen steelmaking. Today, modern basic oxygen steelmaking uses almost two tons of oxygen per ton of steel. = Ammonia = Nitrogen used in the Haber process to make ammonia. = Coal gas = Large amounts of oxygen are required for coal gasification projects; cryogenic plants producing 3000 tons/day are found in some projects. = Inert gas = Inerting with nitrogen storage tanks of ships and tanks for petroleum products, or for protecting edible oil products from oxidation.

It bears the subtitle \\"A Yearly Journal for Icelanders\\" Fj√∂lnir () was an Icelandic-language journal published annually in Copenhagen from 1835 to 1847. The journal was founded by the Fj√∂lnismenn (literally, \\"men of Fj√∂lnir\\"), four young Icelandic intellectuals who sought to revive national consciousness in Iceland in the hopes of raising support for Icelandic independence. They were J√≥nas Hallgr√≠msson, Konr√°√∞ G√≠slason, Brynj√≥lfur P√©tursson and T√≥mas S√¶mundsson. All four were Icelanders who had studied at Bessasta√∞ir and the University of Copenhagen. They all contributed to the publication of the journal until 1838. The fifth annual copy was published and paid for by T√≥mas S√¶mundsson, who had moved back to Iceland, and had it printed in Vi√∞ey. Publication then ceased for a few years, as J√≥nas Hallgr√≠msson was occupied with his scientific research. A new issue was published in 1843, but at this point two societies, Fj√∂lnisf√©lagi√∞ and Nokkrir √çslendingar, had taken over publication, led first by G√≠sli Magn√∫sson and later by Halld√≥r Kr. Fri√∞riksson. The last issue of the journal was published in 1847. It was dedicated to the memory of J√≥nas Hallgr√≠msson, who had died in the spring of 1845. There is no evidence of the distribution numbers of the first few volumes but in the years 1843-1845, 300-400 copies of volumes 6-8 were sold in Iceland and Denmark. The volumes were most likely read aloud in large gatherings and loaned from farm to farm. Fj√∂lnir introduced romanticism in Icelandic literature and poetry, and many of J√≥nas Hallgr√≠msson's romantic poems were first published in the journal. It also spearheaded the revival of national and linguistic consciousness in Iceland. Fj√∂lnir received a mixed reception among the Icelandic reading public, partly due to eccentric spelling conventions, and the perceived arrogance of the young Fj√∂lnismenn. Nevertheless, it made important contributions to the revival of Icelandic as a written language, and greatly influenced the cultural and political milieu in Iceland. Historian Gunnar Karlsson finds that it is difficult to determine the political influence of the volumes but that there can be little doubt that the volumes made a clear contribution to Icelandic poetry.

Old Slovenes () is the term used for a national conservative political group in the Slovene Lands from the 1850s to the 1870s, which was opposed to the radical national liberal Young Slovenes. The main Old Slovene leaders were Janez Bleiweis, Lovro Toman, Luka Svetec, Etbin Henrik Costa, and Andrej Einspieler.  Origin  In the 1860s, the Slovene National Movement, which had a wide political platform, based on national emancipation of Slovenes in the Austrian Empire, and the recognition of the linguistic rights of the Slovene language, split into different factions. The differences were both ideological and tactical. After the beginning of the constitutional period in the Austrian Empire, the Slovene nationalists gathered around the moderate conservative and liberal Catholic editor of the newspaper Kmetijske in rokodelske novice, Janez Bleiweis. Bleiweis and his allies led a policy of tactical alliances with different power groups in the Austrian Empire, like the Roman Catholic Church, Franti≈°ek Palack√Ω's Czech federalists, and a small part of the Carniolan regionalist landed nobility. From the mid-1860s onwards, a group of young nationalist activists and intellectuals, gathered around Fran Levstik and Josip Stritar, challenged this pragmatic policy, demanding a more radical approach which would fully embrace liberal ideas. After a decade of friction between the two factions, the break came in 1872, when the Young Slovenes established their own political organization. Consequently, the group remaining loyal to the old leadership and the traditional policies, became known as Old Slovenes. Contrary to the Young Slovenes, who were critical towards the Catholic hierarchy, the Old Slovenes promoted traditional values, such as family, religion, and loyalty to the Habsburg dynasty, on an Austroslavist background. Their motto was \\"All [things] for Faith, Home, and Emperor!\\" (Vse za vero, dom, cesarja!).  Demise  By 1876, the two factions forged a tactical alliance against Austrian centralism and German nationalism, and both supported the Taaffe government. This tactical alliance between conservatives and liberals, which also included a substantial group of radicals, was known as \\"The Concord\\" (). In the mid-1880s, the Concord came under sharp criticism of the new generation of Catholic activists, led by the theologian Anton Mahniƒç, and sponsored by part of the Roman Catholic establishment (especially the Cardinal Jakob Missia). The Old Slovenes opposed this new trend of political Catholicism, which was able to mobilize the peasant masses, and continued to support a more traditional understanding of politics. With the death of most of the Old Slovene leaders in the 1880s, the Slovene conservative political movement was replaced by a new type of political conservatism, based initially on traditionalist political Catholicism and later on Christian Social and Christian Socialist ideas. The establishment of the Catholic National Party in 1892 marked the end of the policy of \\"Concord\\", based on an alliance between Old Slovenes and Young Slovenes.

In 1991 he staged Erua Mochi, a rock spectacle presenting a new musical style: \\"Live Acid\\".

(MW & Co.) was a leading independent investment banking firm, specialising in major corporate finance transactions in the Nordic countries. The major focus of the firm was owner driven transactions, restructurings, mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. Overview The firm was established by six former employees of Enskilda Secusrities: Spencer Maizels, Sten Westerberg, Mark Florman, Peter Wikstr√∂m, Tomas S√∂derstr√∂m & Jonas de Verdier. Sten Westerberg had been under-secretary of state at the Ministry of Finance (Sweden) and had strong government connections. Spencer Maizels was the company's first CEO, but died aged just 43 in 1995. He was succeeded by Mark Florman, who had been one of the driving forces behind the establishment of the firm. History Maizels, Westerberg & Co. was often described as a \\"corporate finance boutique\\". The term belies the position the firm had as a leading player in the Nordic mergers and acquisitions market. The Volvo/Procordia deal, which was the largest demerger in the history of Sweden, got the firm off to a running start. The emergency restructuring resulting in the sale of four subsidiaries belonging to the Swedish co- operative KF (Kooperativa F√∂rbundet) soon followed as did a string of high- profile deals. At the end of 1999, Maizels, Westerberg & Co. was bought by the Finnish-Swedish bank Merita Nordbanken (now Nordea). The resulting investment bank was named Maizels Merita Nordbanken and grew from 30 to 70 employees. The joint chief executives were Mark Florman and executive vice-president of Merita Nordbanken, Bj√∂rn Carlsson. Nordbanken's M&A; advisory team was demerged from the bank's Stockholm office and moved into Maizel's new office.  Associated Companies  *Hambro, Maizels, Westerberg & Co. Ltd.

It is one of Telemann's collections of music for unaccompanied instruments, the others being twelve fantasias for solo flute and thirty-six for solo harpsichord that were published in Hamburg in 1732‚Äì33, as well as a set of twelve fantasias for solo viola da gamba that was published in the same city in 1735, but were considered lost until a copy of the print was found in a private collection in 2015 by viola da gamba player and musicologist Thomas Fritzsch.Anon. 2015. This collection consists of the following works: # Fantasia in B-flat major (Largo‚ÄîAllegro‚ÄîGrave‚ÄîSi replica l'allegro) # Fantasia in G major (Largo‚ÄîAllegro‚ÄîAllegro) # Fantasia in F minor (Adagio‚ÄîPresto‚ÄîGrave‚ÄîVivace) # Fantasia in D major (Vivace‚ÄîGrave‚ÄîAllegro) # Fantasia in A major (Allegro‚ÄîPresto‚ÄîAllegro‚ÄîAndante‚ÄîAllegro) # Fantasia in E minor (Grave‚ÄîPresto‚ÄîSiciliana‚ÄîAllegro) # Fantasia in E-flat major (Dolce‚ÄîAllegro‚ÄîLargo‚ÄîPresto) # Fantasia in E major (Piacevolumente‚ÄîSpirituoso‚ÄîAllegro) # Fantasia in B minor (Siciliana‚ÄîVivace‚ÄîAllegro) # Fantasia in D major (Presto‚ÄîLargo‚ÄîAllegro) # Fantasia in F major (Un poco vivace‚ÄîSoave‚ÄîDa capo un poco vivace‚ÄîAllegro) # Fantasia in A minor (Moderato‚ÄîVivace‚ÄîPresto) This scheme does not resemble that of the twelve flute fantasies, which progress in a roughly stepwise direction from A major to G minor. However, some overall structure seems to be implied: the first movement of Fantasia 7 subtly references the opening of the first fantasia in the collection, indicating that Telemann possibly conceived this work as two groups of 6 fantasias. He has, indeed, described the collection as \\"12 fantasias ... of which 6 include fugues and 6 are Galanterien\\", with \\"fugues\\" referencing the contrapuntal style of certain fantasias. Telemann's violin fantasias exhibit mastery of not only compound melodic lines, but also of idiomatic writing for violin,Zohn, Grove. as Telemann himself was a self-taught violinist. Much of the music reveals the influence of Italian sonatas and concertos, but the typical tendency of German solo violin music to rely on polyphony is still present: fantasias 2, 3, 5, 6, and 10 all include fugues and employ much double-stopping.

Papplewick Hall, Nottinghamshire Life His father Charles Montagu (of Papplewick) was auditor-general of the Duchy of Cornwall, while Frederick was Prince of Wales; was MP for Westminster in 1722, for St. Germans in 1734, for Camelford in 1741, and for Northampton in 1754, and died on 29 May 1759. Frederick's mother, Ann Colladon Montagu, well known in society after her husband's death, was an intimate friend of Mary, dowager-countess of Gower (the widow of John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower), and of Mary Delany, in whose published 'Correspondence' she frequently figures as 'my Mrs Montague', in order to distinguish her from the better known Elizabeth Montagu. Her London residence was in Hanover Square. She died 31 May 1780. Frederick, was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge 8 February 1750. He seems to have won Paris's college declamation prize, and his oration was published at the request of the master and fellows as 'Oratio in laudes Baconi,' Cambridge, 1755, 4to. He graduated Master of Arts (MA) per lit. reg. in 1757. At Cambridge, Montagu made the acquaintance of the poets Thomas Gray and William Mason, which he sedulously cultivated afterwards. To his influence, Mason owed his appointment to a canonry at York in 1762. Admitted a barrister of Lincoln's Inn in 1757, Montagu became a bencher in 1782. He succeeded his father to the Papplewick estate in 1759 and to his seat as MP for Northampton from 1759 to 1767. He also represented Higham Ferrers as MP from 1768 to 1790. In 1763, his cousin, George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax, pressed George Grenville to obtain a post for him in the board of trade, and he was subsequently 'a devoted adherent to the Cavendish and Rockingham interest'. In 1772, he moved in vain to abolish the fast of 30 January, the date of Charles I's execution ; the fast was not abolished till 1859. In 1780, he was generally expected to succeed Fletcher Norton, 1st Baron Grantley as speaker of the House of Commons. He became a Lord of the Treasury in 1782 under Charles Watson- Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham, and again in 1783 in William Cavendish- Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland's coalition ministry. In 1787, he was a member of the committee that prepared the articles of Warren Hastings's impeachment. He was popular in society, and had literary tastes. Wraxall describes him as 'a man of distinguished probity'. On retiring from the House of Commons in 1790, he was made a privy councillor, and lived mainly at his house at Papplewick Hall, which he had rebuilt in 1787. He expressed approval of Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France.Roland Thorne, ‚ÄòMontagu, Frederick (1733‚Äì1800)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008, accessed 4 June 2009.

St Mary's Catholic Church in Drom was built in 1829 for Fr Thomas Mullaney, whose name is inscribed over the front door. The limestone used to build the church was quarried locally at a site about half a mile east of the church. Timber was drawn from Limerick and much of the work was carried out by voluntary labour. A pentagonal belfry was erected at the rear of the church in 1859. The churchyard contains a sundial which was carved by Dan Ryan of Kilvilcorris.O'Dwyer, C.

An extant copy of the publication, conserved in Brussels, has a spurious title page reading Fantasie per il Violino senza Basso (Fantasias for Solo Violin). The set is one of Telemann's collections of fantasias for unaccompanied instruments, the others being a set of , also published in 1732‚Äì33, and two sets published in 1735: twelve for solo violin and twelve for viola da gamba. Telemann's solo flute fantasias are alone in the Baroque repertoire to include movements seemingly impossible on flute: fugues (fantasias 2, 6, and 8‚Äì11), a French overture (fantasia 7) and a passacaglia (fantasia 5). In 2012, an arrangement for viola solo was published by Euprint.Georg Philipp Telemann (composer), Luc Dejans (arranger). Fantasias for Viola solo TWV 40:02-13 (orig. for Flute)-album Euprint, 2012. In this arrangement, through the use of double stops, some many-voiced parts appear as real polyphonic pieces. Structure This work comprises the following: #Fantasia in A major (Vivace ‚Äì Allegro) #Fantasia in A minor (Grave ‚Äì Vivace ‚Äì Adagio ‚Äì Allegro) #Fantasia in B minor (Largo ‚Äì Vivace ‚Äì Largo ‚Äì Vivace ‚Äì Allegro) #Fantasia in B-flat major (Andante ‚Äì Allegro ‚Äì Presto) #Fantasia in C major (Presto ‚Äì Largo ‚Äì Presto ‚Äì Dolce ‚Äì Allegro ‚Äì Allegro) #Fantasia in D minor (Dolce ‚Äì Allegro ‚Äì Spirituoso) #Fantasia in D major (Alla francese ‚Äì Presto) #Fantasia in E minor (Largo ‚Äì Spirituoso ‚Äì Allegro) #Fantasia in E major (Affettuoso ‚Äì Allegro ‚Äì Grave ‚Äì Vivace) #Fantasia in F-sharp minor (A Tempo giusto ‚Äì Presto ‚Äì Moderato) #Fantasia in G major (Allegro ‚Äì Adagio ‚Äì Vivace ‚Äì Allegro) #Fantasia in G minor (Grave ‚Äì Allegro ‚Äì Grave ‚Äì Allegro ‚Äì Dolce ‚Äì Allegro ‚Äì Presto) The collection is arranged by key, progressing more or less stepwise from A major to G minor. Telemann deliberately avoided keys that are impractical on the one-key flute, i.e. B major, C minor, F minor and F-sharp major. There are two ways to view the overall structure of the collection: one way, in which the work is divided into two parts, is suggested by the fact that Fantasia 7 begins with a French overture, indicating a start of a new section. This device was also later used by Johann Sebastian Bach in Variation 16 of his Goldberg Variations. Another was proposed by scholar Wolfgang Hirschmann: there are four modal groups of three fantasias: major-minor-minor, major- major-minor, major-minor-major, and minor-major-minor.

During the trials, it was found that this particular prototype lacked sufficient ballistic protection, so the Salvadoran government sought assistance from the United States. Seeing that El Salvador didn't have manufacturing facilities capable of building the number of vehicles required, the US Army Tank Automotive Command's RDE Center's Design and Manufacturing Technology Directorate proposed a three-step plan to produce the vehicles: 1\\\\. A second, improved prototype would be built in Detroit, and sent to El Salvador to serve as a reference model. 2\\\\. The armor would be cut and welded in the United States, pre-assembled with the windshields and side-rails, and shipped as kits to El Salvador. 3\\\\. Train a cadre of welders from El Salvador at facilities in the United States. 66 kits were provided for final assembly in El Salvador, one for each of the M37s in the Salvadoran Army's inventory.

State - 84% Special education In December 2009, the district administration reported that 375 pupils or 16.1% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. The district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Supervisor of Special Education. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. Bedford Area School District received a $1,277,878 supplement for special education services in 2010. =Gifted education= The district administration reported that 47 or 2.08% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. Students identified as gifted attending the high school have access to a dual enrollment program with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying policy The Bedford Area School District administration reported there were 3 incidents of bullying in the district in 2009. The Bedford Area School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online Bullying-Cyberbullying Policy 249. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Budget In 2009, the district reports employing over 100 teachers with a starting salary of $37,000 for 183 days work. The average teacher salary was $52,925 while the maximum salary is $104,250. In Pennsylvania, the average teacher salary for Pennsylvania's 124,100 public school teachers was $54,977 in 2008. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries. When adjusted for cost of living Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the nation for teacher compensation.Teachers need to know enough is enough, PaDelcoTimes, April 20, 2010. Additionally, Bedford Area School District teachers receive a defined benefit pension, taxpayer fully funded health insurance, retirement health insurance, 3 days bereavement leave, professional development reimbursement, 2 paid personal days, 10‚Äì12 sick days, accumulated sick days death benefit, life insurance and other benefits.

In 2007, the district employed 148 teachers. The average teacher salary in the district was $50,129 for 183 school days worked. Bedford Area School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $784.64 per pupil. The district is ranked 213th out of 500 in Pennsylvania for administrative spending. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. In 2008, Bedford Area School District reported spending $10,040 per pupil. This ranked 474th in the commonwealth. In 2010, the per pupil spending had increased to $11,549.60 Among the states, Pennsylvania's total per pupil revenue (including all sources) ranked 11th at $15,023 per student, in 2008-09. In 2007, the Pennsylvania per pupil total expenditures was $12,759. ; Reserves In 2009, the district reported a $3,625,903 in an unreserved-undesignated fund balance. The designated fund balance was reported as $4,350,782. In 2010, Bedford Area Administration reported an increase to $2,500,936 in the unreserved- undesignated fund balance. The designated fund balance was reported as $4,245,296. Pennsylvania school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In November 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. The findings were reported to the school board and the administration. In February 2011, the school board approved the application for a charter school called Hope for Hyndman Charter School. It is to serve grades K-12. Funding will come for the school district. The charter school was founded by community members, in anticipation of the district closing both the Hyndman Middle-High School and/or Hyndman- Londonderry Elementary School due to low enrollment of 425 pupils K-12 and budget challenges. The district is funded by a combination of: a local income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax regardless of the individual's wealth. =State basic education funding= In 2011-12, the district received a $7,023,656 allocation, of state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the School District received $144,460 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget included $5,354,629,000 for the 2011-2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount is a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 2010-2011. The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011-12. In 2010, the district reported that 897 students received free or reduced-price lunches, due to the family meeting the federal poverty level.Pennsylvania Department of Education, District Allocations Report 2009, 2009-10 For the 2010‚Äì11 school year, Bedford Area School District received a 6.25% increase in state Basic Education Funding resulting in a $7,757,288 payment. This was the highest increase in BEF in Bedford County. Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County received the highest increase in the state at 23.65% increase in funding for the 2010‚Äì11 school year. One hundred fifty school districts received the base 2% increase in 2010‚Äì11. The amount of increase each school district receives is determined by then Governor Edward G. Rendell and Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, through the allocation set in the state budget proposal made in February each year. This was the second year of the Governor's policy to fund some districts at a far higher rate than others. In the 2009‚Äì2010 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 5.01% increase in Basic Education funding for a total of $7,300,796. The state Basic Education funding to the district in 2008‚Äì09 was $6,952,695. The district also received supplemental funding for English language learners, Title 1 federal funding for low-income students, for district size, a poverty supplement from the commonwealth and more. Everett Area School District received 6.17% which was the highest increase in Bedford County for the 2009‚Äì10 school year. Among the 500 school districts in Pennsylvania, Muhlenberg School District in Berks County received the highest with a 22.31% increase in funding. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 853 district students received free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income in the 2007‚Äì2008 school year. Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004‚Äì2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010‚Äì11 the Bedford Area School District applied for and received $392,101 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district used the funding to provide full-day kindergarten for the 7th year. Science It‚Äôs Elementary grant Bedford Elementary School successfully applied to participate and received a Science It's Elementary grant in 2008‚Äì09. For the 2008-09 school year, the program was offered in 143 schools reaching 2,847 teachers and 66,973 students across Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Science: It‚Äôs Elementary Grantees Students in 143 Schools Benefit from Intensive Science Curriculum, July 22, 2008 In 2007, the Pennsylvania Department of Education initiated an effort to improve science instruction in the Commonwealth's public elementary schools. Called Science: It's Elementary, the program is a hands on instruction approach for elementary science classes that develops problem-solving and critical thinking skills.Patricia Vathis Pennsylvania Department of Education, Grants and Subsidies Science: It‚Äôs Elementary, 2006 To encourage schools to adopt the program's standards aligned curriculum, the state provided a grant to cover the costs of materials and extensive mandatory teacher training.Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2010 ‚Äì 2011 Science: It‚Äôs Elementary Application Guidelines, July 2010 The district was required to develop a three-year implementation plan for the participating school. They had to appoint a district liaison who was paid $3,000 by the PDE to serve as the conduit of all information between the district and the Department and its agents along with submitting orders and distributing supplies to implementing teachers. For the 2006‚Äì07 state education budget, $10 million was allocated. The 2006-07 State Education Budget provided $635 million in new spending for pre-K through 12th grades for the 2006‚Äì07 school year. This marked an 8-percent increase over 2005‚Äì06 public school funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Governor Rendell Commends Teachers for Enhancing Science Education in Pennsylvania, August 10, 2006 The grant program was expanded to $14.5 million in the 2008-09 budget. Education Assistance grant The state's EAP funding provides for the continuing support of tutoring services and other programs to address the academic needs of eligible students. Funds are available to eligible school districts and full-time career and technology centers (CTC) in which one or more schools have failed to meet at least one academic performance target, as provided for in Section 1512-C of the Pennsylvania Public School Code. In 2010-11, Bedford Area School District received $76,524. 21st Century Community Learning Center Grant Bedford Area School District was designated as a before and after school program provider for Bedford and Huntingdon Counties in 2010. They received state funding ‚Äì a grant of $604,800. CCLCs provide academic, artistic and cultural enhancement activities to students and their families when school is not in session.Pennsylvania Awards $29.9 Million to Support 21st century Community Learning Centers, Pennsylvania Department of Education Press Release, April 7, 2010 Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006‚Äì2009. Bedford Area School District received $279,086 for funding in 2006‚Äì07. In 2007‚Äì08 the district received $300,000. For the 2008‚Äì09 school year, the district administration did not apply. Of the 501 public school districts in Pennsylvania, 447 of them received Classrooms for the Future grant awards. =Federal Stimulus grant= The district received an extra $2,023,034 in ARRA ‚Äì Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009-10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant Bedford Area School District officials did not apply to participate in the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district over one million additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. =Common Cents state initiative= The Bedford Area School Board did not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= The school board set property tax rates in 2011‚Äì2012 at 10.2692 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75‚Äì85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections (Local Tax Enabling Act), which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. * 2010‚Äì11 - 10.2692 mills. * 2009‚Äì10 ‚Äì 60.0000 mills. * 2008‚Äì09 ‚Äì 60.0000 mills. * 2007‚Äì08 ‚Äì 60.0000 mills. * 2006‚Äì07 ‚Äì 58.0000 mills. * 2005‚Äì06 ‚Äì 58.0000 mills. Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not authorized to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of 0.75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. The following exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The School District Adjusted Index for the Bedford Area School District 2006‚Äì2007 through 2010‚Äì2011. * 2006‚Äì07 ‚Äì 5.2%, Base 3.9% * 2007‚Äì08 ‚Äì 4.5%, Base 3.4% * 2008‚Äì09 ‚Äì 5.8%, Base 4.4% * 2009‚Äì10 ‚Äì 5.5%, Base 4.1% * 2010‚Äì11 ‚Äì 3.9%, Base 2.9% * 2011‚Äì12 ‚Äì 1.9%, Base 1.4% * 2012-13 - 2.3%, Base 1.7% For the 2011‚Äì12 school year, Bedford Area School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, Bedford Area School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011‚Äì12 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. The Bedford Area School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budgets in 2010‚Äì11. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2010, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Bedford Area School District was $150 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 4,346 property owners applied for the tax relief. The tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property on the individual's tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $632 per homestead and farmstead in 2010. This was the second year they were the top recipient. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially more than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).

Name origin  Bosc is an old French word meaning bois (wood), deriving from the Germanic bosk which is related to the Latin boscus. The same word occurs in Norman. It can be found in many place names and surnames. and Th√©roulde from Thorold/Thorald, or in Latin Turoldus, comes from a forename of Scandinavian origin - Thorold (coming in turn from Thorvaldr (meaning 'ruled by Thor'). The name arrived in Normandy with the Vikings, and was very popular there from the 10th to the 12th centuries. It is also the origin of many surnames: Th√©roulde, Th√©roude, Touroude, Troude and Throude. These names are mainly found in the Pays de Caux, the Roumois and the Cotentin, where the Scandinavian settlements were strongest. Several placenames exclusively found in Normandy come from this same origin: probably all the Trouville, Bourgtheroulde, Th√©rouldeville, Turretot, etc. place names are related. The surname is also very common in the Channel Island of Guernsey, spelt variously as above and currently as mine, Torode.  History through Families  **Special thanks to Madame Poubelle and Monsieur Eric Pimont The origin of the Chateau is not really clear...even if Hippolyte Lemarchand in the book Canton de Cleres stated that the Chateau was built in 1616, the foundations are dating from before. = du Bosc de Tendos = Until the 12th Century, the land of Bosc Theroulde consisted of 6 to 8 houses and was part of the land of the baronnerie de Fontaine le Bourg, under the title of fief Alinette, huitieme de fief. Canton de Cleres - Hippolyte Lemarchand = Cormeilles = From 1512 the estate belonged to the Cormeille family and until the 16th century. = Le Fa√´ = In 1598, Jacques Le Fa√´ (d. ca. 1630), Adviser to the King, 'Controleur general des traites dominilales et impots en la province de Normandie', acquires the Alinette domaine from the Cormeilles Family on the 6th of April. He builds the present Ch√¢teau Louis de XIII style in bricks, works will only start in 1616 (exchange of contract only on 14 May 1607) and will be completed in 1632.Ch√¢teau du Bosc-Th√©roulde, French Ministry of Culture listing (The inscription 1616 can be found on one of the main chimneys.) He married Anne Petit, then died in 1630, and the estate is ruled by his wife on behalf of her nobles children until 1637. Adrien (d. ca. 1669) Le Fae Sieur de Bosc Theroulde, Adviser to the king, 'Maitre en sa Chanmbre de Normandie', inherited the Estate and was made escuyer in 1640. He built the chapel (1646‚Äì1648) along the Chateau, named after his patron saint, after being saved from the plague of Rouen (in 1637 in Rouen 11,000 people died in 10 months). Christophe Charles Le Fa√´ (died 28 March 1707), Lord of Bosc Theroulde, Saint Germain, M√™tillon, La Mivoie and other places, adviser to the Parliament of Rouen, appointed on 3 March 1670, succeeded to Adrien and married Madeleine Le Roux (died 8 May 1719).

The king released him of all condemnation in 1789. He spent the French revolution in the Chateau.

In 2005 the brand was revitalized and the trademark and original bottle designs were filed for international protection. The company has Amanda Witteman as its spokesmodel. History Simon Jarosslawski, a respected 'nose' in the perfume industry, was a pioneering figure designing his bottles in a modern abstract geometric style. He held very strong artistic views. He created perfumes for the emancipated young women of the era. A distinguishing and characterizing feature of Ybry are the modern geometrical bottles. Ybry also had an office in New York City. Ybry perfumes were advertised as being \\"the most expensive in the world\\". During the Great Depression the unemployment and panic in the United States was to have a chilling effect on the fortunes of the French luxury trades. The production costs of the prestigious and luxurious Ybry creations weakened the financial position of the company and Simon Jaroslawski went into personal bankruptcy in 1932. The Ybry brand name however continued to exist in the USA until the 1940s. Products =Cooperation with Lalique and Baccarat= Jaroslawski collaborated with Baccarat for the perfume bottles but also had commissioned Lalique to create the luxurious Art Nouveau glass medallions. Baccarat produced the classic Ybry perfume bottle, a flattened square in colored crystal. These beautiful bottles were made by overlaying colored crystal on white crystal to create an opaque and unique luminescent quality. Each different color, was related to a particular perfume, and to a different gem. The colors range from a red, slag green to a darker green, jet black, orange to butterscotch, deep purple to lavender. Most of the time, the bottles had matching enameled and gilded metal covers. These covers were placed over the inner stoppers at an angle on one corner of the bottle. The atomizers came equipped with either chrome or gilt brass hardware. The colored bottles had round gold foil embossed labels, the black bottles had square, silver foil embossed labels. This bottle received a patent granted on 1925. The bottles ranged in size from 7 7/8\\" tall down to diminutive sample sizes of just 1 3/8\\" tall. The presentation boxes were covered with fine leather and often had color-coordinated small triangular segments and luxurious silk tassels. Other boxes looked like little suitcases and were covered in suede, and held multiple presentations, such as three bottles and two atomizers. Another rare example held two bottles, one atomizer and a Lalique medallion attached to the case with a silk tassel.Information courtesy of CLEOPATRA'S BOUDOIR =The vintage perfumes of the Ybry line= *1925 Mon Ame *1925 Femmes de Paris *1927 Desir du Coeur *1927 Devinez *1928 Les Bourgeons *1929 Amour Sauvage *1929 Les Fleurs d'Ybry *1929 Un Soir de Ma Vie *1931 Toujours l'Amaint *1932 L'Amour Toujours *1935 Joie de Vivre *1935 Hearts Desire *1939 Odorade *1939 Old Fashion Garden *1940 French Bouquet *1940 Eau de Cologne *1940 French Cologne *1940 Naturelle *1940 Honeysuckle *1940 Wild Daphne *1942 Palo Alto *1944 The Buds *Infusion de Fleurs *Mon desir =The relaunch= The perfumes Amour Sauvage, Femme de Paris, Desire du C≈ìur, Mon Ame, Devinez and Ruban Rose (Pink Ribbon) are in coloured crystal bottles with engraved and enamelled square brass toppers.

Many methods have been developed to enhance or quench the radiation by adjusting the size, changing the structure, and adding other materials to the quantum structures. By doing these, the radiation patterns are regulated, which are expected to have the potential to lead to a new class of light sources. In this page, recent research on zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures is introduced and the principles of the enhancement and quenching in the structures are discussed. ZnO quantum dots The optical properties of ZnO quantum dots can be controlled by changing of the size. As the size of the ZnO nanocolloids increases, the absorbance increases, but optical band gap of the nanocolloids decreases. The third-order optical susceptibility increases with increasing particle size. ZnO quantum wires Radiation fields are changed by the methods to fabricate the quantum wires. Micro photoluminescence spectra of an individual suspended as-grown ZnO nanowire and an individual ZnO nanowire processed by sonication/dispersion procedure. The thickness of the nanowire tends to change the radiation fields. The thickness of the nanowire is also related to the peak wavelength. For the nanowire with regular shape shown, only slight difference in UV to visible emission ratios was observed for the two parts with different diameters. Correspondingly, UV emission peaks have almost the same position at 375.2 nm. On the other hands, for the nanowire with irregular shape and rougher surface, with the decrease of the diameter, dramatically increased green emission and decreased UV emission can be observed, which was accompanied by the red shift of the UV emission peak energy. ZnO quantum wells Radiation fields of ZnO quantum wells can be adjusted by coupling through localized surface plasmons. By sputtering Ag islands onto ZnO films, their band gap emission coming through the Ag island films was enhanced by threefolds, while the defect emission was quenched. The enhancement is mainly dependent on the Ag island size. photoluminescence spectra of seven samples which have different Ag island sizes are represented; #4 sample has the largest size of island, but # 1 sample has the smallest size of the island. It is revealed that sputtering time related to the island size have an effect on the enhancement of 380 nm band and 530 nm band. The PL enhancement or quenching may be due to the coupling of the light emission with the localized surface plasmon resonance of the Ag islands. When localized surface Plasmon resonance scattering dominates over the absorption process, the localized surface Plasmon energy can be recovered to free space emission, leading to the enhancement of light emission. Otherwise, light emission will be attenuated due to non-radiative dissipation of localized surface plasmon absorption.

The eighth season was the first to be shown on ABC after NBC dropped the series, ending its seven-year run on the network. ABC's pick-up of the show was followed by it commissioning nineteen episodes, which included an hour-long finale. For all of the season's run, it was expected that the eighth season would be the last, especially after the show's creator Bill Lawrence announced it. After rumors surfaced of a ninth season, it was understood that the eighth would be the last to star Zach Braff and much of the main cast. However, the show was later re-commissioned for another season, in which Braff and other cast members appeared for multiple episodes. The eighth season was the first to air in high definition. Needing to cut costs for the eighth season, Bill Lawrence stated that he divided the writing staff up into two groups, half for the first seven episodes and half for the last eleven episodes. Additionally, each main cast member was absent for three episodes during the season (except Zach Braff and Sarah Chalke who are absent for two). An accompanying web series that aired on ABC's website called Scrubs: Interns was also created to coincide with the season, starring the new interns with guest appearances by the main cast.

The season's timeslot shifted from Scrubs being shown on Tuesdays at 9:00 pm and 9:30 pm to Wednesdays at 8:00 pm beginning with episode 11, \\"My Nah Nah Nah.\\" The show performed most successfully on Wednesdays, with average viewing figures of 5.36 million an episode. To cut costs the writing staff was split into two groups, with the exception of Bill Lawrence, Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan, and Bill Callahan: one group for the first seven episodes, and the second for the rest of the season. Since Goldman & Donovan, Callahan and Lawrence wrote an episode in the second half, the term was longer. Mike Schwartz and Mark Stegemann, two writers who had been on since season one, did not return to the writing staff, although Stegemann did return to direct one episode.

The bank was listed on the NASDAQ Global Market (GFLB) on December 5, 2007 and joined the American Bankers Association Community Bank Index in June 2008. At the end of 2009, it was the 11th-largest South Florida-based bank by assets. As of April 13, 2010, according to a consent order filed with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. the bank is required to raise additional capital. On January 31, 2014, Weston- based Florida Community Bank acquired Great Florida Bank elevating its status to the fourth largest bank headquartered in Florida, with about $5 billion in assets and more than 60 locations along both Florida coasts and in the Orlando area. History M. Mehdi Ghomeshi, who began his banking career with Barnett Bank until its sale to NationsBank in 1998, founded Great Florida Bank in 2004. In December 1998, Ghomeshi became president and a director of BankUnited, FSB, and served in that capacity until April 15, 2001 when he became Executive Vice Chairman. Ghomeshi left BankUnited in November 2002. Bank operations The bank operates twenty-eight \\"Solution Centers\\" located throughout Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties. Great Florida Bank participates in the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program which provides unlimited Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) coverage on all non-interest bearing transaction account balances through December 31, 2009. In 2004, Great Florida Bank opened in downtown Miami, and continued its expansion out of Miami area in 2005 and 2006, when it opened several locations in South Florida. However, in 2006, the bank was served with a FDIC cease and desist order citing unsafe and unsound banking practices and violations of the Bank Secrecy Act; Notwithstanding the cease and desist order, the bank was successfully listed on the NASDAQ Global Market on December 5, 2007. The FDIC order was lifted in March 2009. In 2008, the bank opened seven new outlets in South Florida, giving the bank a total of 28 centers in that area. Great Florida Bank joined the American Bankers Association Community Bank Index in June 2008. Great Florida Bank surpassed $1 billion in assets after only eighteen months in operation; at the time, that made it one of the fastest growing de novo institutions in the country. As of 31 March 2009, the bank operated 28 outlets located throughout Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties; total assets were $1.7 billion, Tier 1 Capital was $131 million, and the Tier 1 Leverage ratio was 7.4% -- 48% above the federal regulatory definition of a \\"Well Capitalized Bank.\\" In January 2010, NASDAQ informed the Miami Lakes-based bank (NASDAQ: GFLB) that its common stock traded below the required level for 30 consecutive business days, and warned of a possible delisting if the share price continued to trade below the $1.00 threshold. The company's shares traded at $2.29 on 27 January 2009, and hit a 52-week low of $0.49 on 31 December 2009. As of 31 March 2010, the bank was out of compliance with its capital ratios, which were 5.55% for Tier 1 leverage capital ratio and 10.6% for total risk-based capital ratio. On 13 April 2010, the bank signed a consent order with the FDIC, requiring it to increase its Tier 1 leverage capital ratio to 8%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 12%, within 120 days. Still faced with capital adequacy pressures, the bank failed to meet its deadline from its regulators to raise capital by November 2010.Brian Bandell (February 4, 2011). \\"Capital crunch grows bigger for banks\\" South Florida Business Journal Acquisition On January 17, 2014, Florida Community Bank received regulatory approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to acquire Great Florida Bank. M. Mehdi Ghomeshi, president and chief executive officer of Great Florida Bank, said, \\"This merger is a win for our stockholders, customers and banking franchise. This business combination significantly enhances our combined abilities to be one of the financially strongest and most competitive community banking organizations in Florida. We are confident that this merger is a highly attractive strategic alignment for all of our constituents.\\" Florida Community Bank acquired Great Florida Bank effective as of the close of business on January 31, 2014.

He hires a secretary, Miss Murphy, and gains a partner in Freddy Lee, a young man from Texas, with whom he peddles a song that piano player Chester Dooley has written. They hear the singer Terry Martin is performing with trumpeter Harry James at a club, so they go there to pitch the song to her. Terry's sister is also in the act; she is Liza, the girl Bill once awkwardly met. Freddy annoys Terry but the girls like the song, \\"I'll Get By,\\" and agree to record it. Before long, it and they become huge successes.

Her identity was kept private at the time, and she was referred to only as D. Amy Dunne was a teenage girl who became pregnant while under HSE care in 2007. A scan of the foetus showed it suffering from anencephaly. This fatal foetal abnormality means the baby would not live for long outside the womb. Dunne wanted to travel to the United Kingdom for an abortion, since abortion in Ireland was very heavily restricted. The HSE attempted to stop her going, from falsely telling her they had a court order preventing her from travelling, and would resort to physically restraining her if needed, and writing to the Garda S√≠och√°na asking them to stop her travelling. Since the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland in 1992, it has not been illegal to travel outside Ireland for an abortion. A High Court judge ruled that she had the right to travel to the UK, and strongly criticised the HSE's handling of the case. The HSE was ordered to pay costs, which were estimated at up to ‚Ç¨1 million. She had a medical, not surgical abortion in the UK. The HSE refused to state if they paid for the abortion.

It is close to the Preston Park and Round Hill areas in the central northern part of the city. Built in 1896 and extended in 1914, its parish was extended after a nearby church closed, but in 2003 it was declared redundant itself. The building, which is listed at Grade II in view of its architectural importance, has stood empty since then, apart from a few years from 2004 when the building was leased by the Elim Pentecostal Church. The Pentecostal congregation made free-standing internal changes to create internal spaces which could be heated in winter, but did not touch the fabric of the building. History Brighton and Hove, which were then separate towns, experienced a surge in churchbuilding during the Victorian era, but St Augustine's church was a relative latecomer. Its construction was a consequence of the gradual development of housing around Preston Village‚Äîan ancient village about north-northwest of central Brighton. It was surrounded by large estates whose land was owned by families such as the Stanfords. The village became popular with daytrippers from Brighton in the early 19th century, with its large park, tea-rooms and other attractions, but residential development did not start until the 1860s, when the Stanford estate began to be broken up and sold. The family imposed conditions on the type and quality of development allowed. For about 40 years from the mid-1860s, streets of large villas, middle-class terraced houses and larger detached houses were built, moving steadily southwards and eastwards from the old village centre towards the northern boundary of Brighton itself. One of the main roads in the area was Stanford Avenue, laid out in the 1880s. Semi- detached villas were built first, followed by other larger houses over the next 20 years. There were no Anglican churches in the vicinity, so architect Granville E. Streatfield was appointed to design and build one. A church hall was added on the north side in 1901. The church was built in two parts‚Äîin 1896 and 1914‚Äîand a church hall was added separately as well. Streatfield started by building a long nave with aisles and a clerestory; the church opened in this form in 1896. A hall, commemorating Queen Victoria, was added on the north side in 1901, and Charles Eamer Kempe, a prolific Victorian stained glass designer, provided some stained glass windows for the church at the same time. The church was completed in 1913‚Äì14 by Streatfield, this time with Sir Thomas Graham Jackson acting as a consultant; Streatfield was a pupil of Jackson's. This project added a chancel and apse, a large ambulatory and a Lady chapel. St Saviour's Church was a slightly earlier church which stood (at ) on Ditchling Road in the Round Hill area of Brighton, southeast of St Augustine's. It was built by local architects Edmund Scott and Frank Cawthorn in 1886 in the Early English style, in flint, stone and red brick. It was extended in 1889, but a proposed tower was never built. Declared redundant and closed in 1981, it was demolished in 1983 and replaced by flats. The former parish was then absorbed by that of St Augustine's Church. The Diocese of Chichester in turn declared St Augustine's redundant as from 22 January 2003, and it officially closed in 2003. It has stood empty since then. The parish, now called St Augustine and St Saviour, was added to that of St John the Evangelist's Church, the parish church of Preston Village, whose parish was renamed \\"Preston, St John the Evangelist with Brighton, St Augustine and St Saviour\\" accordingly. In the early 2000s, the Immanuel Community Church in the Hanover area of Brighton merged with the former Elim Pentecostal church near Preston Park and consolidated their services on the Hanover site. That church was destroyed by fire, and the former St Augustine's Church was offered to the community. They worshipped there until 2009 before moving to the Fountain Centre in Patcham. The church has purchased the site of St Augustine's and intends to redevelop the building and move back. St Augustine's Church was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 22 May 1995. It is one of 1,124 Grade II-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. As of 2014 the church building is undergoing conversion into The St. Augustine's Centre, a multi-purpose community development including apartments, coffee lounge, bistro/cafeteria, and offices.Planning Permission Architecture The church has an apsidal end with flying buttresses. Granville Streatfield designed St Augustine's in the Perpendicular Gothic style using red brick with stone dressings. The brick is laid in a Flemish bond pattern, and the roof is tiled. The nave has 5¬Ω bays, and the later chancel is also quite long (four bays). It terminates in an ornately designed apse at the east end; in contrast, the plain west end was never completed and the tower planned for that end by Streatfield was not built. The entrance is at the west end, in a small porch above which are two lancet windows and a central arched window. There is another porch on the south side (facing Stanford Avenue), with a sundial bearing the inscription . The nave has pairs of lancets all the way round, separated by brick pilasters. There is a series of flying buttresses around the exterior wall of the chancel, which also has lancet windows with tracery work. The Lady chapel has similar features.

The site was one of the largest earthwork ceremonial centers constructed by the Hopewell and is located at the confluence of the Scioto and Ohio Rivers, in present-day Ohio. The majority of the mound complex site is now covered by the city of Portsmouth in Scioto County, Ohio. Several individual sections of the complex have been included on the National Register of Historic Places. Description Originally, the Portsmouth Earthworks consisted of three sections extending over twenty miles of the Ohio River valley, crossing from Ohio to Kentucky in several places. It was surveyed and mapped by E. G. Squier in 1847 for inclusion in the seminal archaeological and anthrolopological work Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley. =Portsmouth Earthworks, Group B= Overview of the Horseshoe Mound The northernmost section was made up of a number of circular enclosures, two large horseshoe-shaped enclosures, and three sets of parallel-walled roads leading away in different directions. One set of walled roads extends across the Ohio River into South Portsmouth, Kentucky to the southwest to Portsmouth Earthworks, Group A. Another set of walled roads lead to the southeast where it also crossed the Ohio River and lead to Portsmouth Earthworks, Group C. The third set of walled roads lead to the northwest for an undetermined distance, and may point to Tremper Mound and Works, some 5 miles away. The City of Portsmouth maintains a public park which includes one of the remaining horseshoe-shaped enclosures, known as Mound Park, it is the only publicly accessible part of the complex. Under the name Horseshoe Mound it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. =Portsmouth Earthworks, Group A= One of the surviving walls Also known as the Old Fort Earthworks (15Gp1) it is a series of rectangular enclosures near South Portsmouth in Greenup County, Kentucky. Group A is a large square enclosure with two series of parallel walls extending from the northeast and southwest corners. The Old Fort Earthworks consist of several sites, including the Old Fort Earthworks (15Gp1), Mays Mound (15Gp16), Hicks Mound (15Gp265), Stephenson Mound (15Lw139), and several other unnamed mounds and enclosures. It is also the location of Lower Shawneetown, a protohistoric/historic Fort Ancient and Shawnee settlement and colonial trading post which are all part of the Lower Shawneetown Archeological District, along with the Thompson and Hansen Sites =Portsmouth Earthworks, Group C= Also known as the Biggs Site (15Gp8), Group C was a large series of concentric circles surrounding a central cone mound, believed to have been built by the Adena culture. This section of the earthworks is located in Greenup County, Kentucky several miles to the east of South Shore, but connected to Group B by a causeway.

In 2009 members and supporters of the HGSC funded an LGBT studies endowed professorship at Harvard, believed to be the first of its kind in the United States. Formed in 1984 to pressure Harvard University to include sexual orientation in its non-discrimination policy, the HGLC's influence resulted in the President and Fellows of Harvard College's 1985 creation of a new University-wide anti-discrimination policy that included discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. After lobbying from the HGLC, in 1993 Harvard began to offer benefits to the same-sex partners of its employees. The HGLC notes its current purposes to include advocating \\"a non-discriminatory and diverse academic, living and working environment at Harvard\\" and maintaining and expanding a network of LGBT alumni/ae. The organization also awards an annual HGLC Public Service Fellowship, and honors Harvard affiliates for contributions to the LGBT community.

It is located at Paseo del Prado #416 between San Rafael and San Miguel. History The hotel traces its origins to 1844, when a two-story building known as El Cafe or The Escauriza Saloon was built at the site. In 1863, El Cafe was sold to Joaquin Payret, who renamed it El Louvre. In 1875, Payret sold the cafe to finance construction of a theater across the street, and the Gran Hotel de Inglaterra was constructed, opening on December 23, 1875. The two-story structure was owned by Manuel L√≥pez and Urban Gonz√°lezhttp://www.hotelinglaterracuba.com/hotel-inglaterra-cuba-history- facts.htm and was designed in the neoclassical style. In 1886, the hotel was sold to Don Francisco Villamil, who added a third floor to the building. General Antonio Maceo stayed at the hotel for six months in 1890. Winston Churchill stayed there while visiting Cuba as a military reporter during the Spanish-Cuban war in December 1895. The Inglaterra was renovated again in 1901, with the addition of electricity, telephones, private bathrooms in each room, and a telegraph link. The fourth floor was added in 1914, along with the iconic glass marquee. In 1931, the hotel was forced to close, due to the impact of the Great Depression. It reopened in 1939. In the 1930s, the hotel was owned and operated by the Sol√©s family. The general manager was Candido Sol√©s.Manifest, U.S. Department of Labor Form 548 dated 4/13/1939 It was remodeled multiple times after the Revolution, in 1973, 1981 and 1989.

Carski Rez literally translates into English as caesarean cut, but generally means caesarean section, or c-section in Serbian. The label has a roster of fifteen artists based in four countries: Serbia, Austria, Canada and Switzerland. With fifteen official releases, it is one of the most prolific labels on the Serbian hip hop scene.For comparison check hiphop releases in the catalogs of other Serbian labels (discogs): Bassivity Music, Carski Rez, One Records, Rap Cartel/Take it or leave it records, Tilt/Automatik Records Although independent, Carski Rez has occasionally partnered with other music labels (namely Magmedia, owned by the rapper ≈†kabo from Beogradski sindikat) for distribution deals. Besides its creative output, Carski Rez also offers production services and a professional recording studio.  History  = Beginnings = When Blokovski (formerly known as Kajblo Spirit), Mauzer (formerly Rastamon) and Kuer formed the group Arhitekti in 2005, they had already garnered a reputation on Serbia's hip hop scene as solo artists. Kajblo Spirit had previously released a demo album, ƒåekanje je muƒçno (Waiting is painful).‚ÄúSpirit Blokovski (label owner and mc with several releases already behind him), backed up by Mauzer (another mc), and Kuer (producer) form up the group Arhitekti since fall 2005. Regular shows, along with an air of enthusiasm which accompanies the groups existence, enabled them to build up a solid reputation in (Serbian) hip hop circles‚Äù ‚Äì Marko Nikolic, Arhitekti EP review , Popboks The group decided to pursue the independent route due to the relatively low popularity of hip hop music in Serbia at the time, and consequently a reluctance on the part of established record labels to promote this genre. May 11, 2006 has entered Carski Rez lore as the official birthdate of the label. New members were added shortly thereafter ‚Äì MC and producer Mothaphonkin Mjan from Novi Beograd, and a producer-MC duo called Sqb & The Easst from the ≈Ωarkovo neighborhood of Belgrade,Od danas jo≈° bolji , -{carskirez.com}-, 16. maj 2006. were all previous collaborators of Blokovski (Mjan appears on Blokovski's pre-Carski Rez album ƒåekanje je muƒçno). Sqb & The Easst had been members of another group together, but began working exclusively together after that group disbanded. Arhitekti performed together with fellow Serbian underground hip hop groups Bauk Skquad and FTP at the Exit 06 music festival in Novi Sad in July 2006. Since then, artists from the label have performed at numerous hip hop events in Belgrade, Novi Sad and Banja Luka. = First Expansion = The end of 2006 saw a Carski Rez expansion in several ways. Upgraded recording equipment and the official website were set up, two new artists (Ask and Mirage) from Novi Sad were added and the label went global with the addition of the Babble Goons (a duo of HighDuke and Skrajb) from Ottawa, Canada and the multi-talented MC/producer/DJ Baron residing in Switzerland.Datum za Zapamtiti , -{carskirez.com}-, 16. December 2006. The work of this international cast was greatly facilitated by Rad i Vizija, a website dedicated to Serbian hip hop and which served as a forum for the exchange of music when other avenues for this did not yet exist in Serbia. Baron and Skrajb had previously collaborated on several songs after establishing contact via Rad i Vizija. Baron had also gathered critical acclaim from the underground hip hop scene for his self-released 2003 album Publika Bezbednosti. His dark and multi-layered sample based sound earned him comparisons to New York indie label Def Jux. = Third Wave to Present Day = The opening of the official Carski Rez studio in 2007 in Banovo Brdo marked a new chapter in the label's work. Two years after their collective beginning, Arhitekti released their first album, ‚ÄúArhitekti EP‚Äù whose lead single Mrzim (I Hate) received moderate airplay on Serbian radio stations. Four months later Blokovski released his third solo effort, Oblici od Oblaka deo 1 (Cloud Shapes Pt. 1) which was voted as the best demo album of the year by visitors of Rad I Vizija, now Serbia's premier hip hop resource on the internet.Demo album - Izbor Radivizija 2007 FINALE Following the release of the Babble Goons album Critical Condition, Skrajb left the group, but continues with Carski Rez as a solo artist. Taking his place are MCs Earthquake Slick and Bigavac, and DJ Grusm, the only member of Carski Rez who is not of Serbian descent. They continue to perform in Ottawa and are currently working on a new album. Another addition to the list of Carski Rez artists is Grema D≈æi, an MC and producer from Austria, who did most of the mastering work on the Babble Goons album. He also owns and runs Maximal Studios, a professional recording studio in Vienna. In 2008, Oblici od Oblaka deo 2 (Cloud Shapes Pt. 2) repeated the success of its predececor, earning Blokovski another demo album of the year title at Rad I Vizija, while the album's leading single \\"Ha Ha\\" was voted best demo song (Sqb & The Easst also found themselves in the final round). Skubi's side project ‚ÄúSkubi predstavlja Gazda Paju‚Äù (Skubi Presents: Gazda Paja ‚Äì Funk‚Äôd Up) was voted as the year's best EP. June 2008 saw the first nationwide release of a Carski Rez album, a compilation featuring all of the label's artists and titled ‚ÄúRez 1‚Äù in cooperation with the music label Magmedia. This release allowed for new exposure, including two critically acclaimed singles from the album, ‚ÄúKosmos‚Äù by Skubi & The Easst and ‚ÄúGengsta Fank‚Äù by Mothaphonkin Mjan. The year ended with another addition to the list of artists ‚Äì Supreme, from Zajeƒçar, who recorded \\"Samo Lagano\\" with Blokovski soon after. Carski Rez remains active with several new releases in 2010. and 2011, of which Blokovski and his album \\"Prototip\\" was the most noted.

Stein, The Riverdale Press is a weekly newspaper that covers the Northwest Bronx neighborhoods of Riverdale, Spuyten Duyvil, Kingsbridge, Kingsbridge Heights and Van Cortlandt Village. It is one of a handful of weeklies to win a Pulitzer Prize.  History  In the 1950s, The Press fought to rezone Riverdale to preserve private homes and open space threatened by development. It played a key role in the creation of new public schools to accommodate the residents of newly built apartments and in rescuing a large tract of land in Spuyten Duyvil for a park. Later, it advocated creation of a special natural area district to protect the area's distinctive trees and rocks In 1978, Bernard Stein succeeded his father as editor, gaining for The Press a reputation as a crusading newspaper. \\"The Riverdale Press courted controversy and cast a tough, skeptical eye on local officials, who ignored the paper at their peril,\\" wrote The New York Times The Press was the first newspaper to disclose corruption on the city's community school boards; its reporting on the construction of the largest medical waste incinerator in the state in the South Bronx led to the indictment of the chair of the local community board and, eventually, to shuttering the incinerator. For that effort, the paper earned the highest honor of the city's Deadline Club, the James Wright Brown Public Service Award, beating out Newsday and Forbes Magazine, the runners-up. Bernard Stein's brother Richard, the paper's general manager, was also responsible for its design, which won so many awards that the New York Press Association named its annual award for overall design excellence the Richard L. Stein Award https://contest.nynewspapers.com/Docs/2017_ContestRules_newX.pdf The Press continues to win this award, most recently in 2018. On David Stein's death in 1982, the brothers became co-publishers of The Press Its current editor, Michael Hinman, joined the publication in March 2017. Firebombing incident At about 5 a.m. on February 28, 1989, two men hurled firebombs at the offices of The Press. No one was hurt, but the first floor of the two-story building was consumed by the flames.Office of Weekly Paper in Riverdale Is Firebombed, By DAVID E. PITT, New York Times, Wednesday, March 1, 1989 Violence against the press: policing the public sphere in U.S. history, By John C. Nerone, Oxford University Press, 1994, p. 204 The bombing took place five days after the newspaper published an editorial defending the right to read Salman Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, while the editorial was still on newsstands. A call to 911 claiming responsibility said the newspaper was bombed in retaliation for its editorial. The Society of Professional Journalists gave the paper's co-publishers Richard and Bernard Stein its First Amendment Award for their courage in continuing to publish despite the severe damage caused to the paper's offices by the firebombing.\\"Riverdale Press To Be Honored\\", Tuesday, May 9, 1989 The editorial that enraged the bombers is posted on Bernard Stein's blog. For 10 years on the anniversary of the bombing-for as long as Rushdie remained in hiding-the paper published an editorial about the author, both to call attention to his plight and to demonstrate that the bombers had not intimidated the paper.http://www.pulitzer.org/article/we-shall-not-be-silenced Pulitzer Prize In 1998, Press editor and co-publisher Bernard L.

Cyclone Xavier was also the strongest storm of the season. During the next day it rapidly developed and was designated as Tropical Depression 01F later that day, before being designated as Tropical Cyclone Xavier while over Santa Cruz early on October 22. Later on October 22, Xavier intensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, before passing over Tikopia early the next day. Xavier then reached its peak wind speeds of 175 km/h (110 mph 10-min), which made it a Category 4 cyclone early on October 24. Xavier stayed at its peak wind speeds until early the next day when it started to rapidly weaken, becoming a depression early on October 26. The remnants of Xavier persisted until October 28 before dissipating. There were no casualties reported as a result of the storm and little impact reported in the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Meteorological history During October 20, 2006 the Fiji Meteorological Service and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center started to monitor a tropical depression, that had developed within the South Pacific Convergence Zone to the north of Temotu Province in the Solomon Islands.http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc- ph/RSS/jtwc/best_tracks/2007/2007s-bsh/bsh012007.txt The system was located within an area of low to moderate vertical wind shear and had a good outflow in its northern and eastern quadrants. Over the next day conditions surrounding the system rapidly became favourable for further development, with convection starting to wrap into a well defined low level circulation centre. As a result, the depression rapidly developed further and was named Xavier by the FMS during October 22, after it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. After the system was named the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 01P, while it was located over the Santa Cruz Islands. Throughout October 22, Xavier's rapid intensification continued with it developing an eye feature and becoming a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. During that day the system performed a small cyclonic loop over Temotu Province and passed near or over the Santa Cruz Island of Tikopia. The systems rapid intensification subsequently slowed down during October 23, as an upper-level anticyclone located to the northwest of the system impeded the systems outflow. The system also started to move south-eastwards during that day, as a trough of low pressure created a break in the ridge of high pressure that was steering Xavier. The FMS subsequently estimated during October 24, that the system had peaked as a Category 4 Severe Tropical Cyclone with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of , while it was located about to the east of Vanua Lava in northern Vanuatu. The JTWC also estimated during October 24, that the system had peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of , which made it equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Over the next day the system maintained its peak intensity as it moved south-eastwards, before it turned westwards during the next day towards Vanuatu and rapidly weakened after it moved into an area of cooler sea-surface temperatures and strong vertical wind-shear. As a result, during October 26, The FMS and JTWC both reported that the system had weakened into a tropical depression, with the JTWC issuing their final advisory on the system as they expected it to dissipate within 12 hours. Xavier's remnants were last noted by the FMS during October 28, after the systems low level circulation centre was not able to be distinguished. Preparations and impact Cyclone Xavier strengthening on October 23 Early on October 22, both RSMC Nadi and TCWC Brisbane started to issue special advisories to support the meteorological services of Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands in tracking the cyclone. As Xavier was over the islands of Santa Cruz the whole of Temotu Province was placed under a tropical cyclone gale warning, while cyclone watches were declared for Rennel, Bellona, and Vanuatu. During the next 24 hours, the Torres and Banks Islands, as well as Espirito Santo, Maewo, Ambae, were placed under a cyclone warning. The warnings for the Solomon Islands were then cancelled early the next day, while the warnings for Vanuatu were maintained until late on October 25, when RSMC Nadi discontinued them. There were no casualties as a result of Xavier. In the Solomon Islands, communications to the Temotu province were lost. When communications were restored on October 24, it was reported that there was only minor tree damage on the islands of Utupua and Vanikolo. On Tikopia, crops sustained damage, though the effects were considered light given the circumstances. Strong and gusty winds, rough seas and moderate to heavy swells were reported within the eastern Vanuatuan islands, however, no significant damage was reported within the islands.

The film is an American crime-horror flick filmed in Virginia Beach, Virginia. It is widely distributed through A.I.P Home Video and continues to be a cult favorite. Plot A police detective's fiance is killed by a maniacal, murdering crystal meth dealer dubbed by the media as, \\"The Satan Killer\\" played by James Westbrook, so he decides to go on a solo head hunt for him. Along the way, he teams up with an ex-cop (Billy Franklin) and an ex-male nurse. The main character, detective Stephens, is an atrocious alcoholic, drowning his sorrows daily. At one point he gets saved from a brutal beating by a drag queen. Throughout his Journey, he ends up brutally killing about a half dozen innocent people who stand in his way of apprehending The Satan Killer. We then find the Satan Killer's real name is Jimbo. Soon after, we discover his twisted sordid history. A scene is played where Jimbo is only a young man, and asks a priest why his mother and God hate him. Jimbo begins crying, then the film cuts to a scene with him, as a troubled adult male, standing in front of a church, where he shouts at the top of his lungs in anger \\"You never fooled me!\\". Yet, there is a soft side to Jimbo. During another scene, Jimbo's boss (and drug supplier) attempts to rape a young blonde. Jimbo tells him to lay off her and spares her life. As it turns out, we learn Jimbo's mother was an abusive stripper battling an addiction who ridiculed him throughout childhood. The blonde young woman resembled his mother so he felt for her and saved her life. The Satan Killer viciously stalks the streets and takes down evil. At one point Detective Stephens catches a pimp in an alleyway beating up a hooker. Upon gaining his attention he asks \\"whats your name?\\". The pimp responds by pulling a gun and then getting shot in the chest by Stephens as three punk clad teens watch in horror. One teen merely cusses at Stephens. Even though Stephens is prone to violent behavior, Stephens simply walks off to continue his tirade, sparing the children perhaps due to an unspoken camaraderie. The Satan Killer is finally apprehended and killed at the conclusion of the film. DVD The Satan Killer is not yet available on DVD.

Mackie played international rugby for the British Isles XV on their 1896 tour of South Africa and on the return from Africa he was awarded two caps for the English team. Personal history Mackie was born in Wakefield in 1869 to Colonel E. A. B. Mackie of Kirkthorpe and was educated at Haileybury School before entering Clare College, Cambridge in 1895 receiving his BA in 1898. Before entering Cambridge, Mackie set up a business in Hamburg and in 1891 he had businesses in Hull and Wakefield, relinquishing them in 1895 to become an undergraduate student. In 1899 he was ordained a deacon at Ripon Cathedral and in 1901 was ordained a priest. Mackie was a Curate of Leeds in 1901 and from 1899 to 1913 he became the Vicar of St Paul's in Middlesbrough. After leaving Middlesbrough he was the Rector of Guisborough, a post he held from 1922 until his death in 1927. Rugby career He first played for Wakefield Trinity before resigning the captaincy after the schism in rugby that saw the formation of the Northern Union and the move of Wakefield Trinity, who had been the principal rugby club in the city, to the new code of rugby league.Wakefield Rugby Football Club‚Äî1901‚Äì2001 A Centenary History. Written and compiled by David Ingall in 2001. He subsequently became a member of the Cambridge University team. He won three sporting Blues when he played in the Varsity rugby match against Oxford University between 1895 and 1897 and was awarded the honour of captaining the team. While still at Cambridge, Mackie was selected to represent Johnny Hammonds's 1896 British Isles team on their tour of South Africa. It was a successful tour for the British team and Mackie: the team won the series 3‚Äì1, while Mackie was selected for all four tests. The tourists stuck with the same four threequarters until the final match, with Mackie being joined by Lawrence Bulger, J. F. Byrne and Robert Johnston. Mackie scored in two of the tests, a dropped goal in the second test, played in Johannesburg and a try in the third test, which was played in Kimberley; both were tourist victories. On Mackie's return from South Africa he was selected for the England squad, playing in two internationals, the final game of the 1897 Home Nations Championship against Scotland and the opening game of the 1898 Championship. In 1898 Mackie was chosen to represent invitational touring side the Barbarians.Starmer-Smith, Nigel The Barbarians Macdonald & Jane's Publishers (1977) pg. 226 In 1901 he became a vice-president of the newly formed Wakefield rugby union team.

When Finucane was away, Rachael English or Brendan O‚ÄôConnor presented the programme. Finucane died on 2 January 2020.  History  The show started in 1999 after the retirement of veteran broadcaster Gay Byrne. She had moved from her Liveline slot which she had had since the late 1970s. The programme stayed in that early morning slot from 09:00 to 10:00 until 2005. Then the programme was replaced by RT√â 2fm DJ Ryan Tubridy. His new programme The Tubridy Show, was similar in format keeping old items such as her book club. Her programme was then moved to a weekend slot from 11:00 to 13:00. In 2001, the political career of Fianna F√°il minister Joe Jacob was damaged when he was unable to explain to Finucane and her listeners what people should do in the event of a nuclear explosion at Sellafield. The show was discontinued when Finucane died suddenly on the 2 January 2020.  Format  The show began with Finucane's signature tune. She spoke over the music saying: > Hello there, and a very good-morning to you! When the tune stopped she previewed the newspapers of that day. The programme continued on with interviews, human interest stories, consumer and lifestyle news as well as panel discussions on issues of the week. In the second hour, there were typically guests in studio or by telephone link. The show was a public forum for serious issues such as the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and Shell to Sea campaign. At the end of the Sunday programme, entertainment journalists previewed the coming week in television and film. Michael Dwyer was a regular contributor to this slot.

History In 1955 the museum constructed the Ben Lane Printing Shop as a working exhibit. A variety of presses and other equipment demonstrate daily the printing process. The shop also hosts educational programs for children and adults, while manufacturing items for the museum. Today the building accommodates a typical, small-town printing shop from the first half of the 20th century. Although larger printing businesses of the period adopted the modern process of offset lithography, the new technology arrived slowly to rural areas. Consequently, a press such as the Ben Lane Printing Shop continued to use moveable-type letterpress production similar to that devised by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century. The Ben Lane Printing Shop houses the type of equipment that a proprietor and his successors would accumulate in adapting their press to a half-century's technological advancements. In the first decades of the 20th century, print shops continued to use old-fashioned presses for specific purposes. In the case of the Ben Lane Printing Shop, even an 1820s vintage hand press remained in occasional service. Likewise, the Cotrell newspaper press, manufactured in 1871, rolled on a regular basis, as did a treadle- operated Dorman job press of the same vintage for smaller work. Although printers still utilized racks of wood and metal type, a complicated and often cantankerous Linotype machine fulfilled many of the shop's composition requirements. The final addition of a high-speed Heidelberg press with automatic inking and paper feed operated quickly and efficiently and dramatically increased output. The name The museum named its printing shop in honor of Benjamin Battles Lane (1897‚Äì1987), whose father, Frank, founded the Lane Press of Burlington, Vermont, in 1904. Ben Lane served as president and general manager of Lane Press from 1928-1961. His support enabled the museum to install this exhibit and open it to the general public as a living tribute to a centuries-old craft. Printing Prints, which are created by using a press and metal plate system, made possible the production of multiple copies of the same image. In late 18th century America, the local silversmith with a talent for engraving on metal often worked with the town printer to produce printed pictures for the general public. Letterpresses and printing procedures are demonstrated in the museum's Print Shop. See also *Printing press References * Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections.

It flew during 1934-6 in both land- and seaplane configurations. Although only one was built, it was the progenitor of the Fairey Swordfish. Development The design evolution that led to the Fairey Swordfish began with Fairey's submission to Air Ministry specification S.9/30 for a two-seat fleet spotter- reconnaissance aircraft. The company were awarded funds for a prototype in August 1931. The resulting aircraft, which did not fly until 22 February 1934 was known only by its specification number. The Fairey S.9/30 was constructed throughout with stainless steel strip and tube, fabric covered. It was a single bay biplane with wings of slight stagger and sweep. The lower wing was a little smaller both in span and chord; because of these differences the interplane struts converged noticeably towards the lower wing and the outer pairs leaned slightly outwards. Ailerons were only fitted to the upper wing, which also had leading edge slots. The wings could fold for on-ship storage. The most obvious difference between the S.9/30 and its descendants was the powerplant, the former having a liquid cooled V-12 Rolls-Royce Kestrel, rather than the radial engine of the Swordfish. This engine was steam cooled, with condensers on the underside of the upper wing centre section. The upper wing was above the top of the fuselage and the pilot's open cockpit was just behind the trailing edge of the narrow chord centre section, his view enhanced by the resulting cut-outs in both wings. Immediately behind him there was a long cockpit for the gunner. The empennage was conventional, with a braced tailplane and balanced control surfaces. The S.9/30 was flown from land and later as a seaplane. Its wheeled undercarriage was divided, the main legs meeting the forward spar under the centre section interplane struts and with forward bracing to the fuselage at the rear of the engine bay. The main wheels had low pressure tyres and were fitted with wheel brakes; there was a small tailwheel. As a seaplane, it had a single central float, braced by two forward struts to the rear of the engine and a pair of aft struts joining the float to the rear wing spar. This float, almost as long as the aircraft and projecting well forward of the nose, had a single step and a water rudder. A pair of stabilizing floats were mounted outboard, braced to the wings spars under the outer interplane struts. Tests in the landplane configuration continued through 1934, when the floats were fitted. It first flew as a seaplane on 15 January 1935 at Fairey's Hamble base. It went for Naval tests at Felixstowe in 1936, where its clean behaviour on the water was praised. In the air, the controls were found to be \\"heavy but positive\\". Towards the Swordfish At the same time as they were rather slowly building the S.9/30, Fairey were also working on a very similar aircraft that would combine the spotter reconnaissance role with that of a torpedo bomber. Originally intended for the Greek Air Force, it only differed in having a 625 hp (466 kW) radial Armstrong Siddeley Panther VI engine. This aircraft became known as the TSR I and flew for the first time on 21 March 1933, well before the S.9/30. Apart from the engine, the TSR I differed from the S.9/30 only in having strut-interlinked ailerons on both wings and, initially, a spatted undercarriage. In June the engine was changed to a 635 hp (474 kW) Bristol Pegasus IIM, another radial enclosed, like the previous powerplant, in a narrow chord Townend ring. At about the same time it lost its spats and arrestor hook. The sole aircraft was lost after a flat spin in September 1934. Despite its loss, the performance was good enough to call for the production of another aircraft to the specification S.15/33, an amalgamation of the earlier specifications S.9/30 and M.1/30 for a torpedo bomber. The resulting machine was the TSR II; compared to the TSR I it was lengthened and the altered centre of gravity accommodated by increased wing sweep. It had a broader chord rudder and a wide chord cowled Pegasus engine. This was the Swordfish prototype.

He went to Philadelphia with his parents in 1848, and was educated at the Central High School of Philadelphia, and after graduating he studied law in the office of Moses A. Dropsie. In 1864 he was admitted to the bar, and attained eminence in the practice of his profession. He was elected judge of the Court of Common Pleas on the Republican ticket in 1895, and was reelected as a nominee of both parties in 1904, becoming the presiding judge of the Court of Common Pleas No. 2. Sulzberger throughout his career showed great interest in Jewish affairs. While studying for the bar he taught at the Hebrew Education Society's school. For a time he was interested in the affairs of Maimonides College and was secretary of its board. He was closely associated with Isaac Leeser, and assisted that scholar in editing \\"The Occident,\\" contributing to it a partial translation of Maimonides' \\"Moreh Nebukim.\\" After Leeser's death Sulzberger edited vol. xxvi. of \\"The Occident.\\" He was one of the founders of the Young Men's Hebrew Association, which he served as president; and he has taken great interest in the Jewish Hospital of Philadelphia, of which he has been vice- president since 1880. He was from the beginning (in 1888) chairman of the publication committee of the Jewish Publication Society of America; was one of the original trustees of the Baron de Hirsch fund; and interested himself in the establishment of agricultural colonies at Woodbine, N. J., and in Connecticut. Sulzberger had one of the best private libraries in America; it contained a very large number of Hebraica and Judaica, together with many other early Hebrew printed books (including no less than forty-five Incunabula), and many manuscripts, and these he presented to the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in 1904, at whose reorganization he assisted and of which he was a life director. Sulzberger was a finished orator, and was chosen as the orator of the Jewish community upon several notable occasions.

Early life  Tere A Zubizarreta was born in Cuba, and in the early 1960s emigrated to the United States. Herself a product of change, Tere was displaced from her country by the Castro revolution in Cuba in 1959, arriving in the U.S. just in time to experience the Civil Rights and Women's movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Leaving behind a life and lifestyle that could never be replicated, she was undaunted by the realities of political exile, reinventing her roles as wife and mother, and embarking on a career that not only became a passion and successful business venture, but a catalyst for her future impact on the community. Advertising career Zubizarreta began as a Cuban-American woman with no college degree in 1970s America. Tere's career in advertising started at McCann/Marshalk Advertising, where she started as a secretary and worked her way thru the agency's many departments. In 1976, she started Zubi Advertising Services in a rented office in Miami with one phone and a borrowed typewriter. In addition to a borrowed desk, a phone and a $465 retainer from her first client, she was armed with the vision that the Hispanic consumer segment would grow to help redefine American culture, and with a mission to help remove what she believed was the greatest barrier preventing minorities from participating in the American Dream: the blinding power of stereotypes.

Aspects of Mission Assurance  Mission Assurance includes the disciplined application of system engineering, risk management, quality, and management principles to achieve success of a design, development, testing, deployment, and operations process. Mission Assurance's ideal is achieving 100% customer success every time. Mission Assurance reaches across the enterprise, supply base, business partners, and customer base to enable customer success. The ultimate goal of Mission Assurance is to create a state of resilience that supports the continuation of an agency's critical business processes and protects its employees, assets, services, and functions. Mission Assurance addresses risks in a uniform and systematic manner across the entire enterprise. Mission Assurance is an emerging cross-functional discipline that demands its contributors (project management, governance, system architecture, design, development, integration, testing, and operations) provide and guarantee their combined performance in use. The United States Department of Defense 8500-series of policies has three defined mission assurance categories that form the basis for availability and integrity requirements. A Mission Assurance Category (MAC) is assigned to all DoD systems . It reflects the importance of an information system for the successful completion of a DoD mission. It also determines the requirements for availability and integrity. * MAC I systems handle information vital to the operational readiness or effectiveness of deployed or contingency forces. Because the loss of MAC I data would cause severe damage to the successful completion of a DoD mission, MAC I systems must maintain the highest levels of both integrity and availability and use the most rigorous measure of protection. * MAC II systems handle information important to the support of deployed and contingency forces. The loss of MAC II systems could have a significant negative impact on the success of the mission or operational readiness. The loss of integrity of MAC II data is unacceptable; therefore MAC II systems must maintain the highest level of integrity. The loss of availability of MAC II data can be tolerated only for a short period of time, so MAC II systems must maintain a medium level of availability. MAC II systems require protective measures above industry best practices to ensure adequate integrity and availability of data. * MAC III systems handle information that is necessary for day-to-day operations, but not directly related to the support of deployed or contingency forces. The loss of MAC III data would not have an immediate impact on the effectiveness of a mission or operational readiness. Since the loss of MAC III data would not have a significant impact on mission effectiveness or operational readiness in the short term, MAC III systems are required to maintain basic levels of integrity and availability. MAC III systems must be protected by measures considered as industry best practices.

It is now an exhibition building at Shelburne Museum in Shelburne, Vermont. History The Wagner Palace Car Company fabricated the rail car Grand Isle in April 1899 for Dr. William Seward Webb, president of the company from 1885 to 1899. The wood-clad business car was initially listed as Rutland RR 500 Grand Isle. Although Webb was trained as a physician, his father-in-law, William Henry Vanderbilt, persuaded him to give up the medical profession and join the family's railroad enterprise instead. As president of the Wagner Palace Car Company and then the Rutland Railroad from 1902-1905, Webb lived for part of the year in Shelburne, Vermont, from whence he commuted with relative ease to New York City. Grand Isle was one of a group of rail cars owned by Webb. Among them, others made by Wagner included the Ellsmere, constructed in 1888, and the Mariquita, converted to a nursery car for a trip with family and friends between California and Alaska in 1888-89. Webb later presented the Grand Isle to former Vermont governor and Central Vermont Railway president Edward C. Smith. The car's mahogany-paneled parlor, elegant dining room, staterooms, and plush furnishings typified the private luxury cars that became important symbols of rank to railroad men, business tycoons, and public figures in the final quarter of the 19th century. When the museum purchased the Grand Isle in 1960, its paneling had been painted, its fixtures replaced, and its lush fittings removed to convert it to use as a business car. J. Watson Webb Jr., Dr. Webb's grandson, supervised the car's renovation, ensuring that it would once again embody the days of luxury rail travel and commemorate his family‚Äôs role in the railroad industry.

The lines were later isolated from Southey's and expanded. The new poem includes Coleridge's feelings on politics, religion, and humanity's duty to helping each other. Background The idea for Destiny of the Nations originates during mid-1795 while Coleridge gave lectures and was working with Southey on Joan of Arc.Mays 2001 p. 279 While working on the epic, he set many of the lines he wrote aside for his own poem. Charles Lamb's response to Coleridge's reuse of the lines was to say in a letter on 5 February 1797:Ashton 1997 p. 99 > You cannot surely mean to degrade the Joan of Arc into a pot girl. You are > not going, I hope, to annex to that most splendid ornament of Southey's poem > all this cock and a bull story of Joan the publican's daughter of > Neufchatel, with the lamentable episode of a waggoner, his wife, and six > children; the texture will be most lamentably disproportionate. The first > forty or fifty lines of these addenda are, no doubt, in their way, > admirable, too; but many would prefer the Joan of Southey.Lamb 1905 p. 89 At the beginning of 1797, Coleridge attempted to complete the poem for a 1797 edition of his poems. However, he was unable to finish and was discouraged by Lamb's words. He soon replaced the poem with Ode to the Departing Year in the collection.Holmes 1989 p. 140 The Destiny of Nations was expanded and those lines were published in the 26 December 1797 Morning Post as The Visions of the Maid of Orleans: A Fragment. Coleridge continued trying to finish the poem in 1798, but he abandoned it at the end of 1799 until taking it back up again in mid-1814.Mays 2001 pp. 279‚Äì280 The poem was not published in full until 1817. Poem The final version of the poem contains 272 lines, the last being incomplete, of which lines 1‚Äì120 correspond to lines 1‚Äì119 of Joan of Arc Book II. These lines are followed by those published in the Morning Post, which make up lines 121‚Äì271a. The poem is concluded with a series of fragments from Joan of Arc Book II that make up the rest of what he wrote for the epic.Mays 2001 p. 280 The poem begins with the narrator's searching for the divine through use of his senses:Rzepka 1986 p. 117 Then, the poem introduces the figure of the Greenland Wizard: The actual \\"maid of Orleans\\" is described in terms of her knowledge of humanity, her background, and her relationship with nature in the next section:Radley 1966 p. 39 The poem continues by explaining how she works to help humanity and society. Afterward, the narrator describes her condition within an imperfect world, how she is one of God's elect, and her destiny to lead people towards a better world: Themes The topic of the poem deals with the \\"maid of Orleans\\", or Joan of Arc, and how she was able to conquer her enemies. The maid is educated by nature and is said to know more about society and humanity than the educated. Her destiny is to fix society and to lead humanity to a better life. However, she is a character that is also separated from humanity in a way similar to the characters found within many Romantic poems. Philosophically, the poem is rooted in the works of Plato and Plotinus along with St. Paul. There is a connection within the poem to the ideas of Berkley,Radley 1966 pp. 39‚Äì40 and the original lines of the poem were influenced by the philosophy of Godwin, Hartley, and Priestley. Coleridge, at the end of his life, wrote: \\"Within 12 months after the writing of this poem my bold Optimism, and Necessitarianism, together with the Infra, sue plusquam-Socinianism, down to which, step by step, I had unbelieved, gave way to the day-break of a more genial and less shallow System. But I contemplate with pleasure these Phases of my Transition.\\"Mays 2001 qtd. p. 280 One aspect of the poem is the search for the divine within nature. The poet's role is to use what is inside of him to add symbolic meaning to the world. Nature, in such a situation, serves as a sort of text from which to gain knowledge. This idea would be later expanded in his Opus Maximum project and was contained in other poems including \\"The Eolian Harp\\". Other connections to his works include the Greenland Wizard, which serves as a legendary precursor to Coleridge's mythical Rime of the Ancient Mariner. Sources The poem provides insight into what works Coleridge was relying on and would rely on again when he wrote The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. He makes these works clear in his footnotes, such as one from Crantz's History of Greenland Vol. I. Other footnotes refer to Lemius's De Lapponibus and the Book of Revelation.Mays 2001 pp. 284, 293 Other sources are the works of Godwin, Hartley, and Priestley along with Erasmus Darwin's Botanic Garden. More general influences on individual lines include Richard Glover's Leonidas (1737), James Thomsons's Winter, and Bryan Edwards History, Civil and Commercial, of the British Colonies in the West Indies (1793‚Äì1794).Mays 2001 pp. 281, 283, 297 Critical response Virginia Radley claims that the poem \\"contain faults similar to those manifest in the Chatterton monodies: an abundance of personification, forced diction, contrived rhymes, sentimentality, and lack of unity. within the greater context of the Romantic point of view, however, Coleridge's 'Maid' is important. Isolation, loneliness, a feeling of alienation‚Äîall characterize the Harolds, Manfreds, Lucys, Michaels, and Mariners of a later-day Romanticism.\\"Radley 1966 p. 40 Rosemary Ashton believes that \\"The chief, perhaps only, interest of the poem, or rather set of fragments strung together, is that it display Coleridge's reading at this time of books which yielded much finer fruits in The Ancient Mariner, begun later in the same year.\\" Coleridge's close friend Charles Lamb with whom he regularly discussed artistic matter in person and in writing, advised Coleridge against pursuing the poem: '‚ÄúI will enumerate some woeful blemishes, some of ‚Äòem sad deviations from that simplicity which was your aim‚Ä¶‚Äù Notes References * Ashton, Rosemary.

Background In 1915 the American Locomotive Company of Schenectady, New York, built the rail locomotive No. 220, the last coal-burning, ten-wheeler steam engine used on the Central Vermont Railway. Because it possessed a medium-sized 4-6-0 engine (4 leading wheels, 6 driving wheels, and 0 trailing small wheels), the No. 220 served double duty pulling both freight and passenger trains. No. 220 became known as the \\"Locomotive of the Presidents\\", because of its use on special trains carrying Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Dwight D. Eisenhower. The steam engine persisted as the only type of locomotive operating in the United States until the introduction of the electric train in 1895 and, even then, steam engines continued to dominate the rails until the 1950s when diesel came into wide use. The inscription \\"28%\\" on the coal tender indicates that the engine had the potential to lift or drag up to twenty-eight thousand pounds of dead weight. The Central Vermont Railway retired No. 220 from service in 1956 and presented it to the Shelburne Museum for preservation. The museum built the surrounding shed soon afterward to protect the locomotive and the private car (Grand Isle) from the elements.

The hospital was built by Henry Bothin on a thousand-acre parcel of land he had purchased in 1903 along the Northwestern Pacific Railroad near Fairfax, California. Later, a tuberculosis sanitarium was constructed on the same property. A railroad station named Bothin served the hospitals. When Bothin died in 1923, he left behind a charitable foundation to support these facilities and other non- profit organizations. The convalescent home closed in 1940 and the tuberculosis hospital operated until the 1950s. In 1948 the Marin Girl Scouts Council began using part of the property for summer activities.

It is located at 8804 S. Desert in Anthony, Texas, a small town in between El Paso, Texas, and Las Cruces, New Mexico. Park The park usually opens the first weekend in May, and closes after Labor Day. It has over twenty-five rides and attractions. In addition to traditional water rides, the park has a wave pool, a lazy river, shallow kiddie pools, a spray park, and a climbing wall. Amenities include shaded picnic areas with tables, a restaurant, air conditioned VIP Suites for parties, cabana rentals, locker rentals, grill rentals, inner tube rentals, and reserved parking. The mix of attractions, from thrill rides to a spray park for toddlers, is meant to appeal to all age groups with a focus on families. Wet 'N' wild offers free life jackets to kids at the park.

The park does feature a restaurant called The Ribbit Cafe, which offers traditional waterpark fare, such as burgers, fries, nachos, snow cones and funnel cakes, as well as regional specialties, including corn-in-a-cup, papas locas, pi√±a con chamoy, and aguas frescas. Wet ‚ÄòN‚Äô Wild Waterworld is the site of numerous festivals and concerts performed in a raised stage in the middle of the open picnic area. Private sleep-overs, birthday parties, company picnics, and reserved areas can be arranged for groups. History The park opened in 1979 after El Paso businessman and attorney Berry H. Edwards purchased a KOA campground in Anthony. After his son suggested they get a waterslide for the campground's pool, Edwards visited the now closed Wild Wild Wet in Anaheim, California for research. He then installed two Plantation Plastics waterslides (powered by a Chrysler diesel engine connected to a water pump). The park opened as Wet N Wild Waterslides, charging $2.50 per half hour to ride 2 slides, \\"Blue Streak' and \\"Corkscrew.\\" In 1980, after adding the 12 foot deep Volcano Lake, a water zip line, and a few more in-house slides, Edwards changed the name to Wet N Wild Waterworld.

He is most known for his half-hour special on Comedy Central and his roles on FOX's Stacked, TBS's Sullivan & Son and NBC's Three Sisters. Early life  Brian Scolaro was born October 18, 1973 in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn and went to Archbishop Molloy High School in Jamaica, Queens where he appeared as a lead in the school's theatre productions of No Time for Sergeants, Room Service, 12 Angry Men and Arsenic and Old Lace. At the State University of New Paltz, New York, Scolaro wrote, produced and hosted a radio comedy program That Damn Show on WFNP FM for three years and became the hero of neighboring high school kids in the Mid-Hudson Valley. Along with his friend Brett Bisogno, Scolaro wrote, produced and starred in the college's television comedy show Earp and Whitney which was nominated for a National Association of College Broadcaster's award for Best Comedy Program in 1995. After graduating college, Scolaro worked with the mentally handicapped in Brooklyn, and as a brief stint as a production assistant for HBO Downtown Productions, The Comedy Channel (now Comedy Central) and HBO's \\"Reel Sex\\". Scolaro quit his assistant job and turned to stand-up comedy full-time and did his first stand-up show at Stand Up NY in Manhattan on January 14, 1992. He established himself as a stand up comedian in Manhattan at Gotham Comedy Club, Caroline's Comedy Club, Stand Up NY, Dangerfields, Comic Strip Live, Boston Comedy Club, Catch a Rising Star and The Comedy Cellar on Macdougal Street in Greenwich Village. He appeared in Montreal's Just For Laughs Comedy Festival in 1999. His early professional acting career was highlighted by three Wendy's commercials and a guest role on Sidney Lumet's \\"100 Centre St.\\" Career  In 2001, writer Steve Koren (Saturday Night Live, Seinfeld) saw Scolaro at the end of 12-hour video tape collage of actors auditioning for his NBC pilot Everything but the Girl with Tiffani Amber Thiessen. Koren insisted NBC fly Scolaro in to test and he was hired as a regular cast member for the role of love sick, overly sensitive \\"Doug\\". When the pilot was beat to the line-up by Scrubs, Lester Lewis (The Office) brought him to the attention of Eileen Heisler and DeAnn Heline (The Middle) and he immediately moved to Hollywood to be a regular cast member on the second season of NBC's Three Sisters as the bartender named Gordon, love interest of A. J. Langer. In 2003, Scolaro appeared as a regular cast member on a popular ABC pilot by director Tom Shadyack called Platonically Incorrect with Tom Everett Scott. The pilot was penned by Darlene Hunt, Gabe Sax and Jeff Judah and even shot a second episode but still did not get picked up by ABC after a long deliberation. After a holding deal with CBS in 2004, Scolaro was cast as Stuart Miller for Fox's Stacked which starred Pamela Anderson and Christopher Lloyd. Written by Steve Levitan, Stacked was a pilot that was guaranteed to air six episodes in 2005 and the following year aired a full second season. Paul Brownfield from the Los Angeles Times said \\"Scolaro is terrific. An actual sitcom find.\\" During the writer's strike of 2007-2008, Scolaro did stand-up performances on NBC's Late Nite with Conan O'Brien, ABC's Comics Unleashed, and was invited back to the channel that started his career as an intern, Comedy Central, to headline an episode of Live at Gotham. In 2009, he taped his own half-hour special for the network Comedy Central Presents: Brian Scolaro. From 2008 to 2018, Scolaro has had a recurring character of the sad sack, forgetful, Doug, on the first season of TBS's Sullivan and Son, played numerous characters on HBO's The Life and Times of Tim, did stand-up on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and Conan, and appeared on AMC's Mad Men, Showtime's Shameless, TNT's Men of a Certain Age, Showtime's Dexter, ABC's Grey's Anatomy, ABC's A Million Little Things, FOX's Bones, ABC's The Middle, Comedy Central's Kroll Show, Disney's Girl Meets World, NBC's Go On, ABC's Castle, Showtime's I'm Dying Up Here, NBC's Harry's Law, CBS's Superior Donuts, Freeform's Alone Together, ABC's Comics Unleashed, NBC's Truth Be Told, Disney's Crash and Bernstein, the film The Brothers Solomon, as well as commercials for Snapple and Netflix.

In 2013 the Bradford Council removed their funding of the museum. The Friends of Bracken Hall worked to gather support in order to reopen the museum, and whilst the centre was planned to re-open in late 2015, it was finally re- opened to the public in April 2016 with the help of Baildon Town Council.

It is of the traditional rural, symmetrical, four-up, four-down domestic design which was common in the Georgian era and continued throughout the 19th century. This type of house has two rooms each side of the front door, stairs in the middle leading back from the front door, and two upstairs bedrooms each side of the stairwell, with a 19th-century dressing room above the front hall. The walls between front and back rooms are load- bearing, and supported by the two chimneys, which allow fireplaces in all eight main rooms.Google books: Georgian domestic buildings with an eye to symmetry. Bradford City Council has built an extra ground-floor room onto the left hand side, and this contains the museum entrance door and reception. The two original downstairs front rooms are now the Archaeology room and Exhibition room. The public cannot see the two downstairs back rooms, the stairs or the upstairs rooms, which are now accessed from behind the reception desk; therefore the public has access to just a quarter of the original building.

There is also an information board about wasps. Like the bee board, this board explains behaviour and nest structure, but it also mentions the wasp's usefulness in organic pest control.

This room contains displays of archaeological, geological and local history exhibits which are aimed at both adults and children. The museum's prime exhibit, the Heygate stone, is central. The walls have information boards, and there are various other exhibits here.  Heygate stone  This is one of the nationally important Rombalds Moor cup and ring rocks. They were engraved in the neolithic era, and the larger engraved rocks have been left on the moor as it is thought that their meaning may be associated with the landscape. This more portable rock is in the museum for safety: the plough-marks on the rock indicate one of the reasons for this. The Heygate stone is one of the clearest examples of this type of petroglyph. A cast of the engraving reveals that the two larger ring-marks are superimposed on the others.Information from exhibit- labels in the museum. The stone was found in Near Hey Gate Field near Baildon by a local landowner on 25 September 2001, and it is believed that it was originally a rock with a larger area of 5000-year-old petroglyphs that had been quarried nearby in recent history, then dressed on two sides for wall- building. It is at the landowner's wish that the stone is preserved at the museum, as near as possible to its original site, because it cannot now be returned to the position where it lay in the neolithic era.Megalithis Portal: Article from Bradford Telegraph and Argus about the Heygate stone, with further information in following reply. Prehistoric and medieval artefacts display.  Local finds  This glass case contains neolithic and medieval items found in the Baildon Moor area. There is an iron sickle, and a neolithic burial urn found in 1904 on Pennithorne Hill. There is a medieval jug and a lead spindle whorl found on Hope Hill. From the same place are some neolithic arrow heads, thumbscrapers and piercers - all made of knapped flint. There are also Roman coins, one of which was found in Shipley Glen, across the road.Bradford Council report on Rombalds Ridge, mentioning signs of neolithic activity on Baildon Moor.  Quern-stone  Within reach of children, there is an Iron Age beehive quern-stone with removable wooden handle and plenty of grain for grinding. Visitors are invited to look at a drawing of the inner structure of the object, and to try to work out how to grind the corn. When turning the headstone, you can feel how the grain lessens the friction enough for the headstone to turn easily, while the roughness of the stone continues to provide enough friction to grind the corn: a paradox perhaps, but it works. However, to allow entry of grain, the central wooden spindle of a quern-stone is by necessity very loosely fitted through the hole in the headstone, which means that the headstone can move sideways, and young children's fingers must be supervised.Upper Wharfedale Heritage Group: report by John Cruse of a talk on Yorkshire quern-stones survey.British Museum description of a Yorkshire quern-stone.

N. R. Manohar, starring Nandhaa of Mounam Pesiyadhe fame, newcomer Rekha Vedavyas and Kaveri in lead and the likes of Vadivelu, Senthil and renowned music composer M. S. Viswanathan in other supporting roles, whilst Bollywood actress Sarika, ex-wife of Kamal Haasan, making a comeback to Tamil films after 17 years, and music composer Yuvan Shankar Raja, who scored the music for this film as well, make special cameo appearances in the film. Plot The story revolves around two best friends, Meera (Rekha Vedavyas) and Nithya (Kaveri) with contrasting personalities. Meera is an extrovert while Nithya is an introvert. They have been friends since childhood and work in the IT industry in Chennai. They live as roommates and have a group of friends in their apartment. A handsome young man Venkatraman(Nandha), moves into a unit in their apartment and all the young women in the neighborhood are smitten by him, but Meera and Nithya choose to ignore him initially. As time goes on, Meera is attracted to Venkat when he handles some issues in their apartment with his wisdom and good nature. She makes a phone call to appreciate him and eventually, through repetitive phone calls and long telephonic conversations, they become friends and their friendship blossoms into love without meeting in real life. Nithya understands this development with Meera's relationship status as well. Unable to deal with Meera's elusiveness any longer, Venkat plans to meet her face to face for the first time and decides to surprise her by walking to her apartment while she is speaking on the phone with him. But in the last minute, Meera gets distracted by another call on her mobile and thrusts the landline phone into Nithya's hands and walks away to attend it. Venkat walks into the apartment and mistakes Nithya for Meera and forcefully kisses her to express his love and leaves the place. Nithya is shell-shocked and is unable to speak anything for a while. Meera is oblivious to all this because the other call was a family emergency and she leaves soon after, failing to notice what happened to Nithya. Over the next few weeks, Nithya suffers alone at home after falling sick with fever due to shock and refuses to attend further calls from Venkat. He decides to visit her, still under the impression that she was the one speaking to him all this while. When he finds out about the fever, he apologizes for his behavior but doesn't listen to her when she tries to tell him about the mistaken identity. He takes good care of her as she recovers, but Nithya is stricken with guilt at her inability to make him understand the truth. Soon, he shocks her once again by introducing her to his family, friends and colleagues who tell her about his good character and that she is a lucky person to have found Venkat. The same night Venkat proposes to marry her. Nithya is overwhelmed by all the emotions and happiness from the well wishers and is unable to refuse his proposal or reveal the truth. So she decides to play along and accept this new turn of events in her life. When Meera returns from her hometown, Nithya is unable to face her. She asks Meera to forget Venkat saying that he was not serious about her and is just playing around. Meera refuses to believe Nithya's accusations and challenges that Venkat himself will meet her very soon and she will wait for him to do so. Meanwhile, Nithya plants a false impression about Meera to Venkat that she is a possessive friend who is trying to spoil her relationship with him, so he must not believe anything she tells hereafter. Soon, Venkat gets a chance to go abroad for his job and manages to secure a job for Nithya as well. While trying to convey this information and about their upcoming wedding to Nithya, he accidentally meets Meera who thinks that Venkat is back for her and is on cloud nine assuming that he really loves her. To add fuel to the fire, a harmless conversation from Venkat has Meera assuming that the wedding plans are for herself. Nithya is unable to bear the guilt of betraying both her friend and her fianc√© and decides to tell the truth before they marry and leave for the States, but Meera meets with an accident and is critical at the hospital. Nithya confesses everything to an unconscious Meera and swears that she does not want to cheat her and marry Venkat. The day of the wedding arrives and Meera gains consciousness and goes to meet Nithya and Venkat. Nithya is ready to give up Venkat for Meera, but she refuses and forgives Nithya and willingly sacrifices her love for her friend. She says that they deserve each other and asks for Nithya's promise to keep this secret between themselves. Nithya and Venkat get married and a few years later we find that Meera has died as an unmarried woman, still holding the memories of her love for Venkat.

He was the British signatory to the Anglo-Dutch treaty ending the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War in 1783, before serving as a secretary to British embassy in France in 1784-1787, envoy to Poland in 1788-1791, envoy extraordinary to Denmark from 1791, envoy extraordinary to Sweden from 1795. He retired from diplomatic service in 1801. Life During his mission in Warsaw, he followed a policy of Anglo-Prussian understanding at Loo in 1788, seeking to form the Polish Republic, Turkey and Sweden into an alliance against Russia and Austria and backing the reforms of the Great Sejm and the idea of giving Danzig to Prussia. Heavily opposed to the French Revolution, he zealously attempted to calm Denmark's revolutionary leanings during his ambassadorial time there. Ulrik Langen, Revolutionens Skygger - Franske emigranter og andre folk i K√∏benhavn 1789-1814, Lindhardt og Ringhof, 2005. , pages 43ff After the 1794 fire at the Christiansborg Palace, the Danish poet Peter Andreas Heiberg wrote an article which he published in his friend Knud Lyne Rahbek's journal Den Danske Tilskuer (The Danish Spectator) under the pseudonym Simon Sanddrue on 17 March that year. He states that he was an eyewitness to the fire and that, though most of the bystanders did their best to save the palace's contents, \\"two foreigners\\" stood at a distance watching the blaze. One of these foreigners described as a tall gentleman with a jacket and monocle who said in a broken but triumphant voice \\"Had the stupid Danish government spent only half the amount that is lost here tonight in sending a fleet against France, it could have won the war in three years, benefited its own and Europe's cause and still covered its losses\\".Povl Ingerslev-Jensen, P.A. Heiberg. Den danske Beaumarchais, Poul Kristensen, Herning 1974. , page 154. Heiberg added that, due to this audacity, he intended to add this man to his proposed publication of a Rogues' gallery, known in Danish as the Billedgalleri over adelige og uadelige Skurke og Skurkinder. The article mentioned no names, but no one in Copenhagen was in doubt that the monocled man was Hailes, who became angry and took Rahbek to court. However, in court Rahbek stated that he did not know who had written the article and that he had had no part in its writing, with the case thus ending in an acquittal. This result showed the Danish government's inability to control the press and thus further angered Hailes, who refused to meet the Danish foreign minister Andreas Peter Bernstorff for seven weeks after the trial H. Schwanenfl√ºgel, Peter Andreas Heiberg : en biografisk Studie, I.H. Schubothes Boghandel, 1891, pages 323ff \\\\- a serious problem, since Anglo- Danish relations were at this time strained to breaking point due to Denmark's neutrality in the French Revolutionary Wars. Bernstorff was at this time negotiating the release or ransom of several Danish ships seized by Britain on accusations of carrying contraband (Denmark had continued to trade with both Britain and France during the wars), but after the trial Hailes protested that \\"as long as the English government emissary is being insulted in Copenhagen, no one in London can think of releasing the Danish ships\\".

It is the first entry in the Invizimals series, and was bundled with the PSP's camera attachment at launch. Gameplay The gameplay of Invizimals has been compared to the Pok√©mon series, involving players capturing and raising different species of creatures, and allowing the player to battle with them, either against an AI or with others using the PSP's wireless abilities. Unlike Pok√©mon however, Invizimals requires the player to hunt and capture these creatures within the real world, using the concept of augmented reality, a camera attachment for the PlayStation Portable, and a physical \\"trap\\" square-shaped device used as a fiduciary marker. These monsters are spawned at different environments (determined by colors of surfaces and time of day), and the trap is used to capture the monsters. Once captured, players are able to raise and level their monsters, and allow them to learn different attacks that can be used in battle. Players can also use the trap to view their monsters, and take pictures of their collection. Story The story follows Kenichi Nakamura, a researcher at PSP R&D; in Tokyo. He is the Invizimals' discoverer and the player's mentor during the course of the game. Along the way, the player meets Professor Dawson (played by Brian Blessed), who is another mentor for the player. He teaches the player special attacks like VECTORS and SUPERATTACKS. There are enemies you meet during the game. Kaminsky is the person who hacked into the PSP R&D; research labs to steal the Invizimal technology. The player eventually confronts him in a battle near the end of the game. Kaminsky is employed by Sir Sebastian Campbell, a most recognized character in the story who befriended the player, but has his own interests as well. Scope The player will be able to collect 100+ invizimals during the course of the game. Each Invizimal has different attacks, powers, and skills. The player can level up their Invizimals by collecting \\"Watts\\". The higher the level, the stronger the Invizimal. The Invizimal world has 6 different elements: Fire, Water, Earth (rock), Forest (jungle), Ice and Desert. Just like Pok√©mon, each element has different strengths and weaknesses the player needs to discover. Finally, the player needs to collect sparks, orb-like items that can be used to purchase power-ups in game stores. Elementals Elementals are based on the Elements of Invizimals. Fire, Ice, Rock, Ocean, Desert and Jungle. These are some of the most powerful vectors in the game (Meteor Strike is the strongest). Elementals must be used wisely, as they cost 50 sparks each. Here is what they look like and what they do: * Fire: A giant fire ghost comes out of the ground and slaps the opponent, works best with Jungle types. * Ice: A flying eagle-like spirit jumps out of the trap and dives into the enemy, works best with Fire types. * Rock: A giant rock monster climbs out of the ground and punches the opponent, works best with Ice types. * Ocean: A giant water-creature lunges down and squishes Invizimals with its belly, works best with Rock types. * Desert: A giant sand ghost comes out of the trap and turns into a cyclone making other Invizimals lose health, works best with Ocean types. * Jungle: A tree comes out fully grown from an acorn, bites the enemy and transforms back into an acorn, works best with Desert types. * Mutant: Mutated Invizimals which are stronger and harder to find. Throughout the game, the player has to capture Invizimals to move on to the next mission. Each Invizimal has its own attacks which only they can use. Each attack has its own property (see Scope section). Also, each Invizimal has to be captured in a different way, even though some are the same. This can range from flying the Invizimal through a storm, or just scaring it out of its skin. Plus, while the player is \\"powering\\" the trap, the player can find really rare Mutant Invizimals. These can come in different colours and skills compared to their ordinary Invizimal counterparts. Secret Invizimals This game also includes a lot of \\"secret Invizimals\\" which have to be captured by playing on ad-hoc or infrastructure. There are also some Invizimals that can be captured with secret traps only. This can be Invizimals like Tigershark, Venonweb or Moby. These secret Invizimals can be found on the internet on sites like: secretinvizimals.com but there are others too. Awards and reception Invizimals received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The game received numerous awards, among which are: * Special Achievement for Innovation, IGN Best of E3 2009, winner. * Special Achievement for Technological Excellence, IGN Best of E3 2009, winner. * Game of the Show, IGN Best of E3 2009, runner-up, lost to LittleBigPlanet. * Best New Gameplay Mechanic, Kotaku Best of E3 2009, runner-up, lost to Scribblenauts. * Best PSP Game, Kotaku Best of E3 2010, runner-up, lost to God of War: Ghost of Sparta. * Ciutat de Barcelona Award 2009 in the category of Technical Innovation, awarded from the city's Mayor Office to individuals and companies with outstanding contributions to the culture of the city of Barcelona. * El Duende cultural magazine award.

It was revealed at the 2000 Paris Air Show. Development The design had a maximum weight of about 650 tonnes, a payload of about 300 tonnes, the main deck having a 12-abreast seating with three aisles, while the upper deck had 9-abreast seating with two aisles. It was intended to carry 860 to 1000 passengers. Entry would be through conventional fuselage doors or forward and aft ventral escalators. The wing design had winglets and a fold outboard of the outer engine. For comparison the Antonov An-225 has a maximum weight of 640 tonnes and a payload of 250 tonnes. A 1/24 scale model was shownhttp://www.testpilot.ru/russia/sukhoi/kr/860/images/kr860_5.jpghttp://www.testpilot.ru/russia/sukhoi/kr/860/images/kr-860a.jpg at the 1999 Paris Air Show. If built, the aircraft would have been the world's largest, widest, and heaviest airliner. The concept for the aircraft began in the 1990s with a forecast programme cost of US$10 billion (early published figures were US$4‚Äì5.5B) and called for the first aircraft to be built before 2000. With an estimated price per unit of about US$160‚Äì200 million (an earlier published estimate was US$150 million) the market was forecast for a total of 300 aircraft, with production planned for the Kazan Aircraft Production Association facility. Initially designed for the carriage of passengers, later a KR-860T (T stands for Tanker) version was proposed for use as an aerial liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker for far-north regions. Taking advantage of the presence of LNG on the aircraft, the design proposed using LNG to fuel the turbines, rather than conventional jet fuel, like on the Tupolev Tu-206. The project did not proceed beyond the stage of marketing models.

This has the effect of ending the policy coverage on the date of the policy cancellation. Cancellation methods Three different calculation methods are commonly used. Cancellation methods are typically calculated using an online wheel calculator. =Pro rata= A non-penalty method of calculating the return premium of a canceled policy. A return premium factor is calculated by taking the number of days remaining in the policy period divided by the number of total days of the policy. This factor is multiplied by the written premium to arrive with the return premium. =Short Period Rate (old short rate)= A penalty method of calculating the return premium often used when the policy is canceled at the insured's request. It uses a table of factors that results in penalties that can be lower or higher than short rate (90% pro rata) depending upon the date of cancellation. =Short Period Rate (90% pro rata)= A penalty method where the penalty is 10% of the unearned premium. Cancellation date The date a policy's coverage is cancelled prior to the normal expiration date of a policy, often resulting in a return premium owed to the insured. Inception date The date an insurance policy's coverage is started. Also called effective date. Policy term The period of time that an insurance policy provides coverage. Most policies have a one-year term (365 days) but many other policies also have a 6-month term. Policy terms can be for any length of time and can be for a short period when the period of risk is also short. Policy terms can also be for a multi-year period. Return premium When a policy is canceled before its expiration date a return premium may be owed to the insured. The return premium is generally calculated using a wheel calculator. The return premium is calculated by calculating the unearned premium and then subtracting any unpaid premium and penalty for early cancellation. Short rate (old short rate) and short rate (90% pro rata) are penalty methods of calculating the return premium. Earned premium Earned premium is the portion of an insurance written premium which is considered \\"earned\\" by the insurer, based on the part of the policy period that the insurance has been in effect, and during which the insurer has been exposed to loss. For instance, if a 365-day policy with a full premium payment at the beginning of the term has been in effect for 120 days, 120/365 of the premium is considered earned. Earned premium will not be returned to the insured if the policy is cancelled. Unearned premium Unearned premium is the portion for an insurance written premium which is considered \\"unearned\\" by the insurer. It is the written premium less the earned premium. The unearned premium would be returned to the insured if the policy is canceled using pro rata cancellation method, when the policy is cancelled with no penalty. Written premium This is the premium registered on the books of an insurer or a reinsurer at the time a policy is issued and paid for. Cancellation cover for travel insurance Cancellation cover applies if you have booked a trip to take place within the policy period, but you are forced to cancel your travel plans because of one of changes in circumstances, which are beyond your control, and of which you were unaware at the time you booked the trip. Cancellation cover may vary but some typical examples are listed below. * Unforeseen illness, injury or death of you, a close relative or any person with whom you have arranged to travel or stay during the trip. * You abandoning your trip following a delay of more than 12 hours in the departure of your outward flight, sea-crossing or international coach or train journey, forming part of the booked trip‚Äôs itinerary, as a result of strike or industrial action (of which you were unaware at the time you booked the trip), adverse weather conditions, or the mechanical breakdown of, or accident of, the aircraft, sea vessel, coach or train. * You or any person with whom you plan to travel being called up for jury service or being subpoenaed as a witness in a Court of Law (other than in a professional or advisory capacity). If you are made redundant and you qualify for redundancy payment under current legislation. Accidental damage, burglary, flooding or fire affecting your Home, occurring during the trip or within 48 hours before you depart, when a loss relating to your home in excess of a specific monetary amount is involved and your presence is required by the Police in connection with such events. * Your compulsory quarantine.

A possible set of Jacobi coordinates for four-body problem; the Jacobi coordinates are r1, r2, r3 and the center of mass R. See Cornille. In the theory of many-particle systems, Jacobi coordinates often are used to simplify the mathematical formulation. These coordinates are particularly common in treating polyatomic molecules and chemical reactions, and in celestial mechanics. For example, see An algorithm for generating the Jacobi coordinates for N bodies may be based upon binary trees. In words, the algorithm is described as follows: > Let mj and mk be the masses of two bodies that are replaced by a new body of > virtual mass M = mj \\\\+ mk.

Double-file restarts implemented *Starting at this race, restarts in all races were performed in a double-file shootout style. Previously, this had only been a permanent part of the two non-points races on the circuit, the Budweiser Shootout and the Sprint All- Star Race. Following a town hall meeting on May 26 at NASCAR's research and development center in suburban Charlotte, North Carolina, where ideas were exchanged, the racing series made the double-file restart permanent as to Thursday (June 4). The rule was extended later to the Nationwide Series and the Camping World Truck Series later in the year. The race leader selects their choice of lane, with all odd-numbered placed drivers behind him, and the even-numbered cars in the opposite lane. The \\"Lucky Dog\\" rule will be unchanged, but will now be enforced in all laps. Background *Carl Long's suspension and fine were upheld from the Sprint Showdown, meaning Long would miss twelve races, lose both 200 owner and driver points and his crew chief fined a record US $200,000. Long's engine was discovered to be over the required size. Qualifying Because of an all-day rain on June 5, qualification was canceled. As a result, the field was set by the rule book. Failed to make race due to qualifying canceled due to rain: Derrike Cope (#75), Tony Raines (#37), Mike Wallace (#64, was a late entry missing the deadline.) Recap After wrecking his primary car in the first practice Saturday, Tony Stewart was sent to the back of the field as a result of bringing out his back-up car. However, he overcame that and used the old fuel mileage strategy trick (as many races in Long Pond usually do) to become the first owner/driver to win since Ricky Rudd won in September of 1998 at Martinsville Speedway. Geoff Bodine was the last owner driver to win at Pocono Raceway. Kevin Harvick made his 300th start in this race, finishing in 24th position.

He is particularly interested in the potential of online government initiatives to engage the public more fully in actual policy making.http://www.virtualagora.org He is a prominent member of the \\"cyberrealist school,\\" which rejects technological determinism of both the utopian and dystopian kind. He argues that the democratic potential of digital information technologies depends significantly on human agency, although he perceives the structures of power in society as limiting the impact of any specific initiative. See, e.g., Peter M. Shane, Democracy Online: The Prospects for Political Renewal Through the Internet (Routledge, 2004).https://www.amazon.com/dp/0415948657 Madison's Nightmare is the major synthesis of Shane's separation of powers views. It both describes and analyzes the theory and practice of \\"presidentialism\\" as they unfolded from 1981 to 2009. He describes the period of 1981 to 2009 as a time of aggressive presidentialism. Presidents Ronald Reagan through George W. Bush made arguments for unilateral presidential authority that Shane characterizes as unprecedented and legally groundless. These arguments (and the actual assertions of power they supported) went so far beyond the claims of prior presidents as to constitute a new and distinctive phenomenon. Shane's critique, however, goes beyond his attack on presidentialism as legal doctrine. He also argues that presidentialism, as an operating ethos of government, undermines sound decision making and the rule of law in executive branch affairs. He illustrates many of his points through examples from the G. W. Bush administration, but argues that his analysis transcends party. His view is that, for presidents of either party, presidentialism can subvert the quality of decision making, policy makers' attentiveness to law, and democratic accountability more generally. Shane took his degrees at Harvard College and Yale Law School. He was dean of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law from 1994‚Äì1998 and, as a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College, directed the Institute for the Study of Information Technology and Society. He is currently the Jacob E. Davis and Jacob E. Davis II Chair in Law at the Moritz College of Law at The Ohio State University, where he has taught since 2003. He also served Executive Director of the Knight Commission on the Information Needs of Communities in a Democracy. References External links * Peter M.

The first \\"Rowbottom\\" occurred in 1910; the exact details of how the tradition started, and how it got the name Rowbottom, vary. Origin and history Most accounts of how the Rowbottom tradition started involve people calling for the attention of a University of Pennsylvania student named Joseph Tintsman Rowbottom late at night outside his dorm. The calls disturbed his fellow students, causing them to throw miscellaneous objects out their dorm windows. In 1921, the Pennsylvania Gazette reported that Pennsylvania's victory in an intercollegiate basketball championship was celebrated with a \\"time-honored\\" Rowbottom, accompanied by a large bonfire that lighted up the night. Soon the call \\"Hey Rowbottom!\\" or \\"Yea Rowbottom!\\" became embraced as a call to mischief-making by the University of Pennsylvania student body. Once a Rowbottom got underway, automobiles might be overturned, windows smashed, and trolley tracks doused with gasoline and set ablaze. In the 1940s \\"panty raids\\" of the women's dormitories became a prominent feature. Rowbottoms were most frequent in the fall, particularly after football games. By the late 1960s, the University and the police took a firmer stance against Rowbottoms, and 1966 marked the last \\"full-fledged\\" Rowbottom. Attempts to revive the tradition were made throughout the 1970s, with the last recorded event occurring in 1980. By 1994, The Philadelphia Daily News referred to the term as being \\"mired in the ancient world\\". According to University archives, as an alumnus Mr. Rowbottom himself was \\"aghast\\" at his continuing notoriety. A Rowbottom is featured in the novel The Fire Eater.

It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument. It is situated on Priory Green opposite the Tithe Barn and close to the walls of the Priory Church of St George. It is approximately high and in diameter, with walls around thick. There are five hundred and forty nest-holes. There is no documentary evidence for the dovecote's date of construction but it some of the architectural features suggest it may have been as long ago as the 14th century. It would originally have belonged to the Benedictine Priory of Dunster which was a cell of Bath Abbey. Domestic pigeons were kept to provide squabs a luxury food from the breast meat of young pigeons. From the 12th century until 1619, only lords of the manor and parish priests were allowed to keep them. The priory was abolished in the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539, and property belonging to it was sold to the Luttrell family of Dunster Castle. The interior showing the feeding platform, ladder and nest holes In the 18th century the floor level and door were raised among several major alterations. The lower tiers of nest holes were blocked to protect against brown rats which had arrived in the Britain in 1720 and reached Somerset by 1760. A revolving ladder, known as a \\"potence\\", was installed to allow the pigeon keeper to search the nest holes more easily. In the 19th century two feeding platforms were added to the axis of the revolving ladder. When the ladder was installed in the 16th century the base rests on a pin driven into a beam on the floor. The head of the pin sits in a metal cup in the base of the wooden pillar, which means the mechanism has never had to be oiled. When the Dunster Castle estate was sold the dovecote was bought by the Parochial church council and opened to the public. Extensive repairs were undertaken in 1989.

It is one of two major stations in the city, along with , and is one of the four stations located in the city centre, the others being Lanyon Place, and . It is situated near Great Victoria Street, one of Belfast's premier commercial zones, and Sandy Row. It is also in a more central position than Lanyon Place (ironically named Belfast Central until September 2018), with the Europa Hotel, Grand Opera House and The Crown Liquor Saloon all nearby. Great Victoria Street station shares a site with Europa Buscentre, the primary bus station serving Belfast City Centre. History The station is on the site of a former linen mill, beside where Durham Street crossed the Blackstaff River at the Saltwater (now Boyne) Bridge. The Ulster Railway opened the first station on . A new terminal building, probably designed by Ulster Railway engineer John Godwin, was completed in 1848. Godwin later founded the School of Civil Engineering at Queen's College. The station, built directly on Victoria Street, was Belfast's first railway terminus, and as such was called just \\"Belfast\\" until 1852. By this time, two other railway companies had opened termini in Belfast, so the Ulster Railway renamed its terminus \\"Belfast Victoria Street\\" for clarity. In 1855 the Dublin and Belfast Junction Railway was completed, making Victoria Street the terminus for one of the most important main lines in Ireland. The Ulster Railway changed the station name again to \\"Great Victoria Street\\" in 1856, in line with a change of the street name. In 1876 the Ulster Railway became part of the Great Northern Railway (GNR), making Great Victoria Street the terminus for a network that extended south to Dublin and west to Derry and Bundoran. Express passenger traffic to and from Dublin Connolly station was always Great Victoria Street's most prestigious traffic. The GNR upgraded its expresses over the decades and in 1947 introduced the Enterprise non-stop service between the two capitals. As Belfast suburbs grew, commuter traffic also grew in volume. Interior of the original station in 1976. In 1958, the Ulster Transport Authority took over Northern Ireland's bus and rail services. Three years later Great Victoria Street station was modernised, and a bus centre incorporated into the facility. Then in 1968, a large section of the 1848 terminal building was demolished to make way for the development of the Europa Hotel, which opened in 1971. In April 1976 Northern Ireland Railways closed both Great Victoria Street and the terminus of the Bangor line and replaced them both with a new Belfast Central Station, now renamed . The remainder of Great Victoria Street station was demolished. After a feasibility study was commissioned in 1986 it was agreed that a new development on the site, incorporating the reintroduction of the Great Northern Railway, was viable. The Great Northern Tower had already been built on the site of the old station terminus in 1992, and so the second Great Victoria Street Station was built behind the tower block, yards from the site of its predecessor. The new station was opened on 30 September 1995. Railway station Great Victoria Street platforms in 2011. The current station has two island platforms providing a total of four platform faces. Platforms 2 and 3 run the full length of the site and open onto the station's main concourse. Platforms 1 and 4 are half the length and are accessible by walking down the other platforms. Great Victoria Street is the hub of Northern Ireland's suburban rail services, with Bangor line, Derry~Londonderry line, Newry line and Larne Line trains all terminating there. =Service= On Mondays to Saturdays, there are half- hourly services to Bangor or on the Bangor and Portadown Lines, with some Portadown-bound trains continuing on to . There is also a half-hourly service on the Larne Line, with the terminus being every half hour and being the terminus every hour. Derry~Londonderry Line trains operate hourly from Great Victoria Street to . There is a connecting shuttle service from to via the Coleraine-Portrush railway line. On Sundays, the Bangor, Larne, and Portadown Line services all reduce to hourly operation. Derry~Londonderry Line services reduce to two-hourly operation, with only seven trains running each way. Derry~Londonderry Line trains are still hourly but alternate between Londonderry Waterside and Portrush, except for the final train of the evening, which terminates at Coleraine. =Air Link= Railway access from Great Victoria Street at Sydenham links into George Best Belfast City Airport on the line to Bangor. =Future= NI Railways has built a new traincare facility next to Adelaide station for its new Class 4000 diesel multiple units. The opportunity was also taken to improve the infrastructure at Great Victoria Street; the plan to begin with was to reduce the curves by realigning the track, and moving the buffer stops and the route from the platforms to the concourse to the other side of Durham Street. Additionally there were plans to add a fifth platform to the station, which would have culminated in Enterprise services transferring from to Great Victoria Street. However, under Translink's subsequent plan to build a new integrated transport hub, the proposal has expanded to the potential construction of a brand new 6‚Äì8 platform station on the site of the old Grosvenor Road freight depot, close to the existing station, because the existing site is too constrained for any further expansion. Rail and sea connections =Port of Belfast= The Port of Belfast has a Stena Line ferry connecting to Cairnryan for the bus link to Stranraer and onward trains along the Glasgow South Western Line to Glasgow Central. =Port of Larne= The Larne line connects with Larne Harbour with P&O; Ferries sailing to Cairnryan for the bus link to Stranraer and onward trains along the Glasgow South Western Line to Glasgow Central, as well as alternative sailings by P&O; Ferries to Troon also on the Glasgow South Western Line to Glasgow Central. Europa Buscentre Great Victoria Street is part of a major public transport interchange, being adjacent to the Europa Buscentre. This was built in 1991 as the ground floor level of a multi-storey car park. The Buscentre is the Belfast terminus for most Ulsterbus \\"Goldline\\" services in Northern Ireland. These serve various destinations that are not on the railway network, including Enniskillen, Banbridge, Omagh, Downpatrick, Cavan, Newcastle, Strabane and Armagh. Also, services from the Buscentre serve both Belfast City Airport and Belfast International Airport directly.Goldline Timetable Ulsterbus runs joint services with Bus √âireann for its direct express service to Dublin and Dublin Airport, with National Express to Dumfries, Carlisle, Manchester, Birmingham, Milton Keynes and London, and with Citylink to Glasgow and Edinburgh.

In 2001, its location was termed Athens' \\"Hot Corner\\". The Theatre currently operates as a rental facility that hosts a wide range of dramatic, musical, and dance performances as well as special events.  History  The Morton Building was built in 1910 by Monroe Bowers (\\"Pink\\") Morton, a prominent, local, African-American business man. He owned over 30 buildings, the Morton being the largest. At one time the Morton building formed the core of the downtown Black business district. Morton Building that also housed the Morton Theatre, circa 1914 Many of Athens' Black doctors, dentists, and pharmacists practiced in the Morton Building. Among these were Dr. Ida Mae Johnson Hiram, the first Black woman to be licensed to practice medicine (dentistry) in the State, and Dr. William H. Harris, one of the founders of the Georgia State Medical Association of Colored Physicians, Dentists and Druggists. The theatre was opened on May 18, 1910 for vaudeville acts and those of local, regional and national performers. Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith, Louis Armstrong and Ma Rainey performed at the Morton during its heyday. During the 1930s, the theatre was modified to become a movie house. In 1954, a small fire broke out in the projection room. After a fire marshal's inspection, the 500-plus seat theatre was padlocked for failing to offer adequate emergency exits. Various street level businesses continued their operations. In 1980, using a combination of state and federal funds, the building was purchased by the nonprofit Morton Theatre Corporation. Local bands such as Dreams So Real, The B-52's and R.E.M. occasionally used the building for rehearsal space and filming music videos. In 1987, the citizens of Athens-Clarke County came to the rescue of the Morton through the passage of the Special-purpose local- option sales tax referendum that included the rehabilitation of the theatre.

The conflict began in 2001, but subsequently merged with the larger 2003 invasion of Iraq, which led to the defeat of Ansar al-Islam. After the invasion, Ansar al-Islam continued a low level terrorist insurgency against the Kurdish Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Background Ansar al-Islam was formed in September 2001 when Jund al-Islam merged with a splinter group from the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan, under the leadership of Mullah Krekar. According to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the group consisted of Arabs and Iraqi Kurds who had gone to Afghanistan to fight alongside Taliban against the Soviet invasion in the 80s. They came back to Kurdistan after the defeat of the Taliban government in Afghanistan in 2001. Ansar al-Islam imposed Sharia in the villages they controlled around Biyara, close to the border to Iran. Ansar al-Islam's rule Human Rights Watch has accused Ansar al-Islam of committing atrocities against the civilian population in the territory which they controlled. It has been alleged that Ansar al-Islam harshly persecuted the Kaka'i religious minority, and enforced strict Islamic law. Human Rights Watch also accused Ansar al-Islam fighters of torturing prisoners and summarily executing captured PUK soldiers. Assassination attempts An unsuccessful attempt was made on the life of Barham Salih in April 2002 by Ansar al-Islam. At the time, Saleh was the PUK Regional Government Prime Minister. Later in February 2003 Ansar al-Islam assassinated the prominent PUK commander Shawkat Haji Mushir, along with five other people. In March 2004 the US State Department officially classified Ansar al-Islam as a terrorist organization. 2003 Invasion of Iraq During the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, US forces aided the PUK in attacking Ansar al- Islam. In late March 2003, PUK forces supported by American special forces captured Halabja after several days of heavy fighting. The surviving Ansar al- Islam forces fled to Iran. American intelligence personnel inspected the suspected chemical weapons site in Sargat and discovered traces of Ricin in the ruins, as well as potassium chloride. They also discovered chemical weapons suits, atropine nerve gas antidotes, and manuals on manufacturing chemical weapons, lending credence to the idea that the site was related to the manufacture of chemical weapons and poisons.Masters of Chaos, Chapter 13 p. 25-26 After the invasion After their defeat in Iraqi Kurdistan, Ansar al-Islam joined the Iraqi insurgency in Iraq. Several terrorist attacks in the Irbil area have been linked to Ansar al-Islam, including the suicide bombing of the PUK and KDP headquarters in Irbil that killed 117 people. They also carried out the bombing of the Mount Lebanon Hotel in Baghdad on March 17, 2004.

She was renamed Odd I in 1921 and retained that name until 1963 when she became Annstein, except for a period during World War II when she served as a Vorpostenboot for the German Kriegsmarine under the name Orkan. She was condemned in 1971 and was deleted from the Norwegian Ship Register on 15 March 1971. Description The ship was long, with a beam of and a depth of . She was assessed at , . She was powered by a triple expansion steam engine which drive a single screw propeller. It had cylinders of , and diameter by stroke. The engine was rated at 58 nhp. History Dominion II was built in 1912 as yard number 68 by Porsgrund Mekaniske V√¶rksted, Porsgrund for A/S Dominion Whaling Ltd, Sandefjord. She was launched in July. The Code Letters MHSQ were allocated and her port of regisry was Sandefjord. She was operated under the management of T. Dannevig & Co. Sandefjord. In December 1918, she was placed under the management of Chr. Christensen jr. A/S, Sandefjord. In May 1920, Dominion II was transferred to A/S Odd, Sandefjord. She was renamed Odd I in May 1921. In 1922, she was sold to A/S Odd I and placed under the management of I Bryde & L Thorsen, Sandefjord. In September 1925, she was sold to Bryde & Dahls Hvalfangerselskap A/S, Sandefjord. =Antarctic expedition= The Odd I expedition was the first of nine scientific expeditions in the Antarctic fitted out by Lars Christensen. It was led by Eyvind Tofte, with Anton A. Andersson serving as captain. The expedition arrived at Peter I Island on 17 January 1927, but was unable to land. They then circumnavigated the island and discovered Cape Ingrid. They also found and named Cecil Cave, a sea cave which indents the southern part of Cape Ingrid on the west coast of Peter I Island in Antarctica. It was discovered and named by a Norwegian expedition under Eyvind Tofte in January 1927. Tofte and the second mate rowed into the cave in an unsuccessful attempt to land on the island. By 1930, her port of registry had bee changed to Porsgrund. In 1932, she was sold to Thorland Ltd. Her port of registry was changed to London, United Kingdom. She was operated under the management of A/S Thor Dahl. In 1938, she was sold to Ole Telnes, Bergen. Her port of registry was changed to Bergen and the Code Letters LKBK were allocated. A new diesel engine was fitted in 1938. The engine was a two-stroke single cycle single action engine manufactured by M. Haldorsen & S√∂n. It had two cylinders of 451 mm (17 in) bore by 502 mm (19 in) stroke and was rated at 111 nhp. In December 1938, she was sold to Partrederi Odd I, Bergen. =World War II= After the onset of the German occupation of Norway, on 15 June 1940 the occupying authorities acquired Odd I. They then took her into service as a Vorpostenboote in the 51 Vorpostenflotille under the name Orkan. She was allocated the Pennant number V 5103\\\\. This was changed to V 5104 on 1 January 1941 and V 5102 in May 1942.

The Palazzo Bonacolsi, also known as Palazzo Castiglioni, is a 13th-century Gothic-style aristocratic palace located in the center of the town in Piazza Sordello in front of the Ducal Palace in Mantua, region of Lombardy, Italy. History The Bonacolsi family ruled Mantua during the thirteenth century, until on August 16, 1328, when the Rinaldo Bonacolsi was overthrown in a revolt backed by the Ludovico Gonzaga I, who seized power. The Castiglioni had been one of the most prominent Lombard aristocratic families since the 10th century. Most of the members were traditionally based in Milan: the Mantuan branch originated in 1440 from Baldassarre Castiglione the elder, the grandfather of author of the Libro del Cortigiano. Another descendant, also with the name Baldassare bought the palace in 1804.  History  The roofline of the brick palace is topped by Ghibelline battlements. The top floor has mullioned windows. The palace was built in the late thirteenth century by the Pinamonte Bonacolsi on land purchased from Rolandino de Pacis. Pinamonte also bought adjacent palaces and buildings in civitas vetus, including the tower of the cage, symbol of the power of Bonacolsi. The most prestigious palace was left by his father to his second son Bardellone, his successor as leader of the city. Bonacolsi family ruled Mantua during the thirteenth century until, August 16, 1328, the last Bonacolsi, Rinaldo, was overthrown in a revolt backed by Luigi Gonzaga, who also took property of the palace. From 1479 to 1487 was the home town of the Countess of Rodigo Antonia del Balzo, wife of Gianfrancesco Gonzaga, founder of the Gonzaga Sabbioneta and Bozzolo. The building is also part of the mighty tower house, located in the adjacent lane, built by Pinamonte Bonacolsi in 1280 about protection of the buildings owned by the family in the central piazza San Pietro.Turismo Mantua.

It encompasses a spectrum of three clinically overlapping autoinflammatory syndromes including familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS, formerly termed familial cold-induced urticaria), the Muckle‚ÄìWells syndrome (MWS), and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID, also called chronic infantile neurologic cutaneous and articular syndrome or CINCA) that were originally thought to be distinct entities, but in fact share a single genetic mutation and pathogenic pathway, and keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria in which the autoinflammatory symptoms affect only the anterior segment of the eye. Signs and symptoms The syndromes within CAPS overlap clinically, and patients may have features of more than one disorder. In a retrospective cohort of 136 CAPS patients with systemic involvement from 16 countries, the most prevalent clinical features were fever (84% of cases, often with concurrent constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, mood disorders or failure to thrive), skin rash (either urticarial or maculopapular rash; 97% of cases) especially after cold exposure, and musculoskeletal involvement (myalgia, arthralgia, and/or arthritis, or less commonly joint contracture, patellar overgrowth, bone deformity, bone erosion and/or osteolytic lesion; 86% of cases). Less common features included ophthalmological involvement (conjunctivitis and/or uveitis, or less commonly optic nerve atrophy, cataract, glaucoma or impaired vision; 71% of cases), neurosensory hearing loss (42% of cases), neurological involvement (morning headache, papilloedema, and/or meningitis, or less commonly seizure, hydrocephalus or mental retardation; 40% of cases), and AA amyloidosis (4% of cases). In keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria, systemic symptoms are not reported whereas the patients suffer from periodical transient inflammation of the corneal endothelium and stroma, leading to short term blurring of vision and, after repeated attacks, to central corneal stromal opacities in some patients. Age of onset is typically in infancy or early childhood. In 57% of cases, CAPS had a chronic phenotype with symptoms present almost daily, whereas the remaining 43% of patients experienced only acute episodes. Up to 56% of patients reported a family history of CAPS. Previous studies confirm these symptoms, although the exact reported rates vary. Pathogenesis Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes are associated with a gain-of-function missense mutation in exon 3 of NLRP3, the gene encoding cryopyrin, a major component of the interleukin 1 inflammasome. In keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria, the mutation occurs in exon 1. Intracellular formation of the interleukin 1 inflammasome leads to the activation of the potent pro- inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1Œ≤ and interleukin-18 through a cascade involving caspase 1. The IL-1 inflammasome may also be released from activated macrophages, amplifying the cytokine production cascade. The mutation in NLRP3 leads to aberrant formation of this inflammasome and subsequent unregulated production of interleukin 1Œ≤. Up to 170 heterogenous mutations in NLRP3 have been identified. Some reports suggest rare mutations are more frequently associated with a severe phenotype, and some mutations are associated with distinct phenotypes, probably reflecting the differential impact of the mutation on the activity of the inflammasome in the context of individual genetic background. Inheritance of these disorders is autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. Diagnosis Because CAPS is extremely rare and has a broad clinical presentation, it is difficult to diagnose, and a significant delay exists between symptom onset and definitive diagnosis. There are currently no clinical or diagnostic criteria for CAPS based solely on clinical presentation. Instead, diagnosis is made by genetic testing for NLRP3 mutations. Acute phase reactants and white blood cell count are usually persistently elevated, but this is aspecific for CAPS. Treatment Since interleukin 1Œ≤ plays a central role in the pathogenesis of the disease, therapy typically targets this cytokine in the form of monoclonal antibodies (such as canakinumab), binding proteins/traps (such as rilonacept), or interleukin 1 receptor antagonists (such as anakinra). These therapies are generally effective in alleviating symptoms and substantially reducing levels of inflammatory indices. Case reports suggest that thalidomide and the anti- IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab may also be effective. References * Kubota T, Koike R.

It is often published with weather forecasts. Definitions =U.S. National Weather Service= According to the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS), PoP is the probability of exceedance that more than of precipitation will fall in a single spot, averaged over the forecast area. This can be expressed mathematically as : \\\\text{PoP} = C \\\\times A, where C is the confidence that any form of precipitation (e.g., snow or rain) will occur somewhere in the forecast area and A is the percent of the area that will receive measurable precipitation, if it occurs at all. For instance, if there is a 90% probability of rain covering one half of a city, and a 10% probability of rain on the other half of the city, the PoP for the city would be 50%. A 50% chance of a rainstorm covering the entire city would also lead to a PoP of 50%. The PoP measure is meaningless unless it is associated with a period of time. NWS forecasts commonly use PoP defined over 12-hour periods (PoP12), though 6-hour periods (PoP6) and other measures are also published. A \\"daytime\\" PoP12 means from 6 am to 6 pm. The NWS also provides hourly forecasts. The hourly PoP can be similar to the daily PoP and vary little, or it can vary dramatically. For some events such as thunderstorms, the hourly probabilities are statistically independent: the probability of a thunderstorm occurring in a given hour is not related to the probability in some other hour. In that case, there is a simple mathematical relationship between probabilities over shorter and longer periods. For example, if the probability of a thunderstorm each hour is 0.3, then the probability of there not being a thunderstorm is 1-0.3 = 0.7. Over three hours, the probability of no thunderstorm is 0.7 \\\\times 0.7 \\\\times 0.7, which is approximately 0.34. The probability of there being a thunderstorm is 1 - 0.34 = 0.66. An example of an event where the hourly PoPs are not independent is a hurricane. In that case, there may be a 1 in 5 chance of the hurricane hitting a given stretch of coast, but if it does arrive there will be rain for several hours. = Other US forecasters = AccuWeather's definition is based on the probability at the forecast area's official rain gauge. There is also a probability of precipitation for every location in the United States for every minute for the next two hours. This is also known as a minute-cast. The Weather Channel's definition may include precipitation amounts below 0.01 inch (0.254 mm) and includes the chance of precipitation 3 hours before or after the forecast period. This latter change was described as less objective and more consumer- centric. The Weather Channel has an observed wet bias ‚Äì the probability of precipitation is exaggerated in some cases. = Environment Canada = Environment Canada reports a chance of precipitation (COP) that is defined as \\"The chance that measurable precipitation (0.2 mm of rain or 0.2 cm of snow) will fall on any random point of the forecast region during the forecast period.\\" The values are rounded to 10% increments, but are never rounded to 50%. = UK Met Office = The UK's Met Office reports a POP that is rounded to 5% and is based on a minimum threshold of 0.1 mm of precipitation.  Alternative expressions  The probability of precipitation can also be expressed using descriptive terms instead of numerical values. For instance, the NWS might describe a precipitation forecast with terms such as \\"slight chance\\" meaning 20% certainty and \\"scattered\\" meaning 30‚Äì50% areal coverage. The precise meaning of these terms varies.The NWS alone has published other sets of terms, such as those in NOAA Technical Memorandum NWS AR-44 and NWS Instruction 10-503 (p. 18). The UK's Met Office replaced descriptive terms, such as \\"likely\\", with percentage chance of precipitation in November 2011.  Public understanding  Probability of precipitation may be widely misunderstood by the general public. The Plain English Campaign objected to the Met Office's use of the phrase \\"probability of precipitation\\" in 2011. The Met Office explained that the proposed alternative, \\"chance of rain\\", would not describe all the forms of precipitation included in the forecast.

Sai Gork also known as \\"soured Lao sausage\\", which uses cooked Lao sticky rice as an additional ingredient in the filling. The Sai Gork is then allowed to \\"sour\\" or ferment at room temperature for several days.

The mutations result in an abnormal protein that is not secreted, exposing the cells to unopposed interleukin 1 activity. This results in sterile multifocal osteomyelitis, periostitis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the bones), and pustulosis due to skin inflammation from birth. Symptoms and signs Cervical vertebrae DIRA displays a constellation of serious symptoms which include respiratory distress, as well as the following: Cause Those affected with DIRA have inherited (via autosomal recessive manner) mutations in IL1RN, a gene that encodes a protein known as interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, The cytogenetic location of IL1RN is 2q14.1, while its 2:113,099,364-113,134,015 are the genomic coordinates Mechanism Interleukin-1Alpha The mechanism of deficiency of the interleukin-1‚Äìreceptor antagonist affects the normal function of IL1RN gene. The protein produced by IL1RN gene prevents the normal activities of interleukin 1(alpha) and interleukin 1(beta). Therefore, the pathophysiologic immune and inflammatory responses are nullified. Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) has a total of five alleles, of those the (IL1RN*1) and (IL1RN*2) are the most common as the other alleles are seen less than 5 percent. IL-1RN binds to the same cell receptors as the inflammatory protein IL-1, and blocks its inflammatory actions. Without IL-1Ra, the body cannot control systemic inflammation that can be caused by IL-1. Diagnosis Those affected with deficiency of the interleukin-1‚Äìreceptor antagonist can have diagnosis achieved via noting an increase of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, as well as the following: * Genetic test * Radiological findings * Clinical findings Treatment Colchicine In terms of treatment a 2013 review indicates that colchicine can be used for DIRA. Additionally there are several other management options such as anakinra, which blocks naturally occurring IL-1, this according to a 2016 pediatric textbook.subscription required See also * Neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) References Further reading *  External links  * PubMed Category:Autoinflammatory syndromes Category:Rare diseases ","title":"Deficiency of the interleukin-1‚Äìreceptor antagonist"},{"id":"23099279","text":"Tamalpais Valley (known as Big Coyote until 1908) is an unincorporated community in Marin County, California.

During the Sunday drive, there is typically no destination and no rush. Origin The use of the automobile for the Sunday drive began in the 1920s and 1930s. The idea was that the automobile was not used for commuting or errands, but for pleasure. There would be no rush to reach any particular destination. The practice became increasingly popular throughout the 20th century. Parkways were constructed for recreational driving of this sort. Views Traveling on Sunday by automobile is questioned by some Christians, due to observing Sunday Sabbath. While these parties consider the activity \\"leisure\\", they do not count it as \\"rest\\". Stricter Sabbatarians consider leisure activities to be Sabbath breaking, because excluded from the three permitted categories of works of piety, mercy, and necessity.. Less strict Sabbath-keepers consider leisure to be \\"calling Sabbath a delight\\".. This reflects Jewish tradition, in which delighting in the day, spending freely on food, and traveling leisurely (i.e., more aimlessly and unhurriedly, and for shorter distances than one would during the week) were widely considered appropriate for Shabbat.Tractate Shabbat 119a. In many Jewish traditions, driving on Shabbat is prohibited or severely restricted. Henry Ford was an advocate of the Sunday drive. He promoted Sunday as a day of activity rather than rest because it led to the sale of automobiles. Effect of fuel prices During the mid-2000s, as a result of higher gasoline prices, some have curtailed their Sunday drives. But after OPEC started increasing supply to hold market share against North American shale oil producers, oil and gasoline prices dropped to record levels leading some to go driving on Sunday again in the mid-2010s. Environmental awareness has also curtailed Sunday drives.

It was based at 303 West Artesia Blvd, Compton. Its name was derived from taking Nicholas' and Tony's initials and adding an 'X' on the end to form NTX, which when spoken sounds like Entex. Nick Underhill's initial was not included as he had joined the company after the name had already been chosen, but before it opened for business. The company logo consisted of an RAF bullseye with a smiling face in the middle. In 1980, the company achieved sales in excess of $100 million. The company folded in the early eighties, due in part to increasing competition from video game consoles and computer games which quickly became a preferred form of entertainment, much to the cost of the electronic games industry. Products The company originally made model kits and Lego-like connectable toy bricks called Loc Blocs, before later moving into the handheld and tabletop electronic game market. Electronic games produced by Entex have been described as \\"high end\\" and \\"high-quality\\" and the company itself used the motif \\"Games for the discriminating player\\", indicating that the more expensive end of the market was specifically targeted. Many Entex products were rebadged and sold under license outside the US. =Conventional Electronic Games= Entex produced LCD, LED and VFD-based electronic games, including 3-D Grand Prix, Blast It, Defender and Pac Man 2 amongst others.

Personal history Rotherham was born in Coventry in 1869 to Alexander Rotherham of Coundon Hall. He was educated at Uppingham School before being accepted into Trinity College, Cambridge in 1888, gaining a BA in 1891. Rotherham began his medical career at St Thomas' Hospital, London before becoming a house surgeon at Nottingham General Hospital. He later became an Assistant Medical Officer at several asylums; London County Asylum in Purley, Horton Asylum and Manor Asylum in Epsom, before becoming a superintendent at the Dareth mental home in 1911. Arthur was also the cousin of Alan Rotherham, who was the son of Arthur's father's older brother John. In the late nineteenth century and into the twentieth century, players were listed by their initial and surname and the two cousins were often confused with each other. Compounding the confusion is the fact that they had similar backgrounds and playing careers and as Alan's ended so Arthur's began. Both were born in Coventry, both went to Uppingham School, both played for Richmond F.C., both played at half-back and both played for England and went on to captain the national side. Rugby career Rotherham first came to note as a rugby player when he represented Cambridge University, winning two sporting Blues in the Varsity matches of 1890 and 1891. Soon after, Rotherham is recorded as playing for Richmond, then during the 1890/91 season he was picked for the invitational tourists, the Barbarians.Starmer-Smith, Nigel The Barbarians Macdonald & Jane's Publishers (1977) pg. 229 In 1891 Rotherham was selected to join Bill Maclagan's British Isles team on their tour of South Africa. Rotherham played in two Tests, the first at Port Elizabeth, paired at half back with William Wotherspoon and the final test in Cape Town, this time partnered with Howard Marshall. Both Tests resulted in wins for the tourists and saw Rotherham score with conversions in each of his appearances; making him the tour's top Test scorer. Despite the experience he had accumulated as a rugby player, it took until 1898 for Rotherham to be selected for the England national rugby team. Still representing Richmond at club level, Rotherham was selected for the encounter with Scotland in the 1898 Home Nations Championship, which ended in a 3‚Äì3 draw. He kept his place in the third and final game of the Championship, against Wales, and was reselected the next season for all three games of the 1899 Championship. Rotherham was given the England captaincy for the entire 1899 tournament, which resulted in England losing all three matches, the first time this had occurred. Although the critics of the time were hard on the England pack during this season,Griffiths (1987), 1:12. only two players in the backs kept their place throughout the Championship, with four positions seeing a different player every single game.

Guerrilla war With the end of the conventional phase of the war, he formed a powerful guerrilla commando consisting of men from Johannesburg, Krugersdorp, Boksburg and the North and East Transvaal. His success resulted in him attaining the high rank of Assistant Commandant-General (November 1900). Viljoen's exploits included surprising a garrison at Helvetia in the Eastern Transvaal on 29 December 1900 and temporarily capturing 235 men and a 4.7-inch gun.Thomas Pakenham, \\"The Boer War\\", Abacus, Little Brown & Co., (UK), London, 1997, page 493. Capture, imprisonment and war memoirs He was eventually captured at Lydenburg on 25 January 1902 and remained prisoner-of-war until May 1902 at the Broadbottom Camp, on St. Helena. It was there that he wrote his autobiography, \\"My Reminiscences of the Anglo-Boer War\\". The book is a realistic description of the war from a Boer perspective. Unlike other Boer generals he was not a property owner and thus hesitated to return to South Africa. He returned to South Africa as a pauper but refused to take British citizenship, thus greatly reducing his chances of resuming a public career. He was also disillusioned by rumours claiming that he had collaborated with the British, and he felt that his contribution to the struggle was not recognised. Boer Colony in Mexico Ben Viljoen was one of the South African refugee officers who formed a farm colony in Mexico with the assistance of Theodore Roosevelt. Help with selecting and negotiating for the property were provided by two men hired by Roosevelt family friend Marshall Latham Bond and the husband of a Roosevelt relative Edward Reeve Merritt. It was located at Hacienda Humboldt in the municipality of Julimes, Chihuahua.Mexifiles: The Boer Colony in Mexico http://mexfiles.net/2010/03/30/out-of-africa-via-teddy- roosevelt-a-circus-and-francisco-i-madero/ United States and the Boer War Circus He left for the United States in 1904 along with General Piet Cronj√© (of Battle of Paardeberg fame) to take part in the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (St. Louis, Missouri) and the so-called \\"Boer War Circus\\" ‚Äì portrayals of scenes from the Boer War. After leaving the fair, he settled down in the US. He divorced his wife, Lenie (n√©e Els), who did not really want to leave South Africa, when the news reported he was engaged to May Belfort. He later married a US woman, Myrtle Dickerson. Attempts to establish a Boer settlement in the north of Mexico ended in failure. Civic life in New Mexico He returned from Mexico to the US and was instrumental in organising Boer colonies in Do√±a Ana County at Berino, Chamberino and La Mesa in New Mexico Territory. He became involved in civic affairs throughout the Mesilla Valley, and in 1909 he was granted US citizenship. Viljoen became familiar with both President Theodore Roosevelt and New Mexico Governor George Curry. Viljoen was commissioned as a Major in the territorial National Guard's First Regiment of Infantry. In 1911, he travelled to Washington, D.C., with Curry and Albert Bacon Fall as part of a delegation promoting statehood for New Mexico. In April and May 1911, he fought with the Mexican Revolutionary Francisco Madero at the Battle of Ciudad Juarez.Frank McLynn, \\"Villa and Zapata. A History of Mexican Revolution\\", Basic Books, 2000, pg. 95 Viljoen was also influential in agriculture. He introduced new crops and farming practices to the Mesilla Valley. Viljoen was interested in the creation of the Elephant Butte Dam and developed irrigation systems for the valley. For a short while, he was US Consul in Germany, and also acted as military advisor to Francisco Madero until Madero's assassination in 1913. He died in 1917, at his farm in La Mesa and is buried at the Masonic Cemetery in La Mesa, New Mexico. Masonic Cemetery, La Mesa, New Mexico.

ETH Zurich declares it as vision of a university campus and a \\"City district of brainstorming culture\\" which will transform the ETH site into a place with greater quality of life through a variety of measures. It is also declared as a platform that will make it possible for the ETH Zurich to realize future projects that are based on the pioneering and symbolic development of future living and cognitive space.ETH Zurich Science City  Transportation  The tram numbers 11 and 15 to Bucheggplatz, tram 13 alongside the southern area to Frankental as well as the bus line 80 Oerlikon‚ÄìAltstetten‚ÄìTriemli, bus line 38 (H√∂ngg), trolley bus line 46 (City‚ÄìR√ºtihof) and bus line 69 (Milchbuck‚ÄìH√∂nggerberg) run up to different parts of the mountain area. The long K√§ferberg Tunnel runs under a shoulder of the hill, carrying trains, including those of S-Bahn Z√ºrich lines S5, S6, S7 and S16, between Hardbr√ºcke and Oerlikon stations.

After Dr. Lee died, the house was known by the name of his widow, Rose Chang Lee. By the time she died, it was badly in need of repair. Honolulu entrepreneur Rick Ralston, founder of Crazy Shirts, then bought and restored it so successfully that it won the \\"1985 Award for Ground-Up Restoration\\" from local architects. Ralston also installed new plumbing and air-conditioning, and later sold it to a local developer whose children attended nearby Punahou School. In 2006, after they had gone off to college, he put the house on the market for $5.5 million. The name Graystones comes from its exterior walls of 21-inch slabs of hand-cut bluestone, complemented by white latticework and green and white awnings over the large wraparound porch.

Two people were killed and four others were injured before the gunman was fatally shot by an El Al security guard after also being wounded by him. The attack Check- in counters at the Tom Bradley Terminal within LAX, where the incident happened On July 4, 2002 at around 11:30 a.m., a lone gunman approached the El Al ticket counter at the Los Angeles International Airport, pulled out two Glock pistols and started shooting at the 90 passengers standing in the line. Initially, the assailant killed 25-year-old Customer Service Agent Victoria Hen, who was standing behind the counter, with a gunshot to the chest. Later, the assailant opened fire at the passengers as they huddled nearby and killed 46-year-old bystander Yaakov Aminov. In addition, he injured four other bystanders. The terrorist used a .45-caliber handgun in the shooting. In addition, he was armed with a 9 mm handgun, a 6-inch knife, and was also carrying extra magazines and ammunition for both guns. After the gunman fired 10 bullets at the crowd, one of El Al's security guards, who was unarmed, managed to knock him down. Meanwhile, El Al's security officer, Chaim Sapir, ran to the scene but was stabbed by the assailant with a knife. Despite this, Sapir managed to draw his pistol and shoot the gunman in the chest, killing him. The perpetrator Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, (born July 4, 1961) a 41-year-old Egyptian national, was identified as the assailant. He emigrated to the United States in 1992, arriving on a tourist visa but applied for political asylum. His asylum request was denied in 1995 but a letter notifying him was returned by the Post Office as undeliverable and no further efforts appear to have been made to locate and deport him. However, his status was tenuous until 1997, when, shortly before his scheduled deportation, his wife won the Diversity Immigrant Visa lottery enabling both to become legal residents. In Egypt he had been arrested for being a member of Al-Gama'a al- Islamiyya, an Islamist group. He denied the accusation to U.S. immigration authorities. He said he was a member of Assad Eben Furat Mosque Association, a group that aimed to \\"understand truly and apply Islamic law in the 20th century under any circumstances.\\" Hadayet had a green card (through the Diversity Visa Lottery) which allowed him to work as a limousine driver, and to apply for United States citizenship after five years. He was married, and had at least one child. At the time of the shooting, Hadayet was living in Irvine, California. He committed the shooting on his 41st birthday. Aftermath In September 2002, federal investigators concluded that Hadayet hoped to influence U.S. government policy in favor of the Palestinians, and that the incident was a terrorist act.

His expertise is largely in the study of Verbenaceae, Avicenniaceae, Stilbaceae, Dicrastylidaceae, Symphoremaceae, Nyctanthaceae and Eriocaulaceae. Early life Moldenke was the son of Charles E. and Sophia (Heins) Moldenke. His father was a noted Egyptologist whose translation of the hieroglyphics on Cleopatra's Needle he reprinted. Harold was born in Watchung, New Jersey, in 1909, and earned a bachelor's degree from Susquehanna University in 1929. Moldenke's career started at the New York Botanical Garden, a place he maintained a close relationship with (donating many educational materials to its library). There, he worked as a Research Fellow and part-time assistant in 1929. He taught a course in Systematic Botany for gardeners there as well. For 16 years, he worked as the assistant and associate curator under Henry A. Gleason. When Moldenke served in the Civilian Public Service, Soil Conservation Service and as a hospital attendant in Warren, Pennsylvania, he wrote a number of papers on Amazonian curare-producing plants with B.A. Krukoff.

Today, it provides public health care programs including Medicaid, Medicare, and Marketplace. The company is headquartered in Dayton, Ohio. It is the largest Medicaid plan in Ohio and is second in the United States. Its tag line is Healthcare with Heart. In 2019, CareSource earned one of the top spots for quality according to 2019 Ohio Department of Medicaid (ODM) Managed Care Plans Report Card. History CareSource was founded in Dayton, Ohio by a group of concerned community leaders with the goal of expanding health care for underserved populations. The plan was originally called the Dayton Area Health Plan (DAHP) which was incorporated by three hospital CEOs and located its first headquarters in the offices of the Dayton Hospital Association. Pamela Morris became the company's first CEO, and has led the company until her retirement in 2018. DAHP began with a $500,000 grant from the state of Ohio to address a growing issue with the health care problems of low income citizens. Led by Pamela Morris, the company dealt with several regulatory hurdles from 1987 to 1989 from the Ohio Department of Insurance. The DAHP had to raise funds, secure an HMO license and obtain a federal waiver allowing the company to operate solely as a mandatory enrollment plan. The DAHP would become the first mandatory Medicaid managed care program in 1989 In 1993 the federal waiver would expire and in order to allow the organization to continue (rather than maintain a mandatory 75/25 ratio of mandatory and voluntary enrollees) Congressional action would be required. This meant that at that time, 25% of the plan's members could not be on Medicaid or Medicare. It overcame these hurdles when U.S. Congressman Dave Hobson intervened on its behalf to gain an exception for the DAHP. In 1996, the DAHP expanded into the Columbus market with their Medicaid plan by buying the plan United Healthcare was administering. With this expansion, the Dayton Area Health Plan became the largest Medicaid HMO in Ohio. The plan in Columbus kept its previous name, MedPlan. In 1997, the plan acquired Butler Health Plan and gained 6,000 more members in Butler County. During this time, all plans operated by the Dayton Area Health plan kept their regional names. In the year 2000, DAHP consolidated all its health plans under one name ‚Äì CareSource. In this year, the company had about 70,000 members. By 2003 that number exceeded 320,000. In 2004, the organization was ranked the sixth-largest Medicaid managed care plan in the United States by Interstudy. Also in 2004, the company's training program-CareSource University opened to educate employees and keep service standards high. In 2006, desiring to support surrounding non- profits, CareSource established the CareSource Foundation. The Foundation collaborates with non-profits who share in the mission of serving the underserved. It has awarded a total of 693 grants to non-profit organizations so far. In this same year when the economy was down in Dayton, Ohio and major employers like National Cash Register, General Motors, and Delphi closed or left town. In 2007 employment in the area remained weak, but CareSource saw business growth and became the only Medicaid Managed Care provider to offer services in all 88 counties in Ohio. That year CareSource broke ground on its new corporate headquarters in Downtown Dayton, showing the company's commitment to the city it was founded in. The project was the largest urban building development in Ohio at the time. Construction was completed in 2009 on the $55 million corporate headquarters at the corner of Main Street and Monument Avenue in downtown Dayton. The 300,000-square-foot, 9-story building is downtown's first new office tower since before 2000. The building's Architect was BHDP Architecture. By 2010, the company was the third largest Medicaid HMO in the country, with $2.5 billion in revenue and 800,000 members across Ohio and Michigan. In 2010, CareSource announced expansion of its provider network in Southeastern Ohio through a partnership with Quality Care Partners (QCP), a physician-hospital organization (PHO). In 2012, the company announced a partnership with Humana. This partnership worked to serve dual- eligible populations, or individuals who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid in Ohio. In October 2012, the company expanded into Kentucky Medicaid with Humana, where the plan was known as Humana - CareSource. In 2013, CareSource announced that it would move some employees to a second office at 40 West Second Street in Downtown Dayton. 200 employees were relocated to that building, across from the Schuster Center in Dayton while others remained in the headquarters building a few blocks away. CareSource was the third largest company in the Dayton Area in 2013, behind AK Steel and Speedway, ranked by total revenue. From 2011 to 2012, the company's revenue grew 21.43 percent to $3.4 billion. CareSource's percent growth was more than double the average revenue growth of the other 99 largest Dayton companies in that time frame. After the passing of the Affordable Care Act, CareSource created a product which allowed the company to enter the commercial insurance market. In 2013, a report from Ohio Hospital Association states that CareSource is the No. 2 health insurer in the state by premium revenue. In 2014, MyCare Ohio was launched to integrate Medicare and Medicaid benefits. CareSource used this opportunity to create a plan which assimilates both Medicaid and Medicare into one CareSource health plan. The company would also exceed 2,000 employees and occupy the offices in three buildings in downtown Dayton by the end of the year. The company also announced plans to expand into the health insurance marketplaces of Kentucky and Indiana. The constant growth that CareSource experienced with healthcare reform and Medicaid expansion made it the third largest company in the Dayton area again in 2014. CareSource celebrated 25 years as one of the nation's largest Managed Medicaid Plans and the largest in Ohio in 2014. The company then served more than 1 million consumers in Ohio and Kentucky. In late 2014 and early 2015 a new division of CareSource was launched to address the other unmet needs of the company's Ohio Medicaid population. The division, CareSource Life Services, began working with members in the Dayton-area. Through a partnership with Fuyao Glass America, the company was able to set up interviews for 40 members for full-time employment with the manufacturing company. Karin VanZant, the cofounder and executive director of Think Tank, was hired to oversee the program. Under VanZant's leadership, the program grew to address other aspects that contribute to a person's health including their housing and economic stability. This new approach informed the way CareSource began to see its members. In 2016, CareSource began serving members in West Virginia through its health exchange product and was awarded the contract to serve Medicaid populations in Indiana and Georgia, extending the company's geographic reach. The growth in membership was matched by growth in the number of employees. A lease was signed for some employees to move into space on two floors of the Kettering Tower in downtown Dayton to make room for a total of 2,200 employees in the city. To fill the company's long-term need for additional space, CareSource announced in October 2016 that the company would build a new 6-story office building in downtown Dayton. The new building would provide space for 800 employees and create a campus-like environment in the urban core. The new office, named the Pamela Morris Center to honor the legacy of its founder, will be located at First and Jefferson streets and be the first new high-rise in downtown Dayton since the company's headquarters opened in 2008. CareSource passed AK Steel to become the second largest company by revenue in the Dayton- area. In 2017, the company had $8.8 billion in revenue and 4,000 employees. The CareSource Foundation also celebrated its 10th Anniversary in 2016. Over ten years, the Foundation gave more than $14.5 million in grants to over 1,000 different organizations throughout Ohio. In 2016 alone, the CareSource Foundation invested more than $2.8 million in 147 nonprofits to strengthen the network of health and human service organizations. In April 2018, Pamela Morris retired as President and CEO. In May 2018, CareSource named Erhardt Preitauer as CEO. Preitauer was the former CEO of Horizon NJ Health.

In the 1930s a strip of land between Lagunitas Creek and the Sir Francis Drake Highway was subdivided into small lots where city dwellers built weekend cottages. The settlement became known as Jewell because it lay opposite of the Jewell train flagstop. The National Park Service bought the community alongside the creek and removed the few remaining residents.

They used local herbs to heal ailments of people as well as of livestock. These herbs and parts of some other plants were being collected from the Vikos gorge, hence the attribution. They were descendants of an ancient craft who in the Ottoman period attained great fame. Some even served as advisors in the courts of the Ottoman Sultans. One named Paschaloglou from Kapesovo even became a confidente of four Sultans: Abdul Hamit I, Suleiman III, Mustafa IV and Mahmut II. One of the herbs used was the nightshade Atropa belladonna for cholicspasms. The drug atropine has been extracted from this plant which is medicinally used for this purpose to our own day.

It was the first novel in publishing history to be sold in digital form by Scribd, the document sharing website. The Sower premiered on May 18, 2009 in conjunction with the launch of the company's book selling division, Scribd Store. The author's decision to break with tradition and offer a first release of a new novel as a digital book received international media attention, including coverage in The New York Times, The Times of London, The Los Angeles Times, and on National Public Radio. The media coverage led to offers to create a printed version. On August 31, 2009 Numina Press published the first hardcover edition, which instantly hit the San Francisco Chronicle's bestsellers list, premiering at #5 for that week. The Sower is a darkly comic novel that tells the story of a California oil worker who becomes the sole carrier of a manmade virus that appears to cure all diseases. But the only way this cure is passed to others is through sex. Large forces conspire to prevent this from happening by plotting to control or destroy the virus and its host. Written as a pastiche of the thriller novel genre, the storyline employs international intrigue that takes the plot around the world to exotic locations, including the San Francisco underground, the catacombs of Paris, a yacht on the Amazon river, the Vatican in Rome, and a bedroom in the U.S. presidential retreat Camp David. Villains in the story include highly fictionalized parodies of controversial evangelical minister Rev. Rick Warren, pop star Madonna, and president George W. Bush. In October 2010, a second digital edition of was released: The Sower 2.0. Debuting exclusively on Scribd, the new version was reimagined by the author and updated with topical references for late 2010. Considered the first version 2.0 of a novel, the second digital edition was also used reading technology from Apture to allow readers to get information on words and phrases in the novel via pop-up screens. On November 15, 2010, a digital edition of The Sower 2.0 became available for Amazon's Kindle. Biblical Reference The Sower derives its title from the Parable of the Sower, a story told by Jesus Christ in The Bible, found in gospels Matthew, Mark, Luke, and Thomas. In the parable, a sower dropped seed on the path, on rocky ground, and among thorns, and the seed was lost; but when seed fell on good earth, it grew, yielding thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold. Plot summary Oil worker Bill Soileau is a reckless hedonist based in San Francisco and well acquainted with the city's notorious sexual underground. He long ago contracted HIV but seems unconcerned about exposing his partners. On assignment at what appears to be an oil refinery abandoned by Soviet occupiers in a remote part of modern-day Armenia, Soileau meet Dr. Quif Melikian. She's conducting a health safety inspection of the plant and has discovered a hidden laboratory. An accident in the mysterious lab infects Bill with a manmade virus, later identified as a mutated form of phage. It instantly cures Bill's HIV, unbeknownst to anyone. Eventually the doctor and oil worker discover the existence of the phage and learn it's a type of miraculous retrovirus that rewrites diseased cells back to their original configurations, a potential cure for all diseases. The two also learn the phage cure can only be passed to others via sex. This sets in motion a plot to destroy or control the phage and Bill Soileau. Major Themes In an age where victims of AIDS and HIV continue to face moral condemnation, The Sower twists the notion that morality can be assigned to a disease. In the case of the phage virus, the disease becomes a cure and promiscuous unsafe sex has the potential to save millions of lives. But ‚Äúlove conquers all‚Äù is not so easily executed. Dearly held American values are put in peril by the idea of sex as a cure. The protagonist is an anti hero. He's a member of a suspect sexual underclass, a Southerner with racist tendencies, and an unrepentant cheerleader for the business of big oil companies. This makes him an outcast on some level with most political, social and religious ideals, and yet fate has chosen him to be the possible savior of all mankind. The issue of genocide emerges throughout the novel. Dr. Melikian is a descendant of the Diaspora that fled the Armenian Holocaust. The Roman Catholic Church's opposition to distributing condoms and safe sex information to people infected with AIDS in Africa is equated to genocide, as are efforts to destroy the phage before it can be used to heal the sick. ‚ÄúPariahs become saints, disease becomes a cure, the cursed become the chosen people, and promiscuous sex a moral duty. In the end, a moral leper shows us what is right, humane, and true,‚Äù said novelist Joe Quirk, author of The Ultimate Rush and Exult, in his endorsement of The Sower. ‚ÄúDark, subversive, and laugh-out- loud funny,‚Äù said Raj Patel, author of international bestseller Stuffed and Starved.

This photograph shows foam on the New River as it enters the United States from Mexico. Environmental issues are harmful effects of human activity on the biophysical environment. Environmental protection is a practice of protecting the natural environment on the individual, organizational or governmental levels, for the benefit of both the environment and humans. Environmentalism, a social and environmental movement, addresses environmental issues through advocacy, education and activism.Eccleston, Charles H. (2010). Global Environmental Policy: Concepts, Principles, and Practice. Chapter 7. . The carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere has already exceeded 400 parts per million (NOAA) (with total \\"long-term\\" GHG exceeding 455 parts per million) (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Report). The amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is possibly above the threshold that can potentially cause climate change. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has stated \\"Climate change is not just a distant future threat. It is the main driver behind rising humanitarian needs and we are seeing its impact. The number of people affected and the damages inflicted by extreme weather has been unprecedented.\\" Further, OCHA has stated: * Climate disasters are on the rise. Around 70 percent of disasters are now climate-related ‚Äì up from around 50 percent from two decades ago. * These disasters take a heavier human toll and come with a higher price tag. In the last decade, 2.4 billion people were affected by climate-related disasters, compared to 1.7 billion in the previous decade. The cost of responding to disasters has risen tenfold between 1992 and 2008. * Destructive sudden heavy rains, intense tropical storms, repeated flooding, and droughts are likely to increase, as will the vulnerability of local communities in the absence of strong concerted action. Environment destruction caused by humans is a global, ongoing problem. By the year 2050, the global human population is expected to grow by 2 billion people, thereby reaching a level of 9.6 billion people. The human effects on Earth can be seen in many different ways. A main effect, is an increase in global temperature. According to the report ‚ÄùOur Changing Climate‚Äù, the global warming that has been going on for the past 50 years is primarily due to human activities.Walsh, et al. 20 Since 1895, the average temperature in the United States has increased by between 1.3¬∞F and 1.9¬∞F, with most of the increase taking place since around 1970. Types Major current environmental issues may include climate change, pollution, environmental degradation, and resource depletion. The conservation movement lobbies for protection of endangered species and protection of any ecologically valuable natural areas, genetically modified foods and global warming. Scientific grounding The level of understanding of Earth has increased markedly in recent times through science especially with the application of the scientific method. Environmental science is now a multi- disciplinary academic study taught and researched at many universities. This is used as a basis for addressing environmental issues. Large amounts of data have been gathered and these are collated into reports, of which a common type is the State of the Environment publications. A recent major report was the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, with input from 1200 scientists and released in 2005, which showed the high level of impact that humans are having on ecosystem services. Organizations Environmental issues are addressed at a regional, national or international level by government organizations. The largest international agency, set up in 1972, is the United Nations Environment Programme. The International Union for Conservation of Nature brings together 83 states, 108 government agencies, 766 Non-governmental organizations and 81 international organizations and about 10,000 experts, scientists from countries around the world. International non-governmental organizations include Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and World Wide Fund for Nature. Governments enact environmental policy and enforce environmental law and this is done to differing degrees around the world.  Costs  Solutions Sustainability is the key to prevent or reduce the effect of environmental issues. There is now clear scientific evidence that humanity is living unsustainably, and that an unprecedented collective effort is needed to return human use of natural resources to within sustainable limits.Gismondi, M.

Retrieved on: 2009-03-10 For humans to live sustainably, the Earth's natural resources must be used at a rate at which they can be replenished (and by limiting global warming). This condition is measured by ecological footprint accounting. Concerns for the environment have prompted the formation of green parties, political parties that seek to address environmental issues. Initially, these were formed in Australia, New Zealand, and Germany but are now present in many other countries. Film and television There are an increasing number of films being produced on environmental issues, especially on climate change and global warming. Al Gore's 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth gained commercial success and a high media profile.

In 1850 Pablo de la Guerra sold his undivided share of the ranch to Henry Wager Halleck. Halleck had arrived in California in 1847 as a lieutenant in the United States Engineers, accompanied by his friend, Lt. William Tecumseh Sherman. Halleck was a partner in the San Francisco law firm, Halleck, Peachy & Billings, and in the Civil War was promoted by President Abraham Lincoln to general-in-chief of the armies of the United States. Halleck hunted and fished at Rancho Nicasio, and built a house on the creek near Nicasio, now called Halleck Creek. In 1850, Cooper sold his undivided share of the ranch to Benjamin Rush Buckelew. Besides Cooper‚Äôs share of Rancho Nicasio, Buckelew also purchased Cooper‚Äôs Rancho Punta de Quentin and John Reed‚Äôs Rancho Corte Madera del Presidio. In 1851, O‚ÄôFarrell sold his share to James Black, the grantee of Rancho Ca√±ada de Jonive. In 1852 Buckelew sold to William Reynolds and Daniel Frink. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored.

The board consists of four founding members, none of whom take a salary for their contributions. History ANDC was founded in 2006 by Bill Smith, the team photographer for the Chicago Bears, Chicago Blackhawks, Chicago Bulls and United Center. During the sporting offseason, Smith and his wife Lauren would take annual trips to Southeast Asia to photograph the changing culture and landscape. In 2002, Smith was taken to the Stung Mean Chey garbage dump by his Cambodian driver, and was stunned to see the conditions that children were living in. Children were forced to live and work in the garbage dump to provide for their families. The children, in addition to living and working in the squalor, were unable to attend school because their families needed the $10‚Äì12 a month that was provided by the children working in the dump. Smith began to support several children that worked in these garbage dumps, enrolling the children in school and paying the families the lost monthly income, ensuring the children would never work another day in the dump. The Smiths told their stories to family and friends, who began giving money to Smith to support additional children. In 2006, a front page article ran in the Chicago Tribune about the Smiths' work in Cambodia. After an overwhelming response of donations, Bill Smith founded A New Day Cambodia. The charity now has two dormitories in Phnom Penh housing 99 children. The children attend English and Khmer language schooling in a day, and live at the center. All children attend private schools, with some of the most gifted students attending the most prestigious schools in Cambodia. The cost of education, activities, room and board is approximately $1800 per child each year. In 2010, Comcast SportsNet Chicago aired a 30-minute special on ANDC and the Smiths' journey to found the centers. The entire show is available online.

ESF members engage in service-oriented activities in communities typically opposed to LGBT rights. ESF programs include neighborhood revitalization, housing builds, canned food drives, and environmental cleanup; causes which allow for both sides to work together in what ESF calls a \\"positive environment.\\" The programs take place in under-served areas or those conservative in nature as these are the people ESF is attempting to influence. Additionally, ESF is a visible entity in U.S. politics. =History and leadership= The Empowering Spirits Foundation was established by A. Latham Staples in 2008 after the passage of Proposition 8 in California out of frustration as to how he thought LGBT rights organizations were approaching the gay rights issue. Staples said, \\"The day after the passage of Proposition 8, various gay rights organizations attacked Christians, the LDS Church, and minority groups. In my mind, this intolerance only amplified the hate, it didn't create change,\\". Staples, a long time activist, was laughed at when he suggested to one of those organizations that the LGBT community should foster dialogue with such groups instead of attacking them. Four days, later ESF was established. On March 4, 2013, ESF announced Staples had stepped down as president of the organization as he had accepted the position of chief executive officer at PremloCare, Inc. (later renamed EXUSMED, Inc.), a healthcare company based in San Diego. He remains the chairman of ESF. Today, ESF is headed by Lisa Kove, current president of the foundation and Executive Director of the Department of Defense Federal Globe. Events ESF volunteers build a new trail in the Gonzalez Canyon in San Diego, California. Empowering Spirits Foundation members engage in service-oriented activities in communities throughout the nation. These events range from small events at nursing homes and food banks, neighborhood clean-up endeavors, and neighborhood restoration projects, to participation in large citywide rallies. =Proud Hearts Reach Out= The Empowering Spirits Foundation held its first annual nationwide service- oriented event to promote LGBT rights called ‚ÄúProud Hearts Reach Out‚Äù in conjunction with National Coming Out Day October 9, 2009. The nationwide event was created in response to the California Supreme Court decision to uphold Proposition 8. Roughly 5,000 volunteers attended the ESF service events held across 36 states, in partnership with Habitat for Humanity, MyOutSpirit.com, the American Cancer Society, and the Lymphoma and Leukemia Society. =National Equality Rally= The Empowering Spirits Foundation, along with other LGBT organizations, co-organized the National Equality Rally which took place from April 27 through May 3, 2009 in Philadelphia, PA. The rally featured a series of cultural programs, panels, parties and outdoor events, and a tribute to San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom who is a proponent of gay rights. National recognition =Echoing Green= Echoing Green, an angel investor in social entrepreneurial organizations, announced it would fund ESF for two years. ESF was the only grantee selected from the category of \\"Civil & Human Rights\\" when Staples was named a 2010 Echoing Green fellow for ‚Äúenacting innovative solutions that address root causes to social problems.‚Äù Controversy =Catholic Diocese of Portland, Maine= In May 2009, the Empowering Spirits Foundation filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service to seek revocation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland‚Äôs tax exempt status. This complaint was filed after Mark Mutty, the Diocese‚Äôs public affairs director, announced plans for the church to gather 55,087 signatures needed for a state referendum on same-sex marriage, in an attempt to overturn Maine‚Äôs new same-sex marriage law. Mutty is quoted as calling the church‚Äôs action ‚Äúone of the biggest grassroots movements in Maine history.‚Äù Erik Stanley, senior counsel for the Alliance Defense Fund, responding on behalf of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland, stated in a letter to ESF that the IRS allows tax-exempt organizations to \\"engage in lobbying activities, including advocating a position on a public referendum, without violating their tax- exempt status so long as the activity is not a substantial activity of the organization.\\" References External links * Empowering Spirits Foundation ‚Äî official website Category:History of LGBT civil rights in the United States Category:LGBT political advocacy groups in the United States Category:LGBT law in the United States Category:Same-sex marriage in the United States Category:Discrimination in the United States Category:Charities based in California Category:LGBT charities ","title":"Empowering Spirits Foundation"},{"id":"23100014","text":"Mailliard may refer to: *Charlotte Mailliard Shultz (born 1933), American heiress and socialite *William S.

Early life Amos was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1937 to India DeLaine Amos and Miles Green Amos. Amos took an interest in art at an early age, creating \\"masses of paper dolls\\" and learning figure drawing from issues of Esquire and the art of Alberto Vargas, was painting the figure by the age of nine. Her mother had aspirations of Amos studying with Hale Woodruff, but he did not accept many private students and left the area before she had the opportunity to study with him. At eleven, Amos took a course at Morris Brown College, where she worked on her draftsmanship and took note of the work that African American college students were producing at the time. By high school, Amos was submitting her work to Atlanta University art shows. She graduated from Booker T. Washington High School in Atlanta at the age of 16, and applied to Antioch College, because of their progressive policies. Her father exposed her to black intelligentsia; Zora Neale Hurston frequently visited and W.E.B. Du Bois once called on the family.  Education  Amos studied at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, at the Central School of Art and Design in London and at New York University. While at Antioch, Amos worked for half of the year, and studied for the remainder. She worked in Chicago, New York, and in Washington, D.C., which enabled her to visit galleries and museums, which had been less accessible in Atlanta. Her fourth year at Antioch, she went to England and studied at the London Central School of Art, where she learned to print and etch under Anthony Harrison, and began to paint with oils, which she had not done before. Amos received her BFA degree from Antioch in 1958, then went back to London for her degree in etching, which she received in 1959 after two years of study.The following year Amos moved to New York City to start working with two printmaking studios. Later on she received her MA at New York University (NYU). Career Amos moved to New York City after feeling stunted by the slow move of the Atlanta art scene. Amos was not expecting the level of racism, sexism, and ageism that she encountered upon moving to New York. Galleries would not accept her under the premise that she was too young to show, and studio teaching jobs rejected her on the grounds that, \\"We're not hiring right now\\".Amos was told by both Cooper Union and the Art Students League that they were not hiring after she applied for a teaching position.Farrington, Lisa E. \\"Emma Amos: Art as Legacy.\\" Woman‚Äôs ArtJournal 28, no. 1 (2007): 3-11. The difficulty of entering work into galleries led her to teach as an assistant at the Dalton School where she met artists and was introduced to the New York and East Hampton art scene, where she experienced difficulty showing her work in a \\"man‚Äôs scene.\\" It was also around this time that Emma Amos began her career as a textile designer, working for the weaver and colorist Dorothy Liebes, where her designs were translated into unique carpets. In New York, Amos joined the printmaking studios of Letterio Calapai (a part of Stanley William Hayter's Paris Atelier 17) and Robert Blackburn's Printmaking Workshop. Despite the difficulty African Americans face in entering the art scene, as there is often a lack of access to dealers and curators, Amos persevered and received her M.A. from New York University in 1966. While at NYU, she became reacquainted with Hale Woodruff, who was a professor there at the time. At the age of 23, Amos had a meeting with Woodruff for a critique of her prints, and he told her about Spiral. The group was a collective of approximately fifteen prominent African American artists, founded in 1963 by Romare Bearden, Charles Alston, Norman Lewis, and Hale Woodruff. The group was interested in discussions of N√©gritude, a philosophy born out of opposition to French colonialism and centered around encouraging a common racial identity for black Africans around the world. Spiral was formed out of the Works Progress Administration and the Harlem Renaissance. Woodruff took some of her work to one of their meetings at their rented storefront, and the members of the group liked her work enough to invite her to join as their first and only female member. Amos thought it strange that no other women artists were asked to join the group, even though they were acquainted with the members of Spiral. Amos felt that joining Spiral would be useful because she did not know many artists in New York at the time. Amos worked full-time as a designer during the day, and studied full-time in the evenings, and made time to paint on the weekends. In May 1965, Spiral rented a gallery space at 147 Christopher Street, where the group had their first and only exhibit. Amos displayed an etching entitled Without a Feather Boa, which has since been lost. This etching was a nude self-portrait bust that depicted Amos \\"staring indifferently at the viewer from behind a pair of dark sunglasses.\\" Prior to Spiral, Amos was resistant towards the idea of \\"black art\\" and galleries that only showed work by African Americans, but she came to understand that these were often the only options available to black artists at the time, and also learned how to integrate race and sex politics into her work without her work becoming dominated by the process of political engagement. Spiral stopped meeting shortly after 1965, when rising rent prices lost them their gallery and meeting space on the Lower East Side. During the 1970s, Amos went on to teach textile design at the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Arts, weaving on her own looms at Threadbare, a yarn and weaving shop on Bleecker Street and thrived as a weaver due to the propagation of weaving and fabric art within the Feminist Art Movement. Amos originated and co-hosted Show of Hands, a crafts show for WGBH-TV in Boston in 1977-79, and later became a Professor at the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University.Patton, Sharon F. \\"Emma Amos: Thinking Paint\\" catalogue notes, Oxford University Press, 1998. Print. Style Amos combined printmaking, painting and textile in her self-referential works, usually on linen, large scale, and unframed. She used acrylic paint, etching, silkscreen, collagraph, photo transfer effects with iron-on fabric, and African textiles. She borrowed schema, subject matter and symbols from European art while pictorially quoting artists like Paul Gauguin, Malcolm Morley, Lucian Freud, and Henri Matisse. Amos demonstrated the deconstructive license of postmodernist works in her use of applications from several disciplines on the same picture plane, making a \\"seamless work of art.\\" As well as bordering her paintings with African fabric, Amos sewed, appliqued, embroidered and occasionally quilted with her own weavings, Kente cloth and batiks. The scale and textural layering of the work resembles forms often found in European prestige tapestries and the African diaspora. Art museum director, Sharon Patton, summarizes her oeuvre thus: > [Amos's] sequence of paintings is anecdotal, but the objective of each is > the same: to argue constructively against norms in the field of art as well > as society. Her responses are reactive and reflexive; she ably uses her > paintings as a means to analyze and assess cultural production, authorship, > meaning and consumption. Amos is quintessentially postmodern because she > questions the validity of canonical traditions and institutions that for so > long have been biased against the inclusion of women and artists of color, > especially blacks. Among the variety of mixed media that Amos uses in her work, the main subject is often figurative. Unlike many figurative artists Amos did not like to paint the nude figure. She liked painting clothed figures because she believed that painting the nude figure is sexist, and that clothing shows culture. During her time at Central School of Art, Amos studied abstract painting, and produced some Abstract Expressionist work for a period. After a while she deemed abstraction too easy and arbitrary, so she returned to painting the figure because it was more challenging. This influence remakned present in her figurative work. Amos used her art to explore themes of race and sex, contending that the very act of being black while an artist is political in nature. She cited well-known White, male artists, such as Picasso and Gauguin, who were praised for including subjects of color into their work, while African American artists were seemingly expected to paint other subjects of color. Amos incorporated white subjects into her art, particularly images of the Ku Klux Klan, challenging this assumption.Weathers, Diane, Essence. Emma Amos: \`Painting white'. Sep 1994, Vol 25. Issue 5.  Feminism  Amos admitted that being from the South, as an African American woman, she had always been aware of the adversities she faced in her everyday life. However, in relation to Feminism, Amos did not become actively involved until the late 1980s.Thompson, Mildred. \\"Interview: Emma Amos.\\" Art Papers 19 (1999): 21-23. Print. Before this time, in the early 1970s, while raising children, Amos was invited to join a Feminist Group of artists that met in New York City parks. When choosing whether or not to attend, Amos stated, \\"From what I heard of feminist discussions in the park, the experiences of black women of any class were left out. I came from a line of working women who were not only mothers, but breadwinners, cultured, educated, and who had been treated as equals by their black husbands. I felt I could not afford to spend precious time away from studio and family to listen to stories so far removed from my own.\\" It was not until the early 1980s, after she began teaching at Mason Gross of Arts at Rutgers University in New Jersey where she decided to participate in the feminist group Heresies. Within this group, women worked together, from all backgrounds, to publish pieces of artwork and writing of unknown women artists, published in a series of magazines and discussions. When speaking on the group, she declared, \\"And that‚Äôs what Heresies became for me. All of my disdain for white feminists disappeared, because we were all in the same boat. We just came to the boat from different spaces.\\"The Heretics. Dir. Joan Braderman. Prod. Crescent Diamond. No More Nice Girls Productions, 2009. Web. For numerous years, Amos also attended meetings with the group, Fantastic Women in the Arts. This group also explored the artwork and writings of many female artists, but also focused on how the revolution in the 1960s and 1970s, concerning education on racism and sexism, failed to actually make any difference for black Americans or women. It is in this group that Amos discussed the privilege of white Americans, and how that was evident in the arts in everyday life. Amos stayed active in her involvement in these issues and providing education to younger generations, however, keeping groups going seemed to her to be the hardest challenge. Amos felt that \\"artists who are not white, young, and straight, and who are openly political, and feminist, seem to still be on the margins. [She] hope[s] we all will see more change soon.\\" Death Amos died of complications of Alzheimer's disease on May 20, 2020 at the age of 83. Further reading * *Spears, Melanie J.

He gained a certain notoriety in the Affair of Fielding and Bylandt of 1779 and even more in consequence of the refusal of the Dutch navy to put out to sea to combine with the French fleet in Brest in 1783, during the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, for which refusal many held him responsible. He was court-martialed and exonerated in the first case, and in the second case an inquiry into his conduct was long delayed and eventually quietly abandoned after stadtholder William V had prevailed against the Patriots in 1787. This made his promotion to lieutenant-admiral (the highest rank in the Dutch navy, as that of General Admiral could only be held by the stadtholder) possible. He died in office as inspector-general and commander of the gunners corps of the navy of the Dutch Republic. Family life Van Bylandt was the son of Ludwig Roeleman, Imperial Count of Bylandt-Halt (a cadet branch of the House of Bylandt), a Prussian high official, and Christina Maria Louisa Freiin (baroness) von Heyden - Broeck. He never married.Molhuysen, pp. 383, 386 He was a relative of several other high officers in the army and navy of the Dutch Republic and Kingdom of the Netherlands, among whom Willem Frederik van Bylandt, who commanded a brigade at the Battle of Waterloo. Career Van Bylandt entered the Dutch navy as an adelborst (midshipman) in 1736 in which year he sailed on a cruise to Cura√ßao. He attained the rank of captain in 1747. In 1756 he was captain of West Stellingwerff and in 1768 of Thetis with which he took part in expeditions against the Barbary corsairs in those years. In 1775 Van Bylandt was acting- commander of a Dutch naval expedition (with the rank of rear-admiral) against Morocco. This expedition was successful in its object to force Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah to sue for peace.Molhuysen, p. 384 After the start of the American Revolution Dutch merchants became heavily involved in trade with the new American Republic. The Dutch West India Company had an entrep√¥t in its colony of St. Eustatius where American merchants came to trade in colonial wares like tobacco and indigo (which had hitherto been prohibited to them under the British Navigation Acts). Dutch and French merchants imported guns and munitions, and also naval stores to St. Eustatius, which were then re- exported to the rebellious American colonies. The British considered such trade \\"illegal\\" and tried to hinder it by enforcing a trade embargo with the help of British privateers, which were a real encumbance to American merchantmen that visited the island, and also to Dutch, French and other neutral shipping (France was at this time not yet at war with Great Britain).Edler, pp. 42-62 To suppress this privateer activity the Dutch government sent a Dutch naval squadron under Van Bylandt to the West Indies. He remained there a year and was successful in keeping the privateers at bay.Molhuysen, p. 384 (Note that at this time the Dutch Republic was still neutral and was just defending its rights as such). After France and Spain became involved in the War of the American Revolution in 1778 Dutch merchants also were heavily involved in trade with these belligerents in goods that the British considered contraband, but that fell outside the narrow definition of that concept in the Anglo-Dutch Commercial Treaty of 1668. This treaty guaranteed Dutch shipping a privileged status and exempted it from trade embargoes enforced by the British Royal Navy as far as non-contraband goods were concerned. A diplomatic conflict between Great Britain now ensued about the interpretation of this treaty and of the definition of \\"contraband\\" under it. The British tried to declare naval stores, like ship's timbers, spars, masts, rope, tar and pitch \\"contraband,\\" against which the Dutch maintained the narrow definition of the treaty as only \\"arms and munitions.\\" The trade in naval stores was important to France, as her naval construction depended on it. France therefore strongly opposed the tendency of the pro-British Dutch government of stadtholder William V to give in to the British demands and insisted on the Dutch \\"defending their treaty rights\\" to the point of selectively using economic sanctions against Dutch cities that supported the stadtholder's policy on this point. In November 1779 the States-General of the Netherlands therefore directed the stadtholder (as commander-in-chief of the Dutch navy) to offer limited convoy to Dutch merchants. This was a compromise, as it still excluded protection of merchantmen transporting naval stores to belligerents, but it was hoped that other, even more innocent Dutch vessels could be protected from the harassment of the Royal Navy and British privateers in this way.Edler, pp. 95-130 One of the first convoys, escorted by five Dutch warships under command of Van Bylandt, departed from the Texel in December 1779, and was intercepted by a far stronger British squadron near the Isle of Wight on 30 December 1779. This led to the celebrated Affair of Fielding and Bylandt in which Bylandt was forced to strike his colors after firing just one broadside. This humiliation caused a furore in the Dutch Republic in which the stadtholder was also attacked. Van Bylandt demanded a special court-martial to clear his name of accusations of cowardice and treason, and he was acquitted.Molhuysen, p. 384 After the Affair the relations between the Republic and Great Britain steadily deteriorated, and the latter started the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War in December 1780. The Dutch colonies in the West Indies were immediately attacked and Great Britain soon captured St. Eustatius that was subsequently devastated by admiral Rodney. According to his biographer Molhuysen Van Bylandt was also sent to the area and he successfully organized the defense of Cura√ßao, which remained in Dutch hands.Molhuysen, p. 384 However, other sources, notably Dirks, tell us that Bylandt was never directly involved in the defense of Cura√ßao, but only detached a ship of the squadron with which he was staying in Lisbon at the time for that purpose.Dirks, p. 292 After his return to the Netherlands in 1781 he was promoted to vice-admiral and ordered to contest the British blockade of the Dutch coast. He found the state of the Dutch fleet so deplorable, however, that nothing came of this. As the stadtholder resisted a formal alliance with the French there was little cooperation between the Dutch, and the French and Spanish armed forces in the common war with Great Britain, which the Republic conducted as if it were alone. The French strongly favored informal cooperation in specific projects, however, and the stadtholder was not always able to prevent those. One of these projects was the combination of the French and Dutch fleets at Brest in late 1782 (when the main British fleet had sailed to Spain to defend Gibraltar), with the objective of either harassing the British coast, or attacking the British West-Indies fleet of admiral Rodney that was expected to return around this time. After long dithering the Dutch decided to provide ten ships of the line for such a project, and Van Bylandt was put in charge of this squadron. When he had inspected the ships he refused point-blank to sail in them, however, as he considered their state of readiness insufficient. In this refusal he was supported by the other Dutch commanders. The Dutch government was therefore forced to admit to the French that it was unable to provide the promised naval support.Molhuysen, p. 385 This again caused a furor in the Republic and public opinion also held the stadtholder responsible for the fiasco, though he for once had supported the expedition. The States of Holland demanded a public inquiry and the commission that conducted that inquiry recommended prosecution of the officers involved, especially Van Bylandt. This time a court-martial was not deemed to be sufficient, but the case was taken up by a special judicial commission of the States-General at the end of 1783. The trial only started in 1785 (after the war had already ended) and was dragged out by his friends. Meanwhile, the revolt of the Patriots took its course and the military intervention of the Prussians and British in 1787, that ended that revolt, also enabled the stadtholder to quietly end the inquiry.Molhuysen, pp. 385-386 Van Bylandt had never lost the favor of the stadtholder and the latter was now able to promote him to lieutenant-admiral. He was given the prestigious function of inspector- general of the corps of naval gunners. He died in 1793, still in office.Molhuysen, p. 386 During his career he made great contributions to codification of naval tactics with his Zeetactiek of Grondregelen der krijgskunde ter zee (\\"Naval tactics or Fundamentals of military science at sea;\\" Amsterdam, 1767) and he is also credited with restoring discipline in the fleet, which apparently had reached a low level at some point.Molhuysen, p. 386 Notes Sources * (1871) De Nederlandsche Zeemagt in Hare verschillende Tijdperken Geschetst.

During construction called BEWA Discoverer, the ship was completed in Bremerhaven, Germany. History The vessel was originally built as the BEWA Discoverer in 1974. The ship was sold to BEWA Cruises out of Denmark. In July 1976, the vessel was sold to Adventure Cruises, Inc. and was renamed World Discoverer. The ship also became a long- term charter to Society Expeditions. In 1976, the ship was registered in Singapore. In 1987, Society Expedition came under new ownership and was renamed Society Expedition Cruises, with offices in Seattle, United States and Germany. The new owner of the ship was Discoverer Reederei who also has ownership of other vessels, such as . In 1990, she was registered in Liberia under the name World Discoverer. The vessel had a double hull construction, allowing for periodic voyages to the Antarctic polar regions to allow its passengers to observe ice floe movements and providing protection for minor impacts. In 1996, the ship was refurbished under the new name, World Discoverer. The ship carried a fleet of inflatable dinghies, allowing passengers to move closer to ice floes for observation. Service history World Discoverer in 1978 World Discoverer at port in Ua Pou, in the Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia South Georgia During the period from November through February (Austral summer), the ship conducted cruises in the Southern Hemisphere and visited places like Antarctica, the Falkland Islands, Chile and Argentina. From March to May and August to October, the ship cruised the South Pacific Islands. Between the months of June and August, the ship cruised around the Alaskan region and also the Russian border around the Bering Sea. World Discoverer was classified as a Swedish/Finnish 1A Ice Class, allowing the ship to withstand minor floe impacts. The World Discoverer also had a cruising range, allowing the ship to travel the Northwest Passage. The ship was captained by Oliver Kruess, who had previously crewed as chief mate. Society Expeditions also hired a small team of experienced expedition leaders to answer tourist questions concerning the region, ice floes, their movements, and the ship's destinations. A small fleet of dinghies landed passengers on various shorelines for observation of local wildlife in the area. Each day comprised typically two to three shore expeditions, led by geologists, historians, naturalists, and marine biologists. The ship was equipped with an observation lounge, medical center with an active physician, library, sun deck with a small swimming pool, small fitness center, and a lecture hall.  Wreck  On 30 April 2000, at 4 p.m. local time (0500 GMT), the ship struck a large uncharted rock or reef in the Sandfly Passage, Solomon Islands. Captain Kruess sent a distress signal, which was received in Honiara, the Solomon Islands' capital city. A passenger ferry was dispatched to the ship and all passengers were then transported to safety. The captain then brought the ship into Roderick Bay after the ship began to list 20 degrees and grounded it to avoid sinking. After underwater surveying of the ship, World Discoverer was declared a constructive loss. The ship has remained in Roderick Bay ever since. Michael Lomax, president of Society Expeditions, congratulated the captain and crew for their heroic and professional actions, saying that they performed in an \\"exemplary manner\\" during the crisis. The ship was scheduled to have its annual dry-dock inspection on 11 May when annual maintenance work would have been completed. Also planned were two additional suites on the boat deck and the installation of a new fire protection system throughout the ship. Aftermath World Discoverer still sits in Roderick Bay of the Nggela Islands with a 46¬∞ list. The closest salvage companies, stationed in Australia, found the ship ransacked by locals and other factions. The Solomon Islands were undergoing civil war at the time. Tidal activity damaged the ship even more. The ship has been sustaining surface rusting with many of the windows removed. The ship became a tourist attraction with the locals of the island as well as other cruise lines that pass by World Discoverer, including MV Princess II. A salvage was attempted in 2000 but \\"abandoned after shots were exchanged with the local tribe.\\"TMC Marine presentation TMC Marine (4 July 2019). Retrieved on 2019-07-11. In the aftermath of the wreck, Society Expedition refurbished an ice-class vessel called World Discoverer, and it was launched in 2002, resuming cruises. Society Expedition ceased operations in June 2004 after their new vessel was seized by creditors in Nome, Alaska. Two weeks later, it filed for chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy.

It is open daily in the warmer months; an admission fee is charged. The garden was established in 1906 by Gustav Adolf Poscharsky, inspector of the Royal Botanical Garden of Dresden, as his private garden. As he subsequently wrote, \\"As far as I know it was the first attempt with such a garden in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains). I chose the plateau of Schellerhau at 750 m elevation.\\" There he planted species from the mountains of Asia, North America, and the Caucasus, and by 1908 was growing 93 trees, including 19 apple varieties, 9 pears, 7 plums, 2 rose varieties, many shrubs, and 401 herbaceous species. In 1916 the garden was transferred to the Forstbotanischer Garten Tharandt in what was to become a complex tangle of ownerships that persists to this day, and in 1920 became associated with the Botanischer Garten der Technischen Universit√§t Dresden as an alpine garden. In 1928 it was enlarged by two additional purchases of 2240 m¬≤ and 800 m¬≤, and subsequently began to focus upon the flora of the Erzgebirge, but fell into disuse during World War II. At war's end, of the 1026 plants species recorded in the 1930s, only 33 trees and 158 shrubs could be identified. In 1949 it was expropriated and restored with great industry by teacher and botanist Fritz Stopp, and by 1951 cultivated more than 1000 species, gradually growing to approximately 2000 species with good collections of mushrooms, lichens, and mosses. East German state funding was eliminated in 1991, with garden rehabilitation continuing through the 1990s in the reunited Germany. Today the garden cultivates about 1000 species, with a focus on endangered local species. It also collects North American and Asian species, particularly of the high mountains. Collections include high altitude plants such as alders, alpine gentian and grass, bell flowers, carnations, heather, dwarf pines, primroses, rhododendrons, and saxifrage.

His debut album Convertibles was released on April 8, 2014. Biography =1984‚Äì2012: Early life and The Cool Kids= Raised in Mount Clemens, Michigan until he moved to the Chicago area at the age of 18, Chuck Inglish born Evan Ingersoll is one half of the 2007-formed alternative hip-hop duo The Cool Kids. Ingersoll attended Notre Dame High School in Harper Woods, Michigan where he played football and basketball. He met Sir Michael Rocks in 2005 when Reed found a beat on MySpace that Ingersoll had produced. The two met to discuss terms of the beat's sale, and eventually ended up recording for two hours. They were inspired by golden age hip hop and artists like LL Cool J and Eric B. & Rakim. Ingersoll began promoting the new duo's material, and it was eventually booked by Josh Young of Flosstradamus for a DJ performance. At their performance (in a venue called Town Hall Pub), the duo met the DJ Diplo who offered to release a mixtape of their unreleased tracks titled Totally Flossed Out on his label Mad Decent, though it was eventually released on C.A.K.E. Recordings. They also received an offer from the DJ A-Trak to sign to his Fool's Gold Records label, which they did, but only for one single. During their time with Fool's Gold Records, the Cool Kids felt they weren‚Äôt getting enough attention: ‚ÄúWhen your boss is on tour with Kanye West, it‚Äôs easy to have timelines missed,‚Äù said Chuck in an interview. All of their material had been released solely on the group's MySpace page--their recording contract came after performances at the CMJ Music Festival and Pitchfork Media Music Festival, on July 15, 2007. Eventually, The Cool Kids signed to Chocolate Industries, another independent label. In 2008, the group revealed on their MySpace page that their debut album, When Fish Ride Bicycles, would be released in 2008, though it did not come out until 2011. Ingersoll has been the producer for tracks released thus far, but both work in rapping and production. The duo uses music software program Reason from Propellerhead Software to produce their music. In 2007, they opened for M.I.A. on her KALA Tour, and they also performed at the 2008 Rock the Bells hip hop festival. The group toured across Australia in February 2008 and also appeared at the Laneway Festival. The group also appeared at SUNY Purchase's Culture Shock event in April 2009. One of the duo's singles, \\"Black Mags\\", was featured in a late 2007 Rhapsody TV commercial, along with Sara Bareilles. In the same year, the group collaborated with Lil Wayne and DJ Benzi through the Internet on a track entitled \\"Gettin' It.

It contains over 1250 described species in ~40 genera. Members of this subfamily feed on a wide range of plants (over twenty plant families have been recorded as hosts) and employ a wide range of feeding habits, both internally and externally, on their host plants. Most groups of insects tend to have maximum numbers of species in the tropics and decrease towards the poles. The Nematinae reverse this trend, with the highest number probably occurring in the boreal forest zone. The reason is not fully understood but could be because of the abundance of species of willow (Salix species) in the region. In 2014, species feeding on willow, in the genera Eupontania, Phyllocolpa, Pontania and Tubpontania, were placed in the genus Euura, reflecting advances in the understanding of their phylogeny.

Rodriguez Market is a traditional public market located in the historic center of Mexico City, northeast of the main plaza, or Zocalo. It was built in 1934 as a prototype for a more modern marketplace and has a number of unusual features such as day care and an auditorium. However, the market's most distinctive feature is the approximately 1,450 square metres of wall and ceiling space covered in murals. These murals were painted by muralists, some former Diego Rivera helpers. Rivera had a role in approving artist designs, but little else.. The works mostly reflect socialist themes, such as the exploitation of workers, peasants and miners, the fight against Nazism and fascism, and racial discrimination. Earthquakes, time, humidity and vandalism took their toll on the murals from the time they were painted until restoration began in January 2009. Restoration work is expected to take almost two years. Construction One of the four main entrances The market was constructed in 1934 in what was part of the grounds of the San Pedro y San Pablo College. The architect was Antonio Mu√±oz, who mixed Baroque, Belle √âpoque, Art Nouveau and Art Deco elements into the building. The market has an area of 12,450 square metres and is the main market for foodstuffs in this part of the city. Upon completion, it was named after the president of Mexico who ordered the complex built. Eventually, the area around this market became known as ‚ÄúAbelardo.‚Äù Features This market was the second major market built in Mexico City in the first decades of the 20th century, after the Dos de Abril Market built in 1912. Like its predecessor, the Abelard L. Rodriguez market was intended to be a prototype for a new, more modern popular marketplace, first for the large size of the market and second for a number of extra services offered within the building, such as day care centers, youth centers and libraries. Food vendors at the market with the metal roof visible The Abelardo L. Rodriguez market has four large entrances on Rep√∫blica de Venezuela, Rep√∫blica de Colombia, Del Carmen and Rodr√≠guez Puebla streets respectively. One unusual feature of the building is the metal roof that covers the central patio area. Its most distinctive service is the Teatro del Pueblo (Theatre of the People) auditorium, which is located on the upper floor. A number of the services and features of this market were copied in markets built as much as twenty years later, such as the markets of La Lagunilla, Tepito and La Merced. Murals However, the market's most distinctive feature is the approximately 1,450 square meters of wall and ceiling space covering in murals. These murals were painted by students of Diego Rivera and under his direction. Six of the ten painters involved with the project were Mexican, three were American and one was Japanese, working to ‚Äúbring art to the people‚Äù and paid 13.50 pesos (3.75 U.S. dollars approximately) for each square meter painted. The murals are located in the main entrances, vestibules, patios and hallways of the market. Part of entrance painted by Pablo Rendon These murals include: Los mercados by √Ångel Bracho, Influencia de las vitaminas by Antonio Pujol, Los alimentos y los problemas del obrero by Pedro Rend√≥n, Escenas populares by Ram√≥n Alva Guadarrama, Las labores del campo by Grace Greenwood Ames, La miner√≠a by Marion Greenwood, La industrializaci√≥n del campo and Los mercados by Ra√∫l Gamboa as well as the copper-plated relief called Historia de M√©xico, de Isamu Noguchi. The murals reflect socialist themes in part due to the policies of the Mexican government to promote the benefits of the 1910 Mexican Revolution. They also reflect the concerns of these artists during this time period, leading to themes such as the exploitation of workers, peasants and miners, the fight against Nazism and fascism, and racial discrimination. On the upper floor, Noguchi created a wall sculpture combined with painting called La historia de Mexico, in which can be seen fists, swastikas, skeletons and Albert Einstein‚Äôs formula E=mc2. This mural work quickly gave the market and the neighborhood around it prominence. It has been ranked fourth in value after the murals in the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the Secretaria de Educacion Publica building and the National Palace. Noguchi's work alone has been valued at two million U.S. dollars. However, in spite of this, these murals are practically unknown by domestic or international visitors to the city. Deterioration of murals and other problems Main entrance to the section of the building that has the Teatro del Pueblo From the time the murals were painted in the 1930s to 2009, there had been no organized effort by authorities to conserve the murals painted here. The 1985 earthquake, humidity, the passage of time, the lack of maintenance and vandalism took their toll on the artwork. Almost all of the murals showed some level of damage with only the murals painted by Pablo O'Higgins at the entrance located at Del Carmen and Rodriguez Puebla were in good condition. This is primarily because these works were done on the ceiling and upper portions of high walls. One of the murals in the worst condition was Influencia de las vitaminas by Angel Bracho, with over 50% of the surface area damaged, mostly by humidity. A wall that holds a work by Marion Greenwood is cracked, possibly due to the 1985 earthquake. The rest of the paintings are damaged by scratches, humidity and small cracks due to the same earthquake, with those at arms reach suffering from graffiti and other vandalism. The lack of maintenance and protection of the murals was primarily due to disputes between government agencies such as the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (INBA) and the Mexico City government as to who had the responsibility for them. In 1998, merchants in the market banded together to create an organization to restore the murals and to get the market included in the various tourism promotions of the city government. While this particular effort failed, new efforts surfaced in the 2000s. The merchant association installed acrylic screens over a number of the murals to protect them, but the city government stated that these did not let the murals ‚Äúbreathe‚Äù and could cause damage, so they were removed. Until 2008, efforts by merchants had mostly consisted of not letting children play ball against the murals and not leaning merchandise or other materials against them. Other problems for the market include the large number of wandering and informal street vendors that are on the streets outside market and nearly block passage through the four main entrances into it and block access to the murals with their merchandise. This has been a problem here for over thirty years. In addition, the crime rate in this neighborhood has caused the more than 330 merchants here have seen their sales drop by eighty percent. Restoration of murals With more than a thousand square metres of mural work, some of it very valuable, restoration work began in 2009. Promises by the authority for the Historic Center of Mexico City in 2008 gave merchants here hope that needed changes would be made and the market would become as prominent as it was when it opened in 1934. Both the city and the merchants expressed interest in including the market in a tourist corridor to be ready for the Bicentennial celebrations in 2010. A concrete plan with a budget of 2,400,000 pesos was signed by city government, the city's Authority of the Historic Center, the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (INBA) and the Cuauht√©moc borough late in 2008. Work on restoring the murals began in January 2009. Merchants here have expressed willingness to help with restoration of the murals, with which many of them grew up. One example is Hugo Le√≥n, who runs a juice business that he inherited from his father, located under the mural La elaboraci√≥n del carb√≥n by Ram√≥n Alva Guadarrama. Work on this mural forced him to move and shut down temporarily, but he says he did so gladly. He and other merchants here have worked to clean the market and make way for the work being done, according to Leticia Ramirez, a leader of the merchants. Restoration work is scheduled to last approximately 23 months. Further reading *Acevedo, Esther. \\"Young Muralists at the Abelardo L.

Career in law Al-Husseini studied law in Istanbul and upon graduation returned to Gaza where he became a prominent lawyer. He was then assigned as a member of the Land Court of Nablus but resigned soon after his appointment. He reentered work in his legal profession and subsequently was appointed Magistrate of Nablus. He was later appointed a member of the Central Council, and then resigned again to continue his work as a lawyer.Fahmi al-Husseini 1928 Municipality of Gaza. On December 1, 1923, he launched al-Haquq (\\"The Rights\\") magazine and was its editor-in-chief. Al- Husseini published the Sawt al-Haq (\\"Voice of the Truth\\") newspaper on October 6, 1927 and around the same period he translated into Arabic the famous Hanafi book on legal proceedings, Sharh Majallat al-Ahkam (\\"Commentaries on the Codified Hanafi Commercial Law\\", prepared in four volumes in Turkish during the Ottoman period by Allama Ali Haidar.Palestinian Personalities - H Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs.

He was elected mayor of Gaza on May 5, 1928. In 1930, a number of Gaza notables, mostly members of the city's municipal council, complained to the high commissioner of Palestine about al-Husseini. They were angered at the decision to allow al- Husseini to maintain his legal practice while he served as Gaza's mayor, stating he was occupied with his own private business \\"to an extent as to neglect the interests of the town [Gaza] which is more needy of organization than any in this country.\\"Feldman, 2008, p.50. However, during his tenure, Gaza was extended to the coast (Rimal district), the local hospital and market were completed, the streets were widened, and the city received electricity in 1938 in cooperation with the Palestinian Electricity Company. Al-Husseini also oversaw the establishment of the municipal hall of Gaza along Omar Mukhtar Street. In addition to the latter street‚Äîwhich he named after the Libyan revolutionary Omar Mukhtar‚Äîhe also named several other new streets in Gaza including Imam Shafi'i Street, Firas Street, and Jamal Fahmi Pasha Street. In 1938, during the Arab revolt in Palestine, the British Mandate authorities had him arrested on charges of being a member of the anti-British leadership in Palestine. He, along with Mousa Sourani, was imprisoned in the Sarafand Jail. Al-Husseini was stripped of his post as mayor by the British in 1939 and was replaced by Rushdi al-Shawa.

The Allied Powers envisioned isolating them through trade sanctions after the war. A standing body, the Comit√© permanent international d'action √©conomique, based in Paris, was established to monitor the implementation of the pact.

Initially presented as an easy-going young woman with questionable priorities, Sydney would gradually be developed into one of the series' most multi-faceted characters. During her introduction in the first and second seasons, Sydney is prone to making rash and irresponsible decisions, such as getting involved with her sister's ex, and having a brush with the law. Though she often appears carefree and detached, she displays a sensitive side while enduring the consequences of her actions, and while sharing comforting moments with others. Later during the second season, Sydney reveals an opportunistic nature during her first blackmail scheme. Following this story, the character gained a reputation for having a playful and uninhibited side. Throughout a good deal of the third season, Sydney is more often presented as a victim, being subjected to much mistreatment and stress. While continuing to endure, she finds support from unexpected people, and later attempts to help others during a chaotic event. The series' fourth season returns the character to her clever and scheming ways, though she is presented more as comedic relief during a period of rather serious story lines, and continues to display a compassionate side. In the fifth season, following years of romantic interests, she appears to finally obtain a fulfilling but short-lived relationship. Afterward, at her wedding, she is seemingly killed after being hit by a car, but reappears alive in the spin-off. In the latter series, Sydney is revealed to have a daughter named Violet. The character's impact is generally held in high regard. In its biographical article on Leighton, Yahoo! labels Sydney a \\"begrudgingly beloved\\" character. While reporting on the original series in 1994, Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly, and People magazine all featured Leighton on their covers. Additionally, she earned a Golden Globe nomination for the role in 1995. Story lines =Melrose Place= Sydney comes to Los Angeles in the first season to visit her older sister Jane Mancini (Josie Bissett) in the Melrose Place apartment complex. Sydney has a turbulent relationship with Jane's husband Michael (Thomas Calabro), and ultimately returns to Chicago after she and Jane are unable to work out their differences. After Jane leaves Michael over his adultery with Kimberly Shaw (Marcia Cross), Sydney returns in the second season, living with Jane and offering her comfort. Soon Sydney displays a secret attraction toward Michael. Desperate for money, she temporarily becomes a prostitute and begins an affair with Michael, who she later blackmails into marriage when it appears that he had been responsible for Kimberly's death via drunk driving. The marriage with Michael is successful until Kimberly reappears alive. Forced out of her home, Sydney soon begins plotting Michael's death with Kimberly. Kimberly uses Sydney as a patsy in the plan, bluntly tells her that she's going to turn her in to the police unless she flees L.A., and Sydney is arrested when she doesn't do so‚Äîeven after Matt found out Kimberly was responsible for the near-fatal hit-and-run attack on Michael, Sydney pleads guilty and gets probation for it, with the truth remaining either hidden or blocked by Michael. In the third season, while Jane is later freed due to questions about her sanity and sent to a mental institution, Sydney works as a waitress and bookkeeper for fellow tenant Jake Hanson (Grant Show), with the two eventually beginning a brief romantic relationship. Later, Sydney discovers that an unstable Kimberly is planning to set off explosions in the apartment complex, and she and Michael manage to warn the other tenants in time. In season four, Sydney recovers from the explosion and reunites with Michael, but he quickly pursues an affair with Jane and ends his relationship with Sydney. Sydney's scheming nature begins to reemerge, though she continues to display a compassionate side. Sydney eventually moves on to dating Bobby Parezi (John Enos III), Amanda Woodward's (Heather Locklear) former brother-in-law, who later dies. After Jane is brutally abused by her ex-boyfriend Richard Hart (Patrick Muldoon), Jane plans to shoot him in vengeance, while Sydney tries to dissuade her from going through with it. Confronting Richard, Jane hesitates to pull the trigger, doing so only when he advances on her. She then realizes that Sydney had secretly removed the bullets from her gun. As Richard tries to beat Jane, Sydney knocks him unconscious with a shovel. Thinking he is dead, they bury him; he crawls out of his grave to stalk them, and is later killed in a shoot- out with the police. Jane later moves back to Chicago, the sisters acknowledging their bond and parting on good terms. Sydney finds happiness with Craig Field (David Charvet). Together, they usurp Amanda and form their own advertising agency, Sky High, raiding most of her staff and effectively putting an end to D&D.; The on-and-off couple are married in the fifth season finale, but at the wedding reception Sydney is hit by a car, forcibly driven by her one-time business partner Samantha Reilly's (Brooke Langton) scummy father. Sydney is seemingly killed, and a distraught Craig later commits suicide. =Melrose Place (2009)= Sydney and her daughter, Violet (Leighton and Simpson) Sydney is revealed to be alive in the 2009 series, her death faked with Michael's assistance. She is now the landlady of 4616 Melrose Place, and a central figure in the lives of its current tenants. In the opening scenes of the pilot, Sydney is found murdered, floating in the pool. Several of the building's residents become suspects, their backstories with Sydney revealed in flashbacks. It is revealed in flashbacks how Michael helped Sydney fake her death (that would have taken place during the time of the original series off-screen). Sydney believed that someone from her past was the one who ran her down (it was in fact Samantha and her father). Believing her husband was at risk, Sydney convinced Michael to help her. She disappeared, and later returned and did time for faking her death. Because of the injuries she sustained in the accident, Sydney developed a nasty drug and alcohol problem. Sydney is shown to have had brief intimate relationships with Michael, his estranged son David and Auggie Kirkpatrick. She is revealed to be the mother of new resident Violet Foster (Ashlee Simpson). Initially rejecting Violet and claiming to have never given birth to a child, Sydney later tells Violet she wants to get to know her, only to be murdered soon after. Sydney's death brings Jane to town as the new owner of the building. Threatening to use evidence from Sydney to implicate Ella in the murder, Jane blackmails Ella into getting a celebrity client to wear Jane's designs. The return of Amanda Woodward to Los Angeles is also connected to Sydney, who had been selling stolen paintings for Amanda but had kept one for herself and hidden it before her death. In episode 12 it is revealed that Michael's wife Vanessa had visited Sydney to confront her about the affair with Michael. Sydney's taunts about Vanessa and Michael's son Noah actually being fathered by David had driven Vanessa to attack and ultimately kill Sydney. Suspecting Vanessa, David leaves Noah with Violet to keep Vanessa from leaving town with her son; confronting her mother's killer, Violet wrestles a gun-toting Vanessa into the pool and drowns her. In episode 18, she reappears as a ghost in Amanda's imagination. Reception In its biographical article on Leighton, Yahoo! states that she gave the character \\"expressive facial movements, fiery intensity, and a surprising likable quality.\\" The article goes on to say that \\"despite all her misdeeds, Sydney invariably became sympathetic when the show's treacherous tide turned against her.\\" As the original series gained popularity, the show received attention from Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly, and People magazine, with Leighton being featured on every cover. In 1995, the actress was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for her role on Melrose Place. When announcing her return for the 2009 spin-off, The Hollywood Reporter recognized Sydney as \\"one of the most popular characters\\" from the original show. When the follow-up series premiered, Entertainment Weekly placed Leighton's portrayal of Sydney as number one on their weekly \\"Must List\\", calling her \\"the same bitchy, unhinged instigator we adored.\\" Amy Amatangelo of Zap2it criticized the decision to kill the character in the 2009 series, labeling it a mistake. Alan Sepinwall of NJ.com called the move \\"a poor way to use one of the more memorable vixens of '90s Melrose.\\" In a 2009 interview, producer Todd Slavkin claimed that the show had not ruled out the possibility of bringing back Sydney, stating, \\"We would never close the door officially.\\" References Category:Melrose Place (1992 TV series) characters Category:Melrose Place (2009 TV series) characters Category:Fictional characters from Chicago Category:Fictional prostitutes Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Fictional receptionists Category:Fictional people in fashion Category:Fictional landlords Category:Television characters introduced in 1993 Category:American female characters in television ","title":"Sydney Andrews"},{"id":"23100452","text":"Christopher Mason may refer to: * Chris Mason (ice hockey), Christopher Robert Mason (born 1976), Canadian ice hockey goaltender * Chris Mason (darts player), Christopher John Mason (born 1969), English darts player *Christopher Mason, character in The Russian Concubine *Christopher E.

Besides portraying the massive technological achievement of that event, the film places it in some historical context and tries to capture the mood and the feel of the people on Earth when man first walked on another world. Original 1970 release After the film was completed in 1969 there was not much interest in it because the general public had been saturated with the US space program, especially with several other lunar missions which followed Apollo 11 over the next three years. NASA gave the film a screening in New York City for possible distributors, but it was considered to be too long, and subsequently failed to be picked up. To counter this lack of interest about 15 minutes was cut from the finished film at NASA's direction. This failed to gain renewed interest from distributors, but the film was shown at the Cannes Film Festival in the summer of 1971, where it won a special award and was described as a \\"sleeper\\". The Whitney Museum of American Art in New York began a new film series called \\"New American Directors\\", and Moonwalk One was placed in its first program. It received many favorable reviews and was thereafter screened in a selection of theaters nationally, capitalizing on the publicity due to the Whitney program. 2009 Re-release In 2009 a 35mm print of the film was telecined, and re- released in a special \\"Director's Cut\\" edition under the supervision of Theo Kamecke. The DVD includes a director's commentary, the story of the making of the film and other features. This version first premiered on Monday July 20, 2009. History of the making of Moonwalk One A year and a half before the Apollo 11 flight, NASA had approached Francis Thompson Inc about making a very ambitious film telling the story of the whole Apollo program, culminating with the landing on the Moon. Francis Thompson and his partner Alexander Hammid were at that time generally regarded as the best documentary filmmakers in the USA, having won fame as the creators of the hit of the 1964-65 New York World's Fair To Be Alive!, a multi-screen film which played to overflow crowds and garnered the Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject in 1966. The NASA film had the working title of Man in Space. It was to be a theatrical production of several million dollars at minimum, with funding and distribution supplied by MGM, and would have included a re-enactment of the moonwalk on a sound stage. The Francis Thompson company even conducted preliminary shooting during one or two of the earlier Apollo missions, but in early 1969 because of reshuffling at MGM, the project lost its backing. Both Francis Thompson and NASA frantically sought funding elsewhere but nothing resulted, and Thompson began to turn his attention to another project. Six weeks before the launch of Apollo 11, NASA called again and said that although the big-budget film was obviously dead, they did not want this event to 'slip through their fingers', nor did they want to make the kind of industrial film which was usually produced after each mission. NASA said they could scrape together $350,000 and wanted to know if Thompson could do anything with that. Already involved with another project, Francis turned to Theo Kamecke, who had edited To Be Alive! and had since gone on to direct other films independently. Bill Johnnes came on board as line producer because he had been involved with the ill-fated MGM production and was already familiar with many of the necessary contacts. Stonehenge and Moonwalk One Since the time was so short, Kamecke's immediate challenge was to scout the location, determine what to shoot, and select the several film crews that were going to be necessary for capturing an event happening over a very short period of time. It was during this scouting trip to Cape Canaveral that the idea came to him to begin the film with Stonehenge, which he had seen on a sunless dawn the year before while in England shooting another film. The two efforts, Apollo and Stonehenge, seemed inseparable. At the moment of the Apollo 11 launch, Kamecke had asked his camera crews to resist the temptation to look at the launch themselves, but instead concentrate on the faces of the people watching. He himself was in Launch Control with a NASA cameraman and was the only civilian ever issued a pass to the Firing Room. During the moonwalk he was in Mission Control MOCR in Houston, Texas. The remainder of the film was researched and planned out after the launch in July, and the treatment written and delivered just a short time before the trip to England to film Stonehenge. NASA and Moonwalk One In the weeks before the launch Theo Kamecke flew to Washington D.C. to meet the appropriate people at NASA, and get his bearings on the film. He was hoping that because they had come to Francis Thompson in the first place, they wouldn't be wanting a laundry-list type of film. The man who ran Public Relations for NASA, Julian Shear, had come from a substantial career in television broadcasting, was very savvy, and knew that by the time the film was finished the public would already be saturated with media about Apollo, and that the film would have no box office appeal. He asked Kamecke not to worry about that, but just to make a time capsule. Elements of the film Aside from all the predictable footage available from NASA (16mm, video and stills shot during the mission, and views from space shot during other missions), there were huge pieces to be filled in. Stock footage researchers were set to the task of finding newsreel footage of the time, and beautiful and unusual footage from around the world to represent both the people and the planet as this event unfolded. The scenes of the making of the spacecraft and suits, and the testing of human endurance were shot in the months following the first moonwalk. The launch sequence itself, with all the slow motion shots of flame, smoke and falling ice were put together from engineering film shot by cameras on the launch pad and tower. In looking through a technical manual he obtained from NASA, Kamecke noticed that besides the three or four shots of the launch which had been allocated for media purposes, there were 240 film cameras automatically triggered at launch. He asked where that other footage was, and was told that they didn't know but could find out. It turned out that after development, that film was sent down to the rocket research center in Huntsville, Alabama. Kamecke traveled to Huntsville and found that footage tossed into two cardboard cartons sitting under a workbench. The engineers were only interested in it if something blew up or if some propellant hose didn't disconnect properly. After that, it was disposed of. Kamecke looked through it and selected several reels to box up and take back to New York. Most of them were on 16mm and were taken at such a high frame rate that they seemed to be hardly moving at all, so it was determined how much to speed them up while still seeming slow motion, and were sent to an optical house to be blown up to 35mm. Opticals There were many \\"opticals\\" used in the making of Moonwalk One. The Earth rising over the Moon, or the pan from the Earth floating in space to the close surface of the Moon, for example. There was no footage shot by the astronauts that was comparable. The \\"Earth Poem\\" sequence was composed of Hasselblad stills of the Earth taken by astronauts on previous missions, and sent to an optical house to create very slow moves across the surface. The animated explanation for how the Apollo-Saturn rocket was put together, how it functioned and how each expended piece was left behind leaving only the Command Module to plummet back to Earth, was intended to look like simple computer animation. In 1970 even the simplest computer animation was so expensive and time consuming to do that it was far cheaper to do cell animation, where each image was drawn on a clear acetate just like Mickey Mouse cartoons. The 2019 documentary Apollo 11 pays homage to Moonwalk One by re-using the designs for the animated spacecraft in genuine computer animations. Music and sound effects The composer selected for Moonwalk One was Charles Morrow, who had developed a reputation for very flexible, avant garde, and stirring compositions by the late 1960s. For the \\"Earth Poem\\" sequence he came up with heartbeat, breathing, and a very moving cello line. In places throughout the film, telemetry sounds from spacecraft were integrated so that they themselves became the music. None of these telemetry sounds were from Apollo, because by that time telemetry was so rapid and of such frequency that even slowed down was inaudible to the ear. The telemetry sounds were taken from Mariner IV which flew by Mars many years before, the last time such sounds were audible. The sound of the Apollo rocket launch is a mix of V2 rocket and atom bomb punctuated by slowed down struck metal which emulates cathedral bells, creating a thread with the slowed down brass in the Stonehenge music which bookends the film and the pipe organ score linking the Apollo 11 rocket flight with micro and macro universes. Narrator According to the film's director Theo Kamecke speaking on the director's commentary of the 2009 film release the narrator, Laurence Luckinbill, was selected because he was not a narrator but an actor who had not only the voice but the temperament to understand the feel of the film. Production of the finished film Because the footage for the film originated from so many sources ‚Äì 70mm, 35mm, 16mm, video, stills ‚Äì it was necessary to settle on a format very early in production that would accommodate all these sources without making it obvious that the film was jumping from one source to another. The original specifications for the film, left over from the MGM co-production concept, were for it to be filmed in 70mm. There was not time before the launch to reconsider this, and so the launch crews were working with a few 70mm cameras and some 35mm. After the moonwalk Kamecke went to the people at NASA and explained that the film really couldn't be done in 70mm for the budget allowed because of the cost of film and processing, the unwieldiness of the equipment, and the slowness of the lenses which would require more lighting and thus larger crews. It was decided to release the film in 35mm in the traditional 4:3 screen ratio, which would accommodate not only the footage shot by the astronauts, but all of the stock footage as well. The 70mm footage would have to be reduced to 35mm masters, selecting the optimum part of the 70mm frame. The finished film was assembled and printed by Technicolor in California, using the same system that had produced all the great Hollywood color films from the 1930s through the 1960s. The process was called dye transfer, in which black and white fine-grain masters were created for each of the colors, run through a bath of ink, and contact printed onto clear acetate, one after the other, just as books would have been printed. It was quite a bit more expensive than using light-sensitive film which would then be chemically developed, but the clarity and control was more exact and of better quality than light-sensitive stock. By the time Moonwalk One was finished, light- sensitive emulsion film had become much better technically and was much cheaper than the Technicolor process. Moonwalk One was one of the last American films created using the process. Reception Critics gave the film very positive reviews. ABC News reported that Moonwalk One was the first documentary worthy of the immensity of the Moon launch itself, and Cue Magazine described it in 1972 as an extraordinary documentary of historical scope and time capsule worthiness. Archer Winsten writing in the New York Post in November 1972 declared that it deserved to be a companion piece to Stanley Kubrick's 1968 masterwork 2001: A Space Odyssey.

History Dinajpur district was constituted in 1786. In 1947, the Radcliffe Line placed the Sadar and Thakurgaon subdivisions of Dinajpur district in East Pakistan. The Balurghat subdivision of Dinajpur district was reconstituted as West Dinajpur district in West Bengal. The new Raiganj subdivision was formed in 1948. In order to restore territorial links between northern and southern parts of West Bengal which had been snapped during the partition of Bengal, and on the recommendations of the States Reorganisation Commission a portion of the erstwhile Kishanganj subdivision comprising Goalpokhar, Islampur and Chopra thanas (police stations) and parts of Thakurganj thana, along with the adjacent parts of the erstwhile Gopalpur thana in Katihar subdivision were transferred from Purnea district in Bihar to West Bengal in 1956, and were formally incorporated into Raiganj subdivision in West Dinajpur. The township of Kishanganj and its entire municipal boundary remained within Bihar. With the introduction of the Community Development Programme in 1960-61, community development blocks were set up in West Dinajpur district. In 1992, West Dinajpur district was bifurcated and Dakshin Dinajpur district was established. Geography Harirampur is located at .

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. History =Foundation and initial flotation= The housebuilding business that became Countryside Properties was founded in 1958 by Alan Cherry CBE, who remained its chairman until his death in January 2010.Countryside chair Alan Cherry dies, Inside Housing, 25 January 2010 His eldest son, Graham Cherry, was appointed to the board in 1984 and has been chief executive since 1996; his youngest son Richard Cherry was appointed to the board in 1986 and was appointed deputy chairman in 2005. Alan Cherry, a chartered surveyor, began his career as an estate agent and was one of the founding partners of Bairstow Eves. In 1959, the four Bairstow partners formed Copthorn as a development business, with Alan Cherry running it part-time. One of the Bairstow clients was another developer, Countryside Properties, formed in 1958 by Solomon 'Bob' Bobroff, and in the late 1960s the two concerns began to work together.Wellings, Fred. Dictionary of British Housebuilders (2006), Troubador. . In 1972 Countryside acquired Copthorn and, with Bobroff as chairman and Alan Cherry as a joint managing director, Countryside was floated on the London Stock Exchange.History on official website =Return to private status= The flotation was closely followed by a recession and in 1975 Countryside passed its final dividend. Bobroff had resigned in 1974, and the subsequent expansion was under the sole direction of Alan Cherry. He emphasised the importance of design and marketing and took the company into a series of very large sites, e.g. Chelmer Village and Chatham Maritime. In 2005, Alan Cherry sought to take the company private. A prominent investor, Paul Kemsley and Joe Lewis's Rock Properties, increased its stake to 28.5%, forcing Cherry to pay more for the company. Countryside was bought out by Copthorn Holdings Ltd, which was then jointly owned by the Cherry family and the Bank of Scotland, part of Lloyds Banking Group.History on official website The company achieved record profits in the following two years, amounting to ¬£27 million on a turnover of ¬£430 million in the year ended September 2007.Countryside Properties enjoys record ¬£27m profit, Contract Journal, 14 February 2008. Retrieved 5 June 2009. However, the late-2000s financial crisis affected housebuilders acutely, and the company recorded a loss of ¬£22 million on sales of ¬£312 million in the year to September 2008. Under a refinancing deal in October 2009, Lloyds took control of the company. In 2013, Oaktree Capital Management purchased a majority share in the company, making a further capital injection. The Cherry family retain a minority stake, and Lloyds provided five-year loan facilities. As of October 2014, former Keepmoat chief executive Ian Sutcliffe became the new executive chairman. In 2014 Oaktree acquired luxury home developer Millgate and merged it with Countryside, planning to double the company's size. Following this, the company rebranded as Countryside rather than Countryside Properties, adopting the slogan ‚ÄòPlaces People Love‚Äô. In 2015, Countryside announced further changes to its board of directors. David Howell, previously a non-executive director, became chairman, whilst Ian Sutcliffe assumed the role of group chief executive officer. Graham Cherry became CEO new homes and communities, whilst Richard Cherry became CEO partnerships. =Second flotation= In February 2016 the company was the subject of an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange. Projects ;Developments Great Notley Garden Village is an extension to the town of Braintree, Essex, built over a decade starting in 1993. As well as almost 2,000 homes in three separate 'hamlets', it has a primary school, church, community centre, doctors' surgery, supermarket, chip shop and village green.Daisy Froud, Countryside Properties and the Shape of Time, University of London, 2002. Reprinted in Home Cultures Journal, 2004. Illustrated academic review of Great Notley Garden Village and Beaulieu Park, Chelmsford. The Village is cited as an example of Countryside's design philosophy of 'maturity' and 'community'. Great Kneighton is located 3.7 km south of Cambridge between the village of Trumpington, Cambridgeshire and Addenbrooke's Hospital, and lies in the Cambridge Southern Fringe growth area. The overall development will eventually provide up to 2,250 new homes, extensive strategic open space, accompanying provision of education facilities, sports and recreation, health and community facilities and local shopping facilities. Forty per cent of the new homes will be affordable housing. The overall vision for Wickhurst Green is to provide an extension to the existing village of Broadbridge Heath, providing much-needed new homes and community facilities. At the heart of this new development will be a new primary school and village centre, creating the opportunity for new community and healthcare facilities. Integral to the development is the provision of a wide range of outdoor activities for sports and recreation. As well as local greens and landscaped spaces for informal recreation, residents will be able to enjoy two large neighbourhood play areas designed for a range of age groups, several formal sports pitches and courts with changing, parking and social facilities. Beaulieu is a sustainable urban extension to the North East of Chelmsford. Countryside are working in a joint venture with London & Quadrant to create a sustainable community on 850 acres in a highly accessible location between the A130 and the A12 at the Boreham Interchange. Key elements of the overall proposals include a mixed-use residential and commercial development providing up to 3,600 new mixed-tenure homes, and a site for a new railway station - one of only a handful of new station proposals in the UK which has full rail industry support. ;Regeneration Greenwich Millennium Village Limited, a joint venture between Countryside and Taylor Wimpey, won a government-initiated competition in February 1998 to transform the former site of Europe's largest gas works into a sustainable new community.

In 2008, Guinness Trust chose Countryside in 2008 as contractor for regeneration of the Loughborough Park Estate in Brixton, south London. The project includes replacing 390 homes built in the 1930s with 530 new homes and community facilities.Countryside wins ¬£105m Lambeth regeneration scheme, Contract Journal, 22 October 2008. Retrieved 6 June 2009. Controversies =Ground rent= In 2017, it was reported that Countryside was selling properties with doubling Ground rent terms written into the leasehold contracts of purchasers, such terms are considered by mortgage lenders such as Nationwide Building Society to be \\"unfair\\" and ones that they would be unwilling to lend on. In light of increasing media coverage, Countryside signalled it would attempt to 'buy back' freeholds and amend terms for some leaseholders affected by 10 year doubling ground rents, by linking increases to Retail price index. Subsequently, the government has turned attention to what it views as abuse of the Leasehold system and announced a raft of measures, including capping future ground rents at zero for future new build homes. =Cladding= In 2018, following the Grenfell Tower fire, a fire service investigation deemed the cladding unsafe on the NV Buildings in Salford Quays. The buildings were developed in 2004 by Countryside and built by Carillion, which had gone into liquidation in January 2018. Householders were told the costs to replace the cladding would have to be met by them. So far, Countryside has not said whether it will pay, although developers Taylor Wimpey and Barratt have done so elsewhere on \\"moral\\" grounds, despite not being legally required to. A structural engineer, contracted by residents, reviewed the buildings in June 2018. The report concluded that the use of expanded polystyrene (EPS) and gaps in fire breaks on external walls meant the development may not have complied with building regulations when built. Countryside said NV Buildings received all relevant approvals when Carillion completed the project. Countryside is currently undertaking a \\"comprehensive review\\" of the building's design and construction.

It is on the northeast shore of Tomales Bay south- southwest of Tomales, at an elevation of 7 feet (2 m). Hog Island is in the middle of Tomales Bay, to the west of Nick's Cove, and Point Reyes National Seashore constitutes the western landmass on the opposite side of the bay. The name honors Nick Kojich, who in 1931 opened a seafood restaurant at this location, which is still in operation. History The land was originally settled by the Coast Miwok people. In 1835, a Mexican land grant called Rancho Nicasio was granted to the Miwoks, consisting of . U.S. Army officer Henry Halleck, later a Union Army general during the Civil War, gained ownership of the majority of the rancho in 1850. Croatian immigrants began settling in and around Marshall, California, a few miles south of what is now Nick's Cove, in 1900. The Markovich brothers, who were Croatian fishermen, operated on Tomales Bay near what later became Nick's Cove in the 1920s. By 1930, there was a small facility for packing smoked herring at the cove. Nick Kojic arrived in the area in 1920, and in 1931, opened a seafood stand in a former herring smokehouse. When Prohibition ended in 1933, he opened a bar. He called the business Nick's Cove. He also rented small cabins and cottages to tourists. Over the years, the business was owned successively by the Matkovich and Gibson families. The bar burned in 1950 but was soon rebuilt. The business closed in the early 1990s. Restaurant interior in 2007 as designed by Pat Kuleto Modern reincarnation Restaurant at Nick's Cove In 1999, restaurant developer Pat Kuleto purchased the property in conjunction with chef Mark Franz.

Some of the founding members of Big Science Action such as Rising Sun, Sunburst, and Goraiko are pre-existing DC Comics characters. Goraiko was originally created by Grant Morrison and Howard Porter in JLA #26 (February 1999). According to writer Grant Morrison \\"these guys were Japan's JLA back in the day, with a ring or halo-shaped base hovering above Mount Fuji\\".As seen in Final Crisis Sketchbook #1 (May 2008) History The Big Science Action team are seen together for the first time as they appeared in the \\"Silver Age\\" of Japanese superheroics, in a Tokyo television documentary retrospective in the pages of Final Crisis #2 (June 2008). During this appearance Rising Sun complains about the ongoing process of self commodification being carried out by modern Japanese superheroes such as the Super Young Team.As seen in Final Crisis #2 (June 2008) An updated version of Big Science Action appears in Final Crisis Aftermath: Dance #4, in this issue Junior Waveman Kimura invites his daughter Shiny Happy Aquazon from the Super Young Team to join the team, and introduces her to new team member Nazo Baluda.As seen in Final Crisis Aftermath: Dance #4 (October 2009) In the Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock, a variation of Big Science Action is featured called Big Monster Action. Besides Rising Sun, Goriako, and Hammersuit Zero-X, the other members listed are Judomaster, Naiad, Ram, and Samurai.Doomsday Clock #6 (July 2018). DC Comics. Founding members =Boss Bosozuko= Boss Bosozuko, is a hotheaded motorcycle rider. Bosozuko's hair is made up of nuclear flames as are the tires on his special motorcycle. His name B≈çs≈çzoku translates as \\"violent running gang\\", and stems from the Japanese B≈çs≈çzoku motorcycle gangs of the 1950s. =Cosmo Racer= The being known as Cosmo Racer is an amnesiac extraterrestrial android who requires specials crystals to power his \\"roller boots\\" up for interstellar travel. According to his creator Grant Morrison: \\"What only we know is that his \\"Maker\\" is a monstrous space tyrant who has sent his little herald out to identify and pacify target planets\\". Using his roller boots Cosmo Racer can currently travel at the speed of sound. His body is made from an unknown nearly frictionless alien material similar in texture to terrestrial ceramics or plastics. =Goraiko= Goraiko is a psionic construct projected from the mind of an unnamed young Japanese girl who resides in a high tech sensory deprivation tank. The Goraiko construct only speaks in haiku and mathematical equations. The girl has a Totoro styled doll in the tank that appears to be the inspiration for Goraiko's shape, but it is unknown if it is necessary for the manifestation of the being. The being known as Goraiko is large and superhumanly strong, two versions of the Goraiko construct are known to exist, the 'green version' in Big Science Action and the 'gray version' in the Ultramarines. Grant Morrison described about Goraiko: \\"I also threw in Goraiko, the ‚ÄòNuclear Totoro‚Äô character I created for the Ultramarine Corps back in the JLA days and changed his colour as a little tip of the hat to gray Hulk/green Hulk\\". He is a member of the International Ultramarine Corps. =Hammersuit Zero-X= Miss Kusanagi a Japanese schoolgirl, who is also a supersmart science heroine pilots the monster fighting suit of powered armor known as a \\"Hammersuit\\".

There are two foot guard units and two horse guard units. In colonial times, one foot guard unit and one horse guard unit served the Hartford area and the other two in the New Haven area.

Although other organizations may have been formed at an earlier date, the First Company is unique in its record of unbroken service. A member of the 1st Governor's Foot Guard drills a pilot hole for a tent stake in the parking lot of Saint Francis Hospital in Hartford, Connecticut. Hartford, in 1771, was remote from larger towns. It was a small town of 3,000 inhabitants, with few churches and schools. The journey to New York or Boston took three days in a stagecoach which ran but once a week. Small as it was, Hartford was not lacking in public spirit. A group of leading young men in Hartford decided it was time to organize a select company for the purpose of escorting the Governor and General Assembly at the General Elections after an unfortunate incident in 1768, when a ‚Äútrainband‚Äù made a farce out of the escort duty. Certainly another reason for the decision was that a company from East Hartford actually did escort duty in 1769 and 1770. Accordingly, Samuel Wyllys and others petitioned the General Assembly. The petition was granted by the Assembly, and Samuel Wyllys, a young man of 32, was elected Captain, William Knox, Lieutenant, and Ebenezer Austin, Ensign. The company was known at this time as the Governor‚Äôs Guard. As Connecticut had two capitals at this time, it was not long before citizens of New Haven, its other capital, felt the need to establish a unit of Governor's Guards composed of their own citizens. The Second Company was organized in New Haven primarily by Benedict Arnold who was elected the company's captain.p.9 Nelson, James L. Benedict Arnold's Navy 2006 McGraw Hill This caused the original unit to take the name First Company Governor's Guard and the new organization to take the name Second Company Governor's Guards. It was in 1778, with the establishment of a unit of Governor's Horse Guards, that the original unit changed its name for the final time to \\"First Company Governor's Foot Guard\\" and the newer unit adopted the name \\"Second Company Governor's Foot Guard\\". Both units of Foot Guard are recognized by the state of Connecticut as separate and distinct entities. The ceremonial uniform of the First Company, as far as can be determined, is substantially the same as the original one, although it has picked up elements from different time periods over the years. Tradition hold that the original uniform was copied from that of the Coldstream Guards, the personal body guard of Queen Charlotte. The uniform consists of a scarlet coat, the tails of which are faced with buff, and a black velvet frond crossed with silver braid. The vest and breeches are of buff, and the leggings are black velvet. The hat, or 'bearskin' as it is known, is of bear skin with a shield in front bearing the State Coat of Arms and supports a red and black feather plume on the side. Enlisted men wear white cross straps. Sergeants dispense with the cross straps and wear a white belt, sword and shoulder scales. Officers wear a black and silver belt, fringed epaulets, and carry a saber instead of a sword. The First Company Governor‚Äôs Foot Guard has been closely connected with many historical events. In 1777, although not obligated to do so, it resolved to join the patriot army at Saratoga. As an advance guard of reinforcements under Captain Jonathon Bull, they were crossing the Rhineback Flats on their way to Saratoga when they were met by a messenger with the good news of Burgoyne‚Äôs surrender. Earlier, at the start of the American War of Independence recognizing that members of the Second Company Governor's Guards were keen to travel to Massachusetts where the fighting had begun at Lexington and Concord, the colonial authorities wished the Guards to remain at home and kept their weapons locked up. On April 22, 1775, Captain Benedict Arnold called his men together at a tavern and successfully demanded the keys to the magazine for his company's weapons or else they would break into the storehouse.p.10 Ibid He reportedly stated, \\"None but the Almighty God shall prevent my marching.\\" During the American Civil War, men of the 2nd Company formed Company \\"K\\" 6th Connecticut Volunteers and fought in 26 battles in the conflict.http://www.footguard.org/histori.html Present day All four units of the Governor's Guards remain active today as subordinate units of the Connecticut Military Department under the command & control of the Connecticut Adjutant General. Their mission today remains primarily ceremonial, but they can be called up to active service to augment the Connecticut National Guard for state emergency operations. They perform their annual training each August at Camp Niantic in East Lyme. Over the years, the location of their headquarters has changed due to space availability and financial costs. Currently, the headquarters are as follows: *First Company Governor's Foot Guard - Hartford *Second Company Governor's Foot Guard - Branford *First Company Governor's Horse Guard - Avon *Second Company Governor's Horse Guard - Newtown In March 2020, the Foot Guard was activated to assist the Connecticut Department of Public Health in configuring and staging their Mobile Field Hospital amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

COSPOL is initiated by the European Police Chiefs Task Force (EPCTF), a council of the national heads of police in Europe. CIRCAMP is aimed at the commercial and organized distribution of child pornography.  Participants  CIRCAMP has 14 national police forces as members, in addition to analytical and operational support from Europol and Interpol. CIRCAMP was co-funded by the European Commission Safer Internet Programme. The participating countries are Norway (Driver/Project manager), UK (Co-driver), Ireland, France, Sweden, Italy, Finland, Belgium, Spain, Malta, Denmark, The Netherlands, Poland, and Germany.  Aims  One of the major ongoing tasks within CIRCAMP is the implementation and further spread of CSAADF, The Child Sexual Abuse Anti Distribution Filter. This is an access blocking methodology targeting only web domains that contain child sexual abusive files. The primary aims of domain-based filtering and displaying a STOP page on the computer or mobile device of an Internet user accessing a web site with child abuse content are: * To prevent the re- victimization of those children who are or have been the victim of abuse. * To prevent accidental access to this illegal and harmful content by the public. * To prevent deliberate access to child abuse material on the Internet. * To reduce the customer base of these illegal websites with the assistance of participating Internet Service Providers ISP.  Arguments against stated aims  It is questionable whether the prevention of re-victimization is a valid aim, as blocking leaves the website online and available for view from people who circumvent the block and who are outside the jurisdiction. There is no empirical evidence to suggest that accidental access is reduced to a significant degree by web blocking. Web blocking is very easy to circumvent, so deliberate access is not prevented by web blocking. There is no conclusive evidence to show to what degree this goal is achieved. Evidence from a project run by the UK police suggests that commercial websites are in significant decline. Still, websites provided by persons with a sexual interest in children or for other reasons have shown little or no decline. Therefore, the number of new websites entered onto the Internet has been reduced, but the problem persists.  Evaluating sites for CSAADF  The police in the member countries, which already have an access blocking system in place, are able to evaluate the content of websites against the national legislation. These websites are found in investigations, exchanged with other law enforcement agencies, or received as tips from hotlines. If the content is found to be illegal to download, possess, or distribute in said country, their domain or URS is added to the list of blocked addresses. The ISPs will then, either by agreement with the police or their obligation by the law, redirect the traffic to another server and display a STOP page. This STOP page will explain the reason for the redirection of traffic, give links to legislation and ways to contact the police where they can contest the blocking. The access blocking of child sexual abuse websites is purely preventive and no investigations against persons are started as a result of redirected Internet traffic, nor is any identifiable information about the Internet user stored.  Cooperation  Although CIRCAMP is a European/Europol police project, they are also cooperating with countries outside of the EU, such as Norway, Switzerland, and New Zealand. The international nature of the Internet demands that policing has an international approach while remaining in accordance with national legislation. CIRCAMP is supporting and cooperating with INTERPOL in its effort to provide ISP and other providers of services on the Internet with a \\"Worst of\\" list of domains containing child sexual abuse material. The work of CIRCAMP countries is essential in the quality control of the INTERPOL list, as specialist national police units on child sexual abuse participate. CIRCAMP is also cooperating in the cross-border commercial exploitation of children in more traditional investigations, and are planning to initiate international investigations against commercial procurers of such material with the aim of blocking the payment possibilities and investigating the persons within these organizations.

It was located south of Petaluma. Its site now lies within the Olompali State Historic Park.

Olompali Park Filled With History, The Coastal Post, Sept. 1997.Olompali State Historic Site Website The Coast Miwok had inhabited a site within the State Historic Park continuously from as early as 6000 BC. Unlike other settlements in the Bay Area that required seasonal migrations for year-round feeding, the resources available around Olompali made the village occupied all year-round. Olompali had been a main center in 1200, and might have been the largest native village in Marin County. According to senior state archeologist E. Breck Parkman, a secret matriarchal society, the M√°ien, existed among the Indian people of the Bay Area, including the Olompali people. Between 1816‚Äì1818, 10 M√°ien women from Olompali were baptized in the Mission San Jose de Guadalupe.E.

After California became part of the United States, its last-standing chief Ynitia (born Huemox) was able to maintain ownership over Olompali. An article of the Marin Journal from March 1911 mentions that relics and remains of the Olompali people were still scattered all across the county.

In an era before extensive financial regulation.and of wide sovereign immunity, it provided a forum for British creditors to co-ordinate their actions during the financial boom from the 1860s to the 1950s. It created an important mechanism through which investors could formulate proposals to deal with the government defaults, particularly in the Great Depression following the 1929 Wall Street crash, including several early debt restructurings. The CFB was a not-for-profit organisation established in 1868. Its formation was triggered by a series of sovereign debt defaults in the mid-19th century. It was incorporated in 1873, under a licence from the Board of Trade, governed by a committee of representatives from brokerages and banks. In early years, bondholders criticised the settlements that it reached with defaulting bond issuers. Decisions to accept a proposal were voted on at public meetings of members, but it was suspected that banks that underwrote the debt were influencing the decisions. To address these concerns, the CFB was reconstituted in 1899 under a private Act of Parliament, the Foreign Bondholders Corporation Act 1898 (61 & 62 Vict. c.149), which gave it the statutory duty to \\"watch over and protect the rights and interests of holders of public securities wherever issued but especially of foreign and colonial securities\\" (Article 4(a) of the Act). A new Council was created with 21 members: 6 nominated by the British Bankers Association, 6 by the London Chamber of Commerce, and 9 co-opted by the Council. Its officers were paid relatively small annual stipends, funded by its members. To assist members to co-ordinate their actions, the CFB collected and disseminated information about the jurisdictions in which its members invested, including confidential information delivered by its agents in some countries. Ots Annual Reports summarised the debt history of relevant countries, accompanied by economic data and political information. It also provided a reading room and library and ran lectures. Most services were free to members, funded by the interest on an initial subscription fund, and, later by including its costs in any settlements made with defaulters. Ad hoc committees were formed on request to deal with specific situations if a country was in difficulties. Representatives of the CFB would deal directly with a defaulting country on behalf of its members, giving it considerable influence. To ensure consensus decisions, one principle followed was equal treatment of all classes of bondholder. The CFB worked with other British associations of investors, including the League Loans Committee, the Chinese Bondholders Committee, and the Committee of British Long-Term and Medium Term Creditors of Germany. In several cases, its actions were co-ordinated with bondholders outside the UK. The CFB maintained good relations with bondholders in other countries, including the bourses in Rotterdam and Amsterdam; Brussels and Antwerp; Frankfurt, Berlin, and Hamburg; Paris; and (to a lesser extent) New York. The CFB also maintained good relations with the British government, particularly HM Treasury and the Foreign Office, but the government was generally reluctant to exert diplomatic influence on behalf of private investors. The CFB's main mechanism to bring defaulting countries to the table was to make it difficult for defaulters to make further borrowings. The CFB exerted social pressure to discourage lending to countries in default until the default was resolved. The London Stock Exchange would refuse to list new securities issued by defaulters, and in extreme cases, it could delist existing securities. A few times, when British diplomatic interests aligned with those of investors, gunboat diplomacy was used: Britain occupied the defaulting Egypt in 1882, and Britain, Germany, and Italy blockaded the defaulting Venezuela in 1902. The differences in practices between investors in the UK and the US often led to conflicting desires, and the Monroe doctrine often allowed countries in Central and South American to default with impunity until Theodore Roosevelt announced in 1905 that Latin American countries could no longer use the US as a shield to avoid their debt obligations. More formal dispute resolution (mediation, arbitration, or litigation) were largely unsuccessful. The CFB became less active after the Second World War, and it became closely aligned with the Bank of England. It was formally wound up in 1988. Its archives are held by the Guildhall Library in London. Related to the CFB is the United States Foreign Bondholders Protective Council (FBPC). In 1933, at the request of the Department of State, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, by Executive Order, created the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council to assist US citizens and creditors in collecting on defaulted foreign government bonds. Prior to formation of the private, non-profit FBPC, no permanent organization existed to negotiate settlements with defaulting debtors. The Council was particularly active before the Second World War and again in the 1970s and 1980s. As recently as 2002, both the Department of State and the Securities and Exchange Commission recommended creditors who hold more than 18,000 Chinese government bonds issued between 1913 and 1942 to seek the FBPC's assistance in negotiating fair settlements.

The Ash Street Jail is one of the oldest operating jails in the United States. It is a medium to maximum-security facility. Every year this facility has 4000 bookings, with a daily average of 200 Inmates. Inmates range from low level misdemeanor offenders to those being held and awaiting trial for violent crimes like robbery, rape and murder. Therefore, the security level must be high. Sheriff Thomas Hodgson is the Sheriff of the facility. The prison facility holds over two hundred prisoners. Of those prisoners, most are awaiting trial, while others are sentenced there to serve sentences 2 ¬Ω years or less. The facility provides in house programs such as educational, substance abuse, and parenting courses. They also offer religious services, bible studies, anger management, AA and NA meetings. The inmates that are serving a sentence enjoy larger cells. History The Ash Street Jail was built in 1888 on the site of the New Bedford House of Correction and the former New Bedford County Jail that was built in 1829. It is currently overseen by Bristol County Sheriff Thomas M. Hodgson, who feels that although he has been heavily criticizedhttp://www.bethdavid.net/1998/AshStJail.html for keeping the 180-year-old facility open, that keeping it open is a good idea because jail should be a place that \\"people don't want to return\\".http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980111/NEWS/301119985&cid;=sitesearch Due to alleged unsafe conditions, including the absence of automatic door locks, the jail has been the subject of lawsuits.

He killed Private William Long and wounded Private Quinton Ezeagwula. After his arrest, Muhammad acknowledged shooting the men. He told police that he had intended to kill as many Army personnel as possible. He had an SKS rifle, a Mossberg 702 Plinkster rifle, two handguns, 562 rounds of ammunition, and military books in his car. Muhammad was charged with capital murder, attempted capital murder, and 10 counts of unlawful discharge of a weapon. Muhammad also reportedly faced 15 counts of engaging in a terrorist act. A convert to Islam, Muhammad had gone to Yemen in 2007 to teach English, staying about 16 months. He was deported from Yemen to the United States, after having overstayed his visa and been detained. In January 2010, Muhammad wrote to the judge in his case. He claimed that he was sent on the attacks by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), and pleaded guilty to the charges of capital murder. He had not consulted with his lawyers, and no independent confirmation of his claim has been made. His father described him as \\"unable to process reality\\". The lead prosecutor for Pulaski County, Arkansas, said about Muhammad's attack, \\"If you strip away what he says, self-serving or not, it's just an awful killing, it's like a lot of other killings we have.\\" His shooting attack was the first of two in 2009 at US military facilities. In the Fort Hood shooting in November, US Army psychiatrist Nidal Malik Hasan shot and killed 13 and wounded 29 other soldiers. A Senate special report chaired by the Independent Joseph Lieberman declared it \\"the deadliest terrorist attack within the United States since September 11, 2001\\".COUNTERTERRORISM LESSONS FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S FAILURE TO PREVENT THE FORT HOOD ATTACK: A SPECIAL REPORT , BY JOSEPH I. LIEBERMAN, CHAIRMAN, SUSAN M. COLLINS, RANKING MEMBER Hasan was charged with murder and was sentenced to death. The Arkansas prosecutor took the Muhammad case to trial in 2011. The defense lawyers said that the young man suffered \\"a delusional disorder\\". During the trial, Muhammad changed his plea to guilty and the prosecutor accepted it. On July 25, 2011, Muhammed was sentenced to life in prison.\\"Breaking News: Little Rock jihadist gets life\\" , Investigative Project At trial, the suspect was charged by the state with capital murder and related charges, not terrorism. Some terrorism experts have noted a connection to other homegrown terror plots in recent years, including targets, ideological motives, and religious inspiration. Other experts stated that the suspect had personal problems, making him vulnerable to recruitment into a fanatical ideology. Shooting =Attack= An SKS rifle, the type used by Muhammad in the attack Muhammad drove by the Little Rock U.S. Army recruiting center at 9112 North Rodney Parham Road near Reservoir Road in a black 2003 Ford Explorer Sport Trac at 10:19 a.m. on June 1, 2009. Private William Andrew \\"Andy\\" Long, 23, of Conway, Arkansas, and Private Quinton I. Ezeagwula, 18, of Jacksonville, Arkansas, were standing outside the recruiting center in uniform, smoking cigarettes. The two victims had completed basic training two weeks prior, and volunteered to work as recruiters, which was not their regular assignment. Muhammad approached them in his vehicle, stopped, and shot them with an SKS rifle. A witness, Lance P. Luplow, heard approximately seven loud bangs and then saw a black truck with tinted windows speeding away, with its tailgate down spilling bottles of water onto the street. Luplow ran to Long, who had been shot several times and appeared to be dead. Ezeagwula was crawling to the door, holding a bloodied ear. Ezeagwula exclaimed: \\"Tell me this isn't real, tell me this isn't real\\". Other soldiers came to perform first aid and attempted CPR on Long. Long was dead upon arrival at a hospital. Ezeagwula, who was shot in his back, head, and buttocks, was rushed into surgery at Baptist Hospital in critical condition. Long's father later remarked: \\"They weren't on the battlefield; but apparently, the battlefield's here.\\" In 2015, the Purple Heart was awarded to those who were shot. =Attempted escape= Muhammad drove away from the scene, hoping to reach Memphis, Tennessee, where he intended to switch cars. With police in pursuit, Muhammad got confused in a construction zone and was captured, eight miles from the recruiting center, near the intersection of Interstate 30 and Interstate 630 in Little Rock. He surrendered to Little Rock police officers without incident. He was wearing an ammunition belt when he exited his vehicle. He said: \\"It's a war going on against Muslims, and that is why I did it\\". He used language \\"indicating an association with jihad\\", and claimed that he had explosives, but none were found. He was found to be in possession of an SKS rifle, a Mossberg 702 Plinkster with scope and laser sight, a .22 caliber handgun, a Lorcin L-380 semi-automatic handgun, 562 rounds of ammunition loaded in magazines, homemade sound suppressors, binoculars, a \\"suspicious\\" package, and two military books. A police search of his apartment turned up Molotov cocktails, homemade sound suppressors, and compact discs labeled in Arabic script. =Motive and other targets= Muhammad later said he intentionally killed the soldiers, and would have killed more people if more had been there. He said that he did not regard his action as murder, because American military actions in the Middle East justify the slaying of Americans. Law enforcement officials said Muhammad had researched various targets around the United States, including military bases, government facilities, and synagogues. The suspect The suspect, Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad, previously known as Carlos Leon Bledsoe, was born on July 9, 1985, in Memphis, Tennessee, to Melvin Bledsoe, a businessman and owner of Blues City Tours in Memphis, TN and his wife Linda. He has a sister Monica. Raised as a Baptist and considered a \\"sunny child\\", he graduated from Craigmont High School in Memphis in 2003. He attended Tennessee State University in Nashville, Tennessee, for several semesters. Bledsoe converted to Islam in 2004 at Masjid As-Salam, a Memphis mosque. He has said \\"I've loved jihad ever since I became Muslim.\\" He became more devout and prayed regularly at the Islamic Center of Nashville, and wore Arab-style clothing. By 2007 he was a deeply religious Muslim and had legally changed his name to Muhammad. =Yemen (September 2007 ‚Äì January 2009)= In 2007, Muhammad traveled to visit Yemen, where he stayed 16 months. He worked as an English teacher and learned how to speak Arabic. While there, in September 2008 he married Reena Abdullah Ahmed Farag, an elementary school teacher from South Yemen. =Detention= In his handwritten letters of May to October 2010, Muhammad claimed to have known people in Yemen who \\"showed him around and helped him get started,\\" but he refused to identify them for what he referred to as \\"security reasons.\\" He said he was on several occasions asked to conduct attacks on the United States, but had to refuse, as he did not know how to use explosives. He said he tried to go to Somalia for the necessary training, particularly how to make car bombs. He wrote in 2010, \\"[H]ad I got this training my story would have ended a lot differently than it's going to end now. My drive-by would have been a drive-in, with no one escaping the aftermath.\\" Muhammad was arrested at a roadside checkpoint in Yemen on November 14, 2008. He had overstayed his visa, did not have the required government travel permits, and was holding a fraudulent Somali passport. According to his 2010 letters about this period, in his car were books about explosives, literature by Anwar Al-Awlaki (the late cleric in Yemen linked to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula), and videos and reading material about \\"Muslim soldiers in different parts of the world\\". Imprisoned for over two months in Yemen, Muhammad said that he was repeatedly interrogated but not subjected to torture. He began his plans for jihad against the U.S. while he was in prison. James E. Hensley Jr., Muhammad's American lawyer after his arrest in the United States, later said that he was radicalized by Islamic fundamentalists while in prison. Under pressure from the United States, Yemen deported Muhammad to the U.S. on January 29, 2008. Because his original plan to travel to Somalia for bomb training had been foiled by his arrest in Yemen, Muhammad said Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) helped him create a new plan of attack. Investigators have not independently confirmed his claims. =Return to the U.S. (January 2009‚Äìpresent)= Muhammad moved in with his parents in Memphis for several months on his return. He moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, in April, where his father opened an office of his tour bus business (Twin City Tours) to provide a job as a driver for his son and create a chance for him to bring his wife from Yemen. Muhammad was investigated by the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force when he returned. The Task Force also investigated the suspect's visit to Columbus, Ohio; authorities had monitored some Somali Americans traveling from there to Somalia to \\"wage jihad.\\" According to Muhammed's seven handwritten letters from May to October 2010, which he sent to The Commercial Appeal newspaper, he described his planning and activities related to his June 2009 attack. He claimed to have bought several used guns as a way to avoid scrutiny, stockpiled ammunition, practiced target shooting, and bought a .22-caliber rifle at Wal-Mart to determine whether he was being watched. Muhammad said in his letters that none of his attacks had gone as planned. His initial plan was to kill rabbis and target Zionist organizations, and to attack army recruiting centers. According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, he used Google Maps to plan attacks on recruiting centers in at least five states (including in New York, Atlanta, Louisville, and Philadelphia). He also intended to target Times Square in New York City, Jewish institutions (including in Atlanta), a day-care center, a post office, and a Baptist church. In an interview, Muhammad said his jihad started in Little Rock. He then drove to Nashville and threw a Molotov cocktail at an orthodox rabbi's house, but the device failed to detonate. He drove to an Army recruiting center in Florence, Kentucky, because it was close to the highway and near the Ohio border. But the center was closed. He then returned to Little Rock, where he shot the soldiers at the recruiting station. He was indicted on one count of capital murder and 15 counts of terrorist acts. =Mention in Congressional hearings= In a March 2011 Congressional hearing addressing the issue of domestic radicalization of Muslims, Muhammad's father spoke of his son's descent into extremism. Bledsoe described his son's religious conversion and travels to Yemen, where he had been \\"trained and programmed\\" to kill. Bledsoe said, \\"Our children are in danger,\\" and that, \\"It seems to me that Americans are sitting around doing nothing about radical extremists. This is a big elephant in the room.\\" On an earlier occasion, Bledsoe had said, \\"If it can happen to my son, it can happen to anyone's son.\\" Legal proceedings Muhammad was charged by the state of Arkansas with capital murder, attempted capital murder, and 10 counts of unlawful discharge of a weapon. Prosecutors sought the death penalty. He was held in the Pulaski County Detention Center, awaiting a scheduled February 2011 jury trial. In January 2010, Arkansas Judge Herbert Wright ordered the State's Public Defenders Commission to pay part of the bill for Muhammad's private attorney. That same month, in a two-page, handwritten letter to the judge in his case, Muhammad changed his plea to guilty. He claimed to be a \\"soldier in Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula\\" (AQAP), and described the recruiting office shooting as a \\"Jihadi attack.\\" He said he was part of Abu Basir's Army, a reference to Naser Abdel-Karim al-Wahishi, the AQAP leader in Yemen. Muhammad affirmed that his sanity was intact, and that he was acting of his own volition in changing his plea. At the time the County Prosecutor Jegley said that he was still intending to go to trial; he would have had to recommend that Muhammed's plea be accepted for the court to do so. He said he was not going to have the defendant determine the course of the trial.Andrew DeMillo, Seattle Times, 22 Jan 2010, accessed 1 January 2013 Muhammad wrote at the time, \\"I wasn't insane or post-traumatic, nor was I forced to do this Act. The attack was justified according to Islamic Laws and the Islamic Religion. Jihad‚Äîto fight those who wage war on Islam and Muslims.\\" Muhammad did not discuss his change in plea with his lawyers ahead of time. Discussing his claim of affiliation with the Al-Qaeda group in Yemen led by al-Awlaki (killed in September 2011) and al- Wahishi, he wrote in his letters of May to October 2010: > Far as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ... yes, I'm affiliated with them. > ... Our goal is to rid the Islamic world of idols and idolaters, paganism > and pagans, infidelity and infidels, hypocrisy and hypocrites, apostasy and > apostates, democracy and democrats, and relaunch the Islamic caliphate ... > and to establish Islamic law (Shari'ah). Muhammad's father Melvin Bledsoe said he doubted whether his son had any such ties. Bledsoe described his son as \\"unable to process reality\\" and being so \\"brainwashed\\" that he wanted to be convicted of terrorism and executed, thus becoming a martyr. Charges and trial The lead prosecutor for Pulaski County, Arkansas, believed Muhammad acted alone, as did other law enforcement officials: \\"If you strip away what he says, self-serving or not, it's just an awful killing, it's like a lot of other killings we have.\\" They and his father Melvin Bledsoe said there was no evidence Muhammad was ever in contact with Anwar al-Awlaki. In June 2010, Muhammad was charged with assaulting an inmate with a weapon fashioned out of eyeglasses, after a similar attack on a jail officer in April. Both the prosecutor and Muhammad's lawyers wanted to go to trial, which finally started in 2011. His lawyers defended him on the grounds that he suffered \\"a delusional disorder.\\" During the trial, Muhammad changed his plea to guilty. On July 25, 2011, the judge sentenced Muhammed to life in prison. Significance The suspect was noted in early press accounts as among recent Muslim converts planning or carrying out violent attacks that security experts called a disturbing new domestic trend. The attack came less than two weeks after a foiled bomb plot on two synagogues in Riverdale, New York, led by four men with records of incarceration, drug abuse and mental illness. Although the four men were originally identified by some sources as having converted to Islam in prison or shortly after their incarcerations, the New York Times reported that their religious affiliation was uncertain, and they had never served together in prison. Two had registered as Baptist and one as Catholic in earlier prison terms; one said he had converted to Islam and another listed no religion. They had no ties to any international terrorist organization. The New York Times noted of Muhammad's alleged ties to Al-Qaeda, \\"If evidence emerges that his claim is true, it will give the June 1, 2009, shooting in Little Rock new significance at a time when Yemen is being more closely scrutinized as a source of terrorist plots against the United States.\\" No additional evidence at trial has confirmed Muhammed's claims and he was not charged with terrorism. Some terrorism experts thought there was a connection in Muhammed's case to other homegrown terror plots in recent years, including targets, ideological motives and religious inspiration. Neil Livingstone, a terrorism consultant, said that people on the margins of society are \\"easy marks\\" for recruiters offering them ideological and fanatical religious justifications for violence, noting \\"Most of these guys ‚Äî I think what it comes down to ‚Äî they're misfits, they believe they've suffered injustice. ... They basically are striking back at society.\\"\\"Little Rock Shooting Suspect Joins Growing List of Muslim Converts Accused of Targeting U.S.\\" , Fox News, 2 June 2009 See also *2015 Chattanooga shootings References External links *U.S. Senate Resolution 186 ‚Äî Condemning the murder of Army Private William Andrew 'Andy' Long and the wounding of Army Private Quinton Ezeagwula, who were shot outside the Army- Navy Career Center in Little Rock, Arkansas on June 1, 2009, by Senators Lincoln, Pryor, and Lieberman, June 16, 2009 Category:2009 in Arkansas Category:2009 murders in the United States Category:Attacks in the United States in 2009 Category:Crimes in Arkansas Category:Drive-by shootings Category:History of Little Rock, Arkansas Category:21st-century history of the United States Army Category:Islamic terrorism in the United States Category:June 2009 crimes Category:Military in Arkansas Category:Military recruitment Category:Murder in Arkansas Category:Perpetrators of religiously motivated violence in the United States Category:Religiously motivated violence in the United States Category:Terrorist incidents in the United States in 2009 ","title":"Little Rock recruiting office shooting"},{"id":"23100891","text":"Stefanie Jill Ridel (born May 17, 1973Wild Orchid Biography from Who2.com) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress.

At over 200 members strong and featuring students from every College and Department on campus, the university's marching band celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2007. Southern Pride performs at all home football games, select away athletic events, parades, and as an exhibition band at marching contests throughout the state and region. Southern Pride has also performed at halftime for the Atlanta Falcons, pregame for the Atlanta Braves, and has had members of its drumline perform on the David Letterman Show.  History  With the re-establishment of Georgia Southern football, the Eagles needed the support of a marching band. Dr. Jerrold Michaelson, a professor of music education and percussion, rose the occasion and established the Georgia Southern marching band. The band performed at home football games played at Womack Field on the campus of Statesboro High School (1982-1983) and later Paulson Stadium (1984-2019). At the end of the 1989 football season, both head football coach Erk Russell and Dr. Michaelson stepped down from their leadership roles. Georgia Southern would turn to Dr. Daniel Pittman, who was instrumental in the development of the band program. He established a second concert ensemble, the Wind Symphony, and helped name the marching band. In addition to the \\"Southern Pride\\" name, the band also earned the moniker \\"The Hardest Working Band in Show Business,\\" a reference to the hot temperatures experienced by band members in band camp and afternoon rehearsals. In 1991, Georgia Southern alumnus Matthew Fallin was hired to run the Percussion studio and assist with Southern Pride. Dr. Fallin marched in the first Georgia Southern marching band and returned to Statesboro after pursuing graduate degrees at Louisiana Tech University and the University of Miami (FL). The two directors would go on to double the size of the marching band, with Dr. Fallin taking over in 1994. After 16 years at the helm, Dr. Fallin stepped down as Director of Athletic bands, leading to the hire of Dr. Colin McKenzie. A graduate of Valdosta State, Baylor, and Michigan State, McKenzie would help usher in change in philosophy, adjusting the pregame routine, increasing the number of different halftime themes, and introducing the \\"Script Eagles\\" formation. Dr. McKenzie also lead Southern Pride through its first bowl game appearance, in the rainy 2015 GoDaddy.com Bowl in Mobile, AL. Upon Dr. McKenzie's departure, the band turned to Dr. Derek Shapiro as interim director of athletic bands in 2016. During the 2016-2017 school year, the school began a national search and hired Dr. Daniel Haddad as the 6th director of the Southern Pride marching band.  Pre-Game Routine  Most home games are preceded by a pre-game rehearsal during which the band perfects their pre-game and halftime shows. Approximately 2 hours before kick-off, the drumline helps welcome the Eagle football team to Paulson during the Eagle Walk with a mixture of exercises and cadences. Th e marching band then forms their parade block at the RAC (Recreational Activities Center) and begins the 0.6 mile trek to Paulson stadium. The current pre-game show includes the Georgia Southern Eagles Fight Song, followed by several stand tunes (Go Georgia Southern, Go Big Blue, Eat 'em Up). What follows is the GSU Scramble. During the Scramble, the drumline performs a cadence while band members scatter en route to forming a large G-S-U across the field. A fan favorite, the GSU Scramble has survived across multiple directors. After the scramble, the marching band performs an arrangement of Georgia on my Mind while forming an outline of the state of Georgia, with the trumpet soloist taking the approximate position of Statesboro. Following the playing of the US National Anthem, Southern Pride moves into position to welcome the football team to the field, but not before taking part in the \\"most exciting 30 seconds in college football,\\" Freedom's Flight! Freedom, a full-flight bald eagle housed in the Lamar Q. Ball Raptor Center at Georgia Southern soars over the band as they perform a rendition of The Final Countdown, by the band Europe. Finally, the Georgia Southern Eagles Fight Song is played again as the Eagles enter into the Prettiest Little Stadium in America.\\"  Fight Song  The Georgia Southern Eagles Fight Song was composed by Richard W. Bowles, longtime director of bands at the University of Florida and introduced to Southern Pride by Dr. Jerrold Michaelson, during the band's inaugural season. . It is in the key of B-flat major and in 2-4 time. It consists of 53 measures, including a break strain and coda. When the football team scores 20 points, the drumline switches to the \\"machine gun,\\" a steady streaming of sixteenth notes that mimics an automatic weapon. At 30 points, the drumline switches to \\"shotgun,\\" which consists of everyone playing half notes. Finally, when scoring 40, the drumline switches to \\"artillery cannon,\\" which is simply playing a whole note every measure.  Alma Mater  With music by former Music Department Chair Dr. David Matthew and lyrics by Carol Cain Brown, the Georgia Southern Alma Mater has been played by Southern Pride and sung by the football team at the conclusion of every home (and select away) football game since the hire of head football coach Jeff Monken in 2010.  \\"It is Well\\"  Following the Alma Mater, Southern Pride will perform its rendition of the hymn \\"It is Well.\\" The band uses it as a chorale/warm-up and as a reminder that, no matter the outcome of the game, it's better to lose as an Eagle than win as anything else!

The single also features Charlie Skarbek on vocals. In the spring of 1982 opera singer Louise Tucker met record producer Tim Smit when she accompanied his sister-in-law who'd come to babysit for him: this meeting led to Tucker recording the demo for the track \\"Midnight Blue\\" - which utilized the melody of the second movement of \\"Sonata Path√©tique\\" by Beethoven - with Smit and his friend Charlie Skarbek producing. Smit and Skarbek successfully shopped the track to the Dutch division of Ariola Records and the finished track was cut at Chestnut Studios in Farnham.

He is best known for having given up his York South seat in order to give Conservative leader Arthur Meighen an opportunity to enter parliament only to see the upstart Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) defeat Meighen in a by-election. Cockeram was born in England and emigrated to Canada in 1913, where he found employment with the Canadian Bank of Commerce in Montreal. He later transferred to a bank branch in Brockville, Ontario. When World War I broke out he enlisted as a private in the 21st Battalion of Kingston with which he saw service in France, earned three field commissions, was wounded three times, and awarded the Distinguished Service Order after wiping out a German machine-gun nest.\\"Alan Cockeram, MP 3 times, Former Officer, Mining Executive\\", Globe and Mail, September 12, 1957\\"Col.

In 1929 he joined the Irish Regiment of Canada, becoming lieutenant colonel and commanding officer of the reserve regiment in 1935. He helped organize the defences Halifax at the beginning of World War II. He was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1940 federal election as a National Government candidate, which was the banner under which Conservatives were running in that election. He served as parliamentary whip until he rejoined the Irish Regiment, first battalion for active service in World War II as second-in-command, with the rank of major. He resigned from parliament on November 27, 1941, in order to enable newly elected Conservative leader Arthur Meighen to contest York South in a by-election; however, Meighen was defeated in what had been a safe Tory seat by CCF candidate Joseph Noseworthy in an upset victory which gave the socialist party a major breakthrough in Ontario. Cockeram defeated Noseworthy in the 1945 federal election and was defeated by Noseworthy four years later in the 1949 federal election. Returning to his career in mining, Cockeram served as president of Peruvian Mines and Minerals and of Merchant Mining Ltd. He died in New York in 1957 while en route to Peru.

Its objective was to execute Jews who had recently been deported to Latvia from Germany, Austria, Bohemia and Moravia. These murders are sometimes separated into the First D√ºnam√ºnde Action, occurring on March 15, 1942, and the Second D√ºnam√ºnde Action on March 26, 1942. About 1,900 people were killed in the first action and 1,840 in the second. The victims were lured to their deaths by a false promise that they would receive easier work at a (non-existent) resettlement facility near a former neighbourhood in Latvia called Daugavgrƒ´va (D√ºnam√ºnde). Rather than being transported to a new facility, they were trucked to woods north of Riga, shot, and buried in previously dug mass graves. The elderly, the sick and children predominated among the victims. Background As of February 10, 1942, the approximate ghetto and concentration camp populations of German Jews in Riga and the vicinity were: Jungfernhof concentration camp, 2,500; the German ghetto: 11,000; Salaspils: 1,300. Of the Latvian Jews, about 3,500 men and 300 women were in the Latvian ghetto.Schneider, Journey into Terror, pages 26 and 27. In December 1941, Kurt Krause, whom the author Max Kauffman describes as the \\"man-eater\\", became the German commandant of the Riga ghettos. Krause was a former Berlin police detective. His assistant was Max Gymnich, a Gestapo man from Cologne.Kaufmann, The Destruction of the Jews of Latvia, pages 39 and 43 Krause and Gymnich used dogs to help enforce their commands. A Latvian Jewish survivor called Joseph Berman, is recorded as stating the following about Gymnich: Altogether 20,057 Jews from the Reich were deported to Riga. By February 10, 1942, only 15,000 remained alive. Many had been simply murdered upon arrival; how this had occurred was not known to the people arriving on later transport. According to German ghetto survivor Gertrude Schneider, the inhabitants of the ghetto did not realize how many German Jews had been killed following deportation. They remained under the impression that deportation and forced labor were the worst things that were going to happen:  The D√ºnam√ºnde actions  In March 1942, the Nazi authorities in Riga decided the German ghetto was getting too crowded and organized a massacre which has come to be called the \\"D√ºnam√ºnde Action\\". (The word \\"action\\" was a euphemism employed by the Germans to describe mass shootings and later this was picked up by the ghetto inmates themselves.) The Nazis ordered each of the groups in the German ghetto to prepare a list of between 60 and 120 people for further \\"resettlement\\", with the Berlin group required to name 600. The Nazis informed the Judenrat that the people, who were mostly unable to work, being either elderly, infirm, or mothers with young children, would go to a supposed town called D√ºnam√ºnde to work at fish processing. This was a ruse put together by Obersturmf√ºhrer Gerhard Maywald. There was no longer a town called D√ºnam√ºnde, there had not been one for several decades. The ruse succeeded, many people were anxious to go. Despite the Germans only calling for 1,500 to be selected, Sunday March 15, 1942, saw about 1,900 Jews assembled in the streets of the ghetto, including, as with the Rumbula massacre, many parents with small children. There was to be no resettlement of any kind. Instead the people were taken by motor transport to Biƒ∑ernieki forest on the north side of Riga, where they were shot and buried in common unmarked graves. Angrick and Klein, Die \\"Endl√∂sung\\" in Riga, pages 338 to 345.Kaufmann, The Destruction of the Jews of Latvia, page 47Schneider, Journey into Terror, pages 34 to 37. On March 26, 1942, the same ruse was perpetrated at Jungfernhof concentration camp against the older German Jews. The camp commander, Rudolf Seck, refused young people of working age permission to go with their parents. A total of 1,840 people were \\"resettled\\" from Jungfernhof that day, again to Biƒ∑ernieki forest where they were also shot like the 1,900 German Jews from the ghetto 11 days earlier. The method employed had been designed by the infamous mass murderer Friedrich Jeckeln and was called \\"sardine packing\\" (German: Sardinenpackung).Ezergailis, The Holocaust in Latvia, pages 359 to 360. The historians Richard L. Rubenstein and John K. Roth describe Jeckeln's system: The killers forced the victims to lie face down on the trench floor, or more often, on the bodies of the people who had just been shot. The people were not sprayed with bullets. Rather, to save ammunition, each person was shot just once, in the back of the head. Anyone not killed outright was simply buried alive when the pit was covered up.Einsatzgruppen trial, page 444 After the war, when a number of the Einsatzgruppen commanders were placed on trial before the Nuremberg Military Tribunal in the Einsatzgruppen case, the tribunal found that \\"one defendant did not exclude the possibility that an executee could only seem to be dead because of shock or temporary unconsciousness. In such cases it was inevitable he would be buried alive.\\" Aftermath What had happened to the Jews from the ghetto became known when on March 16 and 17, several vans returned to the ghetto carrying the personal property of the people who had been murdered. The clothing bore mudstains and signs of having been hastily removed. For example, stockings were still attached to garters. A detail was assigned to sort and clean these items, many of the items were recognized by name tags and other indicia of ownership.

The river is over long. Nearby and similar rivers include the Pysht River and Hoko River. Course The Clallam River originates in the Olympic Mountains near Ellis Mountain. It flows generally north collecting tributaries such as Blowder Creek, Charley Creek, Last Creek, and Pearson Creek before emptying into Clallam Bay, part of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The community of Clallam Bay is located at the river's mouth. Natural history The Clallam River supports populations of coho, chum, and Chinook salmon as well as steelhead and coastal cutthroat trout. The Clallam River is unusual in that sands and gravels frequently block the river's mouth. The river's lower course runs parallel to the sea, behind the gravel bars. Over the years the river repeatedly breaks through the barrier in different places, usually during periods of high stream flow. Sometimes migrating fish are trapped behind gravel barriers at the river's mouth. In July 1998 significant numbers of Steelhead trout were trapped in this way. The Pacific Coast Salmon Coalition had a channel cleared through the gravel bar, allowing the fish to escape.

It was first developed and launched in 1928. The farinograph is a tool used for measuring the shear and viscosity of a mixture of flour and water. The primary units of the farinograph are Brabender Units, an arbitrary unit of measuring the viscosity of a fluid. A baker can formulate end products by using the farinograph's results to determine the following: *Water absorption *Dough viscosity, including peak water to gluten ratio prior to gluten breakdown *Peak mixing time to arrive at desired water/gluten ratio *The stability of flour under mixing *The tolerance of a flour's gluten Method The farinograph is drawn on a curved graph with the vertical axis labeled in Brabender Units (BU) and the horizontal axis labeled as time in minutes. The graph is generally hockey-stick shaped, with the curve being more or less acute depending on the strength of the gluten in the flour. The graph is from a gluten rich bread flour, as its stability time is relatively long and the MTI is still above the 500 BU line. A weaker flour, such as a cake or pastry flour with a much lower gluten content would have a much steeper decline after peak time. The points of interest on the graph are fivefold: #Arrival Time (Absorption) - Absorption is the point chosen by the baking industry which represents a target water to flour ratio in bread. This ratio is marked at the 500 BU line and is taken as a rule of thumb for desired taste, texture, and dough performance during proofing and baking. All other measurements are based on this 500 BU standard. (For comparison, the accepted BU is 1000 or greater for noodles). Thus on the graph above, Arrival time is the point on the graph where the top of the curve reaches the 500 BU point and indicates the rate of absorption (minutes/BU). #Peak time - Peak time is reached at the highest point on the curve, and indicates when the dough has reached is maximum viscosity before gluten strands begin to break down. #Mixing Tolerance Index (MTI) - MTI is found by taking the difference in BU between the peak time point (on the graph above 3 minutes, 30 seconds) and 5 minutes after peak time is reached. This is used by bakers to determine the amount that a dough will soften over a period of mixing. MTI may be expressed as a value in BU or as a percentage of BU lost over time (\\\\tfrac{BU^n-BU^{n-x}}{BU^n}). #Departure Time - Departure time is defined as the point at which the top of the curve goes below the 500 BU line. This point is generally considered the point at which gluten is breaking down and dough has become over mixed. #Stability - Stability is the point between arrival time and departure time and generally indicates the strength of a flour (how much gluten a flour has and how strong it is). Applications The Farinograph is used worldwide by bakers and food technicians in building bakery formulations. The farinograph gives bakers a good snapshot of the flour's properties and how the flour will react in different stages of baking, which helps them pick a certain flour for any given purpose. Millers use the Brabender Farinograph to access the properties of the flour, to ascertain whether changes need to be made in the mill. The miller also uses the farinograph to prepare dough for further testing for extensibility after a resting period (akin to proofing) with the Brabender Extensograph. The industrial application of these five points is far reaching. A baker may use, for example, the arrival time as a bare minimum time when planning full product floor time for a batch of dough. A baker may also use MTI as guideline to judge the response of a dough to the addition of other ingredients. Peak time may be used as a target mix time for optimal gluten structure and resilience. Stability may be used as a method of determining desired cell structure before irreparable gluten breakdown occurs. Notes and references Sources *Starch in food: structure, function and applications.

The most famous literary figure in Maithili is the poet Vidyapati (1350‚Äì1450), who wrote his poems in the language of the people, i.e., Maithili, at a time when state's official language was Sanskrit and Sanskrit was being used as a literary language. The use of Maithili, instead of Sanskrit, in literature became more common after Vidyapati. The main characteristics of Magadhi Prakrit is to mutate 'r' into 's', the 'n' for n, of 'j' for 'y', of 'b' for 'y' In the edicts of Ashoka the change of 'r' to 'h' is established. Mahavir and Buddha delivered their sermons in the eastern languages. The secular use of language came mainly from the east as will be evident from the Prakritpainglam, a comprehensive work on Prakrit and Apabhramsa-Avahatta poetry. Jyotirishwar mentions Lorika. Vachaspati II in his Tattvachintamani and Vidyapati in his Danavakyavali have profusely used typical Maithili words of daily use. The Maithili script, Mithilakshara or Tirhuta as it is popularly known, is of a great antiquity. The Lalitavistara mentions the Vaidehi script. Early in the latter half of the 7th century A.D., a marked change occurred in the northeastern alphabet, and the inscriptions of Adityasena exhibit this change for the first time. The eastern variety develops and becomes the Maithili script, which comes into use in Assam, Bengal, and Nepal. The earliest recorded epigraphic evidence of the script is found in the Mandar Hill Stone inscriptions of Adityasena in the 7th century A.D., now fixed in the Baidyanath temple of Deoghar.Choudhary, R. (1976). A survey of Maithili literature. Ram Vilas Sahu. The language of the Buddhist dohas is described as belonging to the mixed Maithili‚ÄîKamrupi language.  Early Maithili Literature (ca. 700‚Äì1350 AD)  The period was of ballads, songs, and dohas. Some important Maithili writers of this era were: * Jyotirishwar Thakur (1290‚Äì1350) whose Varnartnakar is the first prose and encyclopedia in northern Indian language.  Middle Maithili Literature (ca. 1350‚Äì1830 AD)  The period was of theatrical writings. Some important Maithili writers of this era were: * Vidyapati (1350‚Äì1450) * Srimanta Sankardeva (1449‚Äì1568) * Govindadas (late 17th century)  Modern Maithili Literature (1830 AD to date)  Modern Maithili came into its own after George Abraham Grierson, an Irish linguist and civil servant, tirelessly researched Maithili folklore and transcribed its grammar. Paul R. Brass wrote that \\"Grierson judged that Maithili and its dialects could fairly be characterized as the language of the entire population of Janakpur, Siraha, Saptari, Sarlahi, Darbhanga and Madhubani\\".Brass, P.

Personal life Rahman Olusegun Mimiko, also known as Iroko, was born on October 3, 1954, at Ondo Town in Ondo State, Nigeria. His father, Atiku Bamidele Mimiko, was the son of Pa Famimikomi, a son of Chief Ruwase Akinmeji and a grandson of High Chief Adaja Gbegbaje of the Ondo Kingdom.

They have four children. =Education= Mimiko began school at St. Joseph's Primary School Aponmu near Akure, St. Patrick Primary School, Yaba at Ondo in the early 1960s. He attended St. Joseph's College, Ondo from 1966-1971. He was a Higher School Certificate (HSC) Student at the Gboluji Grammar School, Ile-Oluji between 1971 and 1972.

Political career While at university, Mimiko was a member of the Students‚Äô Representatives Council (Parliament), 1975/76, and Chairman of its Special Honours Committee. Asides serving in the Union Legislative House, in 1976/77, he served on the University of Ife Students‚Äô Union Electoral Commission. Between 1977 and 1978, he was the Public Relations Official of the International Students‚Äô Association of the University Mimiko sought political expression and identity in Obafemi Awolowo's Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) during the Second Nigerian Republic. Mimiko took up membership of the party after his return from the National Youth Service scheme. In 1983, Mimiko served as the Publicity Secretary of the Ondo local government chapter of the UPN. The Ondo Study Group (OSG) was created in 1987, and headed by Mimiko. In 1988, the OSG General Assembly urged its members to participate fully in politics, with Mimiko leading the initiative. In 1990, Mimiko was supported unsuccessfully by the OSG to run for office as chairman of the former Ondo Local Government now Ondo East and Ondo West Local Government Areas under the new Social Democratic Party (SDP). Later that year, Mimiko was elected twice and served as an ex- officio member of the SDP Executive Council in Ondo Local Government Council Area. Mimiko was involved in grassroots mobilization and also served as a member of the Party's Disciplinary Committee. Mimiko's OSG played a pivotal role in the organization of Bamidele Olumilua's campaign for the office of the Governor of Ondo State. =Commissioner for Health, Ondo State (now Ondo & Ekiti States) of Nigeria 1992-1993= In January 1992, under the Governor Bamidele Olumilua administration, Olusegun Mimiko was appointed Commissioner for Health and Social Services, old Ondo state, which originally included what is now known as Ekiti State. He facilitated the establishment of a Pharmacy Shop System under which 24-hour pharmacy services were being provided in the main hospitals around the State. In response to the incapacity of the government-owned hospitals to handle accident and other emergency cases, he conceived and facilitated the actualization of what is known as the Accident and Emergency Centres in some of the Ondo State Hospitals. On November 17, 1993, a military Coup d'√©tat led by General Sani Abacha terminated the Third Nigerian Republic and the administration of Governor Olumilua. =Commissioner for Health= In 1999, Mimiko was prevailed upon by Adebayo Adefarati to shelve his gubernatorial ambition for Adefarati's governorship race. Mimiko later stated that he supported Adefarati on the condition that Adefarati would run for one term. Mimiko was appointed Commissioner for Health in the State, making it the second time he would hold the office. Within the first 100 days of Adefarati's administration, the Ministry of Health, headed by Mimiko, completed and equipped the Millennium Eye Centre, Akure. The Festivals of Surgery, which provided free surgical operations were carried out to restore the sight of blind and partially blind patients and to relief those with hernias. Mimiko facilitated the delivery of health services to the innermost parts of Ondo State, providing thousands of rural dwellers with their real first contact with government. By 2002, Mimiko, dissatisfied with the Adefarati government which had become embroiled in the ‚ÄòPlot 90 Gate‚Äô scandal resigned his appointment as State Commissioner for Health. On November 7, 2002 Mimiko formally announced his intention to contest the governorship election on the platform of the Alliance for Democracy (AD). He gave a speech on 19 November 2002, at a Press Conference in Akure, expressing his conviction that for Ondo State, there were ‚Äúbrighter days ahead‚Äù, a catchphrase which coined from the name of his group, Brighter Days Network. Following issues relating to the AD primary elections which he perceived as undemocratic, Mimiko left the party and pulled out his political structure. By 2003, Agagu, the Ondo State gubernatorial candidate of the PDP, having failed to win the governorship election in 1999, needed to forge political alliances with influencers in the State. Mimiko was perceived as crucial to the realisation of Agagu's ambition and an accord was struck with him, which political analysts believe was key to Agagu dislodging Adefarati in the 2003 elections. In April 2003, the erstwhile unpopular PDP won, and Olusegun Agagu became the Governor of Ondo State. =Secretary to the Ondo State Government= Mimiko was appointed as the Secretary to the Ondo State Government (SSG) in 2003. He held this position until July 2005, when he was appointed by Olusegun Obasanjo as the Federal Minister of Lands, Housing and Urban Development. Mimiko as SSG represented Agagu for official duties more often than the Deputy Governor, Otunba Omolade Oluwateru, did. Mimiko was a key player in the formation of the administration's Road Map to Progress, which situated the administration's intended achievements within a specified period of time. The State's initiative to rescue the education sector was Mimiko's brain-child. Mimiko stated later that Governor Agagu's decision to run for a second term came as a surprise to him as he had put aside his gubernatorial ambition to support Agagu on the condition that Agagu would serve a term of office and support Mimiko to take over in 2007. In 2005, after the sack of the Federal Minister of Housing from Ondo State, Alice Mobolaji Osomo, by President Obasanjo, and the disqualification of Governor Agagu's replacement nominee, Ambassador Bayo Yusuf, by the Senate during a screening process, Olusegun Mimiko was nominated by President Obasanjo for the position, and confirmed by the Senate as Minister of Lands, Housing, and Urban Development.Mimiko, Abbas Olubansile. To Live With Happiness. Ibadan: Safari Books Ltd, 2017. Print. =Minister for Housing and Urban Development= Mimiko coordinated the Obasanjo administration's Reform Programme in the Housing and Urban Development sector, bringing about a shift in policy from direct construction of houses by the government, to increased involvement of the private sector; redevelopment of government landed properties through private sector real estate developers to increase housing stock; and a focus on the mortgage sector in the ongoing re- organization of Nigeria's financial system. Mimiko managed the gradual withdrawal of government from direct provision of residential housing to public servants through the monetization policy; the re-organization and re- capitalization of the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria for more robust operation; and the enhancement of the operations of the National Housing Fund (NHF). The re-positioning of the Federal Housing Authority (FHA); the creation of an enabling environment for sustainable mass production of houses through the National Housing Data Bank, and a framework for housing delivery and urban management through co-operatives, and the Social Housing Programme. =The emergence of the Labour party and the 2007 elections= Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, former governor of Ondo State, greets supporters as he drives to the venue of the Labour Party meeting in Ondo Town on June 14, 2018 when he returned to the party Ahead of the 2007 general elections in April, Mimiko resigned from his position as Federal Minister for housing, lands, and urban development on December 8, 2006 to contest for the office of governor of Ondo State. He also resigned from the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Mimiko recalls that President Olusegun Obasanjo pleaded with him and threatened him not to resign from his cabinet to contest against Governor Agagu. According to Mimiko, Bola Tinubu, the then governor of Lagos State, and perceived leader of the strongest opposition party at the time, Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), had offered him the ticket to run under the party. ‚ÄúThey were the two power brokers (Obasanjo and Tinubu), then. The natural thing to do was to go and hide behind these people. Tinubu would give me the ticket and give me money to run and I would be more immune from Baba‚Äôs (Obasanjo's) bullets. I didn‚Äôt go to him; I stood on my own.‚Äù With the aid of his political allies, Mimiko formed the Labour Party in Ondo State. Prior to this, it was a relatively obscure party called Party for Social Democrats (PSD), existing only at the national level. Being a completely unknown party in Ondo State, the Labour Party was formally presented by Mimiko to a cross-section of his political supporters at Ondo on the 1st of December, 2006.Mimiko, N. Oluwafemi. \\"Party formation and electoral contest in Nigeria: the Labour Party and the 2007 election in Ondo State.\\" Journal of African Elections 6.2 (2007): 114-133. On December 14, 2006, the Labour Party was launched officially in the southwestern state and Mimiko emerged as the Party's gubernatorial candidate at a rally in the Akure city hall and was formally presented to the people by the Labour Party's national chairman, Dan Nwanyanwu. Mimiko set up the party structure, and candidates amidst financial constraints; The leadership of the Labour Party used existing secondary organisations, whose operations were supportive of Mimiko's aspirations. They also used organisational relics of his previous attempts to run for office, the most visible being the Brighter Days Network (BDN), the Forum for the Reinvigoration of Democracy in Nigeria (FORD Nigeria), and the Ondo Study Group (OSG) In the lead up to the 2007 elections, media sources reported that President Obasanjo declared the elections a ‚Äúdo-or- die affair‚Äù for Nigeria and the ruling PDP.

A CARING HEART is an acronym for 'Health Care and Housing Development; Education, Employment and Empowerment; Agriculture and Integrated Rural Development; Road and Infrastructural Development; and Trade, Tourism and Industrialization'.Mimiko, N. O. (2007). Party formation and electoral contest in Nigeria: the Labour Party and the 2007 election in Ondo State. Journal of African Elections, 6(2), 114-133. On April 14, 2007, the people of Ondo state went to the polls. Local and foreign observers declared the elections the worst in the nation's history, falling ‚Äòfar short of basic international and regional standards for democratic elections‚Äô.European Union Election Observation Mission. 2007. Nigeria: Final Report: Gubernatorial and State Houses of Assembly Elections, 14 April 2007 and Presidential and National Assembly Elections, 21 April 2007. Brussels: EU. Two days after the elections, counting of votes was conclude,d and Agagu was declared winner of the election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), under Professor Maurice Iwu. Mimiko challenged Agagu's victory at the courts. After a legal tussle lasting approximately two years, Mimiko reclaimed his mandate with a judgment delivered in his favour by the Ondo State Election Petition Tribunal, July 2008. The judgment was subsequently confirmed in February 2009, by the Court of Appeal, sitting in Benin, Edo State. His legal team included Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN), Yusuf Olaolu Ali (SAN), Oluwarotimi Odunayo Akeredolu (SAN), Tayo Oyetibo (SAN), Femi Falana (SAN), and Dr. Olumide Ayeni. The Labour Party was effectively four months and 14 days old by the election of 14 April 2007. Governor After the Court of Appeal decision, Mimiko became the first and only member of the Labour Party to win gubernatorial office in Nigeria. Mimiko contested as the Labour Party candidate and won re-election on October 20, 2012, for a second term in office, making him the first governor in Ondo State to win a second term election since 1999. His tenure as governor ended on February 24, 2017. Olusegun Mimiko is the first civilian governor to serve for more than four years since the creation of Ondo state in 1976. =Education reforms= At the onset of the Mimiko administration in 2009, national statistics put Ondo State as having a school enrolment record that was the lowest in the southwestern region. Mimiko called his educational intervention policy the 5Is formula; Incentive, Inspection, Institutional Management, Infrastructure development and ICT development. On 16 September 2010, the Quality Education Assurance Agency was established as an autonomous institution with the task of discharging supervisory duties in schools. The administration invested heavily in the provision of free education, free shuttle buses, the renovation of over 300 schools including the merging some primary schools which birthed the Caring Heart Mega primary schools, a major overhaul of the secondary and tertiary institutions, and the creation of University of Medical Sciences, Ondo. Tokunbo Awolowo-Dosunmu, the last child of Obafemi Awolowo, and former Nigerian ambassador to the Netherlands described Mimiko as going a step further of the legacies of Awolowo, particularly in the area of democratising access to education. Mimiko's Mega school model surpasses the UNESCO standard for child-friendly school environment and has attracted national and international recognition as well as criticisms. The 51 schools are across the 3 senatorial districts and have been said to be created in a bid to correct the educational imbalance between the children of the rich and the poor and foster inter-social class relations by making quality primary education accessible to all. Former presidential candidate Tunde Bakare described the Mega school initiative as reminiscent of the late Chief Awolowo's educational development legacy, which fast-tracked the development of the South Western states in the country. In 2009, the state ranked 33 out of the 36 states in Nigeria in the West African Education Council Examinations (WAEC) The administration embarked on a rigorous structural and curricula upgrade in the state secondary schools, and a free education policy with the state government paying all external examination fees such as National Examination Council (Nigeria) (NECO) and WAEC. By 2016, Ondo state was in 7th position in the West African Examination Council results. Free shuttle buses On June 12, 2012, widely seen by the Nigerian people as the true Democracy Day in remembrance of Moshood Abiola, Mimiko flagged off the Free School Shuttle buses for all primary and secondary school students. By 2016, 100 free shuttle buses ran throughout the state and 53,000 students in private and state owned schools across the state had benefited from the scheme. The project was implemented to encourage school attendance and improve punctuality by alleviating the financial burden of education on parents and relieving many students of the realities of trekking long and exhausting distances to school. In Mimiko's words, ‚ÄúThe Mega School and free shuttle bus concepts were all targeted at bridging the gap between the children of the rich and the poor so that the poor can have a sense of belonging in the society‚Äù. In 2017, UNICEF scored the state highest in health, child survival, effort on nutrition, sanitation and education, Country Representative of the UNICEF, Mr. Mohammed Mallick Fall, noting the free shuttle scheme among other developed social protection policies which the described as \\" resourceful to the actualisation of SDG Vision 2030. Tertiary level interventions The University_of_Medical_Sciences (Unimed), Ondo was established by a bill signed into law in December 2014 by Olusegun Mimiko. It is the third specialized medical university in Africa, the first in West Africa and Nigeria‚Äôs first specialized medical university to be accredited by the National Universities Commission. The University was accredited in April 2015 by the Nigerian Universities Commission. The Mimiko administration‚Äôs reformation of the existing State owned Adekunle Ajasin University (AAU), and the Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo (RUGIPO) was recognized in In 2014 by the United States Transparency International Standards (USTIS) rating Adekunle Ajasin University, as the best state-owned university in Nigeria and Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo, as the best state polytechnic in Nigeria =Kaadi Igbe Ayo (KIA) - The Ondo Residency Card Initiative= In December 2010, Mimiko initiated the first Residency Card Project in Nigeria called the Kaadi Igbe Ayo (KIA) Project (Yoruba: The good-living card), stating that the project was primarily designed for efficient service delivery and not just for identification. This was done in fulfilment of his promise in his inaugural speech delivered at the Akure Township Stadium on February 24, 2009, when he told the crowd, ‚ÄúI want to know all of you by name. I want to know where you live. I want to know what you do for a living‚Ä¶ I want to be able to talk to you one-on-one. I want to know the exact number seeking employment‚Ä¶ I need to know these and many other things to be able to catalyze the joint processes and mechanism for the realization of our collective dream.‚Äù The Kaadi Igbe Ayo is a multi-functional smart card with over 90 applications, and captures information about the citizen, ranging from bio data, occupation, family size, income level, tax records, to health records. Kaadi Igbe Ayo provides access to government services including the Abiye Safe Motherhood programme, free education, micro-credit and economic empowerment schemes, highly subsidised agricultural inputs and supplies. The KIA project has been commended by officials of UNICEF, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Bank, the World Health Organization, and the Department for International Development DFID. In 2013, the Ondo State government formally launched and began implementation of the residency card. Some criticism trailed the enforcement of the card for the State's health services, which the State government addressed, stating that the implementation of the residency card had become an imperative response to the influx of non- residents from neighbouring states, induced by the State's subsidized healthcare services and free maternal health programme. The administration received two international and three national awards for the successful implementation of the residency card between 2013 and 2016. In 2016, Kaadi Igbe Ayo was given the E-Governance Brand of The Year Award by ConsumersNG for being the most proficient multi- application smart card and best e-governance consumer product in Nigeria. As at February 2017, when Mimiko left office, the state government was set to begin the implementation of the card's tax-monitoring feature. =Urban renewal= In 2012, Mimiko was presented with the UN-Habitat Scroll of Honour Award at the 6th Session of the World Urban Forum held in Naples, Italy in September 2012. Mimiko is the second Nigerian to win the award after Akin Mabogunje in 1998. The award is a human settlements award, mostly won by countries, with only a few wins by individuals and institutions since its inception in 1989.https://unhabitat.org/urban-knowledge/awards/ Mimiko's UN- Habitat Scroll of Honour is premised on his bottom-up urban renewal approach to reducing urban poverty throughout Ondo state via his ‚ÄòCARING HEART‚Äô urban development agenda. The Mimiko administration's urban renewal projects are recognized as a repudiation of the ‚Äòtrickle-down-theory‚Äô. They include low income housing, rebuilding of dilapidated schools, revival of the comatose agricultural farm settlements, improved intra and inter-city transportation, skill acquisitions for unemployed youths, citywide infrastructure development, and urban aesthetics. The transformation of the state capital Akure from ‚Äúdeveloping rural community‚Äù to urban city status is arguably one of the most renowned of Mimiko's urban renewal achievements, and one for which he has been conferred with an honorary fellowship award by the Nigerian Institute of Town Planners (NIPT). At a news conference in 2009, Mimiko's presentation of a masterplan to tackle traffic flow obstruction and expand roads was met with scepticism. He announced plans to outlaw the prevalent roadside sale of vehicles, remove hundreds of street traders and artisans from the main roads, and reconstruct strategic roads including the notoriously congested 35 year old Oba Adesida road, and the revered Arakale road, which had been ignored by previous administrations for fear of relocating the sacred shrines. The project was predicted to consume the Mimiko administration and his chances of a second term. Within the first year of the Mimiko administration, 500 buildings were demolished including makeshift workshops and scores of streets traders relocated from the main roads to facilities labelled ‚ÄòCaring Heart Neighbourhood Markets‚Äô. Mimiko's neighbourhood markets are replicated in other major towns including Okitipupa, Ondo City, Ikare, and Owo. Within the same period, the governor conflated several dilapidated primary schools, which were nightly criminal hideouts, into single modern structures tagged ‚ÄòCaring Heart Mega Schools‚Äô. A N350million modern Auto Mart, a Mechanic Village, and a modern public transport hub called the Caring Heart Motor Park, was constructed by the Mimiko administration to relocate the roadside auto- dealers, mechanics, and road transporters. Although the relocation phase was initially met with resistance, the project became a success. The Auto Mart dubbed ‚ÄòCotonou of Ondo‚Äô is the nucleus of vehicle sales in Ondo State, and attracts buyers from neighbouring states. The Mimiko administration expanded, beautified, and electrified the Oba Adesida and Arakale roads among others, compensating affected persons to the tune of N1billion The Dome and International Conference Centre in Akure, popularly called ‚ÄòThe Dome‚Äô, is a 7000 capacity event centre which sits on a 36.05-hectare of land. It was initiated and completed by the Mimiko administration in 2010 and 2015 respectively. It contains the Glass Hall Event Centre designed and built of combined steel and glass materials by Messrs Groupo Systemso of Spain and the three in one Dome Conference Centre. Each dome is linked by tunnels and can hold different events simultaneously with the capacity for interface. It has been described as ‚Äúan engineering and architectural masterpiece‚Äù by the Nigerian Society of Engineers. The centre is projected to generate an average of N45 million monthly from hall rentals alone. In 2015, the Nigerian Society of Engineers conference of 5000 delegates was held at the centre. The presence of the International Conference centre generated a wave of urban renewal activities in the city. On August 18, 2014, Mimiko, under a Public Private Partnership, inaugurated the construction of the state's first ever shopping mall. The N1.651bn structure and car park is located within the state-owned Owena Motels. The Akure shopping mall which houses Shoprite and Filmhouse Cinemas (West Africa) opened in 2015. =Agriculture= In 2009 the Mimiko administration established the Ondo State Wealth Creation Agency (WECA) in response to the quest for economic diversification and the creation of employment in areas relating to Agriculture & Food Security. WECA functions to drive industrialization and employment opportunities through platforms and implements policies designed for wealth creation including the aggressive promotion of small scale enterprises and indigenous products and services, and the establishment and management of Ondo State agro allied industries. On 19 May 2014, the administration launched the Profarmers & Agropreneurs Sustainable Scheme PASS. Under the scheme, young graduates are assigned to the state's Agro Business Cities and other units under WECA for training and practical knowledge. In 2016 the Youth development programs of the agency earned the commendation of the African Development Bank. WECA re-modelled the farm settlement concept, introduced by Pa Awolowo under the old Western Region, and established four modern farm settlements called Agro Business Cities (ABCs) in three senatorial districts of the state. Agricultural practices being carried out in the Agro business cities include poultry, fishery, cattle rearing, arable farming, sericulture, and apiculture. In 2016, the facilities and infrastructure at the business cities were commended by officials of the African Development Bank. The Mimiko administration established the Cocoa Revolution Project (CRP), a pilot land restoration program to aid farmers in the development of skills needed to produce premium cocoa beans. The project began with the rehabilitation of the 1,744 hectares Oda Cocoa Plantation in the Akure South area and the Cocoa Catalytic Industry, Idanre. Ondo State signed a Memorandum of Understanding with a United States concern, SPAGnVOLA Chocolatie LLC, on the establishment of a chocolate production facility and a Cocoa training Academy. The collaboration includes the introduction of fair-trade practices and quality controls available in other cocoa producing countries In 2014, CRP produced 4.7 metric tonnes of premium cocoa beans and partnered with the Federal Ministry of Agricultures and Rural Development and several organizations like the IITA, IFAD, USAID, French Association for the International Development of Exchange of Food and Agricultural Produce and Techniques, ADEPTA, and Israeli Fertilizer Production Groups. SPAGnVOLA created the first Nigerian chocolate bar using the CRP Oda premium cocoa beans. In June 2015, the bar won a Chocolate Silver award from the Academy of Chocolate Award, held in London. =Judiciary reforms= On 2 September 2011, Mimiko presented a review of the state laws in use since 1978. The Revised Edition of the laws is published in 500 volumes; it is a compendium of all the laws made in the state from its creation in 1978 to 2006. The revised laws became operational on September 20, 2011. Nigeria's first prison High court was established by Mimiko. The Court-in‚ÄìPrison programme is a feature of the Ondo Rapid Justice System programme introduced in 2012, to accelerate the dispensation of justice, and decongest the state's prisons. On April 2, 2012, the State High Court in the premises of the Head Office of the Nigerian Prisons Service NPS, Olokuta Medium Security Prison, Akure commenced operation.http://thehopenewspapers.com/2015/11/prisons-should- be-reformatory-jegede/ Under the Mimiko administration the State Customary Court of Appeal, eighteen new Magistrate Courts, and two High Courts in Idanre and Ifedore Local Government areas were established. The administration carried out a renovation of all the High Courts and Magistrate courts in the State, and attracted the Federal High Court and the National Industrial Court to Ondo State. Mimiko was instrumental in bringing the Akure Division of the Court of Appeal to Ondo State. https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/news/law/court- of-appeal-waxing-stronger-@-41/184204.html On November 14, 2015, the Ondo State House of Assembly passed into Law the Bill for Administration of Criminal Justice 2015, to address the issue of delays in the administration of justice.https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/news/general/ondo-assembly-passes- criminal-justice-bill-into-law/119946.html References External links * http://olusegunmimiko.org Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Yoruba politicians Category:Governors of Ondo State Category:Labour Party (Nigeria) politicians ","title":"Olusegun Mimiko"},{"id":"23101174","text":"Crusader Field is a ballpark located in Irving, Texas.

Such population are highly variable, with the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of individuals ranging widely between the two parent types. Hybrid swarms thus blur the boundary between the parent taxa. Precise definitions of which populations can be classified as hybrid swarms vary, with some specifying simply that all members of a population should be hybrids, while others differ in whether all members should have the same or different levels of hybridization. Hybrid swarms occur when the hybrid is viable and at least as vigorous as its parent types; and there are no barriers to crossbreeding between the hybrid and parent types. Swarms cannot occur if one of these conditions is not met: if the hybrid type has low viability, the hybrid population cannot maintain itself except by further hybridisation of the parent types, resulting in a hybrid population of low variability. On the other hand, if hybrids are vigorous but cannot backcross with parent populations, the result is hybrid speciation, which, aside from the contribution of new hybrids, evolves independently of its parent types. In either situation, it is possible for the hybrid population to overtake the parent populations. In some cases, this can even occur within the span of just a few generations. If the hybrid species has the greater viability, they can simply outcompete the parent species for resources, resulting in competitive exclusion, whereas if the parent species has the greater viability, gene flow between the two populations can result in decreased genetic variation. Hybrid swarms form within hybrid zones, an area where two similar species come into contact and hybridize. These develop as a result of secondary contact between the parent species. After a long period of geographic isolation, the cause of which may be either natural or man-made, the reoccurrence of the parent species in the same environment can lead to interbreeding, hybridization, and potentially, a hybrid swarm. Hybrid swarms can lead to introgressive hybridization, or introgression, in which there is gene flow from the hybrid gene pool to the parental gene pool, or vice versa, occurring due to backcrossing between the populations. When introgression has occurred, there will be a high level of diversity in alleles near the vicinity of the hybrid swarm.  Examples  In plants, it is possible for a hybrid swarm to form between self-pollinating and outcrossing species. One such example is hybridization between the self-pollinating wood aven and the mostly outcrossing water aven in the UK. In one study of a young hybrid swarm of these two species, the population was found to be composed of the parent species, F1 generation offspring, and backcrosses with the water aven, but no backcrosses with the wood aven and no F2 generation, which would result from self-pollinating F1s. Hybrid swarms can also form between domestic and wild species, with one study proposing that wild rice is a hybrid swarm that has genetically mixed with domesticated rice.  Invasive species  Hybrid swarms can pose a significant threat to an ecosystem when they involve invasive species, as invasive hybrids are frequently able to easily outcompete native species. As with other hybrid swarms, the hybrid genotypes may be more or less fit than the parent genotypes. In the event of a particular hybrid genotype having the greatest fitness, not only the native parent species, but also the exotic parent species may be outcompeted. On the other hand, if there is not one dominant genotype but rather trade-offs between different hybrid genotypes, a high degree of variability will occur between the hybrids, native species, and exotic species. One example of an invasive hybrid swarm occurs among shiners in the upper Coosa River. A hybrid swarm was formed between the blacktail shiner, a species native to the river, and the red shiner, an invasive species. The population has expanded its range over time, moving both downstream and upstream while the proportion of hybrid individuals in the system is increasing. In addition, the size of the hybrid swarm has experienced a great degree of flux, experiencing alternating growth and decline over time.

It was established in 1862 and is considered as the oldest polo club of the world in existence.  History  left The modern game of polo, though formalised and popularised by the British, is derived from Manipur (now a state in India) who played the game known as 'Sagol Kangjei', 'Kanjai-bazee', or 'Pulu'. It was the anglicised form of the latter, referring to the wooden ball which was used, that was adopted by the sport in its slow spread to the west. In 1862 the Calcutta Polo Club was established by two British soldiers, Captain Robert Stewart and (later Major General) Joe Sherer. They were inspired by the game in Manipur and later they spread the game to their peers in England. The club runs the oldest and first ever Polo Trophy, the Ezra Cup (1880), besides other old ones such as the Carmichael Cup (1910) and the Stewarts Cup (1932). In earlier days matches were played between various royal dynasties of India. After a period of inactivity, the club was rejuvenated, hosting a two-week polo tournament, the \\"BFL Corporation Polo Season\\", in December 2006.  Activities  Calcutta Polo Club The club provides advanced professional training in polo to aspiring professionals and amateurs. Members can keep their own horses in the club stables, or can book or use any of the horses available in the club. Students can enroll in a special subsidised student training programme in polo. Apart from training, the club organises various polo tournaments, which are mostly held in December in the Pat Williamson Ground, popularly known as Polo Grounds in Kolkata.  CPC's patronage of Ezra Cup  Ezra Cup, the first ever polo trophy in the world, is named after Sir David Ezra, a leading Jewish business tycoon in Calcutta who patronized the sport in the city. The first Ezra Cup was held in 1880\\\\. As part of its 150 years celebration, the Calcutta Polo Club organized Ezra World Cup at the Pat Williamson Ground, Kolkata from 18‚Äì25 December 2011. It has been doing so since 2006 when the game was revived in Kolkata by Calcutta Polo Club president Keshav Bangur. Calcutta Polo Club is in its 150th year making it the oldest polo club in the world still in existence, and the hosts made the 2011 season a treat to remember. Calcutta is also home to the oldest polo ground in the world still in use ‚Äî Pat Williamson, most suited for the Ezra Cup- also the oldest polo trophy in the world. After years of neglect the Calcutta Polo Club was put in cold storage by the army in 1998 through a resolution and the season was revived in 2006, at the initiative of Keshav Bangur. \\"We are happy that the army is cooperating with us to make the season a success now, and hope to get their continued support going forward,\\" said the president of the polo club, well aware of the challenges ahead.  Popularizing polo with masses  Very young kids are made to walk under the feet of polo ponies and mount the horses at the Calcutta Polo Club. \\"We do all this to familiarize the children with the horses. This has to be done so that the children lose their fear. Just after they join, we make the children pass under the horses. Once they climb the mounts, they are made to perform all kinds of exercises. They have to stretch their bodies to either side while controlling the horses. After all, they are being trained for polo where they have to learn other skills apart from riding,\\" said Keshav Bangur in an interview to Times of India. As a part of a range of initiatives from Keshav Bangur of the CPC, which has turned 150 in 2011, a lot is being done promote the sport in the city. The sport of polo has been thrown open to the youngsters. Till recently, polo was considered a sport fit for kings because of being an expensive sport and the middle-class preferred to stay away till Keshav Bangur announced a special scheme for students. \\"All one needs to do is download a form from the internet, fill it up and submit it with a certificate from the school principal. The charges for the two-month course are a bare minimum that any parent can afford. From every batch that comes in, a few stay back to continue with full-fledged polo. The remaining go back trained in riding. In this way, we now have 20 boys and girls playing full-fledged polo,\\" Keshav Bangur said. The CPC have a veteran from the 61st Cavalry of the Indian Army ‚Äî the largest non-ceremonial horse-mounted cavalry unit in the world ‚Äî to handle the training and stabling aspects. While the children are learning the ropes, so are the \\"sahis\\", or helpers. One of them has become a full-fledged polo player already and is eligible to earn Rs 12,500 in any tournament he participates in. \\"Kolkata is now again emerging as an important location for polo. Nowadays, people are coming to the city to purchase polo ponies,\\" Bangur said.  Officials  Keshav Bangur, CEO of BFL Corporation is the president of Calcutta Polo Club. He was instrumental in bringing back the club to its former glories.

His scientific career is spent at the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission as a computational physicist and played a key scientific role his nation's secret nuclear deterrent program. Biography =Early life= Born and hailed from Hoshiarpur in India, Ali was attended the Government College University in Lahore where he graduated with Bachelor of Science (BSc) in physics, and went to attend the master's program in physics at the Punjab University where he graduated with Master of Science (MSc) in physics. He attended the University of Birmingham where he graduated with MSc in nuclear physics. In 1972, he pursued the doctoral studies in physics at the Birmingham University but left his dissertation studies when he learned of India's nuclear test, 'Smiling Buddha' on 18 May 1974. =Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission= After his graduation from Punjab University, Ali found employment with the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) in 1967 as a scientific officer at the Atomic Energy Center in Lahore. He joined the Nuclear Engineering Division alongside with Bashiruddin Mahmood, an engineer, and aided in the investigations on the uranium enrichment under Bashiruddin Mahmood in May 1974. Ali was an original member of the uranium investigation team that was working with Mahmood as a principle investigator under advice from Abdul Qadeer Khan. Ali was posted back to Engineering Division of the PAEC after Abdul Qadeer Khan took over the program after moving it at the Khan Research Laboratories in Kahuta. In 1978, Ali joined the Airport Development Works‚Äî a separate facility working on electromagnetic separation of uranium isotopes independent from Khan Research Laboratories‚Äî functioning under its director, Dr. G.D. Alam, at the Chaklala Air Force Base and assisted Alam in designing of the centrifuge and further in computer programing to control the rotation of the centrifuge. There, Ali learned computer programming from Alam who also taught him about the automatic controls after being posted at the Khan Research Laboratories in 1981.Shahidur-Rehman, ¬ßPAEC contributions to KRL, pp.144-145, isbn, 9698500006 Eventually, Ali lost interest in nuclear physics but found himself working in computer coding and researching on the topics and applications involving the fluid dynamics in the computational physics. In 1982, Ali was in brief conflict with Abdul Qadeer Khan when he was confided about the latter about selling the centrifuge technology to unknown Arab country, and may have be the one who alerted the Zia administration of Khan's motive.Dr. G.D. Alam's interview with Daily Assas, M. Ahmad, 16 December 1998. Following this incident, Ali was transferred at the Directorate of Industrial Liaison until 1985 when he was posted at the Directorate of Technical Development (DTD) where he found himself working as a computer programmer, and aided in developing computer codes for the launch sequences of the missiles. In 1993, Ali accepted the employment with the National Defence Complex, a rocket engine contractor, and played a key role in designing the satellite-based inertial guidance and control system of the Shaheen-I missile system.\\"New Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission head takes up Post,\\" Islamabad APP, 5 April 2006; \\"Former Chairman PAEC Made Secretary Science and Technology,\\" Karachi Dawn (internet version), 7 April 2006; \\"Anwar Ali Takes over as New Chief of Pakistan‚Äôs Atomic Energy Commission,\\" Islamabad The News (internet version), 6 April 2006. In 1996, Ali went to join the DTD, and helped write the computer codes for the nuclear devices‚Äî he was part of the computer programming team that design the codes for the nuclear devices, codenamed: Chagai-I. In 1998, Ali was the Director of the Computation at the Atomic Energy Commission and eye-witnessed the nuclear testing at Chagai Hills, and reportedly quoted: \\"Pakistan has successfully detonated the device and we have made a series of experiments and they have been very successful and the results were as we were expecting and in this series there were six experiments.\\" In 1999, Ali was honored with Hilal-e-Imtiaz (Trans. Star of Excellence) by the President of Pakistan, and remained associated with his nation's strategic program, namely the Shaheen missile system. In 2002, Ali was appointed as chief technical officer ‚Äîlocal corporate designation: Member (Technical)‚Äî at the PAEC, and was rumored to become director of the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL), which was rebuffed by the Government in 2004. Ali, who had been the most senior scientist at the PAEC, was confirmed for the appointment of the chairmanship of the Atomic Energy Commission when the Government of Pakistan announced at the news media on 28 March 2006. Upon taking over the chairmanship, Ali announced that the PAEC has also promoted the utilization of nuclear technologies in other areas, such as agricultural production and for medical diagnosis and therapy. Ali, as chairman of the PAEC, provided strong advocacy for expansion of the commercial nuclear plants to the Government of Pakistan.\\" On 27 January 2006, Anwar Ali, received an invitation letter to visit CERN‚Äì a particle physics facility in Switzerland‚Äì where Ali and Robert Aymar negotiated an agreement between PAEC and CERN to provide financial, technical, and scientific support in the field of novel accelerator, collimator, particle detector and information technologies, as well as through the training and education of scientists and engineers. Under this agreement, Pakistan upgraded the Compact Muon Solenoid and the Large Hadron Collider by designing and developing the particle accelerators as its lead contractor at the CERN. On 5 April 2009, Ali, rumored to be given extension from his three-year chairmanship, was confirmed for his retirement from the PAEC and was succeeded by Dr. Ansar Pervaiz on 7 April 2009.  Controversy in Canada  In 1985, the Canadian government launched an investigation of Ali regarding his visit to the county in July 1980 as reported by the Indian news outlets in 2006. In 1980, Ali, who was serving as the Director of the Directorate of Industrial Liaison (DIL), contracted with the Canadian GE alongside with American firms such as the Westinghouse Electric, RCA Corp., and Motorola, to provide power inverters, capacitors, resistors, Krytron, and other electronic machine parts. The Canadian prosecutors did not identify Ali as a suspect but filed a criminal complaint on three expatriate individuals at the Canadian court, as a Wall Street Journal investigation in 1984, based on court documents and interviews with Canadian officials stated: \\"In July 1980, two members of [the] Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission came here in secret with a high-priority shopping list: vital parts [for] Pakistan‚Äôs fledgling effort to become a nuclear power...... According to court records here, the two Pakistani officials/scientists who came to Canada‚Äì Anwar Ali and I.A. Bhatty ‚Äì brought with them a list of parts needed for a key item embargoed by the U.S. and others, a high-frequency inverter. This exotic electrical device is used to spin a gas centrifuge at extremely high speeds to enrich uranium. The parts were bought from manufacturers, including General Electric Co., Westinghouse Electric Corp., RCA Corp., and Motorola, Inc., by two small electrical equipment stores in Montreal, according to the court papers. Then they were repackaged and shipped on to Pakistan\\". The investigations fell apart when Canadian authorities were unable to establish the link of proliferation between the suspected individuals; the court exonerated the accused individuals from any wrong doings with minor court fees and charges.

It is located in Hernando County north of the city of Brooksville.  History  The area now known as Chinsegut Hill was settled by South Carolina native Bird Pearson as part of the 1842 Armed Occupation Act. Pearson named the property Mount Airy because of the constant breeze on the Hill. He sold it to friend and fellow South Carolinian Francis Ederington in the early 1850s and Ederington built the Chinsegut Hill Manor House which still stands today. Ederington purchased additional land and ran it as a plantation, growing corn, tobacco, cotton, sugar cane and citrus. Ederington's daughter continued to live on the Hill after her marriage to Dr. James Russell Snow, a Confederate soldier from South Carolina. They renamed the property Snow Hill. After a tornado in 1898 blew the house 6 degrees off its foundation, Dr. Snow moved his family to another house on the property. The Manor sat vacant until Elizabeth Robins purchased it for $5,000 as a home for her brother Raymond Robins and herself. Raymond gave it its current name of Chinsegut, which is an Inuit word for \\"The spirit of things lost and regained.\\" Raymond's personal definition was \\"the place where things of value that were lost are found.\\" Elizabeth wrote about her hopes for the property, \\"however reminiscent of people or conditions long since passed away, however much of the spirit of the past is garnered here as living influence, or as debris and as ashes, these were for me infinitesimal affairs by comparison with the hope for the Future‚Ä¶ For this was to be a place where my fellow dreamer and I should not only rest, but having rested, work as never before.\\" Shortly after the property purchase, Raymond met and married Margaret Dreier Robins and they extended and dramatically improved the property in subsequent years.Salzman, Neil V. Reform and Revolution: The Life and Times of Raymond Robins. Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1991. The Robinses also increased the historical significance of the property through their involvement in politics. At Chinsegut Hill the Robinses entertained countless prominent guests including Helen Keller, Jane Addams, William Jennings Bryan, Thomas Edison, James Cash Penney, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Senator Claude Pepper, Soviet ambassadors, Britist Labor Minister Margaret Bondfield, Botanist Dr. John Kunkel Small, and U.S. Secretary of the Interior Harold L.

Using his connections with the Herbert Hoover administration, Raymond eventually brokered a deal to donate the Chinsegut Hill estate to the government with the stipulation that the couple be allowed to live there until their deaths, free of property taxes.Salzman, Reform and Revolution, p. 344-345. By 1932, Robins had donated the house and land back to the federal government for research and philanthropy.

Early life Doherty was the descendant of an old pioneer family that immigrated to Upper Canada from Ireland. His great-grandfather, Bernard Doherty, arrived in York (present-day Toronto) in 1812 and was offered a farm on the land now bordered by Queen Street West, Yonge Street, University Avenue, and College Street - then on the outskirts of town but today the heart of Downtown Toronto. He rejected the offer as too low and wet for agricultural purposes and instead accepted {500 ac [200 ha]) in what is now Peel County.

Situated on the Black River, the park contains both Big Manitou Falls, the highest waterfall in Wisconsin at , and Little Manitou Falls, which is . Pattison State Park was established in 1920. History Pattison State Park is named after Martin Pattison, an early lumber man and miner. In 1879 the company he was working with moved to Superior. After becoming wealthy in the iron mining business, he purchased an entire city block on the harbor where he built the 42-room Martin Pattison House, which is now the Fairlawn Mansion and Museum. In 1917 there was a plan to build a \\"power dam\\" on the Black River. The dam would have destroyed what is known as the Big Manitou Falls. Pattison took the initiative to save the falls by secretly buying land, in total from different land owners along the river. In 1918 he donated the land to the state which led to Wisconsin dedicating its sixth state park to Martin Pattison on January 20, 1920. Until 1935 Pattison State Park consisted of a small picnic area, some wooden overlooks, pit toilets, and a ranger cabin. On July 25, 1935 the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) began renewing the park. The Corps quarried rock and chiseled it into blocks to create the park shelter building, nature center, bathhouse, and former office building. It also drained Interfalls Lake, rerouted the river channel, hauled sand from Lake Superior's shore to make the beach, installed sewer and water systems, removed old roadbeds, planted trees, and landscaped and built three miles of foot trails.

She was the third child but second daughter of Duke Przemys≈Çaw of Racib√≥rz by his wife Anna, daughter of Konrad II of Masovia. Life On 9 April 1313 Euphemia took the veil and entered the Dominican monastery of the Holy Spirit in Racib√≥rz. During her religious life, she was elected Prioress twice, in 1341 and during 1358‚Äì1359. Documents showed her as a person who dutifully cared for increasing the monastery holdings. In 1313, she acquired the villages of Proszowiec, Markowice, Lyski, Pogrzebie≈Ñ and Lubomia from her brother, Duke Leszek of Racib√≥rz. In 1335 Euphemia give to Nankier, Bishop of Wroc≈Çaw the villages of Bie≈Ñkowice, Strzybnik, Sudo≈Ç and Kornowac as a Tithe. In 1337, she bought villages of Ligota and Izoldy to the widow of Piotr Strali, and in 1339 the village of Ucieszk√≥w and half of Warmutowice in Ko≈∫le to a certain Kunada Stosz (or Stoszowice). In 1340 the Dominican Order through Euphemia bought from Henryk z Plumowa and his brother Jeszka the town of Babor√≥w and the villages of Suwa≈Çk√≥w, Czerwiƒôcice and Dziel√≥w. Three years later (in 1343) Euphemia received from her brother-in-law, Duke Nicholas II of Opawa-Racib√≥rz, a large piece of land in Bie≈Ñkowice as her personal fief, but by 1351, the whole of Bie≈Ñkowice was again in possession of the Dominican Order. At that time, Euphemia acted again as a representative of the Dominican Order and sold the villages of Bieniek, Turc and Kobern as the new Tithe given to the Church. On 2 July 1345, Euphemia was authorized by Pope Clement VI to maintain all further acquisitions made by her on behalf of the Dominicans under her direct control. The church and monastery of the Holy Spirit, which were built and consecrated on 29 September 1334, became the center of the religious and cultural life in Racib√≥rz. On 8 December 1358 the dying Euphemia redacted an extensive will, in which were listed all the goods acquired by her. She died a few weeks later, on 17 January 1359 and was buried in the Dominican Chapel of Saint Dominic in the monastery of Racib√≥rz. The later hagiography emphasized Euphemia's devout life, full of self-denial and plenty of Christian virtues. At the beginning of the 19th century, her remains were solemnly moved to the Chapel and deposited in the principal Church in one of the side altars. During the fire at the church in 1945, the altar burned down and Euphemia's remains were lost. Today she is deeply venerated in Racib√≥rz and was a candidate for the altars.

It also served as the spring training facility for the Louisville Colonels and the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League of Major League Baseball in 1895 and 1904 respectively. The ballpark existed near the Houston fairgrounds at the intersection of Travis Street and McGowen Street on the eastern edge of Fourth Ward. Today, Houston's Reef restaurant sat on the location of Herald Park until it closed in 2019. In 2016, the Texas Historical Commission commemorated the ballpark by placing a historical marker on the location. History =Planning and construction= Herald Park was the home of the 1889 Houston Mud Cats team that won the Texas League pennant Texas State Historical Marker for the ballpark On July 2, 1884, a meeting was held in the office J. W. Mitchell that decided to issue 120 shares of stock at $10 each for the purpose of preparing a baseball park. Mitchell, along with W. H. Coyle and Colonel Will Childress headed a committee to sell such shares. Built in a largely unpopulated area of prairie land, on the grounds of the State Fair of Texas, fences and a grandstand were erected on the site by 1885. =Regular use= The ballpark became the home of the semi-professional Houston Heralds club in 1887, and the site became known as \\"Herald Park\\". The Heralds were named as such because their owner, William H. Bailey, also owned the local newspaper called the Houston Herald. Although the Heralds team ceased after that season, many continued to refer to the ballpark by this name well into the 20th century. Two big-league ball clubs barnstormed through Houston in 1887, the New York Giants and the St. Louis Browns, and played at Herald Park. When the Browns played, they faced a team composed of five from the Chicago White Stockings, two from the Pittsburgh Alleghenys, and two from Cincinnati Red Stockings. The Red Stockings as a whole returned to Houston the following season, but this time as the opponent of Houston's first fully professional ball club in their first ever game. Herald Park was the site of the first modern Texas League game between Houston and Galveston on April 1, 1888. Houston won the game 4-1. On April 28, 1889, a mysterious fire burned down the grandstand, the ladies stand, reporters' stand, and soda stand. Rebuilt soon thereafter, none of the property was insured, and an estimated total cost of damage was $1,200 (). The first night game was held at Herald Park on July 22, 1892 when Houston manager John McCloskey ordered arc lights to be placed on the field in a game against Galveston. The Louisville Colonels of the National League became the first big league ball club to come to Houston for spring training in 1895 as Herald Park was their home, while the Chicago White Stockings (now known as the Chicago Cubs) made their home in nearby Galveston. The two teams played each other frequently with the use of the interurban. In 1898, the ballpark received renovations when the left field fence was moved one hundred feet and the diamond moved fifty feet out toward Main Street. A plank for fans to walk from the streetcar landing to the gate was also added. The ballpark served as the spring training facility for the St. Louis Cardinals, also of the National League, in 1904. It was the beginning of a long history of that club with Houston, as they returned for spring training in 1906 through 1908 at West End Park, and then purchased an eighteen percent share of the Houston Buffaloes before making them the first minor league farm team in 1921. =Redevelopment, closure, and demolition= The ballpark's demise was foreshadowed by a 1903 meeting of the Fourth Ward Civic Club, where they advocated removal of the park. Although owned by the Houston Electric Company throughout the majority of its existence, the ball park was sold to a real estate development company before the beginning of the 1904 season. However, on April 5, 1904, it was announced that Houston would continue to use the ballpark at least until August because the developers were not yet ready to build on the site. Throughout the season, development did eventually begin before August, and the size of the field was necessarily modified. Game rules became inventive to accommodate the shrunken size. Houston's professional baseball team played its last game at the park against the Beaumont Millionaires on July 1, 1904. West End Park, the permanent successor to Herald Park, was constructed and opened in April 1905. Notable events =Birth of the \\"Texas Leaguer\\"= Houston center fielder Ollie Pickering set a Texas League record for singles in the season opener game and Pickering's Texas League debut against the Fort Worth Panthers on May 21, 1892 at Herald Park. According to the April 21, 1906 edition of Sporting Life, this game was the origin of the \\"Texas Leaguer\\", a single that falls just outside the infield, because Pickering's first seven at bats were consecutively successful in this manner. This Texas League record still stands today. Other uses =American football= Herald Park also occasionally served as a venue for American football games. Galveston's Ball High School played a game against a team from Houston known as the \\"Olympics\\" on November 26, 1896. The same Houston team then played against TCU in that university's second ever game on December 19, 1896. The next month, the Olympics played Houston High School. Herald Park also served as a neutral football site on several occasions. Texas A&M; was defeated by Sewanee there, but returned for their next game against Tulane to be victorious. Transportation access Herald Park was served by the Houston Electric Company's South End line, which provided street car access during its time. With transfers from Houston's Grand Central Station, this allowed for direct public transportation using interurban lines such as the Galveston‚ÄìHouston Electric Railway and Houston North Shore Railway.

The 11th child of Carlos Gracie, he was the last member of the Gracie family to be trained by his father, and is known to be one of the most technical members of the Gracie family.CARLEY GRACIE The Combat Interview Combat Magazine, Paul Clifton, December 1997 Career Carley was a champion in both jiu-jitsu and vale tudo. He received his jiu-jitsu black belt at the age of 22, and is currently certified a 9th degree Red-Belt by the jiu-jitsu Federation of Rio de Janeiro (the first certifying organization for the sport of Brazilian jiu-jitsu). Carley and his brothers Carlson Gracie and Rolls Gracie favored a much more active, 'warrior style' of jiu-jitsu that encouraged physical prowess and barraging your opponent with a series of attacks. The interest in sharing Gracie jiu-jitsu with the world inspired Carley to leave Brazil and establish his new home in the US and travel the world teaching the art. In 1972, Carley moved to the United States, where he fought challenge matches and trained students up and down the eastern seaboard. Carley was the first member of the Gracie family to teach Brazilian jiu-jitsu in the United States, and gave classes at locations in Virginia and Florida before moving to California in 1979. He opened the first Brazilian/Gracie jiu-jitsu school in San Francisco, California, where he currently teaches.Carley Gracie . URL accessed on June 4, 2009. Legal dispute In 1994, Carley interceded on behalf of much of the Gracie Family in a dispute over use of the Gracie name in jiu-jitsu in the USA. His cousin Rorion Gracie had obtained a federal trademark registration for the term \\"Gracie jiu-jitsu\\" and was demanding that other members of the Gracie family stop using their surname (Gracie) in connection with jiu-jitsu instruction. Carley, who was the first Gracie to teach jiu-jitsu in the United States, challenged Rorion's registration and a lengthy legal battle followed. Carley ultimately won the lawsuit over the Gracie name, when the jury found that Rorion did not have a valid federal trademark registration for the name \\"Gracie jiu-jitsu.\\" The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Carley's favor, affirmed his victory over the Gracie name and ordered the District Court Judge to cancel Rorion's federal trademark registration. The outcome of Carley winning the lawsuit was that all members of the Gracie family could use their name in association with Gracie jiu-jitsu. It is believed that the outcome of Carley's legal victory allowed Gracie/Brazilian jiu-jitsu to expand and grow across the USA and elsewhere in the world.CARLEY GRACIE et al. v RORION GRACIE et al. - Docket Numbers 98-15672, 98-16386 United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit  Instructor lineage  Kano Jigoro ‚Üí Tomita Tsunejiro ‚Üí Mitsuyo \\"Count Koma\\" Maeda ‚Üí Carlos Gracie, Sr. ‚Üí Carley Gracie Personal life Carley Gracie is a resident of the San Francisco Bay Area.

She was appointed by former President Eduardo Duhalde (2002‚Äì2003) and confirmed by presidents N√©stor Kirchner (2003‚Äì2007) and Cristina Fern√°ndez, elected in 2007.  Early years  Noem√≠ Rial was born to a family of Spanish immigrants that arrived in Buenos Aires at the beginning of the 20th century. Her father, Antonio Rial was an usher at the Teatro Astral. He was also a member of Argentina's Socialist Party (PS). However, in the ‚Äò40s he quit the Party because he believed that it no longer stood for the actual interests of Argentine workers. Her mother, √Åurea Garc√≠a, owned a haberdashery and firmly believed in learning as the only way to social ascent. Noem√≠ was born in Buenos Aires, some blocks away from the Argentine National Congress, and spent most of her childhood in the neighborhood. She went to Normal School Nr. 9, ‚ÄúDomingo Faustino Sarmiento‚Äù, where she became a normal teacher. At the time, she wanted to be a doctor. However, she finally decided to study in Law School.  Law School  Noem√≠ Rial at her swear-in ceremony as lawyer (1972) During the 60‚Äôs, Noem√≠ entered the Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA) Law School, and by the end of her studies, she made a thesis on abortion in the Argentine Penal Code. The 70‚Äôs marked the beginning of her interest in politics, as she became a member of Argentina‚Äôs Juventud Peronista. In 1972 she became a lawyer and took a teaching position at the Political Law Department, with professors Hern√°ndez and Sinigaglia. Two years later, the Department was intervened and its teachers, removed. In March 1976, Hern√°ndez y Sinigaglia became two more victims of forced disappearance in Argentina. Professional Activity  During the military dictatorship, Noem√≠ worked as a full-time lawyer, defending individual workers as well as unions. Soon after democracy returned to Argentina, Noem√≠ resumed teaching at the Department of Labor and Social Security of the University of Buenos Aires Law School, where she has been working for the last twenty years. Since then, she has also taught at different post-graduate schools, not only in Argentina, but also in foreign countries. From 1991 to 1993 Noem√≠ Rial was appointed head of the Legal Department of the Argentine National Administration of Health Insurances (ANSAL). Later on, she also worked as an advisor of former Congressman Roberto Dig√≥n, at the Labor Commission of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies. Dig√≥n was one of the main opponents to work flexibilization legislation.  Human Rights  On 27 April 1979 ‚ÄòThe 25‚Äô, a group of young trade union leaders that sought to change Argentine trade unionism, called for the first general strike against the Argentine military government National Reorganization Process. The military government‚Äôs response was brutal: all trade union leaders involved in the strike were sent to prison. Roberto Garc√≠a, from the taxi driver's union, Roberto Dig√≥n from the tobacco employees union and Ra√∫l Ravitti from the Uni√≥n Ferroviaria were among those imprisoned. At the time, a young lawyer undertook the defense of the trade union leaders and managed to set them free: it was Noem√≠ Rial.  International Activities  By the mid ‚Äò90s, Noem√≠ Rial became the first Argentine woman lawyer of the Argentine General Confederation of Labour (CGT). In 1995 she was chosen representative for the worker's group at the International Labour Organization (ILO), a post she held until 2002. From then on, she has been one of ILO's government representatives. Noem√≠ Rial has also been president of ILO‚Äôs Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, and she has had an important role in promoting the re- election of Juan Somav√≠a (2008), the first ILO General Director of South- American origin, and also a supporter of labor as a means of social integration and of social democratic values promotion in South America.  Public activity  In May 2002, Noem√≠ Rial was called by Argentine Labor Minister Graciela Cama√±o to be her Labor Secretary. Thus, she became the first Argentine woman to hold this position La Abogada Noem√≠ Rial fue designada Secretaria de Trabajo, Diario ‚ÄòLa Naci√≥n‚Äô, 8 de mayo de 2002. In the midst of Argentina‚Äôs worst financial and socio-economic crisis, with unemployment rates of up to 22%, both women helped the Duhalde administration implement the largest social contingency plan ever set up by a South American country: the Jefes y Jefas de Hogar Program, reaching more than two million persons. Since May 2003 she has been working with Minister Carlos Tomada at Argentina‚Äôs Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Security. From then on, the main aim of the administration has been the recovery of labor as a central value to generate social inclusion and an active citizenship. To that end, Noem√≠ Rial has had a key role in re-instating collective bargaining as a leading tool for social dialogue, salary negotiation and labor quality. Thus, from a negligible quantity of collective agreements ratified by Argentina‚Äôs Labor Ministry, as of 2008 there were more than 1.500. Politics In May 2009, Noem√≠ Rial became a candidate to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies for the Frente para la Victoria.

In an editorial, the Union Leader stated, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs also a career lobbyist, not in dreaded Washington, but in Concord. But she‚Äôs refused to use that word.‚Äù Rather, Kuster referred to herself as a \\"public policy advocate.\\" Kuster's career has also involved many years of lobbying on behalf of clients such as Merck Vaccines; the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), with which she helped created the NH Medication Bridge program, a public-private partnership that provides free prescriptions to patients in need; Fidelity Investments, with which she helped create the NH UNIQUE College Savings Plan to help families save money for college tax-free; Dartmouth College and Medical School; NARAL Pro-Choice New Hampshire; Bedford Ambulatory Surgical Center; and the New Hampshire College & University Council. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Kuster took $192,553 in contributions from lawyers and lobbyists during the 2010 election cycle. =Rohypnol= In 1998, while working on behalf of Hoffman-LaRoche, Inc., a pharmaceutical manufacturer, Kuster lobbied against HB 1553. The bill would have reclassified three drugs, including Rohypnol, linked to date rapes, assaults, robberies, and driving offenses, as Schedule 1 Controlled Substances, making them illegal to possess. The University of New Hampshire Sexual Harassment and Rape Prevention Program's coordinator called the rescheduling of Rohypnol an ‚Äúimperative,‚Äù as the drug ‚Äúposes an imminent and serious threat to public health and safety.‚Äù Presidential campaigns Kuster's freshman US Congresswoman portrait Kuster served on the New Hampshire steering committees of the presidential campaigns for Barack Obama in 2007‚Äì08 and John Kerry in 2003‚Äì04. Kuster also served as Co-Chair with Peggo Hodes (the wife of Congressman Paul Hodes) of New Hampshire Women for Obama. Kuster was a 2008 delegate for Barack Obama at the Democratic National Convention in Denver and a member of the 2004 New Hampshire Delegation in Boston. In 2020, Kuster endorsed Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg for president, which broke her streak of endorsing the candidate who would ultimately become the democratic nominee. Political positions =Libya= At a town hall meeting in Manchester in November 2013, Kuster fielded questions relating to the Middle East. After reading a written question regarding establishing a select committee to investigate the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Kuster indicated that the questions \\"should stay focused on the Middle East.\\" Audience members replied that Libya is located in the \\"Middle East\\". Libya is generally not included in definitions of the Middle East, it is however part of the Arab world and the Arab Maghreb.The video quickly went viral across the Internet, gaining more than 260,000 views in less than 48 hours. =Health care= Kuster supported the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). In a joint presentation in July 2017, she and Rep. Peter Welch (D-VT) asserted the need to overcome diametrical partisan disagreement on Obamacare and to \\"find common ground in fixing Obamacare\\" by focusing on \\"individual markets.\\" =Sexual assault in the military= On June 27, 2018, an amendment by Kuster addressing so-called ‚Äúcollateral misconduct,‚Äù that is, often minor offense uncovered during probes of sexual violence, was approved for inclusion in defense appropriations legislation. ‚ÄúFor far too long, service members have survived sexual assaults only to suffer in silence,‚Äù said Kuster. ‚ÄúThey've refused to bring their assailants to justice and receive medical attention, not because they fear their attacker but because they fear a military policy, which requires their commanders to punish them for minor violations. I hope that this study will enable the military to make reforms to ensure that no survivor of sexual assault fears coming forward.\\" =Human trafficking= On January 26, 2015, Kuster and Ann Wagner (R-MO) took to the House Floor to urge the passage of the Save Act, which they had introduced to curb human trafficking. ‚ÄúEvery year, thousands of women, children, and men are trafficked around the world ‚Äì even right here in our own backyard,‚Äù said Kuster. In April 2015, Kuster called on the Senate to pass human trafficking legislation that had been languishing for weeks and to strip restrictions added by Republicans. ‚ÄúAll across the nation, victims of sex trafficking are being forced to endure indescribable terrors at the hands of their traffickers,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis bill would help put an end to human trafficking.\\" =Pregnant workers= Kuster was a cosponsor of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which prohibits employers from mistreating pregnant workers. In a December 2014 statement on the Supreme Court case Young V. UPS, Kuster said: ‚ÄúNo woman should ever be discriminated against in the workplace simply because she is pregnant, and I was proud to help send an Amicus Brief to the Supreme Court supporting Peggy Young, whose treatment by her employer clearly violated the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. =Intelligence agencies and privacy= In November 2013, Kuster charged the National Security Agency, which had secretly tapped into data centers operated by Google and Yahoo, with violating privacy. ‚ÄúIt just went way beyond what most people's expectations for privacy are in this country, and I think, despite people's best efforts to protect privacy, things had developed to a place where the American people now want to have a debate and have a conversation,‚Äù Kuster said. ‚ÄúIt's a balancing act between privacy and safety and security of our country....But my point of view is we don't want to lose our liberty in the course of trying to protect our safety.‚Äù This statement came days after she swung her support behind the USA Freedom Act, which would overhaul the NSA and curb its ‚Äúworst excesses.\\" U.S. House of Representatives =Elections= ;2010 In 2010 Kuster ran for against Republican nominee Charles Bass, Libertarian nominee Howard Wilson, and Independent candidate Tim vanBlommesteyn. It was an open seat as Democratic incumbent Paul Hodes was running for the U.S. Senate. Bass defeated Kuster 48%‚Äì47%, by a margin of just 3,550 votes. ;2012 Kuster ran for New Hampshire's 2nd district against Representative Charles Bass again in the 2012 general election. She received the endorsement of Democracy for America, and was selected as one of its Dean Dozen. On November 6, 2012, Kuster defeated Bass 50%‚Äì45%.

This delegation included current Senior Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Junior Senator Kelly Ayotte, and Representative Carol Shea- Porter, who was defeated in the 2014 elections. Hillary Clinton presidential rally at Southern New Hampshire University in 2016. ;2014 Kuster ran for re- election in 2014 against Republican State Representative Marilinda Garcia. In October of that year, State Rep. Steve Vaillancourt, a Republican, compared Garcia's looks favorably to Kuster's in a blog post: \\"Let‚Äôs be honest. Does anyone not believe that Congressman Annie Kuster is as ugly as sin? And I hope I haven‚Äôt offended sin.\\" Garcia replied in a statement that Vaillancourt's comments were \\"sexist and have absolutely no place in political discourse.\\" Kuster beat Garcia 55-45%. Kuster was a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Frontline Program, designed to help protect vulnerable Democratic incumbents heading into the 2014 election. The primary election took place on September 9, 2014, with the general election held on November 4, 2014. Republicans who ran in Kuster's district included State Representative Garcia and former State Senator Gary Lambert. Former U.N. ambassador John Bolton and his super PAC spent $30,000 on a two-week television ad buy opposing Kuster and her response to the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya. ;2016 Kuster ran for re-election in 2016, defeating her Republican opponent, former State Representative Jim Lawrence, 50-45%. ;2018 On June 12, Kuster announced she would seek a fourth term in Congress.

Four Republicans, Robert Burns, Stewart Levenson, Jay Mercer, and Steven Negron, vied to run against her in the general election, while Tom Alciere filed as a Libertarian candidate. Levenson, reported the AP, ‚Äúwas one of the doctors behind a 2017 whistleblower complaint about care‚Äù at the Manchester Veterans Affaird Medical Center, and had ‚Äúaccused Kuster, whom he approached about the issue, of being slow to act on it.\\" Negron won the 4-way Republican primary with 27% of the vote. =Legislation= Representative Kuster has sponsored 11 bills of her own, including: * H.R. 1747, a bill to create a tax credit for businesses cooperating with higher education institutions for the purpose of promoting job training programs, equal to $2,000 per institution, up to $10,000 per business, introduced April 25, 2013 * H.R. 2439, a bill to establish a National Responsible Father Registry, introduced June 19, 2013.

Personal life Kuster is married to Brad Kuster, a fellow lawyer. They reside in Hopkinton and have two sons. Kuster and her mother, State Senator Susan McLane, coauthored a book titled The Last Dance: Facing Alzheimer's with Love and Laughter.The Last Dance: Facing Alzheimer's with Love and Laughter at WorldCat After her mother's death, Kuster and her father, Malcolm McLane, toured New Hampshire speaking publicly about aging and Alzheimer's disease and the resulting burdens on families and caregivers. =Property taxes= In February 2013, WMUR-TV reported that Kuster had been late paying property taxes on a home in Hopkinton starting in 2010 and had failed to pay two tax bills for a property in Jackson in 2012. Following the report, Kuster stated that the bills were being paid. Kuster, whose assets have been estimated at $1.8 million, was reported to have been late on taxes six separate times since 2010, totaling $40,000 in back taxes. Kuster ultimately paid the taxes. When asked why she was consistently late, Kuster stated, ‚ÄúLife is expensive.‚Äù =Sexual assaults= On June 21, 2016, Kuster announced from the floor of the House that she had been sexually assaulted as a college student. ‚ÄúI was an 18-year-old student, going to a dance at a fraternity, to enjoy the evening with friends,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe danced, we listened to music, we enjoyed the party. Until one young man assaulted me in a crude and insulting way and I ran, alone, into the cold, dark night.‚Äù In an interview given the next day, she said the assault was part of ‚Äúa prank‚Äù intended to humiliate her. She also said that when she was 23 and working as an aide on Capitol Hill, her boss took her to dinner with a ‚Äúdistinguished guest of the United States Congress,‚Äù (South African heart surgeon Christiaan Barnard) who, under the table, put his hand under her skirt. Not long after, she was assaulted and mugged on a Washington street. Until these revelations, she had not told anybody about these incidents. She said she had been motivated to come forward by a sexual assault case at Stanford University. After her revelation, her alma mater, Dartmouth College, issued a statement saying: ‚ÄúWe were deeply distressed to learn about Representative Annie Kuster's experiences, but we applaud her courage. Sexual assault is a notoriously underreported crime. At Dartmouth, we want to see the number of reported incidents go up and the prevalence of incidents go down. Although the growing climate of reporting is encouraging, even one sexual assault is too many. It is revelations like Representative Kuster's that demonstrate why we must continue to expand our efforts in prevention, response, and accountability.\\" See also * Women in the United States House of Representatives References  External links  *Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster official U.S. House website *Ann McLane Kuster for Congress - Category:1956 births Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American women politicians Category:American lobbyists Category:American women lawyers Category:Dartmouth College alumni Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Female members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Georgetown University Law Center alumni Category:Living people Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from New Hampshire Category:New Hampshire Democrats Category:New Hampshire lawyers Category:People from Hopkinton, New Hampshire Category:Politicians from Concord, New Hampshire Category:Women in New Hampshire politics ","title":"Ann McLane Kuster"},{"id":"23101973","text":"The Brains is the debut album by The Brains.

About The Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information (CGI) is a working subcommittee of the International Union of Geological Sciences. The Commission meets usually annually, and at the quadrennial meetings scheduled by the IUGS at the International Geological Congress. The Commission is the governing body responsible for the XML-based exchange languages Geoscience Markup Language (GeoSciML - in collaboration with the Open Geospatial Consortium) and EarthResource Markup Language (EarthResourceML). The CGI and its members also play a significant role in the OneGeology initiative. Aims The Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information (CGI) mission is to enable the global exchange of knowledge about geoscience information and systems. Specifically CGI aims to: * Provide the means for transferring knowledge on geoscience information and systems * Stimulate international dissemination of best practice in geoscience information * Stimulate and support initiatives which are developing standards * Establish and occupy an accepted position in the international geoscience information community and represent IUGS on geoscience information matters. Methodology The Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information has created two working groups, the Interoperability Working Group and the Geoscience Terminology Working Group. The Interoperability Working Group aims to develop and test relevant and timely geological information standards. The ultimate objective of the working group is to enable seamless web integration of select information hosted at different locations in varied formats. It aims to achieve this by: * develop a conceptual model of geoscientific information based on existing information models * implement a subset of this model, the Geoscience Mark-up Language, referred to as GeoSciML as an extension of Geography Markup Language * implement an interchange format for geoscience information related to mines and mineral resources (EarthResourceML) * identify areas that require standardised vocabularies in order to enable data exchange and develop vocabularies for populating GeoSciML instance documents. The Multi-lingual Thesaurus Working Group was formed in 2003 to continue work of the Multhes working group of the 1990s. The goal was to enable the global exchange of geoscience information by establishing a common multilingual core vocabulary by developing and expanding the Multilingual Thesaurus of Geosciences. In 2012, vocabulary development activities of the Interoperability Working Group (the Concept Definition Task Group) were merged with the activities of the Multi-lingual Thesaurus Working Group to form a new Geoscience Terminology Working Group that will organize and coordinate ongoing development of geoscience terminology for use in information exchange.

RLVs return to land on the runway. StarTram is a proposed space launch system propelled by maglev. The initial Generation 1 facility would launch cargo only, launching from a mountain peak at an altitude of with an evacuated tube staying at local surface level; it has been claimed that about 150,000 tons could be lifted to orbit annually. More advanced technology would be required for the Generation 2 system for passengers, with a longer track instead gradually curving up at its end to the thinner air at altitude, supported by magnetic levitation, reducing g-forces when each capsule transitions from the vacuum tube to the atmosphere. A SPESIF 2010 presentation stated that Generation 1 could be completed by the year 2020 or later if funding began in 2010, and Generation 2 by 2030 or later. History A track on test model scale for lower velocity magnetic launch assist. A prior concept for likewise a maglev horizontal launch assist system but at far lesser velocity: MagLifter. James R. Powell invented the superconducting maglev concept in the 1960s with a colleague, Gordon Danby, also at Brookhaven National Laboratory, which was subsequently developed into modern maglev trains. Later, Powell co-founded StarTram, Inc. with Dr. George Maise, an aerospace engineer who previously was at Brookhaven National Laboratory from 1974 to 1997 with particular expertise including reentry heating and hypersonic vehicle design. A StarTram design was first published in a 2001 paper and patent,U.S. Patent #6311926: making reference to a 1994 paper on MagLifter. Developed by John C. Mankins, who was manager of Advanced Concept Studies at NASA, the MagLifter concept involved maglev launch assist for a few hundred m/s with a short track, 90% projected efficiency. Noting StarTram is essentially MagLifter taken to a much greater extreme, both MagLifter and StarTram were discussed the following year in a concept study performed by ZHA for NASA's Kennedy Space Center, also considered together by Maglev 2000 with Powell and Danby.NASA: Subsequent design modifies StarTram into a generation 1 version, a generation 2 version, and an alternative generation 1.5 variant. John Rather, who served as Assistant Director for Space Technology (Program Development) at NASA, said: Description =Generation 1 System= The Gen-1 system proposes to accelerate uncrewed craft at 30 g through a long tunnel, with a plasma window preventing vacuum loss when the exit's mechanical shutter is briefly open, evacuated of air with an MHD pump. (The plasma window is larger than prior constructions, 2.5 MW estimated power consumption itself for diameter). In the reference design, the exit is on the surface of a mountain peak of altitude, where launch velocity at a 10 degree angle takes cargo capsules to low earth orbit when combined with a small rocket burn providing for orbit circularization. With a bonus from Earth's rotation if firing east, the extra speed, well beyond nominal orbital velocity, compensates for losses during ascent including from atmospheric drag. A 40-ton cargo craft, diameter and length, would experience briefly the effects of atmospheric passage. With an effective drag coefficient of 0.09, peak deceleration for the mountain-launched elongated projectile is momentarily 20 g but halves within the first 4 seconds and continues to decrease as it quickly passes above the bulk of the remaining atmosphere. In the first moments after exiting the launch tube, the heating rate with an optimal nose shape is around 30 kW/cm2 at the stagnation point, though much less over most of the nose, but drops below 10 kW/cm2 within a few seconds. Transpiration water cooling is planned, briefly consuming up to ‚âà 100 liters/m2 of water per second. Several percent of the projectile's mass in water is calculated to suffice. The tunnel tube itself for Gen-1 has no superconductors, no cryogenic cooling requirements, and none of it is at higher elevation than the local ground surface. Except for probable usage of SMES as the electrical power storage method, superconducting magnets are only on the moving spacecraft, inducing current into relatively inexpensive aluminum loops on the acceleration tunnel walls, levitating the craft with 10 centimeters clearance, while meanwhile a second set of aluminum loops on the walls carries an AC current accelerating the craft: a linear synchronous motor. Powell predicts a total expense, primarily hardware costs, of $43 per kilogram of payload with 35-ton payloads being launched 10+ times a day, as opposed to current rocket launch prices of $10,000 to $25,000 per kilogram to low earth orbit.\\"SpaceCast 2020\\" Report to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, 22 Jun 94. The estimated cost of electrical energy to reach the velocity of low earth orbit is under $1 per kilogram of payload: 6 cents per kilowatt-hour contemporary industrial electricity cost, launch kinetic energy of 38.5 MJ per kilogram, and 87.5% of mass payload, accelerated at high efficiency by this linear electric motor. =Generation 2 System= Artist's impression of StarTram Generation 2, a megastructure more ambitious than Gen-1, reaching above 96% of the atmosphere's mass. The Gen-2 variant of the StarTram is supposed to be for reusable crewed capsules, intended to be low g-force, 2 to 3 g acceleration in the launch tube and an elevated exit at such high altitude () that peak aerodynamic deceleration becomes ‚âà 1g. Though NASA test pilots have handled multiple times those g-forces,NASA: Bioastronautics Data Book SP-3006, page 173, Figure 4-24: Human Experience of Sustained Acceleration the low acceleration is intended to allow eligibility to the broadest spectrum of the general public. With such relatively slow acceleration, the Gen-2 system requires length. The cost for the non-elevated majority of the tube's length is estimated to be several tens of millions of dollars per kilometer, proportionately a semi-similar expense per unit length to the tunneling portion of the former Superconducting Super Collider project (originally planned to have of diameter vacuum tunnel excavated for $2 billion) or to some existing maglev train lines where Powell's Maglev 2000 system is claiming major cost-reducing further innovations. An area of Antarctica above sea level is one siting option, especially as the ice sheet is viewed as relatively easy to tunnel through. For the elevated end portion, the design considers magnetic levitation to be relatively less expensive than alternatives for elevating a launch tube of a mass driver (tethered balloons, compressive or inflated aerospace-material megastructures).Canonical List of Space Transportation and Engineering Methods A 280-megaamp current in ground cables creates a magnetic field of 30 Gauss strength at above sea level (somewhat less above local terrain depending on site choice), while cables on the elevated final portion of the tube carry 14 megaamps in the opposite direction, generating a repulsive force of 4 tons per meter; it is claimed that this would keep the 2-ton/meter structure strongly pressing up on its angled tethers, a tensile structure on grand scale. In the example of niobium-titanium superconductor carrying 2 √ó 105 amps per cm2, the levitated platform would have 7 cables, each of conductor cross-section when including copper stabilizer. =Generation 1.5 System (lower-velocity option)= An alternative, Gen-1.5, would launch passenger spacecraft at from a mountaintop at around 6000 meters above sea level from a ‚âà tunnel accelerating at ‚âà 3 g. Though construction costs would be lower than the Gen-2 version, Gen-1.5 would differ from other StarTram variants by requiring 4+ km/s to be provided by other means, like rocket propulsion. However, the non-linear nature of the rocket equation still makes the payload fraction for such a vehicle significantly greater than that of a conventional rocket unassisted by electromagnetic launch, and a vehicle with high available weight margins and safety factors should be far easier to mass-produce cheaply or make reusable with rapid turnaround than current rockets. Dr. Powell remarks that present launch vehicles \\"have many complex systems that operate near their failure point, with very limited redundancy,\\" with extreme hardware performance relative to weight being a top driver of expense. (Fuel itself is on the order of 1% of the current costs to orbit).U.S. Air Force Research Report No. AU-ARI-93-8: LEO On The Cheap. Retrieved April 29, 2011. Alternatively, Gen-1.5 could be combined with another non-rocket spacelaunch system, like a Momentum Exchange Tether similar to the HASTOL concept which was intended to take a vehicle to orbit. Because tethers are subject to highly exponential scaling, such a tether would be much easier to build using current technologies than one providing full orbital velocity by itself.Paper, AIAA 00-3615 \\"Design and Simulation of Tether Facilities for HASTOL Architecture\\" R. Hoyt, 17-19 Jul 00. The launch tunnel length in this proposal could be reduced by accepting correspondingly larger forces on the passengers. A ‚âà tunnel would generate forces of ‚âà 10-15 g, which physically fit test pilots have endured successfully in centrifuge tests, but a slower acceleration with a longer tunnel would ease passenger requirements and reduce peak power draw, which in turn would decrease power conditioning expenses. Economics and potential The StarTram ground facility concept is claimed to be reusable after each launch without extensive maintenance, as it would essentially be a large linear synchronous electric motor. This would shift most of the \\"requirement for achieving orbit to a robust ground infrastructure,\\" intended to have neither high performance relative to weight requirements nor such as the $25,000 per kilogram of flyable dry weight costs of the Space Shuttle. The designers estimate a construction cost for Generation 1 of $19 billion, becoming $67 billion for passenger-capable Generation 2. The alternative Generation 1.5 design, such as launch velocity, would be intermediate in velocity terms between Gen-1's and the Maglifter design (which had $0.2 billion estimated cost for launch assist in the case of a 50-ton vehicle). Maglifter cost estimates are from 1994. The Generation 2 goal is $13,000 per person. Up to 4 million people could be sent to orbit per decade per Gen-2 facility if as estimated. Challenges = Gen-1 = The largest challenge for Gen-1 is considered by the researchers to be sufficiently affordable storage, rapid delivery, and handling of the power requirements. For needed electrical energy storage (discharged over 30 seconds with about 50 gigawatt average and about 100 gigawatts peak), SMES cost performance on such unusual scale is anticipated of around a dollar per kilojoule and $20 per kW-peak. Such would be novel in scale but not greatly different planned cost performance than obtained in other smaller pulse power energy storage systems (such as quick-discharge modern supercapacitors dropping from $151/kJ to $2.85/kJ cost between 1998 and 2006 while being predicted to later reach a dollar per kJ, lead acid batteries which can be $10 per kW-peak for a few seconds, or experimental railgun compulsator power supplies). The study notes pulsed MHD generators may be an alternative. For MagLifter, General Electric estimated in 1997-2000 that a set of hydroelectric flywheel pulse power generators could be manufactured for a cost equating to $5.40 per kJ and $27 per kW-peak. For StarTram, the SMES design choice is a better (less expensive) approach than pulse generators according to Powell. The single largest predicted capital cost for Gen-1 is the power conditioning, from an initially DC discharge to the AC current wave, dealing for a few seconds with very high power, up to 100 gigawatts, at a cost estimated to be $100 per kW-peak. Yet, compared to some other potential implementations of a coilgun launcher with relatively higher requirements for pulse power switching devices (an example being an escape velocity design of length after a 1977 NASA Ames study determined how to survive atmospheric passage from ground launch), which are not always semiconductor-based, the 130-km acceleration tube length of Gen-1 spreads out energy input requirements over a longer acceleration duration. Such makes peak input power handling requirements be not more than about 2 GW per ton of the vehicle. The tradeoff of greater expense for the tunnel itself is incurred, but the tunnel is estimated to be about $4.4 billion including $1500 per cubic meter excavation, a minority of total system cost. = Gen-1.5 = The depicted sled obtained 2.9 km/s without magnetic levitation, at Holloman Air Force Base.U.S. Air Force: Holloman AFB has also been running a maglev high-speed test track development program. A 2006 report gave Mach 10 velocity (3.4 km/s) as a future goal for the maglev version, for general DoD hypersonic test applications.U.S. Air Force: The current land speed record of 2.9 km/s was obtained by a sled on 5 kilometers of rail track mostly in a helium-filled tunnel, in a $20 million project. The Gen-1.5 version of the StarTram for launch of passenger RLVs at 4 km/s velocity from the surface of a mountain would be significantly higher speed with a far more massive vehicle. However, such would accelerate in a lengthy vacuum tunnel without air or gas drag, with levitation preventing hypervelocity physical rail contact, and with 3 orders of magnitude higher anticipated funding. Many challenges including high initial capital cost would overlap with Gen-1, though not having the levitated launch tube of Gen-2. = Gen-2 = Gen-2 introduces particular extra challenge with its elevated launch tube, levitating both the vehicle and part of the tube (unlike Gen-1 and Gen-1.5 which only levitate the vehicle). As of 2010 operating maglev systems levitate the train by approximately . For the Gen-2 version of the StarTram, it is necessary to levitate the track over up to , a distance greater by a factor of 1.5 million. The force between two conducting lines is given by F=(\\\\mu I_1 I_2 l)/(2\\\\pi r), (Amp√®re's force law). Here F is the force, \\\\mu = \\\\mu_0 \\\\mu_r the permeability, I_1, I_2 the electric currents, l the length of the lines and r their distance. To exert over a distance of in air (\\\\mu_r ‚âà 1) ground I_1 ‚âà 280 x 106A is needed if levitated I_2 ‚âà 14 x 106A. For comparison, in lightning the maximal current is about 105A, c.f. properties of lightning, though resistive power dissipation involved in a current flowing through a conductor is proportional to the voltage drop, high for a lightning discharge of millions of volts in air but ideally zero for a zero-resistance superconductor. While the performance of niobium-titanium superconductor is technically sufficient (a critical current density of 5 x 105 A/cm2 under the relevant magnetic field conditions for the levitated platform, 40% of that in practice after a safety factor), uncertainties on economics include a far more optimistic assumption for Gen-2 of $0.2 per kA-meter of superconductor compared to the $2 per kA-meter assumed for Gen-1 (where Gen-1 doesn't have any of its launch tube levitated but uses superconducting cable for a large SMES and within the maglev craft launched). NbTi was the design choice under the available economies of scale for cooling, since it presently costs $1 per kA-meter, while high temperature superconductors so far still cost much more for the conductor itself per kA-meter. If considering a design with an acceleration up to 10 g (which is higher than the re-entry acceleration of Apollo 16)NASA: Table 2: Apollo Manned Space Flight Reentry G Levels then the whole track must be at least long for a passenger version of the Gen-2 system. Such length allows use of the approximation for an infinite line to calculate the force. The preceding neglects how only the final portion of the track is levitated, but a more complex calculation only changes the result for force per unit length of it by 10-20% (fgl = 0.8 to 0.9 instead of 1). The researchers themselves do not consider there to be any doubt whether the levitation would work in terms of force exerted (a consequence of Amp√®re's force law) but see the primary challenge as the practical engineering complexities of erection of the tube, while a substantial portion of engineering analysis focused on handling bending caused by wind. The active structure is calculated to bend by a fraction of a meter per kilometer under wind in the very thin air at its high altitude, a slight curvature theoretically handled by guidance loops, with net levitation force beyond structure weight exceeding wind force by a factor of 200+ to keep tethers taut, and with the help of computer-controlled control tethers.

The Austrians repulsed persistent French attacks in a struggle in which both sides suffered heavy losses. The engagement, which happened two months after the more famous Battle of Bassano, marked the first tactical defeat of Bonaparte's career and occurred near Bassano del Grappa in Northern Italy during the French Revolutionary Wars. The action was part of the third relief of the Siege of Mantua during the War of the First Coalition. Background See the Arcola 1796 Campaign Order of Battle for a list of the major units of both armies. The second relief of the Siege of Mantua ended dismally for the Austrians after General Bonaparte defeated Feldmarschall Dagobert Sigismund von W√ºrmser's field army at the Battle of Bassano on 8 September. After the battle W√ºrmser elected to dash for Mantua. He reached the place safely only to have his 12,000 remaining soldiers driven into the fortress by the French on 15 September. Within six weeks 4,000 Austrians died of disease or wounds in the overcrowded city. Siege of Mantua map shows important towns in northern Italy. Emperor Francis II of Austria appointed Feldzeugmeister Alvinczi to assemble a new field army and mount the third relief of Mantua. Alvinczi, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Paul Davidovich, General-Major Johann Rudolph Sporck, and Major Franz von Weyrother planned the new operation, which called for a two-pronged offensive.Boycott-Brown, p. 440. Alvinczi accompanied the 28,000-strong Friaul Corps, led by Feldmarschall-Leutnant Peter Vitus von Quosdanovich, as it advanced from the Piave River toward the west. Feldmarschall-Leutnant Paul Davidovich led the 19,000-man Tyrol Corps, which was in the upper Adige River valley. To face these threats, Bonaparte deployed a 10,500-man division under General of Division Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois in the upper Adige valley, 9,500 soldiers led by General of Division Andr√© Mass√©na at Bassano on the Brenta River, and the 8,300 troops of General of Division Pierre Augereau at Verona. General of Division Charles Edward Jennings de Kilmaine with 8,800 soldiers blockaded W√ºrmser's large garrison in Mantua, with a reserve of 1,600 cavalry troopers and General of Division Francois Macquard's reserve of 2,800 foot soldiers. Davidovich's column began moving at the end of October. On 2 November, his corps clashed with Vaubois' outnumbered division near Cembra in the north. By 5 November Davidovich pushed the French out of Trento. Vaubois fell back to Calliano. On 1 November, the Friaul Corps began crossing the Piave. In the face of Alvinczi's westward advance, Massena pulled out of Bassano early on 4 November. General-Major Friedrich of Hohenzollern-Hechingen's advance guard soon occupied the town. Feldmarschall-Leutnant Giovanni Provera with two brigades reached the Brenta farther south near Fontaniva to form Alvinczi's left flank.Boycott-Brown, p. 449. Bonaparte determined to attack the Austrians and called for Augereau and Macquard to join Mass√©na in resisting Alvinczi on the Brenta. Battle =Fontaniva= Bonaparte accompanied Augereau's division as it advanced north-east from Vicenza to Bassano. Mass√©na took a more southerly road and clashed with the Austrian left wing at Fontaniva late on 5 November. General- major Anton Lipthay pulled his troops back to the east side of the river. This set the stage for the battle, which began on 6 November.Boycott-Brown, p. 450. At Mass√©na attacked Lipthay's brigade at Fontaniva. From morning until , the French mounted as many as ten assaults on the Habsburg general's four battalions, with heavy losses on both sides. The 2nd and 3rd battalions of Spl√©nyi Infantry Regiment Nr. 51 gallantly defended the river crossing, losing 9 officers and 657 men out of 2,000 soldiers during the fighting before they were replaced in line by the Deutschmeister Infantry Regiment Nr. 4. Injured when his wounded horse fell on him, Lipthay resolutely remained at his post. In the afternoon, Provera reinforced him with troops from the brigades of Generals-major Anton Sch√ºbirz von Chobinin and Adolf Brabeck as the Austrians successfully held their ground against the French attacks.Boycott-Brown, p. 451. =Bassano= Early in the morning Hohenzollern crossed the Brenta, followed by Quasdanovich's right wing. This wing included General-Major Anton Ferdinand Mittrowsky's brigade, which recently joined the army by descending the Brenta valley. The Austrians anchored their right flank in the Alpine foothills while their left flank curved back to touch the Brenta. Augereau's division began to arrive in the area in mid-morning and attacked Bassano in the early afternoon before all the Austrians crossed the river. After severe fighting, in which the village of Nove changed hands several times, the action ended at One battalion of the Samuel Gyulai Infantry Regiment Nr. 32 suffered 390, or nearly 50 percent casualties.Boycott-Brown, p. 452. Though he issued a report claiming a victory, Bonaparte ordered a retreat that evening. Results French casualties totalled 3,000, including 508 men and 1 howitzer captured. Austrian losses numbered 2,823 and two cannons captured. Provera's left wing lost 208 killed, 873 wounded, and 109 captured. Quosdanovich's right wing suffered 326 killed, 858 wounded, and 449 captured.Smith, p. 126. Though Alvinczi ordered a pursuit, the fast-marching French successfully broke contact and retreated to Verona. On 7 November, Davidovich routed Vaubois at the Battle of Calliano. The two setbacks placed Bonaparte in a dangerous situation, as the two arms of the Austrian offensive threatened to close around him. Meanwhile, W√ºrmser's large garrison remained in his rear.Chandler, p. 105. Alvinczi continued to press ahead, sending Hohenzollern's advance guard to the outskirts of Verona by 11 November. The following day, Bonaparte unsuccessfully attacked the Austrians at the Battle of Caldiero. The French army commander's troubles were far from over. The deciding action of the campaign was the Battle of Arcole on 15‚Äì17 November.

His interest in football (he is a Liverpool fan) and cricket has led to appearances on Radio 5 Live, most notably on Fighting Talk where he has won the Champion of Champions finale twice. He has also appeared on Talksport radio station. He has appeared as a guest on Midweek, Woman's Hour, Broadcasting House and as a political pundit on PM. In March 2011, Sinha presented his own Radio 4 programme, Paul Sinha's Quiz Culture, in which he explored the world of competitive quizzing. His second documentary, The Sinha Test, aired on 14 July 2011 and examined patriotism and sporting allegiance. In July 2012, he presented a programme called The Sinha Games on BBC Radio 4 about the Olympic Games and his experience as a Londoner. In August 2013, Sinha wrote and performed a four part series, Paul Sinha's Citizenship Test. This was aired initially on BBC Radio 4 Extra and then on BBC Radio 4 in September 2013. In December 2014, Sinha created Paul Sinha's History Revision on Radio 4. A second series followed in May 2016, winning the Rose d'Or for radio comedy, and also a third series in 2017. In August 2019, Sinha launched the four part series Paul Sinha's General Knowledge. =Quizzing= After an appearance on The Weakest Link (where he was voted off 4th), Sinha made appearances on University Challenge: The Professionals (lost), Are You an Egghead?

In 2009, Barnette returned to collect coral samples for testing that identified the species as genetically identical to Oculina varicosa found off the eastern coast of Florida. When the Eagle's Nest cave system needed new guidelines in 2007, Barnette and AUE took on the task of replacing the old line as well as removing unnecessary lines. In January 2020, Barnette, along with fellow explorers, discovered what they believed to be a 95-year-old ship, the SS Cotopaxi, which had disappeared near the Bermuda Triangle in 1925. The boat had departed from Charleston, South Carolina, carrying 32 passengers and never made it to its final destination, Havana, Cuba. Barnette sought help from historians and researchers to ensure that it was the SS Cotopaxi. In doing so, he learned that the ship had sent a distress signal two days into its voyage from a location that aligns with where the wreckage was found. The discovery was featured on a February episode of Shipwreck Secrets, a Science Channel series. Barnette has been featured in five television documentaries on shipwrecks associated with the Bermuda Triangle. These that have aired on The Discovery Channel, National Geographic, and The Learning Channel. =Shipwreck identification= Barnette has been active in the identification of numerous shipwrecks that include: * The steamer Arratoon Apcar * The yacht Esmeralda * The tug Gwalia * The tanker Joseph M Cudhay * The steamer Leif Eriksson * The tanker Munger T.

Dating to the 16th century and remodeled between the 18th and 20th centuries, the palace is characterised by its collection of art, including Roman mosaics and other antiquities as well as Asian art, paintings by European masters and European decorative arts. The interior of the palace is decorated in a palette of architectural styles, with elements such as Moorish arches, Plateresque decoration, tilework retrieved from ruined convent, a coffered ceiling from a 16th-century palace and a Renaissance frieze, while its fa√ßade and layout reflect typical Andalusian style. History Construction of the palace as a noble house began in the 15th century, and its fa√ßade was built in the 16th century. The palace went on to be remodelled and extended between the 18th and 20th centuries. When built it belonged to the Paiba family. The palace was then owned by various nobles over the years, including the Count of Corbos and Counts of Miraflores. In 1901 it was bought by Regla Manj√≥n Mergelina, Countess of Lebrija, who restored and reconstructed the palace to house her valuable collection of antiquities. She had a passion for archaeology and adorned the palace with artefacts found during her excavations, as well as those bought from other archaeologists, friends of the countess. The palace covers 2500 m¬≤ across two floors; the ground floor was used during the summer and the upper floor during winter. Collection The azulejos of its walls are of the year 1585. The collection includes Roman mosaics that pave almost the entire ground floor. Spanish historian Juan de Contreras y L√≥pez de Ayala called the building the ‚Äòbest paved house-palace in Europe‚Äô. Of particular note is the mosaic depicting the god Pan that was discovered on land owned by the countess and can be found in the palace‚Äôs central courtyard. The mosaic‚Äôs central medallion represents Pan, who is serenading Galatea on his flute, while the other medallions show the love stories of Zeus and the corners contain representations of the four seasons. Also noteworthy is the opus sectile work, made up of multi-coloured marbles, that paves the entrance hall. The house is filled with Greco-Roman busts, mythological depictions in various forms, and pieces from the Moorish era, China and Persia. There is a fine collection of well curbs, amphoras, columns and sculptures. Paintings of particular importance include original oils by Van Dyke, Brueghel the Elder, and the school of Murillo. On the upper floor there is also a library containing over 6000 books and essays. The Palace Museum In 1999, descendants of the Countess and current owners opened the house to the public as a museum. Visitors may explore the ground floor at will. There are also guided tours of the upper floor throughout the day. The richly appointed rooms on this floor have been left as the family lived in them; they include sitting rooms, a private chapel, dining room and library, all of which contain a multitude of ornaments and major works of art.

Pickett, in command. The marching band makes up one of the twenty-one companies of the South Carolina Corps of Cadets. In 1991, the band participated in the Edinburgh Military Tattoo in Edinburgh, Scotland becoming the first military college selected for the honor. They returned in 2010 as the only unit from the United States to appear at the Silver Jubilee of the Tattoo and appeared again in 2015.  History  The Regimental Band and Pipes, like the other cadet companies, provides its members with opportunities to develop their leadership skills. Many band members and pipers move through the ranks and obtain senior positions of leadership within the Corps of Cadets. Members pursue commissions in the U.S. military and excel in law, government, business, industry, medicine and higher education after graduation. At home on the parade field and in a concert hall, The Regimental Band and Pipes has earned an international reputation as one of the world's premiere military college bands, offering music with great variety and appeal. Members have marched during inaugural parades and national functions and played for the President of the United States on numerous occasions including marching in the Presidential Inauguration Parades of 1953 and 1961. In 1985, the Regimental Band and Pipes travelled to Washington for the Presidential Inauguration but extreme cold weather cancelled the parade. In 1991, the Regimental Band and Pipes became the first military college band ever to be selected to participate in the world-famous Edinburgh Military Tattoo of Scotland - a month-long nightly event of music, pageantry and demonstrations by military organizations from around the world.  Regimental Band  The Regimental Band is made up of about 100 cadet musicians. An important segment of cadet life at The Citadel, the Regimental Band contributes to the morale of the Corps and helps to maintain the martial atmosphere of the campus. The band is an active organization that provides service to The Citadel in many capacities. It performs during the Friday afternoon dress parades, buglers control the daily schedule, and freshman and sophomore cadets from the band perform as the Corps marches to its noon meal during the week. The band is active at football games and inspires Citadel athletic teams and fans with its Pep Band throughout the year. Contributing to The Citadel's annual Christmas holiday celebrations, members form an ensemble that accompanies the many cadet choirs in the Christmas candlelight service. Numerous other events, ranging from holiday parades, formal ceremonies and special events, round out the yearly schedule.  The Citadel Pipe Band  The sounds of bagpipes were first heard at The Citadel in 1955. One of the most easily recognized attractions at the college, the Pipe Band is composed of a drum major and approximately 30 to 35 pipers and drummers. Each fall, the unit recruits pipers from the entering freshman class, many of whom have never played the bagpipes. The colorful unit, led by the kilted drum major in a feather bonnet, is the leading element of the Regimental Band and Pipes. From 1956 until 1981 the bagpipers wore the Royal Stewart tartan. Since 1981, the bagpipers have worn The Citadel's own tartan, which has been duly registered in Edinburgh, Scotland. The Pipe Band is popular at dress parades and other events throughout South Carolina and the nation including the Heritage PGA Tour event at Hilton Head, SC. The Pipe Band is a very active organization that also competes as a Grade IV band at Highland Games all over the United States. Mentored by Sandy Jones one of the nation's premier pipe instructors for more than 25 years, the Citadel Pipe Band is one of the nations finest. The current director of the Pipe Band is Major Jim Dillahey SCM '01,  The Edinburgh Military Tattoo 1991  The Citadel Regimental Band and the Pipe Band were the only American unit invited for the 1991 show, having been invited by the Tattoo's producer, Colonel Leslie P.G. Dow, O.B.E., in March 1990. Both units performed as part of the massed bands and massed pipes. Their performance resulted in the South Carolina Legislature passing a concurrent resolution commending their performance.  The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo 2010  The Citadel Regimental Band and Pipes were selected by the Director of the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo to represent the United States at the 2010 Diamond Jubilee of the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo, a month-long nightly festival of music, pageantry and demonstrations by military organizations from around the world. The festival ran Aug. 6-28 and included nightly performances and concerts in and around Edinburgh.  The Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo 2013  The Citadel Regimental Band and Pipes were the United States representative to the 2013 Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo. The Tattoo, the world's largest annual indoor show, is presented annually the first week each July by the Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo Society with support from the Government of Canada, the Province of Nova Scotia, the Canadian Forces, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Halifax Regional Municipality and the Corporate Community. The Nova Scotia Tattoo was first held in 1979 to mark the visit of HM Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother to Nova Scotia for the International Gathering of the Clans. It has been held every year since and was granted Royal Status by Her Majesty The Queen in 2006 on the occasion of her 80th Birthday.  The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo 2015  Selected for a third time to represent the United States at the 2015 Tattoo, the Regimental Band performed the opening fanfare for the Tattoo's theme \\"East meets West\\" as well as the massed bands finale. Combined with the Citadel pipe band, their own seven-minute segment of the show featured musical numbers reflecting a wide variety of uniquely American music.

While Brazil has a relatively large number of vineyards, a large part of them produce table grapes, and only some produce Brazilian wine. As much of Brazil is close to the equator, most of the country unsuitable for viticulture due to heat and humidity. Most of the wine production of Brazil is concentrated in the south of the country, away from the equator, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, around 29th parallel south, which is close to Uruguay and Argentina. In that area, many of the vineyards take advantage of cooler mesoclimates at higher elevations, to a large extent in Serra Ga√∫cha region. While better quality wines (vinho fino) are produced from the European grapevine Vitis vinifera, in 2003 only some out of Brazil's were planted with such vines. The rest are American vines or hybrid vines, many of which are easier to cultivate under Brazilian growing conditions.  History  Several less successful attempts at introducing European vines into Brazil were made during the centuries. The first vines were brought to Brazil by the Portuguese in 1532, who planted them in the state S√£o Paulo. Jesuits brought Spanish vines to Rio Grande do Sul in 1626, and 18th century settlers from the Azores brought vine cuttings from Madeira and the Azores. 1840 plantations of Isabella (a cultivar of the species Vitis labrusca) on the south coast of Rio Grande are considered the first successful vine plantations in Brazil. By the late 1870s, winemaking was more definitely established and had taken hold in Serra Ga√∫cha, where Italian immigrants did much of the vine-growing, and mostly American vines were produced. Some Italian varieties and Tannat were later added. Wine production with higher quality ambitions started in the 1970s, when several international wine companies such as Moet & Chandon invested in Brazil in the 1970s and brought in know-how and modern equipment.

To comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the district's Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students to increase state funding has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. Belle Vernon Area School District received a $1,533,361 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= The district administration reported that 138 or 4.71% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget In 2009, the district reported employing 242 teachers and administrators with a median salary of $63,330 and a top salary of $122,000. Teachers work a 187-day school year with a 7.5-hour day, including a daily preparation period and a 30-minute duty-free lunch. Additionally, the teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, dental insurance, life insurance, professional development reimbursement, paid personal days, 10 paid sick days, and other benefits. In 2011, the average teacher salary in BVASD was $61,281 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers receive was $17,194 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $76,476. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers‚Äô total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation, including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In 2007 the district employed 156 teachers. The average teacher salary in the district was $56,784 for 180 days worked.Fenton, Jacob, Average classroom teacher salary in Westmoreland County, 2006‚Äì07. The Morning Call. Retrieved March 2010.

The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011‚Äì12. In 2010, Belle Vernon Area School District reported that 827 students received free or reduced-price lunches, due to the family meeting the federal poverty level.Pennsylvania Department of Education, District Allocations Report 2009, 2009‚Äì10 For the 2010‚Äì11 budget year, the Belle Vernon Area School District received a 2.82% increase for $9,908,857 in state Basic Education Funding. The highest increase in Westmoreland County was given to the Yough School District a 7.40% increase in Basic Education Funding. One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase in 2010‚Äì11 went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where a district received at least the same amount as the year before, even where enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some districts at a far greater rate than others. In 2009‚Äì10, Belle Vernon Area School District received a 5.20% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $9,637,413. The highest increase in Westmoreland County went to Southmoreland School District with a 6.44% increase. In Pennsylvania, over 15 school districts received Basic Education Funding increases in excess of 10% in 2009. Muhlenberg School District in Berks County received the highest with a 22.31% increase in funding. Ninety school districts were given the base 2% increase. The state's Basic Education Funding to the Belle Vernon Area School District in 2008‚Äì09 was $9,161,936.72. The amount of increase each school district receives is determined by the Governor and the Secretary of Education through the allocation set in the state budget proposal made in February each year.Governor's Budget Proposal 2010. Office of Budget, released February 2010. In 2008 the district reported that 790 students received a free or reduced-price lunch due to low family income.Pennsylvania Department of Education School Funding report 2010, October 2009 Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004‚Äì2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students, For 2010‚Äì11, the district applied for and received $502,187 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district uses the funding to provide full-day kindergarten and to provide assistance to struggling students. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. Belle Vernon Area School District Administration did not apply to participate in 2006‚Äì07 nor in 2007‚Äì08. Belle Vernon Area School District received $165,458 in 2008‚Äì09. In Westmoreland County, the highest award was given to Franklin Regional School District ‚Äì $412,677. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County ‚Äì $9,409,073. In 2010, Classrooms for the Future funding was curtailed statewide due to a massive state financial crisis. =School Improvement Grant= For the 2010‚Äì11 school year, Belle Vernon Area School District administration applied for a School Improvement Grant. It was eligible for funding due to the chronic, low achievement at Marion Elementary School. The district received $46,180.00 In 2010, Pennsylvania received $141 million from the federal ‚ÄìUS Department of Education, to turn around its worst-performing schools. The funds were disbursed via a competitive grant program. The Pennsylvania Department of Education has identified 200 Pennsylvania schools as \\"persistently lowest-achieving,\\" making them eligible for this special funding. Pennsylvania required low performing schools to apply or provide documentation about why they had not applied. The funds must be used, by the district, to turn around schools in one of four ways: school closure, restart ‚Äì close the school and reopen it as a charter school. The other two options involve firing the principal. One would require at least half the faculty in a chronically poor performing school be dismissed. The second involves intensive teacher training coupled with strong curriculum revision or a longer school day. =Federal Stimulus funding= The district received an extra $2,115,522 in Federal Stimulus ARRA funds in 2009‚Äì2011. This was in addition to all regular state and federal funding. These extra dollars must be focused on programs to improve the academic achievement of low-income students who receive free and reduced-price lunch or special education students. Race to the Top grant Belle Vernon Area School District officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have meant millions in additional federal dollars to improve student academic achievement. The district has been identified as a turnaround school district. This means the district would have received an additional $700 to $900 per student above and beyond the primary grant funding. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. =Common Cents state initiative= Belle Vernon Area School Board elected to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= The Belle Vernon Area School Board set property tax rates in 2011‚Äì12 at 18.2500 mills for residents in Fayette County and 77.6900 mills in Westmoreland County.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, May 2011 A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate ‚Äì land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75 and 85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. The school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, necessitating a state board equalization of the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the board were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2010‚Äì11 ‚Äì 17.0700 mills for residents in Fayette County and 72.9300 mills in Westmoreland County. *2009‚Äì10 ‚Äì 16.3800 mills for residents in Fayette County and 70.4900 mills in Westmoreland County. *2008‚Äì09 ‚Äì 16.5200 mills for residents in Fayette County and 68.4900 mills in Westmoreland County. *2007‚Äì08 ‚Äì 16.1600 mills for residents in Fayette County and 68.4000 mills in Westmoreland County. *2006‚Äì07 ‚Äì 16.3500 mills for residents in Fayette County and 69.7300 mills in Westmoreland County. Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of 0.75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

For 2012‚Äì2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012‚Äì2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011‚Äì12 school year, Belle Vernon Area School Board applied for three exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: Maintenance of Local Tax Revenue; Maintenance of Selected Revenue Sources and Teacher Pension Costs. Each year, the School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. The School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2011. For the 2009-10-year school budget, the Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. =Property tax relief= In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Belle Vernon Area School District was set at $163 for the 115.793 approved primary homesteads and farmsteads.Tax Relief per Homestead May 1, 2010, Pennsylvania Department of Education report. The highest tax relief in Fayette County went to Uniontown Area School District at $202 for 5,550 homesteads. In Westmoreland County the highest tax relief went to New Kensington‚ÄìArnold School District at $300.Tax Relief per Homesteads May 1, 2010, Pennsylvania Department of Education report. In 2009, Belle Vernon was set at $165 for 5,714 approved homesteads and farmsteads.Tax Relief per Homesteads May 1, 2009, Pennsylvania Department of Education report. The tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners must apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least contiguous and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Fayette County, 71% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009 while in Westmoreland County 61% of property owners participatedSpecial Report Pennsylvania Property Tax Relief, Pennsylvania Auditor General Office, Feb 23, 2010. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $632 per homestead and farmstead in 2010.Tax Relief per Homestead 5‚Äì1‚Äì10. Report Pennsylvania Department of Education, May 2010 This was the second year CUSD was the top recipient. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. Enrollment According to Pennsylvania Department of Education enrollment reports, the District's enrollment was 2886 pupils in K‚Äì12 in 2006‚Äì07 school year. Enrollment is projected to decline to 2152 students by 2020. The Class of 2009 has 259 students. The class of 2011 had 212 students. Current elementary enrollment trends mean that the Class of 2020 will have 188 pupils. In 2008, the district administrative costs were $766.94 per pupil. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. A study of Pennsylvania public school spending, conducted by Standard and Poor's, examined the consolidation of school district with low or declining enrollment. The study found that consolidation of the administration with an adjacent school district would achieve substantial administrative cost savings which varied by district. In 2011 the school board approved curtailing the middle school foreign language program and furloughing six teachers as part of its budget process for 2011‚Äì12.Belle Vernon Area School Board Secretary, Belle Vernon Area School Board meeting minutes, May 31, 2011 According to a 2009 school district administration consolidation proposal by Governor Edward Rendell, the excessive administrative overhead dollars could be redirected to improve lagging academic achievement, to enrich the academic programs or to reduce property taxes. Consolidation of two central administrations into one would not require the closing of any schools. The Governor's proposal called for the savings to be redirected to improving lagging reading and science achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing residents' property taxes. Over the next 10 years, rural Pennsylvania school enrollment is projected to decrease 8 percent. As the enrollment declines, per pupil administrative costs of the schools continue to rise. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants released a report finding that the state would save hundreds of millions of tax dollars, by cutting the number of school administrations in half through consolidation, with no impact on programs offered to students. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity.2009‚Äì10 Executive Budget Fast Facts. Pennsylvania Office of the Governor In a survey of 88 superintendents of small districts, 42% of the 49 respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools.

Biography Larry Kent emigrated from South Africa to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in 1957 and immersed himself in the world of theatre. A devout film buff and scholar, Kent made the transition from the stage to screen in the early 60's. Kent wrote and directed the existential Canadian indie, post-beatnik, pre-hippie classic The Bitter Ash in 1962 and tirelessly toured the film despite the controversy it garnered nationwide. Filled with profanity and brief nudity, the picture was produced on a shoestring, shot silent with audio dubbed in later and boasted a brilliant, relentless jazz music score. His follow-up film, Sweet Substitute made money in the United States, a first for any Canadian independent picture. Together with his third picture, the proto-feminist film When Tomorrow Dies, these three movies comprise Kent's \\"Vancouver Trilogy\\". Kent moved to Montreal in the late 1960s where he began making films that exemplified the wild, drug informed spirit of the youth driven counterculture. His 1967 film High premiered at the Montreal Film Festival the same year as the groundbreaking Arthur Penn film Bonnie and Clyde. That film's star, Warren Beatty, was one of High's strongest supporters, along with legendary German filmmaker Fritz Lang, who headed the jury that year. During the 1970s and throughout the 80's, Kent continued to explore various aspects of the human condition in his work. Though he slowed down in the 90's somewhat, he made a stunning return to form in 2005 with what is perhaps his finest effort, The Hamster Cage, a demented black comedy/psychodrama that is as funny as it is disturbing. The Hamster Cage won the jury prize at the 2005 Austin Fantastic Fest. In 2007, Kent completed post-production work on Hastings Street, a 20-minute Vancouver drama principally filmed in 1962.Vimeo user LarryKentFilms uploaded Hastings Street to Vimeo in 2011. http://vimeo.com/19191802 In 2009, Kent completed work on another, as yet untitled film and has plans for several more in the near future.

V. Vijayendra Prasad and directed by S. S. Rajamouli. The film stars Ram Charan and Kajal Aggarwal, with Dev Gill and Srihari in supporting roles, and was produced by Allu Aravind of Geetha Arts. The reincarnation-themed plot revolves around four people: a valiant warrior in charge of the princess' safety, the princess who is in love with him, the commander-in-chief of the army who lusts after the princess, and an emperor who wants to conquer their kingdom. They all die before their wishes are fulfilled and the plot jumps forward 400 years, at which point the reincarnation of the warrior starts having flashbacks upon a chance encounter. Made on a budget of 35 crore,https://www.thenewsminute.com/%27Can%27t%20believe%20it%27s%20been%20a%20decade%20already%27%3A%20Ram%20Charan%20on%2010%20years%20of%20%27Magadheera%27 production began on 2 March 2008 while principal photography commenced on 19 March 2008. The cinematography was done by K. K. Senthil Kumar, and was edited by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao. Production design was done by R. Ravinder, while the action sequences were choreographed by Peter Hein and the duo of Ram‚ÄîLakshman. The visual effects were designed by R. C. Kamalakannan, with assistance from Adel Adili and Pete Draper. It is the first Telugu film to list a \\"visual effects producer\\" in its credits. The soundtrack was composed by M. M. Keeravani, who collaborated with Kalyani Malik to score the background music. Magadheera was released on 31 July 2009 to critical acclaim, and collected a distributor's share of 73 crore. Its 1000-day theatrical run surpassed Chandramukhi (2005) as the longest running South Indian film. The film won the National Award for Best Choreography and Best Special Effects at the 57th National Film Awards as well as winning six Filmfare Awards, nine Nandi Awards and ten CineMAA Awards. The film's success catapulted the lead actors into stardom. In 2014, it was remade in Bengali as Yoddha: The Warrior.  Plot  Harsha, a dirt-bike racer, is travelling via auto rickshaw with his friend to the airport. He spots the blurry outline of a woman trying to flag the auto down and gestures to her that it is already occupied. As he does, their fingers accidentally touch, and Harsha feels an electric current passing through him, which triggers a few fleeting images. After recovering from the shock, he flees the auto in search of the girl and inquires about her to a woman named Indira \\"Indu\\", unaware that Indu is the same woman. Indu, thinking he is stalking her, misdirects him by convincing him that the girl is her neighbour. She and her friends exploit Harsha, having him take them to places and promising that the girl will show. After Harsha beats up a group of men who were verbally harassing Indu, she starts to fall in love with him. Meanwhile, Indu's distant cousin Raghuveer lusts after her. He manipulates Indu and her father into trusting him. However, when he attempts to touch a sleeping Indu, he sees visions of a warrior slitting his throat. Raghuveer consults a tantrik, Ghora, who reveals that in a prior life, Raghuveer was a prince who lusted after Indu, and was killed by her lover, a warrior. Raghuveer is determined to find the reincarnation of the warrior and kill him. Meanwhile, Harsha discovers how Indu and her friends have been defrauding him, and after he pranks her in retaliation, they start to fall in love. Raghuveer discovers that Harsha is the reincarnation of the warrior, murders Indu's father, and frames Harsha. As Raghuveer and Indu leave in a helicopter, Harsha fails to catch them; falling into a lake, he faces a near-death experience and gets a full vision of his past-life in 1609. In 1609, Emperor Sher Khan is preparing to invade the kingdom of Udaigarh when he hears of the brave warrior Kala Bhairava (Harsha). King Vikram Singh's daughter, Princess Mithravindha Devi (Indu), loves Bhairava, but he holds himself back even though he reciprocates the same. Ranadev Billa (Raghuveer), the king's nephew and Mithra's cousin, lusts Mithra and plans a competition between himself and Bhairava; the winner will marry her and the loser will be banished from Udaigarh. Bhairava's victory leads to Ranadev's banishment. Vikram Singh, however, secretly requests that Bhairava not marry his daughter, because Bhairava has a high chance of dying in the ensuing battle with Khan's forces, and he does not wish to see Mithra widowed. Though shocked, Bhairava concedes to the king's request and publicly declines to marry Mithra, leaving her distraught. Bhairava takes Mithra, his soldiers, and his caretakers to the Bhairavakona temple atop a cliff to seek blessings from God before the attack. Mithra demands that Bhairava admit his love for her. When he does not respond, she upsets the sacred items they have brought for the puja and, using her blood, paints an image of Bhairava on a rock picturing him leaving his true love to do his duty. An injured soldier arrives to tell Bhairava that Ranadev has aided Khan's army, who have killed Vikram Singh and are now rushing toward them. They arrive, and Khan challenges Bhairava to kill at least 100 of his soldiers. Bhairava completes the challenge but is severely injured in the battle. Khan, impressed by Bhairava's bravery, has a change of heart and accepts him as his friend. However, Ranadev, invoking Khan's promise to aid him in victory, continues attacking, eventually wounding Mithra before being killed by Bhairava. A dying Mithra asks Bhairava to confess his love, but before he can respond, she dies and falls off the cliff. Distraught, he jumps off as well, following her to meet the same fate. In the present, Harsha is rescued by a fisherman named Solomon (the reincarnation of Khan) and, with Solomon's help, visits Udaigarh. He reaches Raghuveer's palace and overhears Ghora telling Raghuveer that if Indu's past-life memories are not revived within the day they never can be, and she will be with Raghuveer forever. Harsha kidnaps Indu, with Solomon aiding him and takes her to Bhairavakona, and in the process, Raghuveer accidentally kills Ghora. Raghuveer arrives by helicopter and asks Indu to come with him; however Indu sees Mithra's painting, and her past-life memories are revived. She reunites with Harsha and asks him to forgive her. An angered Raghuveer attacks Harsha who fights him, and with the help of Solomon, manages to kill him and the couple reunites.

Production  = Development = K. V. Vijayendra Prasad was watching a Marathi film where two warriors Sivaji and Tanaji are attacked by Mughal Army. Once the duo can reach Sinhagad fort, they can kill the army together effectively. While Sivaji escapes to the fort for support, Tanaji fights with the army and dies in the process leaving Sivaji in grief. Prasad took this as an inspiration and wrote a story on the theme of reincarnation of a bodyguard who serves a queen. He fights 100 warriors and dies in his attempt to re- enthrone his queen after she is overthrown by her conspirators. He is reborn after 400 years and fulfils his ambition of placing her on the throne by making her a Chief Minister or a popular social worker like Medha Patkar. It was subsequently rejected and after fifteen years, his son director S. S. Rajamouli selected this script, but made several changes to it. Rajamouli re- characterised the queen as a princess to create a vital love story for the film, as he felt that the relationship between a queen and a bodyguard would be only about loyalty and honesty. Prasad said he was inspired by the Kannada film Raja Nanna Raja (1976) while writing the story. Production for the film was officially launched on 2 March 2008 at FNCC in Hyderabad. B. V. S. N. Prasad co-produced the film with Allu Aravind under his production banner, Geetha Arts. M. Rathnam was announced as the dialogue writer while Rajamouli's usual associates K. K. Senthil Kumar, Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao and M. M. Keeravani worked on the film's cinematography, editing and music respectively. After many potential titles, Magadheera was considered and finalised in early February 2009. Tamil and Malayalam dubbed versions were planned in mid February 2009. The film's Tamil dubbed version was titled as Maaveeran, named after the 1986 Tamil film. Geetha Arts collaborated with Udhayanidhi Stalin for the Tamil version and distributed it under his production banner, Red Giant Movies. K. Bhagyaraj wrote the dialogues for Maaveeran. The Malayalam version was titled Dheera‚ÄîThe Warrior and was distributed by Pallavi films. = Casting = After considering several actresses (including Tamannaah) for the princess role, Kajal Aggarwal was selected by Rajamouli as the female lead opposite Ram Charan after conducting a photoshoot in his office. Rajamouli said that he wanted to cast her as the female lead in Yamadonga (2007) after her Telugu debut Lakshmi Kalyanam (2007), but she was unavailable. He added that he wanted somebody \\"good looking, who would look like a princess and who had dates available\\" and finalised her because she met all of these prerequisites. After conducting her photoshoot, Rajamouli explained the story and Mithra's characterisation to her in 45 minutes. He said she needed to treat the hero arrogantly, but do so out of love for the hero. Kajal kept this in mind and acted accordingly while playing the dual roles of a princess from 400 years ago and a modern-day college student. Kajal called both her roles \\"unique and challenging\\". Dev Gill was selected to portray the film's antagonist. Rajamouli was criticised for selecting him considering Gill's previous film, Krishnarjuna (2008), but remained adamant about casting him. He said that he had to cast a good looking man as the film's villain because the heroine needed to find him trustworthy. For this film, Gill had to practice horse riding in Ramoji Film City; Ram Charan was already an experienced equestrian. Srihari was cast in his role in the film in early April 2008. Kim Sharma was selected to perform one of the two item numbers in the film in early June 2008. Saloni Aswani made a cameo appearance in the film and shot for three days. She was subsequently signed for Rajamouli's next project, Maryada Ramanna (2010), before Magadheera was even released. Rao Ramesh was cast as a tantrik who helps Gill's character in the present era. Mumaith Khan was selected for another item number, a remix version of the hit song \\"Bangaru Kodipetta\\" from Gharana Mogudu (1992); Gharana Mogudu's music was also composed by M. M. Keeravani. Chiranjeevi made a special appearance after the song, making Magadheera the first film he appeared in after his entry into politics. When Rajamouli suggested the idea of a cameo appearance, Chiranjeevi was initially hesitant till the director narrated the complete sequence and the importance of the song. = Costume designs = Regarding his looks in the film, Ram Charan said, \\"Personality wise there isn‚Äôt really much difference to Kalabhairava but I have to tell you minor changes like the shape of my mustache, a slight voice modulation, the background scale, the atmosphere and even the ‚ÄòChandrabindu‚Äô worked wonders on screen and gave a totally different look and feel and I felt like it was an altogether different side of me. When I was told of the characterization of ‚ÄòKalabhairava‚Äô, I had an impression of a young, passionate soldier and naturally it had to have a great body and an authoritative voice. So, we also worked on it. We actually went to Rajasthan and observed the local culture and their way of dressing, we researched a lot about their costumes, history and great personalities 400 years ago and planned it accordingly.\\" Ram Charan sported a long hairdo for both of his characters in the film. To design the armour used by Charan in his role as Kalabhairava, art director R. Ravinder wanted the precise measurements of Charan's body; they used plaster of Paris to make a mould of Charan's body shape from which they created a statue. They designed costumes for the statue and had Charan try them on once they were satisfied with the designs. In an interview with Radhika Rajamani of Rediff.com, the film's stylist, Rama Rajamouli, said that it took one month to develop the right look for the olden period before she began working on the materials and costumes for the film. She added that all of the film's costumes were designed by her and stitched in Hyderabad, and that Kajal's costumes were heavily detailed as she needed to look rich, elegant and bright. Rajamouli had some disagreements with cinematographer K. K. Senthil Kumar over the colours of the costumes. Her decision of having Kajal wear a dress of baby pink and pista green during the war sequence at Bhairavakona was initially opposed by Rajamouli, but later agreed to after the director saw the final edit. She also used minimal jewellery for the princess's outfits. = Filming = Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad where the film was shot in specially erected sets The film's principal photography was expected to begin on 26 February 2008, and then on 15 March 2008, but finally began on 19 March 2008 in Rajasthan. Initial shooting occurred for 10 days in Rann of Kutch, Gujarat. Art director Ravinder went to Chennai and gave details of their requirements to a prominent chariot- making specialist. After rejecting the maker's first iron skeletons, Ravinder opted to design them himself, and prepared three models of chariots with different heights to be used, depending on the camera's location and other technical requirements. He used fibre material for the iron skeleton's exteriors. For a scene in which neither the hero nor the villain was present on the chariot, Ravinder measured a short person and designed a hidden chamber in which he could sit and secretly control the horses. While the chariot race sequence was shot in Dholavira, the sequence in which the chariot sinks in quicksand was shot at a set comprising three acres in Ramoji Film City. K. K. Senthil Kumar scouted for locations in Gujarat, looking for dry, open lands to shoot the chariot race sequence. They found salt lands with white sands in Dholavira. To shoot the sequence there, they wanted a light weight vehicle to follow the horses; they bought a Maruti van, removed the vehicle's top and mounted the camera along with a jimmy jib atop it. A part of the song Dheera Dheera was also shot there, requiring filmmakers to plant a dry tree and a couple of oxen for use in the song's backdrop. An item number featuring Kim Sharma and Ram Charan was shot in late June 2008 in a specially erected fisherman colony. It was set up on the first floor of Annapurna Studios and cost less than 3 million. Ravinder explained, \\"The set should look like an outdoor location, but need to be constructed in an indoor floor. I constructed exteriors of around 28 houses in that floor with detailed interior plan for the house of Srihari. I also constructed a small boat and a big wheeled fish with thermocol. When director wanted smoke-effect for a shot I held the heavy smoke machine on my shoulders in a low angle for the required effect.\\" After filming key parts of the film in Rajasthan, suburbs of Hyderabad, and at Badami in Karnataka, filming continued in Ramoji Film City in a specially erected set named Bhairavakona in late October 2008. Two more schedules, one from 3‚Äì10 December and one in January, were also shot at the Bhairavakona set. The sequence of Charan killing 100 warriors, also at Bhairavakona, included a bridge. As the set did not permit for shooting with low angles, a separate half-bridge was erected at Bhoot Bangla in Road No. 22 of Banjara Hills. The bridge, which had a height of and a length of , was constructed on top of a rocky hill using steel beams as the skeleton and wooden material as support. It was built in around 20 days by over 60 men amid heavy rains. 20 trucks of black soil were transported from Ramoji Film City for the bridge set, as that type of soil was only available in the former location. Golkonda Fort in Hyderabad where the song \\"Panchadara Bomma\\", picturised on Ram Charan and Kajal, was shot. After the completion of shooting at the arena set in Ramoji Film City, the arena set was demolished and a set for heroine's house was constructed in its place. This was the last set constructed for this film. By late September 2008, 70% of the film's shoot was complete. The remix version of \\"Bangaru Kodipetta\\" was shot by Ram Charan and Mumaith Khan under the supervision of Prem Rakshith at Chennai Port, although Visakhapatnam Port was first considered. Filming continued in and around Hyderabad very discreetly in November 2008. Stunt sequences by Ram Charan and some stuntmen were shot in mid-December 2008 at Hyderabad. By mid February 2009, the film's scripted part had been wrapped up, with only some songs left to shoot. The song \\"Nakosam Nuvvu\\" was shot in Switzerland while \\"Panchadara Bomma Bomma\\" was shot at Golconda Fort in Hyderabad. Both songs were duets shot by Ram Charan and Kajal. K. K. Senthil Kumar said in an interview that Magadheera could not have been made in eight months because of its long pre-production and post- production phases. Over two lakhs worth of props, including swords, daggers, knives, bows and arrows, pouches, armour, footwear and other accessories, were used in the film. They were designed by 160 workers, including welders, molders, carpenters, painters, cobblers, artists, tailors and leather men, who worked for two months in the Geetha Arts Studio. Five people were appointed exclusively to look after these props. However, during the film's shoot both Peter Hein and Ram Charan suffered major injuries. The former fell down from a height of 8090 feet during the composition of a stunt and was advised a bed rest for four months. Charan faced severe leg fractures, while Rajamouli said that Peter \\"met with an accident on the sets, had two broken ribs, fractured hands and jaw and lost all his teeth. Within a month, he was back on the sets with his face and body covered in bandages and plaster. He could barely lift his hands to shoot.\\" = Visual effects = A scene from the song \\"Dheera Dheera\\" during the filming stage (above), the same scene in the film after utilisation of CG extension (below). R. C. Kamalakannan was the VFX producer of this film. Magadheera was the first Telugu film in which the position of \\"Visual Effects Producer\\" was used in the credits. He was assisted by a team of five experts from abroad and a 62 dedicated group members apart from 130 people from the company EFX in Chennai and Hyderabad. Special effects and CG was used for about 1 hour and 40 minutes out of the total 2 hours and 35 minutes in the film. 15% of the frames in the film's scenes of Udayghad city were actually shot with a camera; the rest were CG extension. For the scenes in the stadium, CG extension was slightly above 50%. For the stadium, Italian concept artist Marco Rolandi began with a CAD drawing and made his first 3D concept in 5 days. It took five months for Marco to reach the design shown in the film and as imagined by Rajamouli. Simultaneously, Iranian 3D technical director Adel Adili, who worked with Kamalakannan for Anji (2004), Yamadonga and Arundathi (2009), was working on the 3D Udayghad city. He started with a city-plan and added streets, buildings, mountains, temples, palaces, water bodies, a huge waterfall, rivers, gates, a moat and trees, all of which were planned and received Rajamouli's approval before being executed to full scale. Adili redesigned Marco's 3D stadium to suit Indian aesthetics and made it fit perfectly within the city. Pete Draper, who worked with Kamalakanna in Ghajini (2008), was selected as the pipeline technical director of the film. At that time, Kamalakannan was in Iran finalising the CG stadium and City with Adili. The majority of the film was shot in anamorphic format, but a Super 35 camera gate and lens were used for the stadium episode to minimise distortion. Post- production of the stadium scenes were given to Prasad EFX, and the film set up their own render farm in Chennai. The post process was done in several stages after the scan. The live stadium had only 7 steps, in which live people were positioned in 6 steps while the remaining 12 steps were CG extension. Adili created 3D CG people to fill the CG steps and their actions in a library of 3000 frames. Draper designed the birds in two flows: one flow kept flying around the stadium, while the other flow took off from a position dome and landed on a target dome. Rajamouli used those birds in several shots. Upon finishing the stages of the stadium composite, Kamalakannan flew to Iran again to work with Adel for the 3D city shots which were created entirely in CG. Adili designed 3D horses for the hero and villain and Draper designed the 3D people flocking behind the horses. About Adili's work, Kamalakannan said, \\"When we started the city-shot renders, it has taken several hours to render one frame. But Adili re-corrected the geometry and applied several path breaking ideas, so even on 24 July, just a week before the film release, we were able to do corrections, render and submit.\\" was spent solely on VFX for Magadheera. = Piracy = During the film's shoot at Ramoji Film City in late November 2008, a film can, containing two or three scenes, was discovered missing from Rainbow lab. The filmmakers filed a case at Hayathnagar police station. Security personnel and film unit members searched, but failed to recover the reels. Rajamouli's unit said it was not important if the scenes from the can were aired online since they were not crucial scenes, were all on a blue matte and lacked finishing. Later, raw footage from the film was seen on the internet but no details about the culprits were found. After the photographs and small video clips were leaked on the Internet, some of the film unit members felt that the loss might have been a ploy on the part of the producers to create hype.  Themes and influences  The film is based on the concept of reincarnation and eternal love. According to Rediff, the rewritten script's basic storyline is that \\"Love remains eternal and it will follow generations and generations. There is always a big victory for Love.\\" The film's flashback sequences were used as a flip switch between the film's olden and present day eras. Initially the film featured a scene in which the present day heroine accidentally receives a dupatta preserved in a museum that is used in the flashbacks as the dupatta Bhairava and Ranadheer race for. However, separate dupattas were used in the film as Rajamouli felt that getting the dupatta from the flashback would complicate the narrative. In her book Bimal Roy's Madhumati: Untold Stories from Behind the Scenes, writer Rinki Bhattacharya compared the reincarnation theme of Magadheera with that of Madhumati (1958), Karz (1980), Karan Arjun (1995) and Om Shanti Om (2007). Touching the heroine unleashes locked memories within the hero that transport him to Rajasthan in 1609 from contemporary Hyderabad. Bhattacharya also compared Magadheera to another Telugu film, Mooga Manasulu (1964). Rajamouli told Subhash K. Jha that he was inspired by Karan Arjun to make films based on reincarnation.  Music  M. M. Keeravani composed the film's soundtrack. It features six songs including the remixed version of his own composition \\"Bangaru Kodipetta\\" from the film Gharana Mogudu. The soundtrack of the Tamil dubbed version, Maaveeran, had three additional tracks. The Telugu soundtrack was launched at Shilpakala Vedika in Hyderabad on 28 June 2009. The Tamil version was launched on 25 April 2011 in Chennai.  Release  Geetha Arts released the film on 31 July 2009, with 625 digital UFO prints in 1250 theatres across the globe, making Magadheera the biggest release for a Telugu film in history. Its release included more than 1000 screens in Andhra Pradesh alone. The film opened up with 25 prints overseas in almost 40 locations. Magadheera was the first Telugu film to be released on 21 screens in North America. Huge vinyl posters featuring Ram Charan and his father, cameo performer Chiranjeevi, were put up at all of the theatres in Krishna District. Posters also featured the head of Chiranjeevi's political party, former MLA Vangaveeti Radhakrishna, which added political importance to the release. The Tamil dubbed version Maaveeran and Malayalam dubbed version Dheera‚ÄîThe Warrior were released in more than 100 screens and 50 screens respectively on 27 May 2011. = Distribution = Raju Hirwani, the owner of Supreme Music, ventured into overseas distribution with Magadheera. He distributed the film in the USA via Blue Sky Cinemas Inc. The distribution rights of non-US countries, including the UK, Ireland, Middle East, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, were acquired by Krishna Productions. The theatrical rights of Australia and New Zealand were sold to Tollyfilmz. The film's Singaporean rights were sold to Pragati films. Gulf and Kuwait theatrical rights were sold to K. A. Chowdary and Basheer respectively. Red Giant Movies distributed Maaveeran while Pallavi films distributed Dheera‚ÄîThe Warrior. The film's Karnataka distributor, Vijayakumar, was disciplined for breaking the rules of the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce by simultaneously releasing a non-Kannada film in more than 21 screens in the state. The proceeds of 21 screens were given to him while the rest was confiscated by the Chamber of Commerce. The KFCC also suspended Vijaykumar, who was KFCC's secretary for distribution, from its executive committee. Joint collector Gaurav Uppal convened a meeting of film exhibitors and distributors, warning them against black-marketing tickets to Magadheera. This was after local leaders, attempting to acquire a maximum number of tickets, blocked and booked tickets to the film in advance, to enthuse their supporters during the local civic polls in Guntur. Special teams of revenue, police and commercial tax officers were appointed to keep watch at ticket counters and ensure that each person was issued only one ticket. Priority was ordered to be given for the sanitation, safety and comfort of the viewers. Authorities in Vijayawada ensured the strict checking and prevention of black-marketing of tickets. However, Ram Charan's fans resorted to sloganeering and an impromptu protest demonstration in the office of Revenue Divisional Officer K. Hymavathi in Machilipatnam. They demanded the screening of a benefit show and the advance sale of tickets after being rejected by the management of the twin theatres, Siri Venkata and Siri Krishna, where the film was screened. Their plea was rejected by the officer, who said that the tickets would be issued only to those who came in queue and that no special concessions would be made for fans. = Mishaps = On 9 August 2009, two persons, identified as NIT student M. Praveen Kumar and Ganesh, were killed and 15 others sustained severe injuries after being electrocuted while jostling for tickets for Magadheera at the theatre Bhavani in Kazipet, Warangal. The screening of Magadheera at theatres in Vizianagaram was prohibited by the then minister Botsa Satyanarayana until safety measures were complied with. Satyanarayana's announcement followed the death of five people in Salur Village due to an electrical accident at the Lakshmi theatre screening Magadheera. = Accusation of plagiarism = Folk lyricist Vangapandu Prasada Rao alleged that his 40-year-old folk song \\"Em Pillado Eldamostavaa\\", which was featured in T. Krishna's Ardharathri Swatanthram (1986), was used by film director Rajamouli and Allu Aravind in the Magadheera song \\"Jorsey\\" without Rao's consent. Activists of PDSU, POW and PYL staged a protest demonstration in front of the Ashok 70 MM theatre in Nizamabad, where the film was screened, to demand the removal of the song. The protesters said that the song was written by Rao during the famous Srikakulam armed struggle four decades prior and had been misused to portray an obscene duet in the film. They added that the song was used without the permission of the writer and that the depiction defeated the very purpose of the song, which was written in a revolutionary spirit. They demanded a public apology by the makers to Rao. A few reports stated that Rao demanded Aravind pay him compensation of 5 million. After the completion of the film's 175-day run, novelist S. P. Chary accused the film of being based on a novel that he had written and published as a serial under the title Chanderi in a monthly magazine in 1998. He demanded that filmmakers compensate him for using his idea without consent, and threatened to take legal action if the producers did not heed his demands, or remade the film in another language. He added that he deserved to be credited for the story and alleged that Allu Arjun and Allu Sirish were trying to postpone his acknowledgment by discussing the issue with him. = Home media = Magadheera was the first Telugu film in India to have a home media release in Blu-ray format. During the release announcement, Allu Sirish said that although they initially were reluctant to go for it, given the fact that there were approximately only 2500 Blu-ray devices in Andhra Pradesh, the overwhelming demand for it made him rethink the decision. He added, \\"Sharing this vision with us was Sri Balaji Videos, the largest home- video label in Andhra Pradesh. Together, we're bringing out Magadheera on Blu- ray. Though Bhavani Videos released Nagarjuna's King (2008) on Blu-ray, it was only for the overseas market. This makes Magadheera the first Blu-ray film to be released in India and with a bonus disc with additional footage. We're also a holding a press event on this regard to officially announce the launch of the movie on DVD and Blu-ray.\\" A press note announced that the DVDs would be available beginning the third week of March 2010 while the Blu-ray would be available two weeks later. The launch ceremony took place in a Marriott Hotel on 27 February 2010. The first DVD was released by M. M. Keeravani and was presented by journalist Pasupuleti Ramarao. The DVD was released in NTSC video format and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround audio format on 5 March 2010. The Blu- ray disc released on 13 April 2010. Magadheera held the top position in sales for its 720p Blu-ray edition with 5.1 Dolby digital sound format as of July 2014.  Reception  = Critical reception = Suresh Krishnamoorthy of The Hindu summarised, \\"Magadheera is not for the weak-hearted, those who do not like the sight of blood and neither is it for those who like movies with storylines that are much-closer-to-everyday- reality. But Rajamouli excels in story-telling. The way he has used the flashback as a flip switch, going back and forth and taking the viewer through a 400-year journey in a jiffy is interesting. The rest is about how well technology, creativity, imagination and innovation are leveraged to present what is an eye-pleasing experience for viewers.\\" B. V. S. Prakash of The Times of India wrote, \\"Despite a few narrative lapses, the much-hyped semi-periodic epic lives up to expectations. Unlike his previous action-centric films, director Rajamouli dishes a heart- touching love story in a lavish canvas convincingly. Also kudos for the way he has visualised and presented the film.\\" He added, \\"After not-so-impressive Chirutha, Ram Charan Tej returns as a valiant soldier and breathes life into the larger-than-life role with ease. Similarly, Kajal known for simple lover girl roles transforms into a determined princess and truly impresses. Dev Gil is adequate as the ruthless villain\\", and rated the film 3 out of 5. Oneindia Entertainment stated, \\"S. S. Rajamouli has chosen a fantastic love story for his movie Magadheera and linked it to a love story that dated back to some 400 years. He has filled complete energy in the film and no doubt, the graphic works and modern technology are perfectly used for the movie. As a whole, the film reminds the audiences of watching a Hollywood movie with perfect local flavor\\", and called the film's screenplay by Rajamouli a highlight. Upperstall.com stated \\"Magadheera is not an epic, not a legend, not even a cult movie, but it is certainly an artistic extravaganza and a sensory treat. Like we said before, a must watch! A mast watch!\\". Radhika Rajamani of Rediff.com called the film \\"technically brilliant\\" and wrote \\"A reincarnation story is not often seen in Telugu cinema and SS Rajamouli uses this theme for Ram Charan Teja's second film Magadheera. It's a magnum opus production with great technical work. The graphics are excellent for a Telugu movie. Overall, the movie is a mainstream one with good packaging.\\" She rated the film 3 out of 5. Sify called the film a \\"brilliant entertainer\\" and wrote, \\"Set against the backdrop of an eerie theme ‚Äî reincarnation ‚Äî Magadheera unfolds on the screen with multiple shades of entertainment. When the movie was launched last year, director Rajamouli dared to reveal the central theme of the story. He has succeeded in his attempt, as he was able to keep the screenplay and narration gripping from start to finish. The second half has the soul in it.\\" Sify summarised, \\"In short, the movie encompasses some of the best commercial elements that Telugu audience have seen in the recent past.\\" IndiaGlitz called the film \\"royal and spellbinding\\" and opined, \\"The film deserves a special credit for many reasons, notable among them is the grandeur of the movie and the amazing technical aspects. This is surely a path breaker in terms of Telugu film making and with the likes of 'Arundhati', Tollywood sure is proud to have this one in its league. It is a valiant attempt to bring such genre to the modern day audience and present it with finesse so that it fits the historical angle and the today's angle.\\" However, Rajamouli was accused of lifting scenes from films like Gladiator (2000), Troy (2004), The Myth (2005) and 300 (2007). = Box office = The film collected a share of approximately in its first week in Andhra Pradesh alone, of which a share of was collected in Nizam region. Sixteen centres collected , each of which was an all-time state record. It collected a share of in 21 days in Andhra Pradesh. By the end of its four-week run, the film was declared a blockbuster and collected a share of in 28 days and in 35 days. The film completed a 50-day run in 302 centres on 18 September 2009. By then, the film had collected and stood strong. The film completed its 100-day run in 223 centres. By then it had surpassed Rajinikanth's Sivaji (2007), which grossed in Tamil Nadu, and stood second to Ghajini (2008), which reached . The film completed a 175-day run in 3 centres and, by then, collected a share of . The film completed a 365-day run in Vijayalakshmi theatre in Kurnool on 31 July 2010 and a 1000-day run in the same theatre on 26 April 2012. More than 50% of the film's lifetime collections were from the Nizam region. The film also did well in the overseas box office. It was released in New Jersey with three prints on three screens and collected a record share of more than 150,000 dollars, turning the highest amount raised overseas by a Telugu film; the previous record holder was Trivikram Srinivas' Jalsa (2008), which collected more than 100,000 dollars. It grossed 102,000 dollars in its first two days in New Jersey and a share of 95,000 dollars in Virginia with two prints as of mid August 2009. It collected a share of 78,000 dollars in the San Francisco Bay Area with a single print. It managed to sell 2300 tickets in Minneapolis; the previous record for tickets sold there for a Telugu film was 1200. The film's overseas records were beaten two years later by Dookudu (2011), although disputes have arisen over which film holds the Tollywood all-time sales record. The film was dubbed in Japanese and released there in 2018. This version earned an additional $1.2 million, the second highest for an Indian film after Muthu (1995), which earned $1.6 million after being released in Japan.  Legacy  Magadheera's success turned Kajal into one of the most sought-after actresses in Telugu cinema and catapulted her into the foray of leading Telugu actresses. The film was also considered a fate changer in the career of Ram Charan. The role of Sher Khan played by Srihari was considered as one of the best roles in his career and also catapulted S. S. Rajamouli to stardom. Dev Gill attained stardom with this film and went on to work in several South Indian films as an antagonist. After the release of Magadheera, people began recognising him as Ranadheer. According to writer Gopimohan, Magadheera started a trend of experimentation with period, socio-fantasy and spiritual themes that was continued in films like Panchakshari (2010), Nagavalli (2010), Anaganaga O Dheerudu (2011), Mangala (2011), Sri Rama Rajyam (2011) and Uu Kodathara? Ulikki Padathara? (2012). The props used in this film, including weapons like swords and shields, were auctioned by Movie Artist Association. Actors, technicians, and the general public were invited to bid and the proceeds were used to aid poor artists in the Telugu film industry. Actor Sivaji Raja started the bidding by offering 50,000 for the sword that Ram Charan used and comedian Venu Madhav started the bidding for the shield with 25,000. B. V. S. N. Prasad bid for both the sword and knife for 100,000. The bidding started on 7 May 2010 online in the association's official website and ended on 16 May. The winners were declared on 20 May 2010. After Magadheera, S. S. Rajamouli worked on a small budget film Maryada Ramanna (2010) which, according to Crazy Mohan, was similar to the act of S. S. Vasan directing the small budget film Mr. Sampat (1952) after Chandralekha (1948). Rajamouli explained his decision by saying, \\"I decided that my next project would be Maryada Ramanna during the Magadheera shooting itself because it is a 1 and half year project that demands lot of physical labor and mental strain. I didn't want to commit another physically exhausting film immediately after Magadheera. Maryada Ramanna gave us time to recharge our batteries so that we could come up with another huge project.\\" He revealed Maryada Ramanna's plot before its launch to minimise the expectations of his audience after Magadheera's success. Tammareddy Bharadwaja said \\"Ever since Arundhati and Magadheera did well at the box office, the rest of the industry started following their footsteps. Also, since there is an irrational craze to make high budget films right now, producers are turning towards mythological films. It is the only genre where you can boast of spending crores for creating the sets and the look of the film. But what they don't realize is that if these films flop, the blow to the producer will be severe.\\" Films like Anaganaga O Dheerudu (2011) and Shakti (2011) were commercial failures and Badrinath (2012) was an average grosser; all being fantasy films in which the protagonist is a warrior. The promos of Badrinath looked similar to Magadheera and the former's director V. V. Vinayak along with its male lead Allu Arjun kept insisting that Badrinath is dissimilar to Magadheera. Producer Natti Kumar said \\"If a hero delivers a hit, producers run after him for five years and burn their fingers only after six or eight flops. It's the same story with movies. Since Magadheera became a hit, every other hero and director wants to do period film where there is scope to spend crores. They don't work on the script, story or relevance. It is a pure display of graphics, heroes' abs and grandeur. The plot is lost. Magadheera worked because it was a novel genre then, but why will people want to see the same things again?\\". Janani Iyer cited the character of Mithravinda played by Kajal in the film as one of her dream roles. Ram Gopal Varma refused to call Magadheera a film and instead termed it as an event that comes \\"once in a blue moon\\". While commenting on Mahesh Babu's Aagadu (2014), he said that Magadheera looked like a 750 crore film when compared to Aagadu if the latter was a 75 crore film and added, \\"My comparison between \\"Aagadu\\" and \\"Magadheera\\" is mainly because they both are the most expensive films for their own individual times.\\" Reviewing the Tamil film Anegan (2014), few critics opined that the film had traces of Magadheera mainly due to the theme of reincarnation. The Tamil dubbed version of the Telugu film Yevadu (2014), which featured Charan in one of the lead roles and Kajal in a crucial cameo, was titled Magadheera.  Awards and nominations  The film won the National Award for Best Choreography and Best Special Effects at the 57th National Film Awards. The film also won six Filmfare Awards, nine Nandi Awards, and ten CineMAA Awards.  Remakes  Ram Charan decided not to debut in Bollywood with Magadheera's Hindi remake, as he believed the film might not be recreated well. In an interview with The Times of India, Charan said, \\"When I met Anil Kapoor some time back, he told me I will ask Boney Kapoor to remake Magadheera with you in Hindi. But I said I don't know if I would want to do the remake. Magadheera is a lovely film which can't be recreated.\\" The film was remade in Bengali as Yoddha: The Warrior in 2014; it was directed by Raj Chakraborty with Dev and Mimi Chakraborty playing the lead roles. The 2014 Kannada film Brahma, according to its director R. Chandru, was inspired by Magadheera but was not a remake. The film was dubbed in Hindi under the same name by Goldmines Telefilms and released in 2015.

History Dinajpur district was constituted in 1786. In 1947, the Radcliffe Line placed the Sadar and Thakurgaon subdivisions of Dinajpur district in East Pakistan. The Balurghat subdivision of Dinajpur district was reconstituted as West Dinajpur district in West Bengal. The new Raiganj subdivision was formed in 1948. In order to restore territorial links between northern and southern parts of West Bengal which had been snapped during the partition of Bengal, and on the recommendations of the States Reorganisation Commission a portion of the erstwhile Kishanganj subdivision comprising Goalpokhar, Islampur and Chopra thanas (police stations) and parts of Thakurganj thana, along with the adjacent parts of the erstwhile Gopalpur thana in Katihar subdivision were transferred from Purnea district in Bihar to West Bengal in 1956, and were formally incorporated into Raiganj subdivision in West Dinajpur. The township of Kishanganj and its entire municipal boundary remained within Bihar. With the introduction of the Community Development Programme in 1960-61, community development blocks were set up in West Dinajpur district.

The story takes place inside an underground research facility where a group of scientists look for ways to sustain life. When one of the scientist falls ill and a chrysalis forms around him, a tug of war ensues about the future of the stricken scientist... and ultimately the fate of the Earth. Production During pre-production Bradbury was consulted on every element of the film, from script to conceptual art and storyboards. Principal photography began on November 23, 2007 in Los Angeles, California. Principal photography on the film took place on multiple sets at the Burbank Production Stages where a completely connected and functional environment recreating an underground research facility was built. Each set was connected through a series of hallways and passageways allowing the crew to shoot continuously without revealing any set backings or lights. Everything was built-in allowing the film crew to follow the characters on camera from one part of the facility to another without ever having to cut. The filmmakers decided to go for a look that pays tribute to the science fiction films of the genre‚Äôs golden age. For that same reason it was decided to build everything physically and limit the use of computer generated effects. The film does feature special creature effects by Romaire Studios, the FX facility founded by Emmy Awards winner Lee Romaire. Additional work was done on the FX stage at Vlaze Media Networks in Los Angeles where multiple news segments and emergency broadcasts where shot in order to composite into monitors on the research facility set. Second unit photography was completed at the El Mirage dry lake bed in California, and the rainforest of El Yunque in Puerto Rico where the film‚Äôs breathtaking finale was shot at 3,800 feet above sea level on one of the rainforest‚Äôs highest peaks. The film features an orchestral score by composer Brandon Moore, which was recorded in Los Angeles using a live orchestra combined with electronic sounds, performed on synths by the composer, to heighten the film‚Äôs chilling undertone. The film was first previewed in Wired magazine's November 2008 issue,Postapocalypse Now! - Wired Magazine, October 2008 and premiered at the San Diego Comic Con on July 26, 2008, when Ray Bradbury introduced the clip to a crowd of 5,000 fans. The film premiered in November 2008 in Los Angeles during the Shriekfest Film Festival. Ray Bradbury was present at one of the screenings and spoke to the crowd after the film played. Release Lightning Entertainment picked up Urban Archipelago Films' production of Ray Bradbury‚Äôs Chrysalis for domestic distribution. The film premiered November 17, 2009, via On Demand through the Time Warner, Charter, and Bright House digital cable providers.

Many Jews confined in the synagogues died in the fires, and many other anti-Semitic measures were launched at the same time, ultimately followed by the murder of the vast majority of the Jews of Latvia.  German occupation  The original caption of this German propaganda photograph, published 7 July 1941 reads: \\"When the German troops took the city Riga, the population there was elated. People who had suffered for months from the blood terror and had hidden themselves in the last weeks in the cellars of their houses, hurried now on the roads and town squares and thronged around the German soldiers to welcome them.\\" The German army crossed the border in the early morning of Sunday, June 22, 1941. All along the front, the Soviet armed forces suffered a crushing defeat. On June 29, 1941, the occupying Red Army began a disorganized withdrawal from Riga, then under German aerial bombardment. To slow the German advance, the retreating Soviets had blown up all the bridges over the Daugava river. The highest church spire in the city, St. Peter's, had been set on fire by German bombs. Some Soviet sympathizers in the city set out pails of water and gave bread to the retreating troops, but these were futile gestures amid the military disaster.Kaufmann, The Destruction of the Jews of Latvia, at page 10. On July 1, 1941, the German army entered Riga.Kaufmann, The Destruction of the Jews of Latvia, at pages 11-13 There were about 40,000 Jews in the city at that time. The Germans were welcomed by the majority of the non-Jewish population of Riga. Actions against the Jews Shortly after German troops entered the city on July 1, 1941, the Nazi occupation authorities incited Latvian nationalists to commit deadly anti-Jewish riots known as \\"pogroms\\".Ezergailis, The Holocaust in Latvia, at pages 216 to 218 Within three months, more than 6,000 people were killed in Riga and the vicinity.Angrick and Klein, Die \\"Endl√∂sung\\" in Riga, at page 91 Professionals such as lawyers, physicians and engineers in particular were targeted by the Nazis. Frida Michelson reported that they were singled out by fellow Latvian professionals from among the other Jews arrested and immediately shot.Michelson, Frida, I Survived Rumbuli, at page 49. Large groups of prisoners were taken out of the Central Prison by truck to Bikernieki Forest, where they were shot.Michelson, Frida, I Survived Rumbuli, at pages 64 to 66. On July 2, at the instigation of the Germans, Latvian armed youths wearing red and white armbands went about the city dragging Jews out of their homes and arresting them.Michelson, Frida, I Survived Rumbuli, at pages 48 to 50. The Latvians assaulted a number of Jews, some so severely they died, and shot others. The same morning, all the telephones of Jewish homes were disconnected. Pƒìrkonkrusts (Thunder Cross or Swastika) was the name of the Latvian fascist party that was active in the 1930s. Members of Pƒìrkonkrusts including, among others, Viktors ArƒÅjs and Herberts Cukurs cooperated with the Nazis in exterminating the Jews of Latvia. The university fraternities were also involved with the party. In July 1941, after the German occupation, Pƒìrkonkrusts took over the house of the Jewish banker Schmulian, in Riga, at 19 Valdemara Street (Gorki Street under Soviet rule), to use as their headquarters. A Riga newspaper Tƒìvija, (\\"Fatherland\\") regularly published anti-Jewish propaganda, such as an editorial on July 11, 1941, entitled \\"The Jews‚ÄîSource of Our Destruction\\". The Jews arrested were taken to police headquarters (or \\"prefecture\\") and the Central Prison, also known as the Zentralka.Schneider, Journey into Terror, at page 2 Old and sick people were brought in naked. Young women were stripped naked and confined to cellars where they were raped. There were reports of women being raped in front of their husbands and children. Traditionally-attired Jews, especially those with beards, were targeted for humiliations such as dragging them around by their beards and forced shaving. Others were forced at gunpoint to put on the talith (prayer shawl) and tefilin (phylactery), then dance and sing Soviet songs. People, including non-Jews, were commonly accused by their enemies of \\"Communist-Jewish activities\\".Michelson, Frida, I Survived Rumbuli, at pages to 52 to 55 In the days following July 2, the Jews at the prefecture were marched out to perform forced labor, then confined back at the prefecture during the night. The Latvian Roberts Stiglics was in charge of the prefecture. Much of this was simply makework designed to humiliate and intimidate the Jews, although in at least one instance a small group of Jewish women was detailed to Jelgava to work in the fields for six weeks. According to Kaufmann, the Latvians were in charge this entire time. Among other things, they forced the Jews to sing Nazi songs and the \\"Internationale\\". The only Jews not subject to brutality at the hands of Latvian thugs were those who had been members of the Jewish Latvian Freedom Fighters Association (Latvian: LaƒçplƒìsisMichelson, Frida, I Survived Rumbuli, at page 26), but this immunity did not last.Kaufmann, The Destruction of the Jews of Latvia, at page 15 Professor Ezergailis, while not disputing Kaufmann's descriptions of the Latvians' activities, finds the things Kaufmann describes to have been typical of initial Nazi abuse of Jews in other locations. He also draws the inference that the lack of deliberate killings by the Latvians shows the Germans were at the root of the plans for the massacres.  Destruction of the synagogues and cemeteries  This synagogue on Stabu Street was burned on July 4, 1941. Max Kaufmann, a witness to the fire, stated that 30 Jews were burned alive inside.Ezergailis, The Holocaust in Latvia, at page 219. Jews were rounded up and forced into synagogues, which were then set on fire.Michelson, Frida, I Survived Rumbuli, at pages 60 to 63. The Great Choral Synagogue, on Gogol Street, was burned on July 4, 1941, with 20 Jews locked in the basement. Historian Press states that some of the victims were Lithuanian Jews who had taken refuge there.Press, The Murder of the Jews in Latvia, at page 46 Gertrude Schneider identifies the victims as mostly women and children. Frida Michelson, a Latvian Jew who had been working near Jelgava in a forced labor detail when the synagogues were burned, reported that on her return to Riga, she was told by a friend (who had heard it from someone else) that the halls and the backyard of the Choral Synagogue were filled with refugees from Lithuania. Perkonkrusts and \\"other Latvian hangers-on\\" surrounded the building, trapped the people inside, and set it on fire.Michelson, Frida, I Survived Rumbuli, at page 61. The burning of the synagogue was filmed by the Germans and later became part of a Wehrmacht newsreel, with the following narration: \\"The synagogue in Riga, which had been spared by the GPU commissars in their work of destruction, went up in flames a few hours later.\\" According to Bernard Press, Herberts Cukurs, a Latvia air force officer, and his gang of thugs, burned the synagogue on Stabu Street, but only after dragging Jews out of the neighboring houses and locking them inside: The holy scrolls were dragged out of the synagogues and burned. According to the Press, many Jews wearing prayer shawls and talith went into the fires to save the scrolls, and were all killed. Ezergailis disputes this, stating that no one entered the flames trying to save the holy scrolls. Only the Peitav Synagogue in the center of the city was not burned, and this was because of its location adjacent to apartment buildings and a church. The interior was however ransacked as had been all the other Jewish places of worship. The mob also attacked the Jewish cemeteries. Kaufmann also describes a number of incidents of Jews being locked into synagogues by Latvians which were then set on fire, including: Ezergailis does not find it credible that Jews were locked in the Great Choral Synagogue before it was set on fire. Ezergailis does acknowledge that there could have been 300 Lithuanian refugees in the synagogue before the fire was set. He postulates however that they would have been killed before the synagogue was set on fire. Among the Jews killed in the synagogue massacres were the cantor Mintz and his whole family, the rabbi Kilov, and Sarah Rashin (or Rashina), a 21-year-old internationally famed violinist.Michelson, Frida, I Survived Rumbuli, at page 62. (Another source says that Sarah Rashina was killed at Rumbula on November 30, 1941.)Feigmanis, Alexanders, Latvian Jewish Intelligentsia -- Victims of the Holocaust By July 16, 1941, Jews were no longer allowed on the streetcars of Riga.Michelson, Frida, I Survived Rumbuli, at pages 47 to 51 Armed Latvian policemen wearing red-white-red armbands arrested Jews on the streets. Those arrested were taken to the police prefecture near the railroad station and to other prisons.  Further restrictions on Jews  yellow star and forbidden to use the sidewalk At the end of July, the city administration switched from the German military to German civil administration. Head of the civil administration was a German named Nachtigall. Other Germans involved with the civil administration included Hinrich Lohse and Otto Drechsler. The Germans issued new decrees at this time to govern the Jews. Under \\"Regulation One\\", Jews were banned from public places, including city facilities, parks, and swimming pools. A second regulation required Jews to wear a yellow six-pointed star on their clothing,Michelson, I Survived Rumbuli, at page 55 with violation punishable by death. A Jew was also to be allotted only one-half of the food ration of a non-Jew.Kaufmann, The Destruction of the Jews of Latvia, at pages 16-18 By August, a German named Altmayer was in charge of Riga. The Nazis then registered all the Jews of Riga, and they further decreed that all Jews must wear a second yellow star, this one in the middle of their backs, and not use the sidewalks but walk in the roadway instead. Jews could be randomly assaulted with impunity by any non-Jew.Michelson, Frida, I Survived Rumbuli, at pages 68 to 69 The reason for wearing two stars was so Jews could readily be distinguished in a crowd. Later, when Lithuanian Jews were transported to the ghetto, they were subject to the same two-star rule.Schneider, Journey Into Terror, at page 32. Officially the Gestapo took over the prisons in Riga on July 11, 1941. By this time, the Latvian gangs had killed a number of the Jewish inmates.Kaufmann, The Destruction of the Jews of Latvia, at pages 18-20 The Gestapo initially set up its headquarters in the former Latvian Ministry of Agriculture building on Raina Boulevard. A special Jewish administration was set up. Gestapo torture and similar interrogation tactics were carried out in the basement of this building. Anyone who happened to survive this treatment was then sent to prison, where the inmates were starved to death. The Gestapo later relocated to a former museum at the corner of Kalpaka and Alexander boulevards. The Nazis also set up a Latvian puppet government, under a Latvian general named Danker, who was himself half-German. A \\"Bureau of Jewish Affairs\\" was set up at the Latvian police prefecture. Nuremberg-style laws were introduced, which tried to force people in marriages between a Jew and a non-Jew to divorce. If the couple refused to divorce, the woman, if a Jew, would be forced to undergo sterilization. Jewish physicians were forbidden to treat non-Jews, and non-Jewish physicians were forbidden to treat Jews.  Construction of the Riga ghetto  On July 21, the Riga occupation command decided to concentrate the Jewish workers in a ghetto. All Jews were registered; a Jewish council was also set up. Prominent Riga Jews, including Eljaschow, Blumenthal, and Minsker, were chosen to be on the council. All of them had been involved with the Jewish Latvian Freedom Fighters Association and it was hoped this would give them credibility in dealing with the occupation authorities. Council members were given large white armbands with a blue Star of David on them, which gave them the right to use the sidewalks and the streetcars. The Nazis issued an order that, by October 25, 1941, all Jews were to relocate to the Moscow suburb of Riga. As a result, about 30,000 Jews were concentrated in the small area known as the Moscow ForshtatMichelson, Frida, I Survived Rumbuli, at pages 69 to 73. by the end of October 1941. The Nazis fenced them in with barbed wire.Angrick and Klein, Die \\"Endl√∂sung\\" in Riga, at page 127 Anyone who went too close to the barbed wire was shot by the Latvian guards stationed around the ghetto perimeter. German police (Wachmeister) from Danzig commanded the guards. The guards engaged in random firing during the night.Kaufmann, The Destruction of the Jews of Latvia, at pages 23-29 Thirty-five days after the Riga ghetto was established, 24,000 of its inhabitants were force marched out of the city and shot at the nearby forest of Rumbula.

They were found to be priceless cultural artefacts but also to be subject to repatriation and they were removed permanently from public viewing. The other two-thirds of the found objects were sold to the Bishop Museum by Forbes' two expedition partners: Wilhelm Wagener and Friedrich Haehnisch.\\"Paradise Almost Lost\\". Christopher Pala. In: Museum ‚Äì March/April Issue 2008  http://www.aam-us.org/pubs/mn/nagpra.cfm Early years Born in Scotland, the son of Alexander and Mary (McHattie) Forbes, he was educated in the local schools. Career He began working in the private estate nurseries of Moray, Scotland in 1879 and later in the forests of the same estate. In 1882, he worked in the nurseries of Dixon & Co., Edinburgh. In 1883 he became the Foreman Forester for the estate of Fletcher's Saltoun Hall, the seat of the oldest and largest private library in Scotland. In 1887, at the behest of William H. Purvis, David Forbes travelled to Kukuihaele near Waipio Valley, Hawaii, via Cape Horn, to manage an experiment in cinchona cultivation above the sugar line. Purvis, who had already introduced the macadamia nut from Australia, recognised the potential benefits of finding a species of tree that would thrive in the land above the sugarcane, above 1500 feet, called the sugar line. The bark of the cinchona tree imported from Ceylon had a promising yield ratio between bark and quinine. When Purvis' plantation was transferred to the Pacific Sugar Mill Company, in which Samuel Parker invested in 1879, D. M. Forbes succeeded C. Von Mengersen as manager, running the Pacific Sugar Mill from 1893 to 1907. Forbes returned to Scotland in 1910 but did not remain. By 1912, he was back in Hawaii, in Waiakea, in Hilo, where he took the position of manager of the Waiakea Mill Company of Hilo. Finally, he settled in Waimea. In 1929, he was appointed to the rank of District Magistrate, South Kohala,\\"Annual Report of the Governor of Hawaii to the Secretary of the Interior for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1929\\" and was reappointed in 1932.\\"Annual Report of the Governor of Hawaii to the Secretary of the Interior for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1932\\" He was also the founder of Scouting in Waimea.Catherine Lougher: a biography, page 2, written by Thomas H.

Despite the best available location, ample drainage and good soil, the Cinchona trees did not grow as healthy as most exotic plants introduced from a warm climate. Their value became so low compared to the price of labour that the attempt was abandoned in 1905.Een en ander over kina en overzicht der cultuur van kina.

Forbes originated the \\"Waimea Vegetable and Flower Show\\" which developed under his leadership into the principal annual horticultural show in West Hawaii. Forbes planted some camphorwood seedlings in the grounds of the manager's house of the Pacific Sugar Mill Company in the 1880s. Half a century later he used the fragrant wood of these same trees to carve the altar for the Imiola Church in Waimea. Carving of the altar was completed after his death by his son David Merlyn Lougher Forbes. He introduced the Jack Fruit tree to Hawaii.

The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) is a facility located in McCracken County, Kentucky, near Paducah, Kentucky that produced enriched uranium 1952‚Äì2013. It is owned by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The PGDP was the only operating uranium enrichment facility in the United States in the period 2001‚Äì2010. The Paducah plant produced low-enriched uranium, originally as feedstock for military reactors, weapons and later for nuclear power fuel. The gaseous diffusion plant covers of a site. The four process buildings cover , and consumed a peak electrical demand of 3,040 megawatts. DOE leased the facility to a publicly held company, USEC, from the mid 1990s. USEC ceased operations in 2013 and returned the facility to the Department of Energy for decontamination and decommissioning. History The former Kentucky Ordnance Works site was chosen from a candidate list of eight sites in 1950. The construction contractor was F.H. McGraw of Hartford, Connecticut and the operating company was Union Carbide. The plant was opened in 1952 as a government-owned, contractor-operated facility producing enriched uranium to fuel military reactors and for use in nuclear weapons. The mode of enrichment was gaseous diffusion of uranium hexafluoride to separate the lighter fissile isotope U-235 from the heavier non-fissile isotope U-238. The Paducah plant produced low-enriched uranium which was further refined at Portsmouth and the K-25 plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. From the 1960s the Paducah plant was dedicated to uranium enrichment for nuclear power plants. In 1984, the operating contract was assumed by Martin Marietta Energy Systems. Lockheed Martin operated the plant until USEC leased the facility in the mid 1990s. The Paducah plant had a capacity of 11.3 million separative work units per year (SWU/year) in 1984. 1812 stages were located in five buildings: C-310 with 60 stages, C-331 with 400 stages, C-333 with 480 stages, C-335 with 400 stages and C-337 with 472 stages. Before cessation of uranium enrichment on May 31, 2013, the Paducah facility consumed about 2,000 megawatts of electricity. Power for the Paducah gaseous diffusion plant came from the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Employment and economic impact During enrichment operations approximately 1200 people were needed to operate the plant. After cessation of enrichment activities the site employs around 1400 through contractors to maintain the grounds, portions of the infrastructure, deactivate, optimize utilities and to remediate environmental contamination at the site. The facility has had a positive economic impact on the local economy and continues to be an economic driver for the community. Contamination Plant operations have contaminated the site over time. The primary contamination of concern is trichloroethylene (TCE), which was a commonly used degreaser at the site. TCE leaked and contaminated groundwater on and off the site. The groundwater is also contaminated with trace amounts of technetium-99, a radioactive fission product; Other site contaminants include polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs). Through normal operations, portions of the plant, primarily process equipment, are contaminated with uranium. In 1988, TCE and trace amounts of technetium-99 were found in the drinking water wells of residences located near the plant site in McCracken County, Kentucky. To protect human health, the Department of Energy provided city water at no cost to the affected residents, and continues to do so. Lawsuits In the 1980s, the family of former employee Joe Harding brought a lawsuit relating to medical conditions that they believed he incurred from having worked at the Paducah plant. His widow Clara Harding eventually settled the suit for $12,000. In 1998 a lawsuit was brought by employees of the plant against Lockheed Martin, one of the operators of the Paducah plant, relating to falsifying of contamination reports. The Department of Energy later joined this suit. In 1999 a class action lawsuit was brought against the Paducah plant for former and current employees who believed that they had suffered significant medical expenses because of exposure to ionizing radiation at the plant. The suit was dismissed in 2003 because a judge ruled that the plant was covered by the Price-Anderson Act. Cleanup status The Department of Energy continues to remediate groundwater contamination. Significant progress has been made in reducing concentrations of TCE in the groundwater by using pump and treat as well as electrical resistance heating. Twenty five out of over 500 inactive facilities at the site have been demolished. Other site facilities are being deactivated and prepared for demolition. In 2019 314 million dollars was allocated towards the cleanup through an act of legislationhttps://thehill.com/homenews/senate/475831-mcconnell-flexes- reelection-muscle-with-1b-gift-for-kentucky.

The building it is housed in was originally home to the convent of the Order of the Merced Calzada de la Asunci√≥n, founded by St. Peter Nolasco during the reign of King Ferdinand III of Castile. Extensive remodeling in the early 17th century was led by the architect Juan de Oviedo y de la Bandera.
