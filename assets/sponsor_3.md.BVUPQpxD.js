As author and founder of the art magazine Klingen (1917-1919), Salto was also an important contributor to the art debate in Denmark. He made his debut as an artist in 1911, but his primary career as a ceramist took off at the 1925 Paris Exhibition. He was the son of Director H.C. Salto, married to Kamma Salto and father of Naja Salto.  Early career  He graduated from Frederiksberg Latin- og Realskole in 1907 and was a student of Holger Gr√∏nvold at Det tekniske Selskabs Skole from 1907. Salto then studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1909 to 1914 under Peter Rostrup B√∏yesen. In 1916, Salto Paris visited Paris, where he met Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. This meeting became a landmark for Salto's artistic ambitions and his influence on the pioneering ideas of the time. In 1921, Salto founded the group De Fire (The Four), consisting of Svend Johansen, Vilhelm Lundstr√∏m and Karl Larsen. The group spent a large part of the 1920s in Paris, where they lived and worked together. The four artists first exhibited at the turn of the year 1920/1921 and continued regularly until 1928. The group profiled itself as modern, young and progressive, and its exhibitions were surrounded by debate and controversy.  Ceramics  Throughout the 1920s, his artistic focus shifted from painting to ceramics and he made about 3,000 different stoneware works from 1923 to 1950. A large part of these were made in the Carl Halier ceramic workshop in Frederiksberg. Among Salto's first works was the polycrome porcelain (Bing & Gr√∏ndahl, 1923‚Äì25), which was presented in the Danish Pavilion at the World Exhibition in 1925 (Exposition Internationale des Arts d√©coratifs et industriels modernes). Then followed stoneware in collaboration with Carl Halier (1929‚Äì30) and Saxo ceramics (1931‚Äì32). From the mid-1930s he worked mainly with The Royal Porcelain factory in Copenhagen. Salto developed his ceramic stoneware works throughout his career and experimented with unusually rich glazes and organic shapes. He is mainly known for his three main styles characterized by ornamental simplification. 1) The rifled style, based on simple repetitive patterns. 2) The buttoned style, inspired by chestnuts and eucalyptus fruit. 3) The budding style, a reflection of naturally growing plants. Salto used Chinese and classic glazes such as solfatara and sung, among others. From 1951 to 1959, Salto led the renewal of Sonnes Frize at Thorvaldsens Museum. He was a member of Gr√∏nningen 1935-45, and received the Eckersberg Medal in 1938 and Prince Eugen Medal in 1959, and the Grand Prix at the Milan Triennial in 1951. Axel Salto worked with the Danish master book binder August Sandgren, where they designed different papers for bookbinding.  Klingen  After the trip to Paris in 1916 and the meeting with Pablo Picasso, Salto founded the Danish art magazine Klingen (The Blade) - published from 1917 to 1919. Salto was both editor and contributor. Although the magazine was only published for two years, it became important as a forum for modernism art as well as the new ideas of the time, with articles by Otto Gelsted, Poul Henningsen and Harald Giersing, and original artwork by Vilhelm Lundstr√∏m, Olaf Rude, William Scharff and Axel Salto himself.

Amina was arrested in 1998 and a government-appointed doctor established that at the time of the crime she was between 14 and 15. al Tuhaif has continually maintained her innocence.  Early Life  Amina was married as a child to Hezn Hasam Qabail (when she was eleven). She was raised in a rural area in Yemen and she did not attend school.  Murder  = Other suspects = Amina claims that her husband's cousin strangled Hezn Hasam Qabail to death. At the time, the two were having a land dispute. This cousin is also on death-row for the same murder. Critiques of Amina's trial also argue that the force required to strangle a full grown man, and then drag his body was to the cistern to make it look as if he had drowned, would have taken substantial strength beyond that of a child. Amina has also stated she was tortured into confessing. = Amina's death sentence = Amina did not have proper legal representation, and was scheduled for execution in 2002 (when she would be old enough to be hanged under Yemen's laws). This sparked controversy because of her age. In Yemen, children can only receive the death sentence if they are at least 15 years old at the time of the murder (and the medical doctor was unsure of her exact age). Amina did not have any documents proving her age and the government thus went forth with prosecuting her as an adult despite the doctor's findings. Yemen has also signed the UN Child Rights Convention, which states that children cannot receive capital punishment (meaning only 18 year olds can get the death sentence).  Rape and pregnancy  al Tuhaif was raped by a prison guard while at al-Mahaweet prison and subsequently became pregnant. The pregnancy resulted in Yemen being unable to carry out the death sentence because Yemeni law states a mother cannot be executed until the child is two (when they are no longer breastfeeding).  Stay of execution  A stay of execution was granted until 2005, due to the pregnancy.  Demand for new trial  Various celebrities, non-profits and international organizations demanded a new trial for Amina. From Lilli Gruber, Emma Bonino, to Amnesty international.  Blood money paid  After the controversy, Yemen officials used the Sharia Law alternative to the death penalty, which is to pay the victim's family \\"blood money.\\" The payment is considered an acceptable alternative to execution. Dr Attard Montalto offered to pay the sum, however, the relatives already refused an offer of blood money arguing that accepting money for the woman's release would imply they were accepting that a family member of theirs had committed the murder without Amina's involvement.  Released for time served  Due to the controversy and her age, Amina was released after she served the maximum youth sentence of 10 years.  Film  Filmmaker Khadija Al-Salami, created the documentary is Amina (2006), which was screened during the Arab Film Festival in October in the San Francisco Bay Area. Khadija Al-Salami appealed directly to the president of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to overturn Amina's conviction.

College career He was a star soccer player at Simsbury High School in Simsbury, Connecticut and Notre Dame recruited him for its soccer program. In 1989 and 1990, he was the team‚Äôs leading scorer. In 1991, the football team‚Äôs starting placekicker, Craig Hentrich, sprained his knee and Head Coach Lou Holtz looked to the soccer team for a kicker to handle kickoffs. Pendergast has never played organized football, but joined the team as a walk-on. In the 1992 Sugar Bowl against Florida, Hentrich again suffered an injury forcing Pendergast to attempt his first field goal in a competitive game. He made the field goal later kicked three extra points and another field goal as Notre Dame won 39-28. With Hentrich healthy, returned to kickoff duty in the 1992‚Äì1993 season, but had his opportunity to start the following year. He was the team‚Äôs leading scorer, converting 14 of 19 field goal attempts and kicked the go- ahead field goal in the 1994 Cotton Bowl Classic as Notre Dame defeated Texas A&M; 24-21. Gambling Involvement In college, Pendergast began betting on sports, sometimes wagering $500 to $1,000 over a weekend. He also began gambling at a nearby riverboat casino, betting $25 to $50 a hand. After he graduated, he turned down opportunities to try out for professional football and moved to Chicago to try and start a rock band. There, he accumulated $20,000 in gambling debt, financing his gambling with credit cards. In 1995, he learned that Kenneth Dion Lee, a Northwestern Basketball player who had been the team‚Äôs best three-point shooter, had received threats from a bookmaker over his own gambling debts. He convinced Lee, Dewey Williams and Matt Purdy to shave points in upcoming Wildcats games. Lee served a six-game suspension for betting on college sports, while Purdy, also a Northwestern football player, was accused of intentionally fumbling the football as a result of his own gambling debts. Pendergast agreed to pay Lee $4,000 for their successful bet in one game and doubled his offer to $8,000 for the following game. The players were to ensure that the team failed to cover the point spread in several upcoming games. Because Northwestern would not be favored by oddsmakers, the team would have to lose by a larger margin than the posted spread. Pendergast would bet against Northwestern in the games. The scheme was only successful once, with Northwestern equaling the spread against Wisconsin resulting in little to no payout and unexpectedly covering the spread against Michigan costing him $20,150 and ending the scheme. His one successful wager was against Penn State, where he won $10,000. The game against Michigan was particularly tough as he had bet that Northwestern would fail to cover a 25 1/2-point spread and ended up losing by only 17 points. In total, via an associate, he made bets of $40,000 to $70,000. The Federal government began an investigation of Lee and Purdy after Northwestern suspended him for his prior gambling and forwarded the results to the US Attorney. In 1998, the government charged five people, including Pendergast, Lee and Williams over their activities. Pendergast pleases guilty to the charges and was sentenced to two months in prison while Lee and Williams received one-month sentences. The judge considered that Pendergast and Lee cooperated and were already giving speeches to student-athletes over the dangers of gambling. Personal After his release from prison, former Notre Dame player Peter Schivarelli, who was a manager for the band Chicago offered Pendergast a job as assistant manager for the band. As of 2018, Pendergast is a registered nurse and continues to speak about his activities and his recovery from gambling addiction.

It was the first FM transmitter in the network. Prior to operating noncommercially, the 102.7 facility was a commercial radio station from its sign-on in 1990 to 2007. History =As a commercial radio station= On July 15, 1990, WPJB signed on. Reviving a historic call sign that had been abandoned at 105.1 FM in Providence when it became WWLI in 1985, WPJB broadcast an adult contemporary format and was owned and operated by Full Power Radio of Narragansett, Inc. Full Power Radio of Narragansett sold WPJB to Back Bay Broadcasters for $1.05 million in 1997; the station became a simulcast of Back Bay's rhythmic CHR outlet WWKX \\"Kix 106\\" and changed its call letters to WAKX to reflect the new programming. Back Bay became AAA Entertainment in 1999; the two companies were commonly owned. WWKX-WAKX added Howard Stern to its program lineup in 1998. The stations carried Stern through the end of his terrestrial radio run, though, alongside some other Citadel stations, \\"Hot 106\\" began cutting his show short because Stern was excessively promoting his soon-to-be-new home at Sirius Satellite Radio. Citadel Broadcasting acquired WWKX, WAKX, and a station in Montauk, New York, from AAA Entertainment for $16.5 million in 2003; the sale of WAKX was not finished until 2005. Citadel immediately optioned WAKX, along with WKKB in Middletown, to Davidson Media Group in a $7.5 million sale, breaking the simulcast. By 2007, WAKX was running a smooth jazz format, leased out to Craig Rapoza. =Sale to Rhode Island Public Radio= On March 23, 2007, the former Foundation for Ocean State Public Radio, renamed Rhode Island Public Radio, announced its acquisition of WRNI (1290 AM), a National Public Radio member station run by WBUR-FM in Boston. At the same time, the foundation announced that it was buying WAKX from Davidson for $2.65 million, funded by the Rhode Island Foundation. The acquisition brought NPR service for the first time to southern Rhode Island communities that were outside of WRNI's coverage area, beginning May 17, 2007, when WAKX became WRNI-FM and began carrying WRNI's programming full-time. WAKX's former jazz programming moved to WALE (990 AM). In 2018, concurrent with RIPR's relaunch as The Public's Radio, the call letters were changed to WNPE. HD Radio multicast From March 2013 until February 2018, MVYradio leased the HD2 multicast channel of WNPE to broadcast a modified content stream of WMVY 88.7 FM on Martha's Vineyard; this fed translator W243AI 96.5 FM, which broadcast from the roof of Newport Hospital. This allowed WMVY programming to continue being heard on the translator after the original WMVY was sold to Boston University and became WBUA.

It is the first release featuring 3D models for characters instead of the traditional 2D. In addition of the traditional mechanics, it introduces role-playing elements, allowing to have up to three allies in team, as well as over 60 side missions. Also, it introduces the new protagonist, Ally.  Modes  Puyo Puyo Chronicle offers a series of mechanics and modes present in previous releases, as well as a story mode in RPG format. = RPG mode = The main mode. Starring Arle, who was attracted by a mysterious glow from a book, being moved to another world. Arle will meet Ally, who will accompany her on her adventure for that new world. The story mode has a number of features:  Quest  In \\"RPG mode\\", the game progresses basically by achieving \\"missions\\" that occur in various places. The search has a \\"main search\\" related to the progress of the story and a \\"sub-search\\" not related to the progress of the main story, and a reward can be obtained when the search is accomplished.  Skill Battle  The \\"Skill Battle\\" begins when you touch a monster in the field. In this mode, if you erase Puyos, you can drop nuisance Puyos on your opponent and attack. During the battle, the monsters can send nuisance Puyos to the opponent, and if they fall to the playing field, the character's HP will decrease. In addition, when the Puyos accumulate to the top of the board, the remaining HP are considerably reduced and the field restarts. Nuisance Puyos will not fall during the offset. If you win in battle, you can earn coins and improve the character card. In addition, the seeds of the chain appear in their field at the beginning of the battle, the HP/MP will always recover fully after the battle is over. Touching a monster from behind in the field increases the \\"chain seed\\" that appears at the beginning of the battle on a chain. On the other hand, if the monster is touched from behind, it will be \\"unexpected\\" and nuisance Puyo will fall to the enemy's board and take damage.  Skills  Each character has a different \\"skill\\", and can be activated at will by consuming MP while playing. The skills have a variety of effects, such as changing the color of the puyos on the board and increasing the powers of the character.  Team  In skill battles, a team is formed organizing up to 3 characters and up to 4 \\"Puyo Puyo Cards\\". The HP and MP status of the team changes according to the character and organization of the cards. When a character advances through the story or wins a battle, the character joins the group and can be added to the player's team. Also, if you defeat a monster along the way, you can join a group. In addition, the battles of \\"Skill Battle\\" of \\"Minna de Puyo Puyo\\" and \\"Internet\\" are carried out using the team data created in the \\"RPG mode\\".  Character and item cards  Characters can be strengthened by equipping with Puyo Puyo cards that can be obtained from village stores and treasure chests in the countryside. There are several types of Puyo Puyo cards that can be combined to create stronger cards.  Boss battle with everyone  There is a \\"Boss battle with everyone\\" mode for 2-4 players who collaborate with other players in local communications to defeat the boss. In this mode, you can challenge the use of your saved data, and you can get a rare \\"Puyo Puyo Card\\" by defeating the boss. The rules of the battle are the same as for the previous \\"Battle of Skills\\", but in this mode, when the \\"Condition of Opportunity Time\\" shown at the beginning of the battle is reached, \\"Time of Opportunity\\" (same that \\"Fever Mode\\" of \\"Puyo Puyo Fever\\") Occurs for a certain time. = Single player = Single-player mode through the different rules and modes available. = Local multiplayer = A mode for battles between two or four players in the local network. = Online multiplayer = Mode for two or four players online in three different rules: Skill Battle, Puyo Puyo Dori and Puyo Puyo Fever. You can participate in the following modes: * \\"National Puzzle League\\", where you can play one on one, advancing in the ranking * \\"Club\\", where you can play between two or four players with custom rules. = Lessons = A way in which the player can learn the basic rules and chain techniques of Puyo Puyo. = Data = There are \\"stores\\" where you can see the results of each mode, change the options and buy several items (hidden items) using points to play.  Rules  The game has several rules available, most of them previous releases, among some: * Puyo Puyo, with the classic Puyo Puyo rules (limit is the last row of the third column, without offset). * Puyo Puyo Tsu, with the rules of the aforementioned game (the same rules as the first game, with the addition of offset) * Puyo Puyo SUN, with the SUN rules (with the introduction of the SUN Puyos, which award a large number of points when erasing adjacent Puyos) * Puyo Puyo Fever, with the rules introduced in that release (limit is the third and fourth column, and Fever mode) * Nazo Puyo, with various puzzle challenges with pre-set pieces * Big Puyo Rush, in which the panel is reduced to 6x3, and when connecting 3 or more Puyos, they disappear. * Chibi Puyo, in which the panel is increased to 10x18, and the goal is to reach a star buried between solid garbage Puyos; when erased, it will send infinite nuisance Puyos to the opponent  References   See also  * Puyo Puyo Quest, Puyo Puyo mobile game on which some features of this game are based.

It was owned by Grupo Pegaso, headed by Alejandro Burillo Azc√°rraga. History Red W Interactiva commenced operations on October 22, 2001, featuring a format composed entirely of talk radio programs. It provided talk shows, radio serials, entertainment and celebrity programs, and an audio simulcast of Multivisi√≥n's main newscast. The network signed up dozens of affiliates across the country, as many as 48 at launch, and was heard in Mexico City on XEUR-AM 1530. Red W Interactiva's live, talk-heavy format was cited as being a good fit for stations in the interior of the country, at the time primarily on AM. The network also planned opt-out windows in its programming to incorporate local content. The name of the network attracted some concern with regard to its similarity to XEW radio, colloquially known as \\"la W\\". According to Burillo, the name was chosen in order to \\"revive the tradition started by Emilio Azc√°rraga Vidaurreta\\". Within months of operation, its owner, Grupo Pegaso, encountered cash flow difficulties that led it to close less profitable ventures, including Red W Interactiva. The network ceased operations on January 31, 2002, with the closure costing Pegaso more than one million dollars and leading to layoffs at the network's Mexico City headquarters. A group of the network's executives, led by Eugenio Bernal Macouzet, sought to continue operation of the network, saying that Pegaso had not given the project enough time to mature. Pegaso's larger problems led to the sale of its core cellular telephony business to Telef√≥nica's Movistar division in 2002; the company also retained XEZHO-AM, a radio station in Zihuatanejo, Guerrero, whose acquisition closed after the discontinuation of operations, on March 25, 2002.2005 concession renewal for XEZHO-AM. Note that Alejandro Burillo signed for the concession. The network had negotiated the rights to radio coverage of the 2002 FIFA World Cup together with Radiorama, MVS Radio, Cadena RASA, and Radio 13; the deal did not continue after Red W Interactiva was shuttered. The network's former affiliates also manifested their discontent against Grupo Pegaso for not maintaining several of the commitments the network had made once it discontinued operations. Programs In its brief three months on the air, Red W Interactiva carried a wide range of news, talk and audience participation programs. Daniel Bisogno, one of the hosts of TV Azteca's Ventaneando entertainment talk show, hosted the network's morning show, El exprimidor. Women's programming included the magazine program Diario de una mujer, hosted by Margarita Gralia.

Jabberwocky Tower is part of The Enchantments within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. It belongs to the Stuart Range which is subset of the Cascade Range. Jabberwocky Tower is situated east of Colchuck Lake and west of Enchantment Peak. Precipitation runoff drains into Icicle Creek, a tributary of the Wenatchee River. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the Cascades experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Jabberwocky Tower The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

Biography In the mid-1940s, Lili Massaferro studied Philosophy and Literature. She married very young to free herself from her father. However, for almost 50 years she lived in her second paternal home, at 400 Conesa Street. She had four children, two with Manuel Belloni ‚Äì Manuel and Liliana ‚Äì and two with Marcelo Laferrere (son of the playwright and politician Gregorio de Laferr√®re). She worked in public relations, responsible for getting advertisers for Gente magazine. Under the pseudonym Lili Gacel, she was the protagonist of advertisements for Arizona cigarettes, and acted in several films in the late 1950s (such as The House of the Angel, based on a novel by Beatriz Guido, who was one of her acquaintances at the time). She came to hate that experience in the world of entertainment. She formed a trio of inseparable friends with and , the latter of whom would be assassinated in 1978. =Personal life= Among her circle of male friends and \\"suitors\\" were Bobby Aizemberg, Hector √Ålvarez Murena, Fernando Birri, Adolfo Bioy Casares, Jorge Luis Borges, Miguel Brasc√≥, , Leopoldo Torre Nilsson, and Oski. Son's killing In the late 1960s, Massaferro's son became a soldier in the Peronist Armed Forces (FAP). recalls that moment because of the great discussion he had with Manolo when he was going to Europe in 1969, who told him, \\"you will not see me anymore because I am going to go underground,\\" to which Lernoud replied, \\"you are crazy; you do not know whom you are going to kill, for whom you are going to die.\\" On 8 March 1971, the Tigre police killed Manolo (age 23), his last words reportedly being the cry \\"Viva Per√≥n!\\" He left behind his wife Valentina Nina Onetto (born 1947) with a daughter, Mar√≠a (born 1969), and pregnant with her daughter Victoria (born 1971), who is currently an actress. From that moment on, Lili Massaferro became a member of the (FAR) and, after a brief political career, became a political leader at age 44. Known as \\"La Pepa\\", she ended up being the general secretary of the women's branch of the Montonero Peronist Movement. Arrest Francisco \\"Paco\\" Urondo (1930‚Äì1976) Because of her militancy, Massaferro had to go underground, and was forced to leave behind her two children with Laferrere. On 14 February 1973, she was arrested at Ingeniero Maschwitz along with , Paco Urondo, and Alicia Rabboy. \\"Freedom to the combatants\\" Three months later she regained her freedom thanks to the presidential amnesty of H√©ctor Jos√© C√°mpora. To celebrate ‚Äì still dressed in her prison uniform, and with her lawyers and ‚Äì she went to eat a puchero at the restaurant El Tropez√≥n. That same year (1973) she was the organizer of the Agrupaci√≥n Evita of the women's branch of the Montoneros. In 1974 she was invited by General Omar Torrijos to visit Panama and learn about the Panamanian revolutionary process. In 1972 Massaferro began a partnership with the journalist and militant Francisco \\"Paco\\" Urondo. When he left her, Lili denounced him before the Montonero leadership ‚Äì of strong Catholic and nationalist origins ‚Äì as being degraded \\"by bourgeois deviations\\", having committed \\"carnal infidelities\\" (Montoneros followed the rules dictated for the \\"New Man\\" by Che Guevara). Urondo was assigned to Mendoza, where he ended up being identified and killed. Exile The poet and journalist Juan Gelman (1930‚Äì2014) After the paramilitary organization Triple A appeared in 1975, Massaferro traveled to Rome ‚Äì now in a partnership with Juan Gelman ‚Äì and went to work with Argentina's Delia Ana Fanego on a committee to reveal Triple A's actions and the repression in Argentina in the Roman newspapers. In the late dictatorship When the National Reorganization Process began on 24 March 1976, Lili Massaferro continued to fight against the bloody dictatorship of Videla from her position as a member of the women's branch of the MPM. In 1977 she participated in the publication of the book Argentina: Proceso al Genocidio, together with Eduardo Luis Duhalde, , and Gustavo Roca. She toured Europe from top to bottom several times, visiting Amsterdam, Stockholm, Geneva, London, Madrid, Paris, and Rome. She alerted governments, discussed with diplomats, made and accompanied complaints about thousands of the disappeared, gave shelter, and protected the relatives' organizations (who made their first trips from Argentina). In the late 1980s, to support herself, she sold jewelry on Goya Street in Madrid. Return In early 1984 Lili Massaferro again saw her children, who traveled to Spain. She returned to Argentina in 1989. She reconciled with her second husband Marcelo Lafferrere, and bought a farm in Marcos Paz ‚Äì 50 km from the center of Buenos Aires ‚Äì where she received her grandchildren and cared for animals and plants. She was one of those interviewed in 's documentary Montoneros. Cazadores de utop√≠as.

Some software allows precise control during the design process, and also removes the non-functional pads during output file creation. Furthermore, some board manufacturers remove non-functional pads during data preparations. Occasionally, this process of non-functional pad removal is also called unused pad suppression. The benefits of removing the non-functional pads are limited. Electrically, it creates needless extra capacitance in certain designs, which needs to be removed. Removing non-functional pads can improve the drilling process, as it lessens drill wear. Non-functional pad removal can influence the reliability. (e.g. barrel cracking failure mode). Removal can increase or decrease reliability. Depending on design parameters, removing the non-functional pads can free up routing space.

They also collaborated with Damnation A.D. under the name Bloodnation to contribute to a compilation, the group were signed onto Victory Records, who issued the band's debut Entheogen in 1996. After extensive touring, the group's second album The Seraphim Fall was issued in 1998, and the group quietly entered a hiatus. The group would later reunite in 2001, and issue their third album Three Humid Nights in the Cypress Trees, which was released in 2002. The album was engineered by Steve Albini and was recorded at his Electrical Audio recording studio. A music video was produced for \\"Holy Rollin Homicide\\", and the group would disband once more a year later. In 2014, the group would reform for a special one-off performance at the A389 Recordings' 10th anniversary festival, performing with groups such as Integrity and Infest. That same year the label also issued a double-LP reissue of Entheogen, a limited edition live album, and a limited edition 5\\" of a rare outtake titled \\"Embrace\\". The song was recorded in 1994, and was forgotten until a hardcore blog made a post about it years later. In 2017, the group made an appearance for This Is Hardcore 2017. Since then, the band has been active and have toured locally in Florida and around the country.

He feels restricted. Life smothers him.

Gorky considered his hero an atypical figure in the context of Russian merchant community. \\"Foma is just a sprightly man looking for freedom but feeling thwarted by life's conventions,\\" he wrote in the same letter, promising to soon embark upon another novel, telling by way of redressing the balance, the life of a 'true' tradesman, a smart and cynical crook, going by the name of Mikhail Vyagin (the project never materialized). In his correspondence Gorky complained about numerous cuts made by the governmental censors. He radically revised the text twice, in 1900 and 1903.  Reception  The novel was highly rated among the socialist critics and writers. Jack London in his review writes: \\"Foma Gordyeeff\\" is a big book--not only is the breadth of Russia in it, but the expanse of life. Yet, though in each land, in this world of marts and exchanges, this age of trade and traffic, passionate figures rise up and demand of life what its fever is, in \\"Foma Gordyeeff\\" it is a Russian who so rises up and demands. For Gorky, the Bitter One, is essentially a Russian in his grasp on the facts of life and in his treatment. All the Russian self-analysis and insistent introspection are his. And, like all his brother Russians, ardent, passionate protest impregnates his work.\\"  Adaptations  The eponymous Soviet film by Mark Donskoy, based on the novel, came out in 1959.

Though it had flown earlier it could manage only one very brief flight at the Contest, ending in a destructive crash. Design and development Reports of the first German glider contest, held at the Wasserkuppe in the late summer of 1920, generated considerable interest in Poland, leading to the First Polish Glider Contest at Czarna G√≥ra between 30 August and 13 September 1923. The contest was not a great success, limited by novice designers and pilots and a poor site, but the Karpi≈Ñski SL.1 Akar was by far the most successful entrant. The Pirat was a cumbersome and crudely built wooden glider and was the heaviest at the contest. It was designed by Konrad Kuƒáfir, who also supervised its construction at the Suchedni√≥w Casting Factory, Kielce. It had a rectangular plan, two spar, fabric-covered parasol wing. This was wire-braced from above via a pair of kingposts, held over the central fuselage on two slotted steel sheets and braced outboard from the spars to the lower fuselage longerons on each side by a parallel pair of steel-tube struts. The fabric-covered fuselage had a rectangular section, wooden-framed structure which tapered in plan but not profile to the tail. There was a single-seat, open cockpit. The Pirat's fabric-covered, wire-braced tail surfaces were generous. Its tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage; both it and the separate elevators were rectangular. The fin was triangular and carried a rhomboidal rudder, the sloping lower edge providing room for the elevators to operate. Its undercarriage was tall, with the mainwheels on a cross-axle mounted on the lower fuselage longerons by a V-strut at each end. The Pirat flew before any other contestant, piloted by Kuƒáfir on 6 June 1923 from MƒÖchocice G√≥rne in the ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Mountains. The undercarriage was somewhat damaged on landing. The duration of this flight and any others made before the contest are not known but at the contest on 8 September it flew only for 9 seconds before crashing; the Pirat was totally destroyed.

Founded as splinter faction of the Sadrist Movement, Jaysh al- Mu'ammal is supported by Iran and former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.  History  Jaysh al-Mu'ammal reportedly emerged due to disputes among the Iraqi Sadrist Movement. After the Syrian Civil War's outbreak, Muqtada al-Sadr had decided not to aid the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, which led to discontent among his followers. One of the leading commanders of the Sadrist Peace Companies, Sa'ad Sawar, openly broke with Muqtada al-Sadr and travelled to Damascus, where he joined another Iraqi militia, Liwa Assad Allah al-Ghalib fi al-Iraq wa al-Sham, to fight against the Syrian insurgents. As time went on, disputes over the leadership and course of the Sadrist Movement continued, with a number of factions breaking off. After returning to Iraq, Sa'ad Sawar consequently managed to rally a substantial number of dissatisfied Sadrists to his cause, and announced the foundation of \\"Jaysh al-Mu'ammal\\" in June 2016. The new group reportedly received substantial aid from Nouri al-Maliki, the former Prime Minister of Iraq and a rival to Muqtada al-Sadr, who provided Jaysh al-Mu'ammal with 3 million United States dollar in cash, weapons worth $1,5 million, and the support from a number of tribal sheikhs in central and southern Iraq. Sa'ad Sawar also received support from Iran and other splinter faction of the Sadrist Movements as well, such as Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq. Since then, Jaysh al-Mu'ammal has been operating in Syria and Iraq, where it has joined the Popular Mobilization Forces as \\"99th Brigade\\". By mid-2018, Jaysh al-Mu'ammal was involved in anti-ISIL counter-insurgency operations in Saladin Governorate.  Organization and ideology  Led by Sa'ad Sawar, Jaysh al- Mu'ammal is headquartered in Sadr City, Baghdad, where it also recruits most of its forces. A number of pro-Nouri al-Maliki elements in central and southern Iraq have also joined the group or at least provide support. Unlike Muqtada al-Sadr, who is focused on Iraq, Sa'ad Sawar has emphasized his readiness to provide military support to Shia groups outside of his home country. His group consequently operates in both Iraq as well as Syria, and has also declared its willingness to support the Houthis in the Yemeni Civil War, and to fight with the Bahraini opposition against the Sunni House of Khalifa.

Quadrifoglio is Italian for four-leaf clover. The quadrifoglio is usually placed on the side panels of the car, above or behind the front wheels‚Äîon the front wings in the case of modern vehicles. The logo consists of a green cloverleaf with four leaves contained in a triangle.  History  The four-leaf clover symbol appeared for the first time on one of the four RL Targa Florio autos in 1923.Alfa Romeo: Quadrifoglio: story of Alfa's best performance car  Alfa Romeo, accessdate: 26. August 2018 This auto was specially prepared by Giuseppe Merosi for the Targa Florio in Sicily, considered the most prestigious auto racing competition at the time. RL Targa Florio by Ugo Sivocci. Despite high aspirations, major success at racing eluded Alfa Romeo until this time. Alfa had won some class victories and minor competitions, but due to inexperience and misfortune Alfa had not won a major international event. For the Targa Florio of 1923, Merosi developed four cars, entrusting them to Antonio Ascari, Enzo Ferrari, Giulio Masetti and Ugo Sivocci. Sivocci, Ferrari's discoverer and friend, was a pilot of great experience and technical competence, but had poor luck and was considered \\"l'eterno secondo\\" (Italian for the eternal second). 33 Stradale in 1967, inserted next to the Autodelta logo. To ward away his misfortune, Sivocci had painted on the grille of his car a white square in which stood a green four-leaf clover. The outcome of that Targa Florio race on the track in Madonie convinced the superstitious the quadrifoglio charm was effective. Towards the end of the race the chances of victory were limited to the leading trio, composed of Ascari and Sivocci, followed by Minoia on a Steyr VI Klausen Sport. Just two hundred meters from the finish, the Alfa RL of Ascari went out. Ascari's lead allowed his mechanics to arrive in time to restart his engine, but in their euphoria they all got on board to cross the finish line with Ascari, causing a disqualification. So Ascari returned to the point where he had stopped his car to retrace that part of the track. He finished second behind Sivocci who, meanwhile, had crossed the finish line as a winner, assuring Alfa Romeo their first international victory. Giulia TI Super of 1964, the first production car to wear the quadrifoglio As if to confirm the importance of the quadrifoglio, a few months later on September 8, 1923, a tragic accident occurred in which Sivocci lost his life at the Monza raceway.historicracing.com: historicracing.com, accessdate: 26. August 2018 During practice for the 1st Grand Prix of Europe, Sivocci crashed in his Alfa Romeo P1 No. 17. His P1 did not have the quadrifoglio due to complications that had prevented the painting of the bodywork. The fact that he crashed in a vehicle that lacked the quadrifoglio made a lasting impression among the pilots, mechanics and technicians of the world of competitions. For the same superstitious reasons the number 17 was no longer assigned to Italian racing cars after this crash. Even in the absence of official regulations, from the 1924 season the bodywork of racing Alfa Romeo autos were decorated with the green four-leaf clover. In memory of Sivocci, the white square was replaced by a triangle to signify his absence, and the symbol remains that way to this day. After World War II the quadrifoglio was used to distinguish particularly sporty versions of production Alfa Romeos, appearing for the first time on the side of the Giulia TI Super of 1963, also called Giulia Quadrifoglio. This was a variant of the Giulia sedan devised for competition but regularly put on sale; it had green four-leaf clovers on its front wings, without the triangle.  Nomenclature  Alfetta 159 Quadrifoglio badge in suit of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen.

The Alfasud, Sprint, 33, 75, 164 and 145 all had Quadrifoglio Verde versions. Also in the 1970s and through the 1980s golden four-leaf clover badges were used to denote the most luxurious and well-equipped variants of Alfa Romeo cars, named Quadrifoglio Oro (lit. gold four-leaf). The Alfasud, Alfetta, Alfa 6, 90 and 33 had Quadrifoglio Oro versions. The Q4 name was also used originally introduced in 1992 on the Alfa Romeo 155 Q4 (turbocharged 4 wheel drive, top of line version), and on the badge the Q was stylized as a cloverleaf, so it meant Quadrifoglio 4. Since the introduction of 155 Q4, the Q4 badge is used to mark Alfa Romeo all wheel drive vehicles. The same Q4 marking is also used on some new Maserati all wheel drive variants. In 2016 Volkswagen's Audi made trademark swap with FCA, so that Q4 badge can now be used in Audi cars.Autoblog: Audi gets Q2 and Q4 badges in trademark swap with FCA - Autoblog, accessdate: 30. May 2019 Alfa 33 More recently the quadrifoglio badge was revived on the 2007 Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione and Spider eight- cylinder sports cars. With the Alfa Romeo MiTo in 2012 and Giulietta in the early 2010s, the Quadrifoglio Verde was reinstated as the sportiest trim level in the range, and green four-leaf clovers on the front wings once again became the hallmark of high-performance Alfa Romeos. Current Alfa Romeo models to wear the Quadrifoglio badge are the high performance versions of the Giulia and Stelvio. Although the verde adjective is not used with these models, the QV abbreviation is still often used informally when referring to them, for example Alfa Romeo Giulia QV. As of 2017, the Quadrifoglio badge was seen in Ferrari SF70H formula 1 car and suit of Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen and Sebastian Vettel. As of 2018, the Quadrifoglio was seen also in Alfa Romeo Sauber F1 Team, and from 2019, it was seen also in the Alfa Romeo Racing Formula 1 team.

As the leader of the Black Fraternal Organization of Honduras (OFRANEH), Miranda has coordinated efforts to counter land theft by big tourism businesses, reclaim ancestral territories formerly belonging to Gar√≠funa communities, stop drug traffickers, promote sustainable environmental practices, and support community leadership development for local youth and women. She has been illegally arrested and beaten by local authorities and kidnapped by drug traffickers. Miranda has received the √ìscar Romero Human Rights Award and the US Food Sovereignty Alliance's International Food Sovereignty Prize. In 2016, she was awarded the Carlos Escaleras environmental prize for 30 years of activist work.  Early life  A view of alt= Miriam Miranda was born in Santa Fe, Col√≥n, a coastal Gar√≠funa community in Honduras. When Miranda was a child, she and her family left the village in search of better work and schooling opportunities, travelling to various banana plantations. She later studied at a university in Tegucigalpa. During her time as a student, Miranda became increasingly aware of social movements, particularly movements that supported the rights of low- income and indigenous women in Honduras. She eventually decided to focus on advocating for the rights of Gar√≠funa people: mixed-race descendants of West African slaves who escaped to the Caribbean in the 1600s before settling in Central and South American countries such as Honduras.  Activism  = OFRANEH = Miranda is the leader of the Black Fraternal Organization of Honduras (OFRANEH), which was originally established in 1979. The organization actively supports the legal rights of indigenous and Gar√≠funa communities, while also providing resources to support community leadership development, environmental education, health education, and other services. Members of OFRANEH have occupied areas of land in Honduras that once belonged to Gar√≠funa communities, reclaiming the land as ancestral territory and making use of international human rights laws to avoid eviction. They have also brought legal cases to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights regarding the confiscation of former Gar√≠funa community lands. In 2015, after Canadian businessman Randy Jorgensen illegally built a mega-tourism enterprise on Gar√≠funa land, OFRANEH successfully brought Jorgensen to trial. Miranda has worked to halt other developments disruptive to local communities such as hydroelectric and palm-oil industrial projects.  Radio stations  In Honduras, most commercial radio and television stations are either controlled or censored by the national government. After activists realized their attempts to protect Gar√≠funa ancestral territory were being hindered or obstructed by local mainstream media, OFRANEH established a new Gar√≠funa community radio station. OFRANEH subsequently partnered with several other community radio stations to create the Mesoamerica Network of Community Radio. OFRANEH now operates six radio stations across Honduras. One of the radio stations funded and organized by OFRANEH, named Faluma Bimetu (Gar√≠funa for \\"sweet coconut\\"), is located in the northern Honduras village of Triunfo de la Cruz. The station was established in 1997, and broadcasts a 24-hour cycle of traditional music and shows on topics such as environmental issues, domestic violence, substance abuse, health, spirituality, and leadership development for youth and women. Faluma Bimetu has been targeted for its work ‚Äì in 2010, the radio station was hit by an arson attempt that damaged the building and its broadcasting equipment. Although the police made no arrests, some activists alleged that the arson was the work of the Indura Beach and Golf Resort, a tourism corporation that has been accused of evicting Gar√≠funa families and illegally redrawing land boundaries in order to build new hotels. Other OFRANEH radio stations have focused on highlighting social injustices and the work of local activists. In 2016, Radio Lumamali Giriga broadcast an interview with Honduran activist Madeline David Fernandez, who had been arrested and allegedly tortured by Honduran police. The story was subsequently picked up by other radio stations and organizations.  Threats, illegal arrests and kidnappings  The British NGO Global Witness has called Honduras \\"the deadliest place on earth\\" for activists working against big businesses. Between 2010 and 2017, approximately 120 Honduran activists were killed. Miranda has been threatened and kidnapped in retaliation for her work, and has been publicly portrayed as a criminal in local news media. On March 28, 2012, as non-violent public protests were taking place across Honduras, Miranda was beaten by police and military, then arrested and detained for twelve hours. She was charged with sedition upon her release. In 2014, OFRANEH activists discovered that drug traffickers had clear-cut swaths of forest to build an illegal air strip in northern Honduras. After authorities were notified, the air strip was destroyed by the Honduran Army. A few months later, when Miranda and several colleagues revisited the area and found that the traffickers had returned, they were kidnapped and held for several hours by armed men employed by the traffickers. In January 2017, while in the port city of La Ceiba, Miranda and three other Gar√≠funa community leaders were arrested and illegally detained by police. The arrest happened in spite of the fact that Honduras authorities had been ordered by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to provide police protection for Miranda.  Role of women as activists  Traditionally, Gar√≠funa ancestral lands in Honduras are inherited by women and passed down to their children. Women are often deeply involved in the protection of land and the preservation of cultural traditions. In interviews, Miranda has emphasized her belief in the importance of acknowledging women as defenders of communities and cultural heritage: \\"Everywhere throughout Honduras, like in all of Latin America, Africa, Asia, women are at the forefront of the struggles for our rights, against racial discrimination, for the defense of our commons and our survival. We‚Äôre at the front not only with our bodies but also with our force, our ideas, our proposals. We don‚Äôt only birth children, but ideas and actions as well.\\"  Awards and recognition  In 2015, OFRANEH received the International Food Sovereignty Prize from the US Food Sovereignty Alliance. Miranda was also named co-recipient of the √ìscar Romero Human Rights Award, alongside Honduran environmental activist Berta Caceres. In October 2016, in recognition of her work defending Gar√≠funa rights for 30 years, Miranda was awarded the Carlos Escaleras environmental prize.

The existence of Marsupionta is a postulation by some researchers as a category devolving upon a notional unification between marsupials (Marsupialia, Metatheria) with the egg-laying monotremes (Monotremata, Protheria). Under this suggested classification, placental mammals (Placentalia, Eutheria) would be the sister subclass to Marsupionta. The Marsupionta hypothesis was proposed in 1947 by W.K. Gregory and has since been the subject of multiple studies. This merging of marsupials and monotremes into the hypothesized subclass of Marsupionta is contrary to the widespread belief that pouch and placental mammals share the common subclass Theria that excludes monotremes. Evidence =Morphological evidence= Under this scheme that splits the marsupials from the monotremes, monotremes are placed by themselves in the subclass Yinotheria. Yinotheria are characterised by a number of common derived characteristics (synapomorphies), which include among others, viviparia (the birth of live pups), the presence of teats, and several features in the skull and shoulder girdle structures. Common morphological features of the Marsupionta exist only in the epipubic (pouch) bones. The two epipubic bones that protrude from the pelvis bone, are present in both monotremes and marsupials, but are missing in placentals. However, some primitive mammals, as well as fossil ancestors of the Cretaceous higher mammals also exhibit these bones. It can therefore be assumed that the epipubic bones were an original feature that has been reduced in today's placentals, and thus no morphological feature for the Marsupionta exists. The majority of researchers prefer the Theria classification based on the morphologies of marsupials and monotremes. =Molecular evidence= Genetic findings regarding the correct classification scheme for marsupials and monotremes are contradictory. Comparisons of mitochondrial DNA support the Marsupionta theory, while genome sequencing speaks for the Theria hypothesis. Other studies do not come to a clear conclusion.

After being separated from his father in a storm, Thomas sailed a small schooner with a crew of four from the vicinity of China to Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island where he was arrested by the Spanish. After being released he sailed to Hawaii, hoping to find his father. Instead, he was attacked and killed by Native Hawaiians in revenge for deeds committed by his father just days before. Early family life Little is known about Thomas Metcalfe's life apart from the events of about 1787‚Äì1790. Thomas's father, Simon was born in London, England, in the mid-18th century. In 1763 he married Catherine Humphrey. They immigrated to the Province of New York about 1765. Fur trading voyage In the late 1780s Simon Metcalfe owned a 190-ton brig named Eleanora. In February 1787 he sailed from New York City with his two teenage sons, Thomas and Robert, on a trading voyage to China. The intention was to take a cargo of tea from China to New York City. But while in Guangzhou (Canton) or Macau, China, the Metcalfes heard about the possibility of making large profits trading sea otter furs in China. Simon Metcalfe decided to sail to the Pacific Northwest Coast to acquire sea otter furs before returning to China to buy tea. An English captain recommended taking a second, smaller ship to serve as tender and to more easily navigate narrow fjords. To this end, Simon Metcalfe purchased a 26-ton schooner in Macau. This vessel was given the name Fair American and put under the command of Thomas Metcalfe. The little schooner was long and wide and had a crew of four, plus Thomas. The schooner was undecked but copper-bottomed. When one of George Vancouver's officers saw the Fair American, a few years later, he was \\"Stuck with Surprize, at so small a Vessel having been employ'd on such a Commercial pursuit as she had been, and to have travers'd Such an immense tract of Boisterous Ocean as she had done.\\" Separation and voyage to Nootka Sound The Eleanora, under Simon Metcalfe, and the Fair American, under Thomas Metcalfe, left Macau in May 1789, intending to sail together to Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island, present- day British Columbia, Canada, but they were separated during a storm in the South China Sea. Young Thomas Metcalfe was left to find his own way across the ocean in his tiny vessel. His only navigational instrument was a compass, which broke en route. His only guide was a copy of a map made by James Cook. Cook's map provided a general impression of the North Pacific coast but lacked detail. Thomas sailed north along the Japanese archipelago, the Kuriles, and the Aleutian Islands. After 42 days at sea he stopped at a Russian fur-trade post on Unalaska Island, where the Russian commander Potak Zaikov provided flour and dried fish. Thomas continued down the Pacific Northwest Coast, acquiring some furs through trade with some Tlingit and Haida villages, before arriving at Nootka Sound. In the vicinity of Dixon Entrance he encountered and briefly met with John Kendrick, who was sailing Lady Washington to Haida Gwaii. According to Esteban Jos√© Mart√≠nez, the Spanish commander at Nootka Sound, Thomas Metcalfe's Fair American arrived with \\"her mast sprung and her sails split\\", and that the schooner had no provisions left but only \\"some casks of water and some 65 otter skins\\". In addition, Mart√≠nez noted that Thomas Metcalfe had \\"no written passport or instructions and no papers except his diary\\", and that his sole compass was broken. Mart√≠nez, an experienced sailor who had been to Alaska the year before, was impressed. About Thomas he wrote: \\"He is but a boy, who under his father's orders undertook such an extended voyage. He and his men were exposed to the greatest dangers from rough weather and lack of provisions. They sailed over the open sea for more than three thousand leagues [over ]. They were exposed to a thousand insults from the heathen and driven by necessity had to seek a meeting with the Spaniards, from which they expected relief.\\" Capture at Nootka Sound In 1789 both Simon Metcalfe and his son Thomas Humphrey Metcalfe were caught up in the Nootka Crisis at Nootka Sound. As increasing numbers of trading ships visited Nootka Sound, Spain decided to assert its claim to the Pacific Northwest Coast. In early 1789 a Spanish force arrived and established Santa Cruz de Nuca and Fort San Miguel. The Spanish naval officer Esteban Jos√© Mart√≠nez was in command and had orders to detain all foreign vessels. He seized the British merchant ships Argonaut, under James Colnett, , under Thomas Hudson, and North West America, under Robert Funter. Mart√≠nez did not detain the U.S. ships Columbia Rediviva and Lady Washington, under John Kendrick and Robert Gray. On 20 October 1789, the Fair American under Thomas Metcalfe reached Nootka Sound. Esteban Jos√© Mart√≠nez seized the schooner and arrested the crew. A few days later Simon Metcalfe approached Nootka Sound and the Eleanora was almost captured as well, but he managed to escape. Mart√≠nez took the Fair American and her crew to the Spanish naval base at San Blas, Mexico, arriving on 6 December 1789. Although Mart√≠nez did not seize the American ships Columbia Rediviva or Lady Washington, and despite his admiration for Thomas Metcalfe's seamanship and his pity for the sorry state of the men, he decided to arrest Metcalfe and his crew and take the Fair American to Mexico, where higher authorities could decide what should be done. In order for the Fair American to make the voyage to San Blas, Mart√≠nez provided compasses, cordage, yards, and a new main-mast. During the voyage to San Blas, Thomas and his crew were under arrest and the vessel was captained by John Kendrick, Jr., who had come to Nootka Sound with his father, John Kendrick. While at Nootka, John Junior had converted to Catholicism, changed his name to Juan, announced his intention to obtain Spanish citizenship, and was hired by the Spanish Navy as a piloto. On the way to San Blas a storm forced the Fair American under Juan Kendrick to seek shelter at Monterey, California. Thomas Metcalfe and his crew spent about ten days in prison in Monterey. Then they continued south, arriving at San Blas on 6 December 1789, where Metcalfe and his men were again imprisoned. The Spanish viceroy, Juan Vicente de G√ºemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo, was worried about the possibility of international crisis sparked by the seizure of three British and one U.S. merchant ships. Deciding to focus solely on Britain, he ordered the immediate release of Thomas Metcalfe, his men and ship. Later the viceroy decided it would be better to escort the Fair American back to Nootka Sound before releasing her. But by the time the news reached San Blas, Thomas Metcalfe was already sailing the Fair American to Hawaii. Release and Olowalu Massacre in Hawaii The Metcalfes had planned to spend the winter in the Hawaiian Islands, which were independent and only just beginning to be visited by outsiders. After Simon Metcalfe evaded capture at Nootka Sound he traded for sea otter furs in Haida Gwaii before making for Hawaii. After being released from San Blas, Thomas Metcalfe sailed the Fair American to Hawaii, hoping to join his father. The Eleanora under Simon Metcalfe arrived in the islands first, in the winter of 1789‚Äì90. In Kohala on the island of Hawai ªi, Simon Metcalfe was greeted by local chief Kame ªeiamoku and trading ensued.Hawaiian History , International Institute for Indigenous Resource Management Simon had the chief flogged for some infraction. He then sailed to the neighboring island of Maui to trade along the coast. Kame ªeiamoku vowed revenge on whatever ship next came his way. On the coast of Maui a boat and sailor from the Eleanora went missing. It was discovered that the boat had been stolen. Simon Metcalfe's reaction became known as the Olowalu Massacre. He sailed to the village of the suspected thieves, Olowalu. Feigning peaceful intent, he invited the villagers to the Eleanora for trade while he had his cannon loaded with ball and shot. When many canoes had gathered at the ship Simon ordered a broadside fired at point-blank range, which blasted the canoes to pieces. About 100‚Äì300 Native Hawaiian men, women, and children were killed and a great many more wounded. Death and capture of the Fair American Meanwhile, Thomas Metcalfe and the Fair American arrived at Kawaihae Bay, Island of Hawai ªi, where shortly before his father Simon had flogged Chief Kame ªeiamoku and the chief had vowed revenge upon the next ship. That next ship was the Fair American, captained by Thomas Metcalfe, the son of the very person who had so offended the chief, although nobody was aware of that fact at the time. The schooner was manned by only four sailors plus its relatively inexperienced captain. On 16 March 1790, Kame ªeiamoku's men easily captured the schooner. Thomas Metcalfe and his crew were killed. The only survivor was Isaac Davis, who was badly injured but for some reason spared. Kame ªeiamoku appropriated the ship, its guns, ammunition, and other valuable goods, as well as Isaac Davis himself. At the time no one was aware of the family relation between the captain of the Fair American and Simon Metcalfe, whose Eleanora was anchored at Kealakekua Bay, about away. The Fair American and Davis were eventually given to King Kamehameha I. Aftermath After the Olowalu Massacre, Simon Metcalfe sailed back to the island of Hawai'i, arriving a day after the capture of the Fair American and the death of Thomas Metcalfe. At Kealakekua Bay Simon Metcalfe began what seemed to be friendly trade for provisions. When Kamehameha learned about the capture of the Fair American he prohibited further contact between the natives and the Eleanora. Simon Metcalfe sent his boatswain John Young ashore to investigate. Young was captured, and Metcalfe was puzzled by the sudden silence. He waited two days for Young to return, firing guns in hope that the sound would guide Young back. Finally, sensing danger or becoming frustrated, Metcalfe left and set sail for China, not knowing that his son had been killed not far away. He never learned about the attack on the Fair American or the fate of his son. These events mark a turning point in Hawaiian history. John Young and Isaac Davis were instrumental in Kamehameha's military ventures and his eventual conquest and unification of the Hawaiian Islands. Young and Davis became respected translators and military advisors for Kamehameha. Their skill in gunnery, as well as the cannon from the Fair American, helped Kamehameha win many battles, including the Battle of Kepaniwai, later in 1790, where the forces of Maui were defeated. Young and Davis married members of the royal family, raised families and received valuable lands. Simon Metcalfe continued to trade around the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean for another four years. In 1792 he purchased a small French brig at Port Louis, Isle de France (Mauritius) to serve as a tender to Eleanora. He named this brig Ino and appointed his younger son Robert to command her. When the Eleanora sank in the Indian Ocean in the winter of 1792‚Äì93, Metcalfe took command of the Ino. In August 1794 Simon Metcalfe visited Houston Stewart Channel, at the southern end of Haida Gwaii, and anchored in Coyah's Sound. Friendly trading with the local Haida natives of Chief Koyah began. Metcalfe let a great number come aboard the Ino. The Haida took advantage of their superiority in numbers and attacked.Report for the Year 1957 , Provincial Museum of Natural History and Anthropology, Province of British Columbia Department of Education Simon Metcalfe and his entire crew, except one, were killed.

Her father built a cottage in St. John's, named Dunluce, where Rogerson spent some time and which may have inspired some of her writing.

It was controversial in its day, like the other paintings in the series, for its explicit use of figures, which Jackson Pollock and other abstract expressionists considered a betrayal of the movement's ideal of pure, non- representational painting. Feminists also considered the works misogynistic, suggesting violent impulses toward the women depicted. Several years after it was completed, a wealthy collector from the Eastern United States bought it and later donated it to the new University of Arizona Museum of Art (UAMA) in Tucson, Arizona, where he frequently vacationed, with the stipulation that the museum could not ever sell or give it away, even as the value of other de Kooning paintings from that era rose to over $100 million in the early 21st century; however the stipulation did not prevent the museum from loaning it to traveling exhibits, and it went with several, as far away as Eastern Europe. In 1985 it was stolen from the museum. Investigators believed the thieves were a couple who had visited the museum briefly on the day after Thanksgiving Day that year, as it was found to have been cut from its frame shortly after they left. Sketches were circulated in an effort to identify them, but no leads turned up until it was recovered 32 years later after it was offered for sale at a New Mexico antique store, where it had been part of the estate of Jerry and Rita Alter, two former New York City public school teachers who had retired to the area. Visitors to the store speculated that the work was a de Kooning, and then the proprietor found a picture of the missing painting on the Internet. He contacted museum staff, who were able to provisionally authenticate it, and it was returned to Tucson. The museum has not yet put it back on exhibit; it is raising funds to restore and repair it. It has not been determined who stole the painting. Suspicion has fallen on the Alters, who were photographed at a family Thanksgiving dinner in Tucson the night before the theft, and displayed it in their house in a manner that only they were likely to have seen during their lifetimes. They also did bear a slight resemblance to the couple in the sketches, and Jerome Alter later wrote a book of stories in which two characters carry out a similar theft of a museum piece to reserve for their own exclusive enjoyment. The living relatives of the Alters believe it is possible that they bought the painting from a third party, entirely unaware of its provenance. History De Kooning started Woman-Ochre, an extension of his earlier Woman series, in 1954 while living in the Manhattan neighborhood of Greenwich Village along with other artists and intellectuals of the New York School. He finished it the following year. Like the other paintings in the series, it depicted a female figure, recognizable albeit highly stylized into abstract shapes. They were controversial both among de Kooning's fellow artists and critics. The former, especially Jackson Pollock, felt the artist had been unable to sustain abstract expressionism's goal of pure painting by resorting to what was still recognizably figurative art. From outside the community, critic Emily Genauer attacked the works from a feminist perspective, calling them misogynistic depictions of women being tortured. After de Kooning completed Woman-Ochre in 1955, it was displayed at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York for two years, part of a one-man show of 21 works, mostly oils but with a few sketches, only two of them abstract. Edward Joseph Gallagher Jr., an architect and collector from Baltimore, bought it in 1957. Another pastime of his was vacationing at dude ranches in Arizona. The following year, after reading an article in Life about the University of Arizona's new art museum and its collection of Renaissance art, Gallagher called the university's president and offered to donate some of his modern paintings to the museum. Ultimately, he gave UAMA 200 works including Woman- Ochre, many of which were by de Kooning and other abstract expressionist painters such as Pollock and Mark Rothko. His gift came with the stipulation that the museum could never sell or give the paintings, including Woman-Ochre, to anyone else. During the 1960s, the museum loaned it to several exhibitions elsewhere. It was displayed at the Cantonal Museum of Fine Arts in Lausanne, Switzerland in 1963, and then at several colleges in New England over the next two years. The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) included it in one of its own traveling exhibitions, Two Decades of American Painting, during 1966 and 1967. A 1969 Smithsonian exhibit, The Disappearance and Reappearance of the Image, introduced the painting to museumgoers in several Eastern European countries, Paris and Brussels. Woman-Ochre largely remained in Arizona after that. It was loaned to another MoMA traveling exhibit, Four Contemporary Masters, in 1975. For two weeks at the end of August 1981, it was displayed at the Guild Hall of East Hampton, New York, which had exhibited many of de Kooning's other works and helped popularize him. =Theft= On November 27, 1985, the day after Thanksgiving, an older woman and younger man, wearing heavy winter coats against the late November chill, were waiting outside the museum shortly before its 9 a.m. opening time. When security guards let a staff member in, the couple followed. The guards decided to let them in anyway. The couple went upstairs. Midway up the stairs, the woman began asking the guard on duty about some of the artwork in the museum, while the man continued upstairs. Shortly afterwards, he returned and the two left. This very short visit to the museum seemed unusual to the guard, and he went upstairs to see if anything was amiss. He found that Woman-Ochre had been cut from its frame. It appeared that the man had hidden the painting under his coat before leaving. A witness later recalled seeing the two drive off in a rust-colored two-door sports car. No fingerprints were found at the scene. At the time the museum had no security cameras, so investigators had to rely on eyewitness accounts which described the man as in his late 20s, with dark brown hair, glasses and a mustache, wearing sunglasses and a dark blue water-repellent coat with a hood; the woman was said to be older, with a scarf and granny glasses, reddish-blonde hair, wearing a red water-repellent coat and tan bell-bottoms. Sketches were made and distributed to the public. The university's police department turned the case over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but no leads materialized. The museum's insurance company paid it $400,000, the painting's estimated market value at the time, on the claim. It used the money to buy security cameras; the museum also revised its schedule to stay closed on the day after Thanksgiving in the future. Like many other art museums that have suffered thefts of works on display, it did not replace Woman-Ochre, instead placing a blank ochre-colored canvas on the wall behind the frame, where the cut fibers were still visible, to call attention to the loss. By 2015, when another 1955 de Kooning, Interchange, was sold for $300 million, making it the most expensive painting ever at that time, the museum estimated the value of the still-missing work at $160 million. =Recovery= In June 2017, Rita Alter, a former speech pathologist in the New York City public school system as well as the local school district in Cliff, New Mexico, died. She and her husband, Jerry, who had predeceased her in 2012, a former clarinetist and music teacher in the New York City schools, had retired to the area in 1977 and built a house on of land near Gila National Forest that included a sculpture garden with busts of Beethoven and Moli√®re, where they raised their own chickens and ducks. Her nephew, Ron Roseman, was named executor of her estate. Roseman hired a local realtor, Ruth Seawolf, to sell the Alters' house. As the two were touring the house to prepare for the sale, Seawolf noticed several possible valuable artworks in the house, mainly pottery and African pieces. She called up a friend, David Van Auker, who ran an antique store in nearby Silver City, and Roseman hired him to appraise the art and furniture in the house that the family itself had not wanted. He sought to sell them those items in bulk so the family could then sell the emptied house and dispose of the estate. Van Auker went to the house to inspect the contents in August. During Van Auker's tour, in addition to the art Seawolf had told him about, he found another painting in the Alters' master bedroom, hung on the wall next to the door in such a way that it was visible only when the door was closed, a discovery he made only when he closed the door to get a better look at a broken dresser drawer, part of the room's mid-century furniture set, which he thought could be sold together at a good price. While he did not recognize the painting, it appeared to him to be the work of a mid-20th century artist as well, which he thought was \\"great\\" and \\"cool\\", although he thought very little of its frame. Van Auker bought the contents of the house for $2,000 and returned the next day with some friends to take the artwork and furniture back to his store. They put the painting atop the pile in their truck and drove it back to Silver City, where he put it on display, propping it up against the wall on the floor. He intended to change the frame, which he disliked, and hang it in his guesthouse. Silver City has a large population of artists, and shortly after Van Auker put it on display, a customer recognized it as a work by de Kooning, a remark the proprietors dismissed. But within an hour, two other customers had made the same assessment; one man even returned several times and offered to buy the painting for $200,000. Van Auker, realizing he might have acquired something more valuable than he appreciated, decided to put the painting in a bathroom, the only room in the store that could be locked. He did an Internet search, which eventually led him to a 2015 article about Woman-Ochre in The Arizona Republic. The painting Van Auker had bought from the Alters' house looked exactly like the stolen work, when he compared it to an online image, down to the drips and splatters. He called UAMA and told the receptionist he thought he had a painting that had been stolen from them. She immediately put him through to curator Olivia Miller, who asked him to measure it. It was one inch off from its dimensions, consistent with having been cut from its original frame. After Van Auker also described how the paint had been cracked, as it might have been if it had been rolled up for some time, Miller asked him to take pictures of the painting's rear with his cellphone and send them to her. The marks on them matched the ones on file for de Kooning's work. News that a masterpiece of modern art had somehow ended up in a local antique shop got around Silver City, and by the end of the day 40 people had shown up to ask if they could see it. On the advice of the Albuquerque FBI office, which told him to put it in \\"a very safe place\\", Van Auker took the painting back to his Pinos Altos home and hid it behind his sofa, staying up all night and guarding it with his guns. The next day, needing to keep it somewhere while he ran the shop, Van Auker and his partners drove it around town, looking for someone whom they could temporarily place it with. A lawyer they were acquainted with doubted the story until he saw the painting, and agreed to take it for the day. FBI agents from the Phoenix office, who had been investigating the theft since university police turned the case over to them, made the trip east along with Miller and a UAMA team later in that day. At the lawyer's house, where he was having a small party for family and friends, the Grant County sheriff greeted Van Auker, Miller and the FBI agents. When she saw Woman-Ochre in the lawyer's home office upstairs, Miller fell to her knees and gasped, a moment Van Auker recalled as \\"electric\\". \\"Holy shitballs!\\" she said, as during her entire tenure at the museum she had come to know the painting well, yet never actually seen it in person. They had brought the frame that originally housed the painting, and its remaining threads matched those still on the painting. The law enforcement officers present promptly moved the painting to a vault for the coming weekend. Afterwards a UAMA van arrived to take the painting back to Tucson. New Mexico State Police escorted it to the state line, where their Arizona counterparts took over as it made the journey down Interstate 10 to the museum. After its return, Woman-Ochre was allowed to rest for a few days. Following that period, Nancy Odegaard, a conservator at the nearby Arizona State Museum, began the final process of authentication. She and her graduate student found a sticker from the 1969 traveling Smithsonian exhibit on the painting's rear. An ultraviolet light detected an acrylic varnish. There was also evidence of repairs the museum had made, and recorded, before 1985. Finally, Odegaard and her student put the painting over the original frame it had been cut from and compared the canvas. The damage to the painting and the damage to the threads that had remained matched perfectly, including the colors of stray paint. A large stray black stroke in the upper left corner that matched that on the remnants provided the final confirmation, and Odegaard formally authenticated the painting. On August 11 the museum held a news conference announcing that Woman-Ochre had been recovered after 31 years. University police chief Brian Seastone, who had investigated the case in 1987, was elated. \\"Somebody saw something, they said something, and today she's home.\\" Van Auker, who was also present, described how he had come to find the painting and his role in the process of its recovery. He declined a reward, and brushed aside suggestions that he was somehow heroic. \\"We returned something that was stolen, and that's something everyone should do.\\" Repair and restoration Woman-Ochre has not yet been returned to its former public location in UAMA's halls. Conservators have been working to repair the damage done by not only the theft but its later storage and exhibition in the Alters' bedroom. In August of that year Miller told the Arizona Daily Star that she could not say when it could be restored to exhibit as it cannot be taken from the museum to the conservator's shop until the FBI closes the case. The instrument used during the theft to remove the painting from its frame was sharp enough to cut cleanly through the canvas, but for that same reason it would take a long time to match the threads exactly and reattach them, Miller explained. One of the corners had torn, she added. She and Odegaard both commented on the many small sections of paint that had flaked off the horizontal creases formed across the painting when it was rolled up. At some point after the theft, the painting had been reframed into the one that Van Auker had found so unappealing when he first saw it. Whoever had done that work had done it crudely, using flat screws to attach the canvas to the wood, causing further damage. The lack of temperature and humidity controls at the Alter house also left the paint brittle; Miller said it was fortunate that more paint had not been lost. Nevertheless, the Alters appeared to have taken some measures to protect it while it hung in their bedroom. A reporter from Dallas-based television station WFAA was able to tour the house for a short documentary about the case, and noted that a heavy screw had been partially driven into the baseboard at the floor level below the wall where the painting hung, effectively serving as a doorstop that prevented the door from opening fully and inadvertently damaging the painting. Likewise, the window on the side of the room that faced the setting sun was equipped with a heavy blackout curtain that would have blocked sunlight from the direction when drawn.Discovering the de Kooning, 2:30-3 mins. Shortly after its return the museum took the painting to a conservator's studio for the repair and restoration process. It originally expected to take a year, but near the end of that period, Miller said she was no longer so certain. UAMA has started a fundraising drive to raise the $1 million it believes the restoration will cost. In March 2019, the museum announced it had chosen experts at the Getty Conservation Institute, associated with the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, to repair Woman-Ochre. Before it went there, the museum put the painting on public display on St. Patrick's Day, an event for which a special fee was charged. Among the 250 people who attended was actor Hal Linden, who was performing in a nearby production of A.R. Gurney's play Love Letters. \\"I'm really taken by the drama of the story\\", he told the Republic. \\"I would love to know the story of the people who lived with it in their home.\\" Experts at the Getty, who were present, said they expected it would take 14 or 15 months to fully repair Woman-Ochre. During the restoration, conservators will have to decide to what degree they will leave damage related to the theft intact, since the theft is now part of the painting's history. The institute is doing the work for free in exchange for the museum being allowed to exhibit the work in 2020 after it is restored. If the work goes as scheduled, UAMA expects to have Woman-Ochre back on its walls where it was stolen from after Thanksgiving 2020, around the 35th anniversary of its theft. Investigation Although the painting has been recovered, the investigation into the theft is continuing, as the FBI cannot say for certain that the Alters had anything to do with the theft or that they knew Woman-Ochre was stolen when they took possession of it. A considerable amount of circumstantial evidence, some of which has emerged since the recovery, connects the Alters to the crime, however. They were apparently fans of de Kooning's work, as several replica sketches of drawings by the artist were also found in their home.Discovering the de Kooning, 2‚Äì2:30 mins. While going through his aunt and uncle's estate, Roseman, who still strongly doubts that they were the thieves, found a picture taken showing the couple at a family Thanksgiving dinner in 1985, the day before the painting was stolen. When the photo is compared side by side with the sketches distributed after the crime, they did show an apparent resemblance. Three people The New York Times spoke with confirmed that in the mid-1980s, the Alters primarily traveled in a red two-door Nissan sports car, and the FBI found home movies they took showing them traveling in that car then. The Alters kept, at that time of their lives, a day planner which they used as a diary, documenting the medications they took, where they went, and what they ate on a regular basis. But the entry for Thanksgiving 1985 is uncharacteristically blank. In one piece of luggage in the house, Seawolf found a small compartment containing a scarf and glasses she believed were similar to those the female thief wore to the museum. The FBI, however, did not appear interested when she contacted them about the items, she said. Seawolf has speculated that the woman may actually have been a man in disguise, perhaps Jerry Alter, since descriptions of the man involved suggest he appeared to be in his late 20s or early 30s, half the age Jerry would have been at the time. The man could have been one of the Alters' children, Joseph, who also appears in the 1985 Tucson Thanksgiving dinner photos; at the time he was 23. Roseman said Joseph, who also has lived in Silver City, has had psychiatric issues that have required lengthy hospital stays throughout his life, including at the time Roseman talked to the Times about the case. Roseman did, however, tell the Republic that at some point after the painting's recovery he had taken a picture of Woman-Ochre to show Joseph while visiting him, which made him laugh hysterically. \\"That's one of the ugliest paintings I've ever seen!\\" he said. Journalists also discovered another apparent link between the Alters and the theft of the painting in the three books the couple published. In one, about their extensive travels, two chapters discussed museums where thefts had occurred. And in 2011, a year before he died, Jerry had self-published through Amazon a collection of short stories called The Cup and the Lip: Exotic Tales, which he called \\"an amalgamation of fantasy and reality\\" in his introduction. One, \\"The Eye of the Jaguar\\", particularly struck readers after the missing Woman-Ochre was found in the Alters' house. In it, a grandmother and granddaughter visit an art museum near their homes and are taken by a 120-carat emerald on display. They ask the guard, Lou, for the history of the stone. Six months later, Lou sees them return and then leave again quickly. After he sees that the emerald has been taken, he runs out to stop them as the women flee in the grandmother's car, but is killed when she runs him over, leaving \\"absolutely no clues which police could use\\". At the end, the emerald is kept in a hidden display case in the grandmother's house \\"where two pairs of eyes, exclusively, are there to see!\\" The fictional theft has a similar modus operandi to the theft of Woman- Ochre, and its display where only two people can see it also recalls how the Alters kept the painting in their bedroom such that they were the only people likely to know it was there. One other person who did, an artist neighbor who went into the bedroom with the Alters' permission to photograph a painting she had made of them on horseback in the Himalayas, then hung there, recalled seeing the de Kooning and asking the couple about it; they did not answer her questions and did not want to talk about it. Other relatives of the Alters who have talked to the media dismiss the possibility the couple could have stolen the painting. \\"[They wouldn't] risk something as wild and crazy as grand larceny‚Äîrisk the possibility of winding up in prison, for God's sake‚Äîthey wouldn't do that\\", Rita's younger sister told the Times. \\"My driving instinct is to say: 'This couldn't be my aunt and uncle who had it since the beginning'\\" Roseman said, although he allowed that it was possible since he knew little more about their lives than their neighbors did. He said of the people he had shown the sketches to, about half thought it might be them, although he himself did not, but he admitted he probably could not be objective. Roseman, who also saw the painting behind his aunt and uncle's door when he began arranging support services for Rita due to her worsening dementia early in 2017, but did not recognize it, has offered an alternative theory as to how the couple came into possession of Woman-Ochre. They liked to visit galleries and museums, he recalled, and believed that someone might have seen them appreciating a de Kooning at one and offered them a better painting, the stolen one, from their personal collection. The Alters might even have believed it was a copy. However, other evidence suggests the painting had been in the Alter house since its theft. Van Auker recalled that not only were there dusty cobwebs between the frame and the wall, the space behind the painting was lighter and free from dust, with a visible outline where the painting had hung, suggesting it had been there for a long time. UAMA staff also found evidence of only one reframing. Roseman said that when he was a student at Arizona himself during the late 1970s and early 1980s, he visited them at least once a month, visits he recalled fondly as they would share stories and pictures from their travels. But since his graduation and eventual relocation to Houston, he was not able to make the trip as frequently. He concluded that he was not as close to them as he thought.

He was the Cornhusker's leading rusher in their 1970 National Championship season with 834 yards. He was the most valuable player of the 1971 Coaches All-America Game. Over his career at Nebraska he rushed for 1958 yards. He was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the 2nd round (49th pick overall) of the 1971 NFL draft but spent the 1971 season on the 49ers taxi squad due to a leg injury suffered in the final preseason game and did not play a game for them. The Giants acquired Orduna on waivers from the 49ers just before the beginning of the 1972 season. He was active for the Giants first game of the 1972 season but was deactivated for the next 3 games before he was reactivated due to injuries to other running backs. Orduna ended up playing 11 games for the Giants in 1972, starting 4. He rushed for 129 yards on 36 carries with 1 touchdown. In 1973 Orduna played in all 14 games for the Giants, starting 3 and rushing for 104 yards on 36 attempts with 1 touchdown.

Although he played in all 14 games for the Colts in 1974, he rushed only twice for 3 yards and 1 touchdown, all coming in an October 20 game against the New York Jets.

Shark culling is the deliberate killing of sharks by government authorities, usually in response to one or more shark attacks. The term \\"shark control\\" is often used by governments when referring to culls. Shark culling has been criticized by environmentalists, conservationists and animal welfare advocates ‚Äî they say killing sharks harms the marine ecosystem and is unethical. Government officials often cite public safety (attempting to reduce the risk of shark attacks) as a reason for culling. The impact of culling is also minor compared to bycatch with 50 million sharks caught each year by the commercial fishing industry. Shark culling mainly occurs in four locations: New South Wales, Queensland, KwaZulu-Natal and R√©union. Carl Meyer, a researcher at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology, calls the disagreements about shark culling a \\"philosophical\\" debate, about \\"whether it is ethical to kill large predators in order to make the natural environment a safer playground for humans.\\" Methods =Shark nets= Shark nets such as those used in New South Wales are designed to entangle and kill sharks and other animals that pass near them. Christopher Neff, a Ph.D. scholar at the University of Sydney notes, \\"Internationally, shark nets have been labeled a 'key threatening process' for killing endangered species.\\" He adds:\\" ... killing endangered species to boost public confidence or to show government action is not workable. It is a disservice to the public.\\" =Drum lines= A drum line is an unmanned aquatic trap used to lure and capture large sharks using baited hooks ‚Äî some (such as those in Queensland) are designed to kill sharks. Drum lines have been criticized for being environmentally destructive and speciesist, and have sparked public demonstrations and vocal opposition, particularly from environmentalists, animal welfare advocates and ocean activists. Conservationists say killing sharks on drum lines harms the marine ecosystem. In addition, Western Australia Fisheries Minister Dave Kelly said \\"there is currently no scientific evidence to show that drumlines reduce the risk of a [shark] attack\\". Shark experts and conservationists also say there is no evidence that drum lines prevent shark attacks. Current shark culling locations =New South Wales (Australia)= The government of New South Wales has a program that deliberately kills sharks using shark nets. They were first installed in 1935. The current net program in New South Wales has been described as being \\"extremely destructive\\" to marine life, including sharks. Between September 2017 and April 2018, more than 403 animals were killed in the nets in New South Wales, including 10 critically endangered grey nurse sharks, seven dolphins, seven green sea turtles and 14 great white sharks. Between 1950 and 2008, 352 tiger sharks and 577 great white sharks were killed in the nets in New South Wales. Also during this period, a total of 15,135 marine animals were killed in the nets, including whales, turtles, rays, dolphins, and dugongs. More than 5,000 marine turtles have been caught on the nets. Sixty-five percent of shark attacks in New South Wales occurred at netted beaches. The current net program in New South Wales has been called \\"outdated and ineffective\\", and has been criticized by environmentalists, who say nets harm the marine ecosystem. They say there is no science showing that nets make the ocean safer for people. Humane Society International calls the nets a \\"knee-jerk reaction\\". The New South Wales government prohibits people from rescuing entangled animals‚Äîthis prohibition has been called \\"heartless and cruel\\". Following 11 shark attacks along the New South Wales north coast between 2014 and 2016, including two fatalities, shark nets and \\"smart\\" drum lines were deployed in December 2016 to cover five additional beaches along the New South Wales North Coast in a six-month trial. Five nets were deployed off Seven Mile Beach off Lennox Head; Sharpes, Shelly and Lighthouse beaches off Ballina; and Main Beach at Evans Head. No shark attacks occurred at the netted beaches during the trial, and the trial was continued for the 2017-18 summer. In August 2018, it was announced that the nets in northern New South Wales would be removed, but that the nets in Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong would stay. The New South Wales Green party said they wanted all lethal nets to be removed. =Queensland (Australia)= From 1962 to the present, the government of Queensland has targeted and killed sharks in large numbers by using drum lines and shark nets, under a \\"shark control\\" program‚Äîthis program has also killed large numbers of other animals such as dolphins; it has also killed endangered hammerhead sharks. Queensland currently operates the largest shark culling program in Australia. In the first 11 months of 2013, 633 sharks were captured in Queensland ‚Äî more than 95% of those sharks were killed. From 2013 to 2014, 667 sharks were killed on Queensland's drum lines and in shark nets, including great white sharks and critically endangered grey nurse sharks. From 2014 to 2015, 621 sharks were killed in Queensland. From 2017 to 2018, 218 sharks were killed, including 75 tiger sharks and 41 bull sharks; at least 64 sharks were shot and killed during this period. From 2001 to 2018, a total of 10,480 sharks were killed on lethal drum lines in Queensland. From 1962 to 2018, roughly 50,000 sharks were killed by Queensland authorities. The following was said about Queensland's use of lethal drum lines: > \\"Lethal drum lines in Queensland are used to catch and kill sharks. They are > set with baited hooks to ensnare these sharks, leaving them to die in agony. > Those who don‚Äôt die immediately on these lines are shot by a contractor who > is employed by the Queensland Government.\\"One Green Planet.

About 360 baited drum lines have been placed off the coast of Queensland, including 78 along the Sunshine Coast, 54 near Townsville, 27 near Mackay and 38 near Cairns. Since the policy was implemented there has only been one recorded death, at Amity Point in January 2006. 21-year-old Sarah Kate Whiley was attacked by as many as three sharks in Rainbow Channel. The attack occurred in an unpatrolled area. Queensland Fisheries Minister John McVeigh has described the longevity of the netting and drum line program as being \\"a good indicator that it had the support of most Queenslanders\\". However, a 2014 poll indicated that 80% of Australians did not approve of shark culling in Australia. The shark-killing program in Queensland has been criticized by environmentalists, conservationists, and animal welfare advocates‚Äîthey say Queensland's shark-killing program is unethical and harms the marine ecosystem. Queensland's shark-killing program has been called \\"outdated, cruel and ineffective\\". The Australian Marine Conservation Society said, \\"the ecological cost of drum lines is high, with 97% of sharks caught since 2001 considered to be at some level of conservation risk.\\" In September 2018, the government of Queensland began culling sharks with drum lines in Cid Harbour in the Whitsunday Islands in response to two non-fatal shark attacks‚Äîsix sharks (including five tiger sharks) were shot and killed, and their bodies were dumped at sea. The killings have been called a cull. Environmental groups criticized the cull; Shark Conservation Australia called the killings a \\"disgusting knee-jerk reaction\\" and said it was \\"a very shameful day here in Australia\\". The cull was also called a \\"farce\\". Jonathan Clark of the Sea Shepherd group said culling sharks would not make swimmers safer. National Geographic cameraman Andy Casagrande said the following about the cull: \\"When will basic intelligence and respect for the planet be a requirement for highly paid supposedly educated government officials?\\" Most Whitsunday locals resisted the cull. The government of Queensland currently kills sharks in the Great Barrier Reef using 173 lethal drum lines; in 2018, Humane Society International filed a lawsuit (court challenge) requesting that the drum lines be removed there. It has been argued that killing sharks in the Great Barrier Reef is \\"vastly inconsistent with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority‚Äòs main objective, 'to provide for the long-term protection and conservation of the environment.'\\" In October 2018, the Queensland state government proposed a policy which would ban the photography of shark culling in Queensland; Lawrence Chlebeck of Humane Society International said the following about this proposal: \\"The Queensland Government's plan to put exclusion zones around shark control equipment is simply a measure to keep the slaughter of sharks and marine wildlife hidden from public view. This is not about public safety, rather it's a blatant tactic to reduce public scrutiny by a government under increased public pressure to end its archaic culling program.\\"https://maritime-executive.com/article/australian-government-plans- would-block-shark-cull-photography maritime-executive.com. Australian Government Plans Would Block Shark Cull Photography. October 8, 2018.

The region's shark attack statistics primarily reflect the effectiveness of netting, as drum lines were only introduced recently, following their successful use for over 40 years in Queensland, Australia. The KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board (KZNSB) says, \\"Both types of equipment function by reducing shark numbers in the vicinity of protected beaches, thereby lowering the probability of encounters between sharks and people at those beaches.\\" The KZNSB also states that there were seven fatal attacks at Durban from 1943 until the installation of shark nets in 1952, and that no fatalities or incidents resulting in serious injury have occurred since nets were installed. According to the KZNSB, \\"from 1940 until most of those beaches were first netted in the 1960s, there were 16 fatal attacks and 11 resulting in serious injury. In the three decades since nets were installed, there have been no fatal attacks at those beaches and only four resulting in serious injury.\\" In a 30-year period, more than 33,000 sharks have been killed in KwaZulu-Natal's shark-killing program. During the same 30-year period, 2,211 turtles, 8,448 rays, and 2,310 dolphins were killed. Although shark species such as the great white shark are protected in South Africa, the KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board is allowed to kill these sharks (an exception was made for them). Shark nets are currently installed in Marine Protected Areas, and kill animals there. The current shark cull in KwaZulu-Natal has been criticized by environmentalists, and has been called \\"archaic\\" and \\"disastrous to the ecosystem\\". Shark Angels states, \\"It is hard to believe with all we know about sharks, including their dwindling numbers, their critical role in our oceans, and the small risk they actually pose to us, that the archaic process of killing these animals for bather ‚Äúprotection‚Äù still exists. But in KwaZulu-Natal, hundreds of harmless sharks - as well as turtles, dolphins and rays - still meet an untimely death every year as a result of the 28 kilometers of shark nets installed by KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board (KZNSB).\\" =R√©union (France)= The prevalence of shark attacks at R√©union Island‚Äîthere were 19 attacks between 2011 and 2016, including seven which were fatal‚Äîprompted R√©union island's government to carry out a range of systematic long term activities utilising \\"smart\\" drumlines and longlines. In 2013, 24 sharks were killed in R√©union. In the five years to August 2016, more than 170 sharks were killed as part of the cull. George H. Burgess called the killings \\"an archaic, knee-jerk reaction that seems more borne of vengeance than of science.\\" R√©union authorities currently kill about 100 sharks per year.

The program did not change the rate of shark attacks in the waters of Hawaii. Some Native Hawaiians are against shark culling because of the significance of sharks in Hawaiian culture (sharks are viewed as aumakua, or personal-family gods). =Western Australia= Anti-cull protesters on Perth's Cottesloe Beach in Western Australia in 2014 In 2014, a shark cull in Western Australia killed dozens of sharks (mostly tiger sharks) using drum lines, until it was canceled after public protests and a decision by the Western Australia EPA; from 2014 to 2017, there was an \\"imminent threat\\" policy in Western Australia in which sharks that \\"threatened\\" humans in the ocean were shot and killed. This \\"imminent threat\\" policy was criticized by Senator Rachel Siewert for killing endangered sharks. The \\"imminent threat\\" policy was canceled in March 2017. In August 2018, the Western Australia government announced a plan to re-introduce drum lines (though, this time the drum lines are \\"SMART\\" drumlines).

Culling compared to bycatch from commercial fishing The impact of shark culling is minor compared to bycatch from Commercial fishing. On average 15 Great white sharks are caught by the NSW and Queensland shark control programme each year, compared to 186 caught in Australia from other activities. Australia's commercial shark fishing industry is catching over 1200 tonne of shark each year, of which 130 are Great white sharks. The NSW prawn trawling industry alone results in 64 tonne of shark as bycatch each year, with two thirds dying. Tuna and swordfish longline fishing off the coast of South Africa reported 39,000 to 43,000 sharks killed each year between 1995 and 2005. Sharksavers estimates that in total 50 million sharks are caught unintentionally each year as bycatch by the commercial fishing industry.

Due to its rarity, not much is known about this trainset. They were built Electroputere (electric equipment) and √éntreprinderea de Vagoane Arad (railway cars) with the help of the Technological Institute of Research and Designing of Transports in Bucharest. In the mid-70s, the Romanian Railways was looking for an EMU train design that would replace conventional engine-towed local train consists, and also to work for a possible project that would envisage a regional railway network around Bucharest. The project took shape around 1972-1973, being built in 1974. The prototype was derived from the regional passenger cars named \\"Bonzana\\" among the travellers, that were made by the IVA factory. The whole trainset was fitted with Minden-Deutz bogies, especially the motor bogies, and the electric equipment was made together by ≈†koda and Electroputere and it used thyristors. It featured a destination board, open-able from the cab, where a cardboard plaque would be placed showing the route of the train, toilets and curtains. During 10 years of testing the train was heavily modified, mostly of electrical nature. The prototype was rarely used on Bucharest to Bra»ôov duties, but also on Bucharest to Craiova or to CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi trains too. It was withdrawn in the late 1990s. In the old CFR classification it was given the numbers 080-TEA-001/002. Series production started in 1984 but only eight of such multiple units were made. These were mostly used by the Cluj regional division for services between Cluj and Teiu»ô or Dej, but also by the Craiova regional division for trains between Craiova and Motru or T√¢rgu Jiu and by the Bucharest regional division for trains to CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi. In the new classification they were referred to as the following: *55 00xx, motor driving car, second class, without pantograph *56 00xx, motor cabless car, second class, with pantograph *57 00xx, trailer car, first class, without pantograph *57 00xx, trailer car, second class, without pantograph *56 00xx, motor cabless car, second class, with pantograph *55 00xx, motor driving car, second class, without pantograph Whilst officially they were known as the RES 1870 kW by the Electroputere, where RES stood for \\"Suburban Electric Multiple Unit\\" (RamƒÉ ElectricƒÉ SuburbanƒÉ). Another prototype was realized in 1991, which had stronger traction motors of 2870 kW overall. But all these units were plagued with brake and electrical equipment issues, so after the 1990s they were quickly retired, in favour of CFR Class EA-pulled local trains. Nowadays the only remaining example is the 1991 prototype, although a few cars of the series production trainsets were known to have survived years ago.

In 1851, his family moved to Annapolis, Maryland, and he enrolled at the preparatory school at St. John's College. He remained at the school for his post-secondary education, where his strong academic performance resulted in his being elected valedictorian of his class.  Academic career  After his graduation in 1859, Hopkins was employed by St. John's as an instructor until the college's temporary closure during the Civil War. In the interim, he taught at Anne Arundel County Academy, later becoming its principal. In 1866, Hopkins returned to St. John's, eventually rising to the position of vice president.

He held this position for two years and left in 1886 after accepting an offer to serve as the first president of the newly formed Women's College of Baltimore, now Goucher College. As Goucher's first president, Hopkins played an influential role in its early formation. Prior to the college opening its doors in 1888, he conducted regular fundraising and worked to assemble the college's starting eight-member faculty, including co- founder John B. Van Meter.

Early life, family, and education  Guth was born on October 15, 1871, in Nashville, Tennessee, to Rev. George Guth and Susan Sophie Grandlienard of Perrefitte, Switzerland. Guth was of German, French, and Swiss descent. When he was a teenager, his family moved to San Francisco, California. He enrolled at the University of the Pacific and continued his studies at the then-newly established Stanford University, from which he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1892. Following his college graduation, he studied at University of California, Hastings College of the Law and was admitted to the California bar in December 1895. He practiced law in California for several years and then continued his studies at Boston University, earning a Bachelor of Sacred Theology and becoming ordained as a Methodist minister. He briefly served as a pastor before entering academia. Guth married Helen Louise Fischbeck of San Francisco in March 1896. In 1904, he received a doctorate from Halle University in Halle, Germany. Guth's dissertation was titled Die √§ltere Schicht in den Erz√§hlung √ºber Saul und David.  Career in academia  = University of the Pacific = In 1908, Guth was appointed to serve as president of the University of the Pacific, which he advocated renaming to College of the Pacific. He stayed in this position for five years and published four written works. = Goucher College = In 1913, Guth was selected to serve as president of Goucher College and subsequently took residence at the college's campus in Baltimore. During his tenure, Guth orchestrated the construction of several new residence halls, including the Alumnae Lodge, and a successful million-dollar fundraising campaign, which enabled the college to reduce its debts, augment its endowment, and purchase the plot of land that would eventually become its Towson campus. As Goucher's president, Guth voiced strong public support for women's education in the United States, telling the New York Times in December 1920, shortly after the ratification of the 19th amendment granting women's suffrage, \\"In the co- educational institution, everything is done from the viewpoint of men, and women receive the sort of education that men, who are more enthusiastic about the education of the male sex than they are about higher opportunities for women, can give her.\\" In the course of his administration, Guth at one point corresponded with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, whose daughter Jessie had graduated from Goucher. Wilson wrote Guth in 1918 to express concern over the dismissal of faculty member Hans Froelicher, saying, \\"I have known so much of Doctor Froelicher through my daughters, and have formed so favorable an impression of him by direct contact with him, that I am sure that if any such impression on the part of the Trustees exists, it must be based upon some cruel misunderstanding. I beg that you will believe I am prompted to write this letter only by genuine regard for a man whom I very much esteem and without the least desire to thrust my counsel, uninvited, into the deliberations of the authorities of the college.\\" By 1920, Guth had grown increasingly concerned about the continued viability of the college's Baltimore campus and had begun, with the consent of Goucher's board of trustees, searching for a suitable location in the nearby suburbs. He settled on a 421-acre plot of land in Towson, Marylandk that had belonged to the estate of a wealthy Baltimore family. In 1921, under Guth's direction, the college purchased the land for approximately $150,000. The move was not completed until 1953, having been delayed by financial difficulties at the college during World War II and the Great Depression.  Later years  = Declining health and death = In the final years of his presidency at Goucher, Guth suffered significant health problems, though he remained in the position until his death in 1929 at the age of 57. Faculty member Hans Froelicher, whom Guth had previously dismissed, was appointed in his place as acting president as the college searched for a successor. = Interment = Guth was initially buried at Druid Ridge Cemetery in Pikesville, Maryland. When his wife Helen died in 1959, Goucher fulfilled her request that her and her late-husband's remains be cremated and interred at the Guth Memorial Gate at the entrance to Goucher's campus in Towson, which was completed in 1953, 24 years after his death. The gate itself was built years earlier with a donation from Guth's wife.

Primarily a Slovene children's writer, much of her poetry conveys a child's impression of major events, and her stories explore the difficulties of immigrant life and women's status. Her works of prose examine characters' psychology and social issues of the time, placing women, often with emotional distress, in the roles of protagonists. Zupanƒçiƒç was an educator in Slovenian schools. She married in 1920 and followed her husband to the United States three years later. In Chicago, she worked with Yugoslav and Slovene cultural organizations. She died at age 77 in Los Gatos, California, where she had moved four years before. Biography On September 17, 1889, Zupanƒçiƒç was born in Griƒç pri Dobliƒçah to Katarina (n√©e Kump) and farmer Janez Vrtaƒçiƒç. She had a brother named Mateta. She went to elementary school in Mavrlen, a nun school in ≈†mihel pri Novem Mestu and from 1907 to 1911 a teacher's college in Gorizia. She began teaching at a school in ≈†mihel pri Novem Mestu at the end of 1911 but became ill and returned home from November 1911 to February 1913. She then taught at various schools in Slovenia from 1913 to 1923, the last of which was the German Schulwereen School in Mavrlen where she was the first Slovenian teacher. While there she met Jakob Zupanƒçiƒç, and they married in 1920. She followed her husband to the United States in 1923, settling in Chicago, where Jakob had immigrated the year before. She soon began working with cultural and worker's groups, and her first written works were published in 1929. She contributed articles and poems to the children's magazine Mladinski list (Voice of Youth), for which she was the editor from 1918 to 1926, and worked with the Slovene National Benefit Society (SNPJ), teaching at the Pioneer 559 lodge and directing plays, some of which she wrote, with the Yugoslav Socialist Association in Chicago. Her works were also published in Majski glas (The May Herald), Ameri≈°ki dru≈æinski koledar (American Family Almanach), Prosveta (Enlightenment), Proletarec (Proletarian) and Cankarjev glasnik (Cankar's Herald). In 1963, she moved to Los Gatos, California, where she lived until her death on September 8, 1967, a week before her 78th birthday. She was interred in Los Gatos Memorial Park. Her husband Jakob died in 1980 at age 84. Literary work =Poetry= Zupanƒçiƒç was best known for her children's poetry which she also illustrated. Writing in Slovene, she used simple language and evoked the austerity of immigrant life tempered by humor and from a child's point of view. Her poetry uses a refined approach depicting the state of common people, much like other American Slovene poets, though framed not through realistic depiction of events but using an affecting, subjective perspective. She used the traditional ballad form with irregular rhythm, rhyme and line length. Her work dealt with dark aspects of American life and tactfully showed her disappointment with the American Dream. Zupanƒçiƒç's poems are about the emotional toll of modern events‚Äîthe Great Depression and men's shame over losing their jobs; the tragedies of the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War begetting homelessness, starvation and fratricide; and the plights of women and children without love. =Prose= Most of Zupanƒçiƒç's stories, like her poetry, are written for children, though some deal with social topics that are more mature. Unlike some works of prose written by immigrants, her writing lifts women's role to that of the protagonist and fleshes out characters' psychological motivation. Many protagonists in her stories have in some way been abused or humiliated, thereby having emotional damage. The author's word choice is specific and pathetic, often with dark humor. Her stories are lengthy and characterized by fast pace, familiar idioms, biblical allusions and bitterness, particularly in connection to women's lowly status. Most of her stories are set in Slovenia, especially those that deal with cruelty to women, violence which Zupanƒçiƒç suggested was almost expected in lower-class families. Some Zupanƒçiƒç short stories, like much immigrant literature of the time, criticize conditions in the United States‚Äîshe comments on bankers causing the Depression, economic collapse destroying families and a perceived hypocrisy among the clergy. Other stories show the lasting consequences of apparently trivial actions. Her story \\"Dota\\" (\\"The Dowry\\", 1932) critiques fathers who act as autocrats holding their daughters' feelings in disregard: a young woman is forced to marry a greedy man who swindles his way into getting a large dowry in compensation for her ugliness. When they return from the wedding, the bride's shepherd is startled and frightens the horses pulling the couple's sleigh. They tear off the road and the bride, though smiling, is found dead in the snow. This theme is shared by her story \\"≈Ωensko dete\\" (\\"The Baby Girl\\", 1946), where the title character confesses the rejection she and her sister feel from their father because of their gender.

History Prior to the construction of its new ironworks, Nippon Steel considered the planned reclaimed land off the coast of Yokkaichi, Mie in Central Japan. Their market research, however, showed the steel demand coming largely from Eastern Japan, especially from the Tokyo-Kawasaki-Yokohama region on the western side of Tokyo Bay, and, therefore, Kimitsu, Chiba on the other side of the bay was selected as the new site. Kimitsu Steel Works started in 1965 with a cold rolling mill, using the slabs shipped from other ironworks, such as Kamaishi Steel Works in Kamaishi, Iwate and Tokai Steel Works near Nagoya. In 1968, 1969, 1971 and 1988, the first, second, third and fourth blast furnaces, respectively, were constructed, although the first blast furnace has stopped operation since 1976. Also constructed later were a hot rolling mill and iron bar/iron pipes mills. It became an \\"integrated\\" steel works, producing every kind of steel products. In 1970, with the merger of Nippon Steel and Fuji Iron & Steel (both companies having been separated from the old semi-government- owned Nippon Steel - Êó•Êú¨Ë£ΩÈêµ - since 1950 under the Allied Occupying Army's Anti- Zaibatsu policy immediately after World War II), it became Kimitsu Works of the new Corporation. From the latter half of the 1970s, Kimitsu started to receive visits by the third world's engineers, thus giving technical assistance, as well as by the world's dignitaries, partly because it was located relatively near the capital city of Tokyo. In 1976, it was visited by Premier Jacques Chirac of France. In 1978, it received a visit by Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping of China, followed by Yu Qiuli's visit in 1979. In 1984, Kimitsu Works began receiving Chinese interns (a total of 500 people that year in different groups) from the planned Baoshan Steel Works in Shanghai. In 1985, with Kimitsu engineers' further assistance, Baoshan started operations with the first blast furnace began production.Ë£ΩÈâÑÊâÄÔºèÂêõÊ¥•Ë£ΩÈâÑÊâÄÔºèË£ΩÈâÑÊâÄÊ°àÂÜÖÔºèÊ≠¥Âè≤„ÉªÊ≤øÈù© [Steel Works/Kimitsu Steel Works/Guide/History] (in Japanese) In 1995, it had the honor of a visit by Emperor Akihito and Princess Michiko, his wife.

He taught at Michigan State University and later served as president of Illinois State University.  Early Life and Career  He was raised in St. Louis, Missouri, and studied psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. Berlo remained at UIUC to pursue his doctorate in communications under Wilbur Schramm. While at the University of Illinois, he wrote a communications textbook titled The Process of Communication, which is still used today. Berlo was founding chairman of the Faculty of Communication at Michigan State University, serving from 1958 to 1971.  Time at Illinois State University  He assumed the presidency at Illinois State University in 1971. Berlo had high hopes for ISU, wanting it to become the premier undergraduate university in the state. One way Berlo did this was to have each academic department meet and decide where they could cut costs in order to reallocate funding. The cuts were seen in the elimination of academic programs and majors such as the Master‚Äôs in Physics and the Home Economics Teacher Education major, along with a reduction in admission to certain programs. Some controversial suggestions from Berlo were an added fee for on-campus health services and a family planning center. He also wanted to change the entire administrative structure of the university, which was met with heavy resistance from the Academic Senate of the university. One defining feature of Berlo‚Äôs presidency was the low morale seen among both faculty members and university students. His changing of faculty salaries without the concurrence of the faculty Academic Senate members and the centralization of governance at the university contributed to this. Berlo‚Äôs actions regarding who made decisions and the amount of power held by the Academic Senate, faculty members, and students who had been fighting for more power on campus upset all of these groups, and made them feel as if Berlo was ignoring the ISU Constitution and the Academic Senate (Champagne 99). One notable part of Berlo‚Äôs time in office at ISU was the career of Doug Collins, a notable basketball player who went on to both play and coach in the NBA, along with play in the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics. = Presidential Residence Controversy = During Berlo‚Äôs time as president, the Board of Regents governing the university decided that the president should live in a residence provided by the university, and the cost of construction would become a point of contention. It was discovered that the charges told to the Board were not entirely correct, and the building of the residence was much more expensive than previously estimated or approved. An independent audit found that the house cost over $80,000 over its approved budget, and since he was the president of the university, Berlo ultimately took the fall for this. There were also other costs from Berlo that were criticized, such as his food arrangement with a dining center and his liquor bills, which were mildly controversial due to Normal being a dry town. Berlo resigned as president of ISU on May 30, 1973.  Later Years and Death  Berlo moved to St. Petersburg, Florida after resigning from the ISU presidency, where he worked for the Industrial Council of the YMCA. He died at the age of 66 on February 23, 1996, and was buried in the New Saint Marcus Cemetery and Mausoleum in Affton, Missouri.  External Links  * David K.

Adding some flexibility to each blade/leg, it imitates the tendon in the insect leg and holds potential energy for better traction.

It is set within Olympic National Park and is situated at the eastern end of Obstruction Point Road which is a narrow eight mile dirt road on Hurricane Ridge. The road ends below the south slope of Obstruction Peak, and a short hike leads to the summit. Its nearest higher peak is Elk Mountain, to the northeast. Obstruction Peak is a major triple divide point such that precipitation runoff drains into tributaries of the Elwha River, Dungeness River, and Morse Creek. All three thence empty into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Climate Set in the north-central portion of the Olympic Mountains, Obstruction Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.  History  It's believed that a road-building project in the 1940s was expected to run a full- circle loop from the Elwha River to Hurricane Ridge and Deer Park, then on to Port Angeles. The project was stopped at Obstruction Point because of loose shale and inherent instability of the slopes here, hence the obstruction.

The Venezuelan government claims the event was a targeted attempt to assassinate Maduro, though the cause and intention of the explosions is debated. Others have suggested the incident was a false flag operation designed by the government to justify repression of opposition in Venezuela. Incident Two small drones carrying explosives were detonated while President Maduro delivered an outdoor speech, possibly in attempt to attack the president and other government officials. The incident occurred in the middle of a speech he was giving commemorating the Bolivarian National Guard's 81st anniversary. The first drone hovered over Avenida Bolivar, detonating in the air over National Guardsmen standing in ranks. It was reported that seven National Guard officers involved in the parade were injured and treated in hospital, other sources later claim it was eight.  After the explosion, bodyguards immediately protected Maduro with ballistic shields. Maduro, his wife Cilia Flores, and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L√≥pez, who were standing next to him, left the scene unharmed. A second explosion was then heard seconds later ‚Äì hundreds of National Guardsmen fled the area, abandoning President Maduro, and the broadcast of the event was cut. Despite the images of National Guardsmen fleeing the scene that were broadcast to the public, Minister of Communication Jorge Rodr√≠guez falsely stated that the troops maintained their ranks in the parade. A second drone crashed into the Don Eduardo apartment block, located two blocks from where Maduro was speaking. Local journalists and residents shared images of smoke appearing from the apartment building's windows shortly after the incident. A woman living in the building said that a drone had crashed into one of the building's windows, injuring a girl who was taken to hospital. Video footage shows two drones; amateur video of one drone exploding, a video showing few people in the area, and another video recorded by Telemundo cameraman Cesar Saavedra of a drone hitting the Don Eduardo apartment building. Many members of the press were arrested immediately after the incident, preventing independent investigations and reporting. Reporters from VIVOplay and TVVenezuela were detained by National Guardsmen shortly after the incident. Investigation = Government =  Initial  In a televised address to the nation two hours after the incident, Maduro stated that an investigation had been opened immediately and a number of those connected to the attack had been apprehended and charged. Eleven journalists were detained during the attack and released afterwards. Six other suspects were initially arrested within hours of the incident, which later increased to seven. Reportedly, one of these was known to authorities because of his involvement in the 2014 protests, whilst another had an arrest warrant out for apparently taking part in the assault on Fort Paramacay. President Maduro also laid blame on extreme right-wing elements in his own country acting together with extreme right-wing elements in neighbouring Colombia, and specifically named Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos as being behind the incident. A spokesperson for President Santos promptly denied the accusations. Maduro also suggested that Venezuelan exiles in the United States, particularly Miami, Florida, may have been involved. According to Interior Minister N√©stor Reverol only two DJI M600 drones were used, though Minister of Communication Jorge Rodr√≠guez said that there were three drones used during the incident, and the reason they failed to reach their target was that radio inhibitors made them lose signal. Police at the scene had previously said that authorities shot down a drone. Following a brief initial two-day investigation, Reverol presented its findings and explained that the two drones he claimed were involved were loaded with over 4lb combined of plastic explosive C4 elements, and that one was to be exploded above Maduro's head with the other intended to explode directly in front of the President. In one presentation, Maduro showed debris that he \\"insisted\\" revealed the drone by the stage was carrying gunpowder and lead, and only the one that hit the building was loaded with C4 as well as gunpowder. On 6 August 2018, Prosecutor General of Venezuela, Tarek William Saab, announced that two individuals described to be the alleged pilots were arrested and \\"will be charged with the crimes of treason and intentional homicide\\" in addition to other crimes. Post-arrests Requesens holding his arm against SEBIN agents during arrest, while the camera is being turned away Shortly after midnight VST on the morning of Tuesday, 7 August, Maduro said that he had \\"hard evidence\\" of \\"the Colombian oligarchy\\" planning the assassination, and that he would share it \\"in the next few hours\\". Maduro announced in a video at the same time that they now knew that the perpetrators were trained during April and June 2018 in Chin√°cota in Norte de Santander, Colombia, an area which borders the north of Venezuela. In this video he also said that he had been informed that Juan Manuel Santos had told former Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy that Maduro would be gone before he left office. The promised report had not surfaced by the afternoon. In the evening, Maduro gave a two-hour television presentation from Miraflores Palace which included a partially-censored video of former Venezuelan security official Juan Carlos Monasterios Vanegas, who said he was one of the \\"bombers\\", giving a statement blaming Julio Borges and Juan Requesens. President Maduro directly accused opposition leaders Borges and Requesens of being behind the incident, also saying that Borges lived in a mansion in Bogot√° that the outgoing Colombian government paid for, though no details of his \\"alleged role\\" were revealed. During this time, agents belonging to the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN), Venezuela's intelligence agency, arrested Requesens and his sister, student leader Rafaela Requesens, though the latter was later released. In the video, Monasterios claimed Requesens told him \\"to kill the President\\". As members of the Venezuelan National Assembly, Borges and Requesens received parliamentary immunity. The arrest of Requesens was described as a violation of the Constitution of Venezuela, specifically Article 200 which states that \\"only the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, subject to authorization in advance from the National Assembly, shall have the power to order their arrest and prosecution\\". However, Diosdado Cabello, president of the disparate Constituent National Assembly, said he would \\"introduce legislation\\" to strip them of the protections. The protected status of the pair was then removed by the next day. In response to the accusations, Borges tweeted a statement from Bogot√° telling Maduro that he was \\"not fooling anybody\\", calling the supposed attack a \\"farce\\" that Maduro \\"staged to justify the persecution of opponents\\". Cabello responded to this, telling him to \\"go find some good lawyers\\".leftMaduro's evening presentation claimed that everyone involved in the attack was offered $50 million USD as well as United States citizenship status. He also said that they had planned an attack on 5 July, which was postponed due to the drones not arriving on time. Two of those who were arrested and named by Maduro as being involved and providing evidence were a Colombian, Rayder Russo, who was accused of being a planner and financier of the alleged attack, and an American, Osman Delgado, who was accused of being another financier. Both Russo and Delgado were known by the Venezuelan resistance to be informants loyal to Maduro, with rebel leader √ìscar P√©rez previously revealing that the two were \\"moles\\" selling information to the Bolivarian government in December 2017. On Wednesday, 8 August, Saab said that investigators had so far connected nineteen people to the attack, and three had already been charged. Maduro also named wanted individuals living in Colombia and the US state of Florida, saying he wanted cooperation from these two nations and that he \\"[trusts] in the good faith of Donald Trump\\". On Thursday, 9 August, Reverol said that 25 people were under investigation, and Efecto Cocuyo reported that eight had been detained. Though Borges and Requesens are leaders of the Justice First party, Reverol revealed that \\"the majority of the suspects are from the resistance group Come Venezuela\\" (sic). Minister of Communication Jorge Rodr√≠guez gave a national presentation on 10 August announcing that at least one of the drones involved was detonated from the United States, though a report by The Independent that was warning of drone threats said this could be done \\"from 5 kilometres\\" away only, as well as showing a supposed flight map of the drones path from Colombia all the way to Avenida Bol√≠var. Rodr√≠guez also said that he had submitted a Red Notice to Interpol for the capture of \\"assassin\\" Julio Borges, and showed a video of Juan Requesens recorded in Helicoide.  Raids and seizures  One announcement of alleged perpetrators by Reverol on Thursday, 9 August, included details of several properties that the investigation had seized. They were owned by Delgado, who was accused of helping to finance the attack. Two cars and an apartment in his name were also seized and raided. The SEBIN searched the Pestana Hotel, which is almost eight kilometers from the place of the incident, during the investigations of the events. Caracas Chronicles reported that the homes of Juan Requesens, Julio Borges and other deputies, Julio Mora and Jorge Mora, had been raided. Rafaela Requesens, Juan's sister and student President of the Central University of Venezuela, expressed her anger that at least forty SEBIN agents broke into their house, also saying that the government wanted to plant false evidence to incriminate her brother. On 7 August, the SEBIN also raided the house of students Valeria Sosa and Luis Alfredo Sosa, from Andr√©s Bello Catholic University and Sim√≥n Bol√≠var University, respectively, and whose mother is accused of being involved in the drone attack. Roberto Rodr√≠guez, a student leader at Andr√©s Bello, denounced that the raid was done without a search warrant, that the electricity was cut off from the building, that many belongings in the house were stolen, and that the family were forced to escape.  Requesens videos  During his 10 August presentation, Rodr√≠guez showed a video of Requesens allegedly admitting to working with people involved in the supposed attack. In the video, Requesens named several of the suspects, including Borges, though this was limited to him saying that Borges \\"asked [him] for a favour to help a person get from Venezuela to Colombia\\". He added that this person was Monasterios and that they had written to Mauricio Jim√©nez, an immigration official in Colombia, for help with getting passage, who immediately offered it. Requesens gave no details relating to an attack on Maduro. The opposition condemned Rodr√≠guez's actions, saying that Requesens was drugged and tortured into making a false confession. One source from Requesens' Justice First party assured journalists that the government drugged Requesens to obtain confessions and, when they realised he was still of sound mind, then continued to drug him until he became incontinent, as well as threatening to murder his parents and rape his sister. In a second video, Requesens is wearing only underwear which is visibly stained with faeces. Following the release of the videos, Requesens was moved from being held at the prison of SEBIN, El Helicoide, to the Palacio de Justicia. After five hours, he was returned to Helicoide with his hearing deferred and being denied to see his lawyer. Health professionals discussed the behavior of Requesens in the videos broadcast to the public. National Assembly deputy and doctor Jos√© Manuel Olivares stated that \\"[t]he clinical signs of Juan Requesens show that there is an alteration of cognitive conditions, which is clinically associated with the administration of drugs that affect the conscience or the will\\". An independent Venezuelan psychologist, Alberto Barradas, also observed his behavior, stating in a \\"subjective conclusion\\" that Requesens appears \\"drugged, beaten, threatened\\", later saying \\"[a]s a Venezuelan, I think we are outraged to see the images of a deputy full of faeces, of excrement, knowing he was tortured. I believe that as Venezuelans we must feel anger, pain and indignation\\". In a moment of protest and solidarity with Requesens, Venezuelans demonstrated in public while wearing underwear to share moral support for Requesens, who was seen in the government's video wearing underwear covered in faeces. Though he was originally transferred to the court building on 10 August, Requesens' hearing was deferred to Monday, 13 August. This hearing went ahead, lasting two days, and on Tuesday, 14 August he was denied bail. He was remanded in custody after being charged with seven crimes against Maduro and the State, to go on trial and face Venezuela's maximum punishment of 30 years in prison. On 12 August, the government shared a third video of Requesens. In it was Requesens again speaking to camera, in what they claimed was another part of the \\"confession\\" from the first video. Requesens says that he briefly had telephone contact with a man who identified himself as \\"Alexander\\", who confirmed that Monasterios had got to Colombia. However, at his hearing, Requesens told his lawyer, Joel Garc√≠a, that he doesn‚Äôt remember recording a confession video or any of the people he named. Requesens also told Garc√≠a that guards gave him the stained underwear to \\"mock him\\". None of the videos were submitted as evidence.  Further arrests  On 10 August, SEBIN arrested Luis Enrique Mart√≠nez Rico, the Coordinator of Security and Defense Commission of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), the government's political party. Reports stated that Mart√≠nez was arrested due to his alleged involvement in the incident. Colonel Garcia Palomo said in a 13 August statement delivered to La Patilla that \\"I have no connection with the events that took place in Caracas on 4 August, through the use of drones or the people who they abused, whom I do not know\\" (sic). On 14 August, the number of suspects had increased to 34, fourteen of whom had been charged, with Saab saying it could rise further. It was also announced that Venezuela were now formally seeking extradition of suspects from Peru, with the government having issued 27 international arrest warrants to Interpol, as well as requesting account blocks and asset freezing for Osman Delgado and Julio Borges. On 22 August, the numbers of those implicated by the government rose again, Saab saying that 25 people had been charged with 43 total suspects involved. The previous Sunday he had named several of these extra suspects, and announced that there were now only 18 Interpol alerts out, with nine extradition orders between Colombia, the US, and Peru. Cabello accused another deputy of the National Assembly, Ismael Garc√≠a, of being involved in the \\"conspiracy\\" on 15 August. Garc√≠a was a member of Primero Justicia with Borges and Requesens until he ran for candidacy with Acci√≥n Democr√°tica on 10 August. Garc√≠a had been reportedly \\"in the sights\\" of the regime in the days before this, along with Jos√© Manuel Olivares, who had recently been forced into exile. Maduro said during one speech that he knew that the attackers \\"were planning a transitional government\\" and that current politicians were intended to lead it. = Independent = One early independent investigation by NGO Control Ciudadano alternatively claimed that \\"at least one drone belonged to the military\\", and that a drone was \\"shot\\", blaming the government but indicating that it would be unintentional. Some investigative journalism reports began appearing. Citizen journalism organization Bellingcat stated that two drones \\"likely\\" armed with explosives were involved and that \\"[d]espite apparent claims from one group, it is not possible to accurately attribute this apparent attack without further information\\". An informal report by a South American political commentator that followed similar analysis to Bellingcat also came to an uncertain conclusion, but rated the Maduro government staging the incident as a \\"1/3\\" chance and more likely than a \\"1/10\\" assassination attempt, saying that \\"[f]ar too much doesn't add up\\", like Maduro \\"knowing who the culprits [were] immediately\\" and some of the claims being \\"clearly made up\\", comparing these to evidence North Korea gave for imprisoning Otto Warmbier. Though various bodies and countries asked for an independent investigation to be performed in Venezuela, the practice of censorship in the nation prevented this from happening. One of the leading independent investigatory organisations in Venezuela, Armando.Info, was completely blocked in August 2018, with four of its writers also having travel restrictions imposed, barring them from leaving. On 14 March 2019, CNN revealed new details about the plot, based on new videos. Responsibility claims Responsibility for the attacks \\"has been claimed by a confusing array of spokesmen\\", including groups named \\"The Resistance\\", \\"T-shirt Soldiers\\" and the \\"Phoenix Group\\". A group named Soldados de Franelas (\\"T-shirt Soldiers\\") claimed responsibility for the attack on Twitter. Another group, called Operaci√≥n F√©nix (\\"Operation Phoenix\\"), made vague claims on Twitter, accusing the Maduro government of being involved in drug trafficking and stating that they sought to restore democracy in Venezuela. Three hours after the attack, Venezuelan journalist Patricia Poleo read a press release on her own YouTube channel from Miami, saying that militants from the F√©nix group claimed the attack. Different sources have variously claimed both groups as having connections to the Venezuelan rebel leader √ìscar P√©rez, who had been killed by Venezuelan government armed forces in the El Junquito raid. Salvatore Lucchese, a former Chief of Police of San Diego Municipality, Carabobo and former member of the Popular Will opposition party, claimed in an interview with Reuters in Bogot√° that he largely organized the events, adding that the \\"armed struggle\\" would continue and \\"no dictator leaves power peacefully\\". On the evening of 7 August, Maduro acknowledged this claim, telling the people in his two-hour national broadcast that \\"[a] former police boss of the Venezuelan right has been claiming responsibility for leading the attack. Today he was a special guest at the swearing-in of Colombia's incoming president\\". The day after, Lucchese tweeted that he \\"didn‚Äôt do anything\\" and was \\"one more soldier fighting for freedom\\". On his Spanish-language talk show, Bayly, Peruvian-American journalist Jaime Bayly claimed that he had known about the attack during the week before and he supported it. He warned that there would be more attacks coming up. A man who said he was a military dissident said that he had been part of a group of similar dissenters from all branches of the Venezuelan armed forces plotting a coup in Bogot√° to overthrow the Maduro government, but had no plans of assassination and were not involved in the attack on 4 August, having been infiltrated and disseminated some weeks before. Instead, he says that in April a group of civilians approached his group wanting to join forces and kill Maduro, and he believes they will have performed the attack because of videos they showed of armed drones in Miami. Bloomberg gives credence to this account because of the lack of organisation that the attack appeared to have. Suspects and arrests N√©stor Reverol shares information on the suspects Maduro and Reverol, acting as the Ministry of Interior, Justice and Peace, released the names of wanted people that informants named as committing the attack. The full names and photos of these people were released on wanted posters in Venezuela. El Nacional reported fifteen names on the afternoon of Thursday, 9 August. Diario Panorama and other news sources reported the addition of more names before the end of the day, and several more suspects were named and arrests were made in the following week.  On 31 August, the family of Juan Requesens went to the International Red Cross to give them information about the medical conditions of Requesens. Here, they also spoke to the media there about the other people also incarcerated, who were likely experiencing the same treatment, and noted that several of those prisoners had not even been to court. Requesens' lawyer, Joel Garc√≠a, also mentioned his concern for the other prisoners. The sister of Colonel Zambrano said at this time that her brother had not been seen by family or lawyers, either, and that guards had told her he wouldn't be available for thirty days. She was also concerned for the colonel's health, because his custodians had been requesting antibiotics, serums, and diuretics for him. A lawyer representing several of those accused of the attack said she had not been given access to any of them or their files. Another Justice First deputy, Fernando Alb√°n, was later arrested on suspicion of plotting the magnicide on Friday, 5 October. He was detained in the SEBIN HQ also, but was reported dead the following Monday, 8 October. Government officials claimed it was suicide, which was disputed. his friends, family, opposition political parties and Luis Almagro, Secretary General of the Organization of American States, argue that the councilor's death was murder. Reactions =Domestic= Venezuelan Constituent National Assembly The Venezuelan government referred to the incident as a \\"terrorist attack\\". A press release from the Venezuelan Constituent National Assembly, written by Diosdado Cabello, said that they \\"fiercely condemn the vile and cowardly attack against the constitutional President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\\" and that the \\"act of terrorism shows the hopelessness and frustration of the fascist right\\", also expressing solidarity with \\"the patriotic soldiers who were injured\\". The leading opposition group in Venezuela, Frente Amplio Venezuela Libre (\\"Venezuelan Liberation Front\\"), expressed confusion as to the nature of the incident, saying that they can't know if it was \\"an attack, a fortuitous accident, or any of the other stories being shared on social media\\". Two days after the explosions, on Monday 6 August, Maduro supporters rallied in downtown Caracas, waving flags and with painted faces. However, Reuters reporters on the scene said that there were only a few hundred people, most of whom were government workers, and with several telling the journalists that they had been instructed to attend to support Maduro's image. There was immediate outcry among the opposition in the nation after Cabello incited a move to strip supposed plotters and National Assemblymen Julio Borges and Juan Requesens of their diplomatic immunity. The National Assembly Vice President spoke out against the move, saying that the \\"constitution is clear\\" and \\"only the Supreme Court of Justice has the authority to order a deputy's arrest, with congressional approval\\". On 9 August, the National Assembly ‚Äì Venezuela's parliament ‚Äì requested that other nations ignore the arrest warrant on Borges, saying that it was \\"political in nature and should not be recognised by any foreign court\\". Chavista politician Sergio S√°nchez reported that people voicing anti-Maduro sentiment in the wake of the attack were being punished, citing a family from in Caracas who were \\"evicted [...] for making a political comment about the attack against the President\\", adding that the government now \\"relies on the fear of the people to maintain power\\". Following the release of a video of opposition leader Juan Requesens giving statements wearing underwear stained with faeces, Venezuelans protested in the streets wearing underwear in a statement of moral support for Requesens. A group brought some of Requesens' t-shirts as an offering for his release among other tributes for political prisoners during a mass service held in San Crist√≥bal, the capital of his home state T√°chira. The released a statement condemning the arrest and imprisonment of Requesens, saying it was \\"arbitrary and illegal\\", campaigning for the government to release him and naming \\"numerous and gravely serious objections\\" to his imprisonment, with the worst being the \\"obscene, protuberant, impudent and even boastful [...] dissemination of [Requesens'] alleged self-incrimination\\", saying that they will seek action against the government and aim to prosecute those at fault \\"once the Rule of Law has been restored to our beloved Venezuela\\". The opposition deputy Gilber Caro stood in front of the National Assembly on 14 August and stripped to his underwear to send support to Requesens. He said that a man's dignity is not dependent on his state of dress. On the Monday 13 August, a protest march called \\"La Patria Llama\\" (\\"The Fatherland Calls\\") was held starting at the edge of Petare, Miranda and travelled through the Greater Caracas area to Parque Carabobo station. It was organised by Cabello for supporters of the Maduro government who want to \\"bring to justice the extremists\\", Cabello adding that these people \\"would have to kill millions of Venezuelans\\" to change the country. =International= The attack was condemned by the governments of El Salvador, Nicaragua and Bolivia, as well as the FARC, a former terrorist group from Colombia. Cuban President Miguel D√≠az-Canel further announced that his nation would supply unlimited aid to Venezuela and the Bolivarian Revolution. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke by phone with Maduro, giving his best wishes to the President and to the soldiers injured in the incident. Uruguay and Spain both denounced the violence. The Spanish embassy also said that the crisis in Venezuela should be solved peacefully and democratically. Panama's president Juan Carlos Varela stated \\"that accusing former President Santos is irresponsible of President Maduro\\" and that \\"on one hand we condemn violence, but on the other hand we also condemn the fact that they are making baseless accusations against heads of state\\". Luis Almagro, Secretary General of the Organization of American States, stated that \\"[t]he null credibility of the Maduro regime prevents knowing the truth of what happened\\" and reiterated that he \\"will always condemn the use of violence as a political tool\\". A Brazilian court case was ongoing regarding the travel of Venezuelan migrants across the Brazil-Venezuela border, and it was closed on Sunday 5 August, the day after the attack, with Judge Helder Barreto suspending restrictions but closing the border to Venezuelans until stability was achieved on both sides. It was reopened shortly after the official bar, with the Brazilian Supreme Court saying the move was too reactionary and \\"not justified\\", commentators connecting the closure with an already strained situation gaining further \\"raised tensions\\" after the drone incident. The European Union promoted a \\"thorough and transparent investigation\\" and demanded the Venezuelan government to recognize \\"the constitutional powers of the National Assembly, including full respect for its prerogatives with respect to the parliamentary immunity of its members in accordance with the rights, legislation and established constitutional procedures\\". The Venezuelan government condemned the European Union's response, stating that it is \\"trapped in its irrational rhetoric\\" and that the European body intends to \\"ignore the terrorist actions\\". Vice President of the Subcommittee on Human Rights of the European Parliament, Beatriz Becerra, condemned the arrest of Juan Requesens, stating \\"Kidnapped, tortured, humiliated. [Juan Requesens] [a]n elected deputy. With all the constitutional guarantees abolished in Venezuela by a dictatorial regime. Please, Federica Mogherini and Antonio Tajani let's fulfill our commitment with a winner of the Sakharov Prize\\". The Federal Foreign Office of Germany condemned the arrest of Requesens calling it a \\"clear violation of parliamentary immunity\\" and demanded a \\"thorough and transparent investigation\\".  Colombia  Juan Manuel Santos (left) in April 2018. At the time of the attack, Santos was the President of Colombia. The earliest and most prominent of blame accusations were those levelled against Colombia, with Maduro specifically naming the Colombian President Santos as orchestrating his assassination, saying he had \\"no doubt\\" about it. The Colombian government quickly denied this, stating that Santos was too preoccupied with his granddaughter's baptism to think about overthrowing Maduro. Another statement added that it is \\"customary for Maduro to blame Colombia for any kind of problem in his country\\", and on the following Monday Santos himself tweeted to Maduro telling him \\"not to worry himself\\", also restating his own attendance at the \\"more important\\" baptism on the Saturday. Two days after the incident, on Monday, 6 August, the Colombian Civil Aviation Authority announced a ban on drones and multirotors at the Presidential procession for Iv√°n Duque's inauguration the next day over fears of a similar incident, with the prohibition extending to a radius and altitude of 2 nautical miles, or 12,000 feet, from Plaza Bol√≠var, Bogot√°. There were no drone attacks on the day, but it saw other attacks by FARC dissidents in which a police officer died and five people were injured. United States US representatives Mike Pompeo and Nikki Haley (left) in June 2018 In response to Maduro's accusations, the US National Security Advisor, John R. Bolton, denied US involvement in the attack and suggested that the incident could be \\"a pretext set up by the regime itself\\". Bolton also stated that if the Venezuelan government \\"has hard information that they want to present to [the US] that would show a potential violation of U.S. criminal law, [they'll] take a serious look at it.\\" On Monday, 6 August, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo restated that the United States government had no involvement. Telemundo reported that the US embassy told its citizens in Venezuela to \\"find a safe place to stay, maintain a low profile, and avoid protests\\". James Story, charg√© d'affaires at the US embassy in Caracas, met with Saab and Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza in the week following the incident. Arreaza told Fox News that Story said it was \\"the will of the U.S. government to cooperate\\". In response to the United States stating it would cooperate, Maduro said he would allow the FBI to investigate the incident, saying that if \\"the United States ratifies its offering for the FBI to cooperate in the investigations on the links in Florida [regarding] the plans of the 4 August assassination attempt and terrorist attack, [he] would accept it\\". The United States Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley was visiting the Colombian-Venezuelan border at C√∫cuta on Wednesday, 8 August, to discuss the migrant crisis, and commented that Maduro had caused the attack, that \\"he did this by creating this chaos\\" and that \\"everyone needs to be loud against Maduro and force him to leave\\". She also pledged US$9 million in aid to Colombia to help support the Venezuelan migrants there. = Others = The Venezuelan V√°clav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent-winning satirical news site El Chig√ºire Bipolar posted an article the day after the detention of Juan Requesens showing a photoshopped image of Maduro holding a pokeball with the headline \\"Nicol-ash Maduro announces open season on capture of political prisoners\\", likening him to the character Ash from Pok√©mon who has the mission to \\"catch them all\\". The site attributed the fictional quote \\"We are going to catch them all, the 150 deputies that are out there, we already have Requesens, now we are going after Borges and Meowth of Team Rocket\\" to \\"Nicol-ash\\". Controversy = Assassination legitimacy = The Guardian reported that the allegations made by Maduro were \\"too neat\\" and quoted commentators who doubt the assassination legitimacy. International Crisis Group consultant Phil Gunson stated that \\"[t]he official 'investigation' [is following course]: begin with the conclusions and work backwards\\", and senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America David Smilde added that \\"[Maduro will] use it to further restrict liberty and purge the government and armed forces\\". Peruvian newspaper La Rep√∫blica also wrote that \\"[s]ome analysts suspect that the attack is a desperate farce\\" and that \\"[i]t would not be the first time that an unscrupulous government mounted this type of setup,\\" comparing it to the burning of the Reichstag. The paper concluded that, \\"genuine attack or mounted farce, basically it does not matter: Maduro has taken things to this point, which suggests bloody outcomes\\". The German international news service Deutsche Welle said that the only certainty about the attack is that \\"[t]he only one benefitting from all this is Maduro himself\\", noting that the President \\"has claimed at least 20 coups or attacks against him, but not a single one has done him harm\\". They called the incident \\"'fake news'\\" because \\"[Maduro's] regime emerges from every actual or supposed attack stronger than before\\", relating this to the crisis in Venezuela by saying that \\"[e]ach incident further distracts from increasingly unbearable problems in the country\\". = Firefighter narrative = According to initial reports after the explosion, the Associated Press stated that firefighters attended the scene and claimed that a gas tank located in the Don Eduardo apartment block had exploded during the rally, the explosion caught part of the building on fire and had to be put out. An independent investigation by NGO Control Ciudadano did conclude, in regards to drone explosions, that \\"[t]he nearby building explosion was coincidental.\\" Efecto Cocuyo visited the building and reported that all apartments received piped gas, which does not require gas tanks. They could not say if there was also a gas tank. Video later provided by Telemundo did indeed appear to show a drone crash into the side of the apartment building. Days after the event, Bellingcat's investigation stated that the report by firefighters was an \\"early narrative\\" and that a \\"second drone crashed and exploded [...] and is the most likely cause of the fire which the Venezuelan firefighters described\\". = Use of drones = Media outlets in Spain and Ecuador quoted a soldier in the rally who claimed he saw no drones, but heard something \\"like a grenade\\". El Pa√≠s says Maduro's version of events is not credible. Former Venezuelan military aide Anthony Daquin talked to NTN24 about the incident and criticised the assassination theory, explaining that the event was a no-fly zone and any drones in the area would have been operated by the government. Another theory arose of accidental drone failure causing the incident, with The Guardian reporting an independent investigation had been opened by the NGO Control Ciudadano and its head Roc√≠o San Miguel, a military expert, which claimed that \\"at least one drone belonged to the military, who lost control of the device inflight. Soldiers then shot it down.\\" She repeated this statement later in a broadcast of Con La Luz with Efecto Cocuyo on 9 August, saying that \\"it was a mistake by the military and Presidential Honor Guard, and I believe that they destroyed the drones\\". According to former Venezuelan Vice Admiral Mario Carratu, claims that the drones were shot down by gunfire is inaccurate because \\"[p]lastic explosives can't be detonated with bullets. They more likely exploded prematurely due to poor preparations by the hit team\\". One piece of investigative journalism said that drones were involved, but it \\"[ruled] out the bizarre explosives claim\\", citing inconsistencies between the injuries of \\"an otherwise unscathed soldier with a cut on his head\\" and damage caused by use of C4, which it says would \\"destroy everything within a football field from the center spot\\". The Venezuelan ambassador to Barbados spoke on 7 August, saying that drones are actually completely banned in Venezuela. One of Maduro's television presentations had the President \\"insist\\" that the drone that exploded at the stage was loaded with gunpowder and lead, not C4, but the one that hit the building had gunpowder and C4.

He also played in his native Greece with Panathinaikos, Paniliakos and Panserraikos. In the early 1970s, he represented the state of Victoria against various touring sides, making five appearances and scoring twice. Biography Kokkinos was born in 1949 in Istanbul to Greek parents. His father Yannis was a timber merchant and wanted him to attend university and then go into the family business, but Kokkinos' prowess in soccer had led Lefter K√º√ß√ºkandonyadis to their door. K√º√ß√ºkandonyadis, who was Turkey's captain and of Greek descent, convinced Kokkinos' father to allow him to play for Pera Club, an amateur sports club based in Istanbul. However, in 1964, the Kokkinos family were forced to move to Athens, in the midst of the Cyprus dispute, where Turkish Prime Minister ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º renounced the 1930 Greek-Turkish Treaty of friendship, and took actions against the Greek minority. This meant that the family shop was locked, their bank accounts were frozen and they only had a week to leave the country. Kokkinos signed his first contract with Proodeftiki, who were Beta Ethniki Group 3 champions the previous season. He failed to settle in Athens and at sixteen years old, decided to purchase a ticket to tour the Patris which carried migrants to Australia. He hid in the workers' cabin, and by the time he was found, it was too late, so the workers took him under their wing. When the Patris stopped at Fremantle, Kokkinos left the ship to an address occupied by fellow Greeks and was given a change of clothes and a train ticket to Melbourne. Three days later, he arrived at Spencer Street station. Hungry and broke, he sat outside a Greek restaurant on Lonsdale Street for hours on end, where a daughter of a local priest took pity on him. She rented a room in Carlton for him, cooked him food and bought him new clothes. Kokkinos went to see South Melbourne Hellas, and attracted attention within twenty minutes by performing keepie uppies. Shortly after this, he signed with South as a junior and trained with the first team, later making substitute appearances for the side. Kokkinos played on the same team as fellow Greek Kostas Nestoridis, who was simultaneously South's captain and coach. At the end of the 1966 season, Nestoridis went back to Greece to see his family, so John Anderson was named as caretaker coach. Anderson put Kokkinos in the squad during the 1967 Ampol Cup, and he scored a brace on his first start for South. Nestoridis returned to the club for the 1967 season, but was annoyed at Kokkinos' insistence on maintaining an afro hairstyle. When Kokkinos refused to cut his hair prior to a match against Melbourne Hungaria, he was forced to have a haircut at half- time. He scored a brace in the second half, helping South to victory. Kokkinos finished the season as the club's top scorer with fourteen goals. In the 1968 season, he made two more appearances for South, until he moved back to Greece to play for Panathinaikos on the invitation of Nestoridis. His former club Proodeftiki attempted to delay his signing, when they tried to enforce their original contract. Kokkinos travelled with the team on a pre-season tour to the United States, and performed well in a match against Inter Milan. After the match, Kokkinos and Vasilis Konstantinou violated a curfew by attending a party, and when they arrived back at the hotel, manager Lakis Petropoulos was waiting for them and sent them back to Greece. As a result of the scandal, he made a single appearance for PAO, and returned to play for South in the 1970 season. However, his second stint at South would be brief, as he rejoined PAO midway through the season, where Ferenc Pusk√°s had just been appointed as manager. Kokkinos quickly fell out with Pusk√°s, after the Hungarian attempted to play him at left-back a couple times, so he decided to go back to Australia, with the intention of playing for South again. His third stint with South also ended midway through the season, and was speculated by fans as a reason why the club were beaten by a point in that season's state league. Kokkinos left South to join Paniliakos where Nestoridis was the manager, and then signed for Panserraikos, with his only goals of the season saving the club from relegation. Kokkinos returned to Victorian soccer the following year, turning out for Fitzroy Alexander, South's crosstown rivals. By June 1974, he was back at South for the fourth time in his career, and finally won the State League, as well as that year's Dockerty Cup. He stayed on for the 1975 season, as the club finished as runners-up to Fitzroy, but they did win the Dockerty Cup for the second time. Kokkinos left to join Hakoah Eastern Suburbs, a club in the NSW State League First Division, but he was soon back in the Victorian State League, this time with Melbourne Juventus. The next year, Kokkinos had a short stint in the inaugural season of the National Soccer League, playing for Fitzroy United (formerly Fitzroy Alexander). He made two appearances: one in a Round 2 tie against South, the other in a Round 11 tie against Brisbane City. Kokkinos was signed by West Adelaide Hellas as a replacement for John Kosmina, who had signed for English First Division side Arsenal. He did not make an appearance for the side, as his off-the-field activities caught up with him. Kokkinos was having an affair, and in order to fund a lavish lifestyle and a gambling addiction, he threatened to tell journalists of their relationship if she did not provide him money. He was taken to the Magistrates' Court of Victoria and sentenced to nineteen months in HM Prison Pentridge, of which he served just six. Upon his release from prison, and with his career now on the wane, Kokkinos had a short stint with Western Suburbs. In 1980, he moved to Perth as player-manager for Floreat Athena. However, the season ended in disaster as Athena were relegated. Although now a married man, his extramarital affairs continued, as did his alcohol and gambling addictions, and later, a dependence on cocaine. He fathered a son and then attempted to go into business, but the constant drug use led to a divorce. Kokkinos relocated to Queensland to start over, but he served two more jail terms in Melbourne for cocaine offences. It finally came to a head, when his father visited him in jail and broke down in tears. Kokkinos had never seen his father cry, and believed that despite his success in soccer, he had dishonoured the family name. He reconciled with his father, who returned to Greece and died in 2001. Kokkinos fathered another son, and later settled in Mordialloc, still keeping in touch with former players and attending South Melbourne's home matches. In 2009, he was inducted by South to their Hall of Fame.

He was also a leader in early anti-nuclear protests as a member of Operation Gandhi. Wardle worked with Bayard Rustin, A. J. Muste, Henry LeRoy Finch and Michael Scott to promote non-violent protest against racial inequality, with views developed and honed during his time in South Africa in 1952 as an assistant to Manilal Gandhi on the newspaper, Indian Opinion. Career and peace activism Born in Liverpool, Wardle served in the British Army from 1942‚Äì1947. He emigrated to South Africa to take up welfare work in 1948 and came to a full conversion to pacifism while working with Manilal Gandhi at the Phoenix settlement. Wardle returned to London in late 1952 working as a journalist on Peace News, a newspaper for the grassroots peace and justice movement. Active alongside Peace News editor Hugh Brock and fellow peace campaigner Michael Randle in Operation Gandhi, Wardle took part in the early anti-nuclear marches to Porton Down and the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Hartwell. In an interview with the Imperial War Museum in 1992, Michael Randle describes the impact Wardle on him during the first hastily organised march to Aldermaston in 1952, discussing his absolute commitment to non-violence and his firm and articulate opposition to atomic energy for any purpose whatsoever. These marches proved to be the forerunners of the much larger Aldermaston Marches in 1958 and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Profoundly influenced by Gandhism, Wardle was in demand to speak against apartheid and promoted nonviolence in many forums during the 1950s, both in the UK and internationally. He was accepted to deliver testimony before the United Nations Commission on the Racial Situation in South Africa in Geneva, 1953, where he presented with Rev Michael Scott. Wardle's full testimony is housed at the UN Archives.Testimony of Mr. Tom Wardle In 1955, he undertook a three-month Peace Education tour of the US, sponsored by the American Friends Service Committee. Speaking on topics such as ‚ÄòThe Struggle in South Africa‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Contemporary Revolution‚Äô, he was accompanied by Bayard Rustin in many of the speaking engagements. These engagements included the keynote address to the War Resisters League annual dinner alongside Rustin, A. J. Muste and Henry LeRoy Finch. Later years In 1960, Wardle and his family emigrated to Australia where he continued to work actively in advocating humanitarianism and environmentalism. He became a secondary school teacher in Geelong and on retirement, a volunteer tutor of philosophy in Geelong U3A until his death in 1992. Personal life Wardle married his Dutch wife, Nanny (nee Bijvoet) in 1947, and has two adult children Shanti (Wong) and Mark.

The route starts at MS 184 in the town of Meadville and travels southeastwards. MS 556 crosses over the concurrency of U.S. Route 84 (US 84) and US 98 inside the Homochitto National Forest, and the route ends at US 98 south of Bude. The route was designated around 1953, after a gravel road from US 84 to US 98, which had existed since 1928, was paved. Route description All of MS 556 is located in Franklin County. In 2017, the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) calculated 330 vehicles traveling on MS 556 southeast of Victor Drive on average each day. The route is legally defined in Mississippi Code ¬ß 65-3-3, and it is maintained by MDOT as part of the Mississippi State Highway System. MS 556 starts at the three-way junction with MS 184 in Meadville, and it begins travelling southeastward. As the route is inside the Homochitto National Forest, it travels through a heavily forested area. The road intersects Fourth Street, which ends at the Franklin County elementary, middle, and high schools. MS 556 leaves the city limits of the town south of a road leading to the Meadville Municipal Park. The route crosses over the concurrency of US 84 and US 98, and it intersects Mullers Lane south of the overpass. Access to US 84 and US 98 are only available at both termini of the route. The road leaves the national forest and travels southeastwards towards the Homochitto River. MS 556 turns eastward near the river, and it ends at its eastern terminus at US 98 south of Bude. The road continues as River Road Southeast, a road that travels back to MS 184. History A gravel road from Meadville to another road south of Bude has existed since 1928. The road at the western terminus was designated as US 84 by 1935, replacing MS 22. The gravel road was paved by 1953, and it was designated as MS 556 around two years later. The road at eastern terminus was also designated as US 98 by 1955, after being renumbered to MS 44 earlier. By 1984, US 84 was rerouted around Meadville, and its old alignment remained in the state highway system as MS 184.

All 20 people on board were killed. It was the first fatal crash of a Ju-Air aircraft since the company began operations in 1982. The cause of the crash is under investigation. Accident The aircraft was flying from Locarno Airport to D√ºbendorf Air Base, on the return leg of a two-day trip. The weather was unseasonably warm with choppy winds.Die Wetterstation liegt in etwa 2500 m H√∂he am Crap Masegn. At 16:56 local time on 4 August (14:56 UTC), the Junkers crashed into Piz Segnas mountain, at an elevation of .Vorbericht der Schweizerischen Sicherheitsuntersuchungsstelle SUST The Tschingelh√∂rner mountain ridge looking northwest, with the Martinsloch hole (centre) and Segnas Pass (right). The Ju 52 crashed on the plateau below. Swiss authorities stated that the plane appeared to have crashed almost vertically and at high speed. A witness at nearby Segnas Pass saw the Junkers approaching from the south and fly by the Martinsloch, a distinctive breakthrough, or hole, in the Tschingelh√∂rner mountain ridge, next to the pass. Then, instead of flying over the ridge, the aircraft made a sharp turn, dived vertically and crashed onto the plateau below. Around 10 minutes before the crash, another witness had observed the Ju 52 suddenly banking sharply to the left and losing altitude, before increasing engine power and recovering to normal flight. The aircraft was carrying three crew and seventeen passengers, all of them Swiss apart from an Austrian couple and their son. Nine of the people aboard were women and eleven were men. Aircraft and crew The aircraft involved was a tri-motor Junkers Ju 52/3mg4e, registration HB-HOT, msn 6595. It had served with the Swiss Air Force from 1939 to 1985, when it was acquired by Ju-Air, a company that offers sightseeing flights on vintage aircraft, and had logged 10,000 hours of flight time. It had been used in the films Where Eagles Dare (1968),‚ÄúWhere Eagles Dare film locations‚Äú, 2018 and Valkyrie (2008) and the 2012 German movie '. The aircraft had been issued with a certificate of airworthiness by the Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA) on 6 April 2018, valid for two years. On the day of the crash, the Junkers was piloted by two veteran captains, aged 62 and 63. Both had extensive experience as pilots for Swissair, Swiss and Edelweiss, as well as more than 30 years of militia service with the Swiss Air Force. Both also had several hundred flight hours' worth of experience with the Ju 52. The third crew member was a 66-year-old flight attendant, also with 40 years of professional experience. Aftermath Hiking routes and the local airspace were closed off for the duration of the recovery operation, which involved five helicopters. Ju-Air suspended all flights by its other Ju 52 aircraft for two weeks, until they resumed operations on 17 August under stricter conditions. Following a review in March 2019, while the accident investigation was still ongoing, the FOCA banned Ju- Air from conducting commercial passenger flights with Ju 52s, allowing only private flights for club members. It was deemed that historical aircraft such as the Ju 52 no longer meet current safety requirements for commercial passenger transport. Investigation The accident is being investigated jointly by the Swiss Transportation Safety Investigation Board (STSB) and the cantonal police of Grisons on behalf of the federal and cantonal prosecutors' offices. A spokesperson for the STSB said that the Junkers \\"fell like a stone to the ground\\", and that the heatwave in Europe could have been a factor in the crash, as heat reduces an aircraft's climb performance. The police indicated that no distress signal was received from the aircraft prior to the crash. Investigators ruled out a collision with a cable or another aircraft, and said that there was no indication of foul play or the aircraft losing parts before the crash. The aircraft was not fitted with any flight recorders. Investigators are hoping to find some relevant information from passengers' personal photographic and video recordings during the sightseeing flight. The STSB issued its preliminary report on 15 August 2018. An intermediate report was issued on 20 November 2018, citing anterior corrosion marks and cracks, not related to the accident, which effectively grounded the two remaining Ju-52 of Ju-Air (HB-HOP and HB-HOS) until further investigation of these airframe and engine issues.

Due to advances in forensic science, by 1901, biologists were able to determine whether the origins of stains recovered from crime scenes or upon a suspect's body or clothing were blood, and whether the bloodstains originated from a human or animal source.One Was Not Enough pp. 51-52 Consequently, although investigators had been unable to prove extensive staining found upon Tessnow's clothing following his 1898 murders were wood dye, as he had claimed, or human blood, by the time he committed his 1901 murders, pioneering precipitin testing enabled investigators to prove his clothing had been extensively stained with both human and animal blood, despite his claims to the contrary. This forensic testing ultimately proved Tessnow's guilt.The Casebook of Forensic Detection p. 202 The tests conducted by biologist Paul Uhlenhuth upon Tessnow's clothing proved to be the first instance in which the forensic analysis of bloodstains was used in the conviction of a criminal. Murders =Heidemann and Langemeier= On the morning of 9 September 1898, two seven-year-old girls named Hannelore Heidemann and Else Langemeier left their neighbouring homes near Lechtingen (now a district of Wallenhorst), north of the town of Osnabr√ºck, to attend the village school, located just 300 yards from the Heidemanns' cottage.One Was Not Enough p. 46 When both girls failed to arrive home for lunch at 12:15 p.m., their frantic mothers visited the village school, only to discover that neither child had arrived at school that morning.One Was Not Enough pp. 46-47 Monument to Hannelore Heidemann and Else Langemeier, erected in Lechtingen Both Jadwiga Heidemann and Irmgard Langemeier fetched their husbands from work to initiate a search for their daughters.A Plague of Murder: The Rise and Rise of Serial Killing in the Modern Age ch. 2 This search was assisted by several friends and neighbours and covered the entire village. After three hours, a decision was made to expand the search radius to include nearby woodland. Shortly after 9 p.m., these volunteers discovered the nude body of Hannelore Heidemann.One Was Not Enough p. 48 The child had been extensively mutilated and dismembered, with sections of her body strewn about the forest. Later that evening, local police discovered the nude body of Else Langemeier concealed within bushes close to where Heidemann had been found. Her body had also been extensively mutilated and dismembered.Investigating DNA and Blood p. 23 Police questioning of local residents produced a witness who informed police he had observed a local carpenter named Ludwig Tessnow walking into the village from the direction of the woodland on the morning of the children's disappearance. Furthermore, this witness claimed Tessnow's clothing was heavily stained with dark, reddish- brown blotches. Tessnow was arrested, still wearing this stained clothing.One Was Not Enough p. 48 Tessnow protested his innocence, insisting the ample dark stains upon his clothing were wood dye which had spattered onto his clothing in recent carpentry jobs he had performed for locals, and that the eyewitness had observed him walking in the direction of his home from one of these jobs. Furthermore, although a button found at the crime scene matched the buttons upon his suit (which was missing one button), Tessnow claimed he had lost the button several weeks prior. In his questioning, Tessnow displayed no signs nervousness or agitation, or any signs indicating he suffered from a form of mental illness. He was eventually released from custody due to a lack of sufficient evidence. Tessnow made no attempt to leave Lechtingen, and was observed wearing this stained clothing on several subsequent occasions.One Was Not Enough p. 49 In January 1899, he relocated to the village of Baabe in the district of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.The Casebook of Forensic Detection p. 201 =Stubbe brothers= On the evening of 1 July 1901, two young brothers named Hermann and Peter Stubbe (aged eight and six) disappeared in the Baltic resort of G√∂hren, having informed their parents of their intentions to play near the family home. When the brothers failed to return home for supper, their father, several neighbours and the village policeman briefly searched the village for the brothers before they were reported missing.The Casebook of Forensic Detection p. 201 The following morning, the brothers' bodies were found by a neighbour concealed in a thicket in the stretch of woodland close to their home. Both had been extensively bludgeoned with a large stone found close to the bodies, and both brothers had been mutilated to the same degree as Heidemann and Langemeier, with dismembered sections of their bodies scattered over a wide area of the woodland. The skull of Peter Stubbe had been crushed. His neck had been severed to the spine, with a jagged wound inflicted to his abdomen causing his intestines to protrude. His heart had also been extracted. The pelvis and legs of Hermann Stubbe had been severed, and were later discovered at an unspecified location. The heart of the older boy was also missing, and was never found.One Was Not Enough p. 49 Police questioning of all local residents produced one eyewitness who stated she had observed the brothers talking with a \\"journeyman carpenter\\" named Ludwig Tessnow on the afternoon of their disappearance. This witness stated Tessnow was a native of R√ºgen and a locally eccentric figure, who lived in a neighbouring village.One Was Not Enough p. 50 Arrest Tessnow was arrested and taken into custody on 2 July, protesting his innocence. A routine search of his home revealed several items of clothing which, although still damp from having been recently washed, bore dark stains reminiscent of blood. A heavily-stained pair of boots were recovered from beneath a stone sink in Tessnow's kitchen. These boots had also been washed. When questioned as to the source of these stains, Tessnow claimed the stains were wood dye which had spattered onto his clothes via his profession as a carpenter.The Casebook of Forensic Detection p. 201 His story was not believed, and he was remanded in custody, to await trial before the examining magistrates at Greifswald.One Was Not Enough p. 50 The local prosecutor, Ernst Hubschmann, discovered that just weeks prior to the brothers' murders, a local farmer had observed a young man fleeing from one of his meadows. This farmer then discovered that seven of his sheep had been mutilated, with numerous limbs and viscera strewn about the field. Noting the similarities between the manner in which these animals had been mutilated and their limbs and organs scattered about the crime scene and the Stubbe brothers crime scene, Hubschmann arranged for this farmer to view a lineup of possible suspects, in which the farmer identified Tessnow as the man he had observed fleeing from his meadow. Tessnow admitted to having read newspaper reports of this incident, but also protested his innocence in the murders of these sheep; again insisting the stains upon his clothing and boots were not human or animal blood, but wood dye.The Casebook of Forensic Detection p. 202 =Link to 1898 murders= Having read Tessnow's statement, the examining magistrate, Johann-Klaus Schmidt, noticed similarities between his accounts of wood dye being the source of the stains on his clothes and the excuse given by a potential suspect in the 1898 murders of two children near Osnabr√ºck. Schmidt soon learned this suspect had been Tessnow, and that he had been released from custody by Osnabr√ºck police due to a lack of evidence. The murders themselves remained unsolved.One Was Not Enough p. 51 =Forensic examination= Shortly before the murders of the Stubbe brothers, a German biologist, Paul Uhlenhuth, had developed a method that allowed the detection of human and animal blood: the precipitin test. Uhlenhuth had been an assistant since 1899 at the Hygiene Institute of the University of Greifswald. Hubschmann conducted a meeting with the examining magistrate to discuss whether Uhlenhuth should be commissioned with conducting forensic tests upon the items of clothing and footwear recovered from Tessnow's home. The decision was approved and two separate packages containing Tessnow's clothing and footwear, plus the stained stone recovered at the Stubbe crime scene, were sent to Uhlenhuth on 29 July and 1 August.One Was Not Enough p. 52 On 8 August 1901, Uhlenhuth submitted a report, dated 5 August, to police in which he conclusively determined that although some stains upon Tessnow's overalls, clothing and shoes were actually wood dye, the vast majority of the stains upon his clothing were human blood, with some bloodstains found upon Tessnow's jacket and trousers also sourcing from sheep. Uhlenhuth was also able to determine the discolorations upon the large stone found at the crime scene were also human blood, indicating this stone had been used to extensively bludgeon both brothers.The Casebook of Forensic Detection p. 202 Trial Tessnow's trial for the murders of the Stubbe brothers was held in the spring of 1902 in Greifswald. Tessnow pleaded not guilty to two charges of murder and a third charge of murderous assault. The chief prosecution witness was Paul Uhlenhuth, who testified as to his findings that, contrary to Tessnow's insistence the stains upon his clothing and boots were wood dye, all the garments were stained with human and animal blood. Several psychiatric experts also testified at the trial; each stating Tessnow had murdered the brothers in a state of \\"degenerate moral responsibility\\". Six psychiatrists testified on behalf of the defence to their conclusions that Tessnow was insane at the time he committed the murders. Tessnow's trial lasted ten days.

The perpetrator was occupied by numerous indications. DNA of the victims were found on a knife and gloves belonging to the offender.

She escaped and became a mother to Karl Tobien, who later wrote Dancing Under the Red Star about her experience.  Early life  Tobien was born in 1921 near Detroit, Michigan, and her father worked for Ford Motor Company. When she was 10, Ford moved its location to Russia, and her father was transferred along with some 450 employees from 1930 to 1932. When she was 17, Tobien's father was arrested and imprisoned in Russia after being convicted on trumped-up charges of treason.Left to survive in the Soviet regime, Tobien and her mother faced years of poverty and near starvation. It already was a struggle for Tobien and her mother to survive. They made it through years of sorrow, only to then both be accused of the same charges her father faced.  Imprisonment  In 1943 Tobien was accused of espionage and sentenced to 10 years of hard labor in Stalin's gulag. The prison went on for 33 years.The work was harsh and people cut their arms off to avoid the labor. The living conditions killed many prisoners were killed. Tobien and many women found ways to adjust to the cruel conditions they were forced to live through. Tobien is the only American woman to have survived the harsh imprisonment lifestyle.  Personal life  After her release from prison, Margaret married Gunter Tobien. Their son, Karl Tobien, was born in 1956 just outside the gulag. He was five years old when he, his mother, and his grandmother returned to the US. In 1991 Tobien converted to evangelical Christianity. As Karl grew older he wanted to know about his mother's past. She told him about the cruel conditions she faced. Karl later wrote Dancing Under the Red Star, which told his mother's story.

He sowed seed from several Elaeagnus species growing next to one another. These included E. macrophylla and E. pungens. Doorenbos gave the hybrid the epithet ebbingei, honouring J.W.E.

The film was released worldwide on 18 October 2018, on the Dussehra festival. It was shot in Canada and Punjab, India.  Plot  Vikram (Amrit Maan), Eliza (Neeru Bajwa), Dilip Singh (Sardar Sohi) and Lavi are a Punjabi family living in Canada. Dilip is the father of Vikram, Eliza is the wife of Vikram and Lavi is their son. Eliza doesn't like the fact that Dilip teaches Lavi about Punjabi culture because Lavi is going to live in Canada his whole life. Dilip wants to go to India for a visit, but Eliza has his passport. Eliza's neighbours are a couple with a daughter, and the wife works with Eliza. The wife's Father-In-Law (B.N. Sharma) arrives from India and his son (Gurpreet Ghuggi) doesn't want him to stay here because his wife doesn't want him to. After much pleading, he is allowed to stay. The father-in-law and Dilip talk about how daughters-in-law always disrespect their fathers-in-law. Dilip also has a huge urge to go to India. One day there is a party, and during that party the Father In Law and Dilip make a plan to get Dilip's passport so he can go to India. Eliza finds out and Dilip says the whole family will go to India with me. Just before the flight, the neighbour's daughter asks Lavi for something from India. Lavi says I will give you an 'Aate Di Chidi' (bird made from dough in Punjabi), because the other day Dilip told Lavi how an Aate Di Chidi was the best thing you could get from a Punjabi childhood. The family arrive in India and Dilip sees things have changed. Dancing at funerals, the impact of social media and much more. Dilip complains that the village sign has the village name written in three languages, and Punjabi is at the bottom. Dilip's other son, (Karamjit Anmol) married a woman from Bihar. Vikram and Eliza want to go and see the city nearby but Lavi says he wants to see the village, due to which Dilip becomes really impressed. Just before going to India, Dilip's friend who is Punjabi as well told him to go to his family's wedding and Vikram's co-worker told him to give his earnings to his parents who live in Punjab as well. The family go to Dilip's friend's wedding, wearing traditional Punjabi clothing. At the wedding venue, the guard stops them thinking they are dancers. A man who is leading the wedding sees Eliza, thinking she is a dancer and calls her in. Eliza and her family sees they are dancing on the stage with guns in their hands and alcohol. Seeing the guns, Eliza dances in fear. After the wedding, Eliza becomes angry at Dilip because Eliza believes Punjab isn't as good as Dilip said to be. Some days later, the family go to Vikram's co-worker's house so that they can receive the money. The co-worker's parents become happy because they can now become financially stable again. However, their spoilt son who lives in Punjab starts arguing with them due to which a huge fight takes place and Dilip's turban falls off. Dilip then accepts the horrible truth about Punjab and India- it has changed. Eliza then regrets the fact that she tried to prevent her son learning about Punjabi culture. The village sign also then has the name written at Punjabi at the top, telling people that your mother language is the most important. Just before the flight to Canada, Lavi tries to find an 'Aate Di Chidi' as he promised his neighbour's daughter he will get one. He couldn't find it. In Canada, Eliza gives Lavi and the neighbour's daughter an 'Aate Di Chidi', meaning that you can gain knowledge about your culture in other countries as well.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. History Copper was discovered in the Keweenaw Peninsula in the 1940s, leading to the opening of the Quincy Mine in 1856. In 1859, the Quincy Mining Company platted the town of Hancock. Both the mine and the town grew rapidly, and by 1862, 1700 people led in Hancock. The first public school for the town was opened in 1863. The school went through several buildings, and in 1875 a new brick Union School was constructed on Quincy Street, in front of the site of the present building. This school became too small, and in 1893 a Central Primary School was constructed nearby, and in 1875 school became the junior/senior high. In 1922, the 1875 building was destroyed by fire. The Hancock School Board began making plans to construct a new building, but the local depression due to low copper prices caused voters to reject a proposed tax. However, the Board scaled back plans, and a new tax was approved later that year. The Board purchased lots behind the old school and hired architect G. L. (George Lionell) Lockhart of St. Paul, Minnesota to design the school and local contractor Archie J. Verville to build it. Construction began in early 1923, and was completed in late 1924. Junior and senior high students began using the school in November 1924, and were joined by elementary students from the Central Primary School at the start of the 1925 school year. The old Central Primary School was eventually demolished in 1962. In the late 1920s and particularly during the Great Depression, the economy of Hancock suffered. Families left the city, but the lack of jobs kept students in school, and enrollment remained high. The economy boomed again during World War II, but after the war, the Quincy mine closed, leading to another exodus of families. In response, the school district annexed nearby rural districts to keep enrollment up. In 1970, elementary students were transitioned out of the high school building. However, Hancock's schools were becoming outmoded. The district built a new elementary school in 1989, and in 1996 passed a bond measure to build a new high school and refurbish the 1923 building into a junior high. High school students moved to the new building in 1999, and the old building remained serving grades six through eight. In 2008, the district passed a measure to build a new junior high, and students moved into the new building in January 2010. The school district gave the old building to Finlandia University, which plans to renovate the building for its College of Health Sciences, for community functions, and for apartment space. Description The old Hancock Central High School is located high on a hillside, with a wide terraced lawn in front of the building and stairs leading up to it. The building itself is a three-story, symmetrical, flat-roof red brick Collegiate Gothic structure, composed of a central block flanked by setback wings on a high raised basement. A cornice and parapet wall run across the top. The foundation is stone and concrete, and the water table, window and door surrounds, and other decorative details on the building are made from concrete painted white. The windows were originally wood, but were replaced with aluminum windows; some openings are partially filled with solid panels. The projecting central block is nine bays wide, containing the four-door main entrance in the center bay in a projecting vestibule. The entrance is flanked with brick buttresses and topped by a parapet containing a plaque reading \\"A.D. 1923.\\" The entrance opening is a compound Tudor arch with a transom above containing pointed arch tracery. Above the main entrance is a four-part horizontal compound window on the first floor, an eight-part compound window on the second, and a sixteen-part compound window on the third. Each wing contains four bays; the inside bay of each wing projects slightly and contains a projecting entrance vestibule, smaller and simpler than the main entrance. The entrances contain double doors, with a transom window with Gothic tracery above. Above that are a pair of double-hung windows on the first floor and six-part compound windows on the second and third floors.

Early Life  Gabbar Singh was born as Gabra Singh in 1926 in Dang village of Gohad Tehsil, Bhind district in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. It is situated in the Chambal division. His father's name was Raghuveer Singh Gujjar.  Dacoity career  In 1955, Gabbar Singh left his house and village to join the famous Kalyan Singh Gujjar gang of Bhind during that era, straightway plunging into a career of murders, dacoities and kidnappings. Later, Gabbar formed his own gang between October and December 1956, he committed a series of murders and dacoities in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. In December 1957, he went to on to disfigure several persons in Machhuari, Bhakre, Chammodi and Chirenasta villages in Madhya Pradesh. = Chopping off noses = The reign of Gabbar Singh, notorious for lopping off the noses of 116 persons in the most inhuman fashion. = Ransom reward on head = The State Governments of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh declared a ransom reward of Rs. 50,000 for his head in 1959.

Jews from Imperial Russia lived there periodically as fur traders, and a Jewish community has existed since the 1880s. The Klondike and Nome gold rushes attracted Jews to Alaska to seek their fortunes as miners and businessmen and resulted in the first organized Jewish communities. In the Nazi period, Jewish refugee resettlement in Alaska was seriously considered by the government, but after facing backlash, never came to be. Alaskan Jews played a significant role in business and politics before and after statehood, and have included mayors, judges, senators and governors. Today, there are Jews living in every urban area of the state. Early history Dawson City in 1899 The Earps‚Äô saloon, The Dexter, in Nome In the 1850s and 1860s, during the time of the Russian America colony in Alaska, Russian Jewish fur traders working for the Russian-American Company had commercial ties with the Jewish community in San Francisco. After the United States purchased the Alaskan Territory from Russia in 1867, some San Francisco Jewish miners, merchants, fur dealers, and traders moved up to Alaska. At the formal transfer of sovereignty in Sitka, Jewish soldier Benjamin Levi (Levy) lowered the Russian flag and raised that of the United States. The following year, two Jews from San Francisco, Louis Sloss and Lewis Gerstle, helped found the Alaska Commercial Company. In 1885, the first permanent Jewish settlers, Robert Gottstein and his wife, moved to Juneau. They were followed by their son Jacob, who settled in Anchorage soon after it was founded. Jacob established a successful business (which would later merge with Carrs), while his wife, Anna, a teacher, helped found Alaska's first Parent-Teacher Association (PTA). When the Klondike Gold Rush took off in 1897, a number of Jews were among the fortune seekers. At one point, up to 200 Jews were living in Dawson City, where the first Jewish religious services in the territory probably took place. Sid Grauman of Grauman's Chinese Theatre was among the Jews living in Dawson during this period, and spent his youth there with his family. A Jewish cemetery in Dawson that was created during the rush, Bet Chaim, was rediscovered in 1998. Jews also ventured to the Nome Gold Rush that began in 1899. In 1900, Sam Bayles, brother of prominent Alaskan pioneer businessman Isadore \\"Ike\\" Bayles, arrived in Nome with the first Torah in Alaska. After hearing about the discovery of gold, 19 year old Max Hirschberg biked the from Dawson to Nome in ten weeks, despite freezing temperatures and extreme weather. Frontier lawman Wyatt Earp and his Jewish common-law wife Josephine Earp earned a fortune running their successful Nome-based saloon, The Dexter, during the peak of the rush. In 1900, around 60 Jews attended Rosh Hashanah services in Nome. The Jewish community in Fairbanks was first organized by immigrant Robert Bloom in 1904. Between 1904 and 1910, during the Fairbanks Gold Rush, there were enough Jews to have regular High Holy Days services. In 1908, the Fairbanks community formally organized Congregation Bikkur Cholim, and the Clay Street cemetery still has a Jewish section dating back from this period. Following the gold rush, there were few Jews remaining in Fairbanks other than Robert Bloom and his wife, Jessie, who came from Ireland in 1912. They continued to be the driving force in the Fairbanks community, Jewish and otherwise, for decades. Jessie Bloom started the first Girl Scouts chapter in Alaska in 1925. Robert Bloom was among those who helped establish the base that became Fort Wainwright, and was among the founders of the University of Alaska. When World War II brought a number of Jewish GIs to the Fairbanks area, the Blooms acted as ‚Äúunofficial chaplains‚Äù and opened their home to many service members. Leopold David became the first mayor of Anchorage after it was legally incorporated in 1920.  1940s ‚Äì 2000s  Ernest Gruening In 1939, Ernest Gruening was appointed governor of the Alaska Territory, a position he held until 1953. Often called \\"the father of Alaskan statehood\\", he lobbied and advocated intensely for Alaska to become a state. When it did, he became its first senator, elected to the United States Senate on November 25, 1958. In 1906, Russian-Jewish immigrant and Fairbanks resident Abe Spring proposed that Jewish refugees fleeing Russian pogroms be settled in Alaska. Spring's idea was soon rejected by the U.S. Congress and was not seriously considered for decades. Over 30 years later, in the face of Nazi persecution of Jews in Germany, a similar idea was considered. Following Kristallnacht, the Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes proposed a Jewish settlement in Alaska with the aim of both building up Alaska and its industry and creating an opportunity to allow in more German Jewish refugees. The resulting Slattery Report and the introduction of a bill to make the idea possible were roundly rejected by the Alaskan public who did not think that such \\"aliens\\" would fit in well. While the bill died in subcommittee in 1940 and the plan never came to fruition, the subject garnered fresh interest in 2007 with the publication of the bestselling novel The Yiddish Policemen's Union by Michael Chabon. During World War II, Jewish GIs were among the tens of thousands of service members who were stationed in Alaska. The Elmendorf Air Force Base near Anchorage retained a Jewish chaplain between the 1940s and 1980s, changing every two years and rotating between Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox leaders. In 1974, Alaska's only mikveh was established at Elmendorf Air Force Base for the Jewish chaplain's wife and the broader community. These chaplains often ended up serving the entire Jewish community in Alaska, travelling to cities, small towns, and outposts for a bar mitzvah or offering a learning opportunity. From the 1940s through the 1970s, Jewish military personnel outnumbered Jewish civilians in Alaska. Zachariah \\"Zach\\" J. Loussac was the mayor of Anchorage from 1948 to 1951. A Jewish immigrant from Russia, he became a local philanthropist after selling his business and contributed greatly to Anchorage's first purpose-built library. While the library building he helped make a reality no longer exists, the main branch of the Anchorage public library system is still named in his honor. Justice Jay Rabinowitz The largest congregation in Alaska, Beth Sholom in Anchorage, was first formed in 1958 and became affiliated with the Reform movement in 1960. The congregation's small first synagogue was built in 1964 and was used for religious school classes and Shabbat services but not for the High Holy Days when larger facilities were required. As membership grew, a new larger synagogue was required and was opened for the congregation's 30th anniversary in 1988. Jay Rabinowitz was a Justice on the Alaska Supreme Court for over thirty years, from 1965‚Äì1997, and was Chief Justice for 12 of those years. His tenure began during the first years of statehood when much of Alaska's constitution was untested, and many of the over 1,200 opinions (along with 200 dissents) he wrote while on the court have defined the legal structure governing Alaska. The Rabinowitz Courthouse in Fairbanks is named in his honor. Avrum Gross served as the Alaska Attorney General from 1974‚Äì1980 while Jay Hammond was Governor, despite their differing personal politics. The Jewish Congregation of Fairbanks was incorporated in 1980, started its summer rabbinic intern program in 1989, received a full-size Torah in 1991, and in 1992 purchased a synagogue building and became known as Congregation Or HaTzafon. In 1997, the congregation became officially affiliated with the Reform movement. It is possibly the northernmost permanent synagogue in the world. Chabad emissaries, or shlichim, Yosef \\"Yossi\\" and Esty Greenberg arrived in Alaska in 1991 to set up a Chabad center in Anchorage and soon started prayer services and a preschool. In the 1990s, the popular TV show Northern Exposure centered on a young Jewish doctor moving from New York to a fictionalized small town in Alaska. Professor Bernard Reisman of Brandeis University conducted a demographic study of Jewish Alaskans 1994‚Äì1999. It found that contrary to popular assumption, the Alaska Jewish community was more, not less, affiliated on average than other Jewish Americans in the \\"Lower 48\\". In 2005, Congregation Sukkat Shalom in Juneau opened its first synagogue after years of meeting in members' homes. 21st century Currently, there are an estimated 6,000 Jews living in Alaska, most of whom reside in Anchorage, followed by Fairbanks, Juneau, and several smaller communities such as Sitka and Ketchikan. The Jewish community there often refers to itself as the \\"Frozen Chosen\\". There are presently two permanent rabbis in the state, both of whom are in Anchorage, Michael Oblath of Congregation Beth Sholom, and Yossi Greenberg of Chabad. Anchorage mayor Ethan Berkowitz, who assumed office in July 2015, is the third Jew to serve in this position. Democrat Les Gara and Republican Jay Ramras are two other Jews prominent in state politics. Mountain Ripinski, Alaska In 2013, Chabad's Alaska outpost, headed by Yossi and Esty Greenberg, opened a new campus in Anchorage that serves Alaskan Jews as well as visitors. The state's only mikveh is also on the campus, built after the one at Elmendorf Air Force Base was demolished in 1999. In addition, the Chabad center houses a preschool and the Alaska Jewish Museum, which showcases the ways that Jews have made an impact in Alaska and explores Jewish history, culture, and the Holocaust. In 2016, Captain Michael Bram became the first Jewish chaplain at Joint Base Elmendorf‚ÄìRichardson in 25 years. Heritage monuments There are at least four mountains named for Jews in Alaska: Mount Ripinski after Solomon Ripinski (Ripinsky), Mount Neuberger after Richard L. Neuberger, Mount Applebaum after Samuel Applebaum, and Mount Gruening for Ernest Gruening. Additionally, the Gerstle River was named for Lewis Gerstle.

Another early resident was navel officer Poul de L√∏ven√∏rn who lived in the building from 1808 to 1810. Ship-owner and politician Lauritz Nicolai Hvidt lived in the building from 1812 until his death in 1856. He was a member of Copenhagen City Council from 1840 and its chairman from 1841. As a liberal politician, he was involved in the work for a free constitution. On 20 March 1848, he led a procession of 10,000 people that marched from Copenhagen City Hall on Nytorv to Christiansborg Palace. The jurist F. T. J. Gram (1816-1871) was a resident in the building from 1848 to 1853. His next home was in Gammel Strand 36. The politician Anders Sand√∏e √òrsted lived in the building as Hvidt's tenant from 1851 and remained there until his death in 1861. The archeologist Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae lived in the building from 1853 to 1857. Cabinet Secretary Jens Peter Trap (1810-1885), publisher of the monumental work Trap Danmark, lived in the building 1857‚Äì1871. The influential architect and local politician Ferdinand Meldahl lived in the building from 1858 to 1875. Journalist and politician C. St. A. Bille (1828-1898) lived in the building from 1875 to 1880. Ferdinand Frederik Ekman (1839-1901) was a resident in the building at the time of his death in 1901. He is one of the businessmen depicted on Peder Severin Kr√∏yer's monumental 1895 group portrait painting From Copenhagen Stock Exchange. He was married to royal opera singer Nanna Maria Andrejette Ekman. Gyldendal director Peter Nansen (1861-1918) lived in the building from 1912 until his death in 1918. Det Hoffensbergske Etablissement, a printing business, was from at least 1910 to 1950, based in the building. Architecture The building consists of four storeys over a high cellar.

Origins  The cultivation of the olive tree in the western part of the Gulf of Taranto has been introduced by the Messapians during the 10th century b.C. and it has been improved by the Greeks and the Phoenicians. In the National Archeological Museum of Taranto it is possible to see some Greek amphorae with mythological scenes linked with the olive tree and its cultivation.  Geography  The extra-virgin olive oil Terre Tarentine is produced in the western area of the province of Taranto next to the border with Basilicata on the Ionian side of Apulia. This territory includes the municipalities of Taranto, Ginosa, Laterza, Castellaneta, Palagianello, Palagiano, Mottola, Massafra, Crispiano, Statte, Martina Franca, Monteiasi and Montemesola. The soil is sandy mainly made of limestone.  Characteristics  The extra-virgin olive oil Terre Tarentine is yellow with green shades. It has a fruity taste with some light bitter and spicy aroma. It is perfect for vegetables (raw or cooked) and for the second courses like meat and, above all, fish. It is used for some traditional fish recipes like the ones with the Mussels of Taranto. Despite the PDO recognisement for this extra-virgin olive oil, it is very hard to find and, as opposed to the other PDO extra-virgin olive oil of Apulia, a specific market is not developed yet.

She is a four-time national champion and an Australian representative oarswoman who won a bronze medal at the 1994 World Rowing Championships. Club and state rowing Raised in South Australia Carmen Klomp's senior rowing club rowing was initially from the Port Adelaide Rowing Club and later the Riverside Rowing Club in Adelaide. She first contested the Australian Rowing Championships in 1991 when she won the U19 national single scull title from her Port Adelaide teammate Anna Ozolins with whom she would go on to row at state and national representative levels. She made her first state representative appearance for South Australia in the 1991 women's youth four which contested and won the Bicentennial Cup at the Interstate Regatta within the Australian Rowing Championships. In 1992 she rowed again in the South Australian youth four. In 1994 she stepped up into the South Australian senior women's four which won that year won the ULVA Trophy at the Interstate Regatta. She rowed in five consecutive South Australian women's fours from 1994 to 1998, stroking the crew in 1995 and rowing to a second ULVA Trophy victory in the bow seat of the 1996 SA four. Klomp rowed in the five seat of the South Australian women's eight when in 1999 the women's heavyweight event at the Interstate Regatta switched into coxed eights. That SA crew placed third and Klomp held her seat in the eight in 2000 and 2001 when the SA women's eights placed second and fifth. International representative rowing Klomp and Ozolins made their Australian representative debut together in a double scull contesting the 1991 Junior World Rowing Championships in Banyoles. They rowed to a fifth placing. The following year at the 1992 Junior World Rowing Championships in Montreal, Ozolins and Klomp rowed the double scull to a silver medal.Klomp-Wearne at World Rowing At the 1994 World Rowing Championships in Indianapolis Klomp and Ozolins rowed the coxless pair to a bronze medal and were seated together in the stern end of the Australian women's eight who finished in sixth place. In 1995 the stern five of the eight were all South Australians including Klomp still in the seven seat. They missed the A final and finished in eight place. Other than some seat changes that eight of 1994 and 1995 was largely unchanged for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and Klomp remained at seven. The crew with an average age of 22, had to qualify for the Games through the qualification regatta in Lucerne (SUI). The fifth placing in the final was better than predicted form and excellent when compared to the experience in the other crews. In 2000 Klomp-Wearne made another tilt at Olympic selection and rowed in a double scull at the World Rowing Cup II in Vienna. It was her last Australian representative appearance.

Portrait by Eug√®ne Giraud The letters of Gustave Flaubert (French: la correspondance de Flaubert), the 19th-century French novelist, range in date from 1829, when he was 7 or 8 years old, to a day or two before his death in 1880. They are considered one of the finest bodies of letters in French literature, admired even by many who are critical of Flaubert's novels. His main correspondents include family members, business associates and fellow-writers such as Th√©ophile Gautier, the Goncourt brothers, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, George Sand, Ivan Turgenev and √âmile Zola. They provide a valuable glimpse of his methods of work and his literary philosophy, as well as documenting his social life, political opinions, and increasing disgust with bourgeois society.  Correspondents  4481 letters by Flaubert survive, a number which would have been considerably higher but for a series of burnings of his letters to his friends. Many of those addressed to Maxime Du Camp, Guy de Maupassant and Louis Bouilhet were destroyed in this way. From those that survive it appears that his principal correspondents were as follows. His family members: His friends, associates and readers:  Themes  Flaubert's personality was rigorously excluded from his novels, but in the letters, written at night after the day's literary work was done, he expresses much more spontaneously his own personal views. Their themes often arise from his life as a reader and writer. They discuss the subject- matter and structural difficulties of his novels, and explore the problems Flaubert faced in their composition, giving the reader a unique glimpse of his art in the making. They illustrate his extensive reading of the creative literatures of France, England (he loved Shakespeare, Byron and Dickens), Germany and the classical world; also his deep researches into history, philosophy and the sciences. Above all, they constantly state and restate Flaubert's belief in the duty of the writer to maintain his independence, and in his own need to reach literary beauty through a quasi-scientific objectivity. But his letters also demonstrate an enjoyment of the simple pleasures of Flaubert's youth. Friendship, love, conversation, a delight in foreign travel, the pleasures of the table and of the bed are all in evidence. These do not disappear in his maturer years, but they are offset by discussions of politics and current affairs which reveal an increasing disgust with society, especially bourgeois society, and with the age he lived in. They exude a sadness and a sense of having grown old before his time. As a whole, said the literary critic Eric Le Calvez, Flaubert's correspondence, \\"reveals his vision of life and of the relation between life and art: since the human condition is miserable, life can be legitimated only through an eternal pursuit of art.\\"  Critical reception  An 1877 letter from Gustave Flaubert to L√©on Cladel For many years after the first publication of the letters critical opinion was divided. Albert Thibaudet thought them \\"the expression of a first-rate intellect\\", and Andr√© Gide wrote that \\"For more than five years his correspondence took the place of the Bible at my bedside. It was my reservoir of energy\\". Frank Harris said that in his letters \\"he lets himself go and unconsciously paints himself for us to the life; and this Gustave Flaubert is enormously more interesting than anything in Madame Bovary\\". On the other hand, Marcel Proust found Flaubert's epistolary style \\"even worse\\" than that of his novels, while for Henry James the Flaubert of the letters was \\"impossible as a companion\\". This ambivalence is a thing of the past, and there is now widespread agreement that the Flaubert correspondence is one of the finest in French literature. Publication of them \\"has crowned his reputation as the exemplary artist\\". Enid Starkie wrote that Flaubert was one of his own greatest literary creations, and that the letters might well be seen in the future as his greatest book, and the one in which \\"he has most fully distilled his personality and his wisdom\\". Jean-Paul Sartre, an inveterate enemy of Flaubert's novels, considered the letters a perfect example of pre-Freudian free association, and for Julian Barnes this description \\"hints at their fluency, profligacy, range and sexual frankness; to which we should add power, control, wit, emotion and furious intelligence. The Correspondance...has always added up to Flaubert's best biography.\\" Rosemary Lloyd analyses the elements of their appeal as being \\"partly [their] wide sweep, partly the sense of seeing what Baudelaire called the strings and pulleys of the writer's workshop, and partly the immediacy of Flaubert's changeable, complex and challenging personality.\\" She continues, \\"Reading Flaubert's correspondence brings startlingly alive a man of enormous complexity, of remarkable appetites and debilitating lethargies, a knotted network of prejudices, insights, blind spots, passions and ambitions.\\"  Editions  * This four-volume edition was the first to try to collect Flaubert's letters. The unnamed editor was Flaubert's niece Caroline Commanville; she censored the letters freely, cutting out many passages which she thought indecent or which referred unflatteringly to living persons, especially to herself, and very often failing to notify the reader of these cuts by the use of ellipses. She also corrected his punctuation and sometimes \\"improved\\" his phrasing. * A five-volume edition which has been described as \\"seriously flawed\\". * In four volumes. The first scholarly edition. * In nine volumes, containing 1992 letters. Most of the notes were taken from Ren√© Descharmes' edition. * Adds 1296 letters to the edition of 1926‚Äì1933. * In five volumes, the first four edited by Jean Bruneau, and the fifth, which was published after Bruneau's death, co-edited with Yvan Leclerc (FR). This edition boasts an extremely thorough critical apparatus, with letters written to Flaubert, excerpts from the Goncourt Journal and other third-party documentation, together with explanatory and critical notes by the editor. Julian Barnes points out that in the third volume the appendices, notes and variants take up more pages than the letters themselves. * In five volumes. * Two volumes were published, taking the edition up to 1861, but the editor's death brought the project to a halt. * A freely available Web-based edition comprising 4481 letters, 134 of which have not previously been published. There have also been many single-correspondent editions of Flaubert's letters to one or another of his friends and associates, and selections from the collected letters.  Translations  * The first selection of the letters in English. Includes 122 letters. * According to The Nation, Steegmuller \\"edited them with discretion after translating them with authority\\". In two volumes. Jean Bruneau, editor of the then half-completed Pl√©iade edition, gave Steegmuller unfettered access to all his files, including the manuscripts of newly-discovered letters, with the result that some appeared in Steegmuller's English before they had been published in the original French. Its publication, The Times later said, \\"was a major event in the English- speaking literary world\\". Includes about 100 letters not to be found in the 1922 Mckenzie translation. Barbara Bray translated George Sand's letters, and Francis Steegmuller Flaubert's.

As a leatherworker, Griffin helped transition leathercraft from strictly a vocation to an accessible hobby through his work and teaching. As a magician, Griffin and his wife performed world wide with The Ken Griffin Show. Ken Griffin, Leather Artist Born in Jester, Oklahoma, Ken grew up roping cattle, becoming familiar with horses and saddles from a young age. He began working at his first saddle shop under J.B. Williams at a saddlery in Deming, New Mexico, where he learned to make saddles, as well as tool and carve leather. Fascinated by the different regional techniques, Griffin would study catalogues from saddleries all over the country to gather ideas and blend styles. He pursued this variety, working at different saddle shops all over the Western United States, when he found himself at a saddlery in Flagstaff, Arizona. While there, he picked up some work helping with the horses on Howard Hughes‚Äô The Outlaw, and ended up joining the crew back in Hollywood, California to finish the film. While in Hollywood, Griffin worked for Ed Bohlin making saddles and leather piece work for films, later opening a shop specializing in quality hand carved goods. These custom pieces were featured in many of the Western motion pictures of the time, and Griffin was commissioned to make custom pieces for celebrities such as Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Bill Elliot, and Robert Taylor. Griffin began teaching and found that he was dissatisfied with the quality of learning resources available for students. He went on to produce a step-by-step instruction book on leather carving featuring photographs of the finished product, which was the first of its kind. During that time, Ken began working with Dick McGahen of the Craftool Company, later acquired by Tandy Leather, where he designed tools and conceptualized the original ‚ÄúDoodle Pages‚Äù. The Ken Griffin Show In 1946, Griffin and his wife Roberta decided to pursue another passion: magic. The Griffin family went on to tour the United States with a two-hour illusion and magic show, performing in theaters, auditoriums, and outdoor stages. All five of their children joined them on the road and worked the act. Their first show was called ‚ÄúNAVO & CLAYCHA\\", American Indian Magician‚Äù, with scenery, props, and costumes all in Native American design. In the early days of their traveling magic act, the show was not very lucrative, so Griffin would pick up a few days work at saddle shops along the road. His wife Roberta documented their travels by publishing a bi-monthly article in the magazine The Craftsman titled Leather Skivings. As their show gained momentum, it was later changed to the ‚ÄúKen Griffin Show‚Äù and toured internationally for over 20 years, including in 8 USO tours. In 1979, Ken and Roberta Griffin were both honored with the Academy of Magical Arts‚Äô Award of Merit, as well as being the second recipients of the Al Stohlman Award for Achievement in Leathercraft in 1984.

It occupies approximately half an acre (0.2 hectares) north of 82 to 96 Welsh Row.  History  The garden was built between 1575 and 1580 by the Wilbraham family, adjoining their property, Townsend House (now demolished), off Welsh Row. It is surrounded by a grade II listed early 17th century wall.  Architectural features  Townsend House by Herbert St. John Jones, May 1934 The walls surrounding the gardens feature three bee boles, examples of a predecessor to the modern beehive. Other features of note include projecting plinths, ashlar dressing and decorative copings. The walls are constructed primarily of hand-made clamp bricks (250 mm wide x 50 mm high x 120 mm deep) set in lime mortar and the dressings are made of red sandstone. The walled garden's bee boles are recorded in the IBRA Bee Boles Register.  Nantwich Walled Garden Society  The garden is currently owned by property developers. The Nantwich Walled Garden Society (NWGS) believe that the best option for the garden would be for it to be restored for the benefit of the local community and visitors to the region. The society holds meetings in Nantwich and publish newsletters with news and updates relating to the Nantwich Walled Garden.

The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1935. Overview The Shimofunazuka Kofun is one of a group of kofun located in the Hirano area of central Wakasa, sandwiched between Japan National Route 27 and the tracks of the JR West Obama Line railway. This tumulus is oriented almost in an east and west direction with the circular portion facing east, almost the same as the neighbouring Kamifunazuka Kofun. The total length is 85 meters, with the circular portion having a diameter of 47 meters. The rectangular portion of the structure widens out towards the west, where it has a width of 47 meters. The height of the tumulus is 10 meters. The entire structure differs from that of the nearby Kamifunazuka Kofun in that fukiishi have not been found, although fragments of haniwa have been found in the area. The kofun is also surrounded by a dry moat. This tumulus was constructed in the mid-Kofun period and this pre-dates the Kamifunazuka Kofun. It may have been the grave a local king before Yamato dynasty control over the area of Wakasa was firmly established; however, this tumulus has yet to be excavated by archaeologists.

She is a four-time national champion and an Australian representative oarswoman who won a bronze medal at the 1994 World Rowing Championships. She was the stroke of the Australian women's heavyweight eight from 1994 to 1995 and from 1998 to 1999. Club and state rowing Ozolins' junior rowing was from the Port Adelaide Rowing Club and later the Adelaide Rowing Club. She first contested the Australian Rowing Championships in 1991 when she placed second in the U19 national single scull title behind her Port Adelaide teammate Carmen Klomp-Wearne with whom she would go on to row at state and national representative levels. She made her first state representative appearance for South Australia, one month after her seventeenth birthday in the 1991 women's four which contested the ULVA Trophy at the Interstate Regatta within the Australian Rowing Championships. In 1992 she rowed in the South Australian youth four. In 1994 she was back in the South Australian senior women's four which that year won the ULVA Trophy at the Interstate Regatta and was again in the SA four in 1995. In 1997 Ozolins took a scholarship to the Australian Institute of Sport and that year stroked the Australian Capital Territory women's four at the Interstate Regatta. In 1999 the women's heavyweight event at the Interstate Regatta switched into coxed eights. Ozolins stroked the 2001 South Australian eight to a fifth placing. International representative rowing Ozolins and Klomp made their Australian representative debut together in a double scull contesting the 1991 Junior World Rowing Championships in Banyoles. They rowed to a fifth placing. The following year at the 1992 Junior World Rowing Championships in Montreal, Ozolins and Klomp rowed the double scull to a silver medal.Ozolins at World Rowing At the 1994 World Rowing Championships in Indianapolis Ozolins and Klomp rowed the coxless pair to a bronze medal and were seated together in the stern end of the Australian women's eight who finished in sixth place. In 1995 the stern five of the eight were again all South Australians including Ozolins again at stroke. They missed the A final and finished in eight place. Other than some seat changes that eight of 1994 and 1995 was largely unchanged for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and Ozolins moved into the four seat. The crew with an average age of 22, had to qualify for the Games through the qualification regatta in Lucerne (SUI). The fifth placing in the final was better than predicted form and excellent when compared to the experience in the other crews. Ozolins was back in Australian representative crews in 1998 and at two World Rowing Cups in Europe and at the 1998 World Rowing Championships in Cologne she stroked the eight and rowed in a coxless pair with Jodi Winter. At the World Championships the eight placed fourth and the pair seventh. She held her seat as stroke of the Australian women's eight into 1999 when she set the pace at the WRC III in Lucerne and then at the 1999 World Rowing Championships in St Catharines where in her last Australian appearance the eight finished in fifth place.

The aim of the program is to gain access to these fiber-optic cables. } { style=\\"float: right;\\" NSA lists \\"Approved SIGINT countries\\" which are divided into two groups by their cooperation level with the NSA. } RAMPART-A is the code name for global mass surveillance and world-wide signals intelligence partnership program led by the United States National Security Agency (NSA). Aim of the program is to \\"gain access to high- capacity international fiber-optic cables that transit at major congestion points around the world\\". NSA is working with secret cooperation with the partner countries, which are hosting U.S. equipment and providing access to the fiber-optic cables. In 2013 the program had \\"access to over 3 terabits per second of data streaming world-wide and encompasses all communication technologies such as voice, fax, telex, modem, email internet chat, virtual private network (VPN), voice over IP (VoIP), and voice call records\\" and there were total of 37 partner countries including 17 European Union member states. There are two conditions on the partnership between the NSA and the partner country for making an agreement. The first one is that the partner countries will not use the NSA's technology to collect any data on U.S. citizens. The second one is that the NSA will not use the access it has been granted in the partner countries to collect data on the host countries' citizens. Although these conditions have exceptions, NSA doesn't state which those exceptions are. According to Edward Snowden, these agreements between the NSA and its partner countries are vague and are easily circumvented. The program was publicly revealed in June 2014, by the Danish newspaper Dagbladet Information and by The Intercept. Revelation of the program was based on as part of the leaks by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. According to a NSA's classified intelligence briefing in 2010, RAMPART-A was used across all NSA Analysis and Production lines, and in the previous year (2009), over 9000 intelligence reports were written based solely on the RAMPART-A data. The program cost about $170 million between 2011 and 2013. The program started in 1992. XKeyscore is implemented in the program's architecture.  Partners  The partner countries are divided into two groups by their cooperation level, \\"Second\\" and \\"Third\\". For the host partner country, U.S. provides processing and analysis tools and equipment, which means that the partner countries are able to use the NSA's tools for processing and analysing the data that flows in and out of their country. It's likely that not every partner country has RAMPART-A site(s); in 2013 NSA had set up at least 13 RAMPART-A sites, nine of which were in active state. Three of the largest sites, AZUREPHOENIX, SPINNERET and MOONLIGHTPATH gathers traffic from some 70 different cables or networks.

She was responsible for identifying the cause, a dinoflagellate Pfiesteria piscicida and its toxins, of mass deaths of fish that posed a public health hazard. Her studies also helped in improving legislation to control pollution and eutrophication.  Early life  Burkholder was born in 1953 in Rockford, Illinois.  Education  Burkholder received a bachelor's degree from Iowa State University in 1975 followed by an MS from University of Rhode Island (1981) and a Ph.D. from Michigan State University in 1986.  Career  Burkholder investigated fish deaths in a laboratory and found that the cause of that and deaths in North Carolina rivers were due to a dinoflagellate Pfiesteria piscicida which was normally found in the bottom sediment where they feed on organic debris normally but infect fish during migrator runs. The toxins from the dinoflagellate also affect humans, causing skin irritation, breathing difficulties and memory loss. The fish-killing forms of Pfiesteria tended to be associated with high nutrient flows into waters from agricultural and urban waste. The identity of the organism causing the fish kill and the circumstances under which it occurs led to a big public debate as well as within the biological community and was the subject of a book And the Waters Turned to Blood (1997) by Rodney Barker. Her research led to improvements in laws to control non-point pollution. Burkholder received the Scientific Freedom and Responsibility Award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1998.

She was the highest-rated horse of her age and sex trained in Britain in 2017 when she won two of her three races including the Group 1 Prix Marcel Boussac. In the following year she finished fourth in the 1000 Guineas and second in the Epsom Oaks before winning the Nassau Stakes and the Prix de l'Op√©ra. Background Wild Illusion is a bay mare with a white sock on her left foreleg who was bred and owned by Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation. She is trained by Charlie Appleby, whose stable is based at Newmarket, Suffolk, but typically relocates to Dubai in winter. She was sired by Dubawi a top-class son of Dubai Millennium, whose wins included the Irish 2000 Guineas and the Prix Jacques Le Marois. At stud, Dubawi has been a highly-successful breeding stallion, siring major winners such as Monterosso, Al Kazeem, Makfi, Lucky Nine and Night of Thunder. Wild Illusion's dam Rumh was a German mare who won four races in England including the Listed Ballymacoll Stud Stakes. She was a descendant of the Irish mare Le Melody (foaled 1971), the dam of Ardross and the female-line ancestor of Electrocutionist and Scorpion. Racing career =2017: two-year-old season= Wild Illusion was ridden in all of her 2017 races by James Doyle. She began her racing career in a minor race over one mile at Yarmouth Racecourse on 22 August in which she started the 15/8 favourite and won \\"comfortably\\" by two and a half lengths from Give And Take. The filly was immediately stepped up in class and sent to France for the Prix d'Aumale over 1600 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 3 September and finished third behind Soustraction and Efaadah. On 1 October, over the same course and distance, she started a 25/1 outsider in a seven-runner field for the Group 1 Prix Marcel Boussac. Polydream (winner of the Prix du Calvados), started favourite ahead of Magical (Debutante Stakes) and Soustraction. After racing in second place behind Soustraction, Wild Illusion took the lead 400 metres from the finish and kept on well to win by a length from Polydream. After the race Appleby said \\"She came forward a lot for her last run and we were delighted with her at home... She's as genuine as the day is long and is a lovely filly\\". In the official European Classification for 2017, Wild Illusion was rated the second-best two-year-old filly of the season, one pound behind the Irish-trained Clemmie. =2018: three-year-old season= On her three-year-old debut, Wild Illusion started the 11/2 third choice in the betting for the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 6 May and after briefly reaching second place she came home fourth behind Billesdon Brook, Laurens and Happily. William Buick took the ride when the filly was stepped up in distance and started 5/2 favourite for the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 1 June. She took the lead two furlongs out but was soon overtaken by the Aidan O'Brien-trained Forever Together and was beaten four and a half lengths into second place. She was then dropped back to Group 2 level for the Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot but despite starting favourite she was beaten by Magic Wand, to whom she was conceding three pounds in weight. At Goodwood Racecourse on 2 August Wild Illusion was matched against older fillies and mares in the Nassau Stakes over ten furlongs. She started at odds of 4/1 against five opponents, namely Rhododendron, Billesdon Brook, Urban Fox (Pretty Polly Stakes), Veracious and Wilamina. In a change of tactics, Buick sent the filly into the lead from the start, and after holding off several challengers she drew away in the closing stages to win by two lengths from Urban Fox. Appleby commented \\"I felt the drop back was going to help and tactically we couldn‚Äôt see where the pace was going to come from. So I asked William to go out there and do what he is good at. He is great on the front end and he gave her a lovely tactical ride.\\" On 7 October, just over a year after her win in the Prix Marcel Boussac Wild Illusion was sent back to France for the Prix de l'Op√©ra over 2000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. She started the 2/1 favourite ahead of fourteen opponents including Magic Wand, With You (Prix Rothschild), Lady Frankel (Prix de Lieurey), Rhododendron, Urban Fox, Homerique (Prix de Psych√©), Catellar (Prix de la Nonette) and My Sister Nat (Prix Bertrand de Tarragon). The favourite started well and was settled in fifth place by Buick as the other Godolphin runner Winter Lightning set the pace. Wild Illusion moved up on the outside entering the straight, took the lead 300 metres out and stayed on well to win by a length from Magic Wand and the fast-finishing Homerique. After the race Appleby said \\"All credit to the filly, she's danced every dance and is so tough. She was the only filly on the bridle turning in and I couldn't see her getting beat because there's one thing she won't do, she won't lie down and she'll gallop all the way to the line\\". For her final run of the year Wild Illusion was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf at Churchill Downs on 3 November and was made the 9/4 favourite in a fourteen-runner field. After being reluctant to enter the starting gate she recovered from a poor start to take the lead in the straight but was overtaken in the final strides and was beaten a neck by the Irish-bred four-year-old Sistercharlie. Appleby commented \\"I'm delighted with her run. She's run a fantastic race and has lost nothing in defeat\\". =2019: four-year-old season= For her first run of 2019 Wild Illusion was sent to Longchamp for the Prix d'Ispahan over 1800 metres on 26 May and started favourite against eight opponents. Ridden by Doyle she briefly took the lead 200 metres from the finish but faded in the final strides and came home sixth behind the Roger Varian-trained Zabeel Prince. Doyle was again in the saddle when the filly was sent to Ireland to contest the Pretty Polly Stakes at the Curragh on 28 June. She led for most of the way but was overtaken in the last quarter mile and finished fourth of the five runners in a race won by the three-year-old Iridessa. At Deauville Racecourse in August the filly started second favourite for the Prix Jean Romanet but after leading the race until the last 300 metres she dropped back and finished sixth of the eight runners behind Coronet.

Dushkova has written approximately 60 books which have been published in both Russia and Ukraine and translated into seven languages. Dushkova's philosophy is influenced by Blavatsky's Theosophy. Life Zinovia Dushkova was born on 19 July 1953 in the village of Congaz in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (currently the Republic of Moldova). Her father, Vasily Ivanovich Dushkov (1925‚Äì1957), was the chairman of the collective farm \\"Russia\\" in Moldova. Her mother, Antonina Ivanovna Dushkova (1927‚Äì1980), was a land surveyor who participated in geological expeditions. Dushkova's father held a senior position, and for this reason, during Soviet times, he was not permitted to baptize his children. But her grandmother secretly brought the newborn child into a church and had her baptized. Since during the rite of baptism there was no one present except a priest and the grandmother, she became Dushkova's godmother and the child was named after her. As Dushkova's parents were absorbed in their work, she spent her entire early childhood with her grandmother. After her father's death in 1957 from fulminant tuberculosis, her grandmother became fully responsible for Dushkova's upbringing. After her grandmother's death in 1964, Dushkova's mother Antonina along with her 11-year-old daughter, moved to the village of Staroye Sheptakhovo in the Chuvash Republic. In 1970, Dushkova returned to Moldova, but then moved to work in Odessa, Ukraine, in 1971; from there, in 1972, she moved to the Russian Far East, where she spent the following 27 years. Dushkova moved to Moscow in 1999. Zinovia Dushkova has two sons: Andrey (born 1972), graduated Lomonosov Moscow State University, a linguist, and Sergey (born 1979), graduated Moscow State University of Civil Engineering, a social worker.  Education  Dushkova studied at a secondary school in Cheboksary and at the school located in the village of Bolshoe Yanikovo. In 1986, Dushkova matriculated in the Far Eastern State University in Vladivostok with a specialization in history. Upon graduation, she worked as a teacher of history in a school. Dushkova was promoted to PhD in Philosophy in 2009 with a thesis called, Rol' lichnosti v istorii: istoriosofskiy analiz (\\"The Role of Personality in History: A Historiosophical Analysis\\"), at the philosophy department of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University.  Writing career  Zinovia Dushkova lived in monasteries located in the mountains, deserts, and caves of Tibet, Mongolia, Nepal, and India. As a result of her long travels and studies, she wrote nearly 60 books. They have been published in Russia and Ukraine and have been translated into seven languages. Some of them are works of fiction, while she regards others as having been handed down by the \\"Masters of the Ancient Wisdom\\", or \\"Mahatmas\\", and as being based on the \\"knowledge of the heart\\" and \\"enlightenment\\". Dushkova claims that these books were written not through mediumship or channeling, but were the result of what she calls the \\"Fiery Experience\\", and she explains it as divine inspiration. She says that writing books in this way requires many years of training, which adversely affects one's physical health and demands one's isolation from society. = Influences and the first books = Dushkova had studied the history of Christianity and the lives of Orthodox saints since early childhood. Later, while living in Vladivostok, she started to be interested in other world religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam, and she studied the work of Helena Blavatsky and Helena Roerich. As a historian, she also studied the sacred texts in terms of their moral and ethical teachings. This whole experience inspired her to write her first work of fiction, Probuzhdenie Istoka (\\"Awakening of the Source\\"), in 1992. There followed poetry collections and more fiction: Melodii Dushi (\\"Melodies of the Soul\\"), Latyn' nevospetaya (\\"Unsung Latin\\"), Grani Sveta (\\"Facets of Light\\"), Preodolenie (\\"Overcoming\\"), and Epopeya (\\"Epopee\\"). In 1995 Dushkova took her first trip to India, during which she wrote the book Bratstvo: Nadzemnaya Obitel' (\\"Brotherhood: The Ethereal Abode\\"). Work on it began in the study at Helena Roerich's estate in Naggar. According to the author, it is a continuation of the teaching of Agni Yoga and its logical conclusion. It is said that, during that trip, Dushkova also met with Master Morya in the Buddhist Ghoom Monastery, where his meetings with Helena Blavatsky and Helena Roerich had presumably taken place before. Additionally she states that she gained access to the Book of Dzyan, from which she translated a new fragment from the Senzar language and published it in The Book of Secret Wisdom. =The Teaching of the Heart and other works= The most significant work by Dushkova is The Teaching of the Heart, consisting of a series of books which were written while she traveled across India, Russia, Egypt, Israel, and Japan. The series was begun at Helena Roerich's estate in Kalimpong in October 1997 and its books were later written in places such as the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nazareth, Magdala, Mount Carmel, the Kremlin in Moscow, and Vladivostok. Other books by Dushkova include Ognennaya Bibliya (\\"The Fiery Bible\\"), Evangelie ot Sofii ‚Äì Sily i Premudrosti Bozhiey (\\"The Gospel of Sophia ‚Äì the Power and Wisdom of God\\"), and Taynaya Doktrina Lyubvi (\\"The Secret Doctrine of Love\\"). She also wrote books intended for children and youth: Skazki dlya Messii (\\"Fairy Tales for the Messiah\\"), Skazki kotorye rastut vmeste s nami (\\"Fairy Tales which Grow Together with Us\\"), 77 Zhemchuzhin siyayushchikh na chetkakh Vremeni (\\"77 Pearls Shining on the Beads of Time\\"), and Kniga Pritchey (\\"The Book of Parables\\"). Since 2004, Dushkova has ceased to meet with her readers in Russia and Ukraine, having bidden them farewell at the last meeting held in Moscow on 24 March, and has focused on trips abroad. From 2004 to 2016, Dushkova worked on the Dialogi (\\"Dialogues\\") trilogy in which she discusses the inner organization of Shambhala. The first two volumes were published in Russian in 2012, and the third in 2017.  Teachings and ideas According to the 12-year research by Lyudmila Grigoryeva, the Head of the Department of Religious Studies of Astafyev Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University, and Tatyana Simanzhenkova, the teaching of Zinovia Dushkova, being the continuation of the Theosophical tradition and occult-mystical in its nature, develops this religious orientation and devises new worldviews of the social and cosmic evolution of humanity in the transitional period. This teaching develops one of the fundamental ideas of the Roerichs' doctrine, outlined in the book Heart of the Agni Yoga series, considering it the most important in the modern social and cultural situation.Simanzhenkova, Tat'yana (2006).

PhD dissertation (in Russian). Krasnoyarsk: Siberian State Technological University. pp. 81‚Äì86, 97. The study showed that, among a wide variety of teachings in modern Russia and Ukraine, The Teaching of the Heart is distinguished by its ethical and humanistic orientation, an unusual way of thinking, and a vivid form of exposition. = Primary role of the heart = Dushkova identifies the primary role of the heart in the spiritual development of individuals. All of her books have in common the idea of cultivating the qualities of the heart, such as love, compassion, mercy, forgiveness, and gratitude, which, according to the author, contribute to the spiritual and moral formation of the individual. Her first published book Bratstvo: Nadzemnaya Obitel' formulates this basic idea of the teaching by saying: \\"Go by the way of the Heart.\\" She believes that \\"one religion\\" for modern humanity must be love, and therefore Dushkova's main appeal throughout her books is to \\"open the heart\\". = Unity of all religions = The central postulate of the teaching is the idea that there is one divine source of all religions. This idea is presented by Dushkova as a combination of two world religions in three images of the one deity: \\"The time of Maitreya, Buddha, and Christ has come; at their essence, they are One. Three times are merging, erasing the borders between them. The Past has intersected with the Future at point of the Present. The Great Buddha of the North appeared in the Image of Maitreya, bearing the features of the Resurrected Christ.\\"Dushkova, Zinovia (2000). Svyateyshaya Katriosofiya –°–≤—è—Ç–µ–π—à–∞—è –ö–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–æ—Å–æ—Ñ–∏—è [Sacred Katriosophia] (in Russian). Moscow: Belyy Ashram. p. 72. . Cited in Simanzhenkova (2006), p. 82. This syncretic idea is developed in all other Dushkova's writings, as well. = Hierarchy of the heart = Continuing the Theosophical tradition, Christ, according to the teaching, is one of the \\"cosmic hierarchs\\", who incarnate themselves on the Earth in order to help humanity. Dushkova develops Agni Yoga's fundamental idea of \\"cosmic hierarchy\\" by introducing the concept of the \\"hierarchy of the heart\\" that includes the \\"heart of infinity\\", the \\"heart of the planet\\", and the \\"heart of the human being\\". The latter is presented as a \\"small cell of the heart of infinity\\", serving as a connecting link between worlds and as the container of the \\"fire of love\\". Just as in Agni Yoga, the Great White Brotherhood in The Teaching of the Heart directs the evolution of humanity, preserving society from regression and decay. Essentially the brotherhood in Dushkova's teaching is the organizing and uniting principle which gives an impulse of high evolutionary frequency that maintains the stability of the social system and establishes the conditions for further improvement. = Fiery baptism = As in the Eastern tradition, Dushkova's teaching speaks of the one energy of the Cosmos, Nature, and human beings and relies on the Theosophical version of Cosmogenesis, in which the Absolute is seen as the primary fiery energy that during evolution turns into spirit and matter. According to the teaching, there are certain historical periods during which this energy, or \\"spatial fire\\", is intensified in order to influence the evolution of humanity, bringing matter into a more subtle state; Dushkova calls such periods \\"fiery baptism\\". The Teaching of the Heart says it is through the human heart that the evolutionary wave of these transformative fiery energies will pass at the end of the \\"great cycle\\", which coincides with present times. Therefore, according to Dushkova, the primary focus of attention should be shifted to the heart, because it is the \\"main transmuter\\" of these energies. = Optimistic future = The Teaching of the Heart explains that modern civilization has come to a dividing line in its development when all the quality parameters of life are to change. Since the human being is involved not only in processes occurring on the Earth, but also in the Cosmos as a whole, Dushkova calls upon people to coordinate their actions with global world processes and to recognize responsibility for every step in life, saying that humanity can proceed further only through love. Being social and optimistic in nature, the teaching rejects the dramatic concepts of the end of the world and promotes a more peaceful path to salvation, which occurs through a gradual familiarization with the \\"divine reality\\". Although natural disasters cannot be avoided, they are described as \\"natural ways of purification\\", providing the opportunity to establish \\"a new heaven and a new earth\\" to be inhabited by a transfigured humanity. = Messianism = According to The Teaching of the Heart, the periods of the greatest manifestation of the \\"spatial fire\\" are also connected with the beginning of a new \\"Messianic\\" cycle when Maitreya, the Lord of Shambhala, should arrive in order to unite humanity and to build together a new society after the purification of the Earth. = Mother of the World's era = Following the Theosophical tradition, the teaching shows that the coming era will be the era of the \\"Mother of the World\\". Dushkova presents woman and man as the two cosmic principles that are destined to acquire their equal rights and stand side by side as colleagues.  Reception  After its publication in 1998, The Teaching of the Heart rapidly gained readers in Russia and Ukraine, as well as in Kazakhstan and Moldova, marking the beginning of a movement which organized festivals of spiritual culture, exhibitions, musical evenings, and round tables for different types of activity: pedagogical, educational, and artistic. The first large-scale forum took place in Kyiv in 1999 and was held every year afterward in cities such as Cheboksary, Krasnoyarsk, Kemerovo, and Vladivostok. In August 2001, in Kemerovo, participants of this movement created Zvezda Vostoka (\\"Star of the East\\"), an interregional public organization for supporting science, culture, and art. It aimed \\"to unite all who advocate moral values, who contribute to the evolutionary development of society through cooperation in the domains of science, economics, education, and culture.\\" Later, branches of Zvezda Vostoka were opened in many cities of Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. Religious scholars regarded this organization as one of the three largest centers of Roerichism in Russia and Ukraine. The followers of The Teaching of the Heart believe that it, Helena Roerich's Agni Yoga, and Helena Blavatsky's The Secret Doctrine represent the three parts of the \\"one revelation\\" handed down to humankind by the \\"Masters of Wisdom\\". In 2005, Astafyev Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University published a book intended for teachers, parents, high school students, and professionals in the field of pedagogy and psychology, which recommended 77 Zhemchuzhin siyayushchikh na chetkakh Vremeni for use in education and used excerpts from The Teaching of the Heart and other Dushkova's books from the standpoint of a person's moral upbringing. In the same year, Auezov Semipalatinsk University in Kazakhstan published methodological recommendations on using the book and audiobook Skazki dlya Messii in secondary schools, orphanages, and other children's educational establishments. According to these recommendations, \\"The book is a significant phenomenon in the contemporary literary process, and in terms of the purity of its moral lessons it is comparable to The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry.\\" They also noted the highly psycho- corrective and psychotherapeutic effect of these fairy tales in comparison with others, because they are based on replacing a destructive style of behavior with a constructive one. In various cities of Russia and Ukraine, teachers and parents who used Skazki dlya Messii for reading in orphanages, boarding schools, detention centers, and classrooms noted the positive impact of the tales on the psycho-emotional state of children, especially those who were considered \\"difficult\\". Pankaj Malviya used Skazki dlya Messii in the process of teaching students at the Department of Russian Language of Punjab University in Chandigarh, India. The Japanese researcher of Russian fairy tales, Professor Yoshikazu Nakamura, included Skazki dlya Messii in a course for students of Russian language and literature at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo. After a competitive selection process in 2006 by the children's and educational publisher Nathan in Paris, Le Beau Soleil et autres contes (\\"The Red Sun and Other Fairy Tales\\"), the French edition of Skazki dlya Messii, was reviewed by the professional magazine for teachers Journal des Instituteurs et Professeurs des √©coles (JDI) with recommendations as to how to use the book in the educational process. By the decision of the competitive board, packages with 30 copies of the book each were sent to many schools of France. During the 2006‚Äì2007 academic year the teachers at these schools studied the psychological and pedagogical impact of the fairy tales on their students. In 2020, the British magazine Watkins Mind Body Spirit ranked Zinovia Dushkova as number 49 in its annual list of the \\"100 Most Spiritually Influential Living People\\".  Criticism  The Russian Orthodox Church categorically rejects the teachings of Blavatsky and the Roerichs. In 1994, the Council of Bishops declared that they were \\"incompatible with Christianity\\" and people who shared and promoted these teachings had \\"excommunicated themselves from the Orthodox Church\\". Patriarchate representatives at a 2004 Novosibirsk conference once again testified to the \\"antichristian and destructive nature\\" of various New Age teachings, including those of Helena Blavatsky, Helena Roerich, and Zinovia Dushkova. However, among the followers of the Roerichs' teachings, the publication of Bratstvo: Nadzemnaya Obitel' in 1997 also caused controversy as to whether it came from the same source as Agni Yoga. Thus, Lyudmila Shaposhnikova, the director of the International Center of the Roerichs (ICR) in Moscow, made disparaging remarks on the book and its author, stating that Bratstvo was given by the \\"dark forces\\" because no new teachings would be given \\"in the next 200 years, as well as in the future\\". Then the Council of the Siberian Roerich Society, which itself was the former branch of ICR, denounced Dushkova as a \\"false teacher\\". In response to these accusations, Dushkova's supporters quoted Helena Roerich's letters in which Roerich herself predicted the appearance of \\"Agni Yoga in new conditions\\" at the very end of the 20th century.  Exhibitions  In 2003, an exhibition entitled \\"Geography of Travels\\" was organized, at which 60 photographs as well as the author's videos were presented. They had been made during Dushkova's travels to places that are regarded as holy in countries such as Egypt, Israel, India, Italy, China, Mongolia, Tibet, France, and Japan. The exhibition was first displayed in Moscow, and then in other cities in Russia, Ukraine, and France. In 2009, Moscow hosted an international exhibition of children's drawings called \\"Create Your Fairy Tale\\", organized by Dushkova Publishing and the A.P. Bogolyubov Library of the Arts. The exhibition featured drawings based on Skazki dlya Messii by children from different cities in Russia and France. Awards and honours In 2015, Dushkova was awarded the \\"20 Years of Gagauzia\\" Medal which was established by Gagauzian People's Assembly. In 2017, The Call of the Heart, the first book of The Teaching of the Heart series, was awarded a silver medal by the Nautilus Book Awards in the United States.

It was written by Georg Thurmair in 1936. The melody was composed by Heinrich Neu√ü the same year. It was part of Thurmair's 1938 hymnal Kirchenlied, and it is part of regional sections of the Catholic hymnal Gotteslob (2013).  History  Georg Thurmair wrote the song \\"\\" in 1936. It was set to music the same year by Heinrich Neu√ü. The song, in four long stanzas, expresses thankfulness for the Creation. It was included in Thurmair's hymnal Kirchenlied in 1938. Its incipit is the header for the section of daytime songs. A collection of early poems by Thurmair was published with the hymn's beginning as the title. In the first common Catholic hymnal, the 1975 Gotteslob, the song was not part of the common section () but did appear in regional sections.Thomas Labont√©: Die Sammlung \\"Kirchenlied\\" (1938). Entstehung, Korpusanalyse, Rezeption. Francke Verlag, T√ºbingen 2008, , pp 196‚Äì209. In the 2013 edition, it was again omitted from the common section but included in several regional sections.  Theme  The beginning of the song uses a diary entry of the Romantic poet Joseph von Eichendorff who wrote on 14 September 1805, after travelling in the Harz mountains: \\"O Gott! wie sch√∂n ist deine Welt! riefen wir alle einm√ºtig aus im seligen Genusse und konnten nur mit M√ºhe unsere Blicke von der unerme√ülichen Weite ablenken.\\" (O God! How beautiful is Your World! we all exclaimed unanimously in blissful enjoyment, and could only with difficulty distract our eyes from the immeasurable vastness.) All stanzas end in the same line, which repeats the first line, adding even another exclamation \\"wie sch√∂n ist deine Welt\\". The four stanzas describe creatures, first plants (green forests, blooming meadows), sun and rushing clouds which are compared to the fast movement of life. In the second stanza, animals appear, also sun, moon and stars. In the third stanza, human beings are described as praising the shining creation. The final stanza is a prayer for support in times of thunderstorms.

He was named most valuable player of the league's first season.  Early life  Bang \\"JJonak\\" Sung-hyeon was raised in Seoul, South Korea. He recalled having a good relationship with his parents and wanting to pursue a professional gaming career from a young age. He pursued first-person shooter and fighting video games rather than schoolwork. While in high school, JJonak discovered Overwatch, the game which he would later play professionally, at a PC Bang. JJonak's name is based on the Korean phrase \\"Ï™ºÎ¨ºÎùΩÎÇôÏßÄ\\" (jjomullak nakji), which translates to \\"fumbling octopus\\". He modeled himself on professional Overwatch player Ryu \\"Ryujehong\\" Je-hong, by studying his playstyle, game settings, and choice of computing peripherals.  Career  = New York Excelsior =  2018 season: MVP season  JJonak professionally debuted with New York Excelsior in January 2018. The team found massive success, sitting at the no. 1 seed for most of the season. JJonak quickly became known for his skill with the hero Zenyatta, a hero in the support role who JJonak adopted a unique, very aggressive playstyle for often dealing as much damage on the hero as enemy damage players. Within two months, Kotaku described JJonak's play as the most valuable on the top-ranked team, with his Zenyatta skill having surpassed that of his role model Ryujehong. JJonak's Zenyatta playstyle was inimitable by other teams in the league's first season. While Zenyatta traditionally plays a support role on Overwatch teams, primarily healing and boosting allies and secondarily dealing damage, JJonak is known for using the character's high damage output. Zenyatta's two main abilities are orbs of harmony and discord, which can be assigned to other players to heal teammates and increase a damage multiplier on enemies, respectively. JJonak's skill with Zenyatta descends from his ability to predict enemy movements, aim with precision, and take risky moves, which altogether let him make long-distance sniper and trick shots better expected of players in damage-focused rather than support roles. For this reason, he often sidelines his team healing duties to prioritize damage. Support roles, such as those filled by Zenyatta, traditionally accompany a high-damage role as a bodyguard, but with JJonak's high-damage play, the New York Excelsior's other support player often would escort and boost JJonak. This nontraditional strategy contributed to the New York Excelsior's standout debut standings and the two support players' receiving the highest season rankings. JJonak was named the most valuable player of the league's first season by an extremely large margin, earning twice as many votes as the next closest player, Chan- Hyung ‚ÄúFissure‚Äù Baek of the LA Gladiators. For this, Blizzard created a special cosmetic skin for Zenyatta inspired by JJonak's background, which was made available for players to purchase during the 2019 Overwatch League season. JJonak competed on the Atlantic Division's starting roster in the Overwatch League All-Star Weekend.  International career  Bang competed for Team South Korea in the 2018 Overwatch World Cup. The team placed #1 seed in their qualifier round, winning every game. They competed against Russia, Finland, Japan, Hong Kong, and Chinese Taipei. They played in the finals at BlizzCon in Los Angeles against Australia, the United Kingdom and China, winning all matches and being crowned the Overwatch world cup champions for a third consecutive year. JJonak also won the most valuable player award for this tournament.

Margarete Berent (born July 9, 1887 in Berlin, died June 23, 1965 in New York), also known as Margareth Berent or Grete Berent in the United States, was the first woman lawyer in Prussia. She was the co-founder of the Association of Women Jurists and Association of German Women Academicians. As a Jew, she suffered from persecution during the Nazi Regime and fled via Switzerland, Italy, and Chile to the United States, where she finally arrived in 1940. After studying American law, she opened her second own law firm, now in the US, in 1951. Biography =Early life and education= Margarete Berent was the daughter of Max and Natalie Berent (n√©e Gabriel), a family with bourgeois background. Culture and education were of great value to the family; besides going to school, she had private language and music lessons. After graduating, she studied to be a teacher from 1903 to 1906, one of the few jobs considered suitable for women at that time. Afterwards she started to prepared to take the Abitur enabling her to study at a German university, while working as a teacher at her former school in Berlin at the same time. She visited courses offered by Helene Lange, a contemporary feminist. It was still not common for women to pass the Abitur and studying at universities in Germany in the 1890s. In October 1910, she passed the exam and was allowed to study law at the University of Berlin. Only about 0.2% of law students were women at her faculty. Although women were admitted to study and obtain a doctorate in Prussia, which Berlin was then part of, they were not allowed to pass the bar and work as lawyers. Hence, Margarete Berent moved to Erlangen in Bavaria in 1912, and finished her studies in 1913 with a study on the \\"Community of Goods for Married Partners\\" (\\"Die Zugewinngemeinschaft der Ehegatten\\"), which was implemented in the reformation of German inheritance laws in 1958. =Career in Germany= In order to obtain more practice after her studies, she worked as an assistant in several law offices in Berlin from 1914 on. Furthermore, she worked in advising women about their rights and joined the legal department of AEG. World War I helped her career in the sense that many of her male colleagues were drafted and women could step into new, now free positions. It still took until 1922 until women were admitted to the bar and in 1925, after passing exams now open to women, Margarete Berent became a lawyer. Together with Marie Munk, she belonged to the central legal experts in the feminist movement. She was especially involved in changing discriminatory laws about married women. She was an active member of several associations such as the Federation of German Women Associations (Bund Deutscher Frauenvereine), the League of German Female Lawyers (Deutscher Juristinnenbund), and in the International Organization of Women Lawyers. She belonged to the League of German Academic Women (Deutscher Akademikerinnen- Bund) and a professional club for women, the Soroptimist Club. She founded her own law firm as the first female lawyer in Berlin in 1925. Although there were also doubts and discrimination against women in law, her firm became a success quite quickly. =Years under the Nazi regime= On the 7 April 1933, the Nazi government released a new law that prohibited Jewish lawyers to work as such (Gesetz √ºber die Zulassung zur Rechtsanwaltschaft). Although having engaged in voluntary work and for benevolent causes already before, Margarete Berent now had to shift her professional activities a lot since she lost her law firm. Before 1933, she had mostly engaged in feminist, secular organizations - with the beginning of Nazi Gleichschaltung politics in 1933, many of those started to dissolve in order to avoid being controlled. With her keen interest in women's rights and legal expertise, she was of great importance for Jewish organizations. So in the summer 1933, she first started to work for the Central Committee for Jewish Economic Aid (Zentralstelle f√ºr j√ºdische Wirtschaftshilfe) in Berlin and later, in October 1933, she became the head of the Jewish Welfare association in the Rhine Province. Until 1938, she worked both in Cologne and in Berlin. She was especially responsible for coordination of assistance to small Jewish communities. In 1939, when the new Reich Association of Jews in Germany was founded as a means of controlling and discriminating against Jews (and those defined as such by the Nazi government), Margarete Berent became the head of the Rhine region in this new association, too. =Flight from Germany and new beginnings in the US= In 1939, when persecution of Jewish citizens became worse in Nazi Germany, Margarete Berent decided to flee. But her application for a visa to the U.S. was not granted. After receiving an interim visa for Chile, she left Germany via Switzerland and Italy. After her arrival in Chile, she had to wait for four months until she was admitted to travel to New York in 1940. Her start in New York City was quite hard for the now 53-year-old. She was not permitted to work as a lawyer, and had to earn a living in low-paying jobs, such as housekeeping. Until 1949, she worked during the day and studied law at the New York University in the evening. Finally in 1949, she finished her studies and was admitted to the bar. She opened her own law firm and worked for several years at the New York Legal Department. She still advised other emigrants voluntarily for years. It was only for a ten-day visit to Berlin in 1959 that she came back to Germany. The fact that her brother Hans and his family died during the Shoah is cited as a reason. Until a short, severe illness that finally led to her death at the age of 78 years, she went on working as a lawyer. She was a member of Congregation Habonim.

She was a mentor to folklorist and politician Rudolf Kriss.  Life  Marie Eysn was born in 1847 in Horn, Lower Austria, to the wealthy merchant Alois Eysn and his wife Anna Eysn. Her mother was a daughter of canvas dealer Florian Pollack and Margareta Bunzender from Linz. By 1860, the family had moved to Salzburg. Marie Eysn received private lessons and was also self-taught, especially in the field of botany. Here she was influenced by friendly relations with the family of the botanist Anton Kerner von Marilaun. In the area surrounding Salzburg she collected alpine plants and created a phanerogames herbarium. From 1887 to 1891 she supported Kerner von Marilaun in his work ‚ÄúSchedae ad floram exsiccatam Austro-Hungaricam‚Äù for which she provided more than 1,200 documents. She donated a collection of algae to the Salzburg Natural History Museum. In addition to the natural sciences, she was also interested in textiles and collected an important collection of lace. Another area of interest for Eysn was history, for example she was involved in the research of the archaeologist Matth√§us Much on Lake Mondsee in Upper Austria. In 1903, at the age of 56, Eysn married the geographer and ethnographer Richard Andree (with whom she lived in Munich until his death 22 February 1912.) In the same year, she converted from Roman Catholic to Protestant and changed the direction of her research, which now concentrated on evidence of popular piety. She collected votive and amulets and supported her husband in his writing titled \\"Votive and Ordinations of the Catholic People in Southern Germany\\" (1904). She conducted extensive ethnological studies and published her main work ‚ÄúFolklore from the Bavarian-Austrian Alpine Region‚Äù in 1910, which formed the basis for her recognition as the \\"founder of pilgrimage research.\\" In that year, she bequeathed a large part of the associated votive collection to the Berlin Folklore Museum (at that time it was the \\"Royal Collection for German Folklore in Berlin\\"). She was named an honorary member of the Museum Association in 1907. After World War I ended, Andree-Eysn became destitute for the first time as a result of inflation. To make a living, she sold parts of her collections to museums. Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria provided her with an apartment in the Villa Brandholzlehen in Berchtesgaden, Germany where she spent her retirement. In collaboration with her pupil and successor, the folklorist Rudolf Kriss, the basis for a religious folklore collection was created during this period, which later went to the Bavarian National Museum. In 1920 Andree-Eysn became an honorary member of the Folklore Association appointed in Vienna. She died in Berchtesgaden in 1929 at the age of 81 and was buried in her parents' grave in the Salzburg city cemetery after an evangelical cremation in Munich.

It was the main shock following its foreshock, a nearby 6.4 earthquake on 29 July. It was followed by a nearby 6.9 earthquake on 19 August 2018. The epicentre was located inland, near Loloan Village in North Lombok Regency. The fault rupture spread to the north and reached the sea, creating tsunamis. Severe shaking was reported throughout the entire island, while strong shaking was reported on the neighboring islands of Bali and Sumbawa. Widespread damage was reported in Lombok and Bali. Officials stated that at least 80% of structures in North Lombok were damaged or destroyed. In the aftermath of the sequence of earthquakes in August, a total of 563 people were confirmed killed while more than 1,000 were confirmed injured. More than 417,000 people were displaced. This earthquake is the largest and the strongest earthquake to have hit Lombok in recorded history. With more than 560 deaths, it is also the deadliest earthquake in the Lesser Sunda Islands since the 1992 Flores earthquake and tsunami. The earthquake later caused chains of earthquakes in West Nusa Tenggara with significant magnitude, which was deemed by officials as a rare event. Tectonic setting left Indonesia lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of significant volcanic and tectonic activity. In particular, the archipelago is located between the Eurasian, Pacific and Australian tectonic plates. The Australian plate subducts beneath the Sunda Plate at a year, forming the Sunda Trench. This activity caused the 9.2 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, one of the strongest and most deadly earthquakes in recorded history. Lombok in particular lies on the destructive plate boundary between the Australian Plate and the Sunda Plate. To the east of Bali, the plate boundary starts to involve a collision between the leading edge of the Australian continent and the eastern part of the Sunda Arc and the western end of the Banda Arc, also known as the Flores Back Arc Thrust Zone. The Sunda Arc has produced a large number of powerful and devastating earthquakes in the past, including the 1977 Sumba earthquake, 1994 Java earthquake and the 2006 Pangandaran earthquake and tsunami. In addition, the island also lies between two major geomagnetic anomalies of opposite signs. The Flores Back Arc Thrust system had in the past century produced at least 4 earthquakes stronger than 6.5: a 6.5 event in Bali to the west in 1976, alongside three events ( 6.5, 6.5, 6.6 in 2007 and 2009) in Sumbawa to the east. The North Lombok area, where the earthquake occurred, has a track record of earthquakes in the past. One 6.4 earthquake in 1979 killed 37 people, with a more recent 5.7 event in 2013 causing extensive damage but no deaths. Simulations by scientists from the University of Mataram suggested that an earthquake stronger than 6.0 could cause a small tsunami which would be in height, reaching Mataram within 18‚Äì20 minutes after the earthquake. Geologically, the rocks close to the epicenter are primarily Tertiary to Quaternary volcanic sediments, with pre-Tertiary to Tertiary sedimentary and metamorphic rock. These soft rocks are thought to have caused an increase in the intensity of the earthquake. Earthquake Map of 2018 Lombok earthquakes Shakemap for the August 2018 Lombok earthquake. Focal mechanism of the earthquake by the USGS. Ground shift due to the earthquake. The earthquake occurred on 19:46 local time, at a depth of (USGS) or (BMKG). Shaking was felt as far away as Sumbawa in the east and Trenggalek Regency in the west. Shaking was also felt in Pacitan Regency, East Java. The Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) stated that the epicentre of the earthquake was located inland, on the northeastern slopes of Mount Rinjani at . It initially measured the earthquake's intensity at 6.8, before revising it to 7.0. The United States Geological Survey initially measured the earthquake at 7.0, before revising it down to 6.9. It placed the epicenter at , somewhat north of the BMKG estimate. Caused by a shallow thrust fault on or near the Flores Back Arc Thrust, at which the Australia and Sunda plates underthrusts the Indonesian volcanic island arcs, the earthquake struck just a week after the magnitude 6.4 earthquake which had killed 20. According to BMKG, this earthquake was a foreshock to the 6.9 earthquake. Despite the earthquake, no increase in activity was recorded for the nearby volcanoes of Rinjani and Agung. At certain areas in the northwestern parts of the island, the earthquake caused the ground to rise by as much as . The earthquake interrupted a ministerial security council held in Mataram, which was attended by Indonesian ministers Yasonna Laoly and Wiranto, Australian minister Peter Dutton, New Zealand minister Andrew Little, and Singaporean minister K. Shanmugam. Immediately following the earthquake, many residents evacuated to local mosques in fear of aftershocks. Days following the earthquake, scientists from NASA and California Institute of Technology published a satellite image of the ground shift in Lombok. The image showed that the area in the earthquake's rupture had been lifted by 25 cm. Several portions of North Lombok were raised by 5‚Äì10 cm. The area which was located on the south of the rupture however had a decrease on its height, including Mount Rinjani which had lost 15 cm due to the earthquake. =Impact= As the earthquake occurred at a relatively shallow depth and a 7 magnitude, the earthquake caused severe shaking in the island of Lombok and strong shaking in the neighboring islands. Indonesian officials released maps of the perceived shaking. The largest city in Lombok and the provincial capital, Mataram, recorded a maximum intensity of VIII (Severe). The strongest shaking felt in the island of Bali was in Karangasem Regency with an intensity of VI (strong) while, on the island of Sumbawa, the strongest shaking was felt in Bima with a recorded maximum intensity of VI (strong). =Tsunami= Following the earthquake, a tsunami warning was issued by BMKG for the North coast of Lombok. With a maximum expected height of just 50 cm (20 in), the tsunami struck at three locations, the maximum of which was at in Carik, North Lombok, and the warning was removed later. However, the warning had caused panic as the residents attempted to evacuate to higher ground. In Gili Trawangan, residents and tourists were evacuated to the hills in expectation of a tsunami. In Gili Air and Gili Meno there is no hills so locals wait in expectation of a tsunami in the small islands open fields. = Aftershocks = By 18 August, the BMKG had reported as many as 664 aftershocks, most of which were below 5.9 magnitude. There were two major aftershocks. The first one occurred on 9 August at 13:25 local time. It struck the island of Lombok at a depth of 12 km and measured at 5.9 (USGS) or 6.2 (BMKG), and was felt as far away as East Java. Shaking was felt in the neighboring islands of Bali and Sumbawa and lasted for at least 10 seconds. Officials stated that the intensity of the shaking in Lombok was V-VI MMI (medium-strong). Panicked residents ran out to the streets. Dozens of buildings which had been badly damaged by the mainshock reportedly collapsed. Widespread damage was also reported in West Nusa Tenggara's provincial capital Mataram. There were also reports of landslides which buried at least 4 people in Gangga-Kayangan area, Rescue efforts were abruptly stopped due to the earthquake. Authorities confirmed that 24 people were injured and 6 were killed, including two volunteers from the Indonesian Red Cross, by the 9 August aftershock. The second one occurred on 18 August at 23:10 local time. The earthquake was measured at 6.3 (USGS) or 6.5 (BMKG). It struck at a depth of 7.9 km. 4 minutes earlier, a 5.4 magnitude earthquake had just struck Lombok. There were reports of landslides in Mount Rinjani. There were 2 deaths. Casualties As of 25 August 563 people had been confirmed killed by the 5 August and subsequent events. Most victims were killed by falling debris due to collapsed buildings. Deaths occurred in all regencies and cities on the island ‚Äî with most of the deaths being in North Lombok Regency. Of the 563 deaths in Lombok, 471 were in North Lombok, 45 in West Lombok (including 7 in the Gili Islands), 12 in Mataram, 26 in East Lombok and 2 in Central Lombok Regency. Officials confirmed that 2 people had been killed in Bali, both were in Denpasar while 58 people in Bali were injured. All killed by the earthquake were Indonesian citizens. Hundreds of people were injured, overloading the capacity of medical sites and forcing them to be treated outside. Tons of injuries were also reported in Karangasem Regency, the easternmost part of neighboring Bali. On 6 August at 07:45 local time, the regent of North Lombok Regency, Najmul Akhyar, confirmed on live television that the death toll had risen to more than 100, as reports from his districts revealed that at least 5 people had been killed in each district. At 10:00 a.m local time, the Head of Data, Information and Public Relations Center of BNPB, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said in a press conference that at least 91 people had been killed, all Indonesians, while 209 people were seriously wounded in the earthquake. Later that afternoon, Sutopo revised the death toll to 98 people as another 7 bodies were recovered from the West Lombok Regency while the number of injured was raised to 236. He added that the current death toll is not final and more information will come from the villages that are cut off by the earthquake. There were many reports of collapsed mosques in Lombok. As the earthquake struck during isha prayer, many people were trapped after the mosques they were in collapsed onto them. In Lading-Lading village, North Lombok Regency, more than 50 people were trapped inside the Jabal Nur Mosque, while some local residents stated that there were hundreds. Dozens of people were also reportedly trapped inside the Jamiul Jamaah Mosque in Karangtangsor Village. On 7 August, officials announced that they had rescued one worshipper from the rubble, who was found alive by the rescuers. Three bodies were also recovered during the search and rescue operation. On 8 August, the death toll was raised by the Indonesian National Disaster Management Board to 131 as more bodies were retrieved by rescue workers. Data assessment conducted by authorities revealed that more than 1,470 people had been seriously wounded and more than 165,000 people had been displaced by the earthquake. He added that there were still some areas that couldn't be reached by rescuers. On 18 August 469 people were confirmed dead. Authorities, however, warned that the death toll may rise. On 25 August, the Indonesian Ministry of Social Affairs confirmed that 565 people had been killed by all of the August tremors. Damage Widespread damage was reported in Lombok Island. Officials stated that structures in North Lombok Regency, in which the epicentre of the earthquake was located, reportedly suffered the greatest damage. Telecommunications went down and blackouts were reported throughout Lombok. Thousands of houses were damaged, many of which had already been struck by the foreshock. A lack of construction regulations and technical knowledge of builders regarding earthquake resistance, coupled with low economic ability, exacerbated the damage. At least three bridges reportedly had collapsed in Lombok. Immediately after the earthquake, most of Mataram lost electrical power. Although some parts of Lombok still received electricity, the load was only 50 MW compared to the normal 220 MW. Streets were jammed across Lombok as traffic lights were unusable and roads were blocked by debris. The Indonesian National Electricity Company (PLN) stated that electricity had been restored in major parts of Lombok hours after the quake, even though around 25% of the area in Lombok hadn't been restored. In Gili Trawangan, severe damage was reported to the island's cafes and resorts. As multiple convenience stores were abandoned by their owners, cases of looting were widely reported across the island. Significant damage was widely reported in Bali. In Kuta, wall collapses were reported in two department stores. Several temples were also damaged by the quake. The ceiling of Ngurah Rai International Airport was damaged although the airport remained operational. Terminal facilities of the Lombok International Airport were also slightly damaged, but the runway, taxiway and apron were undamaged and remained operational. Bali ‚Äì Lombok ferry services, however, were temporarily terminated. Ferry services returned to normal operation on 6 August. On 6 August, during a press conference, Sutopo stated that a preliminary report suggests that more than 50% of structures in North Lombok Regency had been devastated by the earthquake. West Nusa Tenggara Governor Muhammad Zainul Majdi later stated that more than 80% of structures in North Lombok Regency had either been damaged or destroyed. Preliminary analysis conducted by the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management showed that the earthquake managed to inflict more than 5 trillion rupiah (US$341 million) in damage. This total damage was also added by the damage that had been inflicted by the foreshock, which had caused a total damage of Rp 414 billion. The figure was revised to 8.8 trillion rupiah (~USD 600 million) by late August. On 8 August, it was announced that 42,239 houses and 458 schools had been either damaged or destroyed by the earthquake. Aftermath =Refugees= Following the earthquake, some local residents especially in North Lombok setup makeshift camps to accommodate those displaced by the damage. The refugees reported a lack of blankets, tents and foodstuffs. Non-perishable food items such as instant noodles and bread were reportedly out of stock as residents stockpiled food. In order to supply the refugees with clean water, the Indonesian government drilled wells for groundwater. BNPB estimated that over 165,000 people had been displaced due to the earthquake, out of the island's population of around 3 million. By 11 August, the total figure has been raised to over 387,000. The provincial capital Mataram recorded 20,343 displaced people, with the West and East Lombok regencies recording 91,372 and 76,506 refugees respectively. The hardest-hit part of North Lombok reported 198,846 people in refugee camps ‚Äì from a population of about 215,000. =Response= Indonesian President Joko Widodo immediately phoned the Governor of West Nusa Tenggara, Muhammad Zainul Majdi, and ordered him to observe the situation in Lombok. He later extended his condolences to the affected. During a press conference in East Jakarta, he ordered airliners and officials to add flights and assistance for tourists who were leaving from Lombok due to the earthquake. In response to this, Lombok International Airport operated for 24 hours until 9 August. Director of Angkasa Pura I Faik Fahmi stated that extra flights will be added in Lombok. The Governor of West Nusa Tenggara, Muhammad Zainul Majdi, who had just attended a ministerial meeting in Lombok, immediately visited the survivors of the quake in Lombok and decided to extend the state of emergency and to dismiss staff and students from every school in Lombok. As more casualties were brought in, he urged Indonesians to donate blood as there were fears on decreasing bloodstock. Multiple regional governments sent logistics and aid to the impacted areas. The regional government of West Sumatra sent 1 ton of rendang to the affected families. The Acehnese government held a fundraising for the victims, later stated that a total of 300 million rupiah had been collected, while the government of West Java sent a total fund of 3.5 million rupiah to the affected families.

From 1793 until death he was King's Chaplain in Scotland. Life He was born on 9 March 1740 in the manse at Hawick in the Scottish Borders the son of Janet Grierson and her husband, Rev William Somerville (d.1757). He was educated in Hawick Parish School. On the death of his father he and his two sisters were left in the care of a family friend, Mr Cranstoun of Ancrum. He then studied divinity at the University of Edinburgh. He was licensed to preach by the Church of Scotland in 1764.A Minister of Jedburgh 1773 to 1830, Rev Thomas Somerville DD by W Wells Mabon 1905 In Edinburgh he fell from his horse near the house of Rev Bain, minister of the Relief Church and spent months living there recovering. He had an aversion to horses for the rest of his life. He did not get a post as a minister immediately and whilst awaiting a church acted as tutor to the children of Sir Gilbert Elliot, 3rd Baronet, of Minto, later Governor General of India. In 1767 Sir Gilbert appointed him minister of the local parish church at Minto, probably on the death of the previous minister. In 1772 he transferred from Minto to Jedburgh and remained there for the rest of his life. In May 1787 Somerville met the poet Robert Burns during his stay in Jedburgh. Burns complained that Somerville was \\"sadly addicted to punning\\". Somerville claimed that Burns presented him with a gold-topped cane during his visit. This is unlikely, and although Somerville owned a gold-topped cane it was likely self-bought. The University of St Andrews awarded him an honorary doctorate (DD) in 1789. In 1793 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Andrew Dalzell, James Hutton, and Rev John Hill. He died following a short illness in the manse at Jedburgh on 16 May 1830 aged 90. He is buried in the grounds of Jedburgh Abbey within the Lady Chapel.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/77193513/thomas-somerville Family In 1770 he married Martha Charters (d.1809).

In philosophy, the Canberra Plan is a contemporary program of methodology and analysis that answers questions about what the world is like according to physics. It is considered a naturalistic approach in metaphysics, which holds that metaphysics can explain the features of the world described by physics and what the different classes of everyday belief represent. A more detailed description of the plan refers to it as a family of doctrines that are grounded on a physicalist worldview as well as a priori philosophizing to explain our thoughts about our world as revealed by physics. The Canberra Plan arose in the 1990s at the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia. Its originators were David Lewis and Frank Jackson. An important question that it raises concerns what to say once \\"it turns out that there is nothing of which the a priori theory is true.\\" There are those who say that the Canberra Plan could prove insufficient and inconsistent to effectively pick out a feature of or relationship in the world.

The building was constructed in 1912 as a permanent home for the State Bank of Ladysmith. The two-story granite-faced building has a Neoclassical design. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The State Bank of Ladysmith was established in 1903, shortly after a new lumber mill brought population and economic growth to Ladysmith. In 1912, the bank, wanting a permanent home, had a two-story building constructed. The bank operated on the first floor of the building and rented the second floor as office space; while it originally housed two lumber companies, most of the second floor's occupants through the years were attorneys and doctors. Upon its opening, the new building was praised by local newspapers, with the Ladysmith News-Budget calling it \\"the finest business structure in the city, with no exception.\\" After the State Bank closed, the Pioneer Bank occupied the building from 1927 to 1964. Accompanied by photos The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 17, 1980. Architecture The W.E. Maddux contractors designed the Neoclassical building. The two street-facing sides of the building are faced with ashlar-cut red granite, which was quarried at Lohrville but cut at the construction site because of a quarry strike. A portico surrounds the front entrance, with two polished granite columns on either side and dentillation and a balcony on top. The portico originally included a carved panel above the door as well, though it has since been removed. The building's cornice is also dentillated, and a parapet runs along the street-facing sides of the roof.
