Publication history Grell originally created Starslayer for DC Comics, but plans to publish it were halted after the mass cancellation of titles known as the DC Implosion. Instead, he offered it to Pacific Comics, who released it as a six issue series in 1982. It was originally intended as an ongoing series per Pacific Comics's publisher Bill Schanes but Grell's developing relationship with the new First Comics and previous working relationship with their editorial director Mike Gold (who had been Grell's editor at DC) swayed him to release future issues with First. In August 1983 First Comics continued the series, starting with issue #7, with Grell writing and providing breakdown art with finishes by Lenin Delsol. Grell left the series after issue #8, and was replaced by writer John Ostrander and Delsol as sole artist. Later contributors to the series were Tim Truman, Hilary Barta, and Tom Sutton. The final issue, #34, came out November 1985. Issues 2 & 3 saw the introduction of Dave Stevens' Rocketeer as a back-up feature. In issue #10, the character Grimjack was introduced in the same fashion; he would later receive his own title. Another character that appeared as backup feature was Groo the Wanderer, who also later received his own title at Pacific. In 1995 Grell released an expanded version of the original limited series through Acclaim Comics. The expanded version, titled Starslayer: The Director's Cut, ran for eight issues. Series overview The first six issue limited series introduces the main character Torin Mac Quillon, a Celtic warrior from the time of the Roman Empire. Just before he is killed while fighting a group of Roman soldiers, he is pulled into the distant future by Tamara, a descendant of his wife after she remarried. Torin is asked to join the crew of the spaceship Jolly Roger in their fight against the oppressive regime that is ruling the Earth. Torin agrees, and he and his new shipmates successfully save the Earth's dying sun by the end of the first series. When First Comics restarted the series, Torin and his crewmates travel throughout the galaxy and end up in Cynosure, the nexus of all realities for First Comics, and gain a crew of pirates. At some point Torin travels back to the solar system with a device that can cause a star to implode into a black hole. He uses this weapon on the sun in the course of battle to destroy his enemies. Just at the point of implosion Torin speaks the name of the Celtic goddess of death, Morrigan, effectively sacrificing the star to her, which brings her back into existence. She proclaims Torin to be her avatar and orders him to go into the galaxy and kill in her name. Torin rebels, which is the basis of the remainder of the title's run.

The highway passes through farmland, residential and commercial properties. The northernmost community along the highway is Simonton Lake at the Michigan state line. SR 19 was first designated as US 112 in 1926. SR 19 replaced the original SR 21 designation of the highway which dated back to 1926. SR 21 ran from the Marion to Peru. SR 19 was extended over the years south to Noblesville. Route description SR 19 begins at an intersection with SR 32 and SR 38, in Noblesville.

Only one segment of State Road 19 is included in the National Highway System (NHS), this is the segment that is concurrent with U.S. Route 35 and SR 22. The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The highway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) like all other state roads in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that the lowest traffic levels were 780 vehicles and 170 commercial vehicles used the highway daily between Etna Green and County Road 900 North in Kosciusko County. The peak traffic volumes were 21,860 vehicles and 3,190 commercial vehicles AADT along the section of SR 19 concurrent with Cassopolis Street in Elkhart. History The route that SR 19 takes today was first signed in 1918 as SR 51 and went from SR 2 in Elkhart to the Michigan state line. This section was renumber in 1926 to U.S. Route 112. In 1928, SR 19 was first signed from Nappanee to Elkhart and the route from SR 18 to Peru was signed as SR 21. SR 19 was extended to Peru from Nappanee in 1931 and from Noblesville to Cicero in 1932. In 1934 the section from Elkhart to the Michigan state line was renumber as U.S. Route 112S. Until 2008, State Road 19 had existed in two sections. The southern section ended at State Road 22 east of Kokomo; the highway picked up again at State Road 18 south of Amboy.

He first appeared in the episode Lisa's First Day on the Farm (September 22, 1965). Overview Mr. Haney, the downright low down salesman portrayed by veteran character actor and longtime Western film sidekick Pat Buttram with the distinctive, warbling voice, sold his family's ancient, dilapidated farm to Oliver when he and Lisa Douglas left New York City for rural Hooterville and their new life as farmers. In the process of the sale, Haney stripped the farm of everything of value down to the plumbing. Haney had cheated the Douglases by charging them several times what the property was worth and saddling them with a dysfunctional farm. He continued to cheat them by initially selling the movable property associated with the farm to them, one piece at a time. Douglas bought Haney's cow, tractor and plow, all of which were as useless as the farm. He sometimes put the word \\"genuine\\" in front of an object he was trying to sell. He continued to come back with his farm truck converted into a peddler's truck (a 1924-25 Dodge Brothers truck, part of a running joke that everything in Hootersville was at least 30 to 50 years out-of-date). The truck would be stocked with worthless versions of items that Oliver needed. He almost invariably succeeded in unloading the items on Oliver at inflated prices despite his past shady dealings with them. He often took a piece of junk and called it by some outlandish name, suggesting that it has some use that it clearly does not and that it's in some way valuable. Haney would often turn up in his truck at the Douglas farm, minutes after they've realized they needed something, selling exactly that (even if it were very odd), complete with a pull-down sign on his truck advertising it. If turned down by Douglas, Haney would offer a variety of equally useless alternatives. Mr. Haney, ever the glib and creative speaker, was once asked by Mr. Douglas, \\"How come you always show up with exactly what I need?\\", to which he replied, \\"Well let me put it to you another way -- how come you always need what I show up with?\\". In one episode, Haney's \\"Grabwell\\" washer, basically a barrel with an outboard motor in it, wrecks the Ziffels' house. Oliver successfully sues Haney. But Haney, of course, profits because the sale he holds to raise money to pay the settlement brings him in more than if he had peddled the stuff in his normal fashion. Further, Lisa buys some of it. In another episode, Haney examines what he believes is a dead cow (actually a plastic promotional item that fell off a meat truck), hoping to parlay the find into a profit, and refers to it as the “corpus delicious”. In another episode Haney had what seemed to be an entire company in the back of his truck. One person comes out to speak to him. He then yells into the door for everyone to take lunch, and it sounds as if several dozen employees are contained in the small area. Haney was married in the series and often talked about his wife. However, in an episode, Haney and Joe Carson from Petticoat Junction compete to see who will date Lisa's mother, the Countess. As this doesn't bother Lisa and Oliver, we can assume Haney's wife was no longer in the picture by that time. One notable instance Haney failed is when he tried to promote an artificial milk making machine, only to find out that not only were the chemicals so expensive that milk prices would be unaffordable, but the \\"milk\\" caused baldness as well. Mr. Haney would cross over to Petticoat Junction including once as a Realtor for the recently wedded Betty Jo Bradley.

Bryant and May adopted the brand name Redheads in 1946, and it is still the most popular match in the country, although now manufactured in Sweden. Bryant and May are also notable for operating as a model factory, providing workers with conditions and amenities which even today seem generous. These included a dining hall and sports facilities such as a tennis court and bowling green which were constructed in the 1920s. Bryant and May ceased Australian match manufacture in the early 1980s as a result of import competition. Their iconic Redheads matches are now imported from Sweden. The complex has since been converted for use as offices and showrooms but is extremely well preserved. It is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. The Bryant and May complex at 560 Church Street, Richmond, comprises a series of factory buildings, dominated by a major freestanding redbrick 3-4 storey building, complete with clock tower, running back from the Church Street frontage. This is visible from some distance on three sides across local streets and carparks, and from the nearby elevated rail lines. The front 3/4 of the building running back from Church Street was the first built, in 1909, designed by prolific Melbourne architect William Pitt. It is a typically Melbourne Edwardian design, in bold red brick with cement dressings, with bays defined by red brick piers which are carried through the rendered balustrade, creating a long rhythmic facade on the south side. The front facade features finer piers, spandrels with Art Nouveau foliated decoration, a large entry arch, the lettering B & M above, topped by an unusual pierced arched pediment. Bryant & May Factory, from Church Street, Richmond Other smaller buildings were added across a small lane on the north side in 1910 and 1917 in a matching style. A large addition was made to the rear (west) of the building in 1921-22, designed by Klingender & Hamilton, in matching red brick but in a Stripped Classical style. This addition has an extra floor, with prominent signage, and a clock tower on the north side and the clock face bears the name BRYANT AND MAY in place of numbers. A new chimney stack, boiler house, offices and Brymay Hall, also designed by Klingender & Hamilton, were also added at this time.

(today Leonardo), active in the defence sector, with factories in Brescia and La Spezia. The Mod 56 pack howitzer, in service throughout the world, and the 76mm naval gun, adopted by 53 navies and installed on over 1,000 naval vessels, are among OTO Melara's best-known weapons since World War II. From 1 January 2016, the activities of OTO Melara merged into Leonardo-Finmeccanica's Defence Systems Division, within the Electronics, Defence and Security Systems Sector. History=Pre–World War I It was founded in 1905 as a joint venture of Vickers and Terni Steelworks, Cantiere navale fratelli Orlando and Cantieri navali Odero. Investment was also provided by Giuseppe Orlando and Attilio Odero. During World War I, Vickers Terni produced many weapons with calibre 40 mm and upwards. In 1929 the company was renamed Odero Terni Orlando with the abbreviation OTO. During World War II, mostly heavy guns for battleships were produced. Post–World War II In 1953 the company took the name OTO Melara. Before Italy joined NATO, OTO Melara produced civil products, like tractors and looms, but quickly returned to the production of weapons.

","title":"OTO Melara"},{"id":"1884007","text":"Timothy Truman (born February 9, 1956) is an American writer, artist and musician. He is best known for his stories and Wild West-style comic book art, and in particular, for his work on Grimjack (with John Ostrander), Scout, and the reinvention of Jonah Hex, with Joe R. Lansdale. Biography Truman was born in 1956 in Gauley Bridge, West Virginia.Miller, Donald (January 23, 1996). \\"Frontier Roundtable\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, p. B9. After graduating from Gauley Bridge High School in 1974, he attended the Columbus College of Art and Design while also attending West Virginia University. From 1979 to 1981 he attended The Kubert School in New Jersey.Fox, Margalit (August 23, 2012). \\"Joe Kubert Sept. 18, 1926 – Aug. 12, 2012: Comic-book artist explored war and violence\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, p. D5. He currently lives in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and was an instructor at the Pennsylvania College of Art and Design from 2003 to 2006. Roleplaying games After graduation, he moved to New York City and worked in the fantasy role-playing game industry for a few years providing illustrations for various companies, including working for TSR, Inc. as a staff illustrator. With Flint Henry, Truman co- authored Rifts Dimension Book 1: Wormwood (1993), which was critically acclaimed for its vibrant backgrounds. In 2015, Truman contributed, among other artists, to bring inner illustrations to the tabletop role-playing game Conan: Adventures in an Age Undreamed Of, first published in 2016 by British company Modiphius Entertainment. Comics Truman's first professional comics work was a series of backup stories in DC Comics' Sgt. Rock title published from 1981 to 1983. and His first major work was Grimjack with writer John Ostrander,Kapalka, Jeff (March 13, 2005). \\"Second-string heroes get second chance\\", The Post-Standard, p. 27. for the independent comics company First Comics. Grimjack first appeared in Starslayer #10 (November 1983), before moving to his own series after issue #18 (July 1984), and continued for 81 issues. In 1985, he created Scout, which was followed by Scout: War Shaman, a futuristic western. A year later, he relaunched the Hillman characters Airboy and The Heap for Eclipse Comics. He also developed The Prowler, a Shadow type character, and adapted The Spider for Eclipse. At DC Comics he created Hawkworld, a reinvention of Hawkman in 1989. An ongoing series with the same name was launched the following year.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 247: \\"In June [1990], Timothy Truman's Hawkworld was expanded into an ongoing series, featuring the scripts of John Ostrander and the art of Graham Nolan.\\" With author Joe R. Lansdale, he reinterpreted Jonah Hex as a horror western. In it, their creation of villain Edgar Autumn elicited a lawsuit from musician Edgar Winter. Truman was chosen by Dark Horse Comics to illustrate a newly completed Tarzan novel and wrote a story arc for the comic book. He also wrote nearly the entire run of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter for Valiant Comics. For the defunct science fiction imprint of DC, Helix, he created The Black Lamb. He also worked on a typical pulp adventure Guns of the Dragon, featuring Enemy Ace and Bat Lash and scripted a Creature Commandos limited series.Cowsill, Alan \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 295: \\"The Creature Commandos returned to service thanks to writer Timothy Truman and artist Scot Eaton.\\" At Dark Horse Comics, he wrote Star Wars, Conan, and Conan The Cimmerian. West Virginia Truman's work, Wilderness: The True Story of Simon Girty, Renegade was a two-volume black and white graphic novel depicting the American settler's western frontier. Tecumseh! a graphic novel based on the West Virginia Outdoor Theater, is a colored graphic novel that shows the play from beginning to end. It renewed interest in the warrior in Appalachia. Music A longtime fan and musician, Truman has integrated his love of music into comics and illustration. While working for Eclipse Comics, Truman included a Flexi disc recording inside Scout #19 (May 1987) that provided a soundtrack to one of the scenes in the comic. He also released an album through Eclipse Records with his band The Dixie Pistols entitled Marauder. The album included a short comic book featuring the wedding of Emanuel Santanna that took place between the first series Scout and the second series Scout: War Shaman. While writing the biography of one of his favorite guitarists, Carlos Santana, for Rock-It Comics, Truman found out that the musician had been a longtime fan of his comic, Scout, whose main character, Emanuel Santanna, is the namesake of the famous guitarist. Naming the characters after favorite musicians was a common convention that Truman used throughout the Scout series. Truman has also had a long relationship with the band the Grateful Dead creating artwork for CD covers, tour posters, limited-edition T-shirts and a color comics page in each issue of the Grateful Dead Almanac. Truman built a recording studio in his home and while producing recording sessions for Cherokee singer/songwriter Terry Strongheart, they decided to form a new band with some of Truman's friends and Strongheart's daughter called the Terry Strongheart Band. Two CDs have been recorded, the first entitled Tears and the follow-up Indian School. Truman provided illustrations for the posthumous Rory Gallagher release Kickback City (2013).(November 24, 2013). \\"Rebus author in tribute to legend Rory\\", Belfast Telegraph, p. 33. Truman said he first heard Gallagher's music in 1973 while a junior in high school.Dex, Robert (September 11, 2013). \\"Rankin writes novella inspired by icon Rory's music \\", Irish Independent, p. 2. Timothy Truman is often confused with the music composer Tim TrumanScout: War Shaman #14 (June 1989), where the letters page shows several examples of this who wrote the theme to Melrose Place and composed the score to Miami Vice's final season among other important contributions to the music industry in movies and television.

Early life A son of American bestselling writer Danielle Steel, Traina was given the last name of his adoptive father, John Traina, a cruise line executive. He was raised in San Francisco where he attended Town School. Traina's biological father was Steel's third husband, William George Toth, a convicted burglar and former heroin addict. Music career Traina started his first band, Shanker, at age 13 with Max Leavitt. He joined Link 80 at age 16 and played with them for three years, touring extensively. After leaving Link 80 in August 1997, Traina formed a new band called Knowledge and recorded a demo with them that has since been released on Asian Man Records. A song titled \\"Gnat\\" was included on the release; the song was recorded years earlier with Leavitt, who died on June 3, 2009. Death Due to the many problems Traina exhibited from childhood, his life included a number of psychiatric hospitalizations for drug abuse and for treatment of bipolar disorder. While his mother tried to get him the proper medical help, Traina died at 19, from a self-administered lithium overdose at the home of a friend, Julie Campbell. Traina was interred in Cypress Lawn Memorial Park cemetery in Colma, California. A handful of songs have been written for Traina, including All Bets Off's \\"Catharsis\\" by best friend Sammy Winston, Link 80's \\"Unbroken\\" by former bandmate Matt Bettinelli- Olpin, and \\"Hey, Nick!\\" by the White Trash Debutantes. On May 16, 1998, Steel hosted a memorial show for Traina at Slim's in San Francisco, featuring Link 80, MU330, the Bruce Lee Band, Powerhouse, the Hoods, Subincision, All Bets Off and the Blast Bandits. In 1998, Steel released her book titled His Bright Light which was about Nick's life and death along with his struggles with mental illness and drugs. Proceeds of the book, which reached the New York Times Non-Fiction Bestseller List, were used to found the Nick Traina Foundation, which Steel runs, to fund organizations dedicated to treating mental illness. In June 2016, Link 80 reunited for two reunion shows and released a five-minute tribute video featuring footage and images of Traina accompanied by the Social Distortion song \\"When the Angels Sing,\\" which was played before the shows.

She presented her own daily early morning radio show, The Dawn Patrol, on BBC Radio 2 from 1993 to 2010. In the Queen's Birthday Honours 2005 Kennedy was appointed as a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for services to broadcasting. Personal life Sarah Kennedy was born in Sussex, being raised in East Grinstead, the daughter of a stockbroker and a nurse. She studied for two years at drama school, becoming a drama teacher. She was a matron at Copthorne Prep School. In her twenties, she married a member of the armed forces. She has a partner, Adrian McGlynn, a director of Weatherbys, to whom she refers as her \\"much beloved\\". He became a popular character in the show. They met at the wedding of Desmond Morris's son, where McGlynn was best man. They reside in Northamptonshire although Kennedy has an apartment in a converted school building in London. Career history Kennedy began her career with the British Forces Broadcasting Service in Singapore in 1973, before moving to BBC Radio 2 in 1977, initially as a newsreader and continuity announcer. She was on duty for the station's final closedown before it moved to 24-hour broadcasting in January 1979. She continued to present music shows on Radio 2, including holiday cover for Family Favourites until 1983, mainly appearing on 'String Sound' featuring the BBC Radio Orchestra. She was also president of the hospital radio station known as \\"Radio Horton\\", based in the Horton Hospital, Oxfordshire. Kennedy's first on-screen job was reading the news on Southern Television's Day by Day. She came to prominence in TV as one of the hosts of the ITV light entertainment show Game for a Laugh from 1981 to 1984. She was also one of the team involved with the short-lived BBC current affairs programme 60 Minutes, which ran from 1983 to 1984, and was the main presenter of the ITV game show Busman's Holiday for several series in the 1980s. She also co-hosted The Animals Roadshow and Animal Country with zoologist Desmond Morris in the late 1980s and 1991 respectively. Kennedy returned to Radio 2, to present the weekday early morning show, called The Dawn Patrol, which ran between 4 January 1993 and 13 August 2010. It was originally broadcast from 5am to 7am, during 1993, but moved the following year to the time-slot of 6am to 7:30am, where it remained until 8 January 2010. In 1995, Kennedy received a prestigious Sony Gold Radio Award. She had a regular audience of around 4.5 million listeners on Radio 2. Due to Terry Wogan's retirement from his breakfast show in December 2009 and the ambitions of his successor Chris Evans, the morning radio schedule was changed, and Kennedy's show was moved earlier to its original 5am to 7am slot to accommodate a longer Evans show, starting 11 January 2010. It was then announced on 3 September that year that she was to leave the show. She had been absent for several weeks beforehand and would not return to the show before Evans' show was further extended in October. The programme was presented during this time by Lynn Parsons & Aled Jones and on 17 January 2011, Vanessa Feltz took over the show's slot, which now occupies a slot between 05:00am and 06:30am. Kennedy has also published a novel, Charlotte's Friends, as well as two collections of listeners' tales, called Terrible Twos (two editions) and Terrible Pets. Characteristics and mannerisms Kennedy;s reworking of English words was a distinctive element of the show. She changed names as follows: \\"The Eaglingtons\\" (The Eagles), \\"The Kinkingtons\\" (The Kinks), \\"Sainsbugs\\" (Sainsbury's), \\"Colleag-wees\\" (colleagues), \\"supermercado\\" (supermarkets as in Spain), \\"breasticles\\"/\\"chesticles\\" (breasts), Chancellor of the Exchequingtons etc. She frequently read out the expression \\"SW's to you\\" from listeners who wrote in. \\"SWs\\" was shorthand for \\"Love the show\\" (as in the often-used phrase by Steve Wright on his programmes, hence the use of his initials). Many listeners wrote in to ask what \\"SWs\\" actually meant, but she rarely explained it. Kennedy was also said to have been the first person to use the term 'white van man' in 1997. \\"Bunty Bagshaw\\" was an eccentric alter-ego she adopted. Career incidents and controversies Kennedy has sometimes suffered with her health, and has had to take time off work. Her slurred speech throughout her show on 13 August 2007 gained media attention, but the presenter blamed a sore throat. She presented the following day's show as normal, before taking a month-long break, leaving the show to be presented by colleagues Pete Mitchell, Alex Lester, Aled Jones and Richard Allinson. It was later reported that Kennedy was recovering from pneumonia. She returned to work on 10 September 2007. She also attracted concern after a bizarre performance while standing in for Terry Wogan on the breakfast show in May 1999. This included calling Ken Bruce an \\"old fool\\" and referring to the presenter of the day's \\"Pause For Thought\\" slot as \\"an old prune\\". She blamed the incident on a lack of sleep the previous night and apologised to listeners. She had been due to stand in for Wogan the following week, but took time off instead, and Bruce took her place. In October 2007, she was reprimanded after joking (in a segment about the importance of wearing visible clothing in winter road conditions) that she had almost run over a black pedestrian because she couldn't see him in the dark. The BBC later apologised for the comment. She has previously opined that black men dominate athletics because they are accustomed to being pursued by lions. She was also \\"spoken to\\" by BBC bosses after she praised Enoch Powell during a show in July 2009, describing Powell as \\"the best Prime Minister this country never had\\". In May 2014, Kennedy was banned from driving for 22 months for drunk driving. She had crashed into a stationary car. Exit from Radio 2 Kennedy had presented The Dawn Patrol since 4 January 1993. Due to Terry Wogan's departure from the main breakfast show in December 2009, and the ambitions of his successor Chris Evans, Kennedy's show moved from 6–7:30am, where it had been since January 1994 to its original 1993 slot between 5 and 7am, from 11 January 2010. Many listeners then became concerned that the 5am starts were starting to affect aspects of Kennedy's health and her absences became more frequent. Kennedy presented the show for the final time on Friday 13 August 2010, after which she took three weeks off work. Lynn Parsons took over the show in her absence. During this time, rumours began to circulate that she would not return. On 3 September, it was announced that she was to leave the station. Sarah Kennedy, in a Daily Telegraph interview published later in the month, claimed she had been forced out by an \\"enemy\\" at the BBC and denied having a drinking problem.Neil Midgley \\"Sarah Kennedy: 'I was never, never, never drunk on Radio 2'\\", Daily Telegraph, 21 September 2010 On 17 January 2011, Vanessa Feltz took over the Early Breakfast show, which she continues to present between 5 and 6:30am.

As a state trunkline, M-247 runs north from M-13 before turning to access the park, a distance of . The highway carries just over 6,000 vehicles a day on average. The roadway has been part of the state trunkline highway system since the 1920s, and from 1961 until 1998, it was the highest non- Interstate highway in the state. Before it was given the M-247 designation, the roadway has been a part of M-111 and M-47. Route description Starting at its southern terminus at M-13, M-247 follows Euclid Avenue north about , crossing the Kawkawlin River. When it meets Beaver Road, M-247 turns east leading directly into the state park and ends at its entrance. The entire roadway passes through suburban Bay City near the Saginaw Bay. None of the highway is listed on the National Highway System, a system of regionally important highways. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) measures the traffic volumes on its highways using a calculation called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This value is an expression of the number of vehicles that use a section of roadway on any average day of the year. When the department surveyed M-247 in 2009, the southernmost section near M-13 carried 6,135 vehicles; the remainder carried 6,224 vehicles. As a subset of these figures, 190 commercial vehicles used the trunkline on average. This was an overall increase from 2008 when the sections carried 5,031 and 5,573 vehicles respectively, but a decrease from the 214 commercial vehicles. History By 1929, the first highway designation along the current M-247 was assigned. That first number was M-111, which lasted until 1937 when all of M-111 became part of M-47. In early 1961, the roadway changed numbers once more. This time M-47 was realigned to a former section of US Highway 10 (US 10), and the connection to the state park was assigned the M-247 designation. This was the highest highway number in the state, excluding Interstates, until the 1998 designation of M-553 in the Upper Peninsula.

He appeared in 98 episodes (95 episodes of Law & Order and three episodes of Homicide: Life on the Street). He also appeared in Exiled: A Law & Order Movie. Character overview Curtis is introduced as a homicide detective in the New York Police Department, the junior partner of Lennie Briscoe (Jerry Orbach) in Manhattan's 27th Precinct Detective Squad. In contrast with his wilder predecessor, Mike Logan (Chris Noth), Curtis -- a conservative, devout Catholic -- does his job by the book, and views it in black and white terms: He believes that if someone breaks the law, he or she deserves to go to jail, regardless of circumstances. Curtis transferred to the 27th from the NYPD's Organized Crime Control Bureau, and occasionally comments on the increased scope of investigations he was able to undertake due to its larger budget. He left the OCCB because his female supervisor was making unwelcome sexual advances toward him. Curtis and his wife Deborah (played by Pat Moya) were married in 1989 and had three daughters: Olivia (born 1990), Serena (born 1992) and Isabel (born 1994). His sister died in a car accident at the age of 10. He is of Peruvian, English, Native American and German descent. In the character's first season on the show, he is rebuked by his superiors on at least four occasions: in the first, Briscoe calls him out for pulling his gun on a suspect; in the second, Curtis loses his temper with a suspect in the interrogation room and must be removed; in the third, Lieutenant Anita Van Buren (S. Epatha Merkerson) reprimands him for allowing a father to physically discipline his son in the interrogation room; in the fourth, Van Buren orders him to take the day off after rough conduct at headquarters. After about a year on the job, Curtis' values are tested by a series of personal problems. Distraught after witnessing the execution of a man he helped prosecute, Curtis cheats on Deborah with a college student (Jennifer Garner). His infidelity nearly destroys their marriage, but they repair their relationship after going through counseling. Just as their lives are returning to normal, however, Deborah is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Curtis feels responsible for her suffering, as if God is punishing her for his sins. At this time, he also becomes more flexible in his approach to work, and he forms a deeper bond with the thrice-divorced Briscoe, who offers him advice and someone to lean on. Curtis returns the favor when Briscoe's daughter is murdered by briefly letting him stay with his family to help him deal with the grief. They become so close that Curtis' daughters call Briscoe \\"Uncle Lenny\\". By 1999, Deborah's MS has worsened considerably, to the point that she can hardly hold a toothbrush on her own. Curtis takes early retirement to care for her, and is succeeded by Det. Ed Green (Jesse L. Martin). He returns for a brief guest appearance on the December 11, 2009 episode, \\"Fed,\\" 10 years after his departure from the precinct. The episode reveals that the Curtis family had moved to California some years before. At the time of the episode, Deborah had finally succumbed to MS, and he and his daughters have returned to bury her on Long Island, where she and her family are from. Curtis tells Van Buren that Deborah died at home in his arms, and also that he had called and spoken to Briscoe shortly before his death. Personality Curtis is both politically and socially conservative: He is a staunch supporter of the death penalty and drug prohibition, and disapproves of single-parent families and in vitro fertilization. (Despite his conservatism, however, he is a supporter of Bill Clinton.) His unwavering, moralistic work ethic initially causes friction with Briscoe. Curtis especially disapproves of affirmative action. Curtis, who is of mestizo origin (Peruvian on his mother's side) feels he has made it on his own merits and resents what he sees as the suggestion that minorities need an added advantage. He is a supporter of former New York Governor George Pataki. The character introduces a marked step up in the use of technology as an aid to solving crimes. He is the first detective in the series to carry a mobile phone and use a laptop computer. Curtis is considerably more computer-literate than Briscoe; his familiarity with the Internet is the linchpin in solving several cases. He is also the first detective character featured in the Law & Order universe to carry a semi-automatic pistol instead of a revolver. Curtis's duty weapon is a Glock 19. While sifting through compact discs at an outdoor store at the end of season six, Curtis mentions that he likes the bands Oasis and Big Brother and the Holding Company. Homicide: Life on the Street appearances Curtis appears along with Briscoe on the Homicide: Life on the Street episodes \\"For God and Country\\", \\"Baby, It's You\\" and \\"Sideshow\\", in which they team up with John Munch (Richard Belzer) on cases that span from New York to Baltimore.

It is the second installment of the Call of Duty series. Announced by Activision on April 7, 2005, the game was released on October 25, 2005 for Microsoft Windows, and on November 22, 2005 as a launch title for the Xbox 360. Other versions were eventually released for OS X, mobile phones, and Pocket PCs. The game is set during World War II and the campaign mode is experienced through the perspectives of four soldiers: one in the Red Army, one in the United States Army, and two in the British Army. It contains four individual campaigns, split into three stories, with a total of 27 missions. Many features were added and changed from the original Call of Duty, notably regenerating health and an icon that indicates a nearby grenade about to explode. The game drew critical praise, particularly for the graphics, sound and the regenerating health system. As a launch game, the Xbox 360 version sold over 250,000 copies in its first week, and had sold over 2 million copies by January 2008. By November 2013, the game had sold nearly 6 million copies. Gameplay U.S. Rangers going ashore in LCVP landing craft. Call of Duty 2 is a first-person shooter that has a single-player story mode and a multiplayer mode. The player takes on the roles of several Allied protagonists in specific missions during World War II. The player can crouch and lie prone, and is able to scale low walls and other obstacles. Two firearms can be carried, which can be swapped with those left on the battlefield, and both fragmentation and smoke grenades can also be carried. A gun's iron sights can be used to aim more accurately. A compass on the heads-up display (HUD) shows both allies and enemies, and objective markers to indicate locations the player must reach, areas to defend, or enemy cannons or tanks that the player must plant explosives on to disable. Emplaced weapons such as machine guns and flak cannons are available in some locations to take out enemy troops. In addition, some missions place the player in control of a tank. The player has a set of binoculars. While it is generally ignored during infantry-limited gameplay, it is vital to the long-range use of the Crusader tanks and one of the missions in which the player must direct artillery fire to defend a town. It is also important for scouting, though most of the game takes place in personal, close combat situations reducing the importance of this tactic. Should the player take severe damage, the screen will turn red and the sound of the character's heartbeat will increase in volume; this indicates the player's health is low. The player must find a way to stay out of fire to recover before entering battle again or else will die and restart from the last checkpoint. Health is only restored through automatic recharging when the player is not taking fire. Some attacks, such as explosions from grenades or shells, will kill the player instantly if the player is too close. In April 2006, Infinity Ward released the Call of Duty 2 Radiant, which allows a player to create their own multiplayer or single-player maps. Along with Radiant, the mapmaker includes Maya plug-in support, an effects editor, and an asset manager which allows custom models to be made and imported into the game, as well as custom effects. Campaign Call of Duty 2 contains three individual campaigns, fought in the roles of four World War II soldiers, for a total of 27 missions. The game has four difficulty levels: Easy, Regular, Hardened, and Veteran. Multiplayer Call of Duty 2 features several game types: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Search & Destroy, Capture the Flag and Headquarters. The maps include Normandy, Africa, and Russia. Each team can choose a variety of weapons, depending on the map. Players can choose between American soldiers, Soviet soldiers, and British soldiers for the Allied forces, while the Axis forces must play as German soldiers. Each PC multiplayer server can hold a maximum of sixty-four players, while the limit is eight players on Xbox. In the Xbox 360 version, players can play on Xbox Live and get new map packs. There are a total of thirteen official maps, and three of these are remakes from the original Call of Duty. There are also three extra map packs named Bonus Pack, Skirmish Pack, and Invasion Pack, adding a total of eight maps. Plot=Soviet campaign The player controls Private Vasili Koslov of the 13th Guards Rifle Division, initially involved in the defense of Moscow from the advancing German forces. The next level involves the destruction of a German stronghold in Stalingrad during September 1942. The next objective involves battling for strongholds throughout Stalingrad throughout December 1942, including re-connecting cut telephone wires and re-capturing the rail-yard and train-station. The final mission takes place during the final Soviet offensive in Stalingrad in January 1943, which involves the re-capture and defense of city blocks and Stalingrad city hall. British campaign The player controls a British soldier, Sergeant John Davis of the 7th Armoured Division in North Africa, led by Captain Price. The first level has the player taking part in a sneak attack on German Afrika Korps troops, ending with the destruction of a German supply station. The next level has the player defending a town from overwhelming numbers of Germans sending counter attacks from North, West, South and East; finally achieving victory by destroying much of the German tank force using artillery. This is followed by the Second Battle of El Alamein, during which the player has to fight through several trenches, machine gun nests, 88 millimeter guns and finally taking the German field headquarters. The assault on El Dabaa to intercept the remaining Germans in Egypt and destroy several 88 millimeter guns soon follows, ending the first British campaign. An addendum to the second set of missions has the player taking on the role of a British tank commander, David Welsh, while engaging enemies in Libya. The first mission of the third campaign in Toujane, Tunisia, has the player immediately under fire, holding a house until they break out and rendezvous with the second squad. They then retake Toujane with reinforcements the next day all before assaulting Matmata. The final British campaign takes place during the Battle for Caen as part of Operation Overlord. American campaign As Corporal Bill Taylor of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, the player starts off by playing a part in D-Day, at the assault of Pointe du Hoc, to destroy a German artillery battery, and hold it against a massive German counter-offensive in the following mission. Soon after, the player captures a nearby town and serves as a sniper against mortar crews until reinforcements arrive. The second objective is focused on Hill 400, involving the capture of Bergstein, a disastrous charge at Hill 400's bunkers and the defense against the German counterattack, with the player again performing sniper work against German mortar teams, destroying enemy armor, and generally holding the hill against the counter-offensive, all the while burdened by artillery and overwhelming numbers of German soldiers. The final mission is set amongst the Americans in the Rhine River crossing into Germany. It begins as one of the few missions with the player immediately under fire, providing cover fire against the Germans until reaching the river banks and then fighting through most of the town. The final fight has the player defeat two German Tiger I's. Ending The end credits depict the dramatic rescue of Captain Price from the Germans by a group of American soldiers. After the credits end, the words \\"No cows were harmed in the making of this game\\" appear, as in the original Call of Duty. This is a reference to the dead cattle visible in the Normandy missions. Development On April 7, 2005, Activision announced that Infinity Ward was developing Call of Duty 2, set for release in fall 2005 for PC. It had been speculated that Infinity Ward was developing the sequel at the same time as Gray Matter Interactive developed Call of Duty: United Offensive. Infinity Ward president Grant Collier said: The press release said players would engage enemies in a less linear battlefield, tackle the major battles chronologically, and use squad tactics not available in previous Call of Duty games. Infinity Ward also confirmed making a \\"Battle Chatter System\\", similar to Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault, where squad members converse to create situational awareness. The game engine—proprietary IW engine 2.0—is a modified version of id Tech 3, which was used in the first Call of Duty game. With the new game engine, Infinity Ward expanded the scope of combat to deliver a realistic battlefield experience and improved the visuals. The developers were able to cloud visibility with smoke from smoke grenades and create weather effects like dusty sandstorms and whiteout blizzard. The game was known to \\"let players experience four individual soldier stories as they overcome insurmountable odds in multiple campaigns. Players have the freedom to follow each of the four storylines through for the ultimate character-driven experience, or they can engage in the historic battles chronologically for quick hitting action. Squads now have the freedom to take on a variety of mission objectives, on expansive battlefields that allow for multiple paths and the ability to utilize actual combat tactics like outflanking and fire and maneuver capabilities\\". Call of Duty 2 was going to be more immersive than the original Call of Duty. Vince Zampella, creative director of Infinity Ward, said, \\"We didn't want to take any of the parts out that made Call of Duty so good. But there were a couple of things that we admit could have been done better\\". A demo of the game showed a more open gameplay style and a better AI for the enemies, who would actively go after the player. There are a set number of enemies set on the map that will begin reacting to the player's presence once the first shot has been fired. Groups of enemies farther away send units up to see what is happening and add to the combat while enemies directly in front of the player will join in and take cover quickly. Infinity Ward spent a lot of time on WWII battlefields, which led them to scrap whole levels for parts of the game that took place in France, since they found the location a lot different than what they imagined. One of the details the team added are post-war effects that continue on the battlefield throughout the game, where dust and smoke continue to roll through the streets, clouding up vision, and junk and debris scattered everywhere. The game has sound attenuation, with a 5.1 surround sound system, and context sensitive dialog, with a total of twenty-thousand lines of dialog. Each of the soldiers fighting alongside the player will call out the position of enemy soldiers, warn of flank attacks, and help out in ways that were not possible in the first game of the series. Zampella said, \\"We really wanted realistic battle chatter going that's not only entertaining, but actually adds to the gaming experience. So now you'll hear your guys telling you that there's [sic] two guys hiding behind that rusty car in the street or that there are people on the second floor of a building\\". A small grayed-out grenade icon appears in the center of the screen when the player is near a grenade, with an arrow pointing in the direction of the grenade. Enemies can sometimes seem to be dead when they are not, where the enemy can still wield his side arm and fire at the player, known as Last Stand, which would later become a perk available to players in the multiplayer of subsequent games. The game was showcased in E3 in 2005 and was announced as a launch title for the upcoming Xbox 360. Reception Call of Duty 2 received \\"generally positive\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The graphics and sound were widely praised and the reactions to the regenerating health system were mostly positive, with reviewers from GameSpot and GamePro calling it an improvement over the previous health bar system. For the Xbox 360 version, IGN's Douglass C. Perry described the presentation as \\"classy and well-produced\\", and said the graphics were some of the best on the Xbox 360 at its launch. He called the sound effects \\"unbelievable\\", whilst the gameplay was described as containing an \\"enormous amount of action\\". GameSpot reviewer Bob Colayco summarized his review by stating that Call of Duty 2 has \\"smooth, detailed graphics and great sound\\", as well as praising the artificial intelligence, realism, and variety in the campaign. GamePro called the game \\"breathtaking\\", and commended the game for its \\"strikingly realistic detail on weapons and walls, emphasized by normal mapping, exceptional shading and lighting, specular highlights, and some absolutely phenomenal particle effects\\". GameSpy editor Will Tuttle called it \\"One of the finest FPSs ever created. Thanks to a combination of sharp visuals, teeth-rattling sound effects, and tricky enemy AI, you'll be on the edge of your seat from the moment you're dropped into combat until your dying breath\\". For the PC version, IGN editor Tom McNamara was impressed with the presentation and graphics, describing them as \\"Excellent\\" and \\"smooth\\" respectively. He also said the graphics did not suffer \\"from also being developed for the 360\\". McNamara also praised the sound, describing it as \\"sad music, encompassing battle noise, and excellent voice work\\". Bob Colayco of GameSpot also reviewed the PC version of the game, as he did its Xbox 360 counterpart. Colayco again commended the sound, calling the presentation of the game \\"excellent\\", as well as praising the aggression of the artificial intelligence. Unlike in his review of the Xbox 360 version, Colayco felt the multiplayer aspect was \\"fun\\". His main critique was for performance, stating \\"performance can chug at times\\". GameSpy's Sal Accardo noted \\"Instead of feeling like a stale retread [of the original Call of Duty] or losing steam halfway through, it manages to be a blast from start to finish\\". GamesRadar Joshua Latendresse called the single-player campaign \\"stunning\\" and cited that the multiplayer was even better. Despite this praise, McNamara of IGN commented that he finds implementing regenerating health to be \\"a little troublesome\\", and that it allows players to \\"experience a kind of combat only a mythical super-soldier could withstand\\" which, therefore, \\"propels the game from gritty authenticity to John Woo fantasy\\". GameSpot's Colayco was critical of the game's pricing, stating it had a \\"higher pricepoint than its PC counterpart\\". He also complained that the multiplayer aspect could only support eight players. For the PC version, his main critique was for performance, stating \\"performance can chug at times\\". The PC version multiplayer was criticized as being a step back from that of Call of Duty: United Offensive. Call of Duty 2 was the most popular launch title on the Xbox 360, with 200,000 units sold in its first week of availability. 77% of people who purchased an Xbox 360 also purchased the game, which contributed to its high sales. As of July 2006, 1.4 million copies of the game had been sold on the Xbox 360. By January 2008, the game had sold 2 million copies. By November 2013, the game had sold 5.9 million copies. The editors of Computer Games Magazine named Call of Duty 2 the seventh-best computer game of 2005. They called it \\"the ultimate WWII shooter\\". Advertisement controversy A television advertisement for Call of Duty 2 was the subject of some controversy in 2006. The commercial, created by a Los Angeles animation studio Rhythm and Hues Studios, depicted a first-person view of events that were supposed to transpire during the game, rather than scenes from the game itself. Some consumers felt that the advertisements were misleading, and in February 2006 the United Kingdom's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) demanded that networks remove the advertisements after three consumers filed complaints of false advertising. According to ASA spokesperson Donna Mitchell, \\"Viewers felt that the ad was misleading because the quality of graphics was superior to that of the game's\\". Activision denies that the scenes were meant to give an impression of gameplay, stating in a press release shortly after the ASA banning that \\"The footage was intended purely to communicate the subject matter of the game rather than to represent actual gameplay\\". Other versions A collector's edition of the game was released for Windows on October 25, 2005 and for the Xbox 360 labeled as the \\"Special Edition\\". It features the game and a bonus disc, which includes interviews, a making of the movie and two mission walkthroughs. On May 17, 2006, Activision announced a Game of the Year Edition for the Xbox 360, which includes material from the Special Edition, plus a token to download the Skirmish Map Pack. In January 2006, MFORMA (now Hands-On Mobile) released Call of Duty 2 for mobile phones. The mobile version is a 2D top-down shooter. It received a favorable review from IGN, praising its length and storytelling.

John Wilkes Booth attended the school in the 1850s.Booth Family Historic Sites , Historical Society of Harford County (Md.), March, 2002 In 1867, while the Bel Air Academy was operating separately, a wooden one-room school house was built on Main Street, which functioned as the main public school of the county. In 1882, a brick public school was built at 45 East Gordon Street. The school was renamed the Bel Air Academy and Graded School as the old academy merged with the public school system. This building housed classes for all students above the third grade. Additions to the building were made in 1897 and 1910. This building became solely a grade school in 1924 and headquartered the Harford County Board of Education after 1951.

The airport covers and has one runway. The facility is a general aviation and cargo airport on the site of Norton Air Force Base, which was built as the San Bernardino Air Depot in 1942 and was decommissioned in March 1994. A non-federal control tower (NFCT) opened on November 9, 2008 and is operated under contract by SERCO company personnel. Norton Air Force Base The air base opened shortly after the attacks on Pearl Harbor. Norton was placed on the Department of Defense's base closure list in 1989 (the same year that the DoD signed the Federal Facilities Agreement with the EPA). The closure was cited as due to environmental wastes, inadequate facilities, and air traffic congestion. The last of the base facilities closed in 1995. Status Most parts of San Bernardino International Airport were completed in 2011, but a customs facility is still under construction. San Bernardino International Airport was built to conform to aviation-demand modeling and allocations performed as part of the 2008 Regional Transportation Plan (R.T.P.) of the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), the Metropolitan Planning Organization for San Bernardino, Los Angeles, Riverside, Ventura, Imperial, and Orange counties. The 2008 R.T.P. projected 9.4 million passengers and 1.29 million tons of air cargo at San Bernardino International Airport in 2035 with improved ground access provided, in part, by high-speed rail. The California High-Speed Rail Authority is currently performing alternatives analysis regarding the Los Angeles-to-San Diego segment, which includes, along the I-215 alignment, an optional station location at Rialto Avenue and E Street in the city of San Bernardino. The 2008 R.T.P states, \\"The high speed, reliability, and predictability of high-speed airport access will be needed to overcome mounting and increasingly unpredictable traffic congestion (on area freeways).\\" U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents are available on call to clear imported goods. The airport is used as a base for United States Forest Service planes fighting forest fires. Several hangars that were formerly empty have recently been occupied by civilian-owned aircraft maintenance companies. The runway is long, easily accommodating air cargo aircraft. The airport and some of the surrounding area is within the city of San Bernardino and the Inland Valley Development Agency. The surrounding areas are being redeveloped by Hillwood. The airport was the filming location for the 2001 movie The Fast and the Furious and the 2004 Martin Scorsese film The Aviator using a Lockheed Constellation preserved by the Airline History Museum, and flown in for the shoot, with one hangar \\"dressed\\" as a Trans World Airlines facility. Airlines and destinations=Cargo=Passenger terminal San Bernardino's terminal can accommodate domestic and international airline service. Volaris, a Mexican low-cost airline, announced the beginning of flights to Guadalajara, Mexico in November 2017. So far, flights have not begun. Location The airport is about two miles east of downtown San Bernardino and 14 miles northeast of downtown Riverside. It is six miles northwest of downtown Redlands, on the outskirts of Highland. Motorists can use the San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10), Barstow-Downtown San Bernardino-Riverside Freeway (Interstate 215), or the Foothill Freeway (State Route 210). It is also served by Omnitrans Route 8 and, indirectly, by the San Bernardino Line and the Inland Empire-Orange County Line of the Metrolink regional rail service. San Bernardino County grand jury and FBI investigations An audit completed June 2011 at the request of a grand jury investigation found examples of potential mismanagement and financial irregularities. In September 2011, as part of a special joint corruption task force, the FBI raided the offices of the airport and the home of airport developer Scot Spencer to secure internal documents. In late September 2011, Don Rogers, the Director of the SBIA Authority (SBIAA) resigned. The grand jury report questioned a relationship between Rogers and Spencer, including a settlement of a legal claim by companies owned by Spencer against the SBIAA for almost $1 million without ascertaining whether Spencer's companies suffered damages equivalent to such an amount.

The Peace Conference of 1861 was a meeting of 131 leading American politicians in February 1861, at the Willard's Hotel in Washington, D.C., on the eve of the American Civil War. The success of President Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party in the 1860 presidential elections led to a flurry of political activity. In much of the South, elections were held to select delegates to special conventions to consider secession from the Union. In Congress, efforts were made in both the House of Representatives and the Senate to reach compromise over the issues relating to slavery that were dividing the nation. The conference was the final effort by the individual states to resolve the crisis. With the seven states of the Cotton South already committed to secession, the emphasis to preserve the Union peacefully focused on the eight slaveholding states representing the Upper and Border South, with the states of Virginia and Kentucky playing key roles. Background In December 1860, the final session of the Thirty-sixth Congress met. In the House, the Committee of Thirty-Three, with one member from each state, led by Ohio Republican Thomas Corwin, was formed to reach a compromise to preserve the Union. In the Senate, former Kentucky Whig John J. Crittenden, elected as a Unionist candidate, submitted the Crittenden Compromise, six proposed constitutional amendments that he hoped would address all the outstanding issues. Hopes were high, especially in the Border States, that the lame duck Congress could reach a successful resolution before the new Republican administration took office. Crittenden's proposals were debated by a specially-selected Committee of Thirteen. The proposals provided for, among other things, an extension of the Missouri Compromise line dividing the territories to the Pacific Ocean, bringing his efforts directly in conflict with the 1860 Republican Platform and the personal views of President-elect Abraham Lincoln, who had made known his objections. The compromise was rejected by the committee on December 22 by a vote of 7–6. Crittenden later brought the issue to the floor of the Senate as a proposal to have his compromise made subject to a national referendum, but the Senate rejected it on January 16, by a vote of 25–23.Nevins pg. 397–402. A modified version of the Crittenden Plan, believed to be more attractive to Republicans, was considered by an ad hoc committee of 14 congressmen from the lower North and the upper South, meeting several times between December 28 and January 4. The committee was chaired again by Crittenden and included other Southern Unionists such as Representatives John A. Gilmer of North Carolina, Robert H. Hatton of Tennessee, J. Morrison Harris of Maryland, and John T. Harris of Virginia. A version of their work was rejected by the House on January 7.Crofts pg. 201. Unlike the Crittenden Compromise, the so-called Border State Plan recommendation on the Missouri Compromise line did not include future acquired territory. In the House, the Committee of Thirty-Three on January 14 reported that it had reached majority agreement on a constitutional amendment to protect slavery where it existed and the immediate admission of New Mexico Territory as a slave state. This latter proposal would result in a de facto extension of the Missouri Compromise line for all existing territories.Nevins pg. 405–410 A fourth attempt came from the state of Virginia. Former President John Tyler, a private citizen of Virginia who was still much interested in the fate of the nation, had been appointed as a special Virginia envoy to President James Buchanan to urge him to maintain the status quo in regard to the seceded states. Later, Tyler was an elected delegate to the Virginia convention called to consider whether or not to follow the Deep South states out of the Union.Crapol pg. 259–261 Tyler thought that a final collective effort should be made to preserve the Union and in a document published on January 17, 1861, he called for a convention of the six free and six slave border states to resolve the sectional split. Governor John Letcher of Virginia had already made a similar request to the state legislature, agreed to sponsor the convention while the list of attendees to all of the states was expanded.Potter pg. 545–546 Corwin agreed to hold off any final vote on his House plan pending the final actions of the Peace Conference.Crofts pg. 208 Conference The conference convened on February 4, 1861, at the Willard Hotel; all seven Deep South states had already passed ordinances of secession and were preparing to form a new government in Montgomery, Alabama. At the same time that Tyler, selected to head the Peace Convention, was making his opening remarks in Washington, his granddaughter was ceremonially hoisting the flag for the convention in Montgomery. No delegates were sent by the Deep South states or by Arkansas, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, California, and Oregon. Fourteen free states and seven slave states were represented. Among the representatives to the conference were James A. Seddon and William Cabell Rives from Virginia, David Wilmot from Pennsylvania, Reverdy Johnson from Maryland, William P. Fessenden and Lot M. Morrill from Maine, James Guthrie from Kentucky, Stephen T. Logan from Illinois, Alvan Cullom from Tennessee, and Thomas Ewing and Salmon P. Chase from Ohio. Many of the delegates came in the belief that they could be successful, but many others, from both sides of the spectrum, came simply as \\"watchdogs\\" for their sectional interests. Because many of the 131 delegates, which included \\"six former cabinet members, nineteen ex-governors, fourteen former senators, fifty former representatives, twelve state supreme court justices, and one former president,\\" qualified as senior statesmen, the meeting was frequently referred to derisively as the Old Gentleman's Convention.Potter pg. 546, Klein pg. 239. On February 6, a separate committee, charged with drafting a proposal for the entire convention to consider, was formed. The committee consisted of one representative from each state and was headed by James Guthrie. The entire convention met for three weeks, and its final product was a proposed seven-point constitutional amendment that differed little from the Crittenden Compromise. The key issue, slavery in the territories, was addressed simply by extending the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacific Ocean, with no provision for newly-acquired territory. That section passed by a 9–8 vote of the states.Potter pg. 547 Potter notes that it passed only when the Illinois delegation shifted its vote, which led some to the false assumption that Lincoln had influenced this change of heart. Other features of the proposed constitutional amendment were the requirement for the acquisition of all future territories to be approved by a majority of both the slave states and the free states, a prohibition on Congress passing any legislation that would affect the status of slavery where it currently existed, a prohibition on state legislatures from passing laws that would restrict the ability of officials to apprehend and return fugitive slaves, a permanent prohibition on the foreign slave trade, and 100% compensation to any master whose fugitive slave was freed by illegal mob action or intimidation of officials required to administer the Fugitive Slave Act. Key sections of this amendment could be further amended only with the concurrence of all of the states. Aftermath In not pledging to limit the expansion of slavery to all new territories, the compromise failed to satisfy hardline Republicans. In not pledging to protect slavery in all territories, the compromise failed to address the issue that had divided the Democratic Party into northern and southern factions in the 1860 presidential elections. The convention's work was completed with only a few days left in the final session of Congress. The proposal was rejected in the Senate in a 28-7 vote and never came to a vote in the House.Nevins pg. 411–412 The Corwin Amendment, a less-encompassing constitutional amendment that was finally submitted by the Committee of Thirty-Three was passed by Congress, but it simply provided protection for slavery where it currently existed, something that Lincoln and most members of both parties already believed was a state right protected by the existing US Constitution. A bill for New Mexico statehood was tabled by a vote of 115-71 with opposition coming from both Southern Democrats as well as Republicans. With the adjournment of Congress and the inauguration of Lincoln as president, the only avenue for compromise involved informal negotiations between Unionist southerners and representatives of the incoming Republican government: Congress was no longer a factor. A final convention of only the slave states still in the Union scheduled for June 1861 never occurred because of the events at Fort Sumter. Robert H. Hatton, a Unionist from Tennessee who would later change sides, summed up the feelings of many shortly before Congress adjourned: :We are getting along badly with our work of compromise – badly. We will break, I apprehend, without any thing being done. God will hold some men to a fearful responsibility. My heart is sick.Crofts pg. 252 ReferencesSources *Crapol, Edward P.

Their common name comes from the galls they induce on plants for larval development. About 1,300 species of this generally very small creature (1–8 mm) are known worldwide, with about 360 species of 36 different genera in Europe and some 800 species in North America.  Features  Like all Apocrita, gall wasps have a distinctive body shape, the so-called wasp waist. The first abdominal tergum (the propodeum) is conjoined with the thorax, while the second abdominal segment forms a sort of shaft, the petiole. The petiole connects with the gaster, which is the functional abdomen in apocritan wasps, starting with the third abdominal segment proper. Together, the petiole and the gaster form the metasoma, while the thorax and the propodeum make up the mesosoma. The antennae are straight and consist of two or three segments. In many varieties, the backside of the mesosoma appears longitudinally banded. The wings are typically simply structured. The female's egg-depositing ovipositor is often seen protruding from the tip of the metasoma.  Reproduction and development  The reproduction of the gall wasp is partly parthenogenesis, in which a male is completely unnecessary, and partly two-sex propagation.The population biology of oak gall wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) Stone et al. (2002) Annual Review of Entomology Vol. 47: 633-668 With most species an alternation of generations occurs, with one two-sex generation and one parthenogenic generation annually, whereas some species produce very few males and reproduce only by parthenogenesis. This process differentiates the various generations primarily in their appearance and the form of the plant galls they induce. The larvae of most gall wasps develop in characteristic plant galls they induce themselves, but many species are also inquilines of other gall wasps, such as those of the genus Synergus. The plant galls mostly develop directly after the female insect lays the eggs. The inducement for the gall formation is largely unknown; discussion speculates as to chemical, mechanical, and viral triggers. The hatching larvae nourish themselves with the nutritive tissue of the galls, in which they are otherwise well-protected from external environmental effects. The host plants, and the size and shape of the galls are specific to the majority of gall wasps, with about 70% of the known species parasitizing various types of oak trees. Galls can be found on nearly all parts of such trees, including the leaves, buds, branches, and roots. Other species of gall wasps live in eucalyptus trees, rose bushes or maple trees, as well as many herbs. Frequently, the determination of the species is much easier through observation of the galls produced rather than the insect itself.  Parasitism  A gall provides the developing gall wasp with a safe refuge for the most vulnerable stage of its life cycle, but many other wasps have found a way to penetrate this defence and parasitise the larva(e) within. Some of these parasitoids use their long, hardened egg-laying tube (ovipositor) to bore into the gall and lay an egg on the helpless gall maker. A bedeguar or robin's pincushions gall, collected before the autumn and kept cool, may result in at least one species of parasitoid emerging instead of the gall maker. These wasps, such as Eurytoma rosae, are beautiful, metallic insects with long ovipositors. These parasitoids may, in turn, be preyed upon by other wasps, hyperparasitoids.  Types  Most species of gall wasps live as gall-formers on oaks. One of the most well-known is the common oak gall wasp (Cynips quercusfolii), which induces characteristic, 2-cm in diameter, spherical galls on the undersides of oak leaves.

Light lentiform galls on the undersides of the same leaves are induced by Neuroterus quercusbaccarum; darker ones with bulging edges are formed by Neuroterus numismalis. Also striking are the galls of Cynips longiventris, which likewise can be found on the undersides of leaves, and are recognizable for their spheroidal shape and irregular red streaks. The oak potato gall wasp (Biorrhiza pallida) has round galls that grow to about 4 cm. These are known colloquially as oak potatoes. The latter type of gall is induced by this type of wasp not on the leaves, but on the roots of the oak. On the buds of young oak twigs, one can often find the hard- shelled galls of Andricus kollari and Andricus quercustozae. Galls do not cause significant harm to oak trees. The galls of the rose gall wasp (Diplolepis rosae) are also distinctive and are known as bedeguars or robin's pincushions. These are found on the shoots of dog roses and have a length of up to 5 cm with red, long-haired outgrowths. Inside the galls are several chambers, which may be occupied by larvae. Subfamilies There are two subfamilies, one extinct and one extant: * Cynipinae * Hodiernocynipinae†  Tribes  There are twelve tribes: * Aulacideini Nieves-Aldrey, Nylander & Ronquist, 2015. * Aylacini Ashmead, 1903. * Ceroptresini Nieves-Aldrey, Nylander & Ronquist, 2015. * Cynipini Billberg, 1820. * Diastrophini Nieves- Aldrey, Nylander & Ronquist, 2015. * Diplolepini Latreille, 1802. * Eschatocerini Ashmead, 1903. * Paraulacini Nieves-Aldrey & Liljeblad, 2009. * Pediaspini Ashmead, 1903. * Phanacidini Nieves-Aldrey, Nylander & Ronquist, 2015. * Qwaqwaiini Liljeblad, Nieves-Aldrey & Melika, 2011. * Synergini Ashmead, 1896.

He established the Carolina Panthers franchise, which he owned for 23 years. Early life and college Richardson was born in Spring Hope, North Carolina. After completing high school in Fayetteville, North Carolina, he entered Wofford College, located in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Richardson was an Associated Press Little All-America selection in 1957 and '58. He still holds Wofford's single-game record with 241 receiving yards vs. Newberry in 1956 and is the record holder for touchdown receptions in a season (9 in 1958) and in a career (21). As a senior at Wofford, he scored 72 points on nine touchdowns, 12 extra points and two field goals. Richardson calls being elected team captain in 1958 his greatest honor. In 1983, he was chosen to Wofford's All-Time Football team as a receiver. Richardson was active in numerous groups on the Wofford campus; he was a member of Kappa Alpha Order fraternity, President of the Inter-Fraternity Council, and member of the SCA Cabinet. Honors he received while at Wofford included Distinguished Military Student, Scabbard and Blade Military Fraternity, Sigma Delta Psi, Blue Key National Honorary Fraternity, and recognition in Who's Who in American Universities and Colleges. Professional football Drafted in the 13th round by the defending world champion Baltimore Colts, Richardson played two seasons in the NFL, earning Colt Rookie of the Year honors in 1959. He caught a touchdown pass in the 1959 NFL Championship Game from quarterback Johnny Unitas. Business Following his NFL career, Richardson used his 1959 NFL championship bonus with the help of friend and former Wofford quarterback Charles Bradshaw to open the first Hardee's franchise in Spartanburg. The two ended up owning the Hardee's business 50/50. The business expanded rapidly under his hands-on management style. From headquarters in Spartanburg, he co- founded Spartan Foods, which was the first franchisee of Hardee's. He later was the CEO of Flagstar, which was the sixth largest food service company in the United States, controlling 2,500 restaurants and providing jobs for 100,000 employees. He retired in 1995.Jerry Richardson. Knowitall.org. Retrieved on April 19, 2012. Carolina Panthers On October 26, 1993, Richardson became the first former NFL player since George Halas to become an owner when the Carolina Panthers were unanimously awarded the NFL's 29th franchise. The Panthers would represent and benefit not only Charlotte and North Carolina, but rather the entire region. Richardson was regarded as one of the most powerful NFL owners, alongside Jerry Jones and Robert Kraft of the Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots, respectively. Richardson played a role locking out the NFL players in 2011 and in negotiating a new players agreement.Jerry Richardson Tribute. Panthers.com. Retrieved on April 19, 2012. For the most part, Richardson stayed in the background and rarely interfered in the Panthers' day-to-day operations. For instance, when he discontinued George Seifert after the 2001 season (in which the Panthers went 1-15), he went nine years before holding another press conference at which he took questions from the media—when he announced that John Fox's contract would not be renewed. One of the few times in which he directly intervened in football matters came in the 2014–15 offseason, when he refused to re-sign player Greg Hardy in the wake of domestic violence events. Richardson said that he made the decision not to do so because \\"we do the right things.\\" It had long been presumed that Richardson intended to have his sons, Mark and Jon, inherit the team. However, both stepped aside before the 2009 season, and Jon died of cancer in 2013. On January 16, 2013, WBTV in Charlotte reported that Richardson wanted the team sold after he dies, but presumably only to someone who would keep the team and jobs in Charlotte.Source: Richardson mandates Panthers be sold after death. WBTV, January 16, 2013 After the death of Buffalo Bills founder Ralph Wilson in 2014, Richardson was one of only two NFL owners (Houston Texans owner Robert C. McNair being the other) to have owned his respective team for its entire history. After both Richardson's sale of the Panthers and McNair's death in 2018, there remain no NFL owners who have owned their teams for their entire history. In the 2015 season, Richardson's Panthers reached Super Bowl 50 on February 7, 2016, after losing only one game all season. The Panthers fell to the Denver Broncos by a score of 24–10. At the company's expense, the Panthers transported and housed a majority of their employees at the Super Bowl.  Sale of the franchise  As Panthers majority owner, Richardson was said to be a \\"champion of diversity\\", with African- American Cam Newton as starting quarterback, Hispanic Ron Rivera as head coach, and former Carolina Topcats cheerleader Tina Becker as chief operating officer. However, Richardson's tenure also had some controversy. On December 17, 2017, Sports Illustrated reported, based on anonymous sources, that \\"at least four former Panthers employees have received ‘significant’ monetary settlements due to inappropriate workplace comments and conduct by owner Jerry Richardson, including sexually suggestive language and behavior, and on at least one occasion directing a racial slur at an African-American Panthers scout. On the same day, it was announced that Richardson intended to sell the Panthers franchise at the conclusion of the 2017 season. After great interest from the market, in May 2018 Richardson finalized a sale to billionaire and then Pittsburgh Steelers minority owner David Tepper for an NFL record sales price of $2.2 billion. The deal was approved by NFL owners on May 22, 2018. On June 28, 2018, Richardson was fined $2.75 million for the aforementioned alleged workplace misconduct. A 13-foot statue of Richardson holding a football and flanked by two panthers was unveiled at Bank of America Stadium in 2016; it was a gift from the Panthers LLC minority partners to Richardson for his 80th birthday. On June 10, 2020, following the protests over the death of George Floyd, the statue was removed due to public safety concerns.

It was envisioned that it would be launched sometime around 2016 and take 8 to 12 years to reach the planet; however, NASA's website no longer lists any possible launch date. The Neptune Orbiter concept would have answered many questions about the nature of the planet. Its objective was to study Neptune's atmosphere and weather, its ring system, and its moons, particularly Triton. The California Institute of Technology proposed one mission plan in 2004, while the University of Idaho and Boeing proposed an alternative approach in 2005. Mission summary and status Neptune Orbiter's primary mission was to go into orbit and perform scientific studies of the planet. The mission concept was first proposed to NASA in 2005. It was proposed to use a launch rocket similar to the Delta IV or Atlas V. The orbiter's trajectory was to use one Venus gravity assist, and a Jupiter gravity assist before arriving at Neptune. The length of time from launch until Neptune arrival was estimated to be 10.25 years. Just prior to arriving, the orbiter would release its two atmospheric probes, which would transmit data before aerocapture. Then, it would begin Neptune orbit insertion by aerocapture. After adjusting its orbit to its planned science orbit, the orbiter would carry out studies of Neptune, its rings, atmosphere, weather, and its natural satellites. The main phase of the science operations would have taken from 3 to 5 years with a possible extension lasting 3 more years. In 2008, the mission was removed from NASA's possible future missions list. According to NASA's 2010 budget, funding to missions to the outer Solar System was aimed at the future Europa Jupiter System Mission. The remaining budget was allocated to ongoing undertakings such as Cassini–Huygens, Juno, and New Horizons, with the Neptune system not being part of any official considerations. In 2011, NASA's Decadal Survey considered a mission to an ice giant—either Uranus or Neptune—but for feasibility reasons recommended a Uranus orbiter and probe. In 2019, a Neptune flyby proposal was made by the JPL under the name \\"Trident\\" for inclusion in the Discovery program.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/science/triton-neptune-nasa- trident.html Power sources=Radioisotope thermoelectric generators The Caltech mission concept would have been similar in design to previous NASA outer Solar System missions. It would use radioisotope thermoelectric generators for electrical power. Based on this proposal, the spacecraft design would be similar to Galileo, Cassini–Huygens, Voyager 2, and New Horizons, with conventional thrusters for propulsion. Another proposal was to power the spacecraft with a nuclear-powered Stirling engine, which NASA were developing at that time and would be succeeded by the Kilopower study, together with ion propulsion. Solar panels Another proposal called for using solar panels to provide electrical power to the spacecraft. The panels would be inflatable, reducing their mass. Although advancements in solar panel technology means it should be possible to achieve sufficient power at the distance of Neptune, the high cost of providing the solar panels would possibly eliminate the idea of using solar cells. This design would presumably also use conventional thrusters, because the dim sunlight in the outer Solar System would probably be insufficient to power an ion propulsion system. Instruments=Orbiter The orbiter would have carried out the main mission objectives. Some proposed instruments were a multispectral imaging system to image the planet from ultraviolet to infrared, and a magnetometer, to investigate why the Neptune's magnetic field is oriented so far from the planet's axis of rotation. Triton lander(s) NASA scientists and engineers have considered to send one or two mini-landers to Triton's surface and analyze the composition of the surface, the interior, and the very rarefied nitrogen atmosphere. Various landing sites were suggested, among those the area with Nitrogen geysers that had been discovered by the Voyager spacecraft, but other locations were also proposed such as either the north or south poles of Triton. No final decision were however made since this were only a proposed mission. The landers' operational lifetime could have been anything between days to a month depending on power source and instrumentation. Atmospheric probe(s) Along with Triton landers, at least two atmospheric probes were proposed to descend through Neptune's atmosphere and study the climate and weather of the stormy planet. Similar to the Galileo probe that descended into Jupiter's atmosphere, the descent of a probe into the atmosphere of Neptune would take about 2–3 hours until the planet's atmospheric heat and pressure would destroy it – the data transmitted during the descent would allow a detailed analysis of Neptune's atmosphere.

She served as regent of Sicily during the minority of her son Roger II of Sicily from 1101 until 1112. Family She was the daughter of Manfred del Vasto (brother of Boniface del Vasto, marquess of Western Liguria, and Anselm del Vasto). Her uncle held much political clout in the region of Liguria–a document relating the deeds of Roger I described him as “that most renowned marquis of Italy.” Kenneth Baxter Wolf, The Deeds of Count Roger of Calabria and of His Brother Duke Robert Guiscard (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2005), 189. Her father's family was of Frankish descent of a branch of the Aleramici, sharing a common descent from Aleramo of Montferrat with the Marquesses of Montferrat. Her brothers founded the lines of the Marquesses of Saluzzo, of Busca, of Lancia, of Ceva, and of Savona. Her paternal grandparents were Teto II del Vasto, and his wife Bertha of Turin, daughter of margrave Ulric Manfred II of Turin. Countess consort of Sicily In 1089, Adelaide married Roger I while her sister married Roger's illegitimate son Jordan. Roger I died in 1101, and Adelaide ruled as regent of Sicily for her young sons Simon and Roger II. Adelaide herself was quite young when she became regent; she was only about 26 years old at the time.Hubert Houben, Roger II of Sicily: A Ruler Between East and West (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 24. During her tenure, the emir Christodulus rose to preeminence at the court and Palermo was settled as the capital of the realm. Almost immediately after Adelaide assumed the position of regent, rebellions broke out in parts of Calabria and Sicily.Graham A. Loud, Roger II and the Making of the Kingdom of Sicily (Manchester: Manchester University Press), 10 The writings of the Norman monk Orderic Vitalis recount that Adelaide put an end to these episodes of insurgency with severity.Hubert Houben, Roger II of Sicily: A Ruler Between East and West (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 24. The use of great force in suppressing such rebellions, however, did not tarnish her reputation as a ruler. In fact, Abbot Alexander of Telese's history of Roger I describes Adelaide as “a most prudent woman, [she] exercised the cares of the government and ruled over the county.” Graham A. Loud, Roger II and the Making of the Kingdom of Sicily (Manchester: Manchester University Press), A Greek and Arab charter from 1109 describes Adelaide as “the great female ruler, the malikah of Sicily and Calabria, the protector of the Christian faith.” Hubert Houben, Roger II of Sicily: A Ruler Between East and West (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), Adelaide's older son, Simon, was enthroned when he reached the appropriate age (around 8 or 9 years old) but died in 1105, leaving Adelaide regent again until Roger II reached his majority in 1112.Hiroshi Takayama, The Administration of the Norman Kingdom of Sicily (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1993), 40. Adelaide's second son, Roger II, took control over control of the kingdom in 1112, but there is evidence that Adelaide continued to play a central role in the governing of the island as her signature can still be seen on official documents even after 1112.Hiroshi Takayama, The Administration of the Norman Kingdom of Sicily (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1993), 47. Adelaide, and Roger II after her, chose to rule with the help of local officials, rather than importing a retinue of foreign advisors recognizing the great advantage in their familiarity with the island, its people and its cultures.Hubert Houben, Roger II of Sicily: A Ruler Between East and West (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 150. Similarly, she was careful to donate generously to the local Greek monasteries on Sicily as a way of currying favor with the pre-existing religious authorities.Hubert Houben, Roger II of Sicily: A Ruler Between East and West (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 26. Either through her influence or under her regency, her brother Henry del Vasto was granted Paternò and Butera. Henry (Enrico) was married to Flandina daughter of Count Roger I. of Calabria and Sicily. Queen consort of Jerusalem Meanwhile, in Jerusalem, after the death of Baldwin's first wife Godehilde during the First Crusade, Baldwin married an Armenian noblewoman traditionally known as Arda. Arda was useful in an alliance with the Armenians while Baldwin was Count of Edessa, but when he became King of Jerusalem in 1100 he seemed to have little use for an Armenian wife, and Arda was forced into a convent around 1105. In 1112 a new marriage was sought for the king. Arnulf of Chocques, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, suggested that Baldwin marry Adelaide, as Roger II was now old enough to rule Sicily alone. Baldwin sent ambassadors to Sicily, and somewhat hastily agreed to any terms which Adelaide might have; Adelaide demanded that their son, should they have one, inherit Jerusalem, and if they had no children, the kingdom would pass to her own son Roger II. Adelaide brought with her an enormous amount of badly needed money, as well as some Muslim archers and a thousand other Sicilian soldiers. Adelaide was already well into middle age and no new heir was immediately forthcoming. The king was blamed for a bigamous marriage (as Arda was still alive) and the Patriarch Arnulf was deposed. Pope Paschal II agreed to reinstate him in 1116, provided that he annul the marriage between Baldwin and Adelaide. Baldwin agreed, after falling ill and assuming that renouncing his sin of bigamy would cure him. In 1117 the annulment was performed at Acre, and Adelaide sailed back to Sicily. Adelaide died on 16 April 1118 and was buried in Patti. Roger II was outraged at the treatment of his mother and never forgave the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Almost thirty years later, Roger still refused to give assistance to the Crusader states during the Second Crusade. William of Tyre wrote of the impact of the incident: “Adelaide’s son was angered beyond measure, because she had been sent back. He conceived a mortal hatred against the kingdom and its people. Other Christian princes in various parts of the world, either by coming in person or by giving liberal gifts, have amplified our infant realm. But he and his heirs at the present time have never become reconciled to us to the extent of a single friend word. Although they could have relieved our necessities by council and aid far more easily than other prince, yet they have always remembered their wrongs and have unjustly avenged upon the whole people the fault of a single individual.” William of Tyre as quoted in Hubert Houben, Roger II of Sicily: A Ruler Between East and West (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 28.

The film features the final screen appearance of Lizabeth Scott. “Pulp”, originally titled “Memoirs Of A Ghost Writer“ was almost entirely shot on the island of Malta. Facilities were provided by the then Malta Film Facilities and Intermed Sound Studio, later known as Britannia Film Sound Studios. Plot Writer Mickey King lives in Rome churning out a string of violent, sexually charged hardboiled pulp fiction novels under an array of lewd pen names like \\"S. Odomy\\". King is offered an abnormally large sum to ghostwrite the autobiography of a mystery celebrity. The intrigued King agrees and is transported to a remote island, during which time he will make contact with a representative for the celebrity. King meets a man named Miller, who identifies himself as an English professor. King assumes Miller is the mysterious contact—until discovering Miller dead in his bathtub after a hotel room mix-up. Finally arriving on the island, King meets his subject: Preston Gilbert. A retired movie star, Gilbert is known for portraying gangsters and notorious for hanging out with real-life mobsters off the set. Now suffering from cancer, the pompous, vain Gilbert wants King to immortalize his life story before he dies. Gilbert is planning a fancy birthday celebration. Among the attendees is Princess Betty Cippola, a man-hungry social climber who seems to have a sordid history with Gilbert. However, after the party is underway and Gilbert has staged a practical joke, Miller returns, now dressed as a Catholic priest. Sensing danger, King flees as Miller opens fire, killing Gilbert. The partygoers assume it's another prank, and applaud as Gilbert dies. Gilbert's death leaves King with no conclusion to his tale. Playing detective like the heroes of his stories, King pieces together the mystery. He learns that Gilbert's proposed autobiography has alarmed several of the actor's erstwhile associates, who worry their schemes and crimes might be exposed.

It can also be used to deposit single or multiple monolayers on a solid substrate. Description=Overview The idea of a Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) film was first proven feasible in 1917 when Irving Langmuir (Langmuir, 1917) showed that single water-surface monolayers could be transferred to solid substrates. 18 years later, Katharine Blodgett made an important scientific advance when she discovered that several of these single monolayer films could be stacked on top of one another to make multilayer films (Blodgett 1935). Since then, LB films (and subsequently the troughs to make them) have been used for a wide variety of scientific experimentation, ranging from 2D crystallization of proteins to Brewster angle microscopy. The LB trough's general objective is to study the properties of monolayers of amphiphilic molecules. An amphiphilic molecule is one that contains both a hydrophobic and hydrophilic domain (e.g. soaps and detergents). The LB trough allows investigators to prepare a monolayer of amphiphilic molecules on the surface of a liquid, and then compress or expand these molecules on the surface, thereby modifying the molecular density, or area per molecule. This is accomplished by placing a subphase (usually water) in a trough, spreading a given amphiphile over the surface, and then compressing the surface with barriers (see illustration). The monolayer's effect on the surface pressure of the liquid is measured through use of a Wilhelmy plate, electronic wire probes, or other types of detectors. An LB film can then be transferred to a solid substrate by dipping the substrate through the monolayer. In addition to amphiphilic materials, Langmuir-Blodgett Troughs are commonly used nowadays to create nanoparticle coatings with controlled packing density. 449x449px Materials In early experiments, the trough was first constructed from metals such as brass. However difficulties arose with contamination of the sub-phase by metal ions. To combat this, glass troughs were used for a time, with a wax coating to prevent contamination from glass pores. This was eventually abandoned in favor of plastics that were insoluble in ordinary solvents, such as Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene). Teflon is hydrophobic and chemically inert, making it a highly suitable material, and the most commonly used for troughs today. Occasionally metal or glass troughs coated with a thin layer of Teflon are used; however they are not as enduring as solid PTFE troughs.Chechel, O. V., & Nikolaev, E. N. (1991). Devices for production of Langmuir–Blodgett films - review. Instruments and Experimental Techniques, 34(4), 750-762. In the case of liquid-liquid experiments where the compression is performed at the interface of a polar liquid such as water and a dispersive liquid such as oil, the trough is commonly manufactured from POM (polyoxymethylene). POM is more hydrophilic and aids in keeping the liquid- liquid interphase stable. Barriers Different mechanisms have been used to compress or expand the monolayers throughout the development of the LB trough. In their first experiments, Langmuir and Blodgett used flexible silk threads rubbed with wax to enclose and compress the monolayer film. Most commonly used systems are made of movable barriers that slide parallel to the walls of the trough and are in contact with the top of the fluid. These barriers are typically made from hydrophilic POM to form a meniscus on them that will aid in keeping the molecules inside even in high packing densities. PTFE barriers are also available for instances when additional chemical resistance is needed. Another version with a variable perimeter working zone is the circular trough in which the monolayer is located between two radial barriers. A constant perimeter trough was developed later in which the barrier is a flexible Teflon tape wrapped around three pairs of rollers. One of the pairs is fixed and the other two are movable on trolleys, so that the length of the tape remains constant as the area of the working zone is changed. Special Alternate troughs allow for preparation and deposition of alternating monolayers by having two separate working zones that can be compressed independently or synchronously by the barriers. Balance An important property of the system is its surface pressure (the surface tension of the pure subphase minus the surface tension of the subphase with amphiphiles floating on surface) which varies with the molecular area. The surface pressure – molecular area isotherm is one of the important indicators of monolayer properties. Additionally, it is important to maintain constant surface pressure during deposition in order to obtain uniform LB films. Measurement of surface pressure can be done by means of a Wilhelmy plate or Langmuir balance. The Wilhelmy method consists of a plate partially immersed in the liquid connected to an electronic linear-displacement sensor, or electrobalance. The plate can be made of platinum or filter paper which has been presoaked in the liquid to maintain constant mass. The plate detects the downward force exerted by the liquid meniscus which wets the plate. The surface tension can then be calculated by the following equation: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathrm{[Force \\\\ on \\\\ Plate]} &= \\\\mathrm{[Weight \\\\ of \\\\ plate]} &\\\\+ \\\\mathrm{[Surface \\\\ Tension \\\\ Force]} &\\\\- \\\\mathrm{[Buoyant \\\\ Force]} \\\\ F &= \\\\left(m_{p}g\\\\right) &\\\\+ 2(t_{p} + w_{p})\\\\gamma_{LV}\\\\cos(\\\\theta) &\\\\- \\\\rho_lV_pg \\\\end{align} where : m_p = \\\\mathrm{mass \\\\ of \\\\ plate} : g = \\\\mathrm{gravitational \\\\ acceleration} : t_p = \\\\mathrm{thickness \\\\ of \\\\ plate} : w_p = \\\\mathrm{width \\\\ of \\\\ plate} : \\\\gamma_{LV} = \\\\mathrm{surface \\\\ tension \\\\ of \\\\ liquid} : \\\\theta = \\\\mathrm{contact \\\\ angle} : \\\\rho_l = \\\\mathrm{density \\\\ of \\\\ liquid} : V_p = \\\\mathrm{Volume \\\\ of \\\\ the \\\\ proportion \\\\ of \\\\ plate \\\\ immersed \\\\ in \\\\ liquid} The weight of the plate can be determined beforehand and set to zero on the electrobalance, while the effect of buoyancy can be removed by extrapolating the force back to the zero depth of immersion. Then the remaining component force is only the wetting force. Assuming that perfect wetting of the plate occurs (θ = 0, cos(θ) = 1), then the surface tension can be calculated.Erbil, Husnu Yildirim, Surface chemistry of solid and liquid interfaces, Blackwell Publishing, 2006. : F = 2(t_p+w_p)\\\\gamma_{LV}\\\\cos(\\\\theta) \\\\, The surface pressure is then the change in surface tension due to the addition of the monolayer :\\\\Pi = \\\\gamma_o - \\\\gamma \\\\, Where : \\\\Pi = \\\\mathrm{surface \\\\ pressure} : \\\\gamma = \\\\mathrm{surface \\\\ tension \\\\ of \\\\ subphase \\\\ with \\\\ monolayer} : \\\\gamma_o = \\\\mathrm{surface \\\\ tension \\\\ of \\\\ pure \\\\ subphase} In Langmuir's method, the surface pressure is measured as the force exerted directly on a moveable barrier. History One of the first scientists to describe and attempt to quantify the spreading of monolayer films on the surface of a liquid was Benjamin Franklin. Franklin described the spreading of a drop of oil onto the surface of a lake to form a surface of defined area. In addition he did experiments dropping oil onto the surface of a bowl of water and noted that the spreading action was dependent on the surface area of the liquid, i.e. by increasing the surface of the liquid it will take more drops to create a film on the surface. Franklin suggested that this spreading action was based on repulsive forces between oil molecules.Franklin, B., Brownrigg, W., & Farish, M. (1774). Of the Stilling of Waves by means of Oil. Extracted from Sundry Letters between Benjamin Franklin, LL. D. F. R. S. William Brownrigg, M. D. F. R. S. and the Reverend Mr. Farish. Philosophical Transactions, 64, 445-460. Much later this work was continued by Lord Rayleigh, who suggested that the spreading of oil on water resulted in a monolayer of oil molecules.Rayleigh, F. R. S. (1890). Proc. R. Soc, 47, 364. A German woman and independent scientist, Agnes Pockels, wrote to Lord Rayleigh shortly after his publication in 1890. In this letter she described an apparatus she had designed to measure the surface tension of monolayers of hydrophobic and amphiphillic substances. This simple device was a trough made from a tin pan with tin inserts for determining the size of the surface and a balance with a 6 mm disk on one end to measure the force required to pull the disk from the surface. Using this device she described the general behavior of surface tension with varying surface concentrations of oil.Pockels, A. (1891). Nature, 43, 437. Pockels continued her work and in 1892 published a paper in which she calculated the amount of several materials (mostly household oils) required to form a monolayer. In addition she comments on the purity and cleanliness required to accurately perform measurements of surface tension. Also in this paper she reports values of the thickness of films of various amphiphillic substances on the surface of water.Pockels, A. (1892). Nature, 46, 418. In a later paper Pockels examined the effects of different ratios of hydrophobic to amphiphilic molecules on surface tension and monolayer formation.Pockels, A. (1894). Nature, 50, 223. After the turn of the century, Pockels's trough was improved upon by Irving Langmuir. With this new device Langmuir showed that amphiphillic films are truly monolayers, and these monolayers are oriented on the surface such that the \\"active or most hydrophilic portion of the surface molecules are in contact with the liquid below whereas the hydrophobic portions of the molecules are pointing up toward the air\\".Langmuir, I. (1917). THE CONSTITUTION AND FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS AND LIQUIDS. II. LIQUIDS. 1. Journal of the American Chemical Society, 39(9), 1848-1906. William Harkins described similar results at the same time.Harkins, W. D. (1917). The evolution of the elements and the stability of complex atoms. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 39, 856-879. Shortly after Langmuir described the transfer of amphiphilic films from water surfaces to solid surfaces (Langmuir, 1920). Langmuir won the Nobel prize in chemistry for this work in 1932. Neil Kensington Adam summarized and expanded on the work of Langmuir in a series of several papers published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London from 1921 to 1926.Adam, N. K. (1921). The properties and molecular structure of thin films of palmitic acid on water. Part I. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series A, Containing Papers of a Mathematical and Physical Character, 99(699), 336-351. Katherine Blodgett was a student of Irving Langmuir and in 1935 she described the deposition of hundreds of layers of amphiphilic molecules onto a solid substrate in a very ordered fashion. She made final developments to the Langmuir–Blodgett trough allowing it to be used to easily transfer films to solid surfaces.Blodgett, K. B. (1935). Films built by depositing successive monomolecular layers on a solid surface. Journal of the American Chemical Society, 57(6), 1007-1022. After the work of Blodgett the field was relatively inactive for several years until in 1971 Hans Kuhn began performing optical and photoelectric experiments with monolayer assemblies using the methods of Langmuir and Blodgett.Kuhn, H. (1971). Interaction of chromophores in monolayer assembles. Pure and Appl. Chem, 27, 421-438. Preparations of Langmuir–Blodgett troughs Any type of surface experiment requires maximal cleanliness and purity of components. Even small contaminations can have substantial effects on results. If an aqueous subphase is used, the water must be purified to remove organics and deionized to a resistivity not less than 1.8 GΩ-m. Impurities as small as 1ppm can radically change the behavior of a monolayer. To eliminate contamination from the air, the LB trough can be enclosed in a clean room. The trough set-up may also be mounted on a vibration isolation table, to further stabilize the monolayer. The exact calibration of the electrobalance is also very important for force measurements, as well as using a Wilhelmy plate as big as possible to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Experimental preparation requires that the trough and barriers be thoroughly cleaned by a solvent such as ethanol to remove any residual organics. The liquid subphase is added to a height such that the meniscus just touches the barriers. Often it is necessary to aspirate the surface of the liquid in order to remove any last remaining impurities. The amphiphilic molecules dissolved in solvent are slowly dropped onto the liquid surface using a microsyringe, with care being taken to spread it uniformly across the surface. Some time must be taken to allow for evaporation of the solvent, and the spreading of the amphiphile. The Wilhelmy plate to be used must be absolutely clean. A platinum plate must stripped of any organics with a solvent or heated by a flame. The Wilhelmy plate is then mounted on the electrobalance such that it is immersed perpendicular to the surface of the liquid and a uniform meniscus is achieved. Disposable paper plates can also be used. The transfer of a monolayer to a substrate is a delicate process dependent on many factors. These include the direction and speed of the substrate, the surface pressure, composition, temperature, and pH of the subphase. Many different transfer methods have been devised and patented. One method involves a dipping arm which holds the substrate and can be programmed to pass through the interface from top to bottom or bottom to top at a set speed. For dipping starting from below the liquid surface, the substrate should by hydrophilic, and for dipping starting above the liquid surface, the substrate should be hydrophobic. Multilayers can be achieved by successive dipping through alternating monolayers. Uses The LB trough has myriad uses, but generally takes on one of two roles. First (as described above), the trough can be used to deposit one or more monolayers of specific amphiphiles onto solid substrates. They are in turn used for different areas of science ranging from optics to rheology. For example, through devices fabricated from an LB trough Lee et al. showed in 2006 that direct electron tunneling was the mode of transportation in alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers T. H. Lee, W. Y. Wang, and M. A. Reed, \\"Mechanism of electron conduction in self-assembled alkanethiol monolayer devices.\\" pp. 21-35. Langmuir-Blodgett Troughs have unique advantages in nanoparticle deposition, making them capable of creating highly sophisticated coatings with nanoparticles. Some of the advantages include a precise control on the packing density of the molecules and the thickness of the deposited layer. Also LB method is flexible in using different geometries of substrates and different nanoparticle materials. Secondly, the LB trough can be used itself as an experimental device to test interfacial properties such as the surface tension of various fluids, as well as the surface pressure of a given system. The system can also be used as an observation mechanism to watch how drugs interact with lipids, or to see how lipids arrange themselves as the number to area ratios are varied. Langmuir–Blodgett troughs can be used for experiments in the fabrication of Langmuir–Blodgett films and the characterization of Langmuir films. LB films are now used as the building blocks of molecular electronics.Syed Arshad Hussain, D. Bhattacharjee (2009). Langmuir-Blodgett Films and Molecular Electronics; Modern Physics Letters B, vol. 23 No. 27, pp. 3437–3451 Troughs can be used to make films for the fabrication of nanoscale electronics such as graphene sheets (Li et al., 2008), and LCDs (Russell-Tanner, Takayama, Sugimura, DeSimone & Samulski, 2007). In addition films can be made of biological materials (Yang et al., 2002) to improve cell adhesion or study the properties of biofilms. An example of Langmuir–Blodgett troughs' utility in characterizing Langmuir films is the analysis of surface properties of quantum dots at the air-water interface.Ji, X., Wang, C., Xu, J., Zheng, J., Gattas- Asfura, K. M., & Leblanc, R. M. (2005). Surface chemistry studies of (cdse)zns quantum dots at the air-water interface. Langmuir, 21(12), 5377-5382. Surface of water has an immensely smooth nature that could be extended as large as the size of its container. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of water is 3.2 Å, as measured by X-ray reflectivity.Surface Roughness of Water Measured by X-Ray Reflectivity; A. Braslau, M. Deutsch, P. S. Pershan, A. H. Weiss, J. Als- Nielsen, J. Bohr, Phys. Rev. Lett.'1985', 54,114.

Purpose and origins  The Shulba Sutras are part of the larger corpus of texts called the Shrauta Sutras, considered to be appendices to the Vedas. They are the only sources of knowledge of Indian mathematics from the Vedic period. Unique fire-altar shapes were associated with unique gifts from the Gods. For instance, \\"he who desires heaven is to construct a fire-altar in the form of a falcon\\"; \\"a fire-altar in the form of a tortoise is to be constructed by one desiring to win the world of Brahman\\" and \\"those who wish to destroy existing and future enemies should construct a fire-altar in the form of a rhombus\\"., p. 387, \\"Certain shapes and sizes of fire-altars were associated with particular gifts that the sacrificer desired from the gods: 'he who desires heaven is to construct a fire-altar in the form of a falcon'; 'a fire-altar in the form of a tortoise is to be constructed by one desiring to win the world of Brahman'; 'those who wish to destroy existing and future enemies should construct a fire-altar in the form of a rhombus' [Sen and Bag 1983, 86, 98, 111].\\" The four major Shulba Sutras, which are mathematically the most significant, are those attributed to Baudhayana, Manava, Apastamba and Katyayana., p. 387 Their language is late Vedic Sanskrit, pointing to a composition roughly during the 1st millennium BCE. The oldest is the sutra attributed to Baudhayana, possibly compiled around 800 BCE to 500 BCE. Pingree says that the Apastamba is likely the next oldest; he places the Katyayana and the Manava third and fourth chronologically, on the basis of apparent borrowings., p. 4 According to Plofker, the Katyayana was composed after \\"the great grammatical codification of Sanskrit by Pāṇini in probably the mid-fourth century BCE\\", but she places the Manava in the same period as the Baudhayana., p.18 With regard to the composition of Vedic texts, Plofker writes, > The Vedic veneration of Sanskrit as a sacred speech, whose divinely revealed > texts were meant to be recited, heard, and memorized rather than transmitted > in writing, helped shape Sanskrit literature in general. … Thus texts were > composed in formats that could be easily memorized: either condensed prose > aphorisms (sūtras, a word later applied to mean a rule or algorithm in > general) or verse, particularly in the Classical period. Naturally, ease of > memorization sometimes interfered with ease of comprehension. As a result, > most treatises were supplemented by one or more prose commentaries …\\", p. 11 There are multiple commentaries for each of the Shulba Sutras, but these were written long after the original works. The commentary of Sundararāja on the Apastamba, for example, comes from the late 15th century CE, p. 6 and the commentary of Dvārakãnātha on the Baudhayana appears to borrow from Sundararāja., p. 50 According to Staal, certain aspects of the tradition described in the Shulba Sutras would have been \\"transmitted orally\\", and he points to places in southern India where the fire-altar ritual is still practiced and an oral tradition preserved., p. 111 The fire-altar tradition largely died out in India, however, and Plofker warns that those pockets where the practice remains may reflect a later Vedic revival rather than an unbroken tradition. Archaeological evidence of the altar constructions described in the Shulba Sutras is sparse. A large falcon-shaped fire altar (śyenaciti), dating to the second century BCE, was found in the excavations by G. R. Sharma at Kausambi, but this altar does not conform to the dimensions prescribed by the Shulba Sutras., p 19. Cover page of a treaty of Śulbasūtra by the Indian mathematician Kātyāyana around the 2nd century BCE. The content of the Shulba Sutras is likely older than the works themselves. The Satapatha Brahmana and the Taittiriya Samhita, whose contents date to the late second millennium or early first millennium BCE, describe altars whose dimensions appear to be based on the right triangle with legs of 15 pada and 36 pada, one of the triangles listed in the Baudhayana Shulba Sutra., p. 554, p. 362 Several Mathematicians and Historians mention that the earliest of the texts were written beginning in 800 BCE by Vedic Hindus based on compilations of an oral tradition dating back to 2000 BCE. It is possible, as proposed by Gupta, that the geometry was developed to meet the needs of ritual., p. 154 Some scholars go farther: Staal hypothesizes a common ritual origin for Indian and Greek geometry, citing similar interest and approach to doubling and other geometric transformation problems., pp. 106, 109-110 Seidenberg, followed by van der Waerden, sees a ritual origin for mathematics more broadly, postulating that the major advances, such as discovery of the Pythagorean theorem, occurred in only one place, and diffused from there to the rest of the world. Van der Waerden mentions that author of Sulbha sutras existed before 600 BCE and could not have been influenced by Greek geometry. While Boyer mentions Old Babylonian mathematics (c. 2000 BCE-1600 BCE) as a possible origin, however also states that Shulba sutras contain a formula not found in Babylon sources., p. 207, \\"We find rules for the construction of right angles by means of triples of cords the lengths of which form Pythagorean triages, such as 3, 4, and 5, or 5, 12, and 13, or 8, 15, and 17, or 12, 35, and 37. However all of these triads are easily derived from the old Babylonian rule; hence, Mesopotamian influence in the Sulvasutras is not unlikely. Aspastamba knew that the square on the diagonal of a rectangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the two adjacent sides, but this form of the Pythagorean theorem also may have been derived from Mesopotamia. ... So conjectural are the origin and period of the Sulbasutras that we cannot tell whether or not the rules are related to early Egyptian surveying or to the later Greek problem of altar doubling. They are variously dated within an interval of almost a thousand years stretching from the eighth century B.C. to the second century of our era.\\" KS Krishnan mentions that Shulba sutras predates Mesopotamian Pythagoras triples. Seidenberg argues that either \\"Old Babylonia got the theorem of Pythagoras from India or that Old Babylonia and India got it from a third source\\". Seidenberg suggests that this source might be Sumerian and may predate 1700 BC., p. 121 In contrast, Pingree cautions that \\"it would be a mistake to see in [the altar builders'] works the unique origin of geometry; others in India and elsewhere, whether in response to practical or theoretical problems, may well have advanced as far without their solutions having been committed to memory or eventually transcribed in manuscripts.\\", p. 5 Plofker also raises the possibility that \\"existing geometric knowledge [was] consciously incorporated into ritual practice\\"., p. 17  List of Shulba Sutras  # Apastamba # Baudhayana # Manava # Katyayana # Maitrayaniya (somewhat similar to Manava text) # Varaha (in manuscript) # Vadhula (in manuscript) # Hiranyakeshin (similar to Apastamba Shulba Sutras)  Mathematics = Pythagorean theorem and Pythagorean triples The sutras contain statements of the Pythagorean theorem, both in the case of an isosceles right triangle and in the general case, as well as lists of Pythagorean triples., pp. 232-238 In Baudhayana, for example, the rules are given as follows: > 1.9. The diagonal of a square produces double the area [of the square]. > [...] > 1.12. The areas [of the squares] produced separately by the lengths of the > breadth of a rectangle together equal the area [of the square] produced by > the diagonal. > 1.13. This is observed in rectangles having sides 3 and 4, 12 and 5, 15 and > 8, 7 and 24, 12 and 35, 15 and 36., pp. 388–389 Similarly, Apastamba's rules for constructing right angles in fire-altars use the following Pythagorean triples:, p. 207 * (3, 4, 5) * (5, 12, 13) * (8, 15, 17) * (12, 35, 37) In addition, the sutras describe procedures for constructing a square with area equal either to the sum or to the difference of two given squares. Both constructions proceed by letting the largest of the squares be the square on the diagonal of a rectangle, and letting the two smaller squares be the squares on the sides of that rectangle. The assertion that each procedure produces a square of the desired area is equivalent to the statement of the Pythagorean theorem. Another construction produces a square with area equal to that of a given rectangle. The procedure is to cut a rectangular piece from the end of the rectangle and to paste it to the side so as to form a gnomon of area equal to the original rectangle. Since a gnomon is the difference of two squares, the problem can be completed using one of the previous constructions., pp. 243-246  Geometry  The Baudhayana Shulba sutra gives the construction of geometric shapes such as squares and rectangles., pp. 388-391 It also gives, sometimes approximate, geometric area- preserving transformations from one geometric shape to another. These include transforming a square into a rectangle, an isosceles trapezium, an isosceles triangle, a rhombus, and a circle, and transforming a circle into a square. In these texts approximations, such as the transformation of a circle into a square, appear side by side with more accurate statements. As an example, the statement of circling the square is given in Baudhayana as: > 2.9. If it is desired to transform a square into a circle, [a cord of > length] half the diagonal [of the square] is stretched from the centre to > the east [a part of it lying outside the eastern side of the square]; with > one-third [of the part lying outside] added to the remainder [of the half > diagonal], the [required] circle is drawn., p. 391 and the statement of squaring the circle is given as: > 2.10. To transform a circle into a square, the diameter is divided into > eight parts; one [such] part after being divided into twenty-nine parts is > reduced by twenty-eight of them and further by the sixth [of the part left] > less the eighth [of the sixth part]. > 2.11. Alternatively, divide [the diameter] into fifteen parts and reduce it > by two of them; this gives the approximate side of the square [desired]. The constructions in 2.9 and 2.10 give a value of π as 3.088, while the construction in 2.11 gives π as 3.004., p. 392, \\"The 'circulature' and quadrature techniques in 2.9 and 2.10, the first of which is illustrated in figure 4.4, imply what we would call a value of π of 3.088, [...] The quadrature in 2.11, on the other hand, suggests that π = 3.004 (where s = 2r\\\\cdot13/15), which is already considered only 'approximate.' In 2.12, the ratio of a square's diagonal to its side (our \\\\sqrt{2}) is considered to be 1 + 1/3 + 1/(3·4) - 1/(3·4·34) = 1.4142.  Square roots  Altar construction also led to an estimation of the square root of 2 as found in three of the sutras. In the Baudhayana sutra it appears as: > 2.12. The measure is to be increased by its third and this [third] again by > its own fourth less the thirty-fourth part [of that fourth]; this is [the > value of] the diagonal of a square [whose side is the measure]. which leads to the value of the square root of two as being: :\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\approx 1 + \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{3 \\\\cdot 4} - \\\\frac{1}{3 \\\\cdot4 \\\\cdot 34} = \\\\frac{577}{408} = 1.4142..., p. 392, p. 200 Indeed, an early method for calculating square roots can be found in some Sutras, the method involves the recursive formula: \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{x-1} + \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{x-1}} for large values of x, which bases itself on the non-recursive identity \\\\sqrt{a ^2+ r} \\\\approx a + \\\\frac{r}{2 \\\\cdot a} for values of r extremely small relative to a. It has also been suggested, for example by Bürk, p. 575 that this approximation of √2 implies knowledge that √2 is irrational. In his translation of Euclid's Elements, Heath outlines a number of milestones necessary for irrationality to be considered to have been discovered, and points out the lack of evidence that Indian mathematics had achieved those milestones in the era of the Shulba Sutras., p. 364: \\"As [Heinrich] Vogt says, three stages had to be passed through before the irrationality of the diagonal of a square was discovered in any real sense. (1) All values found by direct measurement of calculations based thereon have to be recognized as being inaccurate. Next (2) must supervene the conviction that it is impossible to arrive at an accurate arithmetical expression of the value. And lastly (3) the impossibility must be proved. Now there is no real evidence that the Indians, at the date in question, had even reached the first stage, still less the second or third.\\"  See also  *Kalpa (Vedanga)  Citations and footnotes  References       * *  Translations  * \\"The Śulvasútra of Baudháyana, with the commentary by Dvárakánáthayajvan\\", by George Thibaut, was published in a series of issues of The Pandit.

The NASA Technical Manager was Richard Palace. The device was designed to conduct three experiments, two of which failed. The first failed one was intended to test seed growth in microgravity in an unconventional way—by germinating seeds on a spinning disc. The degree of artificial gravity on the spinning wheel is highest (0.25 g or 2.5 m/s²) at its rim and lowest at its center. Using this fact, the influence of different levels of gravity on seed germination could be determined by placing seeds at different radial locations on the disk. At the end of the mission, the growth was to be arrested. After return the orientation of the roots were to be used to determine the threshold of gravity at which a plant could determine which way was down. A second failed experiment on fluid dynamics was intended to measure the bulk oscillations of a drop of mercury immersed in a clear liquid. A short circuit prevented the seed and mercury drop experiments from functioning.https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19890001547_1989001547.pdf The payload also included a nuclear particle detection experiment.

A professor at the EHESS in Paris, he was a Marxist theorist. His wife was sociologist Annie Goldmann. Biography Goldmann was born in Bucharest, Romania, but grew up in Botoşani. He studied law at the University of Bucharest and the University of Vienna under the Austromarxist jurist Max Adler.Martin Jay, Marxism and Totality: The Adventures of a Concept from Lukács to Habermas, University of California Press, 1984, pp. 305–06. In 1934, he went to the University of Paris to study political economy, literature, and philosophy. He moved to Switzerland in November 1942, where he was placed in a refugee camp until 1943. Through Jean Piaget's intervention, he was subsequently given a scholarship to the University of Zurich, where he completed his PhD in philosophy in 1945 with a thesis entitled Mensch, Gemeinschaft und Welt in der Philosophie Immanuel Kants (Man, Community and world in the Philosophy of Immanuel Kant). Philosophy While many Parisian leftists staunchly upheld Marxism's \\"scientificity\\" in the 1950s and 1960s, Lucien Goldmann insisted that Marxism was by then in severe crisis and had to reinvent itself radically if it were to survive. He rejected the traditional Marxist view of the proletariat and contested the structural Marxist movement. In fact, the popularity of such trends on the Left Bank was one reason why Goldmann's own name and work were eclipsed — this despite the acclaim of thinkers as diverse as Jean Piaget and Alasdair MacIntyre, who called him \\"the finest and most intelligent Marxist of the age.\\" He refused to portray his aspirations for humanity's future as an inexorable unfolding of history's laws, but saw them rather as a wager akin to Blaise Pascal's in the existence of God. \\"Risk\\", Goldmann wrote in his classic study of Pascal's Pensées and Jean Racine's Phèdre, \\"is possibility of failure, hope of success, and the synthesis of the three in a faith which is a wager are the essential constituent elements of the human condition\\". He called his work \\"dialectical\\" and \\"humanist\\". He sought to synthesize the genetic epistemology of Piaget with the Marxism of György Lukács.\\"Genetic structuralism and the analysis of social consciousness\\"; accessed 3 July 2020. Goldmann founded the theory of genetic structuralism in the 1960s. He was a humanist socialist, a disciple of György Lukács, and was best known for his sociology of literature.

A certain excitation wavelength is selected, and the emission is observed either at a single wavelength, or a scan is performed to record the intensity versus wavelength, also called an emission spectrum. The instrument is used in fluorescence spectroscopy. Operation Generally, spectrofluorometers use high intensity light sources to bombard a sample with as many photons as possible. This allows for the maximum number of molecules to be in an excited state at any one point in time. The light is either passed through a filter, selecting a fixed wavelength, or a monochromator, which allows a wavelength of interest to be selected for use as the exciting light. The emission is collected at the perpendicular to the emitted light. The emission is also either passed through a filter or a monochromator before being detected by a photomultiplier tube, photodiode, or charge-coupled device detector. The signal can either be processed as digital or analog output. Systems vary greatly and a number of considerations affect the choice. The first is the signal-to-noise ratio. There are many ways to look at the signal to noise of a given system but the accepted standard is by using the Raman signal of water. Sensitivity or detection limit is another specification to be considered, that is how little light can be measured. The standard would be fluorescein in NaOH, typical values for a high end instrument are in the femtomolar range.

L.: Geometry Revisited. Washington, DC: Math. Assoc. Amer., p. 59, 1967 More specifically, let A, B, C and D be four points on a circle such that the lines AC and BD are perpendicular. Denote the intersection of AC and BD by M. Drop the perpendicular from M to the line BC, calling the intersection E. Let F be the intersection of the line EM and the edge AD. Then, the theorem states that F is the midpoint AD. Proof Proof of the theorem. We need to prove that AF = FD. We will prove that both AF and FD are in fact equal to FM. To prove that AF = FM, first note that the angles FAM and CBM are equal, because they are inscribed angles that intercept the same arc of the circle. Furthermore, the angles CBM and CME are both complementary to angle BCM (i.e., they add up to 90°), and are therefore equal. Finally, the angles CME and FMA are the same. Hence, AFM is an isosceles triangle, and thus the sides AF and FM are equal. The proof that FD = FM goes similarly: the angles FDM, BCM, BME and DMF are all equal, so DFM is an isosceles triangle, so FD = FM. It follows that AF = FD, as the theorem claims.

The handbook is published once during each three-year Parliament by the Parliamentary Library of Australia, within the Department of Parliamentary Services, under the authority of the Parliament. The first edition of the Handbook was published in 1915, and was titled Biographical Handbook and Record of Elections for the Parliament of the Commonwealth. This followed a resolution of the Joint Library Committee ordering the publication of a handbook, giving political biographies of all members of both Houses since Federation in 1901, \\"with other information likely to be useful.\\" Since 1915 there have been 30 editions of the Handbook. An edition of the Handbook has been published after every federal election since 1917, except for those of 1928 (when there was another election the following year), 1940 and 1943 (due to wartime printing restrictions), 1946 and 1949 (for unknown reasons) and 1954 (another very short Parliament). The edition published in 1976 was described as a \\"supplement to the 19th edition,\\" published in 1975. Until the election of the Whitlam Labor government in 1972, the Handbook was officially titled the Commonwealth Parliamentary Handbook. Whitlam's desire to replace the phrase \\"Commonwealth of Australia\\" with the word \\"Australia\\" in all official usages led to the renaming of the Handbook's 18th edition in 1973 as the Australian Parliamentary Handbook. The Fraser Liberal government renamed the Handbook Parliamentary Handbook of the Commonwealth of Australia. For many years the Handbook was the only readily accessible source of statistical information about elections to the Australian Parliament. Since the 1970s, however, these have been published separately by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and are now easily accessible at the AEC website (current elections only) or at Adam Carr's Election Archive (all elections since 1901). The modern Handbook contains full biographies of all Members and Senators, details of the Ministry and Shadow Ministry, membership of all Parliamentary committees, statistical information on the composition of the Parliament, summaries of recent election results, the text of the Australian Constitution, results of referendums to change the Constitution, and historical information including the names and career details of all Members and Senators since 1901.

From later in 1936 to April 1961 it was the official paper of the Peace Pledge Union (PPU), and from 1990 to 2004 was co-published with War Resisters' International. History=Founding and early days Peace News was begun by Humphrey Moore who was a Quaker and in 1933 had become editor of the National Peace Council's publications. Working with a peace group in Wood Green, London, Moore and his wife, Kathleen (playing the role of business manager), launched Peace News with a free trial issue in June 1936. With distribution through Moore’s contacts with the National Peace Council, the new magazine rapidly attracted attention. Within six weeks, Dick Sheppard, founder of the Peace Pledge Union, proposed to Moore that Peace News should become the PPU’s paper.Harry Mister, \\"Humphrey Moore 1909-1995\\" , Peace News No. 2395.Harry Mister and Stephen Moore, \\"Brave Fighter for Peace\\" (obituary of Humphrey Moore). The Guardian, September 1995, p. 16. Early contributors to this new organ of the PPU included Mohandas Gandhi, George Lansbury, and illustrator Arthur Wragg. Peace News also had a large number of women contributors, including Vera Brittain, Storm Jameson, Rose Macaulay, Ethel Mannin, Ruth Fry, Kathleen Lonsdale and Sybil Morrison.Gail Chester and Andrew Rigby, Articles of Peace: Celebrating Fifty Years of Peace News. Prism, 1986, pp. 131–33. Some contributors were so sympathetic to the grievances of Nazi Germany that one sceptical member found it difficult to distinguish between letters to Peace News and those in the newspaper of the British Union of Fascists.Frank McDonough, Neville Chamberlain, Appeasement, and the British Road to War, Manchester University Press, 1998 The historian Mark Gilbert has argued that \\"With the exception of Action, the journal of the British Union of Fascists, it is hard to think of another British newspaper which was so consistent an apologist for Nazi Germany as Peace News.\\"Mark Gilbert, \\"Pacifist attitudes to Nazi Germany, 1936-45\\", Journal of Contemporary History, January 1992, Vol. 27, pp. 493–511. However, Juliet Gardiner has noted that Peace News also urged the British government to give sanctuary to Jewish refugees from Nazism.Juilet Gardiner, The Thirties: An Intimate History. HarperPress, 2010, p. 501. The fact that some PN contributors were supporting appeasement and excusing Nazi actions caused PN contributor David Spreckley to express fears that \\"in their scramble for peace\\", they were gaining \\"some questionable allies\\".Peace News, 10 November 1939 (p. 9), quoted in Martin Ceadel, Semi-Detached Idealists:the British Peace Movement and International Relations, 1854-1945 Oxford University Press, 2000 (p. 398). Sales of Peace News peaked at around 40,000 during the so-called Phoney War between September 1939 and May 1940. In that month in the face of demands in parliament for the banning of the paper, the printer and distributors stopped working with Peace News. However, with help from the typographer Eric Gill, Hugh Brock and many others, Moore continued to publish Peace News and arrange for distribution around the UK. Humphrey Moore’s emphasis on Peace News having a single-minded anti-war policy was increasingly being challenged. Others wanted greater emphasis on building a peaceful society once hostilities ended. In 1940 the PPU asked Moore to step aside in the post of assistant editor (which post he held until 1944), and appointed John Middleton Murry as editor.\\"Peace News\\" in Peter Barberis, John McHugh & Mike Tyldesley (eds), Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations. Continuum, 2005, (p. 344). By 1946 Murry had abandoned pacifism and resigned. Hugh Brock took on the role of assistant editor of Peace News in 1946 and became editor in 1955, lasting until 1964. During his period of tenure the magazine separated from the PPU as it had widened its focus into areas not directly related to absolute pacifism.

James and Ranjana Ash to form the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination. Throughout the 1960s, Peace News covered issues such as opposition to the Vietnam War and the Biafran issue in the Nigerian Civil War. The magazine's coverage of the Vietnam War was notable for its support for the protests of the Vietnamese Buddhists, who it argued could become a nonviolent \\"Third Force\\" independent of both the Saigon and Hanoi governments.Chester and Rigby, p. 19.

In 1974, the paper moved its main office to Nottingham, where it remained until 1990. In 1978, one worker at Housmans was injured after a bomb was sent to the Peace News offices, (allegedly by the neo-Nazi organisation Column 88) as part of a series of attacks on left-wing organisations (similar attacks were made on the Socialist Workers Party and Anti-Nazi League offices before this occurred).\\"Bomb Explodes at Peace News\\", Irish Times, 5 July 1978, p. 7. Peace News suspended publication at the end of 1987, intending to relaunch after a period of rethinking and planning. In May 1989 the paper resumed publication, but quickly ran into financial difficulties. In 1990 it became linked to War Resisters' International and was co-published as a monthly until 1999, then as a quarterly with a British-orientated Nonviolent Action published in the intervening months.

In 1972 Peace News co-editor Howard Clark, after meeting activists from the Canadian Greenpeace boats, initiated the group that became London Greenpeace, at first campaigning against French nuclear tests. In 1973 Peace News played a central role in launching the British Withdrawal from Northern Ireland Campaign (BWNIC) and in supporting the \\"BWNIC 14\\", fourteen activists, including a member of the Peace News collective, charged with \\"conspiracy to incite disaffection\\" via a leaflet \\"Some Information for Discontented Soldiers\\". After an 11-week trial, a jury acquitted the BWNIC 14 in 1975, although two members of Peace News collective were fined for helping two AWOL soldiers go to Sweden.\\"British Withdrawal from Northern Ireland Campaign\\" in Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations by Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley. London : Continuum, 2005, (p.330). In 1974, together with Nicholas Albery of BIT Information Service, Peace News began publishing the Community Levy for Alternative Projects, an invitation to supply funds for, generally, fledgling alternative projects, partly targeting shops and businesses that identified with counter-cultural ideas and aspirations.Peter Shipley,Revolutionaries in Modern Britain, Bodley Head, 1976, (p. 203) In August 1974, Peace News published a special edition revealing and printing in full Colonel David Stirling's plans to establish a strike-breaking \\"private army\\", \\"Great Britain 1975\\". By arrangement The Guardian led with this story on the day of publication, Peace News won the 1974 \\"Scoop of the Year\\" award from Granada Television.Chester and Rigby, p. 23.Stephen Dorril and Robin Ramsey, Smear! Wilson and the Secret State, Fourth Estate, 1991, p. 267. In 1978, Peace News, together with The Leveller magazine revealed the identity of Colonel B, a witness in the ABC Trial. Peace News fought its conviction for \\"contempt of court\\" right up to appeal in the House of Lords, where the Lord Chief Justice's \\"guilty\\" verdict was finally overturned. In 1995, Peace News, together with Campaign Against Arms Trade, was sued for libel by the Covert & Operational Procurement Exhibition (COPEX) for repeating allegations that the exhibition was serving as a meeting place for buyers and sellers of torture implements. The High Court struck out the case when COPEX failed to show in court and the peace groups were awarded costs. \\"In 1995/96, PN successfully fought off a libel case brought by COPEX, a British high tech and arms exhibition organiser.\\" \\"10.3.

J.; Owsley, D. C.; Nelke, J. M. Org. React. 1976, 23. The acyloin condensation The reaction is most successful when R is aliphatic and saturated. The reaction is performed in aprotic solvents with a high boiling point, such as benzene and toluene in an oxygen free atmosphere of nitrogen (as even traces of oxygen interfere with the reaction path and reduce the yield). The use of protic solvents results in the Bouveault-Blanc reduction of the separate esters rather than condensation. Depending on ring size and steric properties, but independent from high dilution, the acyloin condensation of diesters favours intramolecular cyclisation over intermolecular polymerisation when diesters are used (see below). To account for such cyclisation, it is suggested that the ends, where ester groups are present, are adsorbed, albeit weakly, at nearby sites on the sodium metal. Thus, the reactive ends are not available for polymerisation, thereby decreasing competition for the cyclisation process. Diesters possessing 10 or more carbons undergo cyclisation very easily.REACTIONS, REARRANGEMENTS, AND REAGENTS by S N Sanyal, Bharati Bhavan publishers, .  Acyloin cyclization of diesters  The acyloin condensation The cyclization of diesters by intramolecular acyloin condensation is a classical approach for the synthesis of aliphatic ring systems. In general, compared to other cyclization reactions that proceed under basic conditions like the Ziegler-Thorpe and Dieckmann ring formation methods, the acyloin synthesis is suitable for more ring sizes, especially when the Rühlmann method is used to trap the cyclization product as the bis(trimethylsiloxy)alkene (enediol disilyl ether). Although 3-membered rings are not accessible through the acyloin condensation, 5- and 6-membered rings form in high yield (80 – 85% yield), 4-, 7-, 10-, and 11-membered rings form in moderate yield (50 – 60% yield), 8- and 9-membered rings form in poor to modest yield (30 – 40% yield), and finally, 12-membered and higher rings form in good to excellent yields (>70% yield). Although yields for 4-membered and medium-sized rings are poor to moderate, the acyloin condensation constitutes one of the earliest practical cyclization reactions to prepare these challenging ring sizes. In comparison, the Dieckmann method is practical only for 5- to 8-membered rings (with modest yields for 7- and 8-membered). The Thorpe method is more easily modified via high dilution (e.g., 0.001 M in benzene/ether) to enable the synthesis of large rings, but 4-membered and 9- to 13-membered rings are still not accessible. Concentration is much less important a factor for obtaining high yields for the acyloin condensation, as the reaction occurs on the surface of the sodium metal. Although, the need for sodium metal limits the functional group tolerance of the reaction, compared to more modern cyclization reactions (e.g. Yamaguchi esterification, ring- closing olefin metathesis), the acyloin condensation continues to be used in the synthesis of complex natural products for the preparation of challenging ring systems.  Mechanism The mechanism consists of four steps: :(1) Oxidative ionization of two sodium atoms on the double bond of two ester molecules. :(2) Free radical coupling between two molecules of the homolytic ester derivative (A Wurtz type coupling). Alkoxy-eliminations in both sides occur, producing a 1,2-diketone. :(3) Oxidative ionization of two sodium atoms on both diketone double bonds. The sodium enodiolate is formed. :(4) Neutralization with water to form the enodiol, which tautomerizes to acyloin. Acyloin condensation :The acyloin condensation Variations=Rühlmann- method The method according to Rühlmann employs trimethylchlorosilane as a trapping reagent; by this, competing reactions are efficiently subdued. Generally, yields increase considerably. The hydrolytic cleavage of the silylether gives the acyloin. To achieve a mild cleavage methanol can be used in several cases. Rühlmann-method Usually toluene, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or acyclic dialkylethers are employed as solvents. Advantageously also N-methyl- morpholine has been used. It allowed in some cases a successful reaction, in which otherwise the reaction failed in less polar media.

Geography  The west of the municipality is largely mountainous, with much of the western coastline rising steeply a little way inland. Numerous miradors (viewpoints) on this high ground offer views of the island, with the most well known being the Mirador del Río which is a popular tourist attraction. To the southeast the land is low-lying and largely used for agriculture, with many small beach resorts along the coast. The northeast of the municipality is largely uninhabited, having been buried approximately 3000 years ago by the eruption of the Montaña Corona which formed the inhospitable Malpais de la Corona. This eruption also produced extensive hollow lava tunnels called jameos, some of which have been developed into two of the island's most-visited geological attractions: the Cueva de los Verdes and the Jameos del Agua.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers, Minnesota Twins, and Baltimore Orioles. Hardy attended Sabino High School in Tucson, Arizona where he was an All-State selection from 1999 to 2001 and an All-American selection in 2001. Hardy was originally drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the second round of the 2001 Amateur Draft. Early life Hardy played baseball at Sabino High School in Arizona, and was captain of the \\"Sabercats\\" baseball team. He was an All-State Selection in 1999, 2000, and 2001, and was All-American in 2001. Also in 2001, he was a member of the U.S. Junior National team, which won the silver medal in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Baseball career=Milwaukee Brewers He was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers during the second round of the 2001 draft. In 2003, he played for the U.S. Olympic Qualifying team. He participated in MLB All-Star Futures Game in 2003. Hardy suffered a dislocated shoulder and a torn labrum in 2004 in the minor leagues and sat out the year. =2005= He went into spring training in 2005 as the frontrunner to win the starting shortstop job. Although he got off to a very slow start, Hardy finished strong and ended the year with a .247 batting average, 9 home runs and 50 RBIs. Hardy committed only 10 errors in the field, but also had the lowest range factor of all major league shortstops (3.76). =2006= On May 16, 2006, Hardy slid into Philadelphia Phillies catcher Sal Fasano at home plate trying to score and badly injured his ankle when Fasano attempted to block the plate. X-rays revealed a severe sprain of the ankle, and he was placed on the 15-day disabled list. Hardy recovered from the sprain, but constantly had trouble with an ankle tendon that kept popping in and out of place. On July 18, the Brewers announced that Hardy would have season-ending surgery on his ankle, performed by team physician Dr. William Raasch. Hardy finished the year with an average of .242 with 5 home runs and 14 RBI. =2007= By June 27, 2007, Hardy had already doubled his career home run total. He ended up batting .277 with 26 home runs, and 80 RBIs. He was selected to play as a reserve in the 2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, held in San Francisco. He played in the ninth inning and was walked on his first and only plate appearance. =2008= Hardy during his tenure with the Milwaukee Brewers in 2008. As of the end of the 2008 season, Hardy was batting .283, with 2 stolen bases, 24 home runs, and 74 RBI. He had a 16-game hitting streak, which was broken on July 5 with a sacrifice bunt in order to aid the Brewers in defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates. For the week of July 7, he was the National League Player of the Week. =2009= Hardy was re-signed by the Brewers to a one-year, $4.65 million contract. After a low-performing season through July, he was optioned to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds on August 12. His line-drive rate had declined for five consecutive seasons prior to his demotion. He was recalled on September 1 and finished the season batting .229 with 11 HRs and 47 RBI. Minnesota Twins On November 6, 2009, Hardy was traded from the Brewers to the Minnesota Twins in exchange for outfielder Carlos Gómez.http://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=4629260 He spent some time on the disabled list during the course of the 2010 season, but did end up playing over 100 games for the Twins and hit .268 for the season. Baltimore Orioles J.J. Hardy batting for the Orioles On December 9, 2010, Hardy was traded to the Baltimore Orioles from the Twins, along with utility infielder Brendan Harris and $500,000, for minor league pitchers Brett Jacobson and Jim Hoey. =2011= Hardy had a career resurgence and had a strong 2011 campaign. On July 16, 2011, Hardy agreed on a three-year deal to remain with the Orioles through 2014.http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/6775622/baltimore- orioles-jj-hardy-agree-3-year-contract Hardy finished the season with 30 HR and 80 RBI. He also hit .269. =2012= Hardy won his first Gold Glove in 2012 finishing with a .992 fielding percentage, 68 RBIs, 22 home runs, and a .238 batting average. He helped the Orioles to their first MLB postseason berth since 1997 with the second MLB Wild Card Game spot. The Orioles won the one-game playoff, but lost in the 2012 ALDS to the New York Yankees. =2013= In 2013, Hardy won his second Gold Glove Award and his first Silver Slugger award as the best offensive player at his position. His teammates, third baseman Manny Machado and center fielder Adam Jones, also won 2013 Gold Glove Awards. From 2011 to 2013, his 77 home runs led all major league shortstops. =2014= In 2014, Hardy battled back injuries and spent time on the DL during the beginning of the season. 2014 also showed a decline in Hardy's power, and he only hit nine homeruns in over 140 games. In the 2014 ALDS, Hardy hit a solo homerun off of Detroit Tigers pitcher Max Scherzer, his first career postseason homerun. Hardy slashed .240/.321/.400 in seven postseason games. JJ Hardy rounds third base after hitting a solo home run in Game 1 of the 2014 American League Division Series. On October 9, 2014, Hardy agreed to a 3-year, $40 million extension with the Orioles. On November 4, 2014, Hardy won his third consecutive Gold Glove Award for a shortstop. With this award, he passed Orioles great Cal Ripken Jr. for the second-most Gold Gloves won by an Orioles shortstop. He trails Mark Belanger who won eight of these awards. =2015= Hardy spent the first month of the 2015 season on the DL. He made his season debut on May 7 against the New York Yankees. In his fourth game back, Hardy went 2-for-4 and hit his first homerun of the season. On July 17, Hardy started a consecutive games hit streak. On July 29, he extended the hit streak to twelve games with a solo homerun. At that point in the streak, he was 13-for-42 (.310), with two homeruns, seven RBIs, and thirteen runs scored. Hardy extended the streak to thirteen with a 2-out single in the sixth inning the next night against the Tigers. On August 2, his streak ended at 15 games after he did not have a hit in a game against the Tigers. During the 15 games, Hardy collected 16 hits (.291 BAA), with two doubles, two homers, seven RBIs, and was walked twice. He raised his season batting average from .226 up to .240 during the stretch. Hardy finished 2015, a down year for him, with a batting average of .219 (90 hits), 8 homeruns, and 37 RBIs. His defense, however, was solid, as he only committed three errors in 114 games (994 innings) and 445 total chances. He turned 57 double plays, while also having a .993 fielding percentage with a range factor of 3.88. =2016= After a disappointing 2015 season in which Hardy was plagued with injuries, he hoped to come back healthy for the 2016 season. He entered the second year of his three-year contract. On April 12, Hardy homered twice in one game and drove in five runs in a 9–5 victory over the Boston Red Sox, which helped the Orioles improve to a franchise-best 7-0 record at the time. On May 1, Hardy fouled a ball off of his foot and was later removed from the game. He later got x-rays on his foot and was placed on the 15-day DL. On August 18, Hardy hit his 100th career home run as an Oriole in a game where he had three hits and two home runs. His 100th homer gave him sole possession of 2nd place on the Orioles all-time list for home runs as a shortstop, behind Oriole legend Cal Ripken Jr. who had 345 as a shortstop. It was Hardy's second multi-homer game of the year. On August 22, Hardy picked up his 1,400th career hit. Hardy hit a three-run home run on September 13 against the Red Sox, giving him his 256th extra-base hit as an Oriole, tying him for Rick Dempsey for 25th most in team history. He also tied teammate Manny Machado for 25th on the all-time Orioles home run list. Hardy finished the season with a .269/.309/.407 slash with a .716 OPS. He collected 38 extra-base hits while driving in 48 runs. He went 0-for-4 in a Wild Card Game loss to the AL East rival Toronto Blue Jays. =2017= Hardy entered 2017 healthy and collected his first hit of the season on April 7. On April 12, he surpassed former teammate Matt Wieters on the Orioles all-time hit list and moved into 40th place. On April 16, he moved into 49th place for most runs scored in franchise history. He also tied Wieters for 38th on the all-time franchise leader board for career doubles. On April 20, he surpassed Wieters on the franchise leader board for career doubles with his 158th with the Orioles. On June 18, Hardy was struck on the wrist by a 94 mph fastball from Cardinals pitcher Lance Lynn. It confirmed the next day that he had suffered a broken wrist and was placed on the 10-Day DL. He was moved to the 60-Day DL later in the year before returning to the Orioles in early September. He assumed the role of bench player after the emergence of Tim Beckham, who the Orioles had traded for earlier in the season. On September 24, the final home game of the year for the Orioles, Hardy collected two hits, including a homer, and received three standing ovations from the Orioles crowd in what was his last game as an Oriole at Camden Yards. On November 3, the Orioles declined Hardy's 2018 option. During his seven year tenure with the Orioles, Hardy played in 889 games, slashing .252/.293/.398 with a .690 OPS. He hit 107 home runs with the club and drove in 385 runs and played a crucial part in the Orioles quest to getting back to the postseason in 2012 for the first time in 14 years. He won three Gold Glove awards, earned a Silver Slugger and made an All-Star Game appearance as a starter in 2013. Family Hardy's father was a professional tennis player, and his mother was a professional golfer. Hardy's brother, Logan, was with the U.S. Army's 75th Field Artillery Brigade, a unit among the first to Baghdad in March 2003 during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Hardy married former University of Arizona softball player Adrienne Acton on December 7, 2013.

Tibbetts served as leader of the People's Progressive Movement party from 2003 to 2011. Tibbetts served as an elected member for the district of George Town, serving six terms in the Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands. Early life Tibbetts was born in Jamaica for medical reasons. After his birth, he returned to the family home in Cayman Brac until he was sent away to Jamaica for schooling at age 7, where he attended St. George's College, Jamaica. At age of 19, he moved to Grand Cayman and worked in the CIBC for one year. After this, he worked in a print shop for four years and then started his own printing business,Kurtr Tibbetts: Leadership in Difficult Times , Cayman Net News, 20 November 2001 which he had owned and managed for over twenty five years.Cayman Islands Government: Kurt Tibbetts The Tibbetts family originated in Cayman Brac and even though Tibbetts has spent much of his life in Grand Cayman, he also identifies strongly with the Sister Islands. Participation in the community In 1976, at just 22 years of age, he joined the Lions Club of Grand Cayman, serving as President in 1988, 1993 and 1994. His acumen for fund raising helped the club collect hundreds of thousands of dollars that were ploughed back into the community, mostly to augment government welfare programmes. During his tenure as President for the 1993–94 year was the launching of the Big Brothers, Big Sisters movement. He also helped introduce the Lions’ Benzarama fundraisers that brought country music legends Johnny Cash, Charlie Pride, Tanya Tucker, Ronnie Milsap, Don Williams and Ben E. King to the Cayman Islands. Tibbetts gratefully acknowledges the influence his Lions Club seniors had on him and emphasises that he is only one among many like-minded members. He values all the club's accomplishments and particularly the fellowship of its membership. Notably, it was the satisfaction Tibbetts gained from serving others that led to his decision to enter the political arena. Political career In 1988 he ran against other George Town politicians and came in fourth behind Truman Bodden at the time there were only three George Town representatives and he was not elected. It was Tibbetts' love for public service that first attracted him to politics. Concerned about constitutional matters and the welfare of the people, he decided to run as a candidate for the district of George Town in 1992. He won the seat with a large majority and has ably and endearingly represented the people of George Town and the Cayman Islands ever since. In 1992, following the creation of a fourth George Town seat, Tibbetts was elected fourth to the Legislative Assembly for the district of George Town. In November 1996 Tibbetts was elected first to the Legislative Assembly for the district of George Town and has continuously since. Tibbetts has also served on several Government Boards. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1998. During his first two terms in the Legislative Assembly Tibbetts proved to be a good constituency representative, a team player and an effective leader. It was therefore no surprise when he was elected to be the Leader of Government Business in November 2000. From November 2000 to November 2001 he served as the Leader of Government Business, as well as serving on Executive Councils (renamed Cabinet in 2003) as Minister for Planning, Communications and Works. On November 8, 2001 legislators led by McKeeva Bush voted to oust Tibbetts as Leader of Government Business saying he has not done enough to counter a slowing economy. Nine of the 15 elected legislators voted to remove Tibbetts as Leader of Government Business. Five voted against the motion, and one (Tibbetts) abstained. The vote came after 10 of the 15 elected legislators formed a new party that same day, The legislators, who had been independents, formed the new United Democratic Party, with Mckeeva Bush as their leader. As part of the changes to the Assembly's Executive Council, legislators also removed Tibbetts supporter Edna Moyle as minister of community development and women's affairs. Tibbetts said during debate on the motion that he had no choice but to accept the result of the vote, but said the islands should restructure the system so that the leadership cannot be so easily removed. From November 2001 until May 2005, Tibbetts served as the Leader of the Opposition. Following the political challenges of 2001, Mr. Tibbetts proved himself to be a statesman by devoting his talents to the task of political modernization of the Cayman Islands. First he assembled an able team and together they systematically went about creating a modern political organization based on widespread consultation and political education. Politics came of age in 2003 when the People's Progressive Movement (PPM) was inaugurated with Tibbetts as Leader of the PPM and Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition. For the first time in caymanian history, the election of May 2005 was keenly contested between two major parties, the PPM and the United Democratic Party. Following the People's Progressive Movement success in the Cayman Islands general election 2005, Tibbetts returned to serve as the Leader of Government Business and Minister for District Administration, Planning, Agriculture and Housing during the People's Progressive Movement administration from May 2005 to May 2009. Over the past years Tibbetts has openly advocated participatory democracy, governmental transparency, and governmental accountability. Tibbetts' major political accomplishments include the freedom of Information act, which for the first time in the caymanian history grants residents virtually unfettered access to the inner workings of government, the 2009 Cayman Islands Constitution, infrastructure and capital projects that he has been instrumental in creating, such as the construction of the Esterley Tibbetts Highway, The East-West Arterial and the New Government Administration Building. For two terms as an Opposition Member, he consolidated his understanding of the importance of medium- and long-term planning for the Islands, as well as the need for constitutional modernization to strengthen Cayman's democracy. Among his other accomplishments, he spearheaded the passage of the Constitution of the Cayman Islands. Tibbetts returned to opposition following the Cayman Islands general election, 2009. On 10 November 2010 Tibbetts announced that he would be stepping down as Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the People's Progressive Movement opposition front bench and on 12 February 2011, the People's Progressive Movement made history when it became the first political party in the Cayman Islands to transfer leadership. Tibbetts stepped down as Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the People's Progressive Movement and was replaced by Alden McLaughlin. In June 2010 Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II bestowed the designation Order of the British Empire OBE for his service to the Islands. Once again following the People's Progressive Movement success in the 2013 general elections, with the majority the progressives formed a new government. Tibbetts, was returned as first elected member for the district of George Town for the fifth consecutive time. Premier Alden McLaughlin appointed Tibbetts to serve in cabinet as Minister responsible for Planning, Lands, Agriculture, Housing and Infrastructure in the 2013 - 2017 People's Progressive Movement Administration. In March 2017 Tibbetts announced that after six terms and 25 years in office he would not seek re-election and his retirement from politics in the Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands prior to the 2017 general elections. Family and personal life He married Shirley-Ann Tibbetts in 1984 and they have three children: daughters Jacynth and Janelle, and son Jared. Tibbetts was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 Queen Elizabeth II Birthday Honours for his contributions to politics, his success in business and his community service. Tibbetts also serves as a justice of the peace.

The Army accused Chief Committee Counsel Roy Cohn of pressuring the Army to give preferential treatment to G. David Schine, a former McCarthy aide and friend of Cohn's. McCarthy counter-charged that this accusation was made in bad faith and in retaliation for his recent aggressive investigations of suspected Communists and security risks in the Army. Chaired by Senator Karl Mundt, the hearings convened on March 16, 1954, and received considerable press attention, including gavel-to-gavel live television coverage on ABC and DuMont (April 22–June 17). The media coverage, particularly television, greatly contributed to McCarthy's decline in popularity and his eventual censure by the Senate the following December. Background McCarthy came to national prominence in February 1950 after giving a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, in which he claimed to have a list of 205 State Department employees who were members of the Communist Party. McCarthy claimed the list was provided to and dismissed by then-Secretary of State Dean Acheson, saying that the \\"State Department harbors a nest of Communists and Communist sympathizers who are helping to shape our foreign policy\\". In January 1953, McCarthy began his second term and the Republican Party regained control of the Senate; with the Republicans in the majority, McCarthy was made chairman of the Senate Committee on Government Operations. This committee included the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and the mandate of this subcommittee allowed McCarthy to use it to carry out his investigations of Communists in the government. McCarthy appointed 26-year-old Roy Cohn as chief counsel to the subcommittee and future Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy as assistant counsel, while reassigning Francis Flanagan to the ad hoc position of general counsel. In 1953, McCarthy's committee began inquiries into the United States Army, starting by investigating supposed Communist infiltration of the Army Signal Corps laboratory at Fort Monmouth. McCarthy's investigations were largely fruitless, but after the Army accused McCarthy and his staff of seeking special treatment for Private G. David Schine, a chief consultant to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and a close friend of Cohn's who had been drafted into the Army as a private the previous year, McCarthy claimed that the accusation was made in bad faith. Inquiry The Senate decided that these conflicting charges should be investigated and the appropriate committee to do this was the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, usually chaired by McCarthy. Since McCarthy was one of the targets of the hearings, Senator Karl Mundt (R-South Dakota) was reluctantly appointed to replace McCarthy as chairman of the subcommittee. John G. Adams was the Army's Counsel. Acting as Special Counsel was Joseph Welch of the Boston law firm of Hale & Dorr (now called WilmerHale). The hearings were broadcast nationally on the new ABC and DuMont networks, and in part by NBC. Francis Newton Littlejohn, the news director at ABC, made the decision to cover the hearings live, gavel-to-gavel. The televised hearings lasted for 36 days and an estimated 80 million people saw at least part of the hearings. Photograph Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin While the hearings went on, a photograph of Schine was introduced, and Joseph Welch accused Cohn of doctoring the image to show Schine alone with Army Secretary Robert T. Stevens. On the witness stand Cohn and Schine both insisted that the picture entered into evidence (Schine and Stevens alone) was requested by Stevens and that no one was edited out of the photograph. Welch then produced a wider shot of Stevens and Schine with McGuire AFB wing commander Colonel Jack Bradley standing to Schine's right. A fourth person also edited out of the picture (his sleeve was visible to Bradley's right in the Welch photograph) was identified as McCarthy aide Frank Carr.\\"National Affairs: Part of the Picture\\". Time. May 10, 1954. Hoover memo After the photograph was discredited, McCarthy produced a copy of a confidential letter he claimed was a January 26, 1951, memo written and sent by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, to Major General Alexander R. Bolling, warning Army Intelligence of subversives in the Army Signal Corps. McCarthy claimed the letter was in the Army files when Stevens became secretary in 1953, and that Stevens willfully ignored it.\\"National Affairs: The Bogus Letter\\". Time. May 17, 1954. Welch was the first to question the letter's validity, claiming that McCarthy's \\"purported copy\\" did not come from Army files; McCarthy stated he never received any document from the FBI, but when questioned on the stand by special Senate counsel Ray Jenkins and cross-examined by Welch, McCarthy, while admitting the document was given to him by an intelligence officer, refused to identify his source. Robert Collier, assistant to Ray Jenkins, read a letter from Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr., in which he stated that Hoover examined the document and that he neither wrote nor ordered the letter, and that no such copy existed in FBI files, rendering McCarthy's claims meritless, and the letter spurious. Homosexuality Though the hearings were primarily about government subversion, they occasionally took on accusations of a more taboo nature: a portion of the hearings assessed the security risk of homosexuals in government. The issue remained an undercurrent throughout the hearings. One such example of this undercurrent was an exchange between Senator McCarthy and Joseph Welch. Welch was questioning McCarthy staff member James Juliana about the unedited picture of Schine with Stevens and Bradley, asking him \\"Did you think this came from a Pixie?\\" (a type of camera popular at the time), at which point McCarthy asked to have the question re-read: :McCarthy. Will counsel [i.e. Welch] for my benefit define – I think he might be an expert on that – what a pixie is? :Welch. Yes. I should say, Mr. Senator, that a pixie is a close relative of a fairy. (Laughter from the chamber) Shall I proceed, sir? Have I enlightened you? :McCarthy. As I said, I think you may be an authority on what a pixie is. =Cohn, Schine and McCarthy= At least a portion of the Army's allegations were correct. Roy Cohn did take steps to request preferential treatment for Schine, going so far on at least one occasion to sign McCarthy's name without his knowledge on a request for Schine to have access to the Senators' Baths, a pool and steam room reserved exclusively for senators. The exact relationship between Cohn, McCarthy and Schine remains unknown. Cohn and Schine were certainly close, and rather than work out of the Senate offices, the two rented nearby office space and shared bills. McCarthy commented that Cohn was unreasonable in matters dealing with Schine. It is unclear if Schine ever had a romantic or sexual relationship with Cohn, who was a closeted homosexual. (Three years after the hearings, Schine married and eventually had six children.) Some have also suggested that McCarthy may have been homosexual, and was even possibly involved with Schine or Cohn. Joseph Welch confronts McCarthy Joseph N. Welch (left) being questioned by Senator Joseph McCarthy (right), June 9, 1954 In what played out to be the most dramatic exchange of the hearings, McCarthy responded to aggressive questioning from Army counsel Joseph Welch. On June 9, 1954, day 30 of the hearings, Welch challenged Cohn to give McCarthy's list of 130 subversives in defense plants to the office of the FBI and the Department of Defense \\"before the sun goes down\\". In response to Welch's challenge, McCarthy suggested that Welch should check on Fred Fisher, a young lawyer in Welch's own Boston law firm whom Welch had planned to have on his staff for the hearings. McCarthy then mentioned that Fisher had once belonged to the National Lawyers Guild (NLG), a group which Attorney General Brownell had called \\"the legal bulwark of the Communist Party\\". Welch revealed he had confirmed Fisher's former membership in the National Lawyers Guild approximately six weeks before the hearings started.\\"McCarthy will Boycott Inquiry Pending on Action on News Leak\\". The New York Times. April 16, 1954. pp. 1, 12. The Army charges were signed by its new special counsel, Joseph N. Welch. Mr. Welch today [April 15] confirmed news reports that he had relieved from duty his original second assistant, Frederick G. Fisher Jr., of his own Boston law office because of admitted previous membership in the National Lawyers Guild, which has been listed by Herbert Brownell Jr. the Attorney General, as a Communist front organization. Mr. Welch said he had brought in another lawyer, John Kimball Jr., from his Boston office to take Mr. Fisher's place. After Fisher admitted his membership in the National Lawyers Guild, Welch decided to send Fisher back to Boston. His replacement by another colleague on Welch's staff was also covered by The New York Times.\\"McCarthy will Boycott Inquiry Pending on Action on News Leak\\". The New York Times. April 16, 1954. pp. 1, 12. Welch then reprimanded McCarthy for his needless attack on Fisher, saying \\"Until this moment, Senator, I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.\\" McCarthy, accusing Welch of filibustering the hearing and baiting Cohn, dismissed Welch's dissertation and casually resumed his attack on Fisher, at which point Welch angrily cut him short: > Senator, may we not drop this? We know he belonged to the Lawyers Guild ... > Let us not assassinate this lad further, Senator; you've done enough. Have > you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of > decency? Welch excluded himself from the remainder of the hearings with a parting shot to McCarthy: \\"Mr. McCarthy, I will not discuss this further with you... You have seen fit to bring [the Fisher/NLG affair] out, and if there is a God in heaven, it will do neither you nor your cause any good! I will not discuss it further... You, Mr. Chairman, may as you will, call the next witness!\\" After Welch deferred to Chairman Mundt to call the next witness, the gallery burst into applause. Conclusion and aftermath Near the end of the hearings, McCarthy and Senator Stuart Symington (D-Missouri) sparred over the handling of secret files by McCarthy's staff. McCarthy staff director Frank Carr testified that everyone who worked on McCarthy's staff had access to classified files regardless of their level of security clearance. Symington hinted that some members of McCarthy's own staff might themselves be subversive and signed a document agreeing to take the stand in the hearings to reveal their names in return for McCarthy's signature on the same document agreeing to an investigation of his staff. But McCarthy, after calling Symington \\"Sanctimonious Stu\\", refused to sign the agreement, claiming it contained false statements, and called the accusations an \\"unfounded smear\\" on his men. He then rebuked Symington by saying \\"You're not fooling anyone!\\" But Symington retaliated with a prophetic remark of his own: \\"Senator, the American people have had a look at you now for six weeks; you're not fooling anyone, either.\\" In Gallup polls from January 1954, McCarthy's approval rating was at 50%, with only 29% disapproving. By June, both percentages had shifted by 16%, with more people (34% approving, 45% disapproving) now rejecting McCarthy and his methods. After hearing 32 witnesses and two million words of testimony, the committee concluded that McCarthy himself had not exercised any improper influence on Schine's behalf, but that Roy Cohn, McCarthy's chief counsel, had engaged in some \\"unduly persistent or aggressive efforts\\" for Schine. The conclusion also reported questionable behavior on the part of the Army: that Secretary Stevens and Army Counsel John Adams \\"made efforts to terminate or influence the investigation and hearings at Fort Monmouth\\", and that Adams \\"made vigorous and diligent efforts\\" to block subpoenas for members of the Army Loyalty and Screening Board \\"by means of personal appeal to certain members of the [McCarthy] committee\\". Before the official reports were released, Cohn had resigned as McCarthy's chief counsel, and Senator Ralph Flanders (R, Vermont) had introduced a resolution of censure against McCarthy in the Senate. Despite McCarthy's acquittal of misconduct in the Schine matter, the Army–McCarthy hearings ultimately became the main catalyst in McCarthy's downfall from political power. Daily newspaper summaries were increasingly unfavorable toward McCarthy, while television audiences witnessed firsthand the unethical tactics of the junior Senator from Wisconsin. On December 2, 1954, the Senate voted 67–22 to censure McCarthy, effectively eradicating his influence, though not expelling him from office. McCarthy continued to chair the Subcommittee on Investigations until January 3, 1955, the day the 84th United States Congress was inaugurated; Senator John L. McClellan (D-Arkansas) replaced McCarthy as chairman. Fred Fisher was relatively unaffected by McCarthy's charges and went on to become a partner in Boston's prestigious Hale & Dorr law firm and organized its commercial law department. He also served as president of the Massachusetts Bar Association and as chairman of many committees of the American and Boston bar associations. After his censuring, Senator McCarthy continued his anti- Communist oratory, often speaking to an empty or near-empty Senate chamber. Turning increasingly to alcohol, McCarthy died of hepatitis on May 2, 1957, at the age of 48.

The concept was originally created by Julius Herman Boeke to describe the coexistence of modern and traditional economic sectors in a colonial economy. Dual economies are common in less developed countries, where one sector is geared to local needs and another to the global export market. Dual economies may exist within the same sector, for example a modern plantation or other commercial agricultural entity operating in the midst of traditional cropping systems. Sir Arthur Lewis used the concept of a dualistic economy as the basis of his labour supply theory of rural-urban migration. Lewis distinguished between a rural low-income subsistence sector with surplus population, and an expanding urban capitalist sector (see Dual-sector model). The urban economy absorbed labour from rural areas (holding down urban wages) until the rural surplus was exhausted. A World Bank comparison of sectoral growth in Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana and Zimbabwe since 1965 provided evidence against the existence of a basic dual economy model. The research implied that a positive link existed between growth in industry and growth in agriculture. The authors argued that for maximum economic growth, policymakers should have focused on agriculture and services as well as industrial development.

She is known for her contributions to the theory of real number computation, for her invention of a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator, and for her efforts to increase the diversity of mathematics and computer science.  Early life and education  Blum was born to a Jewish family in New York City, where her mother was a science teacher. They moved to Venezuela when Blum was nine. After graduating from her Venezuelan high school at age 16, she studied architecture at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) beginning in 1959. With the assistance of Alan Perlis, she shifted fields to mathematics in 1960. She married Manuel Blum, then a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and transferred in 1961 to Simmons College, a private women's liberal arts college in Boston. Simmons did not have a strong mathematics program but she was eventually able to take Isadore Singer's mathematics classes at MIT, graduating from Simmons with a B.S. in mathematics in 1963. She received her Ph.D. in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1968. Her dissertation, Generalized Algebraic Theories: A Model Theoretic Approach, was supervised by Gerald Sacks. She had switched to being advised by Sacks after being unable to follow an earlier advisor in his move to Princeton University because, at the time, Princeton did not accept female graduate students.  Career  After completing her doctorate, Blum went to the University of California at Berkeley to work with Julia Robinson as a postdoctoral fellow and lecturer in mathematics. However, the department had no permanent positions for women, and after two years, her position as lecturer was not renewed. In 1971 she became one of the founders of the Association for Women in Mathematics. In 1973 she joined the faculty of Mills College, a women's college in the Oakland hills near Berkeley. In 1974 she founded the mathematics and computer science department at Mills, at that time the only computer science program at a women's college. She served as the head or co-head of the department for 13 years. From 1975 to 1978 she served as the third president of the Association for Women in Mathematics. In 1979 she was awarded an endowed professorship, the first Letts-Villard Chair at Mills. In 1983 Blum won a National Science Foundation Visiting Professorship for Women award to work with Michael Shub for two years at the CUNY Graduate Center. In 1987 she spent a year at IBM. In 1992 Blum became the deputy director of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), working there with its director William Thurston. After visiting the City University of Hong Kong in 1996–1998 to work on her book Complexity and Real Computation (during Hong Kong's handover from British to Chinese rule), she became a Distinguished Career Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 1999. At CMU, she took the philosophy that the low numbers of women majoring in computer science were in part caused by a vicious cycle: because there were few women, the women in computer science had fewer support networks (such as friends in the same major to help them with coursework) than men. And because these factors made being a computer scientist less pleasant and more difficult for the women, fewer women chose to major in computer science. Instead of the then-popular approach of changing the curriculum to be more application-centric in the hope of attracting women, she pushed to maintain a traditional computer science program but to change the culture surrounding the program to be more welcoming. In support of this goal, she founded the Women@SCS program at CMU, which provided both mentoring and outreach opportunities for women in computer science. Through this program, which came to be directed by Blum's student Carol Frieze, CMU was able to increase the proportion of women in the undergraduate computer science program to nearly 50%. Blum also founded Project Olympus at CMU, a business incubator program that led to many startups in Pittsburgh associated with CMU and its computer program. She resigned from CMU in 2018 (effective August 2019) after a change in management structure of Project Olympus led to sexist treatment of her and the exclusion of other women from project activities. Research The Blum Blum Shub pseudorandom number generator, published jointly by Blum, Manuel Blum, and Michael Shub, is based on the operation of squaring numbers modulo the products of two large primes. Its security can be reduced to the computational hardness assumption that integer factorization is infeasible. Blum is also known for the Blum–Shub–Smale machine, a theoretical model of computation over the real numbers. Blum and her co-authors, Michael Shub and Stephen Smale, showed that (analogously to the theory of Turing machines) one can define analogues of NP- completeness, undecidability, and universality for this model. For instance, in this model it is undecidable to determine whether a given point belongs to the Mandelbrot set. She published a book on the subject, and in 1990 she gave an address at the International Congress of Mathematicians on computational complexity theory and real computation. Recognition In 2002, Blum was selected to be a Noether Lecturer. In 2005, Blum was a recipient of the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring, given by president George W. Bush \\"for her efforts to mentor girls and women in technology fields where traditionally they are underrepresented\\". She was given the Simmons University 2018 Distinguished Alumnae Lifetime Achievement Award in 2018. Blum was elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1979. In 2012, Blum became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. In 2017 she was selected as a fellow of the Association for Women in Mathematics in the inaugural class.

It is also briefly mentioned in The Legend of the Condor Heroes, another novel also by Jin Yong. It is loosely based on Manichaeism, an actual gnostic religion which originated in Persia and spread to other parts of the world, including China. The cult is based on Bright Peak in the Kunlun Mountains and has several other bases spread throughout the land. Its most powerful skills are the \\"Heaven and Earth Great Shift\\" () and the \\"Martial Arts of the Holy Flame Tablets\\" (). Background in the novel In The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber, the Ming Cult is also known as the \\"Cult of Mani\\" () to martial artists in the jianghu but its more common name is \\"Mójiào\\" (), which literally means \\"Demonic Cult\\". The cult originated in Persia and spread to China in the seventh century. The cult is secretive and conducts its activities far away from the eyes of other sects in the wǔlín ( \\"martial artists' community\\"). Its founding principles also deviate largely from other sects. While others typically seek to achieve a dominant position in the wǔlín, the Ming Cult strongly adheres to its faith and laws, which revolve around the notion of \\"delivering humankind from suffering and eliminating evil\\". This is aptly summed up in a mantra widely repeated by its members, which goes: The cult is actually a righteous sect and not an evil cult as it is perceived in the wǔlín. Though it was welcomed during the Tang dynasty, it faces persecution later on by the government during the Song dynasty due to slanderous remarks made by its enemies in the imperial court. Apart from that, many martial artists and sects in the wǔlín who are unaware of the cult's real motives due to its conservative nature often speculate that it is inherently evil and start spreading rumors. The cult's image in society and in the wǔlín is adversely affected and marred, and it often struggles to survive in the face of powerful rivals who seek to destroy it. During the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty, the Ming Cult starts a rebellion to overthrow the corrupt Yuan government and restore peace and order. However, its objective is not echoed by other sects and the common people; conversely, it faces hostility from them. The six leading orthodox sects in the wǔlín – Shaolin, Wudang, Emei, Kunlun, Kongtong and Mount Hua – form an alliance to attack the cult at its headquarters on Bright Peak. The Ming Cult's newly elected leader, Zhang Wuji, resolves the conflict and opens the cult to the wǔlín for the first time. Views and attitudes towards the cult start to change for the better, and the cult earns strong support in its mission to topple the Yuan government. Zhang Wuji eventually passes the leadership of the Ming Cult to Yang Xiao and retires from the jianghu. Zhu Yuanzhang, a minor leader in the cult, betrays his fellows and unites all rebel factions in China under his control. He ultimately topples the Yuan dynasty, defeats his rivals such as Chen Youliang, and establishes the Ming dynasty. Organization The cult is headed by its leader, called the jiàozhǔ ( \\"Cult Master\\"). The Left and Right Bright Messengers () serve as the leader's deputies. The cult also has four Guardian Kings () who assist the leader in overseeing the cult's activities. Ranked below the Guardian Kings are the chiefs of the five banner divisions (). The five divisions are each named after one of the Five Elements (Earth, Fire, Water, Wood, Metal). The cult's members are spread throughout these five banners. The cult has headquarters and bases spread throughout the land and are often disguised as ordinary buildings, such as inns and shops, to avoid identification by the government. The cult's main headquarters, called the zǒngtán (), is based on Bright Peak () in the Kunlun Mountains. The Ming Cult's structure in Persia differs from the one in China. In Persia, the cult is led by a woman who is selected from three specially chosen virgins called \\"Holy Maidens\\" (). There are twelve Guardian Kings () instead of four. The Three Messengers (Wind, Cloud and Moon) are tasked with safekeeping the Holy Flame Tablets, the cult's most sacred artifacts. They are also the most powerful in martial arts of all the cult's members in Persia. Heavenly Eagle Cult The Heavenly Eagle Cult () was founded by one of the Ming Cult's Guardian Kings, \\"White Brows Eagle King\\" Yin Tianzheng. Yin left the Ming Cult in anger during its internal conflict and established his own sect. The Heavenly Eagle Cult does not follow the Ming Cult's original practices and customs but its members are still morally disciplined. The Heavenly Eagle Cult is often regarded as a branch of the Ming Cult and deemed to be as equally evil and unorthodox in the wulin because of Yin Tianzheng's affiliation with the Ming Cult. The Heavenly Eagle Cult merges with the Ming Cult after Yin Tianzheng's maternal grandson, Zhang Wuji, becomes the new leader of the Ming Cult. Connection to real-life Manichaeism The names Ming Jiao (; literally \\"Religion of Light\\") and Moni Jiao (; literally \\"Religion of Mani\\") were used in China during the Song dynasty to describe the faith practiced by Chinese adherents of Manichaeism such as the White Lotus.

The Wigner quasiprobability distribution (also called the Wigner function or the Wigner–Ville distribution after Eugene Wigner and Jean-André Ville) is a quasiprobability distribution. It was introduced by Eugene Wigner in 1932 to study quantum corrections to classical statistical mechanics. The goal was to link the wavefunction that appears in Schrödinger's equation to a probability distribution in phase space. It is a generating function for all spatial autocorrelation functions of a given quantum-mechanical wavefunction . Thus, it maps on the quantum density matrix in the map between real phase-space functions and Hermitian operators introduced by Hermann Weyl in 1927, ; H. Weyl, Gruppentheorie und Quantenmechanik (Leipzig: Hirzel) (1928); H. Weyl, The Theory of Groups and Quantum Mechanics (Dover, New York, 1931). in a context related to representation theory in mathematics (cf. Weyl quantization in physics). In effect, it is the Wigner–Weyl transform of the density matrix, so the realization of that operator in phase space. It was later rederived by Jean Ville in 1948 as a quadratic (in signal) representation of the local time- frequency energy of a signal,J. Ville, \\"Théorie et Applications de la Notion de Signal Analytique\\", Câbles et Transmission, 2, 61–74 (1948). effectively a spectrogram. In 1949, José Enrique Moyal, who had derived it independently, recognized it as the quantum moment-generating functional,J.E. Moyal, \\"Quantum mechanics as a statistical theory\\", Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, 45, 99–124 (1949). and thus as the basis of an elegant encoding of all quantum expectation values, and hence quantum mechanics, in phase space (cf. phase space formulation). It has applications in statistical mechanics, quantum chemistry, quantum optics, classical optics and signal analysis in diverse fields such as electrical engineering, seismology, time–frequency analysis for music signals, spectrograms in biology and speech processing, and engine design.  Relation to classical mechanics  A classical particle has a definite position and momentum, and hence it is represented by a point in phase space. Given a collection (ensemble) of particles, the probability of finding a particle at a certain position in phase space is specified by a probability distribution, the Liouville density. This strict interpretation fails for a quantum particle, due to the uncertainty principle. Instead, the above quasiprobability Wigner distribution plays an analogous role, but does not satisfy all the properties of a conventional probability distribution; and, conversely, satisfies boundedness properties unavailable to classical distributions. For instance, the Wigner distribution can and normally does take on negative values for states which have no classical model—and is a convenient indicator of quantum mechanical interference. (See below for a characterization of pure states whose Wigner functions are non-negative.) Smoothing the Wigner distribution through a filter of size larger than (e.g., convolving with a phase-space Gaussian, a Weierstrass transform, to yield the Husimi representation, below), results in a positive-semidefinite function, i.e., it may be thought to have been coarsened to a semi-classical one. Regions of such negative value are provable (by convolving them with a small Gaussian) to be \\"small\\": they cannot extend to compact regions larger than a few , and hence disappear in the classical limit. They are shielded by the uncertainty principle, which does not allow precise location within phase- space regions smaller than , and thus renders such \\"negative probabilities\\" less paradoxical.  Definition and meaning  The Wigner distribution of a pure state is defined as: {=}~\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi\\\\hbar}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\psi^*(x+y)\\\\psi(x-y)e^{2ipy/\\\\hbar}\\\\,dy\\\\, cellpadding= 6 border border colour = #0073CF background colour=#F9FFF7}} where is the wavefunction and and are position and momentum but could be any conjugate variable pair (e.g. real and imaginary parts of the electric field or frequency and time of a signal). Note that it may have support in even in regions where has no support in (\\"beats\\"). It is symmetric in and , : W(x,p)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi\\\\hbar}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\varphi^*(p+q)\\\\varphi(p-q)e^{-2ixq/\\\\hbar}\\\\,dq where is the normalized momentum-space wave function, proportional to the Fourier transform of . In 3D, : W(\\\\vec{r},\\\\vec{p}) = \\\\frac{1}{(2 \\\\pi)^3} \\\\int \\\\psi^*(\\\\vec{r} + \\\\hbar\\\\vec{s}/2) \\\\psi (\\\\vec{r} - \\\\hbar\\\\vec{s}/2) e^{i\\\\vec{p} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{s}} \\\\, d^3 s. In the general case, which includes mixed states, it is the Wigner transform of the density matrix, : W(x,p)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi\\\\hbar}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\langle x+y \\\\hat{\\\\rho} x-y \\\\rangle e^{-2ipy/\\\\hbar}\\\\,dy, where ⟨xψ⟩ = . This Wigner transformation (or map) is the inverse of the Weyl transform, which maps phase-space functions to Hilbert-space operators, in Weyl quantization. Thus, the Wigner function is the cornerstone of quantum mechanics in phase space. In 1949, José Enrique Moyal elucidated how the Wigner function provides the integration measure (analogous to a probability density function) in phase space, to yield expectation values from phase-space c-number functions uniquely associated to suitably ordered operators through Weyl's transform (cf. Wigner–Weyl transform and property 7 below), in a manner evocative of classical probability theory. Specifically, an operator's expectation value is a \\"phase-space average\\" of the Wigner transform of that operator, : \\\\langle \\\\hat{G} \\\\rangle =\\\\int! dx \\\\,dp~ W(x,p)~ g(x,p) ~.  Mathematical properties  The Wigner quasiprobability distribution for different energy eigenstates of the quantum harmonic oscillator: a) n = 0 (ground state), b) n = 1, c) n = 5\\\\. 1\\\\. W(x, p) is a real valued function. 2\\\\. The x and p probability distributions are given by the marginals: :: \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty dp\\\\,W(x,p)=\\\\langle x\\\\hat{\\\\rho}x \\\\rangle. If the system can be described by a pure state, one gets \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty dp\\\\,W(x,p)= \\\\psi(x)^2. :: \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty dx\\\\,W(x,p)=\\\\langle p\\\\hat{\\\\rho}p \\\\rangle. If the system can be described by a pure state, one has \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}dx\\\\,W(x,p)=\\\\varphi(p)^2. :: \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty dx\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty dp\\\\,W(x,p)=Tr(\\\\hat{\\\\rho}). : Typically the trace of the density matrix ρ̂ is equal to 1. 3\\\\. W(x, p) has the following reflection symmetries: :* Time symmetry: \\\\psi(x) \\\\rightarrow \\\\psi(x)^* \\\\Rightarrow W(x,p) \\\\rightarrow W(x,-p). :* Space symmetry: \\\\psi(x) \\\\rightarrow \\\\psi(-x) \\\\Rightarrow W(x,p) \\\\rightarrow W(-x,-p). 4\\\\. W(x, p) is Galilei-covariant: :: \\\\psi(x) \\\\rightarrow \\\\psi(x+y) \\\\Rightarrow W(x,p) \\\\rightarrow W(x+y,p). : It is not Lorentz covariant. 5\\\\. The equation of motion for each point in the phase space is classical in the absence of forces: :: \\\\frac{\\\\partial W(x,p)}{\\\\partial t}=\\\\frac{-p}{m}\\\\frac{\\\\partial W(x,p)}{\\\\partial x}. : In fact, it is classical even in the presence of harmonic forces. 6\\\\. State overlap is calculated as: :: \\\\langle \\\\psi\\\\theta \\\\rangle^2=2\\\\pi\\\\hbar\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}dx\\\\,\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty dp\\\\,W_{\\\\psi}(x,p)W_{\\\\theta}(x,p). 7\\\\. Operator expectation values (averages) are calculated as phase-space averages of the respective Wigner transforms: :: g(x,p)\\\\equiv\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty dy\\\\, \\\\left\\\\langle x-\\\\frac{y}{2} \\\\right \\\\hat{G} \\\\left x+\\\\frac{y}{2} \\\\right\\\\rangle e^{ipy/\\\\hbar}, :: \\\\langle \\\\psi\\\\hat{G}\\\\psi\\\\rangle=Tr(\\\\hat{\\\\rho}\\\\hat{G})=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty dx\\\\, \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty dp\\\\, W(x,p)g(x,p). 8\\\\. In order that W(x, p) represent physical (positive) density matrices: :: \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty dx\\\\, \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty dp\\\\, W(x,p)W_\\\\theta(x,p) \\\\ge 0 ~, : for all pure states θ〉. 9\\\\. By virtue of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, for a pure state, it is constrained to be bounded, :: -\\\\frac 2 h \\\\leq W(x,p) \\\\leq \\\\frac 2 h. : This bound disappears in the classical limit, ħ → 0. In this limit, W(x, p) reduces to the probability density in coordinate space x, usually highly localized, multiplied by δ-functions in momentum: the classical limit is \\"spiky\\". Thus, this quantum-mechanical bound precludes a Wigner function which is a perfectly localized delta function in phase space, as a reflection of the uncertainty principle.; C. Zachos, D. Fairlie, and T. Curtright, Quantum Mechanics in Phase Space ( World Scientific, Singapore, 2005) . 10\\\\. The Wigner transformation is simply the Fourier transform of the antidiagonals of the density matrix, when that matrix is expressed in a position basis.  Examples  Let  m\\\\rangle\\\\equiv \\\\frac{a^{\\\\dagger m}}{\\\\sqrt{m!}}0\\\\rangle be the m-th Fock state of a quantum harmonic oscillator. Groenewold (1946) discovered its associated Wigner function, in dimensionless variables, isW_{m\\\\rangle}(x,p) = \\\\frac{(-1)^m}{\\\\pi} e^{-(x^2+p^2)}L_m(2(p^2+x^2)), where L_m(x) denotes the m-th Laguerre polynomial. This may follow from the expression for the static eigenstate wavefunctions, u_m(x) = \\\\pi^{-1/4} H_m(x) e^{-x^2/2}, where H_m is the m-th Hermite polynomial. From the above definition of the Wigner function, upon a change of integration variables, : W_{m\\\\rangle}(x,p) = \\\\frac{(-1)^m}{\\\\pi^{3/2} 2^m m!} e^{-x^2-p^2} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty d\\\\zeta e^{-\\\\zeta^2} H_m(\\\\zeta - ip + x)H_m(\\\\zeta - ip - x). The expression then follows from the integral relation between Hermite and Laguerre polynomials. page 105  Evolution equation for Wigner function  The Wigner transformation is a general invertible transformation of an operator on a Hilbert space to a function g(x,p) on phase space, and is given by :g(x,p)=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty ds ~e^{ips/\\\\hbar} \\\\left.\\\\left\\\\langle x-\\\\frac s2\\\\right. \\\\right\\\\ \\\\hat G\\\\ \\\\left.\\\\leftx+\\\\frac s2 \\\\right. \\\\right\\\\rangle. Hermitian operators map to real functions. The inverse of this transformation, so from phase space to Hilbert space, is called the Weyl transformation, : \\\\langle x \\\\ \\\\hat G\\\\  y \\\\rangle= \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty {dp \\\\over h} ~ e^{ip(x-y)/\\\\hbar} g\\\\left({x+y\\\\over 2},p\\\\right), (not to be confused with the distinct Weyl transformation in differential geometry). The Wigner function W(x,p) discussed here is thus seen to be the Wigner transform of the density matrix operator ρ̂. Thus, the trace of an operator with the density matrix Wigner-transforms to the equivalent phase-space integral overlap of g(x, p) with the Wigner function. The Wigner transform of the von Neumann evolution equation of the density matrix in the Schrödinger picture is ;Moyal's evolution equation for the Wigner function, ::{\\\\partial W(x,p,t) \\\\over \\\\partial t} = - {{ W(x,p ,t) ~,~ H(x,p)}}~, where H(x,p) is Hamiltonian and { {•, •} } is the Moyal bracket. In the classical limit ħ → 0, the Moyal bracket reduces to the Poisson bracket, while this evolution equation reduces to the Liouville equation of classical statistical mechanics. Strictly formally, in terms of quantum characteristics, the solution of this evolution equation reads, W(x,p,t) = W(\\\\star (x_{-t}(x,p),p_{-t}(x,p)),0), where x_{t}(x,p) and p_{t}(x,p) are solutions of so-called quantum Hamilton's equations, subject to initial conditions x_{t=0}(x,p) = x and p_{t=0}(x,p)=p, and where \\\\star-product composition is understood for all argument functions. Since, however, \\\\star-composition is thoroughly nonlocal (the \\"quantum probability fluid\\" diffuses, as observed by Moyal), vestiges of local trajectories are normally barely discernible in the evolution of the Wigner distribution function. In the integral representation of ★-products, successive operations by them have been adapted to a phase-space path- integral, to solve this evolution equation for the Wigner function (see also B. Segev: Evolution kernels for phase space distributions. In: see especially section 5. \\"Path integral for the propagator\\" on pages 86-89 online). This non-trajectoral feature of Moyal time evolution is illustrated in the gallery below, for Hamiltonians more complex than the harmonic oscillator. Harmonic oscillator time evolution In the special case of the quantum harmonic oscillator, however, the evolution is simple and appears identical to the classical motion: a rigid rotation in phase space with a frequency given by the oscillator frequency. This is illustrated in the gallery below. This same time evolution occurs with quantum states of light modes, which are harmonic oscillators.  Classical limit  The Wigner function allows one to study the classical limit, offering a comparison of the classical and quantum dynamics in phase space.See for example: Wojciech H. Zurek: Decoherence and the transition from quantum to classical – revisited, Los Alamos Science, 27, 2002, arXiv:quant-ph/0306072, pp. 15 ff.See for example: C. Zachos, D. Fairlie, T. Curtright: Quantum mechanics in phase space: an overview with selected papers, World Scientific, 2005 It has recently been suggested that the Wigner function approach can be viewed as a quantum analogy to the operatorial formulation of classical mechanics introduced in 1932 by Bernard Koopman and John von Neumann: the time evolution of the Wigner function approaches, in the limit ħ → 0, the time evolution of the Koopman–von Neumann wavefunction of a classical particle. The truncated Wigner approximation is a semiclassical approximation to the dynamics obtained by replacing Moyal's equation with the classical Liouville's equation. Positivity of the Wigner function As already noted, the Wigner function of quantum state typically takes some negative values. Indeed, for a pure state in one variable, if W(x,p)\\\\ge 0 for all x and p, then the wave function must have the form :\\\\psi(x)=e^{-ax^2+bx+c} for some complex numbers a,b,c with \\\\mathrm{Re}(a)>0 (Hudson's theorem). Note that a is allowed to be complex, so that \\\\psi is not necessarily a Gaussian wave packet in the usual sense. Thus, pure states with non-negative Wigner functions are not necessarily minimum uncertainty states in the sense of the Heisenberg uncertainty formula; rather, they give equality in the Schrödinger uncertainty formula, which includes an anticommutator term in addition to the commutator term. (With careful definition of the respective variances, all pure state Wigner functions lead to Heisenberg's inequality all the same.) In higher dimensions, the characterization of pure states with non- negative Wigner functions is similar; the wave function must have the form :\\\\psi(x)=e^{-(x,Ax)+b\\\\cdot x+c} where A is a symmetric complex matrix whose real part is positive definite, b is a complex vector, and is a complex number.F. Soto and P. Claverie, \\"When is the Wigner function of multidimensional systems nonnegative?\\", Journal of Mathematical Physics 24 (1983) 97-100 The Wigner function of any such state is a Gaussian distribution on phase space. The cited paper of Soto and Claverie gives an elegant proof of this characterization, using the Segal–Bargmann transform. The reasoning is as follows. The Husimi Q function of \\\\psi may be computed as the squared magnitude of the Segal–Bargmann transform of \\\\psi, multiplied by a Gaussian. Meanwhile, the Husimi Q function is the convolution of the Wigner function with a Gaussian. If the Wigner function of \\\\psi is non-negative everywhere on phase space, then the Husimi Q function will be strictly positive everywhere on phase space. Thus, the Segal–Bargmann transform F(x+ip) of \\\\psi will be nowhere zero. Thus, by a standard result from complex analysis, we have :F(x+ip)=e^{g(x+ip)} for some holomorphic function g. But in order for F to belong to the Segal–Bargmann space—that is, for F to be square-integrable with respect to a Gaussian measure—g must have at most quadratic growth at infinity. From this, elementary complex analysis can be used to show that g must actually be a quadratic polynomial. Thus, we obtain an explicit form of the Segal–Bargmann transform of any pure state whose Wigner function is non- negative. We can then invert the Segal–Bargmann transform to obtain the claimed form of the position wave function. There does not appear to be any simple characterization of mixed states with non-negative Wigner functions.  The Wigner function in relation to other interpretations of quantum mechanics  It has been shown that the Wigner quasiprobability distribution function can be regarded as an -deformation of another phase space distribution function that describes an ensemble of de Broglie–Bohm causal trajectories.Nuno Costa Dias, Joao Nuno Prata, Bohmian trajectories and quantum phase space distributions, Physics Letters A vol. 302 (2002) pp. 261-272, arXiv:quant-ph/0208156v1 (submitted 26 August 2002) Basil Hiley has shown that the quasi-probability distribution may be understood as the density matrix re-expressed in terms of a mean position and momentum of a \\"cell\\" in phase space, and the de Broglie–Bohm interpretation allows one to describe the dynamics of the centers of such \\"cells\\".B.

Revzen, Classical and Quantum Mechanical State Reconstruction, arXiv:1112.3164v1 [quant-ph] (submitted December 14, 2011)  Uses of the Wigner function outside quantum mechanics  A contour plot of the Wigner–Ville distribution for a chirped pulse of light. The plot makes it obvious that the frequency is a linear function of time. * In the modelling of optical systems such as telescopes or fibre telecommunications devices, the Wigner function is used to bridge the gap between simple ray tracing and the full wave analysis of the system. Here is replaced with in the small angle (paraxial) approximation. In this context, the Wigner function is the closest one can get to describing the system in terms of rays at position and angle while still including the effects of interference.I Bazarov, Phys Rev ST Accel Beams 15 (2012) 050703, . If it becomes negative at any point, then simple ray-tracing will not suffice to model the system. That is to say, negative values of this function are a symptom of the Gabor limit of the classical light signal and not of quantum features of light associated with . * In signal analysis, a time-varying electrical signal, mechanical vibration, or sound wave are represented by a Wigner function. Here, is replaced with the time and is replaced with the angular frequency , where is the regular frequency. * In ultrafast optics, short laser pulses are characterized with the Wigner function using the same and substitutions as above. Pulse defects such as chirp (the change in frequency with time) can be visualized with the Wigner function. See adjacent figure. * In quantum optics, and are replaced with the and quadratures, the real and imaginary components of the electric field (see coherent state).  Measurements of the Wigner function  * Quantum tomography * Frequency-resolved optical gating  Other related quasiprobability distributions  The Wigner distribution was the first quasiprobability distribution to be formulated, but many more followed, formally equivalent and transformable to and from it (viz. Transformation between distributions in time–frequency analysis). As in the case of coordinate systems, on account of varying properties, several such have with various advantages for specific applications: * Glauber P representation * Husimi Q representation Nevertheless, in some sense, the Wigner distribution holds a privileged position among all these distributions, since it is the only one whose requisite star product drops out (integrates out by parts to effective unity) in the evaluation of expectation values, as illustrated above, and so can be visualized as a quasiprobability measure analogous to the classical ones.  Historical note  As indicated, the formula for the Wigner function was independently derived several times in different contexts. In fact, apparently, Wigner was unaware that even within the context of quantum theory, it had been introduced previously by Heisenberg and Dirac,W. Heisenberg, \\"Über die inkohärente Streuung von Röntgenstrahlen\\", Physik. Zeitschr. 32, 737–740 (1931); P.A.M. Dirac, \\"Note on exchange phenomena in the Thomas atom\\", Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. 26, 376–395 (1930). albeit purely formally: these two missed its significance, and that of its negative values, as they merely considered it as an approximation to the full quantum description of a system such as the atom. (Incidentally, Dirac would later become Wigner's brother-in-law, marrying his sister Manci.) Symmetrically, in most of his legendary 18-month correspondence with Moyal in the mid-1940s, Dirac was unaware that Moyal's quantum-moment generating function was effectively the Wigner function, and it was Moyal who finally brought it to his attention.Ann Moyal, (2006), \\"Maverick Mathematician: The Life and Science of J.E.

Troyanovsky was born into a diplomatic family. His father, Aleksandr A. Troyanovsky, served as the first Soviet ambassador to the United States from 1934 to 1938 and was also Soviet Ambassador to Japan from 1929-1932. Although he was born in Moscow, Oleg attended The American School in Japan, the Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C., and Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. At Swarthmore in the 1930s, Troyanovsky allegedly recruited his American classmate Stephen Laird as a Soviet spy. Troyanovsky returned to the Soviet Union to complete his education at the Moscow Institute for Foreign Languages and Moscow University. After spending two years as a soldier in the Red Army, Troyanovsky joined the Russian Foreign Ministry to work as a foreign policy assistant and interpreter for Soviet leaders Joseph Stalin and adviser to Nikita Khrushchev. Troyanovsky served as the Soviet Union's ambassador to Japan before he was appointed to the United Nations. In 1980, two members of a dissident Marxist group sneaked into the U.N. Security Council chamber and threw red paint on Troyanovsky and U.S. Ambassador William vanden Heuvel. The Russian's response: \\"Better red than dead.\\" In 1983, when listening to the recording of Soviet fighter pilots shooting down Korean Air Flight 007 jumbo jet near Moneron Island that killed carrying 269 people, Troyanovsky remained poker-faced and impassive. From 1986 to 1990, he held his final diplomatic post as the ambassador to China. Troyanovsky spent his retirement years working on his memoirs and giving lectures in Russia and abroad.

Separators are typically created by one or more municipalities in situations of rapid urban growth, where unchecked development might otherwise result in the contiguity of the urban areas. A unilateral separator that partially or completely encircles a municipality is commonly known as a greenbelt. Separators often consist of undeveloped farmland, forests, floodplains, or other areas that may or may not be desirable for residential or commercial development. The enactment of a separator is commonly achieved through a variety of different means, including conservation easements, outright purchase of land for parks, or zoning restrictions. Separators are often enacted along major highways connecting municipalities in order to preserve the open viewshed that provides a natural boundary between two communities. Separators are sometimes controversial since they can withdraw desirable development land from the marketplace, resulting not only in the loss of tax revenue but also incurring the cost of acquiring and managing the land.

It sits on the level below Keter (in the formulations that include that sephirah), across from Chokhmah and directly above Gevurah. It is usually given four paths: to Keter, Chokhmah, Gevurah, and Tiphereth (some Kabbalists place a path from Binah to Chesed as well.) Binah is associated with the color black. Description According to the Bahir: \\"The third (utterance): quarry of the Torah, treasury of wisdom, quarry of God's spirit, hewn out by the spirit of God. This teaches that God hewed out all the letters of the Torah, engraving them with the Spirit, casting His forms within it\\".Arthur Green. A guide to the Zohar Binah is 'intuitive understanding', or 'contemplation'. It is likened to a 'palace of mirrors' that reflects the pure point of light of Chokhmah, wisdom, increasing and multiplying it in an infinite variety of ways. In this sense, it is the 'quarry', which is carved out by the light of wisdom. It is the womb, which gives shape to the Spirit of God. On a psychological level, Binah is \\"processed wisdom,\\" also known as deductive reasoning. It is davar mitoch davar—understanding one idea from another idea. While Chokhmah is intellect that does not emanate from the rational process (it is either inspired or taught), Binah is the rational process that is innate in the person which works to develop an idea fully. Binah is associated with the feminine. The Bahir states: \\"For you shall call Understanding a Mother.\\" Classical Jewish texts state Binah yeterah natun l'nashim (\\"an extra measure of Binah was given to women\\"). In its fully articulated form, Binah possesses two partzufim. The higher of these is referred to as Imma Ila'ah (\\"the higher mother\\"), whereas the lower is referred to as tevunah (\\"comprehension\\"). These two partzufim are referred to jointly as Imma (\\"the mother\\"). Qualities derived from Binah=Ethical qualities In the medieval text the Tomer Devorah, Moses ben Jacob Cordovero elucidated the ethical qualities associated with each sefira, which one must attempt to imitate. The attribute associated with Binah is complete repentance, for 'just as Binah sweetens all severities and neutralizes their bitterness, one should repent and rectify all flaws'. Non- Jewish associations In Western esotericism, Binah is seen to take the raw force of Chokhmah, and to channel it into the various forms of creation. For example, in a car, you have the fuel and an engine. While Chokhmah is the fuel, pure energy, Binah is the engine, pure receptivity. Either one without the other is useless. In its role as the ultimate Object, as opposed to Chokhmah as the Subject, its role is similar to the role of Shakti in Indian mysticism. It is feminine, because it literally gives birth to the whole of creation, providing the supernal womb, with Chokhmah providing the raw energy. The name of God associated with Binah is Jehovah Elohim, the archangel that presides over it is Tzaphkiel, the order of angels that resides in it are the Aralim (the Thrones) and the planet associated with it is Saturn. Binah is related to the Yoni, the womb, the Priestess card in the occult tarot (according to A. E. Waite's Pictorial Key to the Tarot). Aleister Crowley's \\"Liber 777\\" associates it with Isis, Cybele, Demeter, Rhea, Woman, The Virgin Mary, Juno, Hecate, The \\"threes\\" of the Tarot, etc. Occultists have compared the Sephira with the chakras of Indian mysticism, and one such comparison is in comparing both Binah and Chokhmah with the Ajna chakra, which is where both Shiva and Shakti are united. For its negative opposite on the Tree of Death, it has the demonic order Sathariel, ruled by the Archdemon Lucifuge Rofocale. In the correlation of Binah with Shakti and Chokhmah with Shiva, Shakti is the animating life force whereas Shiva is dead, a corpse, without her energy.

In its positive sense, the word is used of kindness or love between people, of the devotional piety of people towards God as well as of love or mercy of God towards humanity. It is frequently used in Psalms in the latter sense, where it is traditionally translated \\"lovingkindness\\" in English translations. In Jewish theology it is likewise used of God's love for the Children of Israel, and in Jewish ethics it is used for love or charity between people. Chesed in this latter sense of \\"charity\\" is considered a virtue on its own, and also for its contribution to tikkun olam (repairing the world). It is also considered the foundation of many religious commandments practiced by traditional Jews, especially interpersonal commandments. Chesed is also one of the ten Sephirot on the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. It is given the association of kindness and love, and is the first of the emotive attributes of the sephirot. Etymology and translations The root chasad has a primary meaning of \\"eager and ardent desire\\", used both in the sense \\"good, kind\\" and \\"shame, contempt\\". The noun chesed inherits both senses, on one hand \\"zeal, love, kindness towards someone\\" and on the other \\"zeal, ardour against someone; envy, reproach\\". In its positive is used of mutual benevolence, mercy or pity between people, of devotional piety of people towards God, as well as the grace, favour or mercy of God towards people. It occurs 248 times in the Hebrew Bible. In the majority of cases (149 times), the King James Bible translation is \\"mercy\\", following LXX eleos. Less frequent translations are: \\"kindness\\" (40 times), \\"lovingkindness\\" (30 times), \\"goodness\\" (12 times), \\"kindly\\" (5 times), \\"merciful\\" (4 times), \\"favour\\" (3 times) and \\"good\\", \\"goodliness\\", \\"pity\\" (once each). Only two instances of the noun in its negative sense are in the text, translated \\"reproach\\" in Proverbs 14:34, and \\"wicked thing\\" in Leviticus 20:17. The translation of loving kindness in KJV is derived from the Coverdale Bible of 1535. This particular translation is used exclusively of chesed used of the benign attitude of YHWH (\\"the \\") or Elohim (\\"God\\") towards his chosen, primarily invoked in Psalms (23 times), but also in the prophets, four times in Jeremiah, twice in Isaiah 63:7 and once in Hosea 2:19. While \\"lovingkindness\\" is now considered somewhat archaic, it is part of the traditional rendition of Psalms in English Bible translations. Some more recent translations use \\"steadfast love\\" where KJV has \\"lovingkindness\\". The Septuagint has mega eleos \\"great mercy\\", rendered as Latin misericordia. As an example of the use of chesed in Psalms, consider its notable occurrence at the beginning of Psalm 51 (, lit. \\"be favourable to me, Elohim, as your chesed\\"): In Judaism, \\"love\\" is often used as a shorter English translation.Adin Steinsaltz, In the beginning: discourses on Chasidic thought p. 140.

Aryeh Kaplan, p. 86.\\"The Rabbinic Understanding of the Covenant\\", in Kinship & consent: the Jewish political tradition and its contemporary uses by Daniel Judah Elazar, p. 89 Political theorist Daniel Elazar has suggested that \\"chesed\\" cannot easily be translated into English, but that it means something like \\"loving covenant obligation\\".Chesed \\"is the antidote to the narrow legalism that can be a problem for covenantal systems and would render them contractual rather than covenantal\\" Daniel Elazar, HaBrit V'HaHesed: Foundations of the Jewish System .

Co., 1963 and \\"compassion\\". Jewish ethics In traditional musar literature (ethical literature), chesed is one of the primary virtues. The tannaic rabbi Simon the Just taught: \\"The world rests upon three things: Torah, service to God, and bestowing kindness\\" (Pirkei Avot 1:2). Chesed is here the core ethical virtue. A statement by Rabbi Simlai in the Talmud claims that \\"The Torah begins with chesed and ends with chesed.\\" This may be understood to mean that \\"the entire Torah is characterized by chesed, i.e. it sets forth a vision of the ideal life whose goals are behavior characterized by mercy and compassion.\\" Alternatively, it may allude to the idea that the giving of the Torah itself is the quintessential act of chesed. In Moses ben Jacob Cordovero's kabbalistic treatise Tomer Devorah, the following are actions undertaken in imitation of the qualities of Chesed: * love God so completely that one will never forsake His service for any reason * provide a child with all the necessities of their sustenance and love the child * circumcise a child * visiting and healing the sick * giving charity to the poor * offering hospitality to strangers * attending to the dead * bringing a bride to the chuppah marriage ceremony * making peace between a person and another human being. A person who embodies chesed is known as a chasid (hasid, חסיד), one who is faithful to the covenant and who goes \\"above and beyond that which is normally required\\" and a number of groups throughout Jewish history which focus on going \\"above and beyond\\" have called themselves chasidim. These groups include the Hasideans of the Second Temple period, the Maimonidean Hasidim of medieval Egypt and Palestine, the Chassidei Ashkenaz in medieval Europe, and the Hasidic movement which emerged in eighteenth century Eastern Europe. Charitable organizations In Modern Hebrew, חסד can take the generic meaning of \\"charity\\", and a \\"chesed institution\\" in modern Judaism may refer to any charitable organization run by religious Jewish groups or individuals. Charitable organizations described as \\"chesed institutions\\" include: * Bikur cholim organizations, dedicated to visiting and caring for the sick and their relatives * Gemach – an institution dedicated to gemilut chasadim (providing kindness), often with free loan funds or by lending or giving away particular types of items (toys, clothes, medical equipment, etc.). Such organizations are often named with an acronym of Gemilas chasadim such as Gemach or GM\\"CH. A community may have dozens of unique (and sometimes overlapping) Gemach organizations * Kiruv organizations – organizations designed to increase Jewish awareness among unaffiliated Jews, which is considered a form of kindness * Hatzolah – organizations by this name typically provide free services for emergency medical dispatch and ambulance transport (EMTs and paramedics) * Chevra kadisha – organizations that perform religious care for the deceased, and often provide logistical help to their families relating to autopsies, transport of the body, emergency family travel, burial, running a Shiva home, and caring for mourners * Chaverim (literally \\"friends\\") – organizations going by this name typically provide free roadside assistance and emergency help with mechanical or structural problems in private homes * Shomrim (guardians) groups – community watch groups Kabbalah The first three of the ten sephirot are the attributes of the intellect, while chesed is the first sephira of the attribute of action. In the kabbalistic Tree of life, its position is below Chokhmah, across from Gevurah and above Netzach. It is usually given four paths: to chokhmah, gevurah, tiphereth, and netzach (some Kabbalists place a path from chesed to binah as well.) The Bahir states, \\"What is the fourth (utterance): The fourth is the righteousness of God, His mercies and kindness with the entire world. This is the right hand of God.\\" Chesed manifests God's absolute, unlimited benevolence and kindness. The angelic order of this sphere is the Hashmallim, ruled by the Archangel Zadkiel. The opposing Qliphah is represented by the demonic order Gamchicoth, ruled by the Archdemon Astaroth.

Shubrick in command. The new sloop was first stationed off Labrador to protect American fishing vessels. After returning to the United States, she was sent to Trinidad to return the body of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry who had died in schooner on 23 August 1819 while returning from Angostura, Venezuela, where he had arranged for Venezuelan help to suppress piracy off the Spanish Main. In 1827 Lexington sailed to the Mediterranean Sea where she cruised for three years. In 1828, her commander, Benjamin W. Booth, likely commissioned the above painting while she was off the coast of Smyrna. Returning to Norfolk, Virginia in the fall of 1830, she decommissioned at Norfolk Navy Yard on 16 November. Recommissioning on 31 May 1831, Master Commandant Silas M. Duncan in command, she proceeded to São Paulo, Brazil, for duty with the Brazil Squadron until late 1836. Notably, in 1831 Duncan raided Luis Vernet's settlement at Puerto Luis in the Falkland Islands where the American ships Harriet, Superior and Breakwater had been captured in a dispute over fishing and seal hunting rights, prompting Duncan to take seven prisoners aboard the Lexington and charge them with piracy; which precipitated the re-establishment of British rule. She then sailed around Cape Horn to protect American commerce on the Pacific coast. On 1 March 1834 at Rio de Janeiro, diplomatist Edmund Roberts, then returning from his first mission aboard Peacock, boarded Lexington under the command of Captain M’Keever for return to Boston Harbor on 24 April. Returning to the east coast in 1840, Lexington was converted into a store ship and her 24 medium 24-pounders were replaced by six 32-pounder carronades. In April 1843, she sailed to the Mediterranean and served there for two years. The outbreak of war with Mexico in the spring of 1846 found Lexington operating along the west coast of North America. During the conflict, she transported troops and assisted in the blockade. On 12 January 1847, she landed a party at San Blas, Nayarit, and captured several enemy guns. After the war Lexington remained on the California coast, a source of stability and security during the territory's transition to U.S. control and in the earlier months of the gold rush of 1849. Returning to the United States East Coast early in 1850, Lexington operated on the eastern seaboard until getting underway from New York Harbor 18 June 1853 to join Commodore Matthew C. Perry's expedition to Japan. After the success of this notable expedition, Lexington remained in the Orient before returning to New York where she decommissioned on 26 February 1855. The sloop was sold in 1860.

Teluk Blanga is the district between Pasir Panjang and Tanjong Pagar. Name The region is named after the bay. Telok Blangah (Jawi: تلوق بلڠه) is a Malay compound of blanga \\"a type of cooking pot\\" and telok \\"bay\\" and so literally means \\"cooking pot bay\\", so named on account of its shape. In the olden maps, Telok Blangah‘s name spelling was written as Teluk Blanga, Teluk Belanga and Teluk Blangah. Teluk Blanga is known as sit lat mng in Hokkien, meaning \\"Singapore gate\\" or \\"north west gate\\". History Historically, this area is as old as the thirteenth century city of Temasek. The area is rich with Malay aristocratic history of past royal events. According to the Malay Annals, Sang Nila Utama's boat ran into a storm and he threw everything overboard, including his crown before landing just off Telok Blangah beach. The area gained prominence again during the British period when Sir Stamford Raffles in 1823 assigned Temenggong Abdul Rahman (died 1825) and his followers of land for their residence and a cemetery. The area flourished under Temenggong Abdul Rahman because of his monopoly over the gutta percha trade. Temenggong Abdul Rahman's eldest son, Tun Haji Abdullah, informally took over as Temenggong of Johor after his death in 1825, followed by his second son Daeng Ibrahim informally in 1833 and officially on 19 August 1841. In 1845, Telok Blangah Hill (Malay: Bukit Telok Blangah) was renamed to Mount Faber after Captain Charles Edward Faber. Following Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim’s death in 1862, his first son Temenggong Abu Bakar succeed him and moved his Istana to Tyersall. In 1885, when Maharaja Abu Bakar became the Sultan of Johor, he moved to Johor Bahru. The former royal audience hall (now a mosque, Masjid Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim) and the Johor Royal Mausoleum still remain today at Telok Blangah Road, near VivoCity and Sentosa Gateway. The last to be buried was Ungku Modh. Khalif (or Khalid), the younger brother of Sultan Abu Bakar in 1900. Another Malay royal cemetery and shrine nearby is Keramat Bukit Kasita at Bukit Purmei, which is the final resting place of the Riau-Lingga Royal Family, a split of the Johor Royal Family.http://www.guidegecko.com/singapore/west-monuments-buildings/masjid- temenggong-daeng-ibrahim-state-of-johor-mosque/p,608167840 Telok Blangah Road was officially named in 1907.

The components of a technopole usually comprise local firms, universities, financial institutions and public research organizations. Technopoles may be developed by the private sector or by the co-operation or partnership between the public and private sectors. Governments of all levels promote them as a panacea for economies hurt by economic restructuring. Large corporations and small business operate within these high technology areas. Networking between companies is important and made possible by technological advances. Technopoles are combined technological and business centers specifically established around recognized educational and research institutes.  Definitions  The Technopole Diderot Roanne, 2008. There are several definitions for \\"technopole\\" in an international context, whereby focus is usually placed on the existence of four factors: * First, a critical mass of R&D; facilities which carry out research in one or more relevant areas and which have established the appropriate infrastructure. * Second, the immediate spatial vicinity to university institutions is essential in order to link research to instruction. * The third criterion is the presence of competent companies as source of demand for R&D; competence and \\"users\\" of know-how generated at the Technopole on the international market. * Finally, there must be sufficient interest to provide investments to enable technology-oriented start-ups and spin-offs. Factors important to investors include: *Good buildings and building sites *An attractive environmental setting *Excellent highway access and proximity to an international airport *Excellent international tele-communication facilities *Good quality housing for managers and, *Easy access to a substantial pool of well trained and motivated labour Technopoles are also vulnerable to global trends and can dissolve quickly if they are not properly supported. Technopoles have to be flexible and willing to experiment with new ideas to be seen as a global competitor.Quan-Haase 2012, p.67 Governments and corporations tend to continue to heavily invest in technopoles in hopes of gaining economic prosperity.Quan-Haase 2012, p.72.

Frederick Terman, a professor at Stanford University who later became the Dean of electrical engineering, initiated many R&D; initiatives in Silicon Valley.Quan-Haase 2012, p.68. Terman helped his students, such as William Hewlett and David Packard, to initiate their own companies and at times even personally invested in them. In 1951, Terman also helped to establish Stanford Industrial Park. Universities surrounding Silicon Valley have provided a constant stream of students who take interest in projects and companies within Silicon Valley.Quan-Haase 2012, p.70. With the various numbers of small companies in the area, it is common for employees to move from one company to another. Employees tend to maintain informal social connections with past coworkers which expand professional and social networks. These expanded networks have enabled a rapid exchange of information resulting in the formation of new businesses, research, and development opportunities.Saxenian as cited by Quan-Haase 2012, p.71. Silicon Valley remains one of the leading technopoles of the world to date with its competitive entrepreneurs, its innovative workforce and its firm base of investors.Castells & Hall, 1994 as cited by Quan-Haase 2012, p.71 Route 128 is another technopole located in the United States. Route 128 was a stretch of highway in the Greater Boston Area with many research and industrial facilitiesSaxenian, A.L. (1996) Regional Advantage: Culture and Competition in Silicon Valley and Route 128.Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. p. 16. The route linked many towns in the greater Boston area and many technology firms relocated there for its proximity to universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge and Harvard.Saxenian 1996, p. 16. MIT played an integral role in establishing Route 128 as a technopole. MIT was established in 1861 as a technical university.Saxenian 1996, p.12. After the Second World War, MIT encouraged technological innovation through commercially oriented research. Funding for research projects came from large corporations such as GE, Eastern Kodak, and Dupont, as well as the federal government.Saxenian 1996, p.13. In 1930, the Division of Industrial Cooperation and Research which solicited research contracts from companies was discontinued, although MIT maintained its capacity to solicit corporate contracts. Many of research projects included electronic innovations and projects for the federal government. In 1941, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) was created. During the 1940s and 1950s, MIT received one third of the OSRD's contracts, which was estimated at $330 million in contracts for research projects.Saxenian 1996, p.14. Harvard University and other local universities also received funding for research projects alongside MIT. This area was named “Research Row”. Unlike Frederick Terman's approach of aiding start-up companies within Stanford University, MIT had a strict policy which would not invest in start-up companies of its students, as investing was considered risky and inconsistent with their policies.Saxenian 1996, p.15. Despite MIT choosing not to invest in start-up organizations around the region, there were many technology firms that provided funding. MIT continues to solicit contracts from corporations and is still highly regarded as an institution that is a leader in technological innovations. Other technopoles in the United States include places such as Austin, TX; Denver-Boulder, CO; Huntsville, AL; Lafayette, IN; Madison, WI; Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton; Raleigh-Durham, NC; San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose and Seattle, Washington.Malecki, 1979 as cited by Simmie, 1994 References External links  * Technopol Krems * Technopol Tulln * Technopol Wiener Neustadt * Technopol Sierre Switzerland Category:Economic geography ","title":"Technopole"},{"id":"1884378","text":"The euro convergence criteria (also known as the Maastricht criteria) are the criteria which European Union member states are required to meet to enter the third stage of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and adopt the euro as their currency. The four main criteria, which actually comprise five criteria as the \\"fiscal criterion\\" consists of both a \\"debt criterion\\" and a \\"deficit criterion\\", are based on Article 140 (ex article 121.1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Full EMU membership is only open to EU member states. However, the European microstates of Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City, which are not members of the EU, have signed monetary agreements with EU which allow them officially to adopt the euro and issue their own variant of euro coins. These states had all previously used one of the eurozone currencies replaced by the euro, or a currency pegged to one of them. These states are not members of the eurozone and do not get a seat in the European Central Bank (ECB) or the Eurogroup. As part of the EU treaty, all of the EU Member States are obliged to adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), which serves as a framework to ensure price stability and fiscal responsibility, has adopted identical limits for governments budget deficit and debt as the convergence criteria. Due to the fact that several countries did not exercise a sufficient level of fiscal responsibility during the first 10 years of the euro's lifetime, two major SGP reforms were recently introduced. The first reform was the Sixpack which entered into force in December 2011, and it was followed in January 2013 by the even more ambitious Fiscal Compact, which was signed by 25 out of the then-27 EU member states. Countries are expected to participate in the second version of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM-II) for two years before joining the Euro. Criteria The Maastricht Treaty, which was signed in February 1992 and entered into force on 1 November 1993, outlined the 5 convergence criteria EU member states are required to comply with to adopt the new currency the euro. The purpose of setting the criteria was to achieve price stability within the eurozone and ensure it wasn't negatively impacted when new member states accede. The framework of the five criteria was outlined by article 109j.1 of the Maastricht Treaty, and the attached Protocol on the Convergence Criteria and Protocol on the Excessive Deficit Procedure. The original treaty article was later renumbered to become article 121.1 of the Amsterdam Treaty, and later renumbered again to Article 140 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Aside from the renumbering, no significant change have happened to the content of the \\"convergence criteria article\\" and its referred to Protocol on the Convergence Criteria and Protocol on the Excessive Deficit Procedure. The precise definition and method of measuring compliance was subsequently further developed by the EMI (later known as ECB) in their first three reports published in April 1995, November 1995 and November 1996. The full definition of the five criteria are summarised below. # HICP inflation (12-months average of yearly rates): Shall not exceed the HICP reference value, which is calculated by the end of the last month with available data as the unweighted arithmetic average of the similar HICP inflation rates in the 3 EU member states with the lowest HICP inflation plus 1.5 percentage points. However, EU member states with a HICP rate significantly below the eurozone average (and pre 1999 below \\"comparable rates in other Member States\\"), do not qualify as a benchmark country for the reference value and will be ignored, if it can be established its price developments have been strongly affected by exceptional factors (i.e. severe enforced wage cuts, exceptional developments in energy/food/currency markets, or a strong recession). In example, at the April 2014 assessment: Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus with HICP values respectively 2.2, 1.8 and 1.4 percentage points below the eurozone average, were all found to have suffered from exceptional factors, and hence concluded to be outliers, causing the reference limit instead to be calculated based on the HICP values from the three states with the 4th to 6th lowest HICP values in EU. # Government budget deficit: The ratio of the annual general government deficit relative to gross domestic product (GDP) at market prices, must not exceed 3% at the end of the preceding fiscal year (based on notified measured data) and neither for any of the two subsequent years (based on the European Commission's published forecast data). Deficits being \\"slightly above the limit\\" (previously outlined by the evaluation practice to mean deficits in the range from 3.0–3.5%), will as a standard rule not be accepted, unless it can be established that either: \\"1) The deficit ratio has declined substantially and continuously before reaching the level close to the 3% limit\\" or \\"2) The small deficit ratio excess above the 3% limit has been caused by exceptional circumstances and has a temporary nature (i.e. expenditure one-offs triggered by a significant economic downturn, or expenditure one-offs triggered by the implementation of economic reforms with a positive mid/long-term effect)\\". If a state is found by the Commission to have breached the deficit criteria, they will recommend the Council of the European Union to open up a deficit-breached EDP against the state in accordance with Article 126(6), which only will be abrogated again when the state simultaneously comply with both the deficit and debt criteria. # Government debt-to-GDP ratio: The ratio of gross government debt (measured at its nominal value outstanding at the end of the year, and consolidated between and within the sectors of general government) relative to GDP at market prices, must not exceed 60% at the end of the preceding fiscal year. Or if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds the 60% limit, the ratio shall at least be found to have \\"sufficiently diminished and must be approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace\\". This \\"satisfactory pace\\" was defined and operationalized by a specific calculation formula, with the entry into force of the new debt reduction benchmark rule in December 2011, requiring the states in breach of the 60% limit to deliver – either for the backward- or forward-looking 3-year period – an annual debt-to-GDP ratio reduction of at least 5% of the part of the benchmark value being in excess of the 60% limit. If both the 60% limit and \\"debt reduction benchmark rule\\" is breached, the Commission will finally check if the breach has been caused only by certain special exempted causes (i.e. capital payments to establishment of common financial stability mechanisms, like the ESM) – because if this is the case they will then rule an \\"exempted compliance\\". If a state is found by the Commission to have breached the debt criteria (without this breach solely being due to \\"exempted causes\\"), they will recommend the Council of the European Union to open up a debt-breached EDP against the state in accordance with Article 126(6), which only will be abrogated again when the state simultaneously comply with both the deficit and debt criteria. # Exchange rate stability: Applicant countries should not have devalued the central rate of their euro pegged currency during the previous two years, and for the same period the currency stability shall be deemed to have been stable without \\"severe tensions\\". As a third requirement, participation in the exchange-rate mechanism (ERM / ERM II) under the European Monetary System (EMS) for two consecutive years is expected, though according to the Commission \\"exchange rate stability during a period of non-participation before entering ERM II can be taken into account.\\" For example, Italy was deemed to have converged with only 15 months as an ERM-member, as measured on the last day in the review period of the convergence report. Meanwhile, the European Commission concluded that for Cyprus, Malta and Latvia, their 18 months of membership in the review period ending on 31 October 2006 was insufficient. As of 2014, all 29 times the subcriteria for ERM-membership length was found complied with by the Commission, these cases had the particular observation in common, that the state had surpassed minimum two full years of ERM-membership either ahead of the \\"final approval date (following approximately 1.5 month after the publication of the convergence report) where their currency exchange rate would be irrevocably fixed by the Council of the European Union\\" or by the \\"first possible euro adoption date following the publication of the convergence report\\". # Long-term interest rates (average yields for 10yr government bonds in the past year): Shall be no more than 2.0 percentage points higher, than the unweighted arithmetic average of the similar 10-year government bond yields in the 3 EU member states with the lowest HICP inflation (having qualified as benchmark countries for the calculation of the HICP reference value). If any of the 3 EU member states in concern are suffering from interest rates significantly higher than the \\"GDP-weighted eurozone average interest rate\\", and at the same time by the end of the assessment period have no complete funding access to the financial lending markets (which will be the case for as long as a country is unable to issue new government bonds with 10-year maturity – instead being dependent on disbursements from a sovereign state bailout programme), then such a country will not qualify as a benchmark country for the reference value; which then only will be calculated upon data from fewer than 3 EU member states. In example, Ireland was found to be an interest rate outlier not qualifying for the reference value calculation in the assessment month March 2012, when it was measured to have a long-term interest rate average being 4.71 percentage points above the eurozone average – while at the same time having no complete access to the financial lending markets. When Ireland was assessed again in April 2013, it was, however, deemed no longer to be an outlier, due to posting a long-term interest rate average only 1.59 percentage points above the eurozone average – while also having regained complete access to the financial lending markets for the last 1.5 month of the assessment period. A final relevant example appeared in April 2014, when Portugal likewise was found not to be an interest rate outlier, due to posting a long-term interest rate average being 2.89 percentage points above the eurozone average – while having regained complete access to the financial lending markets for the last 12 months of the assessment period. The ECB publishes a Convergence Report at least every two years to check how well the EU members aspiring for euro adoption comply with the criteria. The first full convergence report was published in November 1996, and concluded that only 3 out of 15 EU member states (Denmark, Luxembourg and Ireland) were completely compliant with the criteria at that point in time. As a majority of states were not in compliance, the Council decided to delay the introduction of the euro by two years to 1 January 1999. In March 1998 a more positive second convergence report concluded that 11 out of 12 applying countries were prepared for the electronic introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999, with only Greece failing to qualify by the deadline. Subsequent convergence reports have so far resulted in an additional 8 EU member states complying with all criteria and adopting the euro (Greece, Slovenia, Cyprus, Malta, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). The latest convergence report was published in June 2014, and checked for compliance in the reference year from May 2012 – April 2014, where Lithuania managed to fully comply – thus becoming the next 19th eurozone member. As the reference values for HICP inflation and long-term interest rates change on a monthly basis, any member state with a euro derogation has the right to ask the ECB for an updated compliance check, whenever they believe they have met all both economic and legal convergence criteria. For example, Latvia asked for such an extraordinary compliance check in March 2013 (outside the regular 2-year interval for automatic assessments). In 2009, the authors of a confidential International Monetary Fund (IMF) report suggested that in light of the ongoing global financial crisis, the EU Council should consider granting new EU member states which are having difficulty complying with all five convergence criteria the option to \\"partially adopt\\" the euro, along the lines of the monetary agreements signed with the European microstates outside the EU. These states would gain the right to adopt the euro and issue a national variant of euro coins, but would not get a seat in ECB or the Eurogroup until they met all the convergence criteria. However, the EU has not made use of this alternative accession process. Fulfillment of criteria= Reference values  The compliance check above was conducted in June 2014, with the HICP and interest rate reference values specifically applying for the last assessment month with available data (April 2014). As reference values for HICP and interest rates are subject for monthly changes, any EU member state with a euro derogation, has the right to ask for a renewed compliance check at any time during the year. For this potential extra assessment, the table below feature Eurostat's monthly recalculation of criteria values being used in the calculation process to determine the upper limit for HICP inflation and long-term interest rates, where a certain fixed buffer value is added to the moving yearly average for the three EU Member States with the lowest HICP figures (ignoring states classified as \\"outliers\\"). The black values in the table are sourced by the officially published convergence reports, while the lime-green values are only qualified estimates – not confirmed by any official convergence report – but sourced by monthly estimation reports published by the Polish Ministry of Finance. The reason why the lime-green values are only estimates, is because the \\"outlier\\" selection – ignoring certain states from the reference value calculation – beside of depending on a quantitative assessment also depends on a more complicated overall qualitative assessment, and hence it can not be predicted with absolute certainty who of the states the Commission will deem to be outliers. So any selection of outliers by the lime-green data lines – shall only be regarded as qualified estimates – which potentially could be different from those outliers which the Commission would have selected if they had published a specific report at the concerned point of time. The national fiscal accounts for the previous full calendar year are released each year in April (next time 23 April 2015). As the compliance check for both the debt and deficit criteria always awaits this release in a new calendar year, the first possible month to request a compliance check will be April, which would result in a data check for the HICP and Interest rates during the reference year from 1 April to 31 March. Any EU Member State may also ask the European Commission to conduct a compliance check, at any point of time during the remainder of the year, with HICP and interest rates always checked for the past 12 months – while debt and deficit compliance always will be checked for the 3-year period encompassing the last completed full calendar year and the two subsequent forecast years. As of 12 September 2014, all of the remaining euro derogation states without an opt-out, had not yet entered ERM-II, which mean its highly unlikely any of them will ask the European Commission to conduct an extraordinary compliance check ahead of the publication of the next regular convergence report (scheduled for release in May/June 2016).

It allows asset managers to capture the efficiencies of larger pools of assets (see economics of scale) although fashioning investment funds to separate market niches. One or more investment vehicles pool their portfolios within another vehicle – several smaller feeder funds contribute to one master fund. Sometimes, especially when the feeders are hedge funds, this is a way of complying with the legal systems of distinct jurisdictions. For example, an onshore feeder fund and an offshore feeder fund contribute to the same master portfolio. This is also sometimes called a hub and spoke structure.  Tax concerns  For a U.S. taxable investor, the ownership of shares in what is known as a \\"passive foreign investment company\\" or PFIC can prove to be very tax-expensive. The offshore feeder fund almost always meets the definition of a PFIC. An (onshore) master fund does not, so the transaction is set up so that the master fund is a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, which effectively provides insulation between the US based investor and the PFIC feeder.

As the sequel to Punch-Out!! of the same year, it retains the same gameplay and digitized speech. It introduces new characters to the Punch-Out!! series such as Bear Hugger, Dragon Chan, Vodka Drunkenski (whose name was changed to Soda Popinski in later releases), Great Tiger, and Super Macho Man. Gameplay The final match in Super Punch-Out!! against Super Macho Man. As in the original Punch-Out!!, the player assumes the role of a green-haired boxer (later recast as Little Mac in the 1987 Nintendo Entertainment System version),One of the Origin/Game Settings Tips about Little Mac's origin and All-Star Mode for Super Smash bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U reveals that Little Mac was actually debut in the 1984 Punch-Out!! arcade known by three initials, who works through the ranks of the WVBA (World Video Boxing Association). During matches, the player's boxer is viewed from the rear as a wireframe so the opponents are visible to the player. The player must precisely time punches, dodges, and blocks in order to defeat the opposing boxer. Hints are given as to the opponent's next move by subtle eye changes, but the player must ultimately predict what moves the opponent will make and react appropriately. Once the player defeats the final opponent, the player will win the Heavyweight Belt, then defend it against the same characters that have already been beaten. Each successive time they are met, the opponents are harder and quicker. In order to win a bout, the player must knock out the opponent within one 3-minute round; failure to do so results in an automatic loss. A technical knockout is awarded if either fighter is knocked down three times, but the opponent will sometimes fail to rise after the first or second knockdown. The arcade game is housed in a modified upright cabinet. Like the previous game, it requires two vertically stacked monitors. The top monitor is used to display statistics while the bottom one is the main game display. It is otherwise a standard upright arcade cabinet. It has a joystick and three buttons. Two buttons control left and right punches, one for each arm. One button delivers a strong uppercut or right hook, but it only works when the super meter (also known as the KO meter or power meter) is full. The super meter is filled by landing successful punches. It is drained when the player fails to block or dodge an attack, or if the player is knocked down. Unlike the original, Super Punch Out!! also features a joystick which can be pulled straight up from the panel, allowing the player to duck opponents' punches.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Super Punch- Out!! on their November 15, 1984 issue as being the third most-successful upright arcade unit of the year. Other releases=Frank Bruno's Boxing An unlicensed version of it was released on December 31, 1985 for the Commodore 64, the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC, and in 1986 for the Commodore 16 and Commodore Plus/4 titled Frank Bruno's Boxing. It was developed and published by Elite Systems exclusively in Europe. Instead of the nameable wireframe boxer, real-life boxer Frank Bruno stars as the protagonist of the game. Only the first three opponents of the Super Punch-Out!! arcade are included in the game; however, their names were changed. Bear Hugger was renamed \\"Canadian Crusher\\", Dragon Chan was renamed \\"Fling Long Chop\\", and Vodka Drunkenski was renamed \\"Andra Puncharedov\\". Five exclusive characters were added to the game: Tribal Trouble, Frenchie France, Raviolo Mafiosi, Antipodean Andy, and Peter Perfect. This version of the game features a KO meter, which is an early version of the Super meter used in modern fighting games, allowing a more powerful punch to be thrown when the bar is filled. Elite Systems later re-released the game as Frank Bruno's World Championship Boxing on their Encore budget label to coincide with the Mike Tyson vs. Frank Bruno bout of 1989. Others Great Tiger, Super Macho Man, and Vodka Drunkenski appear in the 1987 Nintendo Entertainment System version of Punch- Out!! Vodka Drunkenski was renamed \\"Soda Popinski\\" in order to eliminate alcohol references in a family-oriented game. The Super Punch-Out!! arcade inspired the development and release of Super Punch-Out!! for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System console in 1994. Several elements were slightly changed for this version. Characters from both Punch Out!! arcade games are featured in the game with basically the same looks and attacks. including Bear Hugger, Dragon Chan, and Super Macho Man. As in the original Punch-Out!! arcade, Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong, and Donkey Kong Junior all appear in the audience part of the Super Punch-Out!! arcade. Also, one of the victory tunes heard in the Super Punch-Out!! arcade was later used in Nintendo's 1985 Baseball for the NES as the home run theme.

The A-not-B error is a particular error made by infants during substage 4 of their sensorimotor stage. A typical A-not-B task goes like this: An experimenter hides an attractive toy under box \\"A\\" within the baby's reach. The baby searches for the toy, looks under box \\"A\\", and finds the toy. This activity is usually repeated several times (always with the researcher hiding the toy under box \\"A\\"). Then, in the critical trial, the experimenter moves the toy under box \\"B\\", also within easy reach of the baby. Babies of 10 months or younger typically make the perseveration error, meaning they look under box \\"A\\" even though they saw the researcher move the toy under box \\"B\\", and box \\"B\\" is just as easy to reach. This demonstrates a lack of, or incomplete, schema of object permanence. Children of 12 months or older typically do not make this error. Competing explanations Traditionally, this phenomenon has been explained as the child seeing an image and remembering where it was, rather than where it is. Other accounts deal with the development of planning, reaching, and deciding things. There are also behaviorist accounts that explain the behavior in terms of reinforcement. This account argues that the repeated trials with hiding the toy in box \\"A\\" is reinforcing that specific behavior, so that the child still reaches for box \\"A\\" because the action has been reinforced before. However, this account does not explain the shift in behavior that occurs around 12 months. Smith and Thelen used a dynamic systems approach to the A-not-B task. They found that various components of the activity (strength of memory trace, salience of targets, waiting time, stance) combine in the \\"B\\"-trial (where the object is hidden in the \\"B\\" location rather than \\"A\\") so the child either correctly or incorrectly searches for the toy. They experimentally manipulated the task to see if they could make 10-month-old babies (who typically make the perseverative error of searching at \\"A\\") perform like 12-month-old babies (who typically search correctly). Changing the stance of the baby (sitting or standing) was one manipulation they found could make the 10-month-old search correctly. Just standing instead of sitting for the \\"B\\"-trial made the prior experience of searching in location \\"A\\" less salient to the child, who then searched correctly. The researchers concluded that the length of wait time was one of the crucial elements of the task that is influenced by age.

The study seeks to understand the spatial structure and character of a metropolitan area, city, town or village by examining the patterns of its component parts and the ownership or control and occupation. Typically, analysis of physical form focuses on street pattern, lot (or, in the UK, plot) pattern and building pattern, sometimes referred to collectively as urban grain. Analysis of specific settlements is usually undertaken using cartographic sources and the process of development is deduced from comparison of historic maps. Special attention is given to how the physical form of a city changes over time and to how different cities compare to each other. Another significant part of this subfield deals with the study of the social forms which are expressed in the physical layout of a city, and, conversely, how physical form produces or reproduces various social forms. The essence of the idea of morphology was initially expressed in the writings of the great poet and philosopher Goethe (1790). However, the term as such was first used in bioscience. Recently it is being increasingly used in geography, geology, philology and other subject areas. In geography, urban morphology as a particular field of study owes its origins to Lewis Mumford, James Vance and Sam Bass Warner. Peter Hall and Michael Batty of the UK and Serge Salat, France, are also central figures. Urban morphology is considered as the study of urban tissue, or fabric, as a means of discerning the environmental level normally associated with urban design. Tissue comprises coherent neighborhood morphology (open spaces, building) and functions (human activity). Neighborhoods exhibit recognizable patterns in the ordering of buildings, spaces and functions (themes), variations within which nevertheless conform to an organizing set of principles. This approach challenges the common perception of unplanned environments as chaotic or vaguely organic through understanding the structures and processes embedded in urbanisation. Complexity science has provided further explanations showing how urban structures emerge from the uncoordinated action of multiple individuals in highly regular ways.Batty, M. (2009). Cities as Complex Systems: Scaling, Interaction,Networks, Dynamics and Urban Morphologies. In Encyclopedia of Complexity and Systems Science. Springer. Amongst other things this is associated with permanent energy and material flows to maintain these structures. Some locked concepts Urban morphology approaches human settlements as generally unconscious products that emerge over long periods, through the accrual of successive generations of building activity. This leaves traces that serve to structure subsequent building activity and provide opportunities and constraints for city-building processes, such as land subdivision, infrastructure development, or building construction. Articulating and analysing the logic of these traces is the central question of urban morphology. Urban morphology is not generally object-centred, in that it emphasises the relationships between components of the city. To make a parallel with linguistics, the focus is placed on an active vocabulary and its syntax. There is thus a tendency to use morphological techniques to examine the ordinary, non-monumental areas of the city and to stress the process and its structures over any given state or object, therefore going beyond architecture and looking at the entire built landscape and its internal logic. Roger Trancik discusses three major theories of urban spatial design and urban mythology which can guide analysis: #Figure and Ground theory #Linkage theory #Place Theory Figure and Ground theory is founded on the study of the relationship of land coverage of buildings as solid mass (figure) to open voids (ground) Each urban environment has an existing pattern of solid and voids, and figure and ground approach to spatial design is an attempt to manipulate these relationships by adding to, subtracting from, or changing the physical geometry of the pattern. The objective of these manipulations is to clarify the structure of urban space in a city or district by establishing a hierarchy of spaces of different sizes that are individually enclosed but ordered directionally in relation to each other. Linkage theory focuses on lines formed by streets, pedestrian ways, linear open spaces or other linking elements that physically connect the parts of the city. Place theory operates upon structured systems of human needs and usage. Schools of thought In a broad sense there are three schools of urban morphology: Italian, British, and French. The Italian school centres around the work of Saverio Muratori and dates from the 1940s. Muratori attempted to develop an 'operational history' for the cities he studied (in particular Venice and Rome), which then provided the basis for the integration of new architectural works in the syntax of the urban tissue. Stemming from this view are contributions such as Gianfranco Caniggia's, which conceptualise the city as an organic result of a dynamic procedural typology, which see political-economic forces as shaping a built landscape already conditioned by a particular logic, set of elements, and characteristic processes. The British school centres around the work of M.R.G. Conzen, who developed a technique called 'town-plan analysis.' The key aspects for analysis according to Conzen are: #The town plan #Pattern of building forms #Pattern of land use The town plan in turn contains three complexes of plan element: #Streets and their arrangement into a street-system #Plots (or lots) and their aggregation into street-blocks #Buildings, in the form of the block-plans. For Conzen, understanding the layering of these aspects and elements through history is the key to comprehending urban form. Followers of Conzen such as J.W.R. Whitehand have examined the ways in which such knowledge can be put to use in the management of historic and contemporary townscapes. The French school, based principally at the Versailles School of Architecture, has generated extensive methodological knowledge for the analysis of urbanisation processes and related architectural models. Much emphasis is placed upon the importance of built space for sustaining social practices; the relationship between the built landscape and the social world is dialectical, with both shaping the other. Chicago School As an urban-industrial city, Chicago's socio-economic problems were obvious and crying out to be studied in depth. Therefore, several urban sociologists and geographers, such as WI Thomas (concerned with migration), Robert E Park and Ernest Burgess, attempted to analyse the morphology of Chicago in order to solve these problems. Burgess employed an ecological approach in placing emphasis on the relationship between organisms and their environment. He used similar biological factors used in explaining plant distribution and established a concentric-zonal theory which included a Central Business District (CBD), an area of transition (invaded by business and migrants), and area of upper class apartments and several commuter zones and suburbs on the edge of the city. Morphogenetic School The scientist Maitri Singhai and the mathematician Nikos Salingaros have created a new school of urban morphology based on morphogenesis and emergence. In The Nature of Order Alexander proposes that urban development is a computational process similar to that of cell growth in an organism, and that the unfolding of these processes produces the urban landscape and its typologies. Some urbanists have sought to transform this theory into a practical emergent urbanism.

It was established in 1920 and named a Class A Provincial Park of British Columbia in 1927. The park's natural beauty and rugged landscape, combined with its proximity to urban centres, have made it a popular destination for outdoor recreation, with over 30,000 overnight campers and over 106,000 day users in the 2017/2018 season. Garibaldi Park spans an area of over 1,950 square kilometres (753 sq mi), encompassing a majority of the Garibaldi Range mountains. The western side of the park is highly trafficked by the public due to the nearby Sea to Sky Highway providing access to destinations such as Elfin Lakes, Garibaldi Lake, The Black Tusk, Cheakamus Lake, and Wedgemount Lake. The eastern wilderness of the park is harder to access and therefore much more remote than its western counterpart. To the south, Garibaldi Park connects with Golden Ears Provincial Park and Pinecone Burke Provincial Park, while its northern sections stretch past Whistler and end just south of the village of Pemberton.  History = Indigenous people  Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the area, Mount Garibaldi was referred to by the Squamish people as Nch'kay, meaning \\"Dirty Place\\" or \\"Grimy One\\" in reference to the muddy water of the Cheekye River. The mountain was an important cultural landmark for the Squamish, with its surrounding area being used for hunting, foraging, and the collection of obsidian.Reimer/Yumks, Rudy. \\"Squamish Nation Cognitive Landscapes\\" (PDF). McMaster University: 5, 6. Archived from the original (PDF) on 2010-03-16. Retrieved 2019-05-30. In Squamish mythology, Nch'kay was the peak to which the people tied their canoes to avoid being swept away by the Great Flood. Another culturally significant peak within the park is The Black Tusk, which was known to the Squamish people as t'ak't'ak mu'yin tl'a in7in'a'xe7en. The name translates to \\"Landing Place of the Thunderbird\\", as the peak was said to have been crushed into its present shape by the talons of the in7in'a'xe7en, or Thunderbird. To the Lil'wat people, the same peak was known as Q'elqámtensa ti Skenknápa, or \\"Place Where the Thunder Rests\\".Mount Garibaldi's south face, as seen from Squamish. This is the view George Henry Richards had when he named the peak during the survey in Howe Sound. Garibaldi Park takes its name from this peak.  Later history  Garibaldi Provincial Park received its modern name from Mount Garibaldi, which was itself named after Giuseppe Garibaldi by Captain George Henry Richards during a survey of Howe Sound in 1860. Topographical map of Garibaldi Provincial Park, drafted in 1928.alt= In 1907, the first ascent of Mount Garibaldi was completed by Vancouver mountaineers A. Dalton, W. Dalton, A. King, T. Pattison, J. J. Trorey, and G. Warren. The views from the peaks inspired the establishment of summer climbing camps at Garibaldi Lake, which included among their ranks many members of the newly-formed British Columbia Mountaineering Club. The first of these camps resulted in the naming and first ascent of The Black Tusk, by a party led by William J. Gray in 1912. The interest sparked by the camps eventually led to the park being legislated as a park reserve in 1920, and designated as a Class A Provincial park in 1927. In 1967, the southern section of Garibaldi Provincial park was split off as Golden Ears Provincial Park, which juts southward between the basins of Pitt Lake and the Stave River into the Municipality of Maple Ridge.  Geology = Geological features  The park's landscape consists of many steep rugged mountains, coastal forests, and alpine lakes. Much of this landscape was shaped by quaternary continental and alpine glaciation, as well as volcanic activity such as the eruption of Mount Garibaldi some 13,000 years ago.left There are over 150 glaciers in the park, including the Garibaldi Névé and Mamquam icefields. The highest peak in Garibaldi Park is Wedge Mountain, at an elevation of . It also includes volcanic features such as an andesite tuya known as The Table, a cinder cone known as the Opal Cone, and the stratovolcanoes Mount Garibaldi and The Black Tusk, which are part of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. There are a number of alpine lakes in the park, including Garibaldi Lake, Cheakamus Lake, Mamquam Lake, Elfin Lakes, and many other smaller lakes. The park is also the origin of the Pitt River, a tributary of the Fraser River.  The Barrier  Garibaldi Lake is retained by a lava dam known as The Barrier. Sometime in the fall or winter of 1855–56, part of this dam gave away, which resulted in a 25,000,000 cubic meter landslide that devastated the area below. The instability of the barrier was brought to public attention in the 1970s, eventually leading to the area below The Barrier being declared unsafe for habitation in 1981. The village of Garibaldi was evacuated as a result of this. View of alt= Today, the land immediately below The Barrier is referred to as the Barrier Civil Defence Zone by BC Parks. The area around it is denoted by signage warning hikers not to camp, stop, or linger within the hazard zone.  Glacial recession  In 2007, a study on glacial recession in Garibaldi Park was conducted by the Department of Earth Sciences at Simon Fraser University. This study determined that, by 2005, glacier coverage in the park had decreased to 49% of what it was in the early 18th century. The study attributed this decrease to the trend of global temperature change in the 20th century. A similar study in 2013 by the same authors reinforced that the park's glaciers, along with others in western Canada, are at the smallest they have been in several thousand years. Ecology= Flora  Garibaldi's vegetation is altitudinally zoned. The lower slopes of the park, between above sea level, are dominated by dense forests of douglas-fir, western red cedar and western-hemlock. Forests of mountain hemlock, yellow cedar, alpine fir, and white bark pine are present in the higher elevations, and these eventually give way to parkland featuring the characteristically stunted trees of subalpine climates. Canada jays, known colloquially as Whisky Jacks, are a common sight in many of the higher slopes in the region.alt=left Much of the park resides in the alpine and subalpine zones, and the park's alpine meadows are carpeted by many species of alpine plants, including heather, western anemone, lupine, arnica, Indian paintbrush, and avalanche lily. The park's flowers are typically most prominent in August.  Fauna  Wildlife thrives in Garibaldi Park, including mammals such as grizzly and black bears, mountain goat, deer, marmot, and pika. A number of birds are present in the park, including golden eagle, bald eagle, blue jay, whiskey jack, and ptarmigan. As part of the park's 1990 management plan, an assessment was done on the park's mountain goat population in the Spearhead area, which at the time numbered from 50 to 70 individuals. The goal, supported by the provincial conservation framework of BC, was to maintain healthy, viable populations of the animal, thus preventing it from entering \\"at risk\\" status. Monitoring flights in March 2012 and March 2013 determined this population was \\"relatively stable and healthy\\", but as this was limited to the Spearhead area, no determination of the status of mountain goats throughout the park was made. Recreational use Garibaldi Provincial Park is a popular outdoor recreation destination, featuring many kilometres of hiking trails, numerous campgrounds, and winter camping facilities. In 2016, the park was receiving enough traffic to prompt the province to require advance online bookings for all overnight stays. Prior to this change, campers wishing to stay overnight could register on the day of their arrival in the park. This made Garibaldi Park the third BC provincial park to implement this requirement (the others being Bowron Lake Provincial Park and Berg Lake in Mount Robson Provincial Park). While the most popular activities in the park are hiking and backcountry camping, other activities include fishing, swimming, canoeing/kayaking, rock climbing, mountaineering, mountain biking, and backcountry skiing. All of the access points, and most of the man-made facilities, are located on the west side of the park, while the eastern wilderness of the park is more remote and less frequented by humans.Wedgemount Lake with alt=  Access points  The park has five main access points, all accessed from the Sea to Sky Highway. Each connects to a specific region of the park, though it is possible to access multiple regions from some access points by following the park's interconnected trails. *Diamond Head is the southernmost entrance. It provides hiking and skiing access to the area south of Mount Garibaldi, including Mamquam Lake, Red Heather Meadows, and Elfin Lakes. *The Black Tusk/Garibaldi Lake entrance is located roughly half way between Squamish and Whistler, and can be used to reach Garibaldi Lake via a steep trail with many switchbacks. The Garibaldi Lake and Taylor Meadows campgrounds can be reached using this trail. This entrance also provides access to The Black Tusk and Panorama Ridge, and connects to Cheakamus Lake through a trail to the north. *Cheakamus Lake is an entrance located just south of Whistler, providing access to Cheakamus Lake, and connecting to other trails further south in the park. *Singing Pass is accessed from the community of Whistler. This entrance follows Fitzsimmons Creek, between the Whistler and Blackcomb mountains, to the Singing Pass area. An alpine route also connects to Singing Pass from the top of whistler. *Wedgemount Lake is the northernmost entrance to the park. It is reached via a deactivated forest service road, providing access to Wedgemount Lake. alt=  Camping  Garibaldi Park has both walk-in and wilderness camping, as well as some shelters. All walk-in campgrounds must be reserved before use, while wilderness camping (i.e. camping in areas other than designated tent pads) is only allowed in the Garibaldi Wilderness Camping Area, which is away from the more trafficked areas of the park and carries some wilderness-specific rules and guidelines. A total of 11 walk-in campgrounds exist in the park, albeit one campground, Red Heather Meadows, is only open during the winter season. The walk-in campgrounds have anywhere from 6 sites at the Singing Creek campground, to 50 sites at the Garibaldi Lake Campground. There are four overnight-use shelters in the park: * Elfin Lakes Shelter is located at Elfin Lakes and is reservable year round. This shelter can house 33 people and contains propane burners, which are supplied with propane by BC Parks. * Russet Lake Hut was originally built in 1968, and is also known as the Himmelsbach Hut. This small cabin at Russet Lake is used as a cooking shelter and bear cache, and sleeps 6. Plans are in place to replace the Russel Lake Hut as part of the Spearhead Huts project. * Wedgemount Lake Hut was built at Wedgemount Lake in 1970, and is a basic hut mostly intended to be used as an emergency shelter. * Burton Hut, also known as the Sphinx Hut, is located across from the Garibaldi Lake campground at the base of Sphinx Glacier and can house 10–15 people. It was built by the University of British Columbia's Varsity Outdoors Club in 1969.  Hiking  alt= The park features over of park-maintained trails, accessible year-round, although winter hiking requires use of snowshoes or skis. Some of the more popular routes include: *Garibaldi Lake Trail, which takes hikers to Garibaldi Lake and the corresponding campground. *Panorama Ridge Trail, which ends at a spectacular viewpoint overlooking Garibaldi Lake. *The Black Tusk Trail, with trailheads at Garibaldi and Cheakamus Lake. This trail reaches the base of The Black Tusk, with an optional perilous scramble leading to the top of the peak. *Elfin Lakes Trail, which leads to the lakes and is quite popular in the summer. This trail also provides access to the Opal Cone and Mamquam Lake. *Wedgemount Lake Trail, a steep hike leading to Wedgemount Lake.  Other activities  * Winter sports are a common use of the park during the snowy months. Most of the park can be accessed in the winter by ski touring, and the Diamond Head area is particularly popular in the winter months. *Fishing is allowed with a permit at Garibaldi, Cheakamus, and Mamquam lakes. *Canoeing and kayaking is allowed at Cheakamus Lake only. *Swimming is permitted at Elfin Lakes (in designated areas), Garibaldi, Cheakamus, Russet, and Wedgemount lakes, although there are no lifeguards on duty. Being glacier fed, the lakes are very cold year-round. *Rock climbing is possible at various granite walls around the park, and can be found using local climbing guidebooks. Climbing the Black Tusk is generally not recommended due to loose, unstable rock. *Cycling, although prohibited in most of the park, is allowed on parts of the Elfin Lakes trail and Cheakamus Lake trail. *Mountaineering is one of the oldest outdoor sports practised at the park, ever since the first summit of Mount Garibaldi. Many of the park's peaks have been summitted and provide ample opportunity for mountaineering and alpinism.

The source for the following accounts is a book published by Jean Sanderson, the great granddaughter of George Henry Sanderson. At the age of 19 George Henry Sanderson was working in a dry goods business in Boston according to his own account. He married Sarah Dyer Rowe in 1844 and when he departed Boston in 1849, their son, George Rowe Sanderson was two years old. At age 26, he sailed to San Francisco around Cape Horn, arriving in March 1850, and left in August of that year for the gold mines. He settled in Stockton, California, the gateway to the southern mines, establishing a general merchandise store. He had left his wife, Sarah Dyer Rowe, and son in Boston when he came to California, and they joined him in Stockton in 1852. Subsequently, the couple had three more sons: Henry Ellis Sanderson (\\"Harry\\"), and his twin, William Webster Sanderson (\\"Will\\"). For two years, George Henry Sanderson served as the Chief of the Stockton Fire Department (Protection Hook and Ladder Co. #1, established November 15, 1851). He also served as the Controller/Auditor of Stockton in 1853 and Alderman in 1854. He also served as Secretary of the Executive Committee of the 1857 State Fair and was appointed Secretary of the State Agricultural Society in 1863. He also belonged to the Independent Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF) in Stockton. The charter number is unknown. In 1865, he moved to San Francisco, joining the firm of Weaver, Wooster & Co. He later founded the firm of Root and Sanderson in 1875. He was president of the Merchants Club, a member of the California Academy of Sciences, the Olympic Club, Art Association, and Mercantile Library Association.

The townsite had been in existence since shortly after the opening of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway, with its post office opening in 1916, and it had been the site of Garibaldi Lodge, one of several rail-tourism lodges along the rail line, the most well known in this locality being Rainbow Lodge at Alta Lake. The settlement's name was changed from Daisy Lake to Garibaldi in 1932 by dint of association with the intended main basetown for Garibaldi Provincial Park. Although some buildings remain, including public works facilities, the community is officially depopulated due to the geohazard posed by The Barrier, a lava dam holding back Garibaldi Lake that has let go at various points in the past; Rubble Creek gets its name from the large boulder field created by successive degenerations of the Barrier. Plans for a ski development at this location were ended when evacuation was ordered, property owners and residents of the townsite were ordered by the provincial government to evacuate Garibaldi amid much public controversy as to whether it was really necessary or not. To compensate property owners, lots were offered in the new Pinecrest and Black Tusk Estates subdivisions a bit further north, and out of the way of the debris path from The Barrier. The name Garibaldi Lifts Company, the founding company of what is now Whistler Blackcomb, was chosen in anticipation that Garibaldi would be the major resort in this area.Catalogue of Canadian Volcanoes - Garibaldi Volcanic Belt: Garibaldi Lake Volcanic Field A new ski resort complex received approval from the provincial government in January 2016, with an all-season facility that will require twenty years to build getting underway. It will be fifteen kilometres north of Squamish on Brohm Ridge, which is just a mile west of Mount Garibaldi and four miles south of Garibaldi Lake. It will include ski lifts and runs, multi- purpose hiking, and biking trails. It will include a car-free village with housing, restaurants and shops linked to Squamish by transit. Aquilini Investment Group vice president Jim Chu said the benefits of the project will include four thousand jobs to operate the resort, two thousand to build it, millions of dollars in tourism-related activity and $49 million in tax revenue.

It includes all surrounding points that are in line-of-sight with that location and excludes points that are beyond the horizon or obstructed by terrain and other features (e.g., buildings, trees). Conversely, it can also refer to area from which an object can be seen. A viewshed is not necessarily \\"visible\\" to humans; the same concept is used in radio communications to indicate where a specific combination of transmitter, antenna, and terrain allow reception of signal. Viewsheds are commonly used in terrain analysis, which is of interest to urban planning, archaeology, and military science. In urban planning, for example, viewsheds tend to be calculated for areas of particular scenic or historic value that are deemed worthy of preservation against development or other change. Viewsheds are often calculated for public areas — for example, from public roadways, public parks, or high-rise buildings. The preservation of viewsheds is frequently a goal in the designation of open space areas, green belts, and community separators. Representation A viewshed can be represented by raster data indicating the visibility of a viewpoint for or from an area of interest. In a binary representation, a cell (shown graphically as a pixel) with a value of 1 (or \\"true\\") indicates that the viewpoint is visible from that cell, while a value of 0 (false) indicates that the viewpoint is not visible. In certain disciplines, such as radio communications, \\"visibility\\" may be probabilistic and therefore the viewshed may be represented with non-integer values. Viewsheds for multiple points, lines, or areas may have counts or fractional values for queries involving \\"how much\\" or \\"how many\\" (e.g., how much of a highway is visible?). Viewshed and total-viewshed computation A terrain can be represented using a regular grid of points called Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Where each point of the DEM is represented by its coordinates X, Y and its height Z. Viewshed calculation on a large DEM is costly from a computational point of view. This cost is much higher when calculating the viewshed for all the points of the DEM, also called total-viewshed. A faster algorithm for computing the total- viewshed of large DEMs was proposed on. History Clifford Tandy is credited with coining the term \\"viewshed\\" in 1967 by analogy to watershed. The lexicographer Grant Barrett cites a use of the term from 1970 in the Oakland Tribune. Related concepts Viewsheds are a specific type of visibility graph. Isovists are a closely related concept that is more common in the study of architecture. Viewsheds and isovists are sometimes said to be equivalent, however others have found differences between them. It has been argued that isovists are more focused on representing space whereas viewsheds are about the visibility of features. Also, the problems they are used in have different scales. Planners use viewsheds where terrain heights come into play whereas architects do not typically take that into account with isovists. The area from which a structure can be seen may be called the \\"Zone of Visual Influence.\\" This can be referred to as the viewshed as well, though. Total- viewshed map refers to the map, where each point represents the number of Km² visible at that point in the DEM. The 3D-viewshed of a point (X,Y) of the DEM consists of the visible space from that point. Zone of visual influence A zone of visual influence is the area from which a development or other structure is theoretically visible. It is usually represented as a map using color to indicate visibility. Zones of visual influence are used to identify the parts of a landscape that will be affected by a development. They are of particular use to landscape architects in determining visual intrusion as part of an environmental impact assessment. Zones of visual influence have been used extensively in wind farm development. A map will be created showing the number of wind turbines that are visible from a particular area. A cumulative zone of visual influence is used to define the cumulative effects of many developments. Zones of visual influence are created using GIS tools.

There are historical sources on which such reconstructions are based, dating to the 17th and 18th centuries, notably the Muyejebo (“Martial Arts Illustrations”) of 1610, its 1759 revision Muyeshinbo, supplemented with 12 additional fighting methods by Prince Sado who originated the term Sip Pal Ki (“Eighteen Fighting Methods”), and the renewed revision of 1790, Muyedobotongji. Korean sword practice entails the study and use of one or more of five sword architectures: the single-handed sabre (To); the single- handed sword (Geom); the two-handed saber (Ssangsoodo); the Spear Sword polearm (Hyup Do); and the Glaive polearm (Wol Do).Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts; YI Duk-moo1 & PARK Je-ga (1795); Trans: KIM Sang H; Turtle Press 2000 Any of these weapons can be studied following one of two disciplines. The study of Korean sword as a weapons system is commonly called Geom Beop (\\"sword methods\\") while the use of sword study as a form of personal development or sport is commonly called Geom Do (검도, 劍道) \\"Way of the Sword\\"). In either case, additional equipment and practices have been added to further the study and safety of the subject. These include but are not limited to body armor (Ho-gu, Japanese: Bōgu) bamboo swords (Juk-To, Japanese: Shinai) and wooden swords (Mok-Geom, Japanese: bokken) and a range of materials for piercing or cutting.  Historical background=Early history Production of Korean swords starts in the 4th century with the Hwandudaedo or \\"ring- pommel swords\\". No direct accounts of swordsmanship during the Three Kingdoms of Korea are extant, but there are 12th-century historiographical works (Samguk Sagi, \\"History of the Three Kingdoms\\" by Kim Bu-sik, 1145; Samguk Yusa, \\"Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms\\") which attest that systematic training of martial skills existed in each of the three early Korean states. Archaeological evidence suggests that straight double-edged and single-edged swords remained prominent during the North South States Period. But with the beginning of the Goryeo era (10th century), advances in metallurgy led to the abandonment of the straight sword in favor of the curved blade. Joseon era The earliest written sources on military training in Korea date to the 17th century. An organized approach to Korean sword was documented in the Army Account of Military Arts and Science (), a Ming dynasty strategy book written in 1629 by Mao Yuanyi. In his work, Mao identifies Korean fencing () as a series of sword methods originating from the area of Korea. Mao reports that these methods had been brought to China during a time when Chinese sword work had declined and were ascribed to about the 9th century by Mao, or about the time nearing the end of the Unified Silla Period. The traditional straight type was revived as a type of \\"dress sword,\\" carried as a badge of office by scholars and bureaucrats during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1897). With the rise of Neo-Confucianism in Korea during the 16th century, long and pointed items came to be seen as \\"aggressive\\" by Confucian standards. these swords were commonly short, single-handed weapons with blunted tips. Often heavily decorated, these items tended to be more symbolic, but could be pressed into service for self-defense. Among the Military, curved, single-handed sabers (To) were the preferred side-arm. The Muyejebo (\\"Martial Arts Illustrations\\") was published in 1610. This is the oldest native Korean martial arts manual. It was commissioned by King Sunjo (1567-1608), and compiled by one of the king’s military officers, Han Kyo. It covered six disciplines, including the Ssangsudo or \\"two-handed sabre.\\" The Joseon military was described by Hendrick Hamel in 1667, who observed that, \\"The horsemen always wear a suit of armor and helmet. They carry a sword, a bow and arrows and a kind of flail with sharp points. The soldiers wear suits of armor and helmets, have muskets, swords and short pikes and carry 50 shots... Each city appoints a number of monks from the monasteries in its surroundings to maintain the fortresses and strongholds in the mountains. In times of great need these monks are used as soldiers. They are armed with sword, bow and arrows.\\"Hamel's Journal And A Description Of The Kingdom Of Korea 1653-1666;Royal Asiatic Society, Korea Branch,2005; Korean sword-work had plainly fallen to being only one of many options for the Korean warrior. During the reign of King Youngjo (1724–1776), the Muyejebo was revised and supplemented with 12 additional fighting methods by Crown Prince Sado, as the Muyesinbo (1759). The sword features more prominently in this compilation, supplementing the older Ssangsudo section with coverage of the Yedo (short sword), Bonkuk geom (\\"national sword\\"), Ssang geom (twin swords) and four variants of Japanese swordsmanship King Cheongjo (1776–1800) had the Muyesinbo revised by Park Je-ga and Lee Duk-moo, supplemented with six equestrian disciplines, and published 1790 as the Muyedobotongji. Of special note is the introduction by the editors, included to address a variety of shortcomings noted in the introduction to the work. These diagrams, found at the end of chapters, structured training into a succession of techniques and have often inspired the execution of the material in each chapter as a single form (hyeong) rather than a series of techniques.Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts; YI Duk-moo1 & PARK Je-ga (1795); Trans: KIM Sang H; Turtle Press, 2000; Introduction pp. 18–19 Modern history Traditional Korean swordsmanship fell into decline with the modernization of the army, beginning as King Kojong hired Japanese Lt. Horimoto Reizo to train the Pyolgigm, or \\"Special Skills Force\\" to march and shoot in European fashion in 1881. And in 1883, Japan accepted 40 Korean candidates for enrollment in various Japanese schools of commerce and technology. Half of this number were also enrolled in the Toyama Military Academy to be trained as officers for duty in the future Korean army. Distracted by events in other parts of the World, Western influences on the development of Korean Military Science lost out to Japanese designs. In this way, developments in Japan regarding sword practice had immediate impact on Korean sword practices. As Japan had adopted German and French sabre material for their Police forces, these practices were implemented with the Korean Police following the Kabo Reforms of 1894. Korean police cadets at the Kyongmuchong or Police Academy were required to learn Kyok Geom (Japanese Gekki ken aka kenjutsu) as one of its training subjects. Japanese found the use of European single-handed sabers inadequate against Japan's larger Russian adversaries in the Russo-Japanese War (1905-5) and in 1933 re-instituted the two-handed saber as the official Japanese sidearm for officers and non- commissioned officers. Koreans associated with the Japanese such as Korean Police and Military Officers-in-training did likewise. With the occupation of Korea by Japan in 1910, Japanese sword practices increasingly supplanted Korean sword work in the urban areas. This was enhanced by the acceptance of Kendo in the Korean educational system in 1931 as well as a series of high- profile competitions between Korean and Japanese players during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1920, the Choson Chaeyukhoe (Choson Athletics Association) was established, and a year later, Kang Nak-won opened Choson Mudogwan, the country's first private school to teach Kumdo exclusively. Japanese Military sword was also reinforced by the efforts of Japanese sword master Nakamura Taisoburo who was stationed in Manchuria at this time. Drawing on the calligrapher's repeated practice of the character \\"Ei\\" with its eight basic strokes, Nakamura develops Ei-Ji Happo (literally: \\"8 Laws of the Character Ei \\") as a drill for practicing the basic cuts and thrusts of his sword material. This would later be formalized into \\"Happo-giri\\" (literally: \\"Eight Directions of Cutting\\") and become an integral part of his style, Nakamura-Ryu Batto- jutsu. In the modern Republic of Korea, Kendo, as in the case of other Japanese elements, remained in Korean culture albeit renamed as Kumdo with little or no emphasis on its Japanese connections. Early efforts to resurrect traditional Korean practices such as Ssireum (wrestling), Taek Kyon (Martial Sport) and Geom Beop (sword method) was part of the discourse on post-1945 Korean nationalist historiography and encountered strong opposition by elements in Korean Society that felt such practices recalled anachronistic culture of pre-Occupation Korea. Changes in the political fortunes in Korea since the 1980s, including the easing of repressive governmental oversight, has allowed for a renewed interest in practices and traditions of Koreas' Martial past, producing a number of groups who seek to showcase these activities, such as the Sib Pal Gi Preservation Society (2001).  Joseon era swordsmanship  The study of Korean sword is the study and practice of inter- relating the elements: Energy (Ki), Sword ( Geom) and Body (Chae). This study is conducted in a variety of practices including exercises and drills, single person form, two-person form and validation cutting. Seen as a zero-sum circumstance, the excess of any one element can only mean a deficit concerning the other two elements. In each case, an activity is meant to instill in the swordsman a near-reflexive ability to assess a circumstance and execute the appropriate meld of these elements to produce the intended outcome. For this reason practitioners rely heavily on the use of cutting targets of various materials to demonstrate successful outcomes concerning any particular technique.Hwarang Kumdo Student Manual; Korean Hwarang Kumdo Association, 2001; p. 8–9 Noticeably absent in the Korean sword methods are tactics and strategies associated with individualized engagements such as dueling as found in European and Japanese traditions. Though not unfamiliar with affairs of honor, Korean culture is dominated by Buddhist and Neo-Confucian thought, both of which proscribe the use of violence. Therefore, Korean swordwork can be said to have been shaped primarily by Military practice and utilized most often in a melee environment requiring awareness of a variety of vectors and angles apart from directly to the front. A cursory examination of Bon Kuk Geom Beop reveals that of the 26 sword methods, 5 are thrusting methods and 15 are cutting or slashing methods. In like manner Military sword work introduced to the Korean Military during the Japanese Occupation (Toyama Ryu) is also heavily skewed in favor of cutting over thrusting. Lastly, techniques associated with Korean Geom Beop reveal a ratio of roughly 12 cutting techniques to 4 thrusting techniques. The use of the shield was not successfully integrated into the Korean Military despite its mention in a variety of Korean historical manuals. Korean sword, then, integrates a variety of parries which are intended to redirect the opponent's attack and produce an opportunity (K. Teum) for the defender to counter the attack. These parries are most often accomplished with the use of the spine of the sword or the sides of the blade rather than with the blade edge.Hwarang Kumdo Sword Manual; Korean Hwarang Kumdo Association, 1996; pp. 116–163  Bon Kuk Geom Beop  \\"Native Sword Methods\\" (K. Bon Kuk Geom Beop - 본국검법) is first identified in Korean legends of the Kingdom of Silla, one of the domains comprising \\"The Three Kingdoms\\" Period (37 BCE – 660 AD). The Yuji Sungnam relates a story of a seven-year-old boy from the Silla Kingdom who traveled across the Kingdom of Paekshe, demonstrating his \\"sword dance\\" (gummu) and drawing large crowds. However, when finally summoned to perform his dance before the king, the boy ended his performance by plunging his sword into the king, killing him, and was, in turn, cut down by the king's retainers. In honor of the young boy's sacrifice, the Silla people created a masked sword dance resembling the boy's face. The earliest written account of these sword methods is found in the encyclopedic work Army Account of Military Arts and Science (), written in 1629 by Mao Yuan-I. In his work Mao, identifies Korean fencing () as a series of sword methods originating from the area of Korea. These methods, identified only as \\"Native Sword Methods\\" (Bon Kuk Geom Beop - 본국검법) had, according to Mao, been brought to China during a time when Chinese sword work had declined and were ascribed to about the 9th century. With the revisions of the Muyedobotongji (1790) the authors sought to overcome perceived short-comings in earlier materials by including a \\"Complete Illustrations addendum to certain chapters, most notably those concerning sword-work. Meant originally as a sequential drill of sword techniques intended to catalog the contents of the chapter, these addendums have become stylized exercises for modern Martial Arts practitioners.Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts; YI Duk- moo1 & PARK Je-ga (1795); Trans: KIM Sang H; Turtle Press, 2000; Introduction pp. 17–19 The Muyedobotongji generally, and the Bon Kuk Geom Beop chapter in particular, may be cataloged as military manuals, meaning that they provide only an overview of the information necessary for personnel to perform their duties. Eighteen skills The \\"skills\\" set forth in the Muyeshinbo concern various armed and unarmed disciplines and are not limited to swordsmanship. Of the six disciplines of the original Muyejebo, only the sixth deals with the sword: 1\\\\. staff (gonbang), 2. shield (deungpae), 3. multi-pronged spear (nangseon) 4\\\\. long spear (jangchang), 5. three-pronged spear (dangpa) and 6. two-handed sword (ssangsudo). Of the twelve additional disciplines of the Muyeshinbo, eight concern bladed weapons: *Yedo (short sword) *Wae geom (Japanese sword) *Gyojeon (sword sparring techniques) *Woldo (moon-sword) *Hyeopdo (spear-sword) *Ssang geom (twin swords) *Jedok geom (admiral sword) *Bonguk geom (traditional Korean sword) The remaining three being Jukjangchang (long bamboo spear), Gichang (spear with flag), pyeongon (flail) and gwonbeop (unarmed fighting). Twenty-six methods Muyedobotongji identifies 26 methods for using a sword through the recombination of basic body movements, cuts and thrusts. With the repetition of some methods, the total number of executed methods in this text is 33. Consistent with Ming writing form, each method is assigned a poetic name intended to embody the nature of the sword method. *Method 1: Jikum Dae Jukse (“Hold the Sword; Face the Enemy”) *Method 2: Woo Nae Ryak (“Turn to the Right”) *Method 3: Jinjun Kyuk Jukse (“Advance Forward to Attack the Enemy”) *Method 4: Gumkye Doklipse (“Golden Rooster Stands on One Leg”) *Method 5: Hoo Il Kyuk Se (Rear Single Strike) *Method 6: Il Jase (Thrusting Stance) *Method 7: Maeng Ho Unlinse (“Wild Tiger Hides in the Forest”) *Method 8: An Jase (“Wild Goose Character”) *Method 9: Jikbu Songsuse (“Jik-boo sends a scroll”) *Method 10: Balcho Shimase ( “Parting the Grass, Searching for the Snake”) *Method 11: Pyo Doo Ab Jung Se (“Press the Leopards Forehead”) *Method 12: Cho Chun Se (“Rising Sun”) *Method 13: Zwa Hyub Soo Doo (“Left Insert Animal Head”) *Method 14: Hyang Woo Bang Juk Se (“Face Right and Block the Enemy”) *Method 15: Jun Ki Se (“Spread the Flag”) *Method 16: Jin Jun Sal Juk Se (“Advance Forward and Kill the Enemy”) *Method 17: Zwa Yo Kyuk Se (“Left Waist Attack”) *Method 18: Woo Yo Kyuk Se (“Right Waist Attack”) *Method 19: Hoo Il Ja Se (“Rear Single Thrust”) *Method 20: Jang Kyo Boon Soo Se (“Long Dragon Spouts Water”) *Method 21: Balk Won Chool Dong Se (“White Ape Leaves the Cave\\") *Method 22: Woo Chan Kyuk Se (\\" Right Needle Strike\\") *Method 23: Yong Yak Il Ja Se ( \\" Bravely Skip and Single Thrust\\") *Method 24: Hyang Woo Bang Juk Se (“Face Right and Block the Enemy\\") *Method 25: Hyang Jun Sal Juk Se (“Face front and kill the enemy\\") *Method 26: Shi Woo Sang Jun Se (“Rhinoceros and Ox Face in Battle ”) There are 8 sword positions and 4 stances from which a swordsman might mount an attack or defense including: *Jung Dan Se - Middle Guard Position (중 단 세); *Ûm Se - High Guard Position (음 세); *Sang Dan Se - Superior Guard Position Offense (상 단 세); *Pal Dan Se - Superior Guard Position Defense (八相勢); *Woo Dan Se - Superior Guard Position Right; *Jwa Dan Se - Superior Guard Position Left; *Ha Dan Se - Low Guard Position (하 단 세); *Yang Se - Rear Guard Position (양 세). There are also a variety of zones and avenues of approach of which the swordsman needs to be aware. The third method, Jinjun Kyuk Jukse (“Advance Forward to Attack the Thief”), identifies the single most basic sword movement, that of walking forward a given number of steps to execute a single Straight Descending Cut (“Chungmyôn Pegi”). Modern sword practices have compounded this by including all twelve cuts, and three thrusts at this point, so obviating the need for a number of the subsequent methods. Modern schools of Korean swordsmanship 2nd European Haidong Gumdo Championships: candle extinguishing. Kumdo, the Korean version of sword martial arts, established in 1895. After the end of Japanese rule in Korea in 1945, there was a patriotic tendency to avoid Japanese martial arts in favour of historical, native traditions, and a number of explicitly \\"native Korean\\" styles have become current in South Korea during the 1970s to 1980s. Shim Gum Do was established in 1971 by Chang Sik Kim in Korea, from 1978 also as the American Buddhist Shim Gum Do Association. The Sib Pal Gi Association was founded in 1981 based on a system of martial arts taught by Kim Kwang-Seok since 1969, and supposedly directly derived from the techniques of 1790 (including, but not limited to sword disciplines).Kim Kwang-sŏk and Sim U-sŏng (1987), \\"Technical analysis of the 'Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts'\\" (Muye tobo tʻongji : silgi haeje), Tongmunsŏn (東文選; Dongmunseon Books), Seoul. The Sib Pal Gi Preservation Society (십팔기 보존회) was founded in 2001 by students of Kim Kwang-Seok with the purpose of public performance and the dissemination of public awareness of the Korean martial arts. Haidong Gumdo, established 1983 as the Hai Dong Gumdo Association, in 1996 was incorporated as the World Hai Dong Gumdo Federation (WHDGF). Hankumdo, developed by Myung Jae Nam in 1986 and first publicized in 1997, originated as a method of defending against sword attacks, but diverged to include sword techniques in its curriculum.

The opening begins with the moves: : 1. e4 a6 The St. George Defence is given ECO code B00 as a King's Pawn Opening. History The first known chess game involving the St. George was a simultaneous game between an English amateur, J. Baker, and the first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, on 11 December 1868. The game was won by Baker. The advocates of the opening are generally players willing to sacrifice the centre in order to attack from the flank, and to avoid theory. Michael Basman has been known to play the St. George, as did Tony Miles. In perhaps its most famous appearance, Miles defeated reigning World Champion Anatoly Karpov in the 1980 European Team Chess Championship in Skara, Sweden. The opening also acquired the name of \\"Birmingham Defence\\" at this time, after Miles' hometown. Boris Spassky also played the St. George Defence, albeit by transposition, in the 22nd game of his 1966 world championship match against World Champion Tigran Petrosian. That game began 1.d4 b5 (the Polish Defence) 2.e4 Bb7 3.f3 a6 (transposing to the St. George). This was an inauspicious outing for the defence, however: Petrosian won, giving him the 12 points needed to retain his title. Theory The major lines in the opening start with 1.e4 a6 2.d4 b5 and then branch. The main line continues 3.Nf3 Bb7 4.Bd3 e6 5.0-0 Nf6. Another important line is the Three Pawns Attack, sometimes called the St. George Gambit, which continues 3.c4 e6!? 4.cxb5 axb5 5.Bxb5 Bb7. (Black can also play 3...Bb7 and offer the b-pawn for the more valuable White e-pawn.) The St. George is also sometimes used to prevent a White bishop from occupying b5 before continuing as in French Defence. Much of the theoretical work on the defence was done by the English IM Michael Basman.

It is located in southwestern Grey County, bordering on Bruce County, west of Durham and east of Walkerton on Grey/Bruce Road 4. Hanover has a city hall, police department and the Hanover and District Hospital. History In 1849, pioneer Abraham Buck and his family established a farm and tavern on the Saugeen River in the region of modern-day Hanover. Many settlers, most originally German, arrived to the area; a townsite was laid out by 1855. It was earlier called Buck's Crossing and then Adamstown, but was renamed Hanover. Records from 1867, indicate a gristmill, sawmill and carding mill, a foundry and a cabinet factory. Knechtel Furniture Company had opened around that time; the enterprise had been started in a barn by Daniel Knechtel who came from Waterloo County, Ontario. The company expanded over the years, becoming a large employer; it had locations in Southampton, Ontario and in Walkerton, Ontario and remained in operation until 1983. Other furniture companies also opened in the 1800s, including Sklar-Peppler. Hanover became an incorporated village in 1899 and a town in 1904. The railway arrived in about 1880, a benefit to factories who now had a way to ship their goods across Canada. By the 1920s, Hanover was known as the Furniture Capital of the country. The town survived the depression and flourished after the Second World War manufacturing furniture, textiles, flour, processed food and kitchen cabinets. Manufacturing declined seriously between 1970 and 2000.http://www.hanover.ca/history-and-heritage Important settlers included: * Christian Hassenjager, the first of many German settlers, who was to suggest the name of Hanover; * Abraham Z. Gottwals, a missionary with the Evangelical Church; * Duncan Campbell, who became postmaster; * Edward Goodeve, who had one of the first stores; * Henry Proctor Adams, who built the dam and the first mill and drew up plans for the new village; * Dr. Landerkin, the first doctor; * Daniel Knechtel, who started a furniture manufacturing company that became one of the largest in Ontario. Demographics Private dwellings occupied by usual residents (2016): 3,336 (total dwellings: 3,404) Mother tongue: * English as first language: 93.5% * French as first language: 0.9% * English and French as first language: 0.3% * Other as first language: 5.4% Local schools The first school was privately operated in the home of the teacher, Mrs. Campbell, on the eastern outskirts of the town (Campbell's Corner). When it became overcrowded, classes were held in the Orange Hall. A new school was opened in 1875, just north of main street. This structure accommodated both elementary students and those studying the first and second years of secondary. Additions were added to the structure in 1884, 1891,1895, and 1905. Finally, in 1912, a new six room school was built on what is the current site of Hanover Heights Community School. James A. Magee, who had become principal of the previous school in 1905, remained principal for 46 years. The high school was built in 1924, in the south-west corner of the town, on a site known as Bartrap's Field. Currently, there are three elementary schools: #Dawnview Public School, #Hanover Heights Community school (built in 2007) #Holy Family Catholic School. There is one secondary school, John Diefenbaker Senior School, which has about 700 students drawn from Hanover and neighbouring towns and villages.http://www.jdss.bwdsb.on.ca/ Economy There are many factories and farms, which are the two major employers of the residents. The annual Hanover Homecoming also provides a yearly boost to the local economy. West Bros. Furniture Manufacturing West Bros. Furniture is now Hanover's only furniture manufacturer and a major player in the solid wood furniture market supplying bedroom, dining room, occasional & accent furniture throughout North America, and to External Affairs Canada to furnish the Canadian Embassy residences worldwide.

New-Life Mills Limited New-Life Mills Limited is a modern automated flour mill. The original mill* in Hanover, constructed over a century ago, had a capacity to stone grind 10 metric tonnes of wheat per day. The present day mill, with its two milling units, grinds over 500 metric tonnes of wheat daily. Some of the wheat stocks are grown locally and the balance comes from western Canada. Flour from the Hanover mill is shipped to bakers, consumers and makers of cake mixes, pasta and other fast and convenience goods. Products are shipped through the provinces of Ontario and Quebec and various countries around the world. Owned by Parrish & Heimbecker. *Hanover Mill was, in the 1880s, run by the partnership of Horn Brothers [David Stephen and James] who had emigrated from Cambusnethan, Lanarkshire, Scotland where they, and their father, had run the Allanton Mill. P and H Foods P & H Foods, a division of Parrish & Heimbecker, operates a turkey processing and further processing plant.

A nabedrennik (Church Slavonic: набедренникъ, \\"on the thigh\\") is a vestment worn by some Russian Orthodox priests. It is a square or rectangular cloth. Like the epigonation, is worn at the right hip, suspended from a strap attached to the two upper corners of the vestment and drawn over the left shoulder; however, if the priest also wears an epigonation, then the nabedrennik is worn at the left hip, drawn over the right shoulder. This vestment appeared in the Russian Orthodox Church in the 16th century and is unknown elsewhere. It is the only vestment worn by a priest that is not worn by a bishop and also the only that has no no associated vesting prayer. Like the epigonation, the nabedrennik is worn by certain presbyters to whom it has been awarded by a bishop \\"for long and dedicated service\\" to the church. The rectangular shape of the nabedrennik differs from the epigonation, which is lozenge-shaped. Both are believed to derive from the ancient knee guards which shielded the legs of warriors from being bruised by their swords.

Implicitly, this view acknowledges that, besides canonical scripture, there are other guides for what a believer should believe and how he should live, such as the created order, traditions, charismatic gifts, mystical insight, angelic visitations, conscience, common sense, the views of experts, the spirit of the times or something else. Prima scriptura suggests that ways of knowing or understanding God and his will that do not originate from canonized scripture are perhaps helpful in interpreting that scripture, but testable by the canon and correctable by it, if they seem to contradict the scriptures. Contrast with sola scriptura Prima scriptura is sometimes contrasted to sola scriptura, which literally translates \\"by the scripture alone\\". The former doctrine as understood by many Protestants—particularly Evangelicals—is that the Scriptures are the sole infallible rule of faith and practice, but that the Scriptures' meaning can be mediated through many kinds of secondary authority, such as the ordinary teaching offices of the Church, antiquity, the councils of the Christian Church, reason, and experience. However, sola scriptura rejects any original infallible authority other than the Bible. In this view, all secondary authority is derived from the authority of the Scriptures and is therefore subject to reform when compared to the teaching of the Bible. Church councils, preachers, Bible commentators, private revelation, or even a message allegedly from an angel or an apostle are not an original authority alongside the Bible in the sola scriptura approach. Catholicism The Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation is clear on the total equality of Scripture with Sacred Tradition when it says that \\"both Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture are to be accepted and venerated with the same sense of loyalty and reverence\\" because together they \\"form one sacred deposit of the word of God, committed to the Church.\\"Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation - Dei verbum So, in one sense, Scripture has no primacy over Tradition, but an ancient tradition holds that the word of God, though equally authoritative in whichever form it comes, comes primarily in the form of Sacred Scripture, and thus we should seek for Sacred Doctrine primarily in the Scriptures. As Thomas Aquinas said: > ...[S]acred doctrine...properly uses the authority of the canonical > Scriptures as an incontrovertible proof, and the authority of the doctors of > the Church as one that may properly be used, yet merely as probable. For our > faith rests upon the revelation made to the apostles and prophets who wrote > the canonical books, and not on the revelations (if any such there are) made > to other doctors.Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica, 1:1:8. For this reason, some sources say that prima scriptura is the normative Catholic approach. Yves Congar referred to prima scriptura as the \\"normative primacy of Scripture\\" as he described the work of Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas. Pope John Paul II in an address to academics in 1986 said, \\"Theology must take its point of departure from a continual and updated return to the Scriptures read in the Church.\\" This statement has been taken by some as support for interpreting the Church's teaching in terms of the prima scriptura perspective. In his book, James F. Keenan reports studies by some academics. A study by Bernard Hoose states that claims to a continuous teaching by the Church on matters of sexuality, life and death and crime and punishment are \\"simply not true\\". After examining seven medieval texts about homosexuality, Mark Jordan argues that, \\"far from being consistent, any attempt to make a connection among the texts proved impossible\\". He calls the tradition's teaching of the Church \\"incoherent\\". Karl-Wilhelm Merks considers that tradition itself is \\"not the truth guarantor of any particular teaching.\\" Keenan, however, says that studies of \\"manualists\\" such as John T. Noonan Jr. has demonstrated that, \\"despite claims to the contrary, manualists were co- operators in the necessary historical development of the moral tradition.\\" Noonan, according to Keenan, has provided a new way of viewing at \\"areas where the Church not only changed, but shamefully did not\\". Eastern Orthodoxy Eastern Orthodoxy teaches that Scripture is neither above nor below Tradition, and that Scripture is part of the written Tradition of the Church. An analogy is made where the entirety of church life is compared to a jeweled necklace, of which the most precious gem is the large diamond in the center, representing scripture. The other gems represent other parts of the Holy Tradition. While none of the other jewels are equal to the diamond, they nonetheless contribute to its beauty; the diamond looks best as part of the whole necklace (i. e., when viewed within the context of Church tradition). Sola scriptura, which is analogous to ripping the diamond out of the necklace because one prefers to view it on its own, only detracts from the diamond's beauty and value. Anglicanism Article VI of the 39 Articles, Of the Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for Salvation states: The Anglican view of the role on sola scriptura can be best summarized by Richard Hooker. In his famous work \\"On the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity\\" he developed a view that would be known in the Anglican tradition as the \\"3-legged stool\\". This consists of scripture, tradition and reason. Scripture is the source of all revelation in the Christian tradition. At the same time Hooker also saw the necessity of tradition, while not on the same level as scripture, as being an important mediating principle in interpreting. He specifically critiques the Puritan interpretations of sola scriptura that were present at the time in Elizabethan England. This is followed by what Hooker calls the \\"law of reason\\". Hookers' 3-legged stool would become the basis of the Methodist quadrilateral as well as form a via media between the Catholic and Lutheran understandings on the relationship between scripture and tradition. Wesleyan Methodism Another version of the prima scriptura approach may be the Wesleyan Quadrilateral for the Methodists, which maintains that Scripture is to be the primary authority for the Church. Nonetheless, it is best interpreted through the lenses of reason, personal experience, and Church tradition, although the Bible remains the crucial and normative authority for Christians. According to the United Methodist Church, which adheres to this notion: Others The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) accepts the Bible as the word of God \\"as far as it is translated correctly,\\" See (\\"We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.\\") Joseph Smith wrote, \\"I believe the Bible as it read when it came from the pen of the original writers\\" (Teachings of The Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 327). and it regards parts of the Apocrypha,See . some writings of the Protestant Reformers and non-Christian religious leaders, and the non-religious writings of some philosophers - and, notably, the Constitution of the United States of America \\\\- to be inspired, though not canonical. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the interpretation of scripture and codification of doctrines is considered the responsibility of the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses. The Quaker concept of the Inner light or the charismatic views of the Holy Spirit as an active force in the life of the believer may be examples of the prima scriptura approach. While most Pentecostals and Charismatics believe the Bible to be the ultimate authority and would not say that any new revelation can ever contradict the Bible, they do believe that God continues to speak to people today on extra-biblical topics as well as to interpret and apply the text of the Bible. Besides the Holy Scriptures, the Seventh-day Adventist Church hold Ellen White's writings to be \\"a continuing and authoritative source of truth which provide for the church.\\" Christadelphians believe that the Bible is the sole source of instruction from God in terms of the way that they should conduct their affairs. However they do note that some translations of the bible into non- original languages have changed the message, so study of the original texts are important.

Thomas Wright Hill (24 April 1763 in Kidderminster - 13 June 1851 in Tottenham) was a mathematician and schoolmaster. He is credited as inventing the single transferable vote in 1819. His son, Rowland Hill, famous as the originator of the modern postal system, introduced STV in 1840 into the world's first public election, for the Adelaide City Council, in which the principle of proportional representation was applied. In 1791, Thomas Wright Hill courageously tried to save the apparatus of Dr Joseph Priestley from a mob in the Birmingham 'Church and King' riots of 1791—the offer was declined. He was interested in astronomy, being a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, and in computers, as is shown by a letter of his to Charles Babbage, dated 23 March 1836, among the Babbage manuscripts at the British Library, returning some logarithm tables that he had borrowed and adding \\"How happy I shall be when I can see such a work verified and enlarged by your divine machine\\".  Hill and education  He started work as a brassfounder, but was more interested in intellectual pursuits, so in 1802 he bought a boys' school on Lionel Street, Birmingham moving it to Hill Top, Gough Street. In 1819, it moved again to a new purpose- built school designed by Rowland at Hazelbrook called Hazelwood on Hagley Road in Edgbaston.Colin G. Hey, Rowland Hill: Victorian genius and benefactor, Quiller Press, 1989. From the start the school seems to have been out of the ordinary. In its original prospectus Hill says that \\"he will make it his study to excite [his pupils'] reasoning powers, and to induce in them habits of voluntary application ... he will always endeavour, by kindness and patience, to secure for himself their affection and esteem\\"; perhaps not revolutionary aims nowadays, but this was more than 25 years before Thomas Arnold became headmaster of Rugby or Charles Dickens wrote Nicholas Nickleby. It is also noteworthy that he was offering \\"instruction in art and science\\". How many schools at that date would have thought of including science in their curriculum? At Hazelwood School, with his sons now bearing a full share in its running, it became a school in which the rules were formed by a committee of the boys, elected by the boys, and enforced by the boys' own law court. Whether or not that is a good way to run a school, the amazing thing is that it existed at all at that time. In 1827 a London branch of the school was opened at Bruce Castle, Tottenham, and within a few years all the Hazelwood students had transferred to Bruce Castle, which had been taken over almost entirely by his sons. Hazelwood then became the home of Francis Clark and his wife Caroline (daughter of Thomas Wright Hill) and their large and growing family. They remained there for fifteen years before emigrating to South Australia.Brown, Robert and Martin/Clark Committee The Hatbox Letters Published by the authors, Adelaide 1999.  Political views and activities  Thomas Hill and his sons had strong political views which, at that time, were certainly radical, but always with the conviction that reforms had to come by persuasion, and constitutionally, not by violence. During the agitation leading up to the Great Reform Act of 1832, the fifth son Frederic Hill was freed from duties at the school to devote his time to an active part in the struggle as part of the Birmingham Union. A letter to his son Edwin, dated 15 May 1832, says \\"These my dear boy are stirring times ... the enthusiasm and unanimity of the mass who form the Birmingham Union is at once delightful and astonishing. I hope that it will be kept quite within the law. Let the honour of a vigour surmounting that boundary belong to our adversaries; they will not find such forbearance as they may have met with in days past\\". As his contribution to the cause \\"I am abstaining from tea, coffee, sugar etc., as taxed articles. Would that the massive unions would concur. The revenue then would soon require parliamentary help, and funds would be reserved for useful purposes. But this kind of passive procedure is too much to hope for as a general procedure\\". He does not seem to have disapproved of a little political trickery, provided the right side was doing it. Writing to his wife, dated 11 May 1831, about the \\"patriotic fellows of Haddington\\" including her brother, he says \\"Their district has five boroughs which choose a member of parliament by one [delegate] from each borough. Haddington was firm and Jedburgh was firm in the good cause. Dunbar was Rotten and the same was North Berwick. Lauder had seven good men in the council out of sixteen. By excellent management the men of Haddington brought away two councilmen from Lauder and entertained them until the business was accomplished, so that now three delegates out of the five are sound reformers ... It is a glorious victory and a proud thing for us to have so near a relative bearing such a part in it\\". In spite of radical views, he evidently thought well of King George III, for in a letter dated 9 February 1820, just after George IV's accession, he wrote to his son Matthew \\"How did your taste accord with bell-ringing and huzzas at the King's proclamation? To me, connected as it was with the death of our late aged and virtuous monarch it was revolting, even to hear of; I saw nothing of the pageantry\\".  Hill and the single transferable vote  In 1819, Thomas and Rowland were instrumental in founding the Society for Literary and Scientific Improvement of Birmingham. The Society's bylaws include a description of Hill's method of proportional representation, the earliest known versionNicolaus Tideman, Collective Decisions and Voting: The Potential for Public Choice, Ashgate Publishing Company, Burlington VT, 2006. of the single transferable vote: :X. At the first meeting in April, and also in October, a Committee shall be elected, which shall consist of at least one fifth of the members of the society. The mode of election shall be as follows. A ticket shall be delivered to each member present, with his own name at the head of it, immediately under which he shall write the name of the member whom he may wish to represent him in the Committee. The votes thus given shall be delivered to the president, who, after having assorted them, shall report to the meeting the number of votes given for each nominee. Every one who has five votes shall be declared a member of the committee; if there are more than five votes given to any one person, the surplus votes, (to be selected by lot) shall be returned to the electors whose names they bear, for the purpose of making other nominations, and this process shall be repeated till no surplus votes remain, when all the inefficient votes shall be returned to the respective electors, and the same routine shall be gone through a second time, and also a third time if necessary; when if a number is elected, equal in all to one half of the number of which the committee should consist, they shall be a committee; and if at the close of the meeting the number is not filled up, by unanimous votes of five for each member of the committee, given by those persons whose votes were returned to them at the end of the third election, then this committee shall have the power, and shall be required, to choose persons to fill up their number; and the constituents of each member so elected shall, if necessary, be determined by lot. …Laws of the Society for Literary and Scientific Improvement; established in Birmingham, 19 October 1819. According to Hill's great-great-great grandson David Hill (also a reform activist) the first STV election actually took place on 18 December 1819 one month after the establishment of the society.Conversations with members of the Electoral reform Society 2015 Hill's grandson (and Rowland's nephew) George Birkbeck Norman Hill wrote, \\"The plan of election had been devised by his [Rowland's] father who … was strongly in favour of the representation of minorities.\\"George Birkbeck Hill, Life of Sir Rowland Hill and History of Penny Postage, Thos. de la Rue & Co., 110, Bunhill Row, London, 1880. In 1821, Hill used an informal version of proportional representation in his school. :…[Hill's] pupils were asked to elect a committee by standing beside the boy they liked best. This first produced a number of unequal groups, but soon the boys in the largest groups came to the conclusion that not all of them were actually necessary for the election of their favourite and some moved on to help another candidate, while on the other hand the few supporters of an unpopular boy gave him up as hopeless and transferred themselves to the candidate they considered the next best. The final result was that a number of candidates equal to the number required for the committee were each surrounded by the same number of supporters, with only two or three boys left over who were dissatisfied with all those elected. This is an admirable example of the use of STV.Enid Lakeman, How Democracies Vote: A Study of Majority and Proportional Electoral Systems, Faber and Faber, 3ed, 1970. Although this seems likely to be true, when Enid Lakeman was asked for the source of it she could not remember it. It would be wise to regard it with caution until an original reference can be found.

When Procter & Gamble, the company that produces As the World Turns, hired Sheffer, it came as a surprise to both industry figures and viewers. Some fans became concerned when, in an interview, he admitted he had never seen As the World Turns or sister soap Guiding Light before he was asked to watch them. P&G; gave Sheffer a choice of which show he'd like to write for, and although he commented that ATWT had been \\"boring as hell\\", he saw potential in the show. Praise Sheffer's take on As the World Turns, an aging show in one of the oldest genres in television, was seen by some as reinvigorating the program. During Sheffer's writing regime, the show won many Daytime Emmy Awards; Sheffer and his team received four Emmys for Outstanding Drama Series Writing Team in 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2005. ATWT 's loss in 2003 was blamed on technical difficulties with their Emmy reel, as the clips judges watched had either bad or no sound and were tinted green. Also, Sheffer became a favorite of reporters for his comical one-liners. Criticism Sheffer's writing style alienated a number of longtime fans of ATWT, who complained that he rewrote characters to suit the purposes of a given storyline. In particular, he and his team were criticized for departing from history and/or established character motivation and behavior. While some storylines for veteran characters worked well (turning Barbara Ryan into a villainess), others seemed inappropriate for the character, like Margo's flirtation with misogynistic football player Doc. Throughout its run, As the World Turns had perhaps the largest group of veterans still active in the cast; during the Sheffer's tenure, a dozen actors were on contract to the show (or were recurring in their roles) who had been with the show for 20 or more years. Some of the veteran actors on the show (most vocally Eileen Fulton who played longtime heroine Lisa Grimaldi) also complained that their characters' airtime diminished dramatically during Sheffer's tenure. Departure from ATWT In March 2005, Sheffer took what was referred to a \\"17-week sabbatical\\" from ATWT, at which time other writers like Leah Laiman, Christopher Whitesell, and Jean Passanante took over. P&G; initially indicated that he would return at the end of his sabbatical, but announced a few weeks later that Sheffer would not be returning to his position as Head Writer; the company promoted Jean Passanante to the position permanently. Reasons for his leave and subsequent firing were unclear. There were suggestions that Sheffer was ill; there were also suggestions that he had taken a leave to undergo gastric bypass surgery. However, no statements confirming the reason for his leave were made. Before being placed on a 17-week sabbatical, Sheffer was unhappy at ATWT, as a planned two-year storyline was cut short by higher-ups. When he won his fourth Daytime Emmy for ATWT in 2005, he did not attend the ceremony. Jean Passanante accepted the award. Passanante thanked Sheffer for \\"his big heart and brilliant imagination\\" and said the entire writing staff at the show would \\"miss him\\". In 2002, when Richard Culliton was fired from the ABC Daytime soap opera All My Children, it was speculated that Sheffer would leave ATWT to take over that soap. After Sheffer was fired in 2005, speculation again circulated that Sheffer would head to One Life to Live to join Dena Higley as head writer, or to help out the low-rated Guiding Light as an Executive Consultant. ATWT fans were shocked when in the summer of 2005, Sheffer was asked to return as head writer. He declined, but agreed to take a lesser position on the writing staff, much like Leah Laiman did in early 2005 when she returned to writing for the show. In October 2005, Sheffer returned to ATWT as a breakdown writer. Sheffer stated that his favorite serials on ABC Daytime and CBS Daytime are General Hospital and As the World Turns. Days of Our Lives On June 12, 2006, Sheffer confirmed he was joining Days of Our Lives as the new Head Writer with Meg Kelly Sheffer's stories began airing in October 2006. Sheffer's last episode aired January 24, 2008. Sheffer appeared with DAYS star Mary Beth Evans on the SOAPnet show I Wanna Be a Soap Star in 2007.Soap Opera Digest Insider, September 6, 2007 The Young and the Restless On May 21, 2008, it was announced that Sheffer had joined The Young and the Restless as co-Head Writer. He worked closely with Maria Arena Bell and Scott Hamner. His episodes began airing July 15, 2008 In late July 2012 due to the firings of Maria Arena Bell and Scott Hamner, it was announced that Sheffer's contract was up as of that November, and it wouldn't be extended. He remained credited as co-head writer on air shows until February 1, 2013.

The 28th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 28, 1998. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. It was the season's Halloween special, featuring the \\"spooky\\" theme of having pictures of Barbra Streisand in the screen corners, accompanied with the words \\"Spooky Vision\\" (in response to Streisand's negative reception to the season one episode \\"Mecha-Streisand\\"). In the episode, Aunt Flo comes to stay, but her goldfish she bought for Stan Marsh turns out to be evil. Also \\"Cartman\\" grows a beard and starts acting strangely nice and agreeable. Plot Cartman has skipped class, but shows up at the bus stop to meet the boys when they get off the bus, wearing a goatee and acting strangely agreeable. Cartman explains that he missed school that day because he was taking care of the house for his mother, who has the flu. The boys are shocked and confused at this news coming from the normally obnoxious and uncaring Cartman. Later, Stan arrives home, where his mother, Sharon Marsh, tells him that his Aunt Flo has come to visit. Aunt Flo gives Stan's sister Shelly a huge stereo system and gives Stan a goldfish in a bowl. Stan doesn't like the fish and finds it spooky because of the way it stares at him, but Sharon insists that he put it in his room. The next morning at the bus stop, Stan and Kyle expect to meet the new version of Cartman. However, Cartman arrives in his normal obnoxious mood. That night, it is stormy, and the nice version of Cartman appears at Kenny's house to deliver some provisions for the storm. Stan is in bed, trying to sleep despite being repeatedly terrorized by the fish. Despite what Stan says, Sharon remains unconvinced that there is any trouble until Stan finds a dead body on the floor. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny discover that the two personalities of Cartman are in fact two separate people. Chef tells the boys that the kinder version of Cartman is from a parallel universe and that Stan's fish must be from the same world. Stan, Kyle, and the kind Cartman track down the Ancient Indian Burial Ground Pet Store, where they find the portal to the alternate universe. After returning the fish to the owner, the boys leave, just as Stan and Kyle from the evil world arrive to retrieve their Cartman. They align with the regular Cartman, and the trio find the regular Stan and Kyle along with Evil Cartman. The evil Stan and Kyle have a gun that sends things back to the alternate world, which is used on them by regular Stan. Stan and Kyle attempt to send their Cartman to the parallel universe, so they can retain the friendly Cartman, but the regular Cartman tricks them by saying something he wouldn't normally say. Broadcast Before the episode was broadcast, Comedy Central promoted that the \\"South Park Halloween Special\\" would be broadcast in \\"Spooky Vision\\".Mailing list post. Subject: \\"Spooky Vision?\\". User \\"'susie chipper'\\". In: Upon airing, \\"Spooky Vision\\" turned out to simply mean that singer Barbra Streisand's face was in each corner of the screen, with the words \\"Spooky Vision\\" written on the sides of the screen. In subsequent broadcasts of the episode, Comedy Central does not always use \\"Spooky Vision\\", (Forum post.) although on occasion they still present the episode in its original format. Moreover, in the home video releases, the HD remaster version, on Netflix instant stream, and on the official South Park website, the episode retains the visuals of \\"Spooky Vision\\".\\"Spookyfish\\". In: Reception Travis Fickett of IGN gave the episode a score of 9 out of 10, praising the \\"great shot in the episode where the two Cartmans meet, and [how] it looks like a badly pulled off split screen effect – an effect they stick with throughout the episode. It's little jokes like this, and attention to detail that set South Park apart in the early days.\\" He pointed out how fun it was for him \\"to watch Sharon lose her mind as she believes the bodies she's burying are Stanley's victims. 'Such a handsome boy' she mutters to herself as she hauls a bloodied corpse out the door.\\" He concluded by commenting on the \\"classic 'Who is the good one?' scene when The Cartmans face off\\", calling it \\"fun, funny, and clever and an early example of South Park greatness.\\" Phil Dyess-Nugent for The A.V. Club found the highlight of the episode to be Cartman's scenes, particularly those referencing Star Trek: The Original Series. He also enjoyed a joke involving Aunt Flo's Parkinson's disease, calling it \\"one of the random, sickest jokes that has ever knocked [him] off the couch\\". He disliked the \\"Spooky Vision\\" concept, however, comparing it to his dislike of \\"Mecha-Streisand\\", an episode from season one which also depicted Barbra Streisand.Dyess-Nugent, Phil (September 16, 2012). \\"South Park (Classic): \\"Spookyfish\\"/\\"Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson!\\"\\".

Situated on the southern slope of the Central Caucasus, the district is a site of alpinism. Lentekhi ethnographically belongs to a historic Georgian province of Lower, or Kvemo Svaneti. Cultural heritage of the area includes several monuments, particularly St George's Church of Jgëræg (the 10th century), the Archangel Church of Thargizel (the 9–10th centuries), Tekal Church (the 10–11th centuries), Lentekhi Castle of the Dadiani, and the famous Svanetian towers in the village Leksuri. left There is a river that goes through the town and its inhabitants survive largely off of farming and lumber, though in recent years government restrictions have slowed this latter industry. Like in much of Georgia, tourism is seen as the future source of income as the weather in lower Svaneti is not as severe and Lentekhi is one of the larger towns before arriving in Mestia. Nevertheless, as in much of Svaneti, there has been a tendency for the younger generation to migrate to the larger cities or to find work overseas for economic reasons. Every spring, there is a festival at the church high in the mountain above the town. There is a singing hall and one restaurant next to the river which serves traditional food of the region to travelers and sometimes locals. A spring flows from the mountainside with fresh mineral water of which the town consistently drinks. In 2019, Lentekhi removed a figure of the goddess Dali from the design of a fountain planned for the city's main square. Metropolitan Stephan of the Georgian Orthodox eparchy of Tsageri and Lentekhi had strongly criticized the inclusion of the goddess as idolatry, although mayor Badri Liparteliani stated the change was intended to increase the fountain's efficiency and visual appeal. The final version was built without the statue of Dali.

John Hebden. An engraving from a portrait by Philippe Mercier, c. 1740-01. Little is known of Hebden's life. He was baptized on 21 July 1712 at Spofforth, near Harrogate in Yorkshire, the son of 'John Hebdin' of Plompton. He was orphaned when young but was fortunate enough to receive an excellent education, including musical tuition. He lived most of his life in York. In 1732, he married Mary Prestland. Their first son, John, born in 1733, survived only a short time. A second son was baptized in 1736, but Mary died shortly afterwards, in 1737. Hebden was left with the responsibility of bringing up his small son and working long hours earning enough to live. When Hebden was dying, he arranged for money to be left in trust for his son, to be released in only small amounts. Around 1742, Hebden moved to London, and when composer Thomas Arne enlarged the orchestra at Vauxhall Gardens in 1745, he became the principal cellist and bassoonist. It is also known that he played in a performance of Messiah directed by George Frideric Handel himself, to raise money for the Foundling Hospital. Hebden was principally an orchestral player and as such his social status and his income would have been low. He might, had he chosen, have supplemented his income considerably by composing popular songs, as did a number of his fellow musicians. Hebden was a professional bassoonist, gamba (viol) player and cellist and, in the 1730s, composed music for a small local professional orchestra containing \\"all the best Hands in Town.\\" They gave many concerts at the York Assembly Rooms, which were designed by Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington who was a patron to Handel. It appears that Hebden had greater aspirations for his talent and channeled his creativity in a highly disciplined manner into more serious works. Only two were published: Six Solos for German Flute and the Six Concertos for Strings. The latter were probably begun around 1745 and published in about 1749 in an edition of approximately 500. Subscribers included the Earl and Countess of Burlington as well as other aristocracy; a number of academics and organists; taverns such as The Devil and The Globe in Fleet Street where concerts were held; the actor David Garrick (who produced many of Shakespeare's plays at Drury Lane) and some of the other Vauxhall musicians, including Valentine Snow for whom Handel wrote his famous trumpet solos; several composers including Arne and William Boyce (who both worked for Garrick at Drury Lane, composing music for many of his productions), Giovanni Battista Sammartini and Geminiani. Of this edition, only six copies have survived: two in London, one in Brussels and three in the United States. An incomplete set also survives in a private collection at Durham. These six concertos were discovered only fairly recently. In 1980, Ruzena Wood, then repertoire consultant for the group Cantilena, had become interested in Hebden after studying his First Sonata for Flute and Keyboard. She began searching to find if he had written any music for strings. Finally, she discovered in the library of the British Museum, the six forgotten concertos which had lain unplayed for 200 years. Hebden's Concertos are in the baroque style, and in them he adheres to the 18th century convention of writing happy music in sharp keys and sad music in flat keys. They are most influenced by the Italian composer and violinist, Geminiani, a follower of Arcangelo Corelli, who came to England in 1714 and from whom Thomas Arne may have had violin lessons. The concertos are in seven parts, written for four violins, viola, 'cello and harpsichord. Two (No. 2 in C major and No. 3 in C minor) have three movements (allegro-largo-allegro) and the others are in four movements (an opening adagio followed by alternating fast and slow movements). The fast movements are characterized by lively dance rhythms: while these are Italian in texture, they distinctly echo the English country dances with which Hebden would have been familiar with from his days in Yorkshire.https://www.chandos.net/chanimages/Booklets/CH8339.pdf His only surviving works are the 6 concertos for strings (Op. 2): *No. 1 in A Major *No. 2 in C Major *No. 3 in E minor *No. 4 in E Flat *No. 5 in C minor *No. 6 in D minor and his 6 solos for flute and harpsichord.

Covering an area of , it takes up parts of the counties of East Sussex, Kent, West Sussex and Surrey in order of respective contribution. It is the fourth largest Area of Outstanding Beauty (AONB) in England and Wales. It has an attractive landscape with a mosaic of small farms and woodlands, historic parks, sunken lanes and ridge-top villages. Designation and administration The High Weald AONB was designated under the National Park and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 in October 1983. Designation as an AONB gave official recognition to the unique landscape of the High Weald, strengthened the ability of government agencies and local authorities to conserve and enhance the landscape, and provided priority for financial support for these objectives from the principal government agency responsible for AONBs, the Countryside Agency (now Natural England). AONBs do not possess separate administrative structures like Britain's National Parks, but rely on existing structures. In the case of the High Weald, this requires co-ordination of the policies and management activities of fifteen local authorities, comprising four counties (Surrey, West Sussex, East Sussex and Kent) and eleven district authorities. Geology The High Weald lies at the core of the distinctive Weald anticline. At its margins are the relatively flat clay vales of the Low Weald, the Greensand Ridge, the North Downs and South Downs. At the centre, the sandstones and clays formed geologically of the Hastings Beds of the early Cretaceous period rise up to give the characteristic forested ridges of the High Weald. This geology and the subsequent dissection of the sandstone core by rivers such as the Ouse, Medway and Rother are fundamental to its underlying landscape character. The headwaters of these rivers have cut deep, steep-sided valleys (ghylls) which are wet and clayey. On this underlying geological structure centuries if not millennia of human activity have created the landscape that is visible today. Landscape The entire Weald was once heavily wooded and, even though the vast woodland that lay between the North Downs and South Downs, which was known to the Celtic Britons as Coit Andred, to the Romans as Silva Anderida, and to the Saxons first as Andredesleage and later Andredesweald, has been much reduced and fragmented as the result of human activity over the last 1,500 years, woodland remains at a much higher density in the High Weald than elsewhere. At the time of the Domesday Book, 1086, the High Weald was the most wooded natural area in England. Today, 24.6% of the AONB is woodland, compared with a national average of about 9%. Of this, 17.6% is ancient woodland; in other words, over half the area's woodlands are ancient. The area of the High Weald AONB represents only 1% of England yet it has 3.4% of England's woodlands, making it one of the most densely wooded landscapes. All this gives the High Weald a wooded appearance when viewed from a distance from a hilltop, but on closer inspection a close patchwork of small fields, hedges and woods connected by sunken lanes created by centuries of transportation which patterns the rolling wooded ridges and valleys becomes apparent. The unique Wealden landscape of small fields and scattered farmsteads was created by pioneer farmers of the late medieval period. The early settlements in this period were formed on the better warm soils, the drier ridge tops and the river valleys, the latter two being the main lines of communication. The wooded relief and comparative inaccessibility historically provided the High Weald with a sense of enclosure and remoteness that can still be appreciated today, and which contrasts with the more open nature of the surrounding Low Weald and starkly with the generally populous and urbanised nature of south-east England as a whole. The highest sandstone hills of the High Weald are referred to as the Weald Forest Ridge. This ridge includes a number of ancient heathland forests, notably Ashdown Forest, St Leonards Forest, Worth Forest and Dallington Forest. Ancient woodland covers 22% of the Weald Forest Ridge (total woodland cover is 40%), which represents a significant proportion of the resource in the UK. Population and settlements With an estimated population of around 124,880 and a density of 0.85 people per hectare, the High Weald AONB is an essentially rural area characterised by a landscape of scattered villages and dispersed settlement. Two major towns, Tunbridge Wells and Crowborough, lie within the AONB but are excluded from it. Battle and Cranbrook, each with more than 6,000 inhabitants, are the largest settlements actually in the AONB. The High Weald AONB is closely bordered by several major population centres, notably Crawley, Horsham, East Grinstead, Tonbridge, Hastings, Uckfield and Haywards Heath. These major towns, taken together with Tunbridge Wells, Crowborough and Battle, account for almost 400,000 people. These people and their housing demands have led to central government policy decisions to review the status of land in the AONB but supply many of the regular users of the biodiverse open spaces in the hinterland of London. Economy Farming was a marginal activity and production typically mirrored local demand; woodland however was measured in terms of how many hogs it would support in the Domesday survey, the raising of which in woodland mainly ceased by the 20th century. Powerful mills, major roads and canals were also few. These factors, combined with the area's relative inaccessibility, made it one of the least prosperous areas of southern England. However, the rapid growth of the iron industry from about 1490, together with the development of crafts such as weaving and tanning, made it, for a time, one of the wealthiest districts of England. By the 18th and 19th centuries these activities had moved to more favourable areas, leaving farming as the mainstay of the rural economy, though the majority of farms were and remain small and seldom very profitable. Today, agriculture, mainly livestock farming, remains the main AONB land use, but in 2007 it only accounted for 67.5% of the total area, an increase of 6% from 2000; by 2010 agriculture may account for less than half the area. Employment in the traditional rural industries of the High Weald, agriculture, forestry and mineral working (gypsum, notably, is mined from the Purbeck Beds near Battle), declined rapidly during the late 20th century to a point where less than 10% of employees are now engaged in these activities. In the case of agriculture, only around 4,500 people are now employed out of a total estimated population of 124,880. Despite this, agriculture remains an important employer, along with tourism and leisure. There are few large firms in the private sector, and most firms are very small. Significant wealth has been brought into the High Weald over the centuries by those from outside wishing to live there. The trend for prosperous urban dwellers to move to the countryside is apparent as early as the 14th century. Kent was the most popular destination due in part to its accessibility to London and its particular form of land tenure which enabled land to be freely negotiable. The process of migration accelerated in the 19th century with the advent of the railways, which made access from London much easier. The resources brought into the area by wealthy incomers created and maintained the many parks and gardens that are now characteristic of the High Weald landscape. Today the High Weald is still economically dependent, not so much on wealthy landowners but on large numbers of commuters living there who travel outside the area to work, mainly to the Crawley/Gatwick conurbation, the coastal towns and London. Today 70% of residents commute to work outside the area while less than 7% make their living directly from the land. Recreation Several long distance paths cross the AONB: High Weald Landscape Trail, Wealdway, 1066 Country Walk, Saxon Shore Way, Vanguard Way and Sussex Border Path. The total length of footpaths is 2063 kilometres. Bewl Water, one of five reservoirs in the AONB, is the largest body of inland water in south-east England and one of the area's most important tourist and recreational destinations. Bedgebury Forest, a large area of ancient woodland and heath covering some , has facilities for mountain biking, horse-riding and other recreational activities, while Bedgebury National Pinetum, which the forest surrounds, is said to be the most complete collection of conifers on one site anywhere in the world, and a major tourist attraction. Ashdown Forest is an internationally important area of lowland heathland occupying the highest sandstone ridge-top of the High Weald. It was also the setting for the Winnie-the-Pooh stories of AA Milne. Accounting for two-thirds (65.5%) of the AONB's heathland, it receives special protection as a UK Site of Special Scientific Interest, as a European Union Special Protection Area for birds and European Union Special Area of Conservation for its heathland habitats, and by its membership of Natura 2000, which brings together Europe's most important and threatened wildlife areas. Ashdown Forest's commons are open to the public.

The period is also referred to as den stora ofreden (\\"the great discord\\") in Swedish or isoviha (\\"the great hatred\\") in Finnish. It was previously also called venäläisen ylivallan aika (\\"era of Russian domination\\" or \\"era of Russian supremacy\\") in Finnish. Background Finland was left largely to fend for itself after the disaster of Poltava in 1709. Russia captured Viborg ( (Vyborg), ) in 1710 and already in 1712 started their first campaign to capture Finland which ended in failure. A more organized campaign starting in 1713 managed to capture Helsinki/Helsingfors and drive defending Swedes away from the coast. The Swedish army in Finland was defeated in Storkyro (Isokyrö) in February 1714 where the Russians won a decisive victory. Swedish efforts to hinder the Russian advance by blockading the coastal sea route at Hangö ended in failure in late July in battle of Gangut. The presence of a Russian galley fleet in the Gulf of Bothnia forced, in the end, both the Swedish fleet and army to largely abandon Finland in late 1714. Even the Swedish areas on the western side of the Gulf of Bothnia were ravaged by the Russians. The city of Umeå was burned to the ground by the Russians on 18 September 1714, and after struggling to rebuild was razed again in 1719, 1720, and 1721. Russian occupation of Finland After the victory in Battle of Storkyro, Mikhail Golitsyn was appointed the governor of Finland. Finns began waging partisan warfare against the Russians. As retaliation, the Finnish peasants were forced to pay large contributions to the occupying Russians (as was the custom in that time). Plundering and raping was widespread, especially in Ostrobothnia and in communities near the major roads. Churches were looted, Isokyrö was burned to the ground. A scorched earth zone several hundred kilometers wide was burned to hinder Swedish counteroffensives. At least 5,000 Finns were killed and some 10,000 taken away as slaves, of whom only a few thousand would ever return;Suomen historian pikkujättiläinen. . Page 265. According to newer research, the amount of those killed is closer to 20,000.\\"Helsingin Sanomat Kuukausiliite 7/2009, s. 28–33 Newer research also estimates the number of slaved children and women to be closer to 30,000.\\"Uusi Suomi 23.10.2015 \\"Historioitsija: Synkkyyden Suomi kärsi orjuudesta jopa enemmän kuin mikään Afrikan maa\\" Thousands, especially officials, also fled to the (relative) safety of Sweden. The poorer peasants hid in the woods to avoid the ravages of the occupiers and their press-gangs.Uppslagsverket Finland, 1985 Atrocities were at their worst between 1714–17 when the Swedish Count Gustaf Otto Douglas, who had defected to the Russian side during the war, was in charge of the occupation. In addition to the predations of the Russian occupants, Finland was struck - as were most other Baltic countries at the time - by the plague. In Helsinki, 1,185 people died: nearly two-thirds of the population. Plague already had struck Finland before the Russian invasion, sapping the strength of Sweden in Finland. Consequences It took several decades for the Finnish population and economy to recover after the peace in 1721, at which point Finland was scourged again during the war of 1741–43, although less devastatingly.

Also in these specialties are signed cooperation agreements with the Mexican Petroleum Institute (IMP) and the International Cooperation Agency of Japan (JICA). In 1993 he began the career of Engineering Geoscience, settling of Engineering Geology and Geophysics. That same year, 1993, offer the Master of Science in Engineering Management. In 1995 the Bachelor in Computer Science started. In 1996 the Master of Science in Chemical Engineering began as a response to changing national trends with respect to oil development. This change also resulted from the recommendations of the Evaluation Committee of the National Register of Graduate CONACYT. That same year, the PhD in Chemical Engineering Petrochemical replacing. In August 2000 began the Master of Science in Computer Science and six years later was registered in the National Register of CONACYT Graduate with a Master of Science in Chemical Engineering which places them among the best graduate programs in these disciplines. In 2001 starts the Masters in Administrative Management (replacing the Master of Science in Engineering Management). By 2006 the program starts the race of Environmental Engineering and in 2008 another Graduate with a Masters in Electrical Engineering to replace the Master of Science in Electrical Engineering. And as a result of an investigation of educational provision in our suburbs, authorized the deployment of the most recent race at the institution in August 2010 that starts the Engineering Program in Business Management All this historical record has forged a solid institution, prestige, based on the needs of organizations and the result is that the Technological Institute of Ciudad Madero and is considered one of the leading research centers in the country.

Released in 1981, it received some airplay on went to the top of the Canadian University radio charts (specifically with songs \\"Conventional Beliefs\\" and \\"Red Light\\"), but it was their next album, Arias & Symphonies – and its best known single, \\"Nova Heart\\" – that were to launch them to fame. This album was recorded by Daniel Lanois at the Grant Avenue Studios in Hamilton, Ontario. Its liner notes collectively thank fellow contemporary Toronto bands The Diodes, Martha and the Muffins, and concert promoter Gary Cormier of \\"The Garys\\". As Gordon Deppe mentions in his liner notes for Collectible Spoons, this collection of songs \\"is a bit rough around the edges, but there are things on it that [are] still very interesting and perplexing.\\"  Background  Stick Figure Neighbourhood was partly inspired by the band's interest in progressive rock, where an emphasis is placed on creating atmospheres as opposed to rhythms. Another inspiration was the show The Prisoner, where songs such as \\"Dropped Dishes\\" and \\"Capitol Hill\\" reflect situations the show's protagonist No.6 would go through. \\"After the Institution\\" (b/w \\"My Job\\") from 1980 was an early song from the group that was left off the album due to the feeling that it was \\"too new wave\\". Regardless of the decision, the album still manages to be full of synthesizers, \\"raunchy\\" guitars, and pounding drums, all while being held together by Horne's bass. The track \\"Ice Age\\" was originally called \\"Elephant's Graveyard\\" but was changed due to the Boomtown Rats' song of the same name. Deppe states that the imagery of \\"glaciers moving along\\" are present in both songs. He goes on to explain that – after reading the story on the back cover of Genesis Live – he got the inspiration for \\"Stick Figure Neighbourhood\\". The image on the album cover reflects this idea, along with the notion of a typical suburb.  Reception  Despite the album's lack of singles and placement on any mainstream chart, Stick Figure Neighbourhood was well-received by the media. Journalists wrote how the album was \\"one of the most imaginative debut discs to appear in a long time\\" and that the band had achieved \\"an exhilarating blend of textural...melodies, brittle bass lines, rhythmic guitar riffs, and consistent percussion\\". Many already began to believe that this album was the beginning of the band's bright career.

It was released on September 14, 1994 in North America and again in the same region in 1996. It was released in Europe on January 26, 1995 for the same console and in Japan in 1998 for the Nintendo Power flash RAM cartridge series and the Super Famicom. The game is also included in the GameCube version of Fight Night Round 2 as an extra game due to the inclusion of Little Mac in the game. The game was released for the Wii's Virtual Console in Europe on March 20, 2009, in North America on March 30, 2009, and in Japan on July 7, 2009. The game was also released on the New Nintendo 3DS eShop on May 5, 2016. Nintendo re-released Super Punch-Out!! in the United States in September 2017 as part of the company's Super NES Classic Edition. It is the fourth game in the Punch-Out!! series, taking place after the Punch-Out!! game for the NES. In Super Punch-Out!! the player controls Little Mac, as he fights his way to become the World Video Boxing Association champion. Players, fighting from a \\"behind the back\\" perspective, must knockout their opponent in three minutes to win. Players can launch jabs, hooks, and uppercuts against their opponents as well as block, dodge, and duck opponents' attacks. Nintendo Integrated Research and Development, led by Genyo Takeda, Minoru Arakawa and Makoto Wada, developed the game. It also featured voice acting by Charles Martinet. The game received praise from reviewers for its cartoon-like style, its colorful, outlandish opponents, simple gameplay controls, and replay value. The game also featured colorful, detailed graphics, which included the usage of transparency that facilitates the game's \\"behind the back\\" perspective. Other reviewers had said that this game lacked the overall appeal, gameplay, or audience of its predecessor. Gameplay The gameplay in Super Punch-Out!! is similar to that of its arcade and NES/FC predecessors. The player controls a nameable boxer as he fights his way to become W.V.B.A. Champion.Wii Shop Channel details for Super Punch-Out!! (Super NES). Retrieved on March 30, 2009. The player controls the boxer from a third- person perspective, with him being translucent on the screen. Players can attack their opponents with jabs to the face or with body blows from either hand. The opponent can deflect punches, so players must aim at the opponent's open spot (where the gloves are not) to connect. Depending on the opponents' stances, they will guard themselves differently, so players need to use the correct punches. As in the first two arcade games of the series, players have a power meter, located on the bottom of the screen. The meter fills up as the player lands punches against the opponent, and it goes down as the player gets hit. When the power meter fills up completely, the player will be able to launch knockout punches such as uppercuts, hooks, and rapid punches. These punches have a slight delay in execution, but they cause more damage to the opponent. Players can also build power as the match progresses, as indicated by the background color behind the player's face on the upper left corner of the screen, which goes from blue to green to yellow to red. The player reaches \\"Power-Up\\" status when the background color reaches red. During this status, the player's punch speed and power increase. They lose their Power-Up status if they are knocked down. The player fights Dragon Chan, who is attempting to kick the player. The player dodges to the right to avoid the kick. Players can avoid attacks from their opponents by dodging to the left or right or by ducking, but players cannot punch while dodging or ducking, nor can they duck body blows. They can also block attacks to either the head or the body, but they cannot block strong punches; strong punches must be avoided by dodging or ducking. Depending on the situation, the player must strategically block, dodge, rope, or duck in order to avoid an opponent's attack. Players can capitalize on the opponent's attacks by launching counter-punches immediately after avoiding an attack. Both the player and the opponent have stamina meters, both displayed on the top of the screen. The meters decrease when either boxer gets hit by a punch. Boxers will get knocked down if their stamina meter runs out. Faster knockdowns will cause that boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is knocked down by a knockout punch. Either boxer will lose if they cannot stand up before the count of ten after being knocked down (resulting in a knockout or KO) or if they are knocked down three times in the match (resulting in a technical knockout or TKO). The player can also recover some stamina while the opponent is down by pressing the buttons on the controller. A meter not displayed on screen is what many skilled players refer to as a \\"dizzy threshold\\". This means that if a player manages to land a given number of consecutive punches, it will put the opponent into a brief \\"dizzy\\" or \\"stunned\\" animation. A \\"dizzied\\" or \\"stunned\\" opponent will appear shaken for a short period of time (in which the match timer freezes temporarily), and the player has a small margin of opportunity to achieve an instant knockdown with a well-timed knockout punch. Each of the 16 opponents varies in how much match time it takes to become \\"dizzied\\", some more quickly than others. There are two opponents who can be knocked out upon the first knockdown, however, a knockdown during a \\"dizzy\\" animation is critical in making this possible. There are eight opponents who can be knocked out in two knockdowns, however, the player must achieve the second knockdown within four seconds of the first knockdown. Finally, there are six opponents who the player must defeat via a TKO as the aforementioned four seconds between the first two knockdowns does not apply. The player has three minutes to knock out the opponent. After three minutes, the match ends, and the player loses; the player cannot win by a decision. After losing, the player can use a continue and fight a rematch. The game ends after all continues have been used; the player must fight all opponents in the current circuit again. The game consists of four circuits in which the player must become the champion. The player can retry any circuit that has already been beaten. The game has a battery–backed memory in which players can save their data and records for future play.  Development  Super Punch-Out!! was released in North America October 1994 and in Europe on . It was rereleased in North America in 1996, and it was released in Japan as part of the Nintendo Power flash RAM cartridge series on March 1, 1998. In addition, Electronic Arts included the game as an unlockable bonus item along with its protagonist as an unlockable boxer in the Nintendo GameCube version of Fight Night Round 2 as part of Nintendo's deal of featuring Nintendo characters in the Nintendo GameCube versions of some EA Sports titles. The game was later released for the Wii's Virtual Console service in Europe and Australia on , in North America on and in Japan on . Super Punch-Out!! is the fourth game in the Punch-Out!! series and was developed by Nintendo Integrated Research and Development and was produced by Minoru Arakawa, Genyo Takeda and Makoto Wada. Voice actor Charles Martinet was credited for providing the voices of the boxers, the referee and the announcer. Nintendo IRD was developing this game simultaneously with Zoda's Revenge: StarTropics II. The game is the closest arcade-to-home console translation of the Punch-Out!! and Super Punch-Out!! arcades; however, like the NES titles, the SNES title is not a direct port. Shortly before the game was finished and released, some screenshots and video footage of the prototype were shown in a video preview of the game, as well as in an issue of Nintendo Power magazine and two official television commercials, which all showed the protagonist of the game with a different look as well as the announcer having a different voice compared to the ones in the final version seen in the finished and released version. In 2016, a direct port of the game was released for the New Nintendo 3DS virtual console.Super Punch-Out!! Review (New 3DS / SNES)  Reception  Super Punch-Out!! received a rave review in GamePro. The reviewer praised the game's good controls, \\"deceptive challenge\\", sprite layouts, animations, and sounds which \\"juice the game's intensity level\\". He stated the game's one flaw was \\"the lack of an easy-to-use two-player mode.\\" The magazine ran alternate reviews by Fred Doughty and Mark Guinane, winners of the 1994 Blockbuster Video World Game Championship. They also gave the game positive assessments, praising the easy-to-learn controls, high challenge level, and artistic design of the characters. Electronic Gaming Monthly's two sports game reviewers criticized the game's unrealistic style, but nonetheless acknowledged that \\"it still has fantastic game play.\\" Next Generation reviewed the game, and stated that most everything in the game was \\"done to perfection\\", making the game \\"a great tribute to the original classic.\\" Several reviewers praised Super Punch- Out!! overall for not trying to be realistic, for the originality of its different opponents, and for its simple controls. Chris Scullion from Official Nintendo Magazine praises the game for its outlandish characters, addictive gameplay, and simple controls. He adds that Super Punch-Out!! is \\"superb way to prepare for the upcoming Wii [Punch-Out!!] title\\". Scullion states that \\"the thing that makes Super Punch-Out!! interesting (along with the rest of the games in the series) is that it's not a realistic boxing game\\". He adds that the opponents in the game are \\"the real stars of the show\\", with each opponent having a unique personality, traits, and boxing styles. Skyler Miller from Allgame, like Scullion, praised the game for its simple, responsive controls, for its colorful, detailed opponents, and for its usage of the Super NES's transparent color palette for the fighter, which facilitates the \\"behind the back\\" perspective. He also appreciates the game's sound and music, in particular the usage of real voice for the announcer. Game Players magazine applauded the game's \\"large, colorful graphics and easy-to-learn controls\\". Reviewers have praised Super Punch-Out!! for its other unique features and for its rewarding difficulty. Game Informer magazine praised the game for its time attack mode, which recorded and kept track of the fastest knockouts for each opponent. Miller also commended the time attack mode, adding to the game's replay value. Another review from VideoGames & Computer Entertainment magazine lauded the game for a fair difficulty curve, stating that it \\"is a really tough game, but it's one in which repeated playing (and you will be playing it a lot) really pays off\\". Lucas Thomas from IGN, while praising the game overall, says that the game lacks the overall appeal that the NES version had and that he recommends the NES version over this version. He notes that the sound is \\"Not as memorable as the music from the NES game, but [is] more varied\\". He says that many people who are familiar with the NES version have to relearn new attack patterns from different opponents. Thomas also notes that the game did not have as large an audience as the NES version enjoyed. In 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly ranked it the 56th best console video game of all time. They explained their decision to include it on the list instead of Punch-Out!!: \\"The NES version is great, but the Super NES one is even better, with large, well-animated characters, great control and a near-perfect learning curve.\\" Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible.

Tuna industry From the 19th century through the 1970s, Italian-Americans, chiefly from the Italian Riviera and Sicily, led the enterprise in the building of the boats that founded the American tuna fishing fleet and canning industry based in San Diego, the \\"tuna capital\\" of the American West Coast. The first large tuna cannery, the Pacific Tuna Canning Company, was founded in 1911. By the mid-1930s the canneries employed more than 1,000 people. Due to rising costs and foreign competition the last of the canneries closed in the early 1980s. A large fishing fleet supported the canneries, mostly staffed by immigrant fishermen from the Portuguese Azores and Italy, whose influence is still felt in neighborhoods like Little Italy and Point Loma. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, many Italian fishermen moved to San Diego. The construction of Interstate 5 in the 1970s split the neighborhood, with the area east of the Interstate becoming part of Bankers Hill.

January 8, 454 - c. 558), also known as St John the Hesychast (Greek: Ἅγιος Ἰωάννης ὁ Ἡσυχαστής), was a Christian saint known for living alone for seventy-six years. He was given the surname because he loved recollection and silence. St. John's feast day is May 13 in the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church, and December 3 in the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches.  Biography  John was born in 454 AD in Nicopolis, Armenia. He came from a family of mainly generals and governors. His parents died when he was 18 and he built a monastery where he stayed with 10 young monks. Under John's direction, they led a life of hard work and devotion. John built a reputation for leadership and sanctity, which led the archbishop of Sebaste to consecrate him bishop of Colonia in Armenia. He was only 28 at the time and had no desire for such a role. Nevertheless, he held the post of bishop for nine years before seeking to return to a life of seclusion. Uncertain of his future vocation, he went to Jerusalem. His biographer says that while John was praying one night, he saw a bright cross form in the air and heard a voice say to him, “If thou desirest to be saved, follow this light.” He saw the light move and point to the monastery of St. Sabas. At 38 years old he joined the monastery, which held 150 monks. After some tests, St. Sabas let John have a separate hermitage for uninterrupted contemplation. For five days a week he fasted and never left his cell but on Saturdays and Sundays he went to public Mass. After three years of this he was made the steward of the monastery. John had never told anyone he had been bishop, so after four years St. Sabas thought John was worthy to become a priest and presented him to the patriarch Elias of Jerusalem. They traveled to Calvary for the ordination but upon their arrival John requested a private audience with the patriarch. John said, “Holy Father, I have something to impart to you in private; after which, if you judge me worthy, I will receive holy orders.” They spoke in private after a promise of secrecy. “Father, I have been ordained bishop; but on account of the multitude of my sins have fled, and am come into this desert to wait the visit of the Lord.” The patriarch was startled but told St. Sabas, “I desire to be excused from ordaining this man, on account of some particulars he has revealed to me.” St. Sabas was afraid John had committed a crime and after he prayed God revealed the truth to him. Sabas complained to John about keeping the secret from him and John wanted to leave the monastery. Sabas convinced him to stay by promising to keep his secret. John stayed in his cell for four years, speaking to no one except the person who brought him necessities. In 503 AD certain turbulent disciples forced St. Sabas to leave his monastery. St. John moved to a nearby wilderness where he spent six years in silence, conversing only with God and eating only wild roots and herbs. When St. Sabas returned to his community, he found John in the desert and convinced him to move back to the monastery. John had become used to speaking only with God and found only bitterness and emptiness in anything else. He treasured obscurity and humility so he wanted to live unknown to men but was unable to do so. He returned with St. Sabas and lived in his cell for forty years. During this time he did not turn people away who desired his instruction. One of these people was Cyril of Scythopolis who wrote about John's life. The two men first met when John was ninety and Cyril was sixteen. Cyril had asked him what to do with his life and John recommended he join the Laura of St. Euthymius but Cyril did not listen. Instead, he went to a small monastery on the bank of the River Jordan. He fell ill there and deeply regretted not listening to John. While there, John appeared to him in a dream and after scolding him for not obeying said that if he returned to St. Euthymius’ monastery, he would get well and find his salvation. The next day he did so and was well again. John died in 558 AD at the age of 104. He lived in solitude for 76 years, interrupted only for the 9 years he was bishop.

The son of worldwide conglomerate Mishima Zaibatsu CEO Heihachi Mishima, Kazuya seeks revenge against his father for throwing him down a cliff years earlier. Kazuya becomes corrupted in later games, seeking to obtain more power and later eventually comes into conflict with his son Jin Kazama. Kazuya possesses the Devil Gene, a mutation which can transform him into a demonic being known as . Devil has often appeared as a separate character in various games. Kazuya is also present in related series media and other games. The character was based on writer Yukio Mishima, with whom he shares a last name. A number of staff members have considered him one of the franchise's strongest characters, which has led to debates about reducing the damage of some of his moves or removing them altogether. Kazuya's devil form was created to bring unrealistic fighters into the series, but the incarnation has made few appearances. Several voice actors have portrayed Kazuya in video games and films related to Tekken. Kazuya has been positively received by critics. A number of websites have listed him as one of the best Tekken characters and one of the best characters in fighting games. Journalists have praised Kazuya's moves and dark characterization, which rivals that of his father. Critical reception of Kazuya's portrayal in films has been mixed, with critics finding him generic.  Concept and creation  alt=A pensive-looking Yukio Mishima Kazuya was created by Takuji Kawano. Tekken producer Katsuhiro Harada created Kazuya Mishima as a corrupted character with a \\"pure dark side\\" as opposed to his father Heihachi Mishima, who Harada identified as having a more \\"human dark side\\". The franchise's design team referred to Kazuya and Nina Williams as \\"the soul [or] the cool part\\" of the original 1994 game. Kazuya's design and characterization was influenced by a variety of sources. Kazuya's family name was taken from author Yukio Mishima, who was also used a model for the character's physical appearance. Harada compared Kazuya to a yakuza, while artist Takayuki Yamaguchi based the character's Tekken 6 costume on a robot. When describing Kazuya's personality, Harada cited him, along with Heihachi and Jin Kazama, as the violent characters of Tekken; he described the family as too quarrelsome. Denying claims that Tekken's plot is too convoluted, Harada said that its basic story is a \\"simple\\" struggle among members of the Mishima family with other characters dragged into the conflict. Kazuya's characterization has been influenced by his tragic past. Despite his initial formulaic traits often seen in fighting games in the first Tekken game similar to Ryu from Street Fighter, Kazuya started showing signs of being a more of antistereotypical in the story; This was due to him becoming the villain from Tekken 2, clashing with his father multiple times who was the originally the boss of the first Tekken game. Harada described Kazuya as focused on power; writing that the character addresses \\"different types of power\\", he explained: \\"that's kind of the story of Tekken and it's shown as the certain reality of people themselves rather than the idea law and order.\\" Namco created Tekken 7's storyline as a conclusion for Kazuya's struggle with Heihachi, though the company wanted the game's overall plot to be easily understood by newcomers. Harada also wanted the game to flesh out the characters' relationship and reveal why they are enemies. As part of the promotion for Tekken 7, he said that either Kazuya or Heihachi would die in their final fight. The game's story mode includes a young Kazuya during the time Heihachi threw his son through a cliff following a fight; Harada said that the version of the character may be playable depending on fan demand. Harada called Kazuya's final fight with Heihachi a \\"major milestone in the storyline\\". Surprised by the length of the rivalry between the characters and Tekken's popularity as a franchise, he felt it necessary to end in a fight to the death. Although Kazuya's rivalry with Heihachi ended in Tekken 7, his relationship with his son Jin was left unresolved. Harada said that Jin's mother Jun Kazama would be \\"an important and essential element in talking about the story of Kazuya and Jin\\". Kazuya's relationship with Jun has been described a common love story in regards to the interactions between a corrupted man and a goodnatured woman, respectively. While Jun was originally meant to be Kazuya's enemy in Tekken 2, the two end up becoming lovers due to Jun finding the hidden caring side in Kazuya behind his devil persona. Kazuya has appeared in games with Street Fighter characters. Kazuya fights Akuma during the end of Tekken 7's story mode; Harada explained that the outcome of the fight was intentionally ambiguous, saying: \\"It’s still a work in progress.\\" He joked that a scene with either character winning or being killed could negatively affect Namco's relationship with Capcom, particularly Capcom CEO Kenzo Tsujimoto. Kazuya teamed up with Nina for the crossover game Street Fighter X Tekken. When creating the illustrations for the characters, artist Kazuma Teshigawara said that he wanted them to complement one another. Nina was selected for the game instead of Anna Williams since her cold personality was similar to Kazuya's. The two characters were featured in the game's first trailer in a fight against Street Fighter characters Ryu and Ken Masters; the trailer was intended to attract the audience with the game's main feature. Completing the game with Kazuya and Nina unlocks ending scene where Nina is revealed as an agent who escapes from Kazuya's forces. Artist Toshio Ohashi described the ending as the game's most cinematic due to similarities between the characters.  Devil persona and voice actors  alt=A devil, with wings spread Kazuya's devil persona was created to meet Bandai Namco's request for more unrealistic characters in Tekken, such as Kuma, in contrast with the Virtua Fighter fighting series. The Devil is unlockable as an alternate skin for Kazuya in the first game, though he appears as a separate character for Tekken 2 with similar moves to Kazuya. Kazuya's devil form represents a common element in fantasy but it stands out due to its being related to his genes, most notably Jin's own devil. The parallelism between Kazuya and Jin's devils were compared with the protagonists from the Star Wars films, Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, respectively. The Devil fights with a laser, (also known as , through his staff and a pair of wings were added later in the game's production. He was made more powerful, with his ten-hit combo easily taking down enemies. Realizing how powerful the character had become, Namco decided to balance his moves before the game's release. The devil form is said to be based on Go Nagai's manga Devilman, where main character Akira Fudo develops a similar appearance. Although Kazuya's devil persona had first appeared as a single character, in Tekken 4 he was removed from the cast; according to Harada, Kazuya (unlike Jin) embraced the powers of the devil. In homage to Tekken: Blood Vengeance, Kazuya's devil form from the film was added as an alternate version of the character for Tag Tournament 2. From the first Tekken to Tag Tournament, Kazuya has been voiced by Jōji Nakata. For the film Tekken: Blood Vengeance, writer Dai Satō added Jin and Kazuya as \\"visual eye-candy\\" similar to the Williams sisters (Nina and Anna). Satō wanted the pairs to be played together in the spin-off game Tekken Tag Tournament 2, which relies on two-person teams. Japanese voice actor Masanori Shinohara enjoyed Kazuya's role in the Tekken CGI film, and hoped his fans would see him in action. Gameplay Kazuya's fighting style is known as . Motion actor Ryu Narushima performed many of Kazuya's moves while he was working on Jin. Kazuya's moves include techniques often used by his father and Jin, but some are unique. According to Harada, Kazuya is one of the most difficult characters for a player to control. He saw Kazuya as a fun character due to how powerful he is. As a result, Harada felt that gamers who lose while playing as him feel ashamed. While fans often questioned him, saying that Lars Alexandersson was the strongest character to use in tournaments, Harada denied such claims, believing the Mishimas were far more powerful. GameSpy said that while Kazuya retained his previous moves in Tekken 5, new additions over-powered the character to the point that players disliked using him. In the next game, GameSpy said that he was given launcher moves which (despite making the character stronger) could leave the player vulnerable. Capcom recommended that players master Kazuya's combo, suggesting that it might turn the character into one of the most powerful in Street Fighter X Tekken. Designing Kazuya's moves for this game, Capcom's Yoshinori Ono emailed Harada for ideas. Capcom soon received a Tekken guide and an email from Harada concerning Kazuya's moves. The character's combo had a glitch in this game, which Capcom patched. In the arcade game Tekken 7 Fated Retribution, three of Kazuya's moves were patched to increase the damage they inflict. In making Tekkens transition to the Unreal Engine, the staff was concerned about leaving Kazuya's Electric Wind Godfist because it was considered over-powered in previous games. Famitsu recommended the character to skilled players, saying that some of his techniques have good potential—most notably , which makes him Tekken 7 strongest character. Appearances=Main Tekken games Before the events of the original Tekken game, Kazuya enters the King of Iron Fist Tournament to seek vengeance against his father Heihachi, who had thrown him off a cliff for unknown reasons. Undefeated, he reaches the final round and battles Heihachi. Kazuya defeats Heihachi and drops him from the same cliff he was thrown from as a child. In Tekken 2, Kazuya has taken over the Mishima Zaibatsu, which engages in illegal activities such as assassination, extortion, arms dealing, and the smuggling of protected species. Kazuya then announces a second King of Iron Fist Tournament. He is the game's final boss, and his alter-ego Devil is a hidden boss. The Devil is said to appear as overpowered version of Kazuya who became one with him before the events of the first Tekken game. Heihachi reclaims the Mishima Zaibatsu by defeating Kazuya and throws him into the mouth of an erupting volcano. Tekken 3 begins with Kazuya having impregnated Jun Kazama before his defeat by Heihachi. He returns as the main character in Tekken 4, set 21 years after Tekken 2. Kazuya was revived by G Corporation (a genetics-company rival of the Mishima Zaibatsu), and allows the company to perform experiments on him to learn the nature of his Devil Gene. He vows revenge on Heihachi in the King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 and to extract the half of his Devil Gene in the body of his son, Jin Kazama. Heihachi leads Kazuya to Hon-Maru, a Mishima compound where Jin is held captive. Kazuya, influenced by Devil, knocks Heihachi out of the room with his psychic power and taunts Jin to wake him up. Jin defeats Kazuya and Heihachi in battle, but spares their lives. In Tekken 5, Kazuya and Heihachi are assaulted by a squadron of Jack-4s (machines sent to assassinate them by G Corporation for the Tekken Force raid on the corporation's laboratories) after Jin's departure from Hon-Maru. Kazuya jumps out of Hon-Maru, letting Heihachi die. Vowing revenge on G Corporation for their treachery, Kazuya enters the King of Iron Fist Tournament 5. In Tekken 6, as the corporation's shadow head, he converts it into a military company which is the only opposition to the Mishima Zaibatsu (led by Jin), which has begun world conquest and declared war on several countries. The world sees G Corporation as its only savior, although Kazuya intends to kill Jin and dominate the world himself. He uses the company's influence to stop Jin from world domination. Kazuya meets his half- brother, Lars Alexandersson, before he can face Jin. They fight, and Kazuya is forced to leave. In Tekken 7, Kazuya's mother is revealed as Kazumi Mishima, who died while trying to kill Heihachi. It is revealed the young Kazuya sought revenge against his father but Heihachi threw him to the cliff as he noticed Kazuya inherited Kazumi's Devil Gene, which he finally confirms it. In the story, Kazuya sends an army of Jack-6 robots to the Mishima dojo to eliminate Heihachi, who was confronted by the warrior Akuma moments before. Akuma says that he was sent by Kazumi to kill Kazuya and Heihachi, later confronting Kazuya at G Corporation's Millennium Tower and revealing his debt to Kazumi for saving his life from an unknown critical situation he was in. Surviving defeat by Akuma, Heihachi secretly captures images of the battle in which Kazuya transforms into his devil form. He broadcasts the images worldwide, exposing Kazuya's nature to undermine public trust in G Corporation as the Zaibatsu's opponents in the war. Heihachi blasts the Millennium Tower with a satellite in an attempt to destroy Kazuya and Akuma; Kazuya survives the attack, and destroys the satellite with a devil beam. Heihachi tells a reporter that Kazuya's devil gene came from his mother, Kazumi. In the final battle at the mouth of a volcano, Kazuya (the final boss of the story mode) transforms into his devil form, kills Heihachi, and throws him into a lava pit. Akuma resurfaces, having survived the previous blast. Kazuya transforms into his final devil form and they battle once more, with the outcome unknown. Other games Kazuya is the protagonist of the Tekken mobile game. He also appears in the non-canonical Tekken Tag Tournament, confronting his son's devil form at the end. Kazuya's devil persona is also playable; the game ends with his taking Jun after defeating her alter ego. In the sequel, Tekken Tag Tournament 2, Kazuya murders Jun to increase the power of his own devil form. He can morph into Devil during gameplay with several new moves, instead of becoming a separate character. Kazuya also appears in Tekken Revolution. He appeared in devil form in the crossover strategy RPG Namco × Capcom, with several other Namco and Capcom characters. Kazuya made a playable debut in human form—also transforming into his devil form—in the sequel of Namco × Capcom successor, Project X Zone 2, teaming up with his son, Jin. Kazuya's image is downloadable content in Namco's Ace Combat: Assault Horizon, and it appears as in Taiko: Drum Master V Version. Although he does not appear, Kazuya is mentioned in the crossover fighting game PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale. He was one of the first characters featured in the Capcom's crossover fighting game, Street Fighter X Tekken. In the debut trailer, Kazuya defeats Dan Hibiki in to confront Street Fighter mascot Ryu. He wants to seize Pandora's Box to control the devil gene, and hires Nina Williams to assist him. Kazuya appeared in CyberConnect2's tactical role-playing game Full Bokko Heroes X in his Tekken 7 design, with a chibi look. He also appears in SNK's mobile phone game The King of Fighters All Star. Other media Kazuya is the protagonist in the 1998 original video animation (OVA) Tekken: The Motion Picture. As in the Tekken game series, he is thrown off a cliff at a young age by Heihachi and saved by a deal with the devil. Kazuya becomes bent on revenge against Heihachi and enters the King of Iron Fist Tournament to confront him. Jun Kazama repeatedly implores him not to kill his father; after Kazuya defeats Heihachi, Jun destroys the devil's influence and restores his kind, compassionate self. He spares Heihachi's life and fathers Jin with Jun, but is not seen after the tournament's conclusion. Kazuya is voiced by Kazuhiro Yamaji in the original Japanese version and Adam Dudley in the English dub. He is also featured in the Tekken Forever and Tekken Saga comics. In the Titan comic, Kazuya briefly faces his son before assaulting the Mishima corporation. Played by Ian Anthony Dale, he is the antagonist in the 2009 live-action film Tekken. Kazuya is Heihachi's right-hand man at Tekken Corporation, hoping to take over his father's company. Impatient with Heihachi's compassion for Jin, he overthrows him and orders his execution (although Heihachi persuades the soldier to spare him). After Jin wins the tournament, Kazuya challenges him to a one-on-one duel. Initially defeating Jin, Kazuya is critically wounded; however, Jin refuses to kill him because of their blood relation and lets him live in shame. Japanese-American martial artist-actor Kane Kosugi played Kazuya in the 2014 prequel, Tekken 2: Kazuya's Revenge. An amnesiac afer experiments by his father, Kazuya spends the movie fighting until he regains his memory. He is present in the CGI-animated film Tekken: Blood Vengeance, an alternate version of the events between Tekken 5 and Tekken 6; Kazuya, an antagonist, faces his father and son and is defeated by the latter. Played by Kefi Abrikh, he appears in the live-action short film Tekken Tag Tournament 2. His role in the franchise is also told in the novel, Tekken: The Dark History of Mishima. Reception alt=Statue of Jin and Kazuya in a fighting pose Critical reception of the character has been largely positive, and he has often been listed as one of the best Tekken characters due to his appeal to gamers. Complex writers praised his dark backstory, saying that Kazuya became increasingly attractive over time, calling him the greatest character of the franchise. According to the magazine's website, Kazuya was one of the characters they wanted to see in Super Smash Bros. Brawl 4. FHM compared him to Street Fighter Ryu, based on their popularity and representation of their respective series. Kazuya was also compared to his father, Heihachi, due to their similar natures and rivalry. Bandai Namco opened the Tekken Museum in Osaka in May 2012, where a statue of Kazuya and Jin performing a cross-counter was exhibited. A number of websites have noted on Kazuya's dark characterization in the games. Den of Geek enjoyed Kazuya's strong violence, such as his murder of his grandfather Jinpachi Mishima at the end of Tekken 5. By Tekken 4, IGN had praised his evil traits and intention to participate in the series' tournaments. Although GamesRadar noted that Kazuya had been disliked, they and other websites praised his transformation into a devil (enhancing his evil characteristics). Kotaku compared him with Heihachi and called him one of gaming's worst parents due to his antagonism to his son, Jin. PlayStation Universe ranked Kazuya and Heihachi among the top five rival pairs in Tekken Tag Tournament 2 due to their relationship and power, describing them as one of the game's best tags.Mike Harradence, Tekken's greatest rivals make the best Tag Teams , PlayStation Universe, September 19, 2012 While enjoying his appearances in the series, Den of Geek felt Kazuya tends to lose most of his fights in the franchise. Kazuya's alter ego, Devil Kazuya, was also praised. The difficulty in unlocking him in the series' first game did not prevent him from being listed as one of the best characters, similar to Kazuya. According to GamesRadar, players wanted to see a fight between Devil Kazuya and Akuma in Street Fighter X Tekken due to the similarities in their design. In a Namco poll, Kazuya was the 18th-most- requested Tekken character to be playable in Tekken X Street Fighter (with 6.51 percent of the vote); 5.05 percent of the votes were cast for Devil, a separate voting option. In Tekken 7, a bonus fight between Devil Kazuya and Akuma could be unlocked. Calling Devil Kazuya a difficult opponent, Shacknews and Hobby Consolas said that Akuma offered players a challenge; gamers needed to learn Devil Kazuya's moves to defeat him, resulting in the game's most difficult fight. Websites have also noted Kazuya's moves, and his Lightning Screw Uppercut was listed by GamesRadar as one of the most satisfying uppercuts in gaming history. Prima Games praised Kazuya's Electric Wind God Fist for its impact on the enemy and possible player combos, and ArcadeSushi recommended it to players wanting to use the Mishima characters. Kazuya's Spinning Demon was performed by Eric Jacobus, attracting Harada's attention. Kazuya's appearances outside the Tekken games have also been noted. Alex Henning of The Fandom Post stated that John Kim's Western comics adapted well Kazuya's personality in the series, finding it similar to his game incarnation. For the anime film Tekken: The Motion Picture, Eric Sandroni of Games Retrospect called Kazuya one of the film's characters who seemed realistic. However, his English voice actor Adam Dudley has been criticized for his portrayal of the character. In a review of the first Tekken live- action film, DVD Talk had negative opinions on Kazuya and Heihachi's subplot regarding their rivalry. In Kazuya's Revenge, Manlu Movie panned the actor's performance. GameCrate disliked his moves (calling them \\"noticeably generic\\") and his romantic relationship with Laura. Phil Wheat had mixed feelings about Kazuya's role, saying he was still appealing though longtime fans may dislike the changes to his character; Wheat described the teaser for a new film as engaging, and said that he enjoyed seeing Kazuya fight his son, Jin. Games Retrospect was harsher, calling Kazuya a \\"flat\\" character due to his generic traits.

It was founded on December 28, 1896 and is published in compact format since April 2006 (it had traditionally been printed in broadsheet). It is distributed mainly in Quebec City; however, it is also for sale at newsstands in Ottawa, Montreal, New Brunswick and some places in Florida, where many Quebecers spend the winter. It is owned by Groupe Capitales Médias. On weekdays Le Soleil contains four sections : the front section (Actualités), containing local and international news coverage; the Arts & Life, or \\"B\\" section (Arts & Vie); the Business, or \\"C\\" section (Économie); and the Sports, or \\"S\\" section.  History  Le Soleil rose from the ashes of L'Électeur, the official newspaper of the Liberal Party of Canada, which shut down in December 1896. The first edition was published on December 28, 1896. one day after the disappearance of its predecessor, which shut down because the Catholic clergy had forbidden it to parishioners when the newspaper criticized the Church's electoral interference. It was renamed Le Soleil in reference to Le Soleil, a daily newspaper based in Paris by the same name. In 1957, Le Soleil (then owned by Oscar Gilbert) cut ties to the Liberal Party of Canada in order to concentrate on news coverage. Daily circulation rose past 100,000 in the 1960s, and over 150,000 in the 1970s. Beginning in 1973, many large corporations began to express interest in acquiring Le Soleil. Controversy was stirred when Paul Desmarais's Power Corporation of Canada announced its intention to buy the daily. It provoked the intervention of then-Quebec premier Robert Bourassa because such a transaction would have concentrated 70% of Quebec francophone daily newspapers in the hands of a single company. Eventually the paper was bought by Unimédia. In 1987, Conrad Black's Hollinger Inc. acquired the newspaper. It would eventually pass into the hands of Groupe Gesca, which also owns several Quebec newspapers, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Power Corporation of Canada. In 2006, the newspaper had switched to a tabloid format at the same time as Sherbrooke's La Tribune and Trois- Rivières's Le Nouvelliste, all owned by Gesca. Recent declines in readership due to competition by Le Journal de Québec was the main explanation of the switch from a broadsheet format.  Circulation  Le Soleil has seen like most Canadian daily newspapers a decline in circulation. Its total circulation dropped by percent to 78,455 copies daily from 2009 to 2015. :::::::::Daily average Figures refer to the total circulation (print and digital combined) which includes paid and unpaid copies.

He was a second baseman and outfielder in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres and Baltimore Orioles between 1981 and 1987. A speedy leadoff hitter, Wiggins had his best season with the pennant-winning Padres in 1984. He batted one slot in the lineup ahead of Tony Gwynn that year, and the pair's offensive production helped the Padres win the National League Championship Series (NLCS) and advance to the World Series. Wiggins grew up in California and attended Pasadena City College before being drafted by the California Angels in 1977. He played in the minor league systems of the Angels and the Los Angeles Dodgers, setting a professional baseball single-season record with 120 stolen bases in 1980. He made his major league debut with the San Diego Padres in 1981, and he became a regular player within two years. In 1983 he set the Padres' single-season stolen base record, a mark that he extended the following season. His 1984 stolen bases total (70) is still a team record as of the start of the 2019 season. During his major league career, Wiggins struggled with drug addiction, which resulted in several arrests and suspensions from baseball. His drug problems prompted a 1985 trade from San Diego to Baltimore, where Wiggins spent three seasons. After leaving baseball, he was diagnosed with AIDS, and he was the first MLB player known to die of the disease. Long after his death, two of his children, Candice and Alan Jr., became professional basketball players. Early life Wiggins was born in Los Angeles, California, and his mother, Karla Wiggins, raised him as a single mother. As a child, he played baseball with his friends at a park across from the Rose Bowl, and he was a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers and their base-stealing shortstop, Maury Wills. Wiggins graduated from John Muir High School in Pasadena, California, which was also the alma mater of Dodgers star Jackie Robinson. Gib Bodet, a scout for the Montreal Expos, noticed Wiggins in high school. Wiggins was tall, which was taller than a typical infielder. He was only an average hitter and fielder, but his speed stood out to Bodet. The California Angels selected Wiggins as the eighth overall pick of the January 1977 MLB amateur draft. In 1977 Wiggins played junior college baseball at Pasadena City College, where he was a teammate of future major leaguers Matt Young and Rod Booker. Bodet, who had moved to the Angels scouting staff just before the draft, joined other Angels staff members and worked out with Wiggins after the team selected him. Angels coach Bob Clear told Wiggins that his excellent speed would help him to a high batting average even if his hitting skills were not that strong: \\"If you can hit .200, you can run the other eighty points. And if you can hit .280, you can lead off for anybody.\\" Wiggins signed with the Angels in May for $2,500 after what Bodet described as \\"a tough negotiation\\". According to Bodet, Wiggins' mother \\"did not trust easily\\". Baseball career=Early career Wiggins played minor league baseball in 1977 for the Angels rookie-league affiliate in Idaho Falls, where he hit .271 and had 25 stolen bases in 63 games. In 1978, with the ClassA Quad Cities Angels, Wiggins stole 26 bases in 49 games, but his batting average fell to .201. Following a mid-season fight with one of his coaches, he was released by the Angels organization in June 1978. Wiggins feared that his career was near its end, but he reached out to Los Angeles Dodgers scout Gail Henley. After a workout in front of the Dodgers and manager Tommy Lasorda, Wiggins signed with the team before the 1979 season, receiving an invitation to spring training and then being assigned to the team's ClassA affiliate, the Clinton Dodgers. In 95 games for Clinton, Wiggins hit .257, stole 43 bases, and converted to a shortstop after spending the previous two seasons as a second baseman. He also appeared in the outfield and at all three of the other infield positions for Clinton. Playing with the ClassA Lodi Dodgers of the California League in 1980, Wiggins batted .288 and scored 108 runs while stealing 120 bases in just 135 games. He established a professional baseball single-season steals record, surpassing the previous minor league mark of 116 set by Allan Lewis in 1966, as well as Lou Brock's major league record of 118 in 1974. After the 1980 season, Wiggins' fourth year in the minor leagues, he was eligible to be selected by other teams in that year's Rule 5 draft. The Rule 5 draft is a procedure that stops teams from hoarding young players in the minor leagues when those players might be able to make it to the major leagues with other organizations. A team can protect a player from the Rule 5 draft by adding him to its major league roster. The Dodgers decided not to protect Wiggins, and since he had once caught the eye of San Diego Padres general manager Jack McKeon, the Padres selected him in the draft. Padres officials later said that they knew Wiggins had been arrested for possession of marijuana while with the Dodgers. \\"It was known in our organization that he had a problem in the Dodger organization. They didn't want a part of it,\\" Padres manager Dick Williams said. San Diego Padres After having spent most of his minor league career as an infielder, he was used almost exclusively as an outfielder with the Hawaii Islanders of the Pacific Coast League in 1981. He batted .302 with 73 steals, and received a September call-up to the major leagues as an outfielder. In his first stint with the Padres, he got five hits in 14 at bats. Wiggins began the following season with the Islanders, but he was called up again by the Padres in early May to replace injured outfielder Gene Richards. Wiggins was leading San Diego with 29 stolen bases in 59 games when he was arrested for possession of cocaine in July. He was issued a 30-day suspension from baseball, and spent a month in a substance abuse treatment facility. The Padres, who were one of the first sports teams to offer an employee assistance program to players, paid for all of his treatment, and he returned to the team in September. By 1983 Wiggins had become a regular in the Padres lineup, batting in the leadoff spot and playing in the outfield for most of the season. He was exceptional on defense in left field, hit .276 and stole 66 bases. He was moved to first base for the last 45 games of the year after Steve Garvey suffered a broken thumb. Wiggins' stolen bases total broke the single-season team record of 61 set by Richards in 1980. Wiggins was named the team's most valuable player that season. Wiggins was moved to second base in 1984, making room for rookie Carmelo Martínez in the outfield. Until that season, Martínez had been a first baseman, but the Padres already had a strong player there with Garvey, and they wanted to get Martínez into the lineup to improve their outfield's home run production. Wiggins retained the leadoff spot in the lineup, hitting ahead of Tony Gwynn. During a May game, Wiggins became the fifth 20th-century MLB player to steal five bases in one game, tying a National League (NL) record. In August, Wiggins unwittingly became a party to a series of fights when he was hit with the first pitch of a game by Atlanta Braves pitcher Pascual Pérez. The teams retaliated against each other throughout the game with brushback pitches and beanballs, and the tension resulted in three fights and several ejections. Manager Dick Williams said that Wiggins was the league's most valuable player in 1984. On the season, Wiggins scored 106 runs, stole 70 bases and led the league with 391 putouts. His stolen bases total stood as a Padres single-season record as of the end of the 2017 season. Benefitting from the higher number of fastballs opposing pitchers threw in response to Wiggins' speed, Gwynn batted above .400 when his speedy teammate was on base, and hit .351 overall for the first of his eight career batting titles. The duo was one of the biggest reasons behind San Diego's success. The team could score quickly with Wiggins getting on first, stealing second, and scoring on a hit by Gwynn. Wiggins batted .316 in the 1984 NLCS against the Chicago Cubs, going two-for-three with two runs scored in the fifth and deciding game. In the 1984 World Series against the Detroit Tigers, which the Padres lost in five games, Wiggins batted .364 and scored twice. His eight hits were the most of any Padres player in the series. According to manager Dick Williams, Wiggins was \\"absolutely the most valuable player in the National League in 1984\\". \\"Alan Wiggins' role in bringing San Diego the 1984 National League championship wasn't put into proper perspective until the Padres tried to defend their title without him,\\" sportswriter Phil Collier later wrote. Before the 1985 season, the Padres signed Wiggins to a four-year contract extension worth nearly $3million. His agent described him as one of the highest-paid NL second basemen. Wiggins missed the last two weeks of spring training after injuring his knee during a double-play attempt on defense when a baserunner slid into him. He was unavailable for the start of the season, but returned to the lineup after being out for five games. Wiggins was batting .054 and was without a stolen base two weeks into the season when he was suspended by the Padres following a relapse into cocaine dependency. After Wiggins completed a drug rehabilitation program, the Padres did not want to reactivate him, but baseball's joint review board cleared him to return to play. In June, Donald Fehr of the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) announced that he intended to file a grievance against the Padres if they did not promptly activate Wiggins. The Padres sought to trade Wiggins and the Baltimore Orioles showed interest, but as the trade deadline approached, the Orioles were reportedly only offering two minor league players in exchange for him. On June 27, 1985, Wiggins was traded to the Orioles for pitchers Roy Lee Jackson and Richard Caldwell. Padres owner Joan Kroc said that the team had warned Wiggins that he would not remain with the team if he had further problems with drugs. She stated that it would have been self-serving to keep Wiggins after his relapse when he could instead pursue a fresh start with another team. Nonetheless, Gwynn felt that Wiggins had been shortchanged by the Padres. Baltimore Orioles  Wiggins spent a few days in the minor leagues before being called up to Baltimore. In his first game with the Orioles, he started at second base and was the team's leadoff hitter, reaching base three times, driving in a run and scoring a run. After the game, Wiggins commented that he felt welcome on the team and did not feel like he was starting out with anything to prove. In 76 games for Baltimore that year, he hit .285, scored 43 runs and finished eighth in the American League with 30 stolen bases. Baltimore fans felt that Wiggins was lazy, as he often stopped running to first base on ground balls and showed a lack of effort on defense. He spent much of his time alone and did not talk to his teammates for much of the season. Wiggins later said that he had been depressed because he missed his wife and children, who were still living in San Diego. His family moved to a suburb of Baltimore before the 1986 season, but Wiggins still struggled to win over Orioles fans and teammates. When the team asked him to field extra ground balls during spring training, he complied but did so sluggishly. Later in the year, he angered Cal Ripken Jr. when he threw a bat in frustration and the bat struck Ripken in the dugout. In June, Wiggins was tagged out with the hidden ball trick, and he made three errors the next day, including two in the same inning. After the two-error inning, Baltimore fans booed as his picture was revealed on the scoreboard during a \\"Who Am I\\" feature at the ballpark. Wiggins was frustrated by the fan response because he had relatives at the game that day. Manager Earl Weaver understood why Wiggins was upset over the timing of the scoreboard feature, but he said that Wiggins \\"had more chances than anyone who ever wore an Orioles' uniform\\". He batted .251 with 21 stolen bases and 30 runs scored, played only 71 games, and was reassigned to the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings at one point in the season. The following season, Cal Ripken Sr. replaced Weaver as manager of the Orioles. Baltimore signed Rick Burleson to play second base and Ray Knight to play third base. The moves seemed to leave Wiggins battling for an outfield spot, but after he hit .413 during spring training, Ripken suggested that he might use Wiggins as a utility player. Just before the season started, Wiggins said he was not happy with Ripken's idea of using him in a utility role, feeling that his spring performance should have secured him a starting position. He believed that he could be an asset in the leadoff batting slot. At the start of the 1987 regular season, Wiggins spent some time as a designated hitter (DH) and shared second base duties with Burleson. Rookie second baseman Billy Ripken joined the club on July10. Burleson was cut, but general manager Hank Peters said, \\"We're not bringing [Billy Ripken] up here to sit on the bench.\\" Wiggins was hitting .242 on July10, and he played mostly DH after the rookie's arrival. In early August, Wiggins received a three-day suspension after he got into an altercation with teammate Jim Dwyer and grabbed the shirt of Ripken Sr. On September1 MLB indefinitely suspended Wiggins for a behavior issue, and an anonymous Orioles official told the media that the suspension resulted from a positive drug screen. Wiggins was released from the Orioles on September29 and the team had to pay him two-thirds of his $800,000 salary for 1988. MLBPA officials announced that they would not issue grievances related to Wiggins' suspension and subsequent release, noting that Wiggins wanted to be released by that point. Later years Tony Gwynn, Wiggins' teammate and friend on the Padres Though Wiggins did not give up hope for a return to baseball, he began to study the real estate market after his suspension from the game. In the late 1980s Wiggins started to suffer from health difficulties related to AIDS, though the diagnosis was not publicly disclosed while he was alive. He was receiving deferred payments from his baseball career, and he began to make plans for the financial future of his children. He told one of his former teammates that he was getting into computer work. Gwynn said that he had seen Wiggins in the spring of 1990 and was struck by his visible weight loss. In his final months, he sold his home in Poway, California, and moved to Pasadena. Though he often stayed with friends, some of his longtime friends felt that he died in seclusion, embarrassed by what had happened with his life. In November 1990 Wiggins was hospitalized with pneumonia and tuberculosis at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Wiggins stated that he had contracted HIV via intravenous drug use. After lapsing in and out of consciousness for a month, he died at the hospital on January6, 1991. Wiggins' family initially attributed his death to lung cancer that had led to respiratory failure. Family members said that he had gotten sick with a cough and that his condition had worsened quickly. Wiggins weighed under at the time of his death. Several days after Wiggins died, a physician disclosed that his health problems were complications of AIDS. He became the first baseball player known to have died from AIDS. After Wiggins died, longtime Oriole Frank Robinson said, \\"He was a very bright individual, and you could like the guy. But there was always something there to back you off.\\" Former Padres player Garry Templeton said that he might have been Wiggins' closest friend, but said that he did not know that Wiggins had been ill. Wiggins is buried at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California. Personal life Wiggins met his wife Angela when they were in junior high school, and they both graduated from John Muir High School. The Los Angeles Times reported that Wiggins had experienced marital strife, but that he would not entertain the thought of divorce; he wanted to ensure that his children did not grow up in a single- parent household as he had. Two of Wiggins' three children became professional basketball players. Candice, an All-American at Stanford University, joined the Minnesota Lynx as the third overall pick in the 2008 WNBA draft. She has served as a spokesperson for the Greater Than AIDS campaign. Alan Jr. played at the University of San Francisco and professionally in several countries. His oldest daughter, Cassandra, played college basketball at New York University. Wiggins and his mother were very close, and her 1983 bipolar disorder diagnosis may have contributed to his drug problems. He was devastated that she would not be able to enjoy his success in the major leagues. In the last few years of Wiggins' life, he enjoyed a closer relationship with his father, Albert, and he often took his children on visits to see their grandfather. Wiggins had a very difficult time with his father's death in May 1990. The Orioles once gave an IQ test, and Wiggins scored higher than everyone except for Weaver. Wiggins' agent, Tony Attanasio, said that Wiggins' intelligence had caused problems in his relationships with teammates. He said that Wiggins had always been reserved and had a difficult time trusting other people. Wiggins enjoyed stubbornly engaging in debates with his teammates, particularly Padres pitcher Eric Show, just to provoke reactions from them. He liked to read books and newspapers, and his teammates were turned off by these displays of his intellect. According to Attanasio, players in Baltimore also resented Wiggins because he replaced Rich Dauer, who had been a well-liked member of the team. Lee Lacy was one of Wiggins' few friends on the Orioles. Tony Gwynn suggested that Wiggins was sometimes misunderstood. \\"To not like Alan Wiggins, is to not know Alan Wiggins,\\" Gwynn said.

It is part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest, Beeding Hill to Newtimber Hill. Devil's Dyke was a major local tourist attraction in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Geological history The Dyke is formed in rocks of the Chalk Group which originated as marine sediments during the Cretaceous period. It is a misconception common amongst local residents of Brighton that the valley was formed by some kind of glacial action, the myth of a 'glacier' being a misunderstanding of accounts such as this one from the Encyclopaedia of Brighton by Timothy Carder (1990): > \\"In reality the 300-foot-deep valley was carved by tremendous amounts of > water running off the Downs during the last Ice Age when large amounts of > snow thawed and the frozen chalk prevented any further absorption; erosion > was aided by the freeze-thaw cycle and the valley was deepened by the > 'sludging' of the saturated chalk.\\". The Devil's Dyke V-shaped dry valley is the result of solifluction and river erosion. More than fourteen thousand years ago, the area experienced an intensely cold climate (but not glacial conditions). Snowfields capped the South Downs. Permafrost conditions meant that the chalk was permanently frozen. In summer, the snowfields melted and saturated the top layer of soil, because the water could not permeate the frozen chalk underneath. Waterlogged material situated above the permafrost slid down the gradient, removing material by friction, exposing deeper layers of frozen chalk. When the Ice Age ended, the snowfields covering the South Downs melted, and rivers formed across Sussex. The Devil's Dyke valley was completed by one such river. Geography The Devil's Dyke Hotel and Restaurant. The hills surrounding the valley rise to 217 metres and offer views of the South Downs, The Weald, and - on a clear day - the Isle of Wight. It is the site of ramparts, all that remain of an Iron Age hillfort, and a pub. It is a popular local beauty spot for the Brighton and Hove area, being an easy journey of just a few miles by car . Myths regarding the formation of Devil's Dyke Local folklore explains the valley as the work of the devil. The legend holds that the devil was digging a trench to allow the sea to flood the many churches in the Weald of Sussex. The digging disturbed an old woman who lit a candle, or angered a rooster causing it to crow, making the devil believe that the morning was fast approaching. The devil then fled, leaving his trench unfinished. The last shovel of earth he threw over his shoulder fell into the sea, forming the Isle of Wight. A further variant has it that the Devil's digging was terminated by him stubbing his toe on a large rock which he kicked in anger over the hills towards the sea, then abandoning his diabolic plans of Weald destruction due to the injuries sustained. The rock landed in the area now known, consequently, as Goldstone valley in Hove. The Goldstone acquired its name from the hints of gold in its makeup. The enormous and mysterious rock now lies in Hove Park in Goldstone Valley, near where it was first discovered. It can be seen at the Old Shoreham Road end of the park and is considered to have been possibly an object of Druid worship. Another story holds that rather than digging to flood Sussex, he was simply in a huge goat-like form, intending to crush the surrounding area. He smelt the tang of salt water in the wind, and fearing his coat would get damp (for he is vain to the point of sin), he fled leaving nothing but a hoof-print, now known as Devil's Dyke. English pagan Black Metal band Old Forest released a song and video titled 'The Devil's Dyke' on their 23 April 2008 'Death To Music Productions' EP release 'Tales of the Sussex Weald ; Part 1 (The Legend of the Devil's Dyke)'. History View from Devil's Dyke Ancient history Before and after the Iron Age, Devil's Dyke was used as a defensive site. This was probably because of its commanding view of the surrounding terrain, and also its steep edges surrounded by large expanses of flat land. In the Iron Age, Devil's Dyke was an important site. All the vegetation was scraped off the white chalk, leaving Devil's Dyke as an impressive monument to both attract and intimidate the populace. Victorian times Steep Grade Railway about 1908 In late Victorian times Devil's Dyke became a tourist attraction, complete with a fairground, two bandstands, an observatory and a camera obscura, all served by a branchline from Hove. During its heyday, Devil's Dyke was a huge attraction for the Victorians, with 30,000 people visiting on Whit Monday in 1893. * From 1887–1938 a single-track railway branch line operated from near Aldrington in Hove to The Dyke railway station, the current Dyke Farm location, to transport sightseers to the foot of the hill. * From 1894–1909 a cable car operated across the valley, covering a distance of 350 m, suspended 70 m above the valley floor. * From 1897–1909 the narrow gauge funicular Steep Grade Railway rose 100 m from near Poynings to the northern edge of the hillfort. Traces remain of all three ventures, including the remains of concrete pylon supports for the cable car system. Current use In May 2014 a large illegal rave was reported in the National Park. However, police were unable to shut it down, as they did not have sufficient officers available. Authorities estimated that revellers numbered close to 2,000. Devil's Dyke has also become a popular site for paragliding.https://www.shgc.org.uk/files/siteguides/SHGC%20Sites%20Guide%202018a.pdf ReferencesExternal links * National Trust Information on Devil's Dyke * The Devil's Dyke EXPLORED * Country File video * Abandoned Lines and Railways * Videos of paragliding etc. Category:Valleys of East Sussex Category:History of East Sussex Category:Tourist attractions in East Sussex Category:Areas of Brighton and Hove Category:Ancient dikes Category:English folklore Category:Linear earthworks ","title":"Devil's Dyke, Sussex"},{"id":"1884667","text":"Article from the December 29, 1825 edition of the National Gazette and Literary Register published in Philadelphia reporting that Missouri Senator \\"Col. Palmer [ Martin Parmer ] is said to have taken French leave and gone to Texas.\\". A French leave is a departure from a location or event without informing others or without seeking approval.Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable (Millennium Edition; London: Cassell, 1999) Examples include relatively innocuous acts such as leaving a party without bidding farewell in order to avoid disturbing or upsetting the host, or more problematic acts such as a soldier leaving his post without authorization. The phrase is first recorded in 1771 and was born at a time when the English and French cultures were heavily interlinked. In French, the equivalent phrase is filer à l'anglaise (\\"to leave English style\\")Anu Garg's A.Word.A.Day, September 8, 2008. http://wordsmith.org/words/chinese_puzzle.html and seems to date from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. First usage The Oxford English Dictionary records: \\"the custom (in the 18th century prevalent in France and sometimes imitated in England) of going away from a reception, etc. without taking leave of the host or hostess. Hence, jocularly, to take French leave is to go away, or do anything, without permission or notice.\\" OED states the first recorded usage as: 1771 SMOLLETT Humph. Cl. (1895) 238 \\"He stole away an Irishman's bride, and took a French leave of me and his master\\". James Boswell's journal for November 15, 1762 mentions his friend not seeing him off on his leaving Scotland \\"... as Cairnie told me that people never took leave in France, I made the thing sit pretty easy.\\" In Canada and the United States, the expression Irish goodbye is also used. Military usage The term is especially used to mean the act of leisurely absence from a military unit.For the usage, see for example The war memoirs of Commandant Ludwig Krause 1899-1900, Cape Town 1996, p. 65. This comes from the rich history of Franco- English conflict; as Spain has a similar saying concerning the French (despedida a la francesa), it may have come from the Napoleonic campaign in the Iberian Peninsula which pitted the French against an Anglo-Portuguese and Spanish alliance.

Life Max Koegel was born on 16 October 1895 in Füssen, in the Kingdom of Bavaria. He was the fourth son of a carpenter who worked at a local furniture factory. Shortly before his sixth birthday, Koegel's mother died from complications during childbirth. In 1907, his father died and Max was sent to live with a family at a nearby farm. He also had to leave school and began training as a shepherd and later worked as a mountain guide. When the First World War broke out, Koegel volunteered to join the Bavarian infantry. He served in the military until 12 January 1919 and reached the rank of corporal. He was wounded three times, including once during the Battle of Verdun, and received the Iron Cross second class. After the war, Koegel returned to Bavaria and worked as a customs clerk in Garmisch- Partenkirchen. In 1920, he left the civil service and opened a souvenir shop. However, four years later he filed for bankruptcy after he was charged with fraud, for which he received a suspended sentence. He went on to travel for work in Switzerland and Austria before returning to Füssen, where he obtained a job in his father's old furniture factory. At that time, he joined the Völkischer Bund and Bund Oberland, both extreme nationalist and anti-Semitic organisations. In 1929, Koegel's eight-year-old son died from measles and a short time later, his marriage of ten years ended in divorce. Koegel became a member of the NSDAP (#1179781) on 2 May 1932, and of the SS (#37644) in June 1932. SS service Koegel became adjutant to the Dachau concentration camp commander in 1937. From 1938 to 1942 he was first \\"Direktor\\" (managing director) and then commander of the labour camp for women in Lichtenburg at Ravensbrück at the rank of Sturmbannführer (Major). In 1942 he was commander of the extermination camp Majdanek and was involved in the installation of gas chambers at this site. From 1943 to 1945 he was commander at Flossenbürg concentration camp. After the war, Koegel went on the run and was not arrested until June 1946 in Schwabach, near Nuremberg. He committed suicide by hanging in his prison cell only a day later on 27 June 1946.

In molecular biology, CD4 (cluster of differentiation 4) is a glycoprotein found on the surface of immune cells such as T helper cells, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. It was discovered in the late 1970s and was originally known as leu-3 and T4 (after the OKT4 monoclonal antibody that reacted with it) before being named CD4 in 1984. In humans, the CD4 protein is encoded by the CD4 gene. CD4+ T helper cells are white blood cells that are an essential part of the human immune system. They are often referred to as CD4 cells, T-helper cells or T4 cells. They are called helper cells because one of their main roles is to send signals to other types of immune cells, including CD8 killer cells, which then destroy the infectious particle. If CD4 cells become depleted, for example in untreated HIV infection, or following immune suppression prior to a transplant, the body is left vulnerable to a wide range of infections that it would otherwise have been able to fight.  Structure  receptor. Like many cell surface receptors/markers, CD4 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It has four immunoglobulin domains (D1 to D4) that are exposed on the extracellular surface of the cell: * D1 and D3 resemble immunoglobulin variable (IgV) domains. * D2 and D4 resemble immunoglobulin constant (IgC) domains. The immunoglobulin variable (IgV) domain of D1 adopts an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich fold with seven β-strands in 2 β-sheets, in a Greek key topology. CD4 interacts with the β2-domain of MHC class II molecules through its D1 domain. T cells displaying CD4 molecules (and not CD8) on their surface, therefore, are specific for antigens presented by MHC II and not by MHC class I (they are MHC class II-restricted). MHC class I contains Beta-2 microglobulin. The short cytoplasmic/intracellular tail (C) of CD4 contains a special sequence of amino acids that allow it to recruit and interact with the tyrosine kinase Lck.  Function  CD4 is a co-receptor of the T cell receptor (TCR) and assists the latter in communicating with antigen-presenting cells. The TCR complex and CD4 bind to distinct regions of the antigen- presenting MHC class II molecule. The extracellular D1 domain of CD4 binds to the β2 region of MHC class II. The resulting close proximity between the TCR complex and CD4 allows the tyrosine kinase Lck bound to the cytoplasmic tail of CD4 to phosphorylate tyrosine residues of immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs (ITAMs) on the cytoplasmic domains of CD3 to amplify the signal generated by the TCR. Phosphorylated ITAMs on CD3 recruit and activate SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine kinases (PTK), such as ZAP70, to further mediate downstream signalling through tyrosine phosphorylation. These signals lead to the activation of transcription factors, including NF-κB, NFAT, AP-1, to promote T cell activation.  Other interactions  CD4 has also been shown to interact with SPG21, and Uncoordinated-119 (Unc-119).  Disease = HIV infection  HIV-1 uses CD4 to gain entry into host T-cells and achieves this through its viral envelope protein known as gp120. The binding to CD4 creates a shift in the conformation of gp120 allowing HIV-1 to bind to a co-receptor expressed on the host cell. These co-receptors are chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4. Following a structural change in another viral protein (gp41), HIV inserts a fusion peptide into the host cell that allows the outer membrane of the virus to fuse with the cell membrane.  HIV pathology  HIV infection leads to a progressive reduction in the number of T cells expressing CD4. Medical professionals refer to the CD4 count to decide when to begin treatment during HIV infection, although recent medical guidelines have changed to recommend treatment at all CD4 counts as soon as HIV is diagnosed. A CD4 count measures the number of T cells expressing CD4. While CD4 counts are not a direct HIV test—e.g. they do not check the presence of viral DNA, or specific antibodies against HIV—they are used to assess the immune system of a patient. National Institutes of Health guidelines recommend treatment of any HIV-positive individuals, regardless of CD4 count Normal blood values are usually expressed as the number of cells per microliter (μL, or equivalently, cubic millimeter, mm3) of blood, with normal values for CD4 cells being 500–1200 cells/mm3. Patients often undergo treatments when the CD4 counts reach a level of 350 cells per microliter in Europe but usually around 500/μL in the US; people with less than 200 cells per microliter are at high risk of contracting AIDS defined illnesses. Medical professionals also refer to CD4 tests to determine efficacy of treatment. Viral load testing provides more information about the efficacy for therapy than CD4 counts. For the first 2 years of HIV therapy, CD4 counts may be done every 3–6 months. If a patient's viral load becomes undetectable after 2 years then CD4 counts might not be needed if they are consistently above 500/mm3. If the count remains at 300–500/mm3, then the tests can be done annually. It is not necessary to schedule CD4 counts with viral load tests and the two should be done independently when each is indicated. Reference ranges for blood tests of white blood cells, comparing CD4+ cell amount (shown in green-yellow) with other cells.  Other diseases  CD4 continues to be expressed in most neoplasms derived from T helper cells. It is therefore possible to use CD4 immunohistochemistry on tissue biopsy samples to identify most forms of peripheral T cell lymphoma and related malignant conditions. The antigen has also been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases such as vitiligo and type I diabetes mellitus. T-cells play a large part in autoinflammatory diseases. When testing a drug's efficacy or studying diseases, it is helpful to quantify the amount of T-cells on fresh-frozen tissue with CD4+, CD8+, and CD3+ T-cell markers (which stain different markers on a T-cell - giving different results).

It is situated on a hill above the river Elbe, adjacent to the Meissen Cathedral. History In 929 King Henry I of Germany subdued the Slavic Glomacze tribe at the Siege of Gana and built a fortress within their settlement area, situated on a rock high above the Elbe river. This castle, called Misnia after a nearby creek, became the nucleus of the town and from 965 the residence of the Margraves of Meissen, who in 1423 acquired the Electorate of Saxony. From 1464, Elector Ernest of Saxony ruled jointly with his younger brother Albert the Bold and both had the present-day castle built on 1471. The work of court builder Arnold of Westphalia was constructed solely as a residence, not as a military fortress (the first German castle built for such a purpose). When the brothers divided the Wettin lands by the 1485 Treaty of Leipzig, the castle of Meissen was given to Albert. Though Albert's son Duke George the Bearded resided at the Albrechtsburg, it was soon superseded by Dresden Castle as the new seat of the Wettin Albertinian line. In 1710 King Augustus II the Strong established the Royal-Polish and Electoral-Saxon Porcelain Manufactory (Königlich- Polnische und Kurfürstlich-Sächsische Porzellan- Manufaktur),http://www.starcookers.com/magazin/orte-zum-geniessen/meissner- porzellan/ which was the first European hard-paste porcelain manufacture, at the castle under the supervision of Johann Friedrich Böttger. Meissen porcelain was produced at the Albrechtsburg until manufacturing moved to its present location in 1863.

This group consists of three methyl groups bonded to a silicon atom [−Si(CH3)3], which is in turn bonded to the rest of a molecule. This structural group is characterized by chemical inertness and a large molecular volume, which makes it useful in a number of applications. A trimethylsilyl group bonded to a methyl group forms tetramethylsilane, which is abbreviated as TMS as well. Compounds with trimethylsilyl groups are not normally found in nature. Chemists sometimes use a trimethylsilylating reagent to derivatize rather non-volatile compounds such as certain alcohols, phenols, or carboxylic acids by substituting a trimethylsilyl group for a hydrogen in the hydroxyl groups on the compounds. This way trimethylsiloxy groups [−O-Si(CH3)3] are formed on the molecule. A couple of examples of trimethylsilylating agents include trimethylsilyl chloride and bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide. Trimethylsilyl groups on a molecule have a tendency to make it more volatile, often making the compounds more amenable to analysis by gas chromatography or mass spectrometry. An example of such trimethylsilylation is mentioned in the Brassicasterol article. Such derivatizations are often done on a small scale in special vials. When attached to certain functional groups in a reactant molecule, trimethylsilyl groups may also be used as temporary protecting groups during chemical synthesis or some other chemical reactions. In chromatography, derivitization of accessible silanol groups in a bonded stationary phase with trimethylsilyl groups is referred to as endcapping. In an NMR spectrum, signals from atoms in trimethylsilyl groups in compounds will commonly have chemical shifts close to the tetramethylsilane reference peak at 0 ppm. Also compounds, such as high temperature silicone \\"stopcock\\" grease, which have polysiloxanes (often called silicones) in them will commonly show peaks from their methyl groups (attached to the silicon atoms) having NMR chemical shifts close to the tetramethylsilane standard peak, such as at 0.07 ppm in CDCl3.Gottlieb, H. E.; Kotlyar, V.; Nudelman, A. NMR Chemical Shifts of Common Laboratory Solvents as Trace Impurities. J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62(21), pp 7512-7515.

With a van der Waals volume of up to 7 cubic angstrom it surpasses the related TIPS group (around 2) \\"Super Silyl\\" Group for Diastereoselective Sequential Reactions: Access to Complex Chiral Architecture in One Pot Matthew B.

He spent much of his career on the faculty of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, serving as its executive vice-dean from 1995 to 2002. He was the 15th Director of the National Institutes of Health from 2002 to 2008, under the George W. Bush administration. In 2009, under the Obama administration he served as one of the country's first presidential science envoys to foster scientific and technologic collaboration with other nations. He also served as a senior fellow for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation from 2009 through 2010. From 2011 until his retirement in April 2018, he was the President for Global Research and Development at the pharmaceutical company Sanofi. Background A resident of Pasadena, Maryland, Zerhouni was born in Nedroma, Algeria. Having earned his M.D. degree at the University of Algiers, School of Medicine in 1975, Zerhouni emigrated to the United States to take up a residency position in diagnostic radiology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. He went on to positions of increasing responsibility, including Chief Resident and Assistant professor. He then served as vice chair of the Department of Radiology at Eastern Virginia Medical School and its affiliated DePaul Hospital from 1981 to 1985. In 1985, Zerhouni returned to Johns Hopkins as an associate professor. He was appointed Director of the MRI Division in 1988, subsequently becoming chair of the Russell H. Morgan Department of Radiology and Radiological Science, Martin Donner Professor of Radiology and Professor of Biomedical Engineering. Ultimately, Zerhouni was appointed as Executive Vice-Dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1996 and served as Dean of Research and Dean for Clinical Affairs until 2002 at which time he moved to the Directorship of the NIH. Zerhouni is a highly published scientist in his field, inventor, and entrepreneur. His work led to advances in Computed Tomography (CAT scanning) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that resulted in over 200 peer reviewed publications and 8 patents. Partly based on this research and research and subsequent inventions, Zerhouni founded or co- founded five start-up companies. He founded Computerized Imaging Reference Systems (CIRS) in 1982, where he served as Chairman for several years. He founded Advanced Medical Imaging in 1989, which was later sold to a major public company. He is a co-inventor and co-founder of Biopsys Corporation which became public before being acquired J&J; in 1997. He co-founded American Radiology Services in 1996 and served as its Chairman and CEO until 2002. He is also a co-inventor and co-founder of Surgivision, Inc., an MRI image-guided surgery company. National Institutes of Health (2002–2008) Zerhouni was appointed Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by President George W. Bush. Confirmed by the Senate in April 2002, he served until October 2008. As director, Zerhouni convened a series of meetings to chart a \\"Roadmap for Medical Research\\" in the 21st century to identify opportunities and gaps in biomedical research. Zerhouni also created the Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization Process (RCDC), an online system which reports NIH research investments visible to the public. During Zerhouni's tenure, the NIH Reform Act of 2006 was enacted by Congress. The Act codified the NIH Common Fund and new governance mechanisms for the agency, and codified a new NIH division, the Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI), to administrate the Common Fund. During his tenure at NIH, Zerhouni created the Neuroscience Blueprint, and revised the NIH peer review system. He currently sits on the Board of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health. Scientific adviser In 2009, under the Obama administration, he served as one of the country's first presidential science envoys to foster scientific and technologic collaboration with other nations. He also served as a senior fellow for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation from 2009 through 2010. Zerhouni has served as a science advisor reviewing several national research programs for France, Canada, Australia, Qatar, among others. In 2008, he was asked by the French minister of Health and the French Minister of Research and Higher Education to lead a Committee that led to the creation of the AVIESAN in 2009. President, Global R&D; of Sanofi Sanofi, a global pharmaceutical company, named Dr. Zerhouni as the Global Head of Research and Development in 2011. He retired from Sanofi in June 2018. Awards and international recognition Zerhouni has advised many world leaders and has won various awards. In 1985, he was a consultant to the White House under President Ronald Reagan.

Also known as benzyl chlorocarbonate it is an oily colorless liquid although impure samples appear yellow. It is also known for its pungent odor. In contact with water it degrades.  Preparation  It is prepared in the lab by treating benzyl alcohol with phosgene. Phosgene is used in excess to minimise the production of the carbonate.  Amine protection  The “carboxybenzyl group” (Cbz, benzyloxycarbonyl) is commonly used in organic synthesis for the introduction of the carboxybenzyl (abbreviated Cbz or Z) protecting group for amines. It is a key protecting group for amines, suppressing its nucleophilic and basic properties. :600px Alternatively, as in the Curtius rearrangement, carboxybenzyl can be generated by the reaction of an isocyanate with benzyl alcohol. Common amine protection procedures include: * Benzyl chloroformate and a base, such as sodium carbonate in water at 0 °C * Benzyl chloroformate and magnesium oxide in ethyl acetate at 70 °C to reflux *:573x573px * Benzyl chloroformate, DIPEA, acetonitrile and scandium trifluoromethanesulfonate (Sc(OTf)3) *:442x442px The method was first used by Max Bergmann and Leonidas Zervas in 1932 for the synthesis of peptides.

Nichols, 414 U.S. 563 (1974), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court unanimously decided that the lack of supplemental language instruction in public school for students with limited English proficiency violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The court held that since non-English speakers were denied a meaningful education, the disparate impact caused by the school policy violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the school district was demanded to provide students with \\"appropriate relief\\"..  Background  In 1971, the San Francisco school system desegregated based on the result of Supreme Court case Lee v. Johnson. 2856 Chinese students, who were not fluent in English, were integrated back into the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD). Only about 1000 of those students were provided supplemental English instruction. Of the other 1800-plus Chinese students who weren't fluent in English, many were placed in special education classes while some were forced to be in the same grade for years. Even though the Bilingual Education Act was passed by Congress in 1968 to address the needs of Limited English Speaking Abilities students, the funding was limited. School participation in those programs was also voluntary, and by 1972, \\"only 100,391 students nationally, out of approximately 5,000,000 in need were enrolled in a Title VII-funded program.\\" Edward H. Steinman, a public-interest lawyer, reached out to the parents of Kinney Kinmon Lau and other Chinese students with limited English proficiency. He encouraged them to challenge the school district, and they filed a class action suit against Alan H. Nichols, the president of the SFUSD at the time, and other officials in the school district. The students claimed that they were not receiving special help in school due to their inability to speak English, and they argued they were entitled to special help under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because of equal protection and the ban on educational discrimination. The District Court for the Northern District of California denied the relief and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the decision. The District Court argued that since a uniform policy was used for all students in SFUSD and that the district didn't intentionally discriminate against students with limited English proficiency, equal protection was provided and the Fourteenth Amendment was not violated. The Court of Appeals claimed that since the school district provided the same treatment for all students, even though some students were disadvantaged due to their limited fluency in English, the school district was not required to make up for the different starting points of students. The students appealed the Court of Appeal's decision to the Supreme Court.  Decision of the Supreme Court  Justice Harry Blackmun, who concurred with the decision and stated that the number of students affected in this case was substantial enough to deem affirmative remedies necessary. The Supreme Court issued its decision on January 21, 1974, with the Court unanimously ruling in favor of Lau. Instead of examining the equal protection clause from the 14th Amendment, the Court relied on Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Since the school system received federal funding, it was required to provide equal opportunities and access to all students. The Court claimed that even though the school districts provided equal treatment for all students, it still imposed disparate impact on the non-English speaking students since they were not able to understand the class material as effectively as other students and therefore were deprived of having \\"meaningful\\" education. The Court also referenced the guideline established by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in 1970, which stated that language could be used as a proxy of discrimination on national origin and that \\"the district must take affirmative steps to rectify the language deficiency in order to open its instructional program to these students.\\" The Supreme Court demanded the school district to make necessary changes to provide equal education to the non-English speakers, but it didn't state any specific remedies for the district to follow. Justice Potter Stewart, joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justice Blackmun, concurred with this decision as he stated that affirmative remedial efforts, suggested by the OCR, were constitutional and appropriate in this case as long as the efforts were \\"reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation.\\" In his concurrence joined by Chief Justice Burger, Justice Blackmun also suggested that \\"numbers are at the heart of this case\\" and that if the case only involved a few students, rather than nearly 2,000, the decision would not be the same.  Legacy  Lau remains an important decision in bilingual education history. In this case, the Supreme Court found the violation of Civil Rights Act of 1964 based on the discriminatory effect of the school policy regardless of the intent of the officials. It prohibited the \\"sink and swim\\" policy and set a precedent of finding disparate impact in violation of the Civil Rights Act. The decision was subsequently followed by the passing of Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 in Congress, which specifically prohibited discrimination against faculty and student in public schools and required the school districts to take \\"appropriate action\\" to overcome the barriers to equal participation of all students. It increased funding to the Bilingual Education Act and made additional English instruction mandatory, which effectively extended the Lau ruling to all public schools. The Officer for Civil Rights then developed a remedial guideline in 1975, otherwise known as the Lau Remedies, that specified methods and approaches for the school districts to follow in order to provide a meaningful education to students with limited English proficiency. This led to the development of bilingual programs and additional English instructions in most public schools.United States. Health, Education and Welfare Department. Task Force Findings Specifying Remedies Available for Eliminating past Educational Practices Ruled Unlawful under LAU v. NICHOLS. N.p.: n.p., 1975. Print. However, there have been challenges to the Lau decision in recent decades. In the Supreme Court case Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001), the Court claimed that private plaintiffs did not have the right of action to sue against disparate impact violation under Title VI and they must provide proofs of intentional discrimination. It implied that students can no longer sue schools for policies that cause disparate impact, which significantly weakened the foundation of the Lau decision.

Siamese Crocodile-Biblical Zoo Distribution and habitat Siamese crocodiles occur in a wide range of freshwater habitats, including slow-moving rivers and streams, lakes, seasonal oxbow lakes, marshes and swamplands. Biology and behaviour Siamese crocodile sleeping with its mouth open to release heat Despite conservation concerns, many aspects of C. siamensis life history in the wild remain unknown, particularly regarding its reproductive biology. Adults feed mainly on fish and snakes, but also eat amphibians and small mammals. Very little is known about the natural history of this species in the wild, but females build mound-nests constructed from scraped-up plant debris mixed with mud. In captivity, these crocodiles breed during the wet season (April to May), laying between 15 and 50 eggs, which are then guarded until they hatch. After incubation, the female will assist her young as they break out of their eggs and then carry the hatchlings to the water in her jaws. Pure, unhybridised examples of this species are generally unaggressive towards humans,Cox, M.J. van Dijk, P.P, Nabhitabhata, J and Thirakhupt, K.

Charles Darwin University, Northern Territory, Australia. Conservation status and threats This crocodile is classified as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List, and is listed on Appendix I of CITES. It is one of the most endangered crocodiles in the wild, although it is extensively bred in captivity. Threats Siamese crocodiles are under threat from human disturbance and habitat occupation, which is forcing remaining populations to the edges of their former range. Extinct from 99% of its original range, the Siamese crocodile is considered one of the least studied and most critically endangered crocodilians in the world. Although few wild populations remain, more than 700,000 C. Siamese are held on commercial crocodile farms in Southeast Asia. In 1992, it was believed to be extremely close to or fully extinct in the wild until 2000 when scientists from Fauna and Flora International and the Government of Cambodia's Forestry Administration confirmed the presence of Siamese crocodiles in the Cardamom Mountains in Southwest Cambodia. Since then, surveys have identified around 30 sites in Cambodia that contain wild Siamese crocodiles (conservatively estimated to number between 200 and 400 individuals in total), a tiny population in Thailand (possibly as few as two individuals, discounting recent reintroductions), a small population in Vietnam (possibly fewer than 100 individuals), Cat Tien National Park has about 200, and a more sizeable population in Laos. In March 2005, conservationists found a nest containing juvenile Siamese crocodiles in the southern Lao province of Savannakhet. There are no recent records from Malaysia, Burma or Brunei. A small but important population of the crocodiles is also known to live in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. =Habitat degradation= Factors causing loss of habitat include: conversion of wetlands for agriculture, chemical fertilisers use, use of pesticides in rice production, and an increase in the population of cattle. The effects of warfare stemming from the conflicts in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia during the Vietnam War (from land mines to aerial bombardment) have also been factored. Many river systems, including those in protected areas, have hydroelectric power dams approved or proposed, which are likely to cause the loss of about half of the remaining breeding colonies within the next ten years. One cause for habitat degradation via hydrological changes, for the Siamese crocodile, is the implementation of dams on the upper Mekong River and its major tributaries. Potential impacts of dam construction include wetland loss and altered flooding cycle with a dry season flow 50% greater than under natural conditions. =Exploitation and fragmentation= Siamese crocodile farm on Tonle Sap in Cambodia Illegal capture of wild crocodiles for supply to farms is an ongoing threat, as well as incidental capture/drowning in fishing nets and traps. C. siamensis currently has extremely low and fragmented remaining populations with little proven reproduction in the wild. Siamese crocodiles have historically been captured for skins and to stock commercial crocodile farms. In 1945, skin hunting for commercial farms was banned by the French colonial administration of Cambodia. In the late 1940s, populations spurred the development of farms and harvesting wild crocodiles for stocking these farms. Protection was abolished by the Khmer Rouge (1975–79) but later reinstated under Article 18 of the Fishery Law of 1987, which \\"forbids the catching, selling, and transportation of...[wild] crocodiles...\\" Crocodile farming now has a huge economic impact in the provinces surrounding Tonle Sap, where 396 farms held over 20,000 crocodiles in 1998. Also, many crocodiles were exported from Cambodia since the mid-1980s to stock commercial farms in Thailand, Vietnam, and China. Despite legal protection, a profitable market exists for the capture and sale of crocodiles to farms since the early 1980s. This chronic overharvesting has led to the decline of the wild Siamese crocodile. Conservation and management Fossils, formerly referred to as Crocodylus ossifragus The current situation of C. siamensis represents a significant improvement from the status reported in the 1992 Action Plan (effectively extinct in the wild), but poses major new challenges for quantitative survey and effective conservation action if the species is to survive. While the species remains critically endangered, there is a sufficient residual wild population, albeit severely fragmented across several areas and countries, to provide a basis for recovery. The Siamese crocodile is relatively unthreatening to people (compared to C. porosus), and the possibility of people and crocodiles coexisting in natural settings seems possible. The powerful economic force of the commercial industry based on C. siamensis also needs to be mobilised and channelled for conservation advantage. Considerable effort and action is still required, but the species has a reasonable chance of survival if the necessary actions can be implemented. Yayasan Ulin (The Ironwood Foundation) is running a small project to conserve an important wetland habitat in the area of East Kalimantan which is known to contain the crocodiles. Most of them, though, live in Cambodia, where isolated, small groups are present in several remote areas of the Cardamom Mountains, in the southwest of the country, and also in the Virachey National Park, in the northeast of the country. In Cambodia Fauna and Flora International and the Government of Cambodia's Forestry Administration have established the Cambodian Crocodile Conservation Programme for the protection and recovery of Siamese crocodiles. This programme works with a network of indigenous villages who are helping to protect key sites such as Veal Veng Marsh (Veal Veng District), the Tatai River (Thmar Bang District) and the Araeng River. The latter is considered to have the second largest population of Siamese crocodiles in the world, but is currently threatened by the proposed construction of a massive dam in the river. During the heavy monsoon period of June–November, Siamese crocodiles take advantage of the increase in water levels to move out of the river and onto large lakes and other local bodies of water, returning to their original habitat once water levels start receding back to their usual levels. The Cambodian Crocodile Conservation Programme conducted DNA analysis of 69 crocodiles in Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Centre in Cambodia 2009, and found 35 of them were purebred C. siamensis. Conservationists from the Forestry Administration and Fauna and Flora International subsequently launched a conservation breeding program at the Centre. Since 2012, approximately 50 purebred Cambodian Siamese crocodiles have been released into community-protected areas to reinforce the depleted wild populations. Poaching is a severe threat to this species, with the value of wild Siamese crocodiles reaching hundreds of dollars in the black market, where they are illegally taken into crocodile farms and hybridized with other, larger species.Endangered crocodiles hatched in Cambodia. The Associated Press via cbc.ca (June 10, 2010) The total wild population is unknown, since most groups are in isolated areas where access is extremely complicated. A number of captively held individuals are the result of hybridization with the saltwater crocodile, but several thousand \\"pure\\" individuals do exist in captivity, and are regularly bred at crocodile farms, especially in Thailand. Pang Sida National Park in Thailand, near Cambodia, has a project to reintroduce Siamese crocodile into the wild. A number of young crocodiles have been released into a small and remote river in the park, not accessible to visitors. The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) is working with the government of Laos on a new programme to save this critically endangered crocodile and its wetland habitat. In August, 2011, a press release announced the successful hatching of a clutch of 20 Siamese crocodiles. These eggs were then incubated at the Laos Zoo. This project represents a new effort by WCS to conserve the biodiversity and habitat of Laos’ Savannakhet Province, promotes conservation of biodiversity for the whole landscape, and relies on community involvement from local residents. =Priority projects= High priority projects include: *Status surveys and development of crocodile management and conservation programmes in Cambodia and Laos: These two countries appear to be the remaining stronghold of the species. Identifying key areas and populations, and obtaining quantitative estimates of population size as a precursor to initiating conservation programs is needed. *Implementation of protection of habitat and restocking in Thailand: Thailand has the best- organized protected-areas system, the largest source of farm-raised crocodiles for restocking, and the most-developed crocodile management programme in the region. Although the species has virtually disappeared from the wild, re- establishment of viable populations in protected areas is feasible. *Protection of crocodile populations in Vietnam: a combination of habitat protection and captive breeding could prevent loss of the species in Vietnam. A breeding population has been successfully re-established in Cát Tiên National Park. Further surveys, identification of suitable localities and the implementation of a conservation programme coordinated with the captive breeding efforts of Vietnamese institutions is needed. *Investigation of the taxonomy of the freshwater crocodiles in Southeast Asia and the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago: The relationships among the freshwater crocodiles in the Indo- Malaysian Archipelago are poorly understood. Clarification of these relationships is of scientific interest and has important implications for conservation. Other projects include: *Coordination of captive breeding, trade and conservation in the South east Asian region: Several countries in the region are already deeply involved in captive breeding programs for commercial use. Integration of this activity with necessary conservation actions for the wild populations (including funding surveys and conservation) could be a powerful force for conservation. A long term aim could be the re-establishment of viable wild populations and their sustainable use by ranching. *Maintain a stock of pure C. siamensis in crocodile farms: The bulk of the captives worldwide are maintained in several farms in Thailand where extensive interbreeding with C. porosus has taken place. Hybrids are preferred for their superior commercial qualities, but the hybridisation threatens the genetic integrity of the most threatened species of crocodilians. Farms should be encouraged to segregate genetically pure Siamese crocodiles for conservation, in addition to the hybrids they are promoting for hide production. *Survey and protection of Siamese crocodiles in Indonesia: Verification of the presence of C. siamensis in Kalimantan and Java is a first step to developing protection for the species within the context of the developing crocodile management strategy in Indonesia.

His grandfather, William Rothery, was a clergyman. His campaigning grandmother, Mary Hume-Rothery, was the daughter of Joseph Hume, a Scottish doctor and Radical Member of parliament. William spent his youth in Cheltenham and was educated at Cheltenham College. In 1917 he was made totally deaf by a virus infection. Nevertheless, he entered Magdalen College, Oxford, and obtained a first class Honours degree in chemistry. He also attended the Royal School of Mines and was awarded a PhD. Career During World War II, he supervised numerous government contracts for work on aluminium and magnesium alloys. After the war he returned to Oxford \\"to carry on research in intermetallic compounds and problems on the borderland of metallography and chemistry\\" and remained there for the rest of his working life. In 1938 he was appointed lecturer in metallurgical chemistry. In his research, he concluded that the microstructure of an alloy depends on the sizes of the component atoms, as well as the valency electron concentration, and electrochemical differences. This led to the definition of the Hume-Rothery rules. In the 1950s he founded the Department of Metallurgy (which is now the Department of Materials) at the University of Oxford, and was a fellow of St Edmund Hall, Oxford. He was also involved in founding the Journal of the Less-Common Metals, which developed out of an international symposium on metals and alloys above 1200°C which he organized at Oxford University on September 17-18, 1958. The papers presented at the symposium \\"The study of metals and alloys above 1200°C\\" were published as Volume 1 of the Journal of the Less-Common Metals. He was a member of the Oxford Philatelic Society. William Hume-Rothery Award The William Hume-Rothery Award has since 1974 been awarded annually by The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society. Honours and awards *Hume-Rothery was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May, 1937 *Awarded the Francis J. Clamer Medal in 1949.

He moved to the United States in 1941 with his brother Jack Soble, and was arrested in 1960 as a Soviet spy. Convicted and sentenced to life in prison, he fled the U.S. while on bail and sought asylum first in Israel, then in Britain. He committed suicide by overdosing on barbiturates when his last appeal for asylum in Britain was denied. Pre-trial career in Europe and the United States Born in Vilkaviskis, Lithuania, both Soblen and his younger brother Jack (born Abromas Sobolevicius, also known as Abraham or Adolph Senin), were important figures in Trotskyist circles in the 1920s and 1930s. They were very active in French and German Trotskyist movements, handling both Trotsky's secret correspondence to the Soviet Union and publication of his Opposition Bulletin.Deutscher, 20 Jack Soble later claimed he and Robert began working for the Soviet Secret Police against Trotsky in 1931.Deutscher (ibid.) doubts that the Sobolevicius brothers were Soviet agents this early. On the other hand, Hans Schafranek suggests that \\"Roman Well\\" (Ruvelis) may have begun working for the Soviet government against Trotsky as early as 1927. In 1932, Trotsky broke with the brothers, and Robert joined Trotsky's enemies in the Communist Party of Germany.Haynes and Klehr, Early Cold War 209. Soblen, Soble, and many members of their family moved to the United States in 1941. According to Jack Soble's testimony during Robert's trial, they were personally granted permission for the move by NKVD director Lavrenty Beria, on condition that they assist in Soviet espionage activities in the United States.Anderson, NY Times. After arriving in the United States, Soblen set up a psychiatric practice in New York. According to testimony at his trial, Soblen's activities also included spying on the Trotskyist movement in the United States, and transmitting stolen intelligence documents and military information to the Soviet Union.Haynes and Klehr, Early Cold War 225. Soble and Soblen Trials Soblen's brother Jack was arrested in 1957 and charged with espionage, primarily based on the testimony of Hollywood producer Boris Morros. Morros first worked with Soble's organization providing business cover for Soviet agents, but later agreed to act as a double agent for the FBI. Soble pleaded guilty to the espionage charges, made a detailed statement of his activities, and was sentenced to seven years in prison.Haynes and Klehr, Early Cold War 222 Robert Soblen was not indicted until 1960. He was charged with providing the Soviet Union with secret OSS documents in World War II and photographs of a U.S. nuclear testing site in 1950. Soblen pleaded not guilty. His trial, at which Jack was a primary witness, ended with his conviction. The judge deferred sentencing until August, and stated that the severity of the sentence would depend on whether Soblen was willing to provide a full account of his espionage to the government. Soblen remained defiant and refused to cooperate, and on 7 August 1961, was sentenced to life imprisonment. Soblen, suffering from leukemia, was released on $100,000 bail pending an appeal. His conviction was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals in March 1962, and an appeal to the Supreme Court was rejected in June 1962. Soblen was ordered to report to prison to begin his sentence on June 28, 1962.Haynes and Klehr, Early Cold War 226-7 Asylum attempts Following the rejection of his last appeal, Soblen jumped bail and flew to Israel, using a forged Canadian passport. Once there, he immediately hired legal assistance and claimed Israeli citizenship as a Jew under the Law of Return, and claimed immunity from extradition as an Israeli citizen. He was arrested in his hotel room shortly after his arrival, and the Israeli government declared that the Law of Return was not an open invitation for Jewish criminals to immigrate to Israel. Soblen was denied citizenship, and his appeals were rejected. Although Israel and the United States did not have an extradition agreement at the time, Soblen faced expulsion from Israel and deportation to the United States on charges of illegal entry, due to his having used a false passport to enter the country. Soblen was deported from Israel on a flight to the United States on July 1. During a stopover in London, Soblen slashed his wrist and abdomen with a dinner knife. He was removed from the airplane and hospitalized. He then hired lawyers and filed a claim for political asylum, or the right to go to any country other than the United States. He also admitted that his actions had not been a suicide attempt, but were rather a ruse to gain admittance to Britain. After Soblen underwent a medical examination in a prison hospital, doctors determined that his leukemia was dormant, that he did not face imminent death from the disease, and that he had a life expectancy of several years rather than several months. British courts denied a series of appeals, and in September 1962, ordered him deported back to the United States. On the day of his deportation, Soblen took an overdose of barbiturates. It is unclear whether this was a legitimate suicide attempt or another attempt to delay deportation. He fell unconscious while being escorted to the airport, and was taken to a hospital. He never regained consciousness, and died on September 11, 1962.Haynes and Klehr, Early Cold War 227.Entered Israel on Canadian Passport with Commie Help - The Rome News Tribune. Aftermath The Soble/Soblen trials revealed a great deal about Soviet espionage directed against Trotsky and his followers. They also revealed a number of aspects of Soviet espionage against the United States in the 1940s and 1950s, and were one of the more successful espionage prosecutions in the early Cold War period. The extent to which the Venona decryption project assisted in the case is not clear. The project was never mentioned during either of the brothers' trials, but according to Klehr and Haynes, a number of cables deciphered by the Venona project mention Soblen under the covername ROMAN, the pseudonym he used in Germany.Haynes and Klehr, Venona 252 Soblen's expulsion from Israel was controversial enough to provoke a no-confidence vote against David Ben- Gurion's government. The vote failed, but the controversy may have contributed to the passing of Israel's \\"Offenses Committed Abroad Act\\" in 1978, which sharply restricted the circumstances under which Israeli citizens could be extradited.Abramovsky and Edelstein, 305 Soblen's asylum request in England also generated controversy and calls for reform.See Thornberry (1963) for a summary.

The postmodern stories are extremely self-conscious and self- reflexive and are considered to exemplify metafiction. Though Barth's reputation rests mainly on his long novels, the stories \\"Night-Sea Journey\\", \\"Lost in the Funhouse\\", \\"Title\\" and \\"Life-Story\\" from Lost in the Funhouse are widely anthologized. The book appeared the year after the publication of Barth's essay The Literature of Exhaustion, in which Barth said that the traditional modes of realistic fiction had been used up, but that this exhaustion itself could be used to inspire a new generation of writers, citing Nabokov, Beckett, and especially Borges as exemplars of this new approach. Lost in the Funhouse took these ideas to an extreme, for which it was both praised and condemned by critics. Overview Each story can be considered complete in itself, and in fact several of them were published separately before being collected. Barth insists, however, on the serial nature of the stories, and that a unity can be found in them as collected. Barth shows his pessimism in the stories, and says he identifies with \\"Anonymiad\\". Background When Barth began attending Johns Hopkins University in 1947, he enrolled in one of only two creative writing courses available in the US at the time. He went on to become one of the first full-time professors of creative writing. The stories in Lost in the Funhouse display a professorial concern with fictional form. Lost in the Funhouse was Barth's first book after the 1967 \\"The Literature of Exhaustion\\", an essay in which Barth claimed that the traditional modes of realistic writing had been exhausted and no longer served the contemporary writer, but that the exhaustion of these techniques could be turned into a new source of inspiration. Barth cited a number of contemporary writers, such as Vladimir Nabokov, Samuel Beckett, and especially Jorge Luis Borges, as important examples of this. The essay later came to be seen by some as an early description of postmodernism. Barth has described the stories of Lost in the Funhouse as \\"mainly late modernist\\" and \\"postmodernist\\". Influences Jorge Luis Borges was a primary influence, as acknowledged by Barth a number of times, most notably in \\"The Literature of Exhaustion\\". Beckett was another influence. Publication history Written between 1966 and 1968, several of the stories had already been published separately. Barth has said he has written his books in pairs: the realistic, existential novels, The Floating Opera and The End of the Road, were followed by the long, mythical novels, The Sot-Weed Factor and Giles Goat-Boy. Lost in the Funhouse came out in 1968, and was followed in 1972 by Chimera, a collection of three self-aware, interrelated, metafictional novellas. Stories Lost in the Funhouse opens with a \\"story\\" which can be cut and pasted to form an endless Möbius strip The book opens with \\"Frame-Tale\\", a \\"story\\" in which \\"ONCE UPON A TIME THERE\\" and \\"WAS A STORY THAT BEGAN\\" are printed vertically, one on each side of the page. This is intended to be cut out by the reader, and its ends being fastened together, after being twisted once in a Möbius strip. This results in a regressus ad infinitum, a loop with no beginning or end. \\"Night-Sea Journey\\" follows, the first-person story of a human spermatozoon on its way to fertilize an egg. The tale allegorically recapitulates the story of human life in condensed form. In \\"Petition\\", one half of a pair of Siamese twins, joined at the stomach to his brother's back, writes a petition in 1931 to Prajadhipok, King of Siam (now Thailand), protesting his brother's not acknowledging his existence. In \\"Menalaiad\\", Barth leads the reader in and out of seven metaleptic layers. Menalaus despairs as his story progresses through layer after layer of quotation marks, as one story is framed by another and then another. \\"Autobiography\\", which is \\"meant for monophonic tape and visible but silent author\\",... Three of the stories - \\"Ambrose, His Mark\\"; \\"Water-Message\\"; and the title story, \\"Lost in the Funhouse\\" - concern a young boy named Ambrose and members of his family. The first story is told in first person, leading up to describing how Ambrose received his name. The second is told in third-person, written in a deliberately archaic style. The third is the most metafictional of the three, with a narrator commenting on the story's form and literary devices as it progresses. \\"Life-Story\\" is another metafictional commentary on its own telling. In what is apparently an argument between a couple with problems in their relationship, Barth rejects giving details of names and descriptions, instead just using the words \\"fill in the blank\\". In keeping with the book's subtitle - \\"Fiction for Print, Tape, Live Voice\\" - the \\"Author's Note\\" by Barth indicates the various media through which a number of these stories can be conveyed. In particular, he notes that recorded and/or live voice can be used to convey \\"Night-Sea Journey\\", \\"Glossolalia\\", \\"Echo\\", \\"Autobiography\\", and \\"Title\\". List of stories # \\"Frame-tale\\" # \\"Night-sea Journey\\" # \\"Ambrose His Mark\\" # \\"Autobiography\\" # \\"Water-message\\" # \\"Petition\\" # \\"Lost in the Funhouse\\" # \\"Echo\\" # \\"Two Meditations\\" # \\"Title\\" # \\"Glossolalia\\" # \\"Life- story\\" # \\"Menelaiad\\" # \\"Anonymiad\\" Reception Lost in the Funhouse was nominated for the National Book Award (Barth would win the award for his next book, Chimera, in 1973). Among Barth's detractors, John Gardner wrote in On Moral Fiction that Barth's stories were immoral and fake, as they portrayed life as absurd. Max F. Schulz has said that \\"Barth's mature career as a fabulist begins with Lost in the Funhouse\\", and David Morrell called the story \\"Lost in the Funhouse\\" \\"the most important, progressive, trend-defining American short fiction of its decade\\". Legacy Though Barth's reputation is for his long novels, the stories \\"Night-Sea Journey\\", \\"Lost in the Funhouse\\", \\"Title\\" and \\"Life-Story\\" from Lost in the Funhouse are widely anthologized. Lost in the Funhouse has come to be seen to exemplify metafiction. The story \\"Lost in the Funhouse\\" had an overt influence on David Foster Wallace in the final novella of Girl with Curious Hair, \\"Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way\\". The protagonist takes a creative writing course at a school near Johns Hopkins, taught by a Professor Ambrose, who says he \\"is a character in and the object of the seminal 'Lost in the Funhouse'\\".

Career Nicknamed \\"Mighty Mouse\\" partly because of her small stature (standing barely five feet tall) and partly due to her competitive drive, Tanner had a large impact on Canadian swimming and is considered one of the top performers in the sport. During the 1966 Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica, Tanner won four gold medals and three silvers, becoming the first woman to ever win four golds at a Commonwealth Games and the first person to get seven medals in those games. She won the Lou Marsh Trophy, recognizing her as Canada's best athlete in 1966 — the youngest person to ever receive the award — and was also selected as the country's top athlete overall. The following year at the 1967 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Tanner won two gold and three silver medals, breaking two world records in the process. Tanner arrived at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City as a heavy medal favorite. She won three Olympic medals in Mexico City, including two individual silver medals and one relay bronze. However, the media deemed the lack of gold a disappointment and led Tanner to suffer from depression, retiring from competition after the 1968 Olympics at just 18 years of age. Despite being of Canadian nationality she also won the ASA National British Championships over 110 yards butterfly in 1965.

He is a well known graffiti artist, pioneer of the Mission School art movement, and is also known by his monikers: Twist, Ray Fong, Bernon Vernon, and P.Kin. Life and education McGee graduated from El Camino High School in South San Francisco, California. He later graduated from the San Francisco Art Institute in 1991 with a concentration in painting and printmaking. He was married to the artist Margaret Kilgallen, who died of cancer in 2001. They have a daughter named Asha.  Work  \\"Acclaimed for his work in the street as a graffiti artist and for his painted installations in galleries, museums and art festivals around the world, Barry McGee crafts a visual language that makes itself understood. It is public, addressing social concerns of urban life, and very private, elaborating a unique personal style that focuses on humanity, one painstakingly detailed, fine brush-painted image at a time.\\" Career LACMA parking garage (now torn down) Barry McGee has exhibited, both solo and group, in galleries internationally. McGee was a central figure in the graffiti art scene in San Francisco from the late 80's and into the 90's. As Twist, he became well known nationally by his stylized black and white pictographic flathead screw graffiti 'throw ups'. Later he was part of the Mission School art movement based in the aesthetics of the Mission District of San Francisco. His work is founded on a pessimistic view of the urban experience, which he describes as, \\"urban ills, over-stimulations, frustrations, addictions & trying to maintain a level head under the constant bombardment of advertising\\". He was also an artist in residence at inner-city McClymonds High School in Oakland, California in the early '90s. Although his artistic origins lie in New York subway graffiti he has been included as a member of the street art movement. Installation, Xe Biennale de LyonMcGee's installations consist of simple bold paintings which are influenced by Islamic patterns on tiles, vernacular sign painting, or use caricatures of the destitute. These paintings are clustered together in combination with photographs of other graffiti writers. Older work included layering of shapes, and buff marks, backgrounds of drips painted directly on the gallery wall. He has painted stylized portraits on empty bottles of liquor, flattened spray cans, and wrecked vehicles for art shows. He has collaborated frequently with Amaze, allowing him to paint the exterior and interior of the galleries exhibiting McGee's work. They have also utilized realistic moving mechanical human figures that appear to be tagging gallery walls. The market value of his work rose considerably after 2001 as a result of his being included in the Venice Biennale and other major exhibitions. As a result, much of his San Francisco street art has been scavenged or stolen.\\"The Mission school\\" by Glen Helfand, San Francisco Bay Guardian, October 28, 2002.\\"Twist Thief\\" by Trippe, Fecal Face (website), December 13, 2007. (scroll down) Controversy In 2004, as part of an exhibit at San Francisco's City Hall, McGee spray-painted \\"Smash the State\\" on the walls of Supervisor Matt Gonzalez's office. SFGate wrote: \\"The timing and placement of the artwork are interesting, seeing how City Hall is a registered historical landmark, and you need approval just to hang a bulletin board\\". Gonzalez told the press that he knew his office would be repainted for the next occupant.Lelchuk, I. San Francisco Chronicle on the web, December 10, 2004. McGee was involved in a controversy regarding the Adidas Y1 HUF, a shoe for which he provided the artwork. This gave rise to a protest campaign by some Asian-Americans who claimed that the picture on the shoe's tongue depicts a racist stereotype. McGee responded to the controversy in a March 2006 press release. He stated that the drawing was a portrait of himself as an 8-year-old child.

Biography  He was born in Ludwigsburg, in the Kingdom of Württemberg (since 1871, a part of the German Empire). Since his parents were never married, Van Gennep adopted his Dutch mother's name \\"van Gennep\\". When he was six, he and his mother moved to Lyons, France, where she married a French doctor who moved the family to Savoy. Van Gennep is best known for his work regarding rites of passage ceremonies and his significant works in modern French folklore. He is recognized as the founder of folklore studies in France. He went to Paris to study at the Sorbonne, but was disappointed that the school did not offer the subjects he wanted. So he enrolled at the École des langues orientales to study Arabic and at the École pratique des hautes études for philology, general linguistics, Egyptology, Ancient Arabic, primitive religions, and Islamic culture. This scholarly independence would manifest itself for the remainder of his life. He never held an academic position in France. From 1912 to 1915 he held the Chair of Ethnography at the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland but was expelled for expressing doubts about the neutrality of Switzerland during World War I. There he reorganized the museum and organized the first ethnographic conference (1914). In 1922 he toured the United States. His best-known work is Les rites de passage (The Rites of Passage, 1909) which includes his vision of rites of passage rituals as being divided into three phases: préliminaire 'preliminary',' liminaire 'liminality' (a stage much studied by the anthropologist Victor Turner), and postliminaire 'post- liminality'. His major work in French folklore was Le Manuel de folklore français contemporain (Handbook of Contemporary French Folklore, 1937–1958). He died in 1957 in Bourg-la-Reine, France. Influences *The Rites of Passage was highly influential in the structuring of Joseph Campbell's 1949 text, The Hero with a Thousand Faces, as Campbell divides the journey of the hero into three parts, Departure, Initiation, and Return. * The Rites of Passage influenced anthropologist Victor Turner's research, particularly his 1969 text, The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure.

He is buried in Guillemont Road Cemetery where his headstone bears an inscription composed by his father: HE SAW BEYOND THE FILTH OF BATTLE, AND THOUGHT DEATH A FAIR PRICE TO PAY TO BELONG TO THE COMPANY OF THESE FELLOWS. Stanhope Forbes also sculpted and erected a memorial to his son in their local parish church with the inscription: \\"I will get me out of my COUNTRY & from my KINDRED & from my FATHER'S house unto a LAND that GOD will shew me\\". Forbes died in Newlyn on 2 March 1947 at the age of 89. He was buried in the churchyard of Sancreed Parish Church. Education Educated at Dulwich College, he studied art under John Sparkes who later taught at South Kensington School of Art. His father then worked for the Luxembourg Railway and after a period of poor health Forbes was removed from Dulwich College and studied under private teachers in Brussels. This afforded additional time to draw. After the end of the Franco-Prussian War, the Forbes returned to London. John Sparkes helped influence William Forbes to recognise his son's artistic talent, Stanhope Forbes then attended Lambeth School of Art (now the City & Guilds of London Art School). By 1878 he attended the Royal Academy under Sir Frederic Leighton and Sir John Millais. Fellow students at the academy included Arthur Hacker, Henry Herbert La Thangue and Solomon J. Solomon. He participated in his first exhibition there.Mrs. Lionel Birch. Stanhope A. Forbes, A. R. A., and Elizabeth Stanhope Forbes, A. R. W. S.. Cassell, limited; 1906. pp. 6, 8, 10-12. Forbes returned to Ireland for a few months to visit Dr Andrew Melville, family friend and Queen's College professor. While there the men shared their appreciation of art and Forbes painted landscapes of the Galway area. He also received his first commission for a portrait. Back in London, at the age of 18, he received another commission for a portrait of a doctor's daughter, Florence. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1879.Stanhope Forbes (1857-1947) Irish Art.

He then studied at the private atelier of Léon Bonnat in Clichy, Paris from 1880 to 1882. Henry Herbert La Thangue, who also attended Dulwich College, Lambeth School of Art and the Royal Academy, came to Paris, too, and studied at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux- Arts.

Cassell, limited; 1906. p. 16, 18, 20. In 1881 Forbes and La Thangue went to Cancale, Brittany and painted en plein air, like Jules Bastien-Lepage, which became a technique that Forbes used throughout his career. Of Brittany, Mrs Lionel Birch wrote: > In that most beautiful and interesting portion of France, there seemed to be > found everything that an artist could desire. Inhabited by a race of a > distinct and marked type, wearing still the beautiful national costumes > which had been handed down from bygone ages, and retaining the old language > of their forefathers, each village followed religiously the old traditions > which ordered the fashion of their dress and the conduct of their lives. > Here was a country dear to all who love that which is old and quaint, time- > honoured, and reminiscent of past ages.Mrs. Lionel Birch. Stanhope A. > Forbes, A. R. A., and Elizabeth Stanhope Forbes, A. R. W. S.. Cassell, > limited; 1906. pp. 19-20. A painting made there, A Street in Brittany, was shown and well received at the 1882 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition and sold later that year to the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. During an 1883 trip to Brittany, Forbes stayed at Quimperlé. His Breton Children in an Orchard - Quimperlé, was shown at the 1884 Royal Hibernian Academy. Two other works were made Fair Measures: a shop in Quimperlé and Preparations for the Market, Quimperlé; They were both shown at the Royal Academy in 1884. True to his degree of satisfaction, the Fair Measures painting was well-received and the Market painting was found to be too blue and shadowless. Since blue was the colour of the Breton costumes, Forbes decided that it might be useful to change locations for a broader range of subjects and colours.Mrs. Lionel Birch. Stanhope A. Forbes, A. R. A., and Elizabeth Stanhope Forbes, A. R. W. S.. Cassell, limited; 1906. p. 23. Other artists who were painting in Brittany at the time and who Forbes may have met, were Norman Garstin, Nathaniel Hill, Joseph Malachy Kavanagh and Walter Osborne. Career Ladies at work at the Newlyn Art School under the direction of Mrs Stanhope Forbes, from \\"Every Woman's Encyclopaedia\\", 1910 Having completed his studies in France, Forbes returned to London and showed works he made in Brittany at the 1883 Royal Academy and Royal Hibernian Academy shows. In 1884 he moved to Newlyn in Cornwall, and soon became a leading figure in the growing colony of artists. Of this place, Forbes said: > I had come from France and, wandering down into Cornwall, came one spring > morning along that dusty road by which Newlyn is approached from Penzance. > Little did I think that the cluster of grey-roofed houses which I saw before > me against the hillside would be my home for many years.

Forbes, A. R. A., and Elizabeth Stanhope Forbes, A. R. W. S.. Cassell, limited; 1906. p. 32. The artist colony received national attention with the Royal Academy exhibition of Forbes works in 1885. Henry Tate bought The Health of the Bride, which is now at the Tate Gallery in London. The exhibition of A Fish Sale on a Cornish Beach also brought notoriety to Forbes and the artist colony. He was one of the founders of the New English Art Club (NEAC) in 1886. In 1892 Forbes became an Associate of the Royal Academy. Forbes was the founding chairman and trustee of the Newlyn Art Gallery beginning in 1895. Picture of Stanhope Forbes, ca. 1890 Forbes and his wife founded the Newlyn Art School in 1899. It attracted students such as Ernest and Doris \\"Dod\\" Shaw, Frank Gascoigne Heath and Jill and Geoffrey Garnier. The Newlyn area had experienced an economic downturn as the result of failing fishing, mining and farming industries. The school helped to bring an economic resurgence to the area by encouraging individuals to vacation in the area and study and practise art. His friends included Henry Herbert La Thangue, Blandford Fletcher and Charles E. Hannaford, who had also been a student.Stanhope Forbes. Art Renewal. Retrieved 8 October 2012. In Newlyn, Forbes tutored the landscape watercolourist Mabel Mary Spanton.Who's Who in Art; 3rd ed., 1934 For a 1909 publish date, Forbes illustrated Mary Russell Mitford's Sketches of English Life and Character.Mitford, Mary Russell Sketches of English Life and Character; with sixteen reproductions from the paintings of Stanhope A. Forbes. Edinburgh: T. N. Foulis, 1909. Some of the illustrations were Old Cronies, Bringing Home the Milk, and February Sunshine.Mary Russell Mitford. Sketches of English Life and Character. A. C. McClurg & Co.; 1910. (U.S. edition) In 1910 Forbes was elected a Royal Academician. Forbes became a member of the St Ives Society of Artists in 1928. In 1933 he was made a Senior Royal Academician. Works Young anglers at Hayle (1930) Forbes generally painted genre scenes and landscapes en plein air. After a Day's Work, made in 1907, provides a snapshot of life in a small village in Cornwall. In it a man, covered to protect himself from the rain, leads his horse through the wet streets, which bare the light and reflection from light from inside a house. \\"With superb skill, the soft light is reflected off the rain-soaked road.\\" A girl is held back from crossing the street by her mother until the man and his horse pass by. Beyond his plein air painting, he also made interior scenes and was adept at capturing the \\"warm and charming\\" effects of lighting on a room and the people in it, such as The Lantern, made in 1897. More poignantly, Mrs. Lionel Birch writes of his style and particularly the painting The Health of the Bride: \\"[The painting depicts the] dominant note of his life's message, his sense of sympathetic humanity. These people in their humble little parlour, are real and living. Intolerant of all shams and false sentiment, the painter has made himself one with the people he depicts; he has understood the humour which lies so close to tears.\\"Mrs. Lionel Birch. Stanhope A. Forbes, A. R. A., and Elizabeth Stanhope Forbes, A. R. W. S.. Cassell, limited; 1906. p. 37.

The reaction also occurs for coordinated phosphite ligands, as illustrated by the demethylation of {(C5H5)Co[(CH3O)3P]3}2+ to give {(C5H5)Co[(CH3O)2PO]3}−, which is called the Klaui ligand. Reaction mechanism The mechanism of the Michaelis–Arbuzov reaction The Michaelis–Arbuzov reaction is initiated with the SN2 attack of the nucleophilic phosphorus species (1 - A phosphite) with the electrophilic alkyl halide (2) to give a phosphonium salt as an intermediate (3). These intermediates are occasionally stable enough to be isolated, such as for triaryl phosphites which do not react to form the phosphonate without thermal cleavage of the intermediate (200°C), or cleavage by alcohols or bases. The displaced halide anion then usually reacts via another SN2 reaction on one of the R1 carbons, displacing the oxygen atom to give the desired phosphonate (4) and another alkyl halide (5). This has been supported by the observation that chiral R1 groups experience inversion of configuration at the carbon center attacked by the halide anion. This is what is expected of an SN2 reaction. Evidence also exists for a carbocation based mechanism of dealkylation similar to an SN1 reaction, where the R1 group initially dissociates from the phosphonium salt followed by attack of the anion. Phosphite esters with tertiary alkyl halide groups can undergo the reaction, which would be unexpected if only an SN2 mechanism was operating. Further support for this SN1 type mechanism comes from the use of the Arbuzov reaction in the synthesis of neopentyl halides, a class of compounds that are notoriously unreactive towards SN2 reactions. Based on the principle of microscopic reversibility, the inert nature of the neopentyl halides towards the SN2 reaction indicates that an SN2 reaction is unlikely to be the mechanism for the synthesis of the neopentyl halides in this reaction. Substrates that cannot react through an SN2 pathway or an SN1 pathway generally do not react, which include vinyl and aryl groups. For example, the triaryl phosphites mentioned above generally do not react because they form stable phosphonium salts. Since aryl groups do not undergo SN1 and SN2 type mechanisms, triaryl phosphites lack a low energy pathway for decomposition of the phosphonium salt. An allylic rearrangement mechanism (SN2\`) has also been implicated in allyl and propargyl halides. Stereochemical experiments on cyclic phosphites have revealed the presence of both pentavalent phosphoranes and tetravalent phosphonium intermediates in chemical equilibrium being involved in the dealkylation step of the reaction using 31P NMR. The decomposition of these intermediates is driven primarily by the nucleophilicity of the anion. There exists many instances of the intermediate phosphonium salts being sufficiently stable that they can be isolated when the anion is weakly nucleophilic, such as with tetrafluoroborate or triflate anions.  Scope = Alkyl halide  As a general guideline, the reactivity of the organic halide component can be listed as follows: (from most reactive to least reactive) :RCOX > RCH2X > RR'CHX \\\\gg RR'RCX and :RI > RBr > RCl In general, tertiary alkyl haldies, aryl halides and vinyl halides do not react. There are notable exceptions to this trend, including 1,2-dichloroethene and trityl halides. Some activated aryl halides, often involving heterocycles have been known to undergo the reaction. Iodobenzene and substituted derivatives have been known to undergo the reaction under photolytic conditions. Secondary alkyl halides often do not react well, producing alkenes as side-products. Allyl and propargyl halides are also reactive, but can proceed through an SN2 or an SN2\` mechanism. Reaction with primary alkyl halides and acyl halides generally proceed smoothly. Carbon tetrachloride interestingly enough, only undergoes the reaction a single time with chloroform being inert to the reaction conditions. When a halide atom is found in the ester chain off of the phosphorus atom, isomerization to the corresponding Arbuzov product has been known without addition of an alkyl halide. The Perkow reaction is a competing reaction pathway for α-bromo- and α-chloroketones. Under the reaction conditions a mixture of the Perkow product and the normal Arbuzov product occur, usually favoring the Perkow product by a significant amount. Using higher temperatures during the reaction can lead to favoring of the Arbuzov product. The reaction of α-Iodoketones give only the Arbuzov product. Other methods of producing β-ketophosphonates have been developed. The reaction of trivalent phosphorus compounds with alkyl fluorides is abnormal. One example of this reactivity is shown below. 400x400px  Phosphorus reactant  The general form of the trivalent phosphorus reagent can be considered as follows: ABP-OR with A and B generally being alkyl, alkoxy or aryloxy groups. Electron-withdrawing groups are known to slow down the rate of the reaction, with electron donating groups increasing the rate of the reaction. This is consistent with initial attack of the phosphorus reagent on the alkyl halide as the rate-determining step of the reaction. The reaction proceeds smoothly when the R group is aliphatic. When all of A, B and R are aryl groups, a stable phosphonium salt is formed and the reaction proceeds no further under normal conditions. Heating to higher temperatures in the presence of alcohols has been known to give the isomerization product. Cyclic phosphites generally react to eject the non-cyclic OR group, though for some 5-member rings additional heating is required to afford the final cyclic product. 446x446px Phosphite salts (Ex: R = Na) can also undergo the reaction with precipitation of the corresponding Na-halide salt. Amidophosphites and silyloxyphosphites have been used before to yield amidophosphonates and phosphinic acids. 424x424px An Arbuzov type rearrangement can also occur where the O from an OR group acts as the leaving group in the initial SN2 attack of the phosphorus. This is only known to occur when A and B are Cl. 228x228px Phosphite esters are the least reactive class of reagents used in this reaction. They react to produce phosphonates. They require the most heating for the reaction to occur (120°C - 160°C is common). This high temperature allows for fractional distillation to be employed in the removal of the alkyl halide produced, though excess of the starting alkyl halide can also be used. Solvents are often not used for this reaction, though there is precedent for the improvement of selectivity with its usage. Phosphonites are generally more reactive than phosphite esters. They react to produce phosphinates. Heating is also required for the reaction, but pyrolysis of the ester to an acid is a common side reaction. The poor availability of substituted phosphonites limits the usage of this class of reagent in the Arbuzov reaction. Hydroxy, thiol, carboxylic acid, primary and secondary amine functional groups cannot be used with phosphonites in the reaction as they all react with the phosphonite. Phosphinites are the most reactive class of reagents used in this reaction. They react to produce phosphine oxides. They often require very little heating (45°C) for the reaction to occur and have been known to self-isomerize without the presence of alkyl halides.

In most ICAO member countries, even in otherwise metric countries, this is usually expressed in feet per minute (ft/min); elsewhere, it is commonly expressed in metres per second (m/s). The RoC in an aircraft is indicated with a vertical speed indicator (VSI) or instantaneous vertical speed indicator (IVSI). The temporal rate of decrease in altitude is referred to as the rate of descent (RoD) or sink rate. A negative rate of climb corresponds to a positive rate of descent: RoD = -RoC.  Speed and rate of climb  There are a number of designated airspeeds relating to optimum rates of ascent, the two most important of these are VX and VY. VX is the indicated forward airspeed for best angle of climb. This is the speed at which an aircraft gains the most altitude in a given horizontal , typically used to avoid a collision with an object a short distance away. By contrast, VY is the indicated airspeed for best rate of climb, a rate which allows the aircraft to climb to a specified altitude in the minimum amount of regardless of the horizontal distance required. Except at the aircraft’s ceiling, where they are equal, VX is always lower than VY. Climbing at VX allows pilots to maximize altitude gain per horizontal distance. This occurs at the speed for which the difference between thrust and drag is the greatest (maximum excess thrust). In a jet airplane, this is approximately minimum drag speed, occurring at the bottom of the drag vs. speed curve. Climbing at VY allows pilots to maximize altitude gain per time. This occurs at the speed where the difference between engine power and the power required to overcome the aircraft's drag is greatest (maximum excess power).http://people.clarkson.edu/~pmarzocc/AE429/AE-429-10.pdf Vx increases with altitude and VY decreases with altitude until they converge at the airplane's absolute ceiling, the altitude above which the airplane cannot climb in steady flight. The Cessna 172 is a four-seat aircraft. At maximum weight it has a VY of indicated airspeed providing a rate of climb of 721 ft/min (3.66 m/s). Rate of climb at maximum power for a small aircraft is typically specified in its normal operating procedures but for large jet airliners it is usually mentioned in emergency operating procedures.

Kastner A pyrophone, also known as a \\"fire/explosion organ\\" or \\"fire/explosion calliope\\" is a musical instrument in which notes are sounded by explosions, or similar forms of rapid combustion, rapid heating, or the like, such as burners in cylindrical glass tubes, creating light and sound. It was invented by physicist and musician Georges Frédéric Eugène Kastner (born 1852 in Strasbourg, France - died 1882 in Bonn, Germany), son of composer Jean-Georges Kastner, around 1870. DesignRelated musical instruments The pyrophone is similar to the steam calliope, but the difference is that in the calliope the combustion is external to the resonant cavity, whereas the pyrophone is an internal combustion instrument. The difference initially seems insignificant, but external combustion is what gives the calliope its staccatto. Operating under the constant pressures of an external combustion chamber, the calliope merely directs exhaust (HB# 421.22: internal fipple flutes). By controlling the combustion specific to each resonant chamber, the pyrophone has, for better or worse, a greater range of variables in play when producing tones. In a purely mechanical (non-solenoid) calliope, the resulting pressures of external combustion result in between of trigger pressure. In a mechanical pyrophone, trigger weight per key is related to comparatively lower backpressure of combustible gas. Again, the force of combustion happens in the resonance chamber; rather than controlling the exhaust of an explosion that has already happened in order to produce tones, the pyrophone controls the explosion to produce the tone. Pyrophone history The German composer Wendelin Weißheimer playing a Pyrophone. Pyrophones originated in the 19th century. Byron Higgins, using hydrogen burning within the bottom of an open glass tube,\\"Frederic Kastner obituary\\", Nature Volume 26, 27 July 1882. first pointed out that if flame is placed in a glass tube sound may be produced in 1777 and in 1818 Michael Faraday attributed the tones to very rapid explosions.(November 4, 1882). Scientific American: Supplement, Vol. 14, No. 357, p.5687. New York. . Physicist John Tyndall demonstrated that flame(s) in a tube may be made to sound if they are placed close to one third the length of the tube, the explosion occurs at a rate which matches the fundamental or one of the harmonics of the tube, and the volume of the flame is not too great.

Different colors were probably not achieved in Kastner's time, but would be possible with the addition of salts to the flames.

He concluded that Pappas failed to properly organize the JIDC and ensure it performed its mission within applicable regulations, failed to incorporate checks and balances to prevent abuses, and failed to ensure his personnel were properly trained for the mission. Fay also found that Pappas showed poor judgment by leaving Lieutenant Colonel Steven L. Jordan in charge of the JIDC during critical stages and improperly authorized the use of dogs during interrogations, failed to take action regarding International Committee of the Red Cross reports of abuse, failed to take aggressive action against soldiers who violated procedures and the Geneva Conventions, failed to report that his unit would be unable to accomplish its mission due to lack of manpower and resources and allowed his subordinates to be subjected to inordinate pressures from higher headquarters, and failed to establish appropriate coordination between military intelligence and military police which would have alleviated confusion surrounding the abusive environment at the prison. Fay acknowledged that a significant number of systemic failures had occurred during the course of the scandal but asserted this did not relieve Pappas of his command responsibilities and recommended that Pappas' chain of command take action accordingly. In May 2005, Pappas received non-judicial punishment for two counts of dereliction of duty under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for failing to ensure that subordinates were adequately trained and supervised in application of interrogation procedures and for failing to obtain approval of superiors before authorizing the presence of military working dogs during prisoner interrogations.

He was the son of Robert Guiscard, the conqueror of southern Italy and Sicily; Roger was not as adept as his father, and most of his reign was spent in feudal anarchy. Roger was the son of Robert Guiscard and Sikelgaita, an imposing warrior Lombard noblewoman. His ambitious mother arranged for Roger to succeed his father in place of Robert Guiscard's eldest son by another wife, Bohemund of Taranto. According to English historian John Julius Norwich, his nickname came from \\"his early-ingrained habit of counting and recounting his money.\\" In 1073, Sichelgaita had Roger proclaimed heir after Guiscard fell ill at Trani. Roger's cousin Abelard was the only baron to dissent from the election of Roger, claiming that he was the rightful heir to the duchy. Roger accompanied his father on a campaign to Greece in 1084. He was still in Greece when his father died on 17 July 1085 in Kefalonia. While Bohemond was supposed to inherit the Greek possessions and Roger the Italian ones, it was Bohemund who was in Italy (Salerno) and Roger in Greece (Bundicia) at the time of the Guiscard's passing. Roger rejoined his mother on Cephalonia, his absence causing panic and confusion with his army, according to Goffredo Malaterra. The two quickly returned to the peninsula and with the support of Roger I of Sicily, his uncle, was recognised as duke in September. His Lombard heritage also made him a more attractive candidate than his Norman half-brother, who had fled to Capua. With the support of Jordan I of Capua, Bohemund rebelled against his brother and took Oria, Otranto, and Taranto. Roger, however, made peace in March 1086 and the brothers acted as effective co-rulers. In late Summer 1087, Bohemond renewed the war with the support of some of his brother's vassals. He surprised and defeated Roger at Fragneto and retook Taranto. Though described as a powerful warrior (he took the cities of Benevento, Canosa, Capua, and Lucera by siege), Roger Borsa was never able to check Bohemund's power or bring him under his control. The war was finally resolved by the mediation of Pope Urban II and the award of Taranto and other possessions to Bohemund. Roger also granted him Cosenza and other holdings he desired allodially. In 1089 Roger Borsa was officially invested with the duchy of Apulia by Pope Urban II. Roger permitted the minting of baronial coinage in at least two instances (Fulco of Basacers and Manso vicedux). He planned to urbanise the Mezzogiorno by granting charters to various towns and encouraging urban planning. In 1090, he and Urban encouraged Bruno of Cologne, founder of the Carthusian Order to accept election to the archbishopric of Reggio di Calabria. In May 1098, at the request of his first cousin once removed, Prince Richard II of Capua, Borsa and his uncle Count Roger I of Sicily began the siege of Capua, from which the prince had long ago been exiled as a minor. In exchange for his assistance, the duke received the homage of Richard, though he seems to have made no use of it, for Richard's successors paid no heed to Roger Borsa's overlordship. Capua fell after forty days of notable besieging, for Pope Urban II had come to meet Roger of Sicily and Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury had come to meet the pope. In October 1104, Roger besieged William, Count of Monte Sant'Angelo, who was at that time independent and pledged to the Byzantines, and expelled him from the Gargano, abolishing the county. Marriage and children In 1092, Roger Borsa married Adela, the daughter of Robert I, Count of Flanders, and widow of Canute IV of Denmark. She bore him three sons: Louis, who died young in August 1094; William, who succeeded him; and Guiscard, who died young in August 1108. By a concubine, Roger had at least one other son, William of Gesualdo. Notes and referencesSources *Norwich, John Julius. The Normans in the South 1016-1130.

The title thesmothete means ruler, or junior archon, of Athens (literally \\"rule-setter\\").  Biography  Little is known of Hierotheos (Ἰερόθεος \\"sanctified by God\\"); church tradition holds that he was one of the learned men in the city of Athens. He was instructed in Christianity by the Apostle Paul, who baptized and ordained him around the year 53. Hierotheos frequently visited and instructed St. Dionysius the Areopagite. There is disagreement as to whether Hierotheos was actually a priest or bishop; some traditions describe Dionysius as the first bishop of Athens. The fifth century Neoplatonist, Pseudo-Dionysius spoke of Hierotheos. However, Pseudo-Dionysius adopted the earlier Dionysius as a pseudonym and literary device and thus he did not in fact know the original Hierotheos and the description of Hierotheos and his works that Pseudo Dionysius supplied was either purely fictional or a veiled tribute to a fifth-century contemporary of Pseudo-Dionysius. Thus there was an Hierotheos and there was also a Pseudo- Hierotheos. According to Pseudo-Dionysius (On the Divine Names, 3:2), Hierotheos was an accomplished hymnographer: :\\"He was wholly transported, wholly outside himself and was so deeply absorbed in communion with the sacred things he celebrated in hymnology, that to all who heard him and saw him and knew him, and yet knew him not, he seemed to be inspired of God, a divine hymnographer.\\" Daily Reading, October 4, 2005, The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America  Hierotheos and the Dormition of the Theotokos  Hierotheos was reportedly present during the dormition of the Theotokos (Mary, the Mother of God),The Role of Hierotheus at the Dormition , Taylor Marshall and he stood in the midst of the apostles and comforted them with spiritual songs and hymns which he sang accompanied with musical instruments.

It was widely produced by Oerlikon Contraves and others, with various models employed by both Allied and Axis forces during World War II, and many versions are still in use today. History=Origins During World War I, the German industrialist Reinhold Becker developed a 20 mm caliber cannon, known now as the 20 mm Becker using the Advanced Primer Ignition blowback (API blowback) method of operation. This used a 20×70mmRB cartridge and had a cyclic rate of fire of 300 rpm. It was used on a limited scale as an aircraft gun on Luftstreitkräfte warplanes, and an anti-aircraft gun towards the end of that war. Because the Treaty of Versailles banned further production of such weapons in Germany, the patents and design works were transferred in 1919 to the Swiss firm SEMAG (Seebach Maschinenbau Aktien Gesellschaft) based near Zürich. SEMAG continued development of the weapon, and in 1924 had produced the SEMAG L, a heavier weapon (43 kg) that fired more powerful 20×100mmRB ammunition at a slightly higher rate of fire, 350 rpm. In 1924 SEMAG failed. The Oerlikon firm, named after the Zürich suburb of Oerlikon where it was based, then acquired all rights to the weapon, plus the manufacturing equipment and the employees of SEMAG. Oerlikon In 1927 the Oerlikon S was added to the existing product line. This fired a still larger cartridge (20x110RB) to achieve a muzzle velocity of 830 m/s (versus 490 m/s for the original Becker 20x70RB gun), at the cost of increased weight and a reduced rate of fire (280 rpm). The purpose of this development was to improve the performance of the gun as an anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapon, which required a higher muzzle velocity. An improved version known as the 1S followed in 1930. Three sizes of gun with their different ammunition and barrel length, but very similar mechanisms, continued to be developed in parallel. In 1930 Oerlikon reconsidered the application of its gun in aircraft and introduced the AF and AL, designed to be used in flexible mounts, i.e. manually aimed by a gunner. The 15-round box magazine used by earlier versions of the gun was replaced by drum magazine holding 15 or 30 rounds. In 1935 it made an important step by introducing a series of guns designed to be mounted in or on the wings of fighter aircraft. Designated with FF for Flügelfest meaning \\"wing-mounted\\", these weapons were again available in the three sizes, with designations FF, FFL and FFS. The FF fired a slightly larger cartridge than the AF, 20x72RB, but the major improvement in these weapons was a significant increase in rate of fire. The FF weighed 24 kg and achieved a muzzle velocity of 550 to 600 m/s with a rate of fire of 520 rpm. The FFL of 30 kg fired a projectile at a muzzle velocity of 675 m/s with a rate of fire of 500 rpm. And the FFS, which weighed 39 kg, delivered a high muzzle velocity of 830 m/s at a rate of fire of 470 rpm. Apart from changes to the design of the guns for wing-mounting and remote control, larger drums were introduced as it would not be possible to exchange magazines in flight. For the FF series drum sizes of 45, 60, 75 and 100 rounds were available, but most users chose the 60-round drum. The 1930s were a period of global re-armament, and a number of foreign firms took licenses for the Oerlikon family of aircraft cannon. In France, Hispano-Suiza manufactured development of the FFS as the Hispano-Suiza HS.7 and Hispano-Suiza HS.9, for installation between the cylinder banks of its V-12 engines. In Germany, Ikaria further developed the FF gun as the MG FF, firing 20x80RB ammunition. And the Imperial Japanese Navy, after evaluating all three guns, ordered developments of the FF and FFL as the Type 99-1 and Type 99-2. The incorporation of the improvements of the FFS in a new anti-aircraft gun produced, in 1938, the Oerlikon SS. Oerlikon realized further improvements in rate of fire on the 1SS of 1942, and the 2SS of 1945 which achieved 650 rpm. However, it was the original SS gun which was widely adopted as anti-aircraft gun, being especially widely used by Allied navies during World War II. This gun used a 400-grain (26-gram) charge of IMR 4831 smokeless powder to propel a 2,000-grain (130-gram) projectile at 2,800 feet (850 meters) per second. World War II A Royal Navy Oerlikon gunner at his gun mount aboard the in 1942 The Oerlikon FF was installed as armament on some fighters of the 1930s, such as the Polish PZL P.24G. Locally produced derivatives of the Oerlikon cannon were used much more extensively, on aircraft, on ships and on land. In the air, the Ikaria MG FF was used as armament on a number of German aircraft, of which the most famous is the Messerschmitt Bf 109. The Japanese Navy similarly used their copy of the FF, designated the Type 99 Mark One cannon on a number of types including the Mitsubishi A6M Zero. Later in the war, they also equipped fighters including the Zero with the Type 99 Mark Two, a version of the more powerful and faster- firing Oerlikon FFL. The French firm of Hispano-Suiza was a manufacturer of aircraft engines, and it marketed the moteur-canon combination of its 12X and 12Y engines with a H.S.7 or H.S.9 cannon installed between the cylinder banks. The gun fired through the hollow propeller hub, this being elevated above the crankcase by the design of the gearing. Such armament was installed on the Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 and some other types. Similar German installations of the MG FF were not successful. Diagrams showing basic design and colour-coding of British HE/Incendiary, Tracer and HE/Incendiary/Tracer shells for the 20 mm Oerlikon gun The Oerlikon became best known in its naval applications. Initially the Oerlikon was not looked upon favorably by the Royal Navy as a short-range anti-aircraft gun. All through 1937-1938 Lord Louis Mountbatten, then a Captain in the Royal Navy, waged a lone campaign within the Royal Navy to set up an unprejudiced trial for the Oerlikon 20 mm gun, but it was all in vain. It was not until the Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, Admiral Sir Roger Backhouse, was appointed First Sea Lord that Mountbatten's efforts bore fruit. During the first half of 1939 a contract for 1,500 guns was placed in Switzerland. However, due to delays and then later the Fall of France in June 1940, only 109 guns reached the United Kingdom. All Oerlikon guns imported from Switzerland, in 1940, were mounted on various gun carriages to serve as light AA-guns on land. Just a few weeks before the Fall of France, the Oerlikon factory approved manufacture of their gun in the United Kingdom, under licence. The Royal Navy managed to smuggle out the necessary drawings and documents from Zürich. The production of the first British-made Oerlikon guns started in Ruislip, London, at the end of 1940. The first guns were delivered to the Royal Navy in March or April, 1941. The RAF Regiment made extensive use of Oerlikon guns in the anti-aircraft role. These were the principal armament for its Light Anti-Aircraft squadrons in North Africa, the Middle East, Italy, and North Western Europe, until the introduction of the Bofors 40/L60 40mm gun from 1943, although many squadrons retained a mix of guns until the end of World War 2. Squadrons in the Far East were equipped exclusively with Oerlikons. 1945, a row of 20 mm Oerlikon guns aboard the The Oerlikon gun was installed aboard United States Navy ships from 1942, replacing the M2 Browning machine gun, which lacked range and firepower, and largely superseding the 1.1\\"/75 caliber gun, which was heavier and had less mechanical reliability. It became famous in the naval anti-aircraft role, providing an effective defense at short ranges (in practice up to 1.5 km) at which heavier guns had difficulty tracking a target. The gun was eventually abandoned as a major anti-air weapon due to its lack of stopping power against heavy aircraft and against Japanese kamikaze attacks during the Pacific War. It was largely superseded by the Bofors 40 mm gun and the 3\\"/50 Mark 22 gun. It provided a useful increase in firepower over the .50 cal machine gun when adapted and fitted to some aircraft. However, it had some problems with jamming in the ammunition feed. The Royal Canadian Navy popularized the use of the Oerlikon gun as an anti-ship and anti-submarine gun - while it was not effective against the armour of most larger ships, it was used extensively and effectively against U-Boats, and on the decks of larger ships. A handful of corvettes were fitted with the weapon toward the end of the war, but it appeared more commonly on frigates and destroyers at the time. The Oerlikon was also used as the basis for the Polsten gun, designed by Polish engineers in exile in the United Kingdom. The gun went into service in 1944, and was used well into the 1950s, among other uses, on Cromwell tanks and early model Centurion tanks. Romania purchased 45 pieces from Germany during the first half of World War II. Post-war It is still in use today on some naval units, theoretically as a last-recourse anti-air weapon, but mainly used for firing warning shots or incapacitating small vessels. Description The aiming sight of the Oerlikon gun Very unusually for a high-powered autocannon, the Oerlikon and its derivatives feature blowback operation: the bolt is not locked to the breech of the gun at the moment of firing. Non-locking, simple blowback designs are commonplace in much lighter weapons, such as small- caliber semi-automatic pistols. No locking is required, as with such low-power cartridges the static inertia of the bolt or bolt and slide - the physical tendency of heavy components to resist rapid acceleration - is adequate to ensure that the projectile has left the muzzle and the gas pressure in the barrel is down to a safe level before the breech opens (while the bolt spring also resists the opening of the breech, in practical terms its contribution is too small to be relevant).\\"The Machine Gun\\", Volume4, George M.Chinn., page 12 In contrast, 20mm cartridges are far too powerful, and efficient autocannon barrels too long, for this basic system to be practical; so the Oerlikon uses Advanced Primer Ignition (API) to augment the resistance of the bolt. In API blowback weapons, the firing pin fires the cartridge while the bolt is still traveling forward so that the gas pressure has to overcome the forward momentum of the bolt as well, before it can push it to the rear. To facilitate this, the Oerlikon's chamber is longer than needed to contain the cartridge, and the front-end of the bolt, which is the same diameter as the case, actually enters this extended chamber behind the cartridge before firing. As a result when firing occurs, the forward force of the bolt and spring acts against the force of the propellant gases until the latter overcome the former and start pushing case, bolt and spring backwards. If the bolt had stopped at the mouth of the chamber as in a simple blowback gun, this momentum would have been neutralized; instead thanks to the continuous movement the momentum acts to counter the propellant gases and slow the rearward travel of cartridge and bolt. Synergistically with this, a second advantage of this unusual arrangement is that after firing the bolt and case have a short, but significant, distance to travel rearwards before the bolt-end re-emerges and the case in turn begins to leave the chamber; and this in combination with the deceleration provides sufficient time for gas pressure to drop to the necessary safe level. This system permits blowback to be used in far more powerful weapons than normal. Nevertheless, compared to guns with a locking mechanism a fairly heavy bolt must be employed; while to give this heavy bolt sufficient forward speed, a large spring is required (and Oerlikons, distinctively, have this component wrapped around their barrels.) These features will limit the rate of fire of such guns, unless other steps are taken—as in the final model of the Japanese 99 Mark 2. This unique chamber and bolt design necessitates the use of a characteristically shaped cartridge: the case has straight sides, very little neck, and a rebated rim. The straight sides allows the case to slide back and forward in the cylindrical chamber. The neck is not supported while this happens and therefore expands when the case is fired, and the rebated rim allows the face of the bolt, with its extractor claw hooked over the rim, to fit within the chamber. To ease the motion of the case, the ammunition needed to be greased, which was a drawback of the Oerlikon cannon. An alternative developed during World War II was the so-called fluted chamber, which had grooves that allowed propellant gas to seep between the chamber wall and the case, taking over the role of the grease. Ammunition feed is typically by a 60-round drum magazine on the top of the gun. During sustained firing, the magazine must be frequently changed, reducing the effective rate of fire. Belt-fed versions of the gun were developed to overcome this limitation. A trigger in the right-hand grip controls fire. Used cartridges are ejected from below the breech. Different nations and services operated a number of mounting types for the same basic gun. In a typical single-barrel naval version, it is free-swinging on a fixed pedestal mounting with a flat armored shield affording some protection for the crew. The cannon is aimed and fired by a gunner using, in its simplest form, a ring-and-bead sight. The gunner is attached to the weapon by a waist-belt and shoulder supports. For this reason, some mountings existed with a height- adjustment feature to compensate for different sized gunners. A \\"piece chief\\" designates targets and the feeder changes exhausted magazines. During World War II, twin and quadruple Oerlikon mounts were developed, both for army and for navy use. The British Navy operated a hydraulically operated twin-gun mount. The US Navy operated a quad mount developed for PT boats by Elco Naval Division, Electric Boat Company, called the Elco \\"Thunderbolt\\" Mount. Prototypes were built and tested in late 1942 and operationally deployed on several Elco PT Boats in the Mediterranean.Elco Naval Division Memo.

In their larval stage, they attach to various animals, including humans, and feed on skin, often causing itching. These relatives of ticks are nearly microscopic, measuring 0.4 mm (0.01 in) and have a chrome- orange hue. A common species of harvest mite in North America is Trombicula alfreddugesi; in the UK, the most prevalent harvest mite is Trombicula autumnalis. The larval mites feed on the skin cells, but not blood, of animals. The six-legged parasitic larva feeds on a large variety of creatures, including humans, rabbits, toads, box turtles, quail, and even some insects. After crawling onto their hosts, they inject digestive enzymes into the skin that break down skin cells. They do not actually \\"bite\\", but instead form a hole in the skin called a stylostome, and chew up tiny parts of the inner skin, thus causing severe irritation and swelling. The severe itching is accompanied by red pimple-like bumps (papules) or hives and skin rash or lesions on a sun-exposed area. For humans, itching usually occurs after the larvae detach from the skin. After feeding on their hosts, the larvae drop to the ground and become nymphs, then mature into adults, which have eight legs and are harmless to humans. In the postlarval stage, they are not parasitic and feed on plant materials. The females lay three to eight eggs in a clutch, usually on a leaf or under the roots of a plant, and die by autumn.  Range  Harvest mites are found throughout the world. In Europe and North America, they tend to be more prevalent in the hot and humid parts. In the more temperate regions, they are found only in the summer (in French, harvest mites are called aoûtat, after août, August; vendangeon, after vendange, harvest; or rouget, after rouge, red). In the United States, they are found mostly in the southeast, the south, and the Midwest. They are not present, or barely found, in far northern areas, high mountains, or deserts. They live in forests and grasslands, and are also found in low, damp areas where vegetation is rank, such as woodlands, berry patches, orchards, along lakes and streams, and even in drier places where vegetation is low, such as lawns, golf courses, and parks. They are most numerous in early summer, when grass, weeds, and other vegetation are most prevalent. Harvest mites can also find their way into homes, and onto human hosts, on decorative Spanish moss.

Under his military leadership he conquered much of the eastern portions of the Greater Iran consisting of modern-day Iran, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan as well as portions of western Pakistan and a small part of Iraq. He was succeeded by his brother, Amr ibn al-Layth. Early life Ya'qub was born in 840 in a small town called Karnin (Qarnin), which was located east of Zaranj and west of Bost (Lashkargah), in what is now Afghanistan. Information about his genealogy and social background is lacking. Clifford Edmund Bosworth explains that a number of Sunni sources were invariably hostile to Ya'qub because of the disrespect he showed toward the Abbasid caliph. Bosworth, \\"The Armies of the Saffarids\\", pp. 536, 541. Cited in \\"Some sources accused Ya'qub of being a Khariji, Ibn Khallikan labelled him a Christian, and Nizam al-Mulk claimed that he converted to Ismailism\\". However, these claims came roughly a century after Yaqub's death, and most sources agree on Ya'qub's ascetic lifestyle. Abu Nasr al-Farabi states in his book Ara'ahl al-Midnia al-Fadilah that Yaqub was indeed a Sunni Muslim and that his armies had marched and conquered with the blessing of the Abbasid Caliph early on in Ya'qub's career. His later hostility towards the Abbasids was not religious but rather political. Many sources claim that he lived a very poor life, and it is mentioned that he sometimes ate bread and onions due to poverty. His family moved to the city of Zaranj due to the occasional sectarian violence between the Sunnis and Kharijites. His father, Laith, was probably killed before the family arrived in the new city. Ya'qub began work as a coppersmith (\\"saffar\\"), while his brother Amr ibn al-Layth worked as a mule-hirer.  Rise to power  Ya'qub, along with his brothers Amr ibn al- Layth, Tahir ibn al-Layth and Ali ibn al-Layth, later joined the ayyars under Salih ibn al-Nadr, who had opposed the Abbasids and began ruling in Bost. By 854, the ayyars managed to expel Ibrahim ibn al-Hudain, who was the Tahirid governor of Sistan. In 858, Dirham ibn Nasr, another ayyar leader, managed to replace Salih as the ruler of Sistan. However, in 861, Ya'qub overthrew Dirham, and gave himself the title of Emir at that point. Reign=Campaigns in Sistan and Khorasan Map of Khurasan, Transoxiana and Tokharistan Ya'qub attracted the attention of an Abbasid caliph by first battling Kharijites in his homeland of Sistan. In 864, \\"Yaʿqub led an expedition to Bost against his former master Salih, and then into Rukkaj and Zamindāvar against the local ruler there, the Zunbil, killing him and securing an immense booty.\\" He also managed to capture several family members of the Zunbils, including the Zunbil king's son. He later moved against the Kharijites in northern Sistan, winning a decisive victory and killing their leader Ammar ibn Yaser in 865. Ya'qub's campaigns marked the decline of militant Kharijism in the East. After having defeated the Ammar, Ya'qub held a celebration. During the celebration, one of the members of the court made a speech in Arabic. Ya'qub asked the latter why he made a speech in a language which he could not understand. One of Ya'qub's secretaries, Muhammad ibn Vasif, then made a qasida in Persian. Ya'qub claimed the inheritance of the kings of Persia and sought \\"to revive their glory,\\" and thus in 867 he sent a poem written by himself to the Abbasid caliph Al-Mu'tazz. The poem said: \\"With me is the Derafsh Kaviani, through which I hope to rule the nations.\\" In 870/871, Ya'qub marched against the Kharijites of Herat, and defeated them. He then marched towards Karukh, and defeated another Khariji leader who was named Abd al-Rahman. Ya'qub then pardoned Abd al-Rahman and made him governor of Isfizar. His army would later march to Ghazna, Kabul, and Bamyan, conquering these territories in the name of Islam by appointing Muslim governors. From there they moved to north of the Hindu Kush and by 870 AD the whole of Khorasan was brought under their control. The Panjshir Valley was now under Ya'qub's control, which made him able to mint silver coins.Pandjhir, Encyclopedia of Islam, Vol. VIII, 258. In 873, Ya'qub ousted the Tahirids from their own capital of Nishapur, and captured its ruler Muhammad ibn Tahir, which led to conflicts with the Abbasid caliphate. During one of Ya'qub's numerous battles, his face was disfigured to where he could only eat through a pipe in his mouth for twenty days. Campaigns in Western Iran Ya'qub set out west for Fars with the intention of subjugating the province. Sources disagree on what happened next, but Ya'qub was eventually dissuaded from continuing his expedition, and he turned back toward Sistan. His withdrawal is described as having been caused either by the governor Muhammad ibn Wasil's submission to him, or by the arrival of emissaries sent by the caliphal government to convince him to abandon his westward advance. In either case, Muhammad soon afterwards reached a rapprochement with the central government, and in 872 he handed over the kharaj (tax revenues), and possibly the government of Fars, to a caliphal representative. Ya'qub later traveled to Tabaristan in 874, and battled the Zaydid leader al-Hasan ibn Zayd. Ya'qub collected taxes in Tabaristan's capital Amul before departing for Rayy. Ya'qub ibn al-Layth once again set out for Fars, this time, invading it and advancing to Estakhr, seizing Muhammad's treasuries there. Muhammad departed from Khuzestan, and returned to Fars in an attempt to stop Ya'qub. They met near Lake Bakhtegan in August 875, and in the resulting battle, Muhammad, despite having a numerically superior army, was defeated. Muhammad was forced to flee; Ya'qub looted Muhammad's stronghold at Sa'idabad and took control of Fars. Map showing the location of the battle, as well as the routes taken by the Saffarid (red) and main 'Abbasid (blue) armies In 876, the Abbasid representative Al-Muwaffaq offered Ya'qub governorship of Khurasan, Tabaristan, Fars, Gurgan, and Ray, and to appoint him as head of security in Baghdad. Ya'qub, sensing that the offer was made due to the weakness of the caliph, rejected it and wrote back that he would be advancing to the capital. The offer also alienated the Turks of Samarra, who felt that Ya'qub represented a threat to their interests. Seeing that an agreement with the Saffarid was impossible, the Abbasid caliph al-Mu'tamid decided upon war and pronounced a formal curse upon Ya'qub. On 7 March 876, al-Mu'tamid left Samarra, leaving his son Al-Mufawwad in charge of the capital. On 15 March he arrived at Baghdad, before arriving near Kalwadha and setting up camp. Ya'qub traveled through Khuzistan, during which he gained the defection of a former general of the caliph's, Abi'l-Saj Devdad, and entered Iraq. The caliphal general Masrur al-Balkhi managed to slow down his progress by flooding the land outside Wasit, but the Saffarid army was able to get through this and he entered Wasit on 24 March. Leaving Wasit, he set out for the town of Dayr al-\`Aqul, which was about fifty miles from Baghdad. According to one source, Ya'qub did not actually expect the caliph to offer battle; instead he would give in to any demands that the Saffarid had. Al-Mu'tamid, however, sent al- Muwaffaq to stop him. The two armies met at Istarband, between Dayr al-\`Aqul and Sib Bani Kuma. The battle took place on 8 April. Before the battle, Ya'qub reviewed his troops, who apparently numbered about ten thousand. The Abbasids, however, had a numerical superiority and the additional advantage of fighting on familiar territory. The center of the Abbasid army was commanded by al- Muwaffaq. Musa bin Bugha had command of the right wing, and Masrur al-Balkhi the left. A final appeal was made to the Saffarids to restore their loyalty to the caliph, and the battle began. The fighting raged on for most of the day. The Saffarid army was somewhat reluctant to directly fight the caliph and his army. Despite this, there were heavy losses on both sides, and several Abbasid and Saffarid commanders were killed. Ya'qub himself was wounded, but he did not leave the field. As evening approached, reinforcements arrived to support al-Muwaffaq. The mawla Nusayr created a diversion by attacking the Saffarid rear from boats on the Tigris and setting fire to the Saffarid baggage train, giving the Abbasids a further advantage. Eventually the Saffarid army began to flee from the battle. Ya'qub and his bodyguards continued to fight, but were forced to leave the field as the army retreated, leaving them behind. The caliph had apparently flooded the lands behind the Saffarids before the battle, and this made a retreat difficult; many men drowned attempting to escape the Abbasid army. With the Saffarids making their hasty exit, al- Muwaffaq was able to capture Ya'qub's baggage. Several political prisoners that Ya'qub had brought with him, such as the Tahirid Muhammad bin Tahir, also fell into Abbasid hands and were freed. Ya'qub then withdrew from Iraq and died three years later.  Ideology  The motivation behind the Saffarids' initial campaigns remains unknown and highly debated in secondary scholarship. Some scholars believe that Ya'qub fought as a ghazi warrior for the purpose of spreading proto-Sunni Islam, others support the notion that he was motivated by his Persian identity and consequent desire to restore the glorious Sasanian past, while still others believe he was simply motivated by greed and adrenaline. Ya'qub's hostility towards the Abbasid caliphs was easily seen. According to the Tarikh-i Sistan, Ya'qub even said that the Abbasids were liars, and also said: \\"Haven't you seen what they did to Abu Salama, Abu Muslim, the Barmakid family and Fadl ibn Sahl, despite everything which these men had done on the dynasty's behalf? Let no one ever trust them!\\" Death Ya'qub suffered from colic and was refusing treatments when advised to do so. As a result, he died on Wednesday, 5 June 879, in Gundeshapur. He was soon after succeeded by his brother Amr Saffari. Although he was not viewed as a gentleman, he also did not exercise any special cruelty. It was reported that he did not smile much, and was called \\"the anvil\\" by one of his enemies. According to Ibn Khallikan, his wife was an Arab woman from Sistan, although all other sources, including Ibn Athir and Juzjani, claim that Yaqub never married. Legacy It was during Ya'qub's rule that Persian was introduced as an official language, and Ya'qub reportedly did not know Arabic. Ya'qub has been accorded the historical status of a popular folk hero since his court began the revitalization of the Persian language after two centuries in which the Arabic language flourished in Persian lands. Several poets, like Abu Ishaq Ibrahim ibn Mamshadh, fabricated Ya'qub's genealogy, tracing it back to the legendary Iranian king Jamshid. Ya'qub is also sometimes perceived as one of the first autonomous rulers in Khurasan since the Islamic conquests. Ya'qub's campaigns in fact also marked the early stage in the decline of caliphal political unity in the Islamic world, which was further worsened by the ghulams and the Dailamites.

PySolFC Rules First, the cards are dealt into columns of four on the tableau, resulting in 13 columns. Any king that is in the top or middle of each column must be placed on the bottom before the game starts. Two kings that are mixed into one column are placed on the bottom without changing their order.PySolFC - Rules for Baker’s Dozen The object of the game is to build all the cards onto the four foundations. The player must first free up the four aces and if one of them is found, it is placed on the foundation. Building on the foundation is up by suit, each from ace to king.Baker’s Dozen Solitaire - Rules at boardgames.about.com Only the top cards of each column are available. Cards on the tableau, if they cannot be placed on the foundations yet, can be built down regardless of suit. Furthermore, once all cards are taken out of a column, the column can never be filled. The game is won when all cards end up in the foundations. Variations Here are some variations of Baker's Dozen: * In Spanish Patience, any card can fill empty tableau spaces. (In some sources, the foundations are built up regardless of suit) * Castles in Spain is akin to Spanish Patience, but the cards in the tableau are built down by alternate color.\\"Castles in Spain\\" (p.11) in Card & Dice Games by N.A.C. Bathe, Robert Frederick Ltd, 2004. In some variations, the tableau is dealt face-down aside from the top cards of each column. * In Good Measure, two aces are taken out and placed on the foundations while the rest of the deck is shuffled and laid out in columns of five cards, resulting in 10 columns. Like in Baker's Dozen, Kings that are at the top or in the middle of their respective columns are placed at the bottom and the game proceeds in the process stated above. * Portuguese Solitaire is halfway between Baker's Dozen and Spanish Patience because empty columns can only be filled with Kings. * Bisley builds foundations upwards from Ace and downwards from King simultaneously.

At the 1996 Paralympics in Atlanta, she took silver in the shot put and gold in the pentathlon. Her career as a world-class runner in able-bodied events began in 1999 at the Pan American Games in Winnipeg, where she won Gold in the 1,500-meter race and was ranked second in the United States in that event in 1999 by Track and Field News. The next year, she placed eighth in the 1,500-meter in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, making Runyan the first legally blind athlete to compete in the Olympics and the highest finish by an American woman in that event. By 2001 she won her first of three consecutive 5000 metre National Championships. She also released her autobiography \\"No Finish Line: My Life As I See It\\" In 2002, she added the road 5K and 10K National Championships,Monti, David (2002-06-01). Runyan Wins U.S. 5-K Title . IAAF. Retrieved on 2010-06-06. and married her coach, Matt Lonergan. She finished as the top American at the 2002 New York Marathon with a time of 2 hours, 27 minutes and 10 seconds to post the second-fastest debut time ever by an American woman. Being an international medalist at 1500 metres and a top major marathon runner is an accomplishment over a wide variety of distances rivaled only by Rod Dixon on the men's side. Medaling at distances as short as 100 metres and diversely explosive events like Shot Put and Long Jump is remarkable versatility. She won the road 5K again in 2003 and qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympic Games by finishing second in the United States Olympic Trials (track and field). She took 2005 off to give birth to her first child, Anna Lee on September 1, but returned to the roads in 2006 winning her second National Championship at 20 km (her first was in 2003). She was the USATF \\"Runner of the Year\\" in 2002 and 2006. Arguably Runyan's greatest success came at the Paralympic Games, where she has been a five times gold medallist.\\"Paralympic Athletics\\" , London 2012 , Runyan holds IPC World Records in the T13 classification for the 400 m, 800 m, 1500 m, 5000 m, High Jump, Long Jump and Pentathlon.

From 1919 until 1922 Troll studied biology, chemistry, geology, geography and physics at the Universität in München. In 1921 he obtained his doctorate in botany and in 1925 his habilitation in geography. Between 1922 and 1927 he worked as an assistant at the Geography Institute in Munich. Troll was engaged in research in the ecology and geography of mountainous lands: between 1926 and 1929 went on a research journey throughout South American Andean countries where he visited northern Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Panama. In 1933 and 1934 his research interests took him to East and South Africa; in 1937 Troll was in Ethiopia; and in 1954 he visited Mexico. In 1930 he became professor of colonial and overseas geography in Berlin, and in 1938 professor of geography in Bonn. Troll, who utilised aerial photographs in his research, coined the term Landscape ecology in 1939. He developed this terminology and many early concepts of landscape ecology and of high mountain ecology and geography as part of his early work applying aerial photographs interpretation to studies of interactions between environment and vegetation and from his research travels in the mountainous regions of Asia, Africa and South America, as well as his native Europe. He developed seasonal climatic charts and three- dimensional climatic classification from hydrological, biological and economical data. Carl Troll was president of the International Geographical Union from 1960 to 1964 Andean research Compared to other scientist of the first half of the 20th century Troll's Andean work stands out by being free of developmentalist thought and there is \\"no evidence of triumphalism of Western science in his Andean work\\". Vertical zonation is the most acclaimed part of Trolls work in the Andes building upon the work of Alexander von Humboldt. The Inca Empire and the environment Carl Troll argued that the development of the Inca state in the central Andes was aided by conditions that allows for the elaboration of the staple food chuño. Chuño which can be stored for long times is made of potato dried at freezing temperatures that are common at nighttime in the southern Peruvian highlands. Contradicting the link between the Inca state and chuño is that other crops such as maize can also be with dried only sun. Troll did also argue that llamas, the Inca's pack animal, can be found in its largest numbers in this very same region. It is worth considering the maximum extent of the Inca Empire roughly coincided with the greatest distribution of alpacas and llamas in Pre-Hispanic America. The link between the Andean biomes of puna and páramo, pastoralism and the Inca state is a matter of research. As a third point Troll pointed out irrigation technology as advantageous to the Inca state-building. While Troll theorized environmental influences on the Inca Empire he opposed environmental determinism arguing that culture lay at the core of the Inca civilization.

It encompasses the western part of the state of Oregon, from the summit of the Cascades to the Pacific Ocean. The Archbishop of Portland serves as the Ordinary of the archdiocese and Metropolitan of the Ecclesiastical Province of Portland whose suffragan dioceses cover the entire three states of Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. The dioceses of the province include Baker (eastern Oregon), Boise (Idaho), Helena (western Montana), and Great Falls-Billings (eastern Montana). As published in the 2013 \\"Oregon Catholic Directory,\\" this archdiocese serves 412,725 Catholics (out of more than 3.3 million people). There are 150 diocesan priests, 144 religious priests, 79 permanent deacons, 388 women religious, and 78 religious brothers. The archdiocese has 124 parishes, 22 missions, 1 seminary, 40 elementary schools, 10 secondary schools, and 2 Catholic colleges.  History  There were thirteen Canadians in John Jacob Astor's expedition of 1810. Most were Catholic, and many, like Étienne Lucier, settled in the Willamette Valley.Blanchet, Francis Norbert. Historical Sketches of the Catholic Church in Oregon, During the Past Forty Years, Catholic Sentinel Press, 1878, p. 7 By 1829, Lucier had established a permanent land claim next to the Willamette Fur Post near Champoeg on the French Prairie. On March 22, 1836, he and 15 other French Canadian settlers on the petitioned sent to Norbert Provencher, the titular Bishop of Juliopolis, to request a priest for the settlement. Missionary priests, Rev. François Norbert Blanchet and Rev. Modeste Demers arrived at Fort Vancouver on November 24, 1838. On December 1, 1843, the Vatican established the Vicariate Apostolic of the Oregon Territory with Rev. Msgr.

In 1870, Catholic Sentinel was founded as the official newspaper of the archdiocese. St. Boniface Church was erected in Sublimity, Oregon in 1889.Friedman Ralph, In Search of Western Oregon, Caldwell, Idaho: Caxton Printers, Ltd., 2nd printing, 1992, pp. 376-377, 20th century Further territory was lost when the Diocese of Baker City was created on June 19, 1903. St. Mary's Church in Mount Angel was erected in 1912. Following the death of Archbishop Alexander Christie, Edward Daniel Howard was appointed the fifth Archbishop of Oregon City on April 30, 1926. His installation took place at St. Mary's Cathedral in Portland on August 26 of that year. On September 26, 1928, the name of the archdiocese was changed from Oregon City to Portland in Oregon, \\"in Oregon\\" being added because there was another diocese called Portland (in Maine). During his tenure as archbishop, Howard created a chancery in the cathedral rectory, later transferring it to a separate building. He reorganized the St. Vincent de Paul and Holy Name Societies, fostered the growth of Catholic Charities, and removed the Catholic Sentinel from private ownership. In 1931, Howard led a successful campaign to repeal local zoning ordinances that prohibited the building of churches and parochial schools. He convened the Fourth Provincial Council of the archdiocese in 1932, and held a synod for the clergy in 1935. In 1939, he founded Central Catholic High School in Portland and was named an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne by Pope Pius XII in 1939. He convened the Fifth Provincial Council of the Archdiocese in 1957, and attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council between 1962 and 1965. 21st century Bankruptcy = The Archdiocese's sexual abuse scandal prompted the archbishop to file for Chapter 11 reorganization on July 6, 2004. Portland became the first Catholic diocese to file for bankruptcy. Archbishop Vlazny described his actions by saying, \\"This is not an effort to avoid responsibility. It is, in fact, the only way I can assure that other claimants can be offered fair compensation.\\" In February 2009, the Oregon Jesuit Province also filed for bankruptcy as well.https://omnimgt.com/sblite/jesuit/ Clergy sexual abuse settlements In April 2007, the archdiocese announced a settlement had been reached and the bankruptcy court had approved a financial plan of reorganization.$71.45 million was paid to 169 victims, averaging $342,000 each; this is the 8th largest Roman Catholic clergy sexual abuse settlements in the history of the U.S. Diocesan bankruptcy filings list 11 priests as perpetrators.

The brand was synonymous with French bicycle racing from the 1960s through the mid-1980s, sponsoring riders such as Jacques Anquetil (1963–1965), Lucien Van Impe (1974–1976), Bernard Hinault (1975–1983), Laurent Fignon (1982–1988), and Greg LeMond (1981–1984). It is owned by Grimaldi Industri AB.  History  Cycles Gitane have their roots in 1925, when Marcel Brunelière opened a smith and agricultural repair works at Machecoul in the Loire-Atlantique region of France. He began making parts for bicycles and the following year opened a further workshop to assemble bicycles for G.M.B and Marbru. Brunelière began making his own bicycles in 1930, choosing the name Gitane (meaning \\"gypsy\\" [feminine]). He added light motorcycles in the 1950s. The name changed to Micmo in 1960 but continued to sell Gitane bicycles. Nearly a third of Micmo was owned by Renault, the car- maker, which had acquired 30 per cent of the shares in 1974. In 1976 it bought the rest. Gitane bicycles were first imported into the U.S. in 1958 by Mel Pinto Imports of Virginia, and as such were among the first European racing bicycles to be regularly imported into that country. The arrival of a new director-general at the head of Renault in 1985, Georges Besse, led the company to sell Micmo to raise capital. Micmo continued and then in 1992 joined Peugeot and the Spanish company, BH, to form the Cycleurope group to compete with growing competition from Asia. Later, BH sold Gitane/Peugeot and the rest of Cycleurope to the Swedish Monark conglomerate.  Sponsorships  Gitane sponsored its first professionals in 1948. From 1953 to 1955 it equipped Jean Stablinski. In 1960 it helped back and Rudi Altig. In 1963 and 1964, Gitane bicycles won the Tour de France, ridden by Jacques Anquetil. Renault sponsored a professional team in the 1970s and, since it owned Micmo, the company behind Gitane, made Gitane the co-sponsor. Riders on Gitanes included Lucien Van Impe, Bernard Hinault, Laurent Fignon and Greg LeMond, all winners of the Tour de France. Gitane then sponsored the team led by Laurent Fignon, led by Charly Mottet, and led by Jean-François Bernard. Gitane sponsored mountain-bike teams in the 1990s. Gitane returned to road cycling after several years' absence, backing and . For 2010, Gitane sponsored the team with its new line of Definitive Gitane \\"The One\\" ISP bicycles. Gitane bicycles are available in Europe only. The aluminum and steel Gitanes are still built in the factories in Machecoul (the original Gitane factory) and the Cycleurope facility at Romilly Sur Seine (the old Peugeot factory) in France, while all carbon bikes are built in Asia.

C-78 WSVL-FM was programmed to serve Shelbyville and the surrounding communities. In 1980, Indianapolis lawyer and broadcaster Jeff Smulyan and two partners formed Emmis Communications. The name Emmis is taken from the Hebrew language, meaning \\"truth.\\" They purchased WSVL-FM with the goal was to move the radio station into the larger nearby Indianapolis radio market. WSVL-FM relaunched as adult contemporary music formatted WENS on June 4, 1981. WENS was known as the \\"Flagship Station of Emmis Communications\\" according to its hourly legal station identification. The radio station's new programming was an immediate success in the Indianapolis market. With help from Chief Engineer Bob Hawkins, the late Tim McKee was the first voice heard on the new FM 97 WENS. The original air staff included McKee and Program Director Rick Cummings in middays, Gary Semro in morning drive, Scott Wheeler in afternoon drive, with Chuck Larson and Kristi Lee in nights and overnights. Veteran broadcast journalist Glenn Webber anchored morning news on WENS. Afternoon news anchor was Carol Harm. Harm was soon replaced by Linda Shane. Bernie Eagan joined the radio station in August 1981. Other early weekend talent included Jerry Walker, Kevin Dugan, Wendi Ney and Jennifer Carr. Chuck Larson left the station for WNAP in October 1981 and was replaced by Gene Olson. Cummings moved to mornings after Semro joined the Satellite Music Network in Chicago for morning drive on SMN's new Country Coast to Coast format in the fall of 1981. While the early WENS promoted itself as the radio station for \\"no gimmicks, games, or contests,\\" a Labor Day tradition in Indianapolis was started in 1983, when WENS presented its first \\"Skyconcert.\\" The fireworks show, created by then Promotions Director Martha Sakai, was a synchronized fireworks to music show presented on the banks of the White River at Tenth Street in downtown Indianapolis. The \\"Skyconcert\\" was also broadcast by tape delay on Indianapolis television. \\"Skyconcert\\" was a sales success for the WENS sales department, first headed by Jim Culbertson, and later by sales leadership from Gary Rozynek, Jon Horton, Mark Renier, and Tom O'Brien. Once Program Director Rick Cummings became more involved with the growth of Emmis Broadcasting, Ron Jordan was hired for morning drive. Jordan only lasted three months in the shift. He was replaced by the all too brief pairing of Bruce Munson and Tim McKee. Tragically, McKee died of a heart attack just three days before the second annual WENS \\"Skyconcert\\" in late August 1984. McKee's midday shift was filled by the return of Chuck Larson, who had returned for weekends, after working part-time with daytimer beautiful music-formatted WATI. Ironically, it was Larson who first took the call informing station management of McKee's death. Later, McKee's grieving fiancée confirmed that it was Larson's compassionate response to her call that allowed her to keep her emotions in check during that first difficult hour after Tim's passing. McKee had also served as production director for WENS, and was replaced in that capacity by Tom Woody. Scott Wheeler became program director following Cummings move to Emmis corporate programmer. Under Wheeler's leadership, WENS became one of the radio station's that redefined the new AC sound. Still, Wheeler faced a difficult battle with up and coming Top 40 WZPL. Ratings at WENS dropped, and Wheeler was replaced as program director by Joel Grey. Wheeler remained and split the midday shift with Grey. Grey's first move as PD was to shift Chuck Larson, by then starring in weekends for Randy Michaels at WLW Cincinnati, to late nights. Larson left the station again, in a move to Evansville, Indiana as chief engineer of radio station WGBF (AM). Under Grey, WENS adopted the name of \\"Lite Rock 97\\" and quickly regained its earlier ratings dominance. Chuck Larson was replaced in the late night slot by Dave Taylor. With Taylor came the birth of \\"Night Lite Love Songs,\\" a nighttime request and dedication show. Taylor left to return to Boston late in 1986, and was replaced on the \\"Night Lite\\" show by Eric Garnes. Garnes had joined for weekends in early 1982, and had been hosting overnights on WENS since the 1985 departure of Gene Olson. Garnes was replaced in overnights by Darla Coop. Production director Tom Woody had been replaced by Eric Edwards in late 1985. With Edwards' 1986 move to sister station Power 106 Los Angeles, Coop with help from Neal Kelly had taken a greater production role at the station. With the move to overnights, Coop was replaced in production by Tammy Warner. After the death of Tim McKee, Munson was joined in mornings by Mark Patrick. Known as \\"Them Guys in the Morning,\\" the show failed to gain traction against WFBQ's Bob and Tom show, and Munson left the station for a career in law and politics in the fall of 1986. Dennis Jon Bailey crossed the street from legendary Indy AM radio station WIRE, to join Patrick in morning drive. This show also failed to draw an audience, and Patrick left the show in Spring 1987. Frustrated with having to host a music intensive morning show, Bailey left for WKLR-FM in August 1987. Tammy Warner also moved to WKLR that fall. Scott Wheeler left WENS to join friend Gary Hoffmann at WZPL in July 1987. Jerry Curtis had joined WENS for middays weeks prior to Bailey's departure. Curtis quickly moved into the morning show, and was later joined by John Cinnamon. Alan Cook joined WENS in September 1987. Cook first worked early evenings, then middays, and contributed greatly to the growth of station's award-winning production effort. By 1988, Coop had joined Garnes on \\"Night Lite Love Songs,\\" and was replaced in overnights by former station intern and \\"Night Lite\\" producer Stephanie Smith. Once Coop finally left the station, Smith moved to co-hosting duties on \\"Night Lite,\\" and was replaced in overnights by Don Carson. As the 1980s ended, WENS on-air staffers included \\"John and Jerry in the Morning,\\" Operations Director Joel Grey and Music Director Alan Cook in middays, APD Bernie Eagan in afternoons, Eric Garnes and Stephanie Smith on \\"Night Lite\\" and Don Carson in overnights. Audrey Rochelle was WENS news director. Ken Hayes anchored drive time traffic from \\"Beck Toyota Mobile 97.\\" Weekend talent included Mike Adams, Tim Bonnell, Neal Kelly, Gary Hunter, Mike Seneda and Scott Robinson. Other 1980s weekend talent at WENS included Kevin Calabro, Mike Ivers, Ellen K, now morning drive at KOST-FM Los Angeles and Darryl Parks, formerly of WLW Cincinnati. David Christian joined WENS in 1989 as Production Director and also carried a weekend air shift. Unlike the 1980s, the 1990s were a relatively quiet time regarding air staff change at WENS. The summer of 1990 brought the end of the \\"John and Jerry\\" morning show. Scott Fischer joined news director Audrey Rochelle on the WENS morning show in the fall of 1990. In the spring of 1991 Program Director Joel Grey left WENS. That summer Alan Cook and Stephanie Smith also left the radio station. John Cinnamon, formerly of the \\"John and Jerry\\" morning show, was rehired for middays. Eric Garnes continued as solo host on \\"Night Lite Love Songs.\\" Joel Grey's replacement was Chuck Knight, from the Des Moines, Iowa radio market. Knight inherited a veteran and highly successful air staff. Don Carson expanded his overnight duties with the role of morning show producer. Previous WENS morning show producers had included Howard Schrott, Kevin Burris and Kay Feeney. Former weekender Tim Bonnell took the 10p to 2a shift. This included the last two hours of \\"Nite Lite Love Songs\\". Bonnell had returned in November 1988, as a part-timer, from a one- year stint in Raleigh, North Carolina at 100.7 WTRG, as morning show producer for former WENS morning co-host Mark Patrick. The one major change made by Knight was the fall 1992 replacement of news director Audrey Rochelle with Ann Craig. The remainder of Knight's three-year tenure at WENS was marked without further change in the weekday air schedule. In early 1992, David Christian left as WENS production director. Christian's role at the station was filled by Scott Robinson. Chuck Knight left for the Philadelphia market in the summer of 1994. He was replaced at WENS by respected Los Angeles broadcast programmer Greg Dunkin. In the fall of 1994, Dunkin renamed Lite Rock 97 as 97-1 WENS, the \\"Best Mix of the 70's, 80's, and the 90's.\\" Dunkin also eliminated Eric Garnes' long time \\"Night Lite Love Songs\\" program, extended the night shifts to 7 pm to midnight and midnight to 5:30 am. The popular Garnes remained as WENS night personality. Bonnell was moved to overnights. The only full-time lineup change for much of the remainder of the 1990s was the brief swap of Bernie Eagan and Scott Fischer. Eagan quickly found that he disliked early morning hours, and both Eagan and Fischer soon returned to their previous places on the WENS schedule. Ken Hayes had left as traffic anchor in the mid-1990s and was replaced by Paul Poteet in mornings and Rich McDonald in afternoons. McDonald also became the cornerstone of the WENS weekend lineup during that time. By the end of the 1990s, Scott Fischer had left the radio station. His role on the WENS morning show was filled by midday talent John Cinnamon, joining his wife Ann Craig. Cinnamon and Craig had married several years earlier. Cinnamon's midday shift was taken by weekend talent Michelle Rivers. Rivers has begun her broadcast career working in call-out research at WENS in the late 1980s. Changing times and changing tastes marked the change in century at WENS. In 2001, the \\"Ann and John\\" morning show was replaced by Bernie Eagan, paired with Stephanie Quinn. Quinn had worked at the station as Stephanie Smith in the late 1980s. Bernie's time in WENS morning drive would again be brief. It was announced that WENS had hired Julie Patterson and Steve King from crosstown WZPL. \\"Julie and Steve\\" sat out an extended non-compete and then replaced Eagan and Quinn in mornings. WENS marked the time with a \\"Free Julie and Steve\\" promotion. After Y2K, the station's positioning statement became \\"the Best Mix of the 80's, 90's, and Today.\\" In 1999, Bernie Eagan had begun hosting the \\"Friday Night Retro Show,\\" an early effort at 1980s intensive music programming. The show was a ratings success, forcing the creation of all 1980s weekends. Oddly, in 2002, WENS dropped all 1980s music from their playlist. The void in 1980s music programming allowed the creation of competing Retro 93.9 FM. At the same time, WENS dropped all mention of the heritage WENS call letters from station programming. Playing only music of the 1990s with currents and re-currents from the 2000s, and using the name \\"Mix 97-1,\\" WENS took a drop in both ratings and advertising revenue. By the time station management reversed the \\"Mix 97-1\\" decision, WENS was in a seemingly irreversible decline. In the fall of 2003, WENS fired their entire airstaff. Long time station veterans like Bernie Eagan and Eric Garnes had joined Scott Fischer and Scott Wheeler at sister soft AC WYXB B-105.7 FM. Twenty year station General Manager Christine Woodward-Duncan was replaced by Tom Severino. Program Director Greg Dunkin left to form his own consultancy. Then current WENS air-staffers like Julie Patterson and Steve King, Michelle Rivers and Chris Ott were replaced with the hybrid personality talk / modern AC music formatted \\"real 97.1 - real life. real music.\\" real 97.1 featured Ernie and Angela in the morning, along with Ann Duran in middays, Monique and the Man in afternoons, and the syndicated Alan Kabel show at nights. The real 97.1 format struggled to find audience during its eighteen-month existence. Near the end of real 97-1, Emmis added sister CHR WNOU Radio Now 93.1 morning show \\"Wank and O'Brien,\\" moving Ernie Mills to nights. In March 2005, WENS changed format and call letters to a country music format, in an attempt to compete with rival 95.5, WFMS. The new format, dubbed \\"Hank FM\\", accompanied the station's new call letters, WLHK, and its new slogan \\"[We/He] Plays Anything Country.\\" The \\"Wank and O'Brien\\" morning show and Ernie Mills in afternoons were the only elements of the old WENS to remain after the change.

Museum Campus is a park in Chicago that sits alongside Lake Michigan in Grant Park and encompasses five of the city's most notable attractions: the Adler Planetarium, America's first planetarium; the Shedd Aquarium; the Field Museum of Natural History; Soldier Field, home of the NFL Chicago Bears football team; and the Lakeside Center of McCormick Place. Museum Campus sits adjacent to Northerly Island along the waterfront. History Pedestrian tunnel in the Museum Campus running underneath Lake Shore DriveThe Museum Campus was created to transform the vicinity of three of the city's most notable museums – the Adler Planetarium, the Shedd Aquarium, and the Field Museum of Natural History – along with Soldier Field stadium, into a scenic pedestrian-friendly area. The area is landscaped with greenery and flora as well as jogging paths and walkways. A picturesque promenade along Solidarity Drive, an isthmus, links Northerly Island to the mainland. The drive itself is lined with a number of grand bronze monuments commemorating Kościuszko, Havliček, and Nicholas Copernicus, the last of which is a replica of a famous 19th-century work in Warsaw by Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. The Museum Campus opened on June 4, 1998, when the northbound lanes of Lake Shore Drive were moved west of Soldier Field following the route of the expressway's southbound lanes. By removing the roadway which bisected the area, Museum Campus was created into a green space for the enjoyment of both residents and tourists. In 2014, a consortium of museums in or near the University of Chicago, formed Museum Campus South. Also in 2014, filmmaker George Lucas selected Museum Campus as the location of the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, which would have cost an estimated $700 million, and expanded Museum Campus south along the city's waterfront. However, these plans were cancelled in June 2016 due to opposition from the Friends of the Parks advocacy group. In August 2016, in a partnership with the City of Chicago, the Chicago Parks District and Everywhere Wireless, Museum Campus joined many Chicago Beaches and Buckingham Fountain in providing free Wi-Fi to visitors.

During his lifetime, the company was one of the foremost lens manufacturers. The year after his death in 1859, his son-in-law John Henry Dallmeyer left the firm to establish his own optical company and the company was run by Ross's son, Thomas, and became known as Ross & Co. By the 1890s it was also making Zeiss and Goerz lenses under licence for sale in the UK and the British Empire. Ross patented a wide-angle lens design and Zeiss took this further to produce their EWA Protars. Before World War 1, Ross and Zeiss worked quite closely together, but at the outbreak of War the British Government put Ross in control of the newly opened Carl Zeiss binocular and optical factory in Mill Hill, London.

A man's access to these benefits may vary depending on how closely they match their society's ideal masculine norm. Academic studies of male privilege were a focus of feminist scholarship during the 1970s. These studies began by examining barriers to equity between the sexes. In later decades, researchers began to focus on the intersectionality and overlapping nature of privileges relating to sex, race, social class, sexual orientation, and other forms of social classification.  Overview  Special privileges and status are granted to males in patriarchal societies. These are societies defined by male supremacy, in which males hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property. With systemic subordination of women, males gain economic, political, social, educational, and practical advantages that are more or less unavailable to women. The long-standing and unquestioned nature of such patriarchal systems, reinforced over generations, tends to make privilege invisible to holders; it can lead males who benefit from such privilege to ascribe their special status to their own individual merits and achievements, rather than to unearned advantages. In the field of sociology, male privilege is seen as embedded in the structure of social institutions, as when men are often assigned authority over women in the workforce, and benefit from women's traditional caretaking role. Privileges can be classified as either positive or negative, depending on how they affect the rest of society. Women's studies scholar Peggy McIntosh writes: Positive advantages include having such things as adequate nutrition, shelter, and health care, whereas negative advantages accompanying male privilege include such things as the expectation that a man will have a better chance than a comparably qualified woman of being hired for a job, as well as being paid more than a woman for the same job. Scope The term \\"male privilege\\" does not apply to a solitary occurrence of the use of power, but rather describes one of many systemic power structures that are interdependent and interlinked throughout societies and cultures. Privilege is not shared equally by all males. Those who most closely match an ideal masculine norm benefit the most from privilege. In Western patriarchal societies this ideal has been described as being \\"white, heterosexual, stoic, wealthy, strong, tough, competitive, and autonomous\\". Men's studies scholars refer to this ideal masculine norm as hegemonic masculinity. While essentially all males benefit from privilege to some degree, those who visibly differ from the norm may not benefit fully in certain situations, especially in the company of other men that more closely match it. Men who have experienced bullying and domestic violence in youth, in particular, may not accept the idea that they are beneficiaries of privilege. Such forms of coercive violence are linked to the idea of toxic masculinity, a specific model of manhood that creates hierarchies of dominance in which some are favored and others are harmed. The invisibility of male privilege can be seen for instance in discussions of the gender pay gap in the United States; the gap is usually referred to by stating women's earnings as a percentage of men's. However, using women's pay as the baseline highlights the dividend that males receive as greater earnings (32% in 2005). In commerce, male dominance in the ownership and control of financial capital and other forms of wealth has produced disproportionate male influence over the working classes and the hiring and firing of employees. In addition, a disproportionate burden is placed upon women in employment when they are expected to be solely responsible for child care; they may be more likely to be fired or be denied advancement in their profession, thus putting them at an economic disadvantage relative to men. Scholarship The earliest academic studies of privilege appeared with feminist scholars' work in the area of women's studies during the 1970s. Such scholarship began by examining barriers to equity between the sexes. In later decades, researchers began to focus on the intersectionality and overlapping nature of privileges relating to sex, race, social class, sexual orientation, and other forms of social classification. Peggy McIntosh, one of the first feminist scholars to examine male privilege, wrote about both male privilege and white privilege, using the metaphor of the \\"invisible knapsack\\" to describe a set of advantages borne, often unaware and unacknowledged, by members of privileged groups. According to McIntosh, privilege is not a result of a concerted effort to oppress those of the opposite gender; however, the inherent benefits that men gain from the systemic bias put women at an innate disadvantage. The benefits of this unspoken privilege may be described as special provisions, tools, relationships, or various other opportunities. According to McIntosh, this privilege may actually negatively affect men's development as human beings, and few question that the existing structure of advantages may be challenged or changed. Efforts to examine the role of privilege in students' lives has become a regular feature of university education in North America. By drawing attention to the presence of privilege (including male, white, and other forms) in the lives of students, educators have sought to foster insights that can help students contribute to social justice. Such efforts include McIntosh's \\"invisible knapsack\\" model of privilege and the \\"Male Privilege Checklist\\". Cultural responses Many men have responded to discussions of male privilege by saying that they do not feel that they have been given any unearned advantages, such as in their struggles to find success in employment, education, or relationships. Advocates for men's rights and father's rights as well as anti-feminist men often accept that men's traditional roles are damaging to men but deny that men as a group have institutional power and privilege, and argue that men are now victims relative to women. Some have taken active roles in challenging oppressive sexism, arguing that male privilege is deeply linked to the oppression of women. They describe men's oppressive behaviors as cultural traits learned within patriarchal social systems, rather than inborn biological traits. Advocates within the broader men's movement oriented towards profeminism or anti-sexism argue that traditional gender roles harm both men and women. \\"Liberal\\" profeminism tends to stress the ways men suffer from these traditional roles, while more \\"radical\\" profeminism tends to emphasize male privilege and sexual inequality. Some men may also be advocates of women's rights but deny that their privilege as a whole is a part of the issue at hand. Preference of sons over daughters In both India and China, male offspring are often privileged and favored over female children. Some manifestations of son preference and the devaluation of women are eliminating unwanted daughters through neglect, maltreatment, abandonment, as well as female infanticide and feticide despite laws that prohibit infanticide and sex-selective pregnancy termination. In India some of these practices have contributed to skewed sex ratios in favor of male children at birth and in the first five years. Other examples of privileging male offspring are special \\"praying for a son\\" ceremonies during pregnancy, more ceremony and festivities following the birth of a boy, listing and introducing sons before daughters, and common felicitations that associate good fortune and well-being with the number of sons. Reasons given for preferring sons to daughters include sons' role in religious family rites, which daughters are not permitted to perform, and the belief that sons are permanent members of the birth family whereas daughters belong to their husband's family after marriage in accordance with patrilocal tradition. Other reasons include patrilineal customs whereby only sons can carry on the family name, the obligation to pay dowry to a daughter's husband or his family, and the expectation that sons will support their birth parents financially while it is regarded as undesirable or shameful to receive financial support from daughters.

Rain follows the plow is the conventional name for a now-discredited theory of climatology that was popular throughout the American West and Australia during the late 19th century. The phrase was employed as a summation of the theory by Charles Dana Wilber: > God speed the plow. ... By this wonderful provision, which is only man's > mastery over nature, the clouds are dispensing copious rains ... [the plow] > is the instrument which separates civilization from savagery; and converts a > desert into a farm or garden. ... To be more concise, Rain follows the > plow.\\"Rain Follows the Plow\\", Episode Seven, The West, PBS The basic premise of the theory was that human habitation and agriculture through homesteading effected a permanent change in the climate of arid and semi-arid regions, making these regions more humid. The theory was widely promoted in the 1870s as a justification for the settlement of the Great Plains, a region previously known as the \\"Great American Desert\\". It was also used to justify the expansion of wheat growing on marginal land in South Australia during the same period.Jared Diamond, Collapse, page 398, Penguin Books, 2005, . According to the theory, increased human settlement in the region and cultivation of soil would result in an increased rainfall over time, rendering the land more fertile and lush as the population increased. As later historical records of rainfall indicated, the theory was based on faulty evidence arising from brief climatological fluctuations that happened to coincide with settlement, an example of the logical fallacy that correlation means causation. The theory was later refuted by climatologists and is now definitively regarded as pure superstition. North America The theory arose in the late 1860s and 1870s during the westward expansion of European-American settlement west of the Missouri River and across the 100th meridian west. This was the traditional boundary line between the humid and semi-arid portions of central North America. Specifically, in the early part of the decade, white settlement had spread into central and western Nebraska along the Platte River. Emigrants on the Oregon Trail began reporting that the land in western Nebraska, previously known for its yellowed, dry vegetation during the summer, had seemingly become green. Out of this evidence, some scientists concluded that the apparent increase in rain was due to the settlement and the effects of cultivation. One of the most prominent exponents of the theory in the United States was Cyrus Thomas, who was a noted ethnologist and entomologist but only an amateur climatologist at best. After studying the recent history of Colorado, he concluded that the increase in moisture was permanent, and that it coincided exactly with the first settlers' cultivating of the land. Other prominent advocates of the theory were Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden, the noted geographer who had explored and surveyed parts of the Rocky Mountains of Colorado; Samuel Aughey, a professor at the University of Nebraska; and Charles Dana Wilber, an amateur scientist and author. Thomas and other climatologists offered a variety of explanations for the theory. A common idea was that the plowing of the soil for cultivation exposed the soil's moisture to the sky. In addition, newly planted trees and shrubs increased rainfall as well, as did smoke from trains, or even the metal in the rails or the telegraph wires. Another hypothesis stated that the increased vibrations in the atmosphere due to human activity created additional clouds, from which rain fell. This idea led to the widespread dynamiting of the air across the Great Plains in the 1870s. The theory was widely embraced in its day, not only by scientists, but land speculators and emigrants. Some historians have argued that the theory was embraced readily as an outgrowth of Manifest Destiny, the idea that the United States had a mission to expand, spreading its form of democracy and freedom. The theory is regarded as partially responsible for the rapid settlement of the Great Plains in the later 19th century. In 'The Great Valleys and Prairies of Nebraska and the Northwest', published in 1881, Charles Dana Wilber wrote: > In this miracle of progress, the plow was the unerring prophet, the > procuring cause, not by any magic or enchantment, not by incantations or > offerings, but instead by the sweat of his face toiling with his hands, man > can persuade the heavens to yield their treasures of dew and rain upon the > land he has chosen for his dwelling... . ..The raindrop never fails to fall > and answer to the imploring power or prayer of labor.cited in Which Old West > and Whose?, Stanley K. Schultz and William P. Tishler William Gilpin, the first territorial governor of Colorado and an aide to President Abraham Lincoln, was a proponent of this theory. Gilpin was a strong believer in the idea of Manifest Destiny. One of his books was called The Mission of the North American People. He strongly promoted western settlement and invoked this theory as one of his reasons for people to migrate west. Climatologists now understand that increased vegetation and urbanization can result in increased precipitation. The effect, however, is local in scope, with increased rainfall typically coming at the expense of rainfall in nearby areas. It cannot result in a climatological change for an entire region. They also understand that the Great Plains had had a wetter than usual few seasons while this theory was developed and increasing settlement were both taking place. When normal arid conditions returned, homesteaders suffered. In 2007, Richard Raddatz, a climatologist at the University of Winnipeg, published results of his studies on the conversion of Canadian grasslands to cropland. His theory is that, because corn crops transpire moisture into the atmosphere at a faster rate than the grass they have replaced, crops can generate storms and intensify the season during which water can cycle through the atmosphere. Observed trends of Midwest summertime cooling and increased rainfall over the last third of the 20th century have been linked to agricultural practices in the arid Great Plains, in an inversion of the Dust Bowl scenario. Increased precipitation and humidity may cause the downward trend in Midwestern average daytime highs, since humid air takes more energy to heat to a given temperature than dry air. In turn, the increase in Midwestern rainfall may be driven by the large increase in land under irrigation in the Plains over the 20th century. Irrigation water enters the atmosphere through evaporation and plant transpiration, and then falls as rain over the downwind Midwest.Crop irrigation could be cooling Midwest, Sid Perkins, ScienceNews Jan 22, 2010  Australia  Kanyaka sheep farm (Flinders Ranges, South Australia) was built at a high cost in the 1850s and abandoned after the drought of 1869. At the same time that the theory existed in North America, it also existed on the farming frontier in South Australia. There was a spread of farming from the area near Adelaide northwards to areas of much lower rainfall. In South Australia, George Goyder warned as early as 1865, in his famous report on farming in the state, that rain would not follow the plow. Despite this, until further droughts in the 1880s, farmers talked of cultivating cereal crops up to the Northern Territory border (latitude 26 degrees South). Today, however, grain crops still do not grow further north than Quorn (latitude ~32 degrees South), as advised by Goyder's original report.

The Blackghost AUV is designed to undertake an underwater assault course autonomously with no outside control. Pluto Plus AUV for underwater mine identification and destruction. From Norwegian minehunter KNM Hinnøy An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is a robot that travels underwater without requiring input from an operator. AUVs constitute part of a larger group of undersea systems known as unmanned underwater vehicles, a classification that includes non-autonomous remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) - controlled and powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using remote control. In military applications an AUV is more often referred to as an unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV). Underwater gliders are a subclass of AUVs. History The first AUV was developed at the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington as early as 1957 by Stan Murphy, Bob Francois and later on, Terry Ewart. The \\"Special Purpose Underwater Research Vehicle\\", or SPURV, was used to study diffusion, acoustic transmission, and submarine wakes. Other early AUVs were developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1970s. One of these is on display in the Hart Nautical Gallery in MIT. At the same time, AUVs were also developed in the Soviet UnionAutonomous Vehicles at the Institute of Marine Technology Problems (although this was not commonly known until much later). Applications Until relatively recently, AUVs have been used for a limited number of tasks dictated by the technology available. With the development of more advanced processing capabilities and high yield power supplies, AUVs are now being used for more and more tasks with roles and missions constantly evolving. Commercial The oil and gas industry uses AUVs to make detailed maps of the seafloor before they start building subsea infrastructure; pipelines and sub sea completions can be installed in the most cost effective manner with minimum disruption to the environment. The AUV allows survey companies to conduct precise surveys of areas where traditional bathymetric surveys would be less effective or too costly. Also, post-lay pipe surveys are now possible, which includes pipeline inspection. The use of AUVs for pipeline inspection and inspection of underwater man-made structures is becoming more common. Research A University of South Florida researcher deploys Tavros02, a solar-powered \\"tweeting\\" AUV (SAUV) Scientists use AUVs to study lakes, the ocean, and the ocean floor. A variety of sensors can be affixed to AUVs to measure the concentration of various elements or compounds, the absorption or reflection of light, and the presence of microscopic life. Examples include conductivity-temperature-depth sensors (CTDs), fluorometers, and pH sensors. Additionally, AUVs can be configured as tow-vehicles to deliver customized sensor packages to specific locations. The Applied Physics Lab at the University of Washington has been creating iterations of its Seaglider AUV platform since the 1950s. Though iRobot Seaglider was originally designed for oceanographic research, in recent years it has seen much interest from organizations such as the U.S. Navy or the oil and gas industry. The fact that these autonomous gliders are relatively inexpensive to manufacture and operate is indicative of most AUV platforms that will see success in myriad applications.http://www.apl.washington.edu/project/project.php?id=seaglider_auv An example of an AUV interacting directly with its environment is the Crown- Of-Thorns Starfish Robot (COTSBot) created by the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). The COTSBot finds and eradicates crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci), a species that damages the Great Barrier Reef. It uses a neural network to identify the starfish and injects bile salts to kill it.Dayoub, F., Dunbabin, M. and Corke, P. (2015). Robotic detection and tracking of Crown-of-thorns starfish.

Several competitions exist which allow these homemade AUVs to compete against each other while accomplishing objectives.Designspark ChipKIT Challenge (this competition is now closed)Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Competition Like their commercial brethren, these AUVs can be fitted with cameras, lights, or sonar. As a consequence of limited resources and inexperience, hobbyist AUVs can rarely compete with commercial models on operational depth, durability, or sophistication. Finally, these hobby AUVs are usually not oceangoing, being operated most of the time in pools or lake beds. A simple AUV can be constructed from a microcontroller, PVC pressure housing, automatic door lock actuator, syringes, and a DPDT relay.Osaka University NAOE Mini Underwater Glider (MUG) for Education Some participants in competitions create open- source designs.

Military applications MK 18 MOD 1 Swordfish UUV Mk 18 Mod 2 Kingfish UUV Kingfish UUV launch The U.S. Navy Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUV) Master PlanDepartment of the Navy, The Navy Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUV) Master Plan, 9 Nov 2004. identified the following UUV's missions: * Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance * Mine countermeasures * Anti-submarine warfare * Inspection/identification * Oceanography * Communication/navigation network nodes * Payload delivery * Information operations * Time-critical strikes The Navy Master Plan divided all UUVs into four classes: * Man-portable vehicle class: 25–100 lb displacement; 10–20 hours endurance; launched from small water craft manually (i.e., Mk 18 Mod 1 Swordfish UUV) * Lightweight vehicle class: up to 500 lb displacement, 20–40 hours endurance; launched from RHIB using launch-retriever system or by cranes from surface ships (i.e., Mk 18 Mod 2 Kingfish UUV) * Heavyweight vehicle class: up to 3,000 lb displacement, 40–80 hours endurance, launched from submarines * Large vehicle class: up to 10 long tons displacement; launched from surface ships and submarines  Vehicle designs  Hundreds of different AUVs have been designed over the past 50 or so years, but only a few companies sell vehicles in any significant numbers. There are around 10 companies that sell AUVs on the international market, including Kongsberg Maritime, Hydroid (now a wholly owned subsidiary of Kongsberg Maritime\\"KONGSBERG acquires Hydroid LLC\\" Kongsberg - Hydroid, 2007), Bluefin Robotics, Teledyne Gavia (previously known as Hafmynd), International Submarine Engineering (ISE) Ltd, Atlas Elektronik, and OceanScan. Vehicles range in size from man portable lightweight AUVs to large diameter vehicles of over 10 metres length. Large vehicles have advantages in terms of endurance and sensor payload capacity; smaller vehicles benefit significantly from lower logistics (for example: support vessel footprint; launch and recovery systems). Some manufacturers have benefited from domestic government sponsorship including Bluefin and Kongsberg. The market is effectively split into three areas: scientific (including universities and research agencies), commercial offshore (oil and gas, etc.) and military application (mine countermeasures, battle space preparation). The majority of these roles utilize a similar design and operate in a cruise (torpedo-type) mode. They collect data while following a preplanned route at speeds between 1 and 4 knots. Commercially available AUVs include various designs, such as the small REMUS 100 AUV originally developed by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the US and now produced commercially by Hydroid, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Kongsberg Maritime); the larger HUGIN 1000 and 3000 AUVs developed by Kongsberg Maritime and Norwegian Defence Research Establishment; the Bluefin Robotics vehicles and the International Submarine Engineering Ltd. Most AUVs follow the traditional torpedo shape as this is seen as the best compromise between size, usable volume, hydrodynamic efficiency and ease of handling. There are some vehicles that make use of a modular design, enabling components to be changed easily by the operators. The market is evolving and designs are now following commercial requirements rather than being purely developmental. Upcoming designs include hover-capable AUVs for inspection and light-intervention (primarily for the offshore energy applications), and hybrid AUV/ROV designs that switch between roles as part of their mission profile. Again, the market will be driven by financial requirements and the aim to save money and expensive ship time. Today, while most AUVs are capable of unsupervised missions, most operators remain within range of acoustic telemetry systems in order to maintain a close watch on their investment. This is not always possible. For example, Canada has recently taken delivery of two AUVs (ISE Explorers) to survey the sea floor underneath the Arctic ice in support of their claim under Article 76 of the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea. Also, ultra-low-power, long-range variants such as underwater gliders are becoming capable of operating unattended for weeks or months in littoral and open ocean areas, periodically relaying data by satellite to shore, before returning to be picked up. As of 2008, a new class of AUVs are being developed, which mimic designs found in nature. Although most are currently in their experimental stages, these biomimetic (or bionic) vehicles are able to achieve higher degrees of efficiency in propulsion and maneuverability by copying successful designs in nature. Two such vehicles are Festo's AquaJelly (AUV)\\"AquaJelly\\" Festo Corporate, 2008 and the EvoLogics BOSS Manta Ray. Sensors AUVs carry sensors to navigate autonomously and map features of the ocean. Typical sensors include compasses, depth sensors, sidescan and other sonars, magnetometers, thermistors and conductivity probes. Some AUVs are outfitted with biological sensors including fluorometers (also known as chlorophyll sensors), turbidity sensors, and sensors to measure pH, and amounts of dissolved oxygen. A demonstration at Monterey Bay, in California, in September 2006, showed that a diameter AUV can tow a -long hydrophone array while maintaining a cruising speed. Navigation Radio waves cannot penetrate water very far, so as soon as an AUV dives it loses its GPS signal. Therefore, a standard way for AUVs to navigate underwater is through dead reckoning. Navigation can however be improved by using an underwater acoustic positioning system. When operating within a net of sea floor deployed baseline transponders this is known as LBL navigation. When a surface reference such as a support ship is available, ultra-short baseline (USBL) or short-baseline (SBL) positioning is used to calculate where the sub- sea vehicle is relative to the known (GPS) position of the surface craft by means of acoustic range and bearing measurements. To improve estimation of its position, and reduce errors in dead reckoning (which grow over time), the AUV can also surface and take its own GPS fix. Between position fixes and for precise maneuvering, an Inertial Navigation System on board the AUV calculates through dead reckoning the AUV position, acceleration, and velocity. Estimates can be made using data from an Inertial Measurement Unit, and can be improved by adding a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), which measures the rate of travel over the sea/lake floor. Typically, a pressure sensor measures the vertical position (vehicle depth), although depth and altitude can also be obtained from DVL measurements. These observations are filtered to determine a final navigation solution. Propulsion There are a couple of propulsion techniques for AUVs. Some of them use a brushed or brush-less electric motor, gearbox, Lip seal, and a propeller which may be surrounded by a nozzle or not. All of these parts embedded in the AUV construction are involved in propulsion. Other vehicles use a thruster unit to maintain the modularity. Depending on the need, the thruster may be equipped with a nozzle for propeller collision protection or to reduce noise submission, or it may be equipped with a direct drive thruster to keep the efficiency at the highest level and the noises at the lowest level. Advanced AUV thrusters have a redundant shaft sealing system to guarantee a proper seal of the robot even if one of the seals fails during the mission. Underwater gliders do not directly propel themselves. By changing their buoyancy and trim, they repeatedly sink and ascend; airfoil \\"wings\\" convert this up-and-down motion to forward motion. The change of buoyancy is typically done through the use of a pump that can take in or push out water. The vehicle's pitch can be controlled by changing the center of mass of the vehicle. For Slocum gliders this is done internally by moving the batteries, which are mounted on a screw. Because of their low speed and low-power electronics, the energy required to cycle trim states is far less than for regular AUVs, and gliders can have endurances of months and transoceanic ranges.  Communications  Since radio waves do not propagate well under water, many AUV's incorporate Acoustic Modems to enable remote command and control. These modems typically utilize proprietary communications techniques and modulation schemes. In 2017 NATO ratified the ANEP-87 JANUS standard for subsea communications. This standard allows for 80 BPS communications links with flexible and extensible message formatting.  Power  Most AUVs in use today are powered by rechargeable batteries (lithium ion, lithium polymer, nickel metal hydride etc.), and are implemented with some form of Battery Management System. Some vehicles use primary batteries which provide perhaps twice the endurance—at a substantial extra cost per mission. A few of the larger vehicles are powered by aluminum based semi-fuel cells, but these require substantial maintenance, require expensive refills and produce waste product that must be handled safely. An emerging trend is to combine different battery and power systems with supercapacitors.

Life and career Rocque was born in France in about 1704, one of four children of a Huguenot family who subsequently fled first to Geneva, and then, probably in 1709, to England. He became a godfather in 1728, which suggests he was at least twenty- one years old by that time. In addition to his work as surveyor and mapmaker, Rocque was an engraver and map-seller. He was also involved in some way in gardening as a young man, living with his brother Bartholomew, who was a landscape gardener, and producing plans for parterres, perhaps recording pre- existing designs, but few details of this work are known. Rocque produced engraved plans of the gardens at Wrest Park (1735), Claremont (1738), Charles Hamilton's naturalistic landscape garden at Painshill Park, Surrey (1744), Wanstead House (1745) and Wilton House (1746). Rocque is now remembered principally for his Map of London. He began work on this in 1737 and it was published in 24 printed sheets in 1746. It was by far the most detailed map of London published up to that time, and remains an important historical resource. The map of London and his other maps brought him an appointment as cartographer to Frederick, Prince of Wales in 1751. A fire in 1750 destroyed his premises and stock, but by 1753 he was employing ten draughtsmen, and The Small British Atlas: Being a New set of Maps of all the Counties of England and Wales appeared. There was a second edition in 1762. He also surveyed and published maps of Middlesex, Oxford, Berkshire, & Buckinghamshire in 1760. Rocque's Map of London, 1746 Time in Dublin Rocque spent six years in Dublin (1754–60), when he produced a number of maps of the Irish capital, as well as county maps of Dublin and Armagh, city maps of Kilkenny and Cork, and a series of sumptuously illustrated manuscript surveys of the estates of the then Earl of Kildare. His 1756 4-sheet Exact Survey of Dublin featured on an Irish ten pound banknote. The hinterland of Dublin was covered by Rocque's A Survey of the City Harbour Bay and Environs of Dublin, published in four sheets, in 1758. These extended as far as Skerries and Cardy Rocks to the north, Carton House to the west, Blessington to the south-west and Enniskerry to the south. Personal life Rocque married twice.

Hiebert's Private Members Bill, C-377, requiring labour unions to publicly disclose their finances was signed into law by Governor-General David Johnston on June 30, 2015 - the final piece of legislation to become law during the 41st Parliament. That bill was no longer in force as of December 21, 2015 and the current Justin Trudeau government introduced legislation to repeal the law, which was repealed on June 19, 2017. Hiebert chose not to run again in the 2015 General Election, telling the Peace Arch News that he \\"never intended to become a career politician\\" and returned to his private business pursuits in the Surrey, BC community where he lives. Political positions Russ Hiebert was an opponent of the Liberal-proposed Carbon Tax of 2009, referring to it as \\"job-killing\\" and \\"irresponsible\\" during question period.

He was the fifth and youngest son of Haji Jabir Khan Ibn Merdaw, and his mother, Sheikha Noura, was the daughter of Talal Bin Alwan, the Sheikh of the powerful Bawi tribe. He was born on 18 August 1863, in the village Qout Al Zain in the district of Abu Khasib in Basra and he ascended to the throne on 2 June 1897 upon the death of his brother and predecessor, Sheikh Miz'al Khan ibn Haji Jabir Khan. Historical background On 2 June 1897, Khaz'al inherited the Emirate of Mohammerah. The Emirate, although within the Persian Empire, was autonomous and allowed to conduct its own affairs. Throughout Khaz’al's reign (1897-1925), he was one of the most important political figures in the Persian Gulf and a prominent supporter of Britain's presence in the region. Although never a part of the British Empire, the Gulf had been effectively incorporated into the British imperial system since the early 19th century. The conclusion of treaties and agreements with the region's various tribal rulers was one of the central means by which Britain enforced its hegemonic presence, and Khaz’al was no exception to this trend. Indeed, Khaz’al actively fostered close relations with Britain in an attempt to gain their assurance that in the event of the Qajar Empire collapsing or being overthrown, Arabistan would be formally recognised by Britain as an independent state with him as its ruler. After oil was discovered by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (the forerunner of BP) in Arabistan in 1908, Britain strengthened its ties to Khaz’al further. In 1910 he was made a Knight Commander of the Indian Empire. During his reign Sheikh Khaz'al held a percentage of shares in BP. Those shares were later taken by force by Reza Khan. Khaz’al sought to prove his loyalty to Britain in return and he acted as a key ally throughout the First World War during which he suppressed a pro- Ottoman tribal uprising in his domains. Khaz'al was also the darling of many Sunnite Iraqi nationalists, who sought to foment dissent among Iran's Arab population by referring to Khuzestan as Arabestān and glorifying Khaz'al as its independent \\"Sultan\\". Khaz'al became a strong candidate for the throne of Iraq, but later withdrew his candidacy in favour of Faisal I of Iraq. The tribal leaders of the Bani Kaab, an Arab tribe which had originally come from the area of what is now Kuwait in the 16th century, had often been the Imperial-appointed tax farmers of Arabistan for many years after the fall of the Mush'ashaiya. The Bani Kaab were the largest and most powerful tribe in the province. In the early 19th century the Bani Kaab had dissolved into a number of rival clans that often clashed and feuded with each other. Of these factions, the Muhaisin clan, led by Haji Jabir Khan Ibn Merdaw, became the strongest and under his leadership the Bani Kaab were reunified under a single authority, the capital of Arabistan being moved from the village of Fallahiyah to the flourishing port city of Mohammerah. Unlike previous rulers of Arabistan, Jabir maintained law and order, and established Mohammerah as a free port and sheikhdom, of which he was Sheikh. Jabir also became the Imperial-appointed governor-general of the province. Rise to power After Jabir's death in 1881, his elder son, Maz'al, took over as tribal leader and Sheikh of Mohammerah, as well as the provincial governor-general, which was confirmed by an Imperial firman (executive order). However, in June 1897 Maz'al was killed. Some accounts state that he was assassinated by his younger brother, Khaz'al, while others state that this was done by a palace guard under orders from Khaz'al. Thereafter Khaz'al assumed his position as Sheikh of Mohammerah, proclaiming himself not only the leader of the Bani Kaab, but also the ruler of the entire province. He then appointed his sons to the governorships of the various cities, towns and villages within his control, including Naseriyeh. Unlike his brother, Khaz'al had ambition. He had great vision for the future of Arabistan and the Arabs. His rule in Arabistan was \\"Supreme and unhindered\\". The Anglo-Persian Oil Company The oil industry owed its early success to Sheikh Khaz'al. Once oil was discovered in Masjed Soleyman in 1908, by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC), later BP, Khaz'al's ties to Britain strengthened. In 1909, the British government asked Percy Cox, British resident to Bushehr, to negotiate an agreement with Khaz'al for APOC to obtain a site on Abadan Island for a refinery, depot, storage tanks, and other operations. The refinery was built and began operating in 1912. Khaz'al was knighted in 1910 and supported Britain in World War I. Following the discovery of oil in Arabistan-controlled territory, the British moved quickly to establish control over the vast oil resources in the province, which culminated in the foundation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1909. The British established a treaty with Khaz'al, whereby in exchange for their guaranteed support and protection against any external attack, he would also guarantee to maintain internal security and not interfere with the process of oil extraction. As part of the treaty they were given a monopoly of drilling in the province in return for an annual payment to Khaz'al, though the profits of the company vastly exceeded the annual payments.  Sheikh Khaz'al turns down the throne of Kuwait  In 1920, the Sheikh of Kuwait, Salim Al Mubarak Al Sabah, ambushed Ibn Saud's men over a border dispute between Kuwait and Najd. When Percy Cox was informed of this event, he sent a letter to Khaz'al offering the Kuwaiti throne to either him or one of his heirs, knowing that Khaz'al would be a wiser ruler. Khaz'al, who considered the Al Sabah as his own family, replied \\"Do you expect me to allow the stepping down of Al Mubarak from the throne of Kuwait? Do you think I can accept this?\\" He then asked:  Conflict with Reza Khan and downfall  In November 1923, when Khaz’al Khan had seen Ahmad Shah Qajar off, as he was crossing the border for Europe, the Emperor had told him about his fears of Reza Khan's ambitions in the same way as he had spoken openly to Percy Loraine. Then came the Shah's telegram of April 1924 about his loss of confidence in Reza Khan. In the following summer, Khaz’al brought together some regional magnates and tribal heads - the Vali of Poshtkuh, heads of the Khamseh federation of tribes, and many of the local Arab tribal leaders - in a coalition to resist Reza. They described themselves as the Committee of the Rising for Happiness, and sent telegrams and statements to Tehran. Their statements demanded constitutional government and the return of the Shah, who they said had been forced to remain in Europe. They also attacked military violations of the people's rights in the provinces, and ‘the massacres of Loristan’; demanded Reza Khan's dismissal; and described the Prince Regent, Ali Reza Khan Azod al-Molk, as the legitimate fount of authority. It was all in the name of the law, justice and the constitution, and ‘in the illustrious name of His Imperial Majesty Soltan Ahmad Shah, the constitutional monarch’. The committee sought to defend and protect Constitutionalism, and stop the traitors and criminals freely dispensing with it and re-establishing the apparatus of arbitrary rule and injustice once again ... and stop Reza Khan from trampling the principles of democratic government under foot by arbitrary government.\\" The Prince Regent wrote an encouraging letter to Khaz’al, all in the name of the Shah and for protection of the constitution, and said that the bearer would discuss matters with the Shaikh in detail. The Shah and the court did not have the courage to commit themselves firmly to such a movement, but would go along with it if there was a very good change of success. Reza Khan subsequently sent him a bombastic tactless telegram, after which the Sheikh expressed his determination to overthrow Reza Khan or perish in the attempt. He declared that he would abandon his defensive measures only if Reza agreed to the following: > (i) to give written guarantees regarding the safety of life and property of > those who were helping the Sheikh - especially the Bakhtiari Amir Mujahid. > (ii) to withdraw all troops from Arabistan including Bebehan; (iii) to > cancel the revenue settlement of the previous year and return to the pre-war > basis; and (iv) to give a more specific confirmation of his firmans. On > September 13th the British Political Resident was told to convey a message > to Reza Khan to accept Khaz'al's conditions. In the meantime, the Political Resident had interviewed the Sheikh, his second son (Sheikh Abdul Hamid), the Bakhtiari Amir Mujahid and Colonel Riza Quli Khan (who had replaced Colonel Baqir Khan at Shushtar but who had apparently thrown in his lot with the Sheikh); all declared that no peace with Reza Khan was possible; the Sheikh had telegraphed to the Majlis explaining that his opposition was to Reza Khan personally and that it was hoped to persuade the Shah to return. On September 16 the Sheikh had also addressed a telegram to the foreign legations in Tehran in the nature of a proclamation against Reza Khan, who was described as a usurper and a transgressor of the Persian Empire. Reza sent a telegram to Khaz’al that stating that he should either apologise to him and relent publicly, or take the full consequences. Khaz’al and his remaining associates could muster an army of 25,000 men, which was no less than Reza Khan could throw in the region at the time. In fact the army he had amassed at the foot of the Loristan elevations was 15,000 strong. But Khaz’al did not dare to go into action without British approval. The British government was in no mood to go to war on Khaz’al's behalf. Loraine convinced Khaz’al to desist and to apologize to Reza Khan. In return, he promised to intervene with Reza Khan to halt the advance of his troops into Arabistan. The Shaikh sent an apology, but, realizing that the danger had passed, Reza Khan paid little attention to Loraine's representations on the Shaikh's behalf. He let the troops pour into Arabistan, and demanded that Khaz’al should surrender unconditionally and go straight to Tehran. The Foreign Office was very unhappy at Reza Khan's intransigence. In the presence of Loraine, Khaz’al and Reza met and even swore an oath of friendship on the Qur’an. The Khaz'aliyah Yacht, where Khaz'al was Kidnapped, near Qasr Al-Failiyah (Failiyah Palace) in MohammerahAfter a short while, Reza broke all his pledges. In April 1925, he ordered one of his commanders, who had a friendly relationship with Khaz'al, to meet Khaz'al. The commander, General Fazlollah Zahedi, accompanied by several government officials, met with Khaz'al and spent an evening with him on board his yacht, anchored in the Shatt al-Arab river by his palace in Failiyeh near the city of Mohammerah. Later that evening several gunboats, sent by Reza Khan, stealthily made their way next to the yacht, which was then immediately boarded by fifty Persian troops. The soldiers kidnapped Khaz'al and took him by motorboat down the river to Mohammerah, where a car was waiting to take him to the military base in Ahwaz. From there he was taken to Dezful, along with his son and heir, and then to the city of Khorramabad in Lorestan, and then eventually to Tehran. Upon his arrival, Khaz'al was warmly greeted and well received by Reza Khan, who assured him that his problems would be quickly settled, and that in the meantime, he would be treated very well. However, many of his personal assets in Arabistan were quickly liquidated and his properties eventually came under the domain of the Imperial government after Reza Khan was crowned the new Shah. The emirate was abolished and the provincial authority took full control of regional affairs. Khaz'al spent the rest of his life under virtual house arrest, unable to travel beyond Tehran's city limits. He was able to retain ownership of his properties in Kuwait and Iraq, where he was exempted from taxation. In May 1936, while alone in his house, as earlier in the day his servants had been taken to court by the police, he was murdered by one of the guards stationed outside his house under direct orders from Reza Shah.  Freemasonry  A photograph of Khaz'al wearing Masonic regalia Sheikh Khaz'al was an active Freemason and a recipient of many high Masonic honours. Up until his death, Sheikh Khaz'al was the most influential of all Masons of the Middle East. It is not clear when exactly Sheikh Khaz'al joined Freemasonry. What is known, is that he was the first Freemason among the inhabitants of the Persian Gulf, and that he became the Grand Master of Freemasonry in all Mesopotamia. It is likely that the East India Co. established the first Masonic lodge in the area and that Sheikh Khaz'al became its first chairman. A secret document found after the seizure of Masonic lodges in Egypt was the agenda for al-Abbasi Lodge No. 223 of Cairo for its meeting of 16 December 1923. One of the items discussed the subject of presenting Sheikh Khaz'al, the chairman of 'Khaz'al' lodge, and the regional Grand Master of Mesopotamia, with a decoration in recognition of his valuable services to Freemasonry. \\" The bestowal of honours to all of the Brothers mentioned, in recognition of their great services: Firstly - His Greatness, the Sardar Aqdas, Ruler of Arabistan and Prince of Nuyan, respected Brother, Khaz'al Khan Sultan of Mohammerah, and Chairman of the Khaz'al Khan Lodge and Provincial Grand Master of Mesopotamia...\\"  Humanitarian acts = Chaldean victims of the Ottoman Empire  Sheikh Khaz'al Bin Jabir (centre) with Sir Hugh Bell (right) and Talib Al Naqib (Left). In October 1914, the Assyrian genocide occurred whereby thousands of Chaldeans were killed or deported by the Ottoman Empire. After having experienced such atrocities on the hands of the Ottomans, the Chaldean Catholics began to migrate away from their homeland, in search of somewhere safer. Some of these emigrants found their way to the city of Ahwaz where, > \\"...under the protective shadow of His Highness the Sardar Aqdas… they found > refugee, and when their numbers increased, they approached His Highness > asking for a plot of land that they may build a church and a school to bring > up their children and he accepted with what he promised of the welcoming of > the heart and the tolerance of the palm and he granted them the land and he > provided them endowment. The Chaldeans had found in Ahwaz justice and safety > and were envied by their brothers who had not emigrated.\\" Pope Benedict XV When the Patriarch of Babylon for the Chaldean Catholics, Emmanuel Joseph saw what had been done, in the year 1920, he decided to repeat what he had seen to Pope Benedict XV. He explained that those of his spiritual children who had remained happy in the East were the ones who emigrated to Ahwaz and lived under the shadow of the Sardar Aqdas. The Pope was moved by the benevolence of Sheikh Khaz’al Khan towards those who were distressed amongst the children of the church and he granted him the Order of St Gregory the Great of the rank of Knight Commander, announcing his thanks and his acknowledgment of \\"...the grace of this great and generous Arab King\\".  King Faisal I attempts to kidnap Sheikh Khaz’al from Tehran  Sheikh Khaz'al and King Faisal I in Basra The first of a number of attempts to rescue Khaz’al was in 1927 by King Faisal I of Iraq. Faisal felt that the arrest of Khaz’al and the injustice of the Persian government towards Arabistan were severe and cruel. Moreover, Faisal felt that he was in debt to Khaz’al for withdrawing his candidacy for the throne of Iraq. For Faisal, after being deposed from the Kingship of Syria, was a King without a country. He viewed this mission not only as an act of loyalty, but more importantly, of duty. Faisal informed Nuri al-Said of his plan to which the latter recommended using diplomacy rather than physical intervention. Meanwhile, al-Said, without Faisal's knowledge, informed Henry Dobbs, the British Ambassador to Iraq, of the latters intentions of kidnapping Khaz’al. Dobbs immediately met with Faisal and warned him of the consequences of such an act, stating that ‘His Majesty's Government’ would take a firm stand against him. \\"Do not play with fire, King Faisal,\\" warned Dobbs.  Khaz'al in literature = Abd al-Masīh al-Antākī in The Kitāb Riyāḍ Al-Khazʻalīyah Fī al-Siyāsah Al-Insānīyah (The Garden of Khaz’al in Human Politics).  The official author of the book is Khaz’al, but it was written by the Syrian poet and journalist, Abdul Maseeh al Antaki. Born in Aleppo, with Greek origins, he emigrated to Egypt and travelled the Arab world. He established the Al Omran newspaper in Egypt and became a frequent figure in Khaz’al's court. He explains, in the introduction of the book, his objective: > “...and here I am mentioning His Highness the Sardar Aqdas, so that the > reader my learn that His Highness the author is the bearer of the sword and > the pen, and that amongst the Arab Kings and Princes he is the greatest > King, the most magnificent Prince, the respectable gentleman, the most > knowledgeable of the knowledgeable, and I am full of what I have seen myself > and have known after my long mission and my study, unexaggerated in my > story, and not passed the line of rationality and guidance, so that the > Arabs may know that His Highness the Sovereign the Mu’iz has combined > between determination and knowledge, and has been struck by both by the most > blessed arrow, that is how that Kings and Princes should be, if they sought > to revive the glory of their forefathers.”  Ameen Rihani in Molouk el-Arab (Kings of the Arabs)  > \\"Mention one who does not know him.

Her career bridged traditional and modern forms of folk music. In her youth she learned folksongs in the traditional way (orally, from her family and members of her community); and in adulthood she became a successful modern folksinger, promulgating songs in public through concerts and recordings. She was called by some the \\"Mother of Folk\\". Out of Kentucky Jean Ritchie was born to Abigail (née Hall) and Balis W. Ritchie of Viper, an unincorporated community in Perry County in the Cumberland Mountains of south eastern Kentucky. The Ritchies of Perry County were one of the two \\"great ballad-singing families\\" of Kentucky celebrated among folk song scholars (the other was the Combs family of adjacent Knott County, whose repertoire formed the basis of the first scholarly work on the British ballads in America, a doctoral thesis by Professor Josiah Combs of Berea College for the Sorbonne University published in Paris in 1925.)Alan Lomax, foreword to Jean Ritchie, Folk Songs of the Southern Appalachians as Sung by Jean Ritchie, forewords by Alan Lomax and Ron Pen (University of Kentucky Press, 2nd edition, 1997). p. 1. The book by Combs, who was a specialist in the dulcimer, was translated into English as a monograph by D. K. Wilgus in 1967 as Folk-Songs of the Southern United States (Folk-Songs Du Midi Des Etats-Unis), Publications of the American Folklore Society, Bibliographical and Special Series, Vol. 19 (University of Texas). In 1917, the folk music collector Cecil Sharp collected songs from Jean's older sisters Una and May. Many of the Ritchies attended the Hindman Settlement School, a folk school, where people were encouraged to cherish their own backgrounds and where Sharp also found many of his songs. Jean's father Balis had printed up a book of old songs entitled Lovers' Melodies,Charles Wolfe and Jean Ritchie, foreword to new edition of Jean Ritchie, Jean Ritchie's Swapping Song Book with photographs by George Pickow (University of Kentucky Press, [1952] 2000), p. 1. and music making was an important activity in the Ritchie home. Ritchie's forebears had fought in the Revolutionary War in 1776 before settling in Kentucky, and most of them later fought on the Confederate Side in the Civil War. Her grandfather Justice Austin Ritchie was 2nd Lieutenant of Company C of the 13th Kentucky Confederate Cavalry. Alan Lomax wrote that: > They were quiet, thoughtful folks, who went in for ballads, big families and > educating their children. Jean's grandmother was a prime mover in the Old > Regular Baptist Church, and all the traditional hymn tunes came from her. > Jean's Uncle Jason was a lawyer, who remembers the big ballads like \\"Lord > Barnard.\\" Jean's father taught school, printed a newspaper, fitted specs, > farmed and sent ten of his fourteen children to college.Lomax, foreword to > Jean Ritchie, Folk Songs of the Southern Appalachians, p. 1. As the youngest of 14 siblings, Ritchie was one of ten girls who slept in one room of the farming family's farm house. She was quick to memorize songs and, with Chalmers and Velma McDaniels, performed at local dances and at county fairs, where they repeatedly won blue ribbons in Hazard, the county seat. She recalled that when the family acquired a radio in the late 1940s they discovered that what they had been singing was hillbilly music, a word they had never heard before. Ritchie graduated from high school in Viper and enrolled in Cumberland Junior College (now a four-year University of the Cumberlands) in Williamsburg, Kentucky, and from there graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. in social work from the University of Kentucky, in Lexington in 1946. At college she participated in the glee club and choir and learned to play piano.Biography of Jean Ritchie, music.yahoo.com; accessed January 9, 2014. Ritchie was recorded performing traditional songs with her sisters by Emily Elizabeth Barnacle and by Artus Moser in 1946 whilst still in Kentucky. During World War II, she taught in elementary school. After graduating she got a job as a social worker at the Henry Street Settlement, where she taught music to children. There she befriended Alan Lomax, who recorded her extensively for the Library of Congress. She joined the New York folksong scene and met Lead Belly, Pete Seeger, and Oscar Brand. In 1948, she shared the stage with The Weavers, Woody Guthrie, and Betty Sanders at the Spring Fever Hootenanny and by October 1949 was a regular guest on Oscar Brand's Folksong Festival radio show on WNYC. In 1949 and 1950, she recorded several hours of songs, stories, and oral history for Lomax in New York City. Elektra records signed her and released three albums: Jean Ritchie Sings (1952), Songs of Her Kentucky Mountain Family (1957) and A Time for Singing (1962). Marriage to George Pickow In the early 1940s, Ritchie's future husband George Pickow was introduced to folk music when he heard Cisco Houston and Woody Guthrie jamming every night in a tiny cabin at the left-wing Camp Unity summer camp in upstate New York. The Brooklyn-born Pickow, who had studied painting at Cooper Union and made training films for the Navy in World War II, had a long career as a professional photographer and filmmaker. His career also included an extensive documentation of his wife's work and his photographs illustrated many of her books. Pickow and Ritchie met in 1948 at a square dance at the Henry Street Settlement. The following day, Pickow invited her to accompany him on a photo shoot at the Fulton Fish Market. \\"The result — Ms. Ritchie perched on the hood of a truck, holding a rather large lobster — was published in a trucking-industry magazine.\\" They married in 1950 and had two sons, Peter and Jon. In 1952, Pickow accompanied his wife on a Fulbright Scholarship to collect folk songs in Britain and Ireland. When Alan Lomax, then working out of London for the BBC, and his collaborator Peter Kennedy of the English Folk Dance and Song Society, decided to document the unique May Eve and May Day Festivals at Padstow in Cornwall, they selected Pickow to be their cameraman. The result was the 16-minute color film Oss Oss Wee Oss (1953). In 1961, Pickow and Lomax collaborated on a short film documentary about the Greenwich Village folk revival scene intended to be shown on the BBC. This never happened, however, and ten years later Alan's daughter Anna Lomax Wood, edited the surviving scraps and fragments in her father's office into a short film, Ballads, Blues, and Bluegrass. In addition to Ritchie, Ballads, Blues, and Bluegrass features what one reviewer called \\"killer footage\\" of performances by Clarence Ashley, Guy Carawan, Willie Dixon, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Roscoe Holcomb, Peter La Farge, Ernie Marrs, The New Lost City Ramblers, Memphis Slim, and the first known footage of a very young Doc Watson. In the audience are Maria Muldaur and Bob Dylan. Despite apocryphal tales, John Cohen of the New Lost City Ramblers affirms that Bob Dylan is not the male clog dancer at the beginning of the film. Pickow, who had been in declining health for a long time, died December 10, 2010, two days after Ritchie's 88th birthday. The dulcimer revival Ritchie preferred to sing without instrumental accompaniment, but occasionally she also accompanied herself on autoharp, guitar or on a handmade plucked Appalachian dulcimer. The latter instrument is also called the \\"mountain dulcimer\\" and is distinct from the hammer dulcimer; it is an intimate indoor instrument with a soft, ethereal sound. Her father had played the Appalachian dulcimer but forbade his children to touch it. At the age of four or five, however, Ritchie defied this prohibition and picked out \\"Go Tell Aunt Rhody\\". By 1949, Ritchie's playing of the Appalachian dulcimer had become a hallmark of her style. After her husband made one for her as a present, the couple decided there might be a potential market for them. Pickow's uncle, Morris Pickow, set up an instrument workshop for them under the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn. At first they were shipped to New York in an unfinished state by Ritchie's Kentucky relative, Jethro Amburgey, then the woodworking instructor at the Hindman Settlement School. George did the finishing and Jean did the tuning and soon they had sold 300 dulcimers. Later they manufactured them themselves from start to finish, Today there are dulcimers for sale at most folk festivals. Because fans kept asking her \\"Which album has the most dulcimer?\\", she finally recorded an album called The Most Dulcimer in 1992. The Fulbright expedition In 1952, Jean Ritchie was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to trace the links between American ballads and the songs from Britain and Ireland. As a song-collector, she began by setting down the 300 songs that she already knew from her mother's knee. Ritchie spent 18 months tape recording and interviewing singers. Pickow accompanied her, photographing Seamus Ennis, Leo Rowsome, Sarah Makem and other musicians. In 1955 Ritchie wrote a book about her family called Singing Family of the Cumberlands. \\"The Mother of Folk\\" Ritchie became known as \\"The Mother of Folk\\". As well as work songs and ballads, Ritchie knew hymns from the \\"Old Regular Baptist\\" church she attended in Jeff, Kentucky. These were sung as \\"lining out\\" songs, in a lingering soulful way. One of the songs they sang was \\"Amazing Grace\\". She wrote some songs, including \\"Black Waters\\", one on the effects of strip mining in Kentucky. (Some of Ritchie's late 1950s/early 1960s songs on mining she published under the pseudonym \\"'Than Hall\\" to avoid troubling her non-political mother, and believing they might be better received if attributed to a man.)Sally Rogers, \\"Sowing Seeds of Love for Traditional Music: An interview with Jean Ritchie\\", Pass It On! The Journal of the Children's Music Network, Winter 2003; retrieved January 10, 2010. \\"My Dear Companion\\" appeared on the album Trio recorded by Linda Ronstadt, Dolly Parton, and Emmylou Harris. Judy Collins recorded some of Ritchie's traditional songs, \\"Tender Ladies\\" and \\"Pretty Saro\\", and also used a photograph by George Pickow on the front of her album \\"Golden Apples of the Sun\\" (1962). Ritchie's 50th anniversary album was Mountain Born (1995), which features her two sons, Peter and Jonathan Pickow. In 1954 Ritchie and George Pickow released some of their UK recordings under the name Field Trip. It was re-issued in 2001 on the Greenhays label. It has recordings by Elizabeth Cronin, Seamus Ennis, and others, side by side with Ritchie family versions of the same songs. In 1996 the Ritchie Pickow Photographic Archive was acquired by the James Hardiman Library, National University of Ireland, Galway. Jean Ritchie performed at such venues as Carnegie Hall and at the Royal Albert Hall. Her album, None But One, was awarded the Rolling Stone Critics Award in 1977. Ritchie is a recipient of a 2002 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States' highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. For many years, Ritchie lived in Port Washington, New York. In 2008, she was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame.LONG ISLAND MUSIC HALL OF FAME SECOND INDUCTION AWARD GALA Retrieved November 6, 2010.

Biography Cyrus Thomas - During 1870 Hayden survey Thomas was born in Kingsport, Tennessee, on July 27, 1825, and was of German and Irish descent. He was educated in village schools in the Kingsport area and an academy student at Jonesboro, Tennessee, as well as being self-educated. His mother hoped he would join the medical field, so he studied anatomy and physiology, but he was uninterested in medicine and took to the study of law. He was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1851 and practiced in Murphysboro. Between his study of medicine and law his father, Dr. John Logan, appointed him to a county seat to \\"take charge of some business\\". From 1851 to 1854 Thomas served as county clerk of Jackson County, Illinois. He later abandoned the practice of law, and in 1865 became superintendent of some Jackson County schools. This lasted only for a few years. Also during this time he entered the ministry of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, but was forced to abandon the ministry, as well, due to his \\"intense independent thought\\". Four years later in 1869 he joined the expedition of Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden, who had organized a science corps for the exploration of the Rocky Mountains. Thomas gained a strong interest in natural history, and in 1858 he founded the Illinois Natural History Society. In 1869 his professional scientific career began with his appointment as an assistant in entomology in the United States Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories under Professor Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden. Thomas was also the agricultural statistician and entomologist on the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871, whose work supported the creation of Yellowstone National Park in 1872. In 1873 Thomas was appointed a professor of natural science at Southern Illinois Normal University, which gave him a public forum for his ideas. He was later named to the United States Entomological Commission in 1877 to serve alongside Charles Valentine Riley and Alpheus Spring Packard; at the same time he accepted the position of chief entomologist for the State of Illinois. He kept his title of chief entomologist until 1882 after the commission came to an end in 1879. At this time, 1882, he was appointed archaeologist to the United States Bureau of American Ethnology. Thomas was married twice, having lost his first wife, Dorthy Logan, sister of Maj. Gen.and later U.S. Senator John A. Logan. He remarried in 1865 to Viola L. Davis. With her, he fathered five girls and one boy, who died in infancy. Thomas died on June 26, 1910, and was buried in Frederick, Maryland. Works= Entomology  Thomas made some noteworthy contributions as an entomologist, having helped control the insect plague that was retarding the growth of the border states. Thomas, working with Charles V. Riley, found that the Hessian fly, which was terrorizing the wheat and rye of the western states, was most destructive in wet seasons and least destructive in dry seasons. With this information they were able to predict the outbreaks rather accurately for the upcoming year, and entomologists and farmers worked together for better times to plant and harvest. The chinch bug was another culprit damaging crops. Thomas and LeBaron, using the same tactic of studying the chinch bug's relationship to the weather, found that chinch bugs needed at least one or two dry seasons to reach outbreak proportions. Thomas found a pattern between the chinch bug and weather, concluding that outbreaks can be expected about every seven years and then for two years in a row. After presenting his findings he accurately predicted an outbreak in 1881. He also accompanied expeditions to the West as an entomologist—one of these being the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871. On this expedition Thomas addressed the problem of locusts with Riley and Packard (this was also the creation of the United States Entomological commission). During this investigation they found the locusts' breeding ground, how the weather affected them, and what controlled their direction-wind. Archaeology However, Thomas is best known for his work in archaeology and ethnology—specifically, his contributions to the question of the origin of the mound builders and Mayan hieroglyphics. Thomas was not a field archaeologist. He visited the sites on which he reported, but did little if any field work. He had permanent and temporary field assistants and one clerical assistant. They provided him with their notes, which he organized, formed into a report, and published. When Thomas began his investigations into the origins of the mound builders, he was under the impression that the mounds were made by a more advanced race that no longer existed. He argued that once America had been settled the people tended to stay in one place, which meant that the archaeological record had been produced by the same people of that area through history. Although he did not do field work he mapped out a plan of action for the mound excavations, and presented ten years of work in the 12th Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology for 1890–91. By the end of his research into the origin of the mound builders Thomas dismissed each argument advanced in favor of the vanished race theory. The Bat Creek Inscription was one artifact that Thomas used to support his hypothesis that \\"the Cherokee constructed many earthen mounds\\"; the evidence being that \\"the stone represented characters of Cherokee syllabary\\". Thomas divided the mounds into a northern section, which was divided into six sections, and a southern section, which was divided into two. These eight sections, Thomas suggested, represent more than one nation. Thomas thought that migration was the reason for the mounds being spread through the east, but also recognized that the idea for mounds diffused through the different tribes. Climatology Thomas also wrote on climatology, a new field in the 19th century. He was a leading proponent of the now-debunked theory known as \\"Rain follows the plow\\", which stated that increased population and cultivation of the Great Plains would render the land lush and fertile. This theory was used to promote expansion into the American West, in order to persuade would-be settlers that the \\"current\\" lack of precipitation would not hinder their ability to engage in agriculture.

Klocek is a former part-time instructor at DePaul University. His teaching career at DePaul ended as a result of an altercation with pro- Palestinian students at an exhibit in the cafeteria of DePaul's downtown Chicago campus. His supporters have argued that he is a victim of \\"political correctness\\" and that his right to free speech has been violated. The university however, has stated that he was fired due to \\"belligerent and menacing\\" conduct towards students, which included shouting and throwing papers. DePaul University offered Klocek, who was not tenured, the continuation of his teaching position if he apologized to the students for his behavior. Klocek rejected this and instead sued the school for defamation and breach of contract. The case was dismissed. Klocek's career at DePaul Klocek instructed students as a part-time adjunct professor at the School for New Learning, a school for working adults. There Klocek created and taught a variety of courses ranging from “Languages & Cultures of the World” to “Russian and American Founding Documents”. He taught at DePaul university for 15 years, during which time he received consistently positive student reviews. Klocek's area of expertise were Slavic languages and Russian and Old Slavic literature. Klocek, who did not have a PhD, noted that initially he took the part-time position because he was working on a doctoral thesis, but that got caught up in his teaching and never finished his dissertation. The Incident During the yearly Loop Student Fair campus event where student groups setup exhibits in the school's cafeteria, Klocek approached the exhibit maintained by Students for Justice in Palestine. There an altercation ensued between four students and Klocek. Another four students from a group called \\"United Muslims Moving Ahead\\" from a neighboring exhibit became involved in the altercation. After approximately 30 minutes, other student groups called the faculty to intervene. Klocek was escorted out of the cafeteria by campus security, but returned and made a gesture towards the students, before leaving again. The students complained to the University about the altercation, describing it as a \\"racist encounter\\". The Students' version of the Events The students noted that they first noticed Klocek pacing back and forth near their exhibit. They then claim that he approached their exhibit and began asking questions. They claim that as they responded, he would quickly change the subject erratically from one subject to another. They claim that he eventually stated that there was no such thing as a Palestinian people. When one student interjected that she was Palestinian, the students claim that Klocek began to shout and throw the material on their stall at them, at which point students from a neighboring exhibit, the United Muslims Moving Ahead got involved. They claim that Klocek began shouting profanities at them and told them that their religion was based on terror. The students claim that after campus security removed Klocek from the event, he returned, \\"made an obscene hand gesture (he flipped us off)\\" and left. Klocek's version of the Events Klocek claims that he approached the group because he disagreed with the content of the groups' leaflets. He stated that one leaflet described the death of American activist Rachel Corrie in Israel as \\"murder\\"; a charge which he considered to be offensive. As the debate became more heated, Klocek claims that the students compared Israel to Nazi Germany at which point a shouting match ensued. Klocek acknowledges that he told the United Muslims Moving Ahead student group that all terrorist attacks were committed by Muslims, but he claims that he was quoting Chicago Sun-Times columnist Neil Steinberg. Klocek also acknowledged that he raised his voice, but he denied using profanity. Klocek denies throwing the exhibit material at the students and claims that he put that back in a stack. Klocek also acknowledged that he returned and confronted the students again after being escorted away by campus security, but he claims that the gesture he made with his hand, involved flicking his thumb at his chin, which he argued is an Italian New Jersey expression meaning, \\"I'm finished\\" or \\"I'm out of here\\". Aftermath The students began circulating an email with their version of the events to the local student body. The student newspaper, the DePaulia, later published a story about the students' version of the event. Klocek wrote a response to the story, which was also printed in the paper. Both the Students for Justice in Palestine and United Muslims Moving Ahead wrote complaint letters to the university administration. The university suspended Klocek with pay. Following negotiations, the university offered Klocek the return of his teaching position, if he apologized to the students and agreed to observers intermittently sitting in his classes. Klocek declined the offer and hired an attorney, suing the university for defamation of character and breach of contract. Klocek, along with a number of conservative bloggers, claimed that at heart the issue was one of freedom of speech and academic freedom. They claim that DePaul has ended Klocek's career as a result of his pro-Israeli views. DePaul officials deny that description, arguing that it was Klocek's \\"belligerent and menacing\\" behavior towards the students which led to his suspension. University officials were quoted as saying \\"we emphatically reject that this is at all a matter of academic freedom. For DePaul it was about his conduct not his content\\". Klocek's claims for breach of contract against DePaul were dismissed with prejudice on January 30, 2006. His claims for defamation of character were dismissed in another hearing later in 2006 by the First District Court of Illinois. In 2010, the Illinois Supreme Court refused Klocek's request for an appeal, ending the lawsuit.

It was created by Sega's Yu Suzuki-headed AM2 and was released in the arcade in 1994. It was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1995 and Microsoft Windows in 1997. In 1996, a super deformed version of the game, Virtua Fighter Kids, arrived in arcades and was ported to the Sega Saturn. A 2D remake was released for the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1996. In addition, Virtua Fighter 2 was converted for the PlayStation 2 in 2004 as part of Sega's Ages 2500 series in Japan. The Mega Drive/Genesis port was re-released on the PS2 and PSP in 2006 as part of Sega Genesis Collection, on the Virtual Console for the Wii on March 20, 2007 (Japan) and April 16, 2007 (North America), and for iOS on January 20, 2011. Virtua Fighter 2 was known for its breakthrough graphics. It used Sega's Model 2 arcade hardware to run the game at 60 frames per second at a high resolution with no slowdown (by comparison, the original Virtua Fighter ran at 30 frames per second). It introduced the use of texture-mapped 3D characters, and motion capture animation technology. The Saturn version was also well-received for its graphics and gameplay. It became a huge hit in Japan and sold relatively well in other markets, notably the UK. The arena size could be adjusted up to a very small platform or all the way to 82 meters (269 feet). This is the only game in the series—other than Virtua Fighter Remix—that could have such size adjustments. The physical energy meter could also be adjusted to infinity, giving the player the advantage when beating opponents or practicing moves against the computer player. Adjusting the arena to a smaller size and giving the characters infinite health could lead to mock sumo matches, wherein victory is achieved by knocking the other player's character out of the ring. Gameplay Virtua Fighter 2 is a 3D 1v1 fighting game, similar in concept to other games of the series. Players select a character, and attempt to use that character to overcome a series of opponents. This can be done by simply knocking the other character out (by dealing enough damage), or by knocking them out of the square \\"ring\\" in which the fights take place. Each fight takes place over a number of rounds; typically 3 rounds in a best-of-3 approach (though this can be varied). The game is played with an eight-way stick to control character movement, and three buttons (guard, punch and kick), which are used in various motions to pull off a character's signature attacks. Each character has their own fighting style, loosely based on various real-world fighting methods, such as wrestling or eastern styles. Characters each have many unique moves; however, like in the original Virtua Fighter, many of the characters share a number of moves with another character (for instance, Lau Chan and Pai Chan each practice similar forms of Kung Fu). In addition, the entire roster of characters shares certain moves and functions; for instance, every character has a basic throw that can be executed by pressing the guard and punch buttons simultaneously. The number and variety of attacks possessed by each character has also been expanded, including the addition of counter- attacks and the ability to prevent throws (with very quick reactions required on part of the player). All nine characters from the original Virtua Fighter are once again playable in Virtua Fighter 2. The sequel also adds two new characters: Shun Di, an old drunken fist master from China, and Lion Rafale, the French son of a rich businessman who uses praying mantis style kung fu. Additionally, Shun and Lion possess the unique ability to perform \\"axis strikes\\" in which they would move around the attacks of other characters, accentuating the game's 3D nature. Plot Virtua Fighter 2 presents no narrative in-game; there is no story-based intro sequence, no narrative character endings and very little text to supply much of a plot. However, the game was given a story in its supporting material, such as the manual for the Sega Saturn version. Virtua Fighter 2 hinges around a fighting tournament, where the greatest fighters in the world seek to compete for fame and glory. However, the tournament is organised by the sinister \\"J6\\" syndicate, who intend to use the information gathered to perfect their fighting cyborg \\"Dural\\" (the game's boss, who uses a move-set made up of other character's moves). Development The game took Sega AM2 roughly 12 months to develop. The developers designed four new characters, only two of which, Lion and Shun, made it into the final game. In a 1995 interview, head developer Yu Suzuki said Virtua Fighter 2 was his favorite of all the games he had made, elaborating that he was particularly pleased with the way the polygonal graphics \\"added a sense of reality\\" to the characters' motions, and the addition of counterattacks. At the beginning of 1995, Sega AM2's Sega Saturn division was split into three sub-departments, each one charged with porting a different arcade game to the Saturn: Virtua Fighter 2, Virtua Cop, and Daytona USA. Due to unexpectedly slow progress in the Daytona USA port, a number of members of the Virtua Fighter 2 team were reassigned to Daytona USA. In March, AM2 Research completed the Sega Graphics Library, a Saturn operating system which made it feasible to create a near-arcade perfect port of Virtua Fighter 2 for the Saturn. After completing the Daytona USA port in April, the team took a short holiday before beginning work on the Virtua Fighter 2 conversion in earnest. In June, AM2 gave the first public demonstration of Saturn Virtua Fighter 2 at the Tokyo Toy Show. To increase confidence in the accuracy of the port, they displayed non-playable demos of the characters Lion, Shun, Pai, and Lau running on the Saturn hardware at 60 frames per second - the same speed as the arcade version. However, AM2 continued to face problems in creating an accurate port for the Saturn. Due to the high number of moves in Virtua Fighter 2, months had to be spent on developing compression techniques in order to fit all of the game's moves onto a single CD. Also, in order to maintain the 60 frames per second, the Saturn version could not use nearly as many polygons as the arcade version. To make this difference less apparent, the programming team used texture mapping on the characters, taking advantage of the fact that the Saturn could map 16 different colors to each polygon, whereas the Model Two arcade hardware could map only 1. In addition, the polygon background objects of the arcade version were replaced with parallax scrolling playfields with selective scaling. The AM2 team also used data from Virtua Fighter Remix as a reference for some elements. In an interview during development, Keiji Okayasu discussed the team's struggles with getting the Saturn version to run at 60 frames per second: By the end of September, hit detection had been enabled, and the now fully playable conversion was displayed at the JAMMA show. Taking into account audience reactions at the JAMMA show, the team spent the next two months on final adjustments, play- testing, and the addition of Saturn-specific options. Development on the port was completed in November 1995. Release Virtua Fighter 2.1 is a revised version featuring re-tweaked gameplay, slightly enhanced graphics and the ability to play as Dural. Though it was never released outside Japan, it is possible to switch to the 2.1 game mechanics in the Saturn and PC ports; however, none of the other features are updated. This version was also released in the Sega Ages 2500 series. The Saturn port was scheduled for a December 1995 release in Europe, in time for the crucial Christmas shopping season, but it did not appear until the end of the following January. In Japan, a Virtua Fighter 2 \\"CG Portrait Series\\" of discs were released for the Saturn. Each of the 11 discs (one for each playable character) contains a slideshow of high-resolution CG stills of the character engaged in non- fighting activities such as playing pool or eating ice cream, backed by a Japanese pop song, as well as a karaoke mode. The Genesis/Mega Drive version is a 2-D remake which includes moves from the original Virtua Fighter. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Virtua Fighter 2 on their January 1, 1995 issue as being the most-successful arcade game of the year. According to Sega, over 2,500 Virtua Fighter 2 stand-up units were sold to arcades in its first 18 months on the market. Sega reported pre-orders of 1.5 million units for the Saturn version of Virtua Fighter 2 in Japan, which is nearly as many of the number of Saturns that had been sold in Japan at that point. At the time of its release, Virtua Fighter 2 was the top-selling game for the Saturn, and remains the highest selling Saturn game in Japan with 1.7 million copies. In the US, the game was bundled with various Saturn consoles for a while alongside Daytona USA and Virtua Cop, which helped boost the Saturn's sales. Virtua Fighter 2 was critically acclaimed upon release. Next Generation gave the game a perfect 5/5 stars, calling it \\"the ultimate arcade translation\\" and \\"the best fighting game ever.\\" The magazine cited its \\"accurate representation of 10 very distinct and realistic fighting styles\\", \\"remarkable AI\\", and \\"a general attention to detail that sets a new mark for quality game design.\\" Sega Saturn Magazine gave the Saturn version a 98%, citing the smooth frame rate, the realistically varied reactions to blows, the huge variety of moves, and the addition of features such as Team Battle Mode. Similarly praising the variety of moves and the accuracy of the port, Game Revolution gave the Saturn version an A and concluded that \\"Virtua Fighter 2 for the Saturn looks better and smoother than any other polygonal fighting game for the next generation systems. This just might be the best home console fighting game ever.\\" GamePros Scary Larry called it \\"the game to own if you have a Saturn\\", citing the authentic fighting styles and moves, the new modes, the realistic animations with strong attention to detail, and the easy to master controls. He gave it a perfect score in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and FunFactor). The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly felt the port was not as arcade perfect as it could have been, but highly praised the wealth of options and modes, with two of their reviewers declaring it by far the best fighting game on the Saturn thus far. Game Informer's Andy, Reiner and Paul praised Virtua Fighter 2 for its depth and variety, but criticized inferior background details in the Saturn port, while Paul also felt that the original Virtua Fighter required more strategy. Maximum described the port as \\"remarkably similar to its coin-op parent - a game that's running on hardware that's 20 times more expensive than the Sega Saturn.\\" They particularly praised the high-resolution graphics, smooth frame rate, \\"breathtaking\\" variety of moves, and the numerous Saturn-exclusive modes and options. With their one criticism being the very vulnerable opponent AI, they gave it their \\"Maximum Game of the Month\\" award. GameSpot gave the PC version a 8.1/10. Praising the game's realism, depth, and opponent AI, and the PC version's inclusion of online multiplayer, they deemed it \\"unquestionably the best fighting game on the PC, and certainly one of the finest fighting games of all time\\", adding that the PC version \\"rivals even the excellent Sega Saturn console port.\\" The PlayStation 2 port of the game was criticized for failing to be faithful to the original arcade version. Retrospective feedback on the Saturn version has continued to gather praise. GamesRadar ranked it the third-best Sega Saturn game, stating that \\"with Sonic sitting much of this generation out, is there a franchise more synonymous with the Saturn than Virtua Fighter?\\" 1UP described the Saturn port as featuring \\"crisp, fast visuals and deeply nuanced game mechanics.\\" They also claimed the game had aged well, unlike other fighters released around the time, such as the original Tekken. IGN also ranked it as the second-best Sega Saturn game, saying that the game \\"stands head and shoulders above all 32-bit fighters. All of them.\\" Virtua Fighter 2 was ranked as the 19th-best arcade game of the 1990s by Complex.Rich Knight, Hanuman Welch, The 30 Best Arcade Video Games of the 1990s, Complex.com, August 28, 2013.

A super deformed version of Virtua Fighter 2, it was released in the arcade and on the Sega Saturn in 1996. Unlike Virtua Fighter 2, it was developed on the ST-V board. All the characters have big heads, and the music is at a faster pace. The gameplay itself is slightly tweaked from Virtua Fighter 2. The Saturn version includes some new FMVs and programmable button sequences to allow players to test and use pre-made combos. Despite being children, some of the fighters retain the adult characteristics of their Virtua Fighter 2 counterparts, such as facial hair, muscles, and breasts. One of the variations of the boss character, Dural, features her with a fishbowl for a head, complete with a fish swimming inside. Release Merchandise for the game in Japan included a line of stuffed toys which sold very well even before development on the game was finished. In Japan, Virtua Fighter Kids was released on the Saturn as a promotional item in co-operation with drink brands \\"Java Tea\\" and \\"Energen\\" under the title \\"Virtua Fighter Kids: Java Tea Original Edition\\". It was later released commercially without any mention of \\"Java Tea\\" on the cover. All Java Tea product placement was removed from the western versions of the game, but is present in all Japanese versions (arcade, regular and Java Edition). Appearances in other games Although no official sequels to Virtua Fighter Kids were ever made (other than the VF Kids versions of the CG Portrait Series in Japan called the Game Gear Portrait Series), the child versions of Akira Yuki and Sarah Bryant reappear as playable characters in Fighters Megamix, and some of their fellow playable characters appear in the game's ending movie as well. The Kid styles of Akira Yuki and Sarah Bryant were made into figures in the Sega Dreamcast game Shenmue. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Virtua Fighter Kids on their May 1, 1996 issue as being the third most-successful arcade game of the year. Virtua Fighter Kids divided reviewers to an extent. GameSpot, Scary Larry of GamePro, and Dan Hsu, Crispin Boyer, and Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly said that while Virtua Fighter Kids would have made an amusing bonus mode in Virtua Fighter 2, it was not worthwhile as a full-price standalone release. On the other side, Next Generation, Rich Leadbetter of Sega Saturn Magazine, and Shawn Smith of Electronic Gaming Monthly argued that features such as the funny cinemas, the new facial expressions on the characters, and the new kid-themed scenery make the game more than a money-making gimmick, though they also said that it is not as good as the original version of Virtua Fighter 2. Most reviewers criticized the short reach of the kid characters.

Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 298 - 299. History=Origins of the clan Ramsay tartan as illustrated in the Vestiarium Scoticum of 1842. In the eleventh century a ram in the sea is believed to have been an emblem on the seal of an abbey in Huntingdon. In 1124, David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon was accompanied by many young Norman noblemen. Amongst these nobles may have been Symon de Ramesie. Symon was granted lands in Midlothian from David and also witnessed an important charter to the monks of Holyrood Abbey in 1140. 13th century and branches of the clan By the 13th century there were five major branches of the Clan Ramsay: the Ramsays of Dalhousie, the Ramsays of Auchterhouse, the Ramsays of Banff, the Ramsay of Forfar and the Ramsays of Clatto. In 1255, during the minority of Alexander III of Scotland, William de Ramsay of Dalhousie was a member of the king's council. Wars of Scottish Independence During the Wars of Scottish Independence, William Ramsay appears on the Ragman Rolls of 1296, swearing fealty to Edward I of England. However Ramsay later declared for Robert the Bruce and was one of the signatories on the Declaration of Arbroath. Ramsay had two sons, William and Alexander. The latter was a renowned knight and in 1342 was made sheriff of Teviotdale. However this office was claimed by the Douglases who became jealous and William Douglas, Lord of Liddesdale captured Alexander Ramsay with a strong force of men, imprisoning him in Hermitage Castle, where he was starved to death. Alexander's brother, William Ramsay, was captured by the English at the Battle of Neville's Cross but was not killed by them as he lived to tell the tale. In 1400 another Sir Alexander Ramsay held out in Dalhousie Castle against a siege by the English, who were forced to retreat due to Ramsay's resolute resistance. 16th century and Anglo-Scottish Wars In 1513 during the Anglo-Scottish Wars, Sir Alexander's descendant, another Alexander Ramsay, was killed at the Battle of Flodden. Dalhousie then passed to his son, Nicolas, who was a staunch supporter of Mary, Queen of Scots. After Mary was defeated the Ramsays acknowledged her son as James VI of Scotland and the Ramsays were later rewarded for saving that monarch's life. One of Nicolas's grandsons was John Ramsay who in 1600 killed both the Ruthven, Earl of Gowrie and his brother who were allegedly attempting to kidnap the king. This became known as the Gowrie Conspiracy. For saving the king, John Ramsay was created Earl of Holderness. 17th century and Civil War In 1618, the Earl of Holderness's brother, George Ramsay, was created Lord Ramsay. His eldest son, William Ramsay, opposed the religious politics of Charles I. During the Civil War, William raised a regiment of cavalry and fought at the Battle of Marston Moor. He was also part of Sir David Leslie's force at the Battle of Philiphaugh where the Marquis of Montrose was defeated. Ramsay had been created Earl of Dalhousie in 1633. In 1666 Sir Gilbert Ramsay of Bamff, descended from Neis de Ramsay, physician to Alexander II of Scotland around 1232, was created a Baronet of Nova Scotia. 18th and 19th centuries Brechin Castle circa 1880. Dalhousie Castle. The Ramsays served in all the great campaigns of the 18th and 19th centuries on the continent, in Canada, and in India. George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie was Governor General of British North America from 1819 to 1828. He was also commander-in- chief of India from 1829 to 1832. His son was James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie who also served as Governor General of India, from 1847 to 1856. In 1849 he was created Marquess of Dalhousie but this title died with him in 1860. However the older earldom passed to a cousin from whom the present Earl descends. Other branches of the family have also produced persons of distinction and rank. Alexander Ramsay, the younger son of the Arthur George Maule Ramsay, 14th Earl of Dalhousie married Princess Patricia of Connaught who was a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Their son was Alexander Ramsay of Mar and his wife, the Lady Saltoun, chief of the Clan Fraser, are members of the royal family, by the Queen's personal wish. Sir John Ramsay of Balmain was created Lord Bothwell in 1485. However he forfeited that title for treason in 1488 and it was later granted to the Clan Hepburn. The Ramsays of Balmain restored their fortunes by being created [baronet]s, first in 1625 and again in 1806. Other achievements Fighting was not the only talent of this family. Andrew Ramsay, better known as the Chevalier de Ramsay, left Scotland for France in 1708. His academic excellence was soon recognized, and he became mentor to the Prince de Turenne. The King of France appointed him a Knight of the Order of Saint Lazarus, and for a time he was tutor to both the Jacobite princes, Charles Edward Stuart and Henry Benedict Stuart. Allan Ramsay, the great 18th century poet, and his son, the distinguished portrait painter, were descended from the Clan Lairds of Cockpen, cadets of the chiefly house. Raymond Ramsay is a well-known 20th-century historian. Raymond was born in Manitoba and he is author of some books and articles about great Norman explorers of America. Raymond Ramsay wrote about Vinland and Norumbega etc. In 1972, Dalhousie Castle was converted to a hotel, and the clan seat became Brechin Castle in Angus. Castles *Brechin Castle is the current seat of the Earl of Dalhousie, chief of Clan Ramsay. *Dalhousie Castle was the previous seat of the Earls of Dalhousie. Clan profile=Chief The current chief of Clan Ramsay is James Ramsay, 17th Earl of Dalhousie. Symbols Clan members may show their allegiance to their clan by wearing a crest badge and clan badge. Crest badges usually contain the chief's heraldic crest and motto which are encircled by a strap and buckle. The crest and motto within the badge are the heraldic property of the clan chief alone. By wearing such crest badges, clan members show their allegiance to their chief. The crest badge suitable for a member of Clan Ramsay contains the crest: A unicorn's head couped Argent armed Or, and the motto ORA ET LABORA (from Latin: \\"pray and work\\"). Another clan symbol is the clan badge, or plant badge. These badges consist merely of sprigs of a specific plant, sometimes worn behind the crest badge on a bonnet. The clan badge of Clan Ramsay is Blue Harebell. The most popular of the tartans attributed to the surname Ramsay is derived from one titled Ramsey in the Vestiarium Scoticum published in 1842. Though the Vestiarium has been proven to be a Victorian era hoax many of today's clan tartans are derived from it. The Vestiarium provides both an illustrative plate, and a written description of the sett, however the plate and description contradict each other.

Somerset Maugham. Maugham exposes the misguided social snobbery levelled at the character Rosie Driffield, whose frankness, honesty, and sexual freedom make her a target of conservative propriety. Her character is treated favourably by the book's narrator, Ashenden, who understands that she was a muse to the many artists who surrounded her, and who himself enjoyed her sexual favours. Maugham drew his title from the remark of Sir Toby Belch to Malvolio in William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night: \\"Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?\\" Cakes and ale are also the emblems of the good life in the moral of the fable attributed to Aesop, \\"The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse\\": \\"Better beans and bacon in peace than cakes and ale in fear.\\" In his introduction to a Modern Library edition, published in 1950, Maugham wrote, \\"I am willing enough to agree with common opinion that Of Human Bondage is my best work ... But the book I like best is Cakes and Ale ... because in its pages lives for me again the woman with the lovely smile who was the model for Rosie Driffield.\\"Maugham, S. Cakes and Ale (introduction to Modern Library edition). Random House (1950), pp. xi–xii. Plot summary The story is told by a first-person narrator and well-to-do author, William Ashenden, who, at the beginning of the novel is suddenly and unexpectedly contacted by Alroy Kear, a busybody literary figure in London who has been asked by Amy, the second Mrs Driffield, to write the biography of her deceased husband, Edward Driffield. Driffield, once scorned for his realist representation of late-Victorian working-class characters, had in his later years come to be lionised by scholars of English letters. The second Mrs Driffield, a nurse to the ailing Edward after his first wife left him, is known for her propriety, and her interest in augmenting and cementing her husband's literary reputation. Her only identity is that of caretaker of her husband in life and of his reputation in death. It is well-known, however, that Driffield wrote his best novels while he was married to his first wife and muse, Rosie. Kear, who is trying to prove his own literary worth, jumps at the opportunity to ride the coat-tails of the great Edward Driffield by writing the biography. Knowing that Ashenden had a long acquaintanceship with the Driffields as a young man, Kear contacts him for inside information about Edward's past, including about his first wife, who has been oddly erased from the official narrative of Edward's genius. The story relates Ashenden's recollections of his past associations with the Driffields, especially Rosie. Due to his intimate association with her he hesitates to reveal how much information he will divulge to Driffield's second wife and Kear, who ostensibly wants a \\"complete\\" picture of the famous author, but who routinely glosses over the untoward stories that might upset Driffield's surviving wife. Ashenden holds the key to the deep mystery of love, and the act of love, in the life of each character, as he recounts a history of creativity, infidelity and literary memory. Publishing history Cakes and Ale was first published in serialised form in four issues of Harper's Bazaar (February, March, April, and June 1930). The first edition of the novel was published in September the same year by William Heinemann in London and the Garden City Publishing Company in Garden City, New York. Characters *William Ashenden: Author- narrator. *Amy Driffield: Nurse and second wife to Edward Driffield. *Edward Driffield (Ted): Late-Victorian realist author. *Rosie Driffield/Iggulden (née Gann): First wife of Edward Driffield, second wife of George Kemp. *Miss Fellows: Ashenden's landlady. *Mrs Hudson: Ashenden's first London landlady. *Alroy Kear: Biographer of Edward Driffield, literary acquaintance of Ashenden. *George Kemp/Iggulden (Lord George): Vivacious middle-class coal merchant and entrepreneur of Blackstable who runs off with Mrs Driffield to the United States and changes his name to Iggulden to protect himself from prosecution. *Mrs Barton Trafford: Patron of the arts and generous supporter of Edward Driffield. *The Vicar, Mr Ashenden: William's conservative uncle who initially forbids his nephew to fraternise with Ted and Rosie Driffield. *Mary-Ann: Maid to the Ashendens in Blackstable, childhood acquaintance of Rosie Driffield, and caretaker of young Ashenden. Real-life counterparts Two of the novel's principal characters, Alroy Kear and Edward Driffield, were widely interpreted by contemporaneous readers as thinly veiled and unflattering characterizations of, respectively, the novelists Hugh Walpole and Thomas Hardy (who had died two years previously). In response to a letter from Walpole inquiring about the association, Maugham denied it: \\"I certainly never intended Alroy Kear to be a portrait of you. He is made up of a dozen people and the greater part of him is myself\\". In an introduction written for the 1950 Modern Library edition of the book, however, Maugham admitted that Walpole was indeed the inspiration for Kear—but denied that Hardy inspired the Driffield character.Maugham, S. Cakes and Ale (introduction to Modern Library edition). Random House (1950), p. xi. In 1931, a pseudonymous novel called Gin and Bitters by A. Riposte, was published in the United States and told the story of \\"a novelist who writes novels about other novelists\\", and furthered the speculation about the Walpole/Kear association. It was rumoured that the author was Hugh Walpole himself, after the novel appeared in England under the title Full Circle. The book was quickly removed from sale by its English publisher, supposedly at the behest of Somerset Maugham. The true author was later discovered to be Elinor Mordaunt. Myrick Land, The Fine Art of Literary Mayhem, San Francisco: Lexicos, 1983, 2nd Edition, pp. 173 - 191 In The Fine Art of Literary Mayhem, Myrick Land asserts that Cakes and Ale ruined the last 11 years of Walpole's life and destroyed his reputation as a writer. Adaptations In 1974, the BBC released a three episode mini-series Cakes and Ale, starring Michael Hordern and Judy Cornwell. It was rebroadcast on Masterpiece Theatre in the US.

Bridget first appeared in the 2002 video game Guilty Gear X2. In the series, the androgynous character was born male with a twin brother in a village where the birth of same-sex twins is considered bad luck; therefore, his family named and raised him as a girl. When Bridget grew up, he decided to prove himself as a bounty hunter. Bridget was created as \\"a cute character\\" by Daisuke Ishiwatari, who wanted to vary the games' cast. Due to the character's appearance, he was initially described as female by video game sources. When they became aware of his sex, reviewers included Bridget on lists of best androgynous and cross-dressing characters, as well as debated his sexual orientation. Bridget has become a popular character among gamers, and critics have described him as \\"a memorable character\\" in the series. Concept and design Ishiwatari created Bridget as \\"a cute character\\" and to vary the games' cast, since \\"there were already other good looking and tough characters\\". As many fighting games already had this type of character, and \\"it would be too boring if the character was just cute\\", Ishiwatari \\"wanted something unconventional\\"; he and his staff decided it \\"would be interesting to make the character a guy.\\" The series' creator also said that Bridget was a difficult character to animate; he \\"has double the frames of animation\\" due to his yo-yo movements. He spent \\"a very long, very frustrating time trying to get the animation to work\\", rejecting many versions before studio staff made Bridget \\"look natural\\". Appearances Bridget was introduced in the third installment of the series, Guilty Gear X2 (2002), and appears to be a girl since he wears a nun's habit. However, according to his backstory Bridget is a boy, one of twin brothers named and raised by his parents as a girl in a British village. They do this to protect him, since the villagers believe that identical twins bring bad luck. As Bridget grows up, he is determined to prove he is not unlucky and becomes a bounty hunter who fights with a yo-yo and , his mechanical, oversized teddy bear. His journey begins when I-No gives him a fake bounty list. In Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus (2008), since Bridget feels he has proven his masculinity by defeating several opponents he decides to become an entertainer. Although he tries to recruit Venom for his talent at pool and I-No for her ability to play electric guitar, both refuse his suggestion. Without money, in one ending Bridget works as a waiter in Jam Kuradoberi's restaurant. In an alternate ending he returns to his birth village, finds that his twin brother has disappeared and begins searching for him. Bridget is also a playable character in the spin-offs Guilty Gear Isuka (2004), Dust Strikers (2006), and Judgment (2006). Reception Cosplayer at Comiket as Bridget; Brian Ashcraft of Kotaku noted that the character is \\"a favorite for female and male cosplayers alike\\" In a 2013 poll conducted by Arc System Works, Bridget was voted as the most popular character from the series. Eurogamer called Bridget as \\"[o]ne of Guilty Gears more memorable characters\\", while Kotaku's Brian Ashcraft said \\"[h]e's not only one of Guilty Gears most memorable characters [...] but also one of gaming's\\", calling him \\"an iconic character\\". UGO Networks named Bridget one of \\"Craziest Fighting Game Characters\\" as despite being a boy, he looks like \\"just a hot chick in a nun's costume that fights with a yo-yo\\". His nun's habit was featured on NowGamers 2010 list of \\"Gaming's Most Inappropriate Outfits Ever\\". Likewise, Virgin Media and 1UP.com placed him among the \\"worst-dressed games characters ever\\"; the latter stated \\"it's like gaming's version of The Crying Game—but with more crying.\\" Bridget was described as a woman in early reports, and has been the subject of discussion about his gender identity. IGN first described Bridget as a \\"kooky cross-dressing yoyo-wielding nun character\\", while GamesRadar called him \\"a saucy Catholic nun with a penis\\". GamesRadar placed Bridget second on its list of \\"Top 7... 'That's a Dude!?'\\", commenting that Bridget want to be manlier, \\"but unfortunately, none of them include not dressing as a sex-starved lady of the cloth.\\" UGO agreed; they ranked him the 21st-most- androgynous game character, saying \\"[h]e doesn't do too much to combat the image, either, fighting with weapons like a yo-yo and an oversized teddy bear.\\" He ranked fourth on ZoominGames' Top 5 \\"Transsexual characters in games\\" in spite of not being one), and UGO listed him among the \\"Best Crossdressers\\" in all media. Further, The Escapist noted that Bridget is the first transgender, cross-dressing character who is a protagonist, although such statements are erroneous, as Bridget is neither transsexual nor transgender. Since Bridget is a boy who was raised as a girl, his sexuality has been questioned. Although his sexual orientation is undisclosed, several websites have included the character in LGBT-related articles. On other hand, Destructoid featured an article \\"to argue the heterosexuality of Bridget.\\" Despite the controversy, GayGamer.net, JeuxvideoPC and Destructoid agree that Bridget is appreciated by fans; on the Internet, pictures of the character appear with captions such as \\"Bridget made me gay\\" and \\"Everyone is gay for Bridget\\". This was cited by GamesRadar's staff, which listed him among \\"characters we'd go gay for\\". When John McCain sponsored a bill which would require ISPs and possibly websites to alert the government about illegal images of minors—including cartoons—Wired published an article entitled \\"McCain Not Gay For Bridget\\". Gamasutra's Zoran Iovanovici ascribed Bridget's popularity to the fact that he is \\"ultra feminized\\", adding that \\"[i]t's no surprise that Bridget has become a fan favorite over the years.\\" Stephen Kelley wrote on VG Chartz that Bridget \\"appears to be a moe style cute anime character\\", but \\"[d]ressed in the provocative nun costume Bridget is suddenly a creepy sex object.\\" Pride St. Clair posted on the Piki Geek blog that Bridget \\"seemed to be playing towards several prevalent anime fetishes, including the innocent girl and the religious figure who is at once both desirable and chaste\\", saying that despite seeming \\"designed as a trap ...

Such a family has been universally recognized by taxonomists. It is known to gardeners for the genus Hibbertia, which contains many commercially valuable garden species. Description and Distribution The family is found in the tropics and subtropics plus all of Australia. Most of the members in it are woody plants - lianas or trees such as Dillenia - but herbaceous species such as Pachynema are also present in Dilleniaceae. The leaves of the plants in the family are wide and well-developed, but in Pachynema and certain species of Hibbertia they are strongly modified. The flowers are mainly showy and colorful with visible reproductive components. Buzz pollination is common in the group. Fruits of some species, such as Dillenia indica (elephant apple), are edible. Taxonomy and Phylogeny Dillenia suffruticosa The position of the family in the phylogenetic tree and its classification among the other eudicots is uncertain. Some studies suggested that Dilleniaceae may be sister to Rhabdodendraceae which is a clade that was thought to be sister to all the rest Caryophyllales. The caryophyllid Rhabdodendron and the members in the family with the questionable placement in fact share some morphological characteristics but it was found that Rhabdodendraceae is actually sister only to the core members of its order. Another possible situation places Dilleniaceae as an ancient group, sister to the superrosidae clade (the family shares some common morphology with Vitales) but this is not absolutely proven. The APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, of 1998), also recognizes this family, unplaced as to order, assigned to the clade core eudicots. APG II debates either including it in order Caryophyllales or reinstating the order Dilleniales for just this one family, but decides to leave it unplaced. Evolution The family is remarkable because of its variability of morphological characteristics that now are much steadier in other Angiosperm groups. Thus, Dilleniaceae may be an ancient clade that expresses some phylogenetic relation between the higher Eudicots and the rather more primitive groups. It is estimated that the clade diverged around 115 million years ago in Mid Cretaceous but the crown group was formed much later - only 52 million years before the present.

In World War II, it participated in the 1939 invasion of Poland, the 1940 invasion of France, and the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union. It remained on the Eastern Front, mainly under Army Group Centre, until it was trapped on the coast at Courland in the summer of 1944. It was evacuated by sea and returned to the main front in West Prussia in January 1945. There it surrendered to the Red Army at the end of the war. History=Formation The 4th Panzer Division was formed in Würzburg, Bavaria, on 10 November 1938 as the first of a second wave of new armoured divisions in Germany following the creation of the original three tank divisions in 1935. Alongside the 4th Panzer Division the 5th was formed at Oppeln, now Opole in Poland, five days later.Mitcham, p. 9 & 13Stoves, p. 37 & 48 Würzburg had previously been the garrison town for the 2nd Panzer Division which had moved its headquarters to Vienna after the Anschluss of Austria in March 1938.Mitcham, p. 13 The divisions insigna, with photographs of which were emblazoned on tank turrets,Tank with division insigna was derived from the Algiz, nordic runes. Invasion of Poland At the beginning of the Invasion of Poland (1939), the division was one of the first to cross the border in the operational area of Army Group South. Equipped with roughly 341 tanks, including 183 Panzer I, 130 Panzer II, 12 Panzer IV and 16 PzBef. The division lacked some infantry and anti-tank units..After entering Polish territory, on 1 September, the division used civilians as human shields during the battle of Mokra. During that battle the division was fighting the Polish Volhynian Cavalry Brigade under Colonel Julian Filipowicz. A Polish aircraft was shot down on 3 September and its crew taken prisoner. One of its passengers was brutally interrogated, tortured (German soldiers cut off his nose, ears and tongue) and then executed by personnel of the 4th Division. After supporting 1st Panzer, the division took part in the break-through of the Polish lines near Kłobuck, the Poles withdrew. Three days later, the 4th Panzer Division continued its move towards Warsaw. It reached the Polish capital on 8 September and tried to take the city by surprise. At 17.00, the forces of the 4th Panzer Division supported by the 31st Infantry Division attempted an assault on Warsaw's western borough of Ochota. The assault was repulsed and the German forces suffered heavy casualties. The following day, the division was reinforced with artillery and the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler motorised infantry regiment, and began another assault towards Ochota and Wola. Well-placed Polish anti-tank guns and barricades erected on main streets repulsed this assault. On several occasions, the lack of armament on the Polish side was made up for by ingenuity. One of the streets leading towards the city centre was covered with turpentine from a nearby factory. When German tanks approached, the liquid was set on fire, and the tanks were destroyed without a shot being fired. The German forces suffered heavy casualties and had to retreat. After the failed assault on Warsaw, 4th Panzer Division was withdrawn westward and took part in the Battle of the Bzura, where it supported a German counter-attack. On 18 September, in the village of Śladów, units of the 4th Panzer Division shot or drowned 252 prisoners of war and 106 civilians in the Vistula.Szymon Datner, \\"Zbrodnie Wehrmachtu na jeńcach wojennych w II wojnie światowej\\", Warsaw 1961, page 53-56 After that it was withdrawn to the Niederrhein. Invasion of France During the Battle of France in 1940, the division came under the command of Erich Hoepner's XVI Panzer Corps, part of von Kleist's Panzer Group in the 6th Army commanded by Walther von Reichenau. After a blitzkrieg assault through Liege and Charleroi, it reached the area of Bethune, where it fought against the British Expeditionary Force in what became known as the battle of Dunkirk. However, due to Adolf Hitler's orders, it did not manage to capture Dunkirk itself. In early June 1940, the division managed to cross a large part of France in several days. By the time that the cease fire was signed, it had reached Grenoble almost unopposed. After several months of occupation duty in France, in late November, the 4th Division was withdrawn to Würzburg, where it was reorganized and reinforced. The 36th Panzer Regiment was detached and assigned to the newly formed 14th Panzer Division, while the 103rd Artillery Regiment was reinforced with a third battalion. Invasion of the Soviet Union The division was moved to East Prussia and then to the area of Brześć Litewski in occupied Poland, where it was assigned to the XXIV Panzer Corps under Geyr von Schweppenburg. On 22 June 1941, it took part in the opening stages of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. During the first day, the division managed to drive a wedge into the Soviet positions and reached Kobryń some 65 kilometres behind the lines. The division then spearheaded one of the pincer moves to surround and destroy a large Soviet force in the battle of Minsk, where the German army took approximately 300,000 prisoners. After the battle of Gomel it reached Kiev, where it fought against another pocket of resistance. In September 1941, the division was attached to Army Group Centre, which was preparing to take part in the battle of Moscow. The assault started on 30 September 1941, the division captured Orel in early October but was ambushed on the road to Mtsensk by 1st Guards Rifle Corps on the 6th of that month. Attempts by the outclassed Panzers to maneuver round the Soviet flanks were defeated with heavy loss as the soviet T-34s savaged the underarmored Mark IV tanks, reducing much of the divisional armor to burned out, smoking wreckage by end of day. The advance resumed with growing loss and in late October Heinz Guderian concentrated most of the 2nd Panzer groups' remaining tanks into a single brigade under the 4th Panzer division, the spearhead of the XXIV Panzer Corps. By mid-November it was down to 50 tanks but still ground on reaching Tula, as the southern arm of a pincer which tried to surround the Soviet capital.David M. Glantz, When Titans Clashed (University Press of Kansas, 1995), \\"To Moscow,\\" p. 80, 85 The Germans formations were paralysed when the autumn rains set in, turning the only road to Tula into a stretch of mud. Bogged down German tanks were attacked by Soviet aircraft. With the onset of frost in early November, the Germans could use the roads again, but faced the problem of not being equipped for winter warfare. Warm clothing and white camouflage suits were lacking, and tanks and other vehicles were immobilised as temperatures dropped below freezing. On 5 December, the division was withdrawn and ordered to defend a stretch of front near Moscow against a Soviet winter counter-offensive. In a series of retreats, the division lost almost all of its tanks. A month later it had only 25 machines still operational. It withdrew to the Orel area, where the thaw halted the Soviet counter-offensive and the unit could be partially reinforced. Throughout 1942 it fought in the battle of Orel, a series of almost World War I-like skirmishes, assaults and counter-assaults. It took part in the failed battle of Kursk, after which it withdrew to the area along the Desna River. After a series of Soviet advances, the front line was finally stabilized near Bobruysk, where the division spent the winter of 1943–1944. Retreat (1943–1945) In the spring of 1944, the division moved to the area of Kowel in occupied Poland, where it was to support Army Group South during the expected Soviet spring offensive. However, Operation Bagration, (started on 22 June 1944), was aimed at Army Group Centre and the division retreated with the rest of the German army. Assigned to the XXXIX Panzer Corps under Gen. Karl Decker, the division withdrew to the area of Warsaw, where the Soviet advance ran out of momentum at the end of July. The 4th Panzer Division took part in the Battle of Radzymin (also known as the Battle of Wołomin) and on 2 August 1944, alongside the 19th Panzer Division, threw the Soviet III Tank Corps back to Wolomin. The Soviet Tank Corps suffered heavy losses and their advance halted.Tucker-Jones, Anthony, Stalin's Revenge: Operation Bagration & The Annihilation of Army Group Centre, p.103, (Pen & Sword Military, 1st edition, 2009) The division was then transported to northern Lithuania, where it was to support Army Group North. It was attached to the 3rd Panzer Army. The Soviet advance cut the German army group in two and the division was mostly dispersed. Some of its sub-units were cut off from the rest of German-held territory, along with the 16th and 18th Armies, in Livonia on the Courland Peninsula, where they supported the defense until the end of the war. Other units were attached to smaller, often improvised formations. They were destroyed by the Soviet offensive of April–May 1945.

This sheet of both ascending and descending axons carries most of the neural traffic from and to the cerebral cortex. The corona radiata is associated with the corticopontine tract, the corticobulbar tract, and the corticospinal tract. Structure Projection fibers are afferents carrying information to the cerebral cortex, and efferents carrying information away from it. The most prominent projection fibers are the corona radiata, which radiate out from the cortex and then come together in the brain stem. The projection fibers that make up the corona radiata also radiate out of the brain stem via the internal capsule. Cerebral white matter is commonly regarded today as an intricately organized system of fasciculi that facilitate the highest expression of cerebral activity. part of corona radiata pathway on brain Function=Motor pathway Evidence from subcortical small infarcts suggests that motor fibers are somatotopically arranged in the human corona radiata. Following subtotal brain damage, localization of the corticofugal projection in the corona radiata and internal capsule can assist in evaluating a patient's residual motor capacity and predicting their potential for functional restitution. Data suggests that the corona radiata and superior capsular lesions may correlate with more favorable levels of functional recovery. Lesions seated inferiorly are likely to correlate with poorer levels of recovery regarding upper limb movement. Findings also suggest that motor deficit severity is likely to increase as a lesion occupies progressively more posterior regions of the internal capsule. right Clinical significance The corona radiata may be affected by diseases affecting the cerebral white matter, including ischemic leukoencephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, and progressive leukoencephalopathy. These may have major effects on intellectual, social, and emotional functioning. In normal pressure hydrocephalus, expansion of the lateral ventricles causes distortion of the fibers of the corona radiata. This contributes to the urinary incontinence seen with NPH.

O'Dowd (1907–1950). The school requires all students to attend school liturgies (Catholic Mass and prayer services), to enroll in religious studies courses each semester, and to complete its 4-year service learning program. O’Dowd is a Catholic high school community of 1,186 students. The school has 125 faculty and staff members and more than 80 part- time coaches, teachers and moderators. History Bishop O’Dowd High School is named in memory of the former Superintendent of Schools of the Archdiocese of San Francisco, Bishop James T. O’Dowd, who died at the age of 42 from injuries sustained in a train accident. Having just helped to establish Marin Catholic and Riordan high schools, O'Dowd was in the process of drawing up plans for a new Catholic high school in the East Bay at the time of his sudden death. Bishop O'Dowd's first senior class graduated in 1955, and since then O'Dowd has had over 12,000 graduates. In June 2010, O’Dowd successfully completed a three-year, $9 million comprehensive fundraising campaign and funds raised were split about evenly between capital development and program enhancement. Funds contributed to renovation of many elements of the classroom buildings — from floors to ceilings, interior and exterior, every classroom, lab and locker, from ventilation to technology infrastructure.

This system is most often used in North America, though institutions in Europe, Asia, and Australia may also employ similar measures. It is often synonymous with honor roll and honor list, but should not be confused with honours degrees. Generally, students enrolled in college or university would need to satisfy a series of specific requirements before receiving the Dean's List. These requirements may differ across institutions, but in most cases will require students to enroll in a full-time capacity, to achieve a specific grade point average within the academic term, and to maintain a specific cumulative grade point average throughout enrollment. Universities may often establish further rewards, such as Annual Dean's Lists, for students that demonstrate even greater academic distinction. As such, a Dean's List and its direct derivatives are usually intended for students that demonstrate highest scholarship across multiple disciplines, and not necessarily bound to a specific field of study. Over time, the Dean's List has also led to the creation of additional rewards with similar nomenclatures, including the Provost's List, the Chancellor's List, the Rector's List (mostly limited to within Europe), and the Director's List. The additional requirements to be met for such honors may include academic distinction within a target field of study, extracurricular achievements, continued high scholarship throughout enrollment or other noteworthy accomplishments.  Distinction = Comparison to North American Latin honors  Although the Dean's List and Latin honors may both be issued in recognition of high scholarship, they are mostly separate awards not intended for direct comparison. Many institutions confer three levels of Latin honors, as follows: * cum laude, meaning \\"with praise\\" (or \\"with honor\\")The usual translation of laude from Latin is \\"with praise\\". ** In North America, this honor is typically awarded to graduates in the top 25% (or 30%) of their class. * magna cum laude, meaning \\"with great honor\\" ** In North America, this honor is typically awarded to graduates in the top 10% (or 15%) of their class; this is the highest honor awarded at some institutions. * summa cum laude, meaning \\"with highest honor\\" ** In North America, this honor is typically awarded to graduates in the top 1-5% of their class. Because Latin honors are often conferred to the approximate class rank whereby students also receive the Dean's List (as the top 10-15%), magna and summa cum laude are usually held in higher regard. A Dean's List may therefore be seen as equal to (or more prestigious than) cum laude, depending on the specific requirements involved. Comparison to GPA  The Dean's List GPA requirements vary from school to school, although there are general standards: * With the GPA scale from 0 to 4, 4 being an A, the dean's list cutoff is typically around 3.5-3.7. * Top 10% of the class in GPA Some schools maintain two lists for two different levels of GPA. For example, the dean's list records students with at least a 3.5 GPA whereas the chancellor's list records students with a higher 4.0 GPA. Different from an academic scholarship, the dean's list award does not come with any financial aid. However, students high on the dean's list are often offered extra financial aid, especially if they express a desire to transfer or exhibit more financial need.  Comparison to British classifications  In the United Kingdom, colleges and universities may utilize variations of the British degree classifications to distinguish students of high scholarship. The classification system as currently used in the United Kingdom, for example, was developed in 1918. The system was implemented based on one from the 16th century, when the Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge implemented norm referencing to distinguish the top 25% of candidates, the next 50%, and the bottom 25%. Today, first-class honours is awarded, by most institutions, to any student that receives a grade of 70% or higher (as opposed to classification by class rank). The number of first-class honours degrees has reportedly tripled since the 1990s, and there has been concern over possible grade inflation due to increasing numbers of higher- class honours degrees awarded per annum.

The microdot film was so tiny it could be hidden in a spy's personal effects and smuggled out of a location. Tradecraft, within the intelligence community, refers to the techniques, methods and technologies used in modern espionage (spying) and generally, as part of the activity of Intelligence assessment. This includes general topics or techniques (dead drops, for example), or the specific techniques of a nation or organization (the particular form of encryption (encoding) used by the National Security Agency, for example).  Examples * Agent handling is the management of espionage agents, principal agents, and agent networks (called \\"assets\\") by intelligence officers, who are typically known as case officers. * Analytic tradecraft is the body of specific methods for intelligence analysis. * Black bag operations are covert or clandestine entries into structures or locations to obtain information for human intelligence operations. This may require breaking and entering, lock picking, safe cracking, key impressions, fingerprinting, photography, electronic surveillance (including audio and video surveillance), mail manipulation (\\"flaps and seals\\"), forgery, and a host of other related skills. Caltrop used by the US Office of Strategic Services. When scattered on a roadway or runway, the hollow spikes puncture self-sealing rubber tires. The hole in the center allows air to escape even if the other ends of the tube are sealed by soft ground. * Concealment devices are used to hide things for the purpose of secrecy or security. Examples in espionage include dead drop spikes for transferring notes or small items to other people, and hollowed-out coins or teeth for concealing suicide pills. * Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties (called adversaries). More generally, it is about constructing and analyzing communications protocols that block adversaries. * A cut-out is a mutually trusted intermediary, method or channel of communication, facilitating the exchange of information between agents. People playing the role of cutouts usually only know the source and destination of the information to be transmitted, but are unaware of the identities of any other persons involved in the espionage process. Thus, a captured cutout cannot be used to identify members of an espionage cell. * A dead drop or \\"dead letter box\\" is a method of espionage tradecraft used to pass items between two individuals using a secret location and thus does not require them to meet directly. Using a dead drop permits a case officer and agent to exchange objects and information while maintaining operational security. The method stands in contrast to the 'live drop', so-called because two persons meet to exchange items or information. *\\"Drycleaning\\" is a countersurveillance technique for discerning how many \\"tails\\" (following enemy agents) an agent is being followed by, and by moving about, seemingly oblivious to being tailed, perhaps losing some or all of those doing surveillance. * Eavesdropping is secretly listening to the conversation of others without their consent, typically using a hidden microphone or a \\"bugged\\" or \\"tapped\\" phone line. * False flag operations is a covert military or paramilitary operation designed to deceive in such a way that the operations appear as though they are being carried out by entities, groups, or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them. Operations carried out during peace-time by civilian organizations, as well as covert government agencies, may by extension be called false flag. *A front organization is any entity set up by and controlled by another organization, such as intelligence agencies. Front organizations can act for the parent group without the actions being attributed to the parent group. A front organization may appear to be a business, a foundation, or another organization. *A honey trap is a deceptive operation in which an attractive agent lures a targeted person into a romantic liaison and encourages them to divulge secret information during or after a sexual encounter. * Interrogation is a type of interviewing employed by officers of the police, military, and intelligence agencies with the goal of eliciting useful information from an uncooperative suspect. Interrogation may involve a diverse array of techniques, ranging from developing a rapport with the subject, to repeated questions, to sleep deprivation or, in some countries, torture. \\"Belly- buster\\", a hand-cranked audio drill strapped to an agent's stomach. It was used during the late 1950s and early 1960s to covertly drill holes into masonry for implanting audio devices, such as microphones. * A legend refers to a person with a well-prepared and credible made-up identity (cover background) who may attempt to infiltrate a target organization, as opposed to recruiting a pre-existing employee whose knowledge can be exploited. * A limited hangout is a partial admission of wrongdoing, with the intent of shutting down the further inquiry. * A microdot is text or an image substantially reduced in size onto a small disc to prevent detection by unintended recipients or officials who are searching for them. Microdots are, fundamentally, a steganographic approach to message protection. In Germany after the Berlin Wall was erected, special cameras were used to generate microdots that were then adhered to letters and sent through the mail. These microdots often went unnoticed by inspectors, and information could be read by the intended recipient using a microscope. * A one-time pad is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked if used correctly. In this technique, a plaintext is paired with random, secret key (or pad). * One-way voice link is typically a radio-based communication method used by spy networks to communicate with agents in the field typically (but not exclusively) using shortwave radio frequencies. Since the 1970s infrared point to point communication systems have been used that offer one-way voice links, but the number of users was always limited. A Numbers Station is an example of a one- way voice link, often broadcasting to a field agent who may already know the intended meaning of the code, or use a one-time pad to decode. These numbers stations will continue to broadcast gibberish or random messages according to their usual schedule; this is done to expend the resources of one's adversaries as they try in vain to make sense of the data, and to avoid revealing the purpose of the station or activity of agents by broadcasting solely when needed. * Steganography is the art or practice of concealing a message, image, or file within another message, image, or file. Generally, the hidden message will appear to be (or be part of) something else: images, articles, shopping lists, or some other cover text. For example, the hidden message may be in invisible ink between the visible lines of a private letter. The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages—no matter how unbreakable—will arouse interest, and may in themselves be incriminating in countries where encryption is illegal. * Surveillance is the monitoring of the behavior, activities, or other changing information, usually of people for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting them. This can include observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment (such as CCTV cameras), or interception of electronically transmitted information (such as Internet traffic or phone calls); and it can include simple, relatively no- or low- technology methods such as human intelligence agents watching a person and postal interception. The word surveillance comes from a French phrase for \\"watching over\\" (\\"sur\\" means \\"from above\\" and \\"veiller\\" means \\"to watch\\"). * TEMPEST is a National Security Agency specification and NATO certification referring to spying on information systems through leaking emanations, including unintentional radio or electrical signals, sounds, and vibrations. TEMPEST covers both methods to spy upon others and also how to shield equipment against such spying. The protection efforts are also known as emission security (EMSEC), which is a subset of communications security (COMSEC).https://fas.org/spp/starwars/program/sbl/09a_10_Jul_DD_254_Attach.htmhttp://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/saf_cio_a6/publication/afi33-200/afi33-200.pdf In popular culture=In books In the books of such authors as thriller writer Grant Blackwood, espionage writer Tom Clancy, and spy novelists Ian Fleming and John le Carré, characters frequently engage in tradecraft, e.g., making or retrieving items from \\"dead drops\\", \\"dry cleaning\\", and wiring, using, or sweeping for intelligence gathering devices, such as cameras or microphones hidden in the subjects' quarters, vehicles, clothing, or accessories. In film * In the 2012 film Zero Dark Thirty, the main CIA operative Maya, noted that her suspected senior al-Queda courier was exhibiting signs of using tradecraft. * In the 2006 action thriller motion picture Mission: Impossible III, an operative hid a microdot on the back of a postage stamp. The microdot contained a magnetically stored video file. * In the 2003 sci-fi film Paycheck, a microdot is a key plot element; the film shows how well a microdot can be made to blend into an environment and how much information such a dot can carry.

The genus Cladophora contains many species that are very hard to tell apart and classify, mainly because of the great variation in their appearances, which is affected by habitat, age and environmental conditions.Gestinari, L., et al. (2010). Distribution of Cladophora species (Cladophorales, Chlorophyta) along the Brazilian Coast. Phytotaxa 14 22. Unlike Spirogyra the filaments of Cladophora branch and do not undergo conjugation. There are two multicellular stages in its life cycle - a haploid gametophyte and a diploid sporophyte - which look highly similar. The only way to tell the two stages apart is to either count their chromosomes, or examine their offspring. The haploid gametophyte produces haploid gametes by mitosis and the diploid sporophyte produces haploid spores by meiosis. The only visible difference between the gametes and spores of Cladophora is that the gametes have two flagella and the spores have four. The Cladophora species can be a major nuisance causing major alteration to benthic conditions linked particularly with increased phosphorus loading.

Laotian Mekong weed Kháy phen served as an appetizer dish. In Laos, Cladophora spp. (ໄຄ \\"river weed\\" or more precisely ໄຄຫີນ \\"rock river weed\\") are commonly eaten as a delicacy and usually known in English under the name \\"Mekong weed\\". The algae grow on underwater rocks and thrive in clear spots of water in the Mekong river basin. They are harvested 1 to 5 months a year and most often eaten in dry sheets (ໄຄແຜ່ນ kaipen -kháy sheets-), similar to Crispy Chinese Seaweed or Japanese nori, though much cruder in their format. Luang Prabang's speciality is dry khai with sesame (kaipen), while Vang Vieng is famous for its roasted kháy sheets. They can be eaten in strips as an appetizer, with a meal or as a snack with Beer Lao. Luang Prabang kháy sheets kaipen are the most readily available form of Mekong weed and are famous throughout the country and in the neighbouring Isaan, though difficult to find beyond Vientiane. Mekong weed can also be eaten raw, in soups, or cooked as in a Lao amok preparation called ຫມົກໄຄ . Cladophora as an asset and a nuisance  The genus Cladophora is cosmopolitan and accordingly infestations cannot often be regarded logically as being invasive. Where they occur they may at various times be seen as beneficial, as a nuisance, or an outright pest. Modest growth of Cladophora is generally harmless; the growth is an important food for many fish and other aquatic animals, as a buffer for the sequestration of nutrients in the water body and for protection of some aquatic organisms from solar ultraviolet radiation. Where Cladophora becomes a pest is generally where special circumstances cause such drastic overgrowth that algal blooms develop and form floating mats. Typical examples include where hypertrophication or high mortality of rival organisms produce high concentrations of dissolved phosphorus. Extensive floating mats prevent circulation that is necessary for the aeration of deeper water and, by blocking the light, they kill photosynthesising organisms growing beneath. The mats interfere with the fishing industry by clogging nets and preventing the use of lines. Where they wash ashore the masses of rotting material reduce shoreline property values along water bodies such as the Great Lakes in the United States.Great Lakes Science Center Quagga mussel populations have increased tremendously during the same time frame as the blooming of Cladophora, though their ecological relationships are not yet clear and may be complex.

Faravahar (Persian: فَرَوَهَر‎), also known as Forouhar (Persian: فُروهَر‎) , or Farr-e Kiyâni (فَرِّ کیانی), is one of the most well-known symbols of Iran (Persia), and Zoroastrianism, the primary religion of Iran before the Muslim conquest of Iran, and of Iranian nationalism. There are various interpretations of what the faravahar symbolizes, and there is no universal consensus except to note that it does not represent the fravashi. The Faravahar is one of the best known symbols of Iran and is often worn as pendant among Iranians, including Zoroastrians and Kurds and has become a secular national and cultural symbol. Etymology The New Persian word is read as forouhar or faravahar (pronounced as furōhar/furūhar in Classical Persian). The Middle Persian forms were frawahr (Book Pahlavi: plwʾhl, Manichaean: prwhr), frōhar (recorded in Pazend as ; it is a later form of the previous form), and fraward (Book Pahlavi: plwlt', Manichaean: frwrd), which was directly from Old Persian *fravarti-. The Avestan language form was fravaṣ̌i (). In Iranian and Zoroastrian culture Faravahar on a coin of Vadfradad I (Autophradates I). The faravahar was depicted on the tombs of Achaemenid kings, such as Darius the Great () and Artaxerxes III (). The symbol was also used on some of the coin mints of the frataraka of Persis in the late 3rd and early 2nd BC centuries. Even after the Arab conquest of Iran, Zoroastrianism continued to be part of Iranian culture. Throughout the year, festivities are celebrated such as Nowruz, Mehregan, and Chaharshanbe Suri which relate to Zoroastrian festivals and calendar. These are remnants of Zoroastrian traditions. From the start of the 20th century, the faravahar icon found itself in public places and became a known icon among Iranians. The Shahnameh by Ferdowsi is Iran's national epic and contains stories (partly historical and partly mythical) from pre-Islamic Zoroastrian times. The tomb of Ferdowsi (built early 1930), which is visited by numerous Iranians every year, contains the faravahar icon as well. Whilst being used by both modern day Zoroastrians and Persians, it is important to note the symbol is neither Zoroastrian nor Persian in its origin. It originates as an Mesopotamian Assyrian depiction of the wing deity Ashur. After the Achaemenian dynasty, the image of the farohar was no longer present in Persian art or architecture. The Parthians, Sassanians and Islamic kings that followed did not use the image. It was not until the 20th century, over 2000 years later, that the symbol re-emerged thanks to the work of Parsi scholar, Jamshedji Maneckji Unvala who published two articles in 1925 and 1930. Unvala's work was discredited by Irach Jehangir Sorabji Taraporewala, who refuted the idea that the winged figure represented Ahura Mazda. Taraporewala suggested that the figures used in Persian reliefs were meant to depict khvarenah or royal glory to reflect the perceived divine empowerment of kings, and, therefore, has no true spiritual meaning. This view was later supported by Alireza Shapour Shahbazi and Mary Boyce. The Sun Throne, the imperial seat of Iran, has visual implications of the Farahavar. The sovereign would be seated in the middle of the throne, which is shaped like a platform or bed that is raised from the ground. This religious-cultural symbol was adapted by the Pahlavi dynasty to represent the Iranian nation. In modern Zoroastrianism, one of the interpretations of the faravahar is that it is a representation of the human soul and its development along with a visual guide of good conduct. Another popular interpretation is that it is a visual representation of a Fravashi, though Fravashis are described in Zoroastrian literature as being feminine. One of the most prevalent views in academia as to the meaning of the faravahar is that it represents Khvarenah, the divine power and royal glory. Although there are a number of interpretations of the individual elements of the symbol, most are recent interpretations and there is still debate as to its meaning. After the Islamic Revolution of 1979, the Lion and Sun, which was part of Iran's original national flag, was banned by the government from public places in order to prevent people from being reminded of life prior to the revolution. Nevertheless, faravahar icons were not removed and as a result, the faravahar icon became a national symbol for Iranians, and it became tolerated by the government as opposed to the Lion and Sun. The winged discs has a long history in the art, religion, and culture of the ancient Near and Middle East, being about 4000 years old in usage and noted as also symbolizing Ashur, Shamash, and other deities.

The building is situated at Kumartoli along the banks of the Buriganga River in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Construction was started in 1859 and was completed in 1872. It was constructed in the Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture. It has been designated as a national museum. History Ahsan Manzil in 1965 In Mughal era, there was a garden house of Sheikh Enayet Ullah, the landlord of Jamalpur Porgona (district), in this place. Sheikh Enayet Ullah was a very charming person. He acquired a very big area in Kumortuli (Kumartuli) and included it in his garden house. Here he built a beautiful palace and named it \\"Rongmohol\\" (Rangmahal). He used to enjoy here keeping beautiful girls collected from the country and abroad, dressing them with gorgeous dresses and expensive ornaments. There is a saying that, the foujdar of Dhaka (representative of mughal emperor) was attracted to one of the beautiful girls. He invited Sheikh Enayet Ullah to a party one night and killed him in a conspiracy when he was returning home. That girl also committed suicide in anger and sorrow. There was a grave of Sheikh Enayet Ullah in the north-east corner of the palace yard which was ruined in the beginning of the 20th century. Probably in the period of Nawab Alibardi Khan around 1740 century, Sheikh Moti Ullah, the son of Sheikh Enayet Ullah, sold the property to the French traders. There was a French trading house beside this property. The trading house became wealthier after purchasing this property. In that time, French traders could do business here without paying any taxes by a decree from the emperor Aurangzeb. In that time, the French became very wealthy by doing business here in competition with the English and other European companies. They made a big palace and dug a pond for sweet water in the newly purchased property. The pond still exists in the compound of Ahsan Manzil which was called \\"Les Jalla\\" in that time. In the English-French war, French got defeated and all their properties were captured by the English. On 22 June 1757, the French left the trading house with a fleet of 35 boats from the river station of Buriganga in front of Kumartuli. In 1785, the French transferred the property to a French tradesman named Mr. Champigni, and retaken it at 1801. According to Paris agreement of 1814, the French claimed all their left properties at Dhaka, and in 1827 the property was again returned to the French. For the increasing power of the English, the French was forced to leave subcontinent. They decided to sell all their properties in Dhaka. So in 1830, the trading house of Kumartuli was purchased by the established landlord of Dhaka, Khwaja Alimullah. After some renovation work, the trading house became the residence of Khwaja Alimullah. In his time, a stable and a family mosque was added in the compound. After his death, his son Khwaja Abdul Ghani made a great flourish to the property, and named it \\"Ahsan Manzil\\" after his son Khwaja Ahsanullah. In the east side of the old building, he made a new building with a different design, and also done great renovation work to the old building. Since then, the old building was called \\"Ondor Mohol\\" and the new building was called \\"Rong mohol\\". In the evening of 7 April 1888, a devastating tornado hit Dhaka city causing great damage. Ahsan Manzil was severely damaged and abandoned. An English engineer from Kolkata arrived here to examine the palace. He gave opinion that except for the \\"Rangmahal\\", all the other parts of the palace would have to be reconstructed. So Khwaja Abdul Ghani and his son Khwaja Ahsanullah turned their full attention to rebuild the palace. Both of the buildings were reconstructed during that time with a new design and supervised by the local engineer Gobinda Chandra Roy. The old French building was reconstructed to a two storied building keeping similarity to the Rangmahal. A gangway was made with wood connecting the first floors of the two buildings. The most beautiful thing made in this time was the dome, which made the palace so beautiful. After the death of Khwaja Ahsanullah in 1901, the glory of Ahsan Manzil was ended. His successors could not continue the glory because of the internal family quarrel. They rented different parts of the palace to tenants, who actually made it a slum. In 1952, govt. acquired the property and left in supervision of the Dhaka Nawab court. In 1985, Dhaka National Museum acquired the property and made it a museum following a massive restoration programme which utilised historic photographs of the property.  Description and construction  Ahsan Manzil is one of the most significant architectural monuments of Bangladesh. The building structure was established on a raised platform of 1 meter, the two- storied palace measures 125.4m by 28.75m. The height of the ground floor is 5 meters and the height of the first floor is 5.8 meters. The thickness of the walls of the palace is about 0.78 meters. There are porticos of 5 meters height on the northern and southern sides of the palace. The building has a broad front-facing the Buriganga River. On the river side, an open spacious stairway leads right up to the second portal and on their stands the grand triple- arched portals. There was once a fountain in the garden in front of the stairs which does not exist today. All along the north and the south side of the building run spacious verandahs with an open terrace projected in the middle. The palace Ahsan Manzil is divided into two parts: the eastern side and the western side. The eastern building with the dome is called the Rangmahal and the western side with the living rooms is called Andarmahal. The high octagonal dome is placed on the central round room. There is a large drawing room, card room, library, state room and two other guest rooms are located on the east side of the palace. The ballroom, the Hindustani room and few residential rooms are situated on the western side. A beautiful vaulted artificial ceiling, made of wood, decorates the drawing room and the Jalsaghar. A splendid dining hall and few smaller rooms are placed on the west part. The floors of the dining and Darbar Halls are decorated with white, green and yellow colored ceramic tiles. The famous store room, where the valuables of the Nawabs used to be stored, was in the middle of the five rooms located in the western half of the ground floor. Along with those rooms a Darbar Hall or assembly hall and a chest room is also place there. Dome of Ahsan Manzil There are attractive wooden stairs in the room that is attached to the north of the domed room. The balusters were ornamented with vine leaves made of iron along the railing of the stairs. The wooden ceiling of the room, decorated with geometric designs, is very elegant. The verandas and rooms are covered with marble. The doorways are placed within semicircular arches. The inner doors had multi-colored glasses. Wooden beams supported the roof of these rooms. The architecture and the decoration is one of a kind in whole Bangladesh. The construction of the famous dome of the Ahsan Mazil, which is at the center of the palace, took a lot tedious planning. The square room on the ground floor was built with a round shape and brickworks were done around the corners. To give the room an octagonal shape, squinches were given around the roof corners. The eight corners of the octagon was slanted gradually to make the dome look like the bud of a lotus ( kumud kali). The peak of this dome is 27.13 m above the ground. Ahsan Manzil was severely damaged during the tornado that occurred on 7 April 1888.the western block of Andermahal was completely demolished and later it was entirely rebuilt. The present day dome, which is situated on the top, was built during the time of reconstruction. This place was also damaged during the earthquake of 1897 but Nawab Khwaja Ahsanullah repaired the whole place again.  Glory days  Nawab Sir Salimullah with his family in front of Ahsan Manzil In 1874, Lord Northbrook, Governor General of India attended an evening function in the palace when he came to lay the foundation of a water works installed by Nawab Abdul Ghani. In 1888, Lord Dufferin also accepted the hospitality offered at Ahsan Manzil. In 1904 Lord Curzon, on a visit to East Bengal, stayed in this palace on 18 and 19 February to win public support for the proposed Partition of Bengal. Ahsan Manzil, an architectural treasure, is a witness to many historical events of Bangladesh. From the last part of the 19th century to the initial years of Pakistan, the Muslim leadership of East Bengal emerged from this palace. The nawabs of Dhaka used to conduct their court affairs here as chief of the panchayet (village council) everyday. Many anti-Congress meetings were held here under the patronization of Nawab Ahsanullah, a staunch believer in Muslim identity. Almost all the Viceroys, Governors and Lieutenant Governors of British India who visited Dhaka spent some time at the Ahsan Manzil. Almost all political activities of Nawab Khwaja Salimullah centred round this palace. Ahsan Manzil was the cradle of the All India Muslim League. With the decline of the Nawabs of Dhaka, Ahsan Manzil also started to decline.  Decline  In 1952, the Dhaka Nawab State was acquired under the East Bengal Estate Acquisition Act; it became impossible for the successors of the Nawabs to maintain the palace due to financial constraints. Nawab Khwaja Habibullah started living at Paribag Green House soon after the acquisition of the zamindari. The palace was soon on the verge of collapse as successors rented out rooms without considering its dignity. Over the years illegal occupants turned the place into a filthy slum. After the independence of Bangladesh, most of the nawab family went to abroad in search of a better livelihood and work. On 1974, the owners of the palace decided to put it up for auction.  Renovation  Rare Exhibits inside Ahsan Manzil Recognizing the historical and architectural importance of the Ahsan Manzil, the government of Bangladesh took the initiative to renovate it. In 1985, Ahsan Manzil and its surroundings were acquired. After the completion of the renovation work in 1992 under the supervision of the Directorate of Public Works and Architecture, it was brought under the control of Bangladesh National Museum (20 September 1992). A museum has been established there. Considering the historical importance and architectural significance of Ahsan Manzil palace, the government was trying to conserve it since the later part of the Pakistani rule. The father of nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman canceled its auction proposal option. On 2 November 1974, he ordered to establish a museum and tourist center after its proper conservation. After the implementation of the work on the museum started, most of the nawab's house area along with the half of the portion of the Andarmahal remained beyond acquisition. The total area of acquired land was 5.65 acres. Out of that 0.68 acres from northern side was given to Dhaka City Corporation to establish a super market and 4.96 acres of land with the palace buildings remained for museum purpose. In 1986, the work began according to the above order keeping the original structure undisturbed and reconstructing the old environment as far as possible. After the completion of the renovation work in 1992, under the supervision of the Directorate of Public Works and Architecture, it was brought under the control of Bangladesh National Museum (20 September 1992). A museum has been established there.

Japan Tobacco trades in the United Kingdom as Gallaher Ltd. History The business was founded in 1857 by Tom Gallaher in Derry, Ireland (now part of Northern Ireland.) By 1896, he had opened the largest tobacco factory in the world in Belfast. The business was incorporated on 28 March 1896 to \\"carry on in all their branches the businesses of tobacco, cigar, cigarettes and snuff manufacture\\". Formerly produced in London and Dublin, Gallaher moved production to Belfast (cigarettes) and Wales (cigars) in the early 20th century. Gallaher went on to acquire a number of rival companies including J. A. Pattreiouex (1937), J. R. Freeman (1947), Cope Bros & Co (1952) and Benson & Hedges (1955).http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20111202195250/http://competition- commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1960_1969/fulltext/024c04.pdf On 4 August 2000 Gallaher completed the acquisition of Liggett Ducat, Russia's number one cigarette brand. In January 2002, Gallaher became the 100% owner of Austria's former nationalised biggest tobacco-company Austria Tabak. In 2002 US tobacco firm Reynolds formed Reynolds-Gallaher International to access cigarette sales in most countries in the European Union. The agreement was scheduled to run through 2012 but in May 2007, as a result of the acquisition of Gallaher Group by Japan Tobacco, it was announced that this joint-venture would cease in November 2007. Japan Tobacco became the sole owner of the Gallaher Group on 18 April 2007, in the largest ever foreign acquisition in Japanese history. The closure of the former J. R. Freeman's factory in Cardiff was announced in September 2007, with all work scheduled to move to the Ballymena factory by September 2009.184 tobacco jobs go at city plant BBC Wales – 27 September 2007 In 2015, JTI Gallaher announced the closure of their Ballymena operations with all work due to re-locate to Eastern Europe in a cost saving measure by 2017. This resulted in the loss of over 1000 jobs in the town and ceasing of tobacco production in Ireland by Gallaher's after more than 100 years. Operations Until acquisition by Japan Tobacco, Gallaher operated primarily in the United Kingdom and Europe, with smaller operations in Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Gallaher was the third largest of the three major British tobacco groups after British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco. Gallaher-owned brands included Benson & Hedges (with Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco, and Japan Tobacco), Silk Cut, Sterling, Mayfair, Crystal, Nil, Kensitas Club, Senior Service, Dos Hermanos, Gold Seal, Amber Leaf, Sobranie and Hamlet Cigars. Benson & Hedges Djarum Black The Djarum brands included Djarum Super, Djarum Black, Djarum Coklat, Djarum 76, Djarum Istimewa, Djarum Special, Djarum Menthol, Djarum Vanilla, Djarum Cherry, LA Lights, Mustang, Mr. Brown, and Envio Mild. Djarum Group relationship with Gallaher Group has not been properly confirmed, since PT Djarum is a private Indonesian company, with majority of its shares own by Hartono family.

The nearest land mass from it is Luzon, the largest island in the Philippines. It is a disputed territory claimed by the Republic of the Philippines through the 1734 Velarde map, while the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China (Taiwan) claim it through the internationally invalidated nine-dash line (originally an eleven-dash line which included waters in the Gulf of Tonkin). The shoal's status is often discussed in conjunction with other territorial disputes in the South China Sea such as those involving the Spratly Islands, and the 2012 Scarborough Shoal standoff. It was administered by the Philippines as part of its Zambales province, until 2012, when a standoff was initiated by China through the use of warships against fishing boats. In 2013, the Philippines solely filed an international case against China in the UN-backed court in The Hague, Netherlands. In 2016, the court declared that China's so-called nine-dash line claim in the entire South China Sea was invalid, while upholding the sovereign rights of the Philippines in the area. China rejected the UN-backed international court's decision, sending more warships in Scarborough Shoal and the Spratly Islands, while a multitude of nations backed the Tribunal's ruling, including Australia, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, India, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Myanmar, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, & United States, as well as claimants to the area such as Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. The shoal was named by Captain Philip D'Auvergne, whose East India Company East Indiaman Scarborough grounded on one of the rocks on 12 September 1784, before sailing on to China,W. Gilbert (1804) A New Nautical Directory for the East-India and China Navigation .., pp.480=482. although it already had a Spanish name recorded in the 1734 Velarde map of Spanish Philippines.  Geography  Scarborough Shoal forms a triangle-shaped chain of reefs and rocks with a perimeter of . It covers an area of , including an inner lagoon. The shoal's highest point, South Rock, is above sea-level at high tide. Located north of it is a channel, approximately wide and deep, leading into the lagoon. Several other coral rocks encircle the lagoon, forming a large atoll. The shoal is about west of Subic Bay. To the east of the shoal is the deep Manila Trench. The nearest landmass is Palauig, Zambales on Luzon island in the Philippines, due east. History A number of countries have made historic claims of the use of Scarborough Shoal. China has claimed that a 1279 Yuan dynasty map and subsequent surveys by the royal astronomer Guo Shoujing carried out during Kublai Khan's reign established that Scarborough Shoal (then called Zhongsha islands) were used since the thirteenth century by Chinese fishermen. However, no such 1279 map has been released by China to the public. The 1734 Velarde map shows actual Spanish Philippine control over Scarborough Shoal, as well as islands off of Palawan, identified as the Spratly Islands. The map was one of the key evidences in the Philippines v. China international case that debunked China's so-called nine- dash line claims. Panacot shown off the coast of Central Luzon in the 1734 map During the Spanish period of the Philippines, a 1734 map was made, which clearly named Scarborough Shoals as Panacot, a feature under complete sovereignty of Spanish Philippines. The shoal's current name was chosen by Captain Philip D'Auvergne, whose East India Company East Indiaman Scarborough briefly grounded on one of the rocks on 12 September 1784, before sailing on to China. When the Philippines was granted independence in the 19th century and 20th century, Scarborough Shoal was passed by the colonial governments to the sovereign Republic of the Philippines. The 2012 Scarborough Shoal standoff between China and the Philippines led to a situation where access to the shoal was restricted by the People's Republic of China. The expected intervention of the United States to protect its ally through an existing mutual defense treaty did not commence after the United States indirectly stated that it does not recognize any nation's sovereignty over Scarborough Shoal, leading to strained ties between the Philippines and the United States. In January 2013, the Philippines formally initiated arbitration proceedings against China's claim on the territories within the \\"nine-dash line\\" that includes Spratly Islands and Scarborough Shoal, which it said is \\"unlawful\\" under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). An arbitration tribunal was constituted under Annex VII of UNCLOS and it was decided in July 2013 that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) would function as registry and provide administrative duties in the proceedings. On 12 July 2016, the arbitrators of the tribunal of PCA agreed unanimously with the Philippines. They concluded in the award that there was no evidence that China had historically exercised exclusive control over the waters or resources, hence there was \\"no legal basis for China to claim historic rights\\" over the nine-dash line. Accordingly, the PCA tribunal decision is ruled as final and non-appealable by either country. The tribunal also criticized China's land reclamation projects and its construction of artificial islands in the Spratly Islands, saying that it had caused \\"severe harm to the coral reef environment\\". It also characterized Taiping Island and other features of the Spratly Islands as \\"rocks\\" under UNCLOS, and therefore are not entitled to a 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. China however rejected the ruling, calling it \\"ill- founded\\". Taiwan, which currently administers Taiping Island, the largest of the Spratly Islands, also rejected the ruling. In late 2016, following meetings between the Philippine president Duterte and his PRC counterparts, the PRC \\"verbally\\" allowed Filipino fishermen to access the shoals for fishing, sparking criticism as \\"allowing\\" would mean China is implying that it owns the territory. In January 2018, it was revealed that for every 3,000 pesos' worth of fish catch by Filipino fisherfolk, China took them in exchange for \\"two bottles of mineral water\\" worth 20 pesos. On June 14, 2018, China's destruction of Scarborough Shoal's reefs surged to an extent which they became visible via satellites, as confirmed by the University of the Philippines Diliman.  Land reclamation and other activities in the surrounding area  A March 2016 article by the CSIS Asia Maritime transparency Initiative said that satellite imagery had shown no signs of any land reclamation, dredging or construction activities in Scarborough shoal and the only vessels present were a Chinese civilian ship anchored within the mouth of the lagoon, which has been typical for several years, and two Filipino trimaran-type fishing ships outside the shoal. However, according to the then U.S. chief of naval operations Admiral John Richardson that did not mean that Chinese ships had not performed surveys in preparation for reclamation. In September 2016 during the ASEAN summit, the Philippine government produced photos that it said showed fresh PRC construction activity at the shoal. A US administration official questioned the Philippine's claim, saying the United States had not detected any unusual activity at Scarborough Shoal. Also in September 2016, the New York Times reported that PRC activities at the Shoal continued in the form of naval patrols and hydrographic surveys. In March 2017 the mayor of Sansha City said China was to begin preparatory work for an environmental monitoring station on Scarborough Shoal. PRC activities in and around the Scarborough Shoal have drawn criticism from US officials. In March 2017 U.S. Senators Marco Rubio and Ben Cardin introduced the South China Sea and East China Sea Sanctions Act which would impose sanctions for Chinese entities and people helping to build South and East China Sea projects. In June 2019 the Philippine Coast Guard spotted a Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy warship, alongside two China Coast Guard vessels, and two Chinese maritime militia vessels near the shoal. In September 2019, Antonio Carpio, a former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines, said that China would try to reclaim the Scarborough shoal within Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte's term before it signs the Asean-China Code of Conduct because Duterte had said that Beijing could not be stopped from building because it was too powerful. Academic Jay Batongbacal said that the visiting forces agreement between the Philippines and the United States deterred the transformation of Scarborough Shoal by the PRC into an artificial island, saying, \\"Scarborough Shoal is the only piece left in the puzzle that they’re trying to build. They can now completely exclude other countries from the South China Sea militarily if they're able to put into place all of these military bases.\\"  Sovereignty dispute =Claims by China and Taiwan Map depicting the ROC and PRC's territorial claims in South China Sea, with Scarborough Shoal depicted within the Nine-dotted line of 1947. In contrast, the Philippine claim is backed by maps dated 1734. The People's Republic of China and Republic of China Taiwan claim that Chinese people discovered the shoal centuries ago and that there is a long history of Chinese fishing activity in the area. The shoal lies within the nine-dotted line drawn by China on maps marking its claim to islands and relevant waters consistent with United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) within the South China Sea.Rosenberg, David, \\"Governing the South China Sea: From Freedom of the Seas to Ocean Enclosure Movements\\" , Harvard Asia Quarterly/southchinasea.org, \\"2013/02\\". An article published in May 2012 in the PLA Daily states that Chinese astronomer Guo Shoujing went to the island in 1279, under the Yuan dynasty, as part of an empire-wide survey called \\"Measurement of the Four Seas\\" (四海測驗), however, no such 13th century map has been made public by China nor such evidence on the existence of the map is known, because non of imperial Chinese dynasties except for the Qing Empire (1644-1912) had published any official maps about \\"China's territories.\\" In effect, the ancient Chinese political philosophy of \\"All- Under-Heaven\\" (Tianxia) which assumed the Son of Heaven who governed the \\"Central Kingdom\\" was entitled to govern the world makes China usually lack of legal evidence needed in modern territorial disputes. See under \\"Irrefutable proof 1: China discovered the Huangyuan Island long time ago\\" 铁证一：中国早发现黄岩岛. In 1979 historical geographer Han Zhenhua (韩振华) was among the first scholars to claim that the point called \\"Nanhai\\" (literally, \\"South Sea\\") in that astronomical survey referred to Scarborough Shoal. A rough English translation of this article can be found here . In 1980 during a conflict with Vietnam for sovereignty over the Paracel Islands (Xisha Islands), however, the Chinese government issued an official document claiming that \\"Nanhai\\" in the 1279 survey was located in the Paracels.. This document claims that \\"the Nanhai measuring point was 'where the pole star rises at 15 [ancient Chinese] degrees [above the horizon]', which should correspond to 14.47 [modern] degrees; adding a margin of error of about 1 degree, its location falls precisely on today's Xisha Islands\\" (南海这个测点‘北极出地一十五度’应为北纬14度47分，加上一度左右的误差，其位置也正好在今西沙群岛), which shows that \\"the Xisha Islands were inside Chinese territory during the Yuan dynasty\\" (西沙群岛在元代是在中国的疆界之内). Historical geographer Niu Zhongxun defended this view in several articles.See for instance . In 1990, a historian called Zeng Zhaoxuan (曾昭璇) argued instead that the Nanhai measuring point was located in Central Vietnam.. Among other evidence, Zeng cites a Chinese geologist who argues that the Scarborough Shoal was still submerged under water during the Yuan dynasty. Historian of astronomy Chen Meidong (陈美东) and historian of Chinese science Nathan Sivin have since agreed with Zeng's position in their respective books about Guo Shoujing... In 1935, China, as the Republic of China (ROC), regarded the shoal as part of the Zhongsha Islands. That position has since been maintained by both the ROC, which now governs Taiwan, and the People's Republic of China (PRC).. In 1947 the shoal was given the name Minzhu Jiao (). In 1983 the People's Republic of China renamed it Huangyan Island with Minzhu Jiao reserved as a second name.. In 1956 Beijing protested Philippine remarks that the South China Sea islands in close proximity to Philippine territory should belong to the Philippines. China's Declaration on the territorial Sea, promulgated in 1958, says in part, China reaffirmed its claim of sovereignty over the Zhongsha Islands in its 1992 Law on the territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone. China claims all the islands, reefs, and shoals within a U-shaped line in the South China Sea drawn in 1947 as its territory. Scarborough shoal lies within this area. China further asserted its claim shortly after the departure of the US Navy force from Subic, Zambales, Philippines. In the late 1970s, many scientific expedition activities organized by State Bureau of Surveying, National Earthquake Bureau and National Bureau of Oceanography were held in the shoal and around this area. In 1980, a stone marker reading \\"South China Sea Scientific Expedition\\" was installed on the South Rock, but was removed by Philippines in 1997. English translation of original Chinese text available here . Claim by the Philippines  This is a 1774 reproduction of the 1734 map of the Philippine Islands depicting Scarborough Shoal as Panacot. In contrast, China and Taiwan's claims are backed by a map dated 1947. The Philippines state that its assertion of sovereignty over the shoal is based on the juridical criteria established by public international law on the lawful methods for the acquisition of sovereignty. Among the criteria (effective occupation, cession, prescription, conquest, and accretion), the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) has asserted that the country exercised both effective occupation and effective jurisdiction over the shoal, which it terms Bajo de Masinloc, since its independence. Thus, it claims to have erected flags in some islands and a lighthouse which it reported to the International Maritime Organization. It also asserts that the Philippine and US Naval Forces have used it as impact range and that its Department of Environment and Natural Resources has conducted scientific, topographic and marine studies in the shoal, while Filipino fishermen regularly use it as fishing ground and have always considered it their own. The DFA also claims that the name Bajo de Masinloc (translated as \\"under Masinloc\\") itself identifies the shoal as a particular political subdivision of the Philippine Province of Zambales, known as Masinloc. As basis, the Philippines cites the Island of Palmas Case, where the sovereignty of the island was adjudged by the international court in favor of the Netherlands because of its effective jurisdiction and control over the island despite the historic claim of Spain. Thus, the Philippines argues that the historic claim of China over the Scarborough Shoal still needs to be substantiated by a historic title, since a claim by itself is not among the internationally recognized legal basis for acquiring sovereignty over territory. It also asserts that there is no indication that the international community has acquiesced to China's historical claim, and that the activity of fishing of private Chinese individuals, claimed to be a traditional exercise among these waters, does not constitute a sovereign act of the Chinese state. The Philippine government argues that since the legal basis of its claim is based on the international law on acquisition of sovereignty, the Exclusive Economic Zone claim on the waters around Scarborough is different from the sovereignty exercised by the Philippines in the shoal. The Philippine government has proposed taking the dispute to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) as provided in Part XV of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, but the Chinese government has rejected this, insisting on bilateral discussions.PART XV : SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES , UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA : AGREEMENT RELATING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PART XI OF THE CONVENTION , The United Nations. The Philippines also claims that as early as the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, Filipino fishermen were already using the area as a traditional fishing ground and shelter during bad weather.. Several official Philippine maps published by Spain and United States in 18th and 20th centuries show Scarborough Shoal as Philippine territory. The 18th-century map \\"Carta hydrographica y chorographica de las Islas Filipinas\\" (1734) shows the Scarborough Shoal then was named as Panacot Shoal. The map also shows the shape of the shoal as consistent with the current maps available as today. In 1792, another map drawn by the Malaspina expedition and published in 1808 in Madrid, Spain also showed Bajo de Masinloc as part of Philippine territory. The map showed the route of the Malaspina expedition to and around the shoal. It was reproduced in the Atlas of the 1939 Philippine Census, which was published in Manila a year later and predates the controversial 1947 Chinese South China Sea Claim Map that shows no Chinese name on it. Another topographic map drawn in 1820 shows the shoal, named there as \\"Bajo Scarburo,\\" as a constituent part of Sambalez (Zambales province). During the 1900s, Mapa General, Islas Filipinas, Observatorio de Manila, and US Coast and Geodetic Survey Map include the Scarborough Shoal named as \\"Baju De Masinloc.\\" A map published in 1978 by the Philippine National Mapping and Resource Information Authority, however, did not indicate Scarborough Shoal as part of the Philippines. Scholar Li Xiao Cong stated in his published paper that Panacot Shoal is not Scarborough Shoal, in the 1778 map \\"A chart of the China Sea and Philippine Islands with the Archipelagos of Felicia and Soloo\\", Scarborough shoal and 3 other shoals Galit, Panacot and Lumbay were all shown independently. Li also pointed out that the three shoals were also shown on Chinese maps which were published in 1717. In 1957, the Philippine government conducted an oceanographic survey of the area and together with the US Navy force based in then U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay in Zambales, used the area as an impact range for defense purposes. An 8.3 meter high flag pole flying a Philippine flag was raised in 1965. An iron tower that was to serve as a small lighthouse was also built and operated the same year.What’s become of the MMDA?, Philippine Star, 2 April 2008 In 1992, the Philippine Navy rehabilitated the lighthouse and reported it to the International Maritime Organization for publication in the List of Lights. , the military-maintained lighthouse is non-operational.COAST GUARD DISTRICT NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION - CENTRAL LUZON LIGHTSTATIONS (archived from the original on 2010-01-16) Map showing territory claimed by the Philippines, including internal waters, territorial sea, international treaty limits and exclusive economic zone. Historically, the Philippine boundary has been defined by its 3 treaties, Treaty of Paris (1898), Treaty of Washington (1900) and \\"Convention regarding the boundary between the Philippine Archipelago and the State of North Borneo\\". Many analysts consider that the 1900 Treaty of Washington concerned only the islands of Sibutu and Cagayan de Sulu., but a point of view argued that Scarborough Shoal has been transferred to the United States based on the Treaty of Washington (1900), ignoring the fact that the cession documents from the United States to the Philippines did not have any reference to the Scarborough Shoal. The DFA asserts that the basis of Philippine sovereignty and jurisdiction over the rock features of Bajo de Masinloc are not premised on the cession by Spain of the Philippine archipelago to the United States under the Treaty of Paris, and argues that the matter that the rock features of Bajo de Masinloc are not included or within the limits of the Treaty of Paris as alleged by China is therefore immaterial and of no consequence.Philippine Position on Bajo de Masinloc and the Waters Within its Vicinity (18 April 2012), The Department of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the Philippines.PH sovereignty based on Unclos, principles of international law (20 April 2012), The Department of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the Philippines (as reported by globalnation.inquirer.net ). Presidential Decree No. 1596 issued onJune11, 1978 asserted that islands designated as the Kalayaan Island Group and comprising most of the Spratly Islands are subject to the sovereignty of the Philippines, and by virtue of the Presidential Decree No. 1599 issued on June 11, 1978 claimed an Exclusive Economic Zone up to from the baselines from which their territorial sea is measured. The Philippines' bilateral dispute with China over the shoal began on April30, 1997 when Filipino naval ships prevented Chinese boats from approaching the shoal. On June 5 of that year, Domingo Siazon, who was then the Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs, testified in front of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the United States Senate that the Shoal was \\"a new issue on overlapping claims between the Philippines and China\\". In 2009, the Philippine Baselines Law of 2009 (RA 9522), authored and sponsored by Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago, was enacted into law. The new law classified the Kalayaan Island Group and the Scarborough Shoal as a regime of islands under the Republic of the Philippines.Philippine Baselines Law of 2009 (March 11, 2009), GMA News. Permanent Court of Arbitration tribunal ruling In January 2013 the Philippines formally initiated arbitration proceedings against the PRC claim on the territories within the \\"nine-dash line\\" that include Scarborough Shoal, which the Philippines claimed is unlawful under the UNCLOS convention. An arbitration tribunal was constituted under Annex VII of UNCLOS and it was decided in July 2013 that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) would function as registry and provide administrative duties in the proceedings. On 12 July 2016 the PCA tribunal agreed unanimously with the Philippines. In its award, it concluded that there is no evidence that China had historically exercised exclusive control over the waters or resources, hence there was \\"no legal basis for China to claim historic rights\\" over the area within the nine- dash line. The tribunal also judged that the PRC had caused \\"severe harm to the coral reef environment\\", and that it had violated the Philippines' sovereign rights in its Exclusive Economic Zone by interfering with Philippine fishing and petroleum exploration by, for example, restricting the traditional fishing rights of Filipino fishermen at Scarborough Shoal. The PRC rejected the ruling, calling it \\"ill-founded\\"\\". Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping insisted that \\"China's territorial sovereignty and marine rights in the South China Sea will not be affected by the so-called Philippines South China Sea ruling in any way\\", nevertheless the PRC would still be \\"committed to resolving disputes\\" with its neighbours. China afterwards sent more warships in the Scarborough Shoal. Numerous countries called on the international community to support the Tribunal ruling & positively acknowledge it. Among them were Australia, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, India, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Myanmar, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, & United States, as well as claimants to the area such as Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines.

The goal of the organization was to liberate Lithuania and re-establish its independence. It planned and executed the June Uprising and established the short-lived Provisional Government of Lithuania. The Government self-disbanded and LAF was banned by Nazi authorities in September 1941. LAF remains controversial due to its anti-Semitic and anti-Polish positions.  Under the USSR  Kazys Škirpa, one of the main founders of LAF LAF was established on 17 November 1940.Tadeusz Piotrowski, Poland's Holocaust, McFarland & Company, 1997, , Google Print, pp. 163-168 Kazys Škirpa, former Lithuanian military attaché to Germany, is often credited as the founder. LAF was meant to unite people of various political beliefs, who wanted to see Lithuania as an independent country, rather than as part of the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany.Bradley Campbell, The Geometry of Genocide: A Study in Pure Sociology, University of Virginia Press, 2015, , p. 179. The Berlin unit, formed by Kazys Škirpa, united mainly former Lithuanian expatriates and diplomats in Germany. It gathered representatives of most major pre-war Lithuanian factions and parties, and within LAF, the most influential were the Nationalist Unionists and the Christian Democrats. As time passed, local LAF units were formed in various Lithuanian cities. The local LAF units were organizing espionage networks. The local LAF units in Lithuanian cities maintained more liberal political views than the Berlin headquarters. Lack of correspondence between the Berlin unit and Lithuanian units prevented discussions of ideology. In Germany, LAF had contact with Wilhelm Franz Canaris and Abwehr, but not the Nazi party. LAF expected that Nazi Germany would attack the Soviet Union and planned to use this occasion for their own rebellion and establishment of independent Lithuania. On 22 April 1941, representatives of Vilnius and Kaunas branches of LAF formed the Provisional Government of Lithuania, i.e. established a list of its members.Sigitas Jegelevičius. 1941 m. Lietuvos laikinosios vyriausybės atsiradimo aplinkybės (Circumstances of establishing provisional government of Lithuania in 1941), Voruta, No. 11 (557), June 11, 2004 LAF formed the Lithuanian underground government planning to take over the country when the Soviet army would be pushed out by the German army. The Provisional Government was mainly formed out of Vilnius and Kaunas sections of LAF. However, two of its members, including the prime minister Kazys Škirpa, were in Germany and were later detained there. Over time, many people from this government, as well as other LAF members, were arrested, executed, or exiled by Soviet authorities.  June Uprising  Leonas Prapuolenis, commander of June Uprising. After Germans banned LAF, was arrested and sent to Dachau concentration camp. LAF activists inspect the deprived T-38 tank from the Red Army in Kaunas Lithuanian activists in Kaunas on June 25, 1941 Germany declared war on the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, and the same day LAF started the June Uprising. LAF partisans aided the Germans. The next day, June 23, independence of Lithuania was declared. In whole Lithuania about 10 000 people participated in June Uprising, 700 of them were killed by retreating Soviet army. LAF freed 3336 political prisoners, detained by the Soviets. Short-handed Provisional Government took power on June 24. On June 21 four members of the government were arrested by the Soviet authorities, supposed prime minister Kazys Škirpa was put under house arrest in Berlin, and another minister was also unable to come. Juozas Ambrazevičius became the prime minister. However, the negotiations with Germany over the recognition of Lithuania failed, as Nazi government had no interest in an independent Lithuania. General feldmarschall Walther von Brauchitsch issued a directive on 26 June 1941 to the commander of Army Group North, under which \\"small armed Lithuanian groups and Lithuanian police\\" should be disarmed and sent to the concentration camps. Disarmament of LAF activists started by Wehrmacht in Kaunas on June 26 and lasted till 28 of June. Last LAF activists were disarmed in Zarasai and Obeliai on 28-29 of June. The German authorities did not use brutal force against its members. Rather, they established their own administrative structures (Reichskommissariat Ostland) and slowly deprived the government of its powers. The government lost all of its power in a few weeks, and seeing no more reason to continue work, dissolved itself in August 1941. LAF as an organization remained. On 15 of September it sent a memorandum About the status of Lithuania after the German Civil Administration started to operate (Apie Lietuvos būklę, vokiečių civilinei administracijai pradėjus veikti) to Germany protesting against the occupation of Lithuania and expressing hopes that Germany would not extend its territory at expense of Lithuania. In response, the Lithuanian Activist Front was banned on September 26; its property confiscated, and its leader Leonas Prapuolenis was arrested and sent to Dachau concentration camp. Other members like Pilypas Narutis- Žukauskas, Petras Paulaitis joined anti-nazi resistance. Controversy Soviet poststamp with LAF overprint Independent Lithuania 1941 06 23 The LAF is a controversial organization because of its anti-Semitic and anti-Polish views and overall collaboration with the Nazi Germany. For example, LAF's manifesto-type essay \\"What Are the Activists Fighting for?\\" states: \\"The Lithuanian Activist Front, by restoring the new Lithuania, is determined to carry out an immediate and fundamental purging of the Lithuanian nation and its land of Jews ...\\".\\"The Murder of the Jews in German-Occupied Lithuania.\\" Paper by Yitzhak Arad delivered at the international conferences in Nida (1997) and Telsiai (2001) on \\"The Vanished World of Lithuanian Jews.\\" https://books.google.com/books?id=mdXRKbcyi5oC page 191 The LAF's pro-Nazi rhetoric and stridently anti-Semitic propaganda that equated Jews with Bolshevism and was widely disseminated in Lithuania prior to and during the June uprising likely encouraged the local population to engage in mass violence against Jews that began prior to the arrival of Nazi forces in the country and continued during the Nazi occupation (1941-1945). More than 95% of Lithuania's Jewish population was massacred during the Nazi occupation—a more complete destruction than befell any other country affected by the Holocaust. Historians attribute this to the massive collaboration in the genocide by the non-Jewish local paramilitaries, though the reasons for this collaboration are still debated.Daniel Brook, \\"Double Genocide. Lithuania wants to erase its ugly history of Nazi collaboration—by accusing Jewish partisans who fought the Germans of war crimes.\\", Slate, July 26, 2015 The Holocaust resulted in the largest-ever loss of life in so short a period of time in the history of Lithuania. The goal of the June uprising organized by the LAF was to seize control of Lithuania as Soviet forces retreated in the face of Germany's attack. During the June uprising, LAF paramilitaries committed many atrocities (rapes, murders, pillage). Even the Germans referred to these \\"allies\\" as \\"organized robbers\\". Also, a number of acts issued by the LAF-instituted Provisional Government of Lithuania discriminated against Jews, one notable example being \\"Žydų padėties nuostatai\\" (English: Regulation on Status of Jews), which according to some authors were never actually adopted and only considered by the Provisional Government. The LAF did unsuccessfully attempt to stop a pogrom organized by Algirdas Klimaitis in Vilijampolė. Upon hearing that Klimaitis was to start a pogrom in Vilijampole suburb on June 25, the LAF staff in Kaunas unsuccessfully attempted to stop him. Later, the Provisional Government of Lithuania detailed Generals Reklaitis and Pundzevičius of the LAF Defense Committee to confer with him. Wearing a Lithuanian flag draped across his chest, Klimaitis met the two former Lithuanians generals and unsuccessfully attempted to justify his actions. The generals succeeded in convincing this upstart that his actions were darkening the Lithuanian name and that he was doing the Nazis' dirty work for them. Among the initial tactics of Nazi authorities was to surreptitiously encourage and involve the local population in attacks on Jews. These tactics are well disclosed in the Schutzstaffel General Brigadeführer and Security Police Chief of the Occupied Eastern Territories Franz Walter Stahlecker 1941 X.15 report to the Reich Minister Heinrich Himmler. In his report to Heinrich Himmler about his tasks (the extermination of Jews in the Baltic states) execution, Franz Walter Stahlecker states that the extermination of Jews in the Wehrmacht occupied territories should be performed in a way that the Nazis would remain \\"clean\\" in front of the history and that there would be no sign of Nazis actual inspiration, organization or conducting, and it should look like that the local population and its institutions in their own initiative performed the execution of the Jewish population. In this regard, the LAF and its paramilitaries initially proved handy. Meanwhile, the LAF-established Provisional Government of Lithuania did little to oppose the anti-Jewish violence and murder carried out by the Nazis and their local collaborators. Its main goal was to protect ethnic Lithuanians and reestablish an independent Lithuania under the patronage of Nazi Germany. Lithuanian Minister of National Defence General Stasys Raštikis (former Commander of the Lithuanian Army) met personally with the Nazi Germany Generals to discuss anti-Jewish violence. He approached the Kaunas War Field Commandant General Robert von Pohl and the Commander of Army Group North Rear Area General Franz von Roques by trying to plead on behalf of the Jews, however they replied that the Gestapo is handling these issues and that they cannot help. Participants of the last session of the Provisional Government of Lithuania, who signed a protest for the Germans actions of suspending the Lithuanian government powers Funeral of perished Lithuanian Activist Front members in Kaunas on June 26, 1941 At the beginning of the occupation, Acting Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of Lithuania Juozas Ambrazevičius (a.k.a., Juozas Brazaitis) convened a meeting in which cabinet ministers participated together with former President Kazys Grinius, Bishop Vincentas Brizgys and others. Ministers expressed distress at the atrocities being committed against the Jews, but advised only that \\"despite all the measures which must be taken against the Jews for their Communist activity and harm done to the German Army, partisans and individuals should avoid public executions of Jews.\\"Sužiedėlis, Saulius. \\"The Burden of 1941\\". Lituanus Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences, Volume 47, No. 4 (Winter 2001). According to Lithuanian-American Holocaust historian Saulius Sužiedėlis, \\"none of this amounted to a public scolding which alone could have persuaded at least some of the Lithuanians who had volunteered or been co-opted into participating in the killings to rethink their behavior.\\" Lithuanian paramilitary battalions formed by the LAF and Provisional Government (known as Lithuanian TDA Battalions) were eventually enlisted by the Nazis to help carry out the Holocaust.Sužiedėlis, Saulius. \\"The Burden of 1941\\". Lituanus Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences, Volume 47, No. 4 (Winter 2001). The Reichskommissariat Ostland, German Civil Administration (Zivilverwaltung) was established on July 17. Instead of using brute force, the Civil Administration slowly removed the government's powers (for example, did not allow to print its decrees in newspapers or broadcast radio announcements) and supplanted its institutions, forcing the Provisional Government to either self-disband or to become a puppet institution. Willing to cooperate if that meant recognition and some semblance to autonomy, the government did not agree to become an instrument of German occupation. The government self-disbanded on August 5 after signing a protest for the Germans actions of suspending the Lithuanian Government powers. Members of the Provisional Government then in corpore went to the Garden of the Vytautas the Great War Museum, where they laid wreath near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the presence of numerous audience. Sicherheitsdienst confiscated the pictures of the wreath-laying ceremony, thinking that it could be dangerous for the German occupation policy in Lithuania. The Lithuanian TDA Battalions were soon taken over by Nazi officials and reorganized into the Lithuanian Auxiliary Police Battalions (Lithuanian version of Schutzmannschaft). The original TDA eventually became the 12th and the 13th Police Battalions. These two units took an active role in mass killings of the Jews in Lithuania and Belarus. Based on the Jäger Report, members of TDA murdered about 26,000 Jews between July and December 1941. Later Juozas Ambrazevičius actively participated in the anti-Nazi underground, four members of the Provisional Government were imprisoned in the Nazi concentration camps. There are allegations by certain journalists that, in 1973, a Committee of the United States Congress made conclusions that there is no Prime Minister of the Provisional Government Juozas Ambrazevičius' and Jonas Šlepetys' guilty in the Holocaust in Lithuania. It is also known that in the summer of 1944 Ambrazevičius left for Germany, and in 1948 for the United States, where he edited a Catholic daily, Darbininkas, and continued his work in the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania in exile. He published a number of leaflets illustrating German and Soviet crimes in Lithuania and the Lithuanian resistance, for example, In the Name of the Lithuanian People (1946) and Appeal to the United Nations on Genocide (1951). In 1964 he published a book Alone, all alone about the Lithuanian armed resistance. The Kremlin actively opposed his activities. In the 1970s he became a subject of interest for the Soviet media and American hunters of Nazi colloborators, who accused him of having worked for the Third Reich. In reply, he published an extensive dossier of his World War II activities. During the 2012 reburial ceremony of the Juozas Ambrazevičius remains in Kaunas, adviser to Lithuanian Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius also noted that a 1975 investigation by US Immigration found no evidence of Ambrazevičius/Brazaitis being involved in anti-Semitic or pro- Nazi activities. However, according to a subsequent clarification issued in 2019 by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the US Congress, the investigation was not conclusive and did not amount to a \\"rehabilitation\\" of Ambrazevičius/Brazaitis. The investigation into his wartime activities was discontinued after Ambrazevičius/Brazaitis passed away in 1974.\\"JAV Kongreso laiškas premjerui: neigia išteisinę J.Ambrazevičių-Brazaitį\\". 15min.lt. 15 October 2019.

Clinker bricks are produced when wet clay bricks are exposed to excessive heat during the firing process, sintering the surface of the brick and forming a shiny, dark-colored coating. Clinker bricks have a blackened appearance, and they are often misshapen or split. Clinkers are so named for the metallic sound they make when struck together.Susan VanHecke. \\"The Accidental Charm of Clinker Bricks\\", Old House Journal Clinker bricks are denser, heavier, and more irregular than standard bricks. Clinkers are water- resistant and durable, but have higher thermal conductivity than more porous red bricks, lending less insulation to climate-controlled structures. The brick-firing kilns of the early 20th century—called brick clamps or \\"beehive\\" kilns—did not heat evenly, and the bricks that were too close to the fire emerged harder, darker, and with more vibrant colors, according to the minerals present in the clay. Initially, these clinkers were discarded as defective, but around 1900, the bricks were salvaged by architects who found them to be usable, distinctive, and charming. Clinker bricks were widely admired by adherents of the Arts and Crafts movement. In the United States, clinker bricks were popularized by the Pasadena, California architecture firm Greene and Greene, who used them for walls, foundations, and chimneys. On the East Coast, clinkers were used extensively in the Colonial Revival style of architecture. Modern brick-making techniques do not produce clinker bricks, and they have become rare. Builders can procure clinkers from salvage companies; alternatively, some brickmakers purposefully manufacture clinker bricks or produce imitations. Dutch origin Clinker bricks used to form family initials on the Jan Van Hoesen House, a 1700s Dutch house in upstate New York. Clinker brick closeup of bricks in the so-called Clinker building on Barrow street in Greenwich Village, New York City. Clinker is sometimes spelled \\"klinker\\" which is the contemporary Dutch word for the brick. Both terms are onomatopoeic, derived from the Middle Dutch klinkaerd, later klinker, from klinken (“to ring, resound”). Clinker bricks are also known as Dutch paving bricks. In 18th century New York, the Dutch interspersed dark clinkers with regular bricks. Some used clinkers to spell out their family initials on brick dwellings such as the Jan Van Hoesen House. Technical information Clinkers consist of bits and ends, field-late and white-burning or red-burning clays. Through different mixtures of the raw ingredients, many varied colour nuances can be achieved. For the production of masonry units the source materials—clay and water—are mixed and formed industrially in a string extrusion process. For special purposes, for example the restoration of listed buildings, hand-formed clinkers are used. During the drying process, the water concentration decreases to approximately 3%. Then clinkers are fired at temperatures between in a tunnel kiln (earlier in ring kilns), in contrast to the temperature range seen with normal bricks. Clinkers in Germany Historical floor at the Jagdmagazin, Jagdschloss Grunewald, Germany In Germany, clinker bricks (German: Klinkerziegel) are named according to the German Institute for Standardization's DIN 105. They differ between full clinker (KMz) with a density of and high hole clinker (KHLz) with a density of . Because of their low porosity, clinker bricks are inferior thermal insulators, compared to normal bricks. Canal clinkers are named according to the German Institute for Standardization’s DIN 4051. Clinkers are frost resisting and, thus are suited particularly for facades. The formats of the clinker stones are named according to the German Institute for Standardization’s DIN 1053. Base for the different formats is the normal format (NF) with length , width and height . For facade layouts architects also order clinkers produced in special dimensions. For use in facades, it is possible to cope varied shaped elements (e.g., clinker expressionism, see picture). Earlier clinkers were often used in civil engineering works, for example in bridge building, the construction of sewers and hydraulic structures, for mortar floodgates and hoppers or as paving stones for road construction. The German sculptor Ernst Barlach worked with clinkers, which were produced according to his specifications, for example by the brickyard of Ilse Bergbau AG. Peat-fired clinker Clinker bricks take on a special colouring, often greenish tones, if burnt with peat. The Chilehaus and the Ramada Hotel in Hamburg are famous buildings built with peat-fired clinker. The last ring stove for peat-fired clinker still operating is in Nenndorf near Aurich (East Frisia), producing bricks marketed under the name “Wittmunder Torfbrandklinker” (peat-fired clinker of Wittmund). Greppin clinker Greppiner Klinker (clinker of Greppin) is a hard-burnt yellow clinker brick. Greppin clinkers were mainly used for facing railway structures at the end of the 19th and in the early 20th centuries.

It encompasses the most urbanised and easternmost part of the province of Overijssel. Twente is most likely named after the Tuihanti or Tvihanti,Green, D.H. Language and History in the Early Germanic World. Cambridge University Press. 2000. 250. Accessed: 24-11-2011 a Germanic tribe that settled in the area and was mentioned by the Roman historian Tacitus. The region's borders are defined by the Overijssel region of Salland in the northwest and west (the river Regge roughly defines the western border), the German County of Bentheim in the northeast and east (the river Dinkel roughly defines the eastern border) and the Gelderland region of the Achterhoek in the south. Twente has approximately 620,000 inhabitants, most of whom live in its three largest cities: Almelo, Hengelo and Enschede, the latter being the main city of the region. It comprises fourteen municipalities: Almelo, Borne, Dinkelland, Enschede, Haaksbergen, Hellendoorn, Hengelo, Hof van Twente, Losser, Oldenzaal, Rijssen-Holten, Tubbergen, Twenterand and Wierden. The whole of Hellendoorn and the western parts of both Rijssen-Holten and Twenterand historically belong to the cultural region of Salland, but to the city region of Twente. Etymology Various sources provide several explanations of the name Twente. In his work Germania, the Roman historian Tacitus mentions a tribe called Tvihanti, who lived near or in present-day Twente. This same name was found on two altar stones found in the ruins of Vercovicium, a Roman guard post on Hadrian's Wall near present-day Housesteads in Northern England. The Tvihanti served in a Roman-Frisian cavalry unit that was stationed there. Another explanation of the origins of the name, is that Twente was part of the Oversticht, a Medieval administrative construction which included the adjacent shires of Twente and Drenthe. As the name Drenthe is said to stem from *thrija-hantja meaning \\"three lands\\", Twente is said to stem from *twai-hantja or \\"two lands\\".http://bouwstoffen.kantl.be/tw/facsimile/?find=twente Landscape Municipalities of the city region of Twente Tower for salt- mining, near Twekkelo Oostendorpermolen, near Haaksbergen Although Twente is the most urbanized part of the province of Overijssel, it is renowned for its scenic countryside. This is sometimes characterized as a bocage landscape, attracting many tourists from other parts of the country, with popular sights such as the Lutterzand on the meandering Dinkel, or the wide heather fields on the Frezenbaarg near Markelo. Twente is bisected from north to south by a range of hills in western Twente (Holterberg, Rijsserberg, Friezenberg, Nijverdalse Berg, Hellendoornse Berg), and hills in the east, with the Tankenberg near Oldenzaal being the highest point. The towns of Ootmarsum, and Oldenzaal to a lesser extent, are known for their scenic historical buildings, the latter of which has a noteworthy Romanesque church called Oale Grieze (the ‘Old Grey’), which is the oldest Romanesque church in the Netherlands. Eight Twents towns have obtained city rights: Almelo, Delden, Diepenheim, Enschede, Goor, Oldenzaal, Ootmarsum, and Rijssen. Since Twente's economy is to a great extent reliant on agriculture, this leaves its marks on the landscape, with many meadows and pastures, alternating with undergrowth, scrubs and copse. There are several fens, marshes and peat bogs, which long made Twente less accessible for the rest of the Netherlands, and which formed some natural defence. It also made the inhabitants of Twente incline towards the east (Westphalia and Münster, more precisely) in trade, politics and fashion, rather than to the more western parts of the Netherlands. Geologically, Twente is one of the most interesting areas of the Netherlands. It has strata (earth layers) from various eras concentrated in a relatively small area. There is an open stone quarry at Losser, while there are several salt mines at Hengelo and Boekelo. The western Twente town of Nijverdal is the only place in the Netherlands where gold was ever found. Economy Twente is largely reliant on agriculture, next to services, and to a lesser degree on tourism. The improved national image of Twente has stimulated an increase in sales of regional products. One of the largest Dutch beer breweries, the Grolsch Brewery, is in Twente. Twente has many construction companies, most notably in the town of Rijssen, which houses over twenty companies in construction and related services, such as electricity, plumbing, and insulation. Some north- western Twents villages, such as Westerhaar-Vriezenveensewijk, are known for their many inhabitants employed in road engineering. Some construction companies have set up or invested in offices overseas, such as in the US and Asia. Twente also has many machine manufacturing companies, like machinery for agriculture, oil piping, food manufacturing, assembly automation, etc. Many of them with a global customer base. Next to aforementioned occupations, many Twents people are engaged in the transport sector. The second half of the twentieth century saw an explosive increase in the number of freight transportation companies. Culture and folklore Twents gewelteekn The flag of Twente is a bright red cloth with a white rampant horse, which is believed to be derived from the Saxon Steed, the rampant horse in the coats of arms of Westphalia and Lower Saxony, also introduced in the (modern) coat of arms of the English county of Kent. Traditions In the more rural parts of Twente, a notion called noaberskop, which may be roughly translated as neighbourship, is deemed of great importance. In short, noaberskop involves neighbours looking after each other or giving good counsel whenever a neighbour asks for advice. For instance, it may include collecting each other's mail and watering plants and flowers while the other family is on holiday and looking after each other's pets. Noaberskop is regarded a matter of rights and obligations. A neighbour may for instance call on another neighbour for help if something needs to be repaired or otherwise taken care of, but it is very indecent to refuse if the other neighbour then asks for a favour in return. Neighbours are expected to help each other preparing wedding celebrations, funerals, birthday parties, etc. Though modern social security service has reduced the need for strong noaberskop bonds, some communities do appreciate newcomers adapting to these old customs and \\"making neighbourship\\" with the others, and not fulfilling noaberskop duties may be still regarded a grave offence. A number of traditional cultural practices have been preserved in Twente, such as blowing mid-winter horns around Christmas and burning Easter fires. Twente is also known for its considerable number of so-called klootsketersverennigings (road bowling associations), which is commonly considered the \\"local traditional sport\\". In the small town of Ootmarsum, a tradition known as vlöggeln is practised annually around Easter. Firstly, a group of eight young bachelors called Poaskearls (Easter Men) are selected. On Easter morning, the Poaskearls form a human chain by joining hands. They go through some of the houses of the town while singing psalms, after which the other inhabitants and other spectators may join the chain. After a while, the chain halts in the town centre, where fathers may lift their young children three times, while shouting \\"Halleluja\\". The gathering continues towards the fields, where a large Easter Fire has been built by the community. The gathering sings a psalm and then the Poaskearls light the bonfire. It is commonly believed to be a Roman Catholic adaptation of a pre-Christian fertility tradition. An extravagant carnival is celebrated in Oldenzaal, which, like the most of eastern Twente has a considerable group of Roman Catholics. The west of Twente is mainly Protestant. Today, Twente has one of the Netherlands’ largest exile communities of Assyrians. Food Although Twente has always been part of larger cultural areas, borrowing and adopting food traditions, there are a number of traditional \\"typically Twents\\" dishes and snacks. One of the nationally most-renowned foods from Twente is the kreantewegge. This is a type of currant bread, that is traditionally baked to celebrate the birth of children. The kreantewegge was usually a long loaf, sometimes extending over as much as one meter, cut into thick slices. It is currently still a popular accompaniment with a cup of coffee, though it is no longer exclusively linked to child birth. Another typically Twents food is bakleaverworst (roughly translated as baked liver sausage), mostly abbreviated to bakworst. This is a spicy pork sausage, usually approximately 15 cm in diameter. The sausage is cut into 1 cm slices and baked. It is not usually served for dinner, but is often eaten for lunch, on a sandwich. It is mainly a seasonal product; as it is a hot and hearty snack, it is only available during the winters. There are several dishes that are often termed \\"typically Twents\\", although they are not much served today. Examples include stip in de pan and balkenbriej. Perhaps the best internationally known beverage from Twente is Grolsch lager. Though it is originally from the town of Groenlo which is in the adjacent Achterhoek region, the brewery moved to Boekelo near Enschede. It is therefore currently often considered a Twents brand. A relatively new brand of lager, Twents Bier, is brewed in the town of Beckum. Twente also has a longstanding tradition of distilling bitters. There are many locally distilled bitters, which are often produced and consumed for special occasions and celebrations. Often, they aren't for sale outside the home village. Though Twents families traditionally ate potatoes, vegetables and meat for dinner, the influx of many immigrants from all over the world to Twente, who brought with them their own food traditions, has broadened the average Twenteman's nutritional horizon. Architecture Office of Aan de Stegge, a construction company in the town of Goor Twente is mainly a rural area with a number of urban centres. The Saxon heritage of Twente is reflected in the design of more traditional farms and residential houses. Twente has the only remaining lös hoes in the Netherlands (literally ‘loose house’), a type of construction design that was previously common throughout the east of the Netherlands and the north of Germany. A lös hoes consisted mostly of one room in which both humans and livestock lived together. The roofs, which are relatively large in comparison to contemporary houses, making up approximately 2/3 of the entire height, were mostly thatched and supported by a frame of thick beams. The TwentseWelle museum in Enschede has reconstructed a lös hoes on their premises. Many contemporary houses are designed with Twents Saxon elements, such as thatched roofs, wooden planks to decorate the gables, and gewelteekns (gable signs), which are wooden planks shaped with several stylised symbols, such as a tree of life, cross, anchor and heart, a sun wheel, and two rampant horses. These gewelteekns are mounted vertically onto the ridge of the house at the front and the back gable. The symbols are believed to either invoke prosperity or ward off misfortune. Many construction companies have their origins, or main office, in Twente. Especially in the town of Rijssen, which houses over twenty more or lesser known construction companies next to companies that provide related services, such as plumbing, building insulation and electricity. This makes Twente an attractive place for architects. A well-known piece of architecture is found in the town of Goor, where a construction engineering company has built their main office in the style of Friedensreich Hundertwasser, who was known for using lively colours and natural forms. Languages The local language variety is Twents. It is a dialect of the Westphalian branch of the Low German language group, which, together with Limburgs, is one of the two officially recognised regional languages of the Netherlands. Twents is spoken in all parts of Twente, but may vary from village to village in pronunciation or lexicon, though such varieties are mutually intelligible and form part of the Low German dialect continuum. Dialects are often divided into two main categories, namely East- Twents and Twents-Groafskops, though the differences are largely insignificant. The dialects work as a certain shibboleth; minor accent differences help speakers define others' place of origin. As a result, speakers do not usually refer to their dialect by the umbrella term Twents, but rather by the name of their local variety. Speakers from Markelo, for instance, may call their dialect Maarkels, whereas speakers from Overdinkel may state that they speak Oaverdeenkels. Although the dialect has been stigmatised for a considerable period over the last century, leading to a decline in use, interests in preserving and promoting the use of it are currently rising, resulting in initiatives such as dialect festivals, writing competitions and other culturally engaging projects. The municipality council of Rijssen-Holten holds one conference per year in dialect, and in 2008 declared their desk workers officially bilingual, to lower the threshold for the inhabitants of Rijssen who feel more comfortable in speaking Twents, rather than Dutch. Other municipality councils have recently indicated that they are willing to try dialect conferences, such as the municipalities of Hellendoorn and Wierden. The former Van Deinse Instituut, which is now incorporated in the TwentseWelle museum, is involved in researching the past and present of Twente. It is located in Enschede and studies the regional culture, folklore, language, cultural history and landscape of Twente. It also collects, maintains, studies and displays an extensive collection of material from the history of Twente, with a full-size historic Twents lös hoes (‘open house’, a farmhouse without separate rooms, where both livestock and humans lived together) as one of its main attractions. The museum has designated a specific part of its premises for the Twentse Taalkamer (‘language room’), where visitors may become (further) acquainted with the language. Twents is largely mutually intelligible with dialects from surrounding areas, such as Achterhooks to the south, Sallaands in the west, Groafschupper Platt and Münsterlandic across the Dutch-German border. Sports A group of friends playing klootskeetn On a professional level, Twente houses two football clubs that play in the national Eredivisie league: Heracles Almelo and FC Twente from Enschede, the latter of which is one of the most successful sides of recent years, having won the Eredivisie title in 2010 and the KNVB Cup in 2011. Twente is also the home region of Olympic Gold swimmers such as Marleen Veldhuis and Hinkelien Schreuder, and of internationally renowned equestrians (horse driving and horse jumping), such as Jeroen Dubbeldam, Gerco Schröder and Jos Lansink. A number of well-known bicycle racing pros are from Twente, including Bram Tankink, Tom Stamsnijder and Joost Posthuma. On an amateur level, many people participate for leisure in popular team sports with local clubs, such as handball, tennis, soccer and volleyball. A local traditional sport, klootskeetn, which is similar to Irish road bowling, has seen an increase in interest over the last decades. It is mainly played for leisure or for cultural engagement. There are, however, a number of (semi)-professional klootsketer clubs. It is a popular activity for staff trips.

The building, which was designed by architect Alvar Aalto, was completed in 1971. Every detail in the building is designed by Aalto. The designs were completed in 1962, with building taking place between 1967–1971. The Congress Wing was designed in 1970 and built in 1973–1975. In 2011, the building was expanded with new exhibition and meeting facilities. Finlandia Hall is known as the venue for the OSCE Summit (Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe) held in August 1975, attended by 35 world leaders, including the leader of the Soviet Union, Leonid Brezhnev, and the President of the United States, Gerald Ford.Pekka Suhonen, Petri Mustonen, Eeva-Kaarina Holopainen, Finlandia-talo: tapahtumia, ihmisiä, musiikkia [Finlandia Hall: Events, People, Music]. Otava, Helsinki, 2001. The inauguration of the Finlandia Hall was celebrated on 2 December 1971. The inauguration concert included the first performance of Einojuhani Rautavaara's Meren tytär (‘Daughter of the Sea’) and Aulis Sallinen's Symphony (opus 24), as well as Sibelius's violin concerto with Isaac Stern as the violin soloist of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra. Architecture East façade The Finlandia Hall and its Congress wing was the only part of a plan for a grand new monumental centre for Helsinki around the Töölö Bay area, designed by Alvar Aalto in 1959-1976, to actually be built.Göran Schildt, Alvar Aalto - A Life's Work. Otava, Helsinki, 1994, pp.33-34. The main feature of the Finlandia Hall building is a tower-like section with a sloping roof. Alvar Aalto's idea behind the design was that a high empty space would provide better acoustics. A lattice ceiling hides the space to the audience but it allows the creation of the same deep post-echo as tall church towers. Aalto used Italian Carrara marble in both indoor and outdoor surfaces as a contrast to black granite. For Aalto, the marble was a tie to the Mediterranean culture, which he wanted to bring to Finland. Finlandia Hall features an optical illusion: the National Museum building on the other side of the street seems to rise from the edge of the Finlandia Hall tower. The effect is created by a black trapezium on the white marble surface of the Finlandia Hall tower. The trapezium has been measured to fit the rising tower of the National Museum when the Finlandia Hall is viewed from the eastern shore of the Töölönlahti Bay. Aalto liked to create optical illusions. Another example of this can be found on the pedestrian path behind the library building of the Helsinki University of Technology (current Aalto University) in Espoo. The interior design of the building is a tribute to the principle of the Gesamtkunstwerk, that is, the total work of art. The design of each lamp, piece of furniture, panel, flooring material and decorative board is a reflection of Aalto's maturity resulting from his long career as an architect as well as designer of lamps, furniture and fixtures such as door handles. All the materials speak the language of nature, without technically artificial tones. This is because Aalto's basic view was that architecture should create a frame for human beings. In the Finlandia Hall, the focus is not on extraordinary forms or ostentatious interior, but rather on the audience and on the performers. According to Aalto, the audience at the Finlandia Hall need not dress up like people used to in the opera house foyers and gilded concert halls of the old days. What people wear should be as genuine and natural as the environment in the building. West façade Main building The main building houses the Main Auditorium (seats 1700), Helsinki Hall (seats 340), Terrace Hall (seats 250), Elissa Hall (seats 130), Aurora Hall (seats 894), Veranda (seats 1700) and Finlandia Restaurant, as well as Cafe Veranda (open to the public) and Galleria Veranda. Main Auditorium The Main Auditorium The interior of the Finlandia Hall displays many themes that are typical of Aalto. The Main Auditorium was originally designed as a concert hall, and it is a simplified version of the concert hall in the Aalto Theatre, i.e. the Essen Opera House in Germany. The Main Auditorium has been a popular venue for meetings, congresses, festivities, concerts and events from the very beginning. The Auditorium seats 1700 people, 1200 in the stalls and 500 in the balcony. The floor is oak parquet and the blue sections of the wall are Finnish birch. The stage is 14 metres wide. It consists of several modular platforms. In the middle, there is an elevator to the storage rooms located on two floors underneath the stage. The curtain is designed by Dora Jung, a Finnish textile designer. The Main Auditorium has served as a venue for several international summit meetings, for instance for the meeting of the Second Stage of Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in 1975, which was attended by General Secretary Brezhnev from the Soviet Union and President Ford from the United States. In the meeting, every second seat row was removed to accommodate desks for the participants. Several other heads of states have also given speeches in the Main Auditorium, e.g. President Ronald Reagan, President George H.W. Bush, General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachov, Pope John Paul II and the 14th Dalai Lama. There has been a lot of discussion about the acoustics of the Main Auditorium. In the beginning, there were problems, mainly because Aalto wanted the space to be like a medieval church in which the acoustics are known to be good. The tower section shown here was fully open. In the reparations that took place later, the ceiling was lowered to its present height, and the height of the stage was increased by half a metre. The doors of the Main Auditorium are covered with material made of horsehair. The organ in the Auditorium, made by the Kangasala Organ Factory, was the first concert hall organ in Finland. The front section of the organ was also designed by Alvar Aalto. Piazza Piazza is a large foyer that has much natural light. The name goes back to Italy, the country that Aalto admired greatly, its market places and squares where people gathered to see each other. The colours are subdued and quiet. The floor or the foyer is covered with high-quality English wool carpeting. The Piazza Helsinki hall The Helsinki Hall with its 340 seats and pleasant foyer is an excellent venue for various events. The Helsinki Hall has features that resemble the church hall that Aalto designed for Detmerode, Wolfsburg, Germany. Especially the roof is copied from it. The “panels” in the ceiling are American Oregon pine. A closer look at the walls of the Helsinki Hall shows that there is only one sharp angle in the Hall. Finlandia Restaurant The Finlandia Restaurant consists of three dining rooms separated by movable walls. As a single space, the restaurant seats 380 people and accommodates a cocktail party for 650 people. Combining the restaurant and the adjoining foyer allows the arrangement of catering for almost 1300 people and cocktail parties for up to 2500 people. Congress Wing The Congress Wing was completed in 1975. The special feature of the Congress Wing is the “waves” of the facade that give the building unique beauty and vivacity. The outer walls of the Wing are not direct. They curve, following the form of the terrain. On the one hand, Aalto wanted to save most of the trees on the site, but on the other hand, he wanted to avoid the monotony of direct walls. The Congress Wing contains convertible halls A, B and C, as well as several (total 13) smaller meeting rooms. Veranda The Veranda extension of the Finlandia Hall, which was completed in 2011, is a conversion of the covered parking lot and ramp on the Karamzininranta side of the main building. The main idea of the design was a feeling of a covered outdoor space, simple. light and neutral. For example, the original nature and material of the ceiling, wall and floor surfaces were not changed if possible. The construction work was implemented in cooperation with the Finnish National Board of Antiquities. The number of new fixed elements was minimised to allow the use of the space for a large number of different functions, exhibitions, banquets, etc. The hall can be divided into spaces of various sizes by means of movable walls. Veranda's floor area, 2200 m2, provides meeting space for 240–310 people. It allows the arrangement of catering for 1000 people and cocktail parties for 1700 people. The main architect for Veranda is Jyrki Iso- Aho and the interior design is by Jaakko Puro Oy. Apart from design, the leading idea in furnishing is lightness, movability and suitability for various purposes. Veranda also houses Cafe Veranda, which is open to the public, and Galleria Veranda. Both Veranda and Cafe Veranda offer a good view to the Töölönlahti Bay. Veranda Company The Finlandia Hall is operated by an independent company. On 1 June 2008, the management organisation of the Finlandia Hall was changed into a limited liability company, Finlandia-talo Oy. The whole share capital of the company is owned by the City of Helsinki. The Managing Director of the company is Johanna Tolonen.

Enric Marco (born 1921 in Barcelona) is an impostor who claimed to have been a prisoner in Nazi German concentration camps Mauthausen and Flossenbürg in World War II. He was awarded the Creu de Sant Jordi by the Catalan government in 2001 and wrote a book on his experiences. In 2005 he admitted his claims were false and returned his medal, after his deception was revealed by university researcher Benito Bermejo. Marco told Catalan TV: \\"I wasn't in a concentration camp. I was held in captivity and the Nazis did impose penalties on me. But that does not exonerate me from being an impostor.\\" He said he was released after being mistreated for several weeks and returned to Spain in 1943. Marco claimed he had volunteered in 1941 to work in Kiel for the Nazi war industry. In his made-up story called Memoir of Hell Marco wrote he had been involved in the French resistance and captured by the Gestapo in southern France. After 2001 Marco represented an association of survivors of the thousands of Spaniards who had truly been deported to Nazi concentration camps.

The Papal apartments is the non-official designation for the collection of apartments, which are private, state, and religious, that wrap around a courtyard (the Courtyard of Sixtus V, Cortile di Sisto V) on two sides of the third (top) floor of the Apostolic Palace in Vatican City. Since the 17th century the Papal Apartments have been the official residence of the Pope in his religious capacity (as Supreme Pontiff). Prior to 1870, the Pope's official residence in his temporal capacity (as sovereign of the Papal States) was the Quirinal Palace, which is now the official residence of the President of the Italian Republic. The Papal Apartments are referred to in Italian by several terms, including appartamento nobile and appartamento pontificio. Facilities The apartments include about ten large rooms including a vestibule, a small studio office for the papal secretary, the pope's private study, the pope's bedroom in the corner of the building, a medical suite (which includes dental equipment and equipment for emergency surgery), a dining room, a small living room, and the kitchen. There is a roof garden and staff quarters for the nuns (German Benedictines) who run the Prefecture of the Pontifical Household (Papal Household). It is from the window of his small study that the pope greets and blesses pilgrims to Saint Peter's Square on Sundays. The private library has been described as a \\"vast room with two windows overlooking Saint Peter's Square.\\" The pope's private chapel occupies the top storey on the east side of the Cortile di Sisto V. Residency The pope usually lives at the Papal Apartments except for the months of July to September, when the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo is the official summer residence. Three of the last five popes, John XXIII, John Paul I, and John Paul II, died in the Papal Apartments; the fourth, Paul VI, died at Castel Gandolfo, whilst the fifth, Benedict XVI resigned and lived at Castel Gandolfo before moving into his new residence within the Vatican. However, Pope Francis, after his election, declined to stay in the Papal Apartments in favor of his two-room residence in the Domus Sanctae Marthae. Similarly, he stayed in an apartment instead of the Bishop's Palace during his tenure as Archbishop of Buenos Aires. Renovations The Papal Apartments are customarily renovated according to each new pope's preferences. Prior to the renovation in 2005, following the death of Pope John Paul II and the election of Pope Benedict XVI, the Papal Apartments had reportedly been in disrepair, with \\"outmoded furnishings and lack of lighting\\" and large drums placed in the false ceiling to catch water leaks. The 2005 renovation, carried out over three months while Benedict was in summer residence at Castel Gandolfo, included the building of a new library to accommodate Benedict's 20,000 books (placed in exactly the same order as in his previous residence), upgrading the electrical wiring (125-volt electrical outlets, phased out in Italy years prior, were replaced with 220-volt outlets) and plumbing (new pipes were installed to replace those \\"encrusted with rust and lime\\"). The heating system was repaired and the kitchen was refurbished, reportedly with new ovens, ranges, and other appliances donated by a German company. The floors, which are 16th-century marble slabs and inlay, were restored. The medical studio (\\"hastily installed in the papal lodgings for the ailing John Paul II\\") was renovated and expanded to include dental facilities, and the papal bedroom was completely redone. Wallpaper and other furnishings were put in throughout. The project was carried out by over 200 architects, engineers, and workers. Benedict also moved personal possessions to the Papal Apartments, including an upright piano. Transfer On October 21, 2016, the Vatican announced that the Palace of Castel Gandolfo would now open to the general public as part of a museum. The palace was the final part of the Papal Apartments to open to the public over a two-year period.

It is considered the first Christian Chinese school established in Luzon. The school offers courses of study from Pre-Kinder to Grade 12. History Originally known as St. Stephen's Girls' School, it was founded on July 22, 1917 by St. Stephen's Mission composed of the rector and the Chinese members of the church. Intended for girls, it was known as Seng Kong Hoe in the Chinese community and had 19 enrollees. The first class was held at a church property along Reina Regente Street. In 1921, the school adopted the lavender and white colors its uniform. By 1925, the Elementary Department was established. Through the efforts of Bishop Mosher, Rev. Hobart Studley and S.C. Choy, a property in Calle Magdalena (now Masangkay Street) was bought in 1928. In 1939, the school moved to Calle Magdalena from its original location. A mission home and a 15-room building were constructed, with a renovated row of dormitory units. In 1941, the school put up a benefit program at the Rizal Stadium to raise more funds to help cover the cost of new construction. A new building on the La Torre side was completed in December 1941 which housed a library, dormitory and new classrooms. But on December 8, 1941, the school operations had to stop during the Japanese occupation in the Philippines. The Japanese military sealed off the school compound and the mission house was turned over to a Japanese doctor-director of St. Luke's Hospital. The occupants were forced to move out and the rooms were used for Japanese civilian patients. American and British school staff became prisoners of war and were confined at the University of Santo Tomas. The new building, which was not yet used was demolished and its new materials and equipment taken. Chinese guerrilla units later took the mission house and used it as headquarters during the liberation from Japanese occupation. The school reopened in December 1945 after the war under the direction of Huang Ong Bi Gim. St. Stephen's Girls' School offered its service to those unschooled for five years as contribution to the community and nation-building. Nancy L. Yao became the principal in 1946 and Constance Bolderston was the directress. Rebuilding followed and it was officially renamed St. Stephen's High School. In 1963, a new five-storey high school building was completed. By 1969, an additional building with three storeys was built for elementary students. The old Mosher Hall building on the high school campus was demolished in 1980. A five-storey annex building replaced it and was completed in 1982. Old elementary school buildings were replaced by two new buildings, which were constructed in 1991 and 1994. Accreditation St. Stephen's is recognized by the Philippine Government as a Chinese Filipino school offering English, Filipino and Chinese subjects in the Preschool, Elementary and High School Departments. It is an accredited school of Association of Christian Schools, Colleges and Universities (ACSCU-AAI). Student life Aside from the classrooms, the school has modern facilities like the Auditorium, Stephenian Hall (a multi-purpose hall), Nancy L. Yao Library, Electronic Research Center, Speech Laboratory, Wai Ling Tan Audio-Visual Center, Guidance and Counseling Center, Science Laboratories, Journalism Room, Typing Room, Home Economics Room, Clinic, Scout Center, four Computer Laboratories, Music Room, Practical Arts Room, the CSG Gymnasium, Indoor and Outdoor Playground, and the Jimmy Go Swimming Pool. The school has varsity teams in swimming, track and field, volleyball, table tennis and basketball. It hosted the 37th Season of the Women's National Collegiate Athletic Association (WNCAA) with the theme \\"Victory Beyond Competition.\\" St. Stephen's is a venue for inter-school activities and competitions. The Stephenian Math Society hosts the Lord of the Math Inter-school Competition annually at the Stephenian Hall which began in 2005. The school has served as host for training sessions held by the Mathematics Trainers' Guild (MTG) for several years. The school celebrated its historic 90th founding anniversary on July 22, 2007 with the theme \\"God's Glory with Exceeding Joy!\\" In celebration, St. Stephen's held its first Inter- school Extemporaneous Speech Competition, its first Earth Science Quiz, and three concerts: one in cooperation with the Biblical Seminary of the Philippines titled \\"An Evening of Praise,\\" featuring the Heavenly Melody Singers from Taiwan; a Thanksgiving concert titled \\"Images of Christ\\" in November 2007, directed by New York-based conductor Celia Yu Ong and famed director Chinggoy Alonso; and the Thanksgiving marimba concert, featuring alumnus Johnny Yu, Prof. Raul Sunico of the UST Conservatory of Music.

Born in Tanfield Lea, County Durham, he served in the Royal Navy aboard during the Second World War. A former Durham and Keresley miner, storeman and transport union convener, in 1986 he successfully fought and received compensation following a claim of unfair dismissal as a result of his union activities from Austin-Rover's Unipart works in Coventry.Evening Telegraph, Wednesday 3 June 1987 Mr Hughes served as a Coventry City councillor for the Holbrook Ward, and chair of the Coventry District Labour Party from 1977 to 1981. In his time on the Council, he was expelled three times from the ruling Labour group for defying the party whip over spending cuts, rent rises and school meal price rises.Evening Telegraph, Thursday 31 October 1985, p.1. He was MP for Coventry North East at a time when his Constituency Labour Party was the scene of particularly fraught left-right battles, even by the standards of the Labour Party in the 1980s. In 1985, the left wing won control of the CLP at the AGM. Hughes had not been particularly prominent in the period leading up to this, but he came out of political semi-retirement as an \\"elder statesman\\" figure to become CLP chair. A few weeks later the sitting MP, George Park, announced his intention to retire at the next election, if he had not done so there would probably have been an attempt to deselect him. The CLP then went into the procedure for selecting a parliamentary candidate. At the selection meeting the right wing voted for Hughes as he seemed the weakest of the left-wing candidates, mainly because he was aged 60 and so might only serve one term as an MP. Hughes was elected at the 1987 general election at the age of 62, old for a first-time MP but by no means unknown.See UK general election records#Oldest general election victors In his time as an MP he hit the headlines when, on Monday 11 January 1988, the Speaker ordered him out of the chamber, when during prayers he asked the clergyman not to bless the house in protest at the social impact of the government's policies. The focus of this protest was the case of Matthew Mulhall, a constituent of Hughes, whose condition required a life-saving operation by the end of February, 1988.The Guardian, Tuesday 12 January 198, p.1. The local hospital had repeatedly delayed the treatment that could save Matthew's life. Hughes, himself a practising Catholic, subsequently escaped punishment for his outburst by the Labour leadership.Daily Mirror, Friday 22 January 1988, p.6 Then-Labour Chief Whip, Derek Foster went on to endorse the protest by Mr Hughes as \\"utterly sincere.\\"The Guardian, Tuesday 12 January 1988, p.1. Hughes also attempted to have the law changed, preventing gas and electricity companies from cutting- off supplies of essential fuel and energy to individual homes. His Fuel and Energy Provision Bill was given its first reading on Wednesday, 27 July 1988, but progressed no further due to lack of time.The Times, Thursday 28 July 1988. In the run up to the 1992 general election his Constituency Labour Party had shifted to the right, and it deselected him in favour of Bob Ainsworth. He fought the election as Independent Labour, polling 4,008 votes (8.5% of total votes cast).

The song debuted in the movie Murder at the Vanities (1934), where it was introduced by the Danish singer and actor Carl Brisson. Duke Ellington's version of the song was recorded in 1934 and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2007. The song seems to refer to the ending of Prohibition in the United States. Mentioned discreetly in the song's introduction is that people could be \\"carefree and gay once again\\". The song was written in 1934, and the 21st Amendment, which ended Prohibition, was ratified in December of the previous year.  Renditions  Early recordings in 1934 were also by Johnny Green and Will Osborne but \\"Cocktails for Two\\" is best remembered today due to the comic, sound effects-laden version by Spike Jones and His City Slickers.https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1633224/m1/#track/4 The Slickers first recorded it in 1944 with Carl Grayson supplying the vocal. It was their biggest all-time hit, reaching number 4 on the charts, according to Joel Whitburn. Sam Coslow hated Jones' irreverent treatment. Even so, the recording's success earned him large royalties. Jonathan and Darlene Edwards (a comedy act by Paul Weston and Jo Stafford) also lampooned the song on their first LP, The Piano Artistry of Jonathan Edwards, released in 1957. Bing Crosby recorded the song in 1955 for use on his radio show and it was subsequently included in the box set The Bing Crosby CBS Radio Recordings (1954-56) issued by Mosaic Records (catalog MD7-245) in 2009.

Standard SCPs in the telecom industry today are deployed using SS7, SIGTRAN or SIP technologies. The SCP queries the service data point (SDP) which holds the actual database and directory. SCP, using the database from the SDP, identifies the geographical number to which the call is to be routed. This is the same mechanism that is used to route 800 numbers. SCP may also communicate with an intelligent peripheral (IP) to play voice messages, or prompt for information to the user, such as prepaid long distance using account codes. This is done by implementing telephone feature codes like \\"#\\", which can be used to terminate the input for a user name or password or can be used for call forwarding. These are realized using Intelligent Network Application Part (INAP) that sits above Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) on the SS7 protocol stack. The TCAP is part of the top or 7th layer of the OSI layer breakdown. SCPs are connected with either SSPs or STPs. This is dependent upon the network architecture that the network service provider wants. The most common implementation uses STPs. SCP and SDP split is becoming a common industry practice. This is known generally in the industry by split architecture. Reason is that operators want to decouple the dependency between the two functionality to facilitate upgrades and possibly rely on different vendors.

Administratively speaking, Cooke Optics is a spin-off of the company Taylor- Hobson. However, Taylor-Hobson used to be a lens manufacturer and Cooke lenses used to be its sole activity before Taylor-Hobson moved to the market of metrology instruments. Hence the foundation of Cooke Optics can be regarded as the foundation of Taylor, Taylor and Hobson (TTH) in 1886, and Cooke Optics can be regarded as the successor of the original Taylor, Taylor and Hobson business. The name Cooke originally came from the company T. Cooke & Sons of York, a manufacturer of telescopes. The optical manager of that company, H. Dennis Taylor (no relation), devised the Cooke triplet lens in the 1890s. Cooke of York was not interested in the manufacture of camera lenses, and licensed this design and others to TTH. Subsequently many of TTH's own designs, though unconnected with Cooke of York, also carried the Cooke brand. The Cooke triplet lens was also made under licence by Voigtländer and other companies. Throughout the twentieth century TTH produced a series of innovations, and supplied lenses for the (once large) UK camera industry, for photolithography in the printing industry in the USA and UK, and for cinematography. It provided a succession of technical solutions for Hollywood's evolving needs. Notable products include: * a soft-focus 'portrait' lens favoured by Clarence White and Alfred Stieglitz * the Aviar aerial survey lens, designed in World War I when German lenses and optical glass became unavailable to the RAF * the Series XV triple-convertible lens for 10×8 inch cameras, favoured by Ansel Adams and others (also see below) * the Opic and Speed Panchro large-aperture lenses, widely used by Hollywood * the inverse telephoto (retrofocus) lens, created for use with the early Technicolor process, and now the standard design for wide-angle lenses in 35 mm and other small-format cameras * high-quality zoom lenses for cinematography and television * high quality lenses for cinema projectors Bell & Howell took control of the company in 1930, but it was sold to Rank in 1946. In its later years, Taylor-Hobson's main interest was metrology, and it now operates as a subsidiary of Ametek. In 1998, Cooke Optics was a new company formed following a buy-out of the Optical division of Taylor-Hobson. Chairman Les Zellan led the buy-out. Dave Stevens was then Managing Director of the Leicester-based facility and remained so until 2008 when Robert Howard replaced him as Chief Executive Officer. The company now designs and manufactures 35 mm lenses for the film industry. In a reversion to its previous markets, it has also made limited quantities of the PS945, a redesigned Pinkham and Smith portrait lens,http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=3954844 Accessed 20 August 2012 and the Series XVa, a redesigned triple-convertible lens for 10×8 inch format. The company distributes to over 60 countries worldwide and exports 90% of its production. In 2013, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave the company an award of merit, saying it \\"helped define the look of motion pictures over the last century,\\" with innovations over the years that have included zoom lenses for movie cameras and lenses that did not require bright lights. resulting in lenses that produce what is known in the industry as the \\"Cooke look\\" — warm, natural images on the screen.

Believed to be inspired by a passage from Fyodor Dostoyevsky's 1868-69 novel The Idiot, the film follows a donkey as he is given to various owners, most of whom treat him callously. Noted for Bresson's ascetic directorial style and regarded as a work of profound emotional effect, it is frequently listed as one of the greatest films of all time. Plot In the French countryside near the Pyrenees, a baby donkey is adopted by young children - Jacques and his sisters, who live on a farm. They baptize the donkey (and christen it Balthazar) along with Marie, Jacques' childhood sweetheart, whose father is the teacher at the small school next-door. When one of Jacques' sisters dies, his family vacates the farm, and Marie's family take it over in a loose arrangement. The donkey is given away to local farmhands who work it very hard. Years pass until Balthazar is involved in an accident and runs off, finding its way back to Marie, who is now a teenager. But her father gets involved in legal wrangles over the farm and the donkey is given away to a local bakery for delivery work. Gerard, leader of a young criminal gang, is the delivery boy at the bakery, and so takes charge of the donkey, treating it cruelly. Marie, driving a 2CV one day, sees the donkey at the roadside and stops to greet it. Gerard, who'd been sleeping nearby, gets into her car. They have sex, and then she drives home. Marie later enters into an abusive relationship with him, leaving her parents. Gerard is summoned to the local police station and questioned about a murder, along with Arnold, an alcoholic who is also a suspect. Neither is arrested. Balthazar becomes ill, and Arnold takes the donkey off Gerard's hands. Balthazar recovers and Arnold uses the donkey and another to guide tourists around the Pyrenees. When the season ends, Balthazar escapes and joins a circus. But when the donkey sees Arnold in the audience it goes berserk, and Arnold retrieves it. Arnold's uncle dies and he inherits a fortune. He throws a wild party at a bar, and then is put on Balthazar's back to ride home. However, he is so drunk he falls off, hits his head on the ground and dies. The police send Balthazar to market. A local miller buys the donkey, using it for pumping water and milling. One rainy night, Marie, soaking wet, knocks on the miller's door asking for shelter - she has run away from Gerard. The miller says he'll be her friend and help her to 'escape' - but next morning sees her parents and offers them the donkey, the implication being that Marie will follow. Marie goes back to her parents. Jacques visits, wanting to marry her and also saying his father does not want the money the court ordered Marie's father to pay him. But Marie is not sure she wants to marry Jacques. She says she wants to 'have it out' with Gerard and goes to visit a barn where they used to meet. Gerard is there with his gang, and they strip her, beat her, then lock her in. Marie's father and Jacques find her and break a window to get in. They take her home, pulled in a cart by Balthazar. Later Jacques wants to see Marie, but her mother comes downstairs and says 'she's gone and will never come back'. Marie's father dies shortly after, when visited by a priest. While Marie's mother is grieving, Gerard turns up with his gang and asks if he can borrow Balthazar. Ostensibly it's for a procession, but they use the donkey to carry contraband for smuggling over the border. At night, when Gerard and accomplice are supposed to be meeting their contact, they are instead shot at and they flee. Balthazar runs off and hides in bushes. In the morning, we see Balthazar has a gunshot wound. A shepherd and flock comes. The sheep gather around Balthazar, their bells jangling, as he lays down and dies.

The story was inspired by Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Idiot and each episode in Balthazar's life represents one of the seven deadly sins. Bresson later stated that the film was \\"made up of many lines that intersect one another\\" and that Balthazar was meant to be a symbol of Christian faith. Bresson produced the film with help from the Swedish Film Institute. According to Wiazemsky's 2007 novel Jeune Fille, she and Bresson developed a close relationship during the shooting of the film, although it was not consummated. On location they stayed in adjoining rooms and Wiazemsky said that \\"at first, he would content himself by holding my arm, or stroking my cheek. But then came the disagreeable moment when he would try to kiss me ... I would push him away and he wouldn't insist, but he looked so unhappy that I always felt guilty.\\" Later Wiazemsky lost her virginity to a member of the film's crew, which she says gave her the courage to reject Bresson as a lover. Bresson was known to cast nonprofessional actors and use their inexperience to create a specific type of realism in his films. Wiazemsky states: \\"It was not his intention to teach me how to be an actress. Almost against the grain, I felt the emotion the role provoked in me, and later, in other films, I learned how to use that emotion.\\" Ghislain Cloquet was the cinematographer for Au Hasard Balthazar; it was the first of three films Cloquet shot for Bresson. Bresson's long collaboration with Léonce-Henri Burel had ended with Bresson's previous film, The Trial of Joan of Arc. As described by Daryl Chin, Bresson and Cloquet \\"would evolve a cinematic style of subtle, sun-dappled radiance; without extending the photography into extremes of chiaroscuro contrast, Cloquet would heighten the lighting so that even the greys would glisten.\\" The film's editor was Raymond Lamy, a veteran of French cinema whose first editing credit was in 1931. From 1956 through 1971, Lamy edited all of Bresson's films excepting The Trial of Joan of Arc (1962). Reception When Au Hasard Balthazar first played in New York at the 1966 Film Festival, \\"it received mostly unfavorable notices\\". Reviews in Europe, however, were glowing. The noted filmmaker and Cahiers du Cinema critic Jean-Luc Godard said, \\"Everyone who sees this film will be absolutely astonished [...] because this film is really the world in an hour and a half.\\" Godard married Anne Wiazemsky, who played Marie in the film, in 1967. Film critic Tom Milne called it \\"perhaps [Bresson's] greatest film to date, certainly his most complex.\\" The theatrical release in the United States came four years later. In 1970, Roger Greenspun of The New York Times lauded the film's final scene as \\"surely one of the most affecting passages in the history of film.\\" Andrew Sarris, one of cinema's most influential critics, wrote in his 1970 review: \\"No film I have ever seen has come so close to convulsing my entire being ... It stands by itself as one of the loftiest pinnacles of artistically realized emotional experience.\\"As cited in Sarris dated his review as being from 1966; a Village Voice reprint volume indicates a date of 1970.Sarris' entire February 19, 1970 review is reprinted in The New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael, however, wrote that although some consider the work a masterpiece, \\"others may find it painstakingly tedious and offensively holy\\". Ingmar Bergman also said of the movie, \\"this Balthazar, I didn't understand a word of it, it was so completely boring... A donkey, to me, is completely uninteresting, but a human being is always interesting.\\" The film's religious imagery, spiritual allegories and naturalistic, minimalist aesthetic style have since been widely praised by film reviewers. In 2005, James Quandt referred to it as a \\"brief, elliptical tale about the life and death of a donkey\\" that has \\"exquisite renderings of pain and abasement\\" and \\"compendiums of cruelty\\" that tell a powerful spiritual message. In 2003, J. Hoberman stated, \\"Robert Bresson's heart- breaking and magnificent Au Hasard Balthazar (1966) — the story of a donkey's life and death in rural France — is the supreme masterpiece by one of the greatest of 20th-century filmmakers.\\" Manohla Dargis views Au Hasard Balthazar as \\"one of the greatest films in history\\", writing that it \\"stirs the heart and soul as much as the mind.\\" Roger Ebert argued, \\"The genius of Bresson's approach is that he never gives us a single moment that could be described as one of Balthazar's 'reaction shots.' Other movie animals may roll their eyes or stomp their hooves, but Balthazar simply walks or waits, regarding everything with the clarity of a donkey who knows it is a beast of burden, and that its life consists of either bearing or not bearing [...] This is the cinema of empathy.\\" Ignatiy Vishnevetsky similarly commented, \\"Bresson never attempts to humanize Balthazar. [...] What Balthazar experiences of human nature is both pure and limited: the embrace of a lonely young woman, the unprovoked attack of an angry young man, and the work of the farms whose owners worry over money. He is only a donkey, and therefore something much more.\\" Ebert also credits Bresson's ascetic approach to actors for much of the work's emotional power, writing, \\"The actors portray lives without informing us how to feel about them; forced to decide for ourselves how to feel, forced to empathize, we often have stronger feelings than if the actors were feeling them for us.\\" Awards and Legacy The film premièred at the 1966 Venice Film Festival where it won the OCIC (International Catholic Organization for Cinema) Award, the San Giorgio Prize, and the New Cinema Award. The San Giorgio Prize was given from 1956 through 1967 for \\"artistic works that had been considered especially important for the progress of civilization.\\" Au Hasard Balthazar was ranked sixteenth on the 2012 critics' poll of \\"the greatest films of all time\\" conducted by the film magazine Sight & Sound. It was also 21st in the directors' poll, receiving 18 votes from filmmakers including Nuri Bilge Ceylan and Béla Tarr. It was also the first-place choice of Michael Haneke in the 2002 poll. Home media In 2008, the film was released to the Criterion Collection as a region 1 DVD with English subtitles. In 2013 a region 2 DVD was released by Artificial Eye, again with English subtitles. Inspiration Au Hasard Balthazar is the inspiration for 1977 Tamil language movie Agraharathil Kazhutai directed by one of the most prolific Indian directors John Abraham. This movie was critically acclaimed upon its release and in 2013, it was listed in IBN Live's 100 Greatest Indian movies of all time. In 1978, Agraharathil Kazhutai won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil at the 25th National Film Awards.

Pasolini's sixth film, it was the first time he worked primarily with professional actors. In this film, an upper-class Milanese family is introduced to, and then abandoned by, a divine force. Themes include the timelessness of divinity and the spiritual corruption of the bourgeoisie. Plot A mysterious figure known only as \\"The Visitor\\" appears in the lives of a typical bourgeois Italian family. His arrival is heralded at the gates of the family's Milanese estate by an arm-flapping postman. The enigmatic stranger soon engages in sexual affairs with all members of the household: the devoutly religious maid, the sensitive son, the sexually repressed mother, the timid daughter and, finally, the tormented father. The stranger gives unstintingly of himself, asking nothing in return. He stops the passionate maid from committing suicide with a gas hose and tenderly consoles her; he befriends and sleeps with the frightened son, soothing his doubts and anxiety and endowing him with confidence; he becomes emotionally intimate with the overprotected daughter, removing her childish innocence about men; he seduces the bored and dissatisfied mother, giving her sexual joy and fulfillment; he cares for and comforts the despondent and suffering father, who has fallen ill. Then one day the herald returns and announces that the stranger will soon leave the household, just as suddenly and mysteriously as he came. In the subsequent void of the stranger's absence, each family member is forced to confront what was previously concealed by the trappings of bourgeois life. The maid returns to the rural village where she was born and is seen to perform miracles; ultimately, she immolates herself by having her body buried in dirt while shedding ecstatic tears of regeneration. The mother seeks sexual encounters with young men; the son leaves the family home to become an artist; the daughter sinks into a catatonic state; and the father strips himself of all material effects, handing his factory over to its workers, removing his clothes at a railway station and wandering naked into the wilderness (actually the volcanic desert slopes of Mount Etna), where he finally screams in primal rage and despair. Cast Terence Stamp as The Visitor * Terence Stamp as The Visitor * Laura Betti as Emilia (the maid) * Silvana Mangano as Lucia (the mother) * Massimo Girotti as Paolo (the father) * Anne Wiazemsky as Odetta (the daughter) * Andrés José Cruz Soublette as Pietro (the son) * Ninetto Davoli as Angelino (the postman) Reception On its release, the religious right and the Vatican criticized the sexual content in the film. Others considered the film \\"ambiguous\\" and \\"visionary\\". The film won a special award at the Venice Film Festival from the International Catholic Film Office, only for the award to be withdrawn later when the Vatican protested. Scholars view the film differently due to the openness or ambiguity of the film. The author of A Certain Realism: Making Use of Pasolini’s Film Theory and Practice, Maurizio Viano, says that in order to understand the film there must be \\"adequate translation\\". Most scholars writing about the film do not discuss Pasolini's cinematographic techniques but Pasolini's philosophical arguments. Viano argues that Pasolini intended to be theoretical in this film because he wanted to be recognized as \\"a film theorist\\". Structure and title etymology Teorema means theorem in Italian. Its Greek root is theorema (θεώρημα), meaning simultaneously \\"spectacle\\", \\"intuition\\", and \\"theorem\\". Viano suggests that the film should be considered as \\"spectatorship\\" because each family member gazes at the guest and his loins , although this seems unlikely: the Greek word denotes the object of spectatorship, rather than the actual act of spectatorship, which would be theoresis (θεώρησις). As a term, theorem is also often considered as mathematical or formulaic. In this sense, the film also contains a programmatic structure. It begins with documentary- like images and then moves on to the opening credit with a dark volcanic desert, a home party scene, cuts of the factory in sepia tone, introduction of each family member in silence and sepia tone, and, then, the guest sitting in the back yard in colour. The middle section is divided into three: \\"seductions\\", \\"confessions\\" and \\"transformations\\".Pier Paolo Pasolini: Contemporary Perspectives by Patrick Allen Rumble, Bart Testa, p. 200 Not only is the film's structure formulaic but so is the psychological development of each character. They all go through \\"seductions\\", \\"confessions\\" and \\"transformations\\". The way each character changes their state of mind is the same. They all fall into a sexual desire for the guest. They all have sex with him. When the guest leaves, they all, except the maid, confess to him how they feel about themselves. In the final section of the film, after he leaves, they lose the identities they previously possessed. The maid goes back to her village and performs miracles while subsisting on nettles, but asks to be buried alive. The daughter falls into a catatonic state. The son maniacally paints his desire for the guest. The mother picks up young men who resemble the guest and has sex with them. The father strips naked in the middle of the train station. Scholarly interpretations A common interpretation by cinema scholars is that the film is a commentary on the bourgeois society and emergence of consumerism through the very beginning of the film. The reporter asks a worker at Paolo's factory if he thinks there will be no bourgeois in the future. In The Cinema of Economic Miracles: Visuality and Modernization in the Italian Art Film, Angelo Restivo assumes that Pasolini suggests that even documentary images, which depict facts, fail to show the truth. News can tell the audience only the surface of the events they broadcast. Merely watching the interview of the workers does not tell why factory owner Paolo, gave away the factory. That might be one of the reasons the scene is set in the beginning of the film. In his biographical work on Pasolini, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Enzo Siciliano assumes that Pasolini expresses his struggle of being homosexual in the film. On the other hand, Viano believes that Pasolini's emphasis is not on homosexuality but rather on sexuality in general, because the guest has sex with each member of the household. Sexuality is considered as passion in Viano's interpretation. Italian critic Morandini, author of a dictionary of cinema, claimed that \\"the theorem is demonstrated: the incapacity of modern -bourgeois- man to perceive, listen to, absorb and live the sacred. Only Emilia the servant, who comes from a peasant family, discovers it and, after the 'miracle' of levitation, will return to the ground with a holy smell. It's another film by Pasolini dedicated to the conjunction between Marx and Freud (and, here, Jung and Marcuse too).\\" Other versions Pasolini later expanded this film into a novel with the same name. Giorgio Battistelli composed an opera based on the film. In 2009, Dutch theatre company 'Toneelgroep Amsterdam' created and performed a play version of this movie.

According to the , it has a population of people. It is the largest municipality in terms of land area and population in the province. It is the commercial, educational, financial, political and government center of the province. Geography Catarman lies on the northern part of Samar Island, bounded to the east by Mondragon, to the west by Bobon, to the south by Lope de Vega, and to the north by the Philippine Sea. On the Pacific coast are flat lowlands with the interior characterized by outlying low hills. Mount Puyao in Barangay Liberty is the highest peak in the area. The Catarman River, a major provincial river, divides the eastern and the western parts of the town. It is fed by the Paticua, Hibulwangan, Mahangna, Tura, and Danao creeks together with lesser prominent estuaries. Barangays The Municipality of Catarman is politically subdivided into 55 barangays, 17 of them in the poblacion. Climate=History Catarman Municipal Hall Before the coming of the Spaniards, Catarman (Calatman) or (Cataruman) was a settlement by the mouth of the river of the same name in the region called Ibabao. The Spanish Conquistadores freely applied the name Ibabao to the northern part of Samar island when it established its civil government. The similarities in the vocabularies and pronunciation of the dialects of these areas traces them to a common root as a people. The town was one of the 13 villages and settlements and adopted as pueblos by the Spaniards in Samar Island and was one of the settlements in the northern parts of the island. The pueblo was named Calatman and was one of the pueblos in the Visayan islands, then collectively referred to as Islas de Pintados. Conversion to Cityhood In 2003, its application for cityhood was deterred after officials of the neighboring of towns Bobon and Mondragon opposed the planned Catarman City conglomeration, which was necessary to meet the criteria for the approval of its bid for cityhood. Another bill was filed converting the Municipality of Catarman into a component city of Northern Samar but is still pending with the Committee on Local Government in the House of Representatives since July 2010. The rise of establishments and banking institutions has swiftly came and filled the spaces of Catarman that paved the way for it to become competitive. DemographicsTransportation Catarman National Airport Terminal There is only one airline operating through the Catarman National Airport (IATA: CRM) coming from and going to Manila: PAL Express. Flights are frequently booked out well in advance and a one way ticket from Manila costs between PhP3,000 and PhP8,000 unless booked well in advance. Pedicabs, commonly known as \\"padyak\\" and tricycles are the means of transportation within the town, while multicabs, jeepneys, and vans are the means of transportation to neighboring and distant towns within the province. Several taxi and bus companies are also operating from the town going to Manila or Tacloban city and vice versa. Education Catarman is home to the University of Eastern Philippines, the first state university in the visayas and the largest university by student population and curriculum in Eastern Visayas. The University has satellite campuses in the province, one in Laoang and the other in Catubig (officially known the Pedro Rebadulla Memorial Campus), and has several extension programs offered across satellite campuses in the region.

The battle took place near the population centre of the same name in Alentejo. It was the first major battle of the 1383–1385 Crisis. Nuno Álvares Pereira had been chosen to protect the frontier in this area, amid fear that a Castilian force could enter Portugal here. He left Lisbon with 1,000 infantry, adding to the strength of his forces on his way to Atoleiros. The Castilian army consisted of some 5,000 men, mostly cavalry, which was besieging the village of Fronteira. As Pereira approached, the Castilians sent an emissary to him, attempting to persuade him to retire. He refused, and the Castilians advanced to meet him, lifting the siege. The Portuguese formed a defensive square. In the short battle that followed, the Castilian cavalry was unable to break the Portuguese formation, suffering heavy losses. The Portuguese suffered none, and the Castilians withdrew. The battle of Atoleiros represents the first effective use of “square tactics” on the battleground. This tactic, in which groups of infantry armed with both missile and hand-to-hand weapons defended themselves from all directions, was so successful that it was still in use over 500 years later during the Napoleonic Wars against mass French cavalry attacks, and during the Zulu War against huge masses of predominantly spear- armed infantry. It was especially effective when the infantry had to fight against strong cavalry.

It is 82 chapters long and about 72,000 words, although three of the chapters within the present text have been lost, and there is considerable textual confusion in other chapters. In its current form, the book deals with topics such as the five elements and their relation to politics. One of the chapters in this book presents the concept of the \\"source\\" (元), which became important to later Neo- Confucianism.  Authorships  The work cannot be considered an authentic work by Dong or even a work mostly written by him. It bears many marks of multiple authorship and is both externally contradictory with other material on Dong's thought, and inconsistent with itself. Different chapters espouse mutually contradictory cosmological schemas, and there even seem to be references to the rise of Wang Mang, which did not happen until a century after the death of Dong. The title Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals is not listed in the Book of Han, and there are no references whatsoever to any book of that name before 4th century mentioned by Ge Hong, 500 years after Dong's death. Whether the work was written by Dong himself has been called into question since the Song dynasty. For the first time the doubt is pronounced in the Chongwen Zongmu :zh:崇文總目 (1034). The skeptical position was argumented by scholars including Zhu Xi, Cheng Yanzuo, Dai Junren, Keimatsu Mitsuo, and Tanaka Masami. Scholars now reject as later additions all of the passages that discuss five elements theory, and much of the rest of the work is questionable as well. It seems safest to regard it as a collection of unrelated or loosely related chapters and shorter works, which could be subdivided into five categories. Most are more or less connected to the Gongyang Commentary and its school, written by a number of different persons at different times throughout the Han Dynasty. Indeed, it may be nothing more than the mislabeled remains of a book listed in the Book of Han, the 82-chapter Miscellaneous Records of the Gongyang School (公羊雜記). Nevertheless, the Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals should not be cast aside, especially since it seems to be a misattribution rather than an outright forgery. It remains a valuable compendium of early and mid-Han Confucian thought, if properly interpreted and contextualized, and it had an influence on later thinkers.  Content and structure  Several subdivisions have been put forward in the past in an attempt to impose some sort of order on the contents of the Luxuriant Dew of the Annals. One can divide the text into seven main sections, some of which can be further divided into subsections, based on features of both content and structure. These sections are: * The Annals group; * The \\"Huang-lao\\" or \\"Daoist\\" group; * The politico-ethical group; * The cosmological group; * The Five Forces or Five Elements group; * The sacrifices group; * The miscellaneous group. Section A, the Annals group, chapters 1-17, is characterized by a concentration on the meaning of Annals texts, or on more general principles extracted from the canon. Section B is the \\"Huang-Lao\\" or \\"Daoist\\" group. This is one of the better-recognized subdivisions in the text. It is composed of the chapter titles from 18 to 22 and the chapter texts from 19 to 22. (The text of Chapter 18, for reasons discussed elsewhere, should be repositioned in Section G2). One can underestimate the amount of Confucian thought in these essays, some of it displayed in a very subtle manner, but on the whole the spirit is Huang-lao and the canon and Confucian norms are taken lightly here. Section C concerns political and ethical theory, and once again the chapters can be subdivided into three smaller groupings: : Section C1, the first six chapters, all address the order of rank in government and society. Chapter 23, \\"The three dynasties changed regulations from simple to refined\\" is a theoretical statement of historical change, complete with prescriptions for proper ritual in each of the cosmic periods. Chapters 24, \\"Official regulations take Heaven as image\\" and 28, \\"Ranks and states,\\" discuss official hierarchies and feudal rankings, respectively. Chapter 25, \\"Yao and Shun did not abdicate on their own authority, Tang and Wu did not presume to kill,\\" clarifies the rightness of some alleged violations of the order of rank charged to the sage-kings. Finally, 26 \\"Clothing regulations\\" (lost except for its first sentence) and 27 \\"Measured regulations\\" lay down sumptuary rules. : Section C2 is made up of the six chapters 29, \\"The standard of selflessness and right,\\" 30, \\"It is necessary to be both selfless and wise,\\" 31, \\"Emphasize the right in the nourishment of the self,\\" 32, \\"Reply to the King of Jiaoxi [sic]: The great officers of Yue were incapable of selflessness,\\" 33, \\"Examining moral power,\\" and 34, \\"Reverencing the root.\\" The chapters as a whole center around ethical questions, particularly casuistry, the interplay, and possible or apparent interference, between ethical norms. Most have a political relevance, more or less distant, and there is a great deal of reference to the canon. : Section C3 contains three chapters dealing with epistemology. Chapter 35, \\"A profound examination of names and appellations\\" takes up the subject at length, including a concerted attack on Mencius for stating that the xing, \\"natural tendency,\\" is intrinsically good. Chapter 36, \\"The real meaning of 'nature',\\" is either a summary of 35 or a much briefer text from which 35 was developed. Su Yu, the late Qing dynasty editor, believes it is the former, but it is very hard to be sure one way or the other. Chapter 37, \\"Feudal lords,\\" is a very short treatment of the words that form its title, with the intent of explaining their \\"real\\" meaning. Section D, from 38, \\"Reply on the Five Forces\\" to 57, \\"Things of the same kind stimulate each other,\\" discuss the stimulus-response relationship between Heaven and man. Most chapters in the group make extensive use of Yin-Yang and Five Forces concepts, separately or in combination. There is little evident order in the sequence they are presented, and three of the chapters (39, 40, and 54) are missing. Section E, which runs from Chapter 58, \\"The mutual production of the Five Forces,\\" to 64, \\"The Five Forces and the Five Affairs,\\" also discusses stimulus-response cosmology. However, the overwhelming influence in these chapters is from Five Forces theory: the words \\"Five Forces\\" appear in each of the chapter titles, and Yin-Yang is in a very subordinate position when used at all. As Tanaka Masami and Sarah Queen have pointed out (echoing Su Yu), many close parallels to the Huang-lao Daoist work Huai nanzi can be found here. Section F, the twelve chapters from 65, \\"A discourse on the suburban sacrifice,\\" to 76, \\"The significance of sacrifices,\\" discusses sacrificial services. Most of the first half of this section is devoted to discussion of the suburban sacrifice, but the texts are in bad shape and the damage seems to be very early. Other topics covered include the four seasonal sacrifices and the starting and stopping of rain (chapters 74 and 75). There is also Chapter 73, the \\"Praise-ode to mountains and rivers,\\" which can be confidently dated to the last few decades of Former Han at the latest. Section G is a mixed bag of sometimes rather dull political texts and documents from the yangsheng \\"nourishing life\\" school. Only two of the chapters, 79, \\"The birthplace of severity and moral power,\\" and 80, \\"Like the doings of Heaven,\\" have proper titles. Chapters 77, \\"Following the Way of Heaven,\\" 78, \\"The actions of Heaven and earth,\\" 81, \\"Heaven, earth, Yin, and Yang,\\" and 82, \\"The Way of Heaven acts,\\" all lack their own titles and pass under the first few characters of their text. The \\"Chapter 18\\" text, minus its title, also belongs in this group. (The only other chapters in the book with disturbed or irregular titles are Chapter 1, \\"King Zhuang of Chu,\\" where the original title \\"Luxuriant Dew\\" (Fanlu) was appropriated as part of the book title, and Chapter 67, \\"The suburban sacrifice,\\" where the copyist omitted removing the original title from the head of the essay when the text was recopied.) The chapters in Section G fall into two groups: : Section G1 is the yangsheng \\"nourishing life\\" group. This includes chapters 77 and 78. They present techniques for living out one's full lifespan. : Section G2 is made up of the political essays from Chapters 79 to 82, plus the untitled material from Section B (Chapter 18 text), rather dull and generic material on the whole. They are far more tolerant of punishment, and establishing the right to punish, than better attributed Gongyang material usually is.

It rises south of Convict Lake near the town of Mammoth Lakes. History The mountain was named for Robert Morrison, a merchant in the town of Benton, who was killed near Convict Lake on September 23, 1871 while he was acting as member of a posse pursuing escaped convicts from the Nevada State Penitentiary. Nearby is Mono Jim Peak which is named for Mono Jim, a Paiute guide, who died in the same gun fight. Climbing Sources state that Norman Clyde climbed to the peak on June 22, 1928 and that John Mendendhall also reached the summit in 1928 but the month of his ascent is not documented. There are several routes to the summit, the easiest consisting of a Class 2 scramble and bushwack. Due to its imposing east face, Mount Morrison is also nicknamed the \\"Eiger of the Sierra.\\" The east face consists of extremely loose rock and one should exercise extreme caution when attempting the face. Geology Highly tilted and faulted metasedimentary rocks are exposed on Mount Morrison. Formations include the Ordovician Convict Lake Formation (argillite and siliceous hornfels and slate), the Lower Devonian to Silurian Aspen Meadow Formation (siliceous and calc-silicate hornfels), the Middle Devonian Mount Morrison Sandstone (calcareous quartz sandstone), and the Upper Devonian Squares Tunnel Formation (black chert and argillite).

The film surrounds the life of McDull, a hugely popular cartoon pig character created by Alice Mak and Brian Tse which has appeared on comics ever since the 1990s. In 2004, the sequel to this film, McDull, Prince de la Bun, was released. Awards The FIPRESCI prize at the 26th Hong Kong International Film Festival (2002) Grand Prix at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival, Annecy, France (2003) Plot McDull is not the brightest kid on the block, but he continually tries to do his best and please his mother. Although it seems that he may not be destined for great things in life as his mother wishes, McDull never gives up. The story focuses on several tales about McDull and his childhood. This is told as a narrative reflection of a now adult McDull. These tales muddle up in imaginative uses of Cantonese and heaps of local Hong Kong culture. From tales about a turkey dinner to dreams of following in Lee Lai-shan's footsteps, McDull faces ebbs and flows with his demanding but devoted mother. There is a significant amount of material in the movie which is culturally relevant to Hong Kong. For example, a large proportion of the humour and appeal of the movie arises from its complex wordplay and subtle hints of Hong Kong's historical legacy and dynamic. The songs featured in the film are bright and beguiling, and are not overbearing as some musical animations are likely to become. The film's animation is trouble-free and colourful changing at times as stories alter, but echoing the fashion of the innovative artwork. It uses a number of contemporary Computer Graphics animations in several scenes to illustrate an urban Hong Kong, but it skillfully shows Hong Kong as the dirty conurbation it is rather than the high-pitched clean cityscape that many travel advertisements like to portray. The genial and timid piglet McDull has cheered up the lives of kids, professors, housewives and CEOs, because he epitomises the uncontainable and happy-go-lucky spirit of Hong Kong. His no-holds-barred porcobiography is a frame-by-frame account of life growing up in the slums of Shamshuipo, set against the colourful campaign of a post-97 Hong Kong trudging along regardless of downturn woes. Pouncing shots of busy Kowloon streets, slimy cafés, plus sights and smells of local flavour fused with animation, live object shooting and 3-D computer graphics define the film.

It more broadly a civil parish in the Lewes District of East Sussex. Barcombe itself is the older of three settlements in the parish; Barcombe Cross is much more populous and the main hub with the amenities and services, where the villagers evacuated during medieval plague the Black Death; and the latter has a near outpost north of Barcombe Mills on the River Ouse. Hamlets are Spithurst in the north east and Town Littleworth in the north west. Barcombe Cross is known as Barcombe in the local area and is signposted as such, the only government-defined Built-up Area. Only on maps is it shown in its full name. History Barcombe is noted to Sussex residents and tourists for its 'Mills', a reference to an old water-mill complex on the River Ouse at the base of the hill/plateau on which Barcombe Cross sits. These were a favourite Sunday outing for townsfolk from Lewes and Brighton before the Second World War, when the mills burnt down, as well as its pub restaurants. Barcombe was recorded in the Domesday Book as \\"Berchamp\\", if a name first devised by the Normans then with a softer second syllable than k and thus a reference to field(s) of barley, if rooted in an older name then either barley or another description of hill.Compare Salcombe and Balcombe South of the village, close to the river, remains have been found of a Roman settlement, investigated by the Culver Archaeological Project. An earlier Iron Age roundhouse was found on the same site, Barcombe parish church is dedicated to St Mary, and is in the older village. Barcombe is home to The Bevern Trust a Sussex Disability Charity and its residential home Bevern View. Bonfire Barcombe Bonfire is held annually, two weeks after the Lewes celebration on which it is modelled. The society is largely family-orientated and everyone helps out with torch dipping and bonfire building. There is the Grand Firework Display as well as four processions including the dedicated Children's Procession, visiting societies and a fancy dress competition. Governance Barcombe is part of the electoral ward Barcombe and Hamsey. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 2,105, of which 741 lived in the only identified Built-up Area, Barcombe (Cross). The latter had 320 homes, none of which communal establishments.https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=1119881186  Transport  ;Road The A26 between Lewes and Uckfield runs south-east of the villages. It can be accessed from the centre of the village via Barcombe Mills Road. The A275 runs north of the villages. This links Lewes and Haywards Heath ;Rail Two railway lines ran through the villages: the line between Lewes and Uckfield opened in October 1868; and the line from East Grinstead, part of which is now the Bluebell Railway. There were stations on each of the two lines: Barcombe on the East Grinstead line, and Barcombe Mills on the Uckfield line, with a junction south of the latter before the line continued to Lewes. Barcombe closed on 28 May 1955, whilst Barcombe Mills closed on 4 May 1969. Part of the line is now a cycle track. The nearest railway station is now Cooksbridge, about 2½ miles away. ;Public Rights of Way There are many bridleways and footpaths in and around the villages, linking to Lewes, Isfield, Newick and many other places. The Sussex Ouse Valley Way runs through Barcombe Mills to the south. ;Bus A bus service is provided to the bus stop at the north of Barcombe Cross and outside the junction with the old road at Barcombe Mills. Services are provided by Compass Travel. The buses connect with the trains at Cooksbridge. There are no buses on Sundays to Barcombe Cross and no buses at all on weekends to Barcombe Mills. ;Air The nearest big airport is London Gatwick, 45 minutes' drive to the north; this offers domestic, European and international flights. Shoreham Airport is about half an hour's drive to the west. This small Art Deco airport offers flights to France and the Channel Islands. It is mainly used for private planes though. Fishing lakes There is now only one fishable lake in the parish, Cornwell's Reservoir which is controlled by Lewes Angling Club. The main Barcombe Reservoir has been closed to anglers for some years. Notable residents Bernard Holden, veteran of the Burma campaign, president of the Bluebell Railway and father of standard gauge railway preservation was born in Barcombe Station in 1908. Kim Sears (also Murray), wife of tennis star Andy Murray, was born in the village.

The music is influenced by artists such as A Tribe Called Quest, De la Soul and DJ Krush. Originally a Christian rap group, the members of the group and their beliefs have changed over time, to the point that the group today has lyrics criticising religion and superstition, embracing instead scientific wonder. Evig Poesi were some of the very first to seriously practice emceeing and freestyle sessions in Norwegian.  History and discography  Evig Poesi was founded by rappers Petter Smart (real name Jon Petter Etnestad) and Deep Thought autumn 1998, and was first called MHC. The name quickly changed into Evig Poesi. After a couple of years of rhyme-writing, beat-production, concert-playing and freestyling, the EP Åndelig Føde was released May 2001. DJ Broder T joined the group during the summer of 2001. The Summer 2003, they released their second EP, \\"Drekka Melk\\". The video they made off this release got heavy rotation on Norwegian TV-Channels such as NRK, and ZTV. Etnestad began using his new pen name Smart 9000 as a producer, and stopped calling himself Petter Smart. In January 2006 Evig Poesi released their first full- length album: \\"I Krig og Kjærlighet\\", (\\"In love and war\\"). After the release the group changed. For a while it defined itself as a loose collective of artists and musicians, all connected to the MC/producer Smart 9000. Eventually, Smart 9000 teamed up with new addition André Jensen, and Evig Poesi took the form of a duo. The group's days of preaching Christianity were over. Since then the group has released several albums: In 2011 they released the album \\"Verdens Ende\\" (\\"The World's End\\") as Evig Poesi, Conurbia and Definite. This was a collaboration with Trondheim rap duo Conurbia and Oslo based rapper Definite, released on the underground record label Bonsaiety Records. The lead track from the album was \\"Djevelen i Detaljene\\" (\\"The Devil in the Details\\"), for which Evig Poesi produced their second professional music video. In 2012 they released the album \\"Ingenting er Gratis\\" (\\"Nothing is Free\\") on their own, producing music videos for many of the tracks, and deliberately making the entire album freely downloadable (as an ironic wink at the title). Both current group members (Smart 9000 and André Jensen) have continued making music independently, usually in collaborations with other artists. They have also competed in Norwegian freestyle rap competition \\"Skeez TV\\", and made a name for themselves there.

He was a protégé of Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, but his style of painting fell out of favor with the rise of modern art. Early life Godward was born in 1861 and lived in Wilton Grove, Wimbledon. He was born to Sarah Eboral and John Godward (an investment clerk at the Law Life Assurance Society, London). He was the eldest of five children. He was named after his father John and grandfather William. He was christened at St. Mary's Church in Battersea on 17 October 1861. The overbearing attitude of his parents made him reclusive and shy later in adulthood. Career A fair reflection, by John William Godward, 1915 He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1887. When he moved to Italy with one of his models in 1912, his family broke off all contact with him and even cut his image from family pictures. Godward returned to England in 1921, died in 1922, and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, West London. One of his best- known paintings is Dolce far Niente (1904), which was purchased for the collection of Andrew Lloyd Webber in 1995. As in the case of several other paintings, Godward painted more than one version; in this case, an earlier (and less well-known) 1897 version with a further 1906 version. He committed suicide at the age of 61 and is said to have written in his suicide note that \\"the world is not big enough for [both] myself and a Picasso\\". His estranged family, who had disapproved of his becoming an artist, were ashamed of his suicide and burned his papers. Only one photograph of Godward is known to survive. Works Godward was a Victorian Neo-Classicist, and therefore, in theory, a follower of Frederic Leighton. However, he is more closely allied stylistically to Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, with whom he shared a penchant for the rendering of Classical architecture — in particular, static landscape features constructed from marble. The vast majority of Godward's extant images feature women in Classical dress posed against landscape features, although there are some semi-nude and fully nude figures included in his oeuvre, a notable example being In The Tepidarium (1913), a title shared with a controversial Alma-Tadema painting of the same subject that resides in the Lady Lever Art Gallery. The titles reflect Godward's source of inspiration: Classical civilization, most notably that of Ancient Rome (again, a subject binding Godward closely to Alma-Tadema artistically). Given that Classical scholarship was more widespread among the potential audience for his paintings during his lifetime than in the present day, meticulous research of detail was important in order to attain a standing as an artist in this genre. Alma- Tadema was an archaeologist as well as a painter, who attended historical sites and collected artifacts he later used in his paintings: Godward, too, studied such details as architecture and dress, in order to ensure that his works bore the stamp of authenticity. In addition, Godward painstakingly and meticulously rendered other important features in his paintings, animal skins (the paintings Noon Day Rest (1910) and A Cool Retreat (1910) contains examples of such rendition) and wildflowers (Nerissa (1906) and Summer Flowers (1903) are again examples of this). The appearance of beautiful women in studied poses in so many of Godward's canvases causes many newcomers to his works to categorize him mistakenly as being Pre-Raphaelite, particularly as his palette is often a vibrantly colorful one. The choice of subject matter (ancient civilization versus, for example, Arthurian legend) is more properly that of the Victorian Neo-classicist. However, it is appropriate to comment that in common with numerous painters contemporary with him, Godward was a 'High Victorian Dreamer', producing beautiful images of a world which, it must be said, was idealized and romanticized, and which in the case of both Godward and Alma-Tadema, came to be criticized as a world-view of 'Victorians in togas'. Godward \\"quickly established a reputation for his paintings of young women in a classical setting and his ability to convey with sensitivity and technical mastery the feel of contrasting textures, flesh, marble, fur and fabrics.\\" Godward's penchant for creating works of art set in the classical period probably came from the time period in which he was born. \\"The last full-scale classical revival in western painting bloomed in England in the 1860s and flowered there for the next three decades.\\" File:Godward With Violets Wreathed and Robe of Saffron Hue 1902.jpgWith Violets Wreathed and Robe of Saffron Hue, 1902 File:When the heart is young, by John William Godward.jpgWhen the heart is young, 1902 File:John William Godward -

Rall also advanced public health and prevention. He directed the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences from 1971 to 1990, year in which he retired. His work on toxicology and carcinogenesis was recognized by his appointment as the first director of the National Toxicology Program in 1978. He held the rank of Assistant Surgeon General in the United States Public Health Service. He also chaired the World Health Organization's Program on Chemical Safety. Early life and education Born in Naperville, Illinois, Rall attended North Central College and received his BS degree in 1946 where his father was president; his MS in Pharmacology from Northwestern University in 1948; his M.D. and Ph.D. in Pharmacology from Northwestern University School of Medicine in 1951. Rall interned at Bellevue Hospital in New York City from 1952 – 1953 when he joined the National Cancer Institute in 1954. He began his research career as a scientist at NCI, where he served in a variety of research and administrative positions until 1971. Rall also served as a surgeon (1955–1959), a senior surgeon (1959–1960), medical director (1963–1971), and assistant surgeon general (1971–1990) in the United States Public Health Services. He pioneered the effort to identify and understand the elements that make up the human environment and their consequences for human health. Rall was devoted in educating scientists, governments, and the world community to the critical need to address the existence of environmental agents and their consequences for human health. Academic career Rall's early work on the blood brain barrier led to modern treatment to prevent the spread of leukemia cells to the brain. Much of Rall's work focused on reducing the side effects of anticancer drugs, which are often toxic in patients when administered in large enough doses to destroy cancer cells. He also researched the effects of prolonged exposure to chemicals in the environments of people in certain occupations. In March 1971, he left the left the established world of research and clinical treatment at the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) main campus in Bethesda armed with a desire to reach beyond the treatment of chronic disease to seek its underlying causes and, through research, to learn how to prevent such diseases caused by environmental agents. Rall arrived in the newly established Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, where he set about the work of conceptualizing and then actualizing a state-of- the-art research facility among the pine forest and pastureland of the area, a prescient move that would situate the Institute at the epicenter of what would become an internationally renowned research commons. He created the NIEHS journal, Environmental Health Perspectives, in 1972. Rall developed the NIEHS Extramural Program to administer an expanding portfolio of PHS grants and awards in environmental health science to researchers at colleges and universities throughout the United States. Rall served as the U.S. coordinator of cooperative environmental health programs between the United States and the U.S.S.R., the United Kingdom, Egypt, Japan, the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Italy, Finland, and Spain. As a result of his work in attempting to strengthen international scientific cooperation, in 1975 the NIEHS was designated by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a Collaborating Center for Environmental Health Effects. In 1980, Rall played a leading role in an effort to establish the WHO's International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS), the goal of which is to provide an internationally evaluated scientific basis for the assessment of the risks to human health and the environment of chemicals. In 1978, the NIEHS was designated as the focal point for the establishment of the NTP, a cooperative effort to coordinate toxicological testing programs within the Department of Health and Human Services, and Rall was appointed its director. Also, during that NTP-formative era, Rall helped establish the 1978 Public Law that initiated the innovative Report on Carcinogens. He was the author of some 200 scientific publications and was awarded the DHEW Distinguished Service Medal of the PHS and the Arnold J. Lehman Award of the Society of Toxicology. In addition to numerous awards he received an honorary Doctorate from the University of Ohio School of Medicine. In 1988, Rall received a Merit Award from the Northwestern Alumni Association for his professional accomplishments. Recognitions Rall received many recognitions for his lifetime commitment to public service and scientific research including the PHS's Distinguished Service Medal, which he received in 1975 and again in 1990 for sustained leadership in the development of the field of environmental health science. In 1979 he was accepted as a Member of the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine (IOM), whose membership consists of the preeminent physicians of the United States. In 1988 the WHO presented Rall with the Health for All 2000 Medal. He was recognized in 1989 by the Institute of Occupational Health in Helsinki, which awarded to him its Distinguished Service Medal. Rall was also honored in 1989 by the Collegium Ramazzini, an international academic society that examines critical issues in occupational and environmental medicine with the goal of preventing disease and promoting health around the world. Also, the National Academy of Medicine created the David Rall Award, honoring him, given to a member of the Institute of Medicine who has demonstrated particularly distinguished leadership as a chair of a study committee or other such activities in a manner that was particularly exemplary, demonstrating a commitment substantially above and beyond the usual expectations of a committee chair. Retirement In 1990, Rall retired from the NIEHS but remained extremely active in the environmental health arena. He chaired the IPCS and held a variety of other positions including foreign secretary of the IOM, board member of the Environmental Defense Fund, chairman of the Scientific Advisory Council of the Hawaii Heptachlor Research and Education Foundation, and member of the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Following his retirement, he chaired the program of chemical safety for the World Health Organization, served as foreign secretary of the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences and was a board member of the Environmental Defense Fund. Rall also was a scientific counselor at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The American Public Health Association established a permanent honor in recognition of Dr. Rall’s life and work: the David P. Rall Award for Advocacy. The David P. Rall Building, the main edifice on the NIEHS’s Research Triangle Park campus, was dedicated to his memory in 2000. Rall died in Bordeaux, France as a result of injuries suffered in an automobile accident.

It is located between Castle Bromwich and Coleshill, and borders the West Midlands metropolitan county boundary to the north, west and south. At the census in 2001, the population was 3,573, falling to 3,444 at the 2011 Census. Etymology Water Orton was first documented in an Assize Roll of 1262 as Overton which means farm by the bank or edge. This usage continued to be recorded through the 13th and 14th centuries, but the name Oreton is recorded in the Warwickshire Feet of Fines in 1431. Water Ouerton is used in the Parish register of Aston in 1546 and Water Ouerton al. Water Orton in the Feet of Fines of 1605 and 1652. It is now thought that Water Orton may have been included in the Domesday Book in 1086 as 'Wavre' (Over) with Castle Bromwich. History The Chestnuts, a 15th century house in the old part of the village, may have been the old manor houseThe oldest part of the village is centred on the western end of Old Church Road and was designated a conservation area in 1983. This area overlooking the crossing of the River Tame formed the original medieval settlement of Overton and has seen the discovery of pottery remains dating back to the 12th century. It contains a number of listed buildings including The Chestnuts, a 15th-century house with late 16th or early 17th century additions that may have been the old manor house; and Wakefield House, a timber framed house with a 17th-century main block and a 16th-century cross wing. Water Orton was originally part of the parish of Aston, forming a narrow extension of the parish along the River Tame to the north of the parish of Coleshill. Until the 14th century Water Orton's inhabitants attended ordinary church services at the chapel of ease in Castle Bromwich. In 1346 they built their own chapel and were granted a license to have their own priest, although they remained subject to the mother church of Aston until 1871. The original chapel no longer remains but the graveyard in Old Church Road survives, including the stone village cross dating from 1347. The present Parish Church of St Peter and St Paul was built in 1879 for £4000 to a design by Bateman and Corser.Nikolaus Pevsner and Alexandra Wedgwood, The Buildings of England, Warwickshire, 1966, It had a fine spire, which unfortunately had to be dismantled in the 1980s due to the effects of atmospheric pollution. Water Orton BridgeWater Orton Bridge was built in 1520 by John Vesey, the wealthy Sutton Coldfield-born Bishop of Exeter. It replaced an earlier bridge that was recorded as being in a poor state in 1459 when Reginald Boulers, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, offered to issue an indulgence to anybody who would contribute to its repair. Until the 1840s Water Orton was mainly an agricultural village, but this changed with the coming of the railways. The first one was from Birmingham to Derby via Water Orton, Coleshill, Whitacre Heath and Tamworth. Later a junction was constructed and another line was built via Kingsbury to Tamworth. The lines pass through the centre of the village. The present railway station dates from 1908 and is the second station. There were extensive sidings and much commercial traffic here, especially during and after the Second World War, until the activities of Dr Beeching in the 1960s. An effect of the railway was to increase house building in the village. Commuters could now make the journey to Birmingham's Lawley Street and Curzon Street (later New Street) Railway Stations in a shorter time than by road. This made the village an ideal residential area for Birmingham professionals who wanted to get away from the city and live in the country. The railway also brought the Meat Industry here. There were large stock yards near the sidings and next to the Dog Inn in Marsh Lane. Cattle were offloaded from rail wagons into pens, then driven two miles down the road to butchers' slaughter houses in Castle Bromwich, when meat was provided for nearby villages. Features There is a grade II listed bridge,Listed Buildings in North Warwickshire, 25 April 2016 which is scheduled as an Ancient Monument, over the River Tame on the road to Minworth. It was built by Bishop John Vesey of Sutton Coldfield in 1520. Transport The village is close to the M6, M6 toll and M42 motorways. Water Orton railway station was built in 1842 and is located at the junction of the B4118 and Birmingham Road. The station has limited services to Birmingham and Leicester. The village is also served by the X70 bus to Birmingham and Chelmsley Wood via Coleshill.

J. Shubert,\\"St. Petersburg Times, December 27, 1963.) he was the sixth child and third son of Duvvid Schubart and Katrina Helwitz, a Jewish couple. Jacob was still a small child when the family emigrated in 1881 to the United States,\\"Shubert Brothers pbs.org, accessed June 7, 2009 settling in Syracuse, New York where a number of Jewish families from their hometown were already living. His father's alcoholism kept the family in difficult financial circumstances and both he and his older brothers received little in the way of education and had no choice but to go to work at a young age. With borrowed money, he and brothers Sam and Lee Shubert eventually embarked on a business venture that led to them becoming the successful operators of several theatre houses in upstate New York. The Shubert brothers decided to expand their theatrical operations and in 1900 Sam and Lee Shubert moved to New York City leaving Jacob at home to manage their existing theatres. In New York, the elder Shuberts laid the foundations for what was to become the largest theatre empire in the 20th century including Broadway's Winter Garden and Shubert Theatres. In 1905 Sam Shubert was traveling to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on business when the passenger train he was on collided with several freight cars. Shubert died as a result of the injuries he sustained. His death changed the brother's business dynamics and Jacob assumed a much larger role. Together, although often feuding, Jacob and Lee Shubert overcame the stranglehold on the industry by the Theatrical Syndicate's monopoly under Abe Erlanger and Mark Klaw to build the largest theatre empire in the 20th century.

The books, which are narrated in the first-person perspective by Sammy, involve detective fiction as well as comedy. Sammy begins her adventures in the first book as a seventh-grader, and the series will end when she completes the eighth grade. Eighteen books are planned for the series. Setting The Sammy Keyes novels are based in the fictional town of Santa Martina, which is located in California. Santa Martina is closely based on the real city of Santa Maria, California, down to names of streets used throughout the series, and well known landmarks. Other fictional cities frequently mentioned are Santa Luisa (San Luis Obispo), and Sisquane (Sisquoc). The city of Pomloc is also mentioned once, a reference to the city of Lompoc. All of these places are located near to the real city of Santa Maria. Sammy is an unofficial teenage detective who solves mysteries while also dealing with her personal friend life, family life, and relationship life. Main characters * Samantha Josephine \\"Sammy\\" Keyes is a girl who is illegally sent to live with her grandmother while her mother decides to achieve her dreams as an actress in Hollywood. Spunky, sarcastic, and very curious, she solves mysteries surrounding her town and other areas she visits. Frequently she is tormented both by other kids in school and on the street by people she meets, and whose emotions are constantly tested. She, along with her friends Holly, Marissa, and Dot, plays on the school softball team as the catcher, using a softball mitt that belonged to her dad. The series starts in Sammy Keyes and the Hotel Thief, at the beginning of Sammy's first year in William Rose Junior High as a seventh-grader. By Sammy Keyes and the Power of Justice Jack, she is now halfway through her last year of junior high. She has a strong dislike for her mother for many reasons. When her \\"fourteenth\\" birthday came around, she was told it was only her thirteenth, as her mother had entered her in kindergarten when she was four, falsely assuming she was ready and forging her birth certificate to say she was five. When told Sammy would be held back, Lana refused to admit Sammy's real age to her, out of fear she'd spill the beans. All in all, Sammy is a fun, wacky and a \\"not so typical\\" 13-year-old girl. * Rita Keyes \\"Grams\\" , is Sammy's grandmother and guardian who loves Sammy very much. She never ceases to worry about Sammy when Sammy gets involved in her adventures. However, the two of them are very close, much closer than Sammy is to her mother. No children are allowed to live in the Senior Highrise, so Sammy is frequently forced to lie about her home address and living situation. The two also have to constantly avoid their nosy neighbors (Mrs. Graybill and later in the series Mrs. Wedgewood) to keep the small family from being evicted. * Lana Keyes \\"Lady Lana\\" is Sammy's irresponsible and careless mother. She constantly keeps secrets from her only daughter, and leaves Sammy with Grams while she becomes an actress in Hollywood. She finally reveals Sammy's father's identity in Sammy Keyes and the Showdown in Sin City. She has also kept her Sammy's true age away from Sammy and changed her own identity and age to seem younger. Sammy is not happy with her mother's decision to abandon her, and holds a grudge against her for this. She stars on a soap opera as Jewel, an \\"amnesiac and good friend\\" throughout the series. She is known as the Gas Away Lady and Lady Lana, or when Sammy is on good terms with her (which is not often), Mom. As of Sammy Keyes and the Power of Justice Jack, Lana is now dating Casey's father and out of a job because her soap opera has been canceled. * Marissa McKenze, Sammy's best friend, is extremely rich and has more independence than Sammy because of her workaholic parents. She has a younger brother named Mikey, and he has an addiction for both junk food and goldfish. After Sammy Keyes and the Cold Hard Cash, Mikey's love for junk food goes down and he slowly starts losing weight. When Marissa is nervous, she will do the \\"McKenze Dance\\", which involves biting of her fingernails and bobbing up and down on her toes. Marissa also has a crush on Danny Urbanski, an eighth-grader. Marissa downplays her wealth heavily, sometimes criticizing her parents for working too hard and not paying enough attention to their children. Later in the series, Marissa and her family start having serious financial issues, which causes Marissa to become closer to her brother. * Brandon McKenze is Marissa's cousin and Sammy's good friend. Although he is in high school, Sammy seemed to have feelings for him in the earlier books, but slowly began to become comfortable around him after developing stronger feelings for Casey. Brandon is on the swim team and often invites Marissa and Sammy to his meets. He works at a smoothie place in the mall. He, similar to Marissa, comes from a rich family, as his father is a popular doctor in town. * Margaret \\"Dot\\" DeVries was introduced in the second book, Sammy Keyes and the Skeleton Man. Her nickname is derived from a beauty mark she has on her cheek; her father also has one. Dot first lived in a \\"skinny\\" two-story house that could barely fit her large family; by the fifth book, Sammy Keyes and the Curse of Moustache Mary, she has moved to a larger house in Sisquane. Her grandparents live in Holland and her mother often says \\"ja\\" instead of \\"yeah\\". In Sammy Keyes and the Skeleton Man, Sammy sneaks into Heather's Halloween party by posing as Dot's cousin, and added a fake beauty mark to make it more \\"convincing\\". * Holly Janquell was introduced in the third book, Sammy Keyes and the Sisters of Mercy. During Sammy's volunteer time (to work off her detentions for misusing the school's public address system), she spots a girl who bears an uncanny resemblance to herself. Her curiosity aroused, Sammy tries to find out as much as she can about this girl. Eventually, Sammy finds that Holly is a homeless, orphaned girl who ran away from her foster home due to mistreatment, who had been living in a refrigerator box by a dried-up riverbank. Sammy finds a home for Holly at the Pup Parlor, a dog-grooming salon run by the mother-and-daughter duo Vera and Meg Talbrook. In return for the Talbrooks' kindness, Holly works after school in the Pup Parlor. In the beginning, Holly has a penchant for rummaging through garbage; however, later in the series she seems to have shaken off the habit. In 2006, Van Draanen later released a book called Runaway, a series of journal entries written by Holly that tells about her life on the run. * Heather Acosta is Sammy's archenemy. Their mutual dislike for each other originates at their first meeting: Heather tries to take advantage of Marissa's wealth by asking her to lend her some money, and then jabs Sammy in the behind with a pin. Enraged, Sammy punches Heather on the nose, and Heather pretends that her nose is broken. As punishment, Sammy is suspended from school for a day. Later, however, Sammy is able to uncover Heather's bid for sympathy (including a spurious charity called the \\"Help Heal Heather Fund\\") and Heather is punished. Heather has two friends who are extremely stupid and seem to exist to do her bidding. Heather and her friends have been known to smoke cigarettes and drink beer. She has a brother called Casey, and their parents are divorced; Heather lives with their mother in town, and Casey with their father in the urban area of Sisquane. In Sammy Keyes and the Psycho Kitty Queen, she is found to have the same birthday as Sammy, much to their horror. Throughout the books she has tried to ruin Sammy's reputation, as well as physically attacking her at least once. However, later Sammy and Heather seem to have become friends, as in Sammy Keyes and the Showdown in Sin City, after helping each other find their parents (Lana and Warren). * Casey Acosta Heather's brother Casey was introduced to the series in the fifth book Sammy Keyes and the Curse of Moustache Mary, and seems to be the complete opposite of his sister. He has a dislike for Heather, such as when Hudson asked if he was Heather's brother. He replied, \\"A fact I've been known to deny.\\" He is good friends with Sammy and often sticks up for her. Sammy is often unsure of her relationship with Casey, who took a liking to her before she even knew him. The two went to a school dance together in Sammy Keyes and the Dead Giveaway. In Sammy Keyes and the Wild Things, Sammy began to have feelings for him and they grow closer. Casey shows strong feelings for Sammy throughout the series. Sammy's friends often tease her about her relationship with Casey. In \\"Sammy Keyes and the Wedding Crasher\\", Sammy believed that their relationship would be over because she received a harsh text telling her to back off, but she later found out that it was Heather that sent the text. At the end of the book, the two kiss. in \\"Sammy Keyes and the Night of Skulls\\" the two are an official couple, and they frequently hang out. During the book, Casey's mother forbids him to keep seeing Sammy and takes away his phone, so Casey and Sammy have to meet up in their secret \\"place\\", the graveyard, together at secret times to keep going out. In 'Sammy Keyes and the Showdown in Sin City', Casey and Sammy believe that their parents are getting married, but later in the book find out that it's not true and end up getting off Casey's mother \\"forbidden hold\\". *Warren Acosta is the father of Heather and Casey. He lives in a house alone with Casey in Sisquane and seems to sound exactly like his son over the phone. He has also shown feelings toward Sammy's mother, a situation that disturbs both Sammy and Casey. Warren has a distant relationship towards Heather and has joked that \\"sometimes he wishes that he had a restraining order on Heather, too\\". In 'Sammy Keyes and the Showdown in Sin City', the book portrays that Warren was going to marry Sammy's mother, but is turned down when Sammy's mother catches deep hidden feelings for her past boyfriend. *Candi Acosta is divorced from Warren Acosta, and is the mother of Heather and Casey. She often acts like her daughter portraying characteristics that are vicious and not polite. Candi also hates Sammy and probably her mother. Candi is known for her weird way of dressing up. She thinks she's a young woman, and she is a little nuts in the mind. Candi lives in town in Santa Martina, with Heather, and Casey often visits (by his father's orders.) In 'Sammy Keyes and the Showdown in Sin City', it is proven that Candi still has hidden feelings for her ex-husband, Warren. * Officer Gil Borsch, the figure of the law in the series, is constantly pursuing Sammy for jaywalking and thinks that she is a criminal. However, when Sammy helps him out in a case during Sammy Keyes and the Runaway Elf, he changes his mind about her and they become friends over time. In Sammy Keyes and the Cold Hard Cash, he becomes engaged \\"for the third time\\" and even asks Sammy to be in his wedding. In the later books, he is promoted and Sammy doesn't see him as often. * Hudson Graham is 73 years old, and is always wearing a fancy pair of boots, usually made out of reptile hide. Sammy often visits Hudson and sits on his porch to sort things out in her head. Hudson offers Sammy advice, usually focused around dealing with her archenemy, Heather, or the mystery currently playing out in that particular book. Hudson has a dachshund called Rommel, accused in Sammy Keyes and the Psycho Kitty Queen of mauling cats, and who unfortunately passes at the age of 13 in Sammy Keyes and the Cold Hard Cash.Hudson's advice usually plays a pivotal point in Sammy's unraveling of the story's mystery. In later books, Hudson and Grams develop a mutual crush on each other and end up getting married. * Billy Pratt, an obnoxious, albeit lovable classmate of Sammy's. Billy is one of the popular kids in their grade and was elected \\"School Clown.\\" Billy was held back; he is supposed to be an 8th grader. This perhaps contributes to his depiction in the series as the school clown. Billy has kissed Sammy on a dare by Heather in an attempt to ruin her relationship with Casey, but Billy makes it up to her by kissing Heather (the cod fish) during the school play. In Sammy Keyes and the Night of Skulls he gets together with Marissa, but later she breaks up with him. He is the school clown and can make anyone smile. He is also a very good friend with Casey and is used to communicate with Sammy. His real name is not Billy but William; however, everyone knows him by the name of Billy. Sammy secretly lives with her grandmother in a \\"seniors-only\\" apartment complex. She's not allowed to make much noise, so she passes the time spying on her neighbors with binoculars. One morning she is looking into the windows of the hotel across the street, when she spots a thief burgling one of the rooms. Instead of calling the police, Sammy watches until the thief catches her staring. They both stare at each other until Sammy breaks the spell by waving at him. Sammy Keyes also has many problems. On Sammy's first day of school she gets confused about where to go so she ask's a girl named Heather Acosta. When Heather replied she yelled at her and walked away like was a princess. At lunch Heather sits with Sammy and her friend Marissa and Heather asks Marissa for money and Sammy said no for Marissa and Heather stuck pin in Sammy's butt and walked away. Once Sammy got the pin out of her but she walked over to heather and punched her nose, and it started to gush blood. Sammy was suspended for doing that. While Sammy was walking home from school, she saw police cars and a bunch of people surrounding the hotel. Sammy was curious about what was going on. She decided to go in and she saw two police men asking a lady about a robbery when Sammy realized that the hotel room she saw was that lady's hotel room. Sammy noticed that one of the cops had given her a ticket for jaywalking before. Sammy started to talk to the officers about what she saw but they did not believe her. The lady who got robbed did. The lady that got robbed was named Gina. Gina explained that four thousand dollars were stolen. Later, a threatening note is slipped under their neighbor's door. Their neighbor Mrs. Graybill, thinks that Sammy wrote the note. Mrs. Graybill threatens to call the police and that is what she did. The officers that arrived at the door were the same ones that were at the hotel last night. Even though Sammy says that she said that she did not write the note, no one believed her. Awards Sammy Keyes and the Hotel Thief won the 1999 Edgar Award for Best Children's Mystery. The series has been nominated for the award five times. The nominated books are Sammy Keyes and the Curse of Moustache Mary, Sammy Keyes and the Search for Snake-Eyes, Sammy Keyes and the Art of Deception and Sammy Keyes and the Wild Things.

The name of the village has its origins in the Arabic word \\"Al-Gûzz\\" which derives from the name of the Turkic Oghuz people from the Middle East, whose members settled in the area in the 12th century. The patron saint of the village is Our Lady of Mercy. To the south of the village on a hill is the Chapel of Nossa Senhora do Pilar, from here there are fine views across the area. On the eastern slopes of this hill there is meadow called Amoreira. There have been many archaeological finds here revealing much about Algoz past. There are also two other chapel in the district. The one in the west is dedicated to Saint Sebastian and one in the west dedicated to Saint Joseph. Location The village of Algoz is in an area of the Algarve called the Barrocal or gulley region.Silves, Tourist Guide to the town and Borough, By J.D. Garcia Domingues,: Empresa Litográfica Do Sul, S.A. It is south east of Silves and it is south south east of Lisbon.Detail Regional Map, Algarve- Southern Portugal, The settlement stretches along an open valley, bounded on the south by a mountain and on the west by further highlands. The parish is bordered to the north by São Bartolomeu de Messines, to the east is Tunes and Pêra on the south and west. A stream also called the Algoz runs to the north of the village from an easterly direction, and from the north west a tributary joins the stream which is called Barranco Longo. Further on the stream flows under the Alcantarilha bridge the name of the stream changes to the Enxurrada or the Alcantarilha stream. This watercourse finally flows into the atlantic between Pêra and Armacão de Pêra. Amenities The village has a kindergarten, primary, preparatory and a secondary school. There are recently new built offices for the parish authorities. There is also a sports club which is called Sport Algoz e Benfica who is named after one of the biggest Portuguese football clubs Sport Lisboa e Benfica. There is a market held on the second Monday of every month and a fair is held twice a year on 10 August, the day of Sâo Miguel, and on the day of São Luís on the last Sunday in September. Not far from the village there is a railway station. Local production The lands around the village of Algoz is used for agricultural production. The produce includes wheat, almonds, figs and olive oil. There are also vineyards. There are also many hot houses for growing tomatoes, cauliflowers, strawberries and other early fruits which are the sent off to the big central markets. There are also flourmillls and olive pressing plants in the parish. Other industries The area also has manufacturing plants that produce bricks, tiles and other ceramic items. There are also a couple of plant that specialise in reinforced concrete products.

Califano, Jr., then the United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (today known as the Secretary of Health and Human Services). The program arose from congressional concerns about the health effects of chemical agents in the environment. In October 1981, Secretary Richard S. Schwiker granted permanent status to the program. Interagency Center for Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods The NTP Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM) supports the development and evaluation of new, revised, and alternative methods for chemical safety testing. Alternative methods are methods for safety testing of chemicals and chemical products that use fewer or no animals or that minimize or prevent animal pain and distress. NICEATM is directed by Dr. Warren Casey, PhD, DABT.

Autopackage is a free computer package management system aimed at making it simple to create a package that can be installed on all Linux distributions, created by Mike Hearn around 2002. In August 2010, Listaller and Autopackage announced that the projects will merge.Launchpad.net announcement: Listaller and Autopackage will merge Projects such as aMSN and Inkscape offered an Autopackage installer, and Freecode offered content submitters a field to put the URL of Autopackages. The list of available packages is very limited, and most program versions are obsolete (for example, the most recent Autopackage of GIMP is 2.2.6, even though GIMP is now at version 2.8.2, as of August 2012).Autopackage struggling to gain acceptance By Bruce Byfield on February 12, 2007Projects using Autopackage (archived) Methodology Autopackage was designed for installing binary, or pre-compiled, versions of non-core applications such as word processors, web browsers, and personal computer games, rather than core libraries and applications such as operating system shells. Concept of autopackage was to \\"improve\\" Linux to a desktop platform, with stable binary interfaces comparable to Windows and MacOS. Autopackage is not intended to provide installation of core applications and libraries for compatibility reasons. Using Autopackage to distribute non-core libraries is something of a thorny issue. On the one hand distributing them via Autopackage allows installation on a greater range of systems, on the other hand there can be conflicts with native package dependencies. Autopackage is intended as a complementary system to a distribution's usual packaging system, such as RPM and deb. Unlike these formats, Autopackage verifies dependencies by checking for the presence of deployed files, rather than querying a database of installed packages. This simplifies the design requirements for autopackage by relying on available resources, rather than necessitating tracking all the package choices of all targeted distributions. Programs that use autopackage must also be relocatable, meaning they must be installable to varying directories with a single binary. This enables an autopackage to be installed by a non-root user in the user's home directory. Package format Autopackage packages are indicated by the .package extension. They are executable bash scripts, and can be installed by running them. Files in an Autopackage archive are not easily extracted by anything other than Autopackage itself as the internal format must be parsed in order to determine file layout and other issues.Criticism of Autopackage format by author of Alien, a package adapter tool Autopackage programs are installed to hard-coded system paths, which may conflict with existing packages installed by other means, thus leading to corruption. This can usually be remedied by uninstalling an older version of a package being installed with Autopackage. The Autopackage files can also be installed and removed using the Listaller toolset.Listaller Project Listaller simply includes the Autopackage packages into its own package container format and handles Autopackage like any other Listaller package file.

Ptilophyllum muelleri (Ettingsh.) comb. nov. from the Oligocene of Australia: Last of the Bennettitales? International Journal of Plant Sciences 172, 574–585 The taxon comprises two groups, the Cycadeoidaceae, represented by Cycadeoidea and Monanthesia, and the Williamsoniaceae including Williamsonia, Williamsoniella, Wielandella and Ischnophyton which had slender, branching trunks and either bisporangiate or monosporangiate strobili.Speer, Brian R., 2000. Introduction to the Bennettitaleshttp://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/seedplants/bennettitales.html  Description  Originally, Bennettitales were thought to be cycads for their strap-like leaves, however their flower-like reproductive parts separate the two groups. The two families of Bennettitales (Cycadeoidaceae and Williamsoniaceae) each have their own unique traits. Cycadeoidaceae had stout trunks and bisporangiate strobili (cones) serving as their reproductive structures and Williamsoniaceae either had bisporangiate or monosporangiate cones, and distinctly slender and branching woody trunks. These bisporangiate cones consist of layers of protective bracts, a curved microsporophyll, and an ovulate receptacle.Arens, Nan C.; Stromberg, C; Thompson, A. \\"Introduction to the Bennettitales\\". Retrieved April 16, 2018. The bisporangiate cones remained closed at maturation, and most likely were obligate self-fertilizers.Osborn, Jeffrey M.; Taylor, Mackenzie (2010). Pollen and coprolite structure in Cycadeoidea (Bennettitales): Implications for understanding pollination and mating systems in Mesozoic cycadeoids. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press. pp. 34–49. In general, Bennettitales had leaves attached adaxially (toward the stem) with a distinct midrib. Veins stem from the midrib at an approximately 90 degree angle. They have tough cuticles as well, as they were able to withstand high sulfur dioxide levels in the Triassic/Jurassic period for considerable time. Some were characterized by thick trunks and pinnately compound leaves that bore a superficial resemblance to those of cycads, differing primarily in stomatal arrangement.Pigg, Kathleen. 2005 The Cycads, Cycadeoids (Bennettitales) and Ginkgophyteshttp://lsweb.la.asu.edu/kpigg/CYCAD.html (accessed 21 Sept 2007).  Taxonomy  Bennettitales were first identified by Engler in 1892 as separate from Cycadales, and were then further differentiated into the two groups Cycadeoidaceae and Williamsoniaceae by Caruthers. The Euanthial hypothesis erected by Arber and Parking in 1907 posited that angiosperms arose from Bennettitales, as evidenced by the wood-like structures and rudimentary flowers. This theory placed them among the anthophytes, leading it to be known more commonly as the Anthophyte hypothesis. Based on morphological data, however, Bennettitales were classified as a monophyletic group when paired with Gnetales. Modern theory suggests that Bennettitales, Angiosperms, and Gigantopteridales form a clade based on the presence of oleanane.Taylor, D. W.; Hongqi Li; Dahl, Jeremy; Fago, F. J.; Zinneker, D. & Moldowan, J. M. (2006). \\"Biogeochemical evidence for the presence of the angiosperm molecular fossil oleanane in Paleozoic and Mesozoic non-angiospermous fossils\\". Paleobiology. 32(2): 179–90. doi:10.1666/0094-8373(2006)32[179:BEFTPO]2.0.CO;2. Recent evidence from examining phase-contrast X-ray images of gymnosperm seeds suggested that the Euanthial hypothesis is supported. This is still a hotly debated topic. Mostly, it is understood that by morphological data, Euanthial hypothesis is supported but modern cladistic tests suggest otherwise. Uncovering information about this extinct group is still far from finished, as new species are being discovered such as Nilssoniopteris binggouensis in 2014 and Anomozamites sanjiaocunensis in 2015. Bennettitales are also linked to the diversification of insects due to their flower-like reproductive parts. Specifically, the origin of insect mouth parts is connected to Bennettitales and Gnetales.

Green: newly synthesized RNA strand by enzyme RNA polymerase II (RNAP II and Pol II) is a multiprotein complex that transcribes DNA into precursors of messenger RNA (mRNA) and most small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and microRNA. It is one of the three RNAP enzymes found in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. A 550 kDa complex of 12 subunits, RNAP II is the most studied type of RNA polymerase. A wide range of transcription factors are required for it to bind to upstream gene promoters and begin transcription.  Discovery  RNA polymerase II of Saccharomyces cerevisiae consisting of all 12 subunits. Early studies suggested a minimum of two RNAPs: one which synthesized rRNA in the nucleolus, and one which synthesized other RNA in the nucleoplasm, part of the nucleus but outside the nucleolus. In 1969, science experimentalists Robert Roeder and William Rutter definitively discovered an additional RNAP that was responsible for transcription of some kind of RNA in the nucleoplasm. The finding was obtained by the use of ion-exchange chromatography via DEAE coated Sephadex beads. The technique separated the enzymes by the order of the corresponding elutions, Ι,ΙΙ,ΙΙΙ, by increasing the concentration of ammonium sulfate. The enzymes were named according to the order of the elutions, RNAP I, RNAP II, RNAP IΙI. This discovery demonstrated that there was an additional enzyme present in the nucleoplasm, which allowed for the differentiation between RNAP II and RNAP III. Subunits Eukaryotic RNA-polymerase II from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PDB ID. Subunits colored: RPB3 – orange , RPB11 – yellow , RPB2 – wheat, RPB1 – red, RPB6 – pink, the rest 7 subunits are colored gray. The eukaryotic core RNA polymerase II was first purified using transcription assays. The purified enzyme has typically 10–12 subunits (12 in humans and yeast) and is incapable of specific promoter recognition. Many subunit-subunit interactions are known. * DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB1 – an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the POLR2A gene and in yeast is encoded by RPO21. RPB1 is the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. It contains a carboxy terminal domain (CTD) composed of up to 52 heptapeptide repeats (YSPTSPS) that are essential for polymerase activity. The CTD was first discovered in the laboratory of C.J. Ingles at the University of Toronto and by JL Corden at Johns Hopkins University. In combination with several other polymerase subunits, the RPB1 subunit forms the DNA binding domain of the polymerase, a groove in which the DNA template is transcribed into RNA. It strongly interacts with RPB8. * RPB2 (POLR2B) – the second-largest subunit that in combination with at least two other polymerase subunits forms a structure within the polymerase that maintains contact in the active site of the enzyme between the DNA template and the newly synthesized RNA. * RPB3 (POLR2C) – the third-largest subunit. Exists as a heterodimer with another polymerase subunit, POLR2J forming a core subassembly. RPB3 strongly interacts with RPB1-5, 7, 10–12. * RNA polymerase II subunit B4 (RPB4) – encoded by the POLR2D gene is the fourth-largest subunit and may have a stress protective role. * RPB5 – In humans is encoded by the POLR2E gene. Two molecules of this subunit are present in each RNA polymerase II. RPB5 strongly interacts with RPB1, RPB3, and RPB6. * RPB6 (POLR2F) – forms a structure with at least two other subunits that stabilizes the transcribing polymerase on the DNA template. * RPB7 – encoded by POLR2G and may play a role in regulating polymerase function. RPB7 interacts strongly with RPB1 and RPB5. * RPB8 (POLR2H) – interacts with subunits RPB1-3, 5, and 7. * RPB9 – The groove in which the DNA template is transcribed into RNA is composed of RPB9 (POLR2I) and RPB1. * RPB10 – the product of gene POLR2L. It interacts with RPB1-3 and 5, and strongly with RPB3. * RPB11 – the RPB11 subunit is itself composed of three subunits in humans: POLR2J (RPB11-a), POLR2J2 (RPB11-b), and POLR2J3 (RPB11-c). * RPB12 – Also interacts with RPB3 is RPB12 (POLR2K). Assembly RPB3 is involved in RNA polymerase II assembly. A subcomplex of RPB2 and RPB3 appears soon after subunit synthesis. This complex subsequently interacts with RPB1. RPB3, RPB5, and RPB7 interact with themselves to form homodimers, and RPB3 and RPB5 together are able to contact all of the other RPB subunits, except RPB9. Only RPB1 strongly binds to RPB5. The RPB1 subunit also contacts RPB7, RPB10, and more weakly but most efficiently with RPB8. Once RPB1 enters the complex, other subunits such as RPB5 and RPB7 can enter, where RPB5 binds to RPB6 and RPB8 and RPB3 brings in RPB10, RPB 11, and RPB12. RPB4 and RPB9 may enter once most of the complex is assembled. RPB4 forms a complex with RPB7. Kinetics Enzymes can catalyze up to several million reactions per second. Enzyme rates depend on solution conditions and substrate concentration. Like other enzymes POLR2 has a saturation curve and a maximum velocity (Vmax). It has a Km (substrate concentration required for one-half Vmax) and a kcat (the number of substrate molecules handled by one active site per second). The specificity constant is given by kcat/Km. The theoretical maximum for the specificity constant is the diffusion limit of about 108 to 109 (M−1s−1), where every collision of the enzyme with its substrate results in catalysis. In yeast, mutation in the Trigger-Loop domain of the largest subunit can change the kinetics of the enzyme. Bacterial RNA polymerase, a relative of RNA Polymerase II, switches between inactivated and activated states by translocating back and forth along the DNA. Concentrations of [NTP]eq = 10 μM GTP, 10 μM UTP, 5 μM ATP and 2.5 μM CTP, produce a mean elongation rate, turnover number, of ~1 bp (NTP)−1 for bacterial RNAP, a relative of RNA polymerase II. RNA Polymerase II gray. Alpha-amanitin interaction (red). RNA polymerase II undergoes extensive co-transcriptional pausing during transcription elongation. This pausing is especially pronounced at nucleosomes, and arises in part through the polymerase entering a transcriptionally incompetent backtracked state. The duration of these pauses ranges from seconds to minutes or longer, and exit from long-lived pauses can be promoted by elongation factors such as TFIIS. In turn, the transcription rate influences whether the histones of transcribed nucleosomes are evicted from chromatin, or reinserted behind the transcribing polymerase.  Alpha- Amanitin  RNA polymerase II is inhibited by α-Amanitin and other amatoxins. α-Amanitin is a highly poisonous substance found in many mushrooms. The mushroom poison has different effects on the each of the RNA Polymerases: I, II, III. RNAP I is completely unresponsive to the substance and will function normally while RNAP III has a moderate sensitivity. RNAP II, however, is completely inhibited by the toxin. Alpha-Amanitin inhibits RNAP II by strong interactions in the enzyme's \\"funnel\\", \\"cleft\\", and the key \\"bridge α-helix\\" regions of the RPB-1 subunit. Holoenzyme RNA polymerase II holoenzyme is a form of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II that is recruited to the promoters of protein-coding genes in living cells. It consists of RNA polymerase II, a subset of general transcription factors, and regulatory proteins known as SRB proteins. Part of the assembly of the holoenzyme is referred to as the preinitiation complex, because its assembly takes place on the gene promoter before the initiation of transcription. The mediator complex acts as a bridge between RNA polymerase II and the transcription factors. Control by chromatin structure This is an outline of an example mechanism of yeast cells by which chromatin structure and histone posttranslational modification help regulate and record the transcription of genes by RNA polymerase II. This pathway gives examples of regulation at these points of transcription: * Pre- initiation (promotion by Bre1, histone modification) * Initiation (promotion by TFIIH, Pol II modification AND promotion by COMPASS, histone modification) * Elongation (promotion by Set2, Histone Modification) Please note that this refers to various stages of the process as regulatory steps. It has not been proven that they are used for regulation, but is very likely they are. RNA Pol II elongation promoters can be summarised in 3 classes. #Drug/sequence- dependent arrest-affected factors (Various interfering proteins) #Chromatin structure-oriented factors (Histone posttranscriptional modifiers, e.g., Histone Methyltransferases) #RNA Pol II catalysis-improving factors (Various interfering proteins and Pol II cofactors; see RNA polymerase II). Transcription mechanisms * Chromatin structure oriented factors: (HMTs (Histone MethylTransferases)): COMPASS§† – (COMplex of Proteins ASsociated with Set1) – Methylates lysine 4 of histone H3: Is responsible of repression/silencing of transcription. A normal part of cell growth and transcription regulation within RNAP II. * Set2 – Methylates lysine 36 of histone H3: Set2 is involved in regulation transcription elongation through its direct contact with the CTD.

Associated with pre-initiation and allowing RNA Pol II binding. CTD of RNA polymerase The C-terminus of RPB1 is appended to form the C-terminal domain (CTD). The carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II typically consists of up to 52 repeats of the sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser. The domain stretches from the core of the RNAPII enzyme to the exit channel, this placement is effective due to its inductions of \\"RNA processing reactions, through direct or indirect interactions with components of the RNA processing machinery\\". The CTD domain does not exist in RNA Polymerase I or RNA Polymerase III. The RNA Polymerase CTD was discovered first in the laboratory of C.J.Ingles at the University of Toronto and also in the laboratory of J Corden at Johns Hopkins University during the processes of sequencing the DNA encoding the RPB1 subunit of RNA polymerase from Yeast and Mice respectively. Other proteins often bind the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase in order to activate polymerase activity. It is the protein domain that is involved in the initiation of transcription, the capping of the RNA transcript, and attachment to the spliceosome for RNA splicing. = Phosphorylation of the CTD domain = RNA Polymerase II exists in two forms unphosphorylated and phosphorylated, IIA and IIO respectively. The transition between the two forms facilitates different functions for transcription. The phosphorylation of CTD is catalyzed by one of the six general transcription factors, TFIIH. TFIIH serves two purposes: one is to unwind the DNA at the transcription start site and the other is to phosphorylate. The form polymerase IIA joins the preinitiation complex, this is suggested because IIA binds with higher affinity to the TBP (TATA-box binding protein), the subunit of the general transcription factor TFIID, than polymerase IIO form. The form polymerase IIO facilitates the elongation of the RNA chain. The method for the elongation initiation is done by the phosphorylation of Serine at position 5 (Ser5), via TFIIH. The newly phosphorylated Ser5 recruits enzymes to cap the 5' end of the newly synthesized RNA and the \\"3' processing factors to poly(A) sites\\". Once the second Serine is phosphorylated, Ser2, elongation is activated. In order to terminate elongation dephosphorylation must occur. Once the domain is completely dephosphorylated the RNAP II enzyme is \\"recycled\\" and catalyzes the same process with another initiation site. Transcription coupled recombinational repair Oxidative DNA damage may block RNA polymerase II transcription and cause strand breaks. An RNA templated transcription- associated recombination process has been described that can protect against DNA damage. During the G1/G0 stages of the cell cycle, cells exhibit assembly of homologous recombination factors at double-strand breaks within actively transcribed regions. It appears that transcription is coupled to repair of DNA double-strand breaks by RNA templated homologous recombination. This repair process efficiently and accurately rejoins double-strand breaks in genes being actively transcribed by RNA polymerase II.

Before inheriting the title in 1642 he was known as Lord Strange. He was feudal Lord of the Isle of Man (\\"Lord of Man\\"), where he was known as \\"Yn Stanlagh Mooar\\" (\\"the Great Stanley\\"). Origins Artist's impression (1864) of Lathom House, at the time of the Civil War. Built in 1496 by Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby (circa 1435–1504). It had 18 towers, was surrounded by a wall 6 feet thick and a moat 8 yards wide, its drawbridge defended by a gateway tower. In the centre was a tall tower known as the Eagle Tower He was born at Knowsley, near Lathom House, on 31 January 1607, the eldest son of William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby (1561–1642), KG, by his wife Elizabeth de Vere, a daughter of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. Early life After travelling abroad he was elected as a Member of Parliament for Liverpool in 1625. On 2 February 1626 he was created a Knight of the Bath on the coronation of King Charles I. 1626 he served jointly with his father as Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire, Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire and Chamberlain of the City of Chester. He assisted in the administration of the Isle of Man and in 1627 was appointed Lord of Mann, a position first awarded in 1405 by King Henry IV to his ancestor John Stanley (–1414), KG. Subsequently, he was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of North Wales. Created Baron Strange Arms of Strange de Knockin: Gules, two lions passant argent. Quartered by Stanley The ancient title Baron Strange of Knockyn, created in 1299, as it had been created by writ, was capable of being inherited by females. It had become abeyant in 1594 following the death leaving no sons of Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby, 13th Baron Strange (1559–1594), who however left three daughters and co-heiresses legally capable of inheriting that ancient title, whereupon it became abeyant between all three. They were not however, as females, legally capable of inheriting the earldom, which went to his younger brother William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby (1561–1642). By modern reckoning the abeyance of the barony of Strange of Knockyn was not terminated until 1921. However, in 1594 the status of this barony was not apparent to the family nor to the authorities in the House of Lords, and all parties assumed that the 6th Earl had also become 14th Baron Strange of Knockyn. On 7 March 1628 his son and heir apparent, James Stanley (later 7th Earl of Derby), was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration as Lord Strange, the supposed subsidiary title of his father. When it was discovered that his father's assumption of the barony was erroneous, it was deemed that there were two baronies of Strange, one created in 1299 then in abeyance, and another created \\"accidentally\\" in 1628. Civil War James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby, after van Dyck, Collection of Government of Isle of Man He took no part in the political disputes between King and Parliament and preferred country pursuits and the care of his estates to the royal court or public life. Nevertheless, when the Civil War broke out in 1642, Lord Strange devoted himself to the king's cause. With the death of his father on 29 September 1642 he succeeded as 7th Earl of Derby. His plan of securing Lancashire at the beginning and raising troops there, which promised success, was however discouraged by Charles, said to be jealous of his power and royal lineage, who commanded his presence at Nottingham. His subsequent attempts to recover the county were unsuccessful. He was unable to get possession of Manchester, was defeated at the Battle of Chowbent and at the Battle of Lowton Moor, and in 1643 after gaining Preston failed to take Bolton and Lancaster Castle. Finally, after successfully beating off the attack by Sir William Brereton on Warrington, he was defeated at the Battle of Whalley and withdrew to York, whereupon Warrington surrendered to the Parliamentarian forces. In June 1643 he left for the Isle of Man to attend to affairs there. In the summer of 1644 he took part in Prince Rupert's successful campaign in the north. The Siege of Lathom House was relieved (the defence of which had been led by his wife Charlotte de la Tremoille), and the town of Bolton was taken with much bloodshed, in what became known as the Bolton Massacre. He followed Rupert to the Battle of Marston Moor, and after the complete defeat of Charles's cause in the North, withdrew to the Isle of Man, where he held out for the king and offered asylum to royalist fugitives. His administration of the Isle imitated that of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford in Ireland. It was strong rather than just. He maintained order, encouraged trade, remedied some abuses, and defended the people from the exactions of the church; but he crushed opposition by imprisoning his antagonists, and aroused a prolonged agitation by abolishing the tenant-right and introducing leaseholds. Cornelius Johnson (1593–1661), Tabley House, Knutsford, Cheshire. Stanley was a man of deep religious feeling and of great nobility of character In July 1649, following the execution of Charles I, he refused with scorn the terms offered him by Henry Ireton. On 12 January 1650 he was made a Knight of the Garter by the late king's exiled son the future Charles II. He was chosen by the future Charles II to command the troops of Lancashire and Cheshire, and on 15 August 1651 he landed at Wyre Water in Lancashire in support of Charles II's invasion, and met Charles on 17 August 1651. He proceeded to Warrington but failed to obtain the support of the Presbyterians due to his refusal to take the Covenant, and on 25 August was totally defeated at the Battle of Wigan Lane, being severely wounded and escaping with difficulty. Capture, execution & burial He was with Charles at the Battle of Worcester after which on 3 September 1651 he accompanied him to Boscobel House. While on his way north alone he was captured near Nantwich and was tried by court-martial at Chester on 29 September and was found guilty of treason under the terms of the Act of Parliament passed in the preceding month (which declared those who corresponded with Charles II guilty of treason), and he was condemned to death. His appeal to Parliament for pardon, although supported by Oliver Cromwell, was rejected. He endeavoured to escape but was recaptured by Captain Hector Schofield. He was taken to Bolton for his execution, because of his part in the Bolton Massacre. He was beheaded on 15 October 1651 at the market cross in Churchgate, Bolton, near the Man and Scythe Inn, owned at the time by the Earl of Derby's family. Today the market cross bears an inscribed tablet commemorating the execution. In the Inn survives a chair inscribed \\"15 October 1651: In this chair James, 7th Earl of Derby sat at the Man and Scythe Inn, Churchgate, Bolton, immediately prior to his execution\\". He was buried in the Derby Chapel, built in about 1572 in accordance with the will of the 3rd Earl of Derby,Draper, The House of Stanley in the Church of St Peter and St Paul, Ormskirk. Marriage and children Charlotte de La Trémoille and one of their daughters. Painting by van Dyck, circa 1631–1641 On 26 June 1626 he married Charlotte de La Trémoille (1599–1664), a daughter of Claude de La Trémoille, duc de Thouars by his wife Countess Charlotte Brabantina of Nassau. Her maternal grandparents were William I, Prince of Orange (1533–1584), founder of the House of Orange-Nassau and ancestor of the monarchy of the Netherlands, whose wife was Charlotte de Bourbon, a daughter of Louis de Bourbon, Duke of Montpensier. By Charlotte he had six sons and four daughters, three of whom died young and two of whom died unmarried: Sons *Charles Stanley, 8th Earl of Derby, 2nd Baron Strange (1628–1672), eldest son and heir, who had two sons: **William Stanley, 9th Earl of Derby, 3rd Baron Strange (c. 1655–1702), eldest son, who left only female children who inherited the barony of Strange; **James Stanley, 10th Earl of Derby, 6th Baron Strange (1664–1736), who having inherited the earldom from his brother and the barony of Strange from his brother's descendant Henrietta Ashburnham, 5th Baroness Strange (d. 1732), died childless, when the barony of Strange passed to James Murray, 2nd Duke of Atholl, 7th Baron Strange (1690–1764), the grandson of his sister Amelia Stanley, and the earldom of Derby passed to his cousin Edward Stanley, 11th Earl of Derby (1689–1776), a descendant of Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby.

She was, in her issue, heiress of her father's Barony of Strange, which as it was deemed (like that created in 1299) to have been created by writ, was able to pass to females. In 1736 the title passed to her grandson James Murray, 2nd Duke of Atholl. Today the Dukes of Atholl still quarter the arms of Stanley, Strange of Knockyn and the arms of the Lord of Man. *Catherine Stanley, who married Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester, but died childless Character Lord Derby was a man of deep religious feeling and of great nobility of character, who though unsuccessful in battle, served the king's cause with single-minded purpose and without expectation of reward. His political usefulness was handicapped in the later stages of the struggle by his dislike of the Scots, whom he regarded as guilty of the death of Charles I and as unfit instruments of the Restoration. According to Clarendon he was \\"a man of great honour and clear courage\\", and his defects \\"the result of too little knowledge of the world\\". Literary works Lord Derby left in manuscript A Discourse Concerning the Government of the Isle of Man (later printed in the Stanley Papers and in Francis Peck's Desiderata Curiosa, vol. ii.) and several volumes of historical collections, observations and devotions (Stanley Papers) and a commonplace book.

The village is sandwiched between Junctions T1 of the M6 Toll and Junction 9 of the M42 motorways and the busy A4097 Kingsbury Road. Hams Hall road freight terminal (on the site of the old Hams Hall power stations) and The Belfry Golf Courses and Hotel are also close by. History Curdworth and Minworth both originated in the 6th or 7th centuries, being established by Anglian settlers, and are historically associated with the Arden family (William Shakespeare's maternal relations). Curdworth is probably corrupted from Crida's Worth. Worth means property of and the Mercian Crida owned land here. Curdworth is mentioned in the Domesday Survey (1086). The local parish church is dedicated to St Nicholas and St Peter ad Vincula. Adjacent to the churchyard is the King George V Playing Fields, which was originally a raised clay and pebble base for a medieval Saxon manor complex, which was attached to the church.

It is the largest fresh water swimming pool by surface area in the United Kingdom, being 100 yards (91.44 m) long and 33 yards (30.18 m) wide.The Guardian: Making a splash - A celebration of swimming pool architectureSouth London Swimming ClubWandsworth Council The Lido is on Tooting Bec Common between Tooting and Streatham. An original condition of construction was that it should be concealed from views across the common by a surrounding earth ramp. This ramp is now largely covered with bird-filled trees, except where it is breached by the new entrance. The alternating bright red, yellow, and green doors of the changing cubicles seen above the turquoise water make the Lido a popular location for advertisement \\"shoots\\" and other filming. Brad Pitt's boxing \\"pool\\" scene in Snatch was filmed at the Lido. The Lido is operated and maintained by the London Borough of Wandsworth.  Access  The entrance to Tooting Bec Lido The Lido is open to the general public from late May to the end of September each year. Tooting Bec Lido is home to the South London Swimming Club (SLSC) who have exclusive use of the Lido during the winter months, when the pool is open between 7am and 2pm. Members of SLSC can gain free entry when the pool is open to the public in summer. Adult SLSC membership is currently (2018) priced at £28 plus £110 for an annual lido pass. History Tooting Bec Lido is one of Britain's oldest open-air pools – it opened to the public on Saturday 28 July 1906 as the Tooting Bathing-Lake. Digging the lake had been proposed by the Reverend John Hendry Anderson, Rector of Tooting, as a project to provide work for unemployed local men. It holds one million gallons (4,500 m3) of water. North standing and aerator Segregation of the sexes was originally enforced, with women and girls confined to one morning a week. Mixed bathing was not introduced until 1931, and then only at specified times. At the same time an \\"aerator\\", or fountain, was added to help pump the water round the pool and keep it clean. The main reason given for this act of modernisation was that more women would be swimming in the pool and higher standards of hygiene were apparently needed. Five years later, in 1936, a cafe was built along with cubicles with proper doors. It was around this time that the pool became known as a \\"lido\\" (as this was when the term came into widespread use in England). Tooting Bec Lido was nearly closed as a result of Wandsworth council's financial cutbacks in the early 1990s, which resulted in the closure of the borough's other lido at King George's Park. It was saved as a result of the campaigning efforts of the SLSC, who took over the management of the Lido outside the summer season. Since 1999, Wandsworth has invested in making improvements to the Lido. The most visible (and controversial) was the move of the public entrance to the northern \\"shallow end\\". This removed the need for children and non-swimmers to pass along the narrow paths at the southern \\"deep end\\". The new entrance was initially highly visible from across the Common, reduced the lido's sense of seclusion, and made the lido's northern terrace windier. Plantings of willow trees outside the entrance are starting to soften the visual impact. The pool was drained and repainted in 2005 in advance of a summer programme of events to celebrate the Lido's centenary. More fundamental works to reline the pool and relay paving, requiring a prolonged closure period, took place over the winter of 2006–07. The Lido reopened to members of the SLSC in March 2007, when they hosted the Cold Water Championships. In 2017 a new Pavilion building was constructed at the deep end of the pool on the site of the former entrance. This was funded by a large contribution from the accumulated reserves of the SLSC, grant support from SportEngland and funding from Wandsworth Council. The Pavilion provides a new all year round sports hall and improved facilities for the life guarding staff. Adjacent to the pavilion is some additional terrace space, where is it intended that the brick arches of the original entrance will be reconstructed as a memorial.

A legendary figure in Time Lord history, the Other was only alluded to in the television series, but is featured several times in spin-off media based on the programme. Character development The Other was intended to be part of the backstory of the television series during the Seventh Doctor's tenure and part of script editor Andrew Cartmel's intention now known to fans as the \\"Cartmel Masterplan\\" to restore some mystery to the character of the Doctor. Cartmel felt that years of explanations about the Doctor's origins and the Time Lords had removed much of the mystery and strength of the character of the Doctor, and decided to make the Doctor \\"once again more than a mere chump of a Time Lord\\". Elements of this effort were liberally scattered through Seasons 25 and 26 of the series, and occasionally included hints about the Doctor's past; for example, in Silver Nemesis, when Ace and the Doctor discuss the creation of validium, the Doctor mentions that it was created by Omega and Rassilon. Ace asks, \\"And...?\\" and the Doctor is silent. Cartmel has written that this was meant to indicate that the Doctor was \\"more than a Time Lord\\": In the same story, Lady Peinforte's lines about the Doctor's \\"secrets\\" were also intended as a gesture towards this backstory. The suspension of the Doctor Who television series in 1989 meant that the \\"master plan\\" never paid off on screen. Elements of it, however, were used as part of the background for the Virgin New Adventures line of original Doctor Who novels. Eventually, most of the details were revealed in the last Seventh Doctor New Adventure, Lungbarrow by Marc Platt. In the afterword, Platt discusses the Other, stating that he \\"may not even be Gallifreyan himself\\" and writing: A line in Lungbarrow says that the Other came to Rassilon \\"on approval\\", implying that Rassilon \\"acquired\\" him \\"in some sort of pact with God knows what\\". At the end of the novel, the Doctor learns that Leela is pregnant with Andred's child, and asks her to name it after him; Platt explained that this was meant to suggest a time loop in which the hybrid child goes on to become the Other, explaining the Doctor's half-human parentage in the 1996 TV film. Fictional biography The Other first appears in flashbacks in Ben Aaronovitch's Remembrance of the Daleks novelisation. He co-founds Time Lord society with Rassilon and Omega following their overthrow of the cult of Pythia, which had previously dominated Gallifrey. The Other cautions the others not to use time travel to \\"impose order\\", and later witnesses Omega's apparent death as he conducts experiments on a star. Of the three, the Other's origins are the most obscure, with the circumstances of his birth and appearance being a mystery. Like Rassilon, various contradictory legends surround the Other, some hinting that he had powers surpassing that of Rassilon or Omega, and some even suggesting that he was not born on the Time Lords' home world of Gallifrey. Even his name is lost to time, which is why he is simply referred to as \\"the Other\\". A minor Gallifreyan festival known as Otherstide is celebrated yearly in his honour. This festival falls on the same days as the Doctor's name day. When the Pythia was overthrown, she laid a final curse on Gallifrey that made the population sterile. To ensure the continuation of their race, Rassilon created the Looms, machines that would \\"weave\\" new Gallifreyans out of extant genetic material. Omega apparently died creating the black hole which provided the raw power needed for time travel, turning the Gallifreyans into Lords of Time. (Some accounts suggest that Rassilon misled Omega into believing he would survive this mission.) Rassilon and the Other were left to pick up the pieces, with Rassilon harnessing the nucleus of the black hole to create the Eye of Harmony and becoming virtual dictator of Time Lord civilisation. As Rassilon's rule became more oppressive, the Other knew that his own days were numbered. The Other first ensured that his granddaughter Susan (the last child to be naturally born on Gallifrey) was safe, sending her to the spaceport to get off the planet. Then, in a last gesture of defiance against Rassilon's rule, he committed suicide by throwing himself into the Looms, mixing his genetic material into the banks. Eons passed, and the Looms became integrated into the great Houses of Gallifrey. Eventually, a new Cousin was born to the House of Lungbarrow, who would become known as the Doctor. Disenchanted with Time Lord society, the Doctor stole a TARDIS, intending to explore the universe. However, inside he discovered that the Hand of Omega, the stellar manipulator Omega had used to create the Eye of Harmony, had followed him on board, somehow recognising inside him one of its creators. Although time travel into Gallifrey's past was strictly forbidden, the Hand overrode the locks that prevented the TARDIS from doing so and took the Doctor back to the Old Time. There, a year after the Other had vanished into the Looms, the Doctor found Susan wandering the streets of the city -- she had never made it to the spaceport. Like the Hand, although the Doctor did not look anything like the Other, Susan recognised that there was a connection, and when she addressed him as \\"Grandfather\\", both of them knew that it was somehow right. The implication was that the Other had been genetically reincarnated as the Doctor, although how much of the Other is in the Doctor and how much he remembers of his past life, if at all, is unclear. Susan and the Doctor then left in the TARDIS to travel through time and space. These events are seemingly contradicted by \\"The Name of the Doctor\\", which portrays the First Doctor and Susan entering the TARDIS together. More information about the Other is revealed or implied in the Virgin Missing Adventures novel Cold Fusion, by Lance Parkin. In this novel, the Fifth Doctor encounters a Gallifreyan woman, whom he dubs Patience (though her real name is never said), who it is implied is the Other's wife. She appears again in Parkin's BBC novel The Infinity Doctors, where she was once married to that novel's version of the Doctor, who may be separate from normal continuity. She is a naturally born Gallifreyan, who is apparently immortal, barring accidents, and has lived for over two million years. She was first married to Omega and then to the Other or the Doctor and they had 13 children. In flash back, the description of her husband matches one of the faces seen during the mindbending contest in The Brain of Morbius, specifically the one represented by an image of Douglas Camfield.Parkin, Lance & Pearson, Lars (2012). A History: An Unauthorised History of the Doctor Who Universe (3rd Edition), p. 715. Mad Norwegian Press, Des Moines. . At some point, the Lord President turned against her family, as they were naturally born, rather than from a loom, and ordered the Chancellory Guard to kill them all. Somehow the First Doctor was able to help her escape in a prototype TARDIS. How this account fits with the information on the Other given above is deliberately kept vague and in some cases appears to contradict it. Lance Parkin has indicated that the reason for the contradictions is that he was working from a different version of the Cartmel Masterplan than the version used by Marc Platt when writing Lungbarrow. A possible origin for the Other is provided by Human Nature, a 1995 Virgin New Adventures novel by Paul Cornell. In the novel, the Doctor transforms himself into John Smith, a human with only fragmentary memories of his past life. Smith writes a children's story about an old man in Victorian England who invents a police box larger on the inside and capable of travel through time and space. Lonely, the man visits the planet Gallifrey, where he finds a primitive tribe. He tells the Gallifreyans about science and the arts, teaches them to travel time and space, and advises them on how to be as civilised and law-abiding as England. When they grow dull and officious, he invents a way for them to begin new lives upon death, and gives them second hearts in hopes of making them more joyful. When this fails, he steals a police box and flees back to Earth, deciding that being free is better than being in charge. Smith's story was plotted by Cornell's friend Steven Moffat; Cornell stated, \\"He's always had some radical thoughts about Who, and it was good to be able to give expression to some of them.\\" An alternative theory for The Other was provided in 2017 by Titan Comics in crossover event “The Lost Dimension”. In this story the Eleventh Doctor travels back to ancient Gallifrey by mistake where he meets Rassilon. The Doctor introduces himself as “the other one” and Rassilon consequently calls him “The Other”. The Doctor thus becomes one of the most important figures in Gallifreyan history when he is the first person to fly in a TARDIS.

It was led by tech-savvy businesswoman Alexandra York, and comprised former babyfaces who adopted informal wear and formalized their ring names upon joining. History Miss Alexandra York entered WCW near the end of 1990 as the manager and financial analyst of Mike Rotunda. According to the storyline Rotunda had inherited a lot of money, turned heel and then adopted the name “Michael Wallstreet” (a gimmick patterned after Gordon Gekko from the film Wall Street). Miss York would use her laptop to analyze Wallstreet's opponents and help him win matches. Wallstreet started off strong by defeating The Starblazer at Clash of the Champions XIII before engaging in a feud with Terry Taylor. Miss York claimed that her computer program predicted that Wallstreet could beat Taylor in less than nine minutes, so during their Starrcade 1990 match a nine-minute countdown clock was used. Wallstreet won the match within the time limit. In early 1991, Rotundo left WCW and signed with the World Wrestling Federation where he became a “ruthless tax collector” known as Irwin R. Schyster. With no one to manage Miss York started to scout WCW, looking for her next “project”. At Clash of the Champions XIV Miss York found her man. During a match between Terry Taylor and Ricky Morton Miss York appeared at ringside, distracted Morton and allowed Taylor to win the match. Taylor's turn did not come as any surprise as he was mistakenly introduced as “the Computerized Man of the 90s” before the match. Taylor joined the York Foundation and insisted on being known as Terrence Taylor from now on and started wearing a business suit. Miss York also added Mr. Hughes as a bodyguard. Next Miss York set her sights on Dustin Rhodes (later her real-life husband) wanting him to join her foundation. When Dustin Rhodes turned her down, Taylor attacked him, kicking off a long-running feud between Rhodes and the York Foundation. In April and May, she had Taylor team with Arn Anderson and Larry Zbyszko as potential recruits but they decided to form a tag team called the Enforcers instead of joining the York Foundation. She also gave \\"Nature Boy\\" Buddy Landel a few tryouts but did not sign him as he lost these matches. At Clash of the Champions XV on June 12, 1991, the York Foundation Ricky Morton - now renamed Richard Morton - joined in an attack on Dustin Rhodes and also beat up his longtime Rock 'N Roll Express partner Robert Gibson just as he announced he was ready to return from a serious knee injury. In July, Richard Morton defeated Gibson at the Great American Bash 1991. Gibson left WCW shortly after allowing Morton to focus on the York Foundation's feud with Dustin Rhodes & friends. At the Great American Bash, the Foundation lost the services of Mr. Hughes as he joined forces with Harley Race and Lex Luger, instead Miss York brought in Thomas Rich to be the third member of her foundation. Over the summer, the Foundation continued its feud with Dustin Rhodes, Tom Zenk and Bobby Eaton all of whom had turned down Miss York's offer of membership. The Foundation beat Dustin Rhodes, Tom Zenk and Big Josh for the WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Titles on October 8, 1991 and held the titles until they were abandoned in late November 1991. As fall turned to winter the members of the York Foundation were used more as “Enhancement Talent” to make wrestlers such as Van Hammer or Big Josh. The sole highlight was Richard Morton's participation in the tournament to crown the first ever WCW Light Heavyweight Championship where he reached the finals before losing to Flyin’ Brian. The York Foundation's final feud was with The Fabulous Freebirds and was cut short when it disbanded in January 1992.

The venue is located in the heart of El Paso, Texas. In addition to hosting sporting events, the Don Haskins Center is also used by many area schools, such as El Paso Community College, for graduation and commencement ceremonies. Due to its large seating capacity, the center is also the city's premier entertainment venue and has hosted big-name acts such as pop star Shakira's Tour of the Mongoose, Oral Fixation Tour and The Sun Comes Out World Tour, Britney Spears during her Circus Tour, comedian George Lopez and rock band KISS. History Built in 1977, as the Special Events Center, the venue replaced Memorial Gym. The Special Events Center was renamed after UTEP's Hall of Fame coach Don Haskins (1930–2008) in 1998. Haskins, who is best known for starting five African- American players in the 1966 NCAA Championship game against Kentucky, was inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 1997 and retired from the university in 1999. The arena was the site of a milestone win during the 1997–1998 season, as coach Haskins notched his 700th career victory against SMU. The arena was also the site of the 1984, 1985, and 1990 Western Athletic Conference men's basketball tournaments and the 2011 and 2014 Conference USA tournaments. It also hosted NCAA Men's Basketball tournament first- and second-round games in 1981. In September 2008 Don Haskins lay in state there for several days after dying of natural causes. The Haskins Center features a Robbins Bio-Channel Star maple floor, installed in the summer of 2002, as well as two modern locker rooms, training facilities and basketball coaches' offices. The game-day environment for basketball was enhanced in recent years with the addition of four new scoreboards and two video replay boards to the arena. The arena now has a total of seven electronic scoreboards. While it had originally been built as an alternative to the Pan American Center in Las Cruces, New Mexico, which at the time was the larger of the two arenas, today the Haskins Center is the dominant concert venue in the area. The Pan American Center was renovated in 2006 and has since been used as an alternative venue due to similar concert capacity. It is also the regional stop for WWE when it visits the El Paso area. UTEP Basketball The Miner men's basketball team has posted a 476–140 (.773) record in 34 years at the arena. UTEP won 25 straight home games from January 23, 1987 to December 16, 1989. The Miners have posted undefeated home records in three seasons: 1983–1984 (21–0), 1985–1986 (19–0) and 1988–1989 (18–0). They also won the first 10 conference games they played there after joining Conference USA in 2005. UTEP has defeated many top-10 ranked teams in the Don Haskins Center over the years, including #10 Arizona (1977), #5 Georgetown (1985), #5 Wyoming (1988) and #9 Utah (1993), among others. UTEP has attracted 5,592,257 fans in 34 seasons at the arena. The 11,892-seat arena (formerly 12,222 due to the late El Paso Sports legend Paul Strelzin) has been sold out for UTEP basketball games 112 times. Fans enter the Don Haskins Center early before a UTEP Men's basketball game. Concerts Shakira currently holds the record of having the most shows in the arena as a female artist, with 6 in total: * She performed in the arena for the very first time with Tour of the Mongoose on November 15 and 16, 2002. She returned to the arena on February 25, 2003 for another sold-out show, becoming the female artist with most shows in the venue with one single tour. * She kicked off her North American leg of Oral Fixation Tour in the venue on August 9, 2006. * She brought The Sun Comes Out World Tour to El Paso on October 13, 2010.

The arena opened in 1972. It is home to the Louisiana State University Tigers and Lady Tigers basketball teams, the LSU Tigers women's gymnastics team and the LSU Tigers women's volleyball team. It was originally known as the LSU Assembly Center, but was renamed in honor of Pete Maravich, a Tiger basketball legend, shortly after his death in 1988. Louisiana Governor Buddy Roemer signed an act to rename the building in Maravich's honor (under Louisiana law, no LSU or state owned building may be named after a living person). Maravich never played in the arena as a collegian but played in it as a member of the Atlanta Hawks in a preseason game. But his exploits while at LSU led the University to build a larger home for the basketball team, which languished for decades in the shadow of the school's football program. The Maravich Center is known to locals as \\"The PMAC\\" or \\"Pete's Palace\\", or by its more nationally known nickname, \\"The Deaf Dome\\", coined by Dick Vitale. The Maravich Center's neighbor, Tiger Stadium is known as \\"Death Valley\\". The slightly oval building is located directly to the north of Tiger Stadium, and its bright-white roof can be seen in many telecasts of that stadium. The arena concourse is divided into four quadrants: Pete Maravich Pass, The Walk of Champions, Heroes Hall and Midway of Memories. The quadrants highlight former LSU Tiger athletes, individual and team awards and memorabilia pertaining to the history of LSU basketball, gymnastics and volleyball. There are 11,230 permanent seats in the arena. 6,931 upper level seats, 4,299 lower level seats and 2,000 seats on retractable risers. The \\"L\\" Club meeting room and Tiger Athletic Foundation offices are also located in the arena. Prior to building the Assembly Center, LSU played its games at John M. Parker Agricultural Coliseum (aka, the \\"Cow Palace\\"), located on the southeast corner of the campus. LSU Basketball Practice Facility The LSU Basketball Practice Facility is the practice facility for the LSU Tigers basketball and LSU Lady Tigers basketball teams. The facility is connected to the Pete Maravich Assembly Center through the Northwest portal. The facility features separate, full-size duplicate gymnasiums for the women's and men's basketball teams. They include a regulation NCAA court in length with two regulation high school courts in the opposition direction. The courts are exact replicas of the Maravich Center game court and have two portable goals and four retractable goals. The gymnasiums are equipped with a scoreboard, video filming balcony and scorer's table with video and data connection. The facility also houses team locker rooms, a team lounge, training rooms, a coach's locker room and coach's offices. The building also includes a two-story lobby and staircase that ascends to the second level where a club room is used for pre-game and post- game events and is connected to the Pete Maravich Assembly Center concourse. The lobby includes team displays and graphics, trophy cases and memorabilia of LSU basketball. A bronze statue of LSU legend Shaquille O'Neal is located in front of the facility. LSU Volleyball Practice Facility The LSU Tigers Volleyball Practice Facility is located in the arena. It includes a state-of- the-art locker room facility, film room, equipment room and training rooms off the arenas southwest corridor. The auxiliary gym located underneath the north section of the arena is a volleyball-only practice facility. NCAA Tournament The Maravich Assembly Center has been a host site for both the men's and women's NCAA Basketball Tournament. It played host to the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament twice, in 1976 and 1986. In 1976, Indiana University defeated Alabama and Marquette in the Mideast Regional en route to an undefeated season and the national championship, and in 1986, LSU defeated Purdue and Memphis State (now Memphis) to begin an unlikely run to the Final Four as a #11 seed, the first of only three 11 seeds to reach the national semifinals (the others being George Mason in 2006 and VCU in 2011). The arena has played host to the NCAA Women's Basketball First and Second Rounds in 1997, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013 and 2014. NIT Tournament The Maravich Assembly Center has played host to NIT Men's Tournament games in 1982, 1983, 1987, 1989, 2002, and 2018. SEC Tournaments The Maravich Center played host to the 1981 SEC Women's Basketball Tournament, the 1988 SEC Men's Basketball Tournament and two SEC Volleyball Tournaments. Events In addition to sporting events, the arena hosts concerts, stand-up comedy shows, graduations, convocations, lectures and other special events. A stage can be lowered into place at the north end allowing 4,000 additional seats for theatrical productions. An additional 1,000 seats can be placed on the floor. The arena has hosted concerts by Alice Cooper, Arlo Guthrie, Bad Company, Barry Manilow, Berlin, Billy Currington, Billy Joel, Bob Dylan, Bon Jovi, Boston, Boz Scaggs, Bruce Springsteen, Bush, Cat Stevens, Charley Pride, Chicago, Commodores, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Culture Club, David Bowie, Def Leppard, Diana Ross, Doug Kershaw, Eagles, Earth, Wind & Fire, Electric Light Orchestra, Elton John, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Elvis Presley, Fleetwood Mac, Foghat, Garth Brooks, George Harrison, George Strait, Grateful Dead, Guns N' Roses, Harry Chapin, Heart, Jackson Browne, Jimmy Buffett, Joan Baez, John Denver, John Mellencamp, Joni Mitchell, Journey, KC and the Sunshine Band, Kenny Rogers, KISS, Led Zeppelin, Liberace, Linda Ronstadt, Lionel Richie, Little Big Town, Marvin Gaye, Metallica, Neil Diamond, Neil Young, Olivia Newton-John, Oak Ridge Boys, Pat Benatar, Peter Frampton, Pink Floyd, R.E.M., REO Speedwagon, Statler Brothers, Rod Stewart, Skid Row, Sonny and Cher, Sting, Styx, The Doobie Brothers, The Go-Go's, The Jackson 5, The Moody Blues, The O'Jays, The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Wreckers, Tina Turner, U2, Van Halen, Willie Nelson, Yes and ZZ Top. In 1977, the rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd was involved in a plane crash on their way to play at the arena from their last show ever in Greenville, SC. Several band members including lead singer Ronnie Van Zant, died in the crash. The arena has also hosted comedy shows by Eddie Murphy and George Carlin. Non-LSU tenants After the NBA's New Orleans Hornets (now New Orleans Pelicans) were displaced by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the arena was under consideration as a possible temporary home for the team. The Hornets played just one of six scheduled home games at the Maravich Assembly Center during the 2005-06 season. In 1998, the arena played host to the Louisiana Bayou Beast of the Professional Indoor Football League. The Beast played 2 preseason games, 8 regular season games, and the PIFL Championship Game on August 15, 1998 in the Maravich Center. The arena hosted the Louisiana High School Athletic Association boys basketball state semifinals and championship games from 1983 through 1996. It also hosted the Louisiana high school wrestling state tournament, which was not sanctioned at the time by the LHSAA, in 1972, '73 and '74. Hurricane Katrina In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the arena was quickly turned into the largest triage center and acute care field hospital ever created in United States history. The 800-bed facility, which was under the direction of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was staffed by ordinary citizen volunteers up to and including physicians. Some of the volunteers were themselves displaced from New Orleans due to the hurricane. Helicopters with injured evacuees landed on the infield of LSU's Bernie Moore Track Stadium, which is adjacent to the arena, while ambulances from around the region lined up with other patients that needed treatment. Those deemed healthy enough were either transferred to out-of-state facilities or to LSU's Carl Maddox Field House which had been transformed into a large emergency shelter.http://www.lsu.edu/university_relations/photos/hurricane/ See also *LSU Lady Tigers basketball *LSU Tigers gymnastics *LSU Tigers women's volleyball *LSU Tigers and Lady Tigers *List of NCAA Division I basketball arenas *List of indoor arenas in the United States *List of music venues ReferencesExternal links * Pete Maravich Assembly Center at LSUSports.net Category:Arena football venues Category:Basketball venues in Baton Rouge, Louisiana Category:College basketball venues in the United States Category:College gymnastics venues in the United States Category:College volleyball venues in the United States Category:College wrestling venues in the United States Category:Gymnastics venues in Louisiana Category:Indoor arenas in Baton Rouge, Louisiana Category:LSU Tigers basketball venues Category:LSU Lady Tigers basketball venues Category:LSU Tigers women's gymnastics venues Category:LSU Tigers women's volleyball venues Category:LSU Tigers wrestling venues Category:Music venues in Louisiana Category:Sports venues in Louisiana Category:Volleyball venues in Louisiana Category:Wrestling venues in Louisiana Category:New Orleans Hornets venues Category:Sports venues completed in 1972 Category:1972 establishments in Louisiana ","title":"Pete Maravich Assembly Center"},{"id":"1885716","text":"The Theatrical Syndicate was an organization that controlled most booking in top theatrical attractions in the United States, starting in 1896. The organization, composed of six men, controlled theatres and bookings. Beginnings Early in 1896, Charles Frohman, Al Hayman, A. L. Erlanger, Marc Klaw, Samuel F. Nirdlinger, and Frederick Zimmerman gathered for lunch at the Holland House in New York City. All were theatrical managers or booking agents with influence throughout the country. Frohman and Hayman owned theatres in New York and the surrounding area, Erlanger and Klaw were booking agents for almost all the major theatres in the South, and Nirdlinger and Zimmerman controlled theatres in the Ohio region. Frohman also owned a chain of theatres extending to the West Coast. At lunch, the men discussed the disarray in American theatre. These men had essentially formed the outline of the Theatrical Syndicate. For the Syndicate to succeed, they felt it had to form a monopoly. Within weeks of their lunch meeting, the men had organized all the theatres they owned or represented into a national chain, marking the beginning of the Theatrical Syndicate.Marcosson, Isaac Frederick and Frohman, Daniel.\\"Birth of the Syndicate\\" Charles Frohman: manager and man, Harper & Brothers (the University of Michigan) (1916), Google eBook (Digitized March 4, 2008), pp. 186-187 Operation In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, theatre companies in America thrived by touring. To take control of the situation, the Syndicate needed only to possess key theatres between the major touring cities. The Syndicate did not need control of theatres within the city. It needed only to control theatres on the routes approaching the city. The first city completely overtaken by the Syndicate was Philadelphia because of the influence of Nixon and Zimmerman. At the start, the Syndicate owned 33 first-class theatres. Frohman, Klaw and Erlanger became the booking agents for the whole organization.McArthur, Benjamin.\\"Artists and Artisans\\" Actors and American culture, 1880-1920 (2000), University of Iowa Press, , p. 214 Company managers no longer organized their tours by dealing with individual theatre managers. Instead they had to go through the Syndicate, which arranged their tour for them. Praise The Syndicate was praised in certain circles. Daniel Frohman, the brother of Charles Frohman, gives an account of the creation of the Syndicate. He writes that after discussing the growing chaos in the business of theatre, \\"They decided that its only economic hope was in a centralization of booking interests, and they acted immediately on this decision.\\"Turney, Wayne S., n.d. \\"The Theatrical Syndicate.\\" Wayne S. Turney. Web. 17 Jan 2011. Those who praised the Syndicate believed that they had saved theatre by standardizing bookings. In the time prior to the formation of the Syndicate, routing of road-based companies was described as chaotic. Smaller travelling companies found themselves in debt because of stiff competition. Klaw, who acted as spokesman for the Syndicate, was quoted as saying, \\"The Theatrical Syndicate has brought order out of chaos, legitimate profit out of ruinous rivalry.\\"Hodin, Mark. \\"The Disavowal of Ethnicity: Legitimate Theatre and the Social Construction of Literary Value in Turn-of-the-Century America.\\" Theatre Journal 52.2 (2000): 211-226. Web. 22 Jan. 2011. Criticism Criticism and opposition to the Syndicate came from managers, agents, and actors alike. At first, it was the managers that attempted to put a stop to the Syndicate, but they failed almost as soon as they began. A more serious threat to the Syndicate came in the form of rebellion from actors. The most prominent actors to take a stand were Nat Goodwin, Francis Wilson, and Richard Mansfield. Others who took a stand against the Syndicate were James A. Herne, James O'Neill. One actress, Minnie Maddern Fiske, became very well known for her opposition of the Syndicate. She became famous for her roles in plays by Ibsen, Shaw, and Wilde.\\"Minnie Maddern Fiske (1865–1932)\\" Women Working, Harvard University, accessed December 2, 2011 The voices of the actors were much louder than any previous opposition. However, the fight was a very short one as Nat Goodwin, the original leader of the rebellion, was \\"captured\\" by the Syndicate. The others agreed to the Syndicate's terms very soon after. Shubert family The only real threat to the Syndicate came in the form of the Shubert brothers, Sam, Lee, and J.J. In the building stages of their empire, Sam Shubert was seen as the \\"leader.\\" At the age of twenty one, Sam controlled theatres in Utica, Rochester, Syracuse, New York City, and Troy. In the next five years, he acquired many more, all over the country. At this point, his holdings were only surpassed by Syndicate itself. However, Sam died in a railroad accident in 1905. After his death, his brothers formed a very brief working agreement with the Syndicate. After three years of solidifying their holdings, the Shuberts were strong enough to go toe to toe with the Syndicate. At first, the Shuberts operated in a similar manner to the Syndicate. They dealt with theatrical managers and were able to book a year's tour for the manager, but any length of time after that became unprofitable. The Shubert brothers then changed tactics. They abandoned the approach of buying theatres. Instead, they focused on collecting actors. During the 1908-09 season, the Syndicate did not have enough actors or plays to fill all their theatres. The Shubert brothers took advantage of this by following the Syndicate to certain cities and performing similar works in the same city, but of a better quality. Decline Early in 1910, several prominent actors and playwrights defected from the Syndicate to the Shuberts. The fight of the Shubert brothers gave smaller independent theatres motivation to take a stand against the Syndicate, and by April, the New England area had completely declared independence from the Syndicate. In May of that year, 1,200 small town theatre owners joined to form the National Theatre Owners Association.\\"H. W. Savage Out of the Syndicate\\"The New York Times, July 13, 1910 This act helped to end the Syndicate's hold on American theatre.

It serves as home to several of the university's sports teams, known as the Washington Huskies of the Pac-12 Conference. It also served as a temporary home for the WNBA's Seattle Storm in 2019. Originally opened in late 1927, the brick venue is home to the UW men's and women's basketball programs, as well as the women's volleyball and gymnastics teams. The current seating capacity of Hec Ed is 10,000 for basketball. History=Early history The pavilion is located immediately north of Husky Stadium, bounded on the west by Montlake Boulevard. Originally the University of Washington Pavilion, the building was constructed in nine months in 1927 for $600,000 and opened on After 20 years, it was renamed the Hec Edmundson Pavilion on honoring the university's longtime track and basketball coach. An Olympian in 1912 in the 400 and 800 meters, Edmundson had stepped down the previous spring after 27 seasons as head basketball coach and continued as head track coach through the 1954 season. The building was designed as a multi-purpose field house, handling six or seven men's sports, including use as an indoor football field and track. Seating and flooring were intentionally mobile. The floor was originally dirt, and the football team practiced in the venue during bad weather. The basketball floor was laid over a bed of 2x4s, resulting in a variety of bounce characteristics. Hec Ed originally had glass skylights in its ceiling. During the state high school basketball tournament in 1938, one of these fell during a windstorm and injured two adults, resulting in their permanent removal.Seattle Post-Intelligencer - \\"Hec Ed Pavilion, 71, braces for big makeover,\\" - 1999-03-03 The pavilion was used as a venue for the 1990 Goodwill Games and the flooring was renovated for the event.Ted Turner's Goodwill Games open in Seattle on July 20, 1990.. HistoryLink. Retrieved on 2010-06-23. Renovation After more than 71 years, the multi-purpose arena underwent a major renovation in March 1999, following the final home games of the 1998–99 basketball season. The project took 19 months to complete and cost $40 million. The expansive interior of the building was reconfigured by LMN Architects to make the arena environment more intimate for fans and players, and to improve the usage of the building's overall space.Go Huskies.com - Hec Edmundson The east end of the building was sectioned off into a practice gymnasium and the main basketball court was moved 50 feet (15 m) west, enclosed by a tighter bowl of seats. The seating capacity was increased from 7,900 to 10,000 while using significantly less of the building. Half of the seats (5,000) are the chair type, with the other half bleachers, of which 60% have backs. The seats were supplied by Saxton Bradley, Inc., a local distribution company for educational, technology, and casework solutions. Another major improvement was the removal of the 20 view- obscuring support pillars in the upper level, replaced by two massive non- obscuring \\"super trusses,\\" above and behind the sidelines. Both are in length and painted yellow-gold, as are the supporting tri-leg columns in the arena's four corners, proudly exhibited in the concourses. Additionally, the six large arched windows at the west end of the building were uncovered. Painted over for years, they were refitted with filtered glass to allow them to remain uncovered during games. The acoustical ceiling, installed in 1967 for use as a concert and music hall, was removed to expose the steel rafters. The rafters and the black ceiling above them were painted in an off-white buff tone. New locker rooms, athletic offices, meeting rooms, training rooms, and a Hall of Fame section were also part of the project. The running track was removed, transferred to the new Dempsey indoor practice facility, which opened the following autumn. During the renovation, the Husky basketball teams were displaced for one season (1999–2000), and played their home games away at Seattle Center; the men at KeyArena and the women at Mercer Arena. Proposed basketball training facility In 2011, the university announced plans for a new basketball training facility. The project includes a pre-design study for a $50 million basketball training facility for the men's and Women's basketball programs to be located in the vicinity of the Alaska Airlines Arena. The scope of work may include relocation and replacement of existing ICA facilities related to the new project. The pre-design study will include programming, alternatives, design concepts, cost estimates, and other related reports. The study may include an option to replace or build a new arena for the basketball programs. Nothing has come of these plans since this announcement. New volleyball floor Following the volleyball team's final four season of 2013, a Taraflex surface was installed for volleyball in the summer of 2014. Used for major international competitions, such as the Olympics and world championships, it is composed of vinyl and foam with a thickness of . Washington was the ninth Division I school to install Taraflex and the first in the Pac-12 Conference. Seattle SuperSonics games The arena was the site of a few Seattle SuperSonics games. The NBA team played six regular season games there during the 1970-71 season. In 1980, the Sonics played two games during the Western Conference finals against the Los Angeles Lakers and lost both. They played their two home games of the first round of the 1987 playoffs against the Dallas Mavericks and won both, including the series clincher. The Sonics had to play these playoff series at Hec Edmundson because both the Seattle Center Coliseum and the Kingdome were booked for other events.http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/nba/homes-of-the-sonics/ Seattle Storm The arena has hosted the city's WNBA team, the Seattle Storm, since the 2019 season. The Storm, which normally play at Seattle Center Arena, are being displaced during that venue's renovation into a home for the Seattle Kraken. The Storm split the 2019 WNBA season, playing several games at Angel of the Winds Arena. The team originally planned to play the first ten games of its 2020 home schedule at Hec Ed, between May 15 and July 5, 2020, moving to Angel of the Winds Arena for the second half of the season, but had ended up playing in Bradenton, Florida. https://storm.wnba.com/2020-home- schedule-and-theme-nights/. The WNBA's original schedule included a month-long break in July and August 2020 to allow players to participate in the 2020 Summer Olympics. The Tokyo games have however been postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The WNBA had started their 2020 season in July. Since the arena lacks air conditioning, and the WNBA requires that all games be played in air-conditioned venues, portable air conditioning units have been used during Storm games. Sponsors At the reopening in November 2000, the title \\"Bank of America Arena\\" was added, following a payment of $9.1 million by Bank of America for the 10-year naming rights. (When the naming rights were originally awarded in June 1998, it was to be called \\"Seafirst Arena.\\" Although Seafirst was acquired in 1983 by B of A, the name continued to be used until 1999, when Bank of America retired the brand.) The sponsorship of the arena expired after ten years in 2010 and was without an immediate successor. After several unsponsored months, the university announced its approval of Seattle-based Alaska Airlines as the new sponsor of Hec Ed on January 20, 2011.

The fish is native to the Guaporé River region between Bolivia and Brazil. Sterba's cory is distinguishable from other Corydoras species as it has white spots on a black background on its head. It is occasionally confused with Corydoras haraldschultzi; the difference is that the latter has a pattern of black dots on a white background on the head. C. sterbai has recently become available in an albino form and a black form. Like many Corydoras species, Sterba's corydoras is a shoaling catfish, and thus should ideally be kept in groups of 5 or more. In the wild it can be found in Brazil and thus, wild caught fish prefer soft, acidic water. However, Sterba's corydoras is a hardy fish and tank bred specimens have adapted to a wider range of water conditions. However, like almost all fish it will not tolerate high levels of nitrates. Unlike some other catfish they are not good algae eaters, but are good at \\"cleaning up\\" leftover food and detritus from the substrate. Corydoras sterbai are relatively small for catfish, growing to a maximum size of only . In the aquarium Corydoras sterbai In captivity Corydoras sterbai readily accepts a wide variety of prepared and frozen foods. Flake food is a good staple diet (which will only be consumed once it has fallen to the bottom) as are sinking pellets or wafers. They relish live and frozen foods such as bloodworm, daphnia and mosquito larvae, but ideally should only be fed such foods once a week due to the high amount of protein in them. It is often problematic to feed Corydoras in aquaria with fast feeding mid-water fish such as tetras as flake and sinking pellets are consumed by such fish before they have hit the bottom and sometimes, even while lying on the substrate. However, this problem can be overcome by placing pellets and flake on the aquarium substrate in caves or under bogwood, or other such areas which are not regularly frequented by mid-water fish. Corydoras sterbai The compatibility of C. sterbai is one of their main selling points as with all other Corydoras species as they are very peaceful catfish and can be kept with other peaceful fish. They should not be kept with overly aggressive bottom dwellers, particularly if there is competition over substrate space as there would be in small tanks or tanks with a large amount of \\"furniture\\". Ideal companions would be similar sized tetras or particularly, dwarf cichlids. Ideally Corydoras sterbai should be housed with a fine substrate such as sand or gravel in order to avoid doing damage to their delicate barbels. However, large gravel will suffice as long as it is not sharp edged. Their only other requirement is that shade be provided for them, by means of overhanging rock, large leaved plants, arching bogwood or caves. Breeding is not too difficult. A tank with dimensions 18″ x 12″ x 12″ (10 US Gallon) is recommended. The breeding ratio that should be kept is 2 males per female. Good diet together with repeated water changes and drops of temperature are usually sufficient. However, raising the fry is not easy due to its high sensitivity. Occasionally problems can arise while transporting these fish as they are capable of secreting a chemical toxin when stressed or overcrowded. For this reason they are never shipped with other fish. Name The species name of this Corydoras is in honour of Professor Dr. Günther Sterba, professor emeritus of zoology of Leipzig University, member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Professor Sterba is a professional ichthyologist who nevertheless produced several very popular books regarded as virtual bibles for fishkeepers over the 1970s and 1980s, translated into English under the titles Freshwater Fishes of the World, Aquarium Care and (with Dick Mills) The Aquarists' Encyclopedia, despite his degree of isolation at that time by virtue of living in the then German Democratic Republic.

Daughter of Polish King Sigismund I the Old and Italian duchess Bona Sforza, Anna received multiple proposals, but remained unmarried until the age of 52. After the death of King Sigismund II Augustus, her brother and the last male member of the Jagiellonian dynasty, her hand was sought by pretenders to the Polish throne to maintain the dynastic tradition. Along with her then-fiancé Stephen Báthory, Anna was elected as co-ruler in the 1576 royal election of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Their marriage was a formal arrangement and distant. While Báthory was preoccupied with the Livonian War, Anna spent her time on local administrative matters and several construction projects, including the city wall Stara Prochownia to protect Sigismund Augustus Bridge. After her husband's death in December 1586, Anna had the opportunity to claim the throne again, but instead promoted her nephew Sigismund III Vasa as the next ruler and established the House of Vasa on the Polish throne for the next eighty years (1587–1668). Childhood One of Anna's embroideries: Coat of arms of Poland in silver and gold thread with white pearls on a book from the royal library. It was given to Kraków Academy. Anna Jagiellon was born on 18 October 1523 in Kraków, Kingdom of Poland. Her parents were the Polish King and Queen, Sigismund I the Old and Bona Sforza. She spent most of her childhood in Kraków with her sisters Sophia and Catherine. From June 1533 to November 1536 and from April 1540 to June 1542, the younger sisters were left alone in Kraków while the rest of the family was in Lithuania. That meant that the three sisters grew closer, but were more distant from their elder brother Sigismund Augustus.Duczmal (2012), p. 380 Like all her siblings, Anna received a good education. She was well-versed in architecture and finances, as well as fluent in Italian and Latin.Duczmal (2012), p. 381 In her free time, she embroidered and sewed beautiful tapestries (many of her works survived to this day), played chess and dice, and was involved in works of charity. Marriage proposals Anna Jagiellon by Lucas Cranach the Younger, 1553. The issue of marriage of the youngest three Jagiellon sisters was neglected by both their parents. Only after their father's death in 1548, the first serious candidate to husband emerged – Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, but he was a Hohenzollern and a Protestant, had debts and a bad temper.Duczmal (2012), pp. 381–382 In summer 1548, after a conflict with King Sigismund II Augustus over his secret marriage with Barbara Radziwiłł, Queen Mother Bona and her unmarried daughters moved to Mazovia, mainly Warsaw and Ujazdów Castle. In 1550, Bona attempted to negotiate marriage with Charles Victor or Philip, sons of Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, or Prince Ernest of Bavaria.Duczmal (2012), p. 382 After a family meeting in May 1552 in Płock, Sigismund II Augustus considered marrying his sisters to King Gustav I of Sweden, Dukes John Frederick II and Johann Wilhelm of Saxony, and Duke John Albert I of Mecklenburg,Duczmal (2012), p. 383 but lacked resolve and consistency. In January 1556, Bona managed to arrange a marriage for Sophia. A month later, Bona departed to her native Italy, leaving her two unmarried daughters alone in Warsaw. After about a year, Sigismund II Augustus brought his sisters to Vilnius where they became close to his third wife, Catherine of Austria.Duczmal (2012), p. 316 Even though Anna was already in her mid- thirties, Sigismund investigated marriage proposals. Widowed Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, didn't want to remarry; his unmarried son Charles II (born 1540) was too young; Tsar Ivan the Terrible wasn't deemed beneficial for Poland–Lithuania; and John Frederick, Duke of Pomerania didn't want an alliance with Poland as it would have drawn the Duchy of Pomerania into the Livonian War. King Eric XIV of Sweden was personally more interested in pursuing marriage with Queen Elizabeth I of England, but sought an alliance with Poland and suggested his half-brother John, Duke of Finland. John agreed, but asked for Catherine. It was against custom for a younger sister to marry first, therefore their wedding was postponed.Duczmal (2012), p. 384 Three more grooms were proposed for Anna: Danish prince Magnus was supposed to become a Lutheran bishop which would be unacceptable marriage for the Catholic Poles; the last Master of the Livonian Order Gotthard Kettler wasn't of royal blood and his control of Livonia was tenuous; John's younger brother, Magnus, Duke of Östergötland. Sigismund II Augustus agreed to the double Polish–Swedish alliance,Duczmal (2012), pp. 384–385 but only John arrived to the wedding in Vilnius.Duczmal (2012), p. 385 The court demanded that John married Anna, but he insisted on Catherine. Needing Swedish troops and money in the Livonian War, Sigismund II Augustus relented if Anna didn't protest. Though it must have been humiliating, Anna agreed and Catherine married John on 4 October 1562.Duczmal (2012), p. 386 As Vilnius wasn't safe due to the Livonian War, Anna moved to the Royal Castle in Warsaw and lived there for about ten years with a court of about 70 people. She spent her time playing games, embroidering, praying, and corresponding with her sisters. Her brother visited her annually when he attended sessions of the general sejm (\\"Parliament\\") in Warsaw. Even though Anna was already in her forties, marriage proposals continued to come in. In 1564, Reichard, Count Palatine of Simmern-Sponheim, proposed but perhaps was deterred by her relatively small dowry of 32,000 Polish red złoty.Duczmal (2012), p. 387 In 1568, her sister Sophia proposed Eberhard, eldest son of Christoph, Duke of Württemberg, but he died the same year. In 1569, a project emerged to marry Anna to Barnim X, Duke of Pomerania, who demanded that she would bring eight border territories as her dowry, which was unacceptable to Poland.Duczmal (2012), pp. 387–388 In 1572, Sophia proposed Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia, but Sigismund II Augustus refused.Duczmal (2012), p. 388 Interregnums Polish likeness of Henry III, whom Anne supported and succeeded. In July 1572, her brother Sigismund II Augustus died, leaving the throne to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth vacant. His death changed Anna's status from a neglected spinster to the heiress of the Jagiellon dynasty. Sigismund left all the wealth of the Jagiellon dynasty to his three sisters, but Polish nobles didn't allow a private person to inherit royal possessions.Duczmal (2012), p. 389 Thus, Anna received only a small portion of her inheritance, but still became her a very rich woman. She left Warsaw and traveled to Piaseczno, Płock, Łomża. Jean de Monluc, Bishop of Valence, offered the French Prince Henry de Valois to the electors of the Commonwealth as the next King. Among other things, Montluc promised the electors that Henry would marry the heiress of the Jagiellons to maintain the dynastic tradition.Stone (2001), p. 118 Although Polish nobles sought to keep her out of the political arena, Anna learned of Henry's offer in spring 1573 and became his strong supporter, flattered that he \\"cared for her and not only for the Kingdom\\".Duczmal (2012), p. 390 With her support, he was elected as King of Poland on 11 May 1573 and officially crowned on 21 February 1574.Duczmal (2012), pp. 390–391 However, due to an oversight (whether intentional or unintentional), Henrician Articles (Henry's pre- election treaty) didn't include the promise to marry the Jagiellon heiress and so he delayed. When it became apparent that Henry wouldn't marry her, Anna was humiliated.Duczmal (2012), p. 391 In June 1574, He left Poland to assume his new duties as King of France and by May 1575 the Parliament of the Commonwealth had removed him as their monarch.Stone (2001), p. 121 During the second interregnum, Anna assumed the unprecedented but politically important title of Infanta, mirroring the Spanish custom and highlighting her dynastic status. Poland didn't recognize the status of crown prince since, technically, the monarchy wasn't hereditary but elective between the native noble families and foreign royalty. Despite this, she still referred to herself as \\"Anna, by the Grace of God, Infanta of the Kingdom of Poland\\" (Latin: \\"Anna Dei Gratia Infans Regni Poloniae\\").Dmitrieva & Lambrecht (2000), p. 70Letkiewicz (2006), p. 417 She wanted to marry and become Queen of Poland, but deceived by the French, she was a lot more careful and didn't voice her support publicly.Duczmal (2012), pp. 392–393 She was skeptical of marriage proposals by Archduke Ernest of Austria, Alfonso II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, and Frederick IV of Liegnitz. In December 1575, diplomat Jan Zamoyski proposed to elect Anna. As ancient laws didn't allow an unmarried woman rule, Stephen Báthory, Voivode of Transylvania, was proposed as her husband.Duczmal (2012), p. 392 On 15 December 1575, in Wola near Warsaw, Anna and Báthory were elected as co-rulers of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.Stone (2001), p. 122 However, the Lithuanian delegation didn't participate in the election and didn't recognize its results. Only on 29 June 1576, already after the coronation ceremony, Lithuanian nobility agreed to recognize the couple.Kiaupienė & Lukšaitė (2013), p. 247 Reign On 28 February 1576, Anna entered Kraków as the officially elected queen. Báthory joined her on 23 April. On 1 May, they were married and crowned at Wawel Cathedral.Stone (2001), p. 123 The Queen spent most of her time in Warsaw and Ujazdów Castle. Construction projects Sigismund Augustus Bridge was finished and protected by Queen Anne. Queen Anna's tomb in the Sigismund's Chapel was built during her lifetime. Although she was forced to surrender the inheritance from her brother after her coronation; in return Anna received some of his properties for her lifetime, Mazovian properties that once belonged to her mother, the treasury kept at Tykocin, a one-time payment of 60,000 gold coins, income from Wieliczka Salt Mine, and interest on her mother's loan to King Philip II of Spain (the loan was never fully repaid and is known as Neapolitan sums). Anna was supposed to share that interest with her sister Catherine, but apparently never did.Duczmal (2012), p. 395 Receiving substantial income, Anna sponsored and supervised several constructions projects. She completed reconstruction of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Ujazdów Castle, and the Sigismund Augustus Bridge over Vistula River, the longest wooden bridge in Europe at the time at 500 meters in length. She built the city wall Stara Prochownia, known as the Bridge Gate, to protect the wooden bridge from fire; the tomb monument of her brother in the Sigismund's Chapel from to 1574 to 1575 and 1584 with the help of architect Santi Gucci; and the tomb of her mother in the Basilica di San Nicola in Bari from 1589 to 1595.Duczmal (2012), p. 121 Around the same time, she built her own tomb in the Sigismund's Chapel. Marriage King Stephen Báthory and Queen Anna Jagiellon. Although there were rumors that Anna hadn't had her menopause and thus could still conceive, her marriage was a formal affair. The couple were distant and would see each other only a few weeks a year when Báthory, generally preoccupied with the Livonian War, attended general sejm in Warsaw.Duczmal (2012), p. 394 She supported her husband with money for weapons, but was visibly upset because she sought a closer personal relationship and greater political influence. This was also Báthory's loss as he failed to gain a valuable political ally.Duczmal (2012), p. 393 There were rumors that he might seek a divorce so he could marry a younger woman and father an heir, which further alienated Anna, who even approached anti-Báthory groups and opposed his Livonian campaign. She refused to allow her husband's burial in the Sigismund's Chapel; perhaps it was her retribution for the distant marriage as traditions dictated that husband and wife shouldn't be separated in death.Duczmal (2012), pp. 396–397 Stephen Báthory was buried in the Chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary,Duczmal (2012), p. 396 though his wife did order his tomb monument in 1589.Duczmal (2012), p. 397 Polish Succession Anna's nephew and successor, Sigismund Vasa, in his youth. After her husband's death in December 1586, Anna had the opportunity to claim the political power in the Commonwealth for herself as she was an elected queen,Duczmal (2012), pp. 395–396 but instead resolved to promote her niece Anna Vasa or her nephew Sigismund Vasa, the only children of her beloved sister Catherine and King John III of Sweden. Her initial plan, formulated while her husband was still alive, was to wed Anna Vasa to one of the nephews of Stephen Báthory and promote the couple to the throne. However, this plan didn't gain support among the nobility and she then planned to sponsor Sigismund Vasa to the throne. As a back up plan, she pursued marriage between Anna Vasa and Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria, the other likely candidate to the throne. Initially, King John III didn't want to let his only son and heir out of his sight, but Queen Anna managed to convince him. In her campaigns, she wrote numerous letters and used her wealth to gain crucial support from Zamoyski, who was married to Griselda Báthory and held his own ambitions for the throne.Stone (2001), p. 125 Sigismund Vasa was elected king on 19 August 1587. He and his sister Anna arrived to Poland in October 1587. Later Years Anna Jagiellon as a widow by Marcin Kober. After the coronation and the brief War of the Polish Succession, Anna and her niece settled in Warsaw while Sigismund spent most of his time in Kraków. She became attached to her nephew, participating in his wedding with Anne of Austria and the baptism of their firstborn, Anna Maria.Duczmal (2012), pp. 397–398 After his father's death in November 1592, Sigismund Vasa spent about a year in Sweden. During that time, his newborn daughter was entrusted to the Polish Infanta's care. In July 1595, she was the godmother of Władysław Vasa, the future King of Poland.Duczmal (2012), p. 398 A happier Anna died in Warsaw on 9 September 1596 at the age of 72 as the last Jagiellon.

The class comprises six vessels and they are the most compact nuclear attack submarines to date. All submarines of the class (except for ) are named after gemstones. History Although the Rubis class belonged to the same generation as the , due to President Charles De Gaulle's insistence on acquiring a nuclear deterrent for France, the Rubis program was started only in 1974, after the ballistic missile submarine program. The first Rubis hull was laid down in December 1976 and launched in 1979. Proposed Canada- class In 1987, the Canadian White Paper on Defence recommended the purchase of 10 to 12 Rubis or s under technology transfer, which would be known as the Canada-class. with the choice of the type of submarine due to be confirmed before Summer 1988. The goal was to build up a three-ocean navy and to assert Canadian sovereignty over Arctic waters. The Rubis-class as designed failed to meet the Canadian Statement of Requirement (SOR) as it was noisy underwater and slow. It also came with the caveat that the first 4-5 submarines would have to be built in France. Unlike the British Trafalgar-class, the Rubis design did not require USA permission to transfer the nuclear propulsion technology, as the Americans were certain to invoke their veto of the sale to Canada. The French brought back a revision to their design, added an \\"ice pick\\" so the submarine could operate under ice and were developing a modification for their torpedo tubes which were too short to use the Mark 48 torpedoes.Ferguson, p. 317-8 The purchase was finally abandoned in April 1989 due to high costs, particularly with the end of the Cold War. AMETHYSTE rebuild The initial design of the Rubis proved to be problematic with unexpectedly high noise levels. This led to the Améthyste silencing program (AMÉlioration Tactique HYdrodynamique Silence Transmission Ecoute, literally Silent Acoustic Transmission Tactical Hydrodynamic Improvement) which was applied to the fifth (S605 Améthyste) and sixth (S606 Perle) hulls. Améthyste and Perle were both longer that the original Rubis, as compared with and the program included upgrades to the sonar, reshaping of the hull form and bow to improve silencing and additional upgrades of the electronics. With the upgrades tested and proven, the original 4 boats were rebuilt to the same standards between 1989 and 1995.

Operational history  On 20 August 1993, Rubis collided with the oil tanker Lyria. On 30 March 1994, Émeraude had a steam leakage, suffering 10 casualties.

This was widely advertised by the French Navy but unmentioned by the US Navy. On 12 June 2020, Perle caught fire in dry dock while undergoing major renovations. The fire broke out around 1035 local time in the forward section of the submarine and was described as being \\"unbelievably fierce\\".

He is also known for his stints in the World Wrestling Federation, Extreme Championship Wrestling and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. He currently performs on the independent circuit either as Crowbar or Devon Storm. Along with Terry Funk, Jerry Lynn, Stevie Richards, Raven, and Christopher Daniels, he is one of the few wrestlers to have wrestled matches in WWE, WCW, ECW, TNA, and ROH. Professional wrestling career While attending college, Ford began training under \\"Iron\\" Mike Sharpe. After completing his training, he began wrestling on independent circuit under the ring name Devon Storm and formed a successful tag team known as The Extreme with Ace Darling. In November 1994, Storm took part in a tournament for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, vacated by Shane Douglas; he lost to Tracy Smothers in the first round. After a few years on the indies, Storm wrestled in about 30 matches in Extreme Championship Wrestling in 1996, including losing to Taz via countout at Hostile City Showdown, 2 Cold Scorpio at November to Remember in a Loser Leaves Town match, and Balls Mahoney at Holiday Hell. In 1996, he had four matches in WCW as Dangerous Devon Storm, including a match against Konnan for the United States Championship. World Wrestling Federation (1997–1999) In 1997, Ford, while using his Devon Storm name, took part in a tournament in the World Wrestling Federation to determine the first-ever Light Heavyweight Champion. He wrestled against and lost to Taka Michinoku, who later went on to win the tournament and the title. From 1998 to 1999, he would later appear on editions of Shotgun Saturday Night, losing to the likes of Droz and D'Lo Brown. He and Ace Darling briefly reunited as a tag team (but not using the name The Extreme) in a losing effort against the then newly formed team of Brian Christopher and Scott Taylor. World Championship Wrestling (1999–2001) After leaving the WWF, Storm signed a developmental deal with World Championship Wrestling. After signing with WCW he reformed The Extreme with Darling, but the team saw little success. Following the disbanding of The Extreme, he was placed in a faction with David Flair and Daffney, where he debuted under the name Crowbar. The gimmick of the faction saw all three members act mentally insane, with Daffney becoming known for screaming in her matches and Crowbar being prone to using high risk moves. On the January 3, 2000 edition of Monday Nitro, Crowbar won the World Tag Team Championship alongside Flair after winning a tournament against the teams of Lash LeRoux and Midnight, Buff Bagwell and Vampiro, and finally Kevin Nash and Scott Steiner. They later dropped the title to The Mamalukes (Big Vito and Johnny the Bull) on the January 19 edition of Thunder. After losing a rematch at SuperBrawl 2000, Crowbar teamed up with Daffney to defeat then Cruiserweight Champion Chris Candido and Tammy Lynn Sytch after Daffney pinned Sytch on the May 15 edition of Nitro, thus making them co- champions. Crowbar soon faced Daffney to determine the undisputed Cruiserweight Champion. Crowbar held back during the match, but still dominated the smaller Daffney. However, Candido entered the ring and hit Crowbar with a reverse piledriver and Daffney inadvertently pinned him while trying to revive him and thus became the second woman to hold the Cruiserweight Championship. Crowbar soon began feuding with former tag partner David Flair as well, in which both men traded wins on Thunder. Crowbar soon began chasing after the Hardcore Championship, which he won from Reno on the November 6 edition of Thunder. He later retained the title at Mayhem after defeating Reno and former rival Big Vito. During his reign as Hardcore Champion, he began a feud with Terry Funk that culminated at the final Starrcade pay-per-view, which saw Funk defeat Crowbar to claim his third and final Hardcore Championship. Ford was later released from WCW in March 2001, right before the company was bought out by the World Wrestling Federation. During his time in WCW, Ford continued to work in the physical therapy field when he was not on the road and returned full-time to physical therapy after his release from WCW. Independent circuit (2001–present) After the closure of WCW, Ford, returning to his Devon Storm ring name, defeated fellow WCW alumnus Rick Fuller in a dark match on the April 10, 2001 edition of SmackDown!. He then spent some time in the now defunct World Wrestling All- Stars promotion, where he feuded with Sabu. During his tenure with the company, Storm became the WWA's first and only Hardcore Champion on October 24 when he defeated Danny Dominion in a tables match. In early 2003, Ford wrestled briefly for Xtreme Pro Wrestling under the names Judas and Salem, losing his first match to former New Church ally Malice and winning the second against Vic Grimes. Ford later wrestled in several dark matches for World Wrestling Entertainment, the first being on the April 10, 2001 edition of SmackDown!. From mid to late 2003 Ford, alternating between his Devon Storm and Crowbar ring names, wrestled against the likes of Joey Matthews and former WCW alumni Scott Steiner and Sean O'Haire in dark matches before SmackDown! as well as on Sunday Night Heat and Velocity. On June 4, 2004, Ford began working for HealthSouth as a site coordinator and as an outpatient physical therapist. In addition to working in physical therapy, he returned to wrestling on the independent circuit under his Devon Storm and Crowbar ring names and began competing for various National Wrestling Alliance territories as well as other northeast independent promotions, such as the East Coast Wrestling Association, Jersey All Pro Wrestling, Bodyslam Wrestling Organization, and the Pro Wrestling Syndicate. On October 6, 2012, Storm was defeated by Shawn Daivari in the House of Hardcore's first show. Storm entered the Extreme Rising World Championship tournament which was eventually won by Stevie Richards. He defeated Sabu in the opening round but was defeated by Rhino in the semi-finals.http://www.cagematch.net/?id=26&nr;=2496 Total Nonstop Action (2002–2003; 2013) In 2002, Ford, under the new name Tempest, joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and became a part of Father James Mitchell's stable, The New Church. During his stint in TNA, Tempest took part in TNA's first and only Hard 10 Tournament, losing in the first round to The Sandman, who later went on to win the tournament. He returned in 2013 at the One Night Only show, Hardcore Justice 2 in a Hardcore Battle Royale that was won by Shark Boy. Personal life On August 7, 2004, Ford married Dina Caravella. They have two children who were born in 2007 and 2009. Ford studied at Kean University for six years and graduated with a degree in physical therapy. Chris and Dina currently work at their own health care facility in northern New Jersey where Chris is a physical therapist and Dina is a registered dietitian.

Valuation is used by financial market participants to determine the price they are willing to pay or receive to effect a sale of a business. In addition to estimating the selling price of a business, the same valuation tools are often used by business appraisers to resolve disputes related to estate and gift taxation, divorce litigation, allocate business purchase price among business assets, establish a formula for estimating the value of partners' ownership interest for buy-sell agreements, and many other business and legal purposes such as in shareholders deadlock, divorce litigation and estate contest. In some cases, the court would appoint a forensic accountant as the joint expert doing the business valuation. In these cases, attorneys should always be prepared to have their expert’s report withstand the scrutiny of cross-examination and criticism.  Standard and premise of value  Before the value of a business can be measured, the valuation assignment must specify the reason for and circumstances surrounding the business valuation. These are formally known as the business value standard and premise of value. hmegrii The standard of value is the hypothetical conditions under which the business will be valued. The premise of value relates to the assumptions, such as assuming that the business will continue forever in its current form (going concern), or that the value of the business lies in the proceeds from the sale of all of its assets minus the related debt (sum of the parts or assemblage of business assets).  Standards of value  * Fair market value – a value of a business enterprise determined between a willing buyer and a willing seller both in full knowledge of all the relevant facts and neither compelled to conclude a transaction. * Investment value – a value the company has to a particular investor. Note that the effect of synergy is included in valuation under the investment standard of value. * Intrinsic value – the measure of business value that reflects the investor's in-depth understanding of the company's economic potential. Premises of value * Going Concern – Value in continued use as an ongoing operating business enterprise. * Assemblage of assets – value of assets in place but not used to conduct business operations. * Orderly disposition – value of business assets in exchange, where the assets are to be disposed of individually and not used for business operations. * Liquidation – value in exchange when business assets are to be disposed of in a forced liquidation. Premise of value for fair value Calculation * In use – If the asset would provide maximum value to the market participants principally through its use in combination with other assets as a group. * In Exchange – If the asset would provide maximum value to the market participants principally on a stand-alone basis. Business valuation results can vary considerably depending upon the choice of both the standard and premise of value. In an actual business sale, it would be expected that the buyer and seller, each with an incentive to achieve an optimal outcome, would determine the fair market value of a business asset that would compete in the market for such an acquisition. If the synergies are specific to the company being valued, they may not be considered. Fair value also does not incorporate discounts for lack of control or marketability. Note, however, that it is possible to achieve the fair market value for a business asset that is being liquidated in its secondary market. This underscores the difference between the standard and premise of value. These assumptions might not, and probably do not, reflect the actual conditions of the market in which the subject business might be sold. However, these conditions are assumed because they yield a uniform standard of value, after applying generally accepted valuation techniques, which allows meaningful comparison between businesses which are similarly situated.  Elements = Economic conditions  A business valuation report generally begins with a summary of the purpose and scope of business appraisal as well as its date and stated audience. What follows is a description of national, regional and local economic conditions existing as of the valuation date, as well as the conditions of the industry in which the subject business operates. A common source of economic information for the first section of the business valuation report is the Federal Reserve Board's Beige Book, published eight times a year by the Federal Reserve Bank. State governments and industry associations also publish useful statistics describing regional and industry conditions.  Financial analysis  The financial statement analysis generally involves common size analysis, ratio analysis (liquidity, turnover, profitability, etc.), trend analysis and industry comparative analysis. This permits the valuation analyst to compare the subject company to other businesses in the same or similar industry, and to discover trends affecting the company and/or the industry over time. By comparing a company's financial statements in different time periods, the valuation expert can view growth or decline in revenues or expenses, changes in capital structure, or other financial trends. How the subject company compares to the industry will help with the risk assessment and ultimately help determine the discount rate and the selection of market multiples. It is important to mention that among the financial statements, the primary statement to show the liquidity of the company is cash flow. Cash flow shows the company's cash in and out flow.  Normalization of financial statements  The key objective of normalization is to identify the ability of the business to generate income for its owners. A measure of the income is the amount of cash flow that the owners can remove from the business without adversely affecting its operations. The most common normalization adjustments fall into the following four categories: * Comparability Adjustments. The valuer may adjust the subject company's financial statements to facilitate a comparison between the subject company and other businesses in the same industry or geographic location. These adjustments are intended to eliminate differences between the way that published industry data is presented and the way that the subject company's data is presented in its financial statements. * Non-operating Adjustments. It is reasonable to assume that if a business were sold in a hypothetical sales transaction (which is the underlying premise of the fair market value standard), the seller would retain any assets which were not related to the production of earnings or price those non-operating assets separately. For this reason, non-operating assets (such as excess cash) are usually eliminated from the balance sheet. * Non-recurring Adjustments. The subject company's financial statements may be affected by events that are not expected to recur, such as the purchase or sale of assets, a lawsuit, or an unusually large revenue or expense. These non-recurring items are adjusted so that the financial statements will better reflect the management's expectations of future performance. * Discretionary Adjustments. The owners of private companies may be paid at variance from the market level of compensation that similar executives in the industry might command. In order to determine fair market value, the owner's compensation, benefits, perquisites and distributions must be adjusted to industry standards. Similarly, the rent paid by the subject business for the use of property owned by the company's owners individually may be scrutinized.  Income, asset and market approaches  Three different approaches are commonly used in business valuation: the income approach, the asset-based approach, and the market approach.Economic Principles behind the Market, Asset and Income Approaches Within each of these approaches, there are various techniques for determining the value of a business using the definition of value appropriate for the appraisal assignment. Generally, the income approaches determine value by calculating the net present value of the benefit stream generated by the business (discounted cash flow); the asset-based approaches determine value by adding the sum of the parts of the business (net asset value); and the market approaches determine value by comparing the subject company to other companies in the same industry, of the same size, and/or within the same region. A number of business valuation models can be constructed that utilize various methods under the three business valuation approaches. Venture Capitalists and Private Equity professionals have long used the First chicago method which essentially combines the income approach with the market approach. In certain cases equity may also be valued by applying the techniques and frameworks developed for financial options, via a real options framework, as discussed below. In determining which of these approaches to use, the valuation professional must exercise discretion. Each technique has advantages and drawbacks, which must be considered when applying those techniques to a particular subject company. Most treatises and court decisions encourage the valuator to consider more than one technique, which must be reconciled with each other to arrive at a value conclusion. A measure of common sense and a good grasp of mathematics is helpful.  Income approach  The income approach relies upon the economic principle of expectation: the value of business is based on the expected economic benefit and level of risk associated with the investment. Income based valuation methods determine fair market value by dividing the benefit stream generated by the subject or target company times a discount or capitalization rate. The discount or capitalization rate converts the stream of benefits into present value. There are several different income methods, including capitalization of earnings or cash flows, discounted future cash flows (\\"DCF\\"), and the excess earnings method (which is a hybrid of asset and income approaches). The result of a value calculation under the income approach is generally the fair market value of a controlling, marketable interest in the subject company, since the entire benefit stream of the subject company is most often valued, and the capitalization and discount rates are derived from statistics concerning public companies. IRS Revenue Ruling 59-60 states that earnings are preeminent for the valuation of closely held operating companies. However, income valuation methods can also be used to establish the value of a severable business asset as long as an income stream can be attributed to it. An example is licensable intellectual property whose value needs to be established to arrive at a supportable royalty structure.  Discount or capitalization rates  A discount rate or capitalization rate is used to determine the present value of the expected returns of a business. The discount rate and capitalization rate are closely related to each other, but distinguishable. Generally speaking, the discount rate or capitalization rate may be defined as the yield necessary to attract investors to a particular investment, given the risks associated with that investment. See Required rate of return. * In DCF valuations, the discount rate, often an estimate of the cost of capital for the business, is used to calculate the net present value of a series of projected cash flows. The discount rate can also be viewed as the required rate of return the investors expect to receive from the business enterprise, given the level of risk they undertake. * On the other hand, a capitalization rate is applied in methods of business valuation that are based on business data for a single period of time. For example, in real estate valuations for properties that generate cash flows, a capitalization rate may be applied to the net operating income (NOI) (i.e., income before depreciation and interest expenses) of the property for the trailing twelve months. There are several different methods of determining the appropriate discount rates. The discount rate is composed of two elements: (1) the risk-free rate, which is the return that an investor would expect from a secure, practically risk-free investment, such as a high quality government bond; plus (2) a risk premium that compensates an investor for the relative level of risk associated with a particular investment in excess of the risk-free rate. Most importantly, the selected discount or capitalization rate must be consistent with stream of benefits to which it is to be applied. Capitalization and discounting valuation calculations become mathematically equivalent under the assumption that the business income grows at a constant rate. = Capital asset pricing model (CAPM) = The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) provides one method of determining a discount rate in business valuation. The CAPM originated from the Nobel Prize-winning studies of Harry Markowitz, James Tobin, and William Sharpe. The method derives the discount rate by adding risk premium to the risk-free rate. The risk premium is derived by multiplying the equity risk premium with \\"beta\\", a measure of stock price volatility. Beta is compiled by various researchers for particular industries and companies, and measures systematic risks of investment. One of the criticisms of the CAPM is that beta is derived from volatility of prices of publicly traded companies, which differ from non-publicly companies in liquidity, marketability, capital structures and control. Other aspects such as access to credit markets, size, and management depth are generally different, too. The rate build-up method also requires an assessment of the subject company's risk, which provides valuation of itself. Where a privately held company can be shown to be sufficiently similar to a public company, the CAPM may be suitable. However, it requires the knowledge of market stock prices for calculation. For private companies that do not sell stock on the public capital markets, this information is not readily available. Therefore, calculation of beta for private firms is problematic. The build-up cost of capital model is the typical choice in such cases.  Alternative valuation approaches and factor models  With regard to capital market-oriented valuation approaches there are numerous valuation approaches besides the traditional CAPM model. They include, for example, the Arbitrage pricing theory (APT) as well as the Consumption-based Capital Asset Pricing Model (CCAPM). Furthermore, alternative capital market models were developed, having in common that expected return hinge on multiple risk sources and thus being less restrictive: * Models of the Q theory * Fama–French three-factor model * Carhart four-factor model * Fama-French five-factor model Nevertheless, even these models are not wholly consistent, as they also show market anomalies. However, the method of incomplete replication and risk covering come along without the need of capital market data and thus being more solid. Equally notable is the existence of investment based approaches, considering different investment opportunities and determining an investment program by means of linear optimization. Among them the approximative decomposition valuation approach can be found. =Modified capital asset pricing model= The cost of equity (Ke) is computed by using the modified capital asset pricing model (Mod. CAPM) k_e = R_f + \\\\beta ( R_m-R_f) + SCRP + CSRP Where: R_f = Risk free rate of return (Generally taken as 10-year Government Bond Yield) \\\\beta = Beta Value (Sensitivity of the stock returns to market returns) k_e = Cost of Equity R_m = Market Rate of Return SCRP = Small Company Risk Premium CSRP= Company specific Risk premium = Weighted average cost of capital (\\"WACC\\") = The weighted average cost of capital is an approach to determining a discount rate. The WACC method determines the subject company's actual cost of capital by calculating the weighted average of the company's cost of debt and cost of equity. The WACC must be applied to the subject company's net cash flow to total invested capital. One of the problems with this method is that the valuator may elect to calculate WACC according to the subject company's existing capital structure, the average industry capital structure, or the optimal capital structure. Such discretion detracts from the objectivity of this approach, in the minds of some critics. Indeed, since the WACC captures the risk of the subject business itself, the existing or contemplated capital structures, rather than industry averages, are the appropriate choices for business valuation. Once the capitalization rate or discount rate is determined, it must be applied to an appropriate economic income stream: pretax cash flow, aftertax cash flow, pretax net income, after tax net income, excess earnings, projected cash flow, etc. The result of this formula is the indicated value before discounts. Before moving on to calculate discounts, however, the valuation professional must consider the indicated value under the asset and market approaches. Careful matching of the discount rate to the appropriate measure of economic income is critical to the accuracy of the business valuation results. Net cash flow is a frequent choice in professionally conducted business appraisals. The rationale behind this choice is that this earnings basis corresponds to the equity discount rate derived from the Build-Up or CAPM models: the returns obtained from investments in publicly traded companies can easily be represented in terms of net cash flows. At the same time, the discount rates are generally also derived from the public capital markets data. = Build-Up Method = The Build-Up Method is a widely recognized method of determining the after-tax net cash flow discount rate, which in turn yields the capitalization rate. The figures used in the Build-Up Method are derived from various sources. This method is called a \\"build-up\\" method because it is the sum of risks associated with various classes of assets. It is based on the principle that investors would require a greater return on classes of assets that are more risky. #The first element of a Build-Up capitalization rate is the risk-free rate, which is the rate of return for long-term government bonds. #Investors who buy large-cap equity stocks, which are inherently more risky than long-term government bonds, require a greater return, so the next element of the Build-Up method is the equity risk premium. In determining a company's value, the long-horizon equity risk premium is used because the Company's life is assumed to be infinite. The sum of the risk-free rate and the equity risk premium yields the long-term average market rate of return on large public company stocks. #Similarly, investors who invest in small cap stocks, which are riskier than blue-chip stocks, require a greater return, called the \\"size premium.\\" Size premium data is generally available from two sources: Morningstar's (formerly Ibbotson & Associates') Stocks, Bonds, Bills & Inflation and Duff & Phelps' Risk Premium Report. By adding the first three elements of a Build-Up discount rate, we can determine the rate of return that investors would require on their investments in small public company stocks. These three elements of the Build-Up discount rate are known collectively as the \\"systematic risks.\\" This type of investment risk cannot be avoided through portfolio diversification. It arises from external factors and affect every type of investment in the economy. As a result, investors taking systematic risk are rewarded by an additional premium. In addition to systematic risks, the discount rate must include \\"unsystematic risk\\" representing that portion of total investment risk that can be avoided through diversification. Public capital markets do not provide evidence of unsystematic risk since investors that fail to diversify cannot expect additional returns. Unsystematic risk falls into two categories. #One of those categories is the \\"industry risk premium\\". It is also known as idiosyncratic risk and can be observed by studying the returns of a group of companies operating in the same industry sector. Morningstar's yearbooks contain empirical data to quantify the risks associated with various industries, grouped by SIC industry code. #The other category of unsystematic risk is referred to as \\"company specific risk.\\" Historically, no published data has been available to quantify specific company risks. However, as of late 2006, new research has been able to quantify, or isolate, this risk for publicly traded stocks through the use of Total Beta calculations. P. Butler and K. Pinkerton have outlined a procedure which sets the following two equations together: :Total Cost of Equity (TCOE) = risk-free rate + total beta * equity risk premium :: = risk-free rate + beta * equity risk premium + size premium + company-specific risk premium The only unknown in the two equations is the company specific risk premium. While it is possible to isolate the company-specific risk premium as shown above, many appraisers just key in on the total cost of equity (TCOE) provided by the first equation. It is similar to using the market approach in the income approach instead of adding separate (and potentially redundant) measures of risk in the build-up approach. The use of total beta (developed by Aswath Damodaran) is a relatively new concept. It is, however, gaining acceptance in the business valuation Consultancy community since it is based on modern portfolio theory. Total beta can help appraisers develop a cost of capital who were content to use their intuition alone when previously adding a purely subjective company-specific risk premium in the build-up approach. It is important to understand why this capitalization rate for small, privately held companies is significantly higher than the return that an investor might expect to receive from other common types of investments, such as money market accounts, mutual funds, or even real estate. Those investments involve substantially lower levels of risk than an investment in a closely held company. Depository accounts are insured by the federal government (up to certain limits); mutual funds are composed of publicly traded stocks, for which risk can be substantially minimized through portfolio diversification. Closely held companies, on the other hand, frequently fail for a variety of reasons too numerous to name. Examples of the risk can be witnessed in the storefronts on every Main Street in America. There are no federal guarantees. The risk of investing in a private company cannot be reduced through diversification, and most businesses do not own the type of hard assets that can ensure capital appreciation over time. This is why investors demand a much higher return on their investment in closely held businesses; such investments are inherently much more risky. (This paragraph is biased, presuming that by the mere fact that a company is closely held, it is prone towards failure.)  Asset-based approaches  In asset-based analysis the value of a business is equal to the sum of its parts. That is the theory underlying the asset-based approaches to business valuation. The asset approach to business valuation reported on the books of the subject company at their acquisition value, net of depreciation where applicable. These values must be adjusted to fair market value wherever possible. The value of a company's intangible assets, such as goodwill, is generally impossible to determine apart from the company's overall enterprise value. For this reason, the asset-based approach is not the most probative method of determining the value of going business concerns. In these cases, the asset-based approach yields a result that is probably lesser than the fair market value of the business. In considering an asset-based approach, the valuation professional must consider whether the shareholder whose interest is being valued would have any authority to access the value of the assets directly. Shareholders own shares in a corporation, but not its assets, which are owned by the corporation. A controlling shareholder may have the authority to direct the corporation to sell all or part of the assets it owns and to distribute the proceeds to the shareholder(s). The non-controlling shareholder, however, lacks this authority and cannot access the value of the assets. As a result, the value of a corporation's assets is not the true indicator of value to a shareholder who cannot avail himself of that value. The asset based approach is the entry barrier value and should preferably to be used in businesses having mature or declining growth cycle and is more suitable for capital intensive industry. Adjusted net book value may be the most relevant standard of value where liquidation is imminent or ongoing; where a company earnings or cash flow are nominal, negative or worth less than its assets; or where net book value is standard in the industry in which the company operates. The adjusted net book value may also be used as a \\"sanity check\\" when compared to other methods of valuation, such as the income and market approaches...  Market approaches  The market approach to business valuation is rooted in the economic principle of competition: that in a free market the supply and demand forces will drive the price of business assets to a certain equilibrium. Buyers would not pay more for the business, and the sellers will not accept less, than the price of a comparable business enterprise. The buyers and sellers are assumed to be equally well informed and acting in their own interests to conclude a transaction. It is similar in many respects to the \\"comparable sales\\" method that is commonly used in real estate appraisal. The market price of the stocks of publicly traded companies engaged in the same or a similar line of business, whose shares are actively traded in a free and open market, can be a valid indicator of value when the transactions in which stocks are traded are sufficiently similar to permit meaningful comparison. The difficulty lies in identifying public companies that are sufficiently comparable to the subject company for this purpose. Also, as for a private company, the equity is less liquid (in other words its stocks are less easy to buy or sell) than for a public company, its value is considered to be slightly lower than such a market-based valuation would give. When there is a lack of comparison with direct competition, a meaningful alternative could be a vertical value-chain approach where the subject company is compared with, for example, a known downstream industry to have a good feel of its value by building useful correlations with its downstream companies. Such comparison often reveals useful insights which help business analysts better understand performance relationship between the subject company and its downstream industry. For example, if a growing subject company is in an industry more concentrated than its downstream industry with a high degree of interdependence, one should logically expect the subject company performs better than the downstream industry in terms of growth, margins and risk.  Guideline Public Company method  Guideline Public Company method entails a comparison of the subject company to publicly traded companies. The comparison is generally based on published data regarding the public companies' stock price and earnings, sales, or revenues, which is expressed as a fraction known as a \\"multiple.\\" If the guideline public companies are sufficiently similar to each other and the subject company to permit a meaningful comparison, then their multiples should be similar. The public companies identified for comparison purposes should be similar to the subject company in terms of industry, product lines, market, growth, margins and risk. However, if the subject company is privately owned, its value must be adjusted for lack of marketability. This is usually represented by a discount, or a percentage reduction in the value of the company when compared to its publicly traded counterparts. This reflects the higher risk associated with holding stock in a private company. The difference in value can be quantified by applying a discount for lack of marketability. This discount is determined by studying prices paid for shares of ownership in private companies that eventually offer their stock in a public offering. Alternatively, the lack of marketability can be assessed by comparing the prices paid for restricted shares to fully marketable shares of stock of public companies. Option pricing approaches As above, in certain cases equity may be valued by applying the techniques and frameworks developed for financial options, via a real options framework.Aswath Damodaran (Stern School of Business): Applications Of Option Pricing Theory To Equity Valuation and Option Pricing Applications in Valuation. For general discussion as to context see § \\"Valuing flexibility\\" under corporate finance, , and Contingent claim valuation; for detail as to applicability and other considerations see § \\"Limitations\\" under real options valuation. In general, equity may be viewed as a call option on the firm, and this allows for the valuation of troubled firms which may otherwise be difficult to analyse.Aswath Damodaran (Stern School of Business): Valuing Firms in Distress. The classic application of this approach is to the valuation of distressed securities, already discussed in the original Black- Scholes paper. Here, since the principle of limited liability protects equity investors, shareholders would choose not to repay the firm's debt where the value of the firm (as perceived) is less than the value of the outstanding debt; see bond valuation. Of course, where firm value is greater than debt value, the shareholders would choose to repay (i.e. exercise their option) and not to liquidate. Thus analogous to out the money options which nevertheless have value, equity will (may) have value even if the value of the firm falls (well) below the face value of the outstanding debt—and this value can (should) be determined using the appropriate option valuation technique. See also Merton model. (A further application of this principle is the analysis of principal–agent problems; see contract design under principal–agent problem.) Certain business situations, and the parent firms in those cases, are also logically analysed under an options framework; see \\"Applications\\" under the Real options valuation references. Just as a financial option gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security at a given price, companies that make strategic investments have the right, but not the obligation, to exploit opportunities in the future; management will of course only exercise where this makes economic sense. Thus, for companies facing uncertainty of this type, the stock price may (should) be seen as the sum of the value of existing businesses (i.e., the discounted cash flow value) plus any real option value.Alfred Rappaport and Michael Mauboussin (Columbia Business School): How Do You Assess The Value of A Company's \\"Real Options\\"? Equity valuations here, may (should) thus proceed likewise. Compare PVGO. A common application is to natural resource investments. Here, the underlying asset is the resource itself; the value of the asset is a function of both quantity of resource available and the price of the commodity in question. The value of the resource is then the difference between the value of the asset and the cost associated with developing the resource. Where positive (\\"in the money\\") management will undertake the development, and will not do so otherwise, and a resource project is thus effectively a call option. A resource firm may (should) therefore also be analysed using the options approach. Specifically, the value of the firm comprises the value of already active projects determined via DCF valuation (or other standard techniques) and undeveloped reserves as analysed using the real options framework. See Mineral economics. Product patents may also be valued as options, and the value of firms holding these patents—typically firms in the bio-science, technology, and pharmaceutical sectors—can (should) similarly be viewed as the sum of the value of products in place and the portfolio of patents yet to be deployed.P. Alonso, V. Azofra, and G. de la Fuente. (2006). The real options component of firm market value: The case of the technological corporation ; A. Buckley, K. Tse, H. Rijken and H. Eijgenhuijsen. (2002). Stock Market Valuation with Real Options: lessons from Netscape As regards the option analysis, since the patent provides the firm with the right to develop the product, it will do so only if the present value of the expected cash flows from the product exceeds the cost of development, and the patent rights thus correspond to a call option. See . Similar analysis may be applied to options on films (or other works of intellectual property) and the valuation of film studios.  Cultural valuation method  Besides mathematical approaches for the valuation of companies a rather unknown method includes also the cultural aspect. The so-called Cultural valuation method (Cultural Due Diligence) seeks to combine existing knowledge, motivation and internal culture with the results of a net-asset-value method. Especially during a company takeover uncovering hidden problems is of high importance for a later success of the business venture.  Discounts and premiums  The valuation approaches yield the fair market value of the Company as a whole. In valuing a minority, non- controlling interest in a business, however, the valuation professional must consider the applicability of discounts that affect such interests. Discussions of discounts and premiums frequently begin with a review of the \\"levels of value\\". There are three common levels of value: controlling interest, marketable minority, and non-marketable minority. The intermediate level, marketable minority interest, is less than the controlling interest level and higher than the non-marketable minority interest level. The marketable minority interest level represents the perceived value of equity interests that are freely traded without any restrictions. These interests are generally traded on the New York Stock Exchange, AMEX, NASDAQ, and other exchanges where there is a ready market for equity securities. These values represent a minority interest in the subject companies – small blocks of stock that represent less than 50% of the company's equity, and usually much less than 50%. Controlling interest level is the value that an investor would be willing to pay to acquire more than 50% of a company's stock, thereby gaining the attendant prerogatives of control. Some of the prerogatives of control include: electing directors, hiring and firing the company's management and determining their compensation; declaring dividends and distributions, determining the company's strategy and line of business, and acquiring, selling or liquidating the business. This level of value generally contains a control premium over the intermediate level of value, which typically ranges from 25% to 50%. An additional premium may be paid by strategic investors who are motivated by synergistic motives. Non-marketable, minority level is the lowest level on the chart, representing the level at which non-controlling equity interests in private companies are generally valued or traded. This level of value is discounted because no ready market exists in which to purchase or sell interests. Private companies are less \\"liquid\\" than publicly traded companies, and transactions in private companies take longer and are more uncertain. Between the intermediate and lowest levels of the chart, there are restricted shares of publicly traded companies. Despite a growing inclination of the IRS and Tax Courts to challenge valuation discounts, Shannon Pratt suggested in a scholarly presentation recently that valuation discounts are actually increasing as the differences between public and private companies is widening . Publicly traded stocks have grown more liquid in the past decade due to rapid electronic trading, reduced commissions, and governmental deregulation. These developments have not improved the liquidity of interests in private companies, however. Valuation discounts are multiplicative, so they must be considered in order. Control premiums and their inverse, minority interest discounts, are considered before marketability discounts are applied.  Discount for lack of control  The first discount that must be considered is the discount for lack of control, which in this instance is also a minority interest discount. Minority interest discounts are the inverse of control premiums, to which the following mathematical relationship exists: MID = 1 – [1 / (1 + CP)] The most common source of data regarding control premiums is the Control Premium Study, published annually by Mergerstat since 1972. Mergerstat compiles data regarding publicly announced mergers, acquisitions and divestitures involving 10% or more of the equity interests in public companies, where the purchase price is $1 million or more and at least one of the parties to the transaction is a U.S. entity. Mergerstat defines the \\"control premium\\" as the percentage difference between the acquisition price and the share price of the freely traded public shares five days prior to the announcement of the M&A; transaction. While it is not without valid criticism, Mergerstat control premium data (and the minority interest discount derived therefrom) is widely accepted within the valuation profession.  Discount for lack of marketability  A \\"discount for lack of marketability\\" (DLOM) may be applied to a minority block of stock to alter the valuation of that block. Another factor to be considered in valuing closely held companies is the marketability of an interest in such businesses. Marketability is defined as the ability to convert the business interest into cash quickly, with minimum transaction and administrative costs, and with a high degree of certainty as to the amount of net proceeds. There is usually a cost and a time lag associated with locating interested and capable buyers of interests in privately held companies, because there is no established market of readily available buyers and sellers. All other factors being equal, an interest in a publicly traded company is worth more because it is readily marketable. Conversely, an interest in a private-held company is worth less because no established market exists.Abudy M., Benninga S., and Shust E., (2016). The Cost of Equity for Private Firms, Journal of Corporate Finance 37, 431-443. \\"The IRS Valuation Guide for Income, Estate and Gift Taxes, Valuation Training for Appeals Officers\\" acknowledges the relationship between value and marketability, stating: \\"Investors prefer an asset which is easy to sell, that is, liquid.\\" The discount for lack of control is separate and distinguishable from the discount for lack of marketability. It is the valuation professional's task to quantify the lack of marketability of an interest in a privately held company. Because, in this case, the subject interest is not a controlling interest in the Company, and the owner of that interest cannot compel liquidation to convert the subject interest to cash quickly, and no established market exists on which that interest could be sold, the discount for lack of marketability is appropriate. Several empirical studies have been published that attempt to quantify the discount for lack of marketability. These studies include the restricted stock studies and the pre-IPO studies. Abudy M. and Benninga S., (2016). Valuing Restricted Stock Grants to Non-Executive Employees, Journal of Economics and Business 86, 33-51. The aggregate of these studies indicate average discounts of 35% and 50%, respectively. Some experts believe the Lack of Control and Marketability discounts can aggregate discounts for as much as ninety percent of a Company's fair market value, specifically with family- owned companies. = Restricted stock studies = Restricted stocks are equity securities of public companies that are similar in all respects to the freely traded stocks of those companies except that they carry a restriction that prevents them from being traded on the open market for a certain period of time, which is usually one year (two years prior to 1990). This restriction from active trading, which amounts to a lack of marketability, is the only distinction between the restricted stock and its freely traded counterpart. Restricted stock can be traded in private transactions and usually do so at a discount. The restricted stock studies attempt to verify the difference in price at which the restricted shares trade versus the price at which the same unrestricted securities trade in the open market as of the same date. The underlying data by which these studies arrived at their conclusions has not been made public. Consequently, it is not possible when valuing a particular company to compare the characteristics of that company to the study data. Still, the existence of a marketability discount has been recognized by valuation professionals and the Courts, and the restricted stock studies are frequently cited as empirical evidence. Notably, the lowest average discount reported by these studies was 26% and the highest average discount was 40%. = Option pricing = In addition to the restricted stock studies, U.S. publicly traded companies are able to sell stock to offshore investors (SEC Regulation S, enacted in 1990) without registering the shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The offshore buyers may resell these shares in the United States, still without having to register the shares, after holding them for just 40 days. Typically, these shares are sold for 20% to 30% below the publicly traded share price. Some of these transactions have been reported with discounts of more than 30%, resulting from the lack of marketability. These discounts are similar to the marketability discounts inferred from the restricted and pre-IPO studies, despite the holding period being just 40 days. Studies based on the prices paid for options have also confirmed similar discounts. If one holds restricted stock and purchases an option to sell that stock at the market price (a put), the holder has, in effect, purchased marketability for the shares. The price of the put is equal to the marketability discount. The range of marketability discounts derived by this study was 32% to 49%. However, ascribing the entire value of a put option to marketability is misleading, because the primary source of put value comes from the downside price protection. A correct economic analysis would use deeply in-the-money puts or Single-stock futures, demonstrating that marketability of restricted stock is of low value because it is easy to hedge using unrestricted stock or futures trades. = Pre-IPO studies = Another approach to measure the marketability discount is to compare the prices of stock offered in initial public offerings (IPOs) to transactions in the same company's stocks prior to the IPO. Companies that are going public are required to disclose all transactions in their stocks for a period of three years prior to the IPO. The pre-IPO studies are the leading alternative to the restricted stock stocks in quantifying the marketability discount. The pre-IPO studies are sometimes criticized because the sample size is relatively small, the pre-IPO transactions may not be arm's length, and the financial structure and product lines of the studied companies may have changed during the three year pre-IPO window.  Applying the studies  The studies confirm what the marketplace knows intuitively: Investors covet liquidity and loathe obstacles that impair liquidity. Prudent investors buy illiquid investments only when there is a sufficient discount in the price to increase the rate of return to a level which brings risk-reward back into balance. The referenced studies establish a reasonable range of valuation discounts from the mid-30%s to the low 50%s. The more recent studies appeared to yield a more conservative range of discounts than older studies, which may have suffered from smaller sample sizes. Another method of quantifying the lack of marketability discount is the Quantifying Marketability Discounts Model (QMDM).  Estimates of business value  The evidence on the market value of specific businesses varies widely, largely depending on reported market transactions in the equity of the firm. A fraction of businesses are \\"publicly traded,\\" meaning that their equity can be purchased and sold by investors in stock markets available to the general public. Publicly traded companies on major stock markets have an easily calculated \\"market capitalization\\" that is a direct estimate of the market value of the firm's equity. Some publicly traded firms have relatively few recorded trades (including many firms traded \\"over the counter\\" or in \\"pink sheets\\"). A far larger number of firms are privately held. Normally, equity interests in these firms (which include corporations, partnerships, limited-liability companies, and some other organizational forms) are traded privately, and often irregularly. As a result, previous transactions provide limited evidence as to the current value of a private company primarily because business value changes over time, and the share price is associated with considerable uncertainty due to limited market exposure and high transaction costs. A number of stock market indicators in the United States and other countries provide an indication of the market value of publicly traded firms. The Survey of Consumer Finance in the US also includes an estimate of household ownership of stocks, including indirect ownership through mutual funds.Bucks, Kennickell, Mach, & Moore, \\"Changes in US Family Finances from 2004 to 2007: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances,\\" Federal Reserve Bulletin, February 2009 The 2004 and 2007 SCF indicate a growing trend in stock ownership, with 51% of households indicating a direct or indirect ownership of stocks, with the majority of those respondents indicating indirect ownership through mutual funds. Few indications are available on the value of privately held firms. Anderson (2009) recently estimated the market value of U.S. privately held and publicly traded firms, using Internal Revenue Service and SCF data.Anderson, Patrick L., \\"Value of Private Businesses in the United States,\\" Business Economics (2009) 44, 87–108. He estimates that privately held firms produced more income for investors, and had more value than publicly held firms, in 2004.

Deenick (ed), Reformed Churches Publishing House, Geelong (Vic) 1991.*Religious Bodies in Australia: A Comprehensive Guide (3rd ed) by Rowland Ward and Robert Humphreys, New Melbourne Press, Melbourne (Vic) 1995. The denomination is part of the worldwide family of reformed churches which came into being at the time of the Reformation, and declared themselves reformed from the teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church at that time. Whereas Martin Luther was the champion of the Reformation in Germany, John Calvin was the champion of the Reformation in Switzerland, the Netherlands and northern Europe. It is John Calvin's understanding of the Bible, as spelled out in his Institutes of the Christian Religion, that forms the doctrinal basis of the various reformed churches. This doctrinal basis is further summarized in the three Confessions to which the continental reformed churches adhere: * Belgic Confession * Heidelberg Catechism * Canons of Dordt And by the Confession to which the Presbyterian churches adhere: * Westminster Confession History This denomination was established by post-World War II Dutch migrants in 1951. Many of the migrants had been members of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands. They had no desire to start new congregations in their new home, and had been advised to seek the pastoral care of the Scottish Free Presbyterians (i.e. the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia) upon their arrival in Australia. The differences between the culture of the Australian-Scottish Presbyterians and the Reformed Netherlanders was a hindrance, but the real problem was the liturgical restrictions where no instrumental accompaniment was allowed and only psalms were sung. The Dutch migrants struggled to find churches in Australia which embraced and upheld Biblical and Reformed theology, with a national profile that could enfold these new settlers, and was governed according to reformed tradition. For these reasons, in December 1951, they organised a separate denomination, initially composed of Reformed Churches in Sydney, Penguin and Melbourne. The new denomination held their first Synod in June 1952 in premises owned by the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia at East St Kilda. By 1955, some dozen congregations were formed in all Australian states, and the denomination, then named the Reformed Churches of Australia, grew to around 10,500 by the early 1990s, when it was renamed the Christian Reformed Churches Of Australia. Currently there is an active membership of around 7800 in over fifty churches spread throughout Australia. This steady decline is due to a desire to assimilate in their new country, welcome changes in the Anglican and Presbyterian Churches in some states bringing these denominations theologically closer, and certain aspects of generational change. Numerous South African immigrants in the last decade have slowed this trend, as have converts from other denominations. From exclusively Dutch beginnings, the CRCA is now a culturally diverse group, reflecting the character of Australian society, and is seeking to proclaim the Christian message in a contemporary and relevant way. The denomination has been instrumental in the establishment of many Christian schools, including the Illawarra Christian School, Sutherland Shire Christian School, Tyndale Christian School (New South Wales), Calvin Christian School Kingston Tasmania, and Covenant College (ACT). It is actively engaged in Christian missions both within Australia and abroad. One of these is The NSW THING. They have established their own theological college, the Reformed Theological College in Geelong, Victoria. They also own Wedderburn Christian Campsite, a Christian camp site in the outskirts of Sydney. They also support SWIM Solomon Islands, which is a missionary outreach in the Solomon Islands. The CRCA also produces a denominational magazine titled \\"Trowel And Sword\\" Since 2000, the CRCA has adopted a fourfold mission statement to remind and empower its member churches to set and focus on their primary goal of equipping God's people for the service of God both within and beyond itself. The four tasks are headed: Pray, Multiply, Train and Align. Structure The basic unit is the local church, which is governed by the local session as \\"elected\\" While this \\"election\\" is a democratic process, it is guided by the session for advice of the session, not as prescriptive of the session. by the congregation. All sessions within a geographical area (typically on a statewide basis) meet every 3-4 months as a classis. Nationally, delegates meet every three years as a Synod. The synod deals only with issues raised by a classis. Therefore, all synodical issues were originally raised by a session, brought to a classis, before coming to the synod. At synod, policies for the church are formulated, directions considered, and new ways forward explored. In between synodical meetings the financial commitments of the member churches are administered by a Synodical Board of Management, while all other matters affecting the church as a whole are looked after by the Synodical Interim Committee. Permanent committees of synod include: * World Transform: Distributes funds collected for overseas relief work * Solomons Islands Workgroup: Workgroup supporting the missionary work carried out in the Solomon Islands. Notable members Senator Eric Abetz is a member of the Kingston Christian Reformed Church .

He is currently employed by the professional wrestling promotion WWE as a creative consultant and producer. He is the inaugural WWE Intercontinental Champion and creator of the Royal Rumble match, Patterson was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 1996. In 2019, Patterson became the oldest person to ever win a title in WWE history, after winning the WWE 24/7 Championship at 78 years old. He has been described by journalist Dave Meltzer as \\"Vince McMahon's right-hand man\\" and \\"one of the chief architects of the WWE, playing an integral role in helping it become a global phenomenon.\\"  Early life  Patterson was born into an impoverished French-speaking family in the Ville-Marie arrondissement of Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1941. He began training to wrestle at the age of 14 at Loisirs Saint Jean Baptiste. Patterson was raised Roman Catholic, and was an altar boy. He expressed an interest to a priest in becoming one himself, but was advised it would not have worked, because he was \\"too adventurous\\".  Professional wrestling career = Early career (1958–1962)  Patterson debuted in Montreal, Quebec in 1958, wrestling at the Palais des Sports for promoter Sylvio Samson. Early in his career, he performed as \\"Killer\\" Pat Patterson.  Big Time Wrestling (1962)  In 1962, Patterson - despite speaking no English - emigrated to the United States to pursue his professional wrestling career. He eventually became a U.S. citizen. Patterson initially worked for Tony Santos's Big Time Wrestling promotion in Boston, Massachusetts. While living and working in Boston, Patterson met his long-term partner, Louie Dondero.  Pacific Northwest Wrestling (1962–1965)  In 1962, Patterson was recruited by Mad Dog Vachon for Don Owen's Portland, Oregon-based Pacific Northwest Wrestling promotion. At the encouragement of PNW promoter Harry Elliot, who was aware of Patterson's homosexuality, Patterson developed the character of \\"Pretty Boy\\" Pat Patterson, an effeminate wrestler who wore lipstick, sunglasses, and a beret and carried a cigarette holder. In 1963, Patterson wrestled for promotions in Texas, Arizona and Oklahoma as part of a talent exchange organized by Owen. Patterson returned to Pacific Northwest Wrestling in 1964. He held the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship on two occasions that year. On October 2, 1964, Patterson defeated Pepper Martin for the NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship. He held the championship for six weeks before losing to Martin. Patterson won the championship again in 1965 and 1966.  Big Time Wrestling (San Francisco) (1965–1977)  In January 1965, Patterson was hired by Roy Shire for his San Francisco, California-based Big Time Wrestling promotion. At Shire's request, Patterson dyed his hair blond to form a tag team with Ray Stevens, The Blond Bombers. The duo won the NWA World Tag Team Championship in 1965 and again in 1967. The Blonde Bombers were described by Bret Hart as \\"considered by many to be the best tag team of the 1970s\\". In 1968, Patterson wrestled for NWA Western States Wrestling in Amarillo, Texas as Lord Patrick Patterson, winning the NWA North American Heavyweight Championship and NWA Brass Knuckles Championship. In the same year, he undertook a six-week tour of Japan, facing Antonio Inoki in a series of bouts. After Stevens turned face in the late 1960s, he had a feud with the heel Patterson, culminating in the 1970s Texas Death match, in which Stevens won the title from Patterson. In 1970 and 1971, Patterson wore a mask during his matches, and would cheat by placing a foreign object under the mask to add power to his headbutts. In 1972, Patterson turned face again, after feuding with Lars Anderson, who was managed by Dr. Ken Ramey. Later that year, he teamed with Rocky Johnson and won the tag team championship. In 1975 and 1981, Patterson won the Cow Palace Battle Royal in San Francisco.  Championship Wrestling from Florida (1977)  In 1977, Patterson wrestled for Eddie Graham's Tampa, Florida-based Championship Wrestling from Florida promotion. During his run, he won the NWA Florida Television Championship and the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship, as well as briefly serving as booker.  American Wrestling Association (1978–1983)  In 1978, Patterson joined Verne Gagne's Minneapolis, Minnesota-based American Wrestling Association. He reformed The Blond Bombers with Ray Stevens, with the duo winning the AWA World Tag Team Championship later that year. Patterson performed intermittently for the AWA until 1983.  New Japan Pro Wrestling (1979)  In 1979, Patterson toured Japan with New Japan Pro Wrestling.  Lutte Internationale (1980–1983)  Patterson made his professional return to Quebec in 1980, wrestling a number of bouts for the Montreal, Quebec-based Lutte Internationale promotion. He held the Canadian International Tag Team Championship on five occasions between 1980 and 1983.  World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment / WWE (1979 – present) North American Champion (1979) = In 1979, Patterson debuted in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), working as a heel, under the tutelage of manager The Grand Wizard. As a villain, Patterson's primary feuds were with then WWF North American Champion Ted DiBiase and WWF Heavyweight Champion Bob Backlund. During a television taping on June 19 in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Patterson defeated DiBiase for the WWF North American Championship by using a pair of brass knuckles to knock out DiBiase. Patterson was unsuccessful, however, in winning the WWF Heavyweight Championship from Backlund. = Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion and retirement (1979–1984) = In September 1979, the WWE would introduce the WWE Intercontinental Championship, a secondary championship for its midcard wrestlers. Patterson was crowned the company's first Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion after an alleged tournament held in Rio de Janeiro. While Patterson's tournament \\"victory\\" is widely listed in wrestling title and match histories, the tournament itself never actually took place. Patterson's apocryphal title victory would later become something of an inside joke during Patterson's on-screen tenure as one of Vince McMahon's \\"stooges\\". The fictional tournament was also later profiled in-depth on WWE.com as an April Fool's joke. On November 8, Patterson dropped the North American title to Seiji Sakaguchi. It was during Patterson's reign as champion that he turned face, after a botched attempt by the Grand Wizard to \\"sell\\" Patterson's contract to \\"Captain\\" Lou Albano for $100,000; Albano's protégés, the Wild Samoans, attacked Patterson after he cut a promo insulting Albano. Patterson held the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship until April 21, 1980 when he was defeated by Ken Patera in New York City, New York. The match ended in controversial fashion after Patterson placed his right leg on the ropes just before the three count was made. On May 4, 1981, Patterson's feud with Sgt. Slaughter culminated in a Bootcamp match in Madison Square Garden. The match was voted Match of the Year by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. = Backstage roles (1984–1997) = Patterson began doing color commentary in 1980 with Vince McMahon, calling WWF Championship Wrestling from 1980-84. While Patterson was a face commentator when partnered with Gorilla Monsoon and Vince McMahon, he hosted a heel interview segment for French WWF broadcasts known as \\"Le brunch de Pat\\", where he would politely ask questions in English but furtively mock his face guests in French. Patterson was on commentary with Monsoon when Hulk Hogan defeated The Iron Sheik for the world heavyweight championship, as well as for when Sheik defeated Bob Backlund. Patterson was also calling the action when Jimmy Snuka jumped off the steel cage and splashed Don Muraco in Madison Square Garden in 1983. Patterson retired from wrestling in 1984. Although retired, Patterson continued to occasionally wrestle. On January 26, 1985 he wrestled Nikolai Volkoff in a losing effort in a house show in Cincinnati, OH.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/85.htm The following month he teamed with Andre the Giant at a pair of house shows in Canada and defeated Ken Patera and Big John Studd. He took the spot of Mad Dog Vachon on the WWF skit show Le brunch on WWF Superstars in Canada till late summer 1987, then several wrestlers like the Rougeau Bros and Dino Bravo replace him, and then Frenchie Martin hosted LE Studio as a replacement of Le Brunch. Before that he made another appearance, this time in a battle royal in Montreal on February 24, 1987. He also appeared in a battle royal at a house show in Buffalo, NY on December 27. Patterson made a handful of additional appearances in Montreal in 1987, wrestling as a heel (while remaining a face or neutral backstage official in the United States and elsewhere in Canada). His most notable appearance was a win over the up-and-coming Brutus Beefcake on August 10http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm His final match would come three weeks later in Montreal as he fell in defeat to Beefcake. and he got a haircut. He began working backstage as a road agent and right-hand man to WWF promoter Vince McMahon, and is credited with inventing and booking the Royal Rumble match. In the late 1990s, he also worked in the talent-relations department. After his retirement, Patterson also worked as a WWF referee. He was selected as the in-ring referee for the main event at the first ever WrestleMania at Madison Square Garden on March 31, 1985, a well as the main event of WrestleMania XI. In 1992, Patterson was accused of sexual harassment by former announcer Murray Hodgson. He was briefly released from the company until the charges were dropped, when he was promptly rehired. = \\"Stooge\\" (1997–2000) = In 1997, Patterson, along with Gerald Brisco, became comedy heels as the on-screen stooges of Vince McMahon, assisting their boss in his rivalries with Stone Cold Steve Austin, Mankind and The Rock. Patterson and Brisco were among the founding members of The Corporation. In order to mock Hulk Hogan, they used \\"Real American\\" as their entrance music and parodied Hogan's flexing routine as they approached the ring. on the May 18, 1998 episode of Raw, Patterson and Brisco competed in a 2 on 1 Street Fight against Stone Cold that ended in a no contest when Vince Mcmahon and Dude Love attacked Stone Cold. Later in 1999, the two became entangled with the McMahon- Helmsley Faction. On the December 16, 1999 episode of SmackDown, Patterson and Brisco helped Test, who had been injured by D-Generation X. Triple H and Stephanie McMahon then forced Patterson and Brisco to compete for the WWF Tag Team Championship against The New Age Outlaws or be fired. Patterson and Brisco lost the match. In 2000, Patterson and Brisco joined Triple and Stephanie. On the May 8 episode of Raw, Patterson, Road Dogg and X-Pac faced Rikishi in a 3 on 1 handicap match and were disqualified after Patterson hit Rikishi with a chair. Afterwards, Patterson lowered his drawers to deliver a Stink Face to Rikishi with stained underwear, which commentator Jim Ross described as a \\"tractor-sized skidmark\\". On June 12, 2000, when the Faction unmasked Kane, Patterson photographed Kane's \\"hideously scarred\\" face, and threatened to \\"expose him to the world\\" if he did not comply. Kane was forced to wrestle The Rock (then his ally) in a No Holds Barred match. When Patterson's film did not develop properly, Kane turned on the Faction. On June 19, 2000 Patterson helped Brisco win the perpetually contested WWF Hardcore Champion from Crash Holly but during the victory celebration turned on his ally, blinding him with champagne and then breaking a second bottle over Brisco's head, and pinning the (kayfabe) unconscious champion. Brisco pursued Patterson into the women's locker room, where Patterson was hiding in drag. Subsequently, Vince McMahon scheduled them to fight over Hardcore Championship in an Evening Gown match at King of the Ring 2000; in the course of the match, Crash Holly attacked both men and pinned Patterson to become Hardcore Champion. On the June 21 episode of Raw, Patterson and Brisco's match with Shane and Vince Mcmahon ended in a no contest when The Mean Street Posse ran in and attacked them. = Backstage roles (2000–2004, 2005–present) = The Intercontinental Championship, unified with the World Heavyweight Championship on October 20, 2002, was resurrected on May 18, 2003 at Judgment Day in a battle royal. Patterson, as the first ever Intercontinental Champion, was at ringside to present the belt to the victor. Booker T eliminated Christian for the win, but the referee was unconscious. As Patterson attempted to give the championship belt to Booker T, Christian attacked him, stole the Intercontinental Championship belt and used it to knock out Booker T. The referee then recovered and awarded the match to Christian. In October 2004, Patterson retired from World Wrestling Entertainment. Patterson returned to WWE in a limited capacity in May 2005. While he is now retired as a producer for WWE, he still acts as a creative consultant. At Breaking Point, Patterson made an appearance in his hometown of Montreal in an in-ring segment with Dolph Ziggler. Patterson was a regular cast member on the WWE Network original reality show Legends' House. On July 22, 2019, during the Raw Reunion episode, Patterson won the WWE 24/7 Championship by pinning Drake Maverick backstage. He would lose the title to Gerald Brisco off-screen later that same night. At 78 years old, he became the oldest person ever to win a title in WWE history, beating The Fabulous Moolah's fourth reign with the original WWF Women's Championship at 76 years old. It was also Patterson's first title reign since June 19, 2000, with the similarly introduced WWF Hardcore Championship, which also uses the \\"24/7 rule\\". He was only the second person ever to win both the 24/7 and Hardcore Championships.  Personal life  Patterson is openly gay. He first came out in the early 1970s, and although Jim Ross made several jokes about it on commentary, his sexuality was not acknowledged publicly or in WWE storylines until the season finale of WWE Legends' House, which aired June 12, 2014. His longtime partner was Louie Dondero. Patterson stated on WWE Legends' House that they were together for 40 years and that Dondero died of a heart attack on June 28, 1998, the same night as King of the Ring 1998. In August 2006, Patterson underwent emergency heart surgery to remove a cyst from his coronary artery. In October, Patterson recovered from his operation and was released from the hospital. He legally changed his name to Pat Patterson in 2008.

These are diamagnetic solids featuring octahedral Rh(III) centres. Depending on the value of n, the material is either a dense brown solid or a soluble reddish salt. The soluble trihydrated (n = 3) salt is widely used to prepare compounds used in homogeneous catalysis, notably for the industrial production of acetic acid and hydroformylation. Structures Aqueous solutions of RhCl3(H2O)3 have been characterized by 103Rh NMR spectroscopy, which shows the presence of several species. The proportions of which change with time and depend on the concentration of chloride. The relative distribution of these species determines the colour of the solutions, which can range from yellow (the hexaaquo ion) to \\"raspberry-red\\". Some of these species are [Rh(H2O)6]3+, [RhCl(H2O)5]2+, cis- and trans-[RhCl2(H2O)4]+, and [RhCl3(H2O)3]. Individual ions have been separated by ion exchange chromatography. Anhydrous rhodium chloride crystallises in the YCl3 and AlCl3 motif (see image in upper right). The metal centres are octahedral, and the halides are doubly bridging. It is a dense brown solid that is insoluble in common solvents and of little value in the laboratory. Preparation RhCl3(H2O)3 is produced from salts such as Na3RhCl6, the latter being obtained in the purification of rhodium from the other platinum group metals such as platinum and iridium. The sodium salt is converted to H3RhCl6 by ion exchange chromatography. Recrystallization of this acidic salt from water affords the hydrated trichloride, sometimes called \\"soluble rhodium trichloride.\\" Anhydrous RhCl3 is prepared by reaction of chlorine with rhodium sponge metal at 200–300 °C. Above 800 °C, the anhydrous chloride reverts to Rh metal and chlorine. Various rhodium chloride complexes are intermediates in the purification of rhodium from its ores. Coordination complexes RhCl3(H2O)3 is the precursor to a wide variety of complexes, some of which are commercially useful. It reacts with acetylacetone to give rhodium acetylacetonate. Amines and pyridine Solutions of RhCl3(H2O)3 react with ammonia in the presence of alcohol to give the salt pentamminerhodium chloride, [RhCl(NH3)5]Cl2. Zinc reduction of this cation followed by the addition of sulfate gives the colourless hydride complex [HRh(NH3)5]SO4. Upon boiling in a mixture of ethanol and pyridine (py), hydrated rhodium trichloride converts to trans-[RhCl2(py)4)]Cl. In the absence of a reductant, the reaction affords fac-[RhCl3(py)3], analogous to the thioether derivatives. Oxidation of aqueous ethanolic solution of pyridine and RhCl3(H2O)3 by air affords a blue paramagnetic oxygen-bridged compound, Thioethers and tertiary phosphines Ethanolic solutions of hydrated rhodium trichloride react with dialkyl sulfides. :RhCl3(H2O)3 \\\\+ 3 SR2 ->[\\\\ce{CH3CH2OH}] RhCl3(SR2)3 \\\\+ 3 H2O Both fac and mer stereoisomers of such compounds have been isolated. Reaction of RhCl3(H2O)3 under mild conditions with tertiary phosphines affords adducts akin to the aforementioned thioether complexes. When these reactions are conducted in boiling ethanol solution, reduction of rhodium(III) occurs, leading to rhodium(I) derivatives such as [RhCl(PPh3)3], Wilkinson's catalyst, with oxidation of the solvent or more commonly with an excess of the phosphine: ::RhCl3(H2O)3 \\\\+ 3 PPh3 \\\\+ CH3CH2OH ->[\\\\ce{CH3CH2OH} \\\\text{ / Δ}] RhCl(PPh3)3 \\\\+ CH3CHO \\\\+ 2 HCl \\\\+ 3 H2O ::RhCl3(H2O)3 \\\\+ 4 PPh3 ->[\\\\ce{CH3CH2OH} \\\\text{ / Δ}] RhCl(PPh3)3 \\\\+ OPPh3 \\\\+ 2 HCl \\\\+ 2 H2O Alkenes and carbon monoxide Reaction of RhCl3(H2O)3 with olefins affords compounds of the type Rh2Cl2(alkene)4. With 1,5-cyclooctadiene, RhCl3(H2O)3 react in ethanol to give cyclooctadiene rhodium chloride dimer. Structure of the cyclooctadiene rhodium chloride dimer RhCl3(H2O)3 in methanol reacts with carbon monoxide (1 bar) to produce H[RhCl2(CO)2], which contains the dicarbonyldichloridorhodate(I) anion; further carbonylation in the presence of sodium citrate leads to the formation of tetrarhodium dodecacarbonyl, Rh4(CO)12, a rhodium(0) cluster compound. Treatment of solid RhCl3(H2O)3 with flowing CO gives the dimeric rhodium(I) compoundrhodium carbonyl chloride, [(CO)2Rh(μ-Cl)]2. Numerous Rh- CO-PR3 (R = organic group) compounds have been prepared in the course of extensive investigations on hydroformylation catalysis. RhCl(PPh3)3 reacts with CO to give trans-RhCl(CO)(PPh3)2, stoichiometrically analogous to but less reactive than Vaska's complex. Trans-RhCl(CO)(PPh3)2 reacts with a mixture of NaBH4 and PPh3 to give HRh(CO)(PPh3)3, a highly active catalyst for hydroformylation of alkenes. When treated with cyclopentadienes or its derivatives, organometallic half sandwich compounds can be produced. For example, reacting the trihydrate with pentamethylcyclopentadiene (Cp*H) in hot methanol leads to the precipitation of the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl rhodium dichloride dimer, [Cp*RhCl2]2: :2 Cp*H \\\\+ 2 RhCl3(H2O)3 ->[\\\\ce{CH3OH} \\\\text{ / Δ}] [Cp*RhCl2]2 \\\\+ 2 HCl \\\\+ 6 H2O This compound was first prepared from hexamethyl Dewar benzene and RhCl3(H2O)3. The hydrohalic acid necessary for the ring-contraction rearrangement is generated in situ in methanolic solutions of the rhodium salt, and the second step has been carried out separately, confirming this mechanistic description. The reaction occurs with the formation of 1,1-dimethoxyethane, CH3CH(OCH3)2, and hexamethylbenzene is produce by a side reaction. This rhodium(III) dimer can be reduced with zinc in the presence of CO to produce the rhodium(I) complex [Cp*Rh(CO)2]. Synthesis of the rhodium(III) dimer [Cp*RhCl2]2 from hexamethyl Dewar benzene Catalysis Beginning especially in the 1960s, RhCl3(H2O)3 was demonstrated to be catalytically active for a variety of reactions involving CO, H2, and alkenes. For example, RhCl3(H2O)3 was shown to dimerise ethene to a mixture of cis and trans 2-butene: :2 C2H4 ->[\\\\ce{RhCl3(H2O)3}] CH3-CH=CH-CH3 Unfortunately this reaction fails for higher alkenes. Ethylene dimerization was shown to involve catalysis by the dimeric rhodium(I) compound [(η2-C2H4)2Rh(μ-Cl)2Rh(η2-C2H4)2]. This and many related discoveries nurtured the then young field of homogeneous catalysis, wherein the catalysts are dissolved in the medium with the substrate. Previous to this era, most metal catalysts were \\"heterogeneous\\", i.e. the catalysts were solids and the substrates were either liquid or gases. Another advance in homogeneous catalysis was the finding that PPh3-derived complexes were active catalytically as well as soluble in organic solvents, the best known such catalyst being Wilkinson's catalyst that catalyzes the hydrogenation and isomerization of alkenes. The hydroformylation of alkenes is catalyzed by the related RhH(CO)(PPh3)3. Catalysis by rhodium is so efficient that it has significantly displaced the previous technology based on less expensive cobalt catalysts. Safety Rhodium(III) chloride is not listed under Annex I of Directive 67/548/EEC, but is usually classified as harmful, R22: Harmful if swallowed. Some Rh compounds have been investigated as anti-cancer drugs. It is listed in the inventory of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).

The generic name is from Greek and means \\"beautiful beard\\", referring to the cluster of hairs adorning the labellum. The five species are native to the eastern United States, eastern Canada, Cuba and the Bahamas.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families The genus Calopogon is abbreviated Cpg in trade journals. Calopogon, like many other orchids, is an indicator species for good remnant hydrology. This means that their presence is an indication of high-quality ground and surface water. Most species of Calopogon frequent wet, sunny swales, bogs, and the edges of marshy areas, and associate with ferns, sedges, grasses and forbs. Calopogon oklahomensis has been observed in drier areas than Calopogon tuberosus would prefer. One distinguishing feature of the grass pinks is that, unlike most orchids, they are non-resupinate. The lip of calopogon is on the top of the flower, not the bottom, as is common with most other genera. The brushy, yellow protuberances on the lip are also designed to attract pollinators, but they only tempt without providing a reward. To add injury to insult, the flower then snaps closed when a potential pollinator lands on it, and the insect has to crawl out of the tight quarters between the lip and the reproductive parts below in order to escape, hopefully pollinating the flower in the process.Flora of North America The other deception they use is their frequent association with nectar-bearing flowers of the same color; Calopogon is often an associate of the magenta marsh phlox, in the northern United States, the phlox bearing nectar to reward curious insects while the deceptive but showy Calopogon does not.

The rebab (, rabāba, variously spelled rebap, rubob, rebeb, rababa, rabeba, robab, rubab, rebob, etc) is the name of several related bowed (but sometimes plucked) string instruments that independently spread via Islamic trading routes over much of North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Europe.The origins of the violin - the rebab, BBC It is one of the earliest known bowed instruments, named no later than the 8th century, and is the parent of many bowed and stringed instruments. There are chiefly 3 main types: A long-necked bowed variety that often has a spike at the bottom to rest on the ground (see first image to the right); thus this is called a spike fiddle in certain areas. Some of the instruments developing from this have vestigial spikes. A short-necked double-chested or \\"boat-shaped\\" variant; here plucked versions like the kabuli rebab (sometimes referred to as the robab or rubab) also exist. Besides the spike fiddle variant, there also exists a variant with a pear-shaped body, quite similar to the Byzantine lyra and the Cretan lyra. This latter variant travelled to western Europe in the 11th century, and became the rebec. This rabāb is the ancestor of all European bowed instruments, including the rebec and the lyra. This article will only concentrate on the spike-fiddle rebab, which usually consists of a small, usually rounded body, the front of which is covered in a membrane such as parchment or sheepskin and has a long neck attached. There is a long thin neck with a pegbox at the end and there are one, two or three strings. There is no fingerboard. The instrument is held upright, either resting on the lap or on the floor. The bow is usually more curved than that of the violin. The rebab, though valued for its voice-like tone, has a very limited range (a little over an octave), and was gradually replaced throughout much of the Arab world by the violin and kemenche. The Iraqi version of the instrument (jawza or joza) has four strings. Construction The rebab is used in a wide variety of musical ensembles and genres, corresponding with its wide distribution, and is built and played somewhat differently in different areas. Following the principle of construction in Iran, the rebab is a large instrument with a range similar to the viola da gamba, whereas versions of the instrument further west tend to be smaller and higher-pitched. The body varies from being ornately carved, as in Java, to simpler models such as the 2-string Egyptian \\"fiddle of the Nile.\\" They may have a body made of half a coconut shell, while the more sophisticated versions have a metal soundbox, and the front may be half- covered with beaten copper, and half with cowskin. Persia, Arabia, Iraq and the Ottomans Bedouin playing a rebab during World War II The rebab was heavily used, and continues to be used, in Arabic Bedouin music and is mentioned by Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in his travelog Travels in Arabia:Music in Mekka The Harmonicon, [Vol. VII, No. 12] (December 1829): 300. > \\"Of instruments they possess only the rababa, (a kind of guitar,) the ney, > (a species of clarinet,) and the tambour, or tambourine.\\" It is called \\"joza\\" in Iraq, named after the sound box material made of a coconut shell. There is also a bowed instrument in Persian music named Kamanche which has similar shape and structure. For a famous Iranian singer and rebab player see Hassaan Egzaar Chenani. Southeast Asia  K.P.H.

Javanese Gamelan, p.30-31. . Two brass strings are tuned a fifth apart and the horse hair bow is tied loosely (unlike modern Western stringed instruments) with the proper tension controlled by the players bow hand, contributing to the difficult technique. There are typically two per ensemble, one for pelog and one for slendro, never played together. The rebab does not have to conform exactly to the scale of the other gamelan instruments and can be played in relatively free time, finishing its phrases after the beat of the gong ageng (the big gong that \\"rules\\" the ensemble, see: colotomy). The rebab also frequently plays the buka when it is part of the ensemble.Neil Sorrell. A Guide to the Gamelan. London: Faber and Faber, 1990. Pp. 97-98.

Altercation of a transcript is considered a felony in most states.  Synonyms  A transcript is sometimes referred to as a marksheet, marklist or report card. In the United States, a transcript is also called Cumulative Record File (CRF), permanent record, or simply record. In the European ECTS system, transcripts are called Transcript of Records (ToR).  United States  In United States education, a transcript is a copy of a student's permanent academic record, which usually means all courses taken, all grades received, all honors received and degrees conferred to a student from the first day of school to the current school year. A transcript may also contain the student’s rank in class and the accreditation of the institution issuing the transcript. An official transcript is prepared and sent by the issuing school usually by the Student Registrar with an original signature of a school official on the school letterhead and is sealed by the school. When students change schools, or seek admission to a college or university, the official transcript is usually mailed from school to school. Transcripts usually consist of grades 9-12 when applying to college.  Holding transcripts  Colleges and universities that are owed money by a former student may \\"hold\\" the transcript until they are paid. This may mean that former student cannot resume their education elsewhere. Many colleges and universities will not allow a prospective student until receiving communication (in the form of a physical stamp or seal) that the prior school is satisfied with its debt collection. If the college or university discovers that an applicant lied on their college application, the college can rescind the offer of admission, can revoke the student's degree, if completed, and refuse the release of that student's transcripts.  European Union  In the European ECTS system, a Transcript of Records (ToR) is used to document the performance of a student over a certain period of time by listing the course units or modules taken, the credits gained, and the grades awarded. The Transcript of Records provides a standard format for recording all study activities carried out by students. It is an essential tool for academic recognition. Directorate-General for Education and Culture: ECTS Users' Guide. European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System and the Diploma Supplement, Brussels, 2005, p. 26; Transcript of Records and Diploma Supplements are a fairly recent development in most European countries. Students who obtained academic degrees in Europe prior to the Bologna Process of 1999 typically will not have received transcripts or diploma supplements and they cannot be produced retroactively for these students. Even today there are still European universities that are not ready to issue Transcripts or Diploma Supplements. Unlike in the US, there does not typically exist in Europe a system of schools directly mailing transcripts to other schools, something that also would be problematic in view of European privacy laws. The ECTS Transcript of Records, created as part of the Bologna Process, preferably includes, along with the local grades, the ECTS grades of the student. It is used for mobile students at two separate moments. First, it must be issued and sent to the host institution by the home institution for all outgoing students before their departure in order to provide information about the course units/modules that they already have completed and the results obtained. Secondly it must be issued and sent by the host institution to the home institution for all incoming students at the end of their period of study.

Sørvágur () is a village on the island of Vágar in the Faroe Islands. It is located at the landward end of Sørvágsfjørður. Sørvágur is the largest village in Sørvágur Municipality. Name The name Sørvágur translates to \\"The Bay of Sør\\". While the second half of the name makes sense given the fact that the village is located at a bay, the first half is more mysterious. Legend has it that the first man to settle at this place was called 'Sørli' and hence the village was named in honour of him. Another explanation on the origin of 'Sør' comes from the old- Norse 'Seyr' which is a word for sand (seyr is also a word for foggy rain). Sørvágur has quite a large sandbeach in comparison with other Faroese villages and towns, and therefore it was speculated that the original name of Sørvágur was Seyrvágur, and during the course of time, Seyrvágur became Sørvágur. During the first half of the 20th century local people in Sørvágur tried to correct this historical injustice and used the name Seyrvágur instead of Sørvágur. However, this trend died out again. One reason may be that there is no proof in the Faroese historical records that justifies the name Seyrvágur. As of today (2005) nobody has come up with at reasonable explanation to the origin of the name Sørvágur. First settlement Sørvágur is considered to be one of the oldest villages in the Faroe Islands. In 1957 the locals decided to build a new school, and during the preparations to build the schools gymnastic hall they excavated an old Viking settlement. Sørvágur – alongside Leirvík, Tjørnuvík and Sandur – is in one of the few places in the Faroe Islands where archaeologists have been able to find substantial proof that these places were built during the first 100-150 years after the Faroese Landnám in 825. Even though the village is old, there is no mention of it, or the island of Vágoy, in the old Faeringa Saga from the thirteenth century. History Sørvágur The eastern part of Sørvágur in snow, Christmas Day 2010. Between the years of 1200 and 1400 the village moved from its first settlements alongside the river Hanusará and further south between the rivers of Stórá and Kirkjuá. Historical records from 17th century show, that the original settlement alongside Hanusará was abandoned, and the village was moved firmly to the new location between the two main rivers in Sørvág. The main reason for this was probably that the weather conditions between the two rivers are far superior to other places in Sørvág. The first written record regarding Sørvág is from 1584. The record shows that there were only three small farms in Sørvág at that time. This coincides very well with the fact, that the land belonging to Sørvág is divided into three parts: Suðurtriðingur, Norðurtriðingur and Úttriðingur. From the 15th century to the late 17th century the Norwegian nobles the Benkenstock family owned all the land in Sørvág. Around 1665 a Dane – Severin Fohrman – bought all the land from the Benkenstock's and immediately started to sell it back to the locals. This meant that almost all the land in Sørvág is private property (óðalsjørð) instead of belonging to the king (kongsjørð). Using the Land Books (jarðarbøkur) it is speculated, that the number of inhabitants in Sørvág in the 17th century was around fifty. In the first census in the Faroes in 1801 the number of inhabitants in Sørvág had risen to a mere 86. In 1855 the number of inhabitants was 163. The reason for this slow progress is due to the special requirements for marriage, that were law in the Faroes. The law said, that in order to marry you would need to own land or have demonstrated that you were a faithful servant to someone who owned land. It was only the wealthy farmers who had a substantial amount of land, and therefore the birthrate in the Faroes was very low until this law was abolished. During the feudal period, it was only the big farmers who had a fishing boat. The first person in the Faroes, who did not own any land, and got his own fishing boat, came from Sørvág. His name was Gamli Dávur. During the Sloop period Sørvágur had many sloops. The church in Sørvágur is from 1886. The first fish factory in the Faroe Islands was built in Sørvágur in 1952. The locals from Sørvágur formed a part of the backbone of fishermen, who went to Greenland to fish. Faroese fishermen were instrumental in teaching the inhabitants of Greenland to do deepsea fishing. In the period 1902-1912, there was a whaling station in the nearby bay of Selvík World War II During World War II Sørvágur was home to the British Royal Engineers, who lived at Uppi á Mýrum. They built all the main infrastructure in Sørvágur including Vágar Airport, the harbour in Sørvág, Niðaraveg (the main road to the harbour) and several bridges. To accomplish this they had to move entire houses to other locations. Geography and landmarks One of the rivers in Sørvágur and one of the bridges One of the mountains around the village. In the foreground is the graveyard; the white building is the public school. Districts (býlingar) in Sørvág: Climate Vágar has colder and snowier winters than most other places in the archipelago. Lower temperatures combined with higher precipitation are responsible for this, and measurable snow cover can be seen- a rarity in the Faroe Islands, in which snow cover (in areas which regularly experience it) is usually limited to a thin coating. The airport, at which data is recorded, is also located at a higher altitude on the island (84 meters above sea level), which might result in lower temperatures and higher precipitation than lower-lying areas on the island. Frost occurs on average on 62 days of the year, the most out of all stations included in the records of the Danish Meteorological Institute.

In older times it was said, that the only thing necessary for survival in Sørvágur was that you had a fishing rod and a pot to cook the fish. The fishing industry also plays a vital role in the industrial environment in Sørvágur today (2005). Today there is a modern fish factory producing mainly salt fish; a fish farm raising salmon; one fish market; one major fish factory ship, which produces fish directly to the British market; 6 smaller fishing trawlers and 50+ small fishing boats. Airport The Vágar Airport is the only airport on the Faroe Islands, and it is located just outside Sørvágur. Many residents of Sørvágur work there. Shops and colonials After the Royal Monopoly trade over the Faroe Islands ended in 1856, everyone was able to start trading on their own. This led to an upsurge in colonial shops opening all over the place. In Sørvágur many colonials were started and one of the leading concerns on the Faroe Islands - Niclasen - was started in Sørvágur. During the transformation of the Faroese society from a feudal to a semi-industrial these concerns played a major role in ensuring labour to the common man. The main colonial in Sørvágur - Norði Stovu handilin - was originally started by the Niclasen concern. The other colonial - Løðuhandilin - was started by the rival concern in Sørvágur - Rasmussen. These two colonials are the only two remaining in Sørvágur today (2005). Norði Stovu handilin is better known under the name Hjá Valdemar and today it also contains a bakery. At the harbour in Sørvágur lies a hardware store - Hjá Niclasen - which also used to form a part of the Niclasen concern. Also placed in the proximity of the harbour lies a Statoil tank station which is run by the Niclasen concern. The tank station also includes a kiosk and grill. Other shops in Sørvágur: *Hjá Sannu - Childrenwear, lingerie and cosmetics. *Gávubúðin Kurvin - Giftshop *Sørvágs ursmiða - Optics *Sørvágs skósøla - Shoestore *Cafe 62°N - Cafe/grill (at Vagar Airport) *Gávubúðin Prýði - Giftshop (at Vagar Airport) Banks The faroese banks Føroya Banki and Eik Banki are present in Sørvágur. There are two automatic teller machines, one at Vágar Airport and the other at Eik Banki. Tourists In close proximity to the airport lies a hotel with restaurant - Hotel Vágar. The hotel is a modern 3 star hotel. During the summer tourist are able to make excursions in boats from Sørvágur . Tourists are also able to make excursions on Sørvágsvatn.

There used to be a chess club called Rókur, but it died out during the 1960s. Religion Religion plays a great role in the day-to-day life in Sørvágur. There are two main buildings – apart from the church – housing two different religious denominations: Libanon houses the Protestant Heimamissiónin, and Kedron houses the Brethren/baptist Brøðrasamkoman.

The station is the 20th stop westbound on the Westside MAX, and the western terminus of the MAX Blue Line route. Opened in 1998, it is located in the same block as the Hillsboro Post Office and adjacent to the Washington County Courthouse and the Hillsboro Civic Center. The block is bounded by First and Adams streets on the east and west and Washington and Main streets on the south and north. The station is named in honor of Mark O. Hatfield, a former United States Senator from Oregon and light rail proponent. History Construction of the Westside MAX project began in 1993. In November 1996, Hillsboro and TriMet named the yet-to-be- completed station at the western end of the project as the Mark O.

Opened in 1998, the red-brick station is the 19th stop westbound on the Westside MAX, one stop from the western terminus of the line. Physically the largest station on the line, it is located at a former stop of the Oregon Electric Railway and includes artwork honoring the history of the community. History Construction of the Westside MAX project began in 1994, while construction on the Hillsboro Central station was completed in August 1998, with a ceremony held on August 13. On September 12, 1998, Hillsboro Central opened along with the Westside MAX line. By 1999, the station was the third busiest on the westside line. In 2000, a plaque honoring former Hillsboro mayor Shirley Huffman's work getting the westside MAX extended from 185th Avenue to downtown Hillsboro was added to the station. Huffman lobbied federal officials to extend the line into downtown Hillsboro, including lecturing the Federal Transit Administration's leader. When Hillsboro Central opened, the Hillsboro Public Library operated a small branch at the station called Books by Rail, which was the only library on the West Coast located at a mass transit station. Because of budget cuts in the library system, the branch was closed in June 2003; in October 2003 TriMet began letting the Hillsboro Police Department use the space for its bicycle patrol. In March 2011, TriMet received a federal grant to pay for the installation of security cameras at the station. Details Located on Southeast Washington Street between Third and Fourth avenues in downtown Hillsboro, the station is decorated with dark red bricks. Overhead is a steep-pitched roof, with the station's floor in the vestibule built of concrete planks in homage to the cedar-planked roads that formerly existed in the town. Designed by the architectural firm OTAK Inc., the station is the largest of the MAX stations on the westside line as it extends most of the length of the block between Third and Fourth avenues. Hillsboro Central sits on the same site of the old Oregon Electric Railway station for the Hillsboro area and has a station building that is designed to look like an old railroad station with features similar to those at a Grand Central Station type of facility. Other features include false chimneys and copper roofing on the main building that serves as the passenger shelter for people waiting for buses or westbound MAX trains. There is also a passenger cover on the single island platform between the two tracks and an additional cover for waiting bus passengers. Hillsboro Central has bike lockers and is handicapped-accessible, but does not have a park-and- ride lot. The station is a hub for bus services in Hillsboro and connections to Cornelius and Forest Grove to the west. This station is served by the following bus lines: 46-North Hillsboro, 47-Main/Evergreen, 48-Cornell, and 57-TV Hwy/Forest Grove. Art A variety of public artwork adorns the brick station. The collective works, entitled Niches, are a montage of the everyday lives of residents. Inspiration and materials for the artwork were collected from the Washington County Museum, the Washington County Fair, and the Oregon Historical Society. Bill Will, Fernanda D'Agostino, Valerie Otani, and Jerry Mayer were the artists responsible for the theme at the station. Items include granite pavers that have memories of past Hillsboro citizens carved into the stone and photographs etched onto glass. Photographs range from pioneer times to life in the 1990s. There are also letters etched in glass from people such as Albert E. Tozier, Robert Summer, Chavela Mendoza, Lester C. Mooberry, Mary Ramsey Wood, George Iwasaki, and Howard Vollum. Gunfights, hangings, funerals, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the Great Depression, and an outbreak of diphtheria in the 1890s are among the events represented. More recent photographs show the defunct Oregon Electric Railway, which the westside line often uses the old right-of-way of the former line, and employees at Intel dressed in cleanroom suits. Also on display is a burden basketBaskets worn like backpacks, used to carry heavy loads. See this exhibit from washington.edu. created by basketmaker Sophie George in the design of the baskets used by the Kalapuya, the Native American tribe that formerly inhabited the Tualatin Valley. As few members of the Kalapuya remain and none had the knowledge of how to make the basket, George visited the British Museum to find an example of a basket in order to design the replica. A bronze cast was created and is displayed at Hillsboro Central. The station also includes a weather vane, one of a series of eight on the Westside MAX. Designed by Keith Jellum and located on the roof of the station building, the vane resembles old train signals. Constructed of bronze, the semaphore signals stop and approach.

It sits below Binah, across from Chesed, and above Hod. Gevurah is \\"the essence of judgment (DIN) and limitation\\", and corresponds to awe and the element of fire. In the Bahir it is written \\"And who are the Officers? We learned that there are three. Strength (Gevurah) is the Officer of all the Holy Forms to the left of the Blessed Holy One. He is Gabriel.\\" Gevurah is associated with the color red. Description Gevurah is the fifth of the ten Sefirot, and second of the emotive attributes in Creation, and which corresponds to the second day of creationKaplan Inner Space 1990: p. 61 (Zohar 2:127b). In the Bahir it says \\"What is the fifth (utterance)? Fifth is the great fire of God, of which it says 'let me see no more of this great fire, lest I die' (Deut 18:16). This is the left hand of God\\".Arthur Green. A Guide to the Zohar. Gevurah is understood as God's mode of punishing the wicked and judging humanity in general. It is the foundation of stringency, absolute adherence to the letter of the law, and strict meting out of justice. This stands in contrast to Chesed. We thus speak of God's primary modes of action as being the kindness and unaccountability of Chesed, versus the stringency and strict accountability of Gevurah. It is called \\"might\\" because of the power of God's absolute judgment. Gevurah is associated in the soul with the power to restrain one's innate urge to bestow goodness upon others, when the recipient of that good is judged to be unworthy and liable to misuse it. As the force which measures and assesses the worthiness of Creation, Gevurah is also referred to in Kabbalah as \\"Midat Hadin\\" (\\"the attribute of judgment\\"). It is the restraining might of Gevurah which allows one to overcome his enemies, be they from without or from within (his evil inclination). The angelic order of this sphere is the Seraphim, ruled by the Archangel Kamael. The opposing Qliphah is represented by the demonic order Golachab, ruled by the Archdemon Asmodeus. Chesed and Gevurah act together to create an inner balance in the soul's approach to the outside world. While the \\"right arm\\" of Chesed operates to draw others near, the \\"left arm\\" of Gevurah reserves the option of repelling those deemed undeserving. (Even towards those to whom one's initial relation is that of \\"the left arm repels\\", one must subsequently apply the complementary principle of \\"the right arm draws near\\".) Ultimately, the might of Gevurah becomes the power and forcefulness to implement one's innate desire of Chesed. Only by the power of Gevurah is Chesed able to penetrate the coarse, opposing surface of reality. The Baal Shem Tov discusses the ability of Gevurah to effect Divine withdrawal (Tzimtzum), which in turn creates the potential for Chesed to occur in creation (commentary to Parshat Toldot). Gevurah appears in the configuration of the Sefirot along the left axis, directly beneath Binah, and corresponds in the tzelem Elokim to the \\"left arm\\". The numerical value of Gevurah, 216, is 6 times 6 times 6. The tablets of the covenant that Moses received at Sinai were 6 by 6 by 3 handbreadths. The Torah was given to Moses and Israel from \\"the Mouth of the Gevurah\\". It is most significant that the name of no other Sefirah is used by our sages to connote God Himself, other than Gevurah (in the Bible, God is referred to as \\"the Netzach [eternity] of Israel\\" (Samuel 1 15:29), but not as Netzach alone). Here, Gevurah implies God's essential power to contract and concentrate His infinite light and strength into the finite letters of Torah (especially those engraved on the tablets of the covenant, the Ten Commandments). Gevurah = 216 = 3 times 72 (chesed). Each of God's 72 hidden names possesses three letters, in all 216 letters. Meaning inheres to words and names. The ultimate \\"meaning\\" of every one of God's Names is His expression of love (Chesed) for His Creation. Each Name expresses His love in a unique way. The components of each word and name, the \\"building blocks\\" of Creation are the letters which combine to form the words. The letters, \\"hewn\\" from the \\"raw material\\" of \\"pro-creation\\" (the secret of the reshimu, the \\"impression\\" of God's infinite light which remains after the initial act of tzimtzum, \\"contraction\\") reflect God's Gevurah. The two hands which act together to form all reality, Chesed (72) plus Gevurah (216) = 288 = 2 times 12 squared. The number of 'Nitzotzot' is 288 \\"fallen sparks\\" (from the primordial cataclysm of \\"the breaking of the vessels\\"), which permeate all of created reality. Through the \\"dual effort\\" of Chesed and Gevurah, not only to form reality, but to rectify reality (through the means of \\"the left arm repels while the right draws near\\"), these fallen sparks are redeemed and elevated to return and unite with their ultimate source. In a universal sense, this is the secret of the coming of Mashiach and the resurrection of the dead. \\"And in Caedmon's time, it became known widely that Gevurah is synonymous with Love, and wise men strove to know Gevurah to build solutions that would keep their fellow men from death.\\" NotesReferences * Bahir, translated by Aryeh Kaplan (1995).

It was hosted by journalist Simon Townsend. Format Each episode of Simon Townsend's Wonder World! featured an introduction by Townsend as the studio host, accompanied by his pet and companion bloodhound Woodrow (Woodrow died in 1986 and was replaced at first with a sulphur-crested cockatoo and then with a baby Labrador retriever. A competition was run amongst the viewers to name the new puppy and as Townsend had recently won a Logie award, the puppy was named Logie). Townsend would then present four individual magazine-style stories, each presented by a different reporter. The stories covered many subjects. Two researchers, two cinematographers, two sound recordists, four reporters and four editors worked on the time equivalent of a feature film every week – about eighty minutes of screen time shot on 16mm reversal film. Stories were not scripted, relying upon the ingenuity of the reporter and the two-person crew. Every show also contained a viewer segment, and a music segment – often produced by the program itself. For instance Simon Townsend's Wonder World! made the first ever music video to feature Australian band INXS. During the course of the series, Townsend and his reporters travelled all over Australia and to many and varied locations in America, the UK, Europe, India, Asia and the Pacific region. Simon Townsend would always end every show with the same signature farewell – \\"And remember, the world really is wonderful!\\" History The program was conceived by Townsend in the early 1970s and was designed to be a fast-moving daily dose of informed entertainment for children, as well as be suitable for and attractive to older teens and adults. Both the Nine and the Seven Networks helped Townsend make pilots for his concept, but neither network bought the series. However, in 1979 when the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal introduced a compulsory 'C' classification (making it a requirement for networks to broadcast only 'C' classified shows between 4pm and 5pm weekdays), Townsend saw the potential and offered the Ten Network, which was searching for a suitable children's program at the time, the opportunity to produce his show. The first episode of Simon Townsend's Wonder World! went to air on 3 September 1979. At first the show was telecast only in the East Coast capital cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Before long other capital cities and regional stations began signing up for the show. By the end of 1980 the show was screening in every TV broadcast region throughout Australia. Soon it became the top-rating program on the Ten Network outside prime time – and sometimes its ratings were better than prime-time programs. For many years the Ten Network ran two episodes of Simon Townsend's Wonder World every weekday because of its ratings power – a repeat show at 4pm followed by a new show at 4.30pm. After more than 2,000 episodes, the show ended in 1987. Theme music Simon Townsend was originally keen to use the 1976 Bill Danoff song Afternoon Delight as the theme song for his afternoon TV show. In fact, this song was used as the opener when the show first went to air. However, when the meaning of the lyrics was pointed out to him, Townsend decided to commission a new and original theme song clearly linked to the eponymous host of the show. As a consequence, Townsend hired Australian songwriter/producer Chris Pelcerhttp://www.chrispelcer.com/index3.php?x=CATALOGTV-THEMES^Wonder-World- Theme-Song'A to write a theme song for Simon Townsend's Wonder World!. John St Peeters sang this original theme. It was arranged and produced by Mike Harvey at EMI Studios Sydney in 1979, and released as a single by RCA that same year. It was simply titled \\"Wonder World!\\" on the record sleeve. In 1983, Simon decided to re-record this theme song. John St Peeters was by then working in the USA, and unavailable; so Simon cast around for a new voice and eventually settled on up-and-coming female singer, Naomi Louise Warne, who went on to achieve international fame as a blues singer, composer and instrumentalist. Warne's voice and style just edged out Edith Bliss, a reporter on Simon Townsend's Wonder World! who had released her own songs, possessed a good voice, and was keen to get the gig. Naomi Warne's version of the theme was recorded in 1983 and again released on a record, and was used on the TV show every weekday afternoon for one season, then a new, upbeat re-recording by John St Peeters was used until Simon's show ended in 1987. Six years later, in 1993, the Nine Network decided to re-launch Simon's show with a new host, Liesl Macdonald, followed by Pascall Fox. The title was shortened to Wonder World!, and again ran every weekday afternoon on Nine for the next three years. It also used the same theme music as the original Simon Townsend's Wonder World! This version was sung by James Morley. At the time, Morley was the Bass Player for \\"The Angels\\". Simon Townsend is still the rights holder to the theme music and the program format. Awards and accolades Simon Townsend's Wonder World! won many awards, including five LOGIE Awards, a TV Star Award and many other trophies, certificates of commendation and popularity prizes. In 1983, Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke presented Simon Townsend with a special – Prime Minister's Award trophy, commemorating the milestone of broadcasting the One Thousandth Episode of Simon Townsend's Wonder World! (as recorded in TV Week, issue of 9 June 1983.) The show still remains the highest rating children's program in Australian TV history. Townsend was always a great supporter of new Australian talents. Simon's company Townsend Entertainments gave many people their first opportunity to prove themselves in the entertainment business. For example, Townsend Entertainments was the first production company in Australia to give a woman, Bronwyn Nicholas, a full-time position as a cinematographer (cinematography having previously been a male domain). Another Wonder World! cinematographer Andrew Lesnie went on to win an Academy Award for his film work. Many others who are now well known in the film and TV industry got their first break thanks to Simon Townsend's Wonder World!. The program's alumni include: Jonathan Coleman, who became a huge star in both Australia and UK, Amanda Keller, who also became a very popular local radio and TV personality, Angela Catterns, who became a radio star, and Edith Bliss, who starred in both advertising and music. Philip Tanner and Maurice Parker became top producers, while Tanner and Brett Clements later made a fortune from board games that were inspired by a Wonder World! story on Crown & Andrews. Fiona Baker created many hit TV shows (like RPA) for the Nine Network and later for other TV networks, after getting her first job as a researcher on Wonder World! straight out of university. Reporters The star reporters on Simon Townsend's Wonder World!, during its seven years on air, included: * Jonathan Coleman * Angela Catterns * Hugh Piper * Sandy Mauger * Edith Bliss * Sheridan Jobbins * Alita Fahey * Maurice Parker * Phillip Tanner * Hugh Munro * Brett Clements * Wednesday Kennedy * Adam Bowen * Carolyn Mee * Malinda Rutter Wonder World! In 1992, two of Simon Townsend's former reporters Phillip Tanner and Brett Clements bought the rights to Simon Townsend's Wonder World and sold the concept to the Nine Network which re-launched the show. The successor's new name was shortened to Wonder World!. The \\"Wonder World!\\" theme song written for the show at Simon Townsend's request by Australian songwriter/producer Chris Pelcer, remained the show's theme until its final episode. Harvey Shore was hired to train new reporters and produce the show once again, this time for the Nine Network. The hosts and reporters of this new series were: * Pascall Fox (famous for her brightly coloured hair, often red or orange. She was later one of the presenters of the Australian version of Ground Force in the early 2000s, and on the Australian version of the show Your Life on the Lawn 2003–2004.) * Jodie Young (who went on to star in Sex/Life, and in 1998 posed nude for Australian Playboy) * Nick Penn (celebrated comedian) * Tony Johnston (who went on to produce many TV shows and to work overseas.) * Liesl Macdonald Later reporters included: * Catriona Rowntree (who became a major star of the Nine Network in Getaway and other series.) * Dave Kelly (who became a famous film editor and producer) * Sonia Kruger (who became a star of the Seven network) * Liesl Macdonald Appearances on the show: * Bill Bovill was \\"Today's Poet\\" and later referred to it on his blog.

It has the common association of \\"Spirituality\\", \\"Balance\\", \\"Integration\\", \\"Beauty\\", \\"Miracles\\", and \\"Compassion\\". Hebrew word Tiferet means \\"glory\\" or \\"splendour\\" in Hebrew. Description In the Bahir it states: \\"Sixth is the adorned, glorious, delightful throne of glory, the house of the world to come. Its place is engraved in wisdom as it says 'God said: Let there be light, and there was light.'\\" Arthur Green. A guide to the Zohar Tiferet is the force that integrates the Sefira of Chesed (\\"compassion\\") and Gevurah (\\"Strength, or Judgment (din)\\"). These two forces are, respectively, expansive (giving) and restrictive (receiving). Either of them without the other could not manifest the flow of Divine energy; they must be balanced in perfect proportion by balancing compassion with discipline. This balance can be seen in the role of Tiferet, wherein the conflicting forces are harmonized, and creation flowers forth. Tiferet also balances Netzach and Hod in a similar manner. In that case Hod can be seen as the intellect where Netzach is seen as emotion. The Names of God associated with Tiferet is Tetragrammaton Eloah Va Daath. The Archangel of this sphere is Raphael. Melachim(kings) is the Angelic order associated with Tiferet, and the planetary/astrological correspondence of Tiferet is the sun. The Qliphah of Tiferet is represented by the demonic order Thagirion, ruled by the Archdemon Belphegor. The symbol associated with this sphere is a majestic King. Tiferet also occupies a place on the middle pillar, and can be seen as a lower reflection of Kether, as well as a higher reflection of Yesod and Malkuth. Tiferet relates to the sun, and as such, it takes a central place in the lower face of the Tree of Life, much in the same manner that the sun is at the center of the solar system. It is not the center of the universe, as one could perhaps argue Kether to be, but rather it is the center of our local astronomical system. Nonetheless, it is the sun that gives light and life, even though it did not create itself. Tiferet can be seen as a metaphor for these same attributes. Tiferet is unique amongst the Sephirot as it is connected to all the other Sephirot (except Malkuth) via the subjective paths, be them conscious or less conscious. Its position down the center between Keter and Yesod indicates to many Kabbalists that it is somewhat of a \\"converting\\" Sephirot between form (Yesod) and force (Keter). In other words, all crossing over the middle path via Tiferet results in a reversed polarity. The law of conservation, valid both for energy and mass, tends to corroborate this – in all cases of energy transmutation, as it may happen in the transmission of gifts and goods from parents to their children, a sacrifice is necessary so a new form may be born. Tiferet is the middle of the tree. Five Sefirot surround it: above are Chesed at the right (south) and Gevurah at the left (north), and below are Netzach at the right, Hod at the left, and Yesod directly below. Together these six are a single entity, Zer Anpin, which is the masculine counterpart of the feminine sefira Malkuth. In certain contexts, Tiferet alone represents all the sefirot of Zer Anpin, so that the entire tree appears with only five sefirot: Keter, Chochmah, Binah, Tiferet, and Malkhut. In both the Jewish and Hermetic trees of life, Tiferet has eight paths, leading (counterclockwise) to Keter (through Daat), Binah, Gevurah, Hod, Yesod, Netsach, Chesed, and Chokmah. Tiferet can be also a variation of the word \\"Tifarah\\" and in Modern Hebrew used in Israel is translated as \\"Glory\\" (from God – \\"Elohim, Adonay) References=Jewish *Bahir, translated by Aryeh Kaplan (1995).

Construction  Originally namesaked Provence and was renamed Rubis on 18 December 1980. Being the lead ship of the class, fine-tuning was long, notably needing over 1000 hours of underwater testing before commissioning. Fielded on December 11, 1976 and launched on July 7, 1979. Active service The Rubis commenced active service on February 23, 1983. In 1985 she evacuated three DGSE agents who sailed to New Zealand on the yacht Ouvéa to participate in the bombing of Rainbow Warrior, then scuttled their yacht. Later in 1991, the Rubis formed part of the French naval contribution to the Gulf War. Between September 1992 and July 1993, Rubis undertook a major refitting which upgraded to the level of the Améthyste. Soon after, on 17 July 1993, the Rubis collided with the tanker Lyria, as the Rubis was surfacing, causing minor damages and injuries. The Rubis also took part in Operation Trident, the 1999 bombing campaign over Yugoslavia, by protecting the aeronaval group. Along with the Améthyste, the boat was one of the two submarines who interdicted the Kotor straits to the Serbian Navy, thus effectively forbidding its use. The boat also gathered information for the coalition. In 2002, the Rubis protected Task Force 473 in the Indian Ocean, during Operation Hercules, the naval part of the invasion of Afghanistan. On 18 July 1996, the fourragère of the Ordre de la Libération was awarded to the submarine and the crew, as a legacy of the Rubis of the Second World War, which had been awarded the medal.

White published in 1970. It tells the story of Louis (pronounced \\"LOO-ee\\" by the author in the audiobook, a reference to trumpeter Louis Armstrong, a point that is made explicit in the book), a trumpeter swan born without a voice who overcomes this difficulty by learning to play a trumpet in order to impress a beautiful swan named Serena. Plot summary In Canada during the spring of 1968, the cob (the name for an adult male swan) and the pen (the name for an adult female swan), both trumpeter swans, build their summer nest on a small island in a pond. The swans are worried when Sam Beaver, an 11-year-old boy on a camping trip with his father, begins coming to the lake every day to watch them; the cob believes that human boys are dangerous. One day while the pen steps away from her eggs to stretch her legs, a fox slips up behind her. Sam chases the fox away, saving both the female and her eggs. After this incident, the swans begin to trust him. After the hatching of their cygnets, the cob proudly leads his brood to Sam to introduce them. The cygnets each chirp at Sam in greeting, except for the youngest who is named Louis and is unable to chirp but pulls Sam's shoelace instead. The adult swans gradually realize that Louis is mute. The adults grow increasingly concerned about Louis, worrying that he will not be able to find a mate if he cannot trumpet like all the other swans. Louis's father promises to find a way for him to communicate. At the end of summer, the swan family flies to the winter refuge, Red Rock Lakes in Montana. Louis decides he should learn to read and write in order to communicate, and flies away from the refuge to visit Sam Beaver. Sam takes his swan friend to school with him the next morning. Louis turns out to be a natural at reading and writing, and Sam buys him a portable blackboard and chalk so he can communicate. Unfortunately, because the other swans cannot read, Louis is still lonely. When Louis returns to the Red Rock Lakes, he falls in love with a young swan, Serena, but cannot attract her attention. Louis's father is aware that trumpeter swans are named after the human musical instrument and becomes determined to acquire a trumpet as a substitute \\"voice\\" for Louis. The cob crashes through the window of a music store in Billings, Montana and steals a brass trumpet on a cord. By the time Louis learns to effectively play the trumpet, Serena has migrated north. Instead of accompanying his family north where he might have to face Serena again, Louis visits Sam on his ranch and explains that he feels guilty about the stolen trumpet. Sam suggests that Louis should get a job so he can pay the store for the trumpet and the damaged window. He helps Louis find a position as camp bugler at Camp Kookooskoos, the boys' camp Sam attends. Louis convinces Sam to split one of his webbed feet with a razor blade, making \\"fingers\\" so that he can play more notes. Over the course of the summer, Louis plays taps, reveille, and mess call, and composes a love song for Serena. He also receives a Lifesaving Medal for rescuing a drowning camper. At the end of the summer, he has earned $100, which he carries in a waterproof pouch around his neck along with his slate, chalk, medal, and trumpet. Sam suggests that Louis can get a job with the Swan Boats in Boston. Louis flies across country and becomes an instant success, with a salary of $100 per week and a private suite in the Ritz Hotel. A Philadelphia nightclub offers Louis a higher salary, $500 per week. He leaves Boston and takes up temporary residence at the Philadelphia Zoo. The zookeeper promises that because Louis is only a guest, he will not be pinioned (have a wing tip cut off to prevent escape) like all the other swans at the zoo. One stormy night, Serena, blown off course, falls into the Zoo's Bird Lake. Louis serenades her by playing \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\" on his trumpet, and she falls in love with him, impressed by his song and the numerous possessions hanging around his neck. When the zookeepers spot Serena, they try to clip her wings, and Louis attacks them. He convinces the Head Man to postpone the operation for a short while and sends a telegram to Sam, asking for help. Sam goes to Philadelphia and strikes a deal with the Head Man: in every clutch of cygnets, there is always one that needs special care, just as Louis did in his own family. If the Head Man will let Louis and Serena go free, they will donate one of their cygnets to the zoo every year. Louis and Serena fly back to the Red Rock Lakes. Now intending to live the rest of his life among other swans, he no longer needs his slate. Louis writes an apology on the slate and gives it and the money bag to his father, who flies back to the music store in Billings. Afraid that the swan will destroy another window, the storekeeper shoots the cob in the shoulder, but is amazed to find the note and the money, which amounts to several times the cost of both the stolen trumpet and the window. Because the cob is a protected species, he is taken to a wildlife veterinarian, where his injury is treated. When he is recovered, he flies back to the Red Rock Lakes to rejoin his family, including Louis and Serena. Many years later, when Sam is about 20 years old, he is again camping in Canada when he hears the sound of a trumpet playing across the lake and knows it must be Louis. He writes in his journal: \\"Tonight I heard Louis's horn. My father heard it, too. The wind was right, and I could hear the notes of taps, just as darkness fell. There is nothing in all the world I like better than the trumpet of the swan.\\" Reception The book received a strongly positive review by John Updike in The New York Times, in which he said \\"While not quite so sprightly as Stuart Little, and less rich in personalities and incident than Charlotte's Web -- that paean to barnyard life by a city humorist turned farmer -- The Trumpet of the Swan has superior qualities of its own; it is the most spacious and serene of the three, the one most imbued with the author's sense of the precious instinctual heritage represented by wild nature\\"\\"The Trumpet of the Swan,\\" John Updike, The New York Times Book Review, June 28, 1970 Adaptations Because of its success, The Trumpet of the Swan had a few adaptations. Audiobook An unabridged reading of the book by author White was once audio recorded and has since been published as an audiobook. Philadelphia Orchestra piece In 1972, a piece by composer Benjamin Lees based on The Trumpet of the Swan was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra (an orchestra with which Louis is mentioned as giving a guest performance). Film An animated film of the book was made in 2001 by Rich Animation Studios, released by Nest Family Entertainment and distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment under the TriStar Pictures label. Novel symphony A \\"novel symphony for actors and orchestra\\" was adapted from the book in 2011 by Marsha Norman with music composed and conducted by Jason Robert Brown. The production starred John Lithgow, Kathy Bates, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Mandy Moore, James Naughton, and Martin Short. The production has been published on CD and by direct download.

In May 2000, she made three more televised appearances in the WWF as one of The Godfather's hos, briefly winning the Hardcore Championship from Crash Holly. Holly quickly pinned her to regain the title. When the WWF dropped MCW as one of their developmental territories in December 2000, she (along with some of the others training there) was released from her contract. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002) In the summer of 2002, she worked briefly for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as David Young's valet. Independent circuit (2002–present) Afterward, she returned to working for several other independent feds on the east coast, including Glory, GLOOW/DWOW, WEW, among others. On July 12, 2007, Lynch, as Principal Lazarus teamed with Roni Jonah to capture the Women's Extreme Wrestling Tag Team Championship against Annie Social and Amy Zidian (substituting for Sumie Sakai). On December 14, 2007 Lazarus and Roni successfully defended their tag team titles against Becky Bayless and Lucy Furr at the WEW event \\"Tit For Tat\\". On March 20, 2009, she wrestled at Firestorm Pro Wrestling against Sassy Stephie in a match that featured April Hunter as the guest referee. Ohio Valley Wrestling (2012) In 2012, Lynch joined Ohio Valley Wrestling, and unsuccessfully challenged Taeler Hendrix for the OVW Women's Championship. At Saturday Night Special on February 4, she teamed with C.J. Lane to lose to Aleida Ortiz and Taeler Hendrix. On February 8, she lost a six-person mixed tag team match with Bull Bronson and Epiphany to Paredyse, C.J. Lane and Taeler Hendrix.

Approximately nine million dollars' worth of damage was done to the submarine, and it was out of service for seven months. An investigation into the accident revealed that basic navigational errors combined with equipment failures were to blame for the submarine running into the rocky shallows. Timeline of events leading up to the accident The US Navy investigation into the incident revealed a pattern of navigation, procedural and equipment errors leading up to the accident. * December 2001 The commander of Hartfords home squadron in Groton, Connecticut stated that navigation practices in the squadron \\"do not uniformly meet the submarine force's exacting professional standards.\\" * July 2002 An instructor at the Naval Submarine Base in Groton warned that Hartfords navigation team needed to improve how it set up for a turn, and also how it logged the boat's position on maritime charts. * Early 2003 While the crew completed the preparation for overseas movement certification \\"numerous plotting errors\\" were observed. It was noted that the crew seemed to have difficulty planning turns and failed to make the turns on track on three separate occasions. The boat's navigation team later passed the certification, and overall the boat was rated in the top third of the fleet for training readiness. * 14 April 2003 During a simulation the navigation team twice approached a navigation channel outside the correct track. * 3 June 2003 On a second occasion during a simulation, the navigation team were told to be more aggressive about making sure the boat was on track when it was in a channel. * 7 June 2003 An assessment of piloting practices on Hartford turned up 13 deficiencies and, crucially, that when the navigation team could not fix the boat's position on charts, the boat did not slow down. * 9 October 2003 USS Hartford departs from Groton for the Mediterranean. * 20 October 2003 Hartford arrives at the US base headquarters at the Santo Stefano island. Berthing outboard of at the submarine tender . An evaluator from submarine squadron 22 gave Hartfords navigation team an \\"average\\" score as the boat pulled into the submarine base at La Maddalena. But he also noted: ** The navigation team was not reconciling their primary navigation system with their backup system frequently enough to catch discrepancies in the systems. ** On an approach into a turn the navigation team went seven minutes between obtaining fixes of the boat's position, more than double the three-minute standard. ** The crewman fixing the boat's position on a maritime chart was too slow, at worst taking 1 minute and 15 seconds, when it should take no longer than 35 seconds. ** The boat's fathometer, which measures the water under the keel, was set to fathoms, the boat's charts indicated depth in meters, and the warning system was based on feet. * 24 October 2003 Hartford was scheduled to leave for her patrol, but problems developed with her sonar system, and the patrol was delayed while the submarine waited for replacement parts. * 25 October 2003 Visibility in the harbour was excellent and winds were between from the east. USS Springfield departed, and was coming into the tender to take Springfield’s place. While this was taking place, USS Hartford was ordered to go outside the harbor. ** 11:55 Hartford eased away from her tender and moved into the channel. As plotted the trip would consist of four turns, the longest leg of the course being about . The submarine should have reached the open sea in approximately 34 minutes. However, within minutes the boat's Voyage Management System, which provides the navigation team with electronic navigation charts and automatic fixes of the boat's position, crashed. The crew attempted to clear the fault by repeatedly rebooting the system. These attempts to fix the problem were unsuccessful. ** 12:09 The navigation team noticed a difference in the speed readouts of the Ring laser gyroscope navigator and the electromagnetic log, two other key pieces of navigation equipment. ** 12:22 The captain ordered the boat to increase speed to from the planned speed of . At approximately the same time, the assistant navigator and an electronics technician left the control room to try to determine what was causing the equipment failures. The captain was never notified that key members of the navigation crew had left their stations. The sun rises behind the submarine tender Emory S. Land at Santo Stefano, Italy. ** 12:28 The bridge ordered the turn into the third leg of the trip, almost early. As a result of the equipment failures, a waypoint was entered into the Global positioning system incorrectly, putting the turning point several hundred yards off the correct location. ** 12:30 The navigation team makes an attempt to fix the boat's position on the charts. The investigation found the boat was about closer to than the position the crew plotted. ** 12:34 Hartford turns into the fourth leg of her course out of the harbor. It is not clear who ordered this turn. The Hartford turns to the north-northeast and is traveling at almost . ** 12:36 The navigation team makes a tentative fix on the boat's position but they are unable to confirm it. There is growing concern on the bridge about the lack of a plotted position: the executive officer asks the navigation team, \\"Nav, where the fuck are we?\\", the captain asks the XO \\"do we have anything at all working down there?\\". ** 12:37 The sailor watching the fathometer warns the navigation team that the water depth under the hull is decreasing, and was now just . On board a tugboat that had been escorting Hartford out of the harbor, the Italian Coast Guard liaison noticed that Hartford was not following the normal northern course out of La Maddalena. He attempts to call Hartford on the radio and a cell phone without success. ** 12:37:30 The fathometer watch alerts the navigation team to the fact that the depth under the hull is now just , ** 12:37:45 Again the fathometer watch warns that the water level is down to just . ** 12:40 Hartford strikes the bottom about off Bisce Island. The boat begins to slow. Afraid that the boat would be stranded on the rocks, the squadron commodore, Captain Greg Parker, who is on board Hartford orders \\"Speed on.\\" ** The first collision is followed by two more impacts, the second of these is the worst, rolling the boat 10 to 12 degrees onto her port side, and lifting her out of the water Aftermath Damage to USS Hartfords rudder. Navy divers from USS Emory S. Land inspected Hartford the next day and found large areas of the hull scraped down to bare metal. Sound damping anechoic tiles had been ripped away, metal grates over the ballast tanks had been badly distorted and the passive sonar hydrophone system damaged in three separate locations. The worst damage was at the aft end of the boat, where the rocks had torn off the bottom part of the rudder. So severe was the damage, that there was some question as to the structural integrity of the hull; however, temporary repairs were conducted at La Maddalena. And on 19 November 2003 Hartford proceeded back to Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia under her own power, but at half speed—arriving on 17 December 2003. Hartford then underwent repairs for seven months. It finally returned to Groton. After the accident Commander Christopher R. Van Metre, captain of Hartford, and Captain Greg Parker, Commodore of Submarine Squadron 22, were relieved of command and sent back to the United States. Six other crewmen were also charged with dereliction of duty. The U.S. Navy report into the incident made several recommendations, one of which is to ensure that no transfers of key personnel occur prior to, or during a deployment. Hartfords captain had reported aboard only weeks before the boat left for the Mediterranean and his unfamiliarity with the crew and the boat were contributing factors. The lessons learned about the failures in navigation have been incorporated into the \\"submarine on-board training syllabus\\". The Navy has also asked the government of Italy to place more navigational buoys warning of shallow water near Sardinia. Environmental impact There was some concern after the accident, especially given the fact the incident was not reported to the public until 12 November, three weeks after the accident. There was some outcry in the Italian press, especially since a nuclear submarine was involved. Subsequent investigations have shown that there was no leak from the submarine.http://www.irsn.fr/va/04_act/04_act_1/04_act_communiques_irsn/04_act_communiques_irsn_2003/04_act_031128.shtmhttp://www.irsn.net/vf/04_act/04_act_1/04_act_communiques_irsn/04_act_communiques_irsn_2004/04_act_040129.shtm References * http://crashrecovery.org/USS-Hartford.pdf * http://www.navytimes.com/story.php?f=1-292925-2505510.php * http://www.irsn.fr/va/04_act/04_act_1/04_act_communiques_irsn/04_act_communiques_irsn_2003/04_act_031128.shtm * http://www.bellona.no/en/international/russia/nuke_industry/co- operation/31750.html Bibliography * * Category:Maritime incidents in 2003 Category:United States submarine accidents Category:2003 in Italy ","title":"USS Hartford grounding"},{"id":"1886010","text":"Vincent de Paul The Vincentian Family comprises organizations inspired by the life and work of Vincent de Paul, a 17th-century priest who \\"transformed the face of France.\\" He directly founded the Confraternities of Charity (today known as the AIC) the Congregation of the Mission and the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul.

He particularly concerns himself with the abuse of language and has written two books on the subject: Unspeak (2006) and Who Touched Base In My Thought Shower? (2013). Biography Poole studied English at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and has subsequently written for publications including The Independent, The Guardian, The Times Literary Supplement, The Sunday Times, and the New Statesman. He has published two books and currently writes a weekly nonfiction book-review column in the Saturday Guardian called Et Cetera, as well as regular longer book reviews, plus a monthly column in Edge magazine.

He was a twentythree-time world champion and a record 20-time WCWA Champion. He was also the owner of the World Class Championship Wrestling territory.Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.129) Football career Adkisson attended Southern Methodist University, where he threw discus and played football. He has been reported to have played with the now defunct Dallas Texans of the NFL (not the AFL team which became the Kansas City Chiefs), but this is not true. He was signed as a guard but was cut. He then tried the Canadian Football League (CFL). Professional wrestling career=Early career and training While in Edmonton, he met legendary wrestler and trainer Stu Hart, and Hart decided to train and book him in his Klondike Wrestling promotion, naming him Fritz Von Erich and teaming him with \\"brother\\" Waldo Von Erich as a pair of \\"evil German\\" brothers. Adkisson's oldest son Jack Barton Adkisson Jr. was born September 21, 1952. He died in 1959 after an accidental electrocution and drowning, and Jack Sr. stopped traveling to the east coast, allowing former partner Waldo to use the Von Erich name in the World Wide Wrestling Federation. 1960s Despite Jack Jr.'s death, Adkisson continued to travel and wrestle. Adkisson won both versions of the AWA World title in 1963. His major circuit was Sam Muchnick's NWA territorial stronghold in St. Louis, Missouri. He wrestled there until 1967, when he voluntarily left the territory after losing a match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against then-champion Gene Kiniski.Dave Meltzer, Wrestling Observer Newsletter, January 9, 2008 In the late 1960s, with Muchnick's backing, Adkisson became the promoter for the Dallas territory, effectively overseeing the Houston and San Antonio territories, as well. Japan Adkisson was a part of rebuilding Japanese wrestling after the stabbing death of Rikidōzan. He became a star due to his feuds with Antonio Inoki and Giant Baba, and his \\"Iron Claw\\" hold, which became one of the most popular wrestling moves in Japan. Retirement In 1982, he held his first retirement match against King Kong Bundy in the newly renamed World Class Championship Wrestling promotion, based in Dallas. The promotion was known for its high production values, use of entrance music and the use of television syndication. The promotion was one of the most successful territories in the United States, with major draws like his sons, The Fabulous Freebirds, Chris Adams, Abdullah the Butcher, Bruiser Brody, Gino Hernandez and Rick Rude. By the end of the 1980s, the promotion's talent pool was thin and it was eventually merged with Jerry Jarrett's Continental Wrestling Association to create the United States Wrestling Association in 1989. Personal life and death Adkisson married Doris J. Smith on June 23, 1950.Texas Divorces Together, they had six sons: Jack Barton Jr. (September 21, 1952 – March 7, 1959), Kevin (born May 15, 1957), David (July 22, 1958 – February 10, 1984), Kerry (February 3, 1960 – February 18, 1993), Mike (March 2, 1964 – April 12, 1987) and Chris (September 30, 1969 – September 12, 1991). Of Adkisson's six sons, Kevin was the only one still living by the time Adkisson died. The couple later separated and Doris divorced her husband on July 21, 1992 after 42 years of marriage. Adkisson died of brain and lung cancer on September 10, 1997. His funeral service was held at the First Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas. His body was cremated with his ashes interred in the same plot as his fourth son, Kerry.

The anhydrous compound is relatively rare, but the related hydrate is useful for preparing other iridium compounds. The anhydrous salt is a dark green crystalline solid. More commonly encountered is the trihydrate IrCl3(H2O)3. Preparation Iridium is separated from the other platinum group metals as crystalline ammonium hexachloroiridate, (NH4)2[IrCl6], which can be reduced to iridium metal in a stream of hydrogen. The spongy Ir thus produced reacts with chlorine at 300–400 °C to give iridium(III) chloride. Like the related rhodium compound, IrCl3 adopts the structure seen for aluminium chloride. Hydrated iridium trichloride is obtained by heating hydrated iridium(III) oxide with hydrochloric acid. Uses Industrially, most iridium complexes are generated from ammonium hexachloroiridate or the related chloroiridic acid (H2IrCl6) as these salts are the most common commercial forms of iridium chlorides. Hydrated iridium(III) chloride is used in the laboratory for the preparation of other iridium compounds such as Vaska's complex, trans-[IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2].Vaska, L.; & DiLuzio, J. W. (1961) J. Am.

Refers to all genres of hip hop music in the Ukrainian language. The term Ukr-hop is also sometimes used to refer to any hip hop music made by Ukrainians, including instrumental hip hop, as well as rap songs by members of the Ukrainian diaspora.  History  In Ukraine hip hop began to develop in 1990s. In 1989 started their activities two biggiest hip hop groups at that time - TNMK and V.U.Z.V. The pioneers of Ukrainian hip hop were TNMK (Kharkiv), V.U.Z.V (Kiev), Osnovnyy Pokaznyk (Luts'k), Tartak (Lviv) and GreenJolly (Ivano-Frankivs'k). At the end of the 1990s and beginning of the 2000s audience considered Kharkiv and Lviv as the main center of the Ukra.hop subculture. Many groups successfully performed at festivals such as Chervona Ruta and Tavriyski Ihry. At the mid-2000s a lot of underground bands and artists from another cities in Ukraine began to appear and became popular: DaHok (Drohobych), Zахідна Коаліція (Stryi), Kryzhyk (Uman), Sheksta (Stryi), Sirius MC (Kalush) and Freel (Kiev). In 2005, Ukraine's entrant in the Eurovision Song Contest, GreenJolly's \\"Together We Are Many\\", was also the unofficial anthem of the Orange Revolution. Eurovision demanded the lyrics to be changed for the contest (because it did not correspond to contests rules due to political content). Also this song was remade by Polish hip hop artists. In 2008 hip hop group LEZO released their fourth studio album, Gostroslovy (Ukrainian: Гострослови). Many critics consider it one of the best in Ukrainian hip-hop industry. The same year KyLЯ and RYLEZ created group Tulym - one of the most successful Ukrainian boom bap group. March 11, 2011, Ukrainian rapper Ivan Buyan presented his first music video filmed in New York City. June 19, 2014, PVNCH presented their new album - Golodnyy (Ukrainian: Голодний, translation: Hungry). According to voting results Golodnyy was named the best hip-hop album of 2014. April 18, 2015, Tulym from Kiev had a concert with legendary hip-hop band from New York City - Onyx in Sofia, Bulgaria. A rising new star of Ukrainian origin self proclaimed \\"Nazaren tha Prophet\\" (Nazar Kotovych) has been rewriting Ukrainian rap history in the United States. Writing and rapping since 1997 the artist performs and records in four different languages mixing them together. Debut Album \\"Birth Of The Nazaren\\" came out in 2012. He is due to release a very politically charged album in 2016 titled \\"Partec Mendacii\\" and another one in the beginning of 2017. This artist is thought to make a real buzz the rap critics say \\"in the up coming years he will put Ukrainian hip-hop on the level of its predecessors and in the public view of the world\\".  Style  Musically, Ukrainian hip hop is heavily influenced by Jamaican reggae and Ukrainian folk music, resulting a very tuneful and mellow sound, which makes it quite different from both Russian and American counterparts. There has been an increase in the population of West Africans in Ukraine, and hip hop events have reflected musical trends popular in West Africa.

Koch Cap Company.\\" Production started on the third floor of 1830 Genesee Street in Buffalo, New York. The company started with 14 employees, including Ehrhardt’s sister Rose, Ehrhardt's son, Harold, and Rose's son Wally Domas. In 1920, the company produced 60,000 caps. In 1934, New Era began producing caps for the Cleveland Indians, which would be their first Major League Baseball (MLB) contract. In 1954, the company’s fitted pro cap was modernized, redesigned and named the 59Fifty, aka the \\"Brooklyn Style\\" cap, by Harold Koch, who introduced many design improvements and innovations while head of New Era. By 1965, New Era was supplying caps to about 10 of the 20 MLB teams. In 1993, New Era was granted the first exclusive license with MLB to produce the on-field baseball caps for all of its (then 28, now 30) teams. In 2001, Chris Koch was named CEO. In the 2010s, while New Era had long been associated with baseball, the company focused on delving into football and other sports leagues. In 2012, it acquired full exclusive sideline rights for the National Football League (NFL). In 2013, New Era signed with Australian cricket's Big Bash League as their official cap provider. New Era signed an additional deal in 2015 with Manchester United. In 2017, New Era signed exclusive rights for NBA on-court products. This made New Era the first headwear company to have exclusive rights for MLB, the NFL, and the NBA simultaneously. It was announced on August 13, 2016, that New Era and the Buffalo Bills reached an agreement for naming rights for Ralph Wilson Stadium. The Bills and New Era officially announced the stadium's new name of New Era Field five days later, on August 18, 2016. After the Bills released CEO Russ Brandon in May 2018, New Era hired Brandon in an executive position.https://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2018/07/31/russ-brandon- joins-new-era-cap-co.html A day later, New Era denied the hiring had taken place.https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2018/07/31/new-era-does-not-hire- former-bills-president-russ-brandon-after-all/ The Athletic, which made the initial claim, continues to insist the hiring happened and that Brandon had been quietly fired after the story broke.https://theathletic.com/453802/2018/07/31/new-era-cap-denies-russ- brandon-hire-even-though-he-was-in-company-phone-directory/ The stadium sponsorship agreement was ended at New Era's request in 2020, and the stadium was renamed Bills Stadium. On September 12, 2018, it was announced that New Era would be the official outfitter for the Canadian Football League starting in the 2019 season. The company has been a licensee of the CFL for headwear and apparel since January 2011 and it will be the first time that the company provides football uniforms and sideline apparel. Cap recalls In the summer of 2007, New Era voluntarily pulled three styles of New York Yankees hats from shelves across the country because the designs on the caps were seen to be gang-related. There were three caps that stood out; two with a bandanna like pattern around the top and one with a gold crown. Brian Martinez, an NYPD detective involved with Peace on the Street said \\"Bandannas represent gang flags,\\" \\"New Era is making it really convenient for gang members, because now your flag is part of your hat.\\" The patterns on the hats were similar to the flags of the Crips, the Bloods and the Latin Kings. Much of the New York public protested about the caps and in response to these allegations, a New Era spokesperson stated that the company does not market to gangs and when notified by activist groups and public officials, the company took immediate action.Sandomir, Richard. \\"Yankee Caps Pulled After Protesters See Gang Links in Symbols and Colors\\" The New York Times.

The MAX line follows the old Oregon Electric right-of-way and shares several stop names with the old interurban. The name derives from the names of the daughters of an owner of land along the route. Samuel B. Stoy, a Portland insurance executive, owned property along the proposed OE line and only gave permission for the railroad to go through his property if the company agreed to name the station after his daughters, Eleanor and Monica. After the station was named Elmonica, this then led to the area around the station becoming known as Elmonica as well.

It is situated on the island of Vágar between the municipalities of Sørvágur and Vágar. Its area is 3.4 km2, more than three times the size of Fjallavatn, the second largest lake, also located on Vágar.  Name  Among the locals, there is disagreement regarding the name of the lake. The inhabitants of Sørvágur to the west prefer Sørvágsvatn, which means \\"the lake by Sørvágur\\". The inhabitants of Miðvágur and Sandavágur to the east prefer Leitisvatn, which means \\"the lake by Leiti\\", referring to the territory on east side of it. The village of Miðvágur is situated closer to the lake than Sørvágur, but the latter is considered to have been settled earlier. Sørvágur – alongside Bøur and Sandavágur – is considered one of the three original settlements on Vágar. These divided the land on the island into three equal regions of 60 marks, which would place the lake within Sørvágur's region. The locals mostly refer to it as Vatnið (\\"the lake\\"), which is understood as a reference to that body of water. It is mostly when people from other parts of the Faroes refer to the lake by one of its given names that the debate will occur.  Geography  Map of the lake. 1898 or 1899 photo showing the waterfall Bøsdalafossur. The lake is located very close to the ocean, but its surface is about 40 metres above the level of sea. It is surrounded by a higher cliff which prevents it from emptying fully into the ocean, the waterfall Bøsdalafossur being the outlet. The greater height of the cliffs on either side of Bøsdalafossur can give the illusion from certain perspectives that the lake is higher above sea level than it is.  History  During World War II, the British army built an airfield (now Vágar Airport) to the west of the lake. They also built a station to support seaplanes.

In molecular physics In the field of molecular physics, microwave spectroscopy is commonly used to probe the rotation of molecules. In condensed matter physics In the field of condensed matter physics, microwave spectroscopy is used to detect dynamic phenomena of either charges or spins at GHz frequencies (corresponding to nanosecond time scales) and energy scales in the µeV regime. Matching to these energy scales, microwave spectroscopy on solids is often performed as a function of temperature (down to cryogenic regimes of a few K or even lower) and/or magnetic field (with fields up to several T). Spectroscopy traditionally considers the frequency-dependent response of materials, and in the study of dielectrics microwave spectroscopy often covers a large frequency range. In contrast, for conductive samples as well as for magnetic resonance, experiments at a fixed frequency are common (using a highly sensitive microwave resonator), but frequency-dependent measurements are also possible. Probing charges in condensed matter physics For insulating materials (both solid and liquid), probing charge dynamics with microwaves is a part of dielectric spectroscopy. Amongst the conductive materials, superconductors are a material class that is often studied with microwave spectroscopy, giving information about penetration depth (governed by the superconducting condensate), energy gap (single- particle excitation of Cooper pairs), and quasiparticle dynamics. Another material class that has been studied using microwave spectroscopy at low temperatures are heavy fermion metals with Drude relaxation rates at GHz frequencies. Probing spins in condensed matter physics Microwaves impinging on matter usually interact with charges as well as with spins (via electric and magnetic field components, respectively), with the charge response typically much stronger than the spin response. But in the case of magnetic resonance, spins can be directly probed using microwaves. For paramagnetic materials, this technique is called electron spin resonance (ESR) and for ferromagnetic materials ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). In the paramagnetic case, such an experiment probes the Zeeman splitting, with a linear relation between the static external magnetic field and the frequency of the probing microwave field. A popular combination, as implemented in commercial X-band ESR spectrometers, is approximately 0.3 T (static field) and 10 GHz (microwave frequency) for a typical material with electron g-factor close to 2.

The film tells the story of the real- life trial of a man who impersonated film-maker Mohsen Makhmalbaf, conning a family into believing they would star in his new film.DVD of the Week: Close- UpThe New Yorker It features the people involved, acting as themselves. A film about human identity, it helped to increase recognition of Kiarostami internationally. Many critics consider Close-Up a masterpiece of world cinema; in the 2012 Sight & Sound poll, it was voted by critics onto \\"The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time\\" list. Story Hossain Sabzian is a cinephile, and in particular a big fan of popular Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf. One day, Sabzian is riding a bus with a copy of a published screenplay of The Cyclist; Mrs. Ahankhah sits next to him, revealing she is a fan of the film. Sabzian tells her that he himself is Makhmalbaf, the creator and learns that her sons are interested in film. Posing as Makhmalbaf, Sabzian visits the Ahankhah family several times over the next two weeks. He flatters them by saying he wants to use their house in his next film and their sons as actors. He also borrows 1,900 tomans from one of the sons for cab fare. Mr. Ahankhah starts to suspect him as an imposter trying to rob them, especially when a magazine photograph shows a younger Makhmalbaf with darker hair. He invites a journalist, Hossain Farazmand, who confirms that Sabzian is indeed an impostor. The police come to arrest Sabzian, while Farazmand takes several pictures for his upcoming article titled \\"Bogus Makhmalbaf Arrested\\".These scenes are shown in flashback throughout the film and were re-enacted. Kiarostami visits Sabzian in prison and helps to move his trial up, and receives permission from the judge to record the trial. At the trial, Sabzian is tried for fraud and attempted fraud. He reveals his motivations for the imitation as love for Makhmalbaf's film and cinema, while the Ahankhah's son recounts his visits as they started to suspect him. Due to his circumstances as a young father with no prior record and his remorse, the judge asks the family if they would be willing to pardon Sabzian. They agree in exchange for him becoming a productive member of society. After the trial, the real Makhmalbaf meets Sabzian and gives him a ride back to the Ahankhah's house, with Kiarostami's crew following. When they meet Mr. Ahankhah, he says of Sabzian: \\"I hope he'll be good now and make us proud of him.\\" Cast * Hossain Sabzian as Himself * Mohsen Makhmalbaf as Himself * Abbas Kiarostami as Himself * Abolfazl Ahankhah as Himself * Mehrdad Ahankhah as Himself * Monoochehr Ahankhah as Himself * Mahrokh Ahankhah as Herself * Haj Ali Reza Ahmadi as Himself, the Judge * Nayer Mohseni Zonoozi as Herself * Ahmad Reza Moayed Mohseni as Himself, a family friend * Hossain Farazmand as Himself, a reporter * Hooshang Shamaei as Himself, a Taxi Driver * Mohammad Ali Barrati as Himself, a Soldier * Davood Goodarzi as Himself, a Sergeant * Hassan Komaili as Himself, a Court Recorder * Davood Mohabbat as Himself, a Court Recorder TCM.com Notes The film references one of Kiarostami's previous films, the 1974 soccer drama The Traveler (considered by the director to be his first 'authentic' feature).The Traveler - Close-up - Criterion Channel It also mentions The Cyclist, a 1987 sports drama film made by the real Mohsen Makhmalbaf three years prior to Close-Up.The Cyclist (1989)- IMDb Production Close-Up is based on real events that occurred in Northern Tehran in the late 1980s. Kiarostami first heard about Sabzian in 1989 after reading about the incident in an article in the Iranian magazine Sorush by journalist Hassan Farazmand. Kiarostami immediately suspended work on the film project that he was in pre-production of and began making a documentary on Sabzian. Kiarostami was allowed to film Sabzian's trial and also got Sabzian, the Ahankhahs and Farazmand to agree to participate in the film and to re- enact incidents from the past. Kiarostami also arranged for Mohsen Makhmalbaf to meet Sabzian and help facilitate forgiveness between Sabzian and the Ahankhahs. Critical reception When the film opened in Iran, reviews were almost uniformly negative, and the film only began to be appreciated after it was shown abroad.Close-up: Prison and EscapeThe CurrentThe Criterion Collection The New York Times film critic Stephen Holden called the film \\"brilliant,\\" noting its \\"radically drab cinema-verite style that helps blur any difference between what is real and what is reconstructed.\\"Holden, Stephen, \\"Close Up (1990) FILM REVIEW; The Pathos Of Deceit By a Victim Of Longing.\\" The New York Times, December 31, 1999, Accessed on November 17, 2012. In 2010 Los Angeles Times critic Dennis Lim called the film eloquent and direct and that it provided \\"a window into the psyche of a complicated man and into the social and cultural reality of Iran.\\"Lim, Dennis, \\"A Second Look: Abbas Kiarostami's 'Close-Up'.\\" The Los Angeles Times, June 9, 2010, Accessed on November 17, 2012. In 2012 it ranked #43 in the British Film Institute's critics' poll of the 50 best films ever made. Influence Five years after Close-Up, Moslem Mansouri and Mahmoud Chokrollahi wrote and directed the documentary Close-Up Long Shot (, Klūzāp nemā-ye dūr) in which Sabzian talks about his infatuation with cinema, his impersonation of Makhmalbaf and how his life has changed after working with Kiarostami. The film premiered at Turin's 14° Festival internazionale cinema giovani in November 1996 where it won the FIPRESCI Prize – Special Mention. Nanni Moretti's 1996 Italian short film Opening Day of Close-Up follows a theater owner as he prepares to show Kiarostami's film at his independent cinema. Marcus Söderlund's 2007 music video for Swedish duo The Tough Alliance's \\"A New Chance\\" pays homage to Kiarostami's film with an almost shot-for-shot reproduction of a scene following two characters on a motorcycle.  Aftermath  In 2006, Hossain Sabzian died at age 52 after suffering a heart attack. He suffered respiratory failure on the Tehran metro in August, slipped into a coma, and died on September 29.

The degree is formatted differently worldwide and may be either a five-year program or a doctoral level graduate program that occurs after a master's degree but before a doctoral degree.  The Specialist degree in the Commonwealth of Independent States  The Diploma of Specialist ( • ) is a five-year higher-education diploma that was the only first higher-education diploma in the former Soviet Union (the Candidate of Sciences was the first academic level degree while the Doctor of Sciences was the highest academic credential) and continues to be offered throughout the USSR successor states in parallel with the new bachelor's degree. In terms of the number of instructional hours it is typically, 35 to 42 classroom hours per week, 34 weeks of instruction plus 6 weeks of exams per academic year. Commonly referred to simply as \\"Diploma\\" ( • ), the Soviet/Russian-style Diploma of Specialist is believed to have originated in the engineering education in the Russian Empire. According to the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia, the specialist degree called qualification (degree) of \\"specialist\\" ( • ). In the early 1990s the bakalavr (bachelor) and magistr (master) were introduced in all countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States except Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. However, Diploma of Specialist (five years) is still conferred in Belarus, Russia and Tajikistan. The Diploma of Specialist was discontinued in the following countries: Kazakhstan (2004), Ukraine (2017),Ministry of Education cancels the \\"experts\\" and \\"Ph.D.\\" , Ukrayinska Pravda (11 July 2016) Georgia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and Moldova. Under the Federal Law on Education of Russia, the Diploma of Specialist requires a minimum of five years of study. Below are some examples of Diploma of Specialist programs in the former USSR and Russia: *Diploma of Economist (диплом экономиста • ) – first degree in economy or management (including engineering management). *Diploma of Engineer (диплом инженера • ) – the engineer's degree in the CIS. *Diploma of Teacher (диплом учителя • ) – the first degree for teachers. *Diploma of Physician (диплом врача • ) – this degree type includes the respective degrees of physicians, dentists and veterinarians in the CIS; the equivalent degree in the U.S. is typically titled M.D.. *Diploma of Jurisprudent (диплом юриста • ) – the first degree in jurisprudence (study of law). *Diploma of Pharmacist (диплом фармацевта • ) – the first degree in pharmacy. Specialist degree in the United States In the United States, the Specialist's degree is hierarchically above the master's degree and below the Doctorate. It was invented by colleges and schools of education as an alternative to obtaining a doctorate, and focuses on subjects pertinent to K-12 education - such as leadership and counseling, and educational psychology. Degrees commonly available include: * Ed.S or Sp.Ed. – Specialist of Education * Psy.S. – Specialist in Psychology * S.S.P. – Specialist in School Psychology * Sp.A. – Specialist in Arts (offered by Eastern Michigan University) * S.C.C.T. – Specialist in Community College Teaching (offered by Arkansas State University) * S.L.I.S. – Specialist in Library and Information Science (offered by the School of Informatics and Computing at Indiana University Bloomington). The American Specialist degree typically requires 30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours beyond the master's degree (60 semester hours or 90 quarter hours beyond the Baccalaureate) and can be completed in one to three academic years of continuous full-time or part-time enrolment. Depending on the particular program, practica and / or internship and / or practical field work may be required. Students admitted directly from the baccalaureate may earn a Master's degree in progression toward the Specialist's degree; or the institution may accept applications only from students who already hold a master's degree. The coursework for an Ed.S. or Sp.A. in Education program is approximately the same workload as a second Master's in terms of credits. But whereas coursework for the initial master's degree is from the introductory and lower intermediate levels of graduate study (e.g. Levels 500 and 600 at institutions that use 100 - 900 level course numbering systems), work for the Specialist's degree will be in the intermediate and upper levels (e.g. 600, 700 and 800 level courses). According to the U.S. Department of Education's International Affairs Office's leaflet, entitled, \\"Structure of the U.S. Education System: Intermediate Graduate Qualifications,\\" (Feb 2008), the Ed.S., as a degree, is equivalent to the D.Min. or Psy.D. / D.Psy. This reflects the degree's origin as an alternate to professional doctorates. Ed.S. programs lead to professional degrees in the application of advanced educational theory but do not typically place an emphasis on conducting original research such as in Ed.D. / D.Ed. or Ph.D. programs. School Psychology and Curriculum and Instruction are two of the most common areas where a specialist degree is found. In the field of school psychology, the degree is typically an Ed.S. or SSP. Despite being virtually identical in scope and function, the Ed.S. and SSP both exist within the field of school psychology because training programs can be offered within the departments of psychology or education. They simply designate the type of program from which the degree originated. As another alternative, some programs within psychology departments have begun offering a Psy.S. degree instead of an SSP. In many fields outside of education, the postgraduate certificate fills the same need as a Specialist degree - but differs in being an academic certificate rather than an academic degree. Postgraduate or graduate certificates typically require one-third to one-half the coursework of a master's degree and an offered in a specific topical area, such as a Certificate in Historic Preservation. Certain graduate programs are de facto specialist degrees. In the field of Engineering, the Engineer's degree is a post-Master's degree, offered at a modest number of US universities (but including some prestigious ones such as Stanford and Caltech), which is relatively analogous to the Specialist degree. In French higher education, the Mastère Spécialisé is a degree designed essentially as a post-Master's degree, offered as a full-time, one-year program (although there are \\"Executive\\" versions of this degree, designed for working professionals, which take a little longer to complete). As such, this French degree also forms a close analogy to its US counterpart, although the Mastère Spécialisé is offered in a variety of fields such as business, informatics, and aeronautics.

India, Rajasthan, early 19th century. Dacian scale armour on Trajan's column. Scale armour (or scale mail) is an early form of armour consisting of many individual small armour scales (plates) of various shapes attached to each other and to a backing of cloth or leather in overlapping rows.Armed Batavians: Use and Significance of Weaponry and Horse Gear from Non-military Contexts in the Rhine Delta (50 Bc to Ad 450), Author Johan Nicolay, Publisher Amsterdam University Press, 2008, , Scale armour was worn by warriors of many different cultures as well as their horses. The material used to make the scales varied and included bronze, iron, steel, rawhide, leather, cuir bouilli, seeds, horn, or pangolin scales. The variations are primarily the result of material availability. Scale armour – a defence of great antiquity – began in the Middle East. The earliest representation is the tomb of Kenamon, who lived in Egypt in the reign of Amenhotep II (1436–1411 BCE).H. Russell Robinson, Oriental Armour, Dover Publications, Inc., Mineola, New York, 2002.  Types  Scale armour is armour in which the individual scales are sewn or laced to a backing by one or more edges and arranged in overlapping rows resembling the scales of a fish/reptile or roofing tiles.Publication: Anthropological series, Volume 13, (Field Museum of Natural History : 1909), Author Field Museum of Natural History, Publisher The Museum, 1913, Original from Harvard University P.258 The scales are usually assembled and strapped by lacing or rivets. Lorica squamata is an ancient Roman armour of this type. Other types of armour made from individual scales but constructed in a different manner have their own separate names, such as lamellar armour where the individual scales are perforated on several or all edges and lashed tightly to each other in straight ridged rows and do not need to be attached to a backing. The Romans also had a variant called lorica plumata in which the scales were attached to mail.Roman military equipment: from the Punic Wars to the fall of Rome, M. C. Bishop, J. C. Coulston, Oxbow Books, 2006 – History P.95  Historical information = Scythians  The Scythians' horse warriors appear to have used scale or possibly lamellar armour, evident both from contemporary illustrations and burial finds in kurgans. The armour was made from small plates of iron or bronze. Unique to the Scythians, about 20% of the females found in graves were dressed for war, some including armour, which may have inspired the Greek tales of Amazons. Due to the semi-rigid nature of the armour, the Scythian variety was made as breast- and back-plates, with separate shoulder pieces. Some finds indicate partial armour, where a leather shirt or similar garment have sewn-on scales in places, particularly around the neck and upper chest.  Roman scale armour  Fragment of Lorica squamata. Each plate has six holes and the scales are linked in rows. Only the \\"lowermost\\" holes are visible on most scales, while a few show the pair above and the ring fastener passing through them. The individual scales used to construct Roman armour are called squamaeA new and complete dictionary of arts and sciences, Volume 4 P.3046 or squamaA new Latin-English school-lexicon: on the basis of the Latin-German lexicon of Dr. C. F. Ingerslev, George Richard Crooks, Christian Frederik Ingersley, Alexander Jacob Schem, J.B. Lippincott, 1861 P.859 During Roman times, scale armour (lorica squamata) was a popular alternative to mail (lorica hamata) as it offered better protection against blunt force trauma. It was also widely used in Middle Eastern empires, such as Persia and Byzantium. In these areas, scales were commonly dished (that is with a bowl effect from a depression being hammered into a flat piece of metal) in order to benefit from the extra protection offered by a rounded scale. According to the statement of Herodotus, the ancient Persians wore tunics with sleeves of diverse colours, having upon them iron scales of the shape of fish-scales; and this comparison leaves no doubt that scale armour, and not mail, is meant. OCLC 2301581 Scale armour is not of frequent occurrence on the grave monuments of the German frontier. On two tombstones of the Sertorii at Verona (one that of a centurion, the other that of a standard- bearer) both figures are represented wearing a tunic of scale armour which covers the shoulders and comes down below the belt. The Carnuntum monument of Calidius (a work of the middle of the first century) shows also a scaled tunic of a centurion. Again, in the collection of marble portrait-busts from the great Gallo-Roman villa of Chiragan near Toulouse, the Emperors Antoninus Pius and Severus both appear wearing corselets of scale armour.  Korea  Scale armour consisting of many plates and studs were used for the military officers from the Samgukji era pre 1000BC and were very effective against light missiles such as arrows. It was also used in the battles against Japanese invasion during the 14-1500 era, which proved the armour against Japanese weapons.

It is also cheaper to produce, but it is not as flexible and does not offer the same amount of coverage. Forms other than brigandine and coat of plates were uncommon in medieval Europe, but scale and lamellar remained popular elsewhere. Modern forms of scale armour are sometimes worn for decorative or LARP purposes, and may be made from materials such as steel, aluminium, or even titanium. A similar type of modern personal armour is Dragon Skin body armour, which uses ballistic fabric and high-impact resistant ceramic plates to protect against pistol and rifle fire.

The station is the seventh stop eastbound on the Westside MAX from downtown Hillsboro and includes a park-and-ride lot. Quatama Station is named after the area which includes Quatama Road to the south of the station.

One piece of art reflecting that theme at the stop is a weather vane designed by Michael Oppenheimer.Hamilton, Don. Sculptures will let riders know which way wind is blowing. The Oregonian, July 23, 1997. The weather vane is titled “Cattail Tunes” and is based on the plant that grows in nearby wetlands. Constructed of stainless steel rods, the piece is composed of five rods standing tall and six feet apart.Windy art. The Oregonian, July 23, 1997. The rods are topped with metal cattail heads, each a different height so that they sway differently from each other. Continuing with the natural elements theme, the platform has animal tracks etched into the concrete while the windscreen in the passenger shelter includes a map of the watershed for the Tualatin River etched into the glass. Across from the platform is a plaza entitled “Flow” which features a simulated creek in the concrete. Along the creek are boulders that have scientific images engraved into them, along with a water basin that illustrates how water run-off occurs. The inspiration for this artwork comes from an arrangement made by a Japanese macaque at the Oregon National Primate Research Center across the street from the station. Designers for the artwork at Quatama Station were Jerry Mayer, Valerie Otani, Bill Will, and Fernanda D'Agostino.

Construction on the arena started in 1996 and was completed in time to hold its first event on September 22, 1997. The arena is owned by West Valley City, and managed by Centennial Management Group, Inc. During the 2002 Winter Olympics it served as the main venue for the ice hockey events, and as the venue for ice sledge hockey during the 2002 Winter Paralympics. Today the arena is home to the Utah Grizzlies, and it is also a major venue in the area for numerous concerts and live touring productions. History In July 1995, only a month after winning the 2002 Winter Olympic bid, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC) accepted a proposal from West Valley City to build a new ice hockey facility in their city. SLOC loaned $7 million to the city for construction costs, and would rent the arena from the city during the Olympic Games. The arena would be funded through a variety of ways, but would be owned by the municipality of West Valley City, and used for various events before and after the games. Ground was broken for the arena on March 22, 1996, and construction was completed in September 1997; the E Center was officially dedicated in a ceremony on September 19, 1997. The first event held in the new venue was WCW's Monday Nitro Live on September 22, 1997, notable for being the in-ring debut of Bill Goldberg. Naming rights In 2010, Centennial Management Group and West Valley City, announced that a new partnership (which included naming rights) had been reached with Maverik, Inc., owners of convenience stores throughout the Intermountain West. The sponsorship deal is a multi-year agreement, which included exclusive sponsorship and advertising rights, prominent signage on the exterior and interior of the building, along with a name change to the Maverik Center. Additionally, the venue now features Maverik's proprietary \\"adventure theme\\", a Maverik concession outlet, and exclusively sells a number of Maverik proprietary products.

The PBR hosted a Built Ford Tough Series event at the E Center in 2007; it was the PBR's first stop in the Salt Lake City area since 2000, when they visited the Delta Center. In indoor football, the arena previously hosted the Utah Warriors of the National Indoor Football League from 2003 to 2004. In the 2010 season, the E Center became the home for the re-launched Arena Football League's version of the Utah Blaze (formerly the Utah Valley Thunder) that ceased operations when the AFL declared bankruptcy and suspended operations in 2009. However, the Blaze returned to their old home at the EnergySolutions Arena for the 2011 season. In 2017, the arena was used for the home games of the Salt Lake Screaming Eagles, a team in the Indoor Football League that used fan interaction to help run the team. 2002 Winter Olympics and Paralympics The arena served as one of the venues for ice hockey during the 2002 games, with events spread out during six days in 31 sessions. The indoor facility was capable of holding 8,400 spectators, plus press members, during the competitions. 96.7% of available tickets were sold, for a total of 230,657 spectators witnessing events in the arena.

It is the fourth stop north on the Airport MAX branch, and consists of an island platform in the median of Interstate 205. The entrance and exit to the transit center are on Sandy Blvd. near 95th Avenue, in the Parkrose neighborhood and east of the Sumner neighborhood. It is a hub for bus service to Gresham, Tigard, Lents, Fairview, Vancouver, Wood Village and Clackamas. A bridge across the northbound lanes of I-205 connects the MAX platform to a park-and-ride lot and bus stops. Park and ride For almost 20 years before it became a transit center and MAX station, the site was already in use as a TriMet park-and-ride lot. TriMet's proposal to build the facility, with 288 spaces on a lot, was approved by the Multnomah County Planning Commission in September 1983, and the lot opened for use in summer 1984. It was not designated as a transit center, because it was served by only a single bus route (14-Sandy, renumbered 12 in 1986), and was referred to by TriMet as the Parkrose Park & Ride. A second bus route, 201-Airport Way, began serving the Parkrose Park and Ride later. In 2000–2001, a MAX light rail station was constructed adjacent to the park-and-ride lot. Additional bus routes began serving the site when the MAX station opened in September 2001, at which time it was newly designated as a transit center and was renamed Parkrose/Sumner Transit Center. As a result of 2001 expansion of the bus roadway and stops, and the addition of a building for use by drivers on layover, the size of the park-and-ride lot was reduced and the lot currently has 193 spaces.

They are the musical brainchild of composer Ross Tregenza. They were heavily involved in the development of UK electronic body music (EBM) and cybergoth genres in the early 2000s. Goteki split up in 2006, but reformed in 2008 as a three piece live act expanded from Tregenza's solo studio creations. They refer to their new musical style as 'death electro': a mix of alternative electro pop and industrial combined with influences from film and video game scores. Current activity Goteki's reformation in August 2008 saw them return as a two-piece (Ross Tregenza and Alastair Power, performing under the names of Tregenza and Ali-Star). They were re-joined in 2009 by Clive 'Crash' Lewis. They returned with a more mature sound, but with recognizable qualities from their older material. History=Formation The group was formed after Tregenza's former band, Sneaky Bat Machine (SBM), ended. The group took their name from one of the teams in the PlayStation game Wipeout 3 (eventually securing Sony's blessing to use the name). The original Goteki line-up consisted of ex-SBM members Tregenza on vocals, Clive Lewis on synths, and Bruce Attley on synthesizers and samples. Fight the Saucermen and Goteki O/S The band's first release was the Fight the Saucermen EP which was released in early 2000 on Wasp Factory Records. The EP received encouraging reviews. After touring extensively the band started working on their first album. This album was released in 2002 under the name Goteki O/S. It contains 17 tracks and is something of a concept album, divided into \\"phases\\" separated by instrumental tracks. For example, Signal One - Nihon is followed by the tracks Geisha Deconstruct and Ninjagrrl, which are inspired by Japanese culture. The album itself is rather eclectic in its style, songs range from ambient electronica to harsh drum and bass. All music on the album was, written and arranged by Tregenza, but there are also several guest appearances by other EBM musicians, such as Sebastian Komor of Icon of Coil and Jared Louche of Chemlab. It received rave reviews - Future Music Magazine called it a \\"Synthpop Happy Hardcore Melange that somehow works\\", and Kerrang Magazine lovingly called the band \\"Futuristic Nutjobs\\". For a selection of Goteki O/S reviews and increased the band's popularity within the cyber scene. The band played at Whitby Gothic Weekend's 10th Anniversary Festival. Goteki O/S : Corrupted Files The album Goteki O/S was followed by Goteki O/S : Corrupted Files, a remix album which contained remixes from bands such as DeathBoy, Icon of Coil and Sigue Sigue Sputnik. In late 2003, the band announced that they were taking a new direction, concentrating on live performance aspects and utilising a human drummer for the first time. With this shift in direction singer Tregenza dropped his former pseudonym Sneaky. A shake-up of the band's line up followed in 2004: Doktor A left the band and was replaced by Ali Star (real name Alastair Power) on bass and Yan-Yan (real name Lilian Cheung) on percussion. Goteki played at the 10th goth festival Convergence in 2004; this marked their US debut. At this point, the band were without a label, so Goteki's second album Revolution was an Internet-only download release. In 2005, the band also reached an international audience when some of their music was used on the soundtrack of Timesplitters Future Perfect. Revolution In late 2005, Clive Lewis left the band and was replaced by Edy Green on lead guitar. Due to heavy demand for a CD to be released, Goteki re-released Revolution with their own label, Alphastar Records, in late 2005. The album featured 17 tracks spanning a production time that overlapped with \\"Goteki O/S: Corrupted File\\"s. The album included the track Shinjuku Lullaby which would feature on Xbox game 'Project Gotham Racing 3'. It also featured a second remix by Graeme Norgate (under the alias Vi Rez) reprising his role as remixer on the Corrupted Files album. By this stage, band members were becoming tied up in other activities. Yan-Yan left the band in 2006 to pursue a career in modeling and fashion photography, and was replaced by Tregenza's long-time friend Rosie Harris. Tregenza himself joined the newly reformed Visage, playing guitar for their comeback tour. Sales of Revolution were disappointing, and Tregenza was frustrated that the band did not get the attention he felt they deserved. Goteki disbanded in March 2006. Their last performance took place at Electrofest on 30 April 2006. Present (2008 reformation) After disbanding Goteki, Ross announced work on a new project named Jetstream Lovers with members Edy and Ali Star. The group's original name, The Radio Stars, had to be changed for copyright reasons. In 2007, Tregenza surprised fans by announcing a new Goteki album would be released in 2008, containing previously unreleased Goteki tracks, as well as new compositions. 2008 saw Tregenza and Power starting a new electro project Lamorna, as which they played a few UK dates and began plans for an album. Summer 2008 saw them play a charity reunion gig, playing Goteki and Sneaky Bat Machine songs at Elektrowerkz in London, with former members Yan Yan, Crash and Sneaky Bat Machine's Maxislag. In August 2008, the fact that Lamorna sounded ever more like Goteki combined with the nostalgia that the charity gig evoked prompted Ross Tregenza to announce the reformation of Goteki. Their first act as a reformed band was to compile their material to date as a 'best of' album. It was released digitally in January 2009 under the name 'ROBOTS NINJAS PORNSTARS WARFARE: The Best of Goteki 2000-2008' Shows in Bristol, Oxford and London in May and June 2008 saw the return of Goteki with the new full line up. Tregenza and Ali Star were rejoined by longtime member Clive Lewis and new female vocalist Banda. Banda was also slated to appear as co-singer on a number of 5 track EPs the band advertised as coming out throughout the Summer of 2009. Promoting the release schedule as 'The Summer of Santa Muerte', the band announced the first of the four EPs to be 'Shoot Me Dead' to be released 4 July, followed by 'Journey To Storyville' on 25 July. These were followed in August by 'Atlantic Pacific' and 'Take Me To Your Lover'. A full album 'Santa Muerte' was slated for release in the winter. Promotional flyers claimed the album would be a 'tornado of sex, death, sand & neon'. 'Santa Muerte' is finally released in January 2011 after some production delays, and met with acclaim from fans and press.

Opened in November 2004, it is home to the university's Bulldog basketball programs, members of the West Coast Conference (WCC) in Division I of the NCAA. Often called \\"The New Kennel,\\" its nickname was inherited from the school's former basketball arena, Charlotte Y. Martin Centre, popularly known as \\"The Kennel,\\" which had been home to the Bulldogs for 39 years. As the MAC has become the established basketball arena on campus, more fans have begun calling it simply \\"The Kennel,\\" with the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre being known as the \\"Martin Centre.\\" The elevation of the court is approximately above sea level. History Ground was broken in April 2003 on the site of the baseball venue, Pecarovich Field. The arena's naming rights went to the McCarthey brothers of Salt Lake City, as a result of major gifts by Gonzaga trustee Philip McCarthey and regent Thomas McCarthey; both are GU alumni and former owners of The Salt Lake Tribune. The new baseball stadium was later built to the south and opened in in the interim, Bulldogs played at Avista Stadium, home of the minor league Spokane Indians of the short-season Northwest League. McCarthey Athletic Center opened in autumn 2004 on November 19, a 98–80 non-conference win over Portland State. In its second season, it hosted the WCC post-season tournament in March 2006; it was the event's first time in Spokane, as the original \\"Kennel\\" was considered too small and the larger Spokane Arena was unavailable due to annual scheduling conflicts. Gonzaga narrowly won its two games: the semifinal with San Diego went to overtime, and the final over Loyola Marymount was won by a single point. By February 2007, Gonzaga had 38 consecutive wins in the arena and a 50-game winning streak at home dating back to the Martin Centre. The Santa Clara Broncos ended what was, at the time, the longest home win streak in the NCAA. In February 2015, BYU snapped Gonzaga's 41-game home winning streak in the McCarthey Athletic Center, which was also the longest active home winning streak in the NCAA at the time. Through February 6, 2020, the Zags are in the McCarthey Athletic Center, which includes a record in non-conference games, a record in conference games, and a record in the WCC Tournament.

A coalition is said to improve upon or block a feasible allocation if the members of that coalition are better off under another feasible allocation that is identical to the first except that every member of the coalition has a different consumption bundle that is part of an aggregate consumption bundle that can be constructed from publicly available technology and the initial endowments of each consumer in the coalition. An allocation is said to have the core property if there is no coalition that can improve upon it. The core is the set of all feasible allocations with the core property. Origin The idea of the core already appeared in the writings of , at the time referred to as the contract curve. Even if von Neumann and Morgenstern considered it an interesting concept, they only worked with zero-sum games where the core is always empty. The modern definition of the core is due to Gillies. Definition Consider a transferable utility cooperative game (N,v) where N denotes the set of players and v is the characteristic function. An imputation x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^N is dominated by another imputation y if there exists a coalition C, such that each player in C prefers y, formally: x_i\\\\leq y_i for all i\\\\in C and there exists i\\\\in C such that x_i and C can enforce y (by threatening to leave the grand coalition to form C), formally: \\\\sum_{i\\\\in C}y_i\\\\leq v(C). An imputation x is dominated if there exists an imputation y dominating it. The core is the set of imputations that are not dominated.As noted by due to the contribution of Mr. E. Kohlberg Properties * Another definition, equivalent to the one above, states that the core is a set of payoff allocations x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^N satisfying #Efficiency: \\\\sum_{i\\\\in N}x_i=v(N), #Coalitional rationality: \\\\sum_{i\\\\in C}x_i\\\\geq v(C) for all subsets (coalitions) C\\\\subseteq N. * The core is always well-defined, but can be empty. * The core is a set which satisfies a system of weak linear inequalities. Hence the core is closed and convex. * The Bondareva–Shapley theorem: the core of a game is nonempty if and only if the game is \\"balanced\\". * Every Walrasian equilibrium has the core property, but not vice versa. The Edgeworth conjecture states that, given additional assumptions, the limit of the core as the number of consumers goes to infinity is a set of Walrasian equilibria. * Let there be n players, where n is odd. A game that proposes to divide one unit of a good among a coalition having at least (n+1)/2 members has an empty core. That is, no stable coalition exists. Example=Example 1: Miners Consider a group of n miners, who have discovered large bars of gold. If two miners can carry one piece of gold, then the payoff of a coalition S is :v(S) = \\\\begin{cases} S/2, & \\\\text{if }S\\\\text{ is even}; \\\\ (S-1)/2, & \\\\text{if }S\\\\text{ is odd}. \\\\end{cases} If there are more than two miners and there is an even number of miners, then the core consists of the single payoff where each miner gets 1/2. If there is an odd number of miners, then the core is empty. Example 2: Gloves Mr A and Mr B are knitting gloves. The gloves are one-size-fits-all, and two gloves make a pair that they sell for €5. They have each made three gloves. How to share the proceeds from the sale? The problem can be described by a characteristic function form game with the following characteristic function: Each man has three gloves, that is one pair with a market value of €5. Together, they have 6 gloves or 3 pair, having a market value of €15. Since the singleton coalitions (consisting of a single man) are the only non-trivial coalitions of the game all possible distributions of this sum belong to the core, provided both men get at least €5, the amount they can achieve on their own. For instance (7.5, 7.5) belongs to the core, but so does (5, 10) or (9, 6). Example 3: Shoes For the moment ignore shoe sizes: a pair consists of a left and a right shoe, which can then be sold for €10. Consider a game with 2001 players: 1000 of them have 1 left shoe, 1001 have 1 right shoe. The core of this game is somewhat surprising: it consists of a single imputation that gives 10 to those having a (scarce) left shoe, and 0 to those owning an (oversupplied) right shoe. No coalition can block this outcome, because no left shoe owner will accept less than 10, and any imputation that pays a positive amount to any right shoe owner must pay less than 10000 in total to the other players, who can get 10000 on their own. So, there is just one imputation in the core. The message remains the same, even if we increase the numbers as long as left shoes are scarcer. The core has been criticized for being so extremely sensitive to oversupply of one type of player. The core in general equilibrium theory The Walrasian equilibria of an exchange economy in a general equilibrium model, will lie in the core of the cooperation game between the agents. Graphically, and in a two-agent economy (see Edgeworth Box), the core is the set of points on the contract curve (the set of Pareto optimal allocations) lying between each of the agents' indifference curves defined at the initial endowments. The core in voting theory When alternatives are allocations (list of consumption bundles), it is natural to assume that any nonempty subsets of individuals can block a given allocation. When alternatives are public (such as the amount of a certain public good), however, it is more appropriate to assume that only the coalitions that are large enough can block a given alternative. The collection of such large (\\"winning\\") coalitions is called a simple game. The core of a simple game with respect to a profile of preferences is based on the idea that only winning coalitions can reject an alternative x in favor of another alternative y. A necessary and sufficient condition for the core to be nonempty for all profile of preferences, is provided in terms of the Nakamura number for the simple game.

The game has also been re-released in various emulated collections, such as the Virtual Console, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection, and Sega Forever. A prequel to the game, The Legend of Oasis, was released for the Sega Saturn in 1996. Plot The player takes the role of Prince Ali, who has discovered a buried gold \\"armlet\\" which once belonged to a wizard who waged a long war against the evil wielder of a silver armlet. The silver armlet was used to create chaos and destruction, while the gold armlet had the power to summon four spirits: the water spirit, \\"Dytto\\"; the fire spirit, \\"Efreet\\"; the shadow spirit, \\"Shade\\"; and the plant spirit, \\"Bow\\". Ali travels the land of Oasis, gradually acquiring the ability to summon all these spirits, in an attempt to stop the person who has discovered the ancient silver armlet and is once again using it for evil. Gameplay The game has action adventure elements similar to The Legend of Zelda series. The player controls Prince Ali and takes him across the maps to fulfill his quest. Along the way the player picks up special items to restore health and magic, special weapons to help defeat enemies, and four magic spirits found in shrines to aid Prince Ali's mission. Prince Ali's default weapon is his knife, which can perform special attacks and has unlimited usage. Also during the course of the game the player can equip Prince Ali with special weapons such as swords, crossbows, and bombs. Some crossbows (and a sword) can ignite their targets on fire. However, unlike the knife, these weapons do not have unlimited usage and will break after a set number of uses.

Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it a 38/50 (7.6/10 average), praising the vast game world and strong plot twists. A reviewer for Next Generation contended that the combination of RPG and action elements results in a game which is average on both fronts. He added that, \\"The use of magic, whether it be the fireball or meteor storm; a user-friendly interface; and an ever-ready map put Beyond Oasis beyond others of its type. But ultimately, poor fighting and an uninspired storyline leave this title looking more like a mirage.\\" GamePro commented that the game \\"is definitely not for hardcore RPGers\\" due to its small game world, limited challenge, and greater emphasis on hack-n-slash combat and puzzle solving than on RPG elements, but would be a good game for players new to the RPG genre. They praised the \\"intriguing\\" gameplay and the 3D feel of the graphics.

The arena has a current seating capacity of 12,515 people. The arena serves as home of the New Mexico State Aggies Men's and Women's Basketball and Women's Volleyball teams. The arena hosted the 2007 and 2008 Western Athletic Conference Men's and Women's Basketball Tournaments as well as the 2007 WAC Volleyball Tournament. Construction By the late 1950s, the need for a new and larger on-campus arena at what was then New Mexico A&M; had become evident. Williams Gymnasium, built in 1938, had become too small as the school and its athletic programs grew. After Las Cruces High School opened a new campus less than one mile from A&M;'s campus in 1957, the Aggies began to play many of their home games in the high school's new 3,000–seat gymnasium. When alumnus Lou Henson returned to the school—which by then had been renamed New Mexico State—as head coach in 1966 and quickly began building the basketball program into a perennial NCAA Tournament participant, the push for a new facility began in earnest. In 1967, the New Mexico State Legislature approved a $22 million capital outlay program that included provisions for a new arena at NMSU (the same bill also funded construction of NMSU's student union building). Construction of the arena cost $3.5 million and the building was inaugurated on November 30, 1968, with a 95–89 victory over Colorado State. The facility's name was suggested by former NMSU vice president Paul Rader for its location just off Interstate 25, also known as the Pan American Highway. Playing floor Throughout its history the Pan Am has featured a distinctive parquet–style playing floor, making it one of only a handful of NCAA venues to feature a parquet floor. The original floor was installed in 1968 and served until being damaged in a flood inside the arena in 1986. Following the flood a new floor was acquired and installed during the 1986–87 season. This floor served through the end of the 2011 volleyball season and basketball preseason exhibition games. A new parquet floor, the arena's third, was dedicated prior to the 2011–12 men's basketball regular season home opener against UTEP on November 19, 2011. The court is named in honor of former long-time head coach Lou Henson. Aggie success in the Pan Am The university's investment paid quick dividends as the Aggies won their first ten games in the new building before falling to archrival New Mexico on January 29. The Aggies wouldn't lose again on the Pan Am's parquet floor until dropping the 1971–72 season opener to Angelo State, snapping an amazing 34–game home winning streak over the course of three seasons. During the Pan Am's first three seasons NMSU compiled a gaudy 44–1 record within its friendly confines. The Aggies qualified for their third consecutive NCAA Tournament in the building's inaugural year and hosted BYU in an opening round matchup at the Pan Am on March 8, 1969 – a 74–62 Aggie victory. The next year saw the most successful season in school history to date as the \\"Amazin' Aggies\\" advanced to the NCAA Final Four before falling to eventual national champion UCLA in the national semifinal. Three days later the Aggies bounced back to defeat St. Bonaventure in the now–defunct Consolation game to finish the season third in the nation. Although the phenomenal success enjoyed by the Aggies during the arena's first few seasons would not continue, the Pan Am would continue to establish a reputation as an extremely difficult place to play. To date the Aggies have compiled four undefeated seasons at home and only twice in 43 seasons has NMSU had a losing home record (1984–85 and 2004–05). NMSU's women's basketball team has also compiled a pair of undefeated home seasons in the building. The Pan Am has seen home winning streaks of more than 25 games on three separate occasions – twice by the men's basketball team (34 games from 1968 to 1971 and 29 games from 1989 to 1991) and once by the women's basketball team (38 games from 1986 to 1988). Among the most memorable games in the Pan Am's history are NMSU's heartbreaking 91–89 overtime loss to Larry Bird's #2–ranked Indiana State squad on February 2, 1979 (the then-undefeated Sycamores' closest call until losing to Michigan State in that year's legendary national title game); a 72–64 win over New Mexico on December 15, 1990 that saw an all–time record 14,845 fans squeeze into the arena, a nationally televised 83–82 upset of #7–ranked eventual national champion UNLV on January 8, 1990 and the Aggies' thrilling 72–70 defeat of Utah State in the 2007 WAC Tournament Championship Game that clinched the Aggies' seventeenth NCAA Tournament appearance. During the Aggies' run of success in the early 1990s the Pan Am became known as one of the toughest venues in the nation for visiting teams. The often–raucous crowds led Dick Vitale to nickname the building the \\"Pandemonium Center\\" and refer to the student section as the \\"Panamaniacs.\\" Vitale named the building the Big West Conference's toughest venue in the 1998 and 1999 editions of Dick Vitale's College Basketball Preview. 2006–07 renovation In 2005, the New Mexico State Legislature approved funding for a $23 million renovation of the Pan American Center. Included in the renovation was the construction of a new annex at the building's south end housing new locker room facilities, athletic and special events offices, and support facilities. Additionally, the older part of the arena was thoroughly renovated, more than tripling the number of restrooms and concession facilities in the building and adding a new, larger concourse around the circumference of the arena. The renovations caused a brief throwback to the 1960s pre–Pan Am era, as several events (most notably virtually the entire 2006 home volleyball schedule) were moved to Las Cruces High School, as NMSU lacks another facility on campus that could accommodate any significant number of fans. The LCHS arrangement proved a very beneficial one in terms of on-court success as the volleyball Aggies compiled the first undefeated home season in school history while playing all but two home matches at LCHS, including an epic 5-game upset of Hawaii that ended Nā Wahine's eight–year WAC winning streak. Although the renovation was scheduled for completion by the beginning of the 2006–07 basketball season construction delays caused the renovation to drag on throughout the season. Most controversially, the access tunnel linking the new locker rooms in the annex to the arena floor was not completed until February, forcing both the Aggies and the opposition, along with the referees, to enter the arena via the stands for much of the season, Due to the building's layout, opposing teams had to enter and leave the court through the student section behind the south goal, causing several visiting teams (particularly WAC opponents) to publicly complain about the arrangement. The new tunnel was first used for the January 31 game against Boise State. The renovations were ultimately completed just in time for the start of the 2007 WAC Tournament, with finishing touches being applied in the final days before the event began. Other events In addition to its extensive history as a collegiate basketball venue, the Pan American Center has been a prolific host to a wide variety of concerts and special events in its five decades of service. Former Special Events director Barbara Hubbard once remarked that \\"it would be easier to compile a list of major recording acts that had not played the Pan Am than it would be to name all those that had.\\" For many years the building was a natural stop for many concert tours, as it was the largest venue along Interstate 10 between Houston and Phoenix. However, the construction of newer comparably sized venues in El Paso and Tucson, combined with New Mexico's gross receipts tax on concerts and special events, has led to a significant decline in the number of events scheduled at the arena. The 2006–07 renovation and a new state law exempting the Pan Am from the gross receipts tax were both approved in part to help the arena once again become more competitive in booking major acts. The arena is now seen as an alternative to the similarly–sized Don Haskins Center which was originally built as such to this arena. Beyond its prolific concert resume, the Pan Am has seen a wide variety of other events, from bull riding events to professional wrestling and boxing matches. Among the more notable events held in the arena are the 1996 Miss Teen USA pageant, presidential speeches (most recently a campaign stop by George W. Bush in 2004) and the annual Las Cruces International Mariachi Conference. The arena also hosts the university's annual fall and spring commencement ceremonies as well as those of several area high schools. The arena has also occasionally hosted the New Mexico State High School Basketball Tournament when the event's usual venue in Albuquerque was unavailable due to scheduling conflicts.

The arena was renamed in 2000 for Temple University President, Peter J. Liacouras. It is part of a $107 million, four-building complex along North Broad Street on the Temple University campus in North Philadelphia. The Liacouras Center is the largest indoor, public assembly venue in Philadelphia north of City Hall.  History  During the 1980s, Temple basketball coach John Chaney sought to raise the profile of the men's basketball program through aggressively scheduling top- tier, out of conference opponents. Some programs, however, scoffed at the idea of playing at Temple's 3,900-seat on-campus arena, McGonigle Hall. Temple's President at the time, Peter J. Liacouras, supported the idea of a larger basketball facility in hopes of building Temple's national presence. Temple considered several locations and a site was purchased in 1988 for $7.3 million. The state of Pennsylvania awarded Temple $31.1 million in October 1992, despite disagreements between Chaney and then-City Council president John Street. The project was approved in 1995, with a January 25, 1996 groundbreaking. Two nationally recognized architectural firms designed the building: Vitetta Group of Philadelphia, and Thompson Ventulett Stainback & Associates of Atlanta. The venue opened in the 1997-98 season. The first game played was a 76-61 Temple win over #18 Fresno State. The venue was originally named The Apollo of Temple. The name changed to the Liacouras Center just prior to Liacouras' retirement on February 13, 2000. The Liacouras Center is managed by Global Spectrum, a subsidiary of Comcast-Spectacor. The Liacouras Center is Philadelphia's largest indoor venue north of City Hall and hosts home games for all of Temple men's basketball, along with some women's games. As of the end of the 2016-17 season, the Owls have amassed a 206-69 record in the building. The Esther Boyer Theater at the Liacouras Center is a small theater setup of 1,000 to 5,000 seats for more intimate presentations. The complex also houses the Independence Blue Cross Recreation Center (IBC), which includes a gym, basketball court, racquetball courts, and more. The IBC opened in the spring semester of 1998. The fourth building in the complex is a 1,200-space parking garage. Use beyond basketball Besides hosting Temple basketball games, the Liacouras Center is a full entertainment arena featuring concerts, family shows, Philadelphia KiXX games, Philly Roller Derby bouts, a full range of concerts, dramatic presentations, and family shows. Additionally, several high school graduations, as well as university graduations and convocation ceremonies, are held there. On October 16, 2019 All Elite Wrestling held its third televised professional wrestling event at the Liacouras Center, broadcast on the TNT network in the United States. In March 2020, the Liacouras Center was transformed into a field hospital with 200 beds arranged on the court in anticipation of a surge in need due to the COVID-19 pandemic and shortages in city hospitals. At the end of April 2020, operations of the field hospital began winding down as the rate of new COVID-19 cases in Philadelphia began to decline.

Established in 1987, it provides further education in the north Essex area. History The College is located on the former site of the Gilberd School. Recently constructed parts of the building were designed by local architects Martin Wilesmith and Bob Ward of the Roff Marsh Partnership. In 1994 Blur played a show at the college – three out of four members of Blur have links with Colchester, with drummer Dave Rowntree having attended the Gilberd School. In 2013, the college served as the backdrop for a submission in the official Brian May and Kerry Ellis crowdsourced music video for \\"The Kissing Me Song\\". A portion of the submission can be seen in the subsequent concert release \\"The Candlelight Concerts: Live in Montreux 2013\\". Courses The College offers courses and qualifications to more than 3100 students – including a large range of AS-Levels and A-Levels; GCSEs; and since 2003, the International Baccalaureate. It is mandatory for students studying AS/A-levels to take at least 3 academic subjects; most AS-level courses cover seven periods per week, while most A-level courses cover eight periods per week. Additional studies An extensive Additional Studies programme is run to suit individual interests or to support a career aim. Most courses run over two terms for between one and three periods a week, and some lead to nationally recognised qualifications. The college's music Additional Studies are notable. It has an orchestra, a band, a choir, and has many music events throughout the year. Instrumental lessons are provided at college at a subsidised cost, and students taking music A-level or IB receive half an hour's free music tuition each week. The Essex Music Foundation also pays for the college's students to take grade 5 and 8 instrumental and theory exams, using the exam board ABRSM.

It is primarily used for football, and it is the home field of the Ball State University Cardinals. The stadium opened in 1967, and it has a capacity of 22,500 for football games. History Anticipating rapid growth after transitioning from a teacher's college to a large state school, the Ball State University Board of Trustees approved construction of a new athletic stadium one mile north of campus in 1965. The stadium was completed in 1967 with a capacity of 16,000 for football. It replaced the previous stadium closer to campus, on University Avenue across from Ball Memorial Hospital. The site is now used as a band practice field. A grandstand on the south end of the stadium was added in the 1990s, increasing the capacity to 22,500. In 2005, the stadium was renamed after Ball State alumni and benefactors John B. and June M. Scheumann. Today In 2007, a $13 million renovation of the stadium was completed. Planned improvements included new lighting for night games, enclosing the north end zone with lawn seating to create a 22,500-seat horseshoe-shaped venue, new concession stands, a brick facade, a larger press box, and private luxury suites. On August 29, 2013, a new video board was installed. For a time, notable Ball State alumnus David Letterman jokingly campaigned via his television program to have the stadium named after him. When the stadium was named after the Scheumanns for their donations to the university, Indianapolis mayor Bart Peterson joked that the city would rename the I-465 Beltway as the David Letterman Expressway. Indianapolis was Letterman's childhood home town. Records Mean game attendance at the stadium was at the highest in school history in 2008, with an average of about 21,000 visitors per game. This can be attributed to the team's success, as well as recent renovations to the stadium. A school record 10,546 students attended the September 6, 2008 game versus the Navy Midshipmen. The game was televised nationally on ESPN, and Ball State won, 35–23. The all-time record attendance for a game at Scheumann Stadium is 23,861, set on November 25, 2008 when Ball State completed an undefeated regular season by beating MAC rival Western Michigan. The Cardinals won handily, 45–22, pushing their record to 12–0, but they lost to Buffalo in the MAC championship game and to Tulsa in the GMAC Bowl.

William Chappell transcribed the lyrics in his two-volume work The Ballad Literature and Popular Music of the Olden Time (1855). \\"The Barley Mow\\" has become a drinking song sung while comrades empty their glasses. In one \\"Barley Mow\\" drinking game, any participant who fails to sing the song's (progressively expanding) refrain in a single breath must drink. In another, participants drink just after singing the second line in each verse (\\"Good luck to the barley mow\\"); if one's glass is not empty by the final verse, one must finish the drink after singing the line. A barley mow is a stack (mow) of barley, especially barley that was cultivated and then harvested. Barley is a grain that is commonly malted for brewing beer. Lyrics The verses of \\"The Barley Mow\\" wish good luck to various sizes of vessels of alcoholic beverages, and lastly to the barley mow, a venerable reserve of one of beer's key ingredients. Later verses supplement this list with roles and occupations associated with beer, from brewing, to distribution, to serving in public houses, to drinking. Each verse wishes good luck to a new subject, which is then added to the beginning of the litany recited in the second line of the refrain. The song has several variations. The 12 terms between landlord and round bowl are English units—particularly units used to measure the volume of alcoholic beverages. These are sung in descending order from largest (barrel) to smallest (round bowl). Round bowl (sometimes sung brown bowl) indicates either a humble, wooden bowl, or a person's hands cupped together into the shape of a bowl. It can also refer to the small bowl suspended from the tap in a beer barrel that catches the drips. Company refers to the party of people gathered together singing the song. A slavey is a female servant, who assists in the brewing process. A drayer is a person who transports heavy loads of goods (such as barrels of beer) in a type of horse-drawn cart called a dray.

Founded in 1891 it was primarily designed for student instruction and also research. The facility operated a regional timekeeping service. It was responsible for the care and calibration of clocks on campus including one at Carrie Tower and another that rang the class bell at University Hall. Meteorological observations were made there from the time the building opened using recording weather instruments. In addition to general astronomy courses it was also used for teaching civil engineering topics such as geodesy. Nautical science subjects, including celestial navigation, were taught there during the First World War. Ladd began a regular schedule of open nights for public viewing in 1930. This led to the creation of the Skyscrapers amateur astronomy society in 1932 which regularly met at Ladd. The Skyscrapers then acquired the Seagrave Observatory in 1936 which was then used as a meeting place. Amateur astronomers from the group continued to volunteer at Ladd and also participated in Brown University solar eclipse expeditions. Members constructed a Schmidt camera for the 1937 Brown eclipse expedition. Ladd was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. It continues to be used by the Department of Physics at Brown for astronomy instruction. It is regularly open to the public as a science center and technology museum.  Construction  The observatory is named for benefactor Herbert W. Ladd who offered to fund the construction in the spring of 1889. The building was designed by the Providence-based firm of Stone, Carpenter & Willson in the Classical Revival style. The selected site was the highest point in Providence at the time, on what was once known as Tintop Hill on the East Side. Construction began in May 1890 and the building was dedicated on October 21, 1891. The total cost of construction and equipping the facility in 1891 was , .  Telescopes  A filar micrometer attached to the main telescope, 1890s. The primary telescope is a refractor with a aperture objective and focal length of . The lens was figured by John Brashear following the design of Charles S. Hastings. The crown glass was made by Mantois of Paris and the flint glass by the optical works at Jena in Germany. The equatorial mount and mechanical clock drive were made by George N. Saegmuller. This telescope was used for scientific work such as lunar occultation timings to make a more precise determination of the orbit of the Moon. Instruments such as a filar micrometer could be attached to the telescope. Another telescope, a meridian circle instrument, also made by Saegmuller, was used for observations related to timekeeping. Similar, but smaller, instruments were used for student instruction.  Timekeeping  The 1895 Howard regulator formerly used to ring the bell at University Hall. As a number of other observatories did in the late Ladd provided an accurate regional timekeeping service by transmitting a time signal via telegraph wire. Observations of select stars were made with the meridian circle instrument as the star transited (or crossed) the meridian. This data was then used to calibrate a high quality pendulum clock set to keep sidereal time. Calculations were then performed to convert sidereal time to local standard time. A second clock keeping standard time was equipped with a telegraphics break circuit mechanism to automatically generate the time signals. These precision clocks were known as astronomical regulators. Timekeeping instruments used at Ladd include regulators made by Robert Molyneux, Edward Howard, Hezekiah Conant, and Sigmund Riefler. Advertisement for the RIEP telegraph time service, 1900. Prior to the Ladd time service the city relied on time signals from either Harvard College Observatory or the United States Naval Observatory that were transmitted via Western Union Telegraph wires. In many cases these signals were found to be inaccurate due to tranmission delay or accidents. Time signals from Ladd were first sent on September 12, 1893. The observatory sold these time signals to Rhode Island Electric Protective (RIEP) company, a local fire and burglar alarm firm. The signals from Ladd were redistributed to RIEP customers including \\"jewelers\\" (i.e. clockmakers) who repaired and calibrated watches. The signals were also used to directly control a clock network of several hundred slave clocks in various business offices. The revenue that the university received from the time signal service in 1906 was () per year. Another telegraph wire connected the observatory to the Fire Department at City Hall which was used to signal the accurate time to the community by fire alarm bells at noon and 8:30 p.m. every day. Time signals from Ladd were also used to synchronize the regulator used to ring the bell in the cupola of University Hall on the main campus. The bell marked the beginning and end of class periods. Ladd first received experimental wireless time signals from the Naval Observatory in November 1913. The purpose of the experiment was to measure the difference in longitude between Washington and Providence. The signals were transmitted by the Navy radio facility NAA in Arlington, Virginia. In 1915 Brown installed a sophisticated \\"wireless plant\\" consisting of a antenna strung between a tower on University Hall and another tower on Maxcy Hall. The operator's station with transmitting and receiving equipment was located in the basement of Wilson Hall, a building midway between the two towers. Primarily intended for engineering instruction and physics experimentation it was also used to receive the time signals from Arlington. On November 24, 1916 the transit instrument observations were discontinued and the clocks were instead calibrated by the NAA signals. The transit observations resumed on April 10, 1917 due to a US government order to dismantle the radio set at Ladd when the U.S. entered the First World War. These calibration observations continued through October 16, 1919. A 1930s Hammarlund Comet Pro shortwave radio used to receive time signals. Calibration by Naval Observatory time signals from radio station WWV resumed after the war ended. These early transmissions were longwave, so called due to the long wavelength. Frequencies, and corresponding wavelengths, from to were used. These transmissions required special equipment such as the installation at Wilson Hall to receive them. By the 1930s it had become common to use a simple and inexpensive shortwave radio of the kind used to receive broadcast programs. This radio could also be used to receive time signal transmissions from Greenwich, Paris, and Berlin. The radio was directly wired to the clock circuits to allow recording the time signals. The sirens on fire stations continued to sound at noon using the time signals from Ladd until at least 1955. Clocks in a number of buildings in Providence were regulated using the signals from Ladd late into the . After determining no one was receiving the time signals, the transmissions were discontinued in 1973.  Associations  Scientists affiliated with the observatory include Winslow Upton, Frank Washington Very, Frederick Slocum, Robert Horace Baker, and Charles H. Smiley. Notable graduates from Brown or Pembroke who performed work at Ladd include Slocum (A.B. 1895, Ph.D. 1898), Leah Allen (A.B. 1907), and Harlan True Stetson (B.S. 1912). H. P. Lovecraft, author of weird fiction, had free access to the observatory for several years. He wrote astronomy articles for Providence newspapers based upon his study there between 1906 and 1918.

It is primarily used for American football, and has been the home field of the Princeton Tigers since 1998. The stadium seats 27,773. Since 2007, the playing surface has been known as Powers Field at Princeton Stadium. Princeton Stadium was viewed as a long-overdue replacement for Palmer Stadium, the Tigers' former home, an 83-year-old \\"dinosaur\\". It sits on the same site as its predecessor; because of the demolition and construction work, the Tigers played all of their 1997 games on the road. The stadium opened September 19, 1998, as a capacity crowd of 27,800 witnessed the Tigers defeat Cornell, 6-0.  Design  The stadium's exterior shell mirrors the layout of Palmer Stadium, and the grandstands are four sided, with a second deck added on all sides except the south. The press box and luxury boxes are located above the west-side upper deck. One of the stadium's structural pillars houses the university's rock-climbing wall, which opened in the fall of 2008. In addition to the stadium itself, the construction project included building a track to the immediate south of the football field, which shares the stadium's south end facilities. Previously, the track was inside the stadium. For most of its first decade, Princeton Stadium had a natural grass surface. Since 2006, the facility has featured FieldTurf. The heightened resiliency of the artificial surface allows the football team to conduct its spring practice in the stadium. Princeton's sprint football team holds most of its practices inside the stadium, while the football team holds practices on the neighboring Campbell and Finney fields.  Naming  While under construction, the stadium was referred to simply as \\"Princeton University Stadium\\", as the university hoped an alumnus would step forward to purchase the naming rights for a \\"leadership gift\\" of at least $25 million. Princeton officials said they would not name the stadium after a corporation, but considered honoring a Princeton graduate in exchange for a donation to be in keeping with their naming standards for other university buildings. Naming rights remained unsold by the time the stadium opened in September 1998, though the stadium's name was shortened to \\"Princeton Stadium\\" in time for the first football game. The offer to name the stadium after a donor still applied. Though the stadium's name did not change, the playing field was dedicated as Powers Field in 2007 to honor investor William C. Powers, whose $10 million donation funded the installation of artificial FieldTurf in 2006, as well as renovations of two practice fields. Powers, a 1979 graduate of Princeton, was a standout defensive back and punter for the Tigers. Records Since the stadium's opening, only two Princeton Tigers have rushed for over 200 yards in a single game at home: Cameron Atkinson ran for 233 yards against Dartmouth on November 23, 2002, and all-Ivy junior running back Jordan Culbreath rushed for 276 yards against Dartmouth on November 22, 2008.

History Coarsegold has previously had several names, including Coarse Gold, Gold Gulch, Michaels, Oro Grosso, Texas Flat,All and Coarse Gold Gulch. The place was first called Texas Flat after miners from Texas discovered gold there in 1849. By 1874, the name had changed to Michaels, honoring Charles Michaels, a local merchant. A rival mining camp inhabited by Mexicans there was called Oro Grosso, the Spanish translation of coarse gold. The current name derives from the California Gold Rush of the mid-19th century, when prospectors discovered coarse nuggets of gold in a nearby creek. At one time, several dozen gold mines operated in the area. The Coarse Gold Gulch post office opened in 1878, changed the name to Goldgulch in 1895 and to Coarsegold in 1899.

He is best known for his regular appearances on the 1960s and 1970s UK children's television show Vision On. Early life and career Lunn was born in Rastrick, West Yorkshire, England to deaf parents. His upbringing was to later allow him to teach lip-reading as well as religious education at Odsal House School for the Deaf in Bradford. In the first part of this self-made interview video series \\"My Best Cellar\\", available through his website, Lunn claims he was \\"brought up in a cellar by deaf mutes\\". The parents of actor James Mason lived on the same street as Lunn who met Mason when he was visiting them. Mason introduced Lunn to agent Blanche Marvin. Lunn had already written a television play entitled Benny Rolly which, unusually for the time, was without dialogue and Marvin thought it would be of interest to the deaf. She arranged an interview with Patrick Dowling the producer of BBC's Vision On and Lunn took along some of his models to demonstrate. Dowling was unable to employ Lunn but suggested an exhibition of his cycles. On the opening night of the exhibition, which had been arranged by Marvin, TV presenter Joan Bakewell visited and invited Lunn to appear on Late Night Line-Up that night. This was Lunn's first television appearance. Lunn was later invited to appear on the children's TV show Magpie on which he spoke on a variety of subjects including bottles and the history of the domestic smoothing iron. Meanwhile Dowling approached Lunn with a request to make a 'door-bell machine'. Lunn constructed the device and appeared with it on Vision On. Lunn would go to appear on the programme for many years, with Tony Hart and Sylvester McCoy, demonstrating his latest inventions. He later appeared in several other series, including Jigsaw and Eureka. Lunn is a prolific constructor of novelty bicycles and an inventor of strange devices, amongst which was a collection formerly to be found in the Inventions Bar, Newcastle upon Tyne. Lunn has also appeared as an after-dinner speaker for many functions including the Edinburgh School of Architecture Winter School, and the Society of Industrial Artists Golden Jubilee. He has also been a member of the panel of judges for the World Disco Championship. When asked, in an interview with the b3ta website, \\"In the event of the end of the world, what would be the last thing you'd do before death?\\" Lunn answered: \\"I'm constantly being told at the end I would turn to God.

Mixers help automate the repetitive tasks of stirring, whisking or beating. When the beaters are replaced by a dough hook, a mixer may also be used to knead.  Description  A mixer may be a handheld mechanism known as an eggbeater, a handheld motorized beater, or a drill mixer. Stand mixers vary in size from small counter top models for home use to large capacity commercial machines. Stand mixers create the mixing action by either rotating the mixing device vertically (planetary mixers), or by rotating the mixing container (spiral mixers). History The mixer with rotating parts was patented in 1856 by Baltimore, Maryland tinner Ralph Collier. This was followed by E.P. Griffith's whisk patented in England in 1857. Another hand-turned rotary egg beater was patented by J.F. and E.P. Monroe in 1859 in the US. Their egg beater patent was one of the earliest bought up by the Dover Stamping Company, whose Dover egg beaters became a classic American brand. The Monroe design was also manufactured in England. In 1870, Turner Williams of Providence, R.I., invented another Dover egg beater model. In 1894, Willis Johnson of Cincinnati, Ohio invented new improvements to the egg beater. Whisking egg whites with a handheld electric mixer The first mixer with electric motor is thought to be the one invented by American Rufus Eastman in 1885. The Hobart Manufacturing Company was an early manufacturer of large commercial mixers, and they say a new model introduced in 1914 played a key role in the mixer part of their business. The Hobart KitchenAid and Sunbeam Mixmaster (first produced 1910) were two very early US brands of electric mixer. Domestic electric mixers were rarely used before the 1920s, when they were adopted more widely for home use. In 1908 Herbert Johnson, an engineer for the Hobart Manufacturing Company, invented an electric standing mixer. His inspiration came from observing a baker mixing bread dough with a metal spoon; soon he was toying with a mechanical counterpart. By 1915, his 20 gallon (80 l) mixer was standard equipment for most large bakeries. In 1919, Hobart introduced the Kitchen Aid Food Preparer (stand mixer) for the home. Older models of mixers originally listed each speed by name of operation (ex: Beat-Whip would be high speed if it is a 3-speed mixer); they are now listed by number. Variants=Eggbeater A vintage hand-cranked egg beater An eggbeater is a handheld device with a crank on the side geared to one or more beaters. The user grips the handle with one hand and operates the crank with the other, creating the rotary action. Stand mixer A large volume stand mixer used in a commercial bakery to mix bread dough with a double sided dough hook A stand mixer in action on a home tabletop, with a wire whisk attachment Stand mixers mount the motor driving the rotary action in a frame or stand which bears the weight of the device. Stand mixers are larger and have more powerful motors than their hand-held counterparts. They generally have a special bowl that is locked in place while the mixer is operating. A typical home stand mixer will include a wire whisk for whipping creams and egg whites; a flat beater for mixing batters; and a dough hook for kneading. Stand mixers are generally available in either counter top (also called bench) or floor models. Heavy duty commercial models can have bowl capacities well in excess of 25 gallons (95 l) and weigh thousands of pounds (kilograms) but more typical home and light commercial models are equipped with bowls of around 1 gallon (4 l). Whether a mixer is a counter top or floor model depends on its size. Mixers that are 5 gallons (20 l) in size or smaller tend to be counter top mixers, while larger mixers tend to be floor models due to their size and weight. Spiral mixers are specialist tools for mixing dough. A spiral-shaped agitator counter-rotates while the powered bowl spins in the opposite direction. This method enables spiral mixers to mix the same size dough batch much quicker and with less under-mixed dough than a similarly powered planetary mixer. Spiral mixers can mix dough with less agitator friction than planetary mixers. This allows the dough to be mixed without increasing its temperature, ensuring the dough can rise properly. Spiral mixers are preferred for thicker products, such as dough for pizza, bagels or naan bread. Planetary mixers consist of a bowl and an agitator. The bowl remains static, whilst the agitator is rapidly moved around the bowl to mix its contents. With the ability to mix a wide variety of ingredients, planetary mixers are more versatile than their spiral counterparts. Planetary mixers can be used to whip and blend, whereas spiral mixers cannot. They are normally used in Australia, India and Europe too. The mixers are used all over world. Hand mixer A hand mixer is a hand-held mixing device. A handle is mounted over an enclosure containing the motor. The motor drives the beaters which are immersed in the food to perform the mixing action. The motor must be lightweight as it is supported by the user during use. The user may use any suitable kitchen container to hold the ingredients while mixing. The first handheld electric mixer patent was submitted by Sunbeam Corporation in 1953 and granted in 1961. Dough mixer A dough mixer is used for household or industrial purposes. It is used for kneading large quantities of dough. It is electrical, having timers and various controls to suit the user's needs. Some features of dough blenders include high speed, low speed and bowl reverse (these can be combined into a programme) and a kneading bar in the centre of the bowl.

The main difference between a mental space and a possible world is that a mental space does not contain a faithful representation of reality, but an idealized cognitive model. Building of mental spaces and establishment of mappings between those mental spaces are the two main processes involved in construction of meaning. It is one of the basic components in Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner's blending theory, a theory within Cognitive semantics.  Base space and built space  Base space, also known as reality space, presents the interlocutors' shared knowledge of the real world. Space builders are elements within a sentence that establish spaces distinct from, yet related to the base space constructed. Space builders can be expressions like prepositional phrases, adverbs, connectives, and subject-verb combinations that are followed by an embedded sentence. They require hearers to establish scenarios beyond the present point of time. A built space depicts a situation that only holds true for that space itself, but may or may not be true in reality. The base space and built spaces are occupied by elements that map onto each other. These elements include categories that may refer to specific entities in those categories. According to Fauconnier's Access Principle, specific entities of a category in a space can be described by its counterpart category in another space even if it differs from the specific entity in the other space. An example of a built space can be seen in the example \\" Mary wants to buy a book\\". In this case, the built space is not that of reality, but Mary's desire space. Though the book in reality space refers to any book in general, it can still be used to describe the book in Mary's desire space, which may or may not be a specific book...  Foundation and expansion space  ‘if A then B’ sentences create another two spaces called foundation space and expansion space in addition to the base space.

It serves as the home field for the Central Michigan University Chippewas. The stadium opened in 1972 and holds 30,255 spectators, making it the largest on-campus stadium in the Mid-American Conference. It is located on the southeast part of campus, along with most of the other athletic facilities. History The stadium was originally named Perry Shorts Stadium in honor of R. Perry Shorts, a Saginaw banker who was a 1900 graduate and a generous donor. The stadium, which originally seated approximately 20,000 spectators, was dedicated on November 4, 1972, when the Chippewas defeated Illinois State University, 28–21, before a Homecoming crowd of nearly 17,000. In June 1983, the CMU Board of Trustees voted to rename the facility Kelly/Shorts Stadium in honor of Kenneth \\"Bill\\" Kelly, who coached the Chippewa football team to a 91–58–2 record from 1951 to 1966. Renovations A $28 million expansion project following the 1997 season added 10,000 seats to the stadium, increasing its capacity to 30,199. A two- tiered press box, locker room, and nine guest suites also were included in the expansion project. The original artificial turf, the first to be used in the state of Michigan, has been replaced three times, most recently in 2016 when it was changed from Astroturf to FieldTurf. Permanent lights were installed before the 2006 season, making it the last stadium in the Mid-American Conference to do so. Features CMU's locker room, training room and equipment room are located in the stadium's north end zone, and the locker room is connected to the Indoor Athletic Complex (IAC) via a tunnel. The IAC houses the Dick Enberg Academic Center, coaches' offices, weight room, meeting rooms, CMU's Hall of Champions and indoor practice field with a wall-to-wall FieldTurf surface. Events The stadium has also been used as a site for other events, including high school football playoff games, concerts, and graduation ceremonies. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  Night Game vs. Western Michigan, October 1, 2016.

Early life Scappaticci was born around 1946 and grew up in the Markets area of Belfast, the son of Daniel Scappaticci, an Italian immigrant to the city in the 1920s. In 1962, at the age of 16, he was encouraged to sign for the football club Nottingham Forest although his father is said to have resisted the idea. He took up work as a bricklayer. He was fined for riotous assembly in 1970 after being caught up in the Troubles and, a year later, was interned without trial at the age of 25 as part of Operation Demetrius. Among those interned with him were figures later to become prominent in the republican movement, such as Ivor Bell, Gerry Adams, and Alex Maskey. He was released from detention in 1974 and was by this time a member of the Provisional IRA.By Scappaticci's own admission he joined the IRA in 1969, see interview with The Cook Report in External Links. IRA career By 1980, Scappaticci was a lead member in the Internal Security Unit (ISU) for the IRA Northern Command.\\"He did the IRA's dirty work for 25 years - and was paid £80,000 a year by the government\\", The Guardian, 12 May 2003; accessed 5 June 2014. The ISU was a unit tasked with counter-intelligence and the investigation of leaks within the IRA along with the exposure of moles/informers (also known as \\"touts\\"). Via the ISU, Scappaticci played a key role in investigating suspected informers, conducting inquiries into operations suspected of being compromised, debriefing of IRA volunteers released from Royal Ulster Constabulary and British Army questioning, and vetting of potential IRA recruits. The ISU has also been referred to as the \\"Nutting Squad\\". Various killings as a result of ISU activities have been attributed to Scappaticci.\\"Freddie Scappaticci was our most valuable spy in IRA during the Troubles\\", Belfast Telegraph; accessed 5 June 2014. After the original allegations broke in 2003, Scappaticci, by now living in the Riverdale area of West Belfast, claimed his involvement with the IRA ended in 1990 due to his wife's illness. He denied that he had ever been linked to any facet of the British intelligence services, including the Force Research Unit.Report on Scappaticci, rte.ie; 16 May 2003; accessed 5 June 2014. Involvement with British Intelligence Scappaticci's first involvement with British Intelligence is alleged to have been in 1978, two years before the Force Research Unit (FRU) was formed in 1980. He is said to have worked as an agent for the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) Special Branch. The role of the FRU was to centralise Army Intelligence under the Intelligence Corps. The former FRU agent turned whistleblower using the pseudonym \\"Martin Ingram\\" has said in his 2004 book Stakeknife that Scappaticci eventually developed into an agent handled by British Army Intelligence via the FRU. Ingram says that Scappaticci's activities as a high-grade intelligence source came to his attention in 1982 after Scappaticci was detained for a drunk driving offence. In 2003, Scappaticci was alleged to have volunteered as an informer in 1978 after being assaulted in an argument with a fellow IRA member. Ingram paints Scappaticci at this time as \\"the crown jewels\\", (the best) agent handled by the FRU. He cites a number of allegations against Scappaticci. His accusations centre on various individuals who died as a result of the activities of the ISU between 1980 and 1990. Ingram also alleges that Scappaticci disclosed information to British intelligence on IRA operations during the time period, involving: *IRA members involved in the kidnapping of wealthy Irish supermarket magnate Ben Dunne in 1981. Ingram alleges that Scappaticci was influential in identifying his kidnappers to the authorities. *the attempted kidnapping of Galen Weston, a Canadian born business tycoon in 1983. Weston kept a manor outside Dublin where the kidnapping was to take place. *the kidnapping of supermarket boss Don Tidey from his home in Rathfarnham in Dublin. Ingram alleges that Scappaticci tipped off the FRU on the details of the kidnapping which eventually resulted in the killings of a trainee Garda Síochána (Gary Sheehan) and an Irish Army soldier (Private Patrick Kelly). Aside from providing intelligence to the FRU, Scappaticci is alleged to have worked closely with his FRU handlers throughout the 1980s and 1990s to protect and promote his position within the IRA. The controversy that has arisen centres on the allegation by Ingram that Scappaticci's role as an informer was protected by the FRU through the deaths of those who might have been in a position to expose him as a British agent. On 11 April 2017, the BBC's Panorama programme featured a report on 'Stakeknife' entitled \\"The Spy in the IRA\\". Amongst those appearing are the current Northern Ireland Director of Public Prosecutions, Lord Stevens, 'Martin Ingram' and several others from Northern Ireland. Involvement with the Cook Report In 1993 Scappaticci approached the ITV programme The Cook Report and agreed to an interview on his activities in the IRA and the alleged role of Martin McGuinness in the organisation. The first interview took place on 26 August 1993 in the car park of the Culloden Hotel in Cultra, County Down. This interview was, unknown to Scappaticci, recorded and eventually found its way into an edition of the programme. The interview was posted on the World Wide Web as the 2003 allegations against Scappaticci surfaced. Scappaticci appears to give intimate details of the modus operandi of the IRA's Northern Command, indicated some of his previous involvement in the organisation and alleges, amongst other things, that Martin McGuinness was involved in the death of Frank Hegarty – an IRA volunteer who had been killed as an informer by the IRA in 1986. It has since been alleged that Scappaticci knew the intimate details of Hegarty's killing because, as part of his duties in the ISU, he had reportedly been involved in the interrogation and execution of Hegarty regarding a large Libyan arms cache, which the Gardaí found. Ingram stated that Hegarty was a FRU agent whom other FRU members had encouraged to rise through the organisation and gain the confidence of key IRA members.Article by agent \\"Martin Ingram\\" on the abandonment of Operation Taurus and the killing of Frank Hegarty , cryptome.quintessenz.at/mirror/ingram-spies.htm; accessed 5 June 2014. Involvement with the Stevens Report Things deteriorated for Scappaticci when Sir John Stevens, the Metropolitan police commissioner who has been probing RUC and British Army collusion with loyalist paramilitaries in the killing of Protestant student, Brian Adam Lambert in 1987 and the killing of solicitor Pat Finucane in 1989, revealed that he knew of his existence. In April 2004, Stevens signalled that he intended to question Scappaticci as part of the third Stevens inquiry. A report in a February 2007 edition of the Belfast News Letter reported that a cassette recording allegedly of Scappaticci talking about the number of murders he was involved in via the \\"Nutting Squad\\", as well as his work as an Army agent, had been lodged with the PSNI in 2004 and subsequently passed to the Stevens Inquiry in 2005. It is unclear whether this audio is a recording made via the Cook Report investigation. There were several inconsistencies with the various media reports alleging that Scappaticci was Stakeknife. The Provisional IRA reportedly assured Scappaticci of their belief in his denials and has issued public statements suggesting that the announcement of the former as a \\"tout\\" was a stunt by the British government to undermine Sinn Féin and the Republican movement. In January 2018, Scappaticci was arrested by police regarding offences including murder and abduction, but was released on bail. On 5 December 2018, Westminster Magistrates’ Court sentenced Scappaticci to 3 months imprisonment, suspended for 1 year, after he pleaded guilty to possessing \\"extreme pornographic images\\". The pornographic materials were uncovered during an investigation into serious crime during the Troubles.

It is the home of The University of Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles football team. History The stadium was originally opened on October 29, 1932 as \\"Faulkner Field\\", with a wooden grandstand which held 4,000 spectators at the time. It was named for local businessman L.E. Faulkner, who financed the materials and equipment for the stadium, which was built for free by local unemployed workers during the Great Depression. In 1938, permanent concrete stands which also housed dormitory space for student-athletes were built on the east side of the field, with the help of Southern Miss football players hauling the concrete. It was from this (hauling concrete blocks) that the stadium received the nickname \\"The Rock\\" (in reference to prison work crews—none of which were used to build the stadium). The stadium was expanded again in 1950, when the 7,500-seat West Stadium Dormitory stands were built for $350,000. Later, 2,000 bleacher seats were added, as well as new lights (the stadium had lights as early as 1934) and a new scoreboard. By the end of this expansion, the stadium seated 15,000. On September 5, 2015, the attendance record of 36,641 was set in the 2015 season opener against Mississippi State. Renovations In 1974-76, the stadium was rebuilt at a total cost of $6.3 million, with two sets of double- decked grandstands constructed on either side (east and west stands), bringing seating capacity to 33,000. This forced the Golden Eagles to play their entire 1975 schedule away from Hattiesburg, with eight of 11 games in enemy stadiums. The \\"home\\" games were played in New Orleans (at the new Louisiana Superdome), Jackson and Biloxi. The stadium was renamed for M. M. Roberts, an alumnus of then-Mississippi College and member of the Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning (popularly called \\"The College Board\\"). He is credited for helping to build the school up to its current university status, the largest such school in Mississippi south of Jackson. (However, the playing surface is still known as Faulkner Field.) It was opened on September 25, 1976 with a loss at the hands of in-State rival Ole Miss. In 1989, the current press box was added. Other improvements to the stadium include the Southern Miss Athletic Center, a field house and athletics training facility opened in 2002 in the north end zone, new lighting towers (for enhanced lighting of televised games), as well as the new Momentum Turf field added in 2004. The playing field at Roberts Stadium underwent a name change in the 2004 summer when it was renamed Carlisle-Faulkner Field at M.M. Roberts Stadium in honor of entrepreneur, Southern Miss graduate and Golden Eagle supporter, Gene Carlisle, who provided outstanding support and contribution to the Athletics Department and the University - much of which went to the installation of a new playing surface - Momentum Turf by Sportexe. In 2008, the university opened an addition to the stadium that encloses the south end zone, adding nearly 4,000 seats and 33 specialty suites. The expansion included luxury boxes as well as a new scoreboard in the North Endzone and premium seating and a club level on the east side of the stadium. The Pride of Mississippi Marching Band now sits in the new expansion in the south end zone.

The line includes the original American Aviation AA-5 Traveler, the Grumman American AA-5 Traveler, AA-5A Cheetah, and AA-5B Tiger, the Gulfstream American AA-5A Cheetah and AA-5B Tiger, the American General AG-5B Tiger, and the Tiger Aircraft AG-5B Tiger.  Development  Following American Aviation's success with the AA-1 Yankee Clipper two-seat light aircraft in 1969, the company decided to produce a four-seat aircraft. They started with a new \\"clean-sheet\\" design that was designated the American Aviation AA-2 Patriot. The AA-2 design did not meet its performance goals during test-flying and only one was ever built. Still needing a four-seat aircraft to fill its product line, the company simply enlarged the external and cabin dimensions of the AA-1 Yankee to create the four-seater. This decision capitalized on the marketplace identification of the Yankee and its derivative the AA-1A Trainer and also resulted in 2/3 parts commonality between the designs, saving development time and production costs. AA-5 Traveler The new four-place aircraft, named the American Aviation AA-5 Traveler, was powered by a Lycoming O-320-E2G engine of . It would carry four people at cruise speed and was certified under US FAR Part 23. Production of the Traveler had just started in 1971 when American Aviation was sold to Grumman and became the Grumman American division. Grumman continued production of the Traveler. 834 Travelers had been produced when production of this model ceased in 1975. Grumman American AA-5 Traveler Grumman American AA-5 Traveler Grumman American AA-5A Cheetah The Grumman American AA-5A Cheetah \\"leaping cheetah\\" emblem that differentiated the AA-5A from the earlier AA-5 Traveler Grumman American AA-5B Tiger The Grumman American \\"Galloping Tiger\\" emblem adopted to differentiate the AA-5B Tiger from earlier AA-5 models A redesign of the AA-5 was undertaken in 1974 and as a result the 1975 model Traveler featured an aerodynamic cleanup of the engine cowling and main landing gear fairings. The tail section remained unchanged. As a result of these changes the 1975 Traveler had a cruise speed of . The Traveler was superseded in production the following year by the further refined AA-5A Cheetah. AA-5A Cheetah Grumman's engineers felt that the AA-5 design had more speed potential than the original Traveler, even with its 1975 improvements, and so embarked on an aerodynamic cleanup and redesign. Changes were made to the engine cowling and baffling to reduce cooling drag, the exhaust system was redesigned, the main landing gear fairings were further improved, the ventral fin was eliminated, and the horizontal tail was enlarged to allow a larger center of gravity range. Fuel capacity was increased from the Traveler's 37 US gallons to 52 gallons, thus increasing its range. The new variant was named the AA-5A Cheetah and was introduced as a 1976 model in late 1975. In keeping with its namesake it was six knots (seven mph) faster than the Traveler with the same Lycoming O-320-E2G powerplant. Because the Cheetah looked very much like the Traveler externally, Grumman's marketing department created a \\"leaping cheetah\\" emblem to differentiate it from the earlier AA-5. Grumman sold its light aircraft division to Gulfstream Aerospace in 1978 and the division was renamed Gulfstream American. Gulfstream continued production of the AA-5A until 1979. A total of 900 Cheetahs were produced. AA-5B Tiger The final variant of the AA-5 line was the AA-5B Tiger. The Tiger was designed by Grumman engineers and was first produced in late 1974 as the 1975 model. The Tiger was the outcome of the same redesign work on the AA-5 Traveler that resulted in the Cheetah and it was originally little more than the same aircraft with a Lycoming O-360-A4K engine, resulting in a cruise speed. Gross weight was increased from the AA-5/AA-5A's to on the Tiger. Externally the Tiger looked much like the AA-5 Traveler and AA-5A Cheetah so once again Grumman's marketing department came up with a distinctive decal package to differentiate the design – this time a \\"galloping tiger\\". While the earlier AA-1s and AA-5s did not change much from year to year the AA-5B Tiger underwent almost continual improvement. As with the AA-5A, the AA-5B was continued in production by Gulfstream when they purchased Grumman's American division. Gulfstream ceased production of all piston-engined aircraft in 1979 and the highly successful Tiger design went out of production after 1323 aircraft had been delivered. AG-5B Tiger For eleven years the design was not produced and then in the late 1980s a new company was formed to produce the Tiger. American General Aviation Corporation carried out further design improvements including introducing a new split nose cowling (engine cover) that could be removed without removing the propeller, a new instrument panel, improved exterior lighting, a new fuel quantity indication system, a 28 volt electrical system replacing the older 14 volt system, a new-style throttle quadrant, and improvements to the heat and ventilation systems. Aerodynamic improvements raised the optimal altitude cruise speed from true airspeed to TAS. The redesigned aircraft was put into production under an amended type certificate as the American General AG-5B Tiger. The new company had considered producing AA-1s and AA-5A Cheetahs, but those plans were never fulfilled before it closed its doors in 1993. American General produced Tigers for model years 1990–93 and delivered 181 aircraft in that time. The design has a strong following among pilots and aircraft owners and so, in 1999, a new company was formed to put the Tiger back into production. Tiger Aircraft started production of the AG-5B Tiger in 2001 at their plant in Martinsburg, West Virginia. Tiger Aircraft did not produce any other models of the AA-1 or AA-5 family, although they owned the type certificates for the complete line of aircraft. Between 2001 and 2006 Tiger Aircraft produced 51 AG-5Bs. By the middle of 2006 Tiger Aircraft was experiencing financial problems and production of AG-5Bs had been halted and production workers laid off.AvWeb Article May 31, 2006 Tiger Aircraft Seeking Cash By Mary Grady, Newswriter, EditorAvWeb Article November 13, 2006 Tiger On The Ropes?

AA-5 & AG-5 production All told, 3,289 AA-5s and AG-5s were produced by the five manufacturers between 1971 and 2005. Design All models of the AA-5 have four seats under a sliding canopy, which can be partly opened in flight for ventilation. Entry for all four occupants is from the wing root over the canopy sill. Compared to competitive aircraft of the same era the AA-5s are noted for their light and pleasant handling characteristics as well as high cruising speed for the installed power. As derivatives of the original AA-1 Yankee, the AA-5 series share the same unique bonded aluminum wing and honeycomb fuselage that eliminates the need for rivets without sacrificing strength. The main landing gear is fibreglass with a spring-steel nose gear tube. There is no nosewheel steering as the nosewheel is free-castering through 180 degrees. Steering is by main wheel differential braking operated by using one's toes to push the tops of the rudder pedals.

It is the home field of the Fresno State Bulldogs of the Mountain West Conference. History Bulldog Stadium opened in 1980 and now has a current seating capacity of 40,727, expanded from an original capacity of 30,000. It hosted the California Bowl from 1981 to 1991 and friendly soccer matches prior to the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The playing field was natural grass until 2011 when FieldTurf was installed; it is named for longtime head coach Jim Sweeney The field has a conventional north-south alignment and the street level elevation is approximately above sea level. Prior to 1980, Fresno State played at Ratcliffe Stadium at Fresno City College, about southwest. Features For Fresno State football games, both end zones are designed in a red-and-white checkerboard pattern, similar to the University of Tennessee's orange-and- white at Neyland Stadium. Fresno State's Bulldog mascot is depicted at midfield in an enlarged style. The field was also notable for having numerical markers every five yards (similar to the field at Louisiana State's Tiger Stadium) rather than every ten yards, as is typical. The field went back to the conventional ten-yard markings in 2009. Bulldog Stadium enjoys a reputation of having one of the premiere home football environments among universities outside of the so-called \\"power conferences\\". Tailgate parties in the adjoining parking lots and athletic fields are an enormously popular pastime for Bulldog supporters and the fans are notable for their enthusiastic support within the stadium's environment. For several decades, supporters of Fresno State football have been nicknamed \\"The Red Wave\\" as a tribute to their swell of support and their tendency to be clad entirely in red clothing for home contests. For most of Fresno State's history, Bulldog Stadium is at its loudest when Fresno State plays their traditional arch-rival, the San Jose State Spartans. However, in recent years, Fresno State's most bitterly contested games have been pitted against the Boise State Broncos, whose success in the Western Athletic Conference generally and against Fresno State in particular has contributed to a fierce and energetic modern rivalry. Bulldog Stadium is constructed in a modern version of the sunken \\"bowl\\" style, with seats situated unusually close to the game action and at a steeper slope compared to bowled stadia of the early 20th century. This intimate atmosphere contributes to a louder, more intense gametime experience. Renovations The athletic department is currently in the process of fundraising for stadium renovations to be concluded prior to the 2019 season which will include: * Renovation of the seating area * Cross aisle with tunnels in the northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest sections to improve access to the seating areas * Increased number of concessions point of sale * Improved restroom facilities * Addition of a tower and upgraded suites, plus additional seating * A new football operations building in the south end zone to include offices, meeting rooms, a home-team locker room, and outdoor lounge area Conversion to FieldTurf FieldTurf was installed in July 2011 replacing the stadium's natural grass playing surface. The $1.2 million project was funded entirely through private donations. Currently Bulldog Stadium ranks 110th on the List of American football stadiums by capacity.

Robinson was consecrated as Episcopal Bishop of New Hampshire in November of that year, and served in that position until 2013. The move, and related decisions concerning the ability of churches to sanction same-sex relationships, divided the Episcopal Church, with some opponents of these developments announcing their realignment with bishops outside the Episcopal Church USA. In February 2006, Peter Akinola, at that time the Anglican primate of Nigeria, issued a communique on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Anglican Church of Nigeria, in which he stated: \\"The Church commends the law-makers for their prompt reaction to outlaw same-sex relationships in Nigeria and calls for the bill to be passed since the idea expressed in the bill is the moral position of Nigerians regarding human sexuality.\\"Message to the Nation, September 2006 Standing Committee of the Church of Nigeria In addition to criminalizing same-sex marriage, the bill in question also proposed to criminalize \\"registration of gay clubs, societies and organizations\\" and \\"publicity, procession and public show of same-sex amorous relationship through the electronic or print media physically, directly, indirectly or otherwise\\", on penalty of up to five years imprisonment.A Bill For An Act To Make Provisions For The Prohibition Of Sexual Relationship Between Persons Of The Same Sex, Celebration Of Marriage By Them And For Other Matters Connected Therewith Be It Enacted By The National Assembly Of The Federal Republic Of Nigeria As Follows The proposed legislation was formally challenged by the U.S. State Department as a possible breach of Nigeria's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.Nigerian Legislation Threatens to Limit Rights of Sexual Minorities Press Statement from the United States Department of State Chane, writing in the Washington Post, said: :\\"The archbishop's support for this law violates numerous Anglican Communion documents that call for a \\"listening process\\" involving gay Christians and their leaders. But his contempt for international agreements also extends to Articles 18-20 of the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which articulates the rights to freedom of thought, conscience, religion, association and assembly. Surprisingly, few voices -- Anglican or otherwise -- have been raised in opposition to the archbishop. When I compare this silence with the cacophony that followed the Episcopal Church's decision to consecrate the Rt. Rev. Gene Robinson, a gay man who lives openly with his partner, as the bishop of New Hampshire, I am compelled to ask whether the global Christian community has lost not only its backbone but its moral bearings.\\"A Gospel of Intolerance John Bryson Chane See also * List of Succession of Bishops for the Episcopal Church, USA References External links  *Episcopal Diocese of Washington website Category:Episcopal bishops of Washington Category:Living people Category:1944 births Category:Yale Divinity School alumni Category:Boston University alumni Category:American chief executives ","title":"John Bryson Chane"},{"id":"1886367","text":"The American Aviation AA-2 Patriot was a four-seat, all-metal aircraft that was developed in 1970-71 by American Aviation of Cleveland, Ohio.

The aircraft had provisions for retractable gear to be installed on a later version, although the prototype had fixed landing gear. The AA-2 was powered by a 180 hp (134 kW) Lycoming engine. The prototype, registered \\"N488AA\\", was completed in 1970 and test flying was commenced early in that same year. Aircraft performance during the test flying process fell far short of the design goals so the project was abandoned and the manufacturer eventually disassembled the prototype. American Aviation made the decision to develop a stretched version of the AA-1 Yankee Clipper instead of pursuing the AA-2. This aircraft eventually was produced as the AA-5 Traveler and was later developed into the AA-5A Cheetah and the AA-5B Tiger. Survivors The prototype has been recovered by members of the American Yankee Association.

The new award aims to strengthen both the spirit which inspired the festival in the first place and its commitment to the work of Jean Vigo. The creation of this prize has been made possible thanks to the close ties between Punto de Vista and the family of the French filmmaker. Punto de Vista paid tribute to the director of Zero de Conduite on the 2005 centenary of his birth. Luce Vigo, film critic and daughter of Vigo and Elizabeth Lozinska, attended that year. The festival provided an opportunity to look back on Vigo’s entire filmography and also represented the first step in a relationship which has now fructified in the form of this award. The Festival took its name, Punto de Vista (Point of View), as a tribute to Vigo, the first director to refer, back in the 1930s, to a “documented point of view” as a distinctive sign of a form of filmmaking which commits the filmmaker.

The football stadium replaced the original Tech Stadium where the school's football program played its home games on campus until 1967. Originally called Louisiana Tech Stadium, Joe Aillet Stadium opened in 1968 and was renamed for retired Louisiana Tech head football coach and athletic director Joe Aillet in 1972. History thumb The stadium was built in 1968 with an original capacity of 23,318 as a replacement for the original \\"Tech Stadium\\" on the university's campus. The new football stadium was constructed on the northwest portion of the campus as part of a new athletic complex which included a 3,000-seat baseball stadium now known as J. C. Love Field at Pat Patterson Park, 10 lighted tennis courts, and a track and field complex now known as the Jim Mize Track and Field Complex.Louisiana Tech Football Magazine, page 5, 9-25-1971 The new stadium, known as Tech Stadium or Louisiana Tech Stadium at the time, hosted its first Louisiana Tech home football game on September 28, 1968 when quarterback Terry Bradshaw led the Bulldogs to a 35–7 victory over the East Carolina University Pirates. After four seasons as Tech Stadium, the stadium was renamed Joe Aillet Stadium prior to the 1972 season in honor of Joe Aillet, the longtime head football coach and athletic director of Louisiana Tech who died on December 28, 1971. On November 11, 1972, the official dedication ceremonies of the newly renamed Joe Aillet Stadium were held during a home football game between Tech and Eastern Michigan. The 1997 season saw the largest crowd in school history of 28,714 for a 17–16 victory by the Bulldogs over the Northeast Louisiana Indians. Future professional quarterback Tim Rattay was involved in the first-ever matchup of future pro quarterbacks at the stadium, facing off against UCF's Daunte Culpepper in 1998. The first nationally televised game at the stadium came in 2002 against the Fresno State Bulldogs. In an October 2004 rematch, the team achieved an upset victory by defeating the 17th-ranked Bulldogs. In 2008, the team defeated the Mississippi State University Bulldogs 22–14 in its season opener. It was the first-ever visit by a school from a BCS conference to Joe Aillet Stadium.

It has a permanent seating capacity of 6,000, on two decks of seating, though it can be expanded upwards to 17,000 for American football games.Sportsplex Stadium info It was the first soccer-specific stadium built from the ground up in the United States. The Sportsplex is located across the street from the Princess Anne Athletic Complex and near the Veterans United Home Loans Amphitheater. The main stadium was the home field of the Hampton Roads Piranhas, a women's team in the W-League, which became the de facto top women's league in the country after the demise of the Women's United Soccer Association. It was originally their home from 1999 to 2002. In 2003 the Piranhas moved their home games to a smaller stadium on the campus of Virginia Wesleyan College near the city's border with Norfolk. It was also the home field for the Virginia Beach Mariners (USL-I) and the Virginia Beach Submariners (PDL). In 2007, the franchise was terminated, and as a result the Piranhas acquired the Submariners and renamed them as the Piranhas, a reflection of their women's team. Both teams played at the Virginia Beach Sportsplex for the 2010 season of the W-League and the Premier Development League. The stadium is now the home office for the Virginia Rush Organization as well as the home venue for its U16 and U18 U.S. Soccer Development Academy teams. It is also home to the Norfolk Blues rugby team and Southern Virginian Trojans semi-pro football team. The stadium also hosted the Virginia Destroyers of the United Football League, which played two abbreviated seasons at the Sportsplex and for whom the stadium's capacity was doubled.

Virginia Destroyers  On November 10, 2010, the Virginia Destroyers of the United Football League announced their home games would be played at the Sportsplex starting in Fall 2011. The UFL added temporary bleacher seating (recycled from the 2011 U.S. Open golf tournament) to expand the stadium to between 14,000 and 17,000 seats depending on demand. The Destroyers first game drew almost 13,000 fans to see a 34–17 Virginia win.Fairbank, Dave (June 11, 2011). UFL's Destroyers enter home stretch of preparation with training camp a month away.

He earned his final cap against Wales in a World Cup warm up match in Cardiff in August 2003. However, an injury acquired during the game ultimately affected his selection prospects for the World Cup and he stayed at home. In the Zurich Premiership he had enjoyed a glittering climax to 2003, being 'man of the match' in the Premiership final and amassing 24 points, as Wasps beat Gloucester 39-3. He finished as the leading Premiership points scorer, including play offs, with 284 points. He was a kingpin of the Wasps team which won the Zurich Premiership and Heineken Cup double in the season 2003-04, scoring a drop goal in the Premiership final. The following season he helped Wasps complete a hat-trick of Premiership titles, again scoring a drop goal in the final. King won his second Heineken Cup with Wasps in 2007, in the final of which he scored four penalties and a drop goal. Coaching After retiring he worked as a backs coach with ASM Clermont Auvergne. At the end of 2012 it was announced that he would go to Northampton Saints as their backs coach for the start of the 2013/14 season. For the 2017 Six Nations Championship, he has assumed the role of attack coach for the Wales national rugby union team. After a three-year stint with Montpellier, King joined Gloucester.

Bathe, Robert Frederick Ltd, 2004. It is sometimes described as \\"Freecell without cells\\" because its game play is somewhat akin to the popular solitaire computer game of that name but without extra empty spaces to maneuver. Beleaguered Castle is also called Laying Siege and Sham Battle.\\"Beleaguered Castle\\" (p.222) in The Complete Book of Card Games by Peter Arnold, Hamlyn Publishing, 2010. Rules First, the player removes the aces from the deck and aligns them vertically without overlapping them to form the foundations. Then cards are dealt to the left and right of the aces, forming eight rows of six overlapping cards each, in a distinctive layout with \\"wings\\" on either side of the foundations. The initial layout in Beleaguered Castle The top card of each row (the cards that are exposed) is available for play either on the foundations or on any other row. The foundations are built up to kings by suit. Cards in the rows are built down in sequence regardless of suit. Once a row becomes empty, it can be filled by any card.Solitaire Games. . The game is won when all of the cards are built onto the foundations. However, this is easier said than done because most games are doomed to fail in just a few moves. Variations In light of how difficult the standard game is to complete due to a poor draw, many variations exist, including: * In Citadel, any card can be dealt onto the foundations during dealing. The other cards that aren't built are played as in Beleaguered Castle. * In Streets and Alleys, the aces are included in the shuffling, resulting in the rows at the left of the foundations having seven cards each.\\"Streets and Alleys\\" (p.312) in Bicycle Official Rules of Card Games by Joli Quentin Kansil (ed.), 1999. * In Selective Castle, cards are dealt and played as in Streets and Alleys, but the player has the freedom to choose the starting card for each foundation. * Siegecraft allows an extra cell for any card to be placed on it to help in uncovering key cards, making it easier. The cell can only accommodate one card. * Stronghold, invented by Thomas Warfield, is Streets and Alleys with the game play of Siegecraft, allowing an extra cell to accommodate a card. * Castle of Indolence is played with two decks (and hence eight foundations). Cards can be moved to the foundations regardless of suit. The top cards of four reserve piles (initially holding 13 cards) are available for moving on the foundations or rows. * Fortress and the closely related Chessboard both have five rows on each side of the foundations and allow building of sequences up and down in the same suit.

Biography Alan Carney was born David Boughal in Brooklyn, New York, on December 22, 1909. His parents, Edward and Nellie (Kearney) Boughal, were Irish immigrants. He performed in vaudeville for years. After making his first film, 1941's Convoy, Carney signed a contract at RKO Pictures and appeared in choice supporting roles in such films as Mr. Lucky. In 1943, Carney teamed up with Wally Brown as RKO's answer to Abbott and Costello. In addition to their inexpensive starring vehicles, Brown and Carney co-starred in Step Lively, a musical remake of the Marx Brothers film Room Service. Wally played Chico's part, while Alan Carney filled in for Harpo; the \\"Groucho\\" role was essayed by George Murphy. The comedy team was also featured on a live USO tour arranged by the studio. After 1946's Genius at Work, RKO terminated the team's contracts. Alan Carney continued in films and TV as a supporting player, working prolifically at Disney Studios in the 1960s and 1970s. One of Carney's best latter-day roles was as Mayor Dawgmeat in the 1959 musical film Li'l Abner. Carney appeared with Wally Brown in Who Was That Lady? (1960) and in Walt Disney's The Absent-Minded Professor (1961), but they never appeared in the same scenes together. The duo was slated to be reunited for It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), but Brown died not long before filming began. Alan Carney made his last film appearance in Walt Disney Productions' Herbie Rides Again in 1974. He died in Van Nuys, California, of a heart attack at the age of 63 from the excitement of winning the daily double at Hollywood Park Racetrack.

Background and production While on tour, in March 2000, the band got into a van accident that almost ended the band's career.Gadino 2001, p. 62 The van accident was somewhat of an inspiration for the band's song writing. By this point, vocalist Chris Conley \\"really felt confident\\" and subsequently had \\"a lot more fun\\" while writing. Click on the Next button to look through pages. Conley had a personal recording studio set- up where he would \\"spend the entire day\\" in \\"building songs in my own little world.\\" In April, it was announced the band had signed to Vagrant Records due to the success of Through Being Cool (1999).Keiper 2000, p. 22 Later that month, Punknews.org reported that the group would release their next album in early 2001. In January 2001, Punknews.org reported that the band was recording with Steve Evetts, who had produced the group's previous two albums. Recording began on March 17, 2001 and continued into April, lasting thrice as long as their preceding two records.Harkness 2001, p. 4 Conley described producer Rob Schnapf as \\"a really mellow, laid back guy. Him being relaxed just made for a nice, creative environment in the studio.\\" Recording was spread over three studios: Sunset Sound and Sound Factory in Hollywood, California, and Sonora Sound in Los Feliz, California. Doug Boehm recorded the proceedings with assistance from Steven Rhodes and Seth Mclain. Josh Turner acted as the Pro Tools engineer during the sessions. Productivity was initially slow due to, as the band explains, \\"some difficulty we're having with tuning guitars\\". Richard Barron performed organ on \\"Cars & Calories\\". Schnapf and Boehm mixed the recordings, while Don C. Tyler mastered them at Precision Mastering. 13 tracks were recorded in total, including two outtakes \\"Ups and Downs\\" and \\"For Erminie\\". Composition While Stay What You Are has been tagged as post- hardcore, power popGriffin 2006, p. D18 and pop punk, it saw the band move into post-punk territory, alongside the mixing of emo with the aggressiveness of post-grunge. It was a more mellow, darker and melodic effort than their preceding two albums, drawing comparison to the Promise Ring and Seaweed. Conley said the slower sound was intentional, as the band didn't want to perform fast-paced music anymore and wished to let the melodies carry the songs. The opening track \\"At Your Funeral\\" talks about the death of a friend. \\"Cars & Calories\\" talks about celebrity culture. Conley explained that he \\"felt sort of mildly alienated at different points in my life just looking at culture, especially this hectic, modern culture.\\" Conley wrote the song in an empty room at Vagrant Records' offices. He played open chords, and the rest of the song soon followed. \\"Jukebox Breakdown\\" talks about taking liberties when making music and the resultant backlash that comes with it. \\"As Your Ghost Takes Flight\\" is about a friend's heroin addiction.Gadino 2001, pp. 62–3 \\"Nightingale\\" uses distorted vocals. \\"All I'm Losing Is Me\\" tackles problems facing Generation X and asks several questions. The ballad \\"This Is Not an Exit\\" was compared to \\"Out of Reach\\" by the Get Up Kids. Release In early June 2001, an MP3 of \\"See You\\" was posted on PopPunk.com. The group embarked on a brief two-week US tour, leading into a few shows in Japan later in the month. After initially planned for release on June 5, Stay What You Are was eventually released on July 10 through Vagrant Records. The group was planned to appear on the Warped Tour, however, they instead headlined the Vagrant America Tour between early July and early September. \\"At Your Funeral\\" was released as a radio single in September. Also during that month, a music video was filmed for the song in Los Angeles. It features a creative way of motion control, similar to Requiem for a Dream. Following the Vagrant America Tour, drummer Bryan Newman left the band to study at college. His position was temporarily filled by Damon Atkinson of Hey Mercedes.

He attended Red House School & Sedbergh School in the Yorkshire Dales, which has produced a number of professional rugby union players including Will Greenwood, Will Carling and Phil Dowson, with whom he played alongside in the same XV. He began playing for the Yorkshire Under 18s and then the North East Under 18s. While his schoolmates were attending university open days, he was visiting professional rugby union clubs. He eventually chose Gloucester Rugby. His Gloucester Rugby debut was against Rotherham in 2001, when he scored a superb individual try. He represented England at the Hong Kong Sevens in 2002 and scored a hat trick in the final, which England won. He flew back and followed it up with a hat trick in a club game against Bath. Four days before his twentieth birthday he rounded Jonah Lomu to score a famous try for an uncapped England XV against the Barbarians at Twickenham. He made his international debut for England against New Zealand in November 2002. An injury to his foot meant that he missed a tour to Argentina. He recovered for the Autumn internationals against Australia and New Zealand but was diagnosed with glandular fever and missed out on playing against South Africa. He was playing again within a few months and was able to be a part of Gloucester Rugby winning the Powergen Cup, in the final of which he started and scored two tries. He narrowly missed selection to the final 30 for the 2003 Rugby World Cup because of a back problem, although he had celebrated his first Six Nations Championship start some months earlier with a try in the match against Italy. Unluckily, injury once again prevented him playing a part in the 2004 Autumn series in November and he missed further game time for the buildup to the 2005 Six Nations. Picked in the centre for England's final 2005 Autumn test against Samoa but a hip injury forced him off at half-time. In 2006, he made the squad for England's tour of Australia and scored two tries in their win over the Barbarians on 28 May. However, he suffered a dead leg midweek during training, and as a result missed both tests, in which England were resoundingly beaten. Once more, he was beset by bad luck and suffered a comminuted fracture of his collarbone in a pre-season match for Gloucester Rugby, which greatly reduced his chances of playing in the autumn tests. He was recalled to the England squad for the 2007 Summer Tour of South Africa, alongside club colleagues Andy Hazell, Nick Wood, Iain Balshaw, Anthony Allen and Alex Brown. After fantastic performances for Gloucester throughout the 2007–08 season, Simpson-Daniel was named Guinness Premiership Player of The Season beating Olly Barkley and teammate Akapusi Qera. Simpson-Daniel was called into the England Saxons squad to face Italy A in Ragusa, Sicily on 9 February 2008. Following some great performances with his top of the league club Gloucester, Simpson-Daniel was called into the England squad for the team to face Scotland on 8 March 2008. Called into the 2011 Rugby World Cup training squad, on 1 August 2011 Simpson-Daniel was one of five players released by manager Martin Johnson. On 2 September 2014, James Simpson-Daniel announced his retirement due to an ongoing ankle injury. Simpson-Daniel's older brother Chris was also a professional rugby player for Newcastle Falcons and Worcester, however his career was curtailed by injury.

John Crichton-Stuart, 4th Marquess of Bute, KT (20 June 1881 – 25 April 1947), was a Scottish peer. Biography Lord Bute was born at Chiswick House in Chiswick, London. He was the son of The 3rd Marquess of Bute and Hon. Gwendolen Fitzalan-Howard, a daughter of The 1st Baron Howard of Glossop and granddaughter of The 13th Duke of Norfolk. He was educated at Harrow School, and succeeded his father as Marquess of Bute in October 1900, when he was nineteen years old. In early 1902 he was on a tour in the Far East. On reaching his majority in June 1902, he received the Honorary Freedom of the Burgh of Rothesay, and later the same month took the oath and his seat in the House of Lords. The 4th Marquess, like his father, had a passion for architecture and was responsible for restoring Caerphilly Castle in South Wales. In 1936 he published a pamphlet entitled \\"A Plea for Scotland's Architectural Heritage\\", which argued for the preservation of Scotland's smaller burgh dwellings and advocated reconditioning traditional working class housing, rather than wholesale demolition. He became \\"the man who sold a city\\" when, in 1938, he disposed of the remaining Bute family estate in Cardiff. Family life On 6 July 1905, the young Lord Bute married Augusta Bellingham, daughter of Sir (Alan) Henry Bellingham, 4th Baronet, and Catherine Noel. The lavish wedding, at Castle Bellingham in the village of Castlebellingham in County Louth, Ireland, was followed by a party at Mount Stuart House in Scotland. A film company was employed to film the event, one of the earliest examples of the aristocratic classes making a private film. They had seven children: * Lady Mary Crichton-Stuart (8 May 1906 – 1980); married Edward Walker and had issue. * John Crichton-Stuart, 5th Marquess of Bute (4 August 1907 – 14 August 1956) * Lady Jean Crichton-Stuart (28 October 1908 – 23 October 1995); married Lt.-Cmdr. Hon. James Bertie and had issue (two sons); her elder son was Fra' Andrew Willoughby Ninian Bertie, Prince and Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta from 1988 until his death in 2008. * Lord Robert Crichton-Stuart (12 December 1909 – 26 June 1976); married Lady Janet Egida Montgomerie (1911–1999), daughter of Archibald Montgomerie, 16th Earl of Eglinton and had issue. * Lord David Crichton-Stuart (8 February 1911 – 3 March 1970); married Ursula Packe and had issue. * Lord Patrick Crichton-Stuart (1 February 1913 – 5 February 1956); married Jane von Bahr and had issue. * Captain Lord Rhidian Crichton-Stuart (4 June 1917 – 25 June 1969); married Selina van Wijk and had issue.

Joseph Wolpe dubbed her \\"the mother of behavior therapy\\" due to her famous study of Peter and development of desensitization. Early life and education  Cover Jones was the middle child of three born to Carrie Louise Higson and Charles Blair Cover. She had a brother who was five years older than her and a sister who was four years younger than her. Jones' mother was a homemaker involved in several local community organizations while her father was a businessman. Due to regretting not attending post-secondary education himself, Jones encouraged his children to attend university. Visiting Chautauqua Institute on Lake Erie, Ohio became a yearly summer trip for the Cover family during Cover Jones' childhood. After being accepted into Vassar College, Cover Jones chose to study psychology. She took every psychology course offered at Vassar College except one that was offered by Margaret Floy Washburn.Ware, S. (2005), Notable American women: A biographical dictionary completing the twentieth century. (Vol. 5). Harvard University: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press Washburn refused to admit her into the class because of a poor laboratory grade in a previous class. She spent her summer vacations, during her time in college, working with poor children in summer camps and settlement houses. Soon after graduating from Vassar College, in 1919, Cover Jones attended a lecture by the noted behaviorist John B. Watson, in New York City. After hearing Watson's lecture, Mary wondered if conditioning could be used to eliminate fears. In 1919, she began her graduate work at Columbia University, and in the summer of 1920 she completed her master's degree. Mary Cover married a fellow graduate student, Harold Jones, in 1920. Career In 1923, Cover Jones became an associate professor of Psychological Research at the Institute of Educational Research, Teachers' College, Columbia University. Cover Jones conducted her famous study of Peter during her position as associate at Columbia University. After publishing the result from the Peter study in 1924, she completed a doctoral dissertation on the development of early behavior patterns in young children. She went on to work with 365 infants in various areas in New York City and studied the development of early behavior of young children. Jones did not receive attention for her work until the 1960s, when the field of behavior therapy began to coalesce under the leadership of Joseph Wolpe. In the summer of 1927, Cover Jones, her husband, and their two daughters moved to California. Barbara, her first daughter, was born in 1922. Leslie, her second daughter, was born three years later in 1925. She then accepted a position as research associate at the Institute for Child Welfare at Berkeley where she became involved in the longitudinal Oakland Growth Study (OGS). A position as Director of Research was offered to Harold, while Cover Jones accepted a position as research associate at the Institute for Child Welfare at the University of California, Berkeley in 1952.Rutherford, A. (2010). Profile of Mary Cover Jones. In A. Rutherford (Ed.), Psychology's Feminist Voices. Retrieved from http://www.feministvoices.com/mary-cover-jones/ In 1952, Cover Jones became Assistant Professor of Education at Berkeley. Although she had relevant experience and conducted research, she was not allowed to become a full-time professor due to her husband also being employed at the university. This anti- nepotism rule was very common in this era. The University of California, Berkeley eventually set aside that rule and in 1959 Cover Jones became full professor for one year. During this time, she and her husband Harold produced the first educational television course on developmental psychology. In 1960, she became president of the Division of Developmental Psychology of the American Psychological Association (APA). In the same year, she and Harold retired, shortly after which he died of a heart attack. In 1986, Jones received the G. Stanley Hall Award from the APA. The G. Stanley Hall Award is awarded to recognize notable contributions to developmental psychology. Some of Jones' contributions include her study of Peter, which laid the foundation for behavior therapy, and her development of desensitization and direct conditioning to overcome fears. Unrelated to psychological research, Cover Jones spent her time being involved in committees related to child welfare and spent a great deal of time and effort on such causes. Psychological research=\\"Little Peter\\" experiment While attending a speech by leading behavioral psychologist, John B. Watson, Cover Jones became interested in his most famous study, the \\"Little Albert experiment\\". In this experiment, an infant was classically conditioned to express a fearful response when a white rat was presented along with a loud noise that shocked the child. Cover Jones began to wonder if the techniques used by Watson could be used to make children less fearful of a stimulus, in essence reversing his findings. These thoughts led to her most cited work, a study of the removal of a fear of rabbits through conditioning conducted on a three-year-old named Peter at Columbia University. She treated Peter's fear of a white rabbit by \\"direct conditioning\\", in which a pleasant stimulus (food) was associated with the rabbit. Cover Jones began her experiment with the goal of finding the most effective way to eliminate irrational fears in children. Peter was chosen for the study because in all other aspects of infant life he was considered to be normal except for his fear of rabbits. Peter was not only afraid of rabbits; Cover Jones showed he would also cry when presented with other similar items such as feathers, a fur coat, a fur rug and cotton. She conducted her experiments using a range of different treatments in order to eliminate the fear response in Peter. She described her methods used in the Peter study as \\"patient, meticulous and painstaking procedures\\", in order to understand what was taking place. This is a method that she learned from her mentor Watson. She initiated the study with the rabbit being 12 feet from Peter, and brought the rabbit closer until it was nibbling on Peter's fingers. As the rabbit was gradually brought closer to Peter with the presence of his favorite food (candy), his fear subsided and he eventually was able to touch the rabbit without crying. After curing Peter of his phobia, Cover Jones wrote and published a paper about the experiment titled \\"A Laboratory Study of Fear: The Case of Peter (1924)\\". Though now considered to be a revolutionary experiment, at the time it was largely dismissed and was not even written up as Cover Jones's dissertation. This study by Cover Jones is considered by some to be a defining landmark in behavioral therapy and was a breakthrough in how behaviorism could be studied and manipulated in the laboratory. Due to the rediscovery of this research in the 1970s, Cover Jones was considered \\"the mother of behavioral therapy\\" by her friend Wolpe and other colleagues. Additionally, this study was important for the development of the idea and technique of desensitization, now often used to cure phobias by repeatedly exposing a person with a phobia to a series of stimuli that approximate the feared object.T.L. Brink (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. \\"Unit 6: Learning.\\" pp. 101 Oakland growth study The Oakland growth study is one of Cover Jones's most influential studies. The Oakland growth study was the third in a series of longitudinal studies from Berkeley College. The first study in the trio was the Berkeley Growth Study, looking at newborns (1928), followed by the Berkeley Guidance study, looking at preschool age children (1928). Both studies were done by looking at children living in Berkeley, California.Ruspini, E. (2002). An introduction to longitudinal research. (pp. 12-13). New York City, New York: Routledge. The Oakland Growth Study (OGS) was led by Cover Jones and her husband. The study began in 1932 in Oakland, California. The Study followed 212 students in the fifth and sixth grade who were born between the years 1920-1921.Laursen, B., Little, T. D., & Card, N. A. (2012). Handbook of developmental research methods. (p. 133). New York City, New York: The Guilford Press. The participants were studied twice a year until they graduated from high school. The study's primary goal was to understand typical adolescence. They looked at physical abilities, physiological changes, and peer relationships. They were then studied in adulthood at ages 38, 48, and 60 years old.Grimm, K. (n.d.). Intergenerational studies. Retrieved from The studies in adulthood consisted of interviews, questionnaires, personality inventories, and health assessments. The final interview of participants took place in 1980, when Cover Jones was 83 years old. The results from the Oakland Growth Study allowed Cover Jones to publish 100 papers. Also, due to the well documented data from this study, the data has been reanalyzed and used for other research in the field of child development. The success of the study is considered to be partly due to Cover Jones's strong commitment to the research and her ability to maintain friendships with the study's participants. An important finding from the Oakland Growth Study was the long term emotional and behavioral effects of boys and girls who went through puberty at a younger age or at an older age. Additional findings of the Oakland Growth Study were the developmental effects of drinking in adolescents and the effects of economic status.  Research with late- and early- maturing boys  Within the field of child development, Jones believed there was some evidence that supported the idea that adolescent children who have started maturing (reaching puberty) at an earlier age were perceived and treated differently by their peers and other adults. In Child Development, the flagship journal of the society of Research and Child Development, published an articles were published by Paul Mussen and Mary Cover Jones (1957, 1958) and that investigated the relationship between physical maturation status and self-concepts in late- and early-maturating adolescent boys and girls, respectively. Paul Mussen and Mary Cover Jones (1957) conducted a study that investigated the relationship between maturational status and certain aspects of personality during late adolescence. Mussen and Jones believed that there is evidence that supports the notion that within our culture, adults treat boys who have started puberty at an earlier age differently from boys who have started puberty at a later age because of their physical status. The current study used multiple personality inventories that aimed to uncover aspects of late – and early- maturing boys’ personality to see if there was significant differences among the boys. One personality inventory included images of people and objects, and the researchers showed each individual boy, one by one, an image and asked the boy to create a story about what is happening in the image, in hopes that the child would uncover something about himself through the images seen. The results of the study showed that later maturing boys are more likely than early maturing boys to encounter an “unfavorable socio-psychological environment” and that, in turn, can have lifelong implications.  Research with late- and early- maturing girls  The following year, Paul Mussen and Mary Cover Jones (1958) replicated the study using late and early maturing adolescent girls. The researchers had different hypotheses for the girls than the boys. The advantageous socio-psychological environments that boys were exposed to for maturing earlier were different for early maturing girls. In our culture, early maturing girls are perceived by adults more negatively than later maturing girls. The current study tested the same methods and procedures for the girls as they tested for the boys and the results indicated that early maturing girls were socially disadvantaged until the late maturing girls “caught up” (reached the similar physical status to early maturing girls), which at that point, they no longer perceived any differences. Death Cover Jones died in Santa Barbara, California on July 22, 1987. She left behind her two daughters—Leslie Alexander, who currently lives in Santa Barbara, and Barbara Coates, who currently lives in Claremont, California—and her six grandchildren. Minutes before she died, Cover Jones told her sister: \\"I am still learning about what is important in life\\".Reiss, B.K. (1990). A biography of Mary Cover Jones.

The programs are sponsored by the National Science Foundation, and are hosted in various universities. REUs tend to be specialized in a particular field of science. There are REUs in many scientific fields such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology, biology, psychology, and computer science. There are two kinds of REU experiences: REU individual experiences (funded by NSF via their REU Supplements category of grant supplements) and REU sites (funded by NSF via their REU Sites category of grant proposals). How students apply to participate REU sites typically consist of ten undergraduates working in the research program of the host institution either in the US or abroad, for example, CERN. As the program is funded by the NSF, undergraduates must be citizens or permanent residents of the US or its possessions to be eligible for funding. However, some REU sites accept \\"self-funder\\" international students. Applications are typically due between February and March. The length of the application ranges from a single letter of reference without supporting materials all the way up to something comparable to a college admissions application. The programs generally require between one and three letters of reference, a transcript, 0-2 essays, a letter of interest, a resume, a biographical form, or some combination thereof. Although all eligible students are encouraged to apply, there is an emphasis on including populations underrepresented in science—women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities. REU individual experiences typically consist of one undergraduate student, or two undergraduate students working together. Sometimes these undergraduates work with a larger research team that includes graduate students. These REU experiences take place at the student's current university, and can last anywhere from a few weeks to an entire year. The application process varies by the particular faculty member who plans to work with these students. Compensation Students participating in REU sites are generally provided with a modest stipend ($4,000–$6,000 for 10 weeks of work), housing, transportation to and from the site, and often arrangements for food. REU individual experiences pay (stipends or on an hourly basis) at about the same payrate as REU sites. History Research grants which included Undergraduate research assistants have been funded from the very beginning of the NSF. But in 1958, the NSF established the Undergraduate Research Participation Program, and funding for that program continued until FY 1982, when it was abolished in the Reagan Administration cuts of NSF education funding. A program to enhance research experiences for undergraduates was reestablished in FY 1987 with the title Research Experiences for Undergraduates. One long-running REU-site in the 1990s was Washington University's Computer Science SURA Program.
