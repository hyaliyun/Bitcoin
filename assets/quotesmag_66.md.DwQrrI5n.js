It was discovered practically at the same time as the Greek Edicts of Ashoka, which suggests that the two inscriptions were more or less conjoined. The inscription was written in Aramaic, probably by the Indian emperor Ashoka about 260 BCE. Since Aramaic was the official language of the Achaemenid Empire, which disappeared in 320 BCE with the conquests of Alexander the Great, it seems that this inscription was addressed directly to the populations of this ancient empire still present in northwestern India, or to border populations for whom Aramaic remained the language of use.A new Aramaic inscription of Asoka found in the Laghman Valley (Afghanistan), Andr√© Dupont-Sommer Proceedings of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres Year 1970 114-1 p.173A new Aramaic inscription of Asoka discovered in Kandahar (Afghanistan) Dupont-Sommer, Andr√© Records of the sessions of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres Year 1966 110-3 pp.440-451 Background The inscription was discovered in the remains of the old city of Kandahar (probably the ancient Alexandria of Arachosia). The discovery of this inscription is to be related to that of several other inscriptions in Aramaic or Greek (or both sets), written by Asoka. The most famous are the Kandahar Bilingual Inscription, written in Greek and Aramaic, or the Greek Edicts of Ashoka, also found in Kandahar. Previously, in 1915, Sir John Marshall discovered the Aramaic Inscription of Taxila, and in 1932 another inscription in Aramaic was discovered in the Laghman Valley in Pul-i-Darunteh, the Pul-i-Darunteh Aramaic inscription. Finally, another inscription, the Aramaic inscription of Laghman was also discovered in 1970. The Aramaic inscription of Kandahar is an inscription in \\"Indo-Aramaic\\" alternating Indian language and Aramaic language, but using only the Aramaic script, the Aramaic parts translating the Indian parts transcribed in the Aramaic alphabet. It does not explicitly refer to Ashoka in the fragment that was found, but the place of discovery, the style of writing, the vocabulary used, allows to link the inscription to the other Ashoka inscriptions known in the region. Content of the inscription This inscription is usually interpreted as a version of a passage from Major Pillar Edict n¬∞7.Handbuch der Orientalistik by Kurt A. Behrendt p.39\\"A third fragment found in Kandahar (Kandahar III) is a passage from the seventh pillar edict of which the text of Origin in Mgadh is translated into groups of words in Aramaic \\"Session Reports - Academy of Inscriptions & belles-lettres 2007, p.1400 The word SHYTY which appears several times corresponds to the Middle Indian word Sahite (Sanskrit Sahitam), meaning \\"in agreement with\\", \\"according to ...\\", and which allows to introduce a quote, in this case here Indian words found in the Ashoka Edits. Many of these Indian words, transcribed here phonetically in Aramaic, are indeed identifiable, and otherwise exist only in Major Pillar Edict n¬∞7 of Ashoka, in the same order of use : 'NWPTYPTY' corresponds to the Indian word anuppatipatiya (without order, in disorder), and 'NWPTYP ...' to anuppatipamme. Y'NYHYK'NY .... corresponds to yani hi kanici and is the first word of this edict. There are also several words in the Aramaic language, the role of which would be to explain the meaning of the Indian words and phrases mentioned: the word WK'N \\"and now\\", WYHWTRYWN \\"they have grown, and they will grow\\", PTYSTY \\"obedience\\" .... This inscription, in spite of its partial and often obscure character, seems to be a translation or a line-by-line commentary of elements of Major Pillar Edict n¬∞7.

The attack took place across the entire front but with the main thrust below the Soyang River in the Taebaek Mountains. The objective of the main effort was to sever the six Republic of Korea Army (ROK) divisions on the eastern front from the remainder of the US Eighth Army and annihilate them and the US 2nd Infantry Division. Secondary attacks would be mounted by PVA and KPA forces across the entire front. The attack was launched on 16 May 1951 and succeeded in swiftly pushing back the ROK I Corps which retreated in good order and III Corps which was routed, while the US 2nd Infantry Division to their left mounted a stronger defense before gradually giving up ground. By 19 May the PVA/KPA advance was losing momentum due to reinforcement of the UN forces, supply difficulties and mounting losses from UN air and artillery strikes. On 20 May the UN launched a counterattack on the west of the front and the PVA/KPA began to withdraw after suffering heavy losses with the offensive coming to an end on 22 May. Background Eighth United States Army commander General James Van Fleet expected the PVA's next effort to come either in the west, as had the main force of the April attacks, or on his central front. Judging the Uijongbu-Seoul, Bukhan River, and Chuncheon-Hongch'on corridors to be the most likely axes of enemy advance, he shifted forces by 4 May to place most of his strength and all US divisions in the western and central sectors and aligned the US I, IX and X Corps so that each was responsible for one of these avenues. Deployed around Seoul, I Corps blocked the Uijongbu approach with the US 1st Cavalry and 25th Infantry Divisions and the ROK 1st Division on line and the US 3rd Infantry Division and British 29th Brigade in reserve. IX Corps, its sector narrowed by a westward shift of its right boundary, now had the British 28th Brigade, US 24th Infantry Division, ROK 2nd Division, ROK 6th Division and US 7th Infantry Division west to east on the No-Name Line and the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team (187th RCT) in reserve for defense against an enemy strike down or out of the Bukhan River valley. In the left portion of the X Corps sector, the US 1st Marine Division and the US 2nd Infantry Division, less the bulk of the US 23rd Infantry Regiment in Corps' reserve, covered the Chuncheon-Hongch'on axis. Though the concentration of strength in the western and central areas left the remainder of the front comparatively thin, Van Fleet believed that the six ROK divisions in the east- the 5th and 7th in the right portion of the X Corps sector, the 9th and 3rd in the ROK III Corps sector, and the Capital and 11th in the ROK I Corps sector- could hold the line since opposing KPA forces were weak and since the terrain barriers of the higher Taebaek Mountains favored defense. On 30 April Van Fleet had ordered intensive patrolling to locate and identify PVA/KPA formations as they continued to move out of contact. Patrols searching above the front during the first two days of May, however, encountered no major enemy force except at the I Corps left where ROKA 1st Division patrols found the KPA 8th Division deployed astride Route 1. To deepen the search in the west and central areas, Van Fleet ordered patrol bases set up out along a line reaching east as far as Route 24 in the X Corps sector. Each division fronted by this line was to establish a regimental combat team in a base position organized for perimeter defense. Patrols operating from the bases could work farther north with full fire support, and the forward positions would deepen the defense in the sectors where Van Fleet expected to be most heavily attacked. While the fortification of the No Name Line continued, the front east of Route 24 was to be advanced to to Line Missouri, both to restore contact and to clear a stretch of Route 24 and a connecting secondary road angling east to the coast for use as a supply route by the ROK divisions defending the sector. Van Fleet also directed a foray to destroy KPA forces in I Corps' west sector after the KPA 8th Division stopped short the 12th Regiment of the ROK 1st Division's attempt to establish a patrol base up Route 1 on 4 May. The six ROK divisions in the east opened the advance toward Line Missouri on 7 May. Along the coast, ROK I Corps forces met almost no opposition, and on 9 May the ROK 11th Division's tank destroyer battalion moved some beyond Line Missouri to occupy the town of Kansong, where Route 24 ended in a junction with the coastal highway. Forces of the ROK 5th Division on the left flank of the advance in the X Corps zone reached Line Missouri the same day. The other four divisions, though still as much as short of the line on 9 May, had made long daily gains against scattered delaying forces. In the west, the bulk of the ROK 1st Division advancing up Route 1 between 7 and 9 May levered KPA forces out of successive positions and finally forced them into a general withdrawal. Setting the 15th Regiment in a patrol base 6 miles up Route 1, General Kang Mun-bong pulled his remaining forces back into his No Name fortifications. From other bases in the I, IX and X Corps sectors, patrols doubled the depth of their previous reconnaissance but had no more success in making firm contact than had patrols working from the No Name Line. Available intelligence in formation indicated that the PVA 64th, 12th, 60th, and 20th Armies were completely off the west and west central fronts for refurbishing and that each of the four armies still in those sectors - the 65th, 63rd, 15th and 27th Armies - had only one division forward as a screen while remaining divisions prepared to resume the offensive. Since there were no firm indications that the resumption was an immediate prospect, however, General Van Fleet on 9 May issued plans for returning the Eighth Army to Line Kansas. In the first phase of the return I, IX and X Corps were to attack, tentatively on 12 May, towards Line Topeka running from Munsan-ni east through Chuncheon, then northeast toward Inje. ROK III and I Corps in the east meanwhile were to continue their attack to Line Missouri, a step which would carry them above Line Kansas. On 11 May Van Fleet decided against the Topeka advance after changes in the intelligence picture indicated that PVA/KPA forces were within a few days of reopening their offensive. Air observation of enemy troops where none previously had been seen suggested forward movements under cover of darkness, reports told of large enemy reconnaissance patrols, and both agents and prisoners alleged an early resumption of the Spring Offensive. Extensive smoke screens rose north of the 38th Parallel ahead of IX Corps and above the Hwacheon Reservoir in the X Corps sector. Drawing Van Fleet's particular notice were reports that five armies - the 60th, 15th, 12th, 27th, and 20th - were massing west of the Bukhan for a major attack in the west central sector. In further instructions for defense, Van Fleet ordered the No Name fortifications improved and directed IX Corps commander General William M. Hoge to give special attention to the Bukhan corridor, where the heaviest enemy buildup was reported. Hoge was to place the bulk of the IX Corps artillery on that flank. \\"I want to stop the Chinese here and hurt him,\\" Van Fleet told Hoge. \\"I welcome his attack and want to be strong enough in position and fire power to defeat him.\\" Lavish artillery fire, in particular, was to be used. If gun positions could be kept supplied with ammunition, Van Fleet wanted five times the normal day of fire expended against enemy attacks. As calculated by his supply officer, Colonel Stebbins, the \\"Van Fleet day of fire\\" could be supported for at least seven days, although transportation could become a problem since Stebbins could not haul other supplies while handling that amount of ammunition. Rations and petroleum products already stocked in corps sectors, however, would last for more than seven days. Immediate army reserves for the advance to Line Topeka were to have been the 3rd Division, to be withdrawn from I Corps, and the newly arrived 25th Canadian Infantry Brigade. Though the Topeka advance was off, Van Fleet ordered the Canadians to move north, beginning on 15 May, to Kumnyangjang-ni, southeast of Seoul, and prepare to counter any enemy penetration in the Bukhan or Seoul-Suwon corridors. The 3rd Division was still to pass to army reserve and organize forces capable of reinforcing or counterattacking in the I, IX or X Corps sectors in at least regimental combat team strength on six hours' notice. Beginning on 11 May the 15th Regimental Combat Team assembled near Ich'on, at the intersection of Routes 13 and 20 southeast of Seoul, ready to move on call into the X Corps sector; for operations in support of the IX Corps, the 65th Regimental Combat Team assembled near Kyongan-ni, southeast of Seoul and directly below the Bukhan River corridor; and the 7th Regimental Combat Team assembled in Seoul for missions in the I Corps' sector. The six ROK divisions on the eastern front were to stay forward of the No Name Line, but were not to make further attempts to occupy Line Missouri. In the X Corps' sector, the ROK 5th and 7th Divisions, whose forces had all but reached the Soyang River southwest of Inje, were to fortify their present positions. ROK III and I Corps were to set their four divisions in fortified defenses between the lower bank of the Soyang south of Inje and the town of Kangson-ni, north of Yangyang on the coast, after conducting spoiling attacks on 12 May in the two principal communications centers ahead of them, Inje and Yongdae-ri, the latter located on Route 24 northeast of Inje. The reconnaissance company of the ROK 9th Division already had entered Inje without a fight during the afternoon of 11 May and dispersed an enemy force about a mile beyond the town before retiring on 12 May, but other forces of the two ROK Corps were prevented by distance and moderate resistance from reaching the objectives of their attacks in the one day allotted for them. Light contact along the remainder of the front revealed little about enemy dispositions, but the composite of reports from air observers, agents, civilians, and prisoners made clear by 13 May that major PVA forces had begun to shift eastward from the west and west central sectors. Steady rain and fog all but eliminated further air observation on 14 and 15 May; poor visibility also hampered ground patrols; and a IX Corps reconnaissance-in-force by the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team up the valley northeast of Kap'yong toward what was believed to be a large concentration of enemy forces had to be canceled shortly after it started on the 15th because of the rain and poor road conditions. As much as could be determined by 16 May was that the eastward shift probably extended to the Chuncheon area. A few reports tracing the shift indicated that some PVA units would move beyond Chuncheon. According to a PVA medical officer captured northeast of Seoul on 10 May, the 12th Army and two other armies were scheduled to leave the west central area late on 10 May, march east for four days, then attack the 2nd Division and the ROK divisions on the eastern front. Another captive taken on 13 May in the same general area said that the 15th Army was to march east for three days and attack the 2nd Division in conjunction with KPA attacks on the ROK front. Large enemy groups reported by X Corps observers to be moving east as far as Yanggu on 11 and 12 May were believed to be PVA, and a deserter from the engineer battalion of the 80th Division, 27th Army, picked up on 13 May in the Chuncheon area stated that his battalion had been bridging the Bukhan. The X Corps Intelligence Officer believed it most likely, however, that the forces moving east of the Bukhan as far as Yanggu were from the 39th or 40th Armies, both of which had been in the east central sector for some time. In any event, he considered major PVA operations on the eastern front to be impracticable. Given the logistical difficulties the PVA experienced in supporting offensive operations even in the Seoul area, where the distance to their rear supply bases was shortest and where the roads were more numerous and in better condition than anywhere else, he doubted that they would commit a large force in the eastern mountains where a supply line could not be maintained and where living off the land would be almost impossible. The Eighth Army intelligence staff as of 16 May had no corroborating evidence of the reported movement east of the Bukhan and even had some doubt that the PVA shift extended as far east as Chuncheon. According to the consensus of current estimates of enemy dispositions as of 16 May, KPA I Corps on the west had spread forces eastward toward Route 33, taking over ground previously occupied by the PVA XIX Army Group. The PVA 65th Army astride Route 33 north of Uijongbu and the 63rd Army in the adjacent ground to the east formed the new front of the XIX Army Group. Reports placed the 64th Army northwest of the 65th. West to east, the 60th, 15th and 12th Armies were believed to occupy the new front of the PVA III Army Group from a point above the Bukhan River in the vicinity of Kap'yong eastward almost to Chuncheon. More tentatively located, the 20th and 27th Armies of the PVA IX Army Group were reported to be off the front in the area north of Chuncheon and the group's 26th Army possibly in the same vicinity. The PVA XIII Army Group apparently was still on the east central front, its 40th Army astride Route 17 just above Chuncheon and the 39th Army next to the east with its bulk between the Hwacheon Reservoir and the Soyang River and light forces occupying a bridgehead below the Soyang between Chuncheon and the river town of Naep'yong- ni some upstream to the northeast. On the basis of these dispositions, General Van Fleet continued to believe that the main PVA effort would come in the west-central sector, probably toward the Han River corridor, and would be made by five armies, the 60th, 15th, 12th, 27th and 20th. He also anticipated strong attacks toward Seoul over Route 1 and through the Uijongbu corridor as well as another on the Chuncheon-Hongch'on axis. The actual extent of the PVA shift from the west had been indicated by the few reports of planned and ongoing movements beyond the Bukhan. By 16 May PVA commander Peng Dehuai had moved five armies into the area along the Soyang River between Chuncheon and Inje behind screening forces of the 39th Army and the KPA III Corps. The 60th and 15th Armies of the III Army Group were in the area between Chuncheon and Naep'yong-ni. At and immediately beyond Naep'yong-ni was the 12th Army, now attached to the IX Army Group. Farthest east, the 27th and 20th Armies of the IX Army Group were clustered in the vicinity of Kwandae-ri just west of Inje. Peng planned to launch his main attack on a southeastward course below the Naep'yongni-Kwandae-ri stretch of the Soyang. His reason for shifting the main effort into the higher Taebaek Mountains despite the portended logistical problems may have been because the rugged ridges and sparse road net would reduce to some degree the UN Command's advantage of superior mobility, firepower, and airpower. As revealed by the prisoners taken on 10 and 13 May, the objective of the main effort, to be launched during the evening of 16 May by the 15th, 12th and 27th Armies, was to sever the six ROK divisions on the eastern front from the remainder of the Eighth Army, to annihilate them, and to destroy the 2nd Division. In support of the main effort, KPA V Corps was to attack out of the Inje area in the ROK III Corps sector, and KPA II Corps, which had moved down from Hoeyang where it had been refurbishing since late March, was to attack along the east coast and atop the Taebaeks against ROK I Corps. On the west flank of the main attack, the 60th Army, less its 181st Division, which had been attached to the 12th Army to reinforce the main effort, was to conduct a holding attack against the 1st Marine Division. The XIX Army Group, now stretched out from the Kap'yong area west to Route 33 above Uijongbu, and KPA I Corps, astride Route 1, were to make similar attacks in the IX Corps and I Corps sectors. Battle On 16 May after crossing the Soyang River northwest of Kwandae-ri with its 81st Division in the lead, the 27th Army opened the attack against the ROK 5th and 7th Divisions with hard blows centered at the seam between the two divisions that almost immediately began to dislodge the line regiments. X Corps' commander General Edward Almond authorized the two divisions to withdraw to the No Name Line around midnight. There followed a familiar story of infantry units scattered by PVA attacks while they were attempting to disengage, broken communications, loss of control, a search for missing troops and the reorganization of those that could be found. Reordered forces of the ROK 5th Division were sent out in echelon to the southeast along the 2nd Division's right flank. By midday on 17 May the only infantry units of the ROK 7th Division that had been located were two battalions of the reserve 3rd Regiment which were in position and engaged behind the No Name Line near the village of Sangam-ni () on the primitive road whose stretch northeast to Hyon-ni () and then northwest to Inje was the single route serving the ROK III Corps sector. Engaging the 3rd Regiment were forces of the 81st Division, whose main body had cut southeast through the ground abandoned by the ROK 7th Division to block the road just above Sangam- ni. The 30th Field Artillery Battalion of the ROK 9th Division encountered the roadblock while withdrawing as a result of orders from ROK forward headquarters calling the ROK III and I Corps back to the No Name Line. Though the two corps had held up well under attacks by the KPA 6th and 12th Divisions of the KPA V Corps and the KPA 27th and 2nd Divisions of the KPA II Corps, General Almond's authorization of the ROK 5th and 7th Divisions to retire to the No Name Line had led the ROK headquarters to follow suit on the morning of 17 May. As the two ROK III Corps divisions drew back to No Name positions centered above Hyon-ni, staying scarcely a step ahead of pursuing KPA forces, their artillery battalions (the 30th followed in column by the 11th of the ROK 3rd Division) moved below Hyon-ni toward Sangam-ni. The PVA blocking force waited until the 30th Battalion filled a narrow stretch of road twisting through a steep-sided defile in the heart of its position, then blanketed the artillerymen with fire. In the scramble out of the trap, only the tail-end battery saved its guns and vehicles. By evening the 11th Battalion and the crippled 30th Battalion returned north to firing positions in the Hyon-ni area. ROK III Corps commander General Yu Jae-hung meanwhile sent the Corps' reserve, a regiment of the ROK 9th Division, south from Hyon-ni to deal with the block, but its efforts were futile against the stronger PVA force. With the west flank left open by the collapse of the ROK 7th Division, the ROK III Corps was in danger of being enveloped, or, with the PVA 81st Division continuing to block the road to the rear and the KPA 6th and 12th Divisions still pushing in from the north, of being caught in a squeeze. With the right flank of the 2nd Division no more than sketchily protected by ROK 5th Division units, General Clark L. Ruffner's forces also faced the prospect of being enveloped. As in the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River in late November, the division was again to be threatened from the east after ROK forces gave way while it contended with strong PVA attacks from the north. General Ruffner had manned the left and center of the division's sector south of Naep'yong-ni with the 9th and 38th Infantry Regiments and had reconstituted Task Force Zebra, the tank-infantry group that had performed well in late April, to occupy the line at the right. The French Battalion, the only division reserve, was at Han'gye () on Route 24, about behind the Zebra line, deliberately set there by Ruffner to reinforce quickly the somewhat thin task force position. =38th Infantry and Task Force Zebra= 38th Infantry and Task Force Zebra positions, 16 May 1951 Under earlier orders to send daily patrols to the Soyang in the area immediately east of Chuncheon, the 9th Infantry had deployed one battalion on the No Name Line and two in patrol bases. On the highest ground in the division sector, two battalions of the 38th Infantry occupied a string of prominent heights along the No Name Line, the 3rd at the left, the 1st at the right. out on the west, the 2nd Battalion manned a patrol base that blocked ridgeline and valley approaches to the 3rd Battalion's position. Above the right flank of the 1st Battalion, a provisional company of ROK Rangers held a blocking position on a ridge offering enemy forces a good approach down the boundary between the 38th Infantry and Task Force Zebra. Colonel Coughlin, commander of the 38th, had set the attached Netherlands Battalion on Hills 710 and 975 behind the 1st Battalion with instructions to be prepared to counterattack anywhere in the 1st's sector. Task Force Zebra, led by Lt. Col. Elbridge Brubaker, commander of the 72nd Tank Battalion, now included all but one company of the tank battalion; the 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment; the 1st Ranger Company; the Ivanhoe Security Force (a provisional company of ROK troops originally organized for division rear area security missions); and the ROK 3rd Battalion, 36th Regiment, attached from the ROK 5th Division. The ROK battalion occupied a patrol base along the trace of Line Missouri and the Ivanhoe Security Force a forward blocking position adjacent to the 38th Infantry's ROK Rangers on the west flank. On the No Name Line, the 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry, Company C of the tank battalion and the Ranger Company stood along both Route 24 angling in from the northeast through the Hongch'on River valley and a minor road running down a valley from the northwest and joining Route 24 just behind the task force position. West to east on ridges commanding the two roads were Companies F, E and G and the Rangers. The tanks stood behind barricades of wire and minefields blocking both valleys, though not the roads, which had been left free of obstacles to allow patrols to pass through. Company B of the tank battalion, in reserve, and the trains and command post of the 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry, were at the valley village of Chaun-ni (), on Route 24 behind the lines. Colonel Brubaker's command post was farther down Route 24 at the village of Putchaetful (). Daylight probes of the Zebra patrol base and sharp patrol skirmishes close to the lines of the 38th Infantry were forerunners of attacks by one division of the PVA 15th Army and two divisions of the 12th. In the 12th Army's attack, launched about dusk, the press of 35th Division forces along the 38th Infantry - Task Force Zebra boundary forced the Ivanhoe Security Force and adjacent company of ROK Rangers back against Company F, 23rd Infantry, before defensive fires smothered the assault. On the 12th's east wing, the 92nd Regiment, 31st Division, attacking the Zebra patrol base expelled and disorganized the ROK 3rd Battalion, 36th Regiment. ROK soldiers streamed through the main Zebra line until midnight, most of them down the northwest valley defended by the 3rd Platoon of Company C, 72nd Tank Battalion. French troops at Han'gye collected the disordered groups as they continued down Route 24 and assembled them for reorganization and screening for enemy infiltration. Shortly after midnight, fifty or sixty PVA leading a column of the 92nd Regiment in pursuit of the ROK charged through the opening in the northernmost of two wire aprons strung across the valley. Forced off the road by fire from the tankers, the PVA deployed to the left and right, exploding mines and setting off trip flares. The larger body of PVA to the rear deployed under the light of the flares, and successive lines of skirmishers attempted to break the wire and reach the tanks. The 3rd Platoon, reinforced by the 2nd Platoon, shot down waves of charging troops while artillery fire walked up the valley above the wire. When the PVA gave up the effort shortly before dawn, bodies hanging in the wire, sprawled in the minefields and lying on the road and high ground to the north numbered about four hundred and fifty. Concentrating on Company E on Hill 755 at the center of the patrol base, a force from the PVA 45th Division, 15th Army, though delayed and hurt while breaching minefields and wire entanglements, drove off the company with the second wave of its assault. About 02:30, as the attack spread to Company F on the left flank of the split position, Colonel Coughlin ordered the patrol base force to withdraw behind the 3rd Battalion. Apparently spent by the effort to take Hill 755 and blanketed by covering artillery fire, the PVA made no immediate attempt to follow the withdrawal. At the right of the 1st Battalion, platoons of Companies A and C occupying Hills 1051 () and 914 () and a saddle between turned back a series of attacks opened at dusk by small units of the 35th Division in concert with the assaults that drove back the two provisional ROK companies along the 38th Infantry-Task Force Zebra boundary. But following these apparent tests of the defenses, a full attack by the division's 103rd Regiment about 02:00 forced Company A forces out of the saddle, opening the way for a sweep behind the 1st Battalion or for a deep penetration down a valley leading southeast to Route 24 at Putchaetful, well behind the positions of Task Force Zebra. Colonel Coughlin kept the gap under mortar and artillery fire for the rest of the night and ordered the Netherlands Battalion to send a company north from Hill 975 at first light to close it. General Ruffner directed the French Battalion to send a company up the valley from Putchaetful to clean out any PVA who sifted through the mortar and artillery barrages. Moving from Hill 975 toward Hill 1051 on the near side of the saddle, the Dutch company lacked the numbers to push through PVA who by daylight closed in around a platoon of Company A on the 1051 crest. The remainder of the Netherlands Battalion, under Colonel Coughlin's order, joined its forward company about 09:30, but, finding that Hill 1051 had fallen to the PVA, the Dutch commander, Lt. Col. William Eekhout, held up his advance while he softened the height and the saddle beyond with artillery. French troops meanwhile advancing up the valley northwest of Putchaetful engaged enemy forces less than above Route 24. An estimated five hundred PVA had worked their way into the valley. A Chinese-speaking radioman with the Netherlands Battalion at midmorning intercepted a PVA order to \\"send all troops east of Hill 1051.\\" That neither sender nor recipient of the order was identifiable made estimating the strength of the forces involved impossible, but the PVA obviously planned to exploit the breakthrough. Expecting that the Dutch attack to close the gap would start shortly, General Ruffner ordered the French to assist by reinforcing the drive up the valley; he urged speed so that the gap would be eliminated before the PVA could pour troops through. Before the Dutch and French were able to move, \\"literally thousands\\" of PVA, according to 38th Infantry estimates, were passing through the gap by 11:00. Groups moving along the far edge of the saddle widened the opening by forcing a platoon of Company C off Hill 914. PVA killed or wounded by artillery pounding the saddle and the area below it marked the paths of the larger number veering east toward the front of Task Force Zebra and of the remainder heading down the valley toward the French. Viewing this scene from the vicinity of Hill 1051, Colonel Eekhout continued to hold up the Dutch attack. After the opening PVA attacks and ROK withdrawals had exposed the division's east flank and bared the Task Force Zebra front, General Ruffner had asked General Almond to return the remainder of the 23rd Infantry Regiment from Corps' reserve for use in thickening the Zebra position. Almond released the regiment about 11:30 after the PVA strength on the Zebra front began to build. Taking command of the front, including all Zebra forces and the French Battalion, at 14:30, Colonel Chiles concentrated the 2nd Battalion in the left half of the sector, put in the 3rd Battalion on the right, and placed the 1st Battalion in reserve just above Han'gye. Except for exchanging fire with Company F on the left flank, the PVA moving onto the front were inactive throughout the afternoon, but their number continued to grow as the Netherlands Battalion, though Colonel Coughlin on orders from General Ruffner instructed it to attack at 13:00, failed to advance. General Ruffner sensed from the Dutch failure to move that Colonel Coughlin \\"was looking half way over the shoulder\\" instead of concentrating on the essential task of closing the gap. Ruffner again ordered the Dutch to attack, this time at 15:00, and started forward by helicopter to direct the attempt himself, but his craft crashed on a hilltop near the 1st Battalion command post. Neither Ruffner nor his pilot was seriously injured, but Ruffner was stranded well beyond the time set for opening the attack. Hiking to the battalion command post to meet a rescue helicopter sent out by the division surgeon, he returned to his headquarters after receiving assurances that the Dutch had jumped off on time. There he learned that PVA on and around Hill 1051 had stymied the Dutch and that PVA on the far side of the gap had pushed Company C completely out of position and forced its remnants back to the position of Company F, 23rd Infantry. Ruffner now considered two courses open to him, to commit greater strength against the PVA penetration or to set troops along its southwest shoulder, a move which, with the French Battalion blocking the valley in the 23rd Infantry sector, would, if somewhat thinly, seal off the penetration. He opted for the second course. By evening he had the Netherlands Battalion on the way to occupy Hill 975 () and thus extend the right flank of Company A, 38th Infantry, now on Hill 790 () about a mile below Hill 1051, and had the 2nd Battalion of the 38th moving up to defend a ridge curving southeast of Hill 975 to Hill 691. =Reinforcing and realigning X Corps= In search of reserves to back up his hard-pressed central forces, Ruffner at mid-morning had asked General Almond's permission to pull the two patrol base battalions of the 9th Infantry out of the left sector, which was obviously outside the zone of the PVA's main attack. Almond instructed him to plan the move but deferred a final decision until he could determine how the removal of the two battalions would affect the dispositions of the 1st Marine Division. Almond raised the matter with General Van Fleet during the afternoon while apprising the Army commander of the Corps' situation and requesting reinforcement. Given the course of PVA attacks and the enemy units so far identified, Almond believed that Peng Dehuai was attempting to turn the right flank of X Corps with the 27th Army, would wait until the 27th seriously threatened the flank, then would make his main effort down the Chuncheon- Hongch'on axis with the III Army Group. Prisoners taken during a local but stiff four-hour nighttime attack on a battalion of the US 7th Marine Regiment occupying a forward blocking position on Route 29 had identified the 180th Division of the 60th Army, indicating that the full III Army Group was in position for an attack such as Almond anticipated. Almond doubted that X Corps could hold against a PVA move of this design unless the Corps' hard-hit center and tattered right were strengthened. In immediate reinforcement he asked for a regimental combat team to help stabilize his right flank and for one heavy and two medium artillery battalions to increase long range fire on enemy concentration areas. To enable the 2nd Division to place more of its strength in the threatened areas, General Van Fleet moved the IX Corps-X Corps boundary east. In the resulting shift of units, the 7th Division on the IX Corps' right was to take over part of the 1st Marine Division's sector, and Marines were to relieve the 9th and 38th Regiments, freeing them for employment farther east. Van Fleet also ordered ROK III and I Corps back to Line Waco, which he had delineated in his withdrawal plan of 28 April, some to south of the No Name Line. Allowing ROK III Corps no option, he ordered General Yu to eliminate the enemy roadblock at Sangam-ni so that all vehicles and weapons could be evacuated. On X Corps' right, General Almond was to organize positions angling southeast to a juncture with ROK III Corps on Line Waco above the village of Habaejae (). Reinforcements ordered to the X Corps' sector by Van Fleet included the ROK 8th Division, which was to move north, initially to Chech'on, as soon as security battalions and National Police could take over its anti- guerrilla mission in southern Korea. An earlier arrival would be the 3rd Division less its 7th and 65th Regimental Combat Teams. Geared for a move to the X Corps' sector since 11 May, the leading battalion of the 15th Regimental Combat Team made the trip from its assembly area southeast of Seoul to Hoengsong by midmorning on 17 May. The remainder of the force, which included the division's medium artillery battalion, completed the move early on 18 May. Also sent east by Van Fleet were a battery of 155-mm. guns and a battery of 8-inch howitzers, both taken from IX Corps. These additions gave Almond a total of five battalions and four batteries of medium and heavy artillery. In shifting Marines east into the 2nd Division's sector, Almond initially ordered the relief of the 9th Infantry by midday on 18 May. Maj. Gen. Gerald C. Thomas, the new commander of the 1st Marine Division, made the move by pulling the 7th Marines back from their forward patrol base and blocking positions to relieve the 1st Marine Regiment on the No Name Line at the division's right, then by sidestepping the 1st Marines onto the 9th Infantry's front. The 5th Marine Regiment, on the division's left flank, later were to swing roundabout into the 38th Infantry's sector after being replaced by forces of the 7th Division. Late on 17 May Almond authorized both divisional and Corps' artillery units to quintuple their ammunition expenditure (the Van Fleet day of fire) and directed them to concentrate fire on likely avenues of enemy approach within of defensive positions. Ammunition expenditure would increase dramatically, reaching 41,350 rounds and 1,187 tons on 18 May and even higher amounts afterward. As had been predicted by the Eighth Army supply officer, sufficient ammunition to support the heavy expenditure was maintained at the army supply point serving X Corps, but not without difficulty. The supply point stocks of two days of fire at the Van Fleet rate dwindled to one and could not be raised above that amount. The high consumption also strained Corps' and unit transportation in hauling ammunition from the army supply point at Wonju to the base corps dump at Hongch'on, a round trip of over , and from Hongch'on to artillery units. The use of MPQ radars to direct bombers in close support missions at night, a technique employed only sparingly until April, also reached a peak, particularly in guiding B-29 sorties. On 17 May Far East Air Forces commander General George E. Stratemeyer directed that no fewer than twelve of the medium bombers be committed to the nightly support. Typical of one night's effort was a drop of three hundred fifty 500-pound proximity-fuzed general-purpose bombs on twenty targets selected by X Corps' headquarters, all of them enemy troop concentrations, some within of the front. Casualty estimates by follow-up patrols and the statements of captives attested to the precision of the radar guided attacks. In the 2nd Division sector, the main nighttime targets of air and artillery attack-most observed in their approach well before dark on 17 May were fresh PVA columns coming in on the positions of the 38th Infantry, passing through the gap, and moving east across the front of the 23rd Infantry. Crowding the front of the 3rd Battalion, 38th Infantry, forces of the 135th Regiment, 45th Division, broke the wire and penetrated the line, but with losses too high to be able to withstand counterattacks. Sweeps to clear rear areas and a final counterattack to drive out PVA who had occupied some of the bunkers restored the battalion's position early on 18 May. To the east, the course of battle verged on the calamitous and chaotic for PVA and 2nd Division forces alike. From late afternoon traffic on the artillery net Colonel Coughlin estimated the strength of the new influx of PVA forces in the gap area to be 3000. Early evening reports from the Netherlands Battalion on Hill 975 tended higher. The Dutch reported PVA in waves of a thousand each crossing the saddle between Hills 1051 and 914 and walking upright through the artillery bombardment rather than in the crouch that soldiers tend to assume when moving under heavy fire. Those not hit were simply stepping over the fallen to continue moving down the valley. On the receiving end of the PVA stream, the 23rd Infantry commander, Colonel Chiles, reported to General Ruffner that bombing attacks and artillery barrages rolling up the valley were carpeting the defile with PVA casualties. Coming through the valley was the PVA 181st Division. Its leading units had the French Battalion under attack by dark. Sharply hit from the front and flanked on the left after two hours under assault, the French withdrew south to hills edging Route 24 just above Putchaetful. The battalion gained respite from attack for the remainder of the night, but its withdrawal opened the left flank of the 23rd Infantry and gave the PVA free access to Route 24 between Putchaetful and Chaun-ni. Small PVA groups infiltrating Chaun-ni about 03:30 harassed the command posts of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 23rd Infantry and Company C, 72nd Tank Battalion, and blew up a loaded ammunition truck before pulling back into the high ground west of the village. Meanwhile, the bulk of the division filled the hills bordering Route 24 on the west between Chaun-ni and the French Battalion. Forces on the south reengaged the French while detachments slipping out of the hills about daylight mined the road below Chaun-ni and at a second point farther south within view of the French. Along the front of the 23rd Infantry, the PVA attacked Company F on the left flank with fire and assault until about midnight, then broke contact and moved east. The reach of an apparent general PVA movement east and then south had been indicated earlier when the ROK 5th Division units echeloned along the right flank of the 23rd reported heavy pressure and, with General Almond's approval, withdrew behind a lateral stretch of the Hongch'on River almost due east of Chaun-ni. Leading the southeastward swing was the 31st Division, sliding east onto the front of the 23rd Infantry was the 35th Division, and approaching from the northwest to join the move was the 34th Division, which, when inserted between the 31st and 35th Divisions on 18 May, would fully commit the PVA 12th Army. The 4th Platoon, Company C, 72nd Tank Battalion, moved out to the immediate right rear of the 3rd Battalion following the ROK withdrawal, but a wide expanse of ground along the right of the regiment remained open. With an uncovered flank inviting envelopment by the PVA forces sweeping it on the east and its withdrawal route blocked by the 181st Division, the 23rd Infantry by daylight on 18 May was in a situation similar to that of ROK III Corps. The situation in the sectors of the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 38th Infantry, by morning of 18 May was equally critical. Between these two battalions, the position of the Netherlands Battalion on Hill 975 had crumbled of its own accord early the previous evening when most of the Dutch troops, after witnessing the flow of PVA through the gap, streamed off the height. \\"They have seen so many Chinamen and [so much] firing today,\\" Colonel Coughlin explained to General Ruffner, and they \\"think that if our air and artillery can't stop them then there's not much they can do.\\" Though their commander, Colonel Eekhout, regained control quickly, Colonel Coughlin, at General Ruffner's instruction, sent the battalion into an assembly near Hang'ye for rest and reorganization and stretched out the forces of Company A and F to man the vacated position. Repair of the line at Hill 975 was still under way when 44th Division forces broke it farther west at the juncture of Companies B and A. PVA coming through lapped around Company B on Hill 724 and piled up on Hill 710 () behind Companies A and F. Company E, sent west from the Hill 975-Hill 691 ridge by Coughlin to plug the new gap, bogged down in encounters at Hill 710, while PVA moving south off 710 surrounded and attacked the command posts of the 1st and 2nd Battalions collocated at the foot of the height and blocked the regimental supply road farther south. In what turned out to be an overreaction to the deeper PVA incursion, Coughlin ordered back both Company E from Hill 710 and Company G from the 975-691 ridge and sent a platoon of his tank company and a detachment of Dutch troops up the supply road to clear the command post area. With little help needed from the rifle companies, the tank- infantry team eliminated the PVA roadblock and opened a way out for the beleaguered command post group by morning of the 18th. None of the three forward companies was under heavy pressure at daylight, but Company B remained surrounded, and Companies A and F were isolated by the PVA behind them. To the east, the 23rd Infantry was strained by heavy morning attacks, especially Company F on the left flank and Company I on the right. As the attacks began to lash the 23rd, General Ruffner convinced General Almond that the 23rd and the adjoining three companies of the 38th had to withdraw immediately if they were to withdraw in good order. Almond instructed Ruffner to establish a line running from the still solid position of Coughlin's 3rd Battalion in the Hill 800 complex southeast through Han'gye to Hill 693 beyond Route 24. To meet General Van Fleet's earlier order that X Corps tie in with ROK III Corps on Line Waco, Almond extended the line another to the vicinity of Habaejae; along the extension he planned initially to set up blocking positions using available units of the ROK 5th, 3rd and 7th Divisions. In earlier moves to deepen the defense in the 38th Infantry sector, General Ruffner during the night had shifted the 3rd Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, east to positions behind Colonel Coughlin's 3rd Battalion and shortly before daylight had ordered the 2nd Battalion, 9th Infantry to move roundabout and come up on the right in the ground just west of Han'gye. Upon relief by the 1st Marines around midday the 9th's remaining battalion was now to insert itself between the 3rd and 2nd as the regiment developed defenses along the divisions modified line between Hill 800 and Route 24. During the shift of battalions, which would continue well into the afternoon, the 3rd Battalion and later the 2nd were to send forces forward to break the ring of PVA around Company B, 38th Infantry and clear Hill 710 behind Companies A and F to assist their withdrawal. Once the three companies were back, the 38th Infantry, less its 3rd Battalion, was to become division reserve. For the 23rd Infantry, assigned to occupy the new line east of Route 24, the major problem in getting back to the line was the road block below Chaun-ni. Threatened in particular by the block were the convoys of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, Company C, 72nd Tank Battalion, and two platoons of the heavy mortar company, all located in and around Chaun-ni with no alternative withdrawal route for wheeled vehicles. To clear the road for the trains, Colonel Chiles organized a two-pronged attack, the 3rd Battalion to make sure that the east side of the road was clear, the 2nd Battalion to take on the task of forcing back the PVA occupying the heights bordering the road on the west. Company C, 72nd Tank Battalion was to bring up the rear, fending off the PVA still pressing the line if they attempted to follow the disengagement. Two platoons of tanks from Company B, 72nd Tank Battalion were to assist the attack of the 2nd Battalion from firing positions in the river bottom east of the road opposite the PVA blocking position. The PVA let the 3rd Battalion go when it disengaged, but heavy tank fire, time on target artillery fire and air strikes were needed to keep PVA forces off the tail of the 2nd Battalion as it peeled off the line in a column of companies. Reaching the Chaun-ni area by early afternoon, the 3rd Battalion occupied hills opposite the roadblock while the 2nd Battalion attempted to push the PVA away from the road. With the PVA holding the advantage of superior numbers on commanding ground, after an hour Colonel Chiles realized that his forces could not clear the PVA position. The danger of being rolled up from the north meanwhile was growing as PVA coming into the area vacated by the 3rd Battalion joined the attempt to follow the rearward move. Electing a faster, if riskier, course, Chiles ordered the trains to run by the roadblock with two platoons of tanks from Company C as escort. The 2nd Battalion in the meantime was to cross the road at Chaun-ni and withdraw with the 3rd. During the morning the intelligence officer of the 72nd Tank Battalion at Putchaetful had received a French report that PVA had mined the road, and he had relayed the report to an enlisted man at the command post of the 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry at Chaun-ni. At that point the information had somehow gone astray. A costly consequence of the communications lapse came when the convoy of wheeled vehicles interspersed among tanks traveling in fourth gear attempted its run. A mine in a field planted below Chaun-ni disabled the lead tank, trucks piled up behind, and PVA fire from the hills and draws to the west chased drivers and tank crews as they dropped down a embankment off the east shoulder of the road and splashed across the Hongch'on River to reach cover behind the tanks of Company B in the stream bed. The second tank in column shoved the abandoned trucks off the road and safely bypassed the knocked-out tank, but lost a track in the minefield near the French position. Observing both explosions from Chaun-ni, a staff officer of the 2nd Battalion ordered the remainder of the convoy to move east off the road just below the village and follow the stream bed south. The tanks churned in behind those of Company B, but under small arms, machine gun, and mortar fire ranging in from the west, panicky truck drivers drove helter-skelter into the hills beyond the stream bed. Some vehicles caught fire; ammunition trucks exploded; others eventually were halted by one or another accident of terrain, drivers and riders joined the withdrawal of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions. Stragglers and abandoned communications equipment, weapons, and personal gear dotted the track of the two battalions as they made a tiring march under flanking fire from the west for part of the way and under drenching rainstorms that broke about 18:30. By midnight both units were behind the 1st Battalion, which during the afternoon had occupied the first ridge east of Route 24 on the new defense line. The 3rd Battalion filled lower ground between the ridge and the road while the 2nd Battalion and the French battalion, which had disengaged from the PVA roadblock force as the two battalions east of the road had come abreast, assembled to the rear for the remainder of the night. As the two remaining tank platoons of Company C brought up the rear of the withdrawal they were ordered by the company commander to leave the road at Chaun-ni and follow the stream bed south, as Company B already had done, one platoon missed the turnoff point and came upon the disabled tank below town. Unable to turn around in the narrow road space between the embankment on the east and steep slopes on the west and faced with the danger of mines to the south, the tankers chose the nearly vertical drop on their left. Two tanks snapped drive shafts in the plunge. The two immobilized tanks raised Company C's tank losses since 16 May to five. The trains of Company C, the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, and half the heavy mortar company, more than 150 vehicles, many with heavy weapons, ammunition, or other gear aboard, had been left behind and by dark were being picked over by the PVA. Casualties suffered by the 23rd Infantry and its attachments totaled 72 killed, 158 wounded, and 190 missing. In return for these losses in men and equipment, the regiment exacted an estimated 2,228 killed and 1,400 wounded and took 22 prisoners from the PVA 31st, 35th and 181st Divisions. West of Route 24, by late afternoon the 9th Infantry reinforced by the Netherlands Battalion and Company G of the 38th had occupied positions between Hill 800 and Route 24, but had not cleared a way through the PVA around Company B and behind Companies A and F. In a new plan for getting the three units out, Colonel Coughlin used a rolling artillery barrage, coupling it to an umbrella of circling aircraft. For ten minutes ahead of the withdrawal, set for 18:00, seven battalions of artillery, a mix of light, medium and heavy guns, were to fire across the front of the companies, then at 18:00 were to place concentrations on Hill 710 and to box in the three companies as they shifted east and withdrew down the 975-691 ridge. A liaison plane overhead was to control the delivery of air strikes and adjustment of the box as the companies moved and also was to relay all other communications. A sudden, severe thunderstorm breaking twenty minutes after the start of the withdrawal drove all planes back to their bases and thus not only eliminated air support, but also forced the artillery to stop firing the protective barrage and interrupted radio contact between Coughlin's headquarters and the withdrawing units. Small groups filtering through the lines of the 9th Infantry during the remainder of the night were an indication of the final disruption caused by the storm. Head counts on the morning of 19 May were two officers and eighty-one men for Company A, no officers and seventy-four men for Company B, and no officers and eighty-one men for Company F. Casualties had reduced the other companies of both the 1st and 2nd Battalions to similar figures. Officer losses in the 2nd Battalion were especially high, among them the battalion commander, battalion executive officer, battalion operations officer, and two company commanders. The X Corps' line shaped by the withdrawals and shifts on 18 May amounted to a deep salient with the 3rd Battalion, 38th Infantry, at its apex in the Hill 800 complex and the 1st Marine Division presenting a solid face toward Chuncheon on its northwest shoulder. Along its upper northeast shoulder, the 9th Infantry and 23rd Infantry carried the line from the Hill 800 mass beyond Han'gye to a point about short of Hill 683 (), which General Almond had set as the eastern limit of the 2nd Division's new sector. Hill 683 had fallen to the PVA, however, when the ROK 5th Division forces that had taken position along the Hongch'on River east of Chaun-ni were driven back and disorganized during the day by the PVA 34th Division. Units regrouped by nightfall, a mix of three battalions of infantry from the 35th and 36th Regiments and a company of engineers, were clustered around the village of Hasolch'i () located on a lateral mountain track south of Hill 683. Pulling out of contact at the southern end of the PVA 81st Division's roadblock at Sangam-ni early in the day, the bulk of the 3rd Regiment engineer battalion and the tank destroyer company of the ROK 7th Division now defended the X Corps' east flank from positions just below the village of P'ungam-ni (), southeast of Hasolch'i. Of the 7th Division's other forces, about 700 had been corralled far to the south in Chech'on; another group had been found at the village of Soksa-ri (), located on Route 20 over southeast of P'ungam-ni in the ROK III Corps' sector. ROK troops straggling into the area just north and east of Soksa-ri by nightfall attested to the misfortunes of the ROK 3rd and 9th Divisions when they had attempted to withdraw to Line Waco. In starting the move down the road from Hyon-ni, the ROK III Corps' commander, General Yu, had ordered the 9th Division to take the lead and deal with the PVA roadblock at Sangam-ni while the 3rd Division, bringing up the rear, handled any KPA attempts to roll up the column from the north. By midmorning Yu's forces were caught in the predictable squeeze, the PVA 81st Division holding its Sangam-ni position against the 9th Division's efforts to reduce it while forces of the KPA 6th and 12th Divisions closed in on the 3rd Division in the Hyon-ni area. Both ROK divisions broke away in disorder into the heights east of the road, leaving behind all remaining artillery pieces and more than three hundred vehicles. Paths through the mountains channeled the disorganized troops southeast toward Soksa-ri. Out of radio contact with his forces since early morning, but informed of their southeasterly movement by air observers, General Yu air-dropped to some groups orders assigning them to Line Waco positions. He also set up straggler lines in the Soksa-ri area, but by nightfall had regained control of forces in little more than battalion strength. While Yu struggled to reorder his two divisions and deploy them on Line Waco, General Almond ordered additional modifications of the X Corps' front to straighten and shorten the line and to shift 2nd Division forces farther east into the weakly defended sectors of the ROK 5th and 7th Divisions. The 5th Marines, now scheduled to take over the western portion of the 2nd Division's sector during the afternoon of 19 May, were to occupy positions centered some south of Hill 800 which would eliminate the bulge manned by the 3rd Battalion, 38th Infantry, in the Hill 800 mass and the two adjoining battalions of the 9th Infantry. Unaware that the 800 complex would be abandoned, the PVA 45th Division meanwhile suffered unnecessarily in nightlong attempts to take it. Successive assault waves of the fresh 133rd Regiment were shattered, mainly by heavy concentrations of artillery fire. On the crest of Hill 800, where the PVA centered most of their charges, the men of Company K, 38th Infantry, in fact did little fighting themselves but simply sat inside their bunkers and allowed the PVA to enter their lines, then called down a blanket of artillery fire. The PVA pulled back about dawn on 19 May, leaving behind some eight hundred dead. The new line of the 2nd Division, to be occupied on 19 May, cut Route 24 just below Han'gye on the west and reached across lateral ridges eastward, into what had become enemy territory, through Hill 683 to the village of Nuron-ni (), above P'ungam-ni. General Ruffner assigned the 23rd Infantry to the central sector centered on Hill 683. Given the 15th Regimental Combat Team of the 3rd Division by Almond as a replacement for the 38th Infantry's going into Corps' reserve, Ruffner ordered the 15th initially to occupy the P'ungam-ni area as a preliminary to moving forward to the Nuron-ni sector of the line. Both the 9th Infantry and the 15th Regimental Combat Team thus faced the prospect of having to fight to gain the line they were to defend, but, once the two regiments were on the line, the 2nd Division would hold good positions looking down into the valley of the Naech'on River, a westward flowing tributary of the Hongch'on. To help strengthen the X Corps' eastern sector, Van Fleet at midnight on 18 May ordered the remainder of the 3rd Division eastward from the Seoul area, the 7th Regimental Combat Team to move on 19 May, the 65th Regimental Combat Team on 20 May. General Almond directed the division, less its 15th Regimental Combat Team, which was to remain attached to the 2nd Division, to protect X Corps' east flank from enemy attacks out of the sector of the muddled ROK III Corps. 3rd Division commander General Robert H. Soule was initially to concentrate forces at Pangnimni, located on Route 20 south of Soksa-ri, then reconnoiter and set up blocking positions in the Soksa-ri area. From Hoengsong, where 3rd Division headquarters had set up on moving east with the 15th Regimental Combat Team, Soule moved a tactical command post group to the Pangnim-ni area early on 19 May and sent his reconnaissance company up Route 20 to patrol as far as Hajinbu-ri, east of Soksa-ri. The company found the road clear and made contact with ROK III Corps' troops in the Hajinbu-ri area. On its return run during the afternoon, the company left a platoon in Soksa-ri to watch a mountain road reaching the village from Sangam-ni and Habaejae to the northwest, then moved on to Changp'yong-ni (), southwest of Soksa-ri. There the 3rd Battalion, 7th Infantry, first to arrive from the west, blocked Route 20 and mountain trails coming in from the northwest. Reaching the area after dark, the remainder of the 7th Infantry assembled at Ami-don, south of Changp'yong-ni. At the right of the 2nd Division to the northwest, the 15th Regimental Combat Team attacked through the ROK 3rd Regiment at 11:00 to seize P'ungam-ni and high ground to the northwest along the trail leading to Nuron- ni on the modified No Name Line another to the north. Moving against light resistance, the combat team consolidated positions on its objective after dark. As the 15th moved beyond the village, the ROK 3rd Regiment and smaller units of the ROK 7th Division in the area advanced through light to moderate opposition to positions north and northeast of P'ungam-ni, the latter along a trail leading to Habaejae. At the new left of the 2nd Division along Route 24, the PVA 181st Division wheeling out of its roadblock near Chaun-ni reengaged the 23rd Infantry just above Han'gye shortly before dawn and kept the 1st and 3rd Battalions pinned in position until counterattacks, artillery fire, and air strikes called in under gradually clearing skies finally forced a release about midday. The two battalions occupied positions straddling Route 24 on the new line below Han'gye by early evening. While the 2nd Battalion moved east to a centrally located reserve position along the lateral track leading to Hasolch'i, the attached French Battalion attempted to take position on the regimental right and make contact with a unit of the ROK 36th Regiment located northwest of Hasolch'i in the sector to be occupied by the 9th Infantry. But PVA stoutly defending an intervening height prevented the French from closing ranks with the ROK. It was well after dark before the 9th Infantry completed its eastward shift into its new sector above Hasolch'i. First to arrive, the 1st Battalion moved up on the right of the ROK 35th Regiment into positions northeast of Hasolch'i looking down into the valley of a small stream that fed the Naech'on River. The 2nd Battalion took position behind the forces of the ROK 36th Regiment to await daylight before relieving the ROK and extending westward toward the French Battalion. With a similar objective, the 3rd Battalion assembled near Hasolch'i to await morning before moving up on the right of the 1st Battalion to close the gap between the 9th Infantry and the 15th Regimental Combat Team in the P'ungam-ni area. The ROK III Corps' sector remained a scene of scattered forces throughout 19 May, troops trickling into collecting points along Route 20, some of both the 3rd and 9th Divisions taking up random positions about above the road. None, despite General Yu's air-dropped orders the day before, stopped on Line Waco some farther north. The one fortunate circumstance was an absence of enemy contact. In marked contrast, ROK I Corps all but completed an orderly withdrawal to Line Waco, both its divisions moving along the coast, the Capital in the lead and the 11th, though not in contact, prudently bounding south by regiment in bringing up the rear. Leading the way west along Line Waco, the 26th Regiment of the Capital Division refused the Corps' inland flank left open by ROK III Corps. By nightfall on 19 May, the full PVA IX Army Group stood opposite X Corps' new eastern front between Han'gye and Soksa-ri. Though the group remained generally on a southeastward course, its attached 12th Army was turning more to the south on the front of the 2nd Division with four divisions abreast: the 181st already was in the Han'gye area; the 35th was approaching next to the east; the 34th was entering the area above Hasolch'i, where its leading forces had stopped the French Battalion at the right of the 23d Infantry; and the bulk of the 31st now was located above P'ungam-ni after being forced out of the village by the 15th Regimental Combat Team. Making a fast march to the southeast of P'ungam-ni, the 93rd Regiment, 31st Division was nearing Soksa-ri on Route 20. Using the mountain road running southeast from Sangam-ni through Habaejae to Soksa-ri as its axis, the 27th Army also was headed for the Soksa- ri area, advancing with its three divisions in column, the 81st still in the lead after helping to rout ROK III Corps, the 79th and 80th trailing in the vicinity of Habaejae. Behind the 27th Army, the 20th Army, in group reserve, was beginning to move southeast from the Kwandae-ri area along the Soyang River. Coming from the Hyon-ni area on a line of march projecting to Hajinbu- ri were the KPA 6th and 12th Divisions of V Corps and moving toward Hajinbu-ri on a parallel course just to the east were the KPA 2nd and 27th Divisions of II Corps, which, after failing in frontal attacks against ROK I Corps, had shifted west in an apparent attempt to envelop the ROK. PVA/KPA action decidedly had slackened on the X Corps' front during the afternoon of 19 May after the 181st Division gave up its attack on the 23rd Infantry in the Han'gye area. But, with PVA continuing to mass ahead of the 2nd Division, the slack appeared to be mostly a result of attempts to move fresh units forward to take over the assault. Although the pell-mell withdrawal of ROK III Corps had taken its scrambled forces out of contact, the passage of PVA in strength southeastward through Habaejae and beyond presaged heavy action along Route 20. It seemed that enemy forces would not only quickly revive their drive against X and ROK III Corps but, with strong PVA reserves and KPA divisions on the move, that they would increase it. =The PVA overextend= On 18 May, after the PVA had reached P'ungam-ni, then the deepest point of penetration, and as the substantial sweep of PVA around the 2nd Division into the sectors of the collapsing ROK units had become apparent, UN Commander General Matthew Ridgway suggested that General Van Fleet attempt to relieve the pressure on his forces in the east by attacking in the west to threaten enemy lines of communication in the Iron Triangle. Ridgway recommended a two-division attack moving on the Route 33 axis towards Ch'orwon. He thought such an attack would have a good chance of succeeding since intelligence indicated that only four PVA armies occupied the sector of the front west of Chuncheon and since Peng Dehuai would need at least a week or ten days to shift any material part of his mass from the east to oppose the advance. Nor had PVA/KPA forces on the western front shown much aggressiveness. Enemy attacks had forced back some patrol base and outpost units and had tested the main line in both the I Corps and IX Corps sectors, but these attacks had been isolated affairs, not coordinated actions in a concerted holding operation. Judging PVA/KPA forces in the east central area to be clearly overextended after he reconnoitered the front on 19 May, Ridgway enlarged his concept to take advantage of their vulnerability and ordered Van Fleet to attack across the entire front. Agreeing that the PVA/KPA forces could be trapped, Van Fleet laid out an operation that he believed could produce decisive results if the attack moved fast enough. Though stabilizing the line in the east remained a problem, he now viewed that task with no great alarm even though PVA/KPA forces were deepening and strengthening their penetration. If for no other reason, he expected their logistical difficulties in the mountains to slow if not stop their advance within a matter of days; they would have created only a \\"long bag\\" that could closed behind them by rapid drives to block their main routes of resupply and withdrawal. Van Fleet's plan called for I Corps, IX Corps and part of the 1st Marine Division at the left of X Corps to advance on 20 May toward the Munsan-Chuncheon segment of Line Topeka. Once the Topeka segment was occupied, strikes to start closing the bag were to be made toward the Iron Triangle, one up Route 3 to secure a road center in the Yongp'yong River valley some above Uijongbu, another up Route 17 beyond Chuncheon to seize the complex of road junctions at the west end of the Hwacheon Reservoir. There were several reasons to doubt that the 2nd Division could stand on the Han'gye-Nuron-ni line in the X Corps sector. The line was long, there were gaps, and PVA still occupied some of the important ground. General Almond consequently ordered the 2nd Division to withdraw further and the 1st Marine Division to adjust its neighboring positions in accommodation. In anticipation of penetrations of X Corps' lines, Almond also acquired the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team from IX Corps for use as a fire brigade in counterattacks. The passage of PVA 27th Army units through the Habaejae area and, farther north, the movement of 20th Army forces in the same southeasterly direction also raised the possibility that the PVA intended to sweep east along Route 20 behind ROK III Corps, turn the east flank of the X Corps, or both. The PVA 93rd Regiment, 31st Division reinforced this possibility when the regiment announced its arrival in Soksa-ri by driving the platoon of the 3rd Division's reconnaissance company out of town during the night of 19 May and by stopping a battalion of the 7th Infantry that attempted to regain the town on the 20th. The 81st Division, 27th Army also revealed its approach on 20 May by engaging the ROK 23rd Regiment, 3rd Division about north of Soksa- ri. Yet even as the PVA IX Army Group appeared to be bringing up reserves and disposing forces for continuing its drive, there were indications that the offensive was losing impetus. Under a pummeling by B-29s, which dropped a hundred seventy tons of proximity-fused bombs ahead of the 2nd Division during the night of 19 May, the PVA 12th Army developed only one attack of any size by daylight, this by a 34th Division force of about five hundred men against Company C, 9th Infantry, northeast of Hasolch'i. Ground fire, air strikes and a counterattack by Company A virtually wiped out the force. At the division's left, large groups of PVA approaching the 23rd Infantry at a trot out of the Naech'on River valley about midday on 20 May wavered under mortar and artillery fire and air attacks and turned back before reaching the regiment's line. Put on the run were formations from the 181st Division, whose forces earlier had so stoically endured a heavy air and artillery pounding while passing through the gap in the 38th Infantry's lines near Hill 1051. Rear rank forces of the 12th Army moving up in battalion-size groups meanwhile provided deeper targets for aircraft and artillery as they approached and entered assembly areas in preparation for night attacks. Kept under heavy artillery fire and precise B-29 bomb runs, none of these forces came in on the 2nd Division during the night of 20 May. Now confident that the 2nd Division could occupy and hold the Han'gye-Nuron-ni line, General Almond late on 20 May cancelled his earlier withdrawal order and turned to a greater concern of easing the threat of envelopment from the east either by a shallow swing around the ROK 7th Division forces below P'ungam-ni or by a deeper drive through the 3rd Division sector in the Soksa-ri area. Reducing the deeper threat somewhat was the arrival of the US 65th Infantry Regiment, which allowed General Soule to strengthen his blocks and recapture Soksa-ri on 21 May. ROK 8th Division forces also had reached Chech'on, from where they could be moved up quickly to reinforce X Corps' east flank defenses. In the P'ungam- ni area, reassembled forces of the 5th and 7th Regiments of the ROK 7th Division provided additional protection against a PVA strike out of the Habaejae area, protection which Almond further deepened and widened with the bulk of the still somewhat decrepit 38th Infantry. To relieve the threat in both the P'ungam-ni and Soksa-ri areas, Almond ordered an attack on 22 May to seize and block enemy movement through Habaejae by Task Force Yoke, a group of infantry, tanks and artillery units that he constituted under the command of Col. Lawrence K. Ladue, the deputy Corps' commander. The force of PVA attacks declined all across the X Corps front on 21 May, but grew stronger in the ROK III Corps' sector and at the left of ROK I Corps. ROK 9th Division forces between Soksa-ri and Hajinbu-ri fell below Route 20 under attacks by the PVA 81st Division, while ROK 3rd Division units above Route 20 northeast of Hajinbu-ri began to collapse under KPA V Corps assaults. Near Yuch'on-ni (), east of Hajinbu-ri, the ROK 20th Regiment, 11th Division holding positions facing north and northwest athwart Route 20 to prevent an enemy sweep behind the bulk of the ROK I Corps on Line Waco was hit hard by forces of KPA II Corps. The PVA/KPA pressure continued at all points of attack into the evening. Despite the PVA/KPA action in the Hajinbu-ri-Yuch'on-ni area and continuing reports of reserves moving south, General Van Fleet was convinced, as he reported to General Ridgway, that \\"the enemy's initial punch in the eastern and central eastern section is shot.\\" To keep PVA/KPA forces from slipping out of the bottom of their long bag in the Hajinbu-ri area, Van Fleet late on 21 May directed ROK III Corps to make no further withdrawals and to restore defensive positions north of Route 20. ROK I Corps meanwhile was to fall back from Line Waco to positions that would secure Route 20 between Yuch'on-ni and Kangnung on the coast. Anxious to close the top of the bag, Van Fleet enlarged and substantially altered the concept of the counterattack opened on 20 May. The main effort was now to be directed toward seizing the road centers, with the front otherwise being advanced only as necessary to protect the main effort. I Corps, as under Van Fleet's earlier order, was to seize the road hub in Yongp'yong River valley. His new order shifted the IX Corps-X Corps boundary east as of 23 May to give IX Corps the Hongch'on- Chuncheon-Hwacheon road and the road center on the western side of the Hwacheon Reservoir as its main objective. X Corps was to open a general advance on 23 May to seize the road complex in the Yanggu-Inje area east of the reservoir. Even as Van Fleet ordered ROK III Corps to regain positions above Route 20, the ROK 3rd and 9th Divisions again tumbled back under enemy attacks that by early afternoon of 22 May completely dispersed both divisions and overran their command posts. Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG) advisers notified Van Fleet that the commanders of both divisions and the principal staff members of the ROK 9th Division had disappeared. The ROK 3rd Division commander, Brig. Gen. Kim Jong-oh, at first believed to have been either killed or taken captive, was located along with many members of the division on 23 May some southeast of Hajinbu-ri. Under the direction of the KMAG adviser, troops of the ROK 9th Division meanwhile assembled southwest of Hajinbu-ri. With the commander, Brig. Gen. Choi Suk, still unlocated, General Yu placed the deputy Corps' commander in charge. Convinced by the continuing failure of the Corps that Yu and his staff could not conduct operations successfully, General Van Fleet late on 22 May ordered the ROK III Corps headquarters inactivated, the ROK 3rd Division transferred to ROK I Corps, the ROK 9th Division given to X Corps and X Corps made responsible for the former ROK III Corps sector. He also ordered the ROK forward headquarters off the front and placed ROK I Corps under his own direct command. In the Yuch'on-ni area, KPA II Corps forces early on 22 May cut Route 20, turned their attack east, and dispersed the ROK 20th Regiment, 11th Division. Given the strong PVA/KPA effort in the Hajinburi-Yuch'on-ni region over the past two days, the approach of reserves, and no evidence that enemy forces were having serious logistical problems, the Eighth Army intelligence officer, in contrast to General Van Fleet's sensing that the enemy offensive had lost its momentum, predicted a continuation in force along and below Route 20. The location and course of enemy forces below Hajinbu-ri convinced Colonel Tarkenton that they would attempt a deep southwestward push toward P'yongch'ang and Yongwol along Route 20 as a preliminary to the seizure of the Chech'on road and rail hub; the eastward enemy drive appeared to be aimed at enveloping Kangnung. General Van Fleet countered the threat to Kangnung with new orders to ROK I Corps, then still withdrawing from Line Waco to positions above Route 20 between Yuch'on-ni and the coast under his orders of the 21st. I Corps' commander General Paik Sun-yup was to organize strong positions facing west astride Route 20 to block any eastward enemy drive along the road, but if he could not hold a continuous line above Route 20 with his west flank refused, he was to set his forces in perimeter around the Kangnung road center. But as Van Fleet dispatched these orders near midnight on 22 May, the composite of recent and current reports from the front confirmed a general PVA/KPA withdrawal. Now three days into their advance, I Corps and IX Corps had found contact progressively more difficult. The first indications of PVA/KPA withdrawal on the X Corps' front had appeared late on 21 May. Evidently withdrawal orders had taken longer to reach the deeper PVA/KPA forces in the Hajinburi-Yuch'on- ni area, forces who began moving back after dark on 22 May. Aftermath Crippling losses, particularly in the PVA 12th and 15th Armies, had forced Peng Dehuai to abandon his offensive. The inability of these weakening armies to mount effective attacks against the adjusted X Corps positions after 19 May had endangered the PVA/KPA forces farther east since the failure to advance astride Route 24 meant that the PVA/KPA moving to and below Route 20 in the Hajinbu-ri-Yuch'on-ni sector were simply taking themselves farther and farther out on a limb. Though fresh reserves were available, the casualties among the assault echelons had been exceptionally heavy, largely as a result of the Van Fleet rate of artillery fire and round the-clock air attacks, and Peng apparently decided against subjecting his reserves to the same punishment and extreme losses. Peng called for a rapid, almost precipitate, withdrawal, with covering forces fighting only light delaying actions except where strong blocks were needed to keep withdrawal routes open. The previous general disposition of forces was to be restored, the Hwacheon Reservoir again marking the division between PVA and KPA sectors and also marking generally the northern limit of the withdrawal. For the PVA armies south and southeast of the reservoir, plans for getting past the lake were designed to avoid a jam-up of troops when they reached that obstacle. The 20th and 27th Armies of the IX Army Group were to withdraw around the east end of the reservoir, then move along its northern bank to the west end. Leading the way, the 20th Army was to set up a blocking position between Hwacheon town and the reservoir. The 27th Army, on coming out of the Hajinbu-ri area with its rear covered by KPA II and V Corps, was to concentrate behind the 20th. The KPA rearguards were to set up defenses east of the reservoir, V Corps between the reservoir and the near outskirts of Inje, II Corps from Inje eastward. PVA III Army Group, with the 12th Army returned to its control, was to withdraw around the west end of the reservoir. From below Chuncheon, the PVA 60th Army, less its 81st Division still with the 12th Army, was to fight a delaying action along Route 17 to hold the road open for the 15th and 12th Armies as they withdrew northwest, passed through the ground below the reservoir, and moved through Hwacheon town into the Iron Triangle. The rearguard 60th Army, on passing behind the 20th Army at Hwacheon, was to follow. West of the Bukhan River, the three armies of the XIX Army Group were to withdraw generally northwestward, pulling away from the I Corps and the IX Corps toward areas located on either side of the upper reaches of the Imjin River and in the Iron Triangle. Northwest of Seoul, KPA I Corps was initially to withdraw behind the lower Imjin and was eventually to move west beyond the Ryesong River for rest and rebuilding. On 20 May the UN began their general counteroffensive which by mid-June had erased all PVA/KPA gains in the Spring Offensive.

Life  After secondary school, he was an electrician's apprentice and wanted to catch up in Dortmund with his high school diploma. He was described as \\"an unobtrusive student\\" by one teacher. Franz finished school half a year before graduation.Five-time murderer and escapee - police are looking for one of the most ruthless criminals in Germany, stern.de  Crimes  Norman Volker Franz belonged to a gang of criminals who attacked banks, smuggled cigarettes, traded weapons and maintained contacts with pimps. When gang boss Christian K. was blackmailed by three rival Polish cigarette smugglers, he ordered Franz and three other men to kill the Poles. In May 1995, K. lured the three extortionists on a deserted street near the Syburg district of Dortmund. Franz stopped the Poles' car and asked them to turn down the window, because he had to discuss something briefly. Then he threw a hand grenade into the vehicle. One of the men was killed instantly, and another was seriously injured but attempted to escape, but was caught by Franz and his accomplices and shot several times in the head. The third man escaped, although they followed him in Franz's BMW, from whose windows they shot him with a pump action, seriously injuring him. . After this, Franz tried to flee with his girlfriend Sandra from the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain and then to Portugal, but was arrested at a toll in France and transferred to Germany. The Dortmund jury sentenced him in March 1996 for two murders to life imprisonment and was transferred to the Hagen Prison. In May 1996, he married his girlfriend in prison. On March 11, 1997, he sawed through the window bars of his cell, climbed onto the roof with a ladder made of bucket handles and broomsticks, and slid down the gutter. He jumped into a red Volkswagen Polo, where his wife had been waiting for him, and fled. On March 26, 1997, Franz shot the security guard Rudolf Tamm, who had brought a cash box with 10,000 Deutsche Mark to a safe in the Dresdner Bank in Weimar. He grabbed the cash box and fled on foot with his wife, who had stood guard in front of the bank. On July 21, 1997, Franz shot and killed two guards, Gerd Koch and Peter Seidel, who were about to stow the weekend income in the amount of half a million Deutsche Mark in an armoured car behind the Metromarkt in Pei√üen near Halle.  Arrest  On October 24, 1998, Franz and his wife were arrested in a Portuguese apartment in Albufeira by German investigators. Portuguese policemen in Algarve were aware of a BMW with a German license plate, which was suspiciously parked in front of a bank. The police checked the license plate and found out that the car had been purchased under a pseudonym and that the wanted murderer Norman Volker Franz had used it more often. The two fugitives made no resistance and came into Portuguese custody peacefully.  Renewed flight  After Franz had filed an unsuccessful complaint against his extradition to the German authorities before the Portuguese Constitutional Court, on July 28, 1999 he escaped successfully from the central prison of Lisbon. He had cut through the window grill and roped off with sheets. Since his escape, the authorities have been looking in vain for the perpetrator. His wife, who was sentenced to a six-year and three-year juvenile fine in Portuguese custody by the Halle court, has since divorced him. For the arrest of Norman Volker Franz, there are currently rewards totaling around ‚Ç¨100,000 from several institutions and authorities.Tim Farin: Killing without pity in: stern.de May 23, 2018 According to the BKA, Franz is thought to be staying abroad, as there have been sightings of him.

June 2, 1600 in Gr√∂ningen), called the \\"Thousand Devil of Halberstadt,\\" was a German robber and serial killer. He was executed for multiple crimes in an area now known as Saxony-Anhalt.  Capture  In the spring of 1600, a man who was believed to be the \\"Thousand Devils of Halberstadt.\\" was arrested. He was brought to Gr√∂ningen, the location of the Diocese of Halberstadt at the time, and which was the residence of Duke Henry Julius of Brunswick. There, the suspect was imprisoned and interrogated, sometimes under torture.  Confessions  In the course of the interrogations, the man stated that his civil name was Simon Bingelhelm, and that he was born in Halberstadt. He confessed to numerous burglaries and theft offenses, primarily in Halberstadt, but also in Wernigerode, Reddeber, Falkenstein, Hoym, Aschersleben, Seehausen, Ballenstedt, Eilenstedt, Heimburg, Klein Quenstedt, Westerhausen, Dardesheim, Prenzlau, Salzwedel, Haldensleben, Neuhaldensleben, Calv√∂rde, Derenburg, Herzberg, Oschersleben, Schermcke, Krottorf and Quedlinburg. He allegedly said that he was the arsonist behind the fire at Dr√ºbeck Abbey monastery in 1599, and that he watched the fire from a neighboring mountain. He had a chalice from Rade church and had stolen eleven talers from the poverty box of St. George's Church in Derenburg. He broke into the Martinique Church with others, and stole the poor box. In Helmstedt, he stabbed a man for two groschen and a pawn near Bernburg. At Benzingerode he killed a young woman, eight days before the Pentecost in 1599. In the forest between Hornburg and Osterwieck, he tried to rape an 18-year-old girl and later killed her. In the interrogations, the man confessed to a total of 71 crimes, including involvement in 26 murders. Among other things, he is said to have attacked a pregnant woman, whom he killed with his cronies. They supposedly slashed her body to remove her unborn child, from whose entrails he then made candles for his next burglary. He was involved in the robbery and killing of at least five infants. During the interrogation, this was noted:  Execution  On his execution on June 2, 1600 in Gr√∂ningen, he was: \\"attacked with pincers for honor, dragged to the town court, then quartered.\\"  References  Category:1500s births Category:1600 deaths Category:16th- century executions Category:People executed by the Holy Roman Empire Category:German serial killers ","title":"Simon Bingelhelm"},{"id":"58035776","title":"Fall Open Tournament Far and Near LTC"},{"id":"58035777","text":"Ashina Duzhi (r. 676-676) ‚Äî was a claimant to throne of Western Turkic Khaganate.

He was likely born in Antwerp around the year 1600. The original name of the artist has not been preserved. He adopted a French form of his Flemish name after he moved to France. There is no record of his registration with the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke.Ph.

He was an active member of the community of painters of Flemish origin who had settled in Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s. He was active as a flower painter and enjoyed the patronage of Gaston Henri de Bourbon, the nominal bishop of Metz and later Duke of Verneuil.Jean-Michel Picart, Bouquet of flowers with poppies, roses, tulips, narcissi, cyclamen, and hydrangeas in a lapis vase with butterflies on a stone ledge at Sotheby's By 1638, Picart had become one of the most prominent figures among the community of still life painters from Flanders and Holland who had settled in Paris.Jean-Michel Picart, Still Life of Flowers and Fruit at the Portland Art Museum In 1640, Picart was admitted to the Acad√©mie de Saint-Luc (Academy of Saint Luke), the guild of painters and sculptors of Paris. Still life of flowers and fruit The French chronicler Andr√© F√©libien described Picart in his 1666-8 treatise Entretiens sur les vies et sur les ouvrages des plus excellents peintres anciens et modernes as one of the important artists of his time who ran a workshop of painter copyists hailing mostly from Flanders or the Dutch Republic.Jean-Michel Picart, Still life of a basket of flowers and a mound of fruit on a sculpted stone table, partly covered at Sotheby's Picart was renowned for his activity as a merchant of original works and copies. He dealt in Dutch and Flemish landscapes, hunting scenes by Frans Snyders and small religious compositions. As an art dealer he was also sought out for his specialist expertise. For instance, on the occasion of the death of Henrietta of England he was called upon as an expert to assess her art collection. As an art dealer he remained in contact with Antwerp art dealers such as Matthijs Musson.Debra Cashion, Henry Luttikhuizen, Ashley West, The Primacy of the Image in Northern European Art, 1400-1700: Essays in Honor of Larry Silver, BRILL, 2017, p. 488 Correspondence between the two art dealers shows that Picart would inform Musson of prevailing preferences in the Paris art market and Musson would then organise for the making of the pictures that fit with those preferences. Carnations and other flowers in a bronze vase Jean-Michel Picart married and became widowed three times. His first wife was Marie Marguillier with whom he had a son in 1636. He married a second time on 15 November 1640 to Jeanne Cholin, who was buried on 15 June 1644. A daughter was born from this union.Family details on geneanet His last marriage with Marie Richard contracted in 1645 lasted for 35 years and produced four daughters and two sons.Peter Mitchell, Great flower painters: four centuries of floral art, Overlook Press, 17 September 1973, pp. 201-202 The documents regarding his civil status on the occasion of his marriages or those of his relatives give an insight into the life of the artist. Starting from his second marriage, he built strong relationships with the local stonecutters, jewellers and engravers of fine stones. He was the father-in-law of the portraitist Jacques d'Agar, who had studied with the Flemish painter Jacob Ferdinand Voet and later became portrait painter to the court of Denmark.Jean-Michel Picart, Fleurs dans une urne sculpt√©e at the Mus√©e d'art moderne et contemporain de Saint-√âtienne M√©tropole Another daughter married the miniature painter Sylvain Bonnet in 1672.Michel Far√©, Le grand si√®cle de la nature morte en France: le 17e si√®cle, Office du livre, 1974, p. 94 The Flemish painter Philippe de Champaigne and the French flower painter Nicolas Baudesson as well as magistrates and officers appear in various notarial deeds relating to Picart. This confirms the social rise of the artist. In 1651, Picart became a member of the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture. Later he was named by king Louis XIV 'Peintre du Roy' (Painter to the King) in 1671, then 'peintre ordinaire du roi' (ordinary painter to the king) from 1679 to 1682.Jean-Michel Picart, Fleurs dans une carafe at Mus√©e d'art moderne et contemporain de Saint-√âtienne M√©tropole Picart painted still lifes for the king of which at least seven were on display at the Palace of Versailles and another eight at the king's smaller retreat Ch√¢teau de Marly. The artist was active in Paris until his death on 24 November 1682. Work Bouquet of flowers in a vase decorated with gilt bronze Only a few of Picart's works are dated. A Bouquet of flowers in a vase decorated with gilt bronze (1648, Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon) is a rare signed and dated work.Jean-Michel Picart, Bouquet of flowers in a vase decorated with gilt bronze, Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon According to Curt Benedict, it was the Still life of flowers in a glass vase of the Mus√©e d'art moderne et contemporain de Saint-√âtienne M√©tropole, which allowed the French art historian Michel Far√© to attribute a number of works to Picart. Picart's style stayed generally close to the contemporary style of flower painting practised in Antwerp, especially that of Jan van Kessel the Elder.Christopher Wright, The French painters of the seventeenth century, Orbis, 1985, p. 241 His early work such as the Fruit still life with grapes and peaches (c. 1635, Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe) follows an archaic type.Charles Sterling, Still life painting: from antiquity to the twentieth century, Harper & Row, 1981, p. 106 Later he was able to merge his Flemish realism with its painstaking attention to detail with the demand at the court of Louis XIV for more extravagant, lush floral arrangements.Jean-Michel Picart, Still life with spring flowers on a ledge at Dorotheum The artist was particularly skilled in creating subtly different harmonics, a feature that would mark French still-life painting. Picart liked to use dramatic lighting to bring his flower pieces to life.Jean-Michel Picart, Carnations and other flowers in a bronze vase at Christie's His ability to render every detail meticulously can be seen in the Still life with spring flowers on a ledge (early 1650s, at Dorotheum Vienna on 25 April 2017, lot 93) in which he carefully depicts the defects on the fruit peel as well as the withering leaves and the rich cloth covering the table and the curtains in the background. Some art historians have interpreted some of the images in these flower pieces (such as withering flowers, butterflies) as symbols for the transience of life.

He received his nickname because he committed his robberies and murders mostly at noon. He was released in 2015 after 50 years in prison, being up until that point Bavaria's longest-serving prisoner.After 50 years: Nuremberg \\"Midday Murderer\\" is released, N√ºrnberger Nachrichten online, February 17,  Life  Gossmann was born in 1940, the son of an officer who was killed by American troops in February 1945. He grew up with his brother until 1945 in Meseritz in eastern Brandenburg and from 1949 in Hersbruck. After five years in elementary school, Gossmann moved to the Obberrealschule Hersbruck in 1951. There he had to repeat a class and failed his matriculation exam. He moved to a secondary school in Ingolstadt and graduated there in July 1962. In fall of the same year he began studying economics at the Technische Hochschule N√ºrnberg, but he discontinued his education. In the summer of 1964 he volunteered as a candidate officer and moved in October. After training with various pioneer units in Koblenz and Munich, he repeatedly sought his dismissal. When this failed, he deserted in April 1965 and henceforth lived under false names in and around Nuremberg.  Crimes  Gossmann shot two women and five men during his robberies in Nuremberg between 1960 and 1965. Striking was the fact that the perpetrator made use of the firearm immediately and his actions always occurred at noon. The first murder occurred on April 22, 1960 in the Tuchergartenstra√üe in Nuremberg, when Gossmann raided an elderly woman's apartment. When she called for help, a subtenant and her fianc√© hurried to her, who were then both shot dead by the burglar. Gossmann fled without loot and left the householder alive. She alarmed the police, and the woman gave them a good description of the perpetrator. Despite an alarm of all Nuremberg police stations and the surrounding areas, the fugitive could not be caught. The officials followed up hundreds of clues from the population and sighted with the householder about 2000 photos from the criminal files. In addition, fingerprints were compared, connections to similar robberies sought and dozens of comparisons carried out. Finally, a FN Herstal caliber 7.65mm was identified as the murder weapon. After about a year without success, the investigators launched one of the largest manhunt operations in the history of the Federal Republic. All men born in 1939 or 1940, who had lived in Nuremberg at the time of the crime, were examined, a total of 50,336 people. The officers also questioned 1,174 men from the dating agency where the surviving homeowner worked. On September 10, 1962, the next murder took place. Gossmann shot the store manager of the Sparkasse in Ochenbruck and escaped with over 3,000 Deutsche Mark in loot, this time using a Walther PPK pistol. Witnesses could follow his escape route to the station. As early as November 30, Gossmann attacked the Sparkasse branch office in Neuhaus an der Pegnitz and shot dead a retiree, who did not seem aware of the robbery and had reached into his breast pocket to get a pair of glasses. As a weapon this time a Walther P38 was used. While the officials were still busy with the investigation of previous crimes, the owner of a gun shop and his mother were shot on March 29, 1963. The projectiles, pods and individual firing features identified the same Walther pistols as used in the deadly shootings in Ochenbruck and Neuhaus. The male murder victim was under investigation for possible illegal arms deals. On June 1, 1965, Gossmann committed his last crime in a Nuremberg department store. After trying to steal a customer's purse, several passers-by pursued him. Policemen arrested Gossmann after a shoot-out in which he killed one man and severely injured two others.  Trial and imprisonment  At the time of his arrest, Gossmann had three pistols, a blackjack and firecrackers with him. He initially denied the crimes, but one of his pistols and two others, which were in a tenanted apartment in Nuremberg, could be identified as murder weapons. These had been looted during thefts in 1959, 1960 and 1962. When confronted, a witness of the Ochenbruck raid recognized him. Confronted with this evidence, he confessed, revealing his indifference to the victims. Among other things, he said this to authorities: \\"He came rushing at me like a savage (...) Since I absolutely wanted to ward off his attack, I therefore fired a third time on the man\\" (first murder in Nuremberg), \\"When I came to the bank and pulled the pistol out, then all they had to do was pick up their cash. If they did not do that, it was their own fault if I had to shoot them.\\" (for the bank robberies) \\"I was afraid that I would be captured, and yet had to shoot in self-defense\\". (last murder in Nuremberg) The secret of the Midday crimes was also solved - Gossmann was not an early riser and needed the morning for his preparations. On July 27, 1967, Gossmann was sentenced to life imprisonment for fivefold murder and three particularly serious cases of robbery. The first double murder was not negotiated because he had committed it before his 21st birthday.Lifelong penitentiary for the \\"Midday murderer\\" in Schw√§bische Zeitung of July 28, At the beginning of 2010, the district court of Regensburg ordered to release Gossmann on a long-term parole. However, this decision was overturned by the Higher Regional Court of Nuremberg, as there was still danger that Gossmann would commit serious crimes. The Verfassungsbeschwerde against this was successful in 2012. After the Federal Constitutional Court's decision, he was now prepared for life outside of prison and on February 26, 2015, Gossmann was released from the Straubing Prison on probation after spending 50 years in prison.

A crime scene photo with a bloodstained park bench visualised the brutality of the act. This meant that three homeless people had been murdered within 24 hours. The police tried with surveillance technology (including stealth cameras in bird houses) to catch the culprit red-handed. However, the diffused parking lights and the inadequate camera technology were not enough to attract investigation-relevant images. Even a survey of dry- cleaning companies on whether blood-stained clothing has been delivered, provided no results. In the homeless scene, the fear was reversed and the city put up additional shelters and left the subway stops open overnight, so that as few people as possible had to sleep on park benches. * May 20, 1990: Brazilian native Anderson S. followed a man into a bush, supposedly to have sex with him.

A local resident had witnessed the accident and alerted the police. Only 12 minutes after the murder, a suspect was arrested.  Modus operandi  On May 22, 1990, Arthur Gatter was arrested in connection to the hammer murders. As the supposed murder weapon a metalwork hammer was secured, which he carried hidden in a plastic bag in the armpit. Through this instrument, the typical impression fractures or perforated structures in the skull came about, as determined in forensic medicine. He systematically searched for victims on park benches and surprised them in their sleep. He watched them for a while, until he was sure he could do his job safely. For sneaking purposes he wore low-noise rubber gloves. He hit with so much force that the blood splashed meter-wide.  Life  Arthur Gatter was a professional electrician by profession who lived in Australia for a while. After returning to Germany, he worked on assembly and traveled to countries in the Orient. Since the 1980s, he was no longer able to work and trashed his apartment in Wilhelm-Leuschner-Stra√üe. It is believed that his schizophrenia was already greatly advanced at this time. Even in his next residence in Bornheim, he behaved suspiciously. Partly he had to be examined in a clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy in Haina.Elisabeth L√ºcke: Frankfurt's Dark Side: Spectacular Criminal Cases, Sutton Verlag, 2014, p. 79, . A psychiatric report which was made at the time attested him an insanity defense.Elisabeth L√ºcke: Frankfurt's Dark Side: Spectacular Criminal Cases, Sutton Verlag, 2014, p. 80, . Before he could be taken to court, on December 12, 1990, Gatter hanged himself with a gauze bandage.  Psychogram of the offender  Arthur Gatter grew up as a loner and already suffered in the early stages of anxiety and mental health problems, which expanded into a paranoid schizophrenia. By the late 1980s, a bizarre world of madness took over his thinking and acting. He told the police that a dark force had taken his victims to the park to be killed by him. Since 1987, he is said to have heard voices that dominated his life from then on. During the crime scene, Gatter made gurgling noises and mannerisms that are typical of certain mental illnesses. He said to have felt no remorse for his crimes or his victims.

Global Wildlife Conservation, the wildlife conservation charity, lists the Wondiwoi Tree Kangaroo as one of their \\"25 Most Wanted Lost Species\\". Taxonomy It was named in honour of Ernst Mayr, who collected the type specimen now deposited in the Natural History Museum, London. It was described by Lord Rothschild and Capt. Guy Dollman in a 1933 paper and an illustration based on the only known specimen was published in their 1936 monograph on the genus. Discovery In July 2018, what may prove to be the first ever photographs of the species were taken by British naturalist Michael Smith. Smith was investigating Vireya rhododendrons in an unexplored area of the Wondiwoi ranges and photographed a 'dorianus type' tree kangaroo at an altitude of approximately 1,600 metres. Scent marks, tree kangaroo scat and claw marks at the base of trees made by climbing tree kangaroos were found from 1,700m to 2,000m in steep montane forest. Local hunters, who frequently kill Grizzled tree kangaroos in lowland forest, rarely if ever visit the forest above 1,500m because of the difficult terrain, lack of water sources and dense bamboo thickets. Status Long thought to be extinct or critically endangered, the IUCN Red List listed the species as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) because \\"if the species still exists the population must be very small (less than 50 mature individuals) and probably in decline due to hunting pressures. Although the area has not been well-sampled, there have been a few visits to the area with no reports of this species.\\" In 2018, a British amateur botanist photographed what is believed to be a living specimen of the Wondiwoi tree-kangaroo in the mountains of New Guinea. The species status of Dendrolagus mayri is uncertain. Some authorities refer to all 'dorianus type' tree kangaroos as subspecies of Doria's tree kangaroo, including Colin Groves, who published a major revision of the taxonomy of the genus in 1982. More recent DNA analysis indicates, however, that the members of the dorianus group deserve species status, although Dendrolagus mayri itself was not included in the study.

Bioinformatic approaches can be divided into three main categories. The first involves homology search, although these techniques are by definition unable to find new classes of ncRNAs. The second category includes algorithms designed to discover specific types of ncRNAs that have similar properties. Finally, some discovery methods are based on very general properties of RNA, and are thus able to discover entirely new kinds of ncRNAs. Discovery by homology search Homology search refers to the process of searching a sequence database for RNAs that are similar to already known RNA sequences. Any algorithm that is designed for homology search of nucleic acid sequences can be used, e.g., BLAST. However, such algorithms typically are not as sensitive or accurate as algorithms specifically designed for RNA. Of particular importance for RNA is its conservation of a secondary structure, which can be modeled to achieve additional accuracy in searches. For example, Covariance models can be viewed as an extension to a profile hidden Markov model that also reflects conserved secondary structure. Covariance models are implemented in the Infernal software package. Discovery of specific types of ncRNAs Some types of RNAs have shared properties that algorithms can exploit. For example, tRNAscan-SE is specialized to finding tRNAs. The heart of this program is a tRNA homology search based on covariance models, but other tRNA-specific search programs are used to accelerate searches. The properties of snoRNAs have enabled the development of programs to detect new examples of snoRNAs, including those that might be only distantly related to previously known examples. Computer programs implementing such approaches include snoscan and snoReport. Similarly, several algorithms have been developed to detect microRNAs. Examples include miRNAFold and miRNAminer Discovery by general properties Some properties are shared by multiple unrelated classes of ncRNA, and these properties can be targeted to discover new classes. Chief among them is the conservation of an RNA secondary structure. To measure conservation of secondary structure, it is necessary to somehow find homologous sequences that might exhibit a common structure. Strategies to do this have included the use of BLAST between two sequences or multiple sequences, exploited synteny via orthologous genes or used locality sensitive hashing in combination with sequence and structural features. Mutations that change the nucleotide sequence, but preserve secondary structure are called covariation, and can provide evidence of conservation. Other statistics and probabilistic models can be used to measure such conservation. The first ncRNA discovery method to use structural conservation was QRNA, which compared the probabilities of an alignment of two sequences based on either an RNA model or a model in which only the primary sequence conserved. Work in this direction has allowed for more than two sequences and included phylogenetic models, e.g., with EvoFold. An approach taken in RNAz involved computing statistics on an input multiple-sequence alignment. Some of these statistics relate to structural conservation, while others measure general properties of the alignment that could affect the expected ranges of the structural statistics. These statistics were combined using a support vector machine. Other properties include the appearance of a promoter to transcribe the RNA. ncRNAs are also often followed by a Rho-independent transcription terminator. Using a combination of these approaches, multiple studies have enumerated candidate RNAs, e.g., Some studies have proceeded to manual analysis of the predictions to find a details structural and functional prediction.

He was sentenced to death on January 19, 1914 for murdering his wives, father and daughter, as well as attempting to murder other people from the Frankfurt jury.  Life  Karl Hopf attended the Musterschule and left after the Untersekunda. He began work as a pharmacist in London, and lived temporarily in Casablanca and India. There he trained in fencing, which he mastered to perfection. At the turn of the century, he ran a kennel in Niederh√∂chstadt, today part of Eschborn. For one of his dogs, he scored a high amount of 10,000 gold marks for sale at one time.Gerhard Raiss: Karl Hopf, a Mass murderer from Niederh√∂chstadt, MTK-Jahrbuch 1994  Murders  In 1902 he married his first wife, Josefa Henel, from Niederh√∂chstadt. She died the same year on November 28 after a short illness. From her life insurance he received 20,000 gold marks. He then married Auguste Christine, n√©e Schneider, who also began suffering from health problems. She divorced Hopf, left him and died soon afterwards. However, Hopf was unable to collect the insurance of 30,000 gold marks on her. His daughter, Elsa, died in 1906. In the following years Hopf appeared in variety shows under the pseudonym \\"Athos\\" as a champion in fencing.1913, poisoner Karl Hopf, arsenic in champagne, FAZ from June 24, 2017 In 1912 he married Dresden native Wally Siewec in London. They insured themselves with 80,000 gold marks \\"on mutuality\\". His third wife soon became ill with severe gastrointestinal disease. She was treated at the Deaconess Hospital in Frankfurt, where she began to feel better. The toxicology specialist, Dr. Rossmann, recognized symptoms of severe poisoning and consulted forensic physician Georg Popp.The scientist in the jury  Investigations  As a result, a search of Hopf's home revealed large amounts of various highly concentrated poisons, including arsenic, digitalis and live cultures of typhoid and cholera bacilli. He was arrested on April 14, 1913. Hopf had brought a bottle of cyanide with him, but police seized it from him.  Trial  The trial in front of the jury in Frankfurt and lasted from January 9 to 19, 1914, and was very well received by the public. More than 64 witnesses and experts were invited and heard. At the trial it came to light that Hopf had murdered his father, first wife, illegitimate child and his daughter Elsa from his second marriage with poison. He secretly, partially over long periods of time, poisoned all the murdered, mostly hidden in foods and drinks. In an exhumation of the bodies of all his deceased relatives, Popp succeeded for the first time in criminal history to scientifically lead the poison detection in the bones and body parts.  Execution  After he was sentenced to death, Karl Hopf was guillotined on March 23, 1914 in the courtyard of the Royal Prison Preugesheim.Hess. Main State Archives, Dept. 407 / Access 68 from 1991.

It is also the location of the World War II installation the Illowra Battery. The property is owned by Wollongong City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 14 December 2001.  Description  Hill 60 Park is dominated by the rocky headland of Boilers Point and the sheltered embayment of Fisherman's Beach. Hill 60 rises steeply above Fisherman's Beach to a peak of 71 m a.s.l. at which point is situated the Illowra Trig Station. The elevated areas of the park are largely cleared and grassed and contain a public recreational Lookout, car park, access road, walking track, a hang-gliding launch pad and a Coast Guard radar operations unit. There are a number of defence installations, including gun batteries, tunnels, engine houses, search and spotlight positions, communications cabling, defence personal housing and amenities, and local defence earthworks, a transformer site, security post and tunnel installations, on the upper elevations of the Hill and along its side slopes. The peak of Hill 60, in the vicinity of the Illowra Trig Station was subject to considerable landscaping including infilling with coal wash which effectively increased the ground level in that area by several feet. While many of the installations were decommissioned after the war and sold off by the Commonwealth, a number are still in place in the study area to this day. An established walking track is cut into and traverses the upper elevations of the Hill below the Lookout between the Red Point sewerage treatment site access road and a viewing area on the north facing side of the Hill. The walking track is narrow but well formed with a series of post and rail handrails and wood and metal stake steps. Erosion control measures on the side slope of the Hill above and below the track has included re-vegetation and slope stabilisation. A stepped gravel path links the car park with this viewing area along the western slope of the Hill. An informal walking track traverses the west facing side slopes of the Hill between the lower viewing area and the Playing Fields of the Senior College eventually linking to the Boiler Point car park and walking track. There are a small number of wooden and metal stake retaining steps in the steeper upper portion of the track. The lower portions of the track are totally informal and numerous side tracks criss-cross the vegetated lower slopes. Some of these tracks lead directly to the Fisherman's Beach Access Road and some cross the slope above the playing fields. The dunes above Fisherman's Beach which form the east facing side slope of Hill 60 are very steep and partially de-vegetated as a result of erosion accelerated by recreational use. Natural vegetation includes some established Banksia and coastal heath but the slopes are heavily infested with bitou bush and lantana. Access to the beach is over these slopes is possible only with difficulty. The sand dunes at the toe of slope at the west end of Hill 60 are support a variety of native and exotic vegetation. There are a number of blowouts in this area which contain extensive evidence of prehistoric Aboriginal occupation. The Aboriginal shell midden and artefact scatters have, in the past, been exposed by erosion and de-vegetation and covered over by aeolian sand. It is most likely they were continuous over these lower sand dunes to the end of Boilers Point but have been bisected by the construction of the Fisherman's Beach access road. Aboriginal sites previously recorded within and adjacent to the study area comprise the following: * A burial discovered eroding out of midden material at Port Kembla High School: An unregistered burial at the Australian Fertilisers Ltd site to the west of North Beach * A midden containing a wide range of shell species and stone artefacts inclusive of cores and secondarily worked flakes located on the lower slopes of Hill 60 at Boilers Point * A midden site on a small hill in the Red Point sewerage treatment site * A midden with stone artefact scatters eroding out of sand dunes over large exposed areas at the northern end of North Beach. = Condition = As at 30 January 2013, Boilers Point has been extensively impacted upon by activities associated with the military, including the installation of an Electric Beach Searchlight, an engine room and WWII defensive trenches. Numerous 4WD roads and walking tracks criss-cross the Point. Use of these features has to some extent been limited by the installation of access blocks and a formed formal walking track. Aboriginal midden deposits that were exposed in these features are now being covered over by regenerating grass and heath or have been partially covered by the formal walking track. A watercourse which may have contained a natural spring on the north western side of Boilers Point is now largely re-shaped by the formation of a wetland area and \\"frog hollow\\". This landscaping has disturbed Aboriginal shell deposits adjacent to this feature. A small sandy beach between MM Beach and Boilers Point contains Aboriginal shell deposits at the interface of the beach and the toe of slope below the watercourse and \\"frog hollow\\". Other Aboriginal shell deposits are located at the interface of the upper elevations of the rock walls around Boilers Point and the soil deposits on the Point itself. Some of these have been exposed by the military installations on the Point and some by the creation and use of access tracks to these features. MM Beach has been truncated along its western dunes by the formation of Gloucester Boulevard. The Boulevard is formed and guttered along most of its length. The formed portion to its intersection with Darcy Road also contains a pavement, bus lay-by, car park and cycle track. A short length at the northern end of the road is tarred but contains no kerbs or gutterings. A number of informal sidetracks and turning circles have been formed along the eastern side of the road over the sand dunes. There are a number of 4WD roads and numerous walking tracks between the boulevard and the beach at the northern end of the beach. The southern end of the beach, from the carpark to the end of the beach, is flanked by steep rocky slopes and rocky bluffs which topographically prohibits access to the beach. There are, or were, a number of military installations located at the northern end of the beach, including a machine gun post , the main command building, a coarse aggregate concrete service trench and gun emplacements. There has been considerable ground disruption associated with these installations and access to them. The middle and southern portions of MM Beach contain a WWII semi-circular brick gun emplacement, stormwater drains, the remains of a possible early jetty and coarse aggregate and swimming baths on a rock platform. Extensive deposits Aboriginal shell midden are located in the dune formations of MM Beach between the rocky headland of the military land and middle portion of the beach. Here the sand dunes have either been massively disturbed by stormwater drain construction or are truncated by rising rocky bluffs and the construction of Gloucester Boulevard.  Heritage listing  Hill 60 and its environs (MM Beach, Boilers Point, Fisherman's Beach and Hill 60 Park) contains a rare suite of Aboriginal sites which demonstrate the evolving pattern of Aboriginal cultural history and the Aboriginal land rights struggle. The quality, extent and diversity of the prehistoric archaeological remains at this place are rare on the NSW coast particularly in the local region. These include extensive shell midden deposits rich in stone artifacts and burials. There is demonstrated cultural affiliation with the place by the Aboriginal community, through near continuous occupation of the place, a history of struggle to gain land tenure and ongoing association and use of the place. The historic Aboriginal occupation was characterised by a relatively isolated and self sufficient Aboriginal community that participated in the economic maintenance of the wider community by the provision of labour to local industry and produce (seafood's) at a commercial level. The people also maintained a culturally distinct Aboriginal lifestyle firmly based on the maintenance of family connections over the wider region and traditional economic practices.Dallas, 2000 Hill 60 was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 14 December 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Wadi Wadi Aboriginal community of the south coast region, which includes people who were born and lived in the study area prior to forced removal , have consistently and persistently asserted their cultural affiliation to the place. A highly successful Aboriginal fishing enterprise was established at the Hill in the late 1800s supplying the local and Sydney market. The Hill was used as a fish-spotting lookout providing direction for the boats and netting operation below at Fisherman's Beach. This practice continued a traditional fishing method common along the south coast to the present. The area of Hill 60 and MM Beach was an area on the southern coast of NSW that saw the prolonged struggle of the Aboriginal community to remain on traditional lands. The struggle was characterised by: 1\\\\. A relatively isolated and economically self-supporting Aboriginal community that maintained good neighbor relations and participated in the wider community. This was achieved by the provision of labour (in local steelworks and other industry) and produce (supply of prawns, fish and shellfish on a commercial basis), and maintained a culturally distinct Aboriginal lifestyle firmly based on the maintenance of family connections over the wider region and traditional economic practices. 2\\\\. A government bureaucracy at the local level and a white community which had experienced similarly severe deprivations as a result of economic depression in a predominantly working class community which was to some extent sympathetic and alternatively jealous of the Aboriginal communities which had remained relatively successful in \\"white terms\\". 3\\\\. An Aboriginal community that remained resolute in their attachment to important traditional lands in spite of efforts to transplant people to local Aboriginal Reserves. Aboriginal sites within the area demonstrate the evolving pattern of Aboriginal cultural history and their land rights struggle. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. This place exhibits the qualities of an exceptional traditional Aboriginal-fishing environment that required organisation and co-operative endeavours to secure success. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. This place is important to the Aboriginal community for social, cultural and spiritual reasons. The Wadi Wadi Aboriginal community of the south coast region, which includes people who were born and lived in the stud area prior to forced removal, have consistently and persistently asserted their cultural affiliation to the place. The place has evidence of prehistoric occupation in the form of significant and extensive shell middens and camp sites. The place was home to a group of Aboriginal families who continued traditional fishing practices, maintained their cultural attachment to the place by community, built and maintained their houses and maintained connections with family elsewhere on the coast. The site has particular importance in representing a focal point of the Aboriginal communities' ongoing efforts to secure recognition of tenure. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of NSW's Aboriginal cultural history, occupation patterns, stone tool technology and burial practice. The archaeological research potential and educational value of the Aboriginal occupation sites (shell middens and artefact deposits) is extremely high. The middens are extensive and retain stratified in situ remains of occupation of a diverse nature. The place has in the past been used as a burial site. The likelihood of further buried humans remains is high. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The place is a rare example of an Aboriginal community successfully maintaining traditional affiliation and a group presence at this place continuously throughout the modern era until forced removal in 1942. It is unusual in that this took place in a fast developing urban coastal setting. The richness and diversity of the prehistoric occupation remains is rare in the local and regional context. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of Aboriginal coastal occupation including dispossession and the struggle for land rights.

The effect superimposes a form of noise onto the normal image sensed by the detector (film, digital sensor, or eye viewing through an eyepiece), resulting in a final image degraded by loss of contrast and reduced definition. Scenes In scenes where a bright object is next to a faint object, veiling glare from the bright object may hide the faint object from view, even though the instrument is otherwise capable of spatially resolving the two. Veiling glare is a limiting factor in high-dynamic-range imaging. Glare in optical instruments differs from glare in vision, even though they both follow the same physical principles, because the phenomenon arises from mechanical versus physiological features. Factors and design techniques Light strays or scatters in lenses due to many potential factors in design and operation. These factors include dirt, film, or scratches on lens surfaces; reflections from lens surfaces or their mounts; and the slightly imperfect transparency (or reflection) of real glass (or mirrors). Typical optical engineering design techniques to minimize stray light include: black coatings on internal surfaces, knife edges on mounts, antireflection lens coatings, internal baffles and stops, and tube extensions which block sources outside the field of view.

Prelude  As World War II ended, the British Army landed in Bali, disarmed occupying Japanese troops, and returned to Batavia. Some Dutch KNIL battalions under Gajah Merah, however, stayed in the city. When Gajah Merah's Infantry landed, Ciung Wanara commander I Gusti Ngurah Rai went to Malang to discuss Bali's condition with the head of the Republic Indonesian Army (Indonesian: Tentara Republik Indonesia), who placed one ALRI warship in Gilimanuk Harbour. On 28 May 1946, I Gusti Ngurah Rai led the army's long march to East Bali. Skirmishing began at Tanah Aron on 9 July 1946, moving later to Penglipuran. The long march then resumed until they had arrived at Tabanan. On 20 July 1946, the NICA Y-Brigade first landed at Benoa. On 11 November 1946, the battalion and defected NICA head police officer Wagimin arrived at Dangin Carik, Tabanan, planning to disarm the regency's NICA Police by the night of 18 November. On that day, the combined 300 men of platoons Barisan Banteng and Anak Banteng arrived with weapons.  Battle  On 19 November, the Y-Brigade arrived at army posts in Perean, Baha, Kediri, Tabanan, Penebel, and Jatiluwih to reach Marga and block the Ciung Wanara battalion's movement. Rai knew about the plan and commanded the battalion to disband, with 95 men remaining with him to commit puputan (last stand) in battle. These remaining troops moved to Banjar Kelaci, Marga. On the morning of 20 November 1946, KNIL troops arrived before sunrise to block the remnant of Rai's troops as planned. The battle began at 8:00 AM. At first, KNIL troops thought the battalion's defense was too strong, so they fell back. At 12:00 PM, the Dutch troops were helped by a bomber from Makassar, and resumed the attack after the bombing. The battle ended at 5:00 PM, with 400 Dutch soldiers and the entire remaining Ciung Wanara battalion (including Rai) killed in action. NICA was commanded to bring all of the corpses to the Marga Market, but only 86 bodies were taken. Since Rai's entire force was wiped out, including the military leadership, the Dutch forces were subsequently unopposed and were able to regain control of Bali. This may not have been possible had Ngurah Rai adopted a guerrilla strategy.

With only the early immunosuppressants and no long-term dialysis, the female recipient survived nine months, long enough to return to work. Reemtsma was brought up on a Navajo reservation in Arizona, eventually moving to Utah and then graduating from Idaho State College in Pocatello in 1945. In the 1960s he was professor of surgery at Tulane University, Louisiana and he later became chairman of the Department of Surgery at the University of Utah. Reemtsma also developed the intra-aortic balloon pump to bridge the time to heart transplant, and performed early research on pancreatic islet cell transplantation for diabetes mellitus. In 1971, he was appointed chairman of the Department of Surgery at NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, where he was involved in developing a multidisciplinary approach to transplant services, as well as advocating surgical repair and reconstruction as an alternative to radical excision.  Early life  Reemtsma was born in Madera, California, on 5 December 1925, to the Presbyterian minister and missionary Henry and Pauline Reemtsma. He had one older sister, Carol, and from 1938 was raised on a Navajo reservation in Arizona when he attended a one-room school house which taught only to eighth grade. As he progressed in his education, he moved from schools in Oklahoma to a Presbyterian boarding school in Mount Pleasant, Utah, where he met his first wife to be, Ann Pierce. He attended Idaho State College as part of the United States Navy V-12 programme, where the federal government funded studies to participating colleges. Here, wearing Navy uniform was mandatory and he would have had to participate in strenuous exercise. He completed his pre-medical studies and graduated in 1945. Reemtsma subsequently attended the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, graduating in 1949, and was inducted into the Phi Chi Medical Fraternity. Early surgical training Reemtsma trained under paediatric surgeon C. Everett Koop who encouraged him to go to Columbia- Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC) (now called NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian / Columbia University Medical Center or, simply NYP/Columbia) for his surgical residency, under paediatric thoracic surgeon, George Humphreys. Following his internship, his early surgical career was interrupted by the Korean War, where he served as a Navy doctor with the United States Marine Corps with surgeon Frank Spencer as part of US Navy Surgical Team, Far East Command. Returning to New York in 1954, he then completed his residency at CPMC in 1957, following which he moved south to Tulane University. Here, under Oscar Creech, Reemtsma was recruited to help build a cardiac surgery service. However, he turned his attention toward renal transplantation and cross-species chimpanzee-to-human kidney transplants instead. Surgical career =Xenotransplantation= Prior to the 1960s, long term kidney dialysis was not available, human donors were scarce and immunosuppressants were basic. Unlike centers in Denver and Cleveland, dialysis support came to Reemtsma's center much later,Hamilton, David 2012 p. 280 and Cyclosporine was not available for use in people until the late 1970s. In addition, an increasing understanding of the immunological basis of organ rejection, the \\"clinical urgency\\" of the time, and the ethical and legal hurdles in obtaining donor organs, whether cadaveric or live, led to a desperation. This, combined with Reemtsma's belief in that the lack of previous successful attempts should not deter innovation, led him to explore the possibility of primate-to-human transplantation. The availability of primates from the nearby primate center and an active programme in transplantation immunology, added to his plans. Between 5 November 1963 and 10 February 1964, whilst professor of surgery at Tulane University, Louisiana, Reemtsma performed a series of chimpanzee-to-human kidney transplants. He posited that nonhuman primate kidneys might function in human recipients and therefore be a successful treatment for renal failure, the alternative being death. Chimpanzee kidneys appealed because of their size and shared blood groups (A and O blood groups) with humans.Hamilton, David 2012 pp.291 Retired from space-flight or the circus, bad-tempered or no longer wanted, both kidneys from six chimpanzees were transplanted into six people who had terminal renal failure, using the 'en bloc' technique, where the two kidneys with their accompanying blood vessels (including aorta and vena cava) were implanted and joined to the recipient's external iliac artery and external iliac vein. Anti-rejection medication after the operation included actinomycin C, corticosteroids and x-ray irradiation.Hamilton, David 2012 pp.292 Most survived between just over one week to two months, failure being due to organ rejection or post-operative infection (usually due to the immunosuppressants). One female school teacher, admitted with chronic glomerulonephritis and severe uraemia in November 1963 at the age of 23, had the chimpanzee kidney transplant procedure performed on 13 January 1964. She remained on immunosuppressants azathioprine and prednisolone, and lived to return to work and survive nine months. Her death from cardiac arrest was found to be due to an imbalance of electrolytes, possibly due to the excessive urination observed following chimpanzee kidney transplantation (frequently greater than 20 liters per day), as the chimpanzee kidneys probably did not work in precisely the same way as human kidneys. At autopsy, it was surprising that her transplanted kidneys did not show any signs of rejection and appeared normal. Later, the notion of using nonhuman primates as kidney donors was expanded by a number of surgeons, particularly by Tom Starzl. In 1963, James Hardy, who had carried out the first human lung allotransplant, visited Reemtsma and was impressed by the outcome of the chimpanzee kidney transplantations. Hardy went on to transplant a chimpanzee heart into a human, however, they survived only a few hours. In 1964, at the American Surgical Association meeting in Hot Springs, Virginia, where he presented Tulane's experience of early xenotransplants, including the one patient surviving nine months, he was met with mixed emotions. However, his work gained him a promotion to full professor in 1966. He remained sceptical of the persistent opposition to innovation. =First artificial heart= Between 1966 and 1971, Reemtsma assembled the team that eventually developed the first artificial heart. He was chairman of the Department of Surgery at the University of Utah at the time, a position appointed to him in 1966. He recruited Willem Kolff, the surgeon who, as a young doctor in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands during the Second World War, invented the first dialysis machine using sausage casings and an automobile water pump part. Both were key players in the assembling of the ideal team of surgeons and engineers that eventually implanted the first artificial heart. =New York-Presbyterian Hospital transplant services= Reemtsma then moved again to become chairman of the Department of Surgery at NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital and the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons from 1971 to 1994. He had an overarching vision that surgery should be transformed from a predominantly destructive discipline of incision, excision, and amputation to a creative discipline of reconstruction, repair, replacement, and renewal. In 1971, whilst at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (the Hospital was renamed in 1998), Reemtsma recruited surgeon Mark A. Hardy, who in turn established the programme for dialysis and kidney transplantation and started the shared clinical care between renal transplant surgeons and renal physicians, at a time when the two faculties were considered separate. Reemtsma and surgical colleague Eric Rose further developed the New York- Presbyterian Hospital transplant services on the principles of a multidisciplinary cooperation between surgeons, nephrologists, immunologists and others. Subsequently, the center established research in immunosuppressant therapy and minimally invasive surgical procedures. In addition, Reemtsma was the first to demonstrate that a mechanical circulatory assist device, the intra-aortic balloon pump, could function as a mechanical bridge to heart transplantation. At a time when heart transplants were controversial and were only being performed by Norman Shumway at Stanford University, and Richard Lower in Virginia, Reemtsma was committed and succeeded in strengthening Columbia's cardiac residency training programme. =Pancreatic islet transplantation = Reemtsma spent many years investigating the possibility of non-human islet cell transplantation for diabetes mellitus and in turn influenced Eric Rose who in turn influenced Mark Hardy, the result being a Pancreatic Islet Transplantation Programme. Personal and family Reemtsma met his first wife Ann Pierce at school and they later married while in medical school. They had two sons, Dirk and Lance. Following a divorce shortly after Dirk started college, he married Judy Towers, a New York‚Äìbased medical TV producer, in 1972 and they remained married until his death. His interests outside of surgery included writing a play involving the artist Jan Vermeer and the scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. Reemtsma frequently reiterated the story about how owing to his service in Korea, and his behavior and build, he was the model for \\"Hawkeye Pierce\\" in Richard Hooker's novel MASH. Honours and awards Reemtsma was president of the Society of Clinical Surgery in 1976, president of the American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS) from 1990 to 1991, and the first vice president of the American Surgical Association in 1992. He received the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999.

Its slightly smelling flower heads can be found between July and December, and are pollinated by insects such as flies and bees. About two months after flowering the fruits are ripe and fall to the ground. Here, these are gathered by native ants that carry them to their underground nests, where the seeds remain safe until overhead fire and removal of the biomass triggers gemination. The plants of this species do not survive the fire that occurs naturally in its fynbos habitat. This species is an endemic of the Langkloof between the Gourits River Valley and Garcia's Pass in the Langeberg, where it occurs on the ridges at 1100‚Äì1300 m (3600‚Äì4250 ft) elevation. Although only a few hundred plants are known, the population is stable, so the species is only regarded near threatened. It is called Riversdale pincushion in English.  Description  Leucospermum winteri, habitLeucospermum winteri is a small, evergreen, rounded shrub of about 1‚Öì m (4¬º ft) high and up to 2 m (6¬Ω ft) in diameter, that develops from a single stem. The flowering branches are covered in downy hairs and are ¬Ω‚Äì¬æ cm (0.2‚Äì0.3 in) thick. The leaves are set alternately along the branches somewhat overlapping at an upward angle, and lack both stipules and stalk. They are broadly inverted egg-shaped to broadly wedge-shaped, 4‚Äì7 cm (1.6‚Äì2¬æ in) long and 2‚Äì4¬Ω cm (0.8‚Äì1.8 in) wide, and are initially covered in soft crisped hairs with some straight hairs in between, that vanish later on. Towards the tip, there are five to fourteen blunt, reddish, thickened teeth. The globe-shaped flower heads are about 3 cm (1¬º in) in diameter, sit on a stalk of 1¬Ω‚Äì3 cm (‚Öù‚Äì1¬º in) long, with three to six together near the end of the branches. Each flower head is subtended by an involucre consisting of ovate bracts with a pointy tip of ¬æ‚Äì1 cm (0.28‚Äì0.40 in) that are cartilaginous, thickly covered with densely matted woolly hairs and with a tuft of very short straight hairs at the tip, tightly overlapping, pressed against the underside of the flower head. The common base of the flowers in the same head is somewhat variable in shape, skewed cone-shaped to egg-shaped, 5‚Äì8 mm (0.20‚Äì0.32 in) long and about 5 mm wide. The bracts subtending the individual flower are egg-shaped, about 7 mm (0.28 in) long and 2¬Ω‚Äì3 mm (0.10‚Äì0.12 in) wide, the tips thickened and ending abruptly in a short sharp point, and thickly covered with densely matted woolly hairs. The 4-merous perianth is 1¬º‚Äì1¬Ω cm (0.5‚Äì0.6 in) long, straight and cylinder-shaped while still in the bud, the outside initially yellow but later becoming pink, while on the inside a deep crimson colour develops. The lower part where the lobes remain merged when the flower has opened (called tube) is up to 8 mm (‚Öì in) long, hairless near the base and with very fine powdery hairs where it changes in the middle part (or claws) where the perianth is split lengthwise. These claws are all equally coiled back when the flower has opened, with the outer surface sparsely shaggy haired. The upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud consists of four lance-shaped lobes of about long, which carry a few stiff hairs. From the perianth emerges a straight or slightly incurved style of about 2 cm (0.8 in) long, tapering in the upper part. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is about 1 mm (0.04 in) long, egg- to hoof-shaped with a groove across its very tip. It is difficult to distinguish where the ovary changes in the style. It is powdery hairy and is subtended by four pointy, line- to thread-shaped scales of 3‚Äì4 mm (0.12‚Äì0.16 in) long.  Taxonomy  As far as known, a Dr. John Muir, a medical doctor and amateur plantsman that lived in Riversdale, was the first to collect a specimen of the Riversdale pincushion in 1909. The collected specimen however only had very young buds, and a mistake must have been made in noting its location, namely Stilbaai. In 1938, a specimen was obtained from a hotel in Riversdale by Mr. L. Guthrie. Early 1974, Mr. J.H. Winter, at the time curator at Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden stumbled on a population on the flanks of a remote peak on Langkloof Farm in the Langeberg Mountains near Riversdale. John Patrick Rourke made a second collection of this population late 1974. In 1979, he described the species and named it Leucospermum winteri. L. winteri has been assigned to the section Diastelloidea. The species has been named winteri in honor of J. Winter.  Conservation  The Riversdale pincushion is considered near threatened, because the approximately ten subpopulations that occur within an area are stable, but potentially at risk due to afforestation and invasive species.

Her case (Susan Kigula and 416 Others vs Attorney General, 2009) resulted in changes to Ugandan law regarding the death penalty. Kigula was imprisoned in 2000. Along with her maid Nansamba Patience, she was accused of the murder of her partner, Constantine Sseremba. The court case hinged on the testimony of her three- year-old stepson. In 2009 she was sentenced to death by hanging. Kigula challenged the death sentence ruling in the Supreme Court of Uganda, resulting in changes to Ugandan law regarding the death penalty. The two principal changes were: the death sentence was no longer mandatory in cases of murder, and the death sentence would be commuted to life imprisonment if the execution was not carried out within three years of sentencing. As a result of these changes, around 180 prisoners on death row had their death sentences rescinded. In November 2011, at a retrial, Kigula's sentence was reduced to 20 years in prison. She began to study for a law degree, which she completed in 2018. Kigula was released from prison in 2016. She maintains her innocence in regard to Sseremba's murder.

Battle of Britain and Blitz During the Phoney War period there were a number of attacks on the naval bases of Scotland before the Luftwaffe turned its attention to the campaigns in Norway and France and the Low Countries.Routledge, pp. 375‚Äì6. Eastern Scotland largely escaped air attack during the Battle of Britain. In November 1940, at the height of The Blitz, a new 12 AA Division was formed to take over responsibility for western Scotland (including Glasgow and the Clyde) while 3 AA Division retained responsibility for eastern Scotland. The only effect of this on 52 LAA Bde was that 57th (Glasgow) S/L Rgt transferred to 12 AA Division.Pile's despatch.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 397.

Tunisian Campaign 52 AA Brigade was one of four AA brigade HQs assigned to First Army for the landings in North Africa (Operation Torch). 22 AA Brigade had units fully trained in amphibious operations and mobile warfare and would land in the assault phase of the operation, followed by 52 AA Bde. After covering the landing beaches, ports and airfields, the two brigades would then follow First Army's advance eastwards, leaving the other brigades to cover the bases in the rear. After sailing in convoy from the Clyde in late October, the invasion force began landing on 8 November, with V Corps of First Army landing round Algiers. After the initial landings were complete, V Corps sent a series of infantry and commando groups eastwards on 9 November and 52 AA Bde HQ landed under Brigadier John Ross.Playfair & Molony, pp. 137-46, 165.Routledge, pp. 176‚Äì9 ; Map 8.Farndale, Annex J.Ross at Generals of WWII. 3-inch gun in action in North Africa 1942. Leaving three HAA and three LAA batteries to unload and set up an 'Inner Artiller Zone' (IAZ) around Algiers, 22 and 52 AA Bdes began a long march eastwards. Reinforcing AA units were held up by congestion in Algiers docks (the tactical priorities laid down by the AA brigades had been ignored in loading the ships), and some AA units went by sea direct to Bougie. Others suffered losses of men and equipment in torpedoed ships. By 12 November V Corps' leading troops had covered . The need to get AA units forward quickly to protect the vital airfields had been foreseen, and three of the HAA regiments deployed in the operation (58th (Kent), 71st (Forth) and 80th (Berkshire) HAA Rgts) had been deliberately equipped with obsolescent 3-inch 20 cwt guns rather than modern 3.7-inch guns, because the former were lighter and handier, and were quicker to deploy in rough country. This paid off when the light HAA and LAA guns were able to deploy and drive off Junkers Ju 87 Stukas as they deployed at Djidjelli and Philippeville airfields.Routledge, pp. 179‚Äì81. As the Tunisian Campaign developed, forward movement was slowed by terrain and shortages: most units in 'Torch' had only 50 per cent of their vehicle establishment, and AA units frequently had to lend theirs to other units for urgent transport tasks. By the end of November the AA deployment had reached planned levels, but V Corps' advance had been held by the rapid arrival of German forces. As the Allies built up strength for a renewed advance, the emphasis for the AA units turned to defence for the ports and airfields against heavy attacks by the Luftwaffe. By January the arrival of reinforcements allowed 22 AA Bde to be fully committed to airfield defence, while 52 AA Bde provided front line support for V Corps and was prepared to follow up any breakthrough towards Tunis.Playfair & Molony, pp. 165‚Äì82.Routledge, pp. 180‚Äì2. By mid-January 1943, 52 AA Bde was deployed as follows:Routledge, Table XXX, p. 188. * Bougie port: Bty 58th (Kent) HAA Rgt, Bty 76th (Gloucestershire) HAA Rgt, 'V' AA Operations Room (AAOR) * Constantine airfield: Bty 72nd (Hampshire) HAA Rgt * Djidjelli airfield: Bty 71st (Forth) HAA Rgt * Philippeville port and airfield: Bty 72nd HAA Rgt, Trp 71st HAA Rgt * Youks-les-Bains Airfield: Bty 72nd HAA Rgt * Thelepte Airfield: Bty 72nd HAA Rgt * Ain Beida Airfield: Trp 71st HAA Rgt * One US Army AA Artillery/Coastal Artillery battalion also under command The policy of forward deployment paid off: when General von Arnim launched a counter-offensive against V Corps in February (Operation Ochsenkopf), 52 AA Bde was able to provide 32 HAA and over 200 LAA guns to cover the combat zone, while transferring 24 HAA and 72 LAA guns to the Free French XIX Corps. Behind, 62 AA Bde moved up to relieve 52 AA Bde of responsibility for Bougie and Djidjelli.Playfair & Molony, pp. 326‚Äì8.Routledge, pp. 183‚Äì4. By mid-March 1943, 52 AA Bde was deployed as follows:Routledge, Table XXXI, p. 189. * Forward areas: 2 Btys 80th (Berkshire) HAA Rgt * Philippeville: 79th HAA Rgt, Bty 64th LAA Rgt, 567 S/L Bty from 30th (Surrey) S/L Rgt * Youks le Bains: Bty 71st HAA Rgt, Bty 29th LAA Rgt * Tebessa Airfield: 1 Btys 72nd HAA Rgt, Bty 63rd LAA Rgt * Constantine: Trp 72nd HAA Rgt * Ain Beida: Bty 71st HAA Rgt 3.7-inch gun operating in the field gun role in Tunisia. As the fighting continued in April, the HAA guns in forward positions were increasingly used to fire on ground targets to supplement the medium artillery. In one week, 20‚Äì27 April, 72nd HAA Rgt shot down seven enemy aircraft for the expenditure of 1022 rounds, but fired many more low-angle rounds at ground targets, which damaged the elevating and balancing gear of the 3.7-inch guns. Meanwhile the LAA guns were in frequent action against Stuka dive-bombers and low-level attacks by Messerschmitt Bf 109s.Routledge, pp. 184‚Äì5. By the beginning of May, First Army was ready for its final assault on Tunis, Operation Vulcan. The AA plan or 'Vulcan' was straightforward: 52 AA Bde would hold three HAA and three LAA regiments, a S/L troop and a Z battery of rocket-launchers, all on their wheels and ready to move into Tunis and Bizerte immediately behind the leading battle groups. DElayed by a German counter-attack, the assault went in on 6 May and covered on the first day. The leading British armoured units entered Tunis on the afternoon of 7 May while US units entered Bizerte simultaneously. After a series of conflicting reports from the cities, 52 AA Bde was called forward. In fact, neither Tunis nor Bizerte was clear of the enemy. At Bizerte the AA advance parties were shelled from outside the town, and two batteries of 29th LAA Rgt had to be employed as infantry to flush out resistance.Playfair & Molony, pp. 430, 452‚Äì9.Routledge, pp. 185‚Äì6; Map 9. After Operation Vulcan, 52 AA Bde deployed the following forces:Routledge, Table XXXII, p. 190. * Bizerte: 58th HAA Rgt, 29th LAA Rgt, 184 Z Bty, detachment 30th S/L Rgt, AAOR * Tunis: 72nd HAA Rgt, 45th LAA Rgt, HQ and one Bty 30th S/L Rgt, AAOR After the German surrender on 12 May, the British forces' heaviest AA commitment was at Bizerte which was set up as an IAZ because of its importance as an embarkation port for the forthcoming Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). No sooner had 58th (Kent) HAA Rgt deployed in Bizerte than it was relieved by (being relieved by 84th (Middlesex, London Transport) HAA Rgt) and sent as part of the invasion force for Pantelleria (Operation Corkscrew). The rest of the front line AA units that had fought through the Tunisian campaign were able to be relieved for rest and refitting, and training for Husky.Routledge, p. 186. Italian Campaign 52 AA Brigade spent almost a year defending the North African bases at Bizerte, B√¥ne and Philippeville before it was finally called forward to join the Italian Campaign in April 1944. Under the command of Brig John ParkesParkes at Generals of WWII. it sailed for Barletta, arriving on 20 April with the following units:Routledge, p. 291. * 62nd (Northumbrian) HAA Rgt * 79th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry)HAA Rgt * 106th HAA Rgt * 29th LAA Rgt * 64th LAA Rgt * 6th US S/L Bn * 52 AAOR On arrival, the brigade took over command of the following units from other AA brigades already in Italy: * 55th (Kent) HAA Rgt * 76th (Gloucestershire) HAA Rgt * 100th HAA Rgt * 66th LAA Rgt * 20 AAOR RAF Supermarine Spitfires and a USAAF Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress at Foggia Main airfield. These units were distributed to defend the important complex of airfields round Foggia, Cerignola and Spinazzola:Routledge, Table XLIV, p. 293.Routledge, Table XLVII, p. 296. * Foggia: ** 55th HAA Rgt; Bty 100th HAA Rgt, Trp 76th HAA Rgt ‚Äì 60 x 3.7-inch guns ** 29th LAA Rgt, 66th LAA Rgt ‚Äì 108 x Bofors 40 mm guns ** 6th US S/L Bn ‚Äì 144 x S/Ls ** 20, 52 AAORs * Cerignola: ** 76th HAA Rgt less one Trp ‚Äì 20 x 3.7-inch ** 64th LAA Rgt less four Trps ‚Äì 30 x 40 mm ** Detachment 52 AAOR * Spinazzola: ** 106th HAA Rgt less 1 Bty, 1 Bty 100th HAA Rgt ‚Äì 24 x 3.7-inch ** 1 Bty plus 1 Trp 64th LAA Rgt ‚Äì 24 x 40 mm The US S/L companies were deployed in two modes: for dazzle in conjunction with Bofors guns, and in an area layout for cooperation with Night-fighters. Over succeeding months there were minor changes: 55th (Kent) HAA Rgt left and was replaced at Foggia by 100th HAA Rgt; 106th HAA Rgt, except for one Bty, left and was replaced by 79th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) HAA Rgt. In mid-July, 52 Bde HQ took over responsibility from 8 AA Bde for half a dozen additional airfields in the 'heel' of Italy: these were defended by 22nd LAA Rgt and an LAA Wing of the Royal Air Force Regiment. By late 1944 the Luftwaffe was suffering from such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious air attacks were rare. At the same time the British Army was suffering a severe manpower shortage. The result was that a number of AA units were deemed surplus and were disbanded to provide reinforcements to other arms of service. The air threat to southern Italy was now minimal, and 52 AA Bde underwent a rapid run-down: 100th HAA Regiment was disbanded, 64th and 66th LAA Rgts left to be converted into infantry, and 79th HAA and 22nd, 29th LAA and the RAF Regiment Wing were transferred to other brigades. On 15 October 1944 52 AA Bde HQ converted into HQ, 'D' Sub-Area at Foggia on the lines of communication. Postwar When the TA was reformed on 1 January 1947, the brigade was renumbered as 78 Anti-Aircraft Brigade, with its HQ at Perth and forming part of 3 AA Group at Edinburgh.

In 2018 she recorded four consecutive Group 1 races, namely the Irish 1,000 Guineas, Coronation Stakes, Falmouth Stakes and Prix Jacques Le Marois. Background Alpha Centauri is a \\"massive\\" grey mare bred in Ireland by the Niarchos family. She was sent into training with Jessica Harrington at Moone, in County Kildare. She has been ridden in all of her races by Colm O'Donoghue. Her sire Mastercraftsman, from whom she inherited her colour, was a top class performer whose wins included the Phoenix Stakes, National Stakes, Irish 2,000 Guineas and St James's Palace Stakes. As a breeding stallion, his other offspring include Kingston Hill, Amazing Maria and The Grey Gatsby. Her dam Alpha Lupi was unraced, but came from a very successful female bloodline which has been in the ownership of the Niarchos family for several generations: she was a daughter of East of the Moon who was in turn a daughter of Miesque. Racing career =2017: two-year-old season= Alpha Centauri made her racecourse debut on 1 May in a maiden race over six furlongs at Naas Racecourse and was made the 2/1 against thirteen opponents. She led from the start, steadily increased her advantage in the last quarter mile and won \\"easily\\" by three lengths from the Aidan O'Brien-trained Actress. Twenty days later, over the same course and distance, the filly started 8/11 favourite for the Group 3 Fillies'Sprint Stakes and recorded another easy win, beating Actress by five lengths. A month later she was sent to England and started favourite in a twenty-runner field for the Albany Stakes but despite finishing strongly he failed to overhaul the French filly Different League and was beaten a neck into second place. After a break of well over two months the filly returned in the Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh and was again made favourite. She raced in second place for most of the way but faded in the closing stages and came home fifth of the eight runners behind Happily. =2018: three-year-old season= At Leopardstown Racecourse on 14 April Alpha Centauri began her second season 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes and finished tenth of the thirteen runners behind Who's Steph in a race run on heavy ground. In the Irish 1000 Guineas over one mile at the Curragh on 27 May, the filly started the 12/1 fifth choice in the betting behind Happily, Soliloquy (Nell Gwyn Stakes), Who's Steph and Clemmie (Cheveley Park Stakes). Alpha Centauri was settled in mid-division as Could It Be Love, a 33/1 outsider who was presumed to be running as a pacemaker for the Aidan O'Brien stable's more fancied runners set off in front and opened up a long lead. Approaching the final furlong Could It Be Love was still in front and looked to be on the verge of a huge upset victory but Alpha Centauri produced a strong late run, gained the advantage in the last hundred yards and won by one and three quarter lengths. On 22 June at Royal Ascot Alpha Centauri started 11/4 favourite for the Coronation Stakes in a twelve-runner field which included Clemmie, Billesdon Brook, Teppal (Poule d'Essai des Pouliches), Threading (Lowther Stakes) and Cour de Beaute (Prix Imprudence). Having settled towards the middle of the field she overtook the front-running Veracious approaching the final furlong and accelerated away to win by six lengths in \\"very impressive\\" style. Harrington, who was recording her first Group 1 win in Britain said \\"Colm was very confident on her and she settled great. I thought he'd got to the front a bit soon but the further she went, the better she went.\\" Three weeks later, Alpha Centauri was matched against older fillies and mares in the Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. Starting at odds of 4/9 she took the lead after the first quarter mile and was never in danger of defeat, drawing away in the closing stages to win \\"easily\\" by four and a half lengths from Altyn Orda. In the paddock after the race Harrington commented \\"She's just an amazing filly. And the lovely thing about her, she's so relaxed, she doesn't get upset, she comes in here, has her photograph taken and goes away. I sometimes think, before a race, she's almost too relaxed\\". The Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville Racecourse on 12 August saw Alpha Centauri tested against male opposition. She went of the 9/10 favourite against ten opponents including With You (Prix Rothschild), Intellogent (Prix Jean Prat), Recoletos (Prix d'Ispahan), Romanised (Irish 2,000 Guineas) and Accidental Agent (Queen Anne Stakes). She tracked the front-running With You before taking the lead 500 metres and drew away to win by two and a half lengths from Recoletos. In response to the performance the official Irish Handicapper gave her a rating of 124, making her the highest- rated Irish-trained three-year-old filly since Ridgewood Pearl in 1995. In the July and August 2018 editions of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings Alpha Centauri was rated the best three-year-old filly in the world. On 15 September Alpha Centauri tarted the 30/100 favourite for the Matron Stakes over one mile at Leopardstown. After turning into the straight in third place she made good progress to move into second but was unable to overhaul the British-trained filly Laurens and was beaten three quarters of a length. She appeared to veer left a furlong out and a veterinary examination revealed that she had sustained a serious injury to her fetlock. On the day after the race it was announced that the filly had been retired from racing. Harrington commented \\"I've had an amazing summer with her... It was incredible to have her, and no- one can take away what she's done. For her to sustain the injury she did yesterday ‚Äì and everyone could see when she did it ‚Äì and still run on to finish second to another very, very good filly says it all\\". At the 2018 Cartier Awards, Alpha Centauri was named Champion Three-year-old Filly. In December she was voted Horse of the Year at the Horse Racing Ireland awards. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Alpha Centauri was rated the best three-year-old filly in the world (level with Almond Eye) and the eleventh best horse of any age or sex.

PKa's cleavage of HK liberates BK and promotes inflammation. FXIIa's cleavage of FXI initiates coagulation. In the contact activation system or CAS, three proteins in the blood, factor XII (FXII), prekallikrein (PK) and high molecular weight kininogen (HK), bind to a surface and cause blood coagulation and inflammation. FXII and PK are proteases and HK is a non-enzymatic co-factor. The CAS can activate the kinin‚Äìkallikrein system and blood coagulation through its ability to activate multiple downstream proteins. The CAS is initiated when FXII binds to a surface and reciprocal activation of FXII and PK occurs, forming FXIIa and PKa. FXIIa can initiate the coagulation cascade by cleaving and activating factor XI (FXI), which leads to formation of a blood clot. Additionally, the CAS can activate the kinin‚Äìkallikrein system when PKa cleaves HK to form cHK, releasing a peptide known as bradykinin (BK). BK and its derivatives bind to bradykinin receptors B1 and B2 to mediate inflammation. Surfaces and activation Artificial negatively charged substances that activate FXII include L-homocysteine, heparan sulfates, chondroitin sulfates, dermatan sulfate, uric acid crystals, lipoproteins, ferritin and porphyrins. However, the physiological substances or surfaces that activate FXII are still under debate. These may include proteins, such as gC1q-R, aggregated proteins, amyloid, collagen, nucleic acids, and polyphosphates. The ability of FXII to bind to negatively charged surfaces and activate coagulation forms the basis of the aPTT test, in which artificial materials act as a surface for contact activation. This test is used to measure the contact activation pathway (intrinsic pathway) and the common pathway of clotting. FXII is a zymogen, which means that it requires processing to attain its catalytic protease activity. Upon binding to surfaces, FXII alters in its conformation, giving it low-level protease activity. This change in conformation also promotes its cleavage by PKa and cleavage by FXIIa itself. FXIIa can cleave PK producing PKa, producing a positive feed-back to activate both enzymes. HK binds to PK and is required to locate PK at the surface for activation by FXII. Zinc has been reportedly demonstrated to be crucial in inducing a conformational change in both FXII and HK as it is required for assembly of FXII and HK bound PK on some negatively charged surfaces. Zinc is suggested to mediate binding of FXII and HK to negatively charged surfaces including gC1q-R and Polyphosphates. Contact factors binding to bacteria and viruses Although contact factors FXII and HK bound PK have been reported to interact with endothelial cells (via gC1q-R), platelets (via Polyphosphate) and Leukocytes; bacteria (Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli) and viruses (Hantavirus and Herpes simplex 1 virus) have also been demonstrated to bind to contact factors. Negatively charged lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or surface associated negatively charged teichoic acids from S. aureus and long chain Polyphosphate have all been shown to induce contact activation and bradykinin release thereby contributing to the host-defense reactions by activating the complement cascade. Physiological roles Although the contact system can activate FXI and the subsequent clotting cascade, and it is routinely observed to activate coagulation in the presence of medical devices, the actual role of the contact system in normal physiological coagulation remains contentious. This is primarily due to the fact that deficiencies in the contact system proteins FXII, PK and HK do not produce bleeding disorders. The contact activation system's physiological role in the kinin-kallikrein system is more clear. Here, after activation of PK to PKa by FXIIa, PKa cleaves HK. This produces cleaved HK (cHK), releasing a small peptide known as bradykinin. This peptide binds to bradykinin receptor B2 and its derivative, Des- Arg9-bradykinin binds to bradykinin receptor B1. Upon ligand binding, these receptors mediate inflammatory responses. Roles in disease Activation of the CAS is associated with hereditary angioedema, a disorder characterised by episodes of swelling. Genetic knockout studies in murine models of cardiovascular disease and genetic linkage studies in humans have implicated the contact factors in contributing to diverse cardiovascular disease processes including thrombosis and stroke.

They have published instructions for the \\"EpiPencil\\", an epinephrine autoinjector, and the \\"Apothecary MicroLab\\", a do- it-yourself (DIY) device intended to make a variety of medications, most notably pyrimethamine (Daraprim). They have been widely criticized by the medical community for causing potential harm to patients with the DIY instructions, but Laufer claims to defend people's right to attempt their own medical treatment. History Laufer, who is trained in mathematics rather than medicine, decided to form the group in 2008 during a graduate school trip to El Salvador. While visiting a local medical clinic he learned that despite the existence of many clandestine chemistry labs producing methamphetamine and MDMA, the clinic was out of oral contraceptives. He investigated the possibility of DIY pharmaceuticals which culminated in the founding of Four Thieves in 2015. He took the name from four thieves vinegar, a legendary plague cure. Four Thieves had formerly partnered with Chematica to develop recipes for the group's medication, but this ended and they lost access to information and software they had been given after pharmaceutical company Merck bought the startup. Members Four Thieves' membership is generally composed of technically-trained people, but does not include medical professionals. Views Laufer has compared his work to that of Women on Waves, a group that provides abortion medication to women in areas where abortion is illegal. His motivation in founding the group is to provide medication to people when it is too expensive for them to afford, is illegal to acquire, or is unavailable due to it treating an orphan disease. He believes that providing lifesaving medication to any that need it justifies violating intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical companies, and supports cognitive liberty. EpiPencil In 2016 after the price for an EpiPen was raised from $57 to $318 by its manufacturer Mylan, Four Thieves released instructions for how to build an \\"EpiPencil\\", a homemade epinephrine autoinjector that can be built for $30. It is made from three off-the-shelf parts. It has been criticized for potential danger. Theresa Eisenman, a spokeswoman for the United States Food and Drug Administration, stated that using such a device is a \\"potentially dangerous practice\\". The device is not known to have actually been used. Apothecary MicroLab Four Thieves has released instructions for building an \\"Apothecary MicroLab\\", a DIY device claimed to be able to synthesize a variety of medications. The group released instructions how to manufacture pyrimethamine (Daraprim) from acetonitrile, ethyl bromide, and dicyandiamide with it. Laufer claims that it can also be used to make naloxone, cabotegravir, mifepristone, and misoprostol. Jeremiah Johnson, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has stated that using it would be very dangerous as it could create the wrong drug or the wrong dose. Eric von Hippel, an economist at MIT who supports DIY medication, has stated that the design could create chemical byproducts as well as or instead of the intended medication. Laufer claims that they have successfully synthesized cabotegravir, an experimental new integrase inhibitor, and asked heroin dealers to cut their product with it in order to help lower the rates of HIV infection among heroin users. Reception Jose Gomez-Marquez, who is researching pharmaceuticals at MIT, has stated his belief that the group is more about publicity than medication, and is concerned about the danger of unvetted information being published. Vinay Prasad, a professor of medicine at Oregon Health & Science University, believes that DIY medication is \\"foolhardy\\". Josiah Zayner, another biohacker, believes that the group's work is more symbolic than anything else. Chemist Derek Lowe described the Vice magazine article on the collective as \\"largely bullshit\\". He noted that they had synthesized known substances rather than producing new ones. He also pointed out that their proposal to combat Hepatitis C could accidentally cause treatment-resistant strains of Hepatitis C. Legal status Patricia Zettler, a former attorney at the FDA, believes that Four Thieves' work is legal because they are only providing information rather than drugs themselves.

In 1686, the Habsburgs conquered Buda and in 1688 the fortresses located on the Mure»ô River: SzegedAradLipova, but in the following years the latter switched hands, with various commanders. Between late 1689 and early 1690, the Ottoman Empire conducted a long siege of Timi»ôoara Fortress which ended with the Habsburgs‚Äô retreat. In mid-1695, Sultan Mustafa II visited the Timi»ôoara and Lipova fortresses, and ordered their reinforcement. In July 1696, the Habsburg army under the command of Augustus II the Strong besieged Timi»ôoara; his engineers positioned artillery and other military engineering works around the fortress in early August. This siege failed and the Habsburgs were forced to retreat.Ilie»ôiu, Monografia‚Ä¶, p. 65Ha»õegan, Cronologia‚Ä¶, pp. 259‚Äì285Ha»õegan, Cronologia‚Ä¶, pp. 307‚Äì310Ha»õegan, Prin Timi»ôoara‚Ä¶, pp. 141‚Äì149 Prince Eugene of Savoy's army crossed the Tisa River on 11 September 1697, defeating the Ottoman army at the Battle of Zenta.Preyer, Monographie‚Ä¶, p. 181Ha»õegan, Cronologia‚Ä¶, p. 287Ha»õegan, Prin Timi»ôoara‚Ä¶, p. 157 On 5 August 1716, Eugene of Savoy won another victory over the Ottoman army at Petrovaradin. With enough resources for further action he headed towards Timi»ôoara. The Habsburg Army had about 45,000 men, more than 23,000 horses, 50 field guns and 87 siege cannons. The Ottoman garrison, led by Bodor Mustafa Pasha,Ha»õegan, Cronologia‚Ä¶, p. 305 consisted of approximately 16,000 men and 150 cannons.Preyer, Monographie‚Ä¶, p. 182Ha»õegan, Cronologia‚Ä¶, p. 307Ha»õegan, Istoria‚Ä¶, p. 59  Siege  A plan of the Habsburg siege of Timi»ôoara. The fortifications were always being fixed; but most were made of earth hardened by palisades of whitewashed tree trunks, which were ineffective against 18th century cannons. The only masonry buildings were the castle, the mosques and the courtain surrounding the castle ‚Äì the southern part of the city, the Angevin Fortress. All of the other buildings were made of wood, making them prone to destruction by fire.Ha»õegan, Timi»ôoara‚Ä¶, pp. 187‚Äì191Opri»ô, Mihai and Botescu, Mihai (2014). Arhitectura istoricƒÉ din Timi»ôoara, Timi»ôoara: Ed. Tempus, , pp. 43‚Äì45 On 21 August 1716, General Joachim Ignaz von Rotenhan reached Timi»ôoara with 14 cavalry squadrons (1662‚Äì1736). On 25 August, 16 cavalry regiments under the command of J√°nos P√°lffy and 10 infantry battalions under the command of Charles Alexander, Duke of W√ºrttemberg arrived in . The other troops, including Eugene of Savoy's, arrived on 26 August. J√°nos P√°lffy and his cavalry settled to the south of the fortress, with the purpose of blocking any Ottoman attempts to fetch reinforcements. Eugene of Savoy set up his General Staff, infantry, artillery and some cavalry to the northern part of the fortress, completely surrounding it. The besiegers had approximately 30,000 hand grenades and 760 tons of gunpowder.Ha»õegan, Prin Timi»ôoara‚Ä¶, pp. 178‚Äì183Ha»õegan, Istoria‚Ä¶, pp. 60‚Äì62 On 28 August, the besiegers captured the summer residence of the Turkish Governor, Pasha's Well, which the Ottomans set on fire before they retreated. The siege began on 31 August. Between 1 and 15 September, the armies prepared for the battle. 3,000 people dug zigzag and parallel trenches alongside Palanca Mare. On 5 September, the first two batteries with nine cannons were installed and on 6 September there was another battery with five cannons whose fire covered the military works. On September 8, the trenches almost reached the palisade and began the filling of the moat with fascines. To prevent this, on the night of 9 September, the Ottomans attacked the trenches with torches to ignite the fascines but they were repulsed because the torches indicated the target's position. On 10 September, the Sch√∂nborn Dragoon Regiment fought off another Ottoman attack.Preyer, Monographie‚Ä¶, p. 183 Beginning 16 September, the bombardment spread on the battlefield, growing in intensity as the cannons arrived and were installed. The first proposition to surrender was addressed on 17 September and was refused by the Ottomans. Between 20 September and 22 September the first breaches appeared in the walls and the wife and two sons of the beylerbey had been killed in their own house during the bombardment. In the meantime, another army corps consisting of 14 cavalry squadrons, 4 infantry battalions, 3 companies of grenadiers and 2 regiments of cuirassiers fighting under the command of General Count √âtienne de Stainville (? ‚Äì 1720) ‚Äì commander of the imperial troops from Sibiu, then governor of Transylvania and Oltenia during the Austrian occupation ‚Äì arrived in Timi»ôoara from Alba Iulia. At the time, Eugene of Savoy controlled 70 regiments; 32 of which were infantry (69 battalions), 10 dragoon regiments (60 squadrons), 22 cavalry regiments (134 squadrons) and 6 hussar regiments (31 squadrons).Cernovodeanu, P. and VƒÉtƒÉmanu, T.

The following day, the Ottoman troops from Belgrade arrived; they attempted to supply the fortress and attacked three times from the south to break through the encirclement. Simultaneously, the defenders of the fortress attacked but the rescuing troops attacked before the agreed time and, with no help from inside the fortress, had been pushed back. The attack from the fortress had also been repulsed because of the lack of organization, so the rescuing party was forced to turn back. On 30 September the counterguard was conquered at the cost of 455 deaths ‚Äì of which 64 were officers ‚Äì and 1,487 wounded, including 160 officers. Between 1 October and 10 October, new preparations were being made and cannons were being placed. On October 11, a new, massive bombardment with the aim of destroying the fortifications began. The attack was carried out by 43 pieces of heavy artillery and continued throughout the night.  Aftermath  Negotiating the terms of surrender.

For this reason, when the wavefront quality requirement are met, it is an alternative to aperture masking interferometry that can be executed without a mask while retaining phase error rejection properties. The observables are computed through linear algebra from the Fourier transform of direct images. They can then be used for statistical testing, model fitting, or image reconstruction. Prerequisites In order to extract kernel-phases from an image, some requirements must be met: * Images are nyquist-sampled (at least 2 pixels per resolution element ( \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{D} )) * Images are taken in near monochromatic light * Exposure time is shorter than the timescale of aberrations * Strehl ratio is high (good adaptive optics) * Linearity of the pixel response (i.e. no saturation) Deviations from these requirements are known to be acceptable, but lead to observational bias that should be corrected by the observation of calibrators. Definition The method relies on a discrete model of the instrument's pupil plane and the corresponding list of baselines to provide corresponding vectors \\\\varphi of pupil plane errors and \\\\Phi of image plane Fourier Phases. When the wavefront error in the pupil plane is small enough (i.e. when the Strehl ratio of the imaging system is sufficiently high), the complex amplitude associated to the instrumental phase in one point of the pupil \\\\varphi_k, can be approximated by e^{i\\\\varphi_k} \\\\approx 1 + \\\\mathit{i}\\\\varphi_{k} . This permits the expression of the pupil-plane phase aberrations \\\\varphi to the image plane Fourier phase as a linear transformation described by the matrix A: :\\\\Phi = \\\\Phi_0 + A \\\\cdot \\\\varphi Where \\\\Phi_0 is the theoretical Fourier phase vector of the object. In this formalism, Singular Value Decomposition can be used to find a matrix K satisfying K \\\\cdot A=0. The rows of K constitute a basis of the kernel of A^{T}. :K \\\\cdot \\\\Phi = K \\\\cdot \\\\Phi_0 + \\\\cancel{K \\\\cdot A \\\\cdot \\\\varphi} The vector K.\\\\Phi is called the kernel-phase vector of observables. This equation can be used for model-fitting as it represents the interpretation of a sub- space of the Fourier phase that is immune to the instrumental phase errors to the first order. Applications The technique was first used in the re- analysis of archival images Pope 2013: Dancing in the Dark: New Brown Dwarf Binaries from Kernel Phase Interferometry from the Hubble Space Telescope where it enabled the discovery of a number of brown dwarf in close binary systems. The technique is used as an alternative to aperture masking interferometryIreland 2013 : Phase errors in diffraction-limited imaging: contrast limits for sparse aperture masking, especially for fainter stars because it does not require the use of masks that typically block 90% of the light, and therefore allows higher throughput.

The same framework can be used for wavefront sensing Martinache 2013 : The Asymmetric Pupil Fourier Wavefront Sensor . In the case of an asymmetric aperture, a pseudo-inverse of A can be used to reconstruct the wavefront errors directly from the image.

The hamlet is at the junction of Stonards Hill where it becomes Coopersale Street (road), and Houblons Hill which runs north to the village of Coopersale. The hamlet of Fiddlers Hamlet is to the south. Coopersale Street has been a hamlet since at least the 18th century, witnessed by a 1777 map of Chapman and Andr√©, and was previously in the parish of Theydon Garnon. The hamlet was part of the Epping Union, poor relief provision set up under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. In the 19th century it was seen as within the identifiable Coopersale northern district of Theydon Garnon parish, which itself had become a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1852 as part of the rural deanery of Chigwell. In 1891 the northwestern parts of Theydon Garnon parish including Coopersale Street, Coopersale and Fiddlers Hamlet were alienated to become part of Epping Urban District (from 1974 Epping Forest District).'Theydon Garnon: Introduction', in A History of the County of Essex Volume 4, Ongar Hundred, ed.

It is also known as Standish and Greenwich Hospital. The property is owned by Anglican Church Property Trust. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Originally named Standish, the villa was constructed in 1892 for John St Vincent Welch. Welch, born in Devonshire, England in 1847, moved to Australia in 1876. He is alleged to have designed Standish himself, although the unusual features of the house, such as the stair hall and roof light, suggest an architect's involvement. Many materials are believed to have been selected during his family's visit to England including the mahogany for the grand stair, the Bangor roof slates, the marble fireplace in the drawing room, plus various pieces of furniture and paintings. Standish was set back from River Road facing south-east. It looked back across bushland in the direction of Greenwich Road and from the southern side of the house had spectacular views across the Lane Cove and Parramatta Rivers to the Blue Mountains. By 1894 the land in front of the house had been cleared and fenced and was being used as a paddock. The clay driveway with its entrance from River Road had a circular carriage loop in front of the house, and is shown in early images. The drive continued past the northern side of the houe and the kitchen wing, past the men's quarters and continued to the stables and garage area below. It then continued out onto River Road. The entrance had a large timber gateway for carriages and a smaller gate for pedestrians. There were timber fences to River Road and possibly along the eastern boundary as well. Below the driveway on the eastern side the land dropped away and contained caves and grottoes. By 1900 St. Vincent Welch had had an observatory built in the grounds, the telescope of which was brought out from England in 1860 to observe the transit of Venus. Below the gardens on the southern side of the house, stone walls and paths meandered through the bushland. The steps that led down to the lower garden, tennis court and swimming pool were referred to as Tarpeian Way. The grass tennis court and swimming pool were constructed on the 8 lots fronting Gore Street, purchased in 1896. The pool, constructed some time before 1910, was carved into the sandstone shelf and lined with large sandstone blocks. Two more clay tennis courts were located adjacent to River Road. In 1937 the property was bought by the Sydney Church of England Girls Grammar School (SCEGGS) for the expansion of the school. A 1938 wing was constructed for class rooms designed by the architectural firm Adam, Wright and Apperly. In 1946 the property was acquired by the Church of England Deaconess' Institute as a girls home and renamed Pallister. By the 1970s Greenwich Hospital had taken over a large part of the grounds, leaving Pallister with only three acres of land. The tennis and netball courts disappeared and by the late 1970s most of these areas had become lawn. In 1981 Pallister ceased to be occupied by the Department of Education Special School, thus ending its nearly 40-year period as a children's home. From 1981 the house became part of the Greenwich Hospital serving various functions: an Adolescent Counselling Service, followed by a Health Media and Education Centre in the 1980s. It continues to house offices for various departments of the Greenwich Hospital complex. In 2003 Hope Healthcare Pty Ltd commissioned a Conservation Management Plan for Pallister.

Both the original house and later additions are constructed of load-bearing brickwork. A two-storey verandah wraps around the house on three sides with cast iron columns and balastrate panels. the main entrance is centrally located below a gable in the eastern facade, flanked by doors and windows on either side. The main roof is slate with terra cotta hips and ridges. Later additions are generally roofed in terra cotta tiles. The house interiors are substantially intact, albeit with a number of relatively minor changes and removal of original decorative finishes.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries As at 26 May 2006, Pallister incorporated the late Victorian house known as Standish, which was built as a residence for John St Vincent Welch and his family in 1892, and is evidence of residential development and the suburbanisation of the Municipalities of Lane Cove, Willoughby and North Sydney. Standish is a rare example of a late Victorian Gentleman's residence within Greenwich. The house embodies the lifestyle and aspiration of John St Vincent Welch and his family. It is the best surviving example of a late Victorian gentleman's villa and remnant garden setting, including a tear-drop shaped carriage loop in Greenwich. It is associated with John St Vincent Welch and his family. John St Vincent Welch was a prominent businessman, who served the insurance business and the general community on Sydney in a number of ways including: Alderman to Willoughby Council, one of the first aldermen to the Borough of Lane Cove, co-founder of the Sydney Liedertafel (Later called the Apollo Club), member of the Amateur Orchestra Society, trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. The house was the childhood home of Kenyon St Vincent Welch who was the first doctor appointed to the Flying Doctor Service. The buildings has been associated with the Anglican Deaconess Institute Sydney since 1946, and with a wide range of welfare and community activities, particularly in relation to adolescent girls and based on the vision and principles established by Anna Pallister. Pallister was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Raised in the Pittsburgh area in August and September 1864, the regiment was sent to the Army of the James at Bermuda Hundred during the Siege of Petersburg. The regiment remained in camp during the Third Battle of Petersburg and instead marched into Richmond after its evacuation. After serving on provost duty in Virginia, it was mustered out in late June 1865.  History  alt= The 206th Pennsylvania was raised in the Pittsburgh area during August 1864 for a one-year term in response to President Abraham Lincoln's call for 500,000 men. It was organized under the command of Colonel Hugh J. Brady at Camp Reynolds near Pittsburgh on 8 September. All companies were recruited in Indiana County except for Company B in Jefferson and Companies E and K in Westmoreland; most of its officers and men were veterans, including Brady, who had previously served as Lieutenant Colonel of the 177th Pennsylvania Infantry, and a large number of 135th Pennsylvania Infantry veteran enlisted men. The 206th was ordered to Washington, D.C. on the day after its organization, but it was diverted at Baltimore to City Point, where it joined a provisional brigade in the XVIII Corps of the Army of the James. The regiment took positions on the Bermuda Hundred front, and on 4 October was placed on engineer duty. It crossed to the north bank of the James on that day and worked to construct a fort one mile north of Dutch Gap under Confederate fire, losing one man killed and several wounded. The regiment was commended by army commander Benjamin Butler for its skill and the fort was named Fort Brady in recognition. The 206th was transferred to the X Corps on 26 October and joined the 3rd Brigade of its 1st Division, along with the 11th Maine, 24th Massachusetts, 10th Connecticut, and 100th New York. Shortly afterwards, it went into winter quarters north of Fort Harrison, and continued training while on normal camp duties for the next several months. The regiment became part of the 1st Division of XXIV Corps on 3 December when X Corps was split. On 27 March, when the Army of the James began its movement to attack positions for the Petersburg breakthrough, the 206th was detached from the brigade and attached to the 3rd Division, remaining in camp on provost duty in spite of protests from the regiment. Brady was ordered to organize the convalescents of the 1st Division in preparation for movement. After the breakthrough, the 206th was among the first units to march into Richmond unopposed on 3 April, to discover that the Confederate forces had evacuated. Between 29 March and 9 April, the regiment suffered casualties of seven wounded and one officer and one man captured or missing, for a total of nine. The regiment was subordinated to the Military Governor of Richmond for provost duty in the city on 22 April. It briefly returned to the 1st Brigade a month later; Brady took command of the latter as the senior officer. The regiment was detached for provost duty in Lynchburg, where it arrived on 30 May, for two weeks, then returned to the brigade at Richmond. The 206th was mustered out of Federal service on 26 June; its men returned to Pittsburgh and disbanded on 21 July.

She was a talented artist who painted over 1,400 watercolor botanical illustrations, and published a catalogue of plants of the Principality of Orange-Nassau in 1777. She was also the first woman to name a fungal taxon.  Early life  D√∂rrien was the daughter of Pastor Johann Jonas D√∂rrien and Lucia Catharina (n√©e Schrader), and was the second of their four children.

Career  D√∂rrien left Hildesheim and started working as a governess in Dillenburg for her childhood friend Sophie Anna Blandina (n√©e von Alers) in 1746, when she was 30. D√∂rrien initially painted for pleasure, but was encouraged by Sophie's husband, Anton Ulrich von Erath, to create an illustrated flora of the principality of Orange-Nassau.

It was designed by Edmund Blacket and built during 1878 by John and James Eaton. It is also known as Northwood House & Cottage. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Northwood House was built in 1878 for Mrs Jane Davy. It was designed by the architect Edmund Blacket and built by the brothers, John and James Eaton. In 1874 Mrs Davy purchased of land (later adding another 11 acres) on the peninsula into the Lane Cove River that is now the suburb of Northwood. The suburb takes its name from Northwood House. The home had its private wharf in Gore Bay and later a ferry wharf was built at Northwood Point for the use of the family and later the community. Mrs Davy donated three acres of land at Northwood Point to Lane Cove Council for a park. Mrs Davy was a member of the well-known Dawson family of Neutral Bay. She played an important role in the life of Lane Cove. Her son William nominated as an Alderman on Lane Cove Council and her son-in-law Joseph James Neave for whom she built adjoining \\"Burdoe\\" was a prominent Quaker. Joseph James Neave interceded with the author Tolstoi and the Tasr of Russia in 1899 to allow members of the persecuted Dukhobor sect to be transferred from Russia to Canada. After Mrs Davy's death in 1903 the home and estate (divided in 48 block) were put on the market. It was purchased by Mr. Abdul Wade, probably an Afghani and a property owner from Bourke, who used Northwood House as a depot for his camels. Mr Wade lost the home in a poker game. By 1919 the shingle roof had been replaced with tiles and the present two-storey stucco and shingle verandah added. A number of prominent families have owned Northwood House since then. During World War II it was used by the owners as a school for mentally handicapped children. On 10 August 1984 an Interim Conservation Order was placed over Northwood House as it was proposed to subdivide part of the grounds and involved demolition of the stables. In view of its heritage significance and to ensure future sympathetic development a Permanent Conservation Order was gazetted over Northwood House on 1 August 1986. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  Fence and entrance gates Northwood House is a two storied residence, constructed of solid sandstone with a tiled roof.

Dragutin Iliƒá, playwright who, with Matija Ban and Djordje Maletiƒá, dominated the Serbian stage in the late 19th century. As far back as the end of the 18th century, science fiction elements can be found in Serbian literature, but its modern period foundation is considered to commence with \\"Posle milijon godina\\" (After Million of Years), written by Dragutin Iliƒá in 1889, which is also considered the first science fiction theatrical play in modern Serbian literature.

Biography Dragutin Iliƒá is the son of Jovan Iliƒá, and brother of the poet Vojislav Iliƒá, his younger sibling. Dragutin's best works, however, were his plays and novels. Educated to be a lawyer, but was drawn towards journalism and literary pursuits, particularly the theatre. He worked as an editor and civil servant. Though Dragutin wrote his first play in the mid-1870s, it was not till a few years after the Serbian-Ottoman War (1876-78) that he decided to offer a play to the National Theatre in Belgrade. The first play he gave to the theatre was a drama called Vuka≈°in in 1881. The play was produced the following year with a resounding success. Dragutin followed up with another 12 plays up until 1906, all successfully performed with rave reviews. The tradition of patriotic theatre with music extended through the century, culminating in one aspect of the work of Slovene-born composer Davorin Jenko at the National Theatre in Belgrade. These were sung plays, but with Vraƒçara (Sorceress) of 1882 Jenko composed what is often regarded as the first Serbian operetta and with his music for Dragutin Iliƒá's Pribislav i Bozana (1894) he came close to a full- blown opera. Also, in Pribislav i Bozana by Dragutin we find stylizations of folk motives appropriate to the very popular kind of Serbian singspiel such as Djido (The Village Playboy) by Janko Veselinviƒá. Dragutin is said to have approached the singspiel style of the German composer Carl Maria von Weber. His plays are intensely Serbian and knowledge of the times in which they are set is essential for a proper understanding of them. It was critic Jovan Skerliƒá's lack of understanding the man himself, rather than the plays and novels he wrote, which was responsible for omitting Dragutin Iliƒá's name from among the premier writers and poets in his Istorija nove srpske knji≈æevnosti (History of Modern Serbian Literature). Unlike his younger brother Vojislav, Dragutin did not consider himself dedicated to poetry only; and most of his early work was written for some immediate, nonliterary purpose. That Dragutin was dedicated to literature, at least to literature in its broadest sense, is borne out of his opus and the fact that he was striving for the beauty of expression can be seen in his style. Today, however, his name stands among the noteworthy playwrights of that period such as Milorad Popoviƒá ≈†apƒçanin, Milo≈° Cvetiƒá (1845-1905), Branislav Nu≈°iƒá, Laza Kostiƒá, ƒêura Jak≈°iƒá, and Janko Veselinoviƒá, people who constituted most of the intellectual and literary core of the National Theatre in Belgrade of the late nineteenth century. At that time, Belgrade was seething with social and political unrest, and Dragutin Iliƒá was drawn into the activities of various political parties and organizations. It is necessary to keep this picture of Belgrade that shaped Dragutin Iliƒá and made him the dramatist and novelist that he came to be; it alone explains his strength and his weakness and gives a clue to the many contradictions and enigmas that surround him. For political reasons Dragutin left Belgrade for Bucharest in 1888, only to return to his hometown intermittently for the next 38 years. In 1889 he settled in Zagreb, working as a journalist for \\"Srbobran\\", before returning to Serbia where he unsuccessfully sought employment. He left Belgrade for Sremski Karlovci, where he wrote articles for newspapers and periodicals such as Brankovo kolo, Bosanska vila, Zora, Nada, Zastava and Letopis Matice srpske. In 1898 he moved to Novi Sad to become the editor of \\"Zastava\\" and wrote a poem critical of Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá. In 1901 he returned to Bucharest where he started a bilingual (Russian and French) newspaper -- Pravoslavni Istok -- aimed at the Russian reading public with the purpose to have Russia's foreign policy take a kinder and closer look at the Balkans. When his paper got banned, Dragutin returned to Serbia to take up his literary work in the theatre where he left off years before. At the time Belgrade was preparing for the First Balkan War (to rid itself of the Turkish occupier altogether), intellectuals were speaking of uniting all Southern Slavs into one nation. The first to win his allegiance was the Creation of Yugoslavia idea, which he joined at the beginning of World War I. Though primarily a language movement in its infancy, it had gradually achieved a political status. Dragutin was so enthusiastic for the Yugoslav cause that he left for Odessa to enlist volunteers for a new country called Yugoslavia. Iliƒá died in Belgrade in 1926, mostly forgotten by the public. In modern Serbia, Dragutin Iliƒá's work is more respected as part of the history of theatre and drama than his literary achievements.

Early life and family  Mary Jane O'Donovan Rossa, born Mary Jane Irwin, was born in Clonakilty, County Cork on 27 January 1845. She was the daughter of Maxwell Irwin, a merchant, and a member of the Young Ireland movement. She attended boarding school, at the Sacred Heart Convent, Roscrea, and began writing poetry as a child. She married Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa on 22 August 1864. Her husband swore her brothers in to the IRB. The couple went on to have 13 children, not all of whom survived into adulthood.  Fenian activities  O'Donovan wrote poetry for the Fenian newspaper The Irish People, writing under the pseudonyms \\"Cliodhna\\" and \\"M.J.I.\\". In 1865, the newspaper was suppressed and her husband was arrested. She became the secretary of the \\"ladies committee\\" which was tasked with collecting money for the families of incarcerated Fenians, which went on to raise funds for the nearly 3000 families needing help. O'Donovan resigned from the committee in march 1867 as police suspected she was using the money to fund the IRB. She wrote to William Ewart Gladstone to lobby for her husband's release, but received no reply.  Life in America  Following the advice of her husband, O'Donovan emigrated to New York. Her fare was paid by Richard Pigott. She supported herself by public speaking, writing, and giving elocution lessons. Her only volume of poetry, Irish lyrical poems, was published in 1868 in New York. Her husband was released from prison in January 1871, and joined her in New York, where they lived for the next 20 years at 1009 Hancock Street, Brooklyn. The family moved to Staten Island after the death of their son Maxwell in 1893.  Later life  O'Donovan was a supporter of female suffrage and Clan na Gael, but also believed that female organisations, such as Cumann na mBan, should take a subservient role to their male counterparts in politics. The couple left America in November 1905 for her husband to take up a position with Cork County Council. Owing to her poor health, O'Donovan returned to America in February 1906, with her husband leaving his job to follow her. From 1910 to his death, her husband was hospitalised due to his failing health. O'Donovan accompanied his remains back to Ireland in August 1915. When back in Ireland, O'Donovan published a number of articles in the press and several poems. Having returned to America, she reported on events in Ireland for the Gaelic American. In memory of Padraig Pearse, her last poem was written days before her own death. O'Donovan died in New York on 18 August 1916.

Set in fine gardens with landscaped terraces down to the River. Has bay window and corner verandah, bearing bellcast iron roof, supported on cast iron columns with lace brackets. Main hipped roof is of slate. Windows and French doors have shutters which are not original. There is an attractive rear courtyard, walled with sandstone in the 1960s, and with its original well. The verandahs feature tessellated tiles - probably Minton pattern (bought from the Sydney Arcade which was being demolished in the 1960s). = Condition = As at 13 April 2000, the condition of the property was good. Its physical fabric is intact and largely original. Planned authentic restoration of its interior finishes and furnishings, based on a study, will enhance its integrity. = Modifications and dates = *1940sDoor cut between present kitchen and museum room (then breakfast room). *1960sGarage, laundry and courtyard wall built from sandstone transferred from the demolition of Amalfi, a Longueville mansion.

Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries As at 3 July 2012, Carisbrook, constructed in 1884 was a visually attractive and intact example of Victorian architecture, preserving many original features and furnished for public visitation as a period house museum. It is set in beautiful landscaped gardens stretching down to Burns Bay. (Heritage Branch files) Carisbrook was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. It is the earliest remaining house in the Linley Point area, being built in 1884. It is representative of the impact of transport on subdivision and development, being built, and the land south of it being subdivided, just as the Fig Tree Bridge is being constructed nearby. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. It is set in a beautifully landscaped garden stretching down to Burns Bay. Constructed of sandstone, it is visually and architecturally very worthwhile, and preserves the majority of its original features. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As a house museum it reflects changes in social life and household technology since 1884. Hosting many community functions, and visits from individuals and groups of all ages, and serving as Lane Cove's only historical museum, open regularly to the public, it is an important focus of community life. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Because it is a fine example of Victorian architecture (the only Victorian house museum open to the public in Sydney), preserving many of its original features, it holds a unique position as a case study for visits by researchers and students of Victorian architecture and interiors. It is an ideal setting for on-site courses. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It is the oldest surviving home on Linley Point, and we have been informed is the only Victorian house museum in Sydney, open to the public. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. It is representative of a middle-class Victorian family home, and through its period interpretation, depicts aspects of Victorian family life.

She spent much of her working life in Paris. Life Hannah Lynch was born in Dublin on 25 March 1859. Her father died when she was young. Her mother was married twice. Her father was a committed, non-violent Fenian. Lynch herself grew up in a very female house with her mother, Anna Theresa Calderwood, and ten sisters and half-sisters. Her stepfather was James Cantwell, also a Fenian, who ran the Star and Garter Hotel. After finishing school Lynch worked as a sub-editor for a provincial paper and as a governess in Europe. A nationalist like her father and stepfather, Lynch was an executive member of the Ladies' Land League and as a result closely associated with Fanny Parnell. She wrote extensively, producing short stories and satirical sketches, as well as Land War fiction, travel writing, translations and literary criticism. Her satirical pieces included \\"A Dublin Literary Coterie Sketched by a Non-Pretentious Observer\\" (1888) and \\"My Friend Arcanieva\\" (1895). Lynch published William O'Brien's paper United Ireland from France, once it had been suppressed in Ireland. She disagreed with Yeats on the literary merit of Emily Lawless, calling her work \\"highly polished literary stories\\". Lynch also wrote fiction on the subject of political and cultural affairs in Ireland, sometimes meeting controversy. Her first novel, Through Troubled Waters (1885), was a fictionalised version of a real-life incident in Galway in which the daughters of a prosperous landowning family were murdered to make way for the sons to inherit the land. The novel also depicted the rural clergy as complicit, by denouncing the victims from the pulpit. The newspaper United Ireland strongly criticised the novel, claiming it peddled in anti-Irish stereotypes for a British audience. Lynch responded by stating that she had intended the book for an Irish publisher and audience, and that she should not be asked ‚Äúto prove my patriotism at the expense of truth‚Äù. Lynch published across Ireland, the UK and from Paris. By 1896, Lynch had settled in Paris, having also lived in both Spain and Greece. She spoke Greek and French. Lynch then returned to lecture in Ireland and was a part of the Paris salons of the Belle Epoque as well as the Irish Literary Revival in Dublin. She was friends with the historian, biographer and literary critic \\"Arv√®de Barine\\" (Louise-C√©cile Vincens), the writers Mabel and Mary Robinson, and the medievalist Gaston Paris. Her work however did not bring significant income and Lynch was forced to apply to the Royal Literary Fund for help on multiple occasions. Eventually it had a toll on her health. She spent time in hospital in Margate in 1903. She died in Paris in 1904.

History  PERMATApintar National Gifted Center, UKM is the first gifted school in Malaysia. Established on 3 April 2009, Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, planned to have a school for Malaysian gifted students after visiting various countries' gifted schools as early as 2006. To realize her plan, a series of discussions with local and foreign experts took place to come up for a suitable program in Malaysia. The controversy programme was started nearly a decade ago after Najib Razak then took office. However the previous Barisan Nasional (BN) administration had claimed that Rosmah was not involved in Permata's day-to-day operations. A working paper of PERMATApintar was then approved by Former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Najib in 2008. National University of Malaysia was appointed to implement the program with the fund disbursed from the PERMATA Division of the Prime Minister's Department. An agreement was made in Kuala Lumpur in April 2009 with the Johns Hopkins University - Center for Talented Youth to help kick start the program. In January 2010, National University of Malaysia gave a land located at Bukit Puteri to the government to build the PERMATApintar complex.

Exponents of the anti- cult movement in Russia and Ukraine have criticized his association as a cult.  Biography  Oleg V. Maltsev was born in Odessa, Ukraine, on April 17, 1975, into a Jewish family who moved to Sevastopol in the same year.Introvigne (2018b), p. 14. In 2014, Maltsev and collaborators established several organizations including the \\"Memory Institute\\", with the \\"Applied Science Association\\" serving as an umbrella organization. In 2016, Maltsev's group was accused of being a 'cult' by Alexander Dvorkin, the vice-president of European Federation of Centres of Research and Information on Sectarianism. In this regard, the activities of Oleg Maltsev were analyzed by the Italian sociologist of religions Massimo Introvigne, his colleagues from CESNUR and the Belgian human rights organization Human Rights Without Frontiers. They concluded that his organization was not a new religious movement, but a group of followers of the Hungarian psychoanalyst L√©opold Szondi and researchers of European mysticism. Although Maltsev deny that his teachings are part of \\"esotericism\\", professor of sociology PierLuigi Zoccatelli concluded that they are included in the larger notion of the \\"esoteric paradigm\\". In 2017, Maltsev authored a book entitled Non-compromised Pendulum on boxing trainer Cus DAmato and his methods. Maltsev's co-author was Tom Patti, a student of DAmato. The work received positive reviews in Sports Illustrated and The Ring. In 2018, Maltsev was awarded a PhD in Psychological Sciences at Odessa State University.Introvigne (2018b), pp. 15-16. Maltsev cites Hungarian psychologist Leopold Szondi as \\"one of the pillars\\" of his world view, and he practices a variant of Szondi's Fate Analysis.Introvigne (2018a).Di Marzio (2018), p. 40. In August 2019, Oleg Maltsev, together with two other Ukrainian scientists, presented a joint monograph on the disclosure of Serial killings. Oleg Maltsev in this work did the bulk devoted to the description of the psycho-portrait of a serial killer. In 2019, Maltsev was elected chairman of the Odessa Photographic Society.

Biology This species lives in the soil during winter and goes out from February to June. Females lay their eggs (from 40 to 50) in holes dug thanks to their rostrum in beetroot or Chenopodium stems. The eclosion of these eggs from 4 to 15 days later gives birth to larvae which dig tunnels in petioles and stems.

They were contesting the throne of Numidia after the death of King Micipsa. Jugurtha invaded Adherbal's territory, defeated him and besieged him in his capital Cirta. Two Roman deputations attempted to negotiate a settlement, but Jugurtha ignored them. When the city surrendered he tortured Arherbal to death and executed all who had bourne arms against him, including numerous Romans. This last action was to spark the outbreak of the Jugurthine War between Rome and Numidia. Background Numidia, in green, with the position of Cirta shown Numidia was a kingdom located in North Africa (roughly corresponding to northern modern day Algeria) adjacent to what had been Rome's arch enemy, Carthage. King Masinissa, who was a steadfast ally of Rome in the Third Punic War, died in 149, and was succeeded by his son Micipsa, who ruled from 149 to 118 BC. At the time of his death Micipsa had three potential heirs, his two sons, Adherbal and Hiempsal I, and an illegitimate nephew, Jugurtha. Jugurtha had fought under Scipio Aemilianus at the siege of Numantia, where, through friendship with Roman aristocrats, he had formed an acquaintance with Roman manners and military tactics. Micipsa, worried that at his death Jugurtha would usurp the kingdom from his own somewhat less able sons, adopted him, and bequeathed the kingship jointly to his two sons and Jugurtha. After Micipsa's death the three kings fell out, and ultimately agreed between themselves to divide their inheritance into three separate kingdoms. When they were unable to agree on the terms of the division Jugurtha declared open war on his cousins. Hiempsal, the younger and braver of the brothers, was assassinated by Jugurtha's agents. Jugurtha gathered an army and marched against Adherbal, who fled to Rome. There he appealed to the Roman Senate for arbitration. Rome dispatched a commission, led by the ex-Consul Lucius Opimius, to deal with the matter, but the senators who comprised it were bribed by Jugurtha into acquitting him of his crime, and equally dividing the disputed kingdom between him and Adherbal. Jugurtha further bribed the commission to grant him the more prosperous western half. In 116, still dissatisfied, Jugurtha attempted to provoke his rival into war by performing repeated cavalry harassments on the frontier. But Adherbal failed to respond and prudently sent a message to Rome to again protest against Jugurtha's conduct. The Senate failed to make any effectual response, and in 113 Jugurtha finally decided to invade his cousin's kingdom in force. Adherbal met him with his scanty forces near Rusicade, and was routed. He retreated with the survivors to his capital, Cirta. Siege Cirta was strongly situated on a rising hill with the river Ampsaga looping around its base. The city had a sizable Roman minority, mostly merchants of some standing and their families; these joined the rest of the population in manning the walls and defending the city. Cirta was able to hold out for a long time against the besieging army. Adherbal, before falling back to the town, had sent messengers to Rome to notify the Senate of Jugurtha's invasion. A commission of ten inexperienced Romans was despatched to negotiate with Jugurtha. Jugurtha dismissed them, claiming that Adherbal had attempted to poison him, and they returned to Rome without result. The Senate sent a more senior deputation headed by Marcus Scaurus, one of the most prestigious and influential Roman politicians, to threaten Jugurtha into submission. After a furious but unsuccessful attempt to carry the walls of Cirta before this group's arrival, Jugurtha went to receive the deputation at Utica. A lengthy but inconclusive negotiation ensued, in which Jugurtha went to great lengths to protract the discussions by vague protestations, without actually making any concessions. Scaurus' commission returned to Rome without achieving anything. At this Adherbal, who had run out of provisions, decided to capitulate. The Romans within the walls acquiesced, counting on their immunity as Roman citizens. Adherbal was put to death by slow torture, and every man who had joined in the city's defense, Roman or African, was executed. Aftermath The abandonment of a loyal and valuable ally, and the deaths of Roman citizens, led to outrage among the Roman population. This was compounded by the general belief that Scaurus and his retinue, as well as the previous Roman commissions to Jugurtha, had accepted bribes from the him. The Senate attempted to suppress the uproar; but Gaius Memmius, tribune-elect for the following year, declared his intention of impeaching the Senators suspected of corruption. The Senate subsequently declared war, starting the Jugurthine War, 111‚Äì106 BC. In spite of initial Roman setbacks, Jugurtha was eventually defeated by the capable generals Quintus Metellus Numidicus and Gaius Marius, the last of whom captured Jugurtha and brought him to Rome to die in chains in the Tullianum.

It is located in the plains of western Banat region, near the confluence of the Begej river into the Tisa, south of the city of Zrenjanin. It is a complex system of lakes separated by embankments. Four lakes: Belo jezero, Koƒça jezero, Mika jezero and Joca jezero make up over 80% of the total water area, while the remainder consists of smaller pools for fish production. It is named after the large village of Eƒçka to the north, but smaller villages of Lukino Selo and Belo Blato lie directly on its shores. The lakes occupy the total area of around 15.42 km2, which makes them together the third-largest lake in Serbia, after two hydroelectric lakes of ƒêerdap. Fish production is performed on around , and the annual output amounts to up to 6,000 tons of fish, chiefly carp. The water area which is not used for commercial production is available for recreational fishing. Geography Map of the pond and surrounding area Eƒçka fish pond is located in western Banat region, some 10 km south of the city of Zrenjanin, and is entirely contained within its administrative territory. The lake system runs in general northeast-southwest direction, in total length of about 10 km, parallel to the regulated flow of the Begej. The maximal width is around 1 km at Belo jezero, and the total area of the lakes is 15.42 km2 (21.57 km2 according to another source). The system consists of 46 lakes and reservoirs, the four major ones being, from east to west, Belo jezero (4.59 km2), Koƒça jezero (2.59 km2), Mika jezero (1.88 km2) and Joca jezero (3.72 km2). The lakes are shallow, the deepest being Belo jezero with an average depth 1.33 m; lakes to the west morph into marshes, with Joca jezero having average depth of just 0.77 m. Village of Belo Blato is located at the southern shore of Koƒça jezero, and Lukino Selo is on the eastern shore of Belo jezero; village of Eƒçka lies further east, on the opposite side of the Begej. The main fishery building and hotel \\"Sibila\\" are located on the southern shore of Belo jezero. They are accessible from a road running on an embankment, connected with the main Zrenjanin‚ÄìBelgrade road. Entrance to the special nature reserve Carska bara, a system of wetlands which lies between the fish pond and final section of the Begej, is located across the road. History The \\"Lazarus' map\\", dated early 16th century and preserved in the National Sz√©ch√©nyi Library in Budapest, depicts the vast wetlands around the final sections of the Begej and Tami≈° rivers near their confluences into the Tisa. According to the historical records from the 16th century, fishing permits were issued for the \\"White marsh\\" (Bela moƒçvara), a wetland around the final section of the Begej river. Extensive works on regulation of the marshy area began in the 19th century, under the rule of Austria-Hungary in the area. In 1806, final section of the Begej was moved south of the marshes, into an artificially built canal with shorelines made of wattle. However, for the most part of the 19th century the canal was left neglected, but in 1900 it was revived by building new dams and locks. Fish production Company \\"Eƒçka a.d.\\" is the sole user of the fish pond. Fish production is performed on around , chiefly in smaller reservoirs separated from the main lake system. Common carp is the primary output, making up around 90% of total production, and smaller amounts of grass carp (amur), bighead carp (tolstolobik), zander (smuƒë) and wels catfish make up the remainder. Carp is cultivated up to three years of age, with individuals reaching . It is captured in late autumn and put on the markets of Serbia, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

When the cache is full, the algorithm must choose which items to discard to make room for the new ones. Due to the inherent caching capability of nodes in Information-centric networking ICN, the ICN can be viewed as a loosely connect network of caches, which has unique requirements of Caching policies. Unlike proxy servers, in Information-centric networking the cache is a network level solution. Therefore, it has rapidly changing cache states and higher request arrival rates; moreover, smaller cache sizes further impose different kind of requirements on the content eviction policies. In particular, eviction policies for Information-centric networking should be fast and lightweight. Various cache replication and eviction schemes for different Information- centric networking architectures and applications are proposed. Policies =Time aware least recently used (TLRU)= The Time aware Least Recently Used (TLRU) is a variant of LRU designed for the situation where the stored contents in cache have a valid life time. The algorithm is suitable in network cache applications, such as Information-centric networking (ICN), Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and distributed networks in general. TLRU introduces a new term: TTU (Time to Use). TTU is a time stamp of a content/page which stipulates the usability time for the content based on the locality of the content and the content publisher announcement. Owing to this locality based time stamp, TTU provides more control to the local administrator to regulate in network storage. In the TLRU algorithm, when a piece of content arrives, a cache node calculates the local TTU value based on the TTU value assigned by the content publisher. The local TTU value is calculated by using a locally defined function. Once the local TTU value is calculated the replacement of content is performed on a subset of the total content stored in cache node. The TLRU ensures that less popular and small life content should be replaced with the incoming content. =Least frequent recently used (LFRU)= The Least Frequent Recently Used (LFRU) cache replacement scheme combines the benefits of LFU and LRU schemes. LFRU is suitable for ‚Äòin network‚Äô cache applications, such as Information-centric networking (ICN), Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and distributed networks in general. In LFRU, the cache is divided into two partitions called privileged and unprivileged partitions. The privileged partition can be defined as a protected partition. If content is highly popular, it is pushed into the privileged partition. Replacement of the privileged partition is done as follows: LFRU evicts content from the unprivileged partition, pushes content from privileged partition to unprivileged partition, and finally inserts new content into the privileged partition. In the above procedure the LRU is used for the privileged partition and an approximated LFU (ALFU) scheme is used for the unprivileged partition, hence the abbreviation LFRU. The basic idea is to filter out the locally popular contents with ALFU scheme and push the popular contents to one of the privileged partition.

Design and development Reports of the first German glider contest, held at the Wasserkuppe in the late summer of 1920, generated considerable interest in Poland, leading to the First Polish Glider Contest at Czarna G√≥ra between 30 August and 13 September 1923. The contest was not a great success, limited by novice designers and pilots and a poor site, but the Karpi≈Ñski SL.1 Akar was by far the most successful entrant. The Lublin was designed by Stanis≈Çaw Cywi≈Ñski and two examples, designated Lublin I and Lublin II, were built in the Lublin works of E. Plage & T. La≈õkiewiƒáz. The only differences between the two were in their ailerons. The Lublin was an aerodynamically clean, wooden, high wing monoplane. Its one-piece wing had two spars, a trapezoidal plan and fabric covering. The fuselage had a rectangular section and in profile resembled a thick airfoil. It was covered with dural sheet forward and fabric aft and included an open, single-seat cockpit. At the rear the rudder and fin together were strongly swept back and roughly rhomboidal in shape. An all-moving tailplane was mounted on the extreme fuselage. Like most of the gliders at the contest, the Lublin had wheeled landing gear and a tailskid. The mainwheels were mounted close to the fuselage underside on a single axle carried, via rubber-cord shock absorbers, by short V-struts. Each Lublin made only one flight, both piloted by Franciszek Rutkowsk and ending in a crash. On 28 August 1923 the Lublin I managed a flight of only 10 seconds and on 6 September the Lublin II lasted 60 seconds. The latter was enough to earn the E. Plage & T.

The house is located near Wormley in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire =Wormleybury= Lady and Lord Hume were well known among leading eighteenth century botanists and horticulturalists, both in England and abroad. Between 1785 and 1825, they introduced many rare plant species into England. Most of their plants came from India and the Far East. With the help of their gardener, James Mean, the exotic plants were maintained out in the open and in specially designed and constructed glass houses. The glass houses were installed with elaborate stoves to maintain the temperature and humidity of many exotic plants and trees. Lord and Lady Holmes were very successful in establishing and propagating the plants that were entrusted to their care at Wormleybury. Lady Hume died in London on 8 August 1809. She was survived by her husband, Lord Hume, and her two daughters, watercolor painter, Amelia Long (1772-1837) and Sophia, Countess Brownlow (1787-1814).

The canal cut across Ikoyi and parts of Onikan, Lagos Island, providing a border between Lagos Island and Ikoyi. To link both communities, a bridge was built over the canal from Obalende, a settlement that was part of the newly reclaim swampland. In the 1970s, parts of the canal were sand filled to build an inner ring road around Lagos Island.

The Brazza River has its source at over 3000 meters of elevation in the Jayawijaya or Maoke Mountains of central Papua in Yahukimo Regency, and flows south to the lowland rainforests of Asmat Regency before meeting the Pulau River (or Eilanden River.), which flows southeast to the Arafura Sea.  History  The Brazza watershed is known to be the residence of the Asmat tribe, specifically the Brazza tribe, one of the Asmat sub-tribes, which is recorded to inhabit the area of Citak Mitak (Senggo) Subdistrict along this river. Asmat people live in southern Papua, around the big rivers of Aswets, Bets, Pomats, Undir, Sirets and Brazza, all of which flow to the Arafuru Sea (formerly: Irian Bay). The rivers can be navigated far inland, up to about 50 km when the tide rises. Because it was watered by many rivers, the land became very large swamps, which were not useful for agriculture and caused the Asmat people to be isolated for a long time. However, in this place they can get enough food, especially from sago trees that grow wild and abundantly everywhere, as well as game animals, such as wild boar, cassowary, cuscus, various kinds of birds, and various kinds of fish and shrimp in the river. Asmat people establish settlements and villages on the banks of the river, because the river is the most important means of transportation, and makes it easy to detect the arrival of other people who approach their village. Asmat people can actually divided into several sub-ethnic groups, including: Unisirau, Bismam, Simai, Emari-Ducur, Betch-Mbup, Kaimo, Safan, Brazza and Joerat. In the upstream of the Brazza river, to the west of the upstream of Digul River, lived the Citak Mitak people, to the east of the Asmat tribe, and to the north of the Awyu people. Their language has similarities with the Asmat language, so some scholars tend to classify them as one of the Asmat sub-tribes. Another tribe, the Korowai, also inhabits the upstream of the Brazza river in the south Jayawijaya Mountains, to the northeast of the Asmat tribe, to the west of Senggo. This area is part of the Kouh and Citak Mitak (Senggo) Districts in Merauke Regency. The boundaries of the Asmat tribe with other inland tribes such as the Kombai, Korowai, Citak Mitak and others are marked by the Brazza river and the foot of the Central Mountains. The Asmat Brazza tribe, which lives on the banks of the Brazza river at the foot of the Jayawijaya Mountains, is famous for its 'mbis' sculpture, which the 'mbis' head is uniquely made separate from the body that makes the art of this tribal craft different and highly valuable.  Modern development  Dekai, the capital of Yahukimo Regency, is a new town built since 2008 on the east bank of the Brazza river. Nop Goliat Dekai Airport is immediately southeast of the Brazza River, on the north side of Dekai. To the south of town, a river port, Longpon, at the border of Yahukimo and Asmat regencies, provides cargo service for Dekai district and villages near the Brazza river.East-Indonesia.info Papua Travel Information In the mountains, the Brazza river flows past the villages of the Kimyal people near Sela, where it is known as the Thay river.Korupun-Sela Language, cites Godschalk 1993, p.4 The Momuna people live in Sumo and Dekai districts on both sides of the Brazza river in the lowland rainforest to the south.Momuna Language, cites Silzer & Heikkinen 1984 p.53 South of the Momuna, the Asmat people, known for their wood carvings and bark paintings, live along the lower reaches of the Brazza riverThe True Exotic Colors of Indonesia (English Edition) by Martha Tilaar Puspita MarthaIndonesian New Guinea Adventure Guide: WEST PAPUA / IRIAN JAYA by David Pickell Geography The river flows in the southern area of Papua with predominantly tropical rainforest climate (designated as Af in the K√∂ppen- Geiger climate classification).

From 1993 to 2004 Borg held various teaching and research positions in Germany including acting Head of Department and Director of the Collection of Antiquities at the Archaeological Institute of Ruprecht- Karls-University. In 2004 she moved to the University of Exeter as professor of Classical Archaeology. She was Head of Classics from 2010-2015 and from 2018 onwards. Honours Borg has held a number of visiting fellowships, including the Hugh Last Fellowship at the British School at Rome (2013), the Senior Onassis Fellowship at the Waterloo Institute for Hellenic Studies (2012), and a Getty Scholarship at the Getty Research Institute (2011). Borg has been a corresponding member of the German Archaeological Institute since 2006, was elected to the Academy of Europe in 2012, and was elected as Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 2015. Borg received a Major Research Fellowship from the Leverhulme Trust in 2014. Academic work Borg's early work emphasised the cross-cultural links of Roman art, including the edited volume Paideia: The World of the Second Sophistic, which places Roman sculpture in the wider context of intellectual and literary culture. Her interest in the history and reception of Roman sculptures is evident in her contribution to the first full publication of the remarkable collection of antiquities at Castle Howard with Professor Henner von Hesberg and the late Andreas Linfert, one of the oldest collections of antiquities in Great Britain and of statues from antiquity. Borg's recent work on Roman tombs and burial customs of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, resulting in two monographs in 2013 and 2018, has been widely recognised due to Borg's meticulous and thorough treatment of the material evidence. Her conclusion that 'the open-air display of sarcophagi was much more common than is attested by preserved or documented examples or that multiple burials were frequent in sarcophagi' (Katharine Meinecke)https://www.ajaonline.org/book-review/2568 has been supported by further work on imperial funerary monuments in the Suburbium of Rome. Borg's Blackwell Companion to Roman Art provides a substantial evaluation of methodological approaches to the different media and zones of Roman art, with a range of experts in the different sub-fields highlighting critical issues and approaches.Review by Alice Landskrom, BMCR 2017.01.09 http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2017/2017-01-09.html Borg has commented that her work on funerary culture aims to bring together all available evidence and to demonstrate that customs were shared between Christians and non-Christians in the Roman world.

He was the first leader of the West Bengal unit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)), serving as State Secretary from the party's birth in 1964 until his death in 1982. He was also a member of the CPI(M)'s politburo, its supreme decision- making body. Although he personally never contested an election, Dasgupta earned a reputation as a disciplined organiser of the party and its cadres. Under his leadership, the CPI(M)-led Left Front came to power in a landslide victory in the 1977 election, and remained the dominant force in West Bengal politics for several decades following Dasgupta's death. Biography Promode Dasgupta was born in July 1910 in a Baidya family in Kaurpur village in the undivided Bengal of British India; it is now a part of Bangladesh. His father was a doctor employed in government service. Dasgupta had eight siblings, of whom one sister would become a fellow CPI(M) member. PDG says of his youth, \\"I joined the university but gave it up soon after to become an apprentice in a workshop\\". Working style and personality In a 1978 article written during the first year of the Left Front government, India Today compared the personalities and leadership styles of Chief Minister Jyoti Basu and Promode Dasgupta. It described the former as an urbane, mild-mannered statesman from a prosperous family who had attended Calcutta's top schools and studied law in Britain, where his conversion to Marxism had occurred. In contrast, India Today characterised Dasgupta as a \\"homespun Marxist\\" whose \\"life has been devoted to the single-minded aim of strengthening the CPM\\" in West Bengal. The article pointed out PDG's genius for organisation but also his reputation for being a \\"shadowy figure\\" who is \\"blunt, abrasive and retiring by nature\\".\\"'Jyoti Basu is Mr Soft and Pramode Dasgupta the Mr Hard of West Bengal CPM' \\". India Today. 15 April 1978. For Sumit Mitra, writing in the Hindustan Times, \\"it was Dasgupta who pulled the strings, and Basu was the puppet.\\"Sumit Mitra. \\"Counter-evolutionary\\". Hindustan Times. 18 January 2010. Among the managerial skills he exhibited were thorough knowledge of CPI(M) grassroots organisations in West Bengal. \\"Promode da was an excellent manager. Even as he sat all by himself in his office room at the party headquarters at Calcutta and smoked his cigar,\\" India Today quoted a party worker, \\"a well- oiled communication machinery brought to him exactly what was happening at various levels of the party so that he was rarely caught off guard.\\" This knowledge enabled him to act as a mediator, brokering truces between conflicting groups within the CPI(M) and the various parties in the Left Front.\\"Marxist leader Promode Dasgupta's death leaves a political void in CPI-M\\". India Today. 31 December 1982. In the CPI(M) politburo, PDG often took hardline stances against the national leadership, especially in their desire to seek out alliances with non-Left parties. \\"Those who are not strong enough in their own rights have to go in for such exercises\\", he quipped. He also protected the positions of his West Bengal unit from the more moderate central politburo. Upon Dasgupta's death, Basu acknowledged the difficulty of his successor's task, both as chief organiser (\\"When he (Dasgupta) was there none of us had to bother about the organisation. Now we will have to work as a collective body.\\") and as politburo representative (\\"Promode babu enjoyed a special position in the politburo and it would be too much to hope that his successors will command the same respect.\\"). On the flip side, Dasgupta is routinely cast as \\"Stalinist\\" and \\"anti-intellectual\\" by commentators.Ashis Chakrabarti. \\"Restoration drama\\".

This affected in particular the Greeks from Asia Minor and the Pontos Greeks living in the Black Sea region. Many refugees found a new home in Macedonia, and some of them reached Pieria. There they represent a large part of nowadays population. Occasionally they bought lands and founded purely Pontic villages. To maintain the cultural peculiarities of the Pontus Greeks, in 1928 the Enosi Pontion Pierias (Greek ŒàŒΩœâœÉŒ∑ Œ†ŒøŒΩœÑŒπœéŒΩ Œ†ŒπŒµœÅŒØŒ±œÇ, Association of Pontian Pierias) was founded, which was registered in 1932 officially as a club. It is thus the oldest club Pierias. Since June 1998 she has been a member of the International Council of Organizations of Folklore Festivals and Folk Arts, CIOFF.  Location  Seat of the association is the Mitropoliti Trapesountos Chrisanthou 13, 60100 Katerini, Pieria, Greece.  History  The first wave of the settlement of the Pontic Greeks in Pieria took place between 1920 and 1922. These refugees came directly from the Ottoman Empire. After 1939, another immigration from the former Soviet Union took place. Several years after the arrival of the first refugees, the association was founded. The aim of the founding members was the preservation and maintenance of the * Pontic culture * the Pontic language and * the history of the displaced In the first years after its founding, the association was the focal point for problems of all kinds. The members soon became involved in the fields of theater, folk dancing and folk music. From the beginning, so in the new environment no longer needed, pontic language was maintained within the club. The club has 740 members (as of August 2018) On boards, the historical development of the Pontic region from the time of the first settlement (around 700 BC) to the escape is shown. In terms of mythology, the journey of the Argonauts, the Amazons and Prometheus are worth mentioning. The most prominent among the philosophers of the region was Diogenes. The Pontic eagle was around 450 BC stamped on coins of the city of Sinope. Based on historical and contemporary photographs, magazines and copies of official publications, the recent history is displayed.

The dance group performs throughout Greece and in other European countries. * Pontic Music: Currently (August 2018), about 20 young musicians are taught the use of classical Pontic musical instruments. The main focus is on the lyre. * Theater: classical pontic pieces are performed in Pontic language. Performances also take place outside Pieria in other Greek cities. * Choir: The second pillar for the care of the old language. The members perform in Pieria, other cities of Greece and abroad. * Museum of Local History: The exhibits are currently (at least in August 2018) to be restored, the museum is therefore closed. * Library: The association owns both, contemporary and historical literature from Pontic writers and Pontic themes. The publication of a house magazine had to be discontinued for financial reasons and was largely substituted by social media. * Blood donation: The members are animated by an in-house blood donation organization. Through actions, people outside of the club are also called to blood donations. * Miscellaneous: A group of interested people are taught the classic weaving techniques. Some members are dedicated to painting, their works are exhibited from time to time. In addition to wood carvings and mosaics, other traditional arts and crafts are taught. Women make sure that the recipes of traditional pontian cuisine are not forgotten.  Activities  Several times a year trips to the old home on the Black Sea are organized. In addition to the former capital of Trapezounda (now Trabzon), other historically important places such as the Panagia Soumela Monastery or the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in today's Istanbul are visited.

Background Since the introduction of internment without trial of people began in August 1971 the violent conflict in Ireland known as The Troubles intensified to heights not seen in Ireland since the Irish Civil War. Along with IRA attacks against the British Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary a pattern of tit-for-tit attacks between Republicans and Loyalists began around September 1971. The first of these pub bombings happened in the Protestant Sandy Row area of Belfast on 20 September 1971 when the IRA placed a bomb outside the Bluebell Bar injuring 27 people, it was reported that none of the injuries were serious. Just over a week later on the 29 another IRA bomb exploded in the Four Step Inn bar in the Protestant Shankill Road area of Belfast, this time the bomb killed two people, Alexander Andrews (60) and Ernest Bates (38). The UVF carried out a retaliation attack a week later bombing a pub along the Catholic Falls Road in Belfast. The UVF wanted to kill Catholics but instead they killed Winifred Maxwell (45) who was a Protestant woman.Aaron Edwards - UVF: Behind The Mask pp.44 Bombing The IRA chose to bomb a Protestant pub along the Ormeau Road in Belfast. Armed IRA Volunteers entered the pub and placed a time bomb inside the pub, one of the IRA men shouted \\"you have ten seconds to get out\\", the bomb went off a few seconds later. The power of the blast brought the roof crashing down on the people inside the pub. The blast killed three people, two male/one female adults and all Protestant. Around 30 people were wounded in the blast, some of them with serious injuries. The pub was right beside Ballynafeigh RUC station, a second bomb was planted on in a drapery shop on the other side of the RUC station, in which a huge amount structural damage was done and injured more people. The people killed in the bombing were John Cochrane (67), Mary Gemmell (55) and William Jordan (31). Aftermath The pub bombings kept going on The climax to the tit-for-tat pub bombings occurred with two major bombings in the space of a week. First on 4 December 1971 the UVF carried out McGurk's Bar bombing, in which 15 people were killed; it remained the highest death toll from a single action in Belfast during the Troubles. A week later the IRA carried out a revenge attack for th McGurks bomb during the 1971 Balmoral Furniture Company bombing in which four people were killed, including two baby girls.

It contains 8-9 whorls, of which the two whorls in the protoconch are smooth, globose and blunt at the actual apex. The remainder is suturally impressed, angled, longitudinally multicostate. The ribs are smooth, crossed by obscure spiral lines on the body whorl, more particularly towards the base. The whorls are ornamented with spiral rows of white beaded gemmae just below the sutures, and again in several regularly arranged rows on the ribs, and towards the base of the body whorl. There is, in the examples seen by the author, some extent of variation in the disposition of these gemmae, and likewise in the number of ribs. The aperture is ovate. The outer lip is slightly rounded in the largest specimen, straighter in the smaller, and with the sinus shallow but well expressed. The columellar margin is straight, .

He served in the United States Marine Corps, achieving the rank of captain. McCready was the Democratic Party nominee for the United States House of Representatives from North Carolina's 9th congressional district in the 2018 election. Initially it appeared that Republican Mark Harris won narrowly. The bipartisan state election board completed an investigation into allegations of ballot fraud by Republican operatives and declined to certify the election and called for a special election to fill the seat. McCready lost the special election to Dan Bishop on September 10, 2019.  Early life and education  McCready is from Charlotte, North Carolina, and graduated from Myers Park High School in the Charlotte- Mecklenburg Schools system. He earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Duke University in 2005. He then served as a captain in the United States Marine Corps and was deployed to Iraq in 2007 and 2008, where he led two platoons. Following his military service, he returned to university for graduate work, earning a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Harvard Business School. Career After earning his MBA in 2011, McCready worked for a year as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company. He left the company in 2013 to cofound Double Time Capital, a solar-focused clean energy fund, with partner Rye Barcott. As of February 2017, \\"Double Time has financed 36 solar energy projects, which collectively produce roughly 10% of North Carolina's solar power and power around 30,000 homes in the state.\\" At that time, North Carolina was the second ranked state in the United States based on the cumulative amount of solar electric capacity installed. In 2014, McCready founded This Land, an online store for American crafts that highlighted the work of skilled craftspeople from economically depressed areas who otherwise do not have the means to market their products to broad audiences. In 2017, McCready announced that he would be closing the site in order to focus on his campaign for US House of Representatives. 2018 U.S. House of Representatives election In May 2017, McCready announced his candidacy for the United States House of Representatives in . On May 8, 2018, McCready easily won the Democratic Party primary election while former pastor Mark Harris unseated incumbent representative Robert Pittenger in the Republican primary. The New York Times described the race between Harris and McCready as a \\"top-tier contest\\". A CBS News story called the race \\"one of the most competitive\\". On election day, unofficial vote tallies showed Harris defeating McCready by 905 votes, but on November 27, 2018, the North Carolina State Board of Elections and Ethics Reform declined to certify the election results, citing voting irregularities involving absentee ballots in the eastern part of the district. The irregularities became the subject of a criminal investigation into an alleged ballot harvesting scheme to elect the Republican Harris. It was orchestrated by Republican political operative McCrae Dowless in Bladen and Robeson Counties. The Associated Press subsequently retracted calling the race, pending the ultimate decision of the state board of elections. On November 30, the election board of the district decided to hear evidence about \\"claims of numerous irregularities and concerted fraudulent activities\\" at a meeting to be held by December 21, which was subsequently delayed to January 10, 2019, after the new Congress was scheduled to be seated. McCready withdrew his earlier submitted concession on December 6. In February 2019, the bipartisan election board unanimously determined they would not certify the results because of ballot fraud by Republican operatives. They called for a special election to be held. The state legislature passed a law requiring new party primaries. 2019 U.S. House of Representatives special election The election board called a special election to be held for this congressional seat. A newly passed law by the North Carolina General Assembly requires such a do-over to include the holding of new preceding primaries for the parties. McCready filed to run in the special election. McCready's major party opposition was Republican State Senator Dan Bishop. The election was held on September 10. During the election, President Donald Trump claimed that McCready \\"wants to take away your guns\\", \\"raise your taxes\\", \\"likes open borders\\", and \\"really admires socialism.\\" CNN described Trump's claims as comprehensively inaccurate, as McCready advocates for tax cuts for the middle class, does not advocate for taking guns away and supports physical barriers on the border. On September 10, 2019, Bishop won the 2019 special election to Congress with 50.7% of the vote to McCready's 48.7%.Live results: North Carolina elections, Politico, September 10, 2019.

Hedekin was commissioned into the 3rd Cavalry Regiment. He did frontier duty from his commissioning in 1888 to 1895. He went on detached service with the Intercontinental Railway Commission from March 1891 to May 1892, something which took him through Central America. Hedekin served along the border with Mexico during the Garza Revolution. After serving at the Jefferson Barracks Military Post for three years, he was stationed at Fort Ethan Allen, Fort Sheridan, and Fort Myer. Hedekin was sent to the Philippines, serving there for two years and returning in 1902. He then was sent to Fort Apache, Arizona. He served again in the Philippines from 1906 to 1908 at Fort Stotsenburg. After returning, Hedekin's regiment was stationed at Fort Sam Houston and Fort Clark, Texas.

History  = Organization = The 202nd Pennsylvania was raised in the Harrisburg area and the Coal Region beginning in early August 1864 for a one-year term in response to President Abraham Lincoln's call for 500,000 men. It was organized under the command of Colonel Charles Albright, a lawyer and former colonel of the 132nd Pennsylvania, at Camp Curtin near Harrisburg on 3 September. The companies were recruited as follows: A in Carbon County, B in Juniata County, C in Adams County, D in Northumberland and Cumberland Counties, E in Lehigh County, F in Northampton County, G and H in Cumberland County, I in Union County, and K in Huntingdon County. Although some of its officers and men were veterans, most had little military experience. = Camp Couch and Manassas Gap Railroad = Rail bridge with train on the Orange and Alexandria, guarded by the regiment The regiment was sent to Camp Couch near Chambersburg in the Department of the Susquehanna for training on 10 September, and began an exercise march of three days on 23 September. While the regiment was at Camp Couch, Albright was sent to Columbia County to collect witnesses against arrested draft evaders who participated in the Fishing Creek Confederacy; he was absent from the regiment for several weeks. The regiment was sent via Washington, D.C. to Alexandria on 29 September, and after its arrival took positions guarding the Manassas Gap Railroad from Thoroughfare Gap to Rectortown, part of the District of Alexandria in XXII Corps. The vital Manassas Gap Railroad transported supplies to the Army of the Shenandoah, and as a result was frequently attacked by Confederate partisan rangers led by John Mosby. The regiment fought in skirmishes against the Mosby men at Salem on 8 and 16 October, suffering several casualties although inflicting losses on and driving off the Confederate forces. A train was derailed while moving at full speed by the guerrillas on 10 October, killing four to five and severely wounding an estimated twenty, after which they fired upon the survivors. In response, Albright ordered every building within a mile burned, and forced Confederate sympathizers to accompany each train, preventing further attacks. = Alexandria railroad guard duty = Wood choppers with huts on the Orange and Alexandria, escorted by the regiment After the Union victory in the Shenandoah at Cedar Creek, the railroad was no longer necessary, and the regiment helped remove the ties and rails. Following the completion of the rail destruction, the 202nd returned to Alexandria, guarding the Orange and Alexandria Railroad from Bull Run to Alexandria, headquartered at Fairfax Station. There, it became part of the 1st Separate Brigade of XXII Corps. The soldiers of the regiment escorted woodmen felling timber for the construction of four large fortifications near Fairfax Station and details transporting timber for the needs of the army. In a New Year's greeting for 1865 sent to the regiment by brigade commander General William Gamble, he complimented the brigade, writing \\"You have a good regiment, and I am glad to know the right kind of a Colonel is at the head of it.\\" = Coal Region service = After the end of the war, in late May, the 202nd was relocated to Philadelphia and was sent to the Coal Region to suppress a strike by miners of the New York and Schuylkill Coal Company. It arrived in the coal center of Mauch Chunk on 29 May. The regimental headquarters was located at Tamaqua and it was divided into detachments in the region, whose District of Lehigh (part of the Department of Pennsylvania) was placed under the command of Albright. The coal mine operators helped determine detachment locations, including one sent to Forestville on 24 June. Regular patrols between Forestville and the mines at Swatara, New Mines, and Heckscherville by the 202nd Pennsylvania intimidated the strikers into reducing their demands, and eventually ended the strike entirely. Company A moved to Pittsburgh in early July, after which the regiment concentrated at Harrisburg near the end of the month, before it was mustered out on 3 August. During its service, the regiment suffered a total of 36 deaths: three enlisted men killed and 33 died of disease.

U. Khan, , was a three-star rank admiral in the Pakistan Navy, and later a bureaucrat who played a crucial role in procuring and technology transfer of the air- independent propulsion-based Agosta 90Bravo class submarine from France in 1994‚Äì97. Biography Abaidullah Khan was born in 1940 in India, now part of India and Pakistan, and was commissioned in the Navy in 1958 as Midshipman with S/No. PN. 775 in the Executive Branch. He was of the Kashmiri Pathan descent who lost both of his parents at the age of nine during the Indian partition and the first war with India in 1947, and was cared in the foster home. He later joined the Submarine Command and was trained in PNS Hangor in France in 1966-69. In 1971, Lt-Cdr. A.U. Khan was serving as the second-in- command of PNS Hangor, when it was deployed in Arabian sea, serving on the western front of the third war with India in 1971. Together with Lt. Fasih Bokhari, Lt-Cdr. Khan was instrumental in the control room to identify the exact coordinates and positions of Indian warships that ultimately sank INS Khurki under the command of Capt. M.N. Mulla. After the war, Lt-Cdr. Khan was honored with the gallantry award and was directed to attend the course on War studies at the Islamabad, eventually gaining MSc in war studies in 1980. In 1980s, Cdre. A.U. Khan commanded the Squadron as its officer in tactical command. Cdre. Khan was later attached as a Naval attache' to the Royal Navy at the High Commission of Pakistan in London in the United Kingdom. In 1993-94, Rear-Admiral A.U. Khan was promoted as a fleet commander, Commander Pakistan Fleet, where he was instrumental in providing the strong advocacy for acquiring the whole squadron of the Type-21 frigates from the Royal Navy, attending the ceremony with British Vice Admiral Roy Newman, the Flag Officer Plymouth, who handed over the Ambuscade that was designated as Tariq as the lead ship. In 1994, R-Adm. Khan took over the command of the Submarine Command and was posted as the DCNS (Operations) at the Navy NHQ. In 1994, Adm. Saeed Mohammad Khan selected R-Adm. Khan as the head of the second team that visited France while the first team under R-Adm. Javed Iftikhar visited United Kingdom to acquire the imported submarines. It was reported in media that R-Adm A.U. Khan provided his strong lobbying and advocacy for acquiring the AIP technology from France through the technology transfer rather than acquiring the Upholder from the United Kingdom. R-Adm. Khan who was trained in French submarine had played a pivotal role in convincing the government of acquiring the AIP technology from France on a long term strategic view, and this extremely controversial contact was eventually signed in 1994 with France despite Adm. Saeed Mohammad Khan's urgings. In 1995, Vice-Admiral Khan was elevated as Vice Chief of Naval Staff, and was taken as secondment by the Benazir administration as a chairman of the National Shipping Corporation (PNSC) in 1996, which he served through service extension until 2000 when he retired from his 42 year long military service. In 2001‚Äì02, V-Adm. A.U. Khan was placed in Exit Control List by the Ministry of Interior due to his leading role in negotiating the deal to procure the technology of the Agosta‚Äì90Bravo class submarines, though his name was immediately cleared out by the government, citing mistakes.

She published several works on fungi from 1879 to 1905 with Elisa Caroline Bommer, focusing primarily on Belgium.  Biography  =Youth and marriage= Mareitta was born on 20 March 1850 to Joseph Hannon, a professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at Brussels University. Her father started teaching her about plants when she was young, although the rest of her education is not known. Her knowledge of mycology was self-taught. In 1871 she married Ernest Rousseau, a friend of her fathers and also a professor at the university. They had at least one child, Ernest Rousseau, who was the first president of Les Naturalistes Belges. =Botanical career= In 1873 she met Elisa Caroline Bommer, who was also interested in botany. Marietta said of Elisa: \\"The conformity of our tastes, the similarity of certain aspects of our characters, formed the basis of a complete agreement and a collaboration whose activity could never be slowed down.\\" Bommer's husband Jean-Edouard Bommer suggested the two friends study the local fungi. The two published a series of works in the Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Royale de Botanique de Belgique from 1879. Together they published a paper on Costa Rican fungi focused on with material collected from 1887 by Henri Fran√ßois Pittier, from which they discovered several new species. They also produced a report in 1905 on the fungi of Antarctica collected by the 1897‚Äì99 Belgian expedition led by Adrien de Gerlache de Gomery. Beginning in 1908, Marietta's main focus was on curating the mushroom collection at the Jardin Botanique in Brussels. There, she also put together public exhibits of mushrooms and answered questions about fungi. After Elisa Bommer died in 1910, Marietta was not longer involved in active collecting, but she still led naturalist excursions in Brussels and the surrounding countryside. In 1924 she received the honor of Knight of the Order of Leopold. She was friends with the artist James Ensor with whom she corresponded, and she appeared occasionally as the subject of his paintings and sketches. The genus of Roussoella was named after her by Italian mycologist Pier Andrea Saccardo. The genus Roussoellopsis was also named after her. Her herbarium and types are in the BR Herbarium Catalogue, located at the Meise Botanic Garden. Her other materials can be found at the Plant Pathology Herbarium at Cornell University and the US National Fungus Collection.

Opening with students attending grades three and four, the school will be fully operational by 2022, eventually teaching grades one through eight. The school deploys a STEM-based curriculum. \\"The Family Resource Center\\" and the school's \\"family plan\\" are aimed at the students' families to ensure a stable learning experience at home. Deviating from traditional timetables, school days last from 8 to 5. Summer vacation is shortened significantly and shorter breaks are scattered throughout the year instead. In April 2020, a documentary series titled I Promise, detailing the school's first year of operations, was released on the streaming service Quibi. In the series, students and teachers share their personal stories and struggles, as well as their thoughts on the institution so far.  Background  In 2011, head of the foundation and professional basketball player LeBron James was researching the high school dropout rate of his hometown Akron and decided upon review to create the \\"I PROMISE\\" initiative, focused on supporting the youth in his childhood community. In November 2017, the Foundation expressed to the Akron school board their desire to create a school that aims to assist disadvantaged children with their studies. The plans were approved later that month and subsequent development of the school was initiated. James, having grown up in Akron, struggled as a student due to unstable conditions at home. His mother was unsuccessful in finding a permanent job, forcing the family to move multiple times. During this time, James was absent for 83 days in fourth grade, resulting in a substantial lack of education. His upbringing served as a motivation to provide future generations of children with similar backgrounds with special support and care. \\"I know these kids basically more than they know themselves. I've walked the same streets, I've rode the same bikes on the streets they ride on, I went through the same emotions, the good, the bad, the adversity. [...] Everything they're going through as kids I know and for me to be in a position where I have the resources, the finances, the people, the structure, and the city around me, why not?\\", he stated in a video released on Twitter. James considers the school's founding as the most important professional accomplishment of his life. The LeBron James Family Foundation is funding additional services for the children and families attending IPS. Some of these services include uniforms, food for families, career placement services, bikes and helmets for each student, transportation for qualified individuals, and GEDs and job placement services for parents according to Akron School District spokesman Mark Williamson. Free tuition to the University of Akron for every graduating student is covered under the pre-existing Akron I Promise Network Scholarship, which was developed between the University of Akron, the LeBron James Family Foundation, and JPMorgan Chase in 2015. To qualify, Akron public school students must graduate high school with a 3.0 grade point average. Additionally, the University of Akron provides eligible Akron Public School graduates full tuition under the separate Innovation Generation Scholarship. The Foundation has contributed an estimated $2 million in start up costs, though the number will change annually based on community needs. Students are selected based on test scores and other metrics and criteria, then placed in a lottery system. Before the opening of IPS, the I Promise program had been in Akron elementary schools for more than 10 years. There are 32 elementary schools in the Akron Public School system and kids from all those schools will now be in one location rather than spread across all of them. Prior to 2018, the IPS building had housed students in the school system that were displaced by schools which were being rebuilt. The Akron School District bears more than half of the costs ‚Äì presumably around 75 percent ‚Äì once it is fully running. I Promise will eventually cost about $8 million a year to run out of the district's regular budget, covered mostly by shifting students, teachers, and money from other schools, the district says.  Student body  The school is divided into \\"I Promise Elementary\\" and \\"I Promise Secondary\\", respectively teaching students from grade one to four up to grade eight. As of the first day of school on July 30, 2018, 240 students are attending grades three and four. The school is set to feature grades one and two by the following year and eventually all grades by 2022. The school is housed in the former Akron Public Schools' administration building and remains part of the Akron School District. Teachers are still on the district's payroll and curriculum is developed according to public school requirements. After tests administered by the Northwest Evaluation Association, The New York Times reported that roughly 90% of its 240 inaugural students either met or exceeded their expected learning goals in both math and reading, making the school the district's most successful. Initially scoring in the lowest one-percentile in both fields, third and fourth graders respectively rose to the ninth and 16th percentile in reading, and to the 18th and 30th percentile in math. By the end of the school year, the school proved to be among the fastest growing performance-wise nationwide.  Criticism  While the school has garnered overwhelming support for its general concept, certain aspects have been criticized. Annual costs of the school reportedly amount to $8 million, which are by some perceived to be a burden on taxpayers living in the comparatively low-income school district. Parents who meet the criteria to enroll their children at the school but failed to do so due to the school's lottery system are especially frustrated at the tax increase. Its untraditional approach has led to confusion surrounding the actual type of school of I Promise School. Many observers have mistaken the school for a charter school, a type of school that has been widely criticized, based on the school's unique programs, way of student selection, and extended year, all of which qualities that differ from the vast majority of public schools in the United States.

America Is Hard to See is an Off-Broadway documentary play with eighteen \\"musical moments\\" sung by the cast members, either a capella or accompanying themselves on a piano, two acoustic guitars, and a banjo. It played at the Here Arts Center in New York from January 30 through February 24, 2018. It runs for 90 minutes, with no intermission. Miracle Village The play is set in Miracle Village, a small community of sex offenders, located in the middle of sugar cane fields near rural Pahokee, Florida. The isolated community, which though small is the largest such community in the United States, formerly housed sugar cane workers, now replaced by machines. It was chosen because of its isolation, because laws in Florida, which takes pride in being the harshest state for sex offenders, restrict, sometimes severely, where they can live. (See Julia Tuttle Causeway sex offender colony.) There are six actors; all play more than one character. All are based on real people, although some characters are composites, or those who deal with them. Sometimes they address the audience directly. It is a \\"meta-textual experiment in which the audience is as much a part of the play as the actors and set. ...The plot has a way of entangling us into a world we would much rather keep at a safe distance, while simultaneously laying bare our perverse cultural appetite for the spectacle of criminality.\\" Major characters * The female lead is Patti, based on the real Patti Aupperlee, at the time Pastor of the First United Methodist Church of Pahokee, who attended a service in Miracle Village's tiny chapel and was moved by the music. * The leading male character is Chad, based on real-life Chad Stoffel, \\"a former choir director who 'flunked out of gay rehab' after an inappropriate relationship with a male student\\". * A young couple, new arrival Chris and Lexi, Patti's college-age daughter * An older couple named Harry and Margaret. * Elder statesman Thomas * An unnamed therapist \\"The audience first meets them under friendly circumstances. Later, they begin to hear their darker stories within the format of a group therapy session,\\" and the therapist warns that the characters may not be telling their tales truthfully. Relationship with Pahokee The play is not \\"solely about the sex offenders, but also about the nearby community of Pahokee that had to adjust to a new set of neighbors.\\" In a review, the New York Times called it \\"an Our Town with sex offenders\\". Similar to Our Town, which is mentioned in the program notes, it is performed with minimal set and costumes. Before the play begins, audience members are invited to walk on what set there is: a canvas map covering the floor, showing the streets and houses of Miracle Village. The script is by Travis Russ, who is also the director. The title of the play is a line from a poem of Robert Frost. (For the text of the poem, see ) Religion Religion plays a major role. The central question is whether God's mercy and grace require us to forgive anyone repentant, or if there are crimes which can never be forgiven. According to Russ, \\"It became a play about humanity, and the flaws of humanity, and it became about faith and forgiveness and the limits of compassion.\\" \\"In a show with strong religious themes, salvation comes in the form of Pastor Patti (Amy Gaither Hayes), a local Methodist minister challenged by the existence of these pariahs and what it would mean to welcome them. No pious preacher, Pastor Patti, who has her own dark secret, is just trying to live her faith as she deals with these newcomers and the rest of her congregation.\\" \\"The open-minded Patti...is able to unite the village residents and the neighboring churchgoers through a shared appreciation for religion and worship music.\\" Music According to Russ, \\"Music plays a huge role in this production. The lyrics help advance the narrative and humanize the characters. It softens the storyline. Music gives the audience the ability to look directly into a character‚Äôs soul and hear their truth.\\" Patti Aupperlee (not the play's character): \\"I was invited to attend a worship service in the chapel at Miracle Village. When I arrived with my family, I was astonished by the beautiful music that was being provided by the worship director [Stoffel]. It was like he was channeling music directly from God. It wasn‚Äôt at all like a performance; it was like a pure worship experience.\\" Reflecting this, Everyone in the cast either sings or plays an instrument. Every line of every song is taken from the autobiographical statements by residents about their sex crimes, some of which have been published, Methodist hymns, or sermons of Methodist minister Auperlee, who welcomed them, not without misgivings, into her church. Music and lyrics are by Priscilla Holbrook with the exception of the arrangement of the first hymn, the classic It Is Well with My Soul, by Chad Stoffel. Reviews =The New Yorker= \\"Dodging prurience and judgment, the piece, dotted with brief songs by Priscilla Holbrook, is a deceptively gentle look at redemption, faith (a local pastor emerges as a charismatic character), and what makes a community. Discomfort slowly seeps in as you find yourself sympathizing with some of the men, just as you remember that these seemingly nice guys were described as proficient liars. Under its plain exterior‚Äîthe stage is nearly bare, the tone willfully low-key‚Äîthe play is a heartbreaking, complicated portrait of people adrift.\\" =Gay & Lesbian Review= \\"The absent narrator of America is Hard to See fills in as the public‚Äôs moral compass, one exposed as glaringly bankrupt.... Is this drama or investigative journalism, entertainment or 'fake news'? And how can anyone tell the difference? The audience cannot walk away from this piece without feeling incredibly uncomfortable and morally compromised.\\" =Theatermania= \\"We leave not with the pleasantly dry feeling of having our minds made up, but of being awash in doubt: Should justice be more about punishment or reform? Can we call ourselves a free country when people who have served their time are marked forever with a scarlet letter? Are there crimes which are so abhorrent that reform is impossible?... Hands down, the bravest show currently playing in New York\\". =New York Times= \\"America Is Hard to See... arrives at an awkward time to ask for sympathy for these men: a moment when the culture is talking avidly about sexual predation and the damage it leaves behind. But this play, an investigation of transgression, redemption and the limits of compassion, takes a hard, uncomfortable look at forgiveness and what it means to put it into action.... The room was so pin-drop quiet that you could hear the electric hum of the lights\\". The Making of America is Hard to See =Fieldwork in Pahokee= Travis Russ said that informing his decision to research communities of sex offenders as a topic was the short story \\"Hands\\" by Sherwood Anderson. \\"It's very much about the gray areas of this man who's attracted to younger men.\\". It's one of Life Jacket's goals to tell stories about people \\"on the margins of society, the outsiders, the outcasts,\\" according to Russ. In the fall of 2015, a research team, comsisting of Travis Russ, Anthony Dvarskas, and Amelia Parenteau, traveled to Pahokee, Florida, to research the \\"outcasts\\" (sex offenders) residing in Miracle Village, a few miles from the small city. They conducted 400+ hours of interviews with residents of Miracle Village, members of the United Methodist Church, and other Pahokee residents. They unearthed 300+ pages of archival documents (court records), and recorded thousands of pages of interviews and field notes. From this material each of the three went through highlighting what they thought was important. Travis Russ: \\"We made several trips. We went into this community and we built connections and relationships from the ground up. A lot of the time, I was very surprised by how open and forthcoming the interviewees were in sharing their very complicated and complex stories.\\" He found their stories \\"emotionally confusing\\". Amelia Parenteau commented at greater length: \\"We will have done our job if the audience has as many questions as we do. Researching this show asked us to take a long, hard look at the darkness of the human psyche. These stories ask us to contemplate fundamental structural tenets of society: justice, family, responsibility, healing, forgiveness, and rehabilitation.\\" A local television station, which claims it was their earlier story of February, 2015 that first introduced Russ to Miracle Village, did a news report on Russ and Parenteau during their visit. =First workshop (2016)= The play was workshopped October 11‚Äì24, 2016, in residence at IRT Theater, \\"a grassroots laboratory for independent theater and performance in New York City\\". It was presented October 21‚Äì23. \\"An ensemble of seven powerful actors embodies over 50 people in this dynamic play.\\" The actors Andrew Dawson and Brendan Dalton participated in this workshop, which was attended by Patti Auperlee and her daughter Lexi.

The loch was a natural feature, sitting in a hollow on the old Caprington Castle estate. The loch waters drain via the Todrigs Burn that flows into the River Irvine to the east of Gatehead village. It was partly drained, probably sometime after the 1820s, as were so many other lochs, as part of 18th and 19th centuries extensive agricultural improvements and the only area of open water that remains does so as it was once used as a curling pond for the Caprington Castle Estate owners and their employees or tenants. History =Place names= John Kelso Hunter visited and described the loch in the 1820s. A habitation named 'Lochside' is recorded in 1775 and again in 1821 to the east of the loch not far from the old Treesbank House and estate, but is no longer present or its old location known. Tod-holes, tod-strips, tod-rigs were places frequented by foxes. The original 'Tothiricks' (sic) farm was located near Peatland, to the north of Caprington Loch. =Caprington Loch= William Roy's map of 1747-55 does not show the loch however two mills are shown, one possibly a windmill. In 1775 the loch is shown with a 'Tode' habitation marked near to Caprington Castle. West Todrigs Farm may well incorporate this place name element. Todrigs Farm was the birthplace of Johnnie Walker of the Johnnie Walker whisky fame. It was sold to finance the purchase of the family's first grocer shop.Johnnie Walker and Todrigs In 1821 a sizeable loch is shown with the farm of Templeton to the south and a single burn running down from the Dankeith estate. As stated the remnants of the loch are located near Earlston close to the old West Todrigs Farm that was used for many years as the Eglinton Hunt Kennels. The loch was mainly fed by the Todrigs Burn which arises on the old Coodham Estate and by the Slough Burn that arises in the Dankeith estate. In around 1820 the Dankeith born artist John Kelso Hunter (15 December 1802 ‚Äì 3 February 1873) records a visit to Caprington Loch in his biography, writing: \\"Passing Caprington Loch I made the first artistic halt, took my position on the margin of the lake with my face toward Kilbirnie Hills. Their azure purity was mirrored in the still water. Towards the front of the picture a stunted hedge and part of a dilapidated paling ran into the lake, out of which sprang up a bold old saugh tree. Its graceful form was massively mirrored in the crystalline liquid. There I stood, as much inspired as ever artist was.\\" Caprington Castle and estate had been held by the Wallace's of Craigie Castle however it passed into the hands of the Cunninghames who held the barony as baronets from 1669 to 1829 when the line became extinct and John Smith assumed the name Cunninghame on behalf of his wife who had inherited the estate. West Todrigs Farm or 'The Eglinton Kennels'. Todrigs was a corn mill and later a thrashing mill that stood on the Todrigs Burn to the north of the Earlston hamlet with a head of water supplied by a mill pod located close to West Todrigs Farm that has been infilled. The curling pond at West Todrigs Farm was a little unusual in being an irregular shape as it was the lowest lying part of the old loch and sits close to the farm house. It is shown in 1897 and 1908 was served by the Todrigs Burn that either fed the mill pond or ran past the mill via a separate lade. The old road from Ayr to Kilmarnock and Glasgow ran quite close by so the site was not as isolated as it is today. Mining The 1908 OS map shows the location of two shafts close to a square raised water tank that represents the site of the 1770s Caprington Newcomen atmospheric pumping engine that helped drain the Caprington coalfield. The location of the site from which the 1770s Newcomen Atmospheric Beam engine originally came was the 'Caprington Colliery' with its numerous pits and the pumping engine itself located in Earlston. The engine worked more or less continuously for around ninety years and had its wooden beam replaced by a cast-iron one in 1837. It is not clear where the water was pumped to for disposal, however a square and embanked tank once stood near by and this may have been piped down to the old loch site to enter the burn.

His highest rank was j≈´ry≈ç 1. He was one of the smallest sekitori ever at and . After his retirement in 1990 he became a professional wrestler for a number of organizations including Super World of Sports, WAR, Pro Wrestling Crusaders and IWA Japan. Sumo career Despite his family having a background in professional wrestling he took part in many regional sumo competitions in elementary and junior high school. He entered professional sumo in March 1976, joining Onaruto stable. He was recruited by the former sekiwake K≈çtetsuyama. He initially fought under the shikona of Wakakotetsu, based on his stablemaster's, but in 1984 he became Ishinriki (\\"renewal power\\"), the name which he was also to use in pro-wrestling. He had a muscular build quite unlike other sumo wrestlers, but despite his weight disadvantage he managed to reach the j≈´ry≈ç division in May 1987 and was ranked there for 20 consecutive tournaments, with a 141-159 win/loss record. In March 1990 he defeated two future yokozuna, Akebono and Wakahanada, and he also looked to have defeated a third, Takahanada, but he was disqualified for a foul. He twice took part in playoffs for the j≈´ry≈ç championship in May and September 1989, but lost both times. He is the only wrestler to twice have the best record in j≈´ry≈ç but never earn promotion to the top makuuchi division. His highest rank of j≈´ry≈ç 1 west was achieved in November 1989. He retired in July 1990 after a 2‚Äì13 record left him facing certain demotion to the unsalaried makushita division. His overall record was 390 wins against 372 losses over 87 tournaments, with no matches missed. Wrestling career With 20 tournaments as a sekitori Ishinriki met the minimum requirement of inheriting an elder name in the Japan Sumo Association, and his stablemaster was prepared to let him inherit Onaruto stable, but Ishiniriki decided against it, believing he could make more money in professional wrestling. Although his elder brother was active in All Japan Pro Wrestling, Ishinriki instead joined SWS, making his debut in January 1991 in a match against Jeff Jarrett in Dallas, Texas. After SWS folded he was a member of its successors NOW and WAR, but then retired due to kidney problems. He married a fellow professional wrestler from WAR, and opened a chankonabe and karaoke restaurant in Kichij≈çji in 1994. While still running the restaurant he returned to wrestling in 2006, participating in IWA Japan and freelance promotions. He frequently appears as a guest on talk shows to discuss sumo. He appeared on the TV Asahi program \\"Live TV until the morning\\" (Êúù„Åæ„ÅßÁîü„ÉÜ„É¨„Éì!) to discuss the Tokitsukaze stable hazing scandal in 2007, and in 2011 when many top wrestlers were dismissed in a match-fixing scandal he denied that sumo had a problem with gambling and yazuka ties, despite his stablemaster Onaruto making similar claims in a book published shortly after his death in 1996. In August 2015 he said he would likely retire from wrestling the following year, which would mark the 40th anniversary of his sumo career. However, in August 2016 he was promoting a mixed tag team match also involving Funaki to be held on 6 November at the Shinjuku Face. Fighting style In sumo Ishinriki specialized in throwing techniques, with his three most common winning kimarite being shitatenage (underarm throw), uwatenage (overarm throw) and uwatedashinage (pulling overarm throw).

The band features two members of the rock group Godsmack, Shannon Larkin and Tony Rombola, alongside Brian Carpenter and Ray Cerbone. The band's debut album reached the Top 10 of Billboard's Blues Albums chart. In 2019 the band was resurrected with a name change and member change at the front. Shane Hall (who sang for another project that Shannon and Tony were doing on the side for fun) replaced Ray \\"Rafer John\\" Cerbone on Vocals. The band then changed the name to THE APOCALYPSE BLUES REVIVAL. The new version of the band released their first song, 'Can't Win For Losing' On July 22, 2019. History Godsmack bandmates Larkin and Rombola discovered their mutual love of blues music for the first time while they were writing together back in 2010. Growing tired of metal music they played in Godsmack, they put together a side project, which later evolved into Blues Revue when they added Carpenter, who had won a talent contest, and met Cerbone in a biker bar. With the lineup solidified, the group signed a recording contract with Provogue Records. Three months after signing to Provogue, the band released their self-titled debut LP on August 26, 2016, produced by Dave Fortman. It debuted at No. 6 on Billboard's Top Blues Album chart. Their second album, The Shape of Blues to Come, was released on July 20, 2018. The band will be touring the record in between supporting Godsmack's latest release in late 2018 and early 2019. On February 21, 2019, it was announced the band had called it quits.

From the late 1950s until his death in 1986, Blagdon created a constantly changing installation of paintings and sculptures in a small building on his Nebraska farm. He believed in the power of \\"earth energies\\" and in his own ability to channel such forces in a space that, through constant adjusting and aesthetic power, could alleviate pain and illness. Blagdon used found materials like hay baling wire, magnets, and remnant paints from farm sales, but he also sought out special ingredients like salts and other \\"earth elements\\" through a nearby pharmacy. He called the individual pieces his \\"pretties,\\" but collectively they composed The Healing Machine. Blagdon worked on his Healing Machine for more than three decades, tending, tinkering with, and reorganizing its components every day and, in his own words, \\"according to the phases of the moon.\\" He believed it was a functional machine in which energies were drawn upward from the building's earthen floor into the space, where they could bounce around and remain dynamic.

This species occurs in both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. It was first described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 as Aphrodita squamata but was later transferred to the genus Lepidonotus. Description The prostomium has two lobes and bears several pairs of antennae, a pair of palps and two pairs of eyes. The dorsal surface of the body, which has uniform width, is completely concealed by two rows of overlapping scales, resembling fish scales. These scales are modified cirri and are supported on short stalks. They are covered in tubercles of varying sizes, and have a fringe of papillae. This worm has 26 segments and grows to a length of about ; it is some shade of grey, drab brown or yellow, often being covered with mud. Distribution and habitat Lepidonotus squamatus occurs in Western Europe, including the North Sea, the Skagerrak, the Kattegat, the √ñresund Strait and the western Baltic Sea. It is also present on the eastern seaboard of North America from Labrador southward to New Jersey and on the western seaboard from Alaska to California. It occurs in the littoral zone and the sublittoral zone at depths down to about . Its habitat is typically beneath stones or among tangled growth. Ecology Scale worms play a role on the seabed similar to that of isopods (pill bugs or woodlice) on land. They are carnivorous, feeding on crabs, starfish, gastropod molluscs and any other small invertebrate they come across. The scales of Lepidonotus squamatus emit a faint bioluminescent glow. This is a defensive mechanism, because any predator feeding on the worm is likely to acquire some scales which will adhere to its mouthparts; these will make it more visible, alerting its own predators to its whereabouts.

Protection Laws  = Protection for Animals in Farming =  Rearing  The Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes conveys to the farming community conditions for all species of animals kept for the production of food, wool, skin, fur, etc. The law states that animals should be provided with food, water, care and any other factor needed to satisfy the overall well- being of the animal. Animals should be given the freedom of movement of animals and satisfactory environmental conditions.

In the event of breeding, no procedure that is likely to cause suffering or harm must not be carried out. No animal should be kept for farming purposes if it is considered a danger to their health.

A close friend and associate of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, often acting as his official deputy, he nationalised the Iranian fishing industry and played a major role in the nationalization of the Iranian oil industry. He served as governor of Isfahan, Gilan and Tehran. He entered parliament as representative of Khorramabad. After resisting the 1953 Iranian coup d'√©tat which toppled the democratically elected government of Mossadegh, Keshavarz Sadr was imprisoned and tortured. After his release he became spokesperson of the Second National Front and authored a range a books.  Early life  Keshavarz Sadr was born into a landowning, aristocratic family. His father Seyyed Hossein Khan (Mirza Kouchek Khan) ‚ÄòBahador ol-Molk‚Äô was a landowner from Khomeyn, who owned several villages and estates around Mahallat and who served as a military commander in the constitutionalist army. His father was a stepbrother of Prime Minister Mohsen Sadr (Sadr ol-Ashraf II). His mother Mariam Keshavarz was his father's cousin. The couple also had another son named Ali Mohammad Keshavarz Sadr. From the marriage of his father with Haj Malek(eh) Khanoum Khajeh Nassiri (a cousin of Mohsen Sadr), Keshavarz Sadr had two half-sisters: Eghlim Sadat and Shazdeh Aqa Keshavarz (Sadr). Keshavarz Sadr earned a degree from the Graduate School of Law in Tehran and proceeded to work as a lawyer at the Justice Department. He was appointed as the Director General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice and would rise to become the Head of the Judiciary in 1946.  First National Front  Mohammad Ali Keshavarz Sadr with USSR envoy He was a founding member of the National Front of Iran. He was first elected into the 15th and 16th Iranian Majlis as representative of Khorramabad and subsequently served as governor of Gilan, where his main concern was the implementation of the nationalisation of fisheries. At the end of January 1953, the Soviet request for an extension of their expired concession was turned down. In a meeting between Keshavarz Sadr and a USSR envoy on a ship in the Caspian Sea, the Iranian fishing industries were officially nationalised. He became the governor of Isfahan (a key province for Mossadegh), one of his recent predecessors being Mohammad Sa'ed. Keshavarz Sadr was one of ‚Äòthe eleven men‚Äô who proposed the bill of oil nationalisation to the Iranian Majlis. He resisted the coup d'√©tat in August 1953 until his residency collapsed following a military attack. He was viciously beaten and locked up in solitary confinement for 8 months.  Second National Front  Keshavarz Sadr before his speech at a National Front gathering in the early 1960s Mossadegh, whilst under house arrest, chose Keshavarz Sadr as his personal lawyer, which made him one of few legally allowed to visit the former Prime Minister. In 1960 Keshavarz Sadr, with the assistance of other prominent nationalists, formed the Second National Front, of which he would be main spokesman until 1963. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi could not but recognise the movement due to pressure from the international community. thumbMembers of the Central Council of the Second National Front. Keshavarz Sadr, fourth from left (standing). Behind him Saied Fatemi, nephew of Hossein Fatemi Keshavarz Sadr with former Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh in Ahmadabad (circa 1965-1966) On January 30, 1961, the headquarters of the National Front was closed down by the police. The National Front leadership decided to attract attention with a sit-in in the Senate building. The delegation included, amongst others, Keshavarz Sadr himself, Mehdi Bazargan and Kazem Hassibi. Keshavarz Sadr, who also dealt with NF student affairs, would be routinely arrested and interrogated by Savak until his death. He died in 1974 following a heart attack. The Pahlavi regime prevented his funeral from taking place, presumably to avert the large gathering of National Front supporters.  Literary Activities  Keshavarz Sadr published a series of well-received articles dealing with constitutional law and Iranian legal procedures. He also researched the ancient literature and history of Iran. However, his most important works are literary commentaries. He wrote a book that exclusively deals with female poets (Az R√§be'eh ta Parvin).  Private life His brother Ali Mohammad Keshavarz Sadr would become an architect and married to Badri Sadat Pasandideh, daughter of Ayatollah Morteza Pasandideh, the older brother of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. His sister Khanoum Eghlim Sadat Keshavarz (Sadr) (1922-2018) married post- and telegraph director, judge, poet, diarist and historian Amir Houshang Khan Khosrovani, whose poetic soirees were attended by Mohammad-Hossein Shahriar and others. His son Dr. Amir Houshang Keshavarz Sadr was a scholar of Iranian history and society.  Legacy  Mossadegh's grandson held particular praise for Mohammad Ali Keshavarz Sadr and Tehran Mayor Nosratollah Amini, saying of the former that he was ‚Äúon his own standing, a well-known and respected statesman (‚Ä¶) these men would use their integrity, their clout, their prestige and age to do positive things.‚Äù References Category:National Front (Iran) MPs Category:1902 births Category:1974 deaths Category:Iranian governors Category:Iranian lawyers Category:Members of the 15th Iranian Majlis Category:Members of the 16th Iranian Majlis Category:20th-century lawyers ","title":"Mohammad Ali Keshavarz Sadr"},{"id":"58040020","text":"Nelson Ribeiro (born 14 January 1910, date of death unknown) was a Brazilian rower.

It was completed in 1911 and published in 1912 by Universal Edition Vienna. The sonata is representative of the start of Szymanowski's late style. It was premiered by Arthur Rubinstein on 7th May 1911.  Historical background  The work was completed in Tymosz√≥wka, when Szymanowski was 29 years old. Shortly after its completion, Szymanowski wrote in a letter to Polish friend and music historian Zdzis≈Çaw Jachimecki: > \\"I have just finished the second 'Piano Sonata' before Arthur arrived. At > first I did not attach a great importance to it, yet after a detailed study > and after Arthur having played it all the 'hidden virtues' have come to > light and as a result Ficio and Arthur got immensely excited about it, > almost considering it superior to the > Symphony.\\"https://culture.pl/en/work/piano-sonata-no-2-in-a-major- > op-21-karol-szymanowski Analysis The sonata comprises two movements: #Allegro assai (Molto appassionato) (A Minor - D‚ô≠ Major - A Minor - A Major) #Theme and variations (A Major - F Major - B‚ô≠ Major - A Major - E Major - A Major) = 1. Allegro assai (Molto appassionato) = The opening bars of the first movement 8 - 10 minutes The first movement starts in cut time. It opens with a dark, chaotic and almost atonal introductory theme, which is referred to at various stages throughout the two movements, of broken octaves descending chromatically in tuplets in the left hand, aided by a simple melody of ascending octaves in the right. The theme progresses and changes time signatures numerous times until the start of the Quasi andante section At the start of the Quasi andante section, the key changes to D‚ô≠ Major and 2/4 time, and a new theme emerges. This time, the theme is less chaotic and more melodic and lyrical. = 2. Theme and variations = 17 - 19 minutes The second movement comprises a theme, eight variations and a fugue.  Reception  After a performance of the sonata at a concert devoted to Szymanowski's works in December 1911, Willy Renz wrote in the magazine Die Musik: > ‚ÄúIf the composer forces himself towards greater transparency, to a sensible > limit and concentration, if he can restrain his excessive fondness for > contrapuntal tricks, polyphonic complications and orchestral excesses, we > will have high hopes of him‚Äù  References   External links  Category:Piano sonatas Category:1911 compositions Category:Compositions in A minor ","title":"Piano Sonata No. 2 (Szymanowski)"},{"id":"58040079","text":"Henrique Camargo (born 28 October 1910, date of death unknown) was a Brazilian rower.

The 97 members of the three bands currently perform at approximately 500 state, military and civilian events annually. History The idea for an Army School of Music was first noted in November 1922, when General Richard Mulcahy, the then Chief of Staff, said that he wants to have bands \\"that will dispense music and musical understanding in the highest terms to the people\\". The first requirement was for expert military musicians to take on the task of training bands. It is necessary to mention one younger band. At the time, military bands closely followed the precedent of the British Corps of Army Music, with the civilian Brass and Reed Band of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union playing a role in a native Army School of Music.http://mural.maynoothuniversity.ie/5379/1/Joseph_Ryan_Vol-1_20140905081542.pdf&ved;=2ahUKEwjSn7CYnL_mAhVNRK0KHRV0A5cQFjAOegQIARAB&usg;=AOvVaw1YpIHFq3O-yaNssoPaxxVe The government originally reached out to the French Republican Guard Band, which was unsuccessful, however they were able to receive training from Germany. One musician in particular, Colonel Wilhelm Fritz Brase, who was the \\"Royal Music Director\\" of the Emperor Alexander 1st Guards Grenadiers since 1907, was invited to lead the band on March 1, 1923. By January 1924, the entire operation was transferred from the Curragh, to Beggars Bush Barracks in Dublin. Between 1924 and 1936, a school and three more military bands, all under the title of \\"The Army School of Music\\". In 1929, five bands were operational in the army: *7th Infantry Battalion (Dublin) *5th Infantry Battalion (Kildare) *12th Infantry Battalion (Limerick) *2nd Infantry Battalion (Athlone) Colonel Brase died in 1940 and was succeeded by Colonel Sauerzweig, who emigrated to Ireland with Brase, served as director until 1947. 1997 saw a reorganisation of the Defence Forces which also included a reduction in overall strength. The bands of the re-titled Defence Forces School of Music did not remain untouched by this process.

Mission and contemporary activities The DFSM has the responsibility for the overall direction of music policy within the Defence Forces. In addition to overseeing all purchases of new instruments, music and band equipment, the DFSM has responsibility of recruiting and training new instrumentalists. Military instrumentalists of the DFSM provide musical support for all aspects of military life. Potential instrumentalists are required to complete an online application form when they are between 18‚Äì28 years old.https://journalofmusic.com/listing/03-04-15/instrumentalists-defence- forces-school-musichttps://idmmei.org/record.php?id=3450 During the Easter Rising centenary parade, the DFSM was represented along with 4 other civilian bands at the from St. Stephen's Green to O'Connell Bridge. Colonel James McGee was responsible for the current arrangement of Amhr√°n na bhFiann on state occasions. The DFSM composed the anthem based on British military marches and songs of the era.One Productions 2015 at 7m‚Äì8m30s Uilleann piper Colm √ì Lochlainn described this version with the following: \\"The tune is not Irish; it sounds to me something between a Sousa march and a German regimental song\\". Uniform Irish Army Bands wear a black ceremonial uniform with red stripes on the trousers and peak cap type headwear. The DFSM's traditional uniform was Bottle-green, which is one of the standard colours of the Irish Army. Lieutenant Colonel Brendan Power of the DFSM criticized the band's uniform, \\"It was worst when we'd travel abroad\\" and that they \\"didn't look the business.\\" In February 2003, it changed gained its modern uniform in the fourth change of dress since its foundation. Outside of the current one and the bottle green uniform, other uniforms included one with St. Patrick's blue, and a navy blue in the early 1960s.

The Army No. 1 Band () was formed in 1923 by Colonel Wilhelm Fritz Brase (The former Royal Music Director of the Emperor Alexander 1st Guards Grenadiers) and gave its first public performance under the direction of Colonel Brase at the Theatre Royal in Dublin, in October of that year. The band, was the first of four military bands to be established between 1923 and 1936, is the premier military band of the Irish Army. It performs on all major ceremonial occasions, including the presidential inauguration. It also provides musical support during state visits to Ireland by foreign heads of state. The band has performed at festival and military tattoos in Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and France. It is based out of Cathal Brugha Barracks in Dublin and has been led by Captain Fergal Carroll since 2010. =Band of the 1st Brigade= Charles Fort The Band of the 1st Southern Brigade () also known as the Army No. 2 Band was formed in April 1925 at Beggars Bush Barracks, Dublin. Its current title, dates from a reorganisation of the Defence Forces in 1997. Since 2007, the band has been led by Captain Brian Prendergast. It is located in Collins Barracks, Cork. =Band of the 4th Brigade= The Band of the 4th Brigade () also known as the Army No. 4 Band is another territorial band of the DFSM based in Athlone. It was formed in 1936 and has been located at Custume Barracks in Athlone ever since. The band was previously known as the Band of the Western Command. The band services an area ranging from Westmeath to Donegal. It has had the distinction, unlike other military bands, to have served a six-month tour as part of a United Nations mission in Cyprus in 1965. During its tour, it performed for both the Greek and Turkish communities on the island. It was also the Irish military band to perform in the United Kingdom when it visited Birmingham, England. It has also abroad to perform in festivals and parades in countries such as France, Lebanon and Belgium.https://percyfrench.ie/the-army-band-of-4-western-brigade/ Defence Forces Pipe Bands Pipe bands marching during the Dublin Horse Show and Nations Cup in August 2010.

The course is considered to stand within the conservative evangelical tradition.  Course outline and versions  The first edition of the course was published on November 1, 2016. The sessions are: # The Good God # The Trustworthy God # The Generous God # The Liberating God # The Fulfilling God # The Life-Giving God # The Joyful God There is a follow-on course entitled \\"Discipleship Explored\\", written and presented by Barry Cooper, and \\"English Made Easy\\" editions of both Christianity Explored and Discipleship Explored. Christianity Explored publications are also available in Bulgarian, Dutch, German, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Luganda, Polish, Spanish, Swahili and Welsh. Translations in progress include French, Mandarin, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian and Swedish. In 2011 the course, already being used in over 50 countries, was rolled out in the United States: it was endorsed by John Piper and Tim Keller.  Use  Life Explored use is like the sister-course Christianity Explored in that both courses are aimed at a non-Christian audience who are open to exploring who is Jesus, why did he come, and what does it mean to follow him. Both LE and CE are relational with most courses run with a meal environment and both look to at the source document of Christianity - The Bible to make this exploration. Both are seven session series and both can be run in homes, in churches or in a third-place environment. It can be run before or after Christianity Explored or Alpha, and is perfect for anyone looking for answers to life‚Äôs big questions. The course is popular with millennials as the course uses short films as a story telling medium to engage the heart and mind. It has been endorsed by a number of theologians such as DA Carson when he said, \\"At a time in the Western world when basic knowledge of the Bible is increasingly rare, it is a pleasure to recommend Life Explored. Here is an introduction to the good news found in Jesus Christ, sweeping through some of the \\"big pictures\\" in the Bible. As far as a short series can, Life Explored outlines what the Bible is about, exposes our idolatry, and makes clear where forgiveness and hope lie. This is one of the best of the rising number of evangelistic tools addressing men and women in the twenty-first century.‚Äù (D. A. Carson) Because in the West, particularly among the millennial generation, we can no longer take any level of biblical literacy for granted, LE gives people the context they need to be able to understand who Jesus is and why he came. A panoramic view of the Bible is given - creation, fall, redemption and new creation - rather than just a narrow slice of the picture.  Comparison with the Christianity Explored course  Similarities: Both courses are evangelistic, expository (letting the Bible tell the Gospel), and engaging (in a relational, dialogue intentional setting. While Christianity Explored uses the Gospel of Mark, Life Explored (also a 7 week course) looks at the Bible as the whole while looking at the character of God to ask the question, \\"What is the best gift God could give you?\\" The course follows a general outline of creation, fall, redemption and new-creation. Distinctive features of Life Explored: Because it‚Äôs more readily acknowledged among postmoderns than the concept of law-breaking, LE explains sin as idolatry, while CE explains sin as law-breaking. Life Explored uses two films - one story film and one teaching film - in each session to engage the participant. The story film - for the most part filmed without dialogue - helps the viewer see how one has replaced the gift of God himself with a cheaper, and inadequate substitute. The second film is a teaching film (like the CE films) reveals the God of the Bible as the answer to our deepest longing.

It has been formulated both as short-acting oil solutions and long-acting microcrystalline aqueous suspensions and is given by injection into muscle either once or continuously at regular intervals. EB/P4 was one of the first combined estrogen and progestogen medications to be introduced for medical use. It was first marketed in Germany as an oil solution in 1950. Microcrystalline EB/P4 in aqueous suspension was developed and marketed under the brand name Sistocyclin several years later. EB/P4 was eventually superseded by longer- acting parenteral estrogen‚Äìprogestogen combinations as well as by oral estrogen‚Äìprogestogen combinations. Medical uses EB/P4 has been used to treat menstrual disorders such as secondary amenorrhea and menstrual irregularity, as a form of emergency contraception within 48 hours of sexual intercourse,https://www.medicamentos.com.mx/DocHTM/27809.htm and as a test for pregnancy. In the form of a microcrystalline aqueous suspension, EB/P4 has particularly been used to treat functional uterine bleeding. EB/P4 has been studied in the treatment of breast cancer in women and found to be effective. =Available forms= EB/P4 is or has been available for use by intramuscular injection both in the form of short-acting oil solutions (e.g., Duogynon, Lutrogen) and long-acting microcrystalline aqueous suspensions (e.g., Clinomin Forte, Sistocyclin). These are provided as ampoules, with the oil-solution ampoules containing 2‚Äì3 mg EB and 12.5‚Äì50 mg progesterone and the aqueous- suspension ampoules containing 10 mg EB and 200 mg progesterone. The crystal sizes in microcrystalline EB/P4 in aqueous suspension (Sistocyclin) are 0.01 to 0.02 mm for EB crystals and 0.02 to 0.1 mm for P4 crystals. An oil-solution ampoule containing 30 mg EB and 30 mg P4 (brand name Vermagest) is used as an injectable emergency contraceptive.https://www.drugs.com/international/vermagest.html Clinomin Forte is an aqueous suspension of EB/P4 that additionally contains lidocaine and remains available today.https://web.archive.org/web/20200818223302/http://www.indufar.com.py/files/shares/prospectos/400000154.pdf Side effects Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= EB is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors, the biological target of estrogens like endogenous estradiol. It is an estradiol ester and prodrug of estradiol with a longer duration of action than estradiol when administered by intramuscular injection in oil solution or aqueous suspension. P4 is a progestogen, or an agonist of the progesterone receptors, the biological target of progestogens like endogenous progesterone. The full endometrial transformation dosage of EB/P4 in oil solution is 1 to 2 mg EB and 20 to 25 mg P4 by intramuscular injection daily for 10 to 14 days, whereas the full endometrial transformation dosage of EB/P4 in microcrystalline aqueous suspension is a single intramuscular injection of 10 mg EB and 200 mg P4. For comparison, the full endometrial transformation dosage of estradiol valerate and hydroxyprogesterone caproate in oil solution (brand name Gravibinon) is a single intramuscular injection of 10 mg estradiol valerate and 250 to 375 mg hydroxyprogesterone caproate. Endometrial transformation normally occurs during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle; it is induced by endogenous progesterone following adequate priming by endogenous estradiol. The decidua (pregnancy-type endometrium) induction dosage of EB/P4 in oil solution is 2 to 5 mg EB and 20 to 100 mg P4 by intramuscular injection daily for 5 to 7 weeks, whereas the decidua induction dosage of EB/P4 in microcrystalline aqueous suspension is 10 to 20 mg EB and 200 to 250 mg P4 in microcrystalline aqueous suspension by intramuscular injection once per week for about 6 weeks. For comparison, the decidua induction dosage of estradiol valerate and hydroxyprogesterone caproate in oil solution is about the same as that of microcrystalline EB/P4 in aqueous suspension. The decidua induction dosages of estrogen and progestogen combinations are pseudopregnancy dosages. =Pharmacokinetics= EB/P4 is administered by intramuscular injection a single time or continuously at regular intervals, depending on the indication. Amorphous EB/P4 in oil solution (e.g., Duogynon, Lutrogen) is reported to have a duration of action of 2 days in terms of the progestogen component, and hence is a short-acting preparation, whereas microcrystalline EB/P4 in aqueous suspension (e.g., Sistocyclin) has a duration of 10 to 12 days, and hence is a long-acting preparation. A study found that a single intramuscular injection of 10 mg microcrystalline EB in aqueous suspension with a 0.05 mm crystal size (similar to that in Sistocyclin) resulted in a maximal 7-fold increase in estradiol excretion on the 2nd day after injection and maintained elevated estradiol excretion for 17 days. History EB/P4 in oil solution for use by intramuscular injection was first marketed in Germany in 1950. It was one of the first combined estrogen and progestogen medications to be introduced for medical use. To achieve a longer duration of action, microcrystalline EB/P4 with defined crystal sizes in aqueous suspension was developed, studied in 1954, and marketed under the brand name Sistocyclin shortly thereafter in the 1950s. Formulations containing a combination of EB or estradiol valerate (an estradiol ester with a longer duration than EB) and the longer-acting synthetic progestogen hydroxyprogesterone caproate in oil solution (brand names Primosiston, Gravibinon) were introduced in 1955 and eventually superseded EB/P4. Oral estrogen‚Äìprogestogen combinations, such as mestranol/noretynodrel (brand name Enovid), were also introduced in the 1950s, and soon replaced EB/P4 for menstrual and other indications as well.

It is situated in Olympic National Park on the Olympic Peninsula. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Deception at to the southeast. Precipitation runoff drains into tributaries of the Dungeness River and Dosewallips River. Climate Gilhooley Tower is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

Some Genoese knives have a special shape, very similar to a dagger or stylet and are therefore prohibited. Especially actively used not only in the territory of the Republic of Genoa from the XVII to the XVIII centuries. Other knives of this type were a tool for work or everyday use, sometimes even included in the set along with an elegant dress, so they were on sale. Until today, for this type of knives are still stand out for their constructive properties. Wearing a Genoese knife can lead to arrest, since it is forbidden to wear and turnover.Il coltello genovese. STORIE DI LAME, DI ARMI PROHIBITE E DI ¬´CARUGGI¬ª di Andrea Buti ‚Äî P. 9 The existence of the Genoese knife itself is ambiguous, since it is both a useful tool in everyday life and a weapon that was easily used in combat, it is also necessary to take into account the rather low cost of the Genoese knife during manufacture. As in those days, and today, such a knife was made mainly by representatives of the criminal world. In addition, some representatives of different sectors of society did not miss such an opportunity to forge, make copies and assign to other types of knives some features and elements of the Genoese knife,Il coltello genovese. STORIE DI LAME, DI ARMI PROHIBITE E DI ¬´CARUGGI¬ª di Andrea Buti ‚Äî P. 17 and as it turned out, this activity develops very well. This contributed to the spread of Genoese knife samples in other parts of Italy, especially in Corsica, as there were found many specimens that clearly allow to determine the origin of the Genoese knife.Das Schwert des Volkes: Geschichte, Kultur und Methodik des traditionellen, italienischen Messerkampfes, Roberto Laura, tredition, 2015. ‚Äî Kapitel 1.3.2; 9.1; 10.2  Distinctive characteristics  The handle of the Genoese knife is usually without a guard, slightly asymmetrical in shape compared to the blade. Very often the handle is made of olive wood, sage or laurel, which was popular in the XVIII century in Genoa. In this case, the handle is called \\"perno\\" or \\"pernetto\\". The handle of the Genoese knife usually does not condense to increase the penetration and resistance at impact.Il coltello genovese. STORIE DI LAME, DI ARMI PROHIBITE E DI \\"CARUGGI\\" di Andrea Buti ‚Äî P. 11-12 There are different types of grips of the Genoese knife, in shape they can be too different from each other, both the material itself and the finish. So it's useless to try to find any \\"common factor\\" or distinctive characteristics. Also knife handles were made of metal, which is quite rare, especially the ivory knives. A unique specimen of the 18th century Genovese knife from ivory is represented in the collection of Butteen of the Medieval Arms Museum in Bologna, Lionello Shara. This Genoese knife was presented in the catalog in 1991.Catalogo della armeria reale: illustrato con incisioni in legno, Armeria reale (Turin, Italy), Angelo Angelucci, G.

She had three sisters, Catherine, Martha, and Mary, and three brothers, James, Michael, and John. The family emigrated to America when Jordan was 3, settling in New York City, with her father taking a position as a professor. Jordan was educated at private schools and by tutors at home, beginning to write at a young age. A teacher warned her mother that \\"either she will one day write fiction or she is one of those natural liars to whom truth is unattractive.\\" She published her first story at age 12, encouraged by her father. Career Her stories and poems were published in numerous journals and magazines including The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's, McClure's, and The Century Magazine. She built up a large readership, with one of her most popular piece's The kiss of gold appearing in October 1892 in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine. Jordan wrote and published a number of novels, mostly melodramas but well received critically. Trouble-the- house her last novel from 1921 has autobiographical details. Happifat dolls in a dramatic scene Jordan both wrote and adapted a number of plays. One 4 act melodrama, The masked woman, ran for 115 performances in 1922-1923. Her plays were not as well received as her novels. Her 1917 The happifats and the grouch was a children's book. She designed a range of dolls, Happifats, to accompany her book. These dolls were bisque and made in Germany by Borgfeldt from 1913-1921, and Japan. Her 1905 novel, Time the comedian, was adapted as a silent film by Fanny and Frederick Hatton which starred Theodore Kosloff. Jordan travelled extensively, including long stays in England and France. She was a member of the London Pen and Brush Club and the Lyceum, the Writer's Club in London, and was associated with the Society of American Dramatists and the Authors‚Äô League of America. From 1890 to 1920 she was a member of the Cos Cob art colony. Later life Jordan married Frederic M. Vermilye, a New York broker, in 1897, but continued to publish under her maiden name. The couple divorced a few years later. Towards the end of her life, Jordan suffered from depression and her health suffered due to hypertension. She developed insomnia due to anxiety over finishing a novel. Jordan left her residence at the Hotel Touraine in April 1926 to live with her niece, Mrs George A. Reeder, in Mountain Lakes, New Jersey. She boarded the Boontown-Denville trolley on 20 June 1926, when other passengers noted her nervous demeanour. Her body was found the next morning amongst scrub pines, she was holding a bottle of Lysol. Her death was ruled a suicide, and her ashes were interred in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Tarrytown, New York.

What began with hurling insults escalated into violence, and swiftly following their \\"'insulting and contumacious words\\", the armed mob \\"did wickedly kill, mutilate, and plunder of their goods, and wound very many persons there assembled, and further did prevent the justices from showing justice\\" as they were due to.

By July, Henry, Earl of Lancaster had ensured that most of them had received royal pardons on condition that they joined his military campaign to Gascony. Recent scholarship has indicated that the riots were an extension of an on-going feud between two gentry families, the Radcliffe and Trafford families, all of whose retainers were later found among the accused. There were a number of casualties among each family.

The film grew out of the Lettrist movement in Paris. Description Venom and Eternity is arranged in a three-part structure. The first chapter, \\"Principle\\" (), displays people walking around the streets of Paris as the audio track presents an argument at a film society. The second chapter, \\"Development\\" (), shows a romantic meeting between two people. This section is combined with found footage. The final chapter, \\"Proof\\" (), uses increasingly abstract images, including countdown leader and clear leader. Its audio track resumes the debate from \\"Principle\\" and features Lettrist poetry.Caba√±as 2014, pp. 31. Production Isou began filming Venom and Eternity in 1950.Wall-Romana 2012, p. 229. The scenes of various Lettrists walking were shot on the streets of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s. Isou used found footage discarded by the Ministry of Defence and various film laboratories. Release Isou first screened a four- and-a-half-hour rough cut of the film on 20 April 1951.Caba√±as 2014, p. 1. Fearing that he would be deported from France in the event of public controversy, Isou had the film transported to the 1951 Cannes Film Festival by , , Fran√ßois Dufrene, Maurice Lema√Ætre, and Gil J Wolman. Isou was unable to enter Venom and Eternity into the festival but harassed officials until they allowed him to present his film at the Vox Theater.Caba√±as 2014, pp. 22‚Äì23. At the time of the premiere, only the first third of the film had a completed image track.Caba√±as 2014, p. 25. A hostile audience began jeering shortly after the film began. After the first section finished, the screen went blank. The projector light was turned off as the audio track continued to play to a darkened theatre. Audience members were infuriated, and the screening was ended early.Wall-Romana 2012, p. 230. Accounts of the scandalous response described a rioting audience and police officers using fire hoses on the crowd, but these stories are largely apocryphal. Director Jean Cocteau awarded Isou the \\"Prix de spectateurs d'avant-garde\\" for Venom and Eternity.Verrone 2011, p. 65. As soon as Venom and Eternity was completed, the Cin√©-Club Avant- Garde 52 showed it at the Mus√©e de l'Homme in Paris. Starting in January 1952, it had a two-week theatrical run at the Studio de l'Etoile.Caba√±as 2014, pp. 33‚Äì34. Legacy Venom and Eternity was the first cinematic work by the Lettrist movement.

As the Ming dynasty didn't produce copper coinage at the time since it predominantly used silver coins and paper money as the main currency, the records vary on when the Yongle Emperor ordered its creation between 1408 and 1410, this was done as the production of traditional cash- style coinage had earlier ceased in 1393. The Yongle Tongbao cash coins were notably not manufactured for the internal Chinese market where silver coinage and paper money would continue to dominate, but were in fact produced to help stimulate international trade as Chinese cash coins were used as a common form of currency throughout South, Southeast, and East Asia. As Yongle Tongbao cash coins were primarily used only for foreign trade, it is extremely uncommon for Yongle Tongbao coins to be found in archaeological digs within China's borders. In fact very few coin hoards of Ming dynasty coins in China ever contain any Yongle Tongbao coins, comparatively Yongle Tongbao coins are dug up in large quantities in countries like India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea and Japan, these coin hoards often weigh tens of tons. Outside of Asia Yongle Tongbao cash coins have also been found in places like Africa and Yukon. In Japan Eiraku Ts≈´h≈ç (the Japanese reading of Yongle Tongbao) cash coins became a very common design and many private and government mints produced copies of the coin. The design of an Eiraku Ts≈´h≈ç coin was also used on the flag of Oda Nobunaga.  In China  After the Yongle Emperor had ordered their production the Yongle Tongbao cash coins started being produced in the mints of Beijing, Nanjing, and Fujian as well as the provincial mints of Zhejiang and Guangdong. However, as these coins were primarily manufactured for foreign trade and to be carried by envoys of the Chinese court they generally did not circulate within China itself as silver coinage and banknotes would continue to remain the dominant media of exchange. Under subsequent rulers coinage could continue to only be sparsely produced.  In Japan  From 1587 Japan started exporting goods to China and received Chinese copper-alloy cash coins in return for payment, around this time the Japanese stopped minting their own coins and started relying heavily on Chinese cash coins as the internal demand for copper coinage increased. The Eiraku Ts≈´h≈ç coin in Japan is known as a toraisen (\\"Tang money\\" or \\"Chinese money\\"), and other cash coins with Ming dynasty era inscriptions also started circulating in Japan. As the imports of Chinese cash coins didn't fulfill the demand the Japanese market had many Japanese mints started casting reproductions of these toraisen which were known as shich≈´sen, and shich≈´sen of inferior quality were known as bitasen or money made from bad metal. These coins with Ming dynasty inscriptions remained in circulation in Japan until they were officially prohibited by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1608.Vi·ªát Touch VIET NAM COINS & PAPER NOTES.

On the 5th month of the year Eiroku 3 (Ê∞∏Á¶Ñ‰∏âÂπ¥, or 1560 in the Gregorian calendar), daimy≈ç Oda Nobunaga was preparing for the Battle of Okehazama and while he had an army of forty thousand men, he could only gather around two and a half thousand soldiers for this decisive battle, Oda Nobunaga then went to pray for a victorious military campaign at the nearby Atsuta-jing≈´, he asked the Gods to show him a sign that his prayers would be answered and while looking at a handful of Eiraku Ts≈´h≈ç cash coins decided to throw them in the air, when they fell back on the ground they all landed with heads up, he took this as a sign that the Gods would bless him and informed his men that they shall be victorious as they Gods favoured them. After winning the battle he used the Eiraku Ts≈´h≈ç as a motif for his nobori (a type of flag or banner) and then he had these Eiraku Ts≈´h≈ç coins inlayed on the tsuba of the sword which he carried during the battle. After Oda Nobunaga's forces were victorious his retainer Hayashi Hidesada said that the Gods must've really spoken through these coins to which Nobunaga replied by saying the Zen Buddhist proverb \\"I only know that I'm okay with what I got\\" (ÂêæÂîØÁü•Ë∂≥, ware tada taru o shiru) and presented to him an Eiraku Ts≈´h≈ç coin of which both the obverse and reverse sides were heads. Family crests with this proverb written around a square hole resembling a cash coin are not uncommon among military families. Another possibility as to why Oda Nobunaga used Eiraku Ts≈´h≈ç cash coins as a motif on his nobori was because Eiraku Ts≈´h≈ç were originally all imported from Ming China during the Muromachi period and spread throughout Japan as the de facto currency, speculation has it that Nobunaga tried to emulate this by having Eiraku Ts≈´h≈ç as his emblem meaning that his power too shall spread throughout Japan. The tsuba Oda Nobunaga was carrying during his military campaigns which had the Eiraku Ts≈´h≈ç inlayed into it was nicknamed the \\"invincibility tsuba\\" („Åæ„Åë„Åö„ÅÆÈçî) as he had won all battles he had fought while carrying that tsuba. The Eiraku Ts≈´h≈ç are divided on this tsuba with 6 being on the omote and 7 of them are displayed on the ura side. This tsuba was declared to be a kokuh≈ç (national treasure) in 1920.  Influence on Ryukyuan coinage  A Sek≈ç Ts≈´h≈ç (‰∏ñÈ´òÈÄöÂØ≥) cash coin manufactured by using an altered Yongle Tongbao cash coin as a mother coin. From 1461 the Ryukyu Kingdom under the reign of King Sh≈ç Toku started minting Sek≈ç Ts≈´h≈ç (‰∏ñÈ´òÈÄöÂØ≥) cash coins based on the Yongle Tongbao, these coins were manufactured by using circulating Yongle Tongbao coins as mother coins and carving the characters Sek≈ç (‰∏ñÈ´ò) out of the Yongle inscription on the top and bottom of the coin, this made the Sekou appear rounded while the Ts≈´h≈ç (ÈÄöÂØ≥) remained very angular, as copper shrinks during the cooling part of the manufacturing process these Sek≈ç Ts≈´h≈ç tend to be diminutive in size. Like regular Yongle Tongbao cash coins it's not uncommon for Ryukyuan cash coins from this period to also be found in coin hoards in countries like Indonesia.‰πùÂ∑ûÊ≠¥Âè≤Ë≥áÊñôÈ§® (Ky≈´sh≈´ Historical Museum) ÔΩ¢Â§ß‰∏ñÈÄöÂÆù„ÉªÔΩ¢‰∏ñÈ´òÈÄöÂÆù„Äç„ÅØ ÁêâÁêÉÁéãÂõΩ„ÅåÁô∫Ë°å„Åó„Åü„Ç≥„Ç§„É≥ .] (in Japanese) Retrieved: 31 July 2018.  Yongle Tongbao cash coins in Kenya  Yongle Tongbao cash coins produced by the Ming dynasty have been unearthed in the East African country of Kenya, in 2010 a team of Kenyan and Chinese archeologists uncovered a Yongle Tongbao cash coin in the village of Mambrui which is just north of Malindi, this coin and other objects of Chinese origin in the area were taken as evidence of how far Zheng He's expedition reached as it is likely that this coin was brought to the island through the ventures of this Ming dynasty era Chinese explorer, this was seen as these researchers as proof that Zheng He also visited the area which is known today as Kenya. In the year 2013 during a joint expedition to Manda Island the researchers Chapurukha Kusimba of the Field Museum of Natural History and Sloan Williams from the University of Illinois at Chicago found a Yongle Tongbao coin there, this coin was also attributed as being likely brought there during Zheng He's expedition.

Raised mostly in northern and central Pennsylvania in mid-1864, the regiment initially served with the Army of the James during the Siege of Petersburg, holding trenches at Bermuda Hundred. In late November it transferred to the Army of the Potomac and during the northern hemisphere spring campaign fought in the counterattack during the Battle of Fort Stedman and the Union breakthrough at Petersburg. During last days of the Appomattox Campaign it guarded the supply line, and participated in the Grand Review of the Armies following the end of the war before mustering out.  History  = Formation and Army of the James service = The 207th Pennsylvania was raised in northern and central Pennsylvania beginning in mid-July 1864 in response to President Abraham Lincoln's call for 500,000 men. Companies A, D, H, and K as well as parts of Companies B, E, and G were composed of men recruited in Tioga County, Company C recruited in Clinton County, Company F in Cumberland and Franklin Counties, Company I in Lycoming County, and the remainder of Companies B, E, and G in Bradford, York, and Lancaster Counties. The ten companies of the regiment moved to Camp Curtin near Harrisburg, where they were organized on 8 September under the command of volunteer officer Colonel Robert C. Cox, the former major of the 171st Pennsylvania Infantry. After completing its organization, the 207th Pennsylvania was sent to the front on 12 September and spent the next four days waiting for orders before it was assigned to the Provisional Brigade of the Defenses of Bermuda Hundred of the Army of the James in the Siege of Petersburg. The regiment served on picket duty at Bermuda Hundred. Fraternization between the opposing pickets was routine, but this state of affairs ended when Confederate division commander George Pickett launched a night attack on 17 November. The regiment was moved forward to support the pickets, losing two killed and several wounded in the fighting. = Army of the Potomac service during late 1864 and early 1865 = The 207th transferred to the IX Corps of the Army of the Potomac on 24 November, and participated in a demonstration on the left flank without fighting. After returning to the corps lines, it encamped on the Army Line Railroad near Fort Prescott on the extreme right flank. The Provisional Brigade was organized during December into the 3rd Division of the corps, commanded by Brigadier General John F. Hartranft. The 207th became part of the 2nd Brigade of Colonel Joseph A. Mathews alongside the 205th and 211th Pennsylvania. During the northern hemisphere winter of 1864‚Äì1865, the regiment conducted training and participated in several forays without participating in fighting, including support of the Weldon Railroad expedition between 7 and 11 December, and the Battle of Hatcher's Run from 5 to 7 February 1865. At Hatcher's Run, Cox took temporary command of the brigade and the regiment went into line of battle when it reached the creek as there was heavy fighting to the left of the regiment. The 207th fortified its position with log and earth breastworks at night, expecting an attack. However, no Confederate attack occurred and the regiment returned to camp after spending four days in the rain, sleet, and snow. = Fort Stedman = A bombproof at Fort Stedman When Fort Stedman was captured by a Confederate attack before dawn on 25 March, the regiment was in camp. The regiment marched initially at the double quick towards the division headquarters at the Avery House in response to Hartranft's order, then at a quick step advanced into a ravine to a point almost across from the fort, sheltering beneath a bank. Despite heavy fire, the regiment suffered few casualties there due to the cover. When the 211th Pennsylvania with Hartranft leading began the advance, the regiment followed, but shortly afterwards Mathews ordered a halt. Cox led four companies into the fort with the advanced lines, having failed to receive the order. After a brief pause, the other six companies advanced into the breastworks and redoubt to the left of the fort, capturing numerous prisoners and a battle flag, as the Confederate troops retreated, believing the exposed 211th Pennsylvania, formed in a line of battle, to be stronger than it was. Due to its concealed position and rapid advance, the 207th lost one killed and sixteen wounded in the recapture of the west angle of the fort. After the recapture of the fort, the regiment returned to camp. = Petersburg breakthrough and Appomattox = Confederate defenses of Fort Mahone at Petersburg, Virginia, 1865, where the regiment fought on 2 April The regiment fought in the Appomattox Campaign between 28 March and 9 April, during which it participated in the Union breakthrough at Petersburg on 2 April. The regiment prepared for the assault along with the rest of the division on the night of 30 March, but it was postponed until the morning of 2 April. Shortly after 03:00, it advanced from the camp and formed in a line of battle directly in front of Fort Sedgwick with its left on the Jerusalem Plank Road, the forward regiment of the brigade. Cox led the regiment through a hail of fire across the Confederate picket line and the quickly dismantled chevaux- de-frise to overrun the main Confederate line; the regimental colors were planted on the parapet of the fort commanding the road. The commingled regiments of the brigade then turned to the left and seized three other fortifications and captured five cannon, which were turned around against the Confederate troops. The regiment repulsed multiple counterattacks in fierce fighting, during which Cox temporarily relieved the ill Mathews in command of the brigade at 10:00. The regimental position was partially enfiladed by a Confederate battery on the left flank, and after it ran out of captured Confederate ammunition sent squads back to Fort Sedgwick across exposed ground under fire for more ammunition. Despite suffering many casualties in crossing the space, the squads brought back enough ammunition to last until 16:00, when the Confederate fire ended. In the battle, the regiment lost 37 killed, 140 wounded (including ten officers), and eight missing for a total of 185 casualties. Among those killed was one company commander, and two lieutenants were mortally wounded. Sergeant Charles H. Ilgenfritz of Company E was awarded the Medal of Honor for planting the regimental colors on the parapet of the fort commanding the road after the color bearer was shot. On the night of 2-3 April, the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia retreated from Petersburg, which the division entered on the following morning, meeting no resistance. During the pursuit of the Confederate forces it guarded the supply lines as the army advanced along the Southside Railroad, receiving news of the Confederate surrender at Burkeville on 9 April. The 207th remained there for several weeks, serving on picket duty while also guarding and paroling Confederate prisoners of war. On 21 April it moved to City Point and lastly Alexandria on 28 April, where it remained until mustering out. After participating in the Grand Review of the Armies on 23 May, it mustered out on 31 May, with the recruits transferred to the 51st Pennsylvania. During it service, the regiment lost three officers and 51 men killed or mortally wounded, and one officer and 24 men to disease, for a total of 79. In 1866, Cox was recognized \\"for gallant and meritorious services at Forts Stedman and Sedgwick, Va., April 2, 1865\\" when he was nominated by President Andrew Johnson and approved by the U.S. Senate for the rank of brigadier-general by brevet.\\"To Be Brigadier-Generals by Brevet\\", in \\"Brevet Appointments Confirmed.\\" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: The Daily Evening Telegraph, February 26, 1866.

Boston-based musician and business woman who founded Butterfly Music Transgender Chorus, the second all-transgender chorus in the country, in 2014. The first, the Transcendence Gospel Choir, was established in San Francisco in the early 2000s.  Early life  Hammond grew up in Wellesley, and spend a lot of time with family in Plymouth, where she worked at the former Mayflower Seafoods on the waterfront. From an early age, Hammond's mother encouraged her to enter the world of music. Sandi Hammond was also part of a Boston-based children's choir when she was younger. Hammond went on to study music composition, singing, and piano at Earlham College in the Midwest. She also became steeped in the school‚Äôs underlying mission for social justice, but did not foresee a future career combining her two passions.  Music career  After graduating, Hammond undertook a corporate sales job, before deciding to begin a career in music. Her debut album Rubbergirl, was released in 2003, and her second album, This Summer Night, followed in 2005, receiving critical acclaim from publications such as the Boston Herald.Gewertz, D. (2001, June 22). Singer finds her voice on 'Magazine Street'. Boston Herald, p. s30. Hammond has made appearances on WERS and WGBH radio and has toured small acoustic venues on the East Coast. As a member of the jazz vocal trio, ESP, Hammond has also appeared at notable jazz club, Regattabar and on WGBH's prestigious jazz show, Eric in the Evening. Hammond began teaching music, mindfulness, and meditation, and spent time keeping up to date with the Transgender Alliance Facebook Page. She was shocked by information she found on the page; for example, that transgender people are four times more likely to live in extreme poverty. In order to help, Hammond decided to create a choir specifically for the trans community.  Butterfly Music Transgender Chorus  When she formed the Butterfly Music Transgender Chorus, Hammond was a major donor. Later, the Arts & Business Council of Greater Boston began serving as fiscal sponsor. The group quickly grew to 35 members, who rehearsed at a church in Cambridge. The chorus also received a high level of media interest, much of which focused on Hammond, including articles and interviews in O, The Oprah Magazine, WBUR, AP News, and ABC News. The chorus included trans women, trans men, and others who identified as nonbinary, agender, 3rd gender, intersex, trans masculine and trans feminine. The group was important for transgender singers, because most of its music was written for singers who do not fit into specific range categories, such as soprano or baritone. Since Butterfly's formation, between four and seven transgender choruses have formed around the US. At least one of them, the Transfinity KC Chorus in Kansas City, claims to have been directly inspired by the launch of Butterfly. The Butterfly Music Transgender Chorus does not exist anymore. After two sold-out debut concerts in downtown Boston, Hammond stepped down in October 2016. This was the result of an intense debate about the impact of media exposure on the group and he fact that she herself is not trans. A small group of volunteers continued a self-led, volunteer song-circle for several months under the new name, Boston Trans Chorus.  Research  During the course of her work as a vocal coach for transgender singers, Hammond made two important discoveries that she outlined in the 13th chapter of the book, Voice and Communication Therapy for the Transgender/Transsexual Client, edited by Richard Kenneth Adler, Sandy Hirsch, and Jack Pickering. Based on vocal range evaluations from over 50 trans men, who chose to take testosterone, Hammond discovered that the majority of their voices only deepened to A2, which is considered a baritone range, between tenor and bass. All but one trans man in the Butterfly Music Transgender Chorus gained enough notes to be considered a true bass (with a range that extended an additional 4th). Therefore, most trans men who elect to go on testosterone only gain about a 5th in range (usually from E3 to A2). Trans men also reported having to \\"re-learn\\" pitch-matching and sight-singing. This observation has implications for neurolinguistics and other research about how the brain learns to match pitch. One trans man explained, \\"before, as a soprano, I could sightread anything. Now, I have to re-learn how to think a note and then execute.\\" Many trans men in the choir used the Tunable app during rehearsals, which was originally designed for guitar tuning, to create an immediate feedback loop as they re-learned to match pitch.

In that race Aloma's Ruler beat some of the top three- year-olds competing on the U. S. East Coast including Deputy Minister. A week later the colt injured an ankle during a workout and would not race again until the end of April when he ran second in an allowance race. Just one week before the Preakness, Aloma's Ruler was scheduled to run in the Withers Stakes, a mile race at Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens, New York. However, trainer John Lenzini had not been able to secure Cordero or any of the other top jockeys he had wanted when Jack Kaenel's agent convinced Lenzini to give his good young jockey the mount.

For Aloma's Ruler, the Preakness would be the colt's third race in just seventeen days but his sire, Iron Ruler, was a proven producer of very durable runners. Race day, the Pimlico track was fast and the field had just seven starters. Aloma's Ruler drew the seventh and outside post position. The overwhelming race favorite was Jane du Pont Lunger's colt Linkage. This come-from-behind stretch runner was ridden by the then fifty-year-old Bill Shoemaker, a Hall of Fame jockey who had won more races and more purse money than any jockey in American racing history. When the gate opened, Aloma's Ruler broke from the gate and started to turn right but jockey Kaenel immediately straightened the colt out then angled him left and began quickly passing the field to take the lead where he set the slower pace he wanted. Aloma's Ruler remained in front and at the head of the homestretch he had a length a 1¬Ω length lead. At that point, sixteen-year-old Jack Kaenel's slower pace strategy left Aloma's Ruler with enough stamina to withstand the hard charging Linkage and win by half a length.

She was one of many Cambodian musicians believed to have perished during the Khmer Rouge regime starting in 1975. History Little is known of Pou Vannary's life and history, and her music career was very short. She was a late entrant in the thriving Cambodian rock and pop music scene of the 1960s and 70s, which initially had been fostered by Head of State Norodom Sihanouk. That scene was first influenced by French and Latin American pop records that had been imported into Cambodia, and later by Western rock and roll and soul music via U.S. armed forces radio that had been broadcast to troops stationed nearby during the Vietnam War. Vannary was profiled in the 2015 documentary film on the history of Cambodian pop music, Don't Think I've Forgotten. According to research conducted for the film, Vannary was somewhat unusual among other female Cambodian pop singers of her time, due to her relaxed vocal style and ability to accompany herself on acoustic guitar in the mode of an American singer-songwriter.John Pirozzi and LinDa Saphan, liner notes, Don't Think I've Forgotten, soundtrack, 2015. She could also speak English and specialized in translated versions of American/British pop songs. Her most widely-known recording today is a cover of James Taylor‚Äôs \\"You've Got a Friend\\" with Khmer lyrics. Like many of her contemporaries in Cambodian popular music, Vannary's career ended abruptly when the Khmer Rouge gained control of the country in April 1975 and forced city dwellers to become farm workers to fulfill their visions of agrarian socialism and the eradication of all foreign influences (including music) from Cambodian society. Vannary disappeared during the ensuing Cambodian genocide and her exact fate is unknown. Few of her recordings have survived due to the chaos of the Khmer Rouge regime. Her rendition of \\"You‚Äôve Got a Friend\\" appeared on the soundtrack to Don't Think I've Forgotten in 2015, and a few more of her songs have appeared on compilations like the 2011 CD Cambodia Rock Spectacular! from Lion Productions.

It is located in the Okanogan National Forest on the shared border of Okanogan County and Chelan County. It is situated south of Early Winters Spires, Liberty Bell Mountain, and Washington Pass. Blue Lake is set below its west slope, and Stiletto Peak is to its south. Blue Lake Peak can be seen from the North Cascades Highway at the Blue Lake Trailhead. Precipitation runoff from Blue Lake Peak drains into tributaries of the Chelan River and Methow River. Climate Blue Lake Peak centered, seen from Maple Pass Trail Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Sunset on Blue Lake Peak The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

His research uses brain imaging to learn about the progression of pathology in Alzheimer's disease, and to test potential new treatments for this disease. Alzheimer‚Äôs disease research van Dyck created the Yale Alzheimer‚Äôs Research Unit in 1992, performing research on Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and related cognitive disorders. He has helped to pioneer the use of SPECT and PET imaging to learn about brain alterations related to cognitive and behavioral changes in Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease and the aging brain, and to test potential treatments for Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease. Using SPECT imaging of the Dopamine transporter, van Dyck‚Äôs work has shown that there is loss of dopamine from the aging striatum, and that this is related to a slowing of reaction time, a measure of mental chronometry. van Dyck uses PET imaging to track Alzheimer‚Äôs-related pathology, to learn how pathology relates to ApoEApoE genotype, and whether it is diminished by potential treatments. Dr. van Dyck has collaborated with Dr. Richard Carson at the Yale PET Center to test the new PET ligand 11C-UCB-J, which binds to SV2A to provide an assay of presynaptic axon terminals in the human brain. Studies of this ligand in early Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease patients have shown a loss of synapses from the perforant path, the connections between the entorhinal cortex and hippocampal formation needed for memory consolidation. van Dyck and the Yale ADRU have tested potential Alzheimer‚Äôs therapeutics for over 20 years. They have contributed to the successful development of memantine now in use for the treatment of mid- late stage Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease, and assess potential new therapeutic strategies, e.g. antibodies that reduce amyloid pathology such as Crenezumab, and based on the work of Dr. Stephen Strittmatter, an inhibitor of fyn. Dr. van Dyck serves on the Steering Committees of the National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). He serves as co-Director of the Yale Alzheimer's Disease Research Center with Dr. Strittmatter, and is Director of the Division of Aging and Geriatric Psychiatry at Yale. Dr. van Dyck is the Chair of the Medical and Scientific Advisory Council of the Connecticut chapter of the Alzheimer‚Äôs Association. He received the \\"Compassion and Cure\\" Award from the Alzheimer's Association in 2005. Chess Chris was an avid Correspondence Chess player. In 1992, Chris won the International Correspondence Chess Federation title International Correspondence Chess Master, winning the 1979 Absolute.

On August 6, 2018, James enrolled at Crossroads School, a private K‚Äì12 school in Santa Monica, California. California state rules prevented him from immediately joining the varsity team because he was in eighth grade.

On November 21, 2019, James made his high school debut, scoring 10 points off the bench in a blowout win over Montgomery High School. On December 14, James scored 15 points, including a go-ahead layup, and was named game most valuable player (MVP) in a victory over his father's alma mater, St. Vincent‚ÄìSt. Mary High School. On January 15, 2020, he scored a season-high 17 points in a win over Viewpoint School. As a freshman, James averaged 4.1 points in 15 minutes per game and was Sierra Canyon's only player to appear in all 34 games of the season. =Recruiting= When James was nine years old, Ohio State Buckeyes coach Thad Matta joked, \\"He'll be on the recruiting radar... I need to offer him a scholarship.\\" In February 2015, it was revealed that James had already received basketball scholarship offers from colleges, although the specific names were not announced. His father commented, \\"It should be a violation, you shouldn't be recruiting 10-year-old kids.\\" In June 2016, ESPN reported that he held offers to play college basketball for Kentucky and Duke. LeBron James suggested that Bronny would play for Duke in a November 2018 tweet. In October 2020, 247Sports.com reported that James was projected to commit to Duke. Player profile James stands and can play the point guard and shooting guard positions. He has a \\"smooth shooting stroke\\" and is an adept ball handler and passer. Scouts have additionally commended his \\"feel for the game\\" and poise on the basketball court. Personal life James has a younger brother Bryce, born in 2007, and a younger sister Zhuri, born in 2014. His godfather is basketball player Chris Paul, who is a ten-time NBA All-Star.

It is located in T√ºrnich in the city of Kerpen, Rhein-Erft-Kreis, North Rhine-Westphalia. It is owned by the Van Hoensbroeck family, currently Godehard count von und zu Hoensbroech. In the outbuilding, there is a cafe.  History  Already in the middle ages, there was a moated castle in T√ºrnich. It was already mentioned in 898. A knight called 'Winandus de Tornich' was mentioned in 1208. The current rococo mansion was constructed between 1757 and 1766 for Freiherr Carl-Ludwig von Rolshausen. Freiherr Georg-Karl von Rolshausen sells the manor to Reichsgraf Karl Eugen von und zu Hoensbroech in 1850. Open-cast mining in the region has significantly lowered the levels of groundwater around the mansion (80 centimetres to even 2.8 metres on a certain moment), which has caused substantial damage to the main house. in 1979, the family had to move out of the house. With help of the local government of North Rhine-Westphalia, the city of Kerpen and Deutsche Stiftung Denkmalschutz restoration started in 2009. The colour on the facade has been renewed. And the von und zu Hoensbroech family is investigating how they can safe the house for the future.  Design and architecture  Presumably, the French court architect of the Electorate of Cologne, Michael Leveilly has been the designer of the mansion. The manor is a typical Maison de plaisance. The design is very similar to J√§gerhof Palace in D√ºsseldorf as well as to Falkenlust Palace in Br√ºhl - designed by Fran√ßois de Cuvilli√©s. The Neo-Romanesque chapel is constructed in 1895 and dedicated to Elizabeth of Hungary. The mansion is surrounded by a baroque park, which is open to visitors.

History In 1838, Richard Lawrence DeZeng (1788‚Äì1848), a retired engineer and canal builder from Oswego, New York, bought the 220-acre property in Skaneateles for $12,000. In the same year, Nicholas Roosevelt and his wife, Lydia Latrobe Roosevelt (daughter of architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe), also retired to Skaneateles. The first foundation stone was laid in May 1839. DeZeng hired George Casey of Auburn, New York to construct the 25-room Greek Revival mansion at a cost of $18,000 (with an additional $11,000 spent on interior furnishings). The DeZengs call the home, Lake Home. The home may be the work of Ithiel Town, the partner of Alexander Jackson Davis, who designed the nearby 1852 home of Reuel E. Smith, also in Skaneateles. =Ownership= In September 1849, the home and 113.78 of the original remaining acres were sold by DeZeng's estate (who died in 1848) to John Legg for $10,000. A month later, in October, Legg sold the house to farmer Peter Whittlesey for $10,500. Whittlesey owned the home for eight years and further subdivided the property. In March 1857, Whittlesey sold the home to New York City jewelry manufacturer Seth W. Hale for $9,000. In August 1858, Hale sold the home to Anson H. Lapham (1804‚Äì1876) for $8,000. Lapham, a wealthy leather trader, was from a large and prominent family. He was the uncle of New York State Senator Nathan Lapham and was a cousin of Susan B. Anthony (his paternal aunt, Hannah Lapham Anthony, was Susan's grandmother), who visited the home frequently with fellow suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton. After Lapham's death in 1876, he left the home to his second wife, Amie Ann (n√©e Frost) Willetts Lapham (1816‚Äì1893). In November 1878, two years after Lapham's death, his widow sold the home to her son (from her first marriage), William Russell Willetts (1842‚Äì1917) for $20,000. In 1887, the Skaneateles Country Club was established and located just down the street from the residence. In September 1892, Willetts sold the home to Edward Macomber Padelford (1857‚Äì1921) who referred to the home as Lakota, for $20,000. With his first wife, Florence McPheeters, Edward was the father of Florence Burne Padelford, who married Robert Grosvenor, 3rd Baron Ebury in 1908. His second wife was Fannie (n√©e Smythe) Woolsey, the sister of New York society matriarch Helen Smythe Jaffray, and the two spent much time abroad, leading Padelford to sell the property in 1899. =Roosevelt years= Samuel Montgomery Roosevelt. In 1899, Padelford sold it to his friend, the artist Samuel Montgomery Roosevelt (1857‚Äì1920), a grandson of Nicholas Roosevelt and a second cousin of President Theodore Roosevelt. Padelford and Roosevelt were both members of the New York Yacht Club and the Knickerbocker Club. He used it as a summer home, with his main residence being 1032 Fifth Avenue in New York City. Roosevelt was married to Augusta Eccleston (n√©e Shoemaker) Boylston. In 1905, her daughter, aspiring actress Augusta Boylston was married to attorney Donald Campbell, son of Major General John Campbell, at St. James Episcopal Church in Skaneateles and the reception was held at Roosevelt Hall. In 1906, Roosevelt hired architect Gaggin & Gaggin to renovate the property, which included taking out the painted woodwork on the first floor and finishing all the rooms and halls with white quartered oak. Elaborate wainscoting, panel work, and a new staircase were added at this time. Roosevelt, who entertained extensively at the home (cousin Theodore visited in 1915), died in 1920. In his will, instead of leaving the home to his widow, he left it to his nephew, Col. Henry Latrobe \\"Harry\\" Roosevelt (1879‚Äì1936). Henry was married to Eleanor Morrow, daughter of William W. Morrow, a Judge and U.S. Representative. In 1923, the Roosevelts entertain Don Juan Ria√±o y Gayangos, the Spanish Ambassador to the U.S. during the reign of Alfonso XIII of Spain, at Roosevelt Hall. In 1930, then Governor of New York, Franklin D. Roosevelt, along with his wife Eleanor and son John, stop to visit and have lunch at the Hall. In 1932, Franklin visits again, this time while running for president. After he wins the presidency, Franklin appoints Harry Assistant Secretary of the Navy, a role he serves in until his death in 1936. After Harry's death, the home passed to his eldest son, Maj. William Morrow Roosevelt (1906‚Äì1983). William, who owned the house while serving with the U.S. Military in Guam, sold the home in 1944 to William H. Delevan. =Later owners= In 1961, Delevan sold the home to Kenneth M. Dunning, who developed Lake View Circle and sold a portion of the estate to Thomas Rich in 1963. Reportedly, Robert F. Kennedy considered buying the house when he was running for the U.S. Senate in 1964. In 1967, Dunning sold Roosevelt Hall to Dennis Owen, who, in 1974, built a separate home for himself on the property and donated the mansion to the De La Salle Christian Brothers. The home was later transferred to the Franciscan Friars in 2001. In 2007, the home reverted to Owen, who sold it to current owners, Mary and Peter Drescher, who use it as their summer home.

Taxonomy and etymology It was described as a new species in 2006. The holotype was collected in Marovaza, Madagascar, which inspired its species name. Description It is relatively small for its genus. Its forearm is approximately long. Biology and ecology It has been found roosting in the palm-leave thatching of small huts. It roosts singly or in small colonies of up to five individuals. It navigates and locates prey via echolocation; its calls have a frequency of maximum energy of 43.8-48 kHz and a maximum frequency of 58-72.6 kHz. Echolocation pulses last 6-8 seconds. Individuals can be infected with Leptospira. Range and habitat The Marovaza house bat is endemic to western Madagascar. It is currently known from lowland areas of above sea level. Conservation As of 2017, it is evaluated as a least-concern species by the IUCN. It met the criteria for this classification because of its relatively large geographic range and its ability to tolerate some habitat destruction.

It is located in Geldern in the district of Kleve, North Rhine- Westphalia. It is owned by the Van Hoensbroeck family.  History  It is in 1337 that the castle is mentioned for the first time. The Van Hoensbroeck family acquired the castle in 1613 and it became their main residence instead of Hoensbroek Castle itself. The family still owns it. The castle had many famous visitors like the Prussian king Frederick the Great, the French emperor Napoleon in 1804, the Russian emperor Alexander I of Russia in 1814, and William I, German Emperor in 1863. The castle is today the home of the Hoensbroech family and the center of a golf club.  Description  The castle consisted of a manor house and two outer buildings. The manor house has been rebuilt in baroque style between 1662 and 1664, and in neo-gothic style in 1876/ 1877. Unfortunately, the manor house has been destroyed by an allied bombing in the second world war. Today only the outer buildings remain. A description of the life of the fervently Ultramontane noble family in the castle in the second half of the 19th century is given in the translation by Alice Zimmern of Count Paul von Hoensbroech's autobiography.Forty Years a Jesuit, English translation by Alice Zimmern, Cassell & Co., vol. 1, 1911.

Shortly after becoming airborne, the plane encountered sudden wind shear caused by a microburst. The plane rapidly lost speed and altitude and impacted the runway, detaching the engines and skidding to a halt about beyond the runway. The plane caught fire and was destroyed. All 103 people on board survived, but 39 passengers and crew members were injured. A final report on the crash was released on February 23, 2019. Investigators found that the primary cause of the accident was adverse weather conditions encountered by the flight, and contributing factors included crew error, air traffic controller error, and the lack of equipment that could detect wind shear conditions at airports. Investigators determined that an unauthorized student pilot in the cockpit who was flying the plane during the takeoff caused the crew to be distracted, leading to a loss of situational awareness. The crew failed to react to dangerous weather conditions that were developing, and did not notice irregularities in the airspeed indicators that could have alerted them to potential hazards. The sole air traffic controller on duty at the airport at the time also failed to notify the aircraft of rapidly deteriorating weather conditions. The accident and the subsequent investigation led to changes in Mexican aviation regulations to prevent unassigned crew members from being present in the cockpit of an aircraft at any time during a flight. Investigators also made several recommendations for changes in flight crew and air traffic controller training, and to improve the capabilities of weather detection equipment in place at airports to improve overall aviation safety. Accident The flight, number 2431, was operated by Aerom√©xico Connect and was a regularly scheduled flight from Durango International Airport to Mexico City International Airport. Originally scheduled to leave at 2:56p.m. Central Time (UTC‚àí06:00), the departure was slightly delayed when the first officer observed a fuel leak from the number one engine and asked maintenance crews to investigate. Crews eventually concluded that the rate of leakage was within safe limits. The aircraft left the gate at 3:14p.m. and headed toward the end of runway 03. As the plane taxied, rain started to fall with increasing intensity, accompanied by strong gusts of wind. At 3:18p.m., the air traffic controller reported winds from 90 degrees. The flight information service for the airport published an updated weather report at 3:18p.m. indicating the presence of thunderstorms and rain, reduced visibility, and the presence of cumulonimbus clouds. The air traffic controller did not see this update because he was working alone and was attending to Flight 2431. The rain became so heavy that the tower could not see the runway. Even though the controller was in the best position to see the deteriorating weather conditions, he did not inform the aircraft about any of his observations. The flight was cleared for takeoff at 3:21p.m. Severe wind gusts caused several trees to become uprooted at the airport, knocking down power and communication lines. A special weather update was sent out by the flight information service at 3:22p.m. warning of thunderstorms and rain, 0 feet of visibility and a decrease in the ceiling to 0 feet, but this report was never received by the tower controller due to the power outage. The aircraft proceeded down the runway. After it reached a speed of , the pilot flying the plane rotated the controls to bring the aircraft airborne, and raised the gear when the craft was 2 feet above the runway. The plane began its takeoff with a headwind, but the winds quickly shifted to a right crosswind of , increasing to as the plane proceeded down the runway. The plane had reached its maximum altitude of about and a maximum indicated airspeed of when the wind direction suddenly shifted to a tailwind. The plane rapidly lost airspeed and altitude, and an audible alarm of \\"DON'T SINK\\" sounded in the cockpit. Five seconds later, the left wing struck the runway, and both engines broke away from the wings. The plane skidded off the runway and came to rest about beyond the end of the runway. All 103 people on board the plane were able to evacuate and survived the crash before a fire broke out that destroyed the aircraft. Aircraft The aircraft was an Embraer 190, registration XA-GAL, msn 19000173. It was first delivered to US Airways in 2008 as N960UW before being sold to Republic Airways Holdings in 2009. Under Republic Airways ownership, the aircraft was re-registered as N167HQ, operating for Midwest Airlines, a former subsidiary of Republic, and later for fellow Republic subsidiary (at the time) Frontier Airlines, until late 2013. After Republic retired its Embraer 190 aircraft from its operations, Republic then leased N167HQ to Aerom√©xico Connect in 2014, who registered the aircraft as XA-GAL. At the time of its loss, the aircraft had flown a total of 27,257 hours, and had 18,200 takeoff and landing cycles. When it was originally manufactured, the aircraft was equipped with a Honeywell WU-880 weather radar. This system can detect storms along the flight path of the aircraft and give pilots a visual indication of the intensity of the storm. The aircraft was also equipped with a wind shear detection and escape guidance system that can detect wind shear conditions and alert the pilots using a combination of visual and audio alarms. The audio alarms are disabled in the event of a higher priority audio alarm, such as the ground proximity sensor alarm. Crew The pilot in command of the flight was 38-year-old Carlos Galv√°n Meyran, a resident of Mexico City. He held an airline transport pilot licence and had been working at Aerom√©xico since 2010, as a pilot since 2011. He had a total of 3,700 logged flight hours at the time of the crash. Galv√°n completed his captain training for the Embraer E-Jet series in June 2017 and had logged 1,064 hours in the type. He occupied the left-hand seat in the cockpit during the flight, and suffered serious injuries in the accident, requiring hip and spine surgery which doctors called successful. The assigned first officer, Daniel Dardon Ch√°vez, held an airline transport pilot licence and had a total of 1,973 logged flight hours, including 460 hours on the Embraer 190 aircraft. He was 25 years old at the time of the accident and was originally from Metepec, State of Mexico. He had become certified to copilot this type of aircraft in February 2018. He received minor injuries in the crash. During the flight, he was occupying the jump seat in the back of the cockpit instead of the right-hand seat normally occupied by the first officer. Another pilot who flew for the airline, Jos√© Ram√≥n V√°zquez, was also in the cockpit. He held a commercial pilot license and had a total of 3,296 logged flight hours. He was certified to fly the Beechcraft King Air F90 and Beechcraft Super King Air 200 aircraft. He was in the process of receiving training to fly the E-Jets, but as of the time of the flight, he had only received initial classroom instruction, and had completed 64 hours of simulator time, and had not yet received his certification. He had no experience on the Embraer E190 aircraft. At the time of the flight, he occupied the right-hand seat in the cockpit normally occupied by the copilot, and was the pilot flying the plane until the last five seconds before the crash, when captain Galv√°n took control. V√°zquez received minor injuries in the crash. Two female flight attendants were in the main cabin. The senior flight attendant had been employed by the airline since June 2012 and suffered a fractured lumbar vertebra. The junior flight attendant had been employed by the airline for about a week and received minor injuries in the crash. Passengers The plane departed with 98 passengers and 5 crew members. Two of the passengers were airline employees being shuttled between locations, including the pilot in training who was in the cockpit. Of the passengers, excluding the pilot in training, 31 were Mexican citizens, 65 were United States citizens, 1 was a Spanish citizen, and 1 was a Colombian citizen. Aftermath Immediately after the crash, passengers reported seeing smoke and flames as they rushed to escape the plane. Some passengers said that a door had been torn off and that plane's fuselage had broken in two, allowing them to jump directly out of a gap in the side of the aircraft. The crew was able to open the emergency exit slides and safely evacuate all of the occupants within 90 seconds. About three to four minutes after coming to a stop, and after all passengers had been evacuated, the aircraft exploded and was engulfed in flames. The air traffic controller attempted to contact the aircraft, and when it received no response he contacted the approach sector controller to see if they were in contact with the aircraft. The controller dispatched an airport service vehicle to inspect the runway. The driver saw the aircraft's engines at the side of the runway and smoke rising from beyond the runway. Airport officials activated the emergency operation center at the airport, and dispatched firefighters to assist with the rescue and to extinguish the fire. After reports about the crash came in, Aerom√©xico sent a team to Durango to provide assistance to affected passengers and their families. The company announced that it would cover all medical, accommodation, transportation, and incidental expenses resulting from the crash. It praised the actions of the crew and said that the crew's quick and efficient evacuation of the plane was instrumental in avoiding additional serious injuries and fatalities. It also said that the pilot's expertise and professionalism had prevented the loss of life in the accident. Different sources gave conflicting reports about the number of injuries from the incident. The Ministry of Health initially reported that there were 18 passengers injured. The Red Cross said there were 97 injuries. The governor of Durango told media that 49 people had been treated for injuries at hospitals. Two days after the crash, Aerom√©xico reported that 17 passengers were still hospitalized, 16 were in the process of being released, and 24 had already been released from medical care. The final official accident report stated that there were 14 serious injuries and 25 minor injuries. About a month after the crash, Aerom√©xico announced that the three pilots who were in the cockpit that day had been fired from the company. It said that while it did not feel that the crash was the fault of the pilots, they had violated company procedures by not following their assigned roles during the flight by allowing the trainee pilot to take control of the aircraft. The labor union representing the pilots protested the termination, saying that the decision was carried out based only on a preliminary accident report, and that a full investigation into the accident was still ongoing. Shortly afterward, Mexico's Directorate General of Civil Aeronautics (DGAC) issued a change in regulations that prohibited airlines from allowing inactive pilots and flight attendants from flying in the cockpit of aircraft. Aerom√©xico pilots opposed this change and called for a strike, viewing the sudden removal of a travel benefit as a violation of their collective bargaining agreement between the union and the airline. After negotiations, the union representing the pilots agreed to a change in the agreement, where all non-working flight crews will have reserved seats in the main cabin, and continue to be denied access to the cockpit. Investigation Illustration of a microburst. The air moves in a downward motion until it hits ground level. It then spreads outward in all directions. Shortly after the crash, the DGAC announced that it had formed commission to investigate the crash. The commission received assistance from the US National Transportation Safety Board and the US Federal Aviation Administration. Additional assistance was provided by Embraer SA, who had built the aircraft, and General Electric Co., who had built the engines on the aircraft. Investigators quickly located the flight data recorders for the aircraft and found them to be in perfect condition. On September 5, a little over a month after the accident, Jos√© Armando Constantino Tercero, the lead investigator from the DGAC, announced that the final conclusion had not yet been reached, but that the cause of the accident appeared to be sudden wind shear from a microburst. He said that the pilots had not received any notice of the adverse conditions prior to starting the takeoff, and that neither human nor mechanical failure appeared to be to blame for the crash. He also said that analysis of the cockpit voice recorder revealed that an unauthorized pilot training was taking place during the flight, and that the trainee pilot had been occupying the copilot seat and flying the plane until shortly before the crash. This was not in accordance with aviation regulations, and he said that administrative proceedings had been initiated. Nevertheless, he stressed that neither the presence nor the actions of any of the pilots caused the accident. Shortly afterward, the airline announced that it had fired the three pilots who were in the cockpit of the flight. The investigators conducted a series of flight tests in full flight simulators in Mexico and Brazil using the same weather conditions that existed at the time of the flight, with crews with similar levels of experience as the crew of Flight 2431. The simulator crews were not given advance notice of the situation that they were about to encounter. In one situation, the flight crew turned on the weather radar, recognized the signs of wind shear from the variations and visual cues on the instruments, and successfully aborted the takeoff. In a second scenario, the wind shear weather conditions were not loaded into the simulator until after the takeoff roll had started. In that case, the simulated flight reached a maximum altitude of about before losing altitude and impacted the ground with the landing gear. The simulator group concluded that because the crew did not notice the presence of wind shear during the takeoff, they could not have been able to recover the aircraft in time to avoid the accident. = Final report = On February 23, 2019, the final report was released. It concluded that the accident was caused by \\"impact with the runway caused by a loss of control of the airplane during the final phase of takeoff as a result of wind shear at low altitude which caused a loss of speed and altitude.\\" The investigation found no mechanical malfunctions in the aircraft that led to the accident. The report identified contributing factors to the accident caused by the flight crew. One factor was that the pilot of the plane, who was not a certified instructor, was giving an instruction to a student pilot who was flying the plane at the time. This caused a loss of situational awareness and the pilots did not maintain a \\"sterile cockpit\\", one that was free from distractions. It found that among other mistakes, the pilot and the student pilot failed to notice that the airspeed indicator on the pilot's side was giving different information than the airspeed indicator on the copilot's side, which could have provided information about the dangerous weather conditions at the time. Additionally, it found that the pilots failed to follow standard operating procedures during the flight, including configuring the aircraft for the weather conditions that it encountered immediately before and during the takeoff. Investigators also identified contributing factors from the air traffic controller. The report said that the tower controller failed to follow proper procedures that were in place for when the weather conditions created the possibility of low altitude wind shear. It faulted the controller for failing to inform the departing flight about the rapidly deteriorating visibility and changes in wind speed and direction, and it said that the controller did not have adequate supervision and assistance in the air traffic control tower. The investigation made several recommendations to the airline to prevent similar accidents from happening in the future. It said that the airline should make changes to its operating procedures to prevent a person who is not an assigned crew member from taking the controls of the aircraft during any phase of that flight. It recommended additional training to air crews on sterile cockpit procedure, to ensure that crews are able to maintain full awareness of the aircraft and external conditions. It also recommended additional training on how to recognize potential wind shear situations in storms and how to address those situations during flight. It recommended training on the use of maximum thrust during takeoff, the verification of the aircraft configuration for the current weather conditions, and the active monitoring of airspeed, altitude, and vertical speed instruments during takeoff. It recommended changes to procedures to identify and resolve situations where there is a disagreement between flight instruments, and procedures for establish a safe altitude before for raising the landing gear. Because the commission found that incorrect barometric pressures had been entered into the flight control computer of the aircraft, it recommended additional care be exercised by flight crews in keeping track of the information that it receives from air traffic control to guarantee that the information used for the flight is correct. The third pilot had been listed as a passenger, but his absence from the passenger compartment had not been noted the flight attendants. The commission recommended that the airline revise its cabin crew operating procedures to identify and address situations where passengers are not in their expected place on the plane. The commission also made recommendations to the airport operator and to the Mexican civil aviation agency. It said that the air traffic controllers should not operate alone and that there should be additional personnel to receive and communicate adverse weather conditions to aircraft. It found that the DGAC had not published guidelines on how to recognize wind shear situations, or the hazards of wind shear in different types of storms, so it recommended that the DGAC develop a program to identify and classify the level of risk in storms. It also found that the airport did not have equipment to detect the presence of wind shear, so it recommended that the agency implement a program to install facilities to detect variations in the longitudinal, lateral, and vertical direction of winds so that they can be included in navigational aids. It recommended that airports identify and eliminate risks that can interrupt power, voice communications, and data communications in the control towers. Finally, the investigation found that CCTV cameras that had been installed at the airport were helpful during the investigation, but it was hampered by the lack of time stamps on the video, so it recommended that all cameras in place at airports include time stamps on the recordings.

Early life Before joining the services of Shivaji, Annaji Datto was a Kulkarni of Sangameshwar. He joined Shivaji's administration in 1660. Career Annaji Datto was a Minister of Shivaji, who carried out a survey known as Annaji Datto's Dhara. According to Subhasad Bhakhar, the Maratha Empire of Shivaji was divided into three parts, each under a cabinet minister, called a Sarkarkun. Annaji Datto Sachiv, Moropant Trimbak Pingle, and Dattoji Pant were appointed sarkarkun.Kulkarni, A.R., 1990, January. Maratha Swarajya: Its Extent and Income. In Proceedings of the Indian History Congress (Vol. 51, pp. 321-325). Indian History Congress. As sarkarkun, Annaji Datto controlled the Konkan territory, including Choul. Dabhol, Rajapur, Kudal, Bande, Phonda, and Koppal. This division between territories was called Talghat or Southern division. In 1667, Shivaji appointed Annaji to the task of land revenue reform in areas under the Swarajya. Annaji's efforts led to a new system of lower government claim on farm produce of 2/5.His work involved accurate land measurement, bringing new land under cultivation, measures to reduce exploitation of the illiterate cultivators by the hereditary officials such as the Patil and Kulkarni.Kulkarni, G. T., 1976. Land Revenue and Agricultural Policy of Shivaji ‚Äì An Appraisal. Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute, 35(3/4), pp.73-82. =Campaign on Panhala and Pawangad= Annaji Datto was assigned the job of capturing the Panhala fort before the Afzal episode. In 1659, Annaji captured the Panhala fort and Pawangad fort from the Mughals. = Conflict with Sambhaji = Shivaji's eldest son and presumptive heir, Sambhaji, was sent to the fort of Panhala by his father, who disapproved of his habits. However, in December 1678 Sambhaji left the fort and defected to the Mughals for a year, but then returned home when he learnt of a plan by Dilir Khan, the Mughal viceroy of Deccan to arrest him and send him to Delhi. Upon returning home, Sambhaji was unrepentant and was again put under surveillance at Panhala by his father. However, Shivaji soon fell ill and died in April 1680. The news of Shivaji's death reached Sambhaji at Panhala within eleven days. Conspiracy with Soyarabai At the time of Shivaji's death, Annaji conspired with Shivaji's widow, Soyarabai to lure the Council of ministers (ashtapradhan mandal), into electing her then ten year old younger son Rajaram to the throne of Maratha swarajya with Soyarabai as the regent. On 21 April 1680, arrangements were made to make Rajaram's position secure. The coronation of Rajaram I was performed by Annaji Datto and a few of Rajaram's supporters. Soyarabai and Minister's proposed Sambhaji for the division of the Maratha Empire. When their proposal of the division of the Swarajya was turned down by Sambhaji, the adherents of the cause of Rajaram, Peshwa Moropant Pingle, Annaji Datto and others marched against Sambhaji. However, Sambhaji quickly won over the support of the Maratha army. He arrested those who had marched against him on the way to Panhala between 19 May and 2 June 1680. Sambhaji marched on Raigad and gained possession of the capital on 18 June 1680. He promptly put Rajaram, Soyarabai in close confinement. Execution Annaji and other ministers involved in the conspiracy were arrested and either executed or confined. Annaji was however released after a period. Later in 1681 when Prince Akbar, Aurangzeb's rebel son was given asylum by Sambhaji, Annaji and several members of the Shirke clan (of Yesubai) promised the Deccan to Akbar in exchange for leaving a small kingdom for Rajaram. Akbar refused to be a party to this conspiracy and betrayed these conspirators to Sambhaji who quickly executed Annaji, his brother Somaji, a large number of the Asthapradhan members and members of the Shirke family in August 1681.Kincaid, C.A. and Parasnis, D.B., 1922.

She is also noted for her leadership in broadening participation in computing. Biography DesJardins grew up in Columbia, Maryland. She received an A. B. in Engineering and Computer Science from Harvard University in 1985. She received a Ph.D in Computer Science from University of Berkeley in 1992. In 1991 she joined SRI International, working in the Artificial Intelligence Center. In 2001 she joined the Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County as an Assistant Professor.

She left UMBC in 2018 to become the Founding Dean of the College of Organizational, Computational, and Information Sciences at Simmons College in Boston. Career DesJardins has explored the effect of the network topology on the efficiency of team formation in multi-agent systems, showing that scale-free networks are often the most effective topologies for facilitating team formation and leading to the development of learning methods for agents to adapt their behavioral strategies. She has shown the first approach to trust modeling that explicitly separates the effect of competence (that is, the degree to which an agent is able to carry out its commitments) and integrity (that is, the degree to which an agent is actually committed to complete its part of a joint action) on decision making. This framework was later extended to incorporate reputation (indirect observations provided by third-party agents, with applications to online rating systems and supply chain formation. In many domains, when a set of items is presented as a collection, interactions between the items may increase (due to complementarity) or decrease (due to redundancy or incompatibility) the quality of the set as a whole. Although this ‚Äúportfolio effect‚Äù had occasionally been mentioned in the literature, this work was the first to address this problem a general way, by modeling the tradeoff between the ‚Äúdepth‚Äù of the set (i.e., which characteristics of the individual items are seen as more or less desirable) and its ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù (i.e., how broadly or narrowly distributed the objects in the set are over their possible range). This work presented a heuristic method for taking advantage of taxonomies, or hierarchies of values, in Bayesian network learning by searching for the most effective level of abstraction within the taxonomy, discovering which distinctions are relevant for the input data, and ignoring the others. This process reduces the number of parameters that must be estimated, and simplifies the representation, while preserving the meaningful distinctions in the domain. This paper, presenting comprehensive advice to help graduate students navigate the process of earning an M.S. or Ph.D. and develop strong mentoring relationships, has been circulated widely to graduate students around the world and has been translated into multiple languages.

After an 1877 fire, the newspaper consolidated with the Chelsea Post, the Vermont News from Bethel, Vermont, and the Green Mountain Herald and was called The Herald and News. It was published in two editions, a four-page paper with only local news, and a slightly more expensive eight-page paper with \\"all the news.\\" The newspaper had separate editions for the towns of Chelsea, Bethel and added editions for Rochester and South Royalton in 1894.

She is known for her work on mathematical neuroscience, including the applications of mathematics in both theoretical and computational neuroscience. Her recent work is funded by the BRAIN Initiative. She is an Associate Editor at SIAGA, a SIAM journal on Applied Algebra and Geometry.  Early life and education  Curto was born to Argentine parents and grew up in Iowa City. She attended Iowa City West High School. During her school years, she attended courses at University of Iowa, including advanced mathematics classes, physics, computer science, French literature, and more. In 1996, she began studying for an A.B. in Physics at Harvard University. During her time at Harvard, she was awarded prizes including the Detur Book Prize, one of Harvard's oldest awards, and the American Physical Society minority scholarship. After graduating from Harvard in 2000 and being awarded the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, Curto started a Ph.D in mathematics at Duke University. Curto's Ph.D focused on mathematical string theory and algebraic geometry. Her thesis was titled 'Matrix Model Superpotentials and Calabi-Yau Spaces: an ADE Classification'.  Career and research  Once Curto gained her Ph.D, she moved to Rutgers University in New Jersey, working as a Postdoctoral Associate in a neuroscience lab at the Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience. After three years at Rutgers, she returned to working in mathematics, focusing on neuroscience from a more mathematical perspective, and moved to the Courant Institute of Mathematics at New York University, then to the University of Nebraska- Lincoln, followed by the Pennsylvania State University. Curto is a Professor of Mathematics, the co-head of their mathematical neuroscience lab, and a member of the Center for Neural Engineering. = Network Connectivity = Her research focuses on the interplay between the connectivity and dynamics of the brain and involves studying neural recordings and analysing the patterns of the activities. This network analysis aims to understand the connections between the neurons and their patterns. Traditionally, neuroscientists rely on tools from physics. But Curto's approach uses tools from pure mathematics, particularly algebraic geometry, which is applied to the activity data of the neurons. Curto's research is significant in the field of connectomics. For instance, one study showed how neural activities can drastically change by slightly changing the structure of the networks, which has implications for the study of brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. Along with Katherine Morrison from the University of Northern Colorado, and with funding from the government's BRAIN Initiative grant and the NSF, Curto is working on Combinatorial Threshold-Linear Networks, CTLNs. These models enable the observations of emergent patterns, such as neuronal sequences and complex rhythms, and can also be used to predict features of the dynamics, something that has been seemingly difficult to predict. Aligned with her research, Curto, alongside Morrison, also created a project called Network Songs, which originally started out as a gimmick. This is a collection of songs, that show the rhythmic activity of the networks. The basis of the songs were created by assigning a note on the piano to each neuron. Curto explains that sometimes certain patterns are better distinguished by the ear, than by the eye, hence the purpose of this particular representation of the network data.  Awards and personal life  Curto has been the recipient of numerous grants and awards, including becoming a Woodrow Wilson National Fellow and an Alfred Sloan Research Fellow. Additionally, in 2012, Curto was named a UNL Academic Star. In March 2018, the American Mathematical Society, AMS, included Curto in a list of 27 female mathematicians in honour of Women's History Month, publishing a profile of her in the AMS Notices journal. Throughout her years as a mathematician, Curto has taken part in many events and boards to promote women in mathematics. This includes being involved with the Women In Math club at UNL and being part of the Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics, NCUWM, organizing committee. Curto is also an amateur tennis player. In 1995, when at high school, she became the Double State Champion. Furthermore, in 1996-1997 she was the Varsity Letter Winner for Women's tennis at Harvard. Curto lives in State College with her husband and two children.

After taking up artwork later in life ‚Äì initially illustrating the personal stories of fellow community members ‚Äì Andrews began exhibiting her paintings in group and solo showings across Australia. She was known for her vividly red landscapes showcasing the mountain ranges of the Great Sandy Desert. In 1994, she received the main Telstra award from the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards (NATSIAA) for her painting Lumpa Lumpa (wet time) landscape. Andrews' work is held in collections owned by the Australian National Gallery, the Museum and Gallery of Northern Territory, the Queensland Art Gallery, the Berndt Museum of Anthropology, the North Australian Research Unit, and the Karrayili Adult Education Centre. A tapestry version of one of her paintings hangs in the Australian Embassy in Tokyo, Japan.  Early life  Moola Bulla cattle station, c. 1951 Munmarria Daisy Andrews was born circa 1934 or 1935 at Cherrabun station. Her parents, Jack Pinden and Ruby Jarlkurr, belonged to the indigenous Walmajarri desert tribe, and when their daughter was born they were in the process of moving north out of the desert, compelled by a combination of drought, conflict between tribes, and the encroachment of water resources by white settlers. Jack Pinden had three wives. Andrews had an elder brother named Boxer Yankarr and a sister. Although Andrews' father attempted to take his family back to their former home in the desert, they were repeatedly obstructed by white police, and Andrews' father was sometimes forced to return to the city in chains. The family was finally sent to the government-run station of Moola Bulla.  Career  After 1981, Andrews began taking classes in reading and writing English at the Karrayili Adult Education Centre. When the men in the class began writing stories about their early memories and family history, Andrews and her fellow female students began illustrating the stories through visual arts, and this soon led Andrews to focus on painting. In 1991, Andrews participated in her first group art show in Adelaide, and two years later her art was featured in the exhibition \\"Images of Power\\" at the National Gallery of Victoria. In 1994, Andrews received the primary Telstra award from the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards (NATSIAA) for her painting Lumpa Lumpa (wet time) landscape. Between 1991 and 2016, her work was featured in over 40 group exhibitions across the country, and she held solo exhibitions at art galleries in Brisbane, Sydney, Perth and Melbourne. In 1996, Andrews painted a 12-metre Great Sandy backdrop for a production of Alcina by the West Australian Opera. Besides the National Gallery of Victoria, Andrews' work can be found in the collections of the Australian National Gallery, the Museum and Gallery of Northern Territory, the Queensland Art Gallery, the Berndt Museum of Anthropology, the North Australian Research Unit, and the Karrayili Adult Education Centre. Her art was chosen by the Australian Tapestry Workshop to be translated into a woven form, and the resulting wool tapestry is displayed in the Australian Embassy in Tokyo, Japan.  Artistic style and subject  A NASA photograph of the Australian Great Sandy Desert. Over the course of her career as an artist, Andrews focused on painting the northern mountain ranges of the Great Sandy Desert. She portrayed the landscape in all seasons and weather. Andrews often painted her landscapes with deep red pigments. She stated that much of her work was inspired by painful family stories of tribal massacres and the destruction of Aboriginal landmarks and sacred spaces: \\"When I paint, I think of blood\\".  Personal life  As a young woman, Andrews met a Bunuba man named Adam Andrews, and the couple began a relationship that led to marriage. Daisy described their feelings for each other as \\"young days love\\". They eventually had eight children. Andrews was a singer as well as a painter. She passed on her knowledge of traditional songs and ceremonies to Australian youth. She co- founded the Kimberley Language Resource Centre and also helped establish the Karrayili Adult Education Centre.  Death  Andrews died in January 2015.

It was originally planned for 1992, but was effectively cancelled after the original proposal was met with fierce backlash and accusations of racism. Background =Originally planned 1992 conference= In 1992, UMD professor David Wasserman set out to organize a meeting to discuss the potential genetic bases for criminal behavior. The originally planned conference was entitled \\"Genetic Factors in Crime: Findings, Uses and Implications\\", and was scheduled to be held on the University of Maryland's College Park campus on October 9, 1992. It was to be funded by a $78,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). When the planned conference became known to the public, it faced swift backlash and condemnation from civil rights activists, as well as from Peter Breggin, a prominent critic of psychiatry. Breggin's claim that the conference was racist had attracted the attention of the Congressional Black Caucus, which subsequently joined Breggin in protesting the conference, as did the Association of Black Psychologists and the NAACP's Baltimore chapter. Wasserman responded to the conference's critics by saying that the conference would aim to critically examine, not promote, research linking genes to crime, but this did not satisfy its critics. The backlash to Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration then-director Frederick K. Goodwin's controversial statement earlier that year, which compared inner cities in the United States to \\"jungles\\", inspired further opposition. Breggin had publicly linked the planned conference both to Goodwin's remarks and to an anti- violence initiative that had recently been proposed by then-Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Wade Sullivan. In July 1992, the NIH's National Center for Human Genome Research revoked the $78,000 grant that it had already given in response to the opposition, effectively cancelling it. That September, the NIH announced that it would be postponing the conference indefinitely, putting an end to the organizers' attempts to convince the NIH to reinstate the grant. In defending their decision to revoke the conference grant, it also cited a brochure promoting the conference and claimed that the brochure implied, falsely, that the NIH itself believed that there was a definitive link between genetics and crime. John W. Diggs, the NIH's then- deputy director for outside research, told the New York Times that the brochure suggested as scientific facts the link between genetics and crime and the potential for genetic tests to identify people predisposed to criminal behavior. Diggs further said that these statements \\"inflamed public opinion\\" and deviated significantly from the scope of the original grant proposal. The University of Maryland responded to the cancellation by claiming that the NIH's withdrawal of the grant was a violation of the University's academic freedom and appealed the NIH's decision to cancel the conference. The appeal succeeded, and NIH funded the conference again, this time with a $133,000 grant. The NIH's new grant was awarded after Wasserman broadened the scope of topics to be covered in the conference, as well as allowing for more discussion on the desirability and potential implications of the research. This broader scope was reflected in the conference's new name, \\"The Meaning and Significance of Research on Genetics and Criminal Behavior\\", and also persuaded some critics of the original 1992 conference to attend the new one. After the change in scope, the conference ended up focusing \\"...far more on the significance of the research into the biology of violent behavior than it did on the research itself\\", as Natalie Angier noted. Despite the changed scope, however, Goodwin criticized the 1995 conference for being designed to attract controversy, rather than to address the topic from a scientific perspective. Conference The conference took place from Friday, September 22 to Sunday, September 24, 1995, at the Aspen Institute, a liberal think tank in Queenstown, Maryland. In total, about 70 \\"biologists, criminologists, historians, and philosophers\\" attended the conference, according to Science. Panelists included Diana Fishbein, Dorothy Nelkin, Evan Balaban, David Comings, Irving Gottesman, Adrian Raine, and Adrienne Asch. On September 23, 1995, the second day of the conference, over 30 protesters with signs and red flags marched into the meeting. The protesters, who were affiliated with the Progressive Labor Party, accused the conference's organizers of \\"pushing genocide\\". They went on to invade one of the conference rooms at the Institute, where they grabbed a microphone and denounced the meeting. The protest was ended peacefully two hours later. Some of the protesters also compared the topics discussed at the conference to eugenics, a sentiment echoed by panelist Paul Billings. In the opening discussion, Billings asked, \\"How do we know the bad old days are over? I would argue that the evidence is that the bad old days aren't over.\\" On September 24, the third and last day of the conference, Howard University professor Rodney Green began addressing the audience just as they were leaving for a coffee break. Green told them, \\"We have to consider whether this conference should continue. What we heard this morning...was a racist presentation under the guise of genetics.\\" After the conference ended, a report based on the talks given there was published in Politics and the Life Sciences. Some of the conference talks were also published in the 2001 book Genes and Criminal Behavior, published as part of Cambridge University Press's Cambridge Studies in Philosophy and Public Policy series.

The nervous system consists of central and peripheral nervous systems and coordinates the actions of an animal by transmitting signals to and from different parts of its body. The brain and spinal cord are interwoven with the body and interact with other organ systems through the somatic, autonomic and enteric nervous systems. Neural pathways regulate brain-body interactions and allow to sense and control its body and interact with the environment.  Types of interactions  Various types of brain-body interactions have been distinguished. For example, brain-gut interactions are biochemical signaling that takes place between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. Brain-heart interactions link cardiac physiology to activity in the central and peripheral nervous system and may explain how peripheral cardiovascular arousal can influence decision making and the regulation of social and emotional behaviours. Brain-muscle interactions involve both efferent nerve fibres that transmit action potentials to the muscles to generate muscle contractions and afferent nerve fibres that transmit somatosensory information back to the central nervous system.  Brain-body networks  Interactions between brain regions have been studied using functional connectivity analysis. Resting state fMRI has shown that brain activity in different brain areas are coupled and form brain networks that can be studied using graph theory. Brain-body interactions can be studied using a similar approach by estimating functional connectivity between brain activity and peripheral electrophysiology, for example between brain activity and ECG, EGG or EMG activity. Synchrony between slow pulse fluctuations (related to sympathetic activity) and brain fMRI signal has revealed a network of sensory brain regions that appear to be relevant for characterizing human personality and emotions. These analyses can be extended to investigate interactions between multiple organ systems that together form a brain-body network.

The flag has recently seen a revival of interest due to local Maine vexillologists advocating for its re-adoption and businesses selling reproductions of it. Design There was no set standardized design for the 1901-adopted Maine state flag. Each flag maker had their interpretation of the flag as the legislative document simply states ‚Äúbuff charged with the emblem of the State, a pine tree proper in the center and the polar star (a mullet of five points), in blue in the upper corner.‚Äù As long as this criteria is met, the flag should be considered a Maine state flag. Some flags might have stylized pine trees or various shades of ‚Äúbuff‚Äù (beige).Buff is supposed to be the color of tanned deer hide and was the distinguishing traditional color of the Whig Party in both England and America prior to the Revolutionary War (see \\"West's Encyclopedia of American Law\\", accessed at http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/united-states-and-canada/us- history/whig-party on June 2, 2017). Along with \\"Continental blue\\", it was George Washington's signature color that he specified as the facing color for the Continental Army command staff (see George Washington Parke Custis, \\"Private Memoirs of Washington, by His Adopted Son, With a Memoir of the Author, by His Daughter; and Illustrative and Explanatory Notes, by Benson J. Lossing\\" [Philadelphia: J. W. Bradley, 1861], p. 520). The pine tree is a traditional symbol of New England and has been featured on New England flags in the past, notably the Pine Tree Flag. A popular version of the flag uses a tree design from the Maine merchant and marine flag. History Photograph of a surviving period-correct flag on display at a museum Although Maine had a semi-official militia flag from the 1820s to the 1860s,This flag featured the Pine Tree, a Moose and the star. See \\"Technology to the Rescue! Maine's First State Colors\\" by David B. Martucci, published in Flags From Sea to Sea, Canadian Flag Association, 2001 (http://internationalcongressesofvexillology- proceedingsandreports.yolasite.com/resources/18th-Victoria/Martucci- MainesFirstStateColours.pdf); also published in Maine History, Maine Historical Society, 2003 (https://www.mainehistory.org/publications.shtml). an official design was first proposed at the time the State House was being enlarged. On March 6, 1901, An act to establish a State Flag was read in the State House of Representatives and referred to the Military Affairs Committee. It was read the next day in the State Senate and also referred to Military Affairs. The first draft of this act reads as follows: The Military Affairs Committee read their report on this act in the House on March 15 and in the Senate on March 19; this report contained a new draft and was read by Frederick Walls of Vinalhaven (born North Searsmont, Me., 1844; died Vinalhaven, March 15, 1921, son of Jacob Walls and Eliza Thompson) with the recommendation, ought to pass. The new draft reads as follows: This act passed both houses and on March 21, 1901 was Engrossed ‚Äì Chapter 233 ‚Äì State Law. A new law was later enacted on February 23, 1909, modeled on the first draft and after flags used in the Civil War, which revised the original: Only one existing copy of the flag from the 1900s is known to exist today. It is a small silk flag made about 1908 by the A. Kimball Co. of New York, likely made for the Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition which was held in 1909. There are three known copies of this flag, one in San Francisco, Maryland, and Maine. =Recent usage= Another reproduction of the 1901 Flag In both 1991 and 1997, David B. Martucci of Washington, Maine advocated for proposed legislation, brought forward by his representatives in the Maine Legislature, to revert to the 1901 flag, arguing that it was a simpler, more representative design of Maine as the \\"Pine Tree State\\" and was unlike any other current U.S. state flag. In both 1991LD 1609 and 1997SD 530 the proposal failed, receiving 0 and 1 votes respectively. Local Maine businesses have also begun advocating for the return of the 1901 Maine flag. In 2008, CRW Flags in Glen Burnie, Maryland began offering an exact copy of the only known existing flag from the 1900s. In 2017, the Maine Flag Company began producing an appliqu√© version of the original Maine flag in their studio in Portland. As the original flag began to gain more visibility through 2018, Maine Stitching Specialties of Skowhegan, and the Bath Flag Company of Bath, all in Maine, began making and marketing their respective variant of the original Maine flag. In addition, the Gettysburg Flag Works of East Greenbush, New York sells a version of the design. Some of these and other firms sell clothing, hats, stickers, patches, beverage coolers, and other items bearing the flag or its elements.Cafe Press of Louisville, Kentucky (http://www.cafepres.com/; search for \\"Maine Flag 1901\\") offers the Flag Research Center Reconstruction design. Loyal Citizen Clothing of Portland, Maine(http://www.loyalcitizenclothing.com/) sells clothing with a variation of the existing flag elements from the era. Thanks to these manufacturers, the 1901 Maine flag is undergoing a surge in popularity. A legislative bill was submitted in 2019 to change the state's official flag to one more resembling the original. After an initial wave of support, the bill died in committee due to a larger outcry over changing the flag.
