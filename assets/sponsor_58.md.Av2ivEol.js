He worked as a clerk in insurance offices in Wrexham and Sheffield until he qualified as a solicitor in 1899. He passed his final Law Society examination with first-class honours, winning the Law Society prize in 1899, after which he established a law practice in Caernarfon where he lived for the rest of his life.Who was Who, OUP 2007 He was also director of several companies and solicitor for the North Wales Quarrymen's Union. He died at Caernarfon in 1939.The Times, 1 May 1939 He founded the Caernarfon solicitor firm - 'Ellis-Davies and Co' that is still in existence today and has his great grandson as one of the partners. Politics A political radical, Davies was elected to Caernarfonshire County Council in 1904, later becoming an alderman. He entered Parliament in June 1906 when he was returned unopposed in a by-election for the Eifion division of Caernarfonshire, when the former Member of Parliament John Bryn Roberts was appointed a county court judge. Eifion had been held by Roberts, a Liberal in the Gladstonian tradition, since its creation for the 1885 general election and at the 1906 general election Roberts had also been returned unopposed. Davies retained the Eifion constituency until 1918. During his years in Parliament, Davies sat on committees investigating land reform, the jury system, reform of the electoral system, compulsory purchases by local authorities, and reform of the House of Lords. He returned to Parliament as MP for Denbigh in 1923, but resigned in 1929 on grounds of ill health. In 1932, he was prominent in the discussions of the Presbyterian Church of Wales on formulating a parliamentary bill relating to the church.Archives Network Wales - Ellis W. Davies Papers Davies and Lloyd George During the First World War, Davies was one of a number of Welsh MPs who broke with Prime Minister David Lloyd George over his conduct of the war. Davies regarded Lloyd George's ministry as bellicose and illiberal, conflicting with his own strongly held pacifist and pro-labour views.Emyr Price, David Lloyd George, University of Wales Press, 2006; p.199 Although Ellis Davies was never really close to Lloyd George he knew him quite well being a Caernarfonshire MP and his journal records a number of occasions when they discussed political questionsJohn Grigg (writer), Lloyd George: The People‚Äôs Champion, 1902-1911:Penguin, 1997: p373 or worked together on specific projects.John Grigg, Lloyd George: From Peace to War, 1912-1916: Penguin, 1997: p42 At the 1918 general election Davies, as a supporter of the Asquithian Liberals, did not receive the coalition coupon and was heavily defeated, coming bottom of the poll.K O Morgan, Wales in British Politics, 1868-1922: University of Wales Press, 1963, p.283 Labour and Liberal Nationals Davies joined the Labour Party in 1936, only to leave early in 1939 because of its foreign policy. He believed that Neville Chamberlain‚Äôs policy of appeasement was more likely to keep the peace than Labour's support for intervention abroad. As a supporter of social reform, he felt that there was plenty of work to be done to improve social conditions at home and this could not be done if the country was at war. He then chose to associate himself with the Liberal Nationals, the allies of Chamberlain's Conservative government, although at the age of 68 years it was probably not in the hope of finding another seat.The Times,9 February 1939 Papers The papers of Ellis Davies, 1889‚Äì1939, comprising his diaries, journals, correspondence, press cuttings, addresses, articles and memoirs, together with printed and typescript memoranda, reports, policy documents and official publications are deposited at the National Library of Wales.

History Finnish soldiers in the Imperial Russian Army during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì78 Finland was a constituent part of the Swedish Empire for centuries, and had its earliest interactions with the Russian Empire through the auspices of that rule. Russia occupied Finland several times: The lesser and greater wraths respectively saw a Russian occupation of Finland, and the Russian Empire eventually overpowered Sweden to make Finland a part of its empire in 1809. With the Russian Empire‚Äôs collapse with World War I, Finland took the opportunity to declare independence, which was accepted by the USSR ‚Äúin line with the principle of national self-determination that was held by Lenin.‚ÄùJutikkala, Eino and Pirinen, Kauko. A History of Finland. Dorset Press, 1988 p. 216. Following the Finnish Civil War and October revolution, Russians were virtually equated with Communists and due to official hostility to Communism, Finno-Soviet relations in the period between the world wars remained tense. During these years Karelia was a highly Russian occupied military ground; the operation was led by Russian general Waltteri Asikainen. Voluntary activists arranged expeditions to Karelia (heimosodat), which ended when Finland and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic signed the Treaty of Tartu in 1920. However, the Soviet Union did not abide by the treaty when they blockaded Finnish naval ships. Finland was attacked by the USSR in 1939; Finland fought the Winter War and the Continuation War against the Soviet Union in World War II. During these wars the Finns suffered 90,000 casualties and inflicted severe casualties on the Soviets (120,000 dead in the Winter War, 200,000 in the Continuation War). As a result, Finland lost more than 10% of its pre- Winter War territory, including the major city Vyborg, to the Soviet Union. The cold war period saw Finland attempt to stake a middle ground between the western and eastern blocs, in order to appease the USSR so as to prevent another war, and even held new elections when the previous results were objectionable to the USSR.Jutikkala, Eino and Pirinen, Kauko. A History of Finland. Dorset Press, 1988 p. 252.

Both Jerrari Wagoneers have received considerable publicity in books and magazines, including Road & Track, Forza magazine, 365 Cars You Must Drive, and Stars, Cars and Infamy.  Origin  The Jerrari idea came after Bill Harrah had requested that Enzo Ferrari build a four-wheel drive Ferrari and Enzo refused. Bill Harrah then commissioned the first Jerrari to be built by combining a 1969 Jeep Grand Wagoneer with the engine, transmission, and front end from a Ferrari 365 GT.Bill Harrah used the finished car for transportation between his casinos in Reno and Lake Tahoe. He later commissioned the second Jerrari to be built for the same purpose, although this time keeping the original Jeep bodywork intact.  1969 Jerrari  The 1969 Jerrari Wagoneer had the entire front end from a Ferrari 365 GT grafted onto the stock Wagoneer body in addition to the Ferrari's engine and transmission. The latter were later removed from the car and used in the 1977 Jerrari. The car received mixed reviews from press regarding the looks of the car, with some even saying it was \\"a crime against nature\\". The 1969 Jerrari was posted on eBay in May, 2008 with a Chevy 350 V8 in place of the original Ferrari V12. Bidding exceeded $21,000.  1977 Jerrari  The 1977 Jerrari Wagoneer's exterior was kept mostly original, with only minor changes such as headlight wipers, a bumper mounted ice alert system, custom emblems and license plates, the original quad tip exhaust from the Ferrari donor car and lengthened front sheet-metal in order to be able to accommodate the engine. The interior received a few minor changes as well, including a Ferrari steering wheel, aftermarket gauge cluster, power mirrors, and a radar detector. The defining change, as before, being the addition of the 4.4 liter Ferrari V12 engine and 5-speed manual transmission taken from the 1969 Jerrari in place of the Jeep's stock AMC 360 V8.

France‚ÄìRussia relations (, , Rossiysko- frantsuzskiye otnosheniya) date back to the early modern period. According to a 2017 Pew Global Attitudes Project survey, 36% of French people have a favorable view of Russia, with 62% expressing an unfavorable view. A 2018 opinion poll published by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center shows that 81% of Russians have a favorable view of France, with 19% expressing a negative opinion. History Russian-French relations have a long history. An early contact came in 1051, when Anne of Kiev, daughter of Grand Prince of Kiev Yaroslav I the Wise, married Henry I of France. Anne became regent of France for a time after Henry's death and the accession of their eight-year- old son Philip I of France. The feudal fragmentation established in the XII century in Russia and the Tatar-Mongol invasion in the XIII century prevented the establishment of permanent Russian-French relations at that time. In 1413, the Flemish knight, politician and diplomat Gilbert de Lannoy (Guillebert de Lannoy) visited Veliky Novgorod and Pskov, who participated in the war of the Teutonic Order with Poland and included a description of the Russian lands in his travels and embassies (Voyages et ambassades, 1399‚Äî 1450). Due to the fact that the Russian centralized state formed in the XV-XVI centuries almost constantly was in a state of diplomatic and military confrontation with the Commonwealth, a significant part of the ruling elite of which traditionally focused on France, the Catholic rulers of the latter for a long time avoided establishing direct diplomatic contacts with Moscow . Real interest in Russia appeared in France only after the publication in 1607 of the work of Huguenot mercenary Jacques Margeret \\"The State of the Russian State and the Grand Duchy of Moscow\\", which information was used in the \\"History of his time\\" (1620) by the famous historian Jacques Augus de Tu (1553‚Äî 1617). In 1615, the embassy of Ivan Kondyrev was adopted at the court of Louis XIII, which ended in failure, but laid the foundation for diplomatic relations between Russia and France. In the summer of 1668, the Russian embassy headed by the steward P. Potemkin, who had an audience with Louis XIV and Colbert and discussed the establishment of mutually beneficial trade relations between the two countries, traveled from Spain to Paris. The first diplomatic representation of Russia in France appeared in 1702 by decree of Peter I, interested in an alliance with Louis XIV due to the rapprochement between England and Sweden. A visit to France by Peter I himself in 1717 served as the starting point for the establishment of permanent diplomatic relations between the two countries, interrupted only by the Great French Revolution. Concerned about the dominance of the Germans at the court of Empress Anna Ioannovna (1730-1740), French diplomacy actively promoted the palace coup of 1741 and the enthronement of Elizabeth Petrovna, who from her youth sympathized with France and her king Louis XV, for whom she was unsuccessfully tried to marry. An active role was played by the Marquis de la Scheetardi, who served as diplomatic envoy to the Russian court in 1739-1744. However, after the efforts of Chancellor Bestuzhev, the close of de la Ch√¢teardie, Count Loestock fell into disgrace, in 1748, the influence of the pro-French party weakened noticeably. = 18th century = Russian Tsar Peter the Great visits the young King Louis XV of France in 1717 Franco- Russian diplomatic ties go back at least to 1702, when France had an ambassador () in Moscow. Following Russia's victory over Sweden in the Great Northern War of 1700 to 1721, the foundation of Saint Petersburg as the new Russian capital in 1712, and Peter the Great's declaration of the Russian Empire in 1721, Russia became a major force in Western European affairs for the first time. The geographical separation between France and Russia meant that their spheres of influence rarely overlapped. When involved in the same war, their troops rarely fought together as allies or directly against each other as enemies on the same battlefields. However, each state played a crucial role in the European balance of power. The two countries' armed forces fought on opposite sides in the 1733‚Äì1738 War of the Polish Succession and in the 1740-1748 War of the Austrian Succession; they were allies against Prussia during the Seven Years' War of 1756 to 1763. =19th century= Napoleon and Prince Poniatowski before the burning city of Smolensk during the French invasion of Russia, 1812 Russia played a complex role in the Napoleonic wars. Russia fought against France in the War of the Second Coalition. Once Napoleon Bonaparte (later Emperor Napoleon I) came to power in 1799, Russia remained hostile and fought in the Wars of the Third and Fourth Coalitions, which were victories for France and saw French power extend into Central Europe. This led to the establishment of a French-backed Polish state, the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807, which threatened Russia and caused tensions that led to the French invasion of Russia in 1812. This was a major defeat for France and a turning point in the Napoleonic Wars, leading to Bonaparte's abdication and the Bourbon Restoration. Russia played a central role in defeating Napoleon in 1814. At the Vienna Congress of 1814-15, Russia played a major diplomatic role as a leader of the conservative, anti-revolutionary forces. This suited the Bourbon kings who again ruled France. Russia was a leader of the conservative Concert of Europe which sought to stifle revolution. Russia was again hostile when the Revolutions of 1848 broke out across Europe, bringing Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte (later Emperor Napoleon III) to power in France. Napoleon III favoured a \\"policy of nationalities\\" (principe des nationalit√©s) or support to national revolutions in multinational countries like Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, something fervently opposed by the Tsarist regime in Russia. France's challenges to Russia's influence led France to participate in the Crimean War, which saw French troops invade the Crimean peninsula. The war ended in Russia's defeat. The Battle of Malakoff during the Crimean War, 1855 French Emperor Napoleon III tried hard to reach a friendly entente with Russia, and succeeded in so doing with a secret treaty signed in March 1859. The treaty stated in article 1: \\"in case of war of Piedmont and France against Austria, the Emperor Alexander will, from the moment of the declaration of war, adopt a political and military position most clearly demonstrating his benevolent neutrality towards France.\\" see B. H. Sumner \\"The Secret Franco- Russian Treaty of 3 March 1859\\" English Historical Review 48#189 (1933), pp. 65-83 online; John Knox Stevens, \\"The Franco-Russian Treaty of 1859: New Light and New Thoughts.\\" The Historian 28#2 (1966): 203-223. online Quoting page 221. A. J. P. Taylor says the 1859 treaty, \\"was a triumph for Napoleon; and indeed it alone made possible the liberation of Italy\\".A.J.P. Taylor, The struggle for mastery in Europe, 1848-1918 (1954) p 106 However, when revolt in Poland broke out in 1863, France sent a series of notes to Russia demanding reforms and ended the 1859 entente. In Prussia, Otto von Bismarck took a friendly position toward Russia on Poland and other issues, and made sure that when war broke out between France and the German states in 1870, Russia was neutral, as was every other power.Taylor,The struggle for mastery in Europe, 1848-1918 (1954), 206-7. Imperial Russia's foreign policy was hostile to republican France in the 19th century and very pro-German. The First and Second Three Emperor's Leagues of the 1870s and 1880s-which brought together Germany, Austria and Russia-had as its stated purpose the preservation of the monarchical order in Europe against the France of the Third Republic. After the defeat in the Franco-German war of 1870-71, French elites concluded that France could never hope to defeat Germany on its own, and the way to defeat the Reich would be with the help of another great power.Smith, Leonard; Audoin-Rouzeau, Ste√©phane, & Becker, Annette France and the Great War, 1914-1918, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003 page 11. Otto von Bismarck drew the same conclusion and worked hard to keep France diplomatically isolated.Smith, Leonard; Audoin-Rouzeau, Ste√©phane, & Becker, Annette France the Great War, 1914-1918, (Cambridge UP, 2003 page 11. France was deeply split between the monarchists on one side, and the Republicans on the other. The Republicans at first don't welcome any alliance with Russia. Russia and France have different position on almost international affairs at that time. At a time when French Republicans were rallying in the Dreyfus affair against anti-Semitism, Russia was the most notorious center in the world of anti-Semitic outrages, including multiple murderous large-scale pogroms against the Jews. On the other hand, France was increasingly frustrated by Bismarck's success in isolating it diplomatically. France had issues with Italy, which was allied with Germany and Austria-Hungary in the Triple Alliance. Paris made a few overtures to Berlin, but they were rebuffed, and after 1900 there was a threat of war between France and Germany over Germany's attempt to deny French expansion into Morocco. Great Britain was still in its ‚Äúsplendid isolation‚Äù mode and after a major agreement in 1890 with Germany, it seemed especially favorable toward Berlin. By 1892, Russia was the only opportunity for France to break out of its diplomatic isolation. Russia had been allied with Germany when Kaiser Wilhelm II dismissed Bismarck in 1890 and ended the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia in 1892. Russia was alone diplomatically and like France, it needed a military alliance to contain the threat of Germany's strong army and military aggressiveness. The pope, angered by German anti-Catholicism, worked diplomatically to bring Paris and St. Petersburg together. Russia desperately needed money for the completion of railways and ports. The German government refused to allow its banks to lend money to Russia, but French banks did so eagerly. For example, it funded the essential trans-Siberian railway. Rejected by Germany, Russia cautiously began a policy of rapprochement with France starting in 1891 while the French for their part were very interested in the Russian offers of an alliance.Leonard Smith, et al. France and the Great War, 1914-1918 (2003) pp 11-12. In August 1891, France and Russia signed a \\"consultative pact\\" where both nations agreed to consult each other if another power were to threaten the peace of Europe. Negotiations were increasingly successful, and in early 1894 France and Russia agreed to the Franco-Russian Alliance, a military pledge to join together in war if Germany attacked either of them. The alliance was intended to deter Germany from going to war by presenting it with the threat of a two-front war; neither France or Russia could hope to defeat Germany on its own, but their combined power might do so. France had finally escaped its diplomatic isolation.John B. Wolf, France 1814-1919: The rise of a Liberal-Democratic Society (1963)William L. Langer, The diplomacy of Imperialism: 1890‚Äì1902 (2nd ed. 1960), pp 3-66. The alliance was secret until 1897, when the French government realized that secrecy was defeating its deterrent value. After France was humiliated by Britain in the Fashoda Incident of 1898, the French wanted the alliance to become an anti-British alliance. In 1900, the alliance was amended to name Great Britain as a threat and stipulated that should Britain attack France, Russia would invade India. The French provided a loan so that the Russians could start the construction of a railroad from Orenburg to Tashkent. Tashkent in its turn would be the base from which the Russians would invade Afghanistan as the prelude to invading India.Taylor, The Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848-1918 (1954) p. 398 =20th century= European military alliances prior to World War I In 1902, Japan formed a military alliance with Britain, which built up an Anglo-Japanese alliance. In response, Russia worked with France in order to renege on agreements to reduce troop strength in Manchuria. On March 16, 1902, a mutual pact was signed between France and Russia. Japan later fought Russia in the Russo-Japanese war. France remained neutral in this conflict. In 1908-09 during the Bosnian crisis, France declined to support Russia against Austria and Germany . The lack of French interest in supporting Russia during the Bosnia crisis was the low point of Franco-Russian relations with the Emperor Nicholas II making no effort to hide his disgust at the lack of support from what was supposed to be his number one ally. Nicholas seriously considered abrogating the alliance with France, and was only stopped by the lack of an alternative.Tomaszewski, Fiona \\"Pomp, Circumstance, and Realpolitik: The Evolution of the Triple Entente of Russia, Great Britain, and France\\" pages 362-380 from Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Geschichte Osteuropas 47#3 (1999) pp 369-70. Further linking France and Russia together was a common economic interests. Russia wished to industrialize, but lacked the capital to do so while the French were more than prepared to lend the necessary money to finance Russia's industrialisation. By 1913, French investors had invested 12 billion francs into Russian assets, making the French the largest investors in the Russian empire. The industrialisation of the Russian Empire was partially the result of a massive influx of French capital into the country. USSR: 1917-1941 The Bolsheviks opted for peace with Germany in 1917 and refused to recognize the czarist loans. In December 1917 France broke relations and Supported the anti- Bolshevik cause. It supported the White Guard in the Civil War, and supported Poland in the war of 1920. The operations failed, and France switched from a diplomacy of opposition to one of containment of communism, with sharply reduced contacts. French communist continue to visit Moscow, and promote communism in France, but there was no official presence. By 1924, Comintern efforts to overthrow capitalism had failed, and the New Economic Policy met the Soviets were eager for international trade. As a result, the Herriot government in Paris officially recognized the Soviet Union, leading to a rapid growth of commercial and cultural exchanges.Michael Jabara Carley, \\"Episodes from the Early Cold War: Franco-Soviet Relations, 1917‚Äì1927.\\" Europe-Asia Studies 52.7 (2000): 1275-1305. Soviet artists were welcomed in Paris, especially Maxim Gorky and Ilya Ehrenburg, In turn, Moscow honored leading French artists.Ludmila Stern, \\"The All‚ÄêUnion Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and French Intellectuals, 1925‚Äì29.\\" Australian Journal of Politics & History 45.1 (1999): 99-109. Soviet diplomats in France sought a military alliance with France in the early 1930s, but the French were distrustful of the Soviets. The rapid growth of power in Nazi Germany encouraged both Paris and Moscow to form a military alliance, and a weak one was signed in May 1935. A firm believer in collective security, Stalin's foreign minister Maxim Litvinov worked very hard to form a closer relationship with France and Britain.Haslam, Jonathan (1984). The Soviet Union and the Struggle for Collective Security in Europe, 1933‚Äì1939. New York: St. Martin's Press. pp. 52‚Äì53. In 1939 French and British diplomats tried to form a military alliance with Moscow, but the Germans offered much better terms. The Soviet-German pact of August 1939 indicated Moscow's decisive break with Paris, as it became an economic ally of Germany.G. Bruce Strang, \\"John Bull in Search of a Suitable Russia: British Foreign Policy and the Failure of the Anglo-French-Soviet Alliance Negotiations, 1939.\\" Canadian Journal of History 41.1 (2006): 47-84. USSR: 1941 to 1991 FAFL Normandie-Niemen Yak-3 preserved at the Paris Le Bourget museum. Khrushchev and de Gaulle, may 1960. When Germany invaded the USSR in 1941 Charles de Gaulle emphasized that Free France supported the USSR. In December 1944, de Gaulle went to Moscow; The two nations signed a treaty of alliance and mutual assistance. The treaty was finally renounced in 1955, long after the Cold War had begun.Robert Gildea, France since 1945 (2002) pp 30-35. Stalin thought France was no longer a great power so de Gaulle had to make concessions to Stalin to obtain Soviet support against Anglo-Saxon dominance. There was a hope of making France a bridge between the Soviets and the Anglo-Americans. All of the Big Three refused to pretend that France was a power again, so it was not invited to the decisive Yalta conference in February 1945, which was humiliating. The emerging Cold War produced new tensions. When de Gaulle became the French leader in 1945, he put communists in minor roles in his government, blocking them from key positions such as a home office, the foreign office, and the war office. Furthermore, the successful Communist efforts to seize power in Poland, directed by Stalin, were worrisome to the French. With Roosevelt replaced by Harry Truman, France increasingly turned to the American presence in Western Europe to maintain balance of power.John Young, \\"Stalin and de Gaulle,\\" History Today (June 1990) 40#6. The Communist Party was a strong political influence in France, and was under the direction of the Kremlin. It drew support from certain labor unions, from veterans of the anti-Nazi resistance, and from artists and intellectuals. Communists emphasized anti-Americanism, to win support in the artistic and cultural communities. Pablo Picasso was an outspoken anti-American communist.Kirsten Hoving Keen, \\"Picasso's communist interlude: the murals of 'War' and 'Peace'.\\" The Burlington Magazine 122.928 (1980): 464-470. Online In 1947 the French Communist Party was at its height, and there was speculation it might come to power. However the Soviet strong- arm tactics and Eastern Europe, combined with strong opposition from key few French government officials, broke the power of the Party and sent it into a downward spiral.Martin Evans and Emmanuel Godin. \\"The great fear of 1947: could France have gone communist?.\\" History Today 55.1 (2005): 21. Decolonisation of the French colonial empire gave Moscow the opportunity to provide propaganda support for the anti-colonial fighters, as well as weapons, especially in Algeria and Vietnam. this angered French moderates.Yahia H. Zoubir, \\"US and Soviet Policies Towards France‚Äôs Struggle with Anticolonial Nationalism in North Africa.\\" Canadian Journal of History 30.3 (1995): 439-466. Despite the pressure from the left, the Fourth Republic had more urgent concerns regarding relations with Germany, and economy supported by Marshall plan money, fears of communist subversion in the colonial empire, and American support for the anti-communist war in Vietnam. Official government policy supported the United States and NATO. When de Gaulle returned to power 1958, relations with Moscow improved. De Gaulle did not trust the United States to use nuclear weapons in defense of France, so it built its own. To enhance France's global prestige, it tried to be a broker between Moscow and Washington. In May 1960, de Gaulle hosted a summit in Paris between Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and NATO leaders. The summit worked poorly. De Gaulle then moved away from NATO to concentrate more on Europe as an independent actor. He reduced reliance on the American military because the Cold War was heating up between Washington and Moscow.Benjamin Varat, \\"Point of Departure: A Reassessment of Charles de Gaulle and the Paris Summit of May 1960.\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft 19.1 (2008): 96-124. online France never officially left NATO, but de Gaulle sharply reduced its military commitment In the 1960s.Herbert Tint, French Foreign Policy since the Second World War (1972) online free to borrow pp 106-63.Georges‚ÄêHenri Soutou, \\"France and the Cold War, 1944‚Äì63.\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft 12.4 (2001): 35-52.William I Hitchcock, France Restored: Cold War diplomacy and the quest for leadership in Europe 1944-1954 (1998).

Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev made a visit to France in October 1985 in order to fix the strains in the Franco-Soviet relations. Nevertheless, France's bilateral activities continued with NATO, which made close deals with Communist USSR impossible. =Since 1991= Russian president Dmitry Medvedev (right) and French president Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008.

Bilateral relations between France and Russia never became warm. On February 7, 1992 France signed a bilateral treaty, recognizing Russia as a successor of the USSR. As described by the Paris the bilateral relations between France and Russia remain longstanding, and remain strong to this day.French Ministry of foreign affairs - France and Russia During the 2008 Georgia-Russia War, Sarkozy did not insist on territorial integrity of Georgia. Moreover, there were no French protests when Russia failed to obey Sarkozy's deal to withdraw from Georgia and recognizing governments in Georgia's territories.THE FOREIGN POLICY OF NICOLAS SARKOZY: The foreign policy of Nicolas Sarkozy: Not principles, opportunistic and amateurish. Marchel H. Van Herpen. February 2010 One of the major news has been the sale of Mistral class amphibious assault ships to Russia. The deal which was signed at 2010, is the first major arms deal between Russia and the Western world since World War II. The deal has been criticized for neglecting the security interests of Poland, the Baltic states, Ukraine, and Georgia. Before Syrian Civil War, Franco-Russian relations were generally improving. After years flailing behind Germany and Italy, France decided to copy them by emphasising the bilateral relationship. Ever since the financial crisis took hold, European powers have been forced to court emerging markets more and Moscow meanwhile wanted to diversify its own economy. President Hollande summed up the attitude towards what some said Putin's repressive array of new laws during his first official visit to Moscow in February 2013: \\"I do not have to judge, I do not have to evaluate\\". Since 2015 - Present Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia France and Russia were both attacked by the Middle-Eastern Islamist group ISIS. As a response, Fran√ßois Hollande and Vladimir Putin agreed on ordering their respective armed forces to \\"cooperate\\" with one another in the fight against the terrorist organization. The French President has called upon the international community to bring \\"together of all those who can realistically fight against this terrorist army in a large and unique coalition.\\"Russia Open to Cooperation in Fight Against ISIS: French Foreign Minister, Newsweek The French-Russian bombing cooperation is considered to be an \\"unprecedented\\" move, given that France is a member of NATO.Hollande in Moscow: A new era in Russian-French relations?, BBC News The French press highlighted that ISIS is the first common enemy that France and Russia fight shoulder to shoulder since World War II.

Milius, USN, who received the Navy Cross for saving his seven-man crew while serving with VO-67. Commander Milius was lost in combat over the Ho Chi Minh Trail when his OP-2E aircraft, callsign Sophomore 50, was hit by anti-aircraft fire over Laos on 27 February 1968 and he ordered his crew to bail out. Seven of the nine men aboard were rescued. The remains of the eighth crewmember, ATN2 John Hartzheim, were identified on 19 February 1999. Although he exited his aircraft, Commander Milius was never seen again. He was listed as Missing in Action, presumed Killed in Action, and his remains never recovered.

Structure Equality NC is an umbrella group of two separate non-profit corporations and a political action committee: Equality NC Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization that provides educational programming on LGBT issues and conducts comprehensive campaigns to build public support for equal rights, Equality NC, a 501(c)(4) organization that conducts lobbying and advocacy efforts, and Equality NC PAC, a political action committee which works to elect fair-minded candidates. These organizations all work to secure equal rights and justice for LGBT North Carolinians. The organization is a member of the Equality Federation. =Leadership= Equality NC's leadership includes Executive Director Kendra Johnson. Equality NC's work is supported by three boards: the Equality NC Board, the Equality NC Foundation Board, and Equality NC Action Fund Working Group. All three boards are composed of volunteers from across North Carolina. History Equality NC began in 1979 and originally was called the North Carolina Human Rights Fund. It was eventually named Equality North Carolina in 2002, when the board agreed they needed a parent organization to manage the work and to link all the smaller foundations together. Success ENC's Matthew Shephard Memorial Act issued in 1999 became the first pro-gay bill ever voted on in the North Carolina House of Representatives, although it ended up losing by ten votes. In 2004, ENC succeeded in blocking a constitutional amendment prohibiting lesbian and gay marriages. Equality NC PAC also managed to get Senator Julia Boseman, the first openly gay state legislator in North Carolina, elected in 2004. The organization was successful in getting the 2008 edition of the State Personnel manual to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In the summer of 2007, they petitioned to the state, requesting that it allow lesbians and gays, when hospitalized, to be visited by their partners if they wish. The new permission was approved, and allowed to take effect beginning on May 1, 2008. However, the rule only allows gay partners to visit their loved ones; it does not allow them to make any medical decisions for them.

Early life In college, Daniel Acu√±a studied painting and graduated with a degree in Fine Arts. He cites his early influences as Jack Kirby, the Romitas (Senior and Junior), Will Eisner, Simon Bisley, Kevin Nowlan, Hal Foster, and his favorite, Richard Corben, along with fine artists such as Edward Hopper, and Alfons Mucha, as well as illustrator Drew Struzan. Career His first published work was a 22-page black and white project, Claus & Simon in Hollywood, with fellow artist Santi Arcas, which was bought by Spanish publisher La Cupula when Acu√±a was 22. This work was followed by Claus & Simon: Freakshow, and Claus & Simon: Disaster Box. The \\"Claus & Simon\\" series is about the adventures of a clown and an anthropomorphic dinosaur. The last story was done for the French market and later reprinted in the popular American magazine Heavy Metal (under the title Claus & Simon: Kings of Escape). Claus & Simon increased Acu√±a's profile in Europe, and he received work painting the covers for European paperback reprints of Alan Moore's Supreme (#2-6), which led to Acu√±a's decision to try to break into the American market while still remaining active in the European comics industry. Acu√±a's first work in the American comics industry was for Marvel Comics, on a miniseries for Axel Alonso that was never completed or published. DC Comics editor Eddie Berganza later hired him to paint pictures of Ravager and Blackfire for Teen Titans/Outsiders Secret Files. This work got Acu√±a noticed by Mark Chiarello, who suggested him to editors Mike Carlin and Joan Hilty as a cover artist for the Justice League of America and Outsiders series. Although only doing American-market covers up until this point, Acu√±a made the move to interior art with Uncle Sam & the Freedom Fighters, on which he did the covers, pencils, inks, graytones and even character design, working with European colorist Javi Montes. In late 2005, it was announced that Acu√±a had signed a two-year exclusive contract with DC Comics. However, in 2007 it was announced that Acu√±a had signed an exclusive contract with Marvel Comics, to start in 2008, and would be leaving DC Comics. Acu√±a had previously only done covers for Marvel; his first interior work for the publisher was The Eternals, which debuted June 2008.Richards, Dave (March 7, 2008). \\"EXCLUSIVE: Daniel Acu√±a talks 'Eternals'\\".

Polish Jew, physician of and professor of physiology at the University of Lw√≥w. He was born on 1 January 1863, in Krak√≥w, Galicia, into a family of poor parents. During his academic career, Beck supported himself as a private tutor. Upon graduating with distinction from the gymnasium of his native city in 1884, he entered the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w. In 1888, while still a medical student, Beck gained the prize of the university by a paper on the excitability of a nerve, afterward published under the title, \\"O pobudliwo≈õci r√≥≈ºnych miejsc tego samego nerwu\\" (On the Excitability of a Nerve at Different Points).Beck A. O pobudliwo≈õci r√≥≈ºnych miejsc tego samego nerwu. Rozpr. Wydz. mat.-przyr. polsk. Akad. Um. 15: 165-95, 1888. In 1890 he received the degree of M.D., and in the same year published the results of his extensive research on electrical processes in the brain. His papers on this subject, \\"Die Bestimmung der Localisation des Gehirn- und R√ºckenmarksfunctionen Vermittelst der Electrischen Erscheinungen,\\" 1890, and \\"Weitere Untersuchungen √ºber die Electrischen Erscheinungen des Hirnrinde der Affen und Hunde,\\" 1891 (in collaboration with Napoleon Cybulski), attracted wide attention in Germany, France, and England, and won for him a prominent position among students of physiology. In 1889 Beck was appointed assistant in the physiological laboratory of the Jagiellonian University and he remained in this position until 1894, when he became privatdocent on the presentation of his thesis \\"Ueber die Physiologie der Reflexes.\\" In the following year he was offered a chair of physiology as associate professor in the newly created medical department of the University of Lemberg and in 1897 was appointed professor in the same institution. Beck is considered as one of the pioneers of electroencephalography (EEG).Journal of the History of the Neurosciences: Basic and Clinical Perspectives 2014, vol 23 Beck has received many marks of distinction from medical societies in recognition of his scientific investigations. His numerous contributions, published in German and in Polish, belong almost exclusively to the domain of physiology. To the investigations represented by these publications should be added the extensive work of research conducted on similar lines in the Physiological Institute of the University of Lemberg under Beck's immediate supervision. Beck was a member of the Polish Academy of Learning in Krak√≥w. He was the first physiologist awarded with the Medal and a title of an Honorary Member of the Polish Physiological Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Fizjologiczne).Polskie Towarzystwo Fizjologiczne He committed suicide in August 1942 in the Janowska concentration camp.

Russia has an embassy in Algiers and a consulate in Annaba, and Algeria has an embassy in Moscow. Algeria currently enjoys very strong relations with Russia. Background Cold War Era Throughout the Algerian War of Independence, the Soviet Union had been providing military, technical and material assistance to Algeria. The USSR was the first country in the world to de facto recognize the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic in October 1960, and then de jure on March 23, 1962, by establishing diplomatic relations with this country (a few months before the official proclamation of its independence). In December 1963, the Soviet Union and Algeria signed an agreement on economic and technical cooperation. The USSR committed itself to provide assistance in reconstructing and building industrial plants, agricultural development, geological exploration, personnel training, etc. The Soviet Union granted Algeria a long- term loan in the amount of 90 million rubles. In May 1964, the countries signed an agreement, under which the USSR agreed to provide technical assistance in the construction of a metallurgical plant in the city of Annaba (another long-term loan of 115 million rubles was granted for these needs). The head of the Algerian Government Houari Boumedi√®ne visited the Soviet Union in December 1965 and June‚ÄìJuly 1967. In 1967, Algeria temporarily cut off relations with USA. The Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR Nikolai Podgorny paid an official visit to Algeria in late March - early April 1969. Newly independent, Algeria recognized the importance of ‚Äòunity and convergence‚Äô in Third World countries in order to achieve domestic goals. This could be expressed by their support of the non-aligned movement, which began with the FLN‚Äôs involvement in the 1960s. Byrne, J. J. (2015) \\"Beyond Continents, Colours, and the Cold War: Yugoslavia, Algeria, and the Struggle for Non-Alignment\\" The International History Review, 37:5, 912-932 Algeria was close with the Soviet regime in the 1970s and 1980s because of the supply of arms. The approximation by the Russian press is that ‚ÄòMoscow supplied 11 billion dollars in military equipment to Algeria between 1962 and 1989, equal to 70-80 percent of Algeria‚Äôs inventory‚Äô and this deal mainly came about through the use of loans. Kats, M. N. (2007) \\"Russia and Algeria - Partners or Competitors\\" Middle East Policy Council, Vol 14/4 In 1993, it was estimated that 90% of Algerian army's inventory was of Soviet origin. At the same time as these relations were occurring, Algeria had taken an active stance in the Non-Aligned Movement. In 1973, Houari Boumedi√®ne hosted the Non-Aligned Movement in Algiers. According to historians it was ‚Äòwith the observation that recent co-operation between Moscow and Washington looked very much like a superpower ‚Äòpretension to reign over the world‚Äù. Byrne, J. J. (2015) \\"Beyond Continents, Colours, and the Cold War: Yugoslavia, Algeria, and the Struggle for Non-Alignment\\" The International History Review, 37:5, 912-932 Boumedi√®ne cooperated closely with Moscow and Washington on bilateral levels but his view, iterated by hosting the Non-Aligned summit, was not one of supporting either side in the Cold War. One of the main points emphasized at Bandung, the birthplace of the Non Aligned movement, was that the Third World countries should take a stand against colonialism and neo-colonialism. In a post- colonial Algeria, subscribing to this view was a necessity. By the mid-1970s, Algeria was fully engaged in the zenith of the Non-Aligned Movement, wary of imperial powers which looked down upon the Third World. Nevertheless, presidential visits, diplomatic ties, and cordial bilateral relations continued with the two superpowers. Post Cold War A different atmosphere was on the rise in the 1990s as Algeria stopped making the loan repayments to Russia, and after Putin‚Äôs rise, Algeria joined NATO‚ÄôS ‚ÄúMediterranean Dialogue‚Äù with other Middle Eastern countries such as Egypt. Bouteflika‚Äôs presidency, which began in April 1999, was followed shortly by Putin‚Äôs presidency and the two leaders pushed for the return to more cordial relations, including discussions of arms sales and economic cooperation. In 2006, Algeria's 5.7 billion dollar debt was forgiven, and Algeria gave a 7.5 billion dollar arms deal to Russia, the first major African arms deal of Russian Federation. Bilateral relations at this point regained in strength. Recent Relations *3‚Äì6 April 2001, an official visit to Moscow, President of Algeria Abdelaziz Bouteflika, give a new quality to bilateral relations and has become a major milestone in the expansion of Russian-Algerian relations.

Skinner used to describe a verbal operant in which the response is reinforced by a characteristic consequence and is therefore under the functional control of relevant conditions of deprivation or aversive stimulation. One cannot determine, based on form alone, whether a response is a mand; it is necessary to know the kinds of variables controlling a response in order to identify a verbal operant. A mand is sometimes said to \\"specify its reinforcement\\" although this is not always the case. Skinner introduced the mand as one of six primary verbal operants in his 1957 work, Verbal Behavior. Chapter three of Skinner's work, Verbal Behavior, discusses a functional relationship called the mand. A mand is a form of verbal behavior that is controlled by deprivation, satiation, or what is now called motivating operations (MO), as well as a controlling history. An example of this would be asking for water when one is water deprived (\\"thirsty\\"). It is tempting to say that a mand describes its reinforcer, which it sometimes does. But many mands have no correspondence to the reinforcer. For example, a loud knock may be a mand \\"open the door\\" and a servant may be called by a hand clap as much as a child might \\"ask for milk.\\" Mands differ from other verbal operants in that they primarily benefit the speaker, whereas other verbal operants function primarily for the benefit of the listener. This is not to say that mand's function exclusively in favor of the speaker, however; Skinner gives the example of the advice, \\"Go west!\\" as having the potential to yield consequences which will be reinforcing to both speaker and listener. When warnings such as \\"Look out!\\" are heeded, the listener may avoid aversive stimulation. The Lamarre & Holland (1985) study on mands would be one example of a research study in this area. Dynamic properties The mand form, being under the control of deprivation and stimulation, will vary in energy level. Dynamic qualities are to be understood as variations that arise as a function of multiple causes. Dynamic, in this case, as opposed to how someone reading from a text might sound if they do not simulate the normal dynamic qualities of verbal behavior. Mands tend to be permanent when they are acquired.Wacker, D.P.; Harding, J.W. & Berg, W.K. (2008). Evaluation of Mand-Reinforcer Relations Following Long-Term Functional Communication Training. Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis, 3(1), 25. BAO Extended mands Emitting mands to objects or animals that cannot possibly supply an appropriate response would be an example of the extended mand. Telling \\"stop!\\" to someone out of earshot, perhaps in a film, who is about to hurt themselves is an example of the extended mand. Extended mands occur due to extended stimulus control. In the case of an extended mand, the listener is unable to deliver consequences that would reinforce the mand, but they have enough in common with listeners that have previously reinforced the mand that stimulus control can be inferred. =Superstitious mands= Mands directed to inanimate objects may be said to be superstitious mands. Mands to an unreliable car to \\"come on and start\\" for example may be due to a history of intermittent reinforcement. =Magical mands= A magical mand is a mand form where the consequences specified in the mand have never occurred. The form \\"Give me a million dollars\\" has never before produced a million dollars and so would be classified as a magical mand. Skinner posits that many literary mands are of the magical form. Prayer might also be analyzed as belonging in one of the above three categories, depending upon one's opinion of the likelihood and mechanism of its answer. Clinical application Failure to mand adequately appears to be correlated with destructive behavior.Fisher, W.W. (2001) Functional Analysis of Pre current Contingencies Between Mands and Destructive Behavior.

It is contrasted with secular clergy, clerics who are not bound by a rule of life. Terminology and history The observance of the Rule of St. Benedict procured for Benedictine monks at an early period the name of \\"regulars\\". The Council of Verneuil (755) so refers to them in its third canon, and in its eleventh canon speaks of the \\"ordo regularis\\" as opposed to the \\"ordo canonicus\\", formed by the canons who lived under the bishop according to the canonical regulations. There was question also of a \\"regula canonicorum\\", or \\"regula canonica\\", especially after the extension of the rule which Chrodegang, Bishop of Metz, had drawn up from the sacred canons (766).cf. capitularies (n. 69 circa 810, n. 138 of 818, 819, ed. Alf. Boretii) And when the canons were divided into two classes in the eleventh century, it was natural to call those who added religious poverty to their common life regulars, and those who gave up the common life, seculars. Before this we find mention of \\"s√¶culares canonici\\" in the Chronicle of St. Bertin (821)Mart√®ne, Anecdot., III, 505. In fact as the monks were said to leave the world,Augustine of Hippo, Serm. 40 de div. sometimes those persons who were neither clerics nor monks were called seculars, as at times were clerics not bound by the rule. Sometimes also the name \\"regulars\\" was applied to the canons regular to distinguish them from monks. Thus the collection of Gratian (about 1139)C. xix, q. 2, c. 2 and q. 3, c. 1. speaks of canons regular, who make canonical profession, and live in a regular canonicate, in opposition to monks who wear the monastic habit, and live in a monastery. But the Decretals of Gregory IX, promulgated 5 September 1234, use the word \\"regularis\\" in a more general sense, in book III, ch. xxxi, which is entitled \\"De regularibus et transeuntibus ad religionem\\". However in ch. xxxv \\"De statu monachorum et canonicorum regularium\\" the distinction returns, disappearing in the corresponding book and chapter of the Decretals of Boniface VIII (3 March 1298),t. XVI, in 6 which is entitled merely \\"De statu regularium\\" and reappearing in the collection of Clementines (25 Oct., 1317) but with the conjunction vel, which indicates the resemblance between them.Although another edition has et, the title of ch. x, c. 3 Clem. in the official edition reads \\"De statu monachorum, vel canonicorum regularium\\". From that time, while the word \\"religious\\" is more generally used, the word \\"regular\\" was reserved for members of religious orders with solemn vows. Those who have taken simple vows in the Society of Jesus were also regulars in the proper sense according to the Constitution \\"Ascendente\\" of Pope Gregory XIII. Before the publication of the Code of Canon Law of 1917, writers were not agreed on the question whether the religious of other orders can properly be called regulars before solemn profession, but it was agreed that novices of religious orders were regulars only in the wider meaning of the word. In the 1917 Code of Canon Law, the word \\"regulars\\" was officially defined as those who have made their vows in a \\"religion\\" (what in the 1983 Code is called a religious institute).1917 Code of Canon Law, canon 488, 7 The technical juridical term \\"regular\\" does not appear, as such, in the current 1983 Code of Canon Law, which does, however, use the phrase \\"canons regular\\".Code of Canon Law, canon 613 ¬ß1 See also *Canons regular *Clerics regular Notes Further reading * John F.

History In the early 1930s, D.I. Kondratiev and a group of Leningrad specialists visited America to learn about local developments. A new model of the Leningrad tram was derived from this research trip based on the Peter Witt design. The design was modified in accordance with Soviet domestic requirements; in particular, the width of the wagon was reduced. The first tram of this design was produced by PTMF. It was originally named MA (M–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–Ω—ã–π A–º–µ—Ä–∏–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ç–∏–ø–∞), and its unpowered trailer was named PA (rus. –ü–ê, –ü—Ä–∏—Ü–µ–ø–Ω–æ–π A–º–µ—Ä–∏–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ç–∏–øa).

Both countries established diplomatic relations on April 21, 1943. Russia currently has an embassy in Addis Ababa, and Ethiopia has an embassy in Moscow. The Ethiopian ambassador to Russia is also accredited to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Imperial history The history of this relationship has its origins in the 19th century. Russia's first steps in the Horn of Africa were taken by a Cossack adventurer named N.I. Ashinov, who attempted to establish a \\"New Moscow\\" at the coastal town of Sagallo in modern-day Djibouti. This short-lived settlement came to an end in February 1889 when French authorities removed the 175 Russian settlers. While Ashniov had never more than lukewarm support from the Russian Tsar, a delegation led by V.F. Mashkov to Emperor Menelik II in October 1889 was official. Mashkov discussed arms sales to Ethiopia with the Ethiopian emperor, and upon returning to Russia he was decorated by the Tsar. Mashkov made a second visit to Ethiopia early in 1891 under the sponsorship of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society.–î–∏—Å—Å–µ—Ä—Ç–∞—Ü–∏—è \\"–†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ-—ç—Ñ–∏–æ–ø—Å–∫–∏–µ –¥–∏–ø–ª–æ–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –∏ –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–Ω—ã–µ —Å–≤—è–∑–∏ –≤ –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–µ XIX-–Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–µ XX –≤–µ–∫–æ–≤\\" Paul Henze notes that the reasons of Mashkov's visits were \\"no doubt political, but the fact that both countries were Orthodox encouraged favorable attitudes on both sides.\\" Russia provided the mountain guns the Ethiopian army used in the 1895 Battle of Adwa.\\"Russia, we may note, was in fact the only European power to champion Ethiopia at the time of Adwa.

Despite the implementation of a series of radical socio-economic reforms, Moscow was slow to embrace the new regime for several reasons. First, the Derg continued the old regime's policy of buying arms from the United States. Second, the Soviet Union was reluctant to jeopardize its growing relationship with Somalia, Ethiopia's traditional enemy. Third, a significant segment of the Soviet leadership was skeptical of the revolutionary credentials of the Derg, as Moscow perceived a significant number of its members to be pro-Western. Soviet backing for the Derg increased as Major Mengistu Haile Mariam emerged as its most powerful member. In 1975, the first group of officers from the regime traveled to the Soviet Union for ideological training, including Lt. Colonel Fire-Selassie Wogderess, who would later become Mengistu's second in command. Soviet media ran positive portrayals of the Derg and of Mengistu in particular. After the execution of Mengistu's rival, Major Sisal Habte, Soviet support for the regime grew substantially, beginning with a secret $100 million arms deal in December 1976. In May 1977, Mengistu traveled to Moscow to sign a \\"Declaration on the Principles of Friendly Relations and Cooperation\\" and to conclude a second arms deal worth about $385 million.  Ogaden War  Moscow's public embrace of Mengistu concerned Siad Barre's regime in Somalia, who worried about the implications of friendly Soviet-Ethiopian relations on their own alliance with the USSR. After rejecting a Soviet proposal for a four-nation Marxist‚ÄìLeninist confederation, the Somali government launched an offensive in July 1977 with the intent of capturing Ethiopia's Ogaden region, starting the Ogaden War. Though Somalia appeared to be on the brink of victory after gaining control of 90% of the area, the Ethiopians were able to launch a counter offensive with the help of newly arrived Soviet arms and a South Yemeni brigade. Infuriated by Soviet support for the Ethiopians, Somalia annulled its treaty with the Soviet Union and expelled all Soviet advisors in the country. Consequently, the USSR orchestrated a massive transport of armaments, Cuban combat troops and Soviet military advisors to Ethiopia. By March 1978, Somali forces had been pushed out of the Ogaden.  1978‚Äì1985  Following the Ogaden War, the Soviet Union strengthened its ties to Ethiopia. Moscow provided the Derg with more than $11 billion in military aid, leading to the creation of the largest army in sub-Saharan Africa. Soviet support was critical in the continuing suppression of Eritrean and Tigrean separatists. The USSR established naval, air and land bases in Ethiopia, notably facilities for naval reconnaissance flights in Asmara. Politically, the Soviet Union pushed Mengistu to develop a \\"national-democratic\\" regime, along the lines of the Eastern European countries. This was something he did reluctantly, as the Workers' Party of Ethiopia was not established until 1984. Economically, the Soviets provided limited credits to develop basic industries such as utilities. A significant number of Soviet professionals such as doctors and engineers also traveled to Ethiopia.  Soviet \\"New Thinking\\"  The Russian Cultural Centre in Addis Ababa Soviet policy towards Ethiopia remained relatively unchanged until the accession of Mikhail Gorbachev to General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1985. The new Soviet leader sought to reduce East-West tensions in order to pursue domestic political and economic reforms. To this end, Gorbachev called for \\"the just political settlement of international crisis and regional conflicts\\" at the 27th Congress of the Communist Party in March 1986. Soviet intellectuals began to question Moscow's support of socialist leaders who did not have popular support. Gorbachev's de- ideologization of Soviet foreign relations led many Soviet observers to view Mengistu less as the leader of a Leninist vanguard and more as an ineffective dictator struggling to maintain power at Moscow's expense. Signs of Gorbachev's \\"new thinking\\" were evident in Ethiopian relations as early as 1986, when the Soviets pressured Mengistu to agree to face-to-face talks with Somalia's Siad Barre that resulted in the signing of peace accords in 1988. Similarly, Moscow indicated to Mengistu that the arms agreement reached in November 1987 was to be the last of its kind. Despite the urging of Soviet advisers, Mengistu resisted implementing political and economic reforms and banned discussion of perestroika and glasnost from Ethiopian media. It was not until the collapse of the hardline communist regimes in Eastern Europe in late 1989 that Mengistu proposed limited economic liberalization. At the same time Mengistu was resisting reforms, Eritrean and Tigrean insurgents were placing the regime in an increasingly tenuous position. Beginning in mid-1989, Moscow began cutting back weapon deliveries and advised Mengistu to seek a negotiated settlement. In July 1989, the head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's African Department, Yuri Yukalov, met with Eritrean representatives in London in an attempt to advance the peace process. In September 1989, the Soviet Deputy Minister of Defense, General V. Varennikov, delivered a message to Mengistu from Gorbachev confirming Moscow's decision to end military aid to Ethiopia. In early 1990, the Soviet Union sought to further its disengagement from Ethiopia by welcoming the entry of the United States into the diplomatic process. This included mediation between the regime and the Eritrea People's Liberation Front by American Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Herman Cohen. These talks collapsed when the Ethiopian insurgents, under the umbrella grouping known as the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, overthrew the communist dictatorship in May 1991 and forced Mengistu into exile in Zimbabwe.

Soviet era  After the overthrow of the king in Libya and the coming to power of Muammar Gaddafi on 1 September 1969, the Soviet Union became the first country to recognize the new republican regime on 4 September 1969. The leadership of the Libyan Arab Republic immediately declared its desire to develop cooperation with the USSR in all areas. The following years became a period of intense political, trade, economic, cultural and other ties between the two states. The head of Libya paid official visits to the USSR in 1976, 1981 and 1985. Historically, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya under Muammar Gaddafi had good relations with the Soviet Union, which provided the Arab nation with weaponry and military advisers throughout the 1970s and 1980s.Libya - Foreign Relations.

Although Russia has criticized NATO's campaign in Libya, Dmitry Medvedev suggested that Colonel Gaddafi lost legitimacy and requested that he step down. Nonetheless, Russia maintained a diplomatic presence in Tripoli with the Gaddafi government until September 2011 when Moscow switched recognition to the anti-Gaddafi National Transitional Council. Vladimir Putin lashed out at the United States for killing Gaddafi and asked \\"They showed to the whole world how he (Gaddafi) was killed; there was blood all over. Is that what they call a democracy?\\" Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Gaddafi should not have been killed, and added that his death should be investigated.

It was designed in 1962 and completed in 1963. It was one of the few residences designed by Bunshaft. Design The house was contained within a rectangular box, 100 feet (30.5 m) long by 26 feet (7.9 m) wide, with its long dimension tangent to the lagoon's shoreline to the south and raised on a broad six-foot berm above the floodplain. The exterior walls were poured-in-place concrete clad with travertine and the exposed roof structure was made up of pre-stressed concrete beams with a \\"double T\\" shape, exposed on either edge with the openings filled with plate glass clerestory windows. The ends of the house were shaded by a 4-foot (1.2 m) extension of the roof and side walls with a paved strip extending the stone flooring to the edge of the walls. The main living spaces had floor-to-ceiling plate glass openings. Interior walls were white-painted plaster and the floors were travertine over a concrete slab foundation. The entry door, one of only two openings in the solid north wall, opened directly into a small entry hall between the central living room and the master bedroom. Opposite the open living area was a smaller guest bedroom and a study, separated from the living space by a U-shaped kitchen and the guest bath. =Art= The Bunshafts decorated their retreat primarily in off- whites with natural wood and glass and occasional red accents. Lighting was designed to highlight their art collection which included works by Pablo Picasso, Le Corbusier, Jack Youngerman, and Henry Moore as well as rocks with faces painted on them by Mrs Bunshaft. =Sale= When Bunshaft's widow, Nina Wayler, died in 1994, the house and its artworks were willed to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, New York. The Museum sold the house to Martha Stewart for $3.2 million. She commissioned an unsympathetic renovation to be headed by British architect John Pawson. In the course of this project an addition to the home was initiated, but never completed. Stewart transferred the property to her daughter, Alexis, who in turn sold it to Donald Maharam in 2004 for $9.5 million. He demolished it in July 2004 for construction of a new house.

It is distributed and marketed by Cargill as a tabletop sweetener as well as a food ingredient. Truvia is made of stevia leaf extract, erythritol, and natural flavors. Because it comes from the stevia plant, Cargill classifies Truvia as a natural sweetener in addition to being a non-nutritive sweetener, although Cargill has settled lawsuits alleging deceptive marketing of Truvia as \\"natural\\". Since its launch in 2008, Truvia natural sweetener has become the second best- selling sugar substitute in units in the U.S. behind Splenda, surpassing Equal and Sweet'n Low. Truvia competes with Stevia In The Raw, the #2 brand of stevia, owned by Cumberland Packaging who also makes Sweet 'n Low.  Tabletop sweetener  Truvia tabletop sweetener is marketed to consumers as a packet sweetener for food and beverages. This makes it a direct competitor to existing packet sweeteners Splenda (sucralose), Equal (aspartame), Sweet'n Low (saccharin), and table sugar. It is available in the United States in 40-ct, 80-ct, 140-ct, and 240-ct single-serve packages. It is also available in the U.S. in a 9.8 oz \\"spoonable\\" container that is the equivalent of an 80-ct box.Truvia - Where To Buy - Find the Nearest Store One packet of Truvia natural sweetener provides the same sweetness as two teaspoons of sugar. Truvia also makes a 75% reduced calorie sugar blend with stevia sweetener in both Cane Sugar and Brown Sugar varieties.  Ingredients  Truvia ingredients include erythritol (a sugar alcohol), stevia leaf extract, and natural flavorings.  Food ingredient  In addition to the Truvia tabletop sweetener, Truvia is used as a food ingredient. The Truvia web site lists products that use Truvia as a sweetener, including flavors of vitamin water, Sprite Green, All Sport Naturally Zero, Blue Sky Free, Crystal Light Pure, and some varieties of Odwalla juices. Cargill also sells a Truvia Cane Sugar Blend product that is a suitable sugar substitute for baking.  Safety and health effects  = Gastrointestinal side effects = Most of Truvia's side effects are related to erythritol which is a sugar alcohol. Sugar alcohols are valuable as sweeteners since they cause little to no rise in blood glucose levels as sugar does. However, the downside to most sugar alcohols is their propensity to cause gastrointestinal side effects. Erythritol is unique in that among these compounds it has one of the most favorable nutritional profiles. Erythritol is almost as sweet as sucrose, is virtually non-caloric, and cannot be fermented by gut bacteria present in the small intestine. According to Truvia's website, up to 90% of erythritol is absorbed by the small intestine and excreted unchanged in the urine. Only a small amount of it will reach the large intestine where GI symptoms, like bloating, flatulence, and cramping usually originate. Truvia's website claims: > Studies with erythritol show almost no side effects reported unless very > high doses are consumed at a single sitting in liquid form on an empty > stomach(Bornet FR 1996). It took at least 4 times the amount of erythritol > to generate looser stools, compared with the level of sorbitol, a very > commonly used and well tolerated sugar alcohol (Oku T 1996).

This pattern has been seen with many types of > sugars and carbohydrates. There are just some people who may have a limit to > how much they can consume without having mild, brief symptoms.  Controversy  Cargill, the manufacturer of Truvia, has had litigation brought against it in two separate class-action lawsuits in 2013. The suits claimed that Cargill was deceptive in its marketing of Truvia as a \\"natural\\" sweetener, with the suit stating that stevia leaf extract and erythritol are \\"highly processed\\". While the FDA has been generally ambiguous about its opinion of the use of \\"natural\\" as a qualifier for food, Cargill decided to settle out of court. In 2014, Cargill settled a class-action lawsuit grounded in false and misleading advertising for $6.1 million.

Naval Institute Press, 1979. pg33 Maury was convinced that the only way to defend the coastlines against Union assaults was through the widespread use of naval mines. Mines were inexpensive and easily produced on a large scale. The low cost and large volume of mines produced would supplement the small naval forces of the Confederacy and make it possible to defend against the superior fleet of the Union navy.Hartmann, Gregory K.Weapons That Wait: Mine Warfare in the United States Naval Institute Press, 1979. pg33 The efforts of the Torpedo Bureau and the Torpedo Corps proved to be worth the investment of the Confederacy. For the relative low cost of the mines they did a tremendous amount of damage to the Union forces, sinking a total of 27 Union naval vessels.Duncan, Robert C. Ph.D. America's Use of Sea Mines. United States Naval Ordnance Laboratory, 1962. pg29. Features The most successful naval mine of the Confederacy is known as the ‚ÄòSinger‚Äô mine, so-called because it was invented by a member of the family which owned and operated the Singer Corporation. The ‚ÄòSinger‚Äô was a manually laid moored contact mine; it was set off when struck by an object with sufficient force to trigger the automatic fuse. The body of the mine was made from sheets of iron and was filled with a charge of 55-65 pounds of gunpowder.Duncan, Robert C. Ph.D. America's Use of Sea Mines. United States Naval Ordnance Laboratory, 1962. pg26. The automatic fuse consisted of a heavy metal cap that would be released by the force of a ship impacting it. As the cap was released it triggered a spring mechanism that struck a fulminating charge, in the form of a percussion cap, which detonated the main explosive. It was one of the first mines equipped with a safety mechanism to prevent an accidental explosion. While being handled and during the planting of the mine a safety pin prevented the spring from accidentally triggering the fulminating charge. This pin was removed after the mine was in position. The only major drawback of the ‚ÄòSinger‚Äô was that the spring mechanism was exposed to the water. When deployed in salt water sea growth would eventually develop on the spring mechanism, effectively preventing it from striking the fulminating charge within the mine. This flaw in the design caused Confederate minefields, especially in tropical waters, to become inert after a period of time.

Mongolia has an embassy in Moscow, three consulate generals (in Irkutsk, Kyzyl and Ulan Ude), and a branch in Yekaterinburg.

Over the next seventy years, Mongolia \\"pursued policies in imitation of the devised by the USSR\\" as a Soviet satellite state. Mongolian supreme leader Khorloogiin Choibalsan, acting under Soviet instructions, carried out a mass terror from 1936 to 1952 (see Stalinist repressions in Mongolia), with the greatest number of arrests and executions (targeting in particular the Buddhist clergy) occurring between September 1937 and November 1939. Soviet influences pervaded Mongolian culture throughout the period, and schools through the nation, as well as the National University of Mongolia, emphasized Marxism-Leninism. Nearly every member of the Mongolian political and technocratic elite, as well as many members of the cultural and artistic elite, were educated in the USSR or one of its Eastern European allies. The Mongolian economy was heavily reliant on the Soviet bloc for electric power, trade, and investment. The MPR collapsed in 1990 and the first democratically elected government took office the same year, leading to \\"a wedge in the previously close relationship between Mongolia and the Soviet bloc.\\" After 1992, Russian technical aid stopped, and Russia made a request to Mongolia to pay back all the aid which it had received from the Soviet Union from 1946 to 1990, a figure which the Soviets estimated at 11.6 billion Soviet transferable rubles (disputed by the Mongolians).Alan J. K. Sanders, \\"Russia: Relations With Mongolia\\" in Historical Dictionary of Mongolia (3d ed.: Scarecrow Press, 2010), pp. 616-23. The communist regimes of Mongolia and the USSR forged close bilateral relations and cooperation. Both nations established close industrial and trade links, especially with the Soviet republics in Central Asia and Mongolia consistently supported the Soviet Union on international issues. Mongolia sought Russian aid to allay fears of Chinese expansionism and a large number of Soviet forces were permanently deployed in Mongolia. In 1986, both countries signed a treaty of peace, friendship and cooperation. Mongolia sided with the Soviet Union following the Sino-Soviet split in the 1950s. Following the example of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of improving ties with the West and China, Mongolia improved its relations with the United States and China. In 1989, Mongolia and the Soviet Union finalized plans for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Mongolia. Modern era Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, Mongolia's trade with Russia declined by 80% and China's relations and influence over Mongolia increased. However, Russia has sought to rebuild strong relations with Mongolia in recent years to enhance its standing as a regional power. In 2000, the Russian President Vladimir Putin made a landmark visit to Mongolia‚Äîthe first by a Russian head of state since Leonid Brezhnev in 1974Montsame News Agency. Mongolia. 2006, Foreign Service Office of Montsame News Agency, , p. 55 and one of the first of Putin's presidency‚Äîand renewed a major bilateral treaty. The visit and improvement in bilateral relations was popularly welcomed in Mongolia as countering China's influence. Russia lowered prices of oil and energy exports to Mongolia and enhanced cross-border trade. The Russian government wrote off 98% of Mongolia's state debt and an agreement was signed to build an oil pipeline from Russia to China through Mongolia.

History Almazbek Atambayev with Vladimir Putin. Whereas the other Central Asian republics have sometimes complained of Russian interference, Kyrgyzstan has more often wished for more attention and support from Moscow than it has been able to obtain. For all the financial support that the world community has offered, Kyrgyzstan remains economically dependent on Russia, both directly and through Kazakhstan. In early 1995, Askar Akayev, the then President of Kyrgyzstan, attempted to sell Russian companies controlling shares in the republic's twenty-nine largest industrial plants, an offer that Russia refused.Martha Brill Olcott. \\"Russia\\". Kyrgyzstan: a country study (Glenn E. Curtis, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (March 1996). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Akayev has been equally enthusiastic about more direct forms of reintegration, such as the Eurasian Union that the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, proposed in June 1994. Because Kyrgyzstan presumably would receive much more from such a union than it would contribute, Akayev's enthusiasm has met with little response from Russia and the other, larger states that would be involved in such an arrangement. Akayev's invitation for Russian border guards to take charge of Kyrgyzstan's Chinese border, a major revision of his policy of neutrality, was another move toward reintegration. The Kyrgyzstani government also has felt compelled to request Russia's economic protection. The harsh reality of Kyrgyzstan's economic situation means that the nation is an inevitable international client state, at least for the foreseeable future. Despite concerted efforts to seek international \\"sponsors,\\" Akayev has not received much more than a great deal of international good will. Even if the president had not lived seventeen years in Russia himself and even if his advisers, family, and friends were not all Soviet-era intellectuals with a high degree of familiarity with Russia, economic necessity probably would push Kyrgyzstan further toward Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin and former Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek BakievOn his February 1994 visit to Moscow, Akayev signed several economic agreements. Having promised the republic a 75 billion ruble line of credit (presumably for use in 1994) and some US$65 million in trade agreements, Russia also promised to extend to Kyrgyzstan most favoured nation status for the purchase of oil and other fuels. For its part, Kyrgyzstan agreed to the creation of a Kyrgyz-Russian investment company, which would purchase idle defence-related factories in the republic to provide employment for the increasingly dissatisfied Russian population of Kyrgyzstan. In early 1995, Prime Minister Apas Jumagulov of Kyrgyzstan and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin of Russia signed a series of agreements establishing bilateral coordination of economic reform in the two states, further binding Kyrgyzstan to Russia. After lobbying hard for inclusion, Kyrgyzstan became a member of the customs union that Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan established in February 1996. For its part, Russia sees aid to Kyrgyzstan as a successful precedent in its new policy of gaining influence in its \\"near abroad,\\" the states that once were Soviet republics. Russia does not want a massive in-migration of Russians from the new republics; some 2 million ethnic Russians moved back to Russia between 1992 and 1995. Akayev, on the other hand, must find a way to stem the loss of his Russian population, which already has caused an enormous deficit of doctors, teachers, and engineers. Bishkek's gigantic Dordoy Bazaar, served by special shuttle buses from Siberia, is as an important center for supplying Chinese consumer goods to the Russian marketSebastien Peyrouse, Economic Aspects of China-Central Asia Rapprochment . Central Asia - Caucasus Institute, Silk Road Studies Program. 2007. p.18. For these reasons, despite opposition from Kyrgyz nationalists and other independence-minded politicians, in 1995 Akayev granted the request of Russian president Boris Yeltsin to review the constitutional provision making Kyrgyz the sole official language. Early in 1996, Kyrgyzstan took legal steps toward making Russian the republic's second official language, subject to amendment of the constitution. That initiative coincided with the customs union signed with Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus in February 1996. The long-term success of Akayev's search for reintegration is questionable because of Kyrgyzstan's minimal strategic importance and the potential cost to an outside country supporting the republic's shaky economy. In February 2009 the Russian government pledged to write off Kyrgyzstan's $180 million debt as well as promising to lend a further $2 billion, give $150 million in direct aid and subsidise the building of the Kambarata-1 hydropower plant at the Kambaratinsk Dam.China, US, Russia eye Bishkek Vladimir Putin and Sooronbay Jeenbekov.

Economic Cooperation Both Kyrgyzstan and Russia are members of the Eurasian Economic Union. In March 2019, the Russian government announced that it would give Kyrgyzstan a $30 million (USD) in economic and military aid to Kyrgyzstan.https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/03/28/russia-gives- kyrgyzstan-30m-grant-as-putin-visits-ally-a64986 Military cooperation Russian defence minister Sergey Shoygu during a meeting with President Sooronbay Jeenbekov and Major General Rayimberdi Duishenbiev in Bishkek, April 2019.

On 20 September 2012 Russia and Kyrgyzstan signed an agreement in which Russia is allowed to have a joint military base in Kyrgyzstan for 15 years starting from 2017. The agreement was signed in Bishkek between Vladimir Putin and Almazbek Atambayev. Putin stated that the joint military base will be a significant factor adding to the stability in the country and the whole region.

Plot summary The book begins roughly 5 months after the events of Evil Genius. Cadel is now living with foster parents in a state of legal limbo, not knowing where he was born or his true father. His life is made even worse due to his foster brother \\"Mace\\" (real name: Thomas) is constantly bullying him. With no school to attend due to his questionable legal status, Cadel spends his time either on the computer, idling or visiting Sonja. The police and the FBI also occasionally turn up to question him on what he knows about Dr. Darkkon, Prosper English and the Axis Institute. During these questionings Cadel meets Saul Greeniaus, a detective who is now in charge of his case. His style puts him in conflict with Cadel's social worker, Fiona Currey. On his second visit to Sonja he is confronted by Trader Lynch and Judith Bashford. Trader and Judith attempt to convince Sonja and Cadel to join Genius Squad, An organisation formed to take down GENOME [a corporation founded by Darkkon] which is funded by Rex Austin, an American billionaire who suspects the company murdered his son, Jimmy. The book ends with Cadel being told that a man named Chester Cramp is his father. He is offered a spot in Fiona and Saul's family While Saul and Fiona initially object, they relent after a particularly heated confrontation with \\"Mace\\". Cadel arrives at the youth home, where Saul and Fiona help him move his belongings. Cadel is introduced to Devin and Lexi Winiecki, Hamish Primrose, Dot[the sister of Com from Evil Genius] and the rest of the adult staff. While Genius Squad works away, trying to avoid notice by Cadel's various bodyguards, they uncover a web of deceit, crimes and cerebral implants. During this time, \\"Mace\\" finds the address of the Genius Squad foster house and attempts to frame Cadel for theft by planting a stolen watch on him (a plan which ultimately fails and leads to Mace's arrest). Cadel also finds that Gazo Kovacs has made contact with GenoME, unaware of their sinister intentions. Unfortunately, GenoME manages to spring Prosper from jail and he immediately moves to kidnap Cadel. Cadel is taken to the house of Judith, one of the other members of Genius squad. From here, Prosper flees to a private air strip to leave the country after Cadel attempts to contact Saul for help. Saul gets a group of police officers down to the airport in time to save Cadel, but Prosper manages to get away. At this point, paternity tests show that Prosper English isn't really Cadel's father, even though he thought he was. Cadel's real father is Chester Cramp, who runs Fountain Pharmaceuticals, another Darkkon corporation. However, with Chester sitting in an American Jail. Cadel agrees to being adopted by Saul and Fiona, who happened to be getting married. Saul finally finds out about Genius Squad, and though he is very upset that Cadel lied to him for so long, he agrees to let Genius Squad live on.

He was educated for the profession at the University of Berlin and was a skilled dentist before the establishment of dental schools in America. He was fluent in 7 languages and as many dialects. Neibaur was born in 1808 to Nathan and Rebecca Peretz Neibaur in Ehrenbreitstein, near Koblenz. Because that area had been incorporated into France by Napoleon, Neibaur's father served as a surgeon in the Army of France. Neibaur was first educated to be a rabbi but concluded to become a surgeon and dentist. He received a degree to that end in 1827, before his 20th birthday. Neibaur converted to Christianity approximately two years later. He moved to Preston, England, in 1830. On 15 September 1834, Neibaur married Ellen Breakel, who was from a Church of England family. In 1837 he was converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints faith after reading the Book of Mormon in three days, but was persuaded to delay his baptism until the following spring that he might be more prepared for the ordinance. He was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day SaintsManuscript History of the Church, LDS Church Archives, book A-1, p. 37; reproduced in Dean C. Jessee (comp.) (1989).

Neibaur arrived in Nauvoo, Illinois on 18 April 1841.Millennial Star 4, no. 10 (February 1844): 147. There he established his dental practice and developed a close friendship with Joseph Smith, Jr., whom he helped study GermanSmith, Joseph (B. H. Roberts, ed.) History of the Church, vol. 6, p. 426. and Hebrew. In 1846, after Smith's death, Neibaur and his wife remained in Nauvoo later than the first Mormon pioneers because Ellen was pregnant, but joined the second party. Neibaur was among the defenders of the city during the Battle of Nauvoo. Neibaur then went to Winter Quarters, Nebraska, and arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, rejoining with the main body of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints (LDS Church) in 1848. In Utah Territory he continued the practice of dentistry and was a manufacturer of matches. He was also the primary person to introduce Mormonism to Morris D. Rosenbaum, a Jew who later became his son- in-law. Neibaur's daughter Rebecca married industrialist and LDS Church leader Charles W. Nibley, thus Rosenbaum's brother-in-law, and early business partner. Rosenbaum was instrumental, with his second father-in-law President Lorenzo Snow, in the founding and development of Brigham City, Utah, and served as county commissioner and president of the North Germany Mission. Alexander Neibaur‚Äôs eldest daughter, Margaret Jane, married William Miller, the son of Eleazer Miller. Margaret Neibaur Miller‚Äôs father-in-law, Eleazer, converted and baptized Brigham Young (who would become the second prophet and President of The LDS Church). Neibaur is a great-grandfather of scholars Hugh, Reid, and Richard Nibley, as well as founder of a large and diverse family to be found throughout the West. His great-great-granddaughter is American sociologist, life coach, and best-selling author Martha Beck.  Notes   References  * Cornwall, J. Spencer.

Originally created by Simon Delaney and co-written with director Kieran Carney, the series dealt with Diogo Bernardo Furlong (Simon Delaney), a Portuguese cabaret singer and songwriter, who travels to Ireland to scatter his mother's ashes over the grave of his Irish father. Plot The show centered on a Portuguese man seeking clues regarding his parent. After the death of his mother, Diogo Bernardo Furlong visits Ireland to scatter his mother's ashes on the grave of his father. His father had died some years before in a boating accident on Lough Allen, and he was raised by his mother in Alentejo, Portugal. His only clue to his father's grave is a postcard that his mother gave to him with a picture of a church. Leaving behind his fianc√©e Claudia, he arrives in Dublin and is met by an acquaintance and music promoter David Daly (Garrett Keogh). Promising to help Diogo find his father's grave, Daly persuades Diogo to take a musical tour of Ireland with him and his daughter Margaret (Orla Fitzgerald), an aspiring filmmaker who reluctantly agrees to manage Diogo. A backup band is hired and, joined by Margaret's boyfriend John Ford (Simon Keogh) and his friend Sean Flanagan (Domhnall Gleeson), Diogo and The Fandango's begin a tour of Ireland's graveyards and other lesser-known legendary venues, including Ballymore Eustace, Roscommon, Strokestown, Ballaghaderreen, Ballagh and Westport. Reception Although Delaney had come off a successful run on the sitcom Bachelors Walk, the series received poor reviews from critics. Delaney's general acting and musical performance were particularly criticized. His portrayal of Diogo, a character he used to perform between takes during Bachelors Walk \\"just to keep the crew amused\\", was seen by critics as too similar to his character on Bachelors Walk and in other film and television appearances.

He was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2008. Kethledge appeared on Donald Trump's list of potential Supreme Court of the United States nominees in 2016, and was described by press reports as a finalist in President Trump's nomination to replace Anthony Kennedy on the court.  Early life and education  Kethledge was born in Summit, New Jersey, the son of Diane and Ray Kethledge. His paternal grandfather was Raymond W. Ketchledge, an engineer who invented an acoustically guided torpedo that was used to sink dozens of German U-boats during World War II. He grew up in Michigan, and has since lived in Michigan, with the exception of the three years he worked in Washington D.C. Kethledge graduated from Birmingham Groves High School in the Birmingham Public School District. He attended the University of Michigan, graduating in 1989 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history. He then attended the University of Michigan Law School, graduating magna cum laude (and second in his class) with a Juris Doctor in 1993.  Career  After graduating, Kethledge clerked for Sixth Circuit Judge Ralph B. Guy Jr. in 1994 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. After finishing his clerkship, he served as judiciary counsel to Michigan Senator Spencer Abraham from 1995 to 1997. Following that, Kethledge clerked for Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1997‚Äì1998, where he was a co-clerk with Stephanos Bibas. After completing his Supreme Court clerkship, Kethledge returned to Michigan in 1998 to join the law firm of Honigman, Miller, Schwartz & Cohn, where he became a partner. In 2001, he joined Ford Motor Company as in-house counsel in the company's Dearborn headquarters. He later joined Feeney, Kellett, Wienner & Bush as a partner. In 2003, Kethledge co-founded a boutique litigation firm, now known as Bush, Seyferth & Paige, with its office in Troy, Michigan. In addition to his duties as a federal judge, Kethledge teaches a course at the University of Michigan Law School called \\"Fundamentals of Appellate Practice,\\" which focuses on the elements of good legal writing.  Federal judicial service  Kethledge was first nominated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit by President George W. Bush on June 28, 2006, to replace Judge James L. Ryan. From November 2001 to March 2006, Henry Saad had been nominated to the seat, but he had been filibustered by the Senate Democrats and later withdrew. Kethledge's nomination lapsed when the 109th Congress adjourned in December 2006. Bush again nominated Kethledge on March 19, 2007. However, his nomination stalled for over a year due to opposition from Michigan's two Democratic Senators, Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow. In April 2008, the Bush administration struck a deal with Levin and Stabenow to break the logjam on judicial nominees to federal courts in Michigan. In exchange for Levin and Stabenow supporting Kethledge's nomination (and that of United States Attorney Stephen J. Murphy III to a district court position), Bush nominated Democratic Michigan state judge Helene White, a failed former Clinton nominee to the Sixth Circuit who had been married to Levin's cousin at the time of her first nomination. Soon afterwards, Kethledge, White, and Murphy were granted a joint hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 7, 2008. Kethledge was voted out of committee by voice vote on June 12, 2008. On June 24, 2008, he was confirmed by voice vote, almost exactly two years after his original nomination. He received his commission on July 7, 2008. Kethledge was the eighth judge nominated to the Sixth Circuit by Bush and confirmed by the United States Senate. In 2014, The Wall Street Journal's 'Review & Outlook' editorial described Kethledge's ruling in EEOC v. Kaplan as the \\"Opinion of the Year\\". In 2016, in another 'Review & Outlook' editorial, the Wall Street Journal cited Kethledge's opinion in In re United States, 817 F.3d 953 (6th Cir. 2016), saying: \\"Writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, Judge Raymond Kethledge dismantled that argument and excoriated the IRS for stonewalling...\\" Commentators have noted that Kethledge has \\"broadly criticized judicial deference and specifically criticized deference to federal agencies under Chevron\\" and \\"has set himself apart as a dedicated defender of the Constitution's structural protections.\\" In May 2016, Kethledge was included on President Donald Trump's list of potential Supreme Court justices. On July 2, 2018, Kethledge was one of the four circuit judges given a personal 45-minute interview in consideration of the vacancy created by Justice Kennedy's retirement. = Judge Kethledge's originalism = In July 2018, conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt wrote an op- ed in The Washington Post endorsing Kethledge for the seat left vacant by Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States Anthony Kennedy's retirement and declared, \\"Kethledge has been faithful for more than a decade to the originalist approach.\\" In Turner v. United States, 885 F.3d 949, 955 (6th Cir. 2018), Kethledge joined a concurring opinion that argued \\"faithful adherence to the Constitution and its Amendments requires us to examine their terms as they were commonly understood when the text was adopted and ratified.\\" In Tyler v. Hillsdale Cty. Sheriff's Dep't, 837 F.3d 678, 710 (6th Cir. 2016). Kethledge joined a concurring opinion that quoted District of Columbia v. Heller and declared, \\"What determines the scope of the right to bear arms are the 'historical justifications' that gave birth to it.\\"  Book  In 2017, Kethledge coauthored a book with Michael S. Erwin, a West Point graduate and military veteran. The book, entitled Lead Yourself First: Inspiring Leadership Through Solitude, details how leaders can benefit from solitude. Among the leaders profiled in the book are General James Mattis, Pope John Paul II, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., and many others. Through these profiles, Kethledge illustrates how leaders must identify their first principles \\"with enough clarity and conviction to hold fast to [them]‚Äîeven when, inevitably, there are great pressures to yield.\\" Doing so, Kethledge writes, requires \\"conviction of purpose, and the moral courage\\" to choose principle over popularity. The book has been reviewed on Above The Law, in The Washington Post, and in Publishers Weekly. The Wall Street Journal said the book \\"makes a compelling argument for the integral relationship between solitude and leadership.\\"  Notable opinions  The Green Bag Almanac has recognized Judge Kethledge for \\"exemplary legal writing\\" in two different years: in 2013 (for Bennett v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance) and in 2017 (for Wayside Church v. Van Buren County). = Major cases = In United States v. Carpenter (2016), Kethledge wrote for the divided court when it found that the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution did not require police to get a warrant before obtaining the cell site location information of a mobile phone. In June 2018, the Supreme Court reversed that judgment by a vote of 5‚Äì4. In Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community (2012), Kethledge wrote for a unanimous court when it found that tribal sovereign immunity and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act prevented the state from blocking construction of an Indian casino. In May 2014, the Supreme Court affirmed that judgment by a vote of 5‚Äì4.. In 2008, Kethledge wrote a concurrence when the full en banc circuit agreed with the Ohio Republican Party's claim that the Help America Vote Act required the state to match voters' registrations with other public records. In October 2008, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed that judgment in an unsigned opinion. Kethledge recused himself when the en banc circuit found that Michigan voters could not amend their constitution to ban affirmative action. In Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (2014), a plurality of the Supreme Court reversed that judgment by a vote of 6‚Äì2.. In June 2017, Kethledge wrote for the en banc circuit when it, by a vote of 9‚Äì6, rejected Gary Otte, Ronald Phillips, and Raymond Tibbetts claims that the method of capital punishment in Ohio violated the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In May 2013, Kethledge wrote for the en banc circuit when it affirmed the death sentence of Marvin Gabrion. Gabrion had murdered Rachel Timmerman, a 19-year-old woman who had reported him for raping her. He bound and gagged her, tied her to concrete blocks, and drowned her in a weedy lake. Because he murdered Timmerman in a national forest, Gabrion committed a federal crime and was also eligible for the death penalty even though the surrounding State of Michigan had outlawed that penalty. The United States charged Gabrion with murder. A jury convicted him and imposed the death penalty. On appeal, Gabrion argued that the district court should have allowed him to argue to the jury that a death sentence was unfair because he would have been ineligible for that sentence had he murdered Timmerman in nearby Michigan territory. According to Gabrion, the murder's location was a \\"circumstances of the offense\\" and thus the kind of \\"mitigating factor\\" the Eighth Amendment and Federal Death Penalty Act allow a jury to weigh during sentencing. Writing for a majority of the en banc court, Judge Kethledge rejected that challenge. He wrote that not every \\"circumstance of the offense\\" is a \\"mitigating\\" factor; otherwise, jurors could consider the \\"moonphase\\" during sentencing. Kethledge further explained that mitigating evidence is evidence relevant to a \\"reasoned moral response to the defendant's background, character, and crime,\\" and that the murder's location was not that kind of evidence. In Bailey v. Callaghan,Bailey v. Callaghan, 715 F.3d 956 (6th Cir. 2013). the Sixth Circuit considered the constitutionality of a Michigan law that made it illegal for public-school employers to use their resources to collect union dues. As a result of the law, unions had to collect their own membership dues from public-school employees. A number of Michigan public- school unions and union members filed suit, alleging that the law was unconstitutional. Judge Kethledge, writing for the majority, disagreed. The law does not violate the First Amendment, Judge Kethledge explained, because the law \\"does not restrict the unions' speech at all: they remain free to speak about whatever they wish.\\" As for the unions' Equal Protection challenge, Kethledge first observed: \\"The applicability of rational-basis review is a strong signal that the issue is one for resolution by the democratic process rather than by the courts.\\" Judge Kethledge then went on to conclude that there is a conceivable legitimate interest in restricting the use of public-school resources. As a result, the law does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. In EEOC v. Kaplan Higher Education Corp., 748 F.3d 749 (6th Cir. 2014), the EEOC alleged that Kaplan's policy of running credit checks on job applicants had a \\"disparate impact\\" on African American applicants. To support its claim, the EEOC hired an expert witness who reviewed an unrepresentative sample of Kaplan job applications and asserted that the credit checks had flagged more African American applicants for scrutiny than white applicants. The purported expert had identified the applicants' races by tasking \\"race raters\\" with \\"eyeballing\\" the applicants' drivers' license photos. The District Court struck the expert's analysis as unreliable. On appeal, Judge Kethledge wrote a unanimous opinion affirming. He explained that the EEOC had relied on a \\"homemade methodology, crafted by a witness with no particular expertise to craft it, administered by persons with no particular expertise to administer it, tested by no one, and accepted only by the witness himself.\\" The Wall Street Journal's Editorial Board later commended Judge Kethledge for writing the \\"Opinion of the Year\\" and delivering a \\"sublime\\" \\"legal smackdown\\" that \\"eviscerated the EEOC like a first-day law student.\\" In In re United States, 817 F.3d 953 (6th Cir. 2016), the NorCal Tea Party Patriots filed a class action against the IRS for targeting conservative groups \\"for mistreatment based on their political views.\\" The district court ordered the IRS to disclose, among other internal records, the list of the groups it had targeted. Rather than complying with that order, the IRS appealed. In an opinion for the unanimous majority, Judge Kethledge called the allegations \\"[a]mong the most serious [] a federal court can address\\" and, according to the Wall Street Journal, \\"excoriated the IRS for stonewalling during discovery.\\" Judge Kethledge ordered the IRS to \\"comply with the district court's discovery orders . . . without redactions, and without further delay.\\" And he rebuked the IRS's attorneys for failing to uphold the Justice Department's \\"long and storied tradition of defending the nation's interest and enforcing its laws‚Äîall of them, not just selective ones‚Äîin a manner worthy of the Department's name.\\" That opinion was also praised by the Wall Street Journal's Editorial Board. = Other cases = In 2012, in an opinion by Kethledge in Sierra Club v. Korleski,Sierra Club v. Korleski, 681 F.3d 342 (6th Cir. 2012). the Sixth Circuit rejected the argument by environmental groups and the federal Environmental Protection Agency that private persons can sue the State of Ohio under the Clean Air Act's citizen- suit provision to enforce a state-enacted pollution-control plan against minor polluters. The court held, based on Bennett v. Spear,Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 (1997). that the citizen-suit provision does not permit a citizen to sue a state for its failure to perform a regulatory duty. Kethledge wrote that, \\"[i]n construing a statute, the words matter.\\" And the court overturned its own precedent reaching the opposite conclusion as superseded by Bennett, describing the earlier decision as \\"a bottle of dubious vintage, whose contents turned to vinegar long ago, and which we need not consume here.\\" Also in 2012, in United States v. CTH,United States v. CTH, 685 F.3d 560 (6th Cir. 2012) a district court found, by a \\"preponderance\\" of the evidence, that the defendant had distributed enough heroin to qualify for up to a 60-month maximum sentence rather than a shorter 12-month maximum sentence. Writing for the court, Kethledge confronted the question whether the Due Process Clause required the district court to find the heroin quantity at the higher standard of \\"beyond a reasonable doubt.\\" To resolve the case, Kethledge applied the relevant Supreme Court precedent. He noted that, in In re Winship, the Supreme Court held: \\"[T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\\" And in Apprendi, which rests on Winship, the Supreme Court \\"held that '‚Ä¶ such facts'‚Äîmeaning facts increasing a defendant's statutory-maximum sentence‚Äî'must be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.'\\" Faced with this precedent, Kethledge found the government's arguments meritless, writing: \\"The government, for its part, offers no path out of this box canyon of precedent. . . . The government gives us no reason, therefore, not to apply Apprendi's due-process holding to CTH's case.\\" The court thus held that the district court's drug-quantity finding should have been made beyond a reasonable doubt. In Waldman v. Stone,Waldman v. Stone, 698 F.3d 910 (6th Cir. 2012) the Sixth Circuit held, in an opinion by Kethledge, that bankruptcy courts lack constitutional authority to enter final judgment on a state-law claim brought by a debtor to augment the estate, even where both parties consent to resolution by a bankruptcy court. The Sixth Circuit concluded that to grant final judgment on those claims would be to exercise the judicial power of the United States, which bankruptcy judges may not do because they lack the life tenure and salary protection guaranteed by Article III of the Constitution, and this infringement on the separation of powers cannot be waived by private litigants. The Supreme Court later reached the opposite conclusion in Wellness International Network, Ltd. v. Sharif, 1353 S. Ct. 1932 (2015), over the dissent of Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justices Scalia and Thomas. In United States v. Bistline, 665 F.3d 758 (6th Cir. 2013), Richard Bistline pled guilty to knowingly possessing child pornography. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, Bistline's recommended sentence was 63 to 78 months' imprisonment. The district court rejected that recommendation, however, on the ground that Congress had written the relevant guideline itself, rather than allowing the Sentencing Commission to do so. The court then sentenced Bistline to a single night's confinement in the courthouse lockup, plus ten years' supervised release. The Sixth Circuit, in an opinion by Judge Kethledge, vacated that sentence as substantively unreasonable. Judge Kethledge explained that the Commission had the authority to fix criminal penalties only because Congress had given the Commission that authority. Thus, saying that \\"Congress has encroached too much on the Commission's authority\\" was \\"like saying a Senator has encroached upon the authority of her chief of staff, or a federal judge upon that of his law clerk.\\" It may be true that Congress had marginalized the Sentencing Commission's role, Judge Kethledge concluded, but \\"Congress can marginalize the Commission all it wants: Congress created it.\\" In United States v. Hughes, 733 F.3d 642 (6th Cir. 2013), Albert Hughes pled guilty to federal drug charges and was sentenced to the mandatory minimum. The Sixth Circuit later vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing. Before the resentencing could occur, Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act, which reduced the applicable mandatory minimum. The district court nevertheless reinstated the same sentence. The Sixth Circuit affirmed. In an opinion by Judge Kethledge, the court held that a crime's penalty is normally the one on the books when the crime was committed, and Hughes could not point to anything that overcame that presumption. The court also rejected the argument that three other statutory provisions, when read together, created a \\"background sentencing principle\\" that the court should follow the latest views of Congress and the Sentencing Commission. Judge Kethledge explained that this argument \\"has little to do with what the statutes actually say, and more to do, apparently, with one's perception of their mood or animating purpose.\\" He continued: \\"But statutes are not artistic palettes, from which the court can daub different colors until it obtains a desired effect. Statutes are instead law, which are bounded in a meaningful sense by the words that Congress chose in enacting them.\\" In In re Dry Max Pampers Litigation, 724 F.3d 713 (6th Cir. 2013), the Sixth Circuit reviewed a class-action settlement agreement that awarded each named plaintiff $1000 per child, awarded class counsel $2.73 million, and \\"provide[d] the unnamed class members with nothing but nearly worthless injunctive relief.\\" Judge Kethledge, writing for the majority, rejected the settlement as unfair. He found that the parties' assertions regarding the value of the settlement to unnamed class members were \\"premised upon a fictive world, where harried parents of young children clip and retain Pampers UPC codes for years on end, where parents lack the sense (absent intervention by P&G;) to call a doctor when their infant displays symptoms like boils and weeping discharge, where those same parents care as acutely as P&G; does about every square centimeter of a Pampers box, and where parents regard Pampers.com, rather than Google, as their portal for important information about their children's health.\\" As a result, Judge Kethledge explained, \\"[t]he relief that the settlement provide[d] to unnamed class member [was] illusory. But one fact about this settlement is concrete and indisputable: $2.73 million is $2.73 million.\\" Judge Kethledge also found that the named plaintiffs were inadequate representatives of the class. \\"The $1000-per-child payments,\\" Judge Kethledge concluded, \\"provided a disincentive for the class members to care about the adequacy of the relief afforded to unnamed class members, and instead encouraged the class representatives 'to compromise the interest of the class for personal gain.'\\" In John B. v. Emkes, 710 F.3d 394 (6th Cir. 2013), a federal district court had entered a consent decree governing the steps that Tennessee's Medicaid Program had to take in order to achieve and maintain compliance with the Medicaid Act. Tennessee later moved to vacate the consent decree largely on the ground that the state was in substantial compliance with the decree's provisions. The district court granted the motion. In an opinion by Judge Kethledge, the Sixth Circuit affirmed. Judge Kethledge explained that Tennessee was in substantial compliance with all but one part of the decree. He then explained that the failure to comply with that provision did not justify continuing federal control of the state's Medicaid program. \\"Consent decrees are not entitlements,\\" Judge Kethledge wrote; instead, \\"a decree may remain in force only as long as it continues to remedy a violation of federal law.\\" And because Tennessee had brought its Medicaid program into compliance with the Medicaid Act, continued enforcement of the decree was not only unnecessary, but improper. In Shane Group, Inc. v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, 825 F.3d 299 (6th Cir. 2016), Blue Cross customers filed a class action alleging that Blue Cross conspired with hospitals throughout Michigan to artificially inflate insurance rates by a total of more than $13 billion. Class Counsel and Blue Cross, however, agreed to settle the claims for only $30 million, largely on the basis of an expert report that the district court had sealed from public view. The district court refused to let the absent class members examine the sealed report and then approved the settlement over their objections and without meaningful scrutiny. Judge Kethledge, writing for a unanimous panel, vacated the settlement agreement and ordered the district court to unseal the substantive filings, restart the objection process, and ensure that the proposed settlement agreement received meaningful scrutiny on remand. In Wheaton v. McCarthy, 800 F.3d 282 (6th Cir. 2015), the Sixth Circuit held, in an opinion by Judge Kethledge, that an Ohio administrative agency had unreasonably determined that the statutory term \\"family\\" did not include a Medicare beneficiary's live-in spouse. The court noted that some statutory terms \\"are ambiguous only at the margins, while clearly encompassing a certain core.\\" Thus, \\"[t]he term 'planet' might be ambiguous as applied to Pluto, but is clear as applied to Jupiter.\\"  Personal life  Kethledge is married to Jessica Levinson Kethledge, who worked for the Red Cross.

Recorded by Paul Whiteman & his Orchestra, it became one of the biggest hits of 1926, topping the charts for 11-weeks beginning March 30, 1926.CD liner notes: Chart-Toppers of the Twenties, 1998 ASV Ltd.  In popular culture  Other popular recordings in 1926 were by Ben Selvin & His Orchestra (vocal by Irving Kaufman); The Revelers; Ross Gorman; and Jesse Crawford. That year Carlos Gardel recorded Valencia with different lyrics, as Maestro Padilla frequently worked in Buenos Aires. Tony Martin recorded the song in 1950, and his cover reached #18 on the U.S. chart. This song was one of tenor Mario Lanza classic performances since 1954. It also appears in El √∫ltimo cupl√© (1957) soundtrack, sung by Sara Montiel, and in 1994 Sara Montiel would perform this song live during the Valencia Fallas celebrations. The song appears on the spanish The Shadows EP Los Shadows, released in 1963. In 2008 it was included in Placido Domingo's Because you're mine. This march is considered the informal hymn of Valencia. It is specially loved in Valencia, as in March every year during the Fallas in Valencia the Valencia pasodoble is heard during the L'Ofrena de flors (during the offering of flowers) to Our Lady of the Forsaken. Influences on literature In the novel The Invention of Morel, the Argentinian writer Adolfo Bioy Casares often quotes to this song, together with \\"Tea for Two\\". The main character is alone, in a wild island, when he starts to hear this unexpected music. In the plot the song stands for the lightheartedness of the high society, that somehow violates the wild space of a lonely island, were the main character is literally \\"struggling for survival\\". One can argue that Bioy Casares chose this song mainly because it was a strong symbol to represent the society of the 1940s. The saxophonist Pablo in Herman Hesse's novel Steppenwolf mentions this song as an example of melodies quietly reproduced every night by dreamy people.

By extension, the term refers to the style of literature that it encouraged. 166 issues (numbered from 0 to 165) appeared between 1925 and May 1944. The journal was founded by Roparz Hemon and Olier Mordrel. Manifesto The journal published a manifesto in February 1925. The manifesto stated the aim of Gwalarn was to prove that the Breton language could be a vehicle of high culture. This was written in response to some French authors who argued that Breton was nothing more than the crude speech of peasants, a view articulated by Victor Hugo, among others. > Gwalarn is above all something new and unique: a literary magazine aimed at > the Breton elite, and whose ambition is nothing less than setting Breton > literature on the road that follows the longstanding literature of many > small nations: Bohemia, Flanders, Catalonia, among others...For the first > time, a Breton revue will publish a pure literature, closing the door on > patois... [it] will adopt a language of classical formality with a rigorous > othography. Gwalarn is an experiment: to determine whether there is an > audience in Brittany educated enough to understand literary language (as far > from the language of the Breton peasant as that of Mr. France is of the > French peasant), a public informed enough to engage with a Breton literature > that, while seeking to tap the sap in the genius of the race, wants to be > European in spirit, drawing on modern European literary techniques, both in > expression and in thought.Alain Deniel, Le mouvement breton, Masp√©ro, 1976, > , p. 69 Contents The main contributors were mostly very young. In addition to Hemon, the most important writers were Abeozen, Youenn Drezen, Jakez Riou, Gwilherm Berthou, Yannn-Eozen Jarl, Kenan Kongar, Fant Rozec, Xavier de Langlais, and Maodez Glanndour. These writers produced the \\"classic\\" literary Breton of the twentieth century. The content was varied. There were many Breton translations of famous authors such as Shakespeare, Hawthorne, Boccaccio, Synge, Pushkin, and so on. There was also great emphasis on Celtic traditions and legends such as the Mabinogion. Essays on philosophy and Indo- European cultures were also common, including discussions of Hinduism and Buddhism. It also published essays on current issues, poems and plays. History Olier Mordrel no longer participated in the journal after 1928, but Roparz Hemon stayed on as an editor until the last issue. Gradually, Gwalarn expanded, producing a popular supplement \\"kannadig Gwalarn\\" in 1932 and books for children. The latter were distributed free in schools to children who had participated in essay competitions in the Breton language. Associated with collaborationist politics during World War II, the magazine was linked to the Breton language radio station Radio Rennes Bretagne, which was set up by the Germans. In consequence, it was forced to close after the Liberation of France. After the war, a new magazine with the same function was created under the title Al Liamm, which continued the project of creating a Breton literary culture.

With an enrollment of close to 1025, the school is the largest of the French-language high schools in the Moncton area. It mostly serves the francophone students of the city of Dieppe and the village of Memramcook, New Brunswick. In addition, it is the largest francophone Secondary school in Atlantic Canada. History √âcole Mathieu- Martin opened in 1972 to alleviate the overcrowding of √âcole Vanier the premier French-language High School at Moncton. √âcole Secondaire Vanier, built in 1963 to accommodate 600 students, had over fifteen mobile classrooms attached to its structure with an overflowed student population roster of 1200 in 1970. With the inauguration of the new High School in Dieppe, Vanier morphed into a francophone Junior High School (7-9). Presiding as the principal for both secondary schools, Dollard LeBlanc would retire in 1990 at Mathieu-Martin. Before 1970, School District 15 administered anglophone and francophone schools in the Moncton area and considered a bilingual high school system housed under the same complex in Moncton. This concept would have had accommodated over 5000 students with separate linguistic curriculum but integration for common areas. With the prevalence of francophone students being vulnerable to assimilation within this design, educators and concerned parents alike sternly condemned the unification proposition, which would be a backlash to the minority language and Acadian communities of the province. Hence, Mathieu Martin would be inaugurated as part of the expanded francophone administered School District 13 at its inception.

He later returned to Derby County as manager between 1946 and 1953, taking them to the 1946 FA Cup Final. Derby defeated Charlton Athletic 4‚Äì1 after extra time to win the FA Cup for the first time. Cricket career McMillan also played first-class cricket for Derbyshire. His debut came in the 1922 season against Essex at Derby, where, as a middle order batsman, he was unable to make much headway in the match, bowling a single, expensive over, conceding 14 runs, and finishing not out for 0 in the only innings in which he batted. As there was no play on the first day of the match, it was to end in a draw with the best batting performance of the game coming from Essex's centurion Peter Perrin. McMillan made just one appearance during the following season, and had to wait for more than thirteen months before making his final two appearances, both at home, in 1924. While he scored well in the first match of the season, his second finished with him getting out for a duck. Death McMillan died in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, on 27 September 1963, aged 67.

Billboard ranked it as the No. 61 song for 1972.Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1972 Donny Hathaway plays electric piano on the song and Hubert Laws plays the flute. The single version omits the jazzy daydream-like music heard at the beginning and the ending of the track on the album, because the vocals sounded too psychedelic for most radio airplay. It had been rumoured the song was about Temptations' singer Dennis Edwards, which was confirmed by Franklin in 1999 on The Oprah Winfrey Show.

Objective precision is the process by which certain features (the differentiae) of the real object of a formal concept are excluded from the comprehension of that concept; the object is thus being intentionally transformed into a universal objective concept. Objective precision is thus a process by which universal objective concepts arise. It is the \\"objective\\" aspect of the process of (total) abstraction or concept-formation.  Objective precision and formal precision  Objective precision is distinguished against formal precision. Whereas objective precision is a process on the part of objective concepts (the objective correlates of the mental acts by means of which something is being conceived) formal precision is the corresponding process on the part of formal concepts or the mental acts themselves. Objective and formal precision are the two aspects (objective and subjective) of abstraction.  Nominalism and realism  The two opposing philosophical views on universals, nominalism (or rather conceptualism) and realism can be defined by means of their relation to objective precision: anyone who accepts objective precision, is a philosophical realist; anyone who rejects it, is a conceptualist or nominalist (in a broad sense). In other words, the nominalists reject the idea that our universal mental concepts (formal concepts) require universal intentional objects; thus, according to nominalists, in abstraction only formal precision takes place, no objective precision.  Ontological requirements on the part of the object  The schools are divided in their opinion what constitutes the necessary condition on the part of the object in order that objective precision be possible. According to the Thomists a virtual distinction on the part of the object between the excluded differentia and the arising abstracted objective concept is sufficient to make objective precision possible. According to the Scotists, a formal distinction is generally required, although certain Scotists (like Bartolomeo Mastri) regard virtual distinction as sufficient in certain special cases. Su√°rez defends objective precision but he rejects any distinctions on the part of the object. The nominalists (conceptualists) agree with the Scotists that a formal distinction would be necessary to enable objective precision, but since they regard such a distinction as impossible, they reject objective precision altogether.

The first proposal under the Isinglass name, a high-altitude plane to fly at , was considered an insufficient advancement over existing aircraft; the second, much more advanced design, sometimes referred to as Project Rheinberry,Richelson 2001, p.100. was an air-launched, rocket-powered boost- glide aircraft that would use a very-high-altitude trajectory to avoid defenses. This aircraft was considered too costly for development, and the project was abandoned in 1967. Origins Project Isinglass was developed as a result of the vulnerability of existing crewed reconnaissance aircraft, such as the Lockheed U-2 and the Lockheed A-12, to Soviet air defenses in the early 1960s, catalysed by the shooting down in May 1960 of Francis Gary Powers.Day 2010 Although there were continuing plans to overfly the Soviet Union with the A-12 ‚Äì referred to by the CIA as Project OxcartRich 1994, p.201 ‚Äì these failed to come to pass, and the CIA began plans for an aircraft with superior performance to replace Oxcart. The Convair proposal The initial aircraft proposed under the Project Isinglass name was developed by the Convair division of General Dynamics, and was developed from work done on the Super Hustler, FISH, and Kingfish programs, as well as leveraging off work done on the F-111 tactical bomber. Convair's design utilised avionics and hydraulics systems that had been developed for use by the F-111, and was intended to be capable of cruising at speeds of Mach 4 to Mach 5, at an altitude of . The feasibility study conducted by General Dynamics was completed in the fall of 1964; the aircraft was determined to be too costly, and was also still considered potentially vulnerable to projected Soviet air defense capabilities, so the project was halted. The McDonnell proposal D-21 drones; Isinglass would have been carried and launched in this fashion =Design and development= An alternative design completed by McDonnell Aircraft in 1965 is usually considered part of Project Isinglass, however some documents refer to the aircraft as having been codenamed Project Rheinberry. McDonnell's proposed boost-glide aircraft, submitted to the CIA independently of the Convair Isinglass proposals, featured a small, crewed, rocket-powered craft with a high lift-to-drag ratioSweetman 2008 that would be air-launched by a B-52 bomber while flying over the Atlantic Ocean. The aircraft would ignite its rocket engine and adopt a trajectory that would take it over the Soviet Union at speeds of Mach 20 and at an altitude of over , before descending over the Pacific Ocean to a landing at Groom Lake, Nevada, as a glider, landing on the lake bed using a skid landing gear. The Isinglass/Rheinberry concept was considered to be superior to spy satellites in a number of ways, including rapid turnaround time and quick response capability. As there was little funding to be had from the CIA budget, McDonnell developed the aircraft using its own funds, although technical support gleaned from Oxcart was supplied by the CIA. The McDonnell Isenglass/Rheinberry proposal's shape remains classified, although it has been described as being similar to the Space Shuttle, albeit much reduced in size. A 1/3 cross-sectional model of the aircraft was constructed to illustrate the principles used in its construction. Simulations showed that the aircraft would be essentially unstoppable by existing or projected air defenses; even surface-to-air missiles armed with nuclear warheads could do no better than force the aircraft to change course to avoid the fringe effects of the explosions. =Cancellation= Following fourteen months of work, McDonnell had developed the aircraft to the point where serious proposals were made for its construction. However, neither the CIA nor the National Reconnaissance Office had an official requirement for such an aircraft; in addition, the projected cost of the aircraft was astronomical, the cost for eight aircraft being projected to be $2.6 billion USD in 1965 dollars (inflation adjusted US$ billion in ), a sum considered to be far too high for the available budget. In addition, there were concerns that the aircraft's trajectory could be mistaken for that of an incoming ballistic missile. When the CIA failed to receive approval for funding, McDonnell approached the U.S. Air Force with the project; however the Air Force proved uninterested in adopting the CIA project, despite the support of General Bernard Schriever, chief of the Air Force Systems Command. Therefore, in late 1967 the Isinglass project was terminated, with a brief effort to revive the project in 1968 proving unsuccessful. Engine development Although the development of the Isinglass/Rheinberry aircraft was conducted using McDonnell's own funding, the United States Air Force's Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory did fund the development of the aircraft's intended engine, the Pratt & Whitney XLR-129, intended to be a reusable rocket engine.Atherton 1971, p. 2. To be powered by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen and producing thrust at full throttle, development of the XLR-129 continued even after the cancellation of Project Isinglass, and was considered for use by the Space Shuttle, but was cancelled in the early 1970s.

Miko grabbed the opportunity to film the revolution in hopes of getting the films out of Hungary so the rest of the world could see the brutality of the Soviet Union. The Soviet government found out about his activities and they wanted him and the films he shot. Joseph Miko with wife Eva and Joe jr. fled the country to avoid capture, imprisonment and possible execution. The films Miko shot of the revolution were smuggled out of Hungary in the U.S. diplomatic pouch. In return for providing the American government copies of the films for intelligent purposes, the Miko family was granted passage on the U S Military airlift to the United States. Joseph Miko was one of three Hungarian cinematographer who immigrated to the United States as a result of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Joe Miko‚Äôs close friend, Vilmos Zsigmond eventually become very successful in Hollywood. Zsigmond received an Academy Award for Close Encounters of the Third Kind and was again nominated for the Black Dahlia. After working on a couple of low budget movies with Vilmos Zsigmond such as The Sadist, Joseph Miko left the industry and became a successful businessman in Santa Monica, California. 80% of the movies that exist in the world of the 1956 Hungarian revolution were shot by Miko who has since donated them back to Hungary. The films are archived as ‚ÄúThe Miko Collection‚Äù as part of the official historical record of that event. They have been featured on numerous television shows including The Twentieth Century with Walter Cronkite and the History channel‚Äôs Caught on Film and in recently completed documentaries Freedom's Fury and Torn from the Flag. Joseph S. Miko and cinematographer, Laszlo Kovacs, were also close friends after they both emigrated to the U.S. in 1956. Regrettably their friendship became strained over the years after Kovacs tried to claim credit for the footage of the Hungarian revolution shot by Miko. However, the original Agfa stock footage is held in storage by the Miko family and is available for authentication. After the restoration of democracy in Hungary, he was awarded the Hungarian Government‚Äôs Award for Excellence in Achievement and the Hero of Freedom Award as well as the Cross of the Order of Merit.

The New Jersey town of Boonton (Boone Town, Booneton) is named in his honour. Early life Boone was born in England in 1730 or 1731. His father, Charles Boone, was a merchant with interests in the East Indies whose family also included major landowners in the Province of South Carolina, and his mother, Elizabeth Garth Boone, was from a military family from County Durham. The extended family was well connected to the politically powerful Duke of Newcastle. Thomas' older brother Charles served in Parliament for many years, married into the wealthy and powerful Crowley family, and was a friend of Horace Walpole. Educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, Boone came to South Carolina in 1752 to claim title and lands he had inherited from the Boone and Colleton families. He traveled to England in 1754, and returned to South Carolina in 1758, at which time he married Sarah Ann Tattnall Perroneau.  Political career  Possibly through the influence of his brother Charles, Boone was appointed Governor of New Jersey in 1759, but he did not arrive in New Jersey until 10 May 1760. He did not meet with the colonial assembly until 30 October 1760. Six months later, he was appointed Governor of South Carolina. He arrived in Charleston in December 1761, and replaced acting governor William Bull II.\\"Thomas Boone\\" Preservation Society Halsey Map Research Project In 1762, Boone refused to administer the oath of office to a newly elected provincial assemblyman named Christopher Gadsden, stating that his election was not valid. Without taking the oath, Gadsden could not take his seat. When the Assembly objected, Governor Boone dissolved the Assembly and called for new elections.McCrady 357-358 When the Assembly reconvened that winter after elections (in which Gadsden was able to take his seat), they drew up a resolution condemning Governor Boone's actions. The Assembly then produced a resolution stating clearly that the Assembly held sole authority to determine the validity of any elections of its members.McCrady 359 Boone replied that he was acting under his authority as the representative of the British Crown. Ultimately, Boone and the Assembly could not come to an agreement, and the Assembly refused to conduct any business at all with the Governor until their complaints were addressed,McCrady 360 refusing even to pass tax bills or appropriate money to pay the salaries of the various administrative staff.McCrady 363 Finally, Boone gave up. Taking advantage of a previous offer of a leave of absence, he sailed to England and the matter passed.McCrady 365 In May 1764, he left lieutenant governor Bull to fill in as acting governor, and went home to England. He served for many years as commissioner of customs, resigning the post in 1805. His properties in South Carolina were confiscated after the American Revolutionary War. He died at Lee (then part of County Kent) on 25 September 1812.

It was released in 1970 on SSS International Records.  Style  The lyrics of Penitentiary Blues are often dark and foreshadow the content of Coe's later country albums, discussing themes such as working for the first time, blood tests from veins used to inject heroin, prison time, hoodoo imagery and death. AllMusic's Thom Jurek describes the album's style as \\"voodoo blues\\", writing \\"This is redneck music, pure and simple, fresh out of hell and trying to communicate the giddiness of reprieve as well as its horrors to the listener.\\" The album derives influence from Charlie Rich, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bo Diddley, Lightnin' Hopkins, and Tony Joe White.  Reception  Allmusic's Thom Jurek wrote, \\"There are hints and traces of the lyrical genius Coe would display later, but taken as a whole, Penitentiary is thoroughly enjoyable as a rowdy, funky, and crude blues record full of out-of-tune guitars, slippery performances, and an attitude of 'fuck it, let's get it done and get it out,' which was a trademark of Plantation Records during the era.\\" Track listing All Songs written by David Allan Coe except where noted. #\\"Penitentiary Blues\\" ‚Äì 3:11 #\\"Cell #33\\" (Coe, Teddy Paige) ‚Äì 2:13 #\\"Monkey David Wine\\" ‚Äì 3:00 #\\"Walkin' Bum\\" (Hank Mills) ‚Äì 3:36 #\\"One Way Ticket To Nowhere\\" (Coe, Betty Coe, Teddy Paige, Cliff Parker) 2:46 #\\"Funeral Parlor Blues\\" (Coe, Betty Coe, Teddy Paige) ‚Äì 3:12 #\\"Death Row\\" ‚Äì 2:44 #\\"Oh Warden\\" (Coe, Teddy Paige) ‚Äì 2:45 #\\"Age 21\\" ‚Äì 2:06 #\\"Little David\\" ‚Äì 2:12 #\\"Conjer Man\\" ‚Äì 2:09 Personnel *David Allan Coe ‚Äì vocals *Teddy Paige, Jerry Kennedy, Mac Gayden ‚Äì guitar *Teddy Paige, Charlie McCoy, Ed Kollis ‚Äì harmonica *William C.

He was capped once for Wales, in the country's very first international rugby match. Personal history Rees was born in Tonn, Llandovery, Carmarthenshire, Wales. He came from a distinguished family, his great uncle the Rev. Jenkin Rees was a Fellow of Wadham College, Oxford; while an uncle, Professor Rees of Lampeter College was a fellow of Jesus College, Oxford. His father was a published author, who wrote works on the literature of Wales.Watkins (2008), pg 15. He was educated at Sherborne School and then Jesus College, Oxford, but did not win a \\"Blue\\". In 1890 he was admitted as a solicitor, and by 1901 he was appointed clerk to the Merthyr Urban District Council. Four years later he was appointed as Town Clerk. A keen sportsman throughout his life, he was instrumental for the growth of golf in Merthyr, and was a central figure in the establishing of the Morlais Castle Golf Club and Cilsanws Golf Club at Cefn Coed. He died at his residence in Tonn Newydd, Merthyr Tydfil in 1932 and was buried in Cefn Coed Cemetery. Rugby career Although best known for representing Wales in the very first rugby union international, Rees had played matches for the South Wales Football Club, which was the forerunner of the Welsh national team. Formed in September 1875, the S.W.F.C. was formed with the intention of not only playing local teams, but also to play '...the principal clubs in the West of England...'Smith (1980), pg 31. When the S.W.F.C. played Clifton at Cardiff in January 1876, Rees was on the team sheet, showing his willingness to be involved with a larger club that allowed him to face more established opposition. The first Welsh team, Rees is sat in the middle row, far left, February 1881 On 19 February 1881 Rees represented the Wales national rugby union team in the country's very first international rugby match, in a friendly against England. The match was a sporting disaster for the Welsh, with the players having little if any knowledge of playing together, and many of the team placed out of position. The English won by eight goals, scoring 13 tries in total, with Wales unable to score. The game was to be Rees' only cap for Wales, with most of the team replaced for the next Wales international in 1882. He was the first Jesus College alumnus to play for Wales. On 12 March 1881, as a direct result of the actions set in motion by Wales' first rugby international, the Welsh Rugby Union was founded at the Castle Hotel in Neath. By September 1882, its officials were confirmed, and a decision was made to split Wales into two main rugby districts. With Bridgend at its centre, an Eastern and Western district were formed. The East was represented by Alex Duncan of Cardiff and W.R.U. secretary Richard Mullock. While the West was served by Ray Knill of Swansea and Aneurin Rees.Smith (1980), pg 47. As a member of the humiliated first Welsh team, Rees now found himself one of the first four national selectors, and was best served to ensure the farcical events of the 1881 international did not occur again. =International matches played= Wales (rugby union) * 1881  Bibliography  References Category:People educated at Sherborne School Category:Alumni of Jesus College, Oxford Category:Welsh rugby union players Category:Rugby union forwards Category:Wales international rugby union players Category:Wales Rugby Union officials Category:1858 births Category:1932 deaths Category:People from Llandovery ","title":"Aneurin Rees"},{"id":"17449914","text":"Camp Qargha, is a Afghan National Army facility which is home to their Officer Academy.

Grinter is most remembered for an incident in Round 2 of the 1988 VFL season when he punched Footscray defender Terry Wallace in the face, rendering Wallace unconscious. Both field umpires failed to report Grinter for the incident, but he received a six-week suspension for the incident after a VFL investigation. Later that season he appeared in Melbourne's losing Grand Final side against Hawthorn. He was also suspended for nine matches in 1990 following a number of incidents in a game against Richmond at the MCG. Grinter was involved in another famous incident in the previous season's Preliminary Final against the same opponents. He was the man on the mark when Jim Stynes ran between him and Gary Buckenara (he was the one that gave away the free kick to Bukenara) which resulted in a 15-metre penalty and goal to win after the siren from Buckenara. After playing most of his career in defence, Grinter was moved into the forward line in 1993 and rejuvenated his career kicking 21 goals. He managed only 9 games the following year, Grinter stayed on the list as a supplementary player in 1995 serving as reserves captain mentoring the younger players. He was later employed by the Demons as a match day runner. Grinter was coach of New Norfolk in the Tasmanian Statewide Football League during the 1996, 1997 and 1998 seasons.

In 1869 and possibly the surrounding years, Rosenbaum operated a boarding house in Brigham City, Utah Territory, to house railroad workers. He also operated a store. His wife Alice did much of the running of the boarding house and was assisted in this by her sister Rebecca.. From about 1865, Charles W. Nibley had worked as a clerk for Rosenbaum in Rosenbaum's mercantile establishment, and it was as a result of this employment that Nibley met Rosenbaum's sister-in-law Rebecca Neibauer, whom Nibley latter married.. In 1868, Rosenbaum married Abigail H. Snow, a daughter of Lorenzo Snow and Harriet Amelia Squires. They had at least seven children. In 1880, Rosenbaum was a missionary for the LDS Church in (Germany). He was made president of the North German District, and preached Mormonism in Berlin.

It tells the story of three bored people who, after filming and spying on their neighbours, are targeted by a serial killer. Plot Young Tristen Waters, her brother Troy and his friend Ricky go to their father William's holiday home, spending most of their time alone while William works as a policeman to pay off the damage caused by the gambling problem that ended his marriage with Tristan and Troy's mother. While there, the three of them start to spy on their neighbours and soon notice that one of their neighbours is hiring prostitutes who go into the house but never come out. When the man discovers they are filming him, they hide in the flat, only to be found and tied up by the murderer later. William shows up and a fight ensues, causing him to be knocked out. He later awakens and tells the killer \\"I thought I told you to wait till their mother was here\\" before shooting him to death. Frantic, William prepares to kill his children, only to be stabbed to death by his ex-wife. It is then revealed that his ex- wife is the killer of the prostitutes and has been filming the murders after the bodies were supplied to her by the pimp. She finds a text sent to her saying \\"I C U.\\" She notices a camera in the room, one of the many cameras that are planted all over the hotel, and seems to recognise the person operating them. The person operating the cameras is left unknown.

March 14, 1944 in Chicago, Illinois) was one of the foremost American educators at the turn of the 20th century, and one of the first to advocate the involvement of business in education. She wrote a series of textbooks on anthropology and economics which were widely used in the public schools of Wisconsin, Illinois and Utah, as well as nationally circulated studies on the same subjects, and children's books. Early life Born in Portage County, Wisconsin on March 1, 1863 in a log cabin, she was the daughter of William Dopp, one of the first white settlers in what at the time was a wilderness area. She descended from a long line of New York Cityers, scattered also across Connecticut and upstate New York as well as the Midwest, and who displayed a marked taste for education over the generations. There was one Homer Dopp who served for in the Wisconsin State Assembly for one term in 1923 after a teaching career.Members of the Wisconsin State Legislature 1848‚Äì1999 A New England cousin, Raymond Douglas Dopp, was a major name in Connecticut education in the later decades of the 20th century. According to the web site of Dopp family, he was also one of the close aides of General James M. Gavin during the Second World War and was one of the first American officers to access the concentration camp in Buchenwald. Her parents, together with several of her uncles, had left their farms in New England to move to Midwest and to settle on the rich plains in the Indian Territory. She grew up in the area known then as \\"Dopp Neighborhood\\" and attended the one room \\"Dopp School\\" in what is now in the town of Belmont, in Portage County, surrounded by a large family and the experience of her early years in a farm near the wilderness was to mark her for her life.Wayne Allen Guyant (comp.).History and Memories: Portage County, Belmont Township, vol. 1. Waupaca, Wis.: Author, 1984. Teacher and writer She started her career as a teacher in her hometown. An avid reader and a lifelong learner, she became fascinated with the study of anthropology. An unusually enterprising and active woman for her time, she attended several universities in Wisconsin and Illinois and earned several degrees, including Doctorates in Philosophy and Education. She was a public school teacher at first and a university professor later. She taught in universities in Wisconsin, Utah and Illinois. Ultimately, she became the Dean of the Chicago Normal School, a teacher's college that later became part of the University of Illinois at Chicago. While there, she was instrumental in designing and implementing correspondence courses for teachers in the public school systems. Among her works of an academic nature, \\"The Place of Industries in Elementary Education\\" was responded by a particularly large calling and was reviewed by John Dewey.

The most common adverse reactions include abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea. Triheptanoin was approved for medical use in the United States in June 2020. Triheptanoin is a triglyceride that is composed of three seven-carbon (C7:0) fatty acids. These odd-carbon fatty acids are able to provide anaplerotic substrates for the TCA cycle. Triheptanoin is used clinically in humans to treat inherited metabolic diseases, such as pyruvate carboxylase deficiency and carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency. It also appears to increase the efficacy of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy. Since triheptanoin is composed of odd-carbon fatty acids, it can produce ketone bodies with five carbon atoms, as opposed to even-carbon fatty acids which are metabolized to ketone bodies with four carbon atoms. The five-carbon ketones produced from triheptanoin are beta-ketopentanoate and beta-hydroxypentanoate. Each of these ketone bodies easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and enters the brain.  Medical uses  Dojolvi is indicated as a source of calories and fatty acids for the treatment of children and adults with molecularly confirmed long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD).  History  Triheptanoin was designated an orphan drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006, 2008, 2014, and 2015. Triheptanoin was also designated an orphan drug by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Triheptanoin was approved for medical use in the United States in June 2020. The FDA approved triheptanoin based on evidence from three clinical trials (Trial 1/NCT018863, Trial 2/NCT022141 and Trial 3/NCT01379625). The trials enrolled children and adults with LC-FAOD. Trials 1 and 2 were conducted at 11 sites in the United States and the United Kingdom, and Trial 3 was conducted at two sites in the United States. Trial 1 and Trial 2 were used to evaluate the side effects of triheptanoin. Both trials enrolled children and adults diagnosed with LC-FAOD. In Trial 1, participants received triheptanoin for 78 weeks. Trial 2 enrolled participants from other trials who were already treated with triheptanoin (including those from Trial 1) as well as participants who were never treated with triheptanoin before. Trial 2 is still ongoing and is planned to last up to five years. The benefit of triheptanoin was evaluated in Trial 3 which enrolled enrolled children and adults with LC-FAOD. Half of the participants received triheptanoin and half received trioctanoin for four months. Neither the participants nor the investigators knew which treatment was given until the end of the trial. The benefit of triheptanoin in comparison to trioctanoin was assessed by measuring the changes in heart and muscle function.  Names  Triheptanoin is the international nonproprietary name.

Breeding occurs during the summer, and the Puget Sound females carry eggs from November to May. It is not unusual to find harems consisting of one male with as many as seven females. Males may carry females that are molting and continue until their new shell hardens, for mating occurs after females molt.

Over half of the project is complete, and it is planned to be finished by 2024Present, in the project website (Hebrew) with the publishing of thirty more volumes. An English translation, the Encyclopedia Talmudica began to be published in 1969. It is published by the Torah literature publishing group , named after Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog, in Jerusalem. Formation of the encyclopedia The project began at the initiative of Rabbi Meir Bar-Ilan (Berlin) (1880‚Äì1949), the son of the Netziv. The concept was first described in a 1921 lecture by Chief Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, who outlined several projects for Torah scholars, including a work \\"that elucidates the essence of Torah principles, organized by encyclopedic entries.\\" Bar-Ilan organized a group of notable editors. The purpose was to summarize all the Talmudic discussions and all the opinions of Rishonim and Acharonim in encyclopedia articles in alphabetical order. The first edition of the first volume was published in 1947. This volume included 219 articles in an organized format of summaries. The same volume was reprinted three more times: in 1947, 1951, and 1955. After Bar-Ilan died in 1949, it was republished in a newly revised and expanded edition. In 1947 Encyclopedia Talmudit won the city prize of Tel Aviv for Torah literature to honor the memory of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook.◊î◊§◊®◊ì◊°, ◊™◊©◊®◊ô ◊™◊©\\"◊ó, ◊¢◊û◊ï◊ì 9 Major Torah scholars, both Hasidim and Mitnagdim, supported the project. Supporters included Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv, Rabbi Yochanan Sofer, and others.Encyclopedia Talmudit, vol 16, introduction The administrator of the encyclopedia from its founding was Rabbi (1910‚Äì2009), who succeeded in securing the initiative with stable financial backing, thanks to his connections with leaders of the Mizrachi movement. Editors Editors The first editor-in-chief was Rabbi Shlomo Yosef Zevin (1886‚Äì1978). The first editors were Rabbi Benjamin Rabinovitz-Teomim, Rabbi Shimon Stralitz, Rabbi Yonah Martzebach and Rabbi Alter Hilevitz. In later years tens of Torah scholars joined the editorial board, among them Rabbi Eliezer Waldenberg, the author of Tzitz Eliezer; Rabbi Isaac Epstein, the judge in the Tel Aviv Beit Din; Rabbi Yehuda Gershoni; Rabbi Shmuel Kroyzer; Rabbi Refael Shmulevitz, the Rosh Yeshiva of the Mir yeshiva (Jerusalem); Rabbi Azriel Levi, the chief editor of the Oz VeHadar version of the Talmud; and others. The current editor-in-chief is Rabbi Zalman Nehemiah Goldberg. In late 2006 Professor Avraham Steinberg took on the role of administrative director. Contents Rabbi Zevin's style was to abbreviate and summarize wherever possible. In the first two volumes he followed an extremely brief format under the influence of Rabbi Bar-Ilan, but in later volumes published after Rabbi Bar-Ilan died the volumes are more encompassing, and include not only the essence of the article but also many of its details and branched topics. Rabbi Zevin established the listing of primary and secondary articles and the system of halakhic analysis of the encyclopedia. He edited the volumes that were published during his lifetime, and prepared other volumes until the end of letter Heth (◊ó). The articles are organized in the following order: definition, sources, reasons and derivations, and various opinions. The first article was Aleph (◊ê) and the last to date has been Kitvei ha-Qodesh (◊õ). The extent of development in the articles has expanded over time. There are two volumes of indexes, including an index of topics and of citations from the Babylonian Talmud. Other editions Encyclopedia Talmudit is also published on a computer version on a compact disc as part of the searchable Bar Ilan Responsa Project. (See Torah database.)

The Victoria Hotel, or The Vic as it is commonly known, is a heritage listed pub located in Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia. Built in 1890, it is an important historical building but is currently closed.  History  'Hotel Victoria, Palmerston, Northern Territory' The Victoria Hotel was built by Ellen Ryan, one of the Territory's wealthiest women, who owned land and several mining leases. In 1888 Ryan moved into the Territory hotel trade, lodging a successful application with the licensing board for a prestigious hotel to be built at 27 Smith Street in central Darwin, then known as Palmerston, during the northern Australia gold rushes of the 1870s onwards.Vic Hotel (2007) Victoria Hotel History. Retrieved on 4 Oct 2011. Constructed by H.C. Debross, it was built for ¬£4,000 and was the first stone building in Darwin. The two-storey hotel was made of local, multi-coloured porcellanite stone, with a facade dominated by a parapetted gable and verandahs.Welke, A.C. and Wilson, H.J. (1993). Darwin Central Area Heritage Study. Report for the Conservation Commission of the NT, Darwin. Upon completion, the building dominated Smith Street and remained that way for over half a century.Turnbull, Kay (1985). The Victoria Hotel, Smith Street Mall, Darwin. Copy (unpublished) held by Charles Darwin University, Special Collection. The hotel opened on 8 September 1890. It was first called The Royal Hotel but was renamed the North Australian Hotel a few days after opening. It was renamed the Victoria Hotel in 1896. = 1897 cyclone = Victoria Hotel after cyclone damage in 1897 The Victoria Hotel lost part of its roof and was damaged internally during a cyclone on 6 January 1897. Known as the \\"Great Hurricane\\", it killed 28 people, sank 19 vessels in the harbour including the entire pearling fleet, and caused around ¬£150,000 damage throughout the town. Structurally however, the hotel was one of only a few buildings that remained intact and it was repaired shortly afterwards.Murphy, Kevin (1984). Big blow up north: A history of tropical cyclones in Australia's Northern Territory. NT University Planning Authority. . = Early 20th century = In 1908, the hotel accommodated Henry Dutton and Murray Aunger, the first motorists to cross the Australian continent from Adelaide to Darwin. In 1915, the hotel was one of several to be nationalised by Northern Territory Administrator, John Gilruth. Known as the government take-over, the hotel was the focal point for political turmoil and union unrest between 1911 and 1919, which came to a head on 17 December 1918 in what was known as the Darwin Rebellion.Alcorta, Frank (1984). Darwin Rebellion: 1911 - 1919. NT University Planning Authority. . . Ross and Keith Smith and other aviators connected with the air race from England to Australia stayed at the hotel in December 1919. Mining entrepreneur May Brown became the first publican win the lease on Darwin's Victoria Hotel in 1921 when the era of state control of Top End hotels came to an end. Christina Gordon took over the hotel in August 1926. Gordon upgraded the Vic Hotel including the refurbishment of a new dining room. She continued the connection with aviators. Many of their signatures from the 1920s and 1930s remain on a masonry section in the hotel which has been preserved. The well-known Government architect Beni Burnett, who had a very significant influence on Darwin architecture from the late 1930s, stayed at the hotel for several years. = 1937 cyclone = The hotel lost its roof for the second time in March 1937, during another cyclone. Although not as formidable as the 1897 cyclone, it still caused considerable damage to the town and killed one person. The hotel was quickly repaired. = World War II = Inspecting the damage following the soldiers riot of September 1941. During World War II the hotel was occupied by United States and Australian naval authorities who remained there until the end of the war. In September 1941, rioting soldiers in the Darwin city area caused superficial damage to the hotel, such as broken windows and furniture.James, Barbara (2007) NT Library Services. Historical Introduction to Northern Territory Newspapers. Retrieved on 14 May 2008. With many troops stationed in Darwin, a fight broke out in the hotel that quickly spread outside into Smith Street. Although the damage was blamed on the soldiers, records show that civilians were involved in the riot.Fong-Lim, Alec (1990). State Reference Library of the NT. Memories of pre-war Northern Territory Towns. Pages 12 & 13\\\\. Retrieved on 14 May 2008. On 19 February 1942, Darwin was bombed by Japanese air raids, the largest attacks mounted by a foreign power against Australia. It was the same fleet that had bombed Pearl Harbor, though a considerably larger number of bombs were dropped on Darwin than on Pearl Harbor. The attack killed at least 243 people and caused immense damage to the town. They were the first of many raids on Darwin.Lockwood, Douglas (1992). Australia's Pearl Harbour: Darwin 1942. Melbourne: Penguin Books. Despite this extensive destruction to the town, the Victoria Hotel survived with little damage. Ironically, just as much damaged was caused to the hotel by the September 1941 soldiers riot, as the Japanese bombing raids. In September 1946, the pub reopened under the ownership of the Lim family, who bought the hotel from the Gordons. The Lims operated the hotel for nearly 20 years, selling it in 1965. During this period, the hotel was a popular 'watering hole' frequently attended by crocodile shooters, buffalo hunters and mining prospectors, as well as the local office workers and bank staff. = Cyclone Tracy = The Hotel Victoria after Cyclone Tracy. On Christmas Day 1974 the hotel survived yet another cyclone, when Cyclone Tracy hit Darwin killing 71 people and damaging 95 per cent of buildings at an estimated cost of over A$800 million.Sydney Morning Herald (2004). Darwin: A classic tropical sea port and the capital of the Northern Territory. Retrieved on 15 May 2008. The hotel was significantly damaged but survived structurally, losing its roof for the third time in less than a century. The cyclone left Darwin nearly uninhabitable, so the Vic Hotel was not reconstructed until 1978. Some original stonework was repaired at this time, particularly in relation to the Smith Street gabled parapet. Other stonework repairs were minimal as it was still in generally good condition, despite the severity of Cyclone Tracy. The hotel has had several refurbishments since Cyclone Tracy. The hotel facade was registered on the \\"National Estate\\" as a Historic site in 1999 for its historic associations with important events and individuals for more than a century.  Present day  The Vic Hotel closed in October 2014. It was reported to be more than $750,000 in debt. The hotel's co-owner Andrew Chigwidden said that the hotel \\"struggled to get market share due to its geographical position... a lack of a suitable downstairs smoking area has also had a massive negative commercial impact on the viability (and) the social ambience of the hotel.\\"  References  Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1890 Category:History of the Northern Territory Category:Tourist attractions in Darwin, Northern Territory Category:Buildings and structures in Darwin, Northern Territory Category:Hotels in the Northern Territory Category:Heritage hotels in Australia Category:Pubs in the Northern Territory Category:Economy of Darwin, Northern Territory ","title":"Victoria Hotel, Darwin"},{"id":"17450640","text":"State Route 429 (SR 429) was a rural state highway located in southern Washoe County, Nevada.

Route description SR 429 began at Hobart Road, near the Carson City - Washoe County line immediately adjacent to present-day Interstate 580 (I-580) and US 395. From this point, the SR 429 paralleled US 395 northward for about and then shifted westward to follow the foothills of the mountains to the west. The highway continued northward past Bowers Mansion State Park before turning east to terminate at US 395 just south of Washoe City. Occasionally, strong crosswinds are experienced on mainline US 395 through the Washoe Valley. When large- profile vehicles were prohibited on US 395 due to high wind, motorists were advised to detour onto SR 429. A slip ramp to US 395 at the highway's southern terminus facilitated this detour in the southbound direction. History SR 429 was the original US 395 highway alignment connecting Carson City to Reno. By 1970, a new divided highway alignment was opened to traffic between the Carson City limits and the northern terminus of present-day SR 429. US 395 was switched to this new alignment, and present-day SR 429 remained in the state system with an unknown highway number.

Buddhism was introduced in the country for the first time by Chinese immigrants during the early 19th and 20th century, but an important part of these migrants later became --at least nominally-- Roman Catholics due to the then very Conservative Catholic-lead society. But there is registry that some of them kept their Buddhist believes practicing discreetly, for example, the testimony of writer Jorge Cardona of Buddhist altars among Chinese merchants in the early 20 century Puntarenas. Another source of Buddhism in the country was the Theosophical Society, popular among important members of the economic and intellectual elite. Among the poets and theosophists that wrote Buddhist-influenced poetry are Roberto Brenes Mes√©n and Jos√© Basileo Acu√±a Zeled√≥n. However one of the first Buddhist temples made in the country was the Casa Zen (Zen House) of Costa Rica created in 1974 with support of the Japanese government, followed by the first Dharma Center of Tibetan Buddhism of the Gelug tradition founded in 1989 after the Dalai Lama's first visit to the country. Nowadays, it is also driven by the very minor presence of Buddhist missionary groups, such as Soka Gakkai International., which has establish a community center at San Jose. In recent years there has been a tendency for growing dissatisfaction with Catholicism, the dominant religion. Some convert to other branches of Christianity, most notably Protestantism (with a growing number of Protestant churches throughout Costa Rica). But others stay as agnostics, atheists or \\"free thinkers\\". It is these latter groups, especially if already interested or practicing some form of meditation, that can become influenced or inspired by \\"exotic religions\\" (in Costa Rica) such as Buddhism and therefore convert to it, or adopt it as a philosophy.

The best known and first group is the \\"Asociaci√≥n Cultural Tibetano-Costarricense\\"tibet in costa rica (official website, in spanish) (Tibetan-Costarrican Cultural Association), which was established in 1989 CE after the first visit of the XIV Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso in Latin America.

Fenway Park's address was 4 Yawkey Way. The original address was 24 Jersey Street. After the 2018 name change, the park's address is now 4 Jersey Street. Renaming In December 2015, The Boston Globe columnist Adrian Walker proposed renaming Yawkey Way and Yawkey station, citing Tom Yawkey's history with baseball's color line. On August 17, 2017, amid heightened media coverage of the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials in the United States, Red Sox owner John Henry said the team would lead a campaign to change the street name because the team was the last in Major League Baseball to integrate. Henry said, \\"I am still haunted by what went on here a long time before we arrived.\\" In February 2018, it was announced that the Red Sox filed a petition with the city of Boston to restore Yawkey Way to its original name, Jersey Street. The change was opposed by the Yawkey Foundation, a charitable group funded by Yawkey's estate. The Boston Public Improvement Commission heard public input on the proposal at its meeting on March 15, from supporters and opponents. The Commission could have voted on the change on March 29; however, after hearing additional input that day, the vote was delayed until April 12. On April 12, a decision was further postponed until April 26. On April 26, the Boston Public Improvement Commission unanimously approved the name change back to Jersey Street. The change from Yawkey Way to Jersey Street was made official on May 3, 2018. Related items On June 22, 2017, the neighboring Yawkey Way Extension was renamed David Ortiz Drive in honor of recently retired Red Sox all-star David Ortiz. The honor came a day before Ortiz's number was retired by the team. In light of his request to change the name of Yawkey Way, some Massachusetts lawmakers have suggested that Henry remove Mr. and Mrs. Yawkey's initials written in morse code from the scoreboard on the left field wall. Newton Democrat Ruth Balser, co-sponsor of a bill to study the renaming of nearby Yawkey station, said, \\"I would hope that the Red Sox organization would consider that, as they consider supporting a change to the street.\\" In an August 2017 email, Red Sox spokesperson Zineb Curran wrote about removing the initials, \\"Our current efforts are focused on petitioning the city to change the street name.\\" In April 2018, when reverting the Yawkey Way name to Jersey Street was approved, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) stated that it will also rename the nearby Yawkey station. On March 28, 2019, the MBTA announced that the station would be renamed Lansdowne station (after nearby Lansdowne Street, which runs along the back of the Green Monster on the opposite side of Fenway Park from Jersey Street) effective April 8. It has been noted that Jersey Street, named in the late 1850s, is a reference to the sixth Earl of Jersey, George Augustus Frederick Child Villiers, who profited from the British slave trade.

The two were working on signal processing techniques for anti-submarine warfare. When Loral chose to pursue other technology, Newman and Gross founded DRS to continue their research, which ultimately led to development of the AN/SQR-17 passive submarine detection system, a product still used today. DRS went public in 1981 and acquired its first company in 1984. By 1994, DRS set a goal to become a mid- tier defense contractor, defined by $500M in sales - notwithstanding that DRS at the time had only $58M in sales.

Its primary function is to imitate smelt. The streamer's wing gives it a swimming action while trolling or using the Dead Drift technique. The pattern is widespread and is popular along the Northeast of the United States. Many variations of the streamer occur, mostly to cut down on cost and tying time. Origin The streamer was first tied in 1924 by commercial fly tyer Carrie G. Stevens of Madison, Maine. She was the wife of Maine fishing guide, Wallace Stevens. She tied many other flies in a style known as the Rangeley style during her free time. Most of her streamers have the jungle cock cheeks in common. The streamer is regarded as one of her best creations. The pattern is mostly used for trout, of which it is successfully fished. When Stevens tested it at the Upper Dam pool she quickly hooked a 6 pound 13 ounce brook trout, which secured her second prize a Field & Stream competition. Afterwards she became even more involved with fly tying.

The Government of Hong Kong created the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO). Since the Handover, the Hong Kong government has been promoting what it bills as \\"e-government\\".

The GLD is the responsibility of the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, whereas the OGCIO is under the Financial Secretary. History The Government Logistics Department (GLD) was established through a merger of three existing government departments. The Store Department was founded in 1938, and was renamed the Government Supplies Department in 1969. The former Printing Department was established in 1952. The Government Land Transport Agency was established in 1978 as part of the Finance Branch, and became a department in 1979. The GLD was established on 1 July 2003, combining the three departments.

The spit is home to Semiahmoo Park Geomorphology and geography It is oriented toward the northeast, which means the direction of longshore drift, a constructive geomorphologic process, is northeasterly. Longshore drift through the Strait of Georgia, therefore, tends to be northeasterly. Because waves are mainly powered by wind, the waves approaching Semiahmoo hit the shore obliquely, at an angle of approximately 30 to 45 degrees to the northeast, and thus the prevailing wind through the Strait of Georgia must also be northeasterly. Because of longshore drift, sediments are picked up from the headland and deposited according to size and based on wave energy. High energy wave action can carry large sediment, such as cobbles and gravel, but only as long as the energy exists. Since the waves repeatedly hit the shore, energy is lost, and so larger, denser sediments are quickly deposited near the headland. Smaller, less dense sediment, such as gravel, sand, mud, and clay, can be carried and deposited farther away from the headland because they do not require as much energy for transport. One mile to the north of the tip of the spit is the border between the United States and Canada. Approximately four miles to the northeast of the tip of the spit is the city of White Rock, British Columbia. The spit is approximately long and contains approximately of land. History Semiahmoo cannery office, August 1918 \\"Native quarters\\", Semiahmoo cannery Semiahmoo cannery workers at a filling machine, August 1918 In 1858, prospectors came to the Semiahmoo area searching for the Fraser River. The spit seemed like a logical place to set up a post as a launching point for further exploration into the mainland. A trading post was soon established at the spit, and the owner drew up plans for Semiahmoo City. Semiahmoo was expected to become a migration boomtown, but it eventually developed into a fishing town, as the spit provided shelter for Drayton Harbor and an abundance of coastal resources. Whatcom County's first salmon cannery opened in 1881 in Semiahmoo; in 1891, the Alaska Packers Association was the largest salmon cannery in the world. Salmon canning was to be the main source of revenue in Semiahmoo until 1980, when the land was purchased by the land development corporation. Recently, a park with a small, seasonal interpretive center was built near the headland, and the Semiahmoo Resort and Golf Course was built near the spit. Use of the spit by the Lummi Indian Nation, and current archaeological investigation Because of its location, the spit provides access to countless resources that thrive in both the calm waters of Drayton Harbor, and the ocean currents through the Strait of Georgia. Historically, the Lummi Indian Nation used the spit for its natural resources; a major village was built on the spit. Today, shell midden is clearly visible in many places, on either side of the spit, as wave action has cut away at the shore, revealing historic artifacts.

It is now defunct, with assets frozen by the Singapore Court. The company is listed by the Singapore Government's Monetary Authority in its Investor's Alert List, for possibly running investment schemes without authority. After investigation by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) of the Singapore Police and a court trial, Sunshine Empire's Directors were charged with and found guilty of fraud, criminal breach of trust and falsifying accounts. The company had gathered up to S$189 million in funds through investment schemes, alleged to have never materialised and to have been in fact, part of a Ponzi scheme. Initial trial revealed that over S$115m were paid out as 'investment returns', while another S$40m were transferred to associates as 'interest free loans' and the remaining believed to have been expended or paid out to directors as fees. History Prior to the existence of Sunshine Empire, its founders had had a long history of establishing similar investment schemes under various business names, with none ever having been materialized. The projects were claimed to have failed, and investors would have been unable to recoup anything after the fund collection was completed. However, its founders had evaded legal charges by operating on legal loopholes in their contracts. Management It was reported that there was also a group of middle-aged people who were trained separately from the majority and who drove luxury sedans like Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs despite being only in their early twenties. These \\"car achievers\\" were also known as managers who always dressed smartly in black suits and carried Montblanc pens and wallets. According to a former member of Sunshine Empire, these managers would take other members out for supper after the training sessions because they said it would foster bonding and that it was an opportunity for other members to see the cars they drove. Closure = Events leading to investigations = The fact that Sunshine Empire's merchants could notch up what seemed like profits without ever buying or selling products meant that its business model resembled a pure financial investment scheme or Ponzi scheme. There have been allegations that the Sunshine Empire was a Pyramid scheme, with victims in East Asian Countries. Sunshine Empire was placed on the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) investor alert list and Malaysia's Securities Commission alert list.Straits Times - Clients of MLM firm Sunshine Empire cry foul On 8 October 2008, the Consumers Association of Singapore's executive director, Seah Seng Choon, cautioned participants against transferring their money to Hong Kong, as it would put their investment outside Singapore's jurisdiction.Asiaone Business - Undergrad may have lost $66,000 to Company On 24 October 2008, it was reported that James Phang Wah did not own Sunshine Empire but was just a charismatic adviser to Sunshine. = Investigation and charges = On 3 February 2009, investigation by the CAD was concluded after one year, two months and three weeks. It was found that Sunshine Empire had generated a revenue of $189 million in just over a year. Jackie Hoo Choon Cheat, a director of Sunshine Empire, and James Phang Wah each faced a charge of fraudulent trading under Section 340 of the Companies Act; a charge of failure to maintain proper accounting records of S unshine Empire under Section 199 of the Companies Act; and eight charges of criminal breach of trust as an agent of Sunshine Empire under Section 409 of the Penal Code. Phang also faced six charges of falsification of Sunshine Empire's accounts under Section 477A of the Penal Code and one charge of false declaration of the share capital of Empire Communications Technology Pte Ltd under Section 401 (2A) (b) of the Companies Act. In addition to the Penal Code and Companies Act charges, Phang faced three charges of possession of uncensored and obscene films under the Films Act. He was the shadow director of the ponzi scam empire which had reportedly victimized more than 20,000 Singaporeans (mostly teenagers) and rewarded top scammers with luxury cars. Neo Kuon Huay, a director of Empire Emall (S) Pte Ltd and wife of Phang, faced six charges of falsification of Sunshine Empire's accounts under Section 477A of the Penal Code and one charge of false declaration of the share capital of Empire Emall (S) Pte Ltd under Section 401 (2A) (b) of the Companies Act. Mr. Yong Wai Hong, director of Empire Communications Technology Pte Ltd, Bingo Group Holding and various companies, faced six charges of false declaration of the share capital of various companies under Section 401 (2A) (b) of the Companies Act.

He was one of Portland, Oregon's earliest residents, and served as that city's mayor in two non-consecutive periods, two-and-a-half years (two 15-month terms) starting in 1864 and later a two-year term starting in 1873. He was a Republican.  Early life  Henry Failing was born in New York City on January 17, 1834, to Josiah Failing and Henrietta (Ellison) Failing, one of eleven children.Lockley, Fred. \\"History of the Columbia River Valley, From The Dalles to the Sea.\\" Vol. 2. Chicago, S. J. Clarke Publishing Co., 1928. p. 18. His ancestors were considered, by one biographer, \\"substantial citizens of the east.\\" He was educated in New York's public schools until the age of 12. He began his business career in a French importing and shipping house, where he learned the French language and business accounting. He then became the junior bookkeeper for Eno, Mahoney & Co., one of the largest wholesale dry goods houses in the city, a few years later. He was also in charge of their foreign business. In April 1851 he accompanied his father and younger brother John in a move to Portland. Mr. Eno, Failing's former boss, would later describe the loss of Henry Failing as a business contact as a mistake.  Family business in Oregon  Henry Failing left New York on April 15, 1851, with his father and younger brother. They traveled via steamer to the Chagres River in Panama, by boat up the river, across Panama by mule train, and then to San Francisco aboard the Tennessee. The final leg of their journey, aboard the Columbia, took them to Portland on June 9. Henry befriended C. H. Lewis, later a business associate, on the last leg of the journey. At the time, Portland was merely a hamlet, with fewer than 500 residents. He and his father established a general merchandising business, J. Failing & Co., on Front Street (now Naito Parkway), one door south of Oak Street. The business grew rapidly in its first few years. In 1853, Josiah was elected as Portland's fourth mayor, serving until 1854.List of mayors of Portland, Oregon, Portland Auditor's Office. Retrieved 2008-04-06. Henry also became majority owner in the family business in that year. Josiah retired in 1864, and Henry narrowed the business's focus to hardware and iron supplies in 1868. He would remain associated with the business until January 1893. On October 21, 1858, Failing married Emily Phelps Corbett, sister of U.S. Senator-to-be Henry W. Corbett, who was a neighbor of the Failing family business. Emily died of tuberculosis on July 8, 1870, leaving three daughters.  Portland politician  Failing was elected to the first of his three terms as mayor of Portland in 1864. It was said he hadn't aspired to political office, but that the people of Portland admired his apparent immunity to typical partisan politics. Failing was concerned that Portland's roads were \\"a reproach to the city and its inhabitants;\\" one of his first actions as mayor was to pass a city charter amendment, which required property owners to pay for the grading and paving of streets adjacent to their property. He then passed measures and ordinances improving the government efficiency, many of which have lasted into the 21st century. His first term accomplishments included forecasting budget revenues, codifying city ordinances, financing gas street lamps, funding the removal of snags from the Willamette River, and sewer planning. Failing was elected to a second 15-month term in June 1865, with only five votes cast against him out of 790, making it the nearest-unanimous mayoral election in Portland history (). Though popular, Failing resigned in November 1866; no reason for his resignation was recorded. Failing was later elected to a third term as mayor in 1873, on the Citizens Ticket. It was a narrow victory this time; the margin was 40 votes out of 2,036. On August 2, a month after he took office, 22 blocks along Portland's waterfront, near SW Alder Street, burned in the largest fire in Portland history. Failing was criticized for his response to the fire, but public opposition to several of his ordinances was considered the reason for his loss to J. A. Chapman in his final campaign for mayor in 1875. After retiring from professional politics, Failing was appointed to Portland's water committee in 1886, and later served as its chairman. The committee purchased and enlarged the old water works, and developed plans for a new system of water supply.  Expanded career in banking and business  Failing's home, at the lower left in this circa 1914 photo, was located in what is now the center of downtown Portland. At the time of the house's construction (1876), the city's business center was located farther east. Following his second term as mayor, Failing returned his attention to business. The First National Bank was the first bank established in Oregon (1866) under the National Banking Act, and for a number of years the only one west of the Rocky Mountains. Failing and Henry Corbett purchased nearly all its stock in 1869, and Failing became the bank's president, retaining that title until his death. The bank prospered under their joint management, becoming one of the most successful banks in the northwestern United States. Failing maintained an interest in other business enterprises, and held valuable real estate both in and on the outskirts of Portland. In 1871 Henry W. Corbett and Henry Failing amalgamated their hardware and machinery businesses as Corbett, Failing & Co.,In addition to Corbett and Failing, the partners from Oregon were Marshall Millard and Henry's younger brother Edward Failing, who came into the partnership from H.W. Corbett & Co., where they were one-sixth partners. James F. Failing came into the new company from Henry Failing's business. and two of Failing's younger brothers (Edward Failing, a partner in H.W. Corbett & Co., and James from the Failing business side) also became partners in the new business at the same time.Corbett and Henry Failing merely remained investors, involved only in the direction of their amalgamated businesses, owing to their other business and banking responsibilities, as well as Corbett's US Senate responsibilities, and largely left the running of it to the other partners. The new partnership divisions were \\"Henry W. Corbett and Henry Failing four twentieths each. And John Hatt, Marshall Millard, Edward Failing and James Failing three twentieths each. Articles of Copartnership made and entered into by and between Henry W. Corbett, Henry Failing, Marshall Milliard, Edward Failing and James J. Failing. Feb/March 1871 (HWC archives, OHS Mss 1110). The new business Corbett, Failing & Co. turned exclusively to wholesale merchandizing, and became the largest of its kind in the northwest. In the 1880s, Failing was among the key early investors in Henry Villard's Portland Hotel. Failing was elected a director of Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (ORNC) in June 1888, along with Corbett, Henry Villard, Christopher Meyer, John Hubert Hall, Sidney Dillon, Charles S. Colby, Colgate Hoyt, C. H. Lewis, W. S. Ladd, Cyrus A. Dolph, William H. Holcomb, and S. B. Wiley. Contemporary elections for the Oregon and Transcontinental and the Northern Pacific Terminal Companyhttps://www.up.com/customers/shortline/profiles_l-p/ptr/index.htm installed many of the same men on the boards of those companies as well (the latter company was to build Portland Union Station). The elections were understood to signal no change at ORNC, underscoring their intent to extend the Farmington Line to the Coeur D'Alene Mines, and were viewed as a defeat of Villard and his initiative to jointly lease property of the Northern Pacific and the Union Pacific.  Later life and legacy  Both houses of the Oregon Legislative Assembly endorsed Failing to succeed William Windom as the United States Secretary of the Treasury in 1891.Journal of the House of the Legislative Assembly of the State of Oregon for the Sixteenth Regular Session, 1891. Frank C. Baker, p. 391. President Benjamin Harrison, however, appointed Charles Foster, a former Governor of Ohio, to the post. Failing served as a regent of the University of Oregon, a trustee and treasurer of Pacific University, president (and benefactor) of the Portland Library Association, treasurer of the Portland Children's Home, and a founder of River View Cemetery. Henry Failing died on November 8, 1898. Failing Street in Northeast Portland carries the family's name.

The Producer's Business Handbook by John J. Lee Jr, Chapter 6, (Focal Press, 2000) The producer will agree to deliver a film (based on an agreed script/cast/budget) to a distributor in respect of certain territories in consideration (inter alia) for payment of a \\"minimum distribution guarantee\\" payable at the point in time when the producer has delivered the completed film. The producer obviously requires such funds upfront to finance the film so the producer takes the signed distribution contract to a bank/financier and will effectively use it as collateral against a production loan. It is at this stage that the bank will require a completion bond to be executed to provide them with the required level of security against the risk of non-delivery by the producer. The parties to the completion bond agreement are typically the producer, the financier(s), the completion guarantor company and the distributor(s). These methods of funding can be complicated and expensive due to legal, bank fees and interest. The bond fee itself is negotiable‚Äîtypically 3‚Äì5% depending on the risks as assessed by the completion guarantor. For these reasons, completion bonds are typically used on mid- to high-budget independent films. Key to the completion guarantor company's risk assessment process will be a careful scrutiny of key persons on the production team to determine whether the film is \\"bondable\\". Of particular interest will be the director, first assistant director, line producer, production manager, producer, cast and cinematographer, since these personnel will ultimately be responsible for keeping the production on budget and on schedule. The completion guarantor will require a regular (usually daily) flow of production paperwork‚Äîfor example, production reports, cashflow and cost reports etc. Under the bond agreement, the completion guarantor has the contractual right to \\"take over the film\\" (which will include wide \\"hire and fire\\" rights over any personnel including the director) since they are financially liable if the film goes over budget. In extreme circumstances, films are sometimes finished by the completion guarantor company (this infamously occurred during production of The Thief and the Cobbler)‚Äîan event that is traumatic for the crew and cast, and can be disastrous for a film's creative and commercial ambitions. However completion guarantors also know that it is usually in their interests to work with an established production team to assist them to bring a production back onto schedule and within the agreed budget.

History  Korean people have eaten yellow croakers for a very long time, as Shuowen Jiezi, an early 2nd-century Chinese dictionary, reports that yellow croakers were caught in Lelang, and that a Han commandery existed within the Korean peninsula.  Preparation  Fresh yellow croakers, with lustrous scales and a chubby belly, caught in May to June. are preferred. Croakers are washed and drained on sokuri (bamboo tray), then stuffed with coarse salt, and laid on a salt-lined onggi (earthenware jar). One layer of fish is followed by one layer of salt, and so on. When the jar is around 70% filled, split and sterilized bamboo stalks are laid over the croakers, followed by boiled and cooled brine (mixture of 2/3 water and 1/3 salt). In total, the salt used should weigh around 15‚Äí20% of the fish. The jeotgal is left to ferment at for two to three months and up to a year.

He became vice president after winning the 2009 presidential election together with the then-incumbent President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. Education Boediono received his early education in primary school in Blitar, East Java. In the early 1960s he began university studies at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta before winning a scholarship to study at the University of Western Australia in Perth. In 1967 he graduated from the University of Western Australia with an economics degree and continued his studies for a master's degree in economics at Monash University in Melbourne which he completed in 1972. Later, he undertook further studies towards his doctorate degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania which he completed in 1979. He also worked in the Indonesia Project at the Australian National University in the early 1970s as a research assistant in economics..

Hines' mission was to prepare the groundwork of Morgan's Raid across the Ohio River into Indiana and Ohio by seeing what support the local Knights of the Golden Circle and Copperheads would provide for the main operation. Mission The mission began in Woodbury, Tennessee, on June 10, 1863, where Morgan had a picket camp. At the start of the mission, Hines only told his men that their mission would be \\"long and dangerous\\" and allowed any man who did not wish to go to step out; none did. From there, they traveled through Brownsville, Kentucky, and Elizabethtown, Kentucky. At Brownsville, they stole clothing from a Union sutler, consisting of shirts, trousers, and boots of Union uniforms. At Elizabethtown, the group robbed a train, providing Hines' force with Union currency. When they reached the Ohio River, Hines' then informed his men that they would pose as Union troops under General Jeremiah T. Boyle with orders to pursue deserters, called the Indiana Grays. The crossing occurred between Alton, Indiana, and Tobinsport, Indiana, on June 18, 1863, presumably near Derby, Indiana.Horan, James. Confederate Agent: a Discovery in History (Crown Publishers, 1954, 3rd Printing 1960) pp.24,25 Once he crossed the Ohio River, Hines' men rode straight to Paoli, Indiana, successfully posing as Union soldiers. While being served dinner in Paoli, actual Indiana Home Guards entered the town, and informed the mayor of the deception. The Confederates escaped by convincing a separate band of Home Guards that they were surrounded, taking the best horses the actual Union troops had, and saying the captured Union band was paroled. They then went to French Lick, Indiana where Hines met the local Copperhead leader Doctor William A. Bowles, whose home was a gathering place for the Democratic Party. Bowles told Hines he could raise a force of 10,000, but before the deal was finalized, Hines was told a Union force was approaching, causing him to flee. As a result, there would be no support for Morgan's Raid by them.Horan pp.25-27 From French Lick, Hines' men traveled to Valeene, Indiana. At Valeene, while still posing as Union troops, they set a house on fire whose occupants refused to give them dinner. This exposed that Hines' men were actually Confederates to the local populace. A resistance was quickly formed at Paoli. Hines had hired a local man, Bryant Breeden, to guide them to safety, but Breeden was strongly pro-Union, and instead guided the Confederates onto the Little Blue Island, a small island in the middle of the Ohio River near Leavenworth, Indiana. On this island, a skirmish began, killing three Confederate soldiers. Hines escaped across the Ohio River with a few of his men, and the rest of the Confederate force surrendered, having successfully covered Hines' escape. The Corydon Weekly Democrat said of the Home Guards \\"Our citizens, though unused to actual war, showed the nerve of soldiers\\".Terrell, William Indiana in the War of Rebellion (Indiana Historical Society, 1960). p.205Wissing, Douglas. Traveling the Ohio River Scenic Route (Guild Press of Indiana, 1998) p.59Horan pp.27,28 Aftermath Thomas Hines traveled throughout Kentucky by railroad until it was time to rejoin Morgan, which he did at Brandenburg, Kentucky, being put immediately in command of Morgan's artillery. Hines had to inform Morgan that they would receive no help from Hoosier Confederate sympathizers, which many believe made Morgan decide to deal more harshly with any Hoosier citizen who would later claim to be sympathetic to the Confederate cause. In Morgan's subsequent raid, on July 9, 1863 after capturing Corydon he exacted tribute from the citizens, in part because of the treatment of Hines earlier that year. Lew Wallace would say that it was his actions that discouraged any Hoosiers from helping Hines and Morgan.Wallace, Lew. Smoke, Sound, & Fury: The Civil War Memoirs of Major General Lew Wallace, U.S. Volunteers. (Strawberry Hill Press, 1998) pg.184 Hines' immediate superior and Morgan's second in command, Basil W. Duke, had not been informed of Hines' mission previously. When Hines finally saw what he saw as his prodigal son, Duke remarked how Hines was resting next to a wharfboat \\"apparently the most listless inoffensive youth that was ever imposed upon\\".Johnson, Polk. A History of Kentucky and Kentuckians (Lewis Publishing, 1912) p.360 Most of the area Thomas Hines traveled in this raid is within present-day Hoosier National Forest. Notes References *Crenshaw, C.

Orlofsky's nomination to the Third Circuit expired at the end of Clinton's presidency, and President Bush chose not to renominate him. In March 2003, President George W. Bush nominated Michael Chertoff to the Third Circuit seat to which Orlofsky had been nominated. Chertoff was confirmed by the Senate later that year. Resignation and Post-Judge Career On February 19, 2003, Orlofsky announced that he was resigning from the bench to return to private practice at his former firm, Blank Rome LLP. His resignation took effect on August 31, 2003. In an article that appeared in the Cherry Hill Courier-Post on February 20, 2003, Orlofsky told the paper that he wasn't bitter about being denied a spot on the Third Circuit. \\"I'm leaving for new professional challenges,\\" he told the Courier- Post. \\"I love the interactions of lawyers, of witnesses and jurors.

Minkus is noted for the music he composed while serving as the official Composer of Ballet Music to the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres in Russia. During his long career, he wrote for the original works and numerous revivals staged by the renowned Ballet Masters Arthur Saint-L√©on and Marius Petipa. Among the composer's most celebrated compositions was his score for La source (1866; composed jointly with L√©o Delibes), Don Quixote (1869); and La Bayad√®re (1877). Minkus also wrote supplemental material for insertion into already existing ballets. The most famous and enduring of these pieces is the Grand Pas classique from the ballet Paquita, which was added by Marius Petipa especially for a revival of the ballet staged for the benefit performance of the prima ballerina Ekaterina Vazem in 1881. For this revival Minkus also composed the Mazurka des enfants (Children's Mazurka) and an expanded edition of the ballet's Pas de trois, which would go on to become known as the Minkus pas de trois Today, Minkus's music is some of the most performed in all of ballet, and is a most integral part of the traditional classical ballet repertory.  Early life  Ludwig Minkus was born Aloysius Bernhard Philipp Minkus on 23 March 1826, in the Innere Stadt district of Vienna, the capital of the Austrian Empire. His father, Theodor Johann Minkus, was born in 1795 in Gro√ü-Meseritsch, Moravia (today known as Velk√© Mezi≈ô√≠ƒç√≠ near Brno, Moravia, in what is now the Czech Republic) and his mother, Maria Franziska Heimann was born in 1807 in Pest, Hungary. Minkus was of Jewish descent‚Äîhis parents converted to Catholicism not long before their relocation to Vienna, and were married on the following day. Minkus's father was a wholesale merchant of wine in Moravia, Austria and Hungary. He opened a restaurant in the Innere Stadt district of Vienna that featured its own small orchestra. This may have influenced the young Minkus‚Äîit is possible that he composed for his father's Tanzkapelle, one of many such orchestras in the imperial capital. By the age of four he began to receive private lessons in the violin, and from 1838 to 1842 he began his musical studies at the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna. Minkus made his public d√©but at a recital in Vienna at the age of eight. On 18 October 1845 an announcement in the Viennese newspaper Der Humorist commented on the performances of the previous season, and noted that, \\" ... (Minkus's playing featured) a conservative style with a glittering performance.\\" Soon the young Minkus was appearing in various concert halls as a soloist of note, having been declared a child prodigy by the public and critics. Minkus began composing for his instrument while he was still a student. Five pieces for the violin were published in 1846. At this time Minkus began to try his hand at conducting. For a time he was the regular conductor of an orchestra that competed with another under the baton of the young Johann Strauss II (in later years Strauss was acquainted with Minkus's brother Eugen, a bank director in Vienna). Minkus's life from 1842 to 1852 is poorly documented‚Äîtravel applications survive which show requests to visit Germany, France and England. In 1852 Minkus accepted the position of principal violinist to the Vienna Court Opera, but because this meant that he also had to fulfill the usual duties this position demanded, he resigned that same year to take up an important musical assignment abroad that would change his life forever.  Russia  In 1853 Ludwig Minkus emigrated to St. Petersburg, Russia to serve as conductor of the Serf orchestra of Prince Nikolai Yusupov, a post which Minkus occupied until 1855. That same year, Minkus married Maria Antoinette Schwarz at the Catholic Church of St. Catherine in St. Petersburg. Schwarz was also a native of Austria, born in Vienna in 1838. From 1856 until 1861 Minkus served as principal violinist in the orchestra of the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre, and soon he was given the dual position of conductor and principal violinist to the Imperial Italian Opera of that theatre. In 1861 Minkus was appointed as Concertmaster to the Bolshoi Theatre, and by 1864 he was promoted to the prestigious position of Inspector of the Imperial Theatre Orchestras in Moscow. At this time Minkus was also working as professor of violin at the newly established Moscow Conservatory. It was for the private performances at the Yusupov palace that Minkus composed what appears to be his first score for ballet, the mythological L‚Ä≤Union de Th√©tis et P√©l√©e (The Union of Thetis and Peleus), first performed in 1857. During his association with the Imperial Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, Minkus composed another score for ballet, the one-act Deux jours en Venise (Two Days In Venice), produced in 1862. = Collaborations with Arthur Saint-L√©on = Ekaterina Geltzer and Vassily Tikhomirov with corps de ballet in Alexander Gorsky's revival of the Minkus/Saint-L√©on Le Poisson dor√©; Moscow, circa 1905 Soloists and corps de ballet in Alexander Gorsky's revival of the Minkus/Saint-L√©on Le Poisson dor√©; Moscow, circa 1905 In late 1862 Minkus was called upon to compose an additional entr'acte featuring a solo for violin that was inserted into Adolphe Adam's score for Jean Coralli's ballet Orfa. The ballet was staged for the Imperial Bolshoi Theatre of Moscow by Arthur Saint-L√©on, who at that time was one of the most celebrated Ballet Masters in Europe. Since 1860 Saint-L√©on was engaged as Premier Ma√Ætre de Ballet of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres, a position which also required him to stage the occasional work for the Moscow ballet troupe. It was Saint-L√©on who commissioned Minkus's first score for a full-length Grand Ballet, the three-act La Flamme d‚Ä≤amour, ou La Salamandre (The Flame of Love, or The Salamander), which the Ballet Master produced especially for the renowned Russian Prima ballerina Marfa Muravieva. The premiere on was a great success for the ballet company of the Bolshoi Theatre. Saint-L√©on subsequently mounted the work in St. Petersburg for the Imperial Ballet in an elaborated staging for the benefit performance of Muravieva under the title Fiametta, ou L‚Ä≤amour du Diable (Fiametta, or The Love of the Devil). This version was first performed on at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre. Minkus later accompanied Saint-L√©on to mount this work in a new staging for the ballerina Muravieva at the Th√©√¢tre Imp√©rial de l'Op√©ra in Paris. For this staging the ballet's title was changed again as N√©m√©a, ou L‚Ä≤Amour veng√© (N√©m√©a, or The Avenged Love). At that time, ballets were performed at the Paris Op√©ra only as diversions during the intermissions of full-length operas, and as such Saint-L√©on's ballet was reduced to two- acts. The first performance took place on 11 July 1864 with an audience that included the Empress Eug√©nie. Featured along with Muravieva in the title role of N√©m√©a was the celebrated Premier danseur Louis M√©rante in the role of Count Molder and the ballerina Eug√©nie Fiocre in the role of Cupid. Minkus's score was praised by the critics of day, among them Th√©ophile Gautier, who found the music be filled with a \\" .. haunting, dreamy quality. The music for the dances were filled with sparkling melodies and infectious rhythms.\\" N√©m√©a, ou L‚Ä≤Amour veng√© was retained for fifty-three performances in the Op√©ra's repertory until 1871. Saint-L√©on also mounted the work for the ballet of the Teatro Comunale in Trieste, where it premiered on 15 March 1868 as Nascita della Fiamma d‚Ä≤Amore (Birth of the Flame of Love). The change of titles of this work has caused much confusion among historians, many of whom have claimed that each of these productions were completely different works altogether. In the fall of 1866 Saint-L√©on was invited to stage a new work for the Th√©√¢tre Imp√©rial de l'Op√©ra. This was La Source, which was written by Minkus in collaboration with the composer L√©o Delibes. The division of labor was as follows: Minkus wrote the whole of Act I and the second tableau of Act III, while Delibes wrote the whole of Act II and the first tableau of Act III. Surviving documents and contemporary accounts do not offer an explanation as to why the score was shared between the two composers. La Source premiered on 12 November 1866, and was retained until 1876 after seventy-three performances. Saint-L√©on continued to work with Minkus throughout the 1860s. On Saint-L√©on presented his one-act ballet Le Poisson dor√© (The Golden Fish), which was staged at Peterhof in honor of the wedding of the Tsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich to the Princess Dagmar of Denmark. Saint-L√©on chose a Russian subject for this work, derived from Alexander Pushkin's 1835 poem Skazka o rybake i rybke (The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish). For the Imperial Ballet's 1867‚Äì1868 season, Saint- L√©on expanded Le Poisson dor√© into a three-act Grand ballet, first presented on with the great Italian ballerina Guglielmina Salvioni in the principal role of Galia. Minkus's score featured several traditional Russian folk melodies, as well as virtuoso passages for solo flute written especially for the renowned Italian flautist Cesare Ciardi. The following season Minkus and Saint-L√©on produced the ballet Le Lys (The Lily), based on a Chinese legend Three Arrows. The ballet featured a score by Minkus that was derived from the composer's work on La Source. The ballet premiered at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre on for the benefit performance of the ballerina Ad√®le Grantzow. In spite of his efforts, both Le Lys and the expanded Le Poisson dor√© proved to be catastrophic failures for Saint-L√©on. In light of this the directorate of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres did not renew the Ballet Master's contract, and soon he re-located to Paris where he died in 1870. = Collaborations with Marius Petipa = Through his association with Saint-L√©on and the St. Petersburg Imperial Ballet, Minkus came to the attention of the renowned choreographer Marius Petipa. Petipa arrived in the imperial capital in 1847, where he was engaged as Premier danseur to the Imperial Theatres, as well as assistant to the Ballet Master Jules Perrot, who served as Premier Ma√Ætre de Ballet to the company from 1850‚Äì1859. Petipa was named second Ma√Ætre de Ballet after the success of his grand ballet The Pharaoh's Daughter, set to the score of the Italian composer Cesare Pugni. Pugni had served as Ballet Composer of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres since 1850, a post which was created especially for him when he accompanied Perrot to Russia that same year. By the mid-1860s the composer was nearing the end of his life and prolific career. As the decade drew to a close he became increasingly unreliable due to his severe alcoholism, often putting off composing to the last minute and supplying music of an increasingly poor and banal quality. Saint-L√©on and Petipa were becoming extremely frustrated with him, and so began to turn to Minkus.

St. Petersburg, 1900 Scene The Kingdom of the Laces from the Minkus/Petipa Les Pilules magiques, St. Petersburg, 1886. This work was created for a gala celebrating the inauguration of the Mariinsky Theatre as principal venue of the Imperial Ballet and Opera, and has the distinction of being the first new ballet created for the theatre. For the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre's 1869‚Äì1870 season, Petipa staged a Grand ballet based on Miguel de Cervantes' early 17th century novel Don Quixote. Although plans were made to have a score supplied by Pugni, Petipa instead turned to Minkus, who supplied a score filled with a great variety of Spanish-styled flair. Petipa's Don Quixote premiered to a resounding success on , and went on to become a celebrated work in the classical ballet repertory. Not long before Saint-L√©on's death, Petipa was named Premier Ma√Ætre de Ballet of the St. Peterbsurg Imperial Theatres. Petipa then staged a new version of his Don Quixote for the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg, and for this production Minkus completely reworked and expanded his score. This staging of Don Quixote premiered on , and instantly became a classic, earning Minkus great acclaim for his effective music. With the death of Cesare Pugni in January 1870 the official post of ballet composer was left vacant. With the success of his score for Petipa's Don Quixote, Minkus was now named Ballet Composer of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres, which marked the beginning of a long and productive collaboration between him and Petipa. They would go on to produce La Camargo in 1872, an expanded four-act production of Jacques Offenbach's Le Papillon in 1874, Les Brigands (The Bandits) in 1875, Les Aventures de P√©l√©e (The Adventures of Peleus), Le Songe d'une nuit d'√©t√© (A Midsummer Night's Dream, based on Felix Mendelssohn's incidental music) in 1876, and finally La Bayad√®re in 1877, which would go on to be the most enduring and well preserved work for which Minkus composed the music. During this time, Minkus continued playing violin in professional capacities. For example, he was the second violin in the ensemble that premiered Tchaikovsky's String Quartet No. 1 in D, Op. 11, in Moscow on 28 March 1871.John Warrack, Tchaikovsky, p. 275 Minkus's scores featured violin cadenzas written especially for the great Leopold Auer. Minkus wrote the music for Petipa's Nuit et Jour, a sumptuous pi√®ce d'occasion staged especially for the celebrations held at the Imperial Bolshoi Theatre of Moscow in honor of the coronation of Emperor Alexander III in 1883. The Emperor, a fanatic balletomane, bestowed upon Minkus the Order of Saint Stanislaus for his score. During the ceremony the newly crowned Emperor told Minkus \\" ... you have reached perfection as a ballet composer.\\" Petipa's Les Pilules magiques (The Magic Pills), which premiered was a grand work staged for the inauguration of the newly renovated Imperial Mariinsky Theatre, which was now the Imperial Ballet and Opera's principal venue. Les Pilules magiques was in the tradition of vaudeville, and aside from Petipa's danced episodes included comedy and singing. Minkus naturally supplied the music for Petipa's danced passages in three fantastical tableaux that caused a sensation among the St. Petersburg balletomanes and critics. The first took place in a cave inhabited by sorceresses, while the second included various card games brought to life through dance. The third and final tableau was known as The Kingdom of the Laces in which a Grand divertissement of national dances from Belgium, England, Spain and Russia was performed. Minkus's next score was for Petipa's one-act ballet L'Offrandes √† l'Amour, staged especially for the benefit performance of the ballerina Eugenia Sokolova on . Minkus's music was hailed as a masterwork of ballet music by contemporary critics. It would be his last known ballet score for Petipa.  Retirement  Minkus, St. Petersburg, circa 1880 By 1886 Minkus's contract with the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres was set to expire. In light of this, the director of the Imperial Theatres Ivan Vsevolozhsky felt that the time had come for Minkus's long held post of official ballet composer to be abolished in an effort to diversify the music supplied for the ballet. Minkus officially retired soon after, and on was given a farewell benefit performance. That same year the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatre's Kapellmeister Alexei Papkov also retired. In light of the departure of both Minkus and Papkov, Ivan Vsevolozhsky abolished the ballet orchestra, and employed the Italian Riccardo Drigo for the newly created position of Director of Music for the Imperial Ballet. Drigo would now serve in the dual capacity as chef d'orchestre for ballet performances and the conducting of Italian opera, as well as any musical tailoring or additional pieces needed by the Ballet Master. It is unlikely that Minkus ever worked again for the Imperial Theatres in an official capacity. Differing accounts survive from contemporary sources concerning Minkus's involvement in the final two productions in Russia to credit him as composer. These works were first presented between Minkus's retirement in 1886 and his final departure from Russia in 1891. The first was a revival by Marius Petipa of Saint-L√©on's Fiametta, which had an original score supplied by Minkus. Petipa had revived this work especially for the visiting Italian ballerina Elena Cornalba, the first performance being given on . It is highly unlikely that Minkus participated in this revival due to the fact that Riccardo Drigo supplied nearly all of the supplemental music for Cornalba's appearances in already- existing ballets during her season with the Imperial Ballet. Petipa's Kalkabrino--a work that has been historically credited to Minkus--premiered on for the benefit performance of another visiting Italian, Carlotta Brianza, who in the previous year created the role of the Princess Aurora in the Petipa/Tchaikovsky The Sleeping Beauty. Although the score for Kalkabrino was credited exclusively to Minkus it is not certain if the composer took part in its creation, which Russian historians have stated was a score set to a pastiche of airs taken from the many works Minkus composed for the Imperial Ballet during his long career in St. Petersburg. It is likely that this score may have been composed some years before for a work which never premiered.  Departure from Russia and later life  Minkus and his wife Maria left Russia forever in the summer of 1891, relocating to their native Vienna. The composer lived in semi-retirement on a modest pension from the Tsar's treasury. For a time he lived in the Karl Ludwig Strasse on the third floor of a rented apartment belonging to his friend, the revered pianist and teacher Theodor Leschetizky. These years saw Minkus's last known compositions: Das Maskenfest (The Masked Festival) was originally written by the composer as Tanz und Mythe (Dance and Myth) in 1897 for the ballet of the Kaiserliches und K√∂nigliches Hof-Operntheater (a.k.a. the Vienna Court Opera). The ballet was rejected outright by the Operntheater's directorate Gustav Mahler, who felt that the work's libretto was out of touch with contemporary tastes. Minkus then composed Die Dryaden (The Dryads) for the Viennese stage in 1899, a ballet in one act. The final work associated with Minkus's name before his death was R√ºbezahl, staged in 1907 at the Court Opera to a pastiche of airs taken from his and Delibes's La Source and the works of Johan Strauss II. Minkus later relocated to an apartment in the Gentzgasse where he spent his final years alone and in utter poverty, his wife having died in 1895, and the events of World War I having cut off his pension from Russia. During the extremely cold winter of 1917, Minkus developed pneumonia and died on 7 December 1917 at the age of ninety-one. With no children of his own, Minkus was survived only by a niece, Clara von Minkus. Ludwig Minkus was interred at the D√∂bling Cemetery in Vienna. In 1939 Minkus's grave fell victim to the national socialist policies of the time when all cemeteries were systematically \\"cleansed\\" by the invading Nazi regime. Any graves of persons who were considered ethnically \\"undesirable\\"--especially if one was of Jewish descent or without any documented subscriber to the annual cemetery fees--were exhumed and deposited into a mass anonymous grave.

The name derives from the Schuylkill River, which flows through the valley where the district is located. Geography Schuilkill Valley is located in southeastern Pennsylvania, near the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch Country. The district lies in the valley created by the Blue Mountain to the north and the Schuylkill River to the south. It encompasses approximately , including the municipalities of Bern, Centre, and Ontelaunee Townships and the boroughs of Leesport and Centerport. The district is both rural and suburban, including farmland as well as business and light industry. Map of Berks County, Pennsylvania Public School Districts. Schuylkill Valley School District is in green in the north central part of the county. History Schuylkill Valley was formed out of Ontelaunee School District in 1958. The old high school and elementary schools in Centre and Bern Township, built in the early 1900s, were kept in use until new facilities were constructed. A new high school was constructed in 1961 and a middle school was built adjacent to the high school in 1975. It wasn't until the mid-1990s that the aging elementary schools were merged into a new building, sharing campus space with the middle and high school. In 2001, an expansion of the high school added an auxiliary gym and expanded musical facilities for band, chorus, and theater programs. In 2008, fifth grade was moved from the elementary school after completion of a middle school expansion project. The renovation also added an auditorium, a new cafeteria, and teaching areas. During the summer of 2010, the high school auditorium underwent renovations with total cost of the project approaching, if not exceeding, $500,000. It included new carpeting, sound booth/room, re- finished stage, new acoustics for the roof, and other additions. In the year of 2017, a new, renovated stadium was constructed from the beginning of the summer of 2017, to the end of October 2017. The project cost approximately 1 million dollars. Campus The Schuylkill Valley School District campus is located at the intersection of Route 61 and Route 73, south of Leesport and north of Reading.

Like Masaki Segawa's first manga Basilisk, The Yagyu Ninja Scrolls is based on a novel from Futaro Yamada's Ninp≈çch≈ç series and can therefore be considered a sequel to Basilisk, especially as several of the same historical characters featured in Basilisk make a return appearance. Its story centers on seven female survivors of the Hori clan, aided by Yagy≈´ J≈´bei, and their quest of vengeance. Plot In the Nineteenth Year of Kannei (1642), a rebellion by the Hori clan against Kat≈ç Akinari, the daimy≈ç of Aizu, has been suppressed through the intervention of the Tokugawa shogunate. Placed into the custody of the Seven Spears, Kat≈ç's brutal group of personal enforcers, the Hori men are dragged to the T≈çkei-ji \\"Divorce Temple\\" at Kamakura where the Hori women had been hiding. Despite a law passed by the former shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu forbidding men to enter the temple, the Seven Spears force their way in and brutally slaughter the Hori women before their husbands and brothers, before proceeding to murder them too. The massacre is stopped only by the intervention of Princess Sen, the T≈çkei-ji Temple's guardian and older sister to the reigning shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu. Unfortunately, though the Seven Spears agreed to depart, only seven of the Hori women survived. In retribution for the violation of T≈çkeiji Temple and those who she had taken under her care, Princess Sen sends a message to the famous monk Takuan S≈çh≈ç to locate one person who can train the seven Hori women in the arts of ninjutsu to seek their revenge. The one chosen is Yagy≈´ J≈´bei Mitsuyoshi, son of Yagy≈´ Munenori and former instructor to the shogun. With Jubei's instruction and guidance, the Hori women begin their war against the Seven Spears and ultimately Kat≈ç himself. Characters *' - Son of the famous Yagy≈´ Munenori, J≈´bei was formerly a sword instructor for Shogun Iemitsu but gave up the post to his younger brother in order to live as a wandering swordsman. Chosen by Takuan S≈çh≈ç at the request of Princess Sen to train the Hori women in the arts of war, J≈´bei had strong doubts as to whether they would be able to win but agreed to teach them as it might prove interesting. As the Seven Spears greatly outclass the Hori women in terms of power and martial ability, J≈´bei instead instructs them in the ways of military strategy, devising ambush tactics for the Hori women to eliminate the Seven Spears one by one in ways that neutralize their individual skills. Although a harsh and merciless teacher (Takuan relates to Princess Sen how during one of his lessons with Iemitsu J≈´bei beat his student to the point that Iemitsu couldn't even stand), J≈´bei has a mischievous streak to him and he enjoys needling and annoying the Hori women while his cavalier attitude belies both his strong sense of justice and his dedication to his students. =The Hori Clan= *' - Lord of the Hori Clan and former samurai to Aizu daimy≈ç Kat≈ç Akinari. Despite his disgust at the wanton acts of violence and depravity performed by his lord, Mondo performed his required duty as Kat≈ç's Kuni-Garo (chief vassal) until he was pressured to surrender his daughter Ochie to be Kat≈ç's mistress. Knowing that Kat≈ç would never accept his refusal, Mondo sent Ochie and the other Hori women into hiding at T≈çkei-ji Temple while he and his men launched an assault on Kat≈ç's castle. Defeated by his soldiers, Mondo and his men fled to Koyasan where they posed as monks before being captured by Shogunate forces who turned them over to the Seven Spears. Mondo was then dragged in stocks to T≈çkei-ji where he was forced to witness the slaughter of nearly all the Hori women before being taken back to Aizu where he and his men were brutally tortured to death. *' - The daughter of Hori Mondo and princess to the Hori. Following the genocide of her clan, Ochie rises to take leadership of the survivors in their quest for revenge against Kat≈ç and the Seven Spears. Because of the abuse she and the others suffered at the hands of Kat≈ç and his subordinates, Ochie develops an aversion to all men and at first refuses to accept Jubei's help yet gradually comes to respect him as both a mentor and a comrade. *' - The attendant and confidante of Ochie, Ofue is the most easily distinguished of the Hori women due to her shorter, brown hair. The most outspoken of the Hori women, Ofue is easily riled which makes her a prime target for Jubei's teasing. She frequently serves as comic relief. Though she hates Jyubei at first, she gradually develops a large crush on him, which she reveals in the fourth volume of the manga, much to the amusement of the other Hori women. *' - The daughter of Mondo's brother Manabe Shobei and cousin to Ochie. Quiet and introspective, Sakura is sometimes assigned by J≈´bei to spy on their enemies as her close-cropped hair allows her to disguise herself as either a woman or a young man. *' - The wife of Mondo's brother Tagei Matahachiro and aunt to Ochie and Sakura. Osawa is a talented seamstress whom J≈´bei assigns to create whatever costumes and disguises are required to spy or entrap their enemies. She serves as a mother figure to the other Hori women. *' - The wife of Mondo's vassal Kanemaru Hansaku. Although dedicated to avenging her clan, Oshina is the most timid of the surviving women and rarely speaks. *' - The daughter of Mondo's vassal Itakura Buden. Despite her plump frame, she possesses both great agility and balance which aided her during her duel with Magobei. *' - The wife of Mondo's vassal Inaba Jyuzaburo. When the Seven Spears start terrorizing Edo and kidnapping couples on their wedding night to lure out Jyubei, Okei and Jyubei disguise themselves as a recently married couple and allow themselves to be kidnapped by the Spears. They are taken to the Kat≈ç mansion, where they plan to take Lord Akinari hostage. The plan goes awry, and without the surprise intervention of Ochie, Ofue, and Sakura, who had followed them in secret, they both would have perished in the mansion. After the ordeal, the other Hori women begin to show jealousy toward her, thinking that Jyubei had begun to favor her ever since she played the role of his bride. =The Kat≈ç Clan and the Ashina= *' - The daimyo of Aizu and lord of the Kat≈ç clan (the historical Kat≈ç Akinari ruled Aizu between 1631 and 1643). Sadistic and perverse, Kat≈ç ruthlessly slaughters any who oppose him and spends his days fornicating with the constantly changing members of his harem. Although Kat≈ç's public face is of a fearless and powerful noble such as when he held his own against the attempted intimidation by Date Masamune (a bold man known as The One-Eyed Dragon); his private moments reveal him to be an insecure and apprehensive individual plagued by nightmares and constantly overshadowed by the legacy of his father. The Ashina A clan of ninja who once ruled over Aizu, the Ashina rescued Lord Kat≈ç seven years prior to the manga's beginning when he was attacked by an unknown assailant while out hawking. In gratitude, Kat≈ç selected seven of the strongest Ashina to be his personal bodyguards and enforcers, naming them the Seven Spears of Aizu after the historical Seven Spears of Shizugatake whom his father, Kat≈ç Yoshiaki, had led. The Ashina are as perverse as their Lord and whenever Kat≈ç grows bored with any of his consorts, the unlucky women are given to the Seven Spears who rape and torture them to death. *' - The primary villain of the second half of the series. Dohaku is Lord of the Ashina ninja clan and vassal to Kat≈ç. He trained the Seven Spears and holds the true power in Aizu, ruling from behind Kat≈ç's throne. He is 107 years old, the father of Oyura, and the twin brother of the High Priest Tenkai. His life is inextricably linked to that of his holy brother: if one is wounded the other will also feel pain; if one is killed, then the other one will die at the same time. But like Yakushiji Tenzen, the villain in Basilisk (Yamada/Segawa's previous work), Dohaku seems to be unkillable, and any attack to his body will heal in a matter of moments. His ultimate goal is for the Ashina clan to obtain complete and legitimate dominion over Aizu by joining the Kato and Ashina houses through Lord Akinari's union with Oyura. Dohaku plans to assassinate Akinari's son Akitomo so that Akinari and Oyura's child (Dohaku's grandchild) will become the new heir to Aizu's power. After dealing a death-blow to his own daughter while trying to kill J≈´bei, Dohaku tries to destroy himself with the intention of also destroying his twin brother Tenkai, but Tenkai's determination to thwart Dohaku proves overpowering and J≈´bei is able to strike Dohaku down. *' - The daughter of Ashina Dohaku. Oyura is beautiful and seductive, and serves as Lord Akinari's main concubine in Aizu. She first appears in the sixth volume and the seventh one reveals her to be as cruel and sadistic as Kat≈ç, and delights in slaughtering many of the women kidnapped and imprisoned beneath Aizu castle. She and Kat≈ç are almost always seen being extremely intimate with one another regardless of where they are and who is present, including her own father who simply ignores their affairs while he discussed certain matters with the Seven Spears. However, after J≈´bei's capture, she ultimately fell in love with him, to the point of taking a fatal blow from her father meant for J≈´bei (though not realizing it would kill her). =The Seven Spears= *' - The oldest of the seven spears, Tessai wields a two-handed scythe that can be split in half to form a kusarigama. The weapon also contains a weighted chain in the butt of the handle and a retractable secondary scythe blade in the head. Tessai is easily angered and will even lash out at his allies if he feels they've insulted him. Tessai often goes to the Yoshiwara brothel district to purchase women on his lord Akinari's behalf. In fact, a flashback in the first volume reveals that Tessai was the one who requested that Hori Mondo send his daughter (Ochie) to serve as Akinari's mistress. In response, Mondo rebuked Tessai, insulted Akinari, and later lead the doomed rebellion against his cruel lord, setting off the events of the story. Tessai dies at the hands of the Hori women, ambushed at dusk in the streets of Yoshiwara. After a short fight, the women trap and immobilize both ends of his chained weapon, then rush in from all sides to stab him with their blades. He is the first of the Spears to die. *' - Magobei stands out among the other Seven Spears due to his dark complexion. A specialist in long range combat, he wields a cavalry spear with the same speed and precision on foot as he would on horseback. In the second volume of the manga, Magobei accompanies Tessai to the Yoshiwara brothel district to purchase concubines for Lord Akinari. Disgusted by the brothel owner's smugness, he declares to Tessai that he will not return with him later to pick up the women. This decision may have saved his life--Tessai returns to Yoshiwara alone, where he is ambushed and killed by the Hori women. In the third volume of the manga Magobei pairs up with Gusoku Jyonoshin to confront Jyubei and Otoro at night in the streets outside Edo Castle. A canal divides the street between him and Jyubei, and so he strikes across the water with his spear. Jyubei swiftly traps the spearblade to the ground, disabling the weapon while Otori charges across the shaft, using it as a bridge to cross the canal and strike down Magobei. Magobei draws his wakizashi and slices through the shaft of his trapped spear, but instead of falling into the canal Otori springs into the air, catapulting herself above and inside his range of attack. Her blade slices him vertically from head to navel. He is the second of the Spears to die. *' - The weakest of the Seven Spears, Jyunoshin specializes neither in weapons nor hand-to-hand combat. Instead, he controls a pack of vicious dogs the size of calves whom he uses to hunt down and ultimately tear his opponents to pieces. His small size and overlong arms cause him to resemble a monkey, a fact the other Seven Spears frequently use to insult him. In the manga's third volume, Jyunoshin aides Magobei in a sneak assault on both J≈´bei and Otori which ended in the death of both Magobei and two of Jyunoshin's dogs at the hands of Jubei, leaving Jyunoshin deeply traumatized and convinced that the Hori women's mysterious teacher was well beyond their ability to slay. Following the Hori women's infiltration of the Kat≈ç mansion in the fourth volume, Jyonoshin and Lord Akinari were captured and cast before Edo Castle's Takebashi Gate, where they were discovered by Princess Sen. The princess recognized them and, as punishment for their wickedness, had them marched through the streets of Edo like common criminals, exposing them to public ridicule. Following the incident, Lord Akinari went into a blind rage and promised to have Jyonoshin killed unless he uncovered the whereabouts of the Hori women. Using Tenmaru, his only surviving dog, Jyonoshin tracked the Hori women to Tokaiji temple. Shaving his head and posing as a priest, Jyonoshin managed to enter the temple where he discovered Ochie picking flowers in the temple grounds. Taking her by surprise, Jyonoshin gloatingly remarked that it had been he who had finished off Ochie's father Mondo in an attempt to goad her into attacking when Osawa, who had been hiding in a nearby tree, leaped down from the branches and drove her sword into Jyonoshin, pinning him to the ground. He is the third of the Spears to die. *' - The most physically powerful of the Seven Spears, Rensuke is easily distinguished by his massive chin and sideburns. He disdains the use of weapons in favor of kenp≈ç (Japanese martial arts inspired by Chinese martial arts) and his own inhuman strength. During the Seven Spears assault on T≈çkei-ji, Rensuke was able to break open the temple's gate using his bare hands and feet. In the fourth volume of the series, while the Seven Spears are terrorizing Edo in Hannya masks, Jyubei tries (unsuccessfully) to pose as Rensuke in order to enter the Kat≈ç mansion. Koshichiro sees through his ruse and strikes at him, splitting the hannya mask to reveal not Rensuke, but Yagy≈´ Jyubei (though through the darkness and rain he cannot recognize Jyubei's features.) Aside from Jyonoshin, Rensuke appears to have the most self-control of the Seven Spears, though his stems from his own intelligence, whereas Jyonoshi's is typically the result of cowardice. He is often called upon to hold Ginshiro back when the boy's tantrums threaten to become dangerous. In the sixth volume of the manga, Rensuke attempts to hunt down the Hori women and captures Otori and Oshina on the Aizu Echigo Road. He strips them of clothing and ties them to his body as a shield. As a result, J≈´bei is prepared to offer his life for theirs when their monk companions from T≈çkei-ji Temple take up their own swords and confront Rensuke. They drop the swords for the captive women as Rensuke kills them, allowing Otori and Oshina to seize the blades and sever Rensuke's legs. As he bleeds to death, J≈´bei arrives on the scene, pinning Rensuke to the ground with his foot so the big man cannot struggle toward the women. Rensuke realizes J≈´bei Yagy≈´ was his true enemy, and he smiles as he dies, contented by the fact that ultimately he had been defeated not by women, but by the greatest and most famous swordsman in the world. He is the fourth of the Spears to die. *' - A one-eyed pig of a man, Ichiganbo's bulk belies both his incredible martial ability and his cunning. Highly observant, he's usually the first to figure out crucial aspects that his comrades overlook and was the one who proposed framing Princess Sen in order to draw out Jubei. According to his plan, the Seven Spears would dress up in hannya masks and terrorize Edo, kidnapping betrothed couples on their wedding nights. The women would be brought to Akinari, and the men would be tortured and cast off in front of Edo Castle's Takebashi gate. In battle, he wields a whip that responds as though it were an extension of his own being. He can even use it to amputate parts of an opponent's body by wrapping it around their limbs or necks and pulling the whip taut. In the seventh volume of the manga, Ichiganbo leads a patrol of one dozen men into the wilderness of Northern Aizu to seek out the Hori women, who have infiltrated Lord Kat≈ç's territory. He is ambushed and killed by the Hori women, who had been concealing themselves in the fallen autumn leaves, stabbing him on all sides. Ochie finishes him off, splitting his head like a log with her blade. After his death, Ichiganbo's body is hidden inside a snowman outside Lord Kat≈ç's castle, where it is discovered on New Year's Day (Ashina Dohaku's birthday, incidentally) by Koshichiro and Ginshiro. He is the fifth of the Spears to die. *' - The youngest of the Seven Spears, Ginshiro is cocky and impulsive. He is very feminine in appearance, but his otherwise beautiful features are marred by a thin, dark, scar that runs vertically down the middle of his face. He wields a net that when folded can easily be concealed within the palm of his hand yet when deployed can expand to envelop multiple people. The net possesses surprising strength despite its delicate appearance and its mesh is fine enough that not even air can pass through. Following Jubei's surprise raid on Kat≈ç's mansion, Ginshiro was the one who discovered that the Hori women had departed the convent. He also lusts after Sakura as during the murder of the Hori clan's female members he requests that the others allow him to slay her personally. Of all the Seven Spears, Ginshiro has the quickest temper and the least self-control. He is prone to sudden, violent rages, and often resorts to hissing, screaming, and insults when faced with a conflict. When Oyuri, under the influence of a powerful aphrodisiac, almost distracts J≈´bei, he tries to use his net, but is wounded by Jubei before the net can land; when the net envelops the Hori women, J≈´bei slices off the arm controlling the net. He is the sixth to die. *' - The central member of the Seven Spears, Koshichiro is a master swordsman despite missing his left arm. In the first volume, he leads the massacre at the convent in Kamakura. Throughout the series, but more noticeably in later volumes, Koshichiro is portrayed as Jyubei's opposite among the enemy. He is bent on crossing blades with Jyubei, eager to determine once and for all which of them is the better swordsman. In the fourth volume, after being defeated in a brief encounter with the Seven Spears, Jyubei expresses doubt as to whether or not he would be able to defeat Koshichiro if they ever dueled. Koshichiro shows a peculiar mannerism when he kills, as shown in volumes 1, 9, and 11. Before engaging an opponent, he slips a flowering twig of cherry blossoms into his mouth (if one is available), and grips it in his teeth as he attacks. Though the manga does not specify a reason for this, there seems to be a poetic significance behind this quirk; falling cherry blossoms have traditionally been seen by samurai as a metaphor for death and the fragility of life. He is the last of the Seven Spears to die, finished off by Ochie and Ofue after having been granted his greatest wish by J≈´bei to face him one-on-one. =Others= *' - The grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu and the current reigning shogun. In the years between Basilisk and The Yagy≈´ Ninja Scrolls, Iemitsu has grown from a somewhat dimwitted child into a capable and efficient ruler. Although he sympathizes with the Hori clan, his responsibilities as Shogun demand that he arrest them for the crime of rebellion and deliver them to Kat≈ç for punishment. As the Hori women had hidden in a divorce temple forbidding the entrance of men, Iemitsu was willing to spare at least them and was greatly troubled to hear that the Ashina were the ones charged with delivering the Hori to Aizu. *' - The archbishop of Kanneiji temple. As with Ieyasu, Tenkai serves in Shogun Iemitsu's inner circle as his most trusted advisor. While he agrees with Iemitsu's decision to turn over the Hori men to Kat≈ç while leaving the Hori women sequestered in the divorce temple, Tenkai is all too aware of the Ashina clan's capacity for violence and the potential of the Seven Spears to escalate the already tenuous situation. He is the twin brother of Ashina Dohaku. *' - The father of Yagy≈´ J≈´bei and another former member of Tokugawa Ieyasu's inner circle. In the years between Basilisk and The Yagy≈´ Ninja Scrolls, Munenori had been appointed sometsuke (the overseer of the daimyo) and since retired yet still holds a place in Iemitsu's council. Like Tenkai, he supports Iemitsu's decision to arrest the Hori men, stating that regardless of how justified their actions, allowing any sort of anarchy to go unpunished would jeorpardize the Tokugawa Shogunate's hold over the various regions. *' - The granddaughter of Ieyasu and older sister to Shogun Iemitsu. As the guardian of T≈çkei-ji Temple, Princess Sen was the one who convinced her grandfather to enact a law banning any man from entering. When Hori Mondo staged his rebellion against the Kat≈ç clan, Princess Sen agreed to grant shelter for the Hori women, disguising them as nuns but permitting them to keep their hair in the hopes that they would be able to leave once the matter had been settled. When the Seven Spears launched their attack, Princess Sen offered her life in exchange for the seven surviving Hori women and the Seven Spears retreated for fear that she would convince Iemitsu to have Mondo and his men released as well. Because both of her prior husbands died shortly after marrying her, a rumor spread throughout Edo stating that she seduced men only to kill them after having her way with them. Following the death of Magobei, the remaining Seven Spears took advantage of the rumor in order to draw out J≈´bei by framing her for the kidnapping of several soon to be married couples throughout Edo. *' - The high priestess of T≈çkei-ji Temple and the granddaughter of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Ieyasu's sworn rival. Following the Siege of Osaka in which the Toyotomi clan perished, Tenshuni was adopted by Princess Sen - whom Ieyasu had wed to Hideyoshi's son Hideyori as part of his political ambitions-and sequestered in T≈çkei-ji. During the raid by the Seven Spears, Tenshuni was almost killed by Ginshiro who enveloped her in his net and nearly suffocated her before Ochie and the other Hori women revealed themselves. Although put off by Jubei's lack of grace, Tenshuni allows him to stay at T≈çkei-ji to train the Hori women under the condition that he wear a set of bells to alert the other nuns to his presence. J≈´bei would later repay the favor by having the Hori women wear bells while staying at Tokaiji. *' - The High Priest of Shinagawa Banshozan Tokaiji Temple in Edo. Because of his friendships with various generals and swordsmen, Takuan was asked by Princess Sen to find a sensei who could train the surviving Hori women to defeat the Seven Spears. Later, as the Hori women begin their assault, he grants them and J≈´bei shelter at his temple since the last place the Seven Spears would look for them would be a monastery forbidding women to enter. *' - The owner of the Nishida-ya Brothel in Yoshiwara who frequently sells girls to Kat≈ç. In the past, Jinnemon was a bandit known as Shoji Jinnai who plundered the region of Kankatsu-sa as part of a trio of thieves known as the Three Jinnais. Although he learns of the way Kat≈ç abuses and eventually kills his consorts, he continues to sell women to him in exchange for higher costs to ensure his silence. After the Hori women kill Tessai who had been escorting the latest group of girls Kat≈ç had purchased, J≈´bei assaults Jinnemon and forces him to provide money for the girls to escape, promising that he would return if Jinnemon ever sold another woman to the Kat≈ç clan. *' - The 19-year-old daughter of , owner of the Koga Lodgings. She first appears in sixth volume of the manga. During their stay at the Koga Lodgings, the Seven Spears become gravely concerned for their lord, who had grown paranoid to the point where he couldn't sleep and would often mutter to himself that Hori Mondo's ghost was haunting him (supposedly as retribution for slaughtering his clan). An irritated Ginshiro suggested to his fellow Spears that they find a woman to keep their lord company in hopes that it would help ease his paranoia. Otone was chosen for this purpose and is later kidnapped in her sleep by Ginshiro. The following morning, just before departing the lodge, the Spears presented Otone, bound up and terrified, to Kat≈ç who took an instant liking to her and incessantly violates her inside the palanquin throughout the trip. Otone was eventually rescued by Takuan, his followers and three of the Hori women who were disguised as priests at the time. Indebted to them for saving her, Otone joins the Hori women in their quest of vengeance against the Seven Spears. Publication The Yagy≈´ Ninja Scrolls was serialised in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine from 2005 to 2008, and was licensed for English publication by Del Rey Manga, which released seven volumes from 2007 to 2009. It was re-licensed by Kodansha USA and they released the full manga digitaly from August 9, 2016 to April 11, 2017. =Volume list= Reception In Jason Thompson's online appendix to Manga The Complete Guide, he praised the layouts of the manga, and described the character designs as \\"reminiscent of Go Nagai\\". Theron Martin, writing for Anime News Network about the first two volumes, enjoyed the attention to historical detail, but felt the character designs were \\"overly harsh\\". A.E. Sparrow, writing for IGN, appreciated the distinct character designs for the women and their enemies.

While the concession improved water and sanitation services, it failed to meet all its specified targets. After the collapse of Enron the concession was overtaken by Argentine investors. Besides OSM water services in the province are provided by the three municipalities of Maip√∫, Luj√°n and Tupungatu and 174 small not-for- profit operators. With 1.6 million inhabitants the province of Mendoza is the fifth most populous province of Argentina. The province has an arid climate and its water supply depends on rivers fed by glaciers from the Andes.  History  = Sector reform (1993-1998) = In 1993, in response to poor service quality, the provincial Parliament passed a law (Law 6044) with the objective of restructuring the province‚Äôs water and sanitation sector, introducing a private concession for the provincially owned company Obras Sanitarias de Mendoza (OSM) and creating a regulatory agency for the sector. In the same year the provincial government also first submitted a draft law to Parliament to pursue a policy of installing water meters and volumetric billing. More than 120,000 meters were installed in the following five years. However, that law was never passed. Meters were thus not read and fell into disrepair, while bills continued to be issued on a lump sum basis independently of consumption. Moreover, a culture of non-payment reigned. According to a survey by the newspaper Los Andes, in 1999 one quarter of water users did not pay their water bills. = Early years of the concession (1998-2001) = In 1998 the provincial government launched a bid for a concession for OSM, which was won by a US-French-Argentine consortium led by Enron. OSM‚Äôs capital was thus held by the following entities: *50% by the Enron-led consortium Inversores del Aconcagua *20% by an operating company called Aguas de Mendoza *20% were kept by the provincial government *10% by the company‚Äôs employees. Inversora del Aconcagua initially consisted of the US firm Enron (57.5%), the French firm SAUR International (17.5%), Italgas (5%) and Argentine investors (20%). Aguas de Mendoza is fully owned by SAUR International. The concession contract was signed for the unusually long duration of 99 years. Investment commitments were US$ 89million over 25 years. Tariffs were supposed to remain stable for the first five years of the contract. However, there was a 37% increase after the renegotiation of the concession in 2003. = The concession after the economic crisis (2001 onwards) = After the economic crisis of 2001 and the devaluation of the peso, a number of problems became apparent: * Tariffs were frozen in 2002 by a national emergency decree, in contradiction of tariff increases stipulated in the concession contract. As a result, revenues were insufficient to recover increasing costs; * There were delays in the execution of works; * There were problems of bacteriological pollution of drinking water; * Low water pressure (40% of users do not receive water below minimum pressure); * Insufficient attention to user complaints; * Reduction of environmental targets. In 2002 a process was initiated to renegotiate the concession contract. When Enron went bankrupt in 2003 its part of the shares was initially taken over by its own subsidiary Azurix. In 2004 the shares of OSM were worth only one fifth of their value in 1998. In the same year South Water Argentina SA of the Sielecki Group took over 32% of the shares of OSM from Enron after the latter went bankrupt. http://www.clarin.com/diario/2004/01/08/p-01501.htm Clar√≠n.com: El agua de Mendoza, de la Enron a capitales nacionales According to Susana Yelich, director of the consumer group Prodelco, service provision in 2004 was much better than at the time when OSM had been publicly managed. Nevertheless, many consumers were dissatisfied with the services they received and more than 120 lawsuits were initiated against the private operator. At the beginning of 2008, the provincial government announced that it is interested in increasing its control of OSM, of which it owns 20%, buying another 20% from Saur International.  Responsibility for water supply and sanitation  = Policy and regulation = Sector policy is the responsibility of the provincial governor, assisted by the provincial Minister of Public Works and the Environment. Economic regulation is the responsibility of a regulatory agency, the Ente Provincial de Aguas y Saneamiento (EPAS), under the Ministry of Public Works and Environment. It was created in 1995 on the basis of Law 6044 of 1993. EPAS remained a weak agency and, as a technical agency with limited autonomy. It was unable to fulfill its role of regulating the concession contract which included both technical and political elements. The regulator has been highly critical of the private concession, requesting it in 2003 to be cancelled due to non-respect of the contractual agreements. = Service provision = There are three categories of service providers in the province of Mendoza: * OSM with more than 320,000 water and sewer connections * The three municipalities of Maip√∫, Luj√°n and Tupungatu with more than 100,000 water and sewer connections * 174 small operators, such as cooperatives and neighborhood associations, with more than 38,000 connections.  Financial aspects  = Tariffs = In 1998 tariffs of OSM were 30 pesos (US$30) every two months, much more than the national average of 18 pesos (US$18). The average tariff level in 2004 was 60 pesos (US$20) for water and sewerage for a period of two months, compared to only 15 pesos (US$5) in the case of Buenos Aires. Because of the massive devaluation of the Argentine peso the dollar value of tariffs decreased in this period, although the Peso value of tariffs had doubled in Mendoza. Note: Tariff data for municipalities and cooperatives are missing. = Sector finances = It is a matter of controversy whether OSM made profits from its concession. In five years OSM paid only 1 million pesos of dividends. In 2002 and 2003 OSM showed losses of 43 and 17 million pesos respectively. However, according to the regulatory agency its rate of return was 13%. Annual fees from the concession were intended to finance the construction of the Potrerillos levee on the Mendoza River, the largest hydraulic infrastructure ever built in the Province. The fees were supposed to be paid by the concessionaire to the Provincial Irrigation Department. However, due to the various problems that afflicted the concession that fee has never been paid. Until 2002 a debt of more than 4 million Pesos had been accumulated. A list of 26,000 needy users (carenciados) was established in 2003, for whom the provincial government would pay 40-75% of the water bill. However, not all those on the list were truly needy, since the establishment of the list was influenced by clientelism. Despite requests by the concessionaire, the list has never been updated until 2004. Furthermore, the provincial government has only partially met its payment obligations towards OSM on behalf of the needy users, having accumulated a debt of 13 million Pesos towards OSM by 2000. On the other hand, OSM has not paid taxes, the concession fee and fines imposed on it by the regulator for not having met its investment obligations, equivalent to 13 million Pesos as well.  Media and the water and sanitation sector  Among the province‚Äôs two main newspapers, Los Andes was highly critical of the concession and of privatization in general. The newspaper Uno was much less critical, which may be explained by the fact that its owner, Daniel Vila, was also a co-owner of OSM through Inversores del Aconcagua.Akhmouch A.

The neighborhood comprises approximately 2,300 homes. It is located between 155th and 170th Streets to the west and east respectively, and is bounded on the north by Bayside and 29th Avenues, and on the south by Northern Boulevard and Crocheron Avenue. Broadway‚ÄìFlushing is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Initially, this area was developed in 1906 by the Rickert-Finlay Realty Company, a major real estate development firm who also developed Bellcourt (1904) in Bayside, Douglas Manor (1906) and Westmoreland (1907) in Little Neck. Prior to its development as a residential area, the land north of Northern Boulevard (formerly known as Broadway) was the site of several farms and large landholdings, including the estate of Walter Bowne, the mayor of New York City during 1828‚Äì1832. House in the historic district Houses in Broadway‚ÄìFlushing reflect many classic Revival styles from the Eclectic Period, most commonly Colonial and Tudor, as well as Arts and Crafts, American Foursquare and Art Deco, on relatively large properties. In order to preserve the park-like character of the neighborhood, the developer placed restrictive covenants on the properties that ban front yard fences, front-yard garages and flat roofs among other restrictions. In 1964, the Broadway‚ÄìFlushing Homeowners Association was incorporated in New York State as a Not-For-Profit Corporation. This association of homeowners remains actively involved in the affairs of this community and has regular meetings between homeowners, business owners and government officials. The association continues to enforce the Rickert-Finlay restrictive covenants in order to protect their community from development that is not covered under New York City zoning or building ordinances. In large measure, the area is an excellent example of early to mid-20th Century development of a suburban enclave within an urban setting, or \\"rus en urbe\\" as described by urban planners of the period. As this neighborhood enters its second century, a small number of houses within the original Rickert-Finlay tract have been sold and redeveloped. Despite these changes, the neighborhood maintains its architectural integrity and a stately, suburban character. =Zoning and preservation= Since 1961, almost all of Broadway‚ÄìFlushing has been designated as residential R1-2 and R2 zoning districts. The R1-2 designation required minimum lot sizes of while the R2 designation required minimum lot sizes of . In 2005, in an effort to promote lower density development in this area, the Department of City Planning rezoned 11 blocks between Northern Boulevard/Crocheron Avenue and 35th Avenue from 156th to 167th streets in order to expand the size of the R1-2 zone in Broadway‚ÄìFlushing, thereby removing the danger of subdivision for most properties in that area. Broadway‚ÄìFlushing was designated a Historic District by the New York State Historic Preservation Office on March 18, 2006. The Broadway‚ÄìFlushing Historic District is a National and State Register historic district comprising 1,330 properties that include 1,790 contributing buildings and one contributing site, Bowne Park. It mostly consists of middle to upper middle class single family homes with a few two-family houses and several small apartment complexes and is representative of early to mid-20th century American architectural styles. Note: This includes and Accompanying 36 photographs In 2009, the NYC Department of City Planning again revised the zoning for North Flushing, including Broadway‚ÄìFlushing, and replaced the existing R1-2 and R2 zoning designations to new, lower density zoning designations, R1-2A and R2A, which are described as \\"anti-MacMansion\\" zones designed to limit the bulk, height and lot area of new development in order to better match the existing built environment. During the same time, the Landmarks Preservation Commission denied an application by the Broadway‚ÄìFlushing Homeowners Association to designate Broadway‚ÄìFlushing as a New York City landmark historic district.

The building housed these federal offices until November 1909, when a new and larger Federal Building was erected on Exchange Place (now Kennedy Plaza) nearby. Thereafter, the structure remained vacant until 1921 when the U.S. Customs office and other federal agencies needing additional space returned. The Federal Government occupied the building for the next seventy years. After the Federal Government vacated the structure in 1989, it was considered by a variety of businesses for occupation, including a restaurant, a facility for homeless persons, and offices.

DR DOS 6.0 added support for this naming variant as well in 1991. Overview Due to design of the IBM PC, DOS suffered from what was known as the 640 KB barrier. The size of this memory area, known as conventional memory, was fixed and independent of the amount of system memory actually installed. Various schemes were developed to support extra memory (see also EMS, XMS) and DOS extenders, but conventional memory was still an issue due to compatibility issues. It was a scarce resource as many applications demanded a large part of this basic memory fragment at runtime. Therefore, it was often necessary to move high some TSR programs like the mouse driver or the disk caching driver (like SMARTDRV) prior to running a memory-hungry application. This was achieved by using called with the program's name as the parameter. To load TSRs high within CONFIG.SYS, the INSTALLHIGH directive must be used instead of the command. The equivalent of for device drivers is DEVICEHIGH (usable only within CONFIG.SYS). These are also supported since DR DOS 6.0. DR DOS 5.0 and higher also support HIINSTALL and HIDEVICE, respectively.

Her feast day is celebrated on July 22.  Life  Saint Markella rocks today, Chios. Saint Markella was born and lived in Volissos, Chios, Greece. She was raised as a devout Christian by her mother. However, her father (in some accounts) was a pagan. Markella lived during the fourteenth century - during most of which Chios was under Genoese rule. At a young age, her mother died and Markella continued to study her Bible, pray to God and live a life according to what she was taught. Around the time of her eighteenth birthday, the virtuous Markella had to flee the fury of her violent father. There are variant accounts given about the reasons for that. In one version, while Markella's late mother had been a Christian, her father was an idolater and he tried very hard to force his daughter to become an idolater, too; this seems anachronistic, since by the 14th Century paganism was long since extinct in Greece. By another version, the problem was that Markella's father was consumed with incestuous lust for her, and she fled in horror when he declared his intentions.The incest version is the one given in the account by the Orthodox Church in America (Martyr Marcella of Chios) Whatever her reason for being afraid of her father, Saint Markella fled to nearby mountains and hid in a bush. Her father found her with the help of a local herdsmen, and they set fire to the bush to force her to show. Markella ran to the sea to escape but her father aimed an arrow at her and wounded her. As believed by the local people, the blood of the saint dyed the rocks and to this very day, during the festivities for her feast day, at a specific time, her blood becomes visible on these rocks for all the faithful who bear witness to this miracle. It is further believed that as she was injured, she prayed to Jesus - her final moments spent in prayer requesting that the rocks would open for her to hide from her father and this happened. However, the opened rock enabled her to hide all of her body inside, but not her head. Her father decapitated her and threw the head into the sea. Her head floated to the nearby beach of Komi. For many years, the locals could not locate the head until one day an Italian (presumably Genoese) warship was in the area. In the evening, the Italians could see a bright light coming from the distance and when they got closer they witnessed a head, floating in the water, lit by upright floating candles. Immediately, they realized that this was a sacred miracle they were witness to and they took the head of the Saint back to their homeland. Local tradition also has it that holy water springs from the rocks that mark her martyrdom. Many pilgrims visit this location and every year on 22 July, during the commemoration services for the Saint, the holy sea water in the rock pool boils during the entire Paraklisis Service; this phenomenon only occurs in the presence of a priest. If a pilgrim's faith is strong, a local tradition is that the water in the rock-pool will feel extremely warm to touch.  Religious Significance  Today there is a church on the cave of Saint Markella. The rock in which she was killed is said to spring holy water. Her nameday is on July 22 saint Markella, orthodox saints, Greece and on that day the sea is said to boil. The icon of Saint Markella is one of the most revered and is said to be miraculous.

He is best known for his book \\"Can‚Äôt Find My Way Home: America In the Great Stoned Age, 1945-2000\\" (2004) a narrative cultural history of illicit drugs, and for \\"The Drug Years\\", the series for VH1 and Sundance that Torgoff wrote and appeared in, which was based on his book. Over the span of his forty-year career, his work has encompassed music, art, film, theater, literature, politics, biography, history, race, sociology, sexuality, and celebrity culture. Background and education Torgoff was born in New York City and grew up in Glen Cove, on Long Island. He is the son of Bess Kagan and Irving Torgoff, a two time All American basketball player at LIU who later became a notable player in the NBA as the first ‚Äúsixth man‚Äù in pro basketball history when he played for Red Auerbach's Washington Capitols. Torgoff grew up playing sports before being swept up in the turbulence of the late 1960s as a teenager, becoming one of the leaders of the student strike at his high school after the shootings at Kent State in May 1970. He attended SUNY Cortland and the University of Neuchatel, Switzerland, receiving BAs in both History and French. Career =Publishing= In 1976, at the age of twenty-two, Torgoff was hired as Associate Editor of Grosset & Dunlap Publishers in New York, which brought him into the literary world. He specialized in oversized illustrated books that reflected his diverse interests like The Woody Guthrie Songbook and The Things I Love by Liberace, early examples of what would become a whole trend of ‚Äúscrapbooks‚Äù in trade publishing. =Early books= Torgoff left publishing and wrote an inside account of the decline and death of Elvis Presley titled Elvis: We Love You Tender (1980).Review of Elvis: We Love You Tender by Robert Hilburn, Los Angeles Times, January 1, 1980 Torgoff then edited an anthology and comprehensive reference work on Presley's life and work, The Complete Elvis (1981). In 1986, he published American Fool: The Roots and Improbable Rise of John ‚ÄòCougar‚Äô Mellencamp, a book-length portrait of the artist which charted his odyssey from Seymour, Indiana, through the music industry. The book was awarded the ASCAP Deems Taylor Award for excellence in music journalism. =Journalism= Torgoff's first book on Elvis brought him to the attention of artist Andy Warhol and the editors of his magazine, Interview, where Torgoff became a Contributing Editor and published numerous cover stories from 1980 to Warhol's death in 1987. =Music video era= With the advent of MTV, Torgoff's interests turned to film and television, and he began writing, directing and producing short and long-form pieces about musical and pop cultural subjects that have appeared on CBS, HBO/Cinemax, public television, and other cable channels. Many of his assignments tended to be unusual challenges, like \\"In My Time,\\" singer Teddy Pendergrass's comeback piece in the wake of the car accident that had disabled him, and Stevie Wonder's anti-apartheid piece, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Wrong‚Äù. =Elvis '56= In 1987, Torgoff wrote \\"Elvis '56,\\" an hour-long film about that single meteoric year in Presley's life. Produced by the Academy Award-winning documentarians Alan and Susan Raymond and narrated by Levon Helm, the film was nominated as Best Documentary at the USA Film Festival and acclaimed by Rolling Stone as not only the best film ever made about Elvis, but also one of the best ever produced on a rock and roll figure‚Äî‚Äúnever has it been presented with such drama and with such an awareness of the political and social character of the time‚Ä¶by focusing on Elvis‚Äôs early promise, Elvis ‚Äô56 manages to capture much of the pure shock of rock and roll when it was new.‚ÄùReview of Elvis‚Äô56 in Rolling Stone magazine, February 11, 1988 =Can't Find My Way Home= In 1992, Torgoff began a major work of non-fiction about how the use of illicit drugs shaped the entire cultural landscape of America during the post war era. The book published as Can't Find My Way Home in 2004 took twelve years and involved hundreds of interviews, journeying from the arrival of heroin to the streets of Harlem in 1947 to the Ecstasy/Rave culture of the new millennium. Duane Davis of the Rocky Mountain News compared the book to Tom Wolfe's Electric Kool Aid Acid Test and Norman Mailer's Armies of the Night.Review of Can‚Äôt Find My Way Home by Duane Davis in Rocky Mountain News, July 20, 2004 The New York Times called it ‚ÄúAn exuberant chronicle of ecstatic inebriation, delusional utopianism, wretched excess and chastened nostalgia for lost highs.‚Äù =Television= After his last book, Torgoff wrote three multi-part series that were co-productions of VH-1 and Sundance, also serving as Consulting Producer on each: The Drug Years (2006) which was based on his book, Sex: The Revolution (2008), a cultural history of the sexual revolution in America; and Lords of the Revolution. As Torgoff appeared in The Drug Years and Sex as a principal commentator and narrator, he became a recognized TV personality and expert on the pop cultural landscape of the baby boom era.Review of Lords of the Revolution in the New Yorker, August 10 & 17, 2009 Torgoff then formed Prodigious Media with Richard Lowe. Their first project was the feature-length documentary for VH-1, Planet Rock: The Story of Hip Hop and the Crack Generation (2012), which Torgoff co-wrote, produced and directed with Lowe. Narrated by Ice-T, Planet Rock was about the ascent of hip hop during the controversial crack era of 1986-1992, as told from the point of view of four individuals who at one time were all teenaged crack dealers in inner city neighborhoods‚ÄîSnoop Dog and B-Real in Los Angeles, and RZA and Raekwon of Wu-Tang Clan in New York‚Äîwho all escaped the violence and madness of the crack trade to become seminal hip hop artists. The film also fully explores the political, sociological, and racial dimensions of the story. Rolling Stone described the film as ‚Äúimpossibly thorough‚Ä¶visceral and severe, going far beyond the places where drugs and music collide‚Ä¶ a fantastic counterpoint to the sensationalistic media coverage that ran rampant under Nancy Reagan.‚ÄùCoverage of Planet Rock: The Story of Hip Hop and the Crack Generation in Rolling Stone, September 13, 2011 =Bop Apocalypse: Jazz, Race, the Beats and Drugs= Whereas Can't Find My Way Home told the story of how illicit drugs traveled from the underground to the mainstream and changed the cultural landscape of America, Torgoff's fifth book, Bop Apocalypse (Da Capo Press, 2017,) tells the story of the underground and how the use of drugs entered the DNA of American culture in the first place. The narrative connects the birth of jazz in New Orleans, the first drug laws, Louis Armstrong, Mezz Mezzrow, Harry Anslinger and the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, swing, Lester Young, Billie Holiday, the Savoy Ballroom, Reefer Madness, Charlie Parker, the birth of bebop, the coming of heroin to Harlem, and the rise of the Beat Generation. The book also examines the template of racism in the formulation of American drug laws, policy and enforcement, as well as the attitudes and policies regarding addiction. Kirkus called the book \\"A comprehensive and compassionate account of the intersections of jazz, race, and drugs in 20th- century America...A textured story of human hope and hopelessness, of artistry that blossomed in the most daunting and, in some cases, demeaning circumstances.\\" =Honors= Torgoff received the ASCAP Deems Taylor Award for his book American Fool. The Drug Years and Planet Rock both received CINE Golden Eagle awards. Planet Rock was nominated for Emmys for both Outstanding Programming Arts & Culture and Outstanding Achievement in a Craft: Writing. Personal life Torgoff is married to Laura Last, who is the Executive Liaison to Jim Tisch, Chairman and CEO of the Loews Corporation. They have one son, William, and live in Westchester.

The specific epithet madritensis refers to Madrid, Spain. It has a diploid number of 28. There are two subspecies: *Bromus madritensis subsp. madritensis: panicles less dense, stem and leaf sheath less hairy *Bromus madritensis subsp. rubens (syn. Bromus rubens) ‚Äì foxtail brome, foxtail chess, red brome: dense panicles and slightly hairy stems Description Reddish subspecies rubens habit Bromus madritensis is an winter annual grass, growing solitary or tufted, with erect or ascending culms growing high. The leaf sheaths are downy or slightly hairy. The grass lacks auricles and the glabrous ligules are long. Its flat leaf blades are either glabrous or slightly hairy, and measure long and wide. The erect and ellipsoid panicles are long and wide, with short branches that ascend and slightly spread. The branches never droop and bear one or two spikelets each. The spikelets are long, longer than the panicle branches, and bear seven to eleven florets. The spikelets vary in color from green to distinctly purplish-red. The lightly hairy glumes taper at their ends and have translucent margins. The lower glumes are one-nerved and long, and the upper glumes are three-nerved and long. The glabrous and slightly rough lemmas are long. The lemmas are hairier towards their edges and have five to seven veins. The awns are about the same length, long, and curve slightly. The anthers are long. The caryopses are as long as . The grass emerges in early winter and remains dormant until spring when heavy rainfall and higher temperatures stimulate growth. Plants flower from this period typically until May when water stress inhibits the grass. Populations grow during periods of heavy rainfall and populations can be wiped out during extended periods of drought. The grass alters soil conditions and the competition brought about by the grass both negatively affect native plant populations, and the highly flammable nature of the grass produces wildfires in North American communities where fire was previously rare. Dry florets of the weed entangle themselves in animal hair and can tear at the digestive tracts of foraging livestock. Habitat and distribution Bromus madritensis is native to southern and western Europe but has been introduced and naturalized nearly worldwide. In North America it is found primarily in the western United States, in Oregon, California, and Arizona. The grass was brought to North America in 1848 and was naturalized by the 1890s. In its native range the grass grows in cultivated fields and steppes, and in North America it grows in waste areas, road verges, and disturbed areas, in both ranges primarily on dry stony or sandy soil. In California, the weedy grass occurs in areas disturbed by wildfires. It grows from sea level to elevations of .

It tells of how the residents of a small English village collaborate when the nest of a pair of rare tawny pipits is discovered there. Plot During the Second World War, Jimmy Bancroft (Niall MacGinnis), a fighter pilot just released from hospital, and his nurse (now his girlfriend) Hazel Broome (Rosamund John) are on a walking tour through the countryside. They arrive at the (fictional) village of Lipsbury Lea and, being keen birdwatchers, discover that a pair of tawny pipits, which are rarely seen in England, are nesting nearby. Staying in the village, they enlist the locals to protect the nesting site until the eggs hatch. The villagers do so with great enthusiasm, led by the fiery retired Colonel Barton-Barrington (Bernard Miles) and the Reverend Mr. Kingsley. The field where the nest is located (known locally as the pinfold) is due to be ploughed by order of the county's War Agricultural Executive Committee (the \\"War Ag\\"), and a delegation to the Ministry of Agriculture in London fails to get the order rescinded. The minister was Barton-Barrington's \\"fag\\" at his public school, Marlborough, and personally intervenes to save the field from being ploughed. The eggs duly hatch, but not before a plot to steal them on behalf of an unscrupulous dealer is foiled by an alert army corporal (a professional ornithologist) who is serving nearby. Cast * Bernard Miles as Colonel Barton-Barrington * Rosamund John as Hazel Broome * Niall MacGinnis as Jimmy Bancroft * Jean Gillie as Nancy Forester, a \\"land girl\\" (member of the Women's Land Army) * Lucie Mannheim as Russian Soldier * Christopher Steele as Rev.

Nevertheless, Eric Hosking's footage of the pipits was actually of meadow pipits because he could not get genuine tawny pipits from German-occupied Europe. Filming location Location filming was done in Lower Slaughter in the Cotswolds. The precise whereabouts of the fictional Lipsbury Lea are not specified, but the local pub serves ales brewed in Burford, which is in Oxfordshire, close to the boundary with Gloucestershire. Propaganda value By the time the film was released (not until 1947 in the United States), the threat of invasion had subsided, but it was still seen as an effective piece of propaganda. It showed the love of the English for their country and all classes of society uniting for the common good. A subplot shows Barton-Barrington presenting his Browning Automatic Rifle to Corporal Bokolova (Lucie Mannheim), a Russian soldier on a goodwill tour, whilst giving a fiery speech about some foreigners being \\"jolly good chaps\\". Reception Rosamund John was later to say, \\"Rank didn't think they would be able to sell it to America so it was stashed away for a while. When it was shown, it was wildly popular, because it was everything the Americans thought of as being English.\\" The New York Times wrote, \\"Seldom does such a piece of unsophisticated charm and humor reach the screen, but this is one that is presented in such an utterly beguiling fashion that it would be a grave error not to see it.\\" References * External links * *Review of film at Variety Category:1944 films Category:British films Category:British World War II propaganda films Category:British black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Bernard Miles Category:Villages in Gloucestershire Category:1940s war films ","title":"Tawny Pipit (film)"},{"id":"17451949","text":"AR Homes, formerly Arthur Rutenberg Homes, is one of America's largest luxury home franchises, in business since 1953 when founder Arthur Rutenberg moved from Chicago to Florida at age 26 and started his business with one house under the brand name Rutenberg Homes.

Because these inscribed stones are shaped roughly like drums, they have been known as the Stone Drums of Qin since at least the 7th century.The name Áü≥Èºì Sh√≠g«î, the Stone Drums, is first evidenced in Lƒ≠ Xi√°n‚Äôs (ÊùéË≥¢; 651-684) commentary on the Book of the Later Han, juan 16, p.11a (cited in Mattos p.21).Gilbert L.

Their fame is because they are the oldest known stone inscriptions in China, making them a priceless treasure for epigraphers. The stone drums are now kept in the Palace Museum, Beijing. They vary in height from 73 cm to 87.5 cm (with one which was at one point used as a mortar reduced by the grinding to 58 cm), and from 56 to 80.1 cm in diameter. The Stone Drums weigh about 400 kg. each. Inscriptions The ancient inscriptions on them are arranged in accordance with each stone's size and proportions, the largest stone bearing fifteen lines of five characters each, and a smaller one with nine lines of eight graphs each, neatly arranged as if in a grid. The contents are generally four- character rhymed verse in the style of the poems of the Classic of Poetry, a few lines of which they even paraphrase. The contents generally commemorate royal hunting and fishing activities. Originally thought to bear about 700 characters in all, the Stone Drums were already damaged by the time they are mentioned in the Tang dynasty (618-907 CE) poetry of Du Fu.Du Fu wrote: \\"...Èô≥ÂÄâÁü≥ÈºìÂèàÂ∑≤Ë®õ...\\"‚Äú(\\"the Stone Drums of Ch√©n CƒÅng were already corrupted\\"). The drums had only 501 graphs by the Song dynasty (960-1279 CE), when the best rubbings now surviving were made (Mattos, p. 57\\\\. Cf. Guo Zhongshu). They have been further damaged through rough handling and repeated rubbings in the years since, and one was even converted into a mortar, destroying a third of it. A mere 272 characters are visible on the stones today. In the best rubbing, only 470 of the 501 characters are legible, or about 68% (Mattos p. 122); after omitting repeated graphs, this leaves us with a treasury of 265 different graphs, 49 of which are known from no other source (excluding recognizable variants). Even among recognizable graphs, scores of them are used in ways unattested elsewhere, leading to great difficulty and disagreement in their interpretation, a situation common to Zhou dynasty inscriptions (Mattos p. 122). Discovery The Stone Drums are mentioned in the 7th century, and may have been found within the preceding century. There exists no record of their actual discovery, so the date and location thereof are unsettled, and are a matter of extensive scholarly controversy. Wagner (1990) speculates that the original location of the drums‚Äô discovery may have been the Qin royal tombs or an associated ritual complex in Fengxiang County, Shaanxi Province, but also mentions another potentially relevant location: a mountain named Sh√≠g«îshƒÅn (Áü≥ÈºìÂ±±), or Stone Drum Mt., in Ch√©ncƒÅng (Èô≥ÂÄâ), about 25 km. SW of Yong (Tianxing), the Q√≠n capital from 677 to 383 BCE. Yong‚Äôs city walls have been found in Fengxiang, and the Q√≠n royal tombs lie about 11 km. to the south.Wagner, Donald B.

Dating Like their discovery, the details of their origin have also long been subject to debate. While most now agree that they were made at the behest of a Duke of the state of Qin, the century of their creation is still uncertain; Mattos (1988) tentatively places them in the 5th century BCE.

Currently he is the Chief Technology Officer at Ceranovo, Inc. He was the Chief Graphics Product Architect and Senior Fellow at AMD from September 2012 until June 2013, and he previously held the positions of Architect of Intel Labs-SC, CEO of Massively Parallel Technologies, Inc. and CTO at ClearSpeed Technology. Gustafson holds applied mathematics degrees from the California Institute of Technology and Iowa State University. Childhood and education Gustafson was raised in Des Moines, Iowa. After completing a degree in Applied Mathematics at California Institute of Technology in 1977 he moved to Ames, Iowa and completed his M.S. (1981) and Ph.D. (1982) at Iowa State University. His mother was an electronics technician at Collins Radio and his father was a chemical engineer turned MD, both as a result of World War II. His parents encouraged his scientific explorations at a young age. Assembling radio transmitters, designing and executing chemistry experiments, and making holograms are some of his favorite childhood explorations. Unums Gustafson has devised a new format for storing real numbers in computers use a variable number of bits depending on the number of digits required, called unum number format. Normal formats store numbers as a fixed number of bits, for example 64 bits is usual for double-precision floating-point format numbers. This can allow them to be smaller than doubles for fast processing and also more precise or larger than the limits for double when desirable. Awards and honors In 1988, Gustafson was the recipient of the inaugural Gordon Bell Prize. He has received other awards for his work in HPC, including the International Atanasoff Award (2006). He was awarded the IEEE Computer Society Golden Core Award in 2007.

Springform refers to the construction style of this pan. The base and the sides are separate pieces that are held together when the base is aligned with a groove that rings the bottom of the walls. The pan is then secured by a latch on the exterior of the wall. This tightens the 'belt' that becomes the walls of the pan and secures the base into the groove at the base of the walls. Design The most common springform pan is the nine-inch round. However, small circular pans are common along with squares, rectangles, and hearts. They come in a variety of materials including anodized aluminum, heavy-gauge steel, and glass. Optional features include a non-stick surface and a waterproofing seal around the base. This pan is used to bake dishes that cannot be easily inverted for removal from the pan. Some of the most common recipes to call for springform pans are cheesecakes and tortes. The easy removal of the sides from a springform pan lends itself to dishes with delicate bottom layers such as the graham cracker crumb crusts commonly constructed for cheesecakes. Springform pans, however, are also used in the preparation of pizzas, quiches, and frozen desserts. Although most cheesecakes are baked in a water bath, this does not mean that springform pans are waterproof around the base. Many may be waterproof initially. However, as the latch loosens and the coating wears off this waterproof feature will fade. For this reason many will wrap the pan in aluminum foil. There are many types and finishes of springform pans. While the most common bottom is smooth, bottoms can also be waffled or glass.

Acroyoga (also written Acro-Yoga or Acro Yoga) is a physical practice which combines yoga and acrobatics. Acroyoga includes many types of (mostly recreational) partner and group acrobatics in which at least someone is lifted. As such it also draws on traditions of circus arts, cheer-leading, and dance acro. Acroyoga is more vigorous than many traditional forms of yoga as exercise, and may lead to more injuries.  Roles  There are three primary roles in an Acroyoga practice: base, flyer, and spotter. * Base - this is the individual who has the most points of contact with the ground. Often this person is lying on the ground with the entire back torso in full contact. This enables both the arms and legs to be \\"bone-stacked\\" for maximum stability and support of the Flyer. Main points of contact with the flyer are the feet (generally placed on the Flyer's hips, groin or lower abdomen) and the hands (which either form handholds or grasp the shoulders). * Flyer - this is the individual who is elevated off the ground by the Base. The Flyer can move into a series of dynamic positions, and generally lets gravity do the work for them. A Flyer needs balance, confidence, and core strength. * Spotter - this is the individual who has an objective view of the partners, and whose entire focus is on making sure that the Flyer lands safely in case of any slips. The spotter can also make recommendations to the Base and Flyer to improve their form. Elements Acro Yoga static Inverted Dancer pose People practicing acroyoga in a Japanese park. = Acrobatics = is the physical part of Acroyoga that uses gymnastics techniques to build strength, flexibility, trust and teamwork between partners. In the Acrobatic element we have:  Static poses  Initially basic poses such as bird, throne and whale. When the partners hold the position using equilibrium which is a state of rest or balance due to the equal action of opposing forces.  Acrobatic flying  Focus on movement - first, the flyer and base learn a static pose, later, how to move from one pose to another, creating a movement that is called \\"transition\\" in between the two poses. In the acrobatic flying, there is a sequence of movements that start and end in the same position, which is called washing machine. There are many different washing machines. These basics washing machines that are taught are: barrel roll and ninja star. = Pops = Small jumps where the partners keep physical contact with each other, usually keeping their hands connected. = Icarian Pops = Movements in which the flyer is thrown (and or jumps / kips) off of the base leaving no points of contact and then is typically caught once more. = Yoga = Reflects the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines of yoga, in particular modern yoga as exercise. = Therapeutics = Acro Yoga therapeutic flying ‚Äì this pose is called Super Yogi.At AcroYoga Inc this includes Thai massage, therapeutic flying and partner yoga. A basic therapeutic pose is Folded Leaf in which one partner is inverted and supported on the vertical legs of the other partner whose hands are then free for back massage.  Therapeutic flying The flyer relaxes the body and is guided by the base through some stretches and massage. To help the flyer to relax, it is crucial to develop trust first, which can be done by practicing the acrobatic flying. Also, it is important that the base has a strong sense of responsibility, care and trust in all the movements that will execute, before start to heal flyers using therapeutic flying techniques. It can use techniques from different types of massage, having as a result, a deep level of relaxation. Learning AcroYoga Acro Yoga meeting in a public park in Austin, Texas. Learning Acroyoga requires strength training, flexibility training and technique training.Nemer, Jason and Sauer-Klein, Jenny. AcroYoga Flight Manual, 2008, acroyoga.org Strength training is accomplished through repetition of exercises like push-ups, hand walking and handstands. Flexibility training is best done at the end of a session with a partner. Learning good Acroyoga technique takes time and effort and is best learned with an expert teacher. One important Acroyoga technique is called bone stacking. This involves the base partner keeping arms and legs straight to maximize the weight load on bones rather than muscles to support the flyer. A typical Acro Yoga session may include: * Circle ceremony promotes communication and openness * Warm-up to gradually get your muscles ready for more strenuous exercise * Partner flow - continue warming up with asanas and stretching with a partner * Inversions help build trust between the partners * Flying and acrobatics Some communities have regular Acro Yoga meetings to provide a place for interested people to come together and practice for free, called jams. There are also larger Acro Yoga events such as the Dutch Acrobatics Convention, Acro SF, Vancouver Acro Festival, to name a few, that draw a global audience of practitioners. All over the world, there are instructors teaching Acro Yoga in regular classes and workshops. You can learn Acroyoga by yourself, but it takes time, discipline and responsibility, as you may not know all the techniques that will make the practice safe, for yourself and others.  Poses  There are many static acro yoga poses. A series of acro yoga poses that are repeated in a continuous flow is called a Washing Machine.

He was appointed to that post in about 494 BC by Hippocrates of Gela. The Zanclaeans had contacted Ionian leaders to invite colonists to join them in founding a new city on the Kale Acte (), or north shore of Sicily. This offer had been accepted by a large number of Samians, together with some exiles from Miletus. But when the colonists arrived at Locri, Scythes and the Zanclaeans were engaged in hostilities against the Sicels. Meanwhile, the Samians were persuaded by Anaxilas of Rhegium to take advantage of Scythes' absence, and occupy the city of Zancle itself. In response, Scythes asked for the assistance of his ally, Hippocrates, tyrant of Gela. However, Hippocrates proved to be just as untrustworthy as the Samians. On his arrival, he placed Scythes and his brother, Pythogenes, in chains and sent them as prisoners to Inycum. He then betrayed his allies the Zanclaeans so that they fell into the hands of the Samians. Scythes, however, was able to escape from Inycum and made his way to Himera. Once there he was able make his way to the court of Darius, king of Persia, where he was received with much distinction and rose to a high place in the king's favour. Some time afterwards, Scythes was able to visit his native city, but again had to return to the Persian court, where he died at an advanced age, and in the possession of great wealth, while he enjoyed general esteem for the probity of his character.Herodotus, vi. 23, 24Claudius Aelianus, Varia Historia viii. 17 Herodotus designates Anaxilas and Hippocrates as tyrants () of their respective cities, but he styles Scythes as king () or monarch () of the Zanclaeans.

The name of the village is sometimes hyphenated to Coton- Clanford, appearing this way on some cottage names locally. The population for this village as taken at the 2011 census can be found under Seighford. It lies midway between the B5405 road, 1¬Ω miles to the north and the A518 1¬Ω miles to the south. The village has no shops, public houses or church, comprising only a few scattered houses and cottages, several dairy farms and a long disused 19th century chapel. Clanford Methodist Chapel, May 2008 Clanford Hall, May 2008 This Primitive Methodist chapel was built in 1884, the foundation stone being laid 30 October 1884. The Chapel records 1891‚Äì1907, Coton Clanford Society and Methodist chapel minute books, 1903-1929, are stored at Stafford Record Office. Judging from the very modest dimensions of this small building it is hard to imagine it having the capacity for a congregation of more than 30 worshippers. The village straddles Clanford Brook, which meanders southeastwards from Ranton towards Little Aston and Doxey and is bounded to the north by the southeastern edge of Seighford airfield and several large woods. In this village the English philosopher and cleric, William Wollaston, was born in 1659. Clanford Hall Located here also is Clanford Hall, a three-storey, half-timbered Tudor mansion in fine condition now used as a farmhouse. The building, dated 1684, is listed Grade II* and is a good example of 17th century vernacular architecture of the area. It is timber framed with a tiled roof and brick stacks, with two storeys and an attic, and four- storeyed on the East. It is restored in brick and colour-washed, with wood finials to gables and ornamental timbering at front and restored timbering at rear. There are casements and wood mullioned windows with modern leaded lights.

Career Adams joined Celtic near the end of 1902, from Junior side Dunipace, and made his first appearance in September 1903 in a 1-0 win over Hibernian at Celtic Park. He went on to play 291 league and cup games for Celtic in a nine-year spell at the club, and was the last goalkeeper at the club to wear green-and-white hoops in games - after a rule change in 1910 he wore a yellow jersey. Adams was a virtual ever-present in what is regarded as the first truly great Celtic side that won six consecutive Scottish League titles from 1904-05 to 1909-10. At the start of the 1906-07 season, Adams cut his hand during a benefit match at Ibrox Stadium. The mishap was caused by a nail which had been inserted through a goal-post for a five-a-side tournament. This incident precipitated the first known transfer between the two Old Firm clubs: Rangers' reserve goalkeeper Tom Sinclair was loaned to Celtic to cover for Adams's injury, and went on to pick up a Glasgow Cup winner's medal with the Parkhead club.

Count Alexander Orbeliani (Jambakur-Orbeliani) () (May 24, 1802 ‚Äì December 28, 1869) was a Georgian Romanticist poet, playwright, journalist and historian, of the noble House of Orbeliani. Alexander Orbeliani was born in Tiflis (Tbilisi), then under Imperial Russian rule, to Prince Vakhtang Orbeliani and Princess Tekle, a beloved daughter of the penultimate Georgian king Erekle II. In 1817, he joined the Russian military service. However, together with his mother and his brother Vakhtang, he led a failed coup attempt against Russian rule in 1832. The conspirators planned to invite the Russian officials in the Caucasus to a grand ball where they would be given the choice of death or surrender. After the collapse of this plot, Orbeliani was arrested and exiled to Orenburg whence he would not be able to return until 1840. The abortive uprising and relatively mild punishment that followed forced many conspirators to see the independent past as irremediably lost and to reconcile themselves with the Russian autocracy, transforming their laments for the lost past and the fall of the native dynasty into Romanticist poetry. Orbeliani's most coherent pieces are the allegorical poem of 1832, The Moon (·Éõ·Éó·Éù·Éï·Éê·É†·Éî), and a patriotic short story Immaculate Blood (·É£·Éõ·Éê·Éú·Éô·Éù ·É°·Éò·É°·ÉÆ·Éö·Éò) about three sisters, nuns, who prefer death to apostasy when the commander of invading Persian troops demands it; the latter is so impressed that he has to die with them. Orbeliani also attempted a series of plays, but his interest in the press was more important. He was a founding member of the editorial board of Tsiskari, which for several years was the backbone of the Georgian periodical press. Through it Orbeliani channeled his efforts to standardize a literary language, based on revival of archaic forms. He was also one of the first Georgian writers to take an interest in retrieving folk poetry from the people, and authored several works on Georgian history and culture.Rayfield, Donald (2000), The Literature of Georgia: A History, pp. 142-3.

Built in 1913, Bolton Hall was originally used as a community center for the utopian community of Los Terrenitos. From 1920 until 1957, it was used as an American Legion hall, the San Fernando Valley's second public library, Tujunga City Hall, and a jail. In 1957, the building was closed. For more than 20 years, Bolton Hall remained vacant and was the subject of debates over demolition and restoration. Since 1980, the building has been operated by the Little Landers Historical Society as a local history museum. Los Terrenitos In the early 1900s, the area now known as Tujunga was undeveloped land, the former Rancho Tujunga. In 1913, William Ellsworth Smythe, working alongside M.V. Hartranft (they had purchased the land together), formed a utopian community called Los Terrenitos ‚Äî Spanish for The Little Lands. Smythe was the leader of the Utopian Little Landers movement and had already established colonies in Idaho and San Ysidro, California. He advocated the principle that families settling on an acre or two of land could support themselves and create a flourishing community. Town lots in Tujunga were sold to settlers at $800 for an acre of land and a life of independence.Patricia Ward Biederman, \\"Tujunga's Pioneer Women Lived on the Rocks,\\" Los Angeles Times, April 9, 1999 Bolton Hall was built in 1913 by George Harris, a self-described \\"nature builder\\", rock mason, and stone sculptor. He first named it \\"Bolton Hall Hall\\", after Bolton Hall (1854‚Äì1938), a New York City progressive activist and proponent of the back-to-the-land movement.Marlene A. Hitt, Sunland and Tujunga: From Village to City, Arcadia Publishing (2002). . Harris urged that the hall be built solely of native materials and selected a design that he said borrowed nothing from European architecture. Harris and the Terrenitos community built the hall using granite chunks and stones from nearby fields and hillsides and from the Tujunga Wash. Stones were placed in position in the structure based on the positions in which they settled after falling from a cliff. The spacious main room has shiny hardwood floors and a massive rock fireplace in the center. The fireplace is spanned by a mantel fashioned from a single eucalyptus tree. Beneath the mantel, Harris inscribed the words \\"To the Spiritual Life of Soil\\". The structure was built at a cost of $6,480. When Bolton Hall opened in August 1913, the Los Angeles Times reported that it marked the \\"awakening of the Vale of Monte Vista\\" (the former name of Sunland): > First settled nearly thirty years ago, the valley has shown more life in the > past six months than in all its previous history. Los Terrenitos, the > settlement of \\"'little-landers,\\" has made wonderful progress since its > inception, five months ago, about 200 families having purchased land, not > all of whom are yet on the ground. But enough are here to make it a beehive > of industry. The dedication of \\"Bolton Hall\\" last Saturday aroused much > enthusiasm among the \\"little-landers.\\"\\"Monte Vista Awakens,\\" Los Angeles > Times, August 24, 1913, page V-16 The Times also reported that Bolton Hall was \\"built to stand for ages\\", and it has survived the 1971 Sylmar and 1994 Northridge earthquakes without a scratch. During the hall's early years, it hosted community meetings patterned after those held in old New England town halls. Over the next decade, it was used for church services, musical performances, lectures, motion picture shows, the Women's Club, dances, and pot-luck suppers. It also was the site of the San Fernando Valley's second public library. City Hall After World War I, the hall was used as an American Legion hall for several years. In 1925, Tujunga incorporated as a city, and Bolton Hall became Tujunga City Hall. In 1932, Tujunga was consolidated with the City of Los Angeles, and the building was used for the next 25 years for a variety of municipal services, including the San Fernando Valley's second public library and a jail. However, it remained known as Tujunga City Hall until its closure in 1957. Vacancy and preservation efforts With its closure in 1957, Bolton Hall was put up for sale. However, the city estimated it would take more than $42,000 to bring the building up to code, and two attempts to auction the site failed to draw any bids. When the city announced in 1959 that it intended to tear down the old building and convert the property into a neighborhood park, the Little Landers Historical Society of Sunland and Tujunga was formed to fight for the preservation of Bolton Hall. The group watered the trees during the summer and collected more than 400 signatures on petitions seeking to preserve the structure. The group brought in a representative of the National Trust, and the building was found to have historical value. However, the group had difficulty coming up with funding to maintain the structure and bring it up to current safety standards. Bolton Hall's future remained uncertain, and the property vacant, for more than twenty years as the \\"Save Bolton Hall\\" movement continued to have difficulty raising funds. Historical museum In 1976, an agreement was reached to have the City of Los Angeles renovate the building's exterior with the Little Landers Historical Society committing to renovate the interior for operation as a historical museum.\\"Love for the Past Rescues Tujunga's Old City Hall,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 12, 1976, Glendale- Burbank section, page 1 At the time, the building had been kept \\"tightly sealed\\" since 1957. However, by 1979, funding was still lacking, and the Times reported that \\"the vacant old building houses only cobwebs and dust.\\" In late 1979, Los Angeles City Councilman Bob Ronka secured $169,000 in federal funds to augment $23,800 raised by the Little Landers Historical Society. With nearly $200,000 in public and private funds, the building was finally restored after it had sat vacant for more than 20 years. The Bolton Hall Historical Museum opened in 1980. The artifacts displayed at the museum include the gavel used by the presiding officer during early town meetings, building tools used in the construction of Bolton Hall, old photographs, and the old clock from the first Tujunga Post Office. The museum also has a congratulatory letter from Bolton Hall, the New York lawyer and writer for whom the building was named. Near the front entrance of the museum, there is a tobacco-stained stone that juts out from the wall; it was used by early colonists to clean out their pipes when the building was used as a church. The museum is open to the public every Sunday and Tuesday from 1:00 to 4:00 p.m. Admission is free.

He made his Celtic debut in the 2‚Äì1 away league win over Dundee on 10 August 1895 and won a League championship badge plus the Glasgow Cup in his maiden campaign. Late in the 1895‚Äì96 season, after Celtic had won the championship, he left on loan for English club Liverpool, where he played in two league fixtures and three 'test' matches (effectively promotion/relegation playoffs) for them.Players  Barney Battles, LFC History Back at Celtic, he was suspended by the club in November 1896 and did not feature again during 1896‚Äì97, after he ‚Äì plus Peter Meechan and John Divers ‚Äì refused to take the field for a game due to being insulted by the presence of a journalist who had been highly critical of the team in their previous match (a loss to Rangers in the Glasgow Cup final).Uniquely Celtic - The Soul and the Spirit (Chapter: \\"John the First\\"), Frank Rafter; Grosvenor House Publishing, 2015; Battles joined Dundee in May 1897, then played another League match for Liverpool in March 1898. He rejoined Celtic the following October, shortly after John Divers also returned; despite the pair's past indiscretion, the team's results had noticeably worsened in their absence. He remained in Glasgow for the next six years, with no further League titles but four consecutive appearances in Scottish Cup Finals, winning the first two in 1899 and 1900, and losing the others in 1901 (to former employers Hearts) and 1902.Celtic player Battles, Bernard, FitbaStats =International= He impressed Scottish selectors with his consistent performances and in 1901 he started all three Home International matches, his only full caps. Battles had already played for the Scottish League XI in 1899 and was selected again in 1902, and also turned out for the Glasgow Association against Sheffield in the same year. =Death= After leaving Celtic he subsequently moved to KilmarnockKilmarnock player Battles, ?, FitbaStats before his death from pneumonia on 9 February 1905, at the age of 30, two weeks after falling ill following a match on 21 January. A reported 40,000 people lined the route to Dalbeth cemetery in Glasgow's East End on the day of Battles' funeral. The monies taken from the stand at the 1905 Scotland v Ireland match at Celtic Park were donated by host club Celtic to the grieving Battles family in tribute to their former player. Battles died before the birth of his son, Barney Battles Jr., who was named in his memory and would also go on to be a Scottish international, playing as a forward.

It is intended to demonstrate new air cargo-carrier capabilities using advanced composite material. A project of the United States Air Force's Air Force Research Laboratory, it was built by the international aerospace company Lockheed Martin, at its Advanced Development Programs (Skunk Works) facility in Palmdale, California. Design and development The X-55 is a one-off aircraft intended to demonstrate the use of advanced composite materials in the fuselage of an otherwise conventional high-wing transport aircraft. There are no plans to place the X-55 into production. Lockheed Martin's design for Advanced Composite Cargo Aircraft (ACCA) was chosen over Aurora Flight Sciences' design based on the Antonov An-72 in 2007. The aircraft is powered by 2 Pratt & Whitney PW306B turbofans. The X-55 design is based on the existing Fairchild Dornier 328JET. The fuselage of that aircraft, which is constructed of aluminium alloys, was replaced aft of the entrance door with a newly designed fuselage. The new design makes extensive use of advanced composite materials, selected to allow out-of-autoclave (industrial) curing at lower temperatures and pressures than previous materials. The new widened fuselage allows the loading of cargo through a rear ramp. The new fuselage section is constructed as a single large component, including the vertical stabilizer. When attached to the existing nose section, the fuselage is 55 feet (16.8 m) long and 9 feet (2.74 m) diameter. The fuselage has upper and lower halves, each with a roughly-oval shape similar to a canoe. The halves are bonded to circular frames. The fuselage section ahead of the entrance door consists of the existing (metal) 328J component, with fasteners used to bring the forward and new aft sections together. As of April 2008, the fuselage was being fabricated. The first flight of the modified aircraft was expected during the winter of 2008/2009. However, due to a \\"glitch\\" during fabricating the composite fuselage, that schedule slipped.\\"Taking Shape\\". Aviation Week & Space Technology, 70, 10 (9 March 2009), p. 32. The delay was caused by an unsatisfactory bond of the skin on the lower fuselage, which required a second fuselage to be fabricated. The first flight was completed at Lockheed Martin's Advanced Development Programs facility (Air Force Plant 42) in Palmdale, California on June 2, 2009 by the Air Force Research Laboratory in conjunction with Lockheed Martin. In October 2009, the ACCA demonstrator was designated X-55A by the USAF. Over the course of the program, 15 to 20 flights were expected. Furthermore, it was estimated that the vehicle was built for half the cost of a conventional design for a similar aircraft.

While one was tracked down and killed by Israeli security forces before he could carry out an attack, another one managed to infiltrate an IDF base, killing six Israeli soldiers and wounding eight others before being shot dead. Background In 1987, Israel was occupying a security zone in Southern Lebanon. One of the organizations fighting Israel there was Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command (PFLP-GC), a Damascus-based Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) splinter group, which had been operating in Lebanon since late 1960s, launching attacks on north Israel. The fence along the border made it difficult to cross into Israel. In March 1981, a similar attempt was made when an intruder, using a motorized hang glider reached Haifa Bay and tossed some bombs, but was forced to land after running out of fuel and was arrested. The attack An Israeli soldier inspecting one of the gliders On the night of 25 November 1987, two PFLP-GC militants, Khaled Akar and Melod Najah, took off from Southern Lebanon, perhaps from a Syrian controlled area, each armed with an AK-47 assault rifle, a pistol with a silencer, and several hand grenades. Their gliders were each powered by lawn mower-size engine and a small propeller. The engine noises were heard by several soldiers, and at 10:30 PM the Israeli Northern Command was alerted to the danger of an infiltration. An alarm was sounded, flares were fired and helicopters were sent out to search for the gliders, but without success, as the gliders were flying as low as tree level. However, at the Gibor army camp,Ironically, \\"◊í◊ô◊ë◊ï◊®\\", Gibor, is the Hebrew word for a Hero. The army camp is named after a near-by factory originally named Gibor. about two miles east of Kiryat Shmona, no security precautions had been taken thirty minutes after the alarm was issued and no additional guards had been posted at the camp's gate. It was later discovered that an early intelligence warning was neglected by all except Kibbutz Ma'ayan Baruch, due to lack of attention. Akar's glider landed in the security zone as a result of being blinded by the searchlights from Kibbutz Ma'ayan Baruch, and he was tracked down and killed by Israeli troops. The second landed near the Gibor camp. Najah spotted a passing army truck outside the base and opened fire on it, killing the officer driving it and wounding a female soldier riding with him.Night of the Gliders (Hebrew) short summary at the Israeli Defence Forces site. He then headed towards a nearby army encampment manned by Nahal Brigade soldiers some 175 meters away. He hurled grenades and sprayed automatic fire at the sentry, who panicked and ran away, allowing him free entry into the encampment. He then fired his AK-47 and threw grenades into tents being used by Israeli soldiers, killing five and wounding seven, but was then shot and killed by an Israeli soldier (the battalion cook) who had been wounded. Aftermath =Israeli reactions= A monument near Kiryat Shmona commemorating the victims of the attack. The IDF was heavily criticized by the Israeli press. The headline of Maariv read \\"Foul-Up in the North - A Blow to the Army\\". The press also called for an investigation as to how the infiltration was possible. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir blamed Syria for the attack, saying \\"It is clear that they could not have done it without the patronage and the help of the Syrians\\", and stated that Israel held Syria responsible. Deputy Chief of Staff (Ramatkal) Ehud Barak vowed that the PFLP-GC \\"will in due time pay the price\\". Speaking before the Knesset on 30 November, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin sent his condolences to the families of the casualties. He assured the residents of the Galilee that the IDF will do the best they can to prevent similar raids. However, he admitted that \\"all the steps required by orders and procedures were not taken in this camp, which led to the grave consequences.\\" At first, the only soldier indicted was the sentry, who was sentenced to a six months imprisonment. Only following public pressure did Chief of Staff Dan Shomron decide to take further proceedings and transfer the brigade operations officer from his position. This gave birth to the phrase \\"The sentry syndrome\\" (Tismonet HaShin-Gimel), meaning that a system is trying to shake off responsibility for a failure by putting all the blame on the lowest possible rank. A monument commemorating the casualties of the incident was raised near Kiryat Shmona. =Palestinian reactions= The PFLP-GC assumed responsibility for the attack, which was seen as a morale boost. On 3 December, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat praised the attack, saying \\"The attack demonstrated that there could be no barriers or obstacles to prevent a guerrilla who has decided to become a martyr.\\" Palestinian newspapers in the West Bank placed the story on their front headlines and in colored ink, but were prevented from printing anything but the barest details of the incident by the Israeli Military Censor. Palestinians began taunting Israeli troops, crying \\"six to one\\", and the writing \\"6:1\\" appeared on walls in Gaza. On 9 December, riots broke in the Gaza Strip, marking the beginning of the First Intifada. The incident is often seen as a catalyst for the riots.

The suspense novel won the 1983 Edgar Award for Best First Mystery Novel (American). The work has been reprinted several times, and was followed by two more \\"Butcher's Boy\\" novels in the series, Sleeping Dogs (1992) https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3D91F39F934A35756C0A964958260 and The Informant (2011).http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/thomas- perry/informant/#review Plot The Butcher's Boy, not to be confused with Michael Robb's \\"The Butcher's Boy - The Ballad of Billy Badass,\\" features professional hitman Michael Schaeffer as its protagonist. Murder is a craft for the \\"Butcher's Boy,\\" a reference to his foster father, \\"Eddie the Butcher,\\" who raised him to follow in both of his two trades: the cold-blooded killer with a gimlet eye, and an actual butcher for a cover life. When Eddie dies an unnatural death, his adoptive son continues in his footsteps, but leaves the butcher shop behind. After dispatching an innocent union employee and a U.S. Senator, he arrives in Las Vegas, Nevada to pick up his fee. Instead of a payoff he finds himself on the wrong end of a murder contract. His reputation as a non pareil professional killer has always ensured he would be paid, even by men who think no more about murder than scratching an itch, men who nonetheless would not risk creating such an adept enemy. The story brings that scenario to life as the Butcher's Boy seeks to collect the debt by terrorizing the Mafia‚Äîlifelong source of his freelance jobs and current nemesis‚Äîinto backing off. Meanwhile, the initial hits completed by \\"The Butcher's Boy\\" have attracted the attention of U.S. government specialists on organized crime. Elizabeth Waring, a bright young, unmarried analyst in the Justice Department, begins to see a pattern in the killings. As the violence escalates around the United States, her colleagues and superiors suspect internecine warfare among the bad guys, though Waring deduces the fact that one man on a mission may be the key. As she works her way closer to his identity, she and the reader come to admire his audacity and remorseless, creative efficiency in staying one step ahead of the Mob's death sentence. The point of view switches back and forth between Waring and the killer, whom readers come to root for as the ultimate David to the Goliath of organized crime. Readers are drawn into rooting for the Butcher's Boy to succeed in evading both his Mafia pursuers and the government agents. And indeed he does, only to find himself in similar circumstances one, and then two, decades later in Sleeping Dogs and The Informant, where both he and Waring have also aged historically, and share the knowledge and context of the earlier stories. Together the trilogy makes for a brilliant virtuoso fugue on the concepts of predator/prey, the affinity between detectives and killers, and the greater morality of what a true survivalist might be like, at the top of his game. Perry has gone on to a prize-filled career as a consummate crime writer with a score of eclectic novels, another irresistible, unique protagonist named Jane Whitefield, and the reputation as a \\"capo di tutti capi\\" of crime writers. Fans hope he will still be interested in writing a fourth installment around 2020 (when Michael Schaeffer will be in his 60s, and Elizabeth Waring's kids will be out of college) if not sooner.

He then went up to Exeter College, Oxford where he won blues for football in 1879, 1880 and 1881. =Football career= Wilson was called into the England team for their first ever meeting with Wales. The match was played at the Kennington Oval on 18 January 1879 in a blizzard. Due to the atrocious snowfall both captains agreed to play halves of only 30 minutes each. The poor attendance (reports range from 85 to 300) was also attributed to the weather. Some sources suggest that William Clegg turned up 20 minutes late for the game. Clegg, a solicitor, was working late on a case (the trial of Charles Peace, the Banner Cross murderer) and was unable to leave Sheffield for London on the Friday night. The next morning, the southbound train with Clegg on it, was delayed by heavy snow.

Loosely based on the Monster Hunter series of video games by Capcom, Monster Hunter Orage premiered in Kodansha's Sh≈çnen Rival in April 2008. Plot The story takes place in a fictional world full of monsters and adventurers called Monster Hunters, who, as their name implies, hunt the monsters. The plot revolves around a young Monster Hunter, Shiki, who was taken in as an apprentice to a Monster Hunter named Greylee as a child. A few years after Greylee's death, which was due to a gunpowder incident, he returns to his master's residence, Akamaaya Town, to join the guild there. In that guild, he meets a girl called Ailee and after a series of events, he finds that she is the daughter of his master. From this point onwards, they form a party to find the legendary Myo Galuna, which was Greylee's lifelong ambition. Characters ; :Shiki is the main protagonist of the story. He is very cheerful and always puts his friends' well-being before his own. He has the 'Mark of the Forbidden/Sealed Hunter' which he presumably received from Greylee. This seal allows him access to all hunting grounds. Even after his master's death, he often talks to him as if speaking to his spirit, and it is evident that he truly cared for and respected his master. His dream is to hunt down the legendary Myo Galuna. He wields the twin wind swords Sou Kaze Ha / Sou Fuu Jin (Arashi) which are said to be made from the materials of Myo Galuna. He also has a pact with the ancient steel dragon Kushala that they would fight. This was made when Greylee had just met him. ; :Ailee is the female protagonist of the story and daughter of Greylee Jescar. She forms a party with Shiki to find the legendary Myo Galuna. She thinks that she does not need any friends because of what happened to her and a group of her \\"friends\\", who are illegally hunting monsters before the beginning of the series. As a result, she confesses to the authorities and suffers punishment as well, since they are comrades. Part of her punishment is a lifetime ban from taking the Forbidden Hunter exam. Later, a man named Gordon, from the Guild's poaching counter-measure department, tests Ailee by asking Shiki and Sakya to help him with illegal selling. Ailee slapped him and told him not to involve her partners in a crime. He later reports to the guild, and says that he has no objection with Ailee traveling with those forbidden hunters. She wields the long sword Iron Katana Gospel then Sakya improved it to The \\"Eager Cleaver\\" then later on to \\"The Devil Slicer\\" and her armor is said to be made from materials from Derumaiosu. ; :Sakya is the daughter to a blacksmith that crossed paths with Ailee's father long ago and just like Ailee she too lost her father at a young age. She thought that he had left her and her mother to live in some big city away from their swamp home, but he had been crystallized by a derumaisou that had plagued their home for a long time. Shiki and Ailee helped Sakya kill the derumaisou and afterwards she built Shiki and Ailee their new weapons \\"Arashi\\" and \\"Eager Cleaver\\" and joined them in their quest to find the Myo Galuna while also pursuing her father's dream of building the best weapon that could be built. She wields a light bowgun, the Beltines. She is uncomfortable with any exposure of her body. She develops apparent feelings for Shiki. ; :Graylee is Shiki's master and father to Ailee. Years before the events of the series, he apparently dies due to a suspected incident with gunpowder, but has been hinted to not actually be the case. His life-long ambition is to hunt the legendary Myo Galuna. He had a 'Mark of the Sealed Hunter' and is said to be able to equip most weapons. His main weapon of choice is, however, the Great Sword Tsukai Teda. ; :His weapon is Gunlance of the 'Guild Knight Series', and he is the leader of the Hunter group Hell Hounds. His nickname is 'The Prince' and he frequently gets his grammar and use of words wrong. He does not like Shiki and considers him a rival, and he also thinks Shiki took away the woman he loves, which is Ailee (although it is only one-sided love). As such, he wishes to become a Forbidden Hunter. He allies with Shadow in order to do so. In chapter 9, he finally became a forbidden hunter. He uses a Steel Gunlance as his weapon of choice. ; :Shadow possesses an unusual weapon not shown in the Monster Hunter Series, the whip. He's quite a mysterious character who is willing to help Curlon become a Forbidden Hunter just like Shiki, but he must help Shadow get a hold of Shiki's rare Wind Element Dual Swords. He is a weapon creator studying to make Wind Element weapons, however Shiki beats him to it earning him Shadow's undying hatred. Curlon betrays him and has him arrested for ruining Ailee's life when she was younger. ; :Gordon is a man the Guild's poaching counter- measure department. He is sent to test if Ailee was involved with illegal selling that has already resulted in her being banned from taking the Forbidden Hunter exam.

F. Varghese, Biju Menon, Abhirami.  Synopsis  Nandagopal (Suresh Gopi), an Associate Editor with Kerala Reshmi, one of the leading newspapers, is an aggressive and daring journalist who enjoys a good reputation among the media circle. Born and brought up in Mumbai, Nandan is the son of Venugopal, an iconic journalist who was killed by the textile mafia long back for being a staunch supporter of trade unions. Nandan, in Kochi meets Shekaran (Murali), an old naxalite and his father's friend who is running Jagratha, a newspaper which is feared by the hypocritical political class. Shekaran's outspoken and belligerent nature had earned him more enemies than friends. He is constantly fighting Vishwanathan (N. F. Varghese), an estranged ideological disciple of Shekaran who rules Kochi with his muscle and money. Vishwanathan holds a large share in Kerala Reshmi (acquired through deceit) and enjoys a huge political clout at state and central levels. C.I Haridas, a police officer close to Shekaran, informs him about a vital source to collect evidences against Vishwanathan. Shekaran decides to expose the role of Vishwanathan in the murder of Vincent Peter and numerous other crimes, by publishing the confessions made by a henchman (vital source) of Vishwanathan. The plan is revealed to Vishwanathan by a key journalist in Jagratha effectively double crossing Shekaran. A bomb explosion orchestrated by Vishwanathan eliminates Shekaran and C.I Haridas. Jagratha, the newspaper run by Shekaran is inherited by Devika Shekar (Manju Warrier), the only daughter of Shekaran, who is a fiery journalist like her father. Nandan, who was very close to Sekharan, manages to ensure that the case is investigated by an incorruptible officer. Firoze Mohammed (Biju Menon), the investigating officer, who is also an old admirer of Nandan, is gradually gathering evidences to incriminate Vishwanathan. Nandan is arrested by the police in a fabricated case and sacked from Kerala Reshmi. Meanwhile, Firoz decides to arrest Vishwanathan as he makes a drastic headway into the case. While arresting Vishwanathan, Firoz is killed by the latter and his henchmen. Nandan is released on bail and takes law into his hands. He shoots down Vishwanathan in the climax and takes over as the new Chief Editor of Jagratha. Cast *Suresh Gopi as Nandagopal *Manju Warrier as Devika Shekhar *Murali as Shekharan *N. F.

Dudley (14 November 1896‚Äì 18 September 1980) was a pioneering electronic and acoustic engineer who created the first electronic voice synthesizer for Bell Labs in the 1930s and led the development of a method of sending secure voice transmissions during World War Two. His awards include the Franklin Institute's Stuart Ballantine Medal (1965). Early life Born in Virginia, Dudley's family moved to Pennsylvania when he was a schoolboy. His father was a preacher, and his parents also gave lessons to students, in classical and religious subjects. Dudley trained to be a grade school and high school teacher. He found it difficult to keep discipline in the classroom and soon gave up teaching. Intending a change in career, he enrolled in Pennsylvania State University, where he developed an interest in the nascent science of electronic engineering. After taking some college courses in electronic engineering, Dudley found employment with Bell Laboratories, which was at that time a division of Western Electric Company. His career with Bell Labs spanned 40 years, most of it in the Telephone Transmission Division.https://books.google.com/books?id=AKaiz3TiIJ8C&pg;=PA23&dq;=%22Homer+Dudley%22&sig;=tg06uKu8C98bw4eG_ZL5iVqaOaw#PPA24,M1 Sound theory Dudley's primary area of exploration was in the idea of human speech being fundamentally the use of a carrier‚Äîa more or less continuous sound that is modulated and shaped by the mouth, throat and sinuses into recognizable speech. The vocal cords create a carrier sound which is shaped into formants by the throat, mouth and sinuses into what we recognize as vowel sounds (\\"aah\\", \\"eeh\\", \\"ooh\\", etc.), which are further shaped by plosives (such as pressing the lips together to create a \\"p\\" sound) and glottal stops (such as closing the back of the throat to produce a \\"guh\\" sound). Dudley theorized that an intelligible analogue to human speech could be created by breaking sound down into modular blocks which could be assembled into a desired order, to allow the production and communication with artificial speech. By replacing the natural carrier sound of human speech with a carrier sound at a higher frequency, speech could be reproduced more clearly over long distances and low volumes, since higher frequency sounds are heard more clearly than lower ones. The VOCODER and VODER In 1928, Dudley began experimenting with electromechanical devices to produce analogues of human speech. A key to this process was the development of a parallel band-pass filter, which allowed sounds to be filtered down to a fairly specific portion of the audio spectrum by attenuating the sounds that fall above or below a certain band. This led to the patent for the \\"Vocoder\\" (a portmanteau of \\"voice\\" and \\"encoder\\"), a method of reproducing speech through electronic means, and allowing it to be transmitted over distances, as through telephone lines. By reproducing human speech electronically, the elements of speech could be filtered into ten specific audio spectrum bands, rendering it more easily transmitted over telephone lines with greater clarity and legibility. The speech could also be compressed down to a very narrow frequency band, to allow multiple transmissions simultaneously on different bands. This enabled many telephone conversations to be transmitted at the same time over one line. With the assistance of fellow engineer Robert Riesz, Dudley created the \\"VODER\\" (for \\"Voice Operation DEmonstratoR\\"),Text to Speech Synthesis (Bell Labs) a console from which an operator could create phrases of speech controlling a VOCODER with a keyboard and foot pedals; it was considered difficult to operate. The VODER was demonstrated at Bell Laboratory exhibits at both the 1939 New York World's Fair and the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition. With a woman operator sitting behind the console, phrases resembling human speech could be demonstrated to the audience, although the produced sounds were often difficult to understand. On June 21, 1938 Dudley and Bell Labs were granted a patent (US#2,121,142) for a \\"System for the artificial production of vocal or other sounds\\".Google patents SIGSALY and wartime projects Dudley worked with famed British mathematician, cryptographer and computer pioneer Alan Turing on the SIGSALY project, for the US Military. SIGSALY was a method of transmitting speech in a secure manner, rendering it unable to be understood by unauthorized listeners. It utilized technology developed in the VOCODER and VODER projects, and added a random noise source as a method of encrypting speech. SIGSALY was successfully used by US military intelligence during World War II for transmitting the highest level of classified messages. Later projects Dudley stayed with Bell Labs through the early 1960s. During that time, he invented and refined many of the technologies that became essential for telephony. His development of artificial speech was elaborated upon by others to produce methods of artificial speech for humans unable to use their vocal cords (as with the voice synthesizer used by Stephen Hawking), and by electronic music pioneers Wendy Carlos, Robert Moog and the German musical group Kraftwerk. One of Dudley's final projects was the design of an electronic kit distributed by Bell Labs for home hobbyists and students, called \\"Speech Synthesis: an Experiment in Electronic Speech Production\\". The kit contained the components with which to create an electronic circuit that could produce three different speech formants. The kit entered production in 1963 and was produced until the late 1960s.

Storyline In the McDuck Clan ancestral castle in Scotland, Scrooge's father and uncle speak of Scrooge and his accomplishments, toasting to \\"the lad\\". Meanwhile, Scrooge has gone to Kalgoorlie, Australia, after hearing of gold being found there. In the middle of the desert, he rescues an aborigine wiseman, Jabiru Kapirigi, from being robbed by a highwayman. Jabiru, or Jabby as Scrooge calls him, tells Scrooge that he is on a walkabout, reading the Dreamtime tale, and he wants Scrooge to join him. Scrooge, hoping to find gold where Jabby leads him, goes along. As the wiseman hands Scrooge a didgeridoo, Scrooge sarcastically replies \\"Great! Now I'm John Philip Sousa!\\", which Jabby takes literally, and hence, calls Scrooge by the name Jonflip Zooza. Whilst blowing the didgeridoo, the sand beneath Scrooge crumbles to reveal an ancient cave. The two use a rope to climb down into the hole, where on the walls the Dreamtale is written. Jabby reads it aloud to Scrooge: :\\"It tells of Kakadu the dingo, he steals the crocodile egg from its nest! :But the great platypus chases Kakadu... :...and Irria, the black cockatoo, sends Bunyip, the water monster, after the egg thief! :Bunyip chases the dingo... :...and the great platypus finds the sacred egg, but loses his firstborn in the fight! Scrooge dismisses it all as \\"pure humbug\\", and asks Jabby if the cave holds any gold. There is none, but Jabby points to a giant opal. Scrooge wishes to buy it, but their rope is being hauled up by the highwayman. Having heard of the opal, he orders them to send it up, and he will let them climb out. When he has the opal, however, he just throws the rope down. He then steals Scrooge's camel and all his things. To get out, Scrooge blows Jabby's didgeridoo to summon an emu, then uses the emu to chase after the highwayman. When he rides off, Jabby asks Scrooge if he will return the opal, but Scrooge gives no answer. Come morning, the highwayman is searching through Scrooge's belongings and finds some coins. One, tied to a string that \\"isn't even Aussie\\", is Scrooge's number one dime. He throws the coins away just as Scrooge catches up with him, and ties a rope around the thief. As they turn around, the coins, including the one dime, lie in the sand, forgotten. They ride for some time, before a kangaroo stampede passes by them. The camel then runs off with the highwayman, but Scrooge falls off. He hears a roar in the distant and, looking in his spyglass, sees that it's a flash flood from the mountains. He runs for shelter, and just barely makes it to the Dreamtale cave, which is then sealed off by the water and wet sand. Come morning he can again leave, climbing out on the wet sand. He ponders taking the giant opal for himself, as no one will know for a hundred years, but decides that he wants to make his fortune by right means, and leaves the opal behind. Much later, at the edge of the desert, Scrooge encounters Jabby again, sitting by a campfire at the end of another Dreamtale cave. Jabby knows that Scrooge returned the opal, and when Scrooge tells him that he had lost his number one dime, Jabby wonders if it was like his firstborn. It is, and Scrooge realises that he in fact is the great platypus from the Dreamtale. Scrooge realizes that the part of the Dreamtale that Jabby read him earlier actually foretold his adventure with the highwayman and the flash flood. Jabby continues to tell Scrooge that the great platypus's firstborn was saved by Djuway, the bowerbird who builds his nest with shiny trinkets. Nearby is a bowerbird nest, and looking inside Scrooge finds his number one dime. Ecstatic, he wonders what else the Dreamtale says about the great platypus. As a reward for returning the egg (the opal), Scrooge is allowed to \\"see his dream through the crystal eye\\". Jabby casts sunlight upon a crystal of his, held by Scrooge against the wall of the cave. What Scrooge sees resembles the northern lights, and it tells him to go north of the Rocky Mountains, north to the Yukon. As Scrooge leaves, singing happily to himself, Jabby looks at the Dreamtale, where there is a drawing resembling his money bin, and his nephews, Donald, Huey, Dewey and Louie. Jabby finds it confusing, and wonders what they have \\"to do with a poor, out of luck fossicker (prospector) like poor Jonflip\\".

It is a part of the greater Downtown Summerlin area, a development which lies within the community of Summerlin on the western outskirts of Las Vegas, Nevada. The shopping center contains and is located on . The two major anchor stores are Dillard's and Macy's. In total, Downtown Summerlin is home to over 125 shops, bars, and restaurants, as well as a Regal Cinemas movie theater. A mall for the Summerlin community had been planned by The Howard Hughes Corporation since 1988, but was delayed several times. General Growth Properties acquired Howard Hughes Corporation in 2004, and began work on the site in 2007, to build what was then known as The Shops at Summerlin Centre. Construction was suspended in 2008, due to financial problems. Howard Hughes Corporation took over the project in 2010, and resumed construction in 2013. Downtown Summerlin's grand opening was held on October 9, 2014. History A shopping mall had been a part of The Howard Hughes Corporation's master plan for Summerlin, Nevada since announcing the community in 1988. The project was once planned as an indoor mall with several department stores. By February 1996, Howard Hughes Corporation had plans for a 100-acre shopping mall, to be built near Charleston Boulevard and Town Center Drive. The mall was expected to be opened by the end of the 1990s. Later in 1996, Howard Hughes Corporation became a subsidiary of The Rouse Company. In March 1997, Howard Hughes Corporation announced that the mall would contain and would be opened by 2000. It would include five department stores as anchor tenants. The mall would be developed by The Rouse Company and The Howard Hughes Corporation. As of May 1998, the mall was expected to open in spring 2001. The planned Summerlin Town Center project would include the proposed mall as well as office space. Anchor tenants would include Robinsons-May, Lord & Taylor, and Dillard's, while Nordstrom would be a potential anchor tenant. In May 1999, Rouse announced Sears as an additional anchor tenant. The mall, known then as Summerlin Center, was scheduled to open in 2004. As of 2001, the Summerlin Town Center Mall was scheduled for completion in spring 2005. As of 2003, the mall was being planned as part of the proposed Summerlin Town Centre. Rouse intended to begin developing the project in 2004, following the completion of an expansion at the Fashion Show Mall. Construction was not scheduled to begin until at least early 2005, with a first phase expected to open in early 2006. By 2004, the mall was scheduled to open in 2006 or 2007. Later in 2004, General Growth Properties (GGP) purchased The Rouse Company and its Howard Hughes subsidiary. The acquisition was a primary reason that the mall's opening was delayed from 2007 to 2008. In May 2005, GGP announced that the mall would be named Summerlin Centre. It would be an outdoor mall with up to six anchor tenants. As of October 2005, the mall project was known as The Shops at Summerlin Centre. In May 2006, GGP announced that the mall would feature , including four anchor stores. It would be part of the Summerlin Centre project, which GGP planned to begin constructing in spring 2007, for a scheduled grand opening in fall 2008. Nordstrom was announced as an anchor tenant in March 2007. At the time, GGP was in the early stages of planning the mall. The first phase of The Shops at Summerlin Centre was planned to open in 2009. GGP intended for the project to serve as the heart of Summerlin. =Construction= Work began on the site in April 2007. By February 2008, construction was ongoing for the mall's underground parking. A construction permit for the mall was issued in April 2008. The following month, Macy's and Dillard's were announced as additional anchor tenants in the mall. Upon its planned opening in October 2009, the mall was expected to feature 100 stores and 10 restaurants. In August 2008, GGP announced that it would suspend construction of The Shops at Summerlin Centre due to financial problems. The company intended to delay the project by at least 12 months. If GGP had proceeded with the 2009 opening, the mall would be about 70 percent occupied, approximately 23 percent lower than the company's usual mall occupancy rates. Construction was suspended on October 31, 2008. The project was 40 percent completed, and consisted of an unfinished steel superstructure. Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, the project had been valued at $220 million. GGP filed for bankruptcy in 2009. In December 2009, three construction companies involved in the mall project took legal action against GGP to receive compensation for the work that was done on the unfinished project, which was no longer under construction. One construction company also stated that the steel superstructure was deteriorating in value because of its exposure to environmental elements, raising the possibility that it may need to be demolished and rebuilt if the project should resume. GGP consulted with engineers to preserve the project's structural integrity. In February 2010, GGP settled with the construction companies. Howard Hughes Corporation took over the project in 2010. In September 2012, Howard Hughes Corporation announced that construction would resume on the Shops at Summerlin, with Macy's still intended as an anchor tenant and an opening scheduled for fall 2014. Howard Hughes CEO David Weinreb criticized GGP for not finishing the project as originally scheduled. Tom Warden, senior vice president for Howard Hughes Corporation, later said that the project's delay turned out to be for the better \\"in the sense that the design now is more evolved.\\" Initially, the project was designed with a single linear street design, before being changed to two streets. Other changes included a marketplace added at the southern end, and freestanding restaurants that surround a courtyard. Construction resumed in July 2013. Nordstrom Rack was announced as a tenant in September 2013. Bath & Body Works, Michael Kors, Old Navy, Sephora, True Religion, Ulta Beauty, and Victoria's Secret were announced as tenants in January 2014. The Shops at Summerlin project was expected to cost $391 million. As of March 2014, Howard Hughes Corporation had spent $181 million on developing the project. In May 2014, the company announced that the mall would open on October 9, 2014, as Downtown Summerlin rather than The Shops at Summerlin. The mall occupies , part of the greater Downtown Summerlin area, which has a total of . In July 2014, Howard Hughes Corporation secured a $312 million loan to finance the mall project, which had more than 2,000 construction workers. The Downtown Summerlin mall was one of the biggest retail projects under construction in the United States, only ranking behind the American Dream Meadowlands mall in New Jersey. =Operation= Tree-lined street at Downtown Summerlin Downtown Summerlin in 2015 Downtown Summerlin includes a five-screen Regal Cinemas movie theater, which opened on October 5, 2014, and hosted discounted screenings for the next several days to benefit charity ahead of the official grand opening four days later. The mall portion opened as scheduled on October 9, 2014, with 85 of its 125 stores ready for business. Additional stores were scheduled to open in the coming months. The shopping, dining, and entertainment center contains a total of . The opening night included a fireworks and light show, and a four-day street festival was held to celebrate the opening. Nevada governor Brian Sandoval kicked off the street party. Thousands of people visited Downtown Summerlin on its opening day, causing issues with traffic and parking. More than 250,000 people visited Downtown Summerlin during its grand opening weekend. The center has 6,400 parking spaces, as well as tree-lined streets and walkways. The area includes approximately 400 palm trees. Downtown Summerlin had 111 announced tenants at the time of its opening, employing a total of 2,000 people. Dillard's opening was celebrated with six fashion shows. The mall included 32 planned restaurants at the time of its opening, although many of them were not ready for the opening day. Instead, food trucks provided services. Nordstrom Rack held its grand opening on October 24, 2014. More than one million customers had visited Downtown Summerlin as of November 2014, and many retailers were surpassing expectations. Executives in the local commercial real estate market believed that Downtown Summerlin would help the local economy grow. In November 2014, Howard Hughes Corporation opened an ice rink on vacant land near the mall's north parking garage. The site was originally intended for future development as a third department store. The land was subsequently made into a park, although the ice rink continues to return each year around Christmas time. The Summerlin Festival of Arts began holding its art festival event at Downtown Summerlin in 2015, and has continued to do so each year. Major tenants Shopping at Downtown Summerlin.

They are long ridges on the ground parallel to the movement. Examples can be found in many places including Iceland, Alaska and Canada. As glaciers move along the surface of the earth, rocks are slowly mixed in with the ice. Rocks may reach the bottom of the glacier and begin to scrape along the earth. Eventually boulder sized rocks become lodged in the ground. Once the boulder is in place, the glacier flows around it. As a result, a cavity is formed on the down slope side of the boulder. This cavity is then filled with sediments such as till and outwash. Similar cavities can also be formed as the glacier moves over bedrock outcrops or bed irregularities which also may form flutes. These mounds are usually only a couple of metres high but hundreds of metres long. They are named flutes as their long and narrow shape resembles the musical instrument. References *Easterbrook, D.

Codes prevented the cutting of more trees than necessary for home construction, unconnected buildings, business restrictions, prohibitions on brick and metal siding and similar provisions intended to maintain the rural character of the development. Two separate lodge buildings were built; one at the upper entrance to the development and another at the base of the ski slopes. At its peak, the Bear Rocks Ski area featured eight slopes and trails with a double- chair lift and snow-making equipment. The advertisement also boasted a private fishing lake, \\"magnificent\\" swimming pool, rustic cocktail lounge, tennis, horseback riding, social activities, and \\"golf at a private country club nearby.\\" Bear Rocks reportedly ceased ski operations after the 1973 season. The ski lodge and restaurant burned to the ground a few years later and was not rebuilt, however the community lodge remains as a focal point for residents. The community continues to grow, and new homes have been constructed in the clearings of the former ski slopes and continue to be built on vacant lots. While the rustic character of the development is still very evident, it has suffered somewhat in recent years as the Bear Rocks codes have been increasingly ignored, including the clear-cutting of lots, and some logging operations.Live Search Maps =Forest Lake= Following in the footsteps of the very successful Bear Rocks, this much smaller resort featuring a recreational lake, a swimming pond, and wooded house lots, Forest Lake, was developed adjacent to the eastern edge of Bear Rocks along Bear Rocks road. As part of the sales promotion, a red caboose, now greatly decayed, was placed on one of the lots. Forest Lake never enjoyed the success of its larger neighbor and only 5 houses were built. To this day one of the sample A-framed houses, the owner built a Tudor house over the A-framed house. Same owner built his ionic bridge on Forest Lake. Government An unincorporated place, Acme is within Mount Pleasant Township. Transportation Pennsylvania Route 31, a two-lane artery, runs east and west through the center of Acme. The Pennsylvania Turnpike parallels the state road to the north, with the closest interchange in Donegal, to the southeast. Because Turnpike traffic is occasionally diverted to the state route, additional lanes were added to accommodate truck traffic down the latter's western descent of the Allegheny Mountains, on a stretch of highway known as Three Mile Hill. Recreation and amenities Chestnut Ridge Park features a recreational pool (lake) with a boat launch and short walking trail. The county park provides opportunity for fishing, hunting and other outdoor activities in a quiet, isolated rural setting. Acme Speedway hosts kart racing every Saturday night from mid-April through late September. Donegal Highlands, an 18-hole public golf course, offers a unique challenge to golfers of all abilities. Stone Villa Wine Cellars provides seasonal outdoor entertainment as well as daily wine tastings.

Other locally produced shows were Saturday Night's Barn Dance, which was televised live from KQTV studios. It featured local country & western talent in a Grand Ole Opry style format. The regular sponsor for this show was Schultz Brothers car sales from Algona, who would drive the \\"featured\\" car of the week to the studio early afternoon on Saturday, drive it into the studio and wax it down in preparation for the evening's live commercials. KQTV had one very large General Electric black & white image orthicon TV Camera. There were no zoom lenses, which meant the camera was \\"trucked\\" in and out for close ups or wide shots. It had a hydraulic pedestal and moved up or down by pressing on foot pedals. There was a smaller 2nd camera available which was rarely used. The \\"news\\" department was a small desk off of the control room and consisted of two Teletype machines that ran non-stop. Remote stories were shot on 8mm film with no live sound and were edited together on film-cutting film loops. The transmitter occupied the entire back of the building. Throughout the station's history, it competed against Des Moines NBC affiliate WHO-TV. The station changed its callsign to KVFD-TV in 1966.Old Tv Newscast Titles It moved to channel 50 in early 1977 after selling its Bradgate, Iowa transmitter and tower to Iowa Public Television (IPTV). Viewership, and thus advertising revenues, for KVFD-TV had not increased as much as expected after building the 1200 foot Bradgate tower in 1970. This prompted the channel swap between KVFD- TV and IPTV's unbuilt KTIN, which was originally assigned to channel 46. KTIN took over the Bradgate tower and began operations on channel 21. KVFD-TV opted to return to its original 600-foot Fort Dodge tower at the studio and moved to channel 50, as a used transmitter and antenna that was tuned to channel 50 was available.Federal Communications Commission, ‚ÄúIn the Matter of Amendment of Section 73.606(b), Table of Assignments, Television Broadcast Stations.

He was born in Bolsover, Derbyshire, England and died at Fort Dauphin in present-day Manitoba. He married Mary Mackagonne, a Cree woman, and together they had 14 children. Career Fidler joined the Hudson's Bay Company as a labourer at London and took up his post at York Factory in 1788. He was promoted to clerk and posted to Manchester House and South Branch House in what later became Saskatchewan within his first year. In 1790, he was transferred to Cumberland House and given training in surveying and astronomy by Philip Turnor who also trained David Thompson. On 23 December 1788, Thompson had seriously fractured his leg, forcing him to spend the next two winters at Cumberland House convalescing which gave Fidler the opportunity to accompany Turnor on an exploration expedition to the west from 1790 to 1792 attempting to find a route to Lake Athabaska and Great Slave Lake and therefore a route to the Pacific Ocean. Although the river route to the west his employer sought was found not to exist, on this and following expeditions Fidler gathered data for the first of several maps that he produced. Information he gathered was incorporated into the maps of North America produced by Aaron Arrowsmith. Peter Fidler's map of the Swan River and Upper Assiniboine River, 1795 In 1795, the London Committee of the HBC sent Fidler inland again, this time to map the area west of Lake Winnipegosis where Charles Thomas Isham had built three posts - Swan River House, Marlborough House, and Somerset House. Fidler helped Isham establish another fort at Carlton House (Assiniboine River), not to be confused with Fort Carlton (Saskatchewan River) which is a National Historic Site. The following May, Fidler moved on to Buckingham House as surveyor. He established Bolsover House (near Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan) in 1797;Greenwich House at Lac la Biche in 1799; Chesterfield House in 1800; and Nottingham House in 1802. While at Chesterfield House, Fidler collected valuable information and maps about Blackfoot Confederacy territory throughout the Upper Missouri region, including two maps drawn by Ackomokki. In 1806, after two years of harassment by Samuel Black of the rival North West Company, Fidler surrendered Nottingham House on Lake Athabasca and fled the post with his men. Fidler was surveyor and district manager at Brandon House between 1814‚Äì1819, including when the post was plundered by a group of men who days later would be involved in the Battle of Seven Oaks. In his will he requested that anything remaining from his other bequests be placed in a fund and the interest be allowed to accumulate until August 16, 1969, at which time the whole would be paid to the next male heir in descent from his son Peter. As of 1946 this fund could not be located.

Abby Cadabby stars in the \\"Alice\\" role. The feature-length adventure was released on DVD by Genius Products on September 30, 2008. In addition to receiving a DVD release, the film received a limited theatrical run in September 2008 through the Kidtoons family matinee series, and was aired on PBS Kids Feast of Favorites during the week of Thanksgiving 2008.This Thanksgiving, Save Some Room For PBS KIDS... It was aired again on December 29, 2008 on local PBS stations. Plot Abby wants very much to be in her own fairy tale. Elmo takes an interest in Abby's wish and tells her the story of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". For a second Abby falls asleep and she opens her eyes to see that she is wearing a blue dress and blouse and Elmo has turned into a rabbit and is in a great hurry. Abby follows Elmo down a tunnel. At the bottom she loses her wand to Elmo, who disappears at the end of the tunnel. Abby notices there is a small door, but its locked. She finds the key to the door on a table that just appeared. She unlocks the door, but she's too big to fit through the little door. With that she closes, locks the door and puts the key back on the table. Then Abby notices there is a bottle that just appeared. Before Abby can drink it, the bottle tells her not to drink him, but say things that rhyme with 'drink'. Abby does and she shrinks to the right size to go through the door, but she recalls she locked it and left the key on the table, where it is out of her reach. Abby finds a cookie who tells her to say things that rhyme with 'eat'. Abby says so many rhymes, she grows pretty big, but she manages to balance her size, grab the key and shrink herself to a small size. Abby takes Bottle and Cookie with her as she unlocks the door and enters a flowerbed. Further in the flowerbed, Abby meets Counterpillar and his partner Little Rose-Ita, but does not want to join in their counting game. With Cookie's help, Abby restores herself to her regular size. Just then Elmo rushes past and Abby runs after him, passing Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-Dee, who mention, that they are actually not in this story. Abby bumps into a tree and hears some munching. She sees a pair of eyes and the Cheshire Cookie Cat appears. He points Abby in the direction of a tea party. At the tea party are seated the Mad Hatter, Elmo and Mousie. To Abby's surprise, the Hatter doesn't serve tea, but letters 'T' in the cups. The Hatter shows Abby his collection of hats. After that Abby asks Elmo for her wand, but with the hole in his pocket, he dropped it somewhere. The Cheshire Cookie Cat appears, guzzles up all the scones and cookies and scares away Mousie. Abby walks down a path in the search for her wand until she sees the path forks into four directions. As Elmo comes to talk with Abby, she sits down in despair of being lost in this wonderland. Soon Elmo rushes off to attend the King's Croquet Game. Abby follows him and finds a door in a tree. The door takes her to the messy castle of the king, \\"The Grouch of Cards\\". The king has Abby's wand thinking it's a new royal scepter. Abby tries to retrieve her wand, challenging the king to a game of croquet, but he cheats. Elmo protests at the king's decision to keep the wand. Before his grouchlings can throw out Abby and Elmo, they both use Cookie to grow large. They scare the grouchlings and the king away. Once Abby and Elmo restore themselves to their original size, Abby reclaims her wand. Abby is unable to magic herself back home, but Elmo reminds her she's still dreaming. Back in Sesame Street Elmo shakes Abby awake. Although Abby sort of got her wish to be in a fairy tale, she thinks she's better off being in a fairy tale when she's a little older. With that Abby and Elmo go off to play.

Reception DVD Verdict gave the film a positive review, noting that while the original Alice in Wonderland story \\"kooky and fanciful, but also a little creepy\\", the Sesame Street version was sanitized for its target audience by polishing the original's \\"rough edges\\" and \\"removing any real sense of danger.\\" They further noted that there is a place for some scary children's tales, but not on Sesame Street. While the film is targeted to a very young audience, some of the jokes are for adults. An example given is on how Ernie explains to Bert \\"that, despite popular misconception,\\" the characters of Tweedledum and Tweedledee are \\"not actually in this story\\". It was noted that while the songs written by Mark Radice are bright and fun, \\"they don't quite live up to the best tunes Sesame Street has to offer.\\" It was concluded \\"There are a lot of bad remakes of Alice in Wonderland.

Description  The species can grow up to 2 metres in height, but is usually between 0.2 and 1 metre high in its native range. The leaves are linear to cylindrical and usually around 1 cm in length. The leaves have a flattened base, which is alluded to in the Latin specific epithet depressa. Numerous flowers, each about 1 to 1.3 cm in diameter, cover the plant in summer . Northern forms have pink to light purple colouring on the outer petals and a contrasting yellow centre, while all- yellow forms are found in the south. The petals are wider than many other Calytrix species. As with most species in the genus, the calyx lobes have prominent awns that extend well-beyond the extent of the petals. Cultivation This species requires a moist but well-drained position, with filtered sunlight. The species may be propagated from cuttings or seed, the latter resulting in stronger plants although difficult to germinate. Plants may sometimes be affected by root rot in hot, humid climates, or scale.

Traditionally made swords were produced during this period but, in order to supply such large numbers of swords, blacksmiths with little or no knowledge of traditional Japanese sword manufacture were recruited. In addition, supplies of the type of Japanese steel (tamahagane) used for sword making were limited so several other types of steel were substituted. Shortcuts in forging were also taken, such as the use of power hammers and tempering the blade in oil rather than hand forging and water tempering; these measures created swords without the usual characteristics associated with Japanese swords. The non-traditionally made swords from this period are called Sh≈çwat≈ç. In 1937, the Japanese government started requiring the use of special stamps on the tang to distinguish these swords from traditionally made swords. During this wartime period antique swords from older time periods were remounted for use in military mounts. In Japan, sh≈çwat≈ç are not considered to be true Japanese swords, and they can be confiscated. Outside Japan they are collected as historical artifacts.

To distinguish individuality, wealth or craftsmanship, many swords were produced in batches as small as 1‚Äì25 to maintain the legacy of sword culture. Styles varied greatly, with inspirations drawn from swords of early periods, familial crests, and experimental artistic forms that the Meiji Restoration period had begun to introduce. Some examples have included European style silverworking, jade, cloisonn√©, or metalwork and paint for artistic relief.Gregory, Ron R. . \\"GUNTO SWORDS\\". JAPANESE MILITARY SWORDS - I. March 13, 2015. Accessed June 26, 2017. https://www.japaneseswordindex.com/military.htm. After the Second World War's conclusion, most produced gunt≈ç were made to resemble the traditionally cloth wrapped shin-gunto swords, but out of a solid metal casting. On later models the hilts were made of aluminum and painted to resemble the lacing (ito) on officer's shin-gunt≈ç swords. These swords will have serial numbers on their blades and are nearly always machine made. If the sword is all original, the serial numbers on the blade, tsuba, saya and all other parts should match. =Shin gunt≈ç (new military sword)= Shin gunto with leather combat cover The was a weapon and symbol of rank used by the Imperial Japanese Army between the years of 1935 and 1945. During most of that period, the swords were manufactured at the Toyokawa Naval Arsenal. In response to rising nationalism within the armed forces, a new style of sword was designed for the Japanese military in 1934. The shin gunt≈ç was styled after a traditional slung tachi of the Kamakura Period (1185-1332). Officers' ranks were indicated by coloured tassels tied to a loop at the end of the hilt. The corresponding colors were brown-red and gold for generals; brown and red for field officers; brown and blue for company or warrant officers; brown for sergeants, sergeants major or corporals.The Japanese Army 1931-42, Volume 1 of The Japanese Army, 1931-45, Author Philip S. Jowett, Publisher Osprey Publishing, 2002, P.41 The blades found in shin gunt≈ç ranged from modern machine made blades through contemporary traditionally-manufactured blades to ancestral blades dating back hundreds of years. Type 94 officers' sword replaced the Western style kyu gunto in 1934. It had a traditionally constructed hilt (tsuka) with ray skin (same) wrapped with traditional silk wrapping (ito). A cherry blossom (a symbol of the Imperial Japanese Army) theme was incorporated into the guard (tsuba), pommels (fuchi and kashira), and ornaments (menuki). The scabbard for the Type 94 was made of metal with a wood lining to protect the blade. It was often painted brown and was suspended from two brass mounts, one of which was removable and only used when in full dress uniform. The fittings on the scabbard were also decorated with cherry blossom designs. Type 95 released in 1935 was designed for use by non-commissioned officers (NCOs). It was designed to resemble an officer's shin gunt≈ç but be cheaper to mass- produce. All NCOs' swords had machine-made blades with deep fullers (bo hi) and a serial number stamped on the blade in arabic numerals. Initially the hilts were cast out of metal (either copper or aluminium) and painted to resemble the traditionally produced items on the officer's swords. They had brass guards similar to the officer's shin gunt≈ç. By 1945 a simplified NCO sword was being produced. It had a simple wooden hilt with cross hatched grooves for grip. The scabbards were made from wood instead of metal and the guard and other fittings were made from iron instead of brass. Type 98 The change to occurred in 1938 and was essentially a simplification of the Type 94. There were only minor differences between early Type 98 swords and the Type 94 swords that preceded them. Most notably the second (removable) hanging point was omitted from the scabbard. Many changes occurred to the Type 98 between 1938 and the end of the war in 1945. Late in the war Japan's supply of metal was drying up and shin gunt≈ç were produced with painted wooden scabbards, and with cheaper or no brass ornamentation. Some of the final swords produced in the last year of the war utilized cheap copper or blackened iron fittings. =Kaigunt≈ç (naval sword)= are the less common naval versions of the shin gunt≈ç.Samurai: The Weapons And Spirit Of The Japanese Warrior, Author Clive Sinclaire, Publisher Globe Pequot, 2004, P.85 Some kai gunto were produced with stainless steel blades.Warman's World War II Collectibles: Identification and Price Guide, Author John F.

The mushroom is edible. Many sources report it has a bitter taste, but others have found it delicious and suspect that the bitter specimens may be similar related species. The mushroom has a large, brownish cap with large brown scales and may reach 30 cm (12 in) in diameter. On the underside it sports greyish, brittle teeth instead of gills, and has white flesh. Its spore print is brown. It is associated with spruce (Picea), appearing in autumn. It ranges throughout North America and Europe, although collections from the British Isles are now assigned to the similar species Sarcodon squamosus. Taxonomy The Swedish botanist Olof Celsius reported in 1732 that Sarcodon imbricatus occurred in the vicinity of Uppsala, and Carl Linnaeus wrote of it in his 1737 work Flora lapponica. It was one of the species initially described by Linnaeus, as Hydnum imbricatum, in the second volume of his Species Plantarum in 1753. The specific epithet is the Latin imbricatus meaning \\"tiled\\" or \\"with overlapping tiles\\". It was then placed in the genus Sarcodon by Finnish mycologist Petter Adolf Karsten in 1881. For many years, Sarcodon imbricatus was described associated with both spruce and pine, although the latter forms were smaller and noted to be more palatable by mushroom hunters in Norway. Furthermore, the mushroom has been used as a source of pigment and collectors noted that fresh specimens collected under pine yielded pigment, but only old ones collected under spruce. Molecular analysis of the DNA revealed the two forms to be distinct genetically, and thus populations of what had been described as S. imbricatus were now assigned to Sarcodon squamosus, which includes collections in the British Isles and the Netherlands. Description The mushrooms, or fruiting bodies, can be quite large in size. the brownish or greyish cap measures up to 30 cm (12 in) in diameter and is covered with coarse darker brown scales. It is funnel-shaped. The underside bears soft, pale grey 'teeth' rather than gills. These are 0.5‚Äì1 cm long and brittle. The pale grey or brown stipe may reach high and wide, and may be narrower at the base and is sometimes eccentric. From above, it may be confused with the old man of the woods (Strobilomyces strobilaceus) as both have a similar shaggy cap. The bitter and inedible Sarcodon amarascens can be distinguished by its bluish-black stipe. Distribution and habitat The fruit bodies of Sarcodon imbricatus grow in association with firs (Abies), especially in hilly or mountainous areas, and can appear on sandy or chalk soils in fairy rings. The usual fruiting season in August to October. It ranges throughout North America and Europe, although collections from the British Isles are now assigned to another species, Sarcodon squamosus. Uses cha (scaly hedgehog tea) Old mushrooms of Sarcodon imbricatus and related species contain blue-green pigments, which are used for dyeing wool in Norway.Rice M, Beebee D. (1980). Mushrooms for Color. Mad River Press : Eureka. =Edibility= The fungus can be bitter, although this is less apparent in younger specimens. Submerging the mushrooms in boiling water will remove this. It can be pickled or dried and used as flavouring. In Bulgaria it is collected, dried and finely ground to be used as an aromatic mushroom flour. It is reported as edible but of poor quality in the United States by some sources but as deliciously edible by others. In Korea, mushroom tea is made from it. Distinctive spicy aroma of fried younger specimens has made it an expensive delicacy on Japanese food market.

These rights then allow the subordinate to act, in the external or internal forum, validly or lawfully, or at least safely. Classification They may be classified by the object to which they relate: * jurisdiction is granted to absolve from sins and ecclesiastical censures, to dispense in vows, in irregularities relating to the reception of orders, in matrimonial impediments; * permission or licence is given to do something which would be otherwise forbidden, as the reading of prohibited books, saying two Masses on the same day; ordaining clerics under the prescribed age; * to avoid worry and qualms of conscience a precautionary dispensation or permission is granted to proceed in certain cases in relation to which the opinions of theologians may not appear sufficiently well founded, as for instance, a matrimonial dispensation may be conceded as a precaution, when it is not certain that an impediment exists, or permission to anticipate at 2 p.m. the recitation of the Divine Office is granted to a person who is unwilling to accept the opinion that anticipation at that hour is lawful. Secondly, faculties, by reason of their source, are Apostolic, episcopal, or regular. Faculties are styled Apostolic or papal when they proceed from the pope directly, or through the ordinary channels of the Roman Congregations. They are episcopal, if the power or privilege conferred proceeds from a diocesan bishop, by virtue of his own power or ordinary jurisdiction, as for instance, the faculties of the diocese, to hear confessions, say Mass, preach, etc., granted to priests who labour in the diocese for the salvation of souls. Faculties are regular when they proceed from superiors of the regular clergy by reason of their ordinary jurisdiction, or by virtue of extraordinary powers or privileges conceded to them by the Holy See. Lastly, faculties are general or particular: general, when granted for indeterminate persons, though they may be limited by time; particular, when granted to designated persons or for particular cases. General faculties conceded to bishops and other ordinaries are also called indults. These indults are given for a definite period, e. g. five years (facultates quinquennales), or for a definite number of cases. History The distance of dioceses from Rome, together with peculiar local conditions, rendered the granting of these general faculties a matter of necessity, and in 1637 certain new grants or lists of faculties were drawn up by the Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office. Since then they have been communicated by the Holy See, through the Congregation of the Propagation of the Faith, to bishops, vicars and prefects Apostolic throughout the world, according to their various needs.

It is caused by erosion. It develops when sheets of running water (laminar sheet flows) wash over it in intense rainfall events. It may be thinly covered with fluvial gravel that has washed over it from the foot of mountains produced by cliff retreat erosion. It is typically a concave surface gently sloping away from mountainous desert areas.Easterbrook, Don J. (1999) Surface Processes and Landforms, New Jersey, Prentice Hall It is not to be confused with merged groups of alluvial fans (bajadas), which also may appear to gently slope from an escarpment, but are composed of material eroded from canyons, not bedrock. Three formational zones are recognized for pediments: * An inner most zone of mountainous uplands that have near vertical erosion * An intermediate zone or degradation zone which is the pediment beyond the mountain front. * An outer zone or aggradation zone which extends beyond the pediment and is a zone of deposition. Coalescence of pediments over a large area results in a pediplain.

He described the formation as \\"hills of cut across the upturned edges of tilted beds\\". Gilbert believed the origin of pediments in the Henry Mountains are due to stream and active erosion of deserts. This theory was advocated by Paige (1912), Blackwelder (1931), and Johnson 1932.

The shrine dates back 1,270 years, but the current structure was rebuilt several times due to fire and earthquakes. It is situated in one of the most expensive estate areas of Tokyo. Kanda Shrine was an important shrine to both the warrior class and citizens of Japan, especially during the Edo period, when sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieyasu paid his respects at Kanda Shrine. Due in part to the proximity of the Kanda Shrine to Akihabara, the shrine has become a mecca for technophiles who frequent Akihabara. History Kanda Shrine was first built in the second year of the Tenpy≈ç Era (730 AD), in the fishing village of Shibasaki, near the modern ≈åtemachi district. In order to accommodate the expansion of Edo Castle, the shrine was later moved to the former Kanda ward in 1603, then moved once again to its modern site on a small hill near Akihabara in 1616. The shrine has been rebuilt and restored many times. The current structure was destroyed in the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake and rebuilt in 1934 with concrete, and thus survived the Tokyo firebombing of World War II, unlike many of Japan's historical structures. Restoration is being done on Kanda Shrine, and work continues today. Due to its proximity to the Akihabara Electric Town, the shrine has become a mecca for the technophiles who frequent Akihabara. The Kanda Shrine sells talismans specifically for blessing electronic devices against the types of harm that could come to them. Architecture Zuishin- mon The two-storey main gate, Zuishin-mon (Èö®Á•ûÈñÄ), marks the entrance to Kanda Shrine. Zuishin-mon was reconstructed in 1995 with cypress wood, and is built with an irimoya styled roof. The shrine building is constructed in the Shinto style of Gongen-zukuri. It is painted vermilion, and decorated with gold and lacquered interiors. Many sculptures of its enshrined kami can be found on the building grounds. Enshrined Kami The three major kami enshrined are Daikokuten, Ebisu, and Taira no Masakado. As Daikokuten and Ebisu both belong to the Seven Gods of Fortune, Kanda Shrine is a popular place for businessmen and entrepreneurs to pray for wealth and prosperity. Taira no Masakado was a land-owning government official who led a massive insurrection against the Heian government and declared himself the \\"New Emperor\\" (Êñ∞Áöá). He was later elevated to the status of a local kami out of a mixture of fear and reverence. He is an important figure in the shrine's history. After his defeat in 940 AD, he was decapitated by Fujiwara no Hidesato and his severed head was brought to the Shibasaki (Edo) area in a wooden bucket (È¶ñÊ°∂) and buried on a low hill near the shrine's location today. Locals who respected his defiance, and fearing his curse, enshrined him in Kanda Shrine, and his spirit is said to watch over the surrounding areas. It was rumored that when his shrine fell into disrepair, Masakado's angry spirit wrought natural disasters and plagues upon the nearby lands. It is also said that Tokugawa Ieyasu felt uncomfortable to have his castle built close to such a powerful spirit, and so decided to move Kanda Shrine to its modern location. During the Meiji period, the Emperor Meiji was faced with public pressure to include Kanda Shrine in the , but hesitated to do so because of the shrine's association with Taira no Masakado, who was seen as a dangerous anti-government demagogue. This was temporarily resolved by removing Taira no Masakado as an enshrined kami. However, Masakado's spirit proved so popular amongst the commoners, that it was symbolically returned to the shrine after the Second World War. Festivals Kanda festival (Kanda Matsuri) is one of the three major Shinto festivals of Tokyo, started in 1600 by Tokugawa Ieyasu to celebrate his decisive victory at the battle of Sekigahara. At the time, the festival was important enough to be named a state festival, and its highly decorated mikoshi were paraded down the main streets and into Edo castle, so that even the sh≈çgun could observe the celebrations. Today, it is held in honor of the enshrined kami, and celebrated around May 15 of every odd year. Daikoku festival is also held at Kanda Shrine in January. Cultural references In the anime Love Live! the character Nozomi Tojo serves as a shrine maiden at the Kandamyoujin shrine. Announced via Twitter in early 2015, the administrators of the Kandamyoujin shrine have in turn adopted the character as the official mascot of the shrine.

Rawle suffered a severe ankle injury when a boy, and the bone calloused, leading to the foot being badly deformed. Rawle tightly bandaged the injured foot, which enabled him to play. Rawle was 33 years old when he made his league debut with Essendon in 1923, the second oldest to debut in history behind his teammate Charlie Hardy. He was a late inclusion in the 1923 VFL Grand Final, making Rawle one of just four footballers in history to play in a premiership on debut after Essendon beat Fitzroy by 17 points. The following season he played in another premiership. The reason many Essendon players started their VFL careers late was because the likes of Rawle, Hardy and Syd Barker had been with North Melbourne in the VFA and joined Essendon when North briefly disbanded in 1921. Rawle's case was slightly different, he crossed to the VFA club Essendon (A), also sometimes called Essendon Town, (and no relation to the VFL Essendon), and returned to North Melbourne in 1922 as captain-coach before becoming coach of Essendon's seconds in 1923. His career at North Melbourne had begun in 1911 and he played in their 1914, 1915 and 1918 premierships. After he left Essendon he returned to the VFA as captain-coach of Camberwell for their inaugural season. Rawle's son Keith later became an Essendon premiership player.

The precise meaning has differed over time, and among the Friars Minor, Conventuals, and Capuchins. Description Francis of Assisi sometimes applied the word to any superior in the Order - Guardians, Ministers Provincial, and even to the Minister General.See Rule:Chapters IV & VIII, and his Testament. Sometimes he restricts it to officials presiding over a certain number of friaries in the larger provinces of the Order with restricted powers and subject to their respective Ministers Provincial. It is in this latter sense that he refersRule, VIII. to the custodes as having power, conjointly with the Provincials, to elect and to depose the Minister General. The friaries over which a custos (in this latter sense) presided were collectively called a custody (). The number of custodies in a province varied according to its size. Already at an early period it was deemed expedient that only one of the several custodes of a province should proceed to the General Chapter with his respective Minister Provincial for the election of the Minister General, although the Rule of St. Francis accorded the right of vote to each custos. This custom was approved by Pope Gregory IX in 1230 \\"Quo elongati\\", Bull. Rom., III, 450, Turin edition. and by other popes, evidently with the view to prevent unnecessary expense. The custos thus chosen was called Custos custodum, or, among the Observants until the time of Pope Leo X,\\"Ite et vos\\", Bull. Rom., V, 694. discretus discretorum. This ancient legislation, which has long since ceased in the Order of Friars Minor, still obtained in the Order of Friars Minor Conventuals, in their Constitutions confirmed by Pope Urban VIII. In the Capuchin Order there are two kinds of custodes: Custodes General and Custodes Provincial. Two Custodes General are elected every three years at the provincial chapters. The first of these has a right to vote at the election of the Minister General should a General Chapter be held during his term of office. Besides, he has the obligation of presenting to the General Chapter an official report on the state of his province. The Custodes Provincial, on the contrary, have no voice in the General Chapters, and their rights and duties are much restricted and unimportant. In the Constitutions of the Order of Friars Minor there is also mention of two kinds of custodes: one called custos provinciae, the other custos regiminis. The former is elected at the provincial chapter and holds office for three years. Besides having a voice in all capitular acts of his province he takes part in the General Chapter, should his Minister Provincial be impeded. The custos regiminis is a friar who rules over a custody, or sub-province. He possesses ordinary jurisdiction and has all the rights and privileges of a Minister Provincial. The number of friaries in a custodia regiminis ranges from four to eight. The Custodian of the Holy Land is an appointed office in the Franciscan Order, which is approved by the Vatican.

Early life and education George Rousseau was educated at Amherst College and Princeton University, where he obtained his doctorate. Academic career From 1966 to 1968 George Rousseau was a member of the English Faculty at Harvard University before moving to a professorship at UCLA, and later to the Regius Chair of English at Aberdeen University in Aberdeen, Scotland. He is a frequent contributor to newspapers and magazines. Since then he has been attached to the History Faculty at Oxford University in Oxford, England, where he was the Co-Director of the Centre for the History of Childhood from 2003 until his retirement in 2013.

In the early 1970s, Rousseau put forward the novel thesis - now universally accepted - that the cult of sensibility that was so crucial for the rise of the novel in the eighteenth century was predicated on a series of neurological experiments carried out by the Oxford physician Thomas Willis in the late seventeenth century. One of the most impressive aspects of Rousseau's work was the sheer scale of his engagement with countervailing evidence: there is no better scholar of the history of scepticism about eighteenth-century doctrines of sensibility than George Rousseau.' who works in the interface of literature and medicine, and emphasizes the relevance of imaginative materials - literature, especially diaries and biography, art and architecture, music - for the public understanding of medicine, past and present. and Rousseau is an ongoing member of the Core Team of the Norwegian Research Group in Literature and Science funded by the Norwegian Research Council. and and and This project, funded by a SAMKUL award at the Norwegian Research Council for the period 2016-2021, applies Rousseau's theories of interdisciplinarity to concepts of late style, societies in late development, late Western Capitalism and notions of lateness at large. It endorses the historical and contextual methodologies Rousseau has advocated for decades in the study of literature and other disciplines. It also encourages an interdisciplinary approach to philosophical configurations of human ageing and the newly invigorated concept of the fourth stage of old age, feeding into contemporary ideas of what a good old age should entail.For the award grant and its methodologies see Rousseau is also an executive member of the Edinburgh History of Distributed Cognition project team, sponsored by the Edinburgh Centre for Epistemology, Mind and Normativity and funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council of the United Kingdom. and The Edinburgh project brings together scholars in the humanities and sciences, especially literature and philosophy, medicine and the neurosciences, and is producing a multi-volume history of distributed cognition from the Greeks to the present time. Rousseau's contribution lies primarily in the historical era of the Enlightenment, and follows on from his decades' long commitment to interdisciplinary scholarship covering literature and the sciences, and literature and medicine especially as formulated in the current Medical Humanities. and In 2010 - 2012 Rousseau was the presenter of the Wellcome Collection Event Series in London called 'Tell It To Your Doctor'.

A part of the Dance Dance Revolution series, it was announced in 2008 for Japan and on May 15, 2008 for the North American PlayStation 2. The arcade version was announced on July 7, 2008, July 9, 2008 in Europe, and July 10, 2008 for North America. Released to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Dance Dance Revolution, DDR X sports an improved interface, new music, and new modes of play. The arcade release featured an overhauled (second generation) cabinet design with a widescreen display, e-Amusement and USB access, and an improved sound system. Despite such new design of its arcade cabinet, upgrade kit to change the edition of DDR on its first generation arcade cabinet from SuperNOVA2 (or earlier) to X is also available. The PlayStation 2 release has link ability with the arcade machine, multi-player support over LAN, and other improved and returning features such as EyeToy support. DDR X was called a \\"truly global version\\", with a multi-regional release by all three major Konami houses. Development A pre-release screenshot of Dance Dance Revolution X demonstrating new visual and character designs as well as the game's \\"urban\\" theme. =PlayStation 2= Konami announced the development of Dance Dance Revolution X on May 15, 2008 alongside Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3 and Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 2. DDR X is intended to be released as part of the 10th anniversary of Dance Dance Revolution. Konami promised that at least 70 songs would be featured in this release and that DDR X would bring with it enhanced graphics and new modes of play. Also promised was LAN multi- player support for up to 8 players, an upgraded Workout Mode that will allow players to build their own regimen, new dancing characters and the return of existing features such as EyeToy support. On the same day, Konami released gameplay preview images and video that showcased new graphical content. Three songs, two that had previously premiered on SuperNOVA 2 and its Japanese PS2 version (Poseidon and TimeHollow) and one that was new to the Dance Dance Revolution series, \\"Taj He Spitz\\", were also displayed in this media. During the E3 gaming convention on July 15, 2008, additional information was revealed about the North American PlayStation 2 game, announcing that Dance Dance Revolution X would feature classic gameplay as well as new gameplay. The difficulty rating scale was extended resulting in existing songs in the series being re-rated to compensate. The Shock Arrow feature was also playable. Previously licensed music from earlier DDR series has returned including Me & My's \\"Dub-I-Dub\\" and Smile.dk's \\"Butterfly\\". GameSpot's reporters announced that the game was expected to be released sometime during Fall 2008. Additionally, new gameplay screenshots were revealed at the same time showcasing new features like new and returning dancing characters, a new Workout Mode, LAN network gameplay and returning modes such as Battle, Edit, Training and Street Master Mode. A successor to the previous Master Modes, Street Master Mode is akin to Quest Mode from Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3. Moving across a map, players guide themselves from one dance challenge to the next, meeting new characters and visiting different locales along the way. The game was released on September 16, 2008. In addition to the aforementioned features, the PS2 version also contains \\"Xmixes\\", several nonstop mixes containing several songs each. =Arcade= On July 7, 2008, following a redesign of the Dance Dance Revolution Global Gateway, Konami of Japan announced that Dance Dance Revolution X would be released as an arcade and PlayStation 2 title in Japan as well. Shortly thereafter, on July 9, 2008, Konami sent out a press release to DDRUK (a DDR and music gaming fan community, with a particular emphasis on the European market) that said DDR X would be a \\"truly global version\\", mentioning that the Dancing Stage name would be dropped in favor of Dance Dance Revolution, confirming the game's pending release in Europe as an arcade title. The press release went on to say that the arcade cabinet and hardware would get a fresh, new look and feel. Naoki Maeda, one of the sound producers for the Bemani series, pointed out on his T√ã–ØRA blog that repeated requests from the fans of DDR were partially responsible for the decision to redesign the game's hardware. The new \\"dedicated\\" cabinet. Konami held a private party on July 10, 2008 to showcase the arcade version of Dance Dance Revolution X in Japan, revealing additional information on the upcoming game. Improvements included a widescreen LC display, better sound system, new modes of gameplay, a link system between the arcade and PlayStation 2 version of the game, the ability to publish step edits across all arcade machines via e-Amusement using a standard USB drive and a new type of arrow called a Shock Arrow, one that is to be avoided instead of stepped on. Konami promised that there would be at least 60 new songs featured in DDR X, in addition to having the \\"strongest\\" songs of the Dance Dance Revolution series returning from previous DDR games. Konami also announced the North American DDR X arcade through their DDR Online Community website. Location tests also revealed enhancements to the interface, such as a new \\"screen filter\\" option (which adds a transparent shaded area behind the arrows to improve visibility), a full combo \\"splash\\" effect animation (white for a Marvelous combo, gold for a Perfect combo, and green for a Great combo), and colored combo numbers which indicate the status of a combo colored the same way (which however, was absent on the US PS2 version). An issue of Arcadia Magazine confirmed other details, such as the presence of some of the \\"x-edits\\" and licenses from the US PS2 version, Koko Soko by Smile.dk and announced that there would be a collaboration song with Naoki and Smile.dk present. A post on Konami's development blog website announced that the arcade version of 'Dance Dance Revolution X would be released in Japan on December 24, 2008. A December 20 posting confirmed that songs from the home version DDR Hottest Party would appear on DDR X, demonstrated by a screenshot showing new doubles steps for a song inferred to be from one of the Hottest Party games and a dance stage backdrop from the game. The December 22nd post confirmed that \\"will\\" by Naoki (from the original Hottest Party game) would appear on DDR X, also showing a dance stage from the game branded with the logo of a recently released DDR game. The North American release was prepared at the 2009 ASI Expo in Las Vegas, Nevada in March, which revealed that the game would be released in North America by May, and that e-Amusement service would be available for a monthly subscription on launch. Minor adjustments also revealed included a return to use of the left and right buttons rather than up and down for song selection on the new cabinet, and that changes would be made to the cabinet as well to reduce costs including the removal of some of the lighting. Additional design changes were made for the final cabinet, significantly altered from the designs that had been previously exhibited and released outside of the country. =Japanese PlayStation 2= A PlayStation 2 version of Dance Dance Revolution X was released in Japan on January 29, 2009. It was the final Dance Dance Revolution game released in Japan for the PlayStation 2 . The game features the ability to transfer data between the arcade and PS2 versions such as edits. The Japanese PS2 version will also feature the UI enhancements seen on the arcade version. Pre-order included the game, the combined soundtrack for X and Full Full Party, a DDR X branded 2GB USB flash drive (which can be used with the link features), and other items. Gameplay A pre-release screenshot of Dance Dance Revolution X's \\"Street Master Mode\\" - a mission mode which follows a narrative driven storyline. The gameplay of Dance Dance Revolution X continues the gameplay introduced at the beginning of the series. DDR X contains returning Konami Originals and classic licensed tracks as well as new songs by Konami and label artists. Despite the new overhauled cabinet design available, the dance stage layout remains almost completely unaltered to the original, except in North America, where aesthetic changes were made to cut costs in production. The scoring system from Dance Dance Revolution SuperNOVA 2 is nearly retained in this game. Since the step rating for shock arrow is similar to freeze arrow, their values are the same. The value of each step, jump, freeze, or shock arrow is equal to 1,000,000 divided by (Number of steps [A jump will be considered a step in scoring] + Number of freezes [A pair of freeze that starts and ends at the same time will be considered as one freeze in scoring] + Number of shock arrows [4-way or 8-way]). =Shock Arrows= Shock Arrows are different from normal arrows. They represent white arrows with lightning effects that span across all the arrows, and must be avoided instead of stepped on. Stepping or even holding player's foot on a Shock Arrow results in players losing their combo, part of their life bar and all other arrows disappear momentarily. Avoiding them results in an OK judgment and hitting one results in an N.G., similar to how Freeze Arrows are judged. Only specific songs feature stepcharts containing Shock Arrows, which are marked with an icon on the song select screen and will take up the \\"Challenge\\" difficulty slot.Dance Dance Revolution X first Japanese location test, AM PIA Kawasaki Daisu, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan (July 17, 2008 to July 23, 2008) Shock Arrow charts typically are a copy of the main difficulty stepcharts (Basic, Difficult, or Expert) with some of its steps replaced by Shock Arrows, though recent versions have made its use less traditional. These are similar to the mines from In the Groove. =Difficulty scale changes= The difficulty scale for Dance Dance Revolution X has been changed from previous versions. This is the first full-scale overhaul of the Dance Dance Revolution difficulty rating system since the introduction of the Groove Radar in DDRMAX in 2001. Difficulty ratings ranging from 1 to 10 are shown with yellow blocks, and 11 to 20, overlapping the first ten, in red. Existing songs in the DDR series included in DDR X are re-rated to reflect the new range. No songs, new or otherwise, in X had songs rated higher than 18 (even though the game lets the player rate custom edit data up to maximum), though this trend is broken in recent versions, with the officially-rated 19 song \\"Valkyrie Dimension\\" appearing in DDR X2. =Options= Many new options are introduced in X. More variations of speed options have been added, i.e., x2.5, x3.5, x4, x4.5, x5.5, x6, x6.5, x7, and x7.5. A variation of \\"Cut\\" (\\"On2\\"), have been added which shows 4th and 8th notes only (instead of 4th notes only of the existing one, now renamed \\"On1\\"). \\"Screen Filter\\" option have been added which darkens the screen of the play area for better visibility. The option can be set to \\"Dark\\", \\"Darker\\", or \\"Darkest\\". More \\"Special Arrow\\" options (arrow skin) have been added. Also, all options have been color-coded to indicate whether a player has altered it (white), or not (green) and assigned colors for various difficulties, just like being shown during song selection. Setting of options on Encore Extra Stage is now possible. =Combos= Starting in this game, getting a N.G. in freeze/shock arrows will break the combos (previous versions kept the combos intact). Numeric digits in the number of combos and the word \\"combo\\" are assigned certain color; it applies only to current fragment of combo; its color can be white (with frost surrounding the font) if it contains \\"Marvelous\\" steps only, yellow if it contains \\"Marvelous\\" and/or \\"Perfect\\" steps only, or green if it contains \\"Marvelous\\", \\"Perfect\\", and/or \\"Great\\" steps only. Declaration of \\"Marvelous Full Combo\\" (If all steps are \\"Marvelous\\" only), \\"Perfect Full Combo\\" (If all steps are \\"Marvelous\\" and/or \\"Perfect\\" only), and \\"Full Combo\\" (If all steps are \\"Marvelous\\", \\"Perfect\\", and/or \\"Great\\" only) is conditionally shown before the message \\"Cleared\\" (With matching color for laser beam effect and sunlight effect). The stage result now shows \\"Marvelous Full Combo\\" if the player scores full Marvelous steps (previous games only limits \\"Perfect Full Combo\\" to be shown in results screen). =Edit data= The \\"edit data\\" functionality which was dropped after DDR Extreme has also returned, players are able to make edits with the Japanese PS2 version of Dance Dance Revolution X and play them on the Japanese arcade version. Although the ability to use PlayStation memory cards for edit data between arcade and console versions was present between the special \\"link version\\" of 2nd Mix and Extreme, X utilizes USB flash drives for this functionality rather than PlayStation memory cards. The Japanese PS2 version of Dance Dance Revolution X can export edit data from it, and any other Japanese DDR home version onto a USB drive. In the United States, SD cards will be used for edits instead of USB flash drives. A program will be released for PCs that will allow users to create and share edits to save to these cards. Another new feature of edits is the ability to publish player edits on the arcade machine. Each machine can hold up to one hundred player edits, and the machine eliminates old edit data based on popularity. Konami has also announced that the \\"most popular\\" edits will be chosen on a weekly basis to be published on all X machines connected to Konami's e-Amusement online service. =Extra Stage and Encore Extra Stage= As with SuperNOVA 2, the extra stage is unlocked by getting a AA grade on either: * a song available only on the Final stage - On the Break by Darwin (by getting A or better on any stage prior to the final stage), or * a song picked using Random on Final stage, or * any X-Mix (Appears as final stage song when this is highlighted. Appears on second to final stage when highlighting any song other than X-Mix). The number of lives given on the Extra Stage is the same as that of SuperNOVA2 plus 1 (Except if the score obtained on Final Stage is at least 990,000). The song that will unlock on Extra Stage is SABER WING by TAG; by getting AA on this, the song that will unlock on Encore Extra Stage is Horatio by OR-IF-IS. Unlike previous versions however, different extra stage songs may become available if certain conditions are met. X-Specials, special edits of boss songs from previous versions, can be unlocked for the Extra and Encore Extra Stages by meeting certain criteria based on songs from their respective version. =Characters= A total of 18 characters are available in Dance Dance Revolution X. These include all 14 characters present in the Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova series, though the Concents are now replaced with Louis Concent-III and the Zukins are now replaced with Queen-Zukin. Also revived is Lady, from the first three DDR releases. New characters include Bonnie, Zero and the first arcade appearance of PiX. As with SuperNova 2, each character offers two costumes, including 1stMix costumes for Afro and Lady. =e-Amusement= e-Amusement functionality has increased on Dance Dance Revolution X. Players can now specify rivals, and regional high scores are now displayed before a song begins. Patches for song timing and the unlocking of new songs have also been distributed to machines over the network. e-Amusement service will also be offered outside of Asia for the first time, as US machines will ship with e-Amusement card readers, and arcades will be able to register for a monthly subscription to the service. e-Amusement service for DDR X ended on September 1, 2010. Unfortunately, e-Amusement was never activated in North America. It was said from a Konami representative that a partnership with the Brunswick Zone arcade chain had fallen through and they have yet to find an interested partner for the service. Music Location tests Live testing of the Japanese Dance Dance Revolution X arcade machine started on July 17, 2008 in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan and ended July 23, 2008. The first test location featured a somewhat-complete machine. The machine did not feature many of the music videos that will be in the final version, USB support, or e-Amusement support. Several new Konami tracks were spotted by players, though only one song was seen with the Shock Arrow feature and no licensed tracks had yet been revealed. The second location test in Japan started on July 25, 2008 in Osaka, Japan and ended on July 31, 2008. The second test location featured a new version of the game software with more accurate difficulty ratings, fixes for bugs seen during the first location test, and licensed music. On August 26, Konami announced that a location test for X would be held at Boomers! Parks in Irvine, California. This was the first announced location test of Dance Dance Revolution X for North America. The test began on September 8, 2008 and ran until September 14, 2008. A location test for UBeat was also held alongside the X test. Konami also announced that there would be location testing of Dance Dance Revolution X in the coming months in Europe prior to the arcade machine's global release. Dance Dance Revolution X and UBeat appeared at the 2009 ATEI Expo in London in January 2009, featuring the same build as seen at the Irvine tests. The cabinet used was moved to Trocadero Funland after the expo. Reception The reviews for the PlayStation 2 version of Dance Dance Revolution X were mixed. IGN gave it a 5.4/10, noting that Street Master Mode was neither \\"good or bad\\", noting the dropping of online multiplayer and the previous mission mode and shop system from the previous version. The new announcer was also criticized, stating that it has the \\"most annoying lines, voices, and attitude ever\\". The visuals were also criticized as being blocky, with the UI being described as \\"ugly and unpolished\\". 1UP's Torrey Walker gave the game a C-, describing Street Master Mode as \\"painfully dull and repetitive\\". The soundtrack was described as \\"a clutter of uninspiring off-brand dance tracks, with captivating licensed songs few and far between\\" (citing a poor stepchart for U Can't Touch This), and the announcer was dubbed \\"unintentionally hysterical\\". However, the wide variety of game modes (including workout mode) was mentioned as a plus, and suggested the game as an alternative to Nintendo's Wii Fit. =Cabinet changes in United States= As was stated by Konami at ASI, significant changes were made to the DDR X cabinets released in the United States. In comparison to models that had been exhibited before release, the new cabinets featured different lighting and sound systems, the inclusion of USB ports rather than SD cards as had been previously announced, and a monitor experiencing large amounts of lag. Significant changes to the construction of the pads themselves were also made, including the pad being covered by one piece of metal rather than the traditional design of separate panels (with its connection to the main cabinet covered by a metallic platform), and lower quality sensors in the pads themselves, all implying that the manufacturers cut corners in the construction of the cabinets.

Bundjalung people all share descent from ancestors who once spoke as their first, preferred language one or more of the dialects of the Lower-Richmond branch of the Yugambeh-Bundjalung language family. The Arakwal of Byron Bay count themselves as one of the Bundjalung peoples. Language Bundjalung is a Pama-Nyungan language. It has two unusual features: certain syllables are strongly stressed while others are \\"slurred\\", and it classifies gender into four classes: (a) masculine (b) feminine (c) arboreal and (d) neuter. Country Wollumbin is the mountain range to the north of Mt Warning, his face and form can be seen in the ranges profile, when viewed from the north, near Chinderah According to Norman Tindale, Bundjalung tribal lands encompassed roughly , from the northern side of the Clarence River to the Richmond River, including Ballina with their inland extension running to Tabulam and Baryugil. The coastal Widje horde ventured no further than Rappville. Initiation ceremony According to R. H. Mathews, the Bundjalung rite of transition into manhood began with a cleared space called a walloonggurra some distance from the main camp. On the evening the novices are taken from their mothers around dusk, the men sing their way to this bora ground where a small bullroarer (dhalgu√±gwn) is whirled. Musical instruments The Bundjalung used a variety of instruments including blowing on a eucalyptus leaf, creating a bird-like sound. Clapsticks were used to establish a drumbeat rhythm on ceremonial dancing occasions. Emu callers (short didgeridoos about 30 cm long) were traditionally used by the Bundjalung when hunting (Eastern Australia Coastal Emus). When striking the emu-caller at one end with the open palm it sounds like an emu. This decoy attracts the bird out of the bush making it an easy prey. People Internationally renowned artist Digby Moran (c.1948‚Äì13 January 2020) was a Bundjalung man. His work was frequently exhibited in Germany, and his art is held in regional galleries in Tweed, Lismore and Grafton regional galleries. He was born in Ballina and raised on Cabbage Tree Island, and coastal themes predominated in his artwork. He developed a diamond shape motif in his work, inspired by Bundjalung hunting clubs.

They are located 18 km to the east of Hagemeister Island, and are protected as the Walrus Islands State Game Sanctuary by the state. A part of the island group is also of archaeological importance, with numerous deeply stratified sites covering 6,000 years of human use. For this reason, Crooked Island, Summit Island and Round Island were designated the Walrus Islands Archeological District, a National Historic Landmark District comprising 14 historical sites, in December 2016. In 1968, the Walrus Islands were designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service. Description and history The Walrus Islands consist of a small group of islands and rocky islets extending to the southeast. The main islands are: Summit Island (close to the coast), High Island, Crooked Island, Black Rock Island and Round Island, not to be confused with Round Island (Aleutian Islands). The longest island is Crooked Island with a length of 10 km from north to south. The highest point is 69 m. Administratively these islands belong to the Dillingham Census Area, Alaska. This island group was first explored by Captain James Cook in 1785. The Russian name \\"Morzh\\", meaning \\"walrus\\", was first used by Lt. Sarichev (1826, map 3), IRN (Imperial Russian Navy). Captain Tebenkov applied the name \\"Ostrova Morzhovyye\\" (\\"Walrus Islands\\") to the whole group of islands east of Hagemeister Island (1852, map 4), IRN. Captain Tebenkov also identified Walrus Island with the \\"Ound Island\\" of Capt. Cook (1785, v. 28 p. 431), RN. The Walrus Islands earned their name because of the immense concentration of walruses in the adjacent waters of these islands every summer, the largest concentration being in Round Island, where 14,000 male walruses which have hauled out, have been observed on a single day. The island group forms the Walrus Islands State Game Sanctuary, managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and a permit is required to visit Round Island. On January 11, 2017, President Barack Obama announced the designation of the island group as a National Historic Landmark District.

It is found in Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, and Paraguay. Several subspecies and many forms have been described. The larvae feed on Gramineae (Bambusa and Chusquea meyeriana). Description M. portis is the oldest name for a pretty species, which has generally found its way into collections under the name M. cytheris Godart. M. portis may be regarded as the type of a small group which embraces species with the sexes alike, in contrast to the forms of the adonis group with highly differentiated, multicolored females. The two subspecies can be separated with certainty. M. p. portis H√ºbner according to von B√∂nninghausen is never found in the plains, but only at higher elevations of the Sierra Geral, as at Petr√≥polis and Novo Friburgo in the state of Rio de Janeiro, where it is by no means common. The upper surface differs from that of the southern branch-race in its unusually delicate light blue color, shot throughout with glossy reflections, and which only distally darkens somewhat towards violet. M. p. sidera Fruhstorfer denotes a form without apical ocellus on the underside of the hindwing, which bears pale yellow instead of reddish- brown longitudinal bands on an unusually light ground and in addition has the silver bands nearly twice as broad as in normal M. portis. M. p. thamyris Felder is sufficiently characterized by the broader black border of the forewing and the darker blue gloss of the upper surface, bears beneath somewhat larger and more uniform ocelli, broader and more intensively red- brown longitudinal bands and consequently reduced silver stripes. The female is rather rare, larger than the male, adorned with larger anteterminal and submarginal white crescents and small longitudinal stripes and with the wings more rounded. This elegant Morphid is very local in Sta. Catharina, but common in suitable localities (timber forests overgrown with bamboo and intersected by large rivers), M. p. thamyris flies chiefly in the afternoon from 3 to 4 o'clock, when M. anaxibia is already disappearing into the shade of the woods. The butterflies fly slowly, scarcely 1 to 2 meters above the ground, and are fond of resting with closed wings on bamboo twigs. Also on the high lying country of Lages I met with M. p. thamyris in the damp woods of the valleys and the primeval forests on the Alto Uruguay. Flies principally in March. In Rio Grande according to Mabilde two generations occur, the first flying for 15‚Äì20 days in the spring, the second for nearly a month in the autumn. M. p. psyche Felder of which I have the type before me through the kindness of the directors of the Tring Museum, seems to be due to discoloration. Upper surface darker blue than in M. portis; distal border of the forewing broader, more uniform. Under surface: ocelli as in M. portis, but the silvery longitudinal band suppressed, the wings themselves faded into a lighter brown. Brazil.Fruhstorfer, H., 1913. Family: Morphidae. In A.

There were then a number of reasons for establishing such a distinction. Individual churches might accept or reject parts of doctrine, without forfeiting their claim to rank as parts of the universal Church. Therefore, theologians might find a dogmatic basis for union between separated churches. Also, the arguments of Catholics could be answered in a polemical way. To Protestants, the fundamental articles are those that Christians must believe to be saved. Catholic attacks on this concept have been based on the argument that it is incoherent. Sixteenth century The first to advance the theory seems to have been George Cassander (1513‚Äì66), a Catholic by religion. In his work \\"De officio pii ac publicae tranquilitatis vere amantis viri in hoc religionis dissidio\\" (1561), he maintained that in the articles of the Apostles' Creed we have the true foundations of the Faith; and that those who accept these doctrines, and have no desire to sever themselves from the rest of Christendom are part of the true Church. He believed that thus it might be possible to find a means of reuniting Catholics, Greeks, and Protestants. But the proposal met with no favour on either side. The Louvain professors, Hesselius and Ravesteyn, argued that the theory was irreconcilable with Catholic theology and John Calvin no less vehemently repudiated the system. Among Protestants, however, the view soon reappeared, as a reply to two objections they were constantly called on to meet. When Catholics told them that their total inability to agree amongst themselves was itself a proof that their system was a false one, they could answer that though differing as to non-essentials they were agreed on fundamentals. And when asked how it could be maintained that the whole Christian world had for centuries been sunk in error, they replied that since these errors had not destroyed the fundamentals of the faith, salvation was possible even before the gospel had been preached. It is asserted that the first to take up this standpoint was Antonio de Dominis, once Archbishop of Spalatro, who, during the reign of James I, sojourned some years in England. Certainly from this period the distinction becomes a recognized feature in the polemics of the Church of England, while on the other hand Roman Catholic writers are at pains to show its worthlessness. Knott and Potter The concept fills an important place in the controversy between the Jesuit Edward Knott, and the Laudian Christopher Potter. At this time, the term fundamentals was understood to signify those doctrines necessary, as explicit belief, to salvation. PotterIn his Want of Charity justly charged on all such Romanists as dare affirm that Protestancy destroyeth Salvation (1633), p. 211. says: :\\"By Fundamental doctrines we mean such Catholique verities as are to be distinctly believed by every Christian that shall be saved\\". Knott showed how discrepant were the views of leading Protestants as to what was fundamental. His attack forced his opponents to change their ground. William Chillingworth, who replied to him,In The Religion of Protestants a safe way to Salvation 1637). c. iii.20. while defining fundamental articles in a manner similar to Potter conceded that it was impossible to draw up any list of fundamental doctrines. He urged indeed that this mattered little, since the Bible constitutes the religion of Protestants, and he who accepts the Bible knows that he has accepted all the essentials of the Faith.In The Religion of Protestants a safe way to Salvation 1637). c. iii, n. 59. Calixt The doctrine of fundamentals was destined to become notable not merely in England, but in Germany and France also. In Germany it assumed prominence in connection with the Syncretist dispute. The founder of the Syncretist school was the eminent Lutheran theologian, George Calixt (1586‚Äì1656). A man of wide culture and pacific disposition, he desired to effect a reconciliation between Catholics, Lutherans and Calvinists. In a treatise entitled \\"Desiderium et studium concordiae ecclesiasticae\\" (1650), he argued that the Apostles' Creed, which each of these three religions accepted, contained the fundamental doctrines of the Christian faith, and that the points on which they were at variance were no insuperable bar to union. These differences, he held, might be composed, if it were agreed to accept as revealed truth all that is contained in Scripture, and further all that is taught by the Fathers of the first five centuries. This eirenicon brought down upon him the most vehement attacks from the extreme party of his coreligionists, above all from Calovius, the representative of rigid Lutheranism. It was warmly debated, and proved quite abortive. Bossuet and Jurieu The most famous of the controversies on this subject was that between Bossuet and the Calvinist Jurieu. Jurieu's book, \\"Le Vray Syst√®me de l'Eglise\\" (1686), marks a distinct stage in the development of Protestant theology; while the work in which Bossuet replied to him was effective. \\"Le Vray Systeme\\" was an attempt to demonstrate the right of the French Protestants to rank as members of the Church Universal. With this aim Jurieu propounded an entirely novel theory regarding the Church's essential constitution. According to him all sects without exception are members of Body of Christ. For this nothing is necessary but \\"to belong to a general confederation, to confess Jesus Christ as Son of God, as Saviour of the world, and as Messias; and to receive the Old and New Testaments as the rule and Law of Christians\\", (Syst√®me, p. 53). Yet among the various portions of the Church we must, he tells us, distinguish four classes: # Sects that have retained all the truths taught in the Scriptures # Sects that, while retaining the more important truths, have mingled with them superstitions and errors # Sects that have retained the fundamental truths, but have added doctrines incompatible with them # Sects that have set the fundamental verities aside altogether This last class are dead members of the mystical body (ibid., p. 52). Those who have retained the fundamental articles of the faith are, one and all, living parts of the Church. When he comes to define precisely which in doctrines are, and which are not, fundamental, Jurieu bids us fall back on the rule of Vincent of L√©rins: Quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus. Wherever all bodies of Christians still exist and possess some importance in the world, and agree in accepting a dogma, we have, in that agreement, a criterion that may be considered infallible. Among truths so guaranteed are the doctrine of the Trinity, the Divinity of Jesus Christ, the Redemption, the satisfaction, original sin, creation, grace, the immortality of the soul, the eternity of punishment (ibid, 236-237). This work was followed, in 1688, by another entitled \\"Trait√© de l'unit√© de l'Eglise et des articles fondamentaux\\", written in reply to Nicole's criticisms. In the same year appeared Bossuet's \\"Histoire des Variations des Eglises protestantes\\". The Bishop of Meaux pointed out that this was the third different theory of the Church advanced by Protestant theologians to defend their position. The first reformers had accepted the Scriptural doctrine of an indefectible visible Church. When it was demonstrated that this doctrine was totally incompatible with their denunciation of pre-reformation Christianity, their successors took refuge in the theory of an invisible Church. It had been made patent that this was contrary to the express words of Scripture; and their controversialists had, in consequence, been compelled to look for a new' position. This Jurieu had provided in his theory of a Church founded upon fundamental articles. Jurieu replied; he argued against the main thesis of the \\"variations\\" by contending that changes of dogma had been characteristic of the Christian Church from its earliest days. Bossuet, in his \\"Avertissement aux Protestants sur les lettres de M. Jurieu\\", said that if this were true, then the principle, Quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus - according to Jurieu the criterion of a fundamental article - had ceased to possess the smallest value. (Avertissement, I, n. 22.) In regard to the relation of the fundamental doctrines to salvation, Jurieu is in agreement with the English divines already quoted. \\"By fundamental points\\", he says, \\"we understand certain general principles of the Christian religion, a distinct faith and belief in which are necessary to salvation\\" (Trait√©, p. 495). Precisely the same view is expressed by John Locke in his \\"Reasonableness of Christianity\\". After enumerating what he regards as the fundamental articles of faith, he says: \\"An explicit belief of these is absolutely required of all those to whom the Gospel of Jesus Christ is preached, and salvation through his name proposed\\" (Works, ed., 1740, I, 583). Daniel Waterland (1683-1740) Daniel Waterland's \\"Discourse of Fundamentals\\" is the only work by an Anglican theologian explicitly devoted to this subject. Its professed aim is to determine a basis for intercommunion among various Christian bodies. It dates from 1734-5 and takes a High Church line.Paul Avis, Anglicanism and the Christian Church (2002), pp. 146-7. The treatment is quite academic. Waterland enumerates no less than ten different views on the selection of articles, which he rejects as inadequate. \\"We have\\", he says, \\"almost as many different rules for determinating fundamentals as there are different sects or parties.\\" No one could decide what should be the principle of selection. From this time the topic had less attention from Protestant writers, having in the seventeenth century filled an important place in Protestant theology. Catholic view According to Catholic teaching, the essential note of faith lies in the complete and unhesitating acceptance of the whole depositum on the ground that it is the revealed word of God. The conscious rejection of a single article of this deposit is sufficient to render a man guilty of heresy. The question is not as to the relative importance of the article in question but solely as to whether it has been revealed by God to man. This is clearly put by Thomas Aquinas in the Summa Theologica II-II:5:3: :\\"In a heretic who rejects a single article of the faith, there remains the virtue of faith whether as united with charity [formata], or as severed from charity [informis]. . . The formal object of faith is the Supreme Truth in so far as revealed in the Holy Scriptures and in that doctrine of the Church that proceeds from the Supreme Truth. Hence if anyone does not hold to the doctrine of the Church as to an infallible and divine rule, ... he does not possess the virtue of faith.\\" The Catholic Church does not deny that certain truths are more vital than others. There are some as to which it is important that all the faithful should possess explicit knowledge. In regard to others explicit knowledge is not necessary. But it denies that any Christian may reject or call in question any truth, small or great, revealed by God. The Catholic Church's one and only one test, to determine the question of membership in Christ's body, does not lie in the acceptance of this or that particular doctrine, but in communion with the Apostolic hierarchy. It argues that the theory that finds the one requisite in the acceptance of a series of fundamental articles is a novelty without support in the Church Fathers.

The party Kjuus led was an amalgamation between two anti-immigrant parties, Stop Immigration and Hjelp de fremmede hjem ellers mister vi landet v√•rt (\\"Help the Aliens Back Home or We Will Lose Our Country\\").NORWAY 1998-9 Stephen Roth Institute Stop Immigration Kjuus was born in Oslo. On 15 September 1987 Kjuus founded the political party Stop Immigration. The party was formally registered on 27 April 1988, after having successfully collected the required 3,000 signatures. The first election it contested was the 1989 parliamentary election, where the party received 0.3% of the votes, and thus no parliamentary representation. Racism case In 1995 the anti-immigrant White Electoral Alliance distributed fliers with a party program which among other things called for the forced sterilization of adoptive children from foreign cultures, and sterilization or deportation of the foreign element in a mixed relationship, as well as any children resulting from such relationships. In February 1997, the city court in Oslo convicted Kjuus of violating the criminal law ¬ß135aLovdata which outlaws hateful remarks due to things like skin color. Kjuus was given a 60-day suspended jail sentence and fined 20000 Norwegian kroner.Kjuus tapte i H√∏yesterett (\\"Kjuus lost in the Supreme Court\\") Aftenposten, November 28, 1997 =Supreme Court= Kjuus appealed the case directly to the Supreme Court of Norway who heard the appeal in November 1997. The chief justice Carsten Smith decided that the appeal would be heard with the entire Supreme Court since the case touched upon important questions of principle. Of the nineteen justices on the court, seventeen handled the case. Georg Fredrik Rieber-Mohn was recused from the case since he was formerly the prosecuting attorney who had charged Kjuus while Lars Oftedal Broch was absent due to illness.Rieber-Mohn erkl√¶rte seg inhabil i Kjuus-saken (\\"Rieber-Mohn recused in the Kjuus-case\\") November 4, 1997 The argument from the defense was that the verdict violated Kjuus' right to free speech (constitutionally protected by ¬ß100 in the Norwegian Constitution). Kjuus's attorney John I. Henriksen also argued that the party program did not target any specific ethnic group, and that since Kjuus's party was without any political power, any threats arising from the party program were completely abstract.Adoptivbarn f√∏lger n√∏ye med (Adoptive children are following closely) Aftenposten, November 4, 1997 The appeal was rejected after only five of the seventeen justices voted for acquittal, while twelve voted to uphold the sentence. In fact, the Supreme Court went further, and convicted Kjuus based on all the points the prosecutor had argued were in violation of ¬ß135a. In the city court, Kjuus was only convicted for the part about adoptive children, in the Supreme Court he was also convicted due to the points on foreigners in general. In the majority opinion authored by Karenanne Gussgard, the court opined that the party program called for ethnic cleansing, and that it involved \\"extreme infringements of integrity\\". The dissenting opinion for acquittal was authored by Ketil Lund and supported by four other justices including chief justice Carsten Smith. The dissent agreed that the program was reprehensible, but argued that the free speech protections afforded by the constitutions ¬ß100 should have been given greater weight.Kjuus vant ikke frem i H√∏yesterett (\\"Kjuus did not win in the Supreme Court\\") Aftenposten, November 29, 1997 Reactions to the verdict were mixed, the majority of the Norwegian press, opposed the conviction, and editorials in Aftenposten, Dagbladet and Verdens Gang all argued that reprehensible opinions ought to be met with arguments in open fora instead of with the criminal justice system. Nils √òy of the Association of Norwegian Editors called the verdict a blow against free speech.Kjus-dommen: - Et tap for ytringsfriheten (\\"The Kjuus verdict: A blow to free speech\\") Aftenposten, November 28, 1997 Among the supporters of the verdict was Per Edgar Kokkvold of the Norwegian Press Association who argued that the party program went beyond racist speech and was a plan for ethnic cleansing, and that a line had to be drawn between free speech on the one hand and threats and harassment of minorities on the other. The society for the adopted expressed relief that the basis for the verdict had been expanded.Adoptivbarna glade over kjennelsen Aftenposten, November 28, 1997 =European Court of Human Rights= Kjuus brought his case to the European Court of Human Rights arguing that his freedom of expression, as guaranteed by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, had been violated. The court rejected his claim and cited Article 17 of the convention which forbids using the convention rights in order to seek abolishing or restricting the same rights of others. Hence the court concluded, Article 10 did not protect the advocacy of human rights violations such as racially based forced sterilization programs.

Lyons, Harriet D. Lyons, Irregular Connections: A History of Anthropology and Sexuality (Critical Studies in the History of Anthropology), Paperback Edition, University of Nebraska Press, 2005, pp. 243-249 He was born into a Jewish family in the Banat, Austria- Hungary (now Romania). His family moved to France following World War I. He studied the Malayan language in Paris, completing work at the Institut d'Ethnologie. In 1933 he converted to Catholicism and changed his name to Georges Devereux. At that time, he traveled for the first time to the United States to do fieldwork among the Mohave Indians, completing his doctorate in anthropology at University of California at Berkeley in 1936. In the postwar years, Devereux became a psychoanalyst, working with the Winter Veterans Hospital and Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas. He treated Native Americans by drawing on his anthropology background. A pioneer, he is \\"well regarded among French and American scholars interested in psychoanalytic anthropology\\". Devereux taught at several colleges in the United States, returning to Paris about 1962 at the invitation of anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss. He was appointed as director of studies of Section VI at the noted √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes (EPHE) in Paris, where he worked from 1963 to 1981. In addition, he had a private clinical practice. Devereux published more than 400 texts. In 1993 the Centre George Devereux was founded in his honor at the University of Paris 8 Saint-Denis, to offer care to students and people in the community. His 1951 work, Reality and Dream, about his ethnopsychoanalysis of a Native American Blackfoot man, was adapted as a French film, Jimmy P: Psychotherapy of a Plains Indian (2013), written and directed by Arnaud Desplechin. George Devereux is buried in the Colorado River Indian Tribes (CRIT) cemetery in Parker, Arizona. The land is the CRIT reservation. Biography He was born Gy√∂rgy Dob√≥ in 1908, in Lugoj, the Banat, now in Romania and then part of Austria-Hungary. His family was Hungarian Jewish and bourgeois. His father was a lawyer, and his mother of ethnic German Jewish background. Devereux had a rather difficult relationship with his mother. He said that the \\"insincerity of the adults\\", their \\"lack of respect for the world of the children\\"Bokelmann 1987, S. 10 was a formative experience of his childhood and youth. His cousin was Edward Teller.Edward Teller and Judith Shoolery English, Memoirs: A Twentieth-Century Journey in Science and Politics, 2001, S. 28f. As a youngster growing up in that imperial and cosmopolitan world, and later in France, Dob√≥ learned and spoke four languages: Hungarian, Romanian, German, and French. He studied piano seriously as a youth but, after an unsuccessful operation to correct a problem with his hand, had to give up his dream of performing professionally. His older brother committed suicide. Education and early career in France Following the breakup of Austria-Hungary after World War I, the Dob√≥ family left Romania for France. as a youth, Georgy studied chemistry and physics with Marie Curie in Paris. He was looking for ‚Äòobjective truth‚Äô in physics and 'subjective' truth in music. In his later writings, he often referred to notions taken from the natural sciences. He became ill and had to interrupt his studies. After recovering, Dob√≥ moved to Leipzig, Germany, to begin an apprenticeship in a publishing house. He returned to Paris upon completion and, taking a new direction, he enrolled at the √âcole des langues orientales, known as INALCO, where he studied the Malay language, qualifying in 1931. He became a pupil of Marcel Mauss and Paul Rivet in anthropology, graduating from the Institut d'ethnologie.\\"Devereux, Georges\\", in: G√©rald Gaillard, The Routledge Dictionary of Anthropologists, Psychology Press, 2004, p. 181, accessed 21 August 2014 He also befriended Klaus Mann. During this period, Dob√≥ wrote a novel, Le faune dans l‚Äôenfer bourgeois [The faun in the bourgeois hell], which has not been published. From 1931 to 1935, Dob√≥ worked at the Musee d'histoire naturelle (Natural History Museum) as a junior researcher. After completing his licence √®s lettres (B.A.), he received a grant/scholarship in 1932 from the Rockefeller Foundation in New York to do fieldwork in the United States. Work in the United States He moved to the southwest, doing fieldwork among the Mohave, Hopi, Yuma, and Cocopa in the California, Nevada and Arizona areas. His early days in the United States proved to be difficult. \\"Among the young American anthropologists with whom he collaborated during his preparative stage he encountered only distrust and contempt; when, being asked about his teachers, he mentioned the names Mauss, Rivet and L√©vy-Bruhl, he said.‚ÄùBokelmann 1987, S. 16 Devereux considered his time with the Mohave to have been the happiest of his life. This was the first of five periods when he lived with and studied them. He noted that they paid much attention to their dreams as a culture. He learned how they used interpretation to gain aid from their dreams. He said they \\"converted him to Freud\\".Georges Devereux: Es gibt eine kulturell neutrale Psychotherapie. Gespr√§ch mit Georges Devereux. In: Hans J√ºrgen Heinrichs (hg.): Das Fremde verstehen. Gespr√§che √ºber Alltag, Normalit√§t und Anormalit√§t. Qumran, Frankfurt, Paris 1982, S. 15-32, citation p.20) In 1933 Gy√∂rgy Dob√≥ converted to Catholicism, and adopted the French name of Georges Devereux. As part of his anthropology work, he later traveled to Indochina to live among and study the Sedang Moi. Devereux completed his PhD in anthropology in 1936 at the University of California-Berkeley, working under Alfred Kroeber. Deeply interested in the use of dreams, Devereux decided to study psychoanalysis, still a new field of study in the United States. He was analyzed by Marc Schlumberger and Robert Jokl. He completed his analytical training in 1952 at the Topeka Institute of Psychoanalysis in Kansas, now part of the Menninger Clinic. In the early 21st century, the Clinic moved to Houston and became affiliated with Baylor College of Medicine. From 1945 to 1953 Devereux was associated with the Winter Veterans Hospital in Topeka as ethnologist and research director. He treated and studied several Native Americans suffering from mental illness in this period, including Jimmy Picard, a Blackfoot whom he wrote about. He drew from his anthropology background to treat these men. From 1953 to 1955 Devereux worked in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with children and teenagers at the Devereux School (no relation to him). In 1956 he was appointed as professor of ethnopsychiatry to the medical faculty of Temple University in that city. In 1959 he moved to New York City, where he taught ethnology at Columbia University. In this period, Devereux was finally accepted as a member of the American Psychoanalytic Association and also with the Soci√©t√© psychanalytique de Paris. Return to France On the initiative of noted anthropologist Claude L√©vi- Strauss, who had introduced structuralism to the field, Devereux was invited in 1963 to teach at Section VI of the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes (EPHE) in Paris. Founded after World War II, the new section was devoted to Economic and Social Sciences. He became director of studies, and taught there until 1981. (Since 1975, this section spun off, founding the new √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales (EHESS). His chief work in methodology, From Anxiety to Method in the Behavioral Sciences, was published in 1967. Devereux also worked with private patients, and wrote and published extensively. During the last years of his life, Devereux studied classical Greek history and culture. He published a book about the place of prophetic dreams in Greek tragedies. Methodology In From Anxiety to Method in the Behavioral Sciences, Devereux suggested rethinking the question of the relation between the observer and the observed. He based his concept on psychoanalysis. He believed that the researcher's goal to make his observations from a strictly objective point of view was impossible to practice and could be counterproductive. Instead the observer needed to be in the middle of the process and to keep in mind that whatever he observed was always influenced by his own activity of observing. He recognized that the only data to which the observer had access were his own perceptions, his reaction to reactions he provoked. According to Devereux, the observer must think about his relation to the observed in the same manner as an analyst would do in his relation to his analysand. The analyst works with the transference he triggers and with the countertransference he can perceive from the patient. In any study where the subject relates to the subjectivity of human beings (or even of animals), Devereux believed this process should be used. In addition to using his own experiences, Devereux closely studied Claude L√©vi-Strauss' Tristes tropiques [A World on the Wane], a classic work of his anthropology studies among indigenous peoples in Brazil; Georges Balandiers Afrique ambigu√´ [Ambiguous Africa: Cultures in Collision]; and Condominas' L'Exotique au quotidien. He described these as \\"[‚Ä¶] the only major attempts known to me to appraise the impact of his data and of his scientific activity upon the scientist\\".Georges Devereux, From Anxiety to Method in the Behavioral Sciences, The Hague, Paris. Mouton & Co, 1967 Devereux is considered among the group of French-speaking anthropologists who established new lines of research in the postwar period.\\"Georges Devereux\\", Routledge, p. 292 Together with a former student, Tobie Nathan, he founded the journal, Ethnopsychiatri in the 1970s. Influence According to George Gaillard, Devereux has been more influential in Europe than in North America in terms of ethnopsychiatry. Andrew and Harrit Lyons have assessed him as important in both France and the United States to those interested in psychoanalytic anthropology. Since the late 20th century, numerous American anthropologists have published studies that acknowledge and stress the subjectivity of researchers, noting they are in the middle and influence the work, as Devereux and Levi-Strauss noted. He also applied this insight to psychoanalysis. In France, Tobie Nathan and Marie Rose Moro continue Devereux's ethnopsychiatric work, especially in psychotherapy with immigrants. In Switzerland the second generation of the \\"Zurich School\\" of ethnopsychoanalysis, Mario Erdheim, Maya Nadig, Florence Weiss, etc., has been deeply influenced by Devereux's methodological approach.

Arutyunov, I.I. Krupnik and M.A. Chlenov, Moscow: Nauka. It is thought that the site was used for initiation rituals and for sporting contests, although the local Yupik have a simpler explanation that the island was simply a collective centre for the flensing, butchery and storage of whale meat, an idea supported by the etymology of the Yupik name for Yttygran: Sikliuk, from Siklyugak, meaning \\"meat pit\\" in Yupik. The site is monumental by Chukotkan standards when compared with other early settlements such as Uelen, Ekven, Sireniki and Kivak,Whale Alley: A Site on the Chukchi Peninsula, Siberia, M.A. Chlenov and I.I.

The site extends some 1800 feet (548 metres) along the northern coast of Yttygran IslandAlaska Native Art: Tradition, Innovation, Continuity, S.W. Fair, University of Alaska Press, p.45 and lies on a major whale migration path, and it is thought that the site was chosen partly because of the ease by which local people could kill and butcher a whale and also as a place where people could come together and trade on neutral ground in a forerunner to the fairs held during the period of cossack exploration of the region. There is no evidence of any monumental ritual centre like this elsewhere in any other part of Eskimo lands, though there are sites along the Chukotkan coast where the whale skull motifs can be seen at sites such as Nykhsirak. { - valign=\\"top\\" Ceremonial whale ribs, Whale Bone Alley.

Reski and his coworkers have identified hitherto unknown genes with biotechnological implication for agriculture and forestry. The cultivation of moss cells and their utilization for Molecular Farming is another main focal point of his research. In 1998, Reski proposed the moss Physcomitrella patens as a model plant in biological research. Since then, he has contributed significantly towards mosses becoming a model plant in biological research on a worldwide scale. In 2004, Reski and colleagues from the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan successfully proposed the genome of Physcomitrella patens for complete sequencing at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI), a facility of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).Doe Joint Genome Institute: Why sequence Physcomitrella patens? The genome was released in December 2007, with the bioinformatic work spearheaded by Reski¬¥s group and financed by the German National Science Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG). To date, the Freiburg Chair of Plant Biotechnology hosts an online database of Physcomitrella patens comprising the genomic sequence, annotated gene models and supplemental information.database cosmoss.org Due to its scientific and economic importance, the genome of Physcomitrella patens has been chosen as a \\"flagship plant genome\\" by the DOE JGI in 2010.Hudson Alpha Genome Sequencing Center on flagship plant genomes Also in 1998, Reski and coworkers generated a knockout moss by deleting an ftsZ gene and thus identified the first gene essential in the division of an organelle in any eukaryote. Based on the results of further research on the ftsZ-gene family, Ralf Reski coined the term \\"plastoskeleton\\", analogous to the term \\"cytoskeleton\\", in 2000 and presented a new concept in cell biology of how chloroplasts, the green cell organelles of plants, change shape and divide. In 1999, the chemical company BASF invested more than 30 Mio. DM in a four-year cooperation project with Reski to identify new genes which may be able to make crop plants more resistant to drought, cold and attack by pests. Plants with improved nutritional value (vitamins or polyunsaturated fatty acids) have also been in the research focus of their collaboration. In the same year, Reski invented the moss bioreactorPatent \\"Production of proteinaceous substances\\", on WIPO-database: and founded \\"greenovation Biotech GmbH\\",Homepage greenovation Biotech GmbH, Profile of Ralf Reski a biotechnology company utilizing moss bioreactors for the production of pharmaceuticals.

The IMSC assigns accession numbers that can be used in scientific publications to facilitate identification and availability of the respective samples.IMSC press release University of Freiburg Also in 2010, Reski and colleagues discovered a new mechanism of gene regulation; the epigenetic gene silencing by microRNAs.Discovery: microRNAs can dirtectly turn off genes Reski is directly involved in Mossclone, a European project (7th Framework Programme, FP7) which started in 2012 and aims to develop an air quality monitoring tool by using devitalized moss clones. In 2016, Reski and colleagues identified a homeobox gene as master regulator for embryo development and a basic genetic toolkit for stoma development and in 2017 they described that the moss cuticle was ancestral to lignin evolution.. In 2018, Reski and colleagues analysed the six RecQ proteins in Physcomitrella patens and in Arabidopsis thaliana. They found that moss RecQ4, the ortholog of the human Bloom syndrome protein, acts as a repressor of homologous recombination, protects the genome from mutations, and is pivotal for embryogenesis and subsequent plant development. In contrast, moss RecQ6 acts as a potent enhancer of gene targeting.RecQ Proteins: Masters of Genome Surveillance. The Plant Cell: In a Nutshell.

Note that the term FEL is an ANSI designation (not an acronym). What sets this apart from other lamps used for similar purposes is that it almost literally sets the standard (more precisely, it is the means by which the standard is transmitted from one location to another). Specially seasoned and calibrated FEL lamps are used in laboratories as radiance and irradiance standards (related to luminance and illuminance) used to calibrate photometers, light meters, spectrophotometers and other laboratory instruments. An FEL lamp purchased from NIST that has been calibrated for light output, color temperature, and spectral energy distribution is over ten thousand dollars. NIST Traceable FEL lamps are available from commercial suppliers. Matching sockets for the G9.5 base include Sylvania TP22, TP220, Buhl Electric QEW-2, QEW-21, QEW-22, Bender + Wirth 968, Ushio: C-3, C-3(A). The calibration lamps are generally modified to use a larger bi-post base that fits into special kinematic mount sockets for precise optical alignment. Although the socket for calibration lamps is not polarized, polarity must be observed because the calibration lamps are normally run on DC and the lamp filament will recrystallize according to the applied DC polarity.

It mostly serves as a park and ride station for commuters from Tr√∏gstad. History Discussion of a railway through Eidsberg was first debated in the municipal council on 5 January 1867. The municipality approved a grant of 20,000 Norwegian speciedaler on 25 January 1873.Thoresen: 33 After it was decided in 1873 that the √òstfold Line was to be built, the main route controversy regarding the Eastern Line was whether it should run via Mysen, or take a straight line from Askim to Rakkestad. The railway engineers originally favored a bypass, but this was overruled by Parliament on 4 June 1874.Lang√•rd & Ruud: 23 Eidsberg was granted three stations. While there was much spectacle about the location of the other two, Mysen and Eidsberg, there was little debate about the location of Slitu.Thoresen: 34 The station and line opened on 24 November 1882,Bjerke & Holom: 50 although temporary traffic had taken place since July.

This compared for instance with almost 800 at Mysen Station. Four station were therefore closed down on the line, including the next one westwards, Askim N√¶ringspark Station.

Career Her debut book, In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz (2001), covers the time she has spent in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) as it transitioned from the leadership of Mobutu Sese Seko to that of Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila. Her second book, I Didn't Do It For You: How the World Betrayed a Small African Nation (2004), is the story of Eritrea and its existence through Italian, British, American and Ethiopian occupation. Her third book, It's Our Turn to Eat: The Story of a Kenyan Whistle-Blower (2009), tells the story of John Githongo, a Kenyan journalist and civil society activist who, in 2002, took on a senior anti-corruption role within the newly elected government of President Mwai Kibaki. In this role, Githongo uncovered widespread evidence of corruption (notably the Anglo-Leasing scandal) located high up within the Kibaki government. The book also discusses the role of ethnicity in Kenyan politics and is strongly critical of the response of the international aid community to the Githongo case. The World Bank and the British government's aid department (the Department for International Development) come in for particularly strong criticism, though notable exceptions are also highlighted, such as Edward Clay, the then British High Commissioner to Kenya. It's Our Turn to Eat was censored in Kenya, leading to PEN Kenya president and activist Philo Ikonya acquiring books and bringing them into the country for wider distribution.

History The Economy of New Zealand is a market economy which is greatly dependent on international trade, mainly with Australia, the United States of America, China and Japan. It is strongly dependent on tourism and agricultural exports, and has only small manufacturing and high-tech components. Economic free- market reforms of the last decades have removed many barriers to foreign investment, and the World Bank has praised New Zealand as being the most business-friendly country in the world . Regional and bilateral free trade agreements have become an important part of New Zealand's international trade policy. New Zealand has used free trade agreements also known as closer economic partnerships to liberalise trade between economies. A Closer Economic Partnership Agreement with Thailand was negotiated in 2004 and implemented in 2005. Negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement with Chile, Brunei and Singapore known as the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership were concluded in 2005. Negotiations for further agreements with Malaysia were undertaken in 2006, but failed to reach a conclusion. The historic FTA with China was signed in Beijing in April 2008. On 27 February 2009 New Zealand and its close partner Australia signed a Free Trade Agreement with the ASEAN regional block of 10 countries.

However, some that switched affiliations did follow the schedule. =Monday‚ÄìFriday= { class=wikitable !bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Network !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"6:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"6:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"7:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"7:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"8:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"8:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"9:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"9:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"10:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"10:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"11:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"11:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"noon !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"12:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"1:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"1:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"2:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"2:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"3:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"3:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"4:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"4:30 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"5:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"5:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"6:00 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"6:30 pm - !bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\" colspan=\\"2\\"ABC bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"2\\"ABC World News This Morning bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Good Morning America bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Local/syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"yellow\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Mike and Maty bgcolor=\\"white\\" Local/syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" Loving bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"All My Children bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"One Life to Live bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"General Hospital bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"5\\"Local/syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"1\\"ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings - !bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\" colspan=\\"2\\"CBS bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"2\\"CBS Morning News bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"4\\"CBS This Morning bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Local/syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"pink\\" colspan=\\"2\\"The Price is Right bgcolor=\\"white\\"Local/syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"The Young and the Restless bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\"The Bold and the Beautiful bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"As the World Turns bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Guiding Light bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"5\\"Local/syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"gold\\"CBS Evening News - !bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"NBC !

Built in 1876, the Temple of Israel is the oldest synagogue in North Carolina and one of the earliest Reform synagogues in the American South. Temple of Israel is led by Rabbi Emily Losben-Ostrov. History Sephardic Jews first arrived in North Carolina during the early 18th century. By 1852, a Jewish Burial Society was formed in Wilmington with a Hebrew cemetery opening in 1855. An Orthodox Jewish congregation was formed in 1867, but did not succeed. In 1872, a Reform congregation was started by German Jews and their synagogue, the Temple of Israel, was dedicated on May 12, 1876. Princeton All American football player and World War I hero Arthur Bluethenthal was a member of the synagogue. Architecture The Temple of Israel's architecture is a combination of Greek Revival and Moorish styles. The Moorish architecture is unique in the city of Wilmington, but was common during late 19th century for many American synagogues. The synagogue features horseshoe arches and twin towers topped with golden onion domes. The building's exterior was restored in 1982, 2000 and 2013.

Maley is Professor of Renaissance Studies at the University of Glasgow, Fellow of the English Association (FEA), and founder, with Philip Hobsbaum, of Glasgow's Creative Writing programme. He is a prolific author on subjects including early modern English literature from Spenser to Milton, and on modern Scottish and Irish writing. Biography Willy Maley is the seventh of nine children, and the first in his family to go to University. He was raised in the district of Possilpark, Glasgow. Maley's father, James Maley, was a former Communist Party member and veteran of the Spanish Civil War, who borrowed books weekly from Gilmorehill Book Exchange and other sources. Maley grew up in a modest family home, one where there were no limits on what was read, from American Pulp to the collected works of Marx and Lenin, from Enid Blyton to Joseph Stalin, and the classics in-between. Education Maley left Possilpark Secondary in 1978 and worked for three years, for Strathclyde Regional Council's Roads Department, the Royal Bank of Scotland, and Glasgow City Libraries before gaining through night classes the qualifications to start at the University of Strathclyde in 1981. He went there initially to study librarianship but failed, resigned from the libraries, and continued with his studies in English Literature and Politics. Maley graduated from Strathclyde with First Class Honours with Distinction, winning the Meston Prize for top degree result in academic year. In October 1985, after a summer working at the British Film Institute in London, Maley went to Jesus College, Cambridge, earning a PhD for his thesis, Marx and Spenser: Elizabeth and the Problem of Imperial Power, which was later renamed Edmund Spenser and Cultural Identity in Early Modern Ireland. In 1990 Maley also completed a Diploma in Linguistics for the Teaching of English Language and Literature at the University of Strathclyde. Career Between 1989 and 1995 Maley had eight plays performed at Glasgow's Mayfest and at the Edinburgh Fringe, as well as the West Yorkshire Playhouse, the Lemon Tree in Aberdeen, the Magnum Centre in Irvine and most of Glasgow's main theatres, including The Arches, The Old Athenaeum, The Pavilion, and The Tron. Maley's theatre credits include: * From The Calton to Catalonia (1990), a dramatized account of his father's experiences as a POW during the Spanish Civil War, co-written with his brother, John Maley. * No Mean Fighter (1992), a unique collaboration between students at the RSAMD and inmates at Barlinnie Special Unit, which won a Scotsman Fringe First at the Edinburgh Festival. * The Lions of Lisbon (1992), the story of Celtic's 1967 European Cup victory, co-written with Iain Auld,The Sunday Times; \\"All the nation's a stage at Mayfest\\", 17 May 1992. From 1992‚Äì94, Willy Maley worked as a lecturer at the University of London (at Goldsmiths and Queen Mary respectively). In 1994 he moved to Glasgow University, where he was founder in 1995, with Philip Hobsbaum, of the Creative Writing Master's program. In 1997 he published three books on literary criticism and the following year and edited the Blackwell Companion to Renaissance Writing, and published a compilation of essays on James Kelman.The Sunday Times; \\"New faces\\", 4 January 1998. Maley was promoted to Reader in 1998, and to Professor in 1999. To the question of how he went from drawing income support in Possilpark in 1991 to Professor of Renaissance Studies at the University of Glasgow in eight years, Maley replied: \\"You mean, What took me so long? I was busy.\\" Willy Maley has taught at Dartmouth College and the University of Sunderland. He was the first recipient of the Gerard Manley Hopkins Visiting Professorship at John Carroll University in Cleveland (1998). In 2003, Maley was presented with the Lifting Up the World Award by Sri Chinmoy at a ceremony at Edinburgh University. During seasons 2003‚Äì04, and 2004‚Äì05, Maley was a columnist for the Celtic View, the official magazine of Celtic Football Club, which he has supported since childhood. Maley has also worked extensively‚Äìbut not expensively‚Äìin radio, television and film since 1985, when he was credited as Assistant Production Accountant on Derek Jarman's film Caravaggio.

The storm caused significant rainfall, with over 9.7 inches of rain falling at the most in Haiti, and 10 inches falling at the most in the Dominican Republic. These floods were caused by over two weeks of persistent rain in the Caribbean area, which eventually caused the landslides that killed many people. The floods caused much damage in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with over 1,300 homes being destroyed and about 2,000 people being killed. Due to this destruction, nearly 15,000 people were displaced with nowhere to live. The area that felt the worst of the flooding was the town of Jiman√≠, near the border of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. In fact, the destruction present at Jiman√≠ was so bad that Dominican president Hipolito Mejia declared a national day of mourning after seeing the effects of the storm. Meteorological history A broad low pressure area developed over Central America on May 19, accompanied by heavy rainfall. The system drifted eastward into the Caribbean Sea, and by May 23 was located in the central Caribbean, producing rainfall across Jamaica, eastern Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. Upper-level winds prevented tropical cyclogenesis of the system. However, the low had characteristics of a subtropical cyclone, with a closed atmospheric circulation and extensive convection extending to the northeast of the system. The interaction between the low and a high pressure area over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean produced winds of around across the region. The system moved slowly across the Greater Antilles. By early on May 24, the low was located south of Haiti and was interacting with a tropical wave. Later that day, the system moved over southwestern Haiti, crossing into the Bahamas by May 25. Later that day, the National Hurricane Center briefly noted the possibility of the system developing into a tropical cyclone, noting its well-defined circulation. Although there was a lack of convection near the center, there was a potential for the shear to diminish. However, by late on May 26, the system no longer had a chance for development after it began moving quickly to the northeast. By May 27, the system was located about 190 mi (305 km) east of Bermuda, connected to a trough that extended to Hispaniola.

A shorter version for simple aircraft is BMFFH; many variations exist for different aircraft types.Thom 1988, p. 219. The checklist Many of the steps in the pre-landing checklist are double-checks to eliminate the possibility of unexpected failure of the aircraft. Other steps convert the aircraft from a configuration that is optimised for economical flight to one that is safe for landing. Since landing is the most dangerous stage of a flight, it is important to be pre-warned if an engine failure may be likely to occur or to deal with any problem at this point.

In some contexts, courtesy title is used to mean the more general concept of a title or honorific such as Mr., Mrs., Ms., Dr., Miss, Sir, and Madam. Europe In Europe, including France, many titles are not substantive titles but remain titres de courtoisie, and, as such, are adopted unilaterally. When done by a genuine member of the noblesse d'√©p√©e the custom was tolerated in French society. A common practice is title declension, when cadet males of noble families, especially landed aristocracy, may assume a lower courtesy title than that legally borne by the head of their family, even though lacking a titled seigneury themselves. For example, the eldest son of the Duke of Paris (substantive title) may be called Marquis de Paris (courtesy title) and younger sons Comte N. of Paris, where N. stands for the first name. In the hereditary Napoleonic and Restoration peerage, declension was a legal right of younger sons, the derivative title being heritable by male primogeniture, King Joseph Napoleon conferred the title ‚ÄúPrince‚Äù on his grandchildren in the male and female line. = Ancien R√©gime =  Courtesy title as principal title  During the ancien r√©gime the only substantive titles were feudal, land-based and required a royal grant or royal recognition. In order to use the title of count, one had to own a seigneurie elevated to county and to comply with the remainder of the grant. These legal prescriptions, however, came to be consistently enforced only with respect to the title of duke (duc). Most titles were self-assumed courtesy titles, even those used at the royal court and in legal documents. The clergymen before the episcopal ordination used the title of abb√©, followed by the name of the principal title of their father. Members of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta used the title chevalier in the same fashion.  Courtesy title used by sons and daughters  The heir apparent of a titled nobleman used one of the lesser titles of his father as a courtesy title. In the 17th century, the heirs of the most powerful dukes were sometimes allowed to assume the title of prince. In the 18th, a trend was for the heir to use the title of duke. It was achieved in one of three ways: The head of family may have two dukedoms and his heir could use the junior one; the head of family could resign his French peerage to his heir, who assumed a new title of duke while the father retained his ducal title; the king could confer a brevet de duc, that is formally accord the non-hereditary style and precedence of a duke to the heir of a ducal title. The younger sons of a noble titleholder used one of the family's lesser titles, but rarely one of duke or prince. Even in untitled families of the nobility, every son used a different territorial designation, the so- called nom de terre. The daughters used the title of mademoiselle, followed by the name of a manor owned by their father. For example, Anne Marie Louise d'Orl√©ans, Duchess of Montpensier known as La Grande Mademoiselle, was the eldest daughter of Gaston d'Orl√©ans (Monsieur) and his first wife Marie de Bourbon, Duchess of Montpensier. Anne Marie Louise was officially known as Mademoiselle from the time of her birth.  United Kingdom  The United Kingdom has a detailed system of courtesy titles and styles by which the eldest son, male-line grandson or great-grandson and heir of a peer may use a subsidiary title of his ancestor even though it is the ancestor who holds the title substantively. By extension, the children not only of all peers but of those who bear derivative courtesy titles as male-line descendants of a substantive peer bear specific titles (Lord/Lady) or styles (The Honourable) by courtesy. Under United Kingdom law, users of courtesy titles of nobility have nonetheless been held to be commoners, eligible for election to the House of Commons rather than the House of Lords.

History John Stevens was born in Oxfordshire, England. He immigrated to the American Colonies in 1698 and lived in Boston for several years before moving to Newport, where he set up shop at 30 Thames Street in 1705. The shop moved across the street to 29 Thames Street in the mid-eighteenth century. John Stevens, his sons John II and William, and his grandson John III produced what are arguably some of colonial America's most beautiful gravestones, many of which still sit in the nearby Common Burying Ground. The Stevens family ran the Shop for more than 220 years. In 1927, it was purchased by John Howard Benson. A Newport native, Benson studied at the Newport Art Association, the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League of New York. He became an internationally renowned stone carver, designer and calligrapher. He taught at the Rhode Island School of Design and, along with his business partner, Graham Carey, wrote the instructional book \\"The Elements of Lettering\\". He designed and carved inscriptions for Yale University, Harvard University and Brown University, and designed the inscriptions on the Iwo Jima Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery. In 1955, he was awarded the Craftsmanship medal by the American Institute of Architects. He died in 1956, passing the business to his son John Everett Benson. The younger Benson began working for his father at 15. He studied sculpture at the Rhode Island School of Design. In 1964, he was commissioned to design and carve the inscriptions for the John F. Kennedy Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery. He carved gravestones for Tennessee Williams, Lillian Hellman and George Balanchine; designed and carved inscriptions for the Prudential Center in Boston, the Boston Public Library, the National Gallery of Art, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Center and the Armand Hammer Museum of Art in Los Angeles; and carved the date stones of the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, D.C. He designed site- specific fonts and incised inscriptions on the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama; the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington, D.C.; and the Federal Courthouse in Boston. During his 40 years at the John Stevens Shop, Benson was awarded the Craftsmanship medal by the American Institute of Architects, the National Pell Award for Distinguished Achievement in the Arts and he was awarded an honorary Doctorate degree by the Rhode Island School of Design. In 2000, he received the Presidential Design Award for Excellence in the Arts for his work on the FDR Memorial. In 1993, he turned over the business to his son Nicholas Benson, who continues to produce hand-carved inscriptions in stone. In 2007, Nicholas Benson was awarded the National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellowship and in 2010 he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.

Biomechanical‚Äôs existence started back in April 1999 by the founding member John K who wrote, recorded and arranged all of the music, with the exception of the songs ‚ÄòExistenz‚Äô and ‚ÄòSurvival‚Äô which were co-written by Chris Webb and Jamie Hunt respectively. The lyrics were written by Adam Rose (Eight Moons) and John K & Jon Collins (Empires of the worlds & Cannibalised). Biomechanical started as a lifelong goal for singer/songwriter John K who envisioned connected concept albums telling a unified narrative. The albums were released as Eight Moons, The Empires of the Worlds and Cannibalised. After the release of Eight Moons via Revolver Records the owner of Elitist Records Lee Barrett approached Biomechanical and after negotiations, all parties agreed and signed with Earache/Elitist Records on 3 September 2004. Biomechanical toured Europe with Decapitated, Stampin Ground, Exodus, 3 Inches of Blood and opened for Shadow's Fall and Nevermore for the promotion of the band‚Äôs second album The Empires of the Worlds which was produced by Andy Sneap. John K wrote the third installment titled Cannibalised in 2006‚Äì7 and also like the last two albums, he engineered the recordings. Chris Tsangarides took the production duties and mixed the album in the summer of 2007. The mastering took place at the Close to the Edge Studios and was done by Jon Ashley.

On 6 May 1848, when the king of Sardinia, Carlo Alberto, sent I Corps of the Sardinian army to assault the fortified positions held before the walls of Verona by the Austrian army under field marshal Josef Radetzky. The Austrian army, though outnumbered, managed to withstand the attack and hold their positions. The battle is named after the Santa Lucia district of Verona. Franz Joseph (then only 17 years old) assisted at the battle. Context =Scope of hostilities= On 18 March 1848, revolt broke out in Milan. The commander of the Lombard‚ÄìVenetian army, field marshal Josef Radetzky, had excited the rebellion but did not know how to crush it and was forced to abandon the city of fierce fighting. At the same time many other cities in Lombardy‚ÄìVenetia and at Como the entire garrison went over to the insurgents. After the battle peace was restored to the region in 1849. =Battle of Pastrengo= Austrian strategic weakness =Radetzky's impasse= Assembled inside Verona there was still a considerable force, protected by valid fortifications: however, Austrian troops were demotivated after the first defeats (excepting the victory of 11 April over ill-equipped Lombard volunteers nearly Cortenuovo, followed by the killings of nearly 113 civilians).G. Solinas. Storia di Verona. Verona, Centro Rinascita, 1981. p.420 In addition, the possibility of receiving help from General Nugent's troops through Isonzo was barricaded by the presence of Italian rebels in Palmanova, Osoppo and Venice. To make Radetzky situation even worse, political situation after repression of Austrian Revolution led many observers to doubt about the field-marshal's capacity in maintaining order, and he was labeled as a conservative monarchist by public liberal opinion. =Advance= Advance begins on 6 May, hampered by Sardinians' little knowledge of territory, and only the central column reached enemy (while on right, Bava divisions lost contact with the rest of Sardinian army).Carlo Cattaneo, Considerazioni sul 1848, 1949, Einaudi, Torino.

He is known for his book The Worm Forgives the Plough based on his wartime experience working in the Land Army in the Second World War. Early life, biographer The son of an Irish solicitor, Collis was born at Kilmore, Killiney on the borders of County Dublin and County Wicklow, Ireland. He was educated at Bray preparatory school, Rugby School and Balliol College, Oxford. At the Oxford Union he learnt the art of public speaking, hearing politicians and authors including H. H. Asquith, G. K. Chesterton, Lloyd George and W. B. Yeats in the debating chamber. In the 1920s he became a close friend of the Guernsey-born G.B. Edwards, who lodged at his flat in Guildford Street. Both men became prot√©g√©s of John Middleton Murry and contributed to The Adelphi magazine but later drifted apart.Edward Chaney, Genius Friend: G.B. Edwards and The Book of Ebenezer Le Page, (Blue Ormer Publishing, 2015) Collis, however, wrote an enthusiastic review of Edwards's The Book of Ebenezer Le Page in the Spectator when this novel was posthumously published in 1981.J.S. Collis, 'Memories of a Genius Friend', The Spectator, 31 July 1982. Collis's first book, a biography of George Bernard Shaw, was published in 1925, followed by biographies of Havelock Ellis, August Strindberg, Leo Tolstoy, the Carlyles and Christopher Columbus.The Oxford Companion to English Literature, ed. Margaret Drabble Country writing Collis is remembered largely for While Following the Plough (1946) and Down to Earth (1947: as one volume, The Worm Forgives the Plough, 1973). While Following the Plough was inspired by the years he chose to spend working as a farm labourer in the Land Army (which mainly consisted of women, known as \\"land girls\\") in Sussex and Dorset during the Second World War. He worked at J. G. Maynard's farm at Stonegate in Sussex in 1940 for a year, and then moved to Tarrant Hinton in Dorset for the rest of the war. The manuscript of the book was rejected by twelve publishers. At last, Jonathan Cape accepted it, but requested much revision. Collis waited for a while and returned the manuscript largely unchanged, thanking the publisher for their suggestions; Jonathan Cape answered saying they were \\"delighted with the improvements\\". Down to Earth was inspired by the year he spent working for Rolf Gardiner after the war, thinning a fourteen-acre wood on his own, using only an axe and other hand tools. Reception The novelist Margaret Drabble states that Collis wrote with imagination and authenticity about rural life, and that Collis's autobiography Bound upon a Course brought him belated recognition as a pioneer in the ecology movement. The travel writer Robert Macfarlane praises his country writing as follows: The biographer Michael Holroyd comments that While Following the Plough and Down to Earth were \\"acclaimed on their appearance\\", and are now considered classics.

It determined the champion of the PCC for the 1943 season; the USC Trojans shut out the Washington Huskies 29‚Äì0 in a one-sided game. USC backup quarterback Jim Hardy threw three touchdown passes to lead the Trojans to their seventh Rose Bowl victory and eighth PCC championship. For the first time, the Rose Bowl was broadcast on the radio abroad to all American servicemen, with General Eisenhower in Western Europe allowing all troops who were not on the front lines to tune in and listen.

They played Whitman College, Spokane Air Command (twice), and the March Field Flyers. The Rose Bowl was the Huskies' sole conference game of the season; the three teams of the Southern Division (USC, UCLA, California) played each other twice; Stanford was on hiatus until the 1946 season.

It was launched by the Mall Galleries in 2008. The prize is open to any artist, eighteen or over, who is living or working in the UK or Continental Europe. Background The Threadneedle Prize was launched in 2008 to support the popular interest in figurative art. It was organised by the Federation of British Artists and offered a prize of ¬£25,000. The new competition coincided with a move by the rival Turner Prize away from painting and sculpture and, in some eyes, becoming \\"trivial and dull\\". Art critic Brian Sewell welcomed the new prize, though complained that the majority of entries were disappointing, concluding that the \\"new prize is capable of achieving a greater good than any other, but it must, without becoming quite as predictable as the Turner Prize... achieve next year a far higher level of distinction.\\" In 2009 almost half of the 80 final exhibits at the Mall Galleries were portrait paintings, in a wide variety of styles. By 2013 the number of exhibits had increased to 111, chosen from over 3,500 entries.  Prizes  In the first year of the competition there was a single prize of ¬£25,000. In 2010 the Visitors‚Äô Choice Prize, worth ¬£10,000, was introduced. The two major prizes available are the Threadneedle Prize and the Visitor‚Äô Choice Prize. In 2012 the Threadneedle Prize was increased from ¬£25,000 to ¬£30,000 making it the largest prize for single work of art in the UK. For the Threadneedle Prize, a panel of selectors shortlist six works and then choose the winner of the ¬£30,000 prize. Two finalists for the Visitors' Choice Prize are awarded ¬£500. Each of the five finalists for the Threadneedle Prize receives ¬£1,000. In 2013 there are eight prizes totalling ¬£46,000. Selectors have included artists, critics and curators Peter Randall-Page, Ed Vaizey, Michael Sandle, Jock McFadyen, Daphne Todd, Richard Cork and Desmond Shawe-Taylor. In 2016, the ¬£20,000 winner - Salt in Tea by Lewis Hazelwood-Horner - was also named the winner of the ¬£10,000 Visitors' Choice Award.

He served as Bishop of Lausanne and Geneva from 1883 to 1891, having previously served as Titular Bishop of Hebron. He was made a cardinal in 1890. Early life and education Gaspard Mermillod was born on September 22, 1824, in Carouge, Switzerland. He was the eldest of six children of Jacques Mermillod and Mermillod (n√©e M√©gard) Mermillod, both born of farming families of a neighboring village of Bardonnex. His parents operated an inn and a bakery. Gaspard attended the minor Seminary of Saint- Louis du Mont (1837-1841) at Chamb√©ry, France and studied philosophy and theology at the Jesuit Coll√®ge Saint-Michel (1841-1847) at Fribourg, Switzerland. Priesthood In June 1847, Gaspard was ordained to the priesthood and was appointed curate in Geneva, where he established two periodicals: L'observateur Catholique and Les Annales Catholiques. In 1857, he became a parish priest and at the same time, Vicar-General of the Bishop of Lausanne for the canton of Geneva. The Church of Notre-Dame in Geneva was built by him from 1851 to 1859. Episcopal career (Catholic church) =Auxiliary Bishop of Lausanne and Geneva= Gaspard was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of the Diocese of Lausanne and Geneva and Titular Bishop of Hebron, by Pope Pius IX, on September 22, 1864. He received his episcopal consecration on the September 25, 1864. He was especially active for Catholic education, founding with Blessed Fr. Louis Brisson and Saint L√©onie Aviat the Oblate Sisters of St. Francis de Sales at Troyes, for the protection of poor working girls. On October 30, 1868, Leonie with one of her former boarding school companions, received the habit of this new congregation from Bishop Mermillod.L√©onie Fran√ßoise De Sales Aviat (1844-1914) In 1873, Bishop Etienne Marilley of Lausanne and Geneva, renounced the title of the See of Geneva, in the Calvinist Canton of Geneva. With that action, the Holy See, Pius IX, appointed Bishop Gaspard as Vicar-Apostolic of Geneva, thus officially detaching the Canton of Geneva from the Diocese of Lausanne and Geneva and making it territory directly under the Papal Authority. As this was not recognized by either the State Council of Geneva or the Swiss Federal Council, Bishop Mermillod was forbidden to exercise any episcopal functions and was banished from Switzerland, by a decree of February 17, 1873. In his banishment to Ferney, in French territory, he governed his Vicariate Apostolic of Geneva, as best he could. After the Holy See condemned this banishment decree, the government responded on December 12, 1873 by expelling the papal nuncio. After Bishop Marilley had resigned his diocese in 1879, Monsignor Christophore Cosandey, provost at the Seminary in Fribourg, was elected Bishop to a re- unified Diocese of Lausanne and Geneva, thus the newly elected Pope Leo XIII ended the Vicariate Apostolic of Geneva. The conflict with the Canton of Geneva ended and the decree of expulsion against Mermillod was revoked. =Bishop of Lausanne and Geneva= Upon the death of Bishop Cosandey in October 1882, Gaspard returned to Switzerland and was appointed Bishop of Lausanne and Geneva on March 15, 1883. The conflict was by no means at an end, for the Canton of Geneva refused to recognize him as bishop. Relations resumed as normal only when Leo XIII elevated him to Cardinal-Priest of Santi Nereo ed Achilleo on June 23, 1890. Bishop Mermillod was especially a major player in the history of the Social Doctrine of the Church. Encouraged by his friend, Ren√© de La Tour du Pin, he founded the Union of Fribourg, which included some of the biggest names in Social Catholicism of the time (Swiss: Gaspard Decurtins; French: Ren√© de La Tour du Pin, Albert de Mun, Louis Milcent, and Henri Lorin; Austrian: Karl von Vogelsang and Gustave Blome; and German: Franz Kuefstein) whose work on the \\"social question\\" form the base of the encyclical of Leo XIII, Rerum novarum.Spiritualit√© 2000 : L'union de Fribourg. L‚Äôinternationale catholique de la question ouvri√®re Retirement and Death In March 1891, Cardinal Mermillod resigned the pastoral government of the Diocese of Lausanne and Geneva, and Monsignor Joseph D√©ruaz was named his successor. Upon this resignation, he relocated to Rome, where he eventually died on February 23, 1892. He was laid in repose, in the church of Ss. Vicenzo ed Anastasio a Trevi and buried in the Carthusian Chapel, Campo Verano Cemetery, Rome. His body was eventually transferred, in 1926, to the parish church of Saint-Croix in Carouge. A street in the town of Carouge was named in his honour. Works His Lettres √† un Protestant sur l'autorit√© de l'√©glise et le schisme (Paris, 1860) made a great impression. Another important work was his \\"De la vie surnaturelle dans les ames\\" (Lyons, 1865; Paris, 1881). His collected works were edited by Grospellier (Paris, 1893) in three volumes.

After teaching himself to skate, and then play to a reasonable standard, he began to play for the Telford Wild Foxes in the English Premier Ice Hockey League. His first season was an excellent one, and in 33 games scored 14 goals and 12 assists as well as totalling 34 penalty minutes. He would start the following 2003/04 season as a WildFox, but was quickly signed up by the Manchester Phoenix, a newly established team icing in the Elite Ice Hockey League, the highest standard of club hockey in the United Kingdom. Lovell would be a regular player for the Phoenix, playing 54 regular season and 6 post-season games, although only managing 7 points in that time. Despite making the post-season the Manchester organisation would encounter financial difficulties stemming from their use of the Manchester Evening News Arena and its significant rental costs. This meant that the Phoenix would be temporarily suspended in the summer of 2004, leaving Lovell without a club. He would return to the Telford Wildfoxes for the 2004/05 season and played in 22 games, although again struggled to find his scoring touch managing just three points all season. He stayed in Telford though and would ice as a Telford Tiger the year after as the organisation underwent a name change. A second opportunity to play in the EIHL arose and in the summer of 2006, Lovell signed for the Edinburgh Capitals.

It adjoined the east border of the newly developed residential neighborhood Packer Park at 3300 South Broad Street. Admission cost: Children $1 Adults $2 Hours of operation: 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Shows: Four times Daily History Aquarama was a leading 1960s educational and entertainment concept that combined the previous elements of an Aquarium zoo with theatrical aquatic circus. Even its name reflected 21st century jargon Aqua+\\"arama\\" (like Cinerama) communicating a Sea to \\"See\\" it all. This private enterprise successor to the City owned Philadelphia Aquarium established as the first of its kind in the City of Philadelphia in 1911 that was closed in 1962. The old Aquarium had been housed in vacated building space when the City's Fairmount Park Waterworks was closed and the pumping machine removed. The building was located along the Schuylkill River using the river as a water source. It was a success until the 1940s with over one million visitors annually, until the facility fell into disrepair and exhibits diminished in variety and became known more for dead fish and a building infested with rodents. The City failed to provide funds to build a new public Aquarium in Fairmount Park recommended by the Fairmount Park Commission. Frustration led to raising $3 million of private funds to build Aquarama on the site in South Philadelphia. Aquarama Entrance The South Philadelphia site was selected to gain a benefit from a larger development concept for the area near JFK Stadium. The area was the former site of the United States 1926 celebration, the Sesqui-Centennial an exposition of 20th- century technology and American life demolished in 1927. In the years following, ideas were percolating about a portion of the exposition grounds. It remained idle until a 1960s development plan for a modern sports and entertainment complex at the apex of Broad Street and Packer Avenue was realized with the eventual demolition of the historically remembered Municipal Stadium (a last remaining structure of the Sesqui-Centennial Expo and the event site of the annual Army/Navy Game) then renamed in 1964, JFK Stadium, in honor of the then recently assassinated president John F. Kennedy. Also, in keeping with complementary entertainment venues across from the Aquarama site on the east side of Broad Street was Park Lanes Bowling alley and the South City Drive-in movie theater. Billing itself as ‚ÄúThe Theater of the Sea‚Äù, Aquarama opened its doors in 1962 on South Broad Street, across from where Veterans Stadium would stand a decade later along with and the 2003 creation of the expanded South Philadelphia Sports Complex alongside the Spectrum, and Wells Fargo Center. By the late 1960s, however, Philadelphians began to tire of Aquarama and it was financially failing. After only 7 years of existence, Philadelphia‚Äôs ‚ÄúTheater of the Sea‚Äù quietly disappeared and was demolished in 1969. Architecture The architect was Erling H. Pedersen. His design reflected the influences both International architecture and Postmodern architecture. The materials of concrete, steel and glass blended to support a cold Sea like environment. The multi glass door entrance was doubled to prevent escape of both heat and cool air in the summer. The exterior of the building was composed of concrete sections of offset angled panels, porticos with multi-colored and multi-textured tiles and adorned with wave shaped canopies symbolizing the ocean. The colors of cream-yellow and green predominate. The floors of the building were terrazzo. The site plan had three distinct sections composed of a one-floor pavilion building with two interior sections estimated at and an outdoor natural ocean grounds section: *Wonders of the Sea The open spacious entrance had along the left side a huge unique two-story shaped circular 155,000 gallon fresh water tank that visitors could walk around on a ramp to view a community of various fish and also view the exhibits of smaller aquarium tanks along the zig-zag wall. The floor area behind the tank was planted with tropical and semi-tropical vegetation. Across the very wide lobby was a snack bar area, souvenir shop and candy-pop-corn area. *Theater of the Sea Directly forward and across the entrance was an exhibition theater. The sloping depressed structure held a \\"fish bowl\\" 150,000-gallon tank, 100 by , that was surrounded by 13 rows of bleachers with a capacity of 1,200 seats. *Sea dioramas on outdoor grounds Several in-ground pools where sea life could live all year long. The exhibited whales new home was a 100,000 gallon salt water pool, that was in diameter eight feet deep at the edges in the middle. Major specimen exhibits and Entertainment During Aquarama's existence in the 1960s it made quite a splash in family fun entertainment. Aquarama was in some ways like an aquarium, and in other ways like a circus, a venue fine tuned by outdoor entertainment developer George A. Hamid enterprises in 1965 when he leased the financially failing enterprise started in 1962. Also a serious scientific dimension of marine life was encouraged with the addition of the U.S Government, and private corporations General Electric, and Sperry Corporation performing various studies of underwater cardiograms, weightlessness, taking recordings and evaluating communications among dolphins /(Porpoises). Sperry featured the Aquarama dolphins in advertisements. Main Plaza: The entrance area was an open plaza with an impressive three-story circular tank. Fish of every size, shape and color would swim endlessly around this giant circular glass tank including two giant 300-pound sea turtles and a human skin diver who would interact audibly and answer questions from the visiting audience. A ramp with a railing encircled the center tank so people could walk around, perusing the aquatic contents. Along the wall were many smaller aquariums filled with exotic fish, other aquatic life and included a porpoise tank. Aquatic Arena Theater: In addition to the exhibitions there was a water arena that included performances of porpoises, starring whales \\"Willie and Winky\\" and aquatic events. The arena theater section consisted of a huge rectangular pool surrounded by raised bench seating. Trained seals would honk out ‚ÄúHow Dry I Am‚Äù on a set of bulb horns, and several times a day, dolphins would rescue a clown named \\"Flippy\\". The show featured James H. Crovetti, Sr., as Flippy the Clown. The Master of Ceremonies would call out, ‚ÄúFlippy, where are you?‚Äù The spotlights would come on and there was Flippy the Clown, hanging 40 feet above the waters of the Aquarama‚Äôs indoor arena pool, hanging from a scaffolding he would roll out from the back wall where the holding tanks that the dolphins were kept in were located.. Flippy would throw down various items such as rings, balls, and toys that the dolphins would balance on their noses. At the end of this segment of the show, the Master of Ceremonies would shout, ‚ÄúOK Flippy, come on down, but be very careful!‚Äù Flippy would push back the scaffolding, he would pretend to forget to let go of one of the hand bars used to push back the scaffolding leaving him hanging 40 feet above the waters of the main show tank! He would hang there for at least 2 minutes interacting with the Master of Ceremonies saying ‚ÄúHang on Flippy, we're coming to get you!‚Äù Flippy would let go making the 40-foot plunge into the tank feet first so that his flippers would create the biggest splash possible. The dolphins would rescue Flippy. There was no belly flop! He would do this dangerous trick 4 times a day. Attractive young women would swim in the tank(s) to appear like mermaids and entertain the curiosity of the visitors. As lights went on at show time six porpoises, each weighing about 300 pounds and long would start in a \\"Philly\\" style dance version of the \\"Twist\\" made popular by home town recording star Chubby Checker. Philadelphia radio and TV personality Gene Arnold hosted many shows there, as did the later \\"Voice of the Flyers,\\" Gene Hart. Other Areas: An outdoor area had open pools for other displays of seasonal exhibits and a place for visitors to meander and wander. Following the show, patrons could wander out into the concession area and spend their spare change on souvenirs, or on watching chickens, ducks and small animals perform tricks in tiny coin- operated booths. Many promotional gimmicks were used to attract visitors. The premises was rented for parties, teen dances and a movie theater was built on the grounds to increase visitor appeal. This included the 20th century outdoor entertainment entrepreneur George Hamid, who leased the facility and brought from Atlantic City the famous Diving Horse attraction. Even this attempt failed as the diver missed the foam rubber bed and wound up in the intensive care unit of the nearby hospital. Featured Specimens: Pilot Whales featured as \\"Willie and Winky\\" Captured off the Newfoundland coast : Wille long weight 1 ton 5 yrs old and Winky eight feet long 600 pounds 1 year old. Six Porpoises trained in Florida, featured performing spirited fun tricks and friendly acts. Movie theater and ice rink or motel Added on the same site in 1967 was a 750-seat movie theater, operated by Stanley-Warner, named the \\"Stadium Theater\\" with frontage on Broad Street of commercial space for a fast-food hamburger outlet, from a leading national restaurant chain, Steer Inn, in which Dick Clark had an interest. An ice skating rink combined with roller skating was planned but never built. In 1969, before Aquarama was demolished, a motel developer purchased the property with the intent to turn the existing building with the tanks into an aquatic-themed motel. This plan was not successful. Media broadcast and event history Points of interest evolved for both radio and TV broadcasting. Before the \\"Voice of the Flyers\\" was indeed that, Gene Hart, a former school teacher, was an announcer and an assistant public relations director for the Aquarama. When Philadelphia landed an NHL ice hockey franchise, Hart submitted some audition tapes and got the job, but he still worked full-time for the aquarium, according to the Flyers Web site. The front entrance plaza was a great public space appropriate for High School Proms (as South Philadelphia High School) and weddings. Well-known radio and television personality Ed Hurst, a native of Atlantic City NJ with performances at Steel Pier, originated a live teenage dance formatted like American Bandstand telecast from the Aquarama on Saturday afternoons using the open spaces with the undersea theme as a background. \\"Ed Hurst at Aquarama\\" aired on Channel 3 but was left with no archived video history to review. A frequent co-host was TV reporterJim O'Brien and radio personality Jerry Blavat. Ed Hurst reminisced about his old aquatic haunt for WHYY-TV on Philadelphia Channel 12's popular series \\"More Things That Aren't There Anymore,\\" which was produced by Public Television's WHYY-TV personality/producer Ed Cunningham. Among other things erased over time was a record album of children songs produced by public relations director Sidney Hantman with featured songs like \\"Percy the Pink Piranha.\\" To Tell the Truth -TV Series episode #1084 College Student summer job works with Willie the Whale at Aquarama What's My Line -TV Series episode #638 Porpoise Trainer Aquarama What's My Line -TV Series episode #783 Whale Trainer at Aquarama WHYY-TV broadcast, Broadcast Pioneers member Ed Hurst talked about the Aquarama TV series See also * Philadelphia Aquarium * Philadelphia Zoo * Camden Aquarium References Other sources Philadelphia Inquirer (1962-7-1) \\"Aquarama Will Open in Fall\\", Retrieved Paper Archive Philadelphia Free Library.

It consisted of a simple side platform and a shed. The station closed on 9 November 2012. History Langnes was established as a flag stop in 1928, when the Norwegian State Railways introduced flag stops at a large number of intersections along the Eastern √òstfold Line in order to compete better with bus and truck services. Langnes was at the time situated from Ski. The station was moved eastwards from 1 February 1989. The moving involved building a new platform and shed, which was situated on the other side of the tracks as before. Due to the short platform, the Norwegian National Rail Administration was required by the Norwegian Railway Authority to either upgrade the platforms or close the station by 2012. The Rail Administration evaluated that the station had limited patronage and little possibilities of future growth and therefore decided to close it and three other stations on the line. Participating factors was that any expansion of the station and any new parking spaces would have to be taken from agricultural land. The closing took effect on 9 December 2012. Facilities Langnes Station was situated on the Eastern √òstfold Line, from Ski Station and from Oslo S. The station had a simple side platform which was long with a platform height of and a waiting shed. The station was situated in an agricultural area with little population in the immediate vicinity. Access was available via a gravel road, with limited sign posting which made it difficult to find. There were about 500 people living within a radius of the station. There were 1,223 within .

Background Hughes is the son of a former Canterbury player, Garry Hughes, and the brother of Steven Hughes and Corey Hughes, who also played for the club. Playing career Hughes made his first grade debut for Canterbury against North Sydney in round 1 1992 at North Sydney Oval. Hughes first three seasons were mainly spent in Canterbury's reserve grade team and he did not play in the club's 1994 grand final loss against the Canberra Raiders. In the 1995 ARL season, Hughes played 15 games including the 1995 Grand Final victory over Manly-Warringah at the Sydney Football Stadium. The victory was considered a major upset as Canterbury had finished the season in sixth place and Manly were minor premiers. In the 1998 NRL season, Hughes played 27 games as Canterbury finished 9th on the table and qualified for the finals. Canterbury proceeded to make the 1998 NRL Grand Final after winning 4 sudden death elimination matches in a row including the club's famous preliminary final victory over rivals Parramatta which is considered to be one of the greatest comebacks of all time. After being 18-2 down with less than 10 minutes remaining, Canterbury scored 3 tries to take the game into extra-time before winning the match 32‚Äì20. Hughes played from the interchange bench for Canterbury in their loss at the 1998 NRL grand final to the Brisbane Broncos. In the 2002 NRL season, Hughes played 17 games as the club went undefeated through most of the year winning their first 16 games. It was then revealed that Canterbury had exceeded the NRL's salary cap by $2 million over 3 years including undisclosed payments made to players. As a result, the NRL fined Canterbury $500,000 and stripped them of all their 37 competition points meaning that the club would finish the 2002 season with the wooden spoon. Hughes continued to play for Canterbury right until the end of the 2004 NRL season before retiring. He did not play in the club's 2004 NRL Grand Final victory over the Sydney Roosters.

The complex covers of land encompassing the entire Makiling Forest Reserve (MFR) and surrounding areas. Its land grants in the provinces of Laguna, Negros Occidental, and Quezon have a combined area of . The campus contains over 300 buildings. Equipment and facilities are estimated to be worth ‚Ç±10.6 billion (US$245 million)Approximate conversion value as of May 2011 according to UPLB's financial statement for 2009. The university manages eight student dormitories inside the campus, which housed 2,170 of the 11,980 students enrolled in 2008. As of 2007, UPLB's 12 libraries, collectively referred to as the University Library, hold a total of 346,061 volumes. The University Library is a periodic recipient of publications from the United Nations agencies (namely the UNFAO, UN-HABITAT, and UNU) and the World Bank. It is a contributor to the International Information System for Agricultural Services and Technology, to which it contributed almost 30,000 titles between 1975 and 2010. History The campus was established in 1909 on of abandoned farmland at the foot of Mount Makiling, purchased by the University of the Philippines (UP) Board of Regents to serve as the campus of the newly created UP College of Agriculture (UPCA). Students helped clear the land, and the first classes were held in tents. Practical instruction was done at plantations on campus, such as those for corn, sugar cane and tobacco. Act 2730 of the Philippine Legislature in February 1918 authorized the appropriation of for the creation of an agricultural experiment station. At the same time, funding of ‚Ç±125,000 (US$2,890) was used by the college to acquire for experimental farms and pasture. Most of the early structures were demolished during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines (1941‚Äì1945), but some still exist, including the Palma Bridge and Baker Memorial Hall (both built during Dean Bienvenido M. Gonzalez's term from 1927 to 1938). All the student residences, 23 College of Agriculture buildings, 13 student dormitories and bungalows, and 22 faculty and employee houses were destroyed during the Second World War. The School of Forestry was also devastated. Only the agricultural engineering building was left undamaged. Grants from USAID and Mutual Security Agency in the 1950s accelerated the development of the campus. The Graduate School building, the UPCA Library (now College of Arts and Sciences building), and the Women's Dormitory (now the Math Building) were built as a result. Meanwhile, grants from the United States Economic Cooperation Agency (worth US$239,552), the International Cooperation Administration (ICA) (worth US$175,000), and ICA-National Economic Council allowed the construction of the Forest Products Laboratory (claimed by Centennial Panorama: Pictorial History of UPLB to be the \\"largest and best equipped in the eastern hemisphere\\" at the time it was constructed) in 1954, the Agricultural Credit and Cooperatives Institute in 1957, and further construction of school and dormitory buildings in the School of Forestry campus in the 1960s. In February 1962, the Ford Foundation funded US$6.9 million for the construction of the International Rice Research Institute. Aside from international assistance, five-year development programs during the terms of Dean Domingo Lantican (1958‚Äì1971) of the School of Forestry, and Dean Dioscoro Umali (1959‚Äì1970) of the College of Agriculture were also instrumental in developing the campus. During the implementation of these programs, the administration buildings of the College of Agriculture and the College of Development Communication as well as staff houses and roads were built. Since 2008 efforts have been put into renovation and beautification of existing structures to repair damage from Typhoon Xangsane in 2006 and to promote the campus as a \\"walking museum\\" and ecotourism center. Construction of an 11,000-seater convention center and cable cars connecting the lower and upper campuses have been proposed as part of the ecotourism plan. Beautification projects include paving of pathways and construction of lampposts. Some students criticized the program, arguing that the funds would have been better allocated for the renovation of classrooms, laboratories, and other academic facilities. A memorandum issued by Chancellor Luis Rey I. Velasco in 2010 instructed UPLB to conserve energy to reduce operating costs. The plan calls for reduced use of electric appliances (such as air conditioners, electric stoves and ovens), car pooling, and recycling. Areas Tanghalang Maria Makiling at the National Arts Center =Upper campus= The College of Forestry and Natural Resources, College of Public Affairs, ASEAN Center for Biodiversity, National Arts Center, Philippine High School for the Arts, the site of the National Jamboree of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines, and the Center for Philippine Raptors are in the upper campus. It includes the entire Makiling Forest Reserve. It is also the site of the Bureau of Plant Industry-Makiling Botanic Gardens, one of the oldest parts of the campus. The gardens are located where the tents used as classrooms were set up during the first four months of the university's history. The MFR serves as an outdoor laboratory to students, primarily of the College of Forestry and Natural Resources. ‚Ç±5 million (US$156,000) was designated for its conservation and development in 2011. The MFR was created in 1910 under the Bureau of Forestry. Jurisdiction over MFR was transferred to UP in 1960. The National Power Corporation acquired complete jurisdiction of the MFR in 1987 as part of the Philippines' energy development program under President Corazon Aquino. The MFR was returned to UPLB three years later under the terms of Republic Act 6967. In 2008 Representative Del De Guzman of the 2nd district of Marikina filed HB 1143, which, if passed into law, would have transferred of the MFR to the jurisdiction of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines. The bill was strongly opposed by UPLB, citing possible mismanagement and deforestation of the site if placed under the BSP, among other reasons. The bill has been pending in the House Committee on Natural Resources since August 2007. =Lower campus= Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture (SEARCA) The lower campus, located at the foot of Mt. Makiling, is the location of most UPLB units and affiliated entities, including the International Rice Research Institute, World Agroforestry Centre, and the Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture (SEARCA). The Molawin River, a tributary of Laguna de Bay, runs through the campus. Several bridges, such as the Palma Bridge (named after UP President Rafael V. Palma), cross the river. A 1996 UPLB study found high concentrations of nitrates and phosphates in the river, believed to be from decaying garbage and domestic waste. There have been recent efforts to rehabilitate the river, such as planting Mussaenda and Hibiscus on its banks. =Land grants= UPLB has three major land grants provided by the government of the Philippines: the Laguna-Quezon Land Grant, the La Carlota Land Grant, and the Laguna Land Grant. The Laguna-Quezon Land Grant, acquired in February 1930, is located in the towns of Real, Quezon, and Siniloan, Laguna. It covers some portions of the Sierra Madre mountain range, and hosts the university‚Äôs Citronella and lemongrass plantations. The La Carlota Land Grant is situated in Negros Occidental, a province in the Western Visayas region. Acquired in May 1964, it houses the PCARRD-DOST La Granja Agricultural Research Center, which serves as a research center for various upland crops. The Laguna Land Grant, located in Paete, Laguna, is mostly undeveloped. Numerous parties have expressed interest in developing the land grants. Proposed projects include construction of dams and tree farms for Moringa oleifera, pineapples and rubber. UPLB has not entertained the potential investors due to the \\"lack of a solid development plan.\\" Buildings and landmarks The Main Library, behind the Philippine Pegasus Many of the prominent buildings in the campus were designed by Leandro Locsin, a National Artist for Architecture who is known for his extensive use of concrete and simplistic designs. The Dioscoro L. Umali Hall, an auditorium named after Dean Dioscoro L. Umali, was built during Umali's US$6-million and ‚Ç±23-million (US$533,000) Five-Year Development Program implemented in 1965. Arkitekturang Filipino, a collaboration of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts and the United Architects of the Philippines, calls it a \\"clear example of his distinct architecture\\", and notes its resemblance to the Nicanor Abelardo Hall at the Cultural Center of the Philippines. It houses the Sining Makiling art gallery. The Main Library, with a floor area of and a seating capacity of 510, is the largest library in UPLB. It holds 195,282 volumes, theses, and digital sources, and 1,215 serial titles. It was originally built as the SEARCA library in 1974. It was eventually transferred to the university as the successor of the University of the Philippines College of Agriculture Library. It is believed to be the largest agricultural library in Asia. The Rizal Memorial Centenary Carillon, built in 1996, is named after Philippine National Hero Jos√© Rizal. It has 37 bells ranging from F three octaves below middle C up to G above middle C, making it the second largest non-traditional carillon in the Asia-Pacific region in terms of number of bells. It is one of only two non-traditional carillons in the Philippines. The Student Union Building houses the offices of the Office of Student Affairs, University Food Service, University Student Council, and UPLB Perspective (the official student publication of UPLB). The Student Union, along with the three aforementioned buildings, was designed by Locsin. A replica of the Oblation and the Philippine Pegasus (also referred to as the Pegaraw; a winged tamaraw) were sculpted by National Artist Napoleon Abueva. The original Oblation is a statue by Guillermo Tolentino, Abueva's mentor, commissioned in 1935 by UP President Rafael Palma. The sculpture is based on the second stanza of Rizal's Mi √∫ltimo adi√≥s (Spanish for My last farewell). A replica of the Oblation can be found on each of the major UP campuses, and has become the campuses' identifying landmark. Transportation and amenities Public utility jeepneys are a popular means of transportation around the campus. Jeepney drivers are required to post kanan (Tagalog for \\"right\\") or kaliwa (Tagalog for \\"left\\"), in reference to their direction. Since August 2007 a new jeepney route has been in force. The new route prohibits access to the middle campus‚Äîwhich contains most of the university's main buildings‚Äîto promote walking and to lessen noise and air pollution inside the campus. As this part of the campus was the destination of many passengers, jeepney drivers estimated the change would result in a loss of ‚Ç±200‚Äì300 (US$5‚Äì7) and a 90 percent loss of passengers. Due to this, the implementation was met with protests, including a transport strike. A walkout was staged by around 500 students, citing the lack of community consultation before implementation of the plan. The mayor of Los Ba√±os refused to interfere. The campus is also served by the UP Los Ba√±os railway station operated by Philippine National Railways, although currently no trains stop at the station. Numerous congregations can be found near UPLB. These include the Catholic parishes of St. Therese of the Child Jesus and San Antonio de Padua, the UCCP Church Among the Palms, and Victory Los Ba√±os. Other amenities include banks (including LBP, Plantersbank, and PNB) and malls, such as Robinsons Town Mall Los Ba√±os.

It contains the tomb of the patriarchs, mentioned by Josephus,\\"Ant.\\", I, 14. by Eusebius,Onomasticon, loc. cit. and by the Pilgrim of Bordeaux in 333. Crusaders took the town in 1100, and the sanctuary became the church of Saint Abraham, also called the church of the Holy Cave (Sancta Caverna or Spelunca, ‚Äô√°gion spela√Æon). The town itself is often styled by the chroniclers of that period Castel Saint-Abraham, Pr√¶sidium or Castellum ad Sanctum Abraham.

As a residential see, Hebron enjoyed a very brief existence. However it survived the triumph of Saladin in 1187, and the march of the Khwarezmians in 1244. Saladin, after the victory at Hattin (4 July, 1187), and that at Ascalon (5 September), hastened, before marching on Jerusalem, to occupy Hebron, and to associate the sanctuary of Abraham with the worship of Islam. The Khwarezmians destroyed the town, but did not touch the sanctuary.Riant, \\"Archives\\", II, 420-421.

Situated from Oslo Central Station (Oslo S), it is served hourly by the L22 service of the Norwegian State Railways' Oslo Commuter Rail. The station opened on 24 November 1882 with a station building designed by Balthazar Lange in Swiss chalet style. It has been listed as a cultural heritage site. The station received a revamp in 2014. The station had 92,000 boarding and disembarking passengers in 2012. History During the planning of the √òstfold Line there were two proposals for how the Eastern Line would branch off. The one called for a branch at √Ös Station and then heading due east from there. The other was branching off at Ski Station. The municipal council in Kr√•kstad supported the later, which was ultimately chosen. Kraakstad Municipality bought shares worth 2,000 Norwegian speciedaler in the railway.√òstlid: 13 The station and line opened on 24 November 1882. The station in 1922The station initially became an important asset for the surrounding community, as it allowed for daily, fresh shipments of milk to the capital. However, other produce such as potatoes, vegetables, hay and firewood, were still transported by horse and carriage. This was mostly because there was a need for shipment to the door of consumers. Unlike many of station on the line, Kr√•kstad never developed into much of a station town, and only a few houses were built by the station.Magnus: 47 The station had 7,058 annual boarding passengers, excluding month ticket holders, in 1890. This rose to 13,564 in 1901 and then stayed more or less even for the decade. It increased throughout the 1910s, peaking at 24,032 in 1902. Numbers then fell throughout the 1920s. From 1928 a series of flag stops were built, bringing the number down to 11,893.√òstlid: 195 A dairy was built at the station in 1910.Gustafson: 22 A four-story granary was built at the station in 1918. With the break-out of the First World War, the authorities were concerned for the continued grain supply. It was later taken over by Felleskj√∏pet and was used as a grain elevator.Gustafson: 23 The station was originally named Kraakstad, but took the modern spelling in April 1921.Bjerke & Holom: 50 The line was electrified on 5 December 1958. At the same time direct services to the capital were reintroduced.Bjerke & Holom: 37 An interlocking system was installed on 30 May 1959. The Norwegian National Rail Administration evaluated the future of the station in 2012, concluding that since Kr√•kstad lacked other good public transit, it would still receive a train service, despite having somewhat few passengers for their targets. It subsequently approved a complete renovation of the platforms and outside areas. This included new platforms on both sides and a new level crossing. Unlike the larger stations, Kr√•kstad did not receive an overpass or underpass. This replaced a main platform which was long and an island platform which was . These were tall, respectively. As one of the last commuter lines, the Eastern √òstfold Line received centralized traffic control from 31 August 2015, no longer making it necessary to have a train dispatcher at the station for passing. It was the first Norwegian line to utilize European Rail Traffic Management System. Facilities NSB Class 72 commuter train at the station, prior to the upgrades. Kr√•ksad Station is situated on the Eastern √òstfold Line, from Ski Station and from Oslo S, at an elevation of above mean sea level. The station has two side platforms which are long and tall. The main passing loop at the station is long. There is no ticket sale at the station, but a heated waiting room in the station building. There is a bicycle rack but no parking at the station. There is no transfer to bus and taxi. There is a level crossing just east of the platforms. In addition to the two through tracks, there is a spur which can be used by maintenance of way vehicles. The station mostly serves the village of Kr√•kstad. There are 1,208 residents within a radius of the station. The station building was designed in Swiss chalet style by Balthazar Lange, who had the responsibility for all stations along the Eastern √òstfold Line. The wooden building is a third-class station and has the same design as many other stations on the line, Kr√•kstad Station, Tomter, Slitu, Eidsberg, Gautestad and Ise.Hartmann: 133 The station building has been listed as a cultural heritage site based on it being one of the most genuine copies of the third-class Balthazar stations. It was noted for having few changes and that the original station area was largely preserved.Hartmann: 135 Service Kr√•kstad is served with hourly L22 trains operated by the Norwegian State Railways' Oslo Commuter Rail. The run from Oslo via Ski and Kr√•kstad to Mysen or Rakkestad. Travel time is 29 minutes to Oslo S, 6 minutes to Ski and 35 minutes to Mysen. The trains continue onward from Oslo along the Drammen Line terminating at Sk√∏yen Station. The station had 92,000 daily boarding and disembarking passengers in 2012.

It is adjacent to Seton House. The church is designated as a scheduled monument. Description The church consists of the complete eastern limb and the two transepts of a cruciform church, the crossing-tower as high as it was built (the completion of the spire was precluded by the Reformation), and the dubious foundations of the nave, which was not built. The walls of the choir and chancel were built by 1478, and roofed by 1508. The transepts were erected sometime between 1513 and 1588. As such the eastern limb stood without them for at least 35 years. The church was raised to collegiate status in 1492. Contained within are two effigies: one male and one female, dating from the fifteenth century. The female effigy, badly defaced, is possibly of earlier origin. To the immediate south west are the foundations of the buildings once occupied by the clergy and staff. During the war now known as the Rough Wooing, the English army occupied Haddington. The Seton family was forced to live at Culross Abbey in 1549, where George Seton, 6th Lord Seton died. After the war was over, his widow Marie Pieris had his body brought to Seton and buried in the choir next to his father.Richard Maitland, History of the House of Seytoun (Glasgow, 1829), p. 42. The church is now in the care of Historic Environment Scotland, and a 4-Star Historic Tourist Attraction.

Kinney was born in Hampshire County, Massachusetts around 1847. His family later moved to Iowa, and in 1865, after the Civil War ended, Kinney enlisted in the US Army. At the rank of sergeant, Kinney was mustered out of the army in 1873. He settled in Do√±a Ana County, New Mexico, and for reasons unknown organized a gang, which began committing acts of robbery and cattle rustling. Jesse Evans was one of the early members. On December 31, 1875, Kinney, Evans, Jim McDaniels and Pony Diehl entered a saloon in Las Cruces, New Mexico, where they became involved in a brawl with Cavalry soldiers from Fort Seldon. The outlaws were beaten badly and thrown out of the saloon. They returned shortly thereafter and opened fire, killing two soldiers and one civilian, and wounding two other soldiers and one civilian. Not long afterwards, Evans broke away from the gang to form the Jesse Evans Gang. Kinney enlisted his gang in the El Paso Salt War. Then both gangs were later enlisted by the \\"Murphy-Dolan Faction\\" at the outset of the Lincoln County War, and it was Jesse Evans and members of his gang who killed John Tunstall, spurring Billy the Kid and his \\"Regulators\\" into action. During the battle and siege of the McSween house, Billy the Kid fired a shot that hit Kinney in the face, but he survived. In 1878, Kinney was arrested for the murder of Ysabel Barela, but was acquitted. In 1883 Kinney was arrested for cattle rustling and sentenced to prison. Released in 1886, he did not return to his outlaw life. By that time all the members of his former gang were either dead or in prison or had disappeared. He served in the US Army during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and was successful as a miner in Chaparral Gulch, Arizona before retiring to Prescott, where he died on August 25, 1919.

Employment Rights Act 1996) and the new Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003. Facts McClintock was a magistrate who served for 15 years on the family panel. The law in the UK had recently been changed to prevent discrimination against same-sex couples. The change in the law meant that children needing foster homes could be placed with same-sex couples, and the sex of the parents would not be the sole justifiable reason for declining placement. McClintock raised objections to sitting on cases where he might have to place children in foster homes with same-sex couples. At first he said that there was evidence to show that children placed with same-sex couples would be disadvantaged when compared to child placed with a heterosexual family. McClintock cited increased bullying at school as an example. McClintock felt that by placing a child with a same-sex family, he would be neglecting his statutory obligation to do what is in the child's best interests. He then said that it was due to his religious convictions as a Christian that he could not sit on such cases. He was told by his employer, the Department of Constitutional Affairs (now the Ministry of Justice), that he would not be able to get an exemption from his duties. He brought them to the employment tribunal, where he lost and then appealed.see, Jonathan Petre, 'Magistrate appeals in gay adoption row', The Daily Telegraph (19.04.2008) Mr McClintock was represented by Paul Diamond. Judgment Elias J at the Employment Appeals Tribunal dismissed the case because McClintock's objection was essentially founded on a belief that children were being used as guinea pigs in a social experiment, rather than on his philosophical or religious beliefs.R Sandberg, McClintock v DCA (2008) 160 Law and Justice 63-5 The fact that McClintock had said he might sit on the cases when evidence had been given to him that children in same-sex foster homes were just as good as heterosexual foster homes showed that the conviction was not one of such gravity to qualify as religious or philosophical under the 2003 Regulations. Accordingly, not only had there been no engagement of his Art.9 ECHR right to freedom of religion, his dismissal was entirely fair, for misconduct (s.98(2)(b) ERA 1996).see, 'Gay couple adoption appeal lost', BBC (31.10.2007) See also *UK employment discrimination law *UK labour law *Human Rights Act 1998 Notes External links Category:Anti-discrimination law in the United Kingdom Category:Human rights in the United Kingdom Category:Employment Appeal Tribunal cases Category:2007 in case law Category:2007 in British law ","title":"McClintock v Dept of Constitutional Affairs"},{"id":"17455393","text":"Prot√∂thea is a shoot 'em up video game developed by Argentinianhttps://www.siliconera.com/2008/03/28/ubisoft-picks-up-protothea- possible-wiiware-shmup/ studio Digital Builders originally released for Windows PCs in 2005.

Similarly, Meier, Moses' father, wrote his family name in several different ways in Hebrew and Yiddish. Two of Meir's sons Americanized the family name to Mitchell; Moses wrote it Mescheloff. Moses chose the Hebrew spelling from that Americanized name. Moses' older son, Rabbi Dr. Efrom Zev Mescheloff, maintained the Hebrew spelling in Israel, as did most of Efrom's sons. Moses' youngest son, Rabbi Dr. David Joseph Mescheloff, upon his arrival in Israel after Efrom, chose to spell the family name , at his brother's recommendation, as had those family members who had emigrated from Russia to Israel before World War II. This was a more accurate phonetic transliteration of the Russian surname, and avoided the difficulties Israelis had pronouncing Efrom's name correctly. David's sons have adopted this spelling as well. Thus there is occasional confusion concerning the family relationship between the brothers, and between the cousins and their children.) (June 12, 1909 ‚Äì May 9, 2008) was an American Orthodox rabbi and community leader for 75 years, known especially within circles of American Orthodox Judaism, primarily in Miami Beach, Florida, and in Chicago, Illinois. Biography Mescheloff's rabbinical career spanned more than 75 years. He grew up and began his career in a period of crisis in American Orthodox Judaism, and continued to lead it through a second major crisis following World War II and the Holocaust. Ultimately he played a major role in bringing it to the more secure, self-confident, and expanding state it enjoyed by the end of the twentieth century. =Early years= Moshe Mescheloff, the third of four children, was born in New York City in 1909. His parents were Meier Mischelow (, b. 1879, d. Sunday, 2 Cheshvan 5707 - October 27, 1946) and Bessie (Basse Mirel) Kroll (, b. 1878, d. Thursday, 27 Tishri 5710 - October 20, 1949). They had married in MinskAccording to the Russian census of 1897, over half the population of Minsk was Jewish. on Monday night, 2 Kislev 5663 (December 1,The wedding invitation reads 18 November, as Russia had not yet gone over from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar. 1902).The wedding invitation indicates Monday, 1 Kislev, but the ketuba of Bessie Mischelow indicates Tuesday, 2 Kislev; clearly the wedding was Monday night. Meier was a descendant of scholarly forebears, and had had a yeshiva education. Meier and Bessie had felt the endemic anti-Semitism in Czarist Russia, and joined the mass migration of Jews from Russia to the United States at the end of the nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries. Some 92,388 Russian Jews immigrated to the US in 1905. In 1906, a year of continued pogroms, Russian Jewish immigration reached 125,234, the highest figure in the entire period of mass immigration. This was out of a total Jewish immigration to the US during that record year of some 153,748, almost all of whom were of East European origin.Rothkoff, Aaron, Bernard Revel, the Jewish Publication society of America, Philadelphia, 1972, p. 3. Meier and Bessie immigrated to the United States from Minsk, arriving on the SS Smolensk at Ellis Island on Friday, 24 Elul 5666 (September 14, 1906). Meier was then 27,Ellis Island - FREE Port of New York Passenger Records Search and Bessie was 28.Ellis Island - FREE Port of New York Passenger Records Search They arrived with two small children, Idel (Yehuda/Irving, then 3; 1903‚Äì1969) and Marjase (Mae, an infant; 1906‚Äì2005).Ellis Island - FREE Port of New York Passenger Records Search Meier and Bessie had two more children after their arrival in the United States, Moshe (Moses) and Yitzhak (Al; 1912‚Äì1960). Thus their family bridged the Jewish cultures of \\"the old world\\" of Europe and of \\"the new world\\" of America, setting the background for Moshe's rabbinic career. Meier had operated some small businesses in Minsk, including a Jewish book shop, with Bessie's help. In New York he first found a job at a grocery store, and then became its hardworking owner. Later he owned a delicatessen store. Meier's yeshiva background and love of books inspired the young Moshe with a lifelong love of books. Moshe's library grew steadily over the years until it numbered several thousand. Bessie, too, was a lover of writing. A collection of her fifty poetic discourses in Yiddish was distributed among Rabbi Mescheloff's children in December, 1996.\\"Poetic Discourses (in her own handwriting) by Bessie Mishaloff\\", collected and printed by Moses Mescheloff, private distribution, Chicago, 1999. She undoubtedly laid a foundation for his extensive writings. In addition to his doctoral dissertation, several scholarly articles and popular booklets and articles (see below), over the many years of his career Rabbi Mescheloff wrote many thousands of divrei Torah (Torah discourses), for synagogue bulletins and for Jewish life cycle events. =Formal Education= When Mescheloff was born, in 1909, his parents lived in Manhattan. Although he was sent to public school through junior high, his parents made sure that he had the finest and most knowledgeable Hebrew teachers they could find, who gave him private \\"Hebrew lessons\\" up to the study of the Talmud.This was the educational practice of only a minority of the immigrant Jewish families, according to Rothkoff in Bernard Revel, p. 9-10, and not a very effective one at that. Yet it was effective in the case of Mescheloff, as can be seen from his subsequent educational successes. When Mescheloff reached the age of 13, his third teacher, a knowledgeable young man, said that Moshe was ready for entrance to a yeshiva.As I Knew Him: Memories of Rabbi Dr. Bernard Revel - YUdaica Orthodox Judaism in America, and in New York in particular, was in a deep crisis in the first decades of the twentieth century. Several causes brought great numbers of adults to compromise their religious traditions, not observing Shabbat or the laws of kashrut and mikvah strictly, if at all: 1 - widespread ignorance of rabbinic literature and of the meaning of Jewish belief and practice in the modern world, 2 - a desire to be free of the heavy burden of Jewishness as it had been felt \\"in the old world\\", 3 - economic and social pressures, 4 - a dearth of qualified rabbis and effective community-wide institutions. The young people were set on being absorbed into American society, with its promises of wealth and freedom, and saw the strictures of Orthodox Jewish observance as impediments to their assimilation. The older generation, the great majority having no secular education and little formal Jewish education, was woefully unprepared to teach the young how to maintain their Jewish traditions in the new world. Most of the rabbis who had studied in the European Jewish tradition were similarly ill-prepared to deal with the challenges presented by America to Jewish life.See Jeffrey S. Gurock, American Jewish Orthodoxy in Historical Perspective (Ktav, 1996). See especially chapter one, \\"Resistors and Accommodators: Varieties of Orthodox Rabbis in America, 1886-1983,\\" pages 1-63. The Talmudical Academy of Yeshivat Rabbeinu Yitzchak Elchanan (Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS)) was a high school that combined traditional Jewish study with secular studies. It carried the promise of enabling a successful transition of Orthodox Jewish living into America. But it had grown out of a merger of two other institutions only in 1915. From that time it was headed by Rabbi Dr. Bernard Revel, who had arrived in the United States in 1906, like Mescheloff's parents. Mescheloff was much younger than the other boys. They had come from Europe recently, and were all 16 to 20 years old. Yet the 13-year-old passed a rigorous examination by Rabbi Yehuda Weil, one of the roshei yeshiva at RIETS. Moshe was admitted to the Talmudic Academy of RIETS at the age of thirteen, in 1922.The first class to attend Talmudical Academy for four years graduated on July 1, 1920. See Rothkoff, Bernard Revel, pp. 48-49. He progressed in his studies from teacher to teacher, through his high school years and beyond, until he reached the class of Rabbi Shlomo Polachek, renowned as the Meischeter (or Meitsheter, or Maichater) Illui.See: http://www.yucommentator.com/media/paper652/news/2004/09/20/Yudaica/Rabbi.Shlomo.Polachek.The.Unassuming.Iluy.Of.Maichat-713976.shtml?norewrite200603200307&sourcedomain;=www.yucommentator.com. On July 8, 1928, at the age of fifty-one, Rabbi Polachek died of osteomyelitis of the jaw, the result of an abscessed tooth, after a brief two week illness. (Rothkoff, Bernard Revel p. 93 and pp. 115-118.) This was four years before Moshe was ordained by RIETS; see below. Mescheloff loved his studies. He was also involved in the student government. He innovated a book store, and continued to thrive in his Torah studies. He was an American boy, now receiving a Yeshiva background. He was bi-lingual. Yiddish was his \\"mama lashon (mother tongue)\\" and he had no problem learning with his brilliant European teachers. He provided the genuine bridge between the old world and the new world that Rabbi Dr. Revel sought to produce at RIETS. About this time, Mescheloff took an interest in his ancestral background and the bridge his family was building to America. He wrote an extensive genealogical study, going back several generations - to his great-great-great grandfathers, who had been born in the early 18th century. He included many cousins in various countries, based on interviews with his mother and aunts.The fifty page \\"Family History\\" has been scanned and is in the hands of Mescheloff's descendants. Over half a century was to pass before this type of \\"family roots\\" study would become popular with junior high and high school students, and adults, in America. Years later, Mescheloff attested to the major influence Rabbi Dr. Bernard Revel had exerted on him. For many of the ten years that Mescheloff spent as a student at RIETS, Dr. Revel was his teacher, friend, and mentor.When Mescheloff arrived at RIETS, in 1922, Rabbi Meyer Berlin had just been elected President of the Board of RIETS, in March. However, he resigned on May 13, 1923, and Revel returned from an intense period of helping his family through an economic crisis, to serve as head of RIETS until his death in 1940; see below. See Rothkoff, Bernard Revel, pp. 66-69. To Moshe he was a fatherly figure, who took an interest in every phase of the life of each of his students. He met with their parents. He spoke to each in a concerned, friendly fashion, and he was interested in the students' interests. He sought to encourage and to inspire them. Revel knew of Mescheloff's interest in books and of his project of researching the book stores and building a student library. Rabbi Dr. Revel chose Mescheloff to be the recipient of the golden medal for \\"Hasmadah (dedication to learning)\\", rewarded to the most studious student at the Yeshiva high school. The motto attributed to Mescheloff in his year book was \\"to learn something new every day\\". This prize and this motto characterized him throughout his life. When Revel asked for a small class of distinguished students that he would teach himself, Mescheloff was included, even though he continued to be younger than his classmates.As I Knew Him: Memories of Rabbi Dr. Bernard Revel - YUdaica While Mescheloff studied for semikhah (rabbinic ordination) at RIETS, Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein was one of his professors of homiletics. The classes were voluntary, and Moshe attended them religiously every Friday morning.Homiletical studies had been instituted in 1917 at the insistence of students of RIETS, who saw the need for such preparation for addressing American audiences successfully. See Rothkoff, Bernard Revel, pp. 49-50. His other homiletics professor was Rabbi Joseph Lookstein, one of the great orators of his time. Many years later (see below), Lookstein was the installing officer and guest speaker at Mescheloff's installation in Chicago. Mescheloff received his semikhah from RIETS in 1932. Among the signatories were Rabbi Moshe SoloveichikAnother student, Gilbert Klaperman, who received semikhah from RIETS in 1941, from Soloveichik's son, later recalled: \\"Permission to become a regular member of Reb Moshe's class was the crowning glory of a student's many years of study, and tacit certification that he was already a talmid chohom, an accomplished scholar. To weather Rabbi Moses Soloveitchik's exacting standards of diligence and achievement, and then to earn his signature on the semicha certificate of ordination, was the highest accolade that could come to any student.\\" See The Story of Yeshiva University: The First Jewish University in America, New York, Public Relations Department of Yeshiva University, p. 313, quoted by Rothkoff in Bernard Revel, p. 123. and Revel.Until 1936, semikhah was given jointly by the Yeshiva and Agudat Harabanim. Thus, in 1932, Mescheloff's Semikhah was conferred on him by Rabbis Moshe Zevulun Margolies (1851-1936), Hillel Klein and Shalom Jaffe, representing the Agudat Harabanim, and Rabbis Revel, Benjamin Aranowitz and Moshe Soloveichik on behalf of RIETS. See Rothkoff, Bernard Revel, pp. 122-123, 143. Soloveichik was Rosh Yeshiva of RIETS during the 1930s, until his death on Friday, 3 Shevat 5701 (January 31, 1941).Rothkoff, Bernard Revel, p. 122. Mescheloff was one of thirteen students who received semikhah from Soloveichik in America. Indeed, Mescheloff was the first native-born American to receive semikhah from Soloveichik at RIETS. At the same time, Mescheloff studied at the City College of New York (CCNY) as a night student.Thirty-one students, mainly graduates of the Talmudical Academy, constituted the first class of RIETS' new Yeshiva college, that began its studies on September 25, 1928. The first Yeshiva College graduation took place in June 1932. It is not clear why Mescheloff did not join that group. Perhaps it did not offer the program of studies that he desired; see Rothkoff, Bernard Revel, p. 83 and p. 147. Or, perhaps, he had already graduated the Talmudical Academy a year or two earlier, and had already begun his studies at CCNY before Yeshiva College opened. Or, perhaps, he feared that the Yeshiva College might not be a lasting institution, for it roused considerable opposition in the Orthodox rabbinic world, which repeatedly tried to have Yeshiva College closed (ibid). The subways were his \\"Study Hall\\". Mescheloff received the B.A. degree in 1932, graduating with high honors (Magna Cum Laude, election to the Phi Beta Kappa Society.John D. Zeglis, corporate leader in wireless communications, said in a Phi Beta Kappa initiation speech, \\"You are here because you've made a habit of excellence. Occasional brilliance will not get you into Phi Beta Kappa. You are not one-subject wonders. You've established your intellectual credentials in a wide range of subjects. The excellence that brings you here is not accidental. You have chosen to pursue it, and you have earned it. You've broken the code of how to get it done. And that stays with you for life.\\" http://www.pbk.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Membership3&Template;=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&ContentID;=1974 Scholarly excellence and knowledge of a wide range of subjects characterized Mescheloff throughout his life. It was a tremendous challenge to maintain uncompromising loyalty to halakha and to Torah tradition, while injecting them into Jewish life in America. There was a need to translate them into the concepts and the language of contemporary American Jews, and to be open to absorbing the best of American culture into Jewish life.Revel had many struggles in trying to balance these aims in the new American Yeshiva he was building. See Rothkoff, Aaron, Bernard Revel - Builder of American Jewish Orthodoxy, The Jewish Publication Society of America, Philadelphia, 1972 Mescheloff was among the first graduates of RIETS to meet this challenge in the Jewish communities of America, with the appropriate knowledge, commitment, skills and tools . By this time, Orthodox Jewish life in the United States was undergoing rapid change. The communities were becoming Americanized, as the mass immigration of Orthodox East European Jews had come to an end in 1924.See Rothkoff, Bernard Revel, p. 158 ff. RIETS began to ordain rabbis who were equipped to meet the challenges of life in America.The first RIETS Ordination Ceremony was held on March 23, 1919 with five graduates. In 1926 sixteen rabbis had been ordained, and twenty-seven had been ordained in 1929. A 1928 request from a congregation asked for \\"a conservative rabbi, who is well acquainted with the Talmud and Hebraic literature, and also well versed in English, and one who is familiar with all modern topics, who can keep the young people interested.\\" The response from RIETS described its rabbis as \\"mostly American born, college graduates and fully ordained, ... serving in the capacity of modern Orthodox rabbis. Of course, they deliver lectures in English and take part in all the activities at the synagogue, but they do not deviate from the traditional way of service. If you wish to have a man who was born in America, holding several degrees from colleges, an ordained rabbi who is, or course, well-versed in Hebrew, Talmud, codes and rabbinical literature, and is also an excellent speaker in both English and Yiddish, we shall be glad to recommend you one of our graduates. We wish, however, to emphasize that he is an orthodox rabbi.\\".Rothkoff, Bernard Revel, pp. 162-163. =Rabbinical Positions= Scranton Mescheloff's first rabbinical position was at Congregation Machzike Hadas, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, from 1932 to 1936. During that period, in 1935, Mescheloff married Magda (), Volume 9, Number 1, April 1935, p. 22. the second of the four children of Rabbi L√°z√°r () Sch√∂nfeld (Shabbat, 9 Av 5640 (July 17, 1880) - Friday, 9 Shevat 5733 (February 1, 1974)),A magyars√°g √©vfordul√≥napt√°ra, 2005 and Sarah (Shari in Hungarian, ) Sch√∂nfeld.They married on January 5, 1908.Sch√∂nfeld had been ordained at the Pressburger Yeshiva. He had studied at the College of Szeged, the University of Budapest and the University of Vienna, where he received the Ph.D. degree. Sch√∂nfeld had first served as rabbi of Pakrac and Vinkovci, Yugoslavia, from 1907 to 1912. You can read more about Jewish life in Vinkovci a few decades later, at http://www.centropa.org/index.php?nID=30&bioID;=177, and about the suffering of Rabbi Frankfurter, at http://www.state.nj.us/education/holocaust/downloads/curriculum/to_honor_all_children_file3.pdf, p. 61/380. Then, from 1912 to 1925, Sch√∂nfeld had served as chief rabbi of Nagyk√°roly, Hungary, after the untimely death of his father-in-law, Rabbi Ferenc () F√ºrth, at age 51; see http://mek.oszk.hu/04000/04093/html/0638.html or http://mek.oszk.hu/04000/04093/pdf/n.pdf; see also http://mek.oszk.hu/04000/04093/html/telepules.htm. Rabbi F√ºrth had served previously as rabbi of Hatvan; see 0354.png. In 1925 Rabbi Sch√∂nfeld brought his family to the United States, where he had gone to visit his brother, Michael. At Sarah's urging he had accepted the position of rabbi of Congregation Beth David Agudath Achim (\\"the Fox Street shul\\", or \\"the Hungarian shul\\"), at 832 Fox Street in the Bronx, New York; see http://www.bronxsynagogues.org/ic/bronxsyn/process.html?mv_nextpage=synsearch&mv;_todo=return&ssb;=browse&name;=832Fox, http://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/erc-syn-bronx.htm, http://www.bronxsynagogues.org/ic/bronxsyn/survey.html. After World War II, during the Cold War, Sch√∂nfeld broadcast sermons regularly in Hungarian for the Voice of America; see http://www.freepress- freespeech.com/holhome/tormay/m19452.htm ; see also https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E6DC133BF932A0575BC0A967948260 Mescheloff took care to introduce Magda to Revel and to receive his blessing. He saw Revel as his beloved Torah teacher, his role model and a very significant part of his life. North Adams After Mescheloff took the position of Rabbi of Congregation House of Israel, North Adams, Massachusetts (1936‚Äì1937), the Mescheloff's first of three children was born, a daughter, Renah Rachel (). In 1936 Revel was deeply involved in his efforts to make Yeshiva College a full-fledged University.See Rothkoff, Bernard Revel, pp.135-136, 205-208, and, especially, pp. 194-196. He needed funding, and contacted the famous Dr. Albert Einstein to lend his support. Revel also spoke to Rabbi Lazar Sch√∂nfeld, who spoke both German and Hungarian and was an acquaintance of Einstein. Einstein wrote a letter, in German, to Sch√∂nfeld, in which he spoke of the importance of Jewish education, and of the need for a Yeshiva where the ancient Jewish beliefs, wisdom and traditions are taught, in tandem with modern, scientific knowledge, where Jewish youth can learn without harassment and persecution. The letter was an introduction to and re- enforcement of Rabbi Revel's mission. Upon Sch√∂nfeld's death, the Einstein letter was willed to Rabbi and Mrs. Mescheloff. It was kept in its original envelope for many years, in the Mescheloff's safety deposit box. Upon the urging of Magda's brother, Frank Schonfeld, a 1939 graduate of Yeshiva College, the Mescheloff's presented it to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where it is now part of the extensive archive of Albert Einstein papers. A copy also went to The Yeshiva University Archives. Miami Beach In 1937, Mescheloff became the rabbi of Beth Jacob Congregation (\\"the Third Street shul\\") in Miami Beach, Florida, after the untimely, sudden passing of the previous rabbi.A group had met to organize the first congregation on Miami Beach in 1925. Two years later, Beth Jacob Congregation was incorporated and lasted until the end of the century, when they sold their properties to the Jewish Museum of Florida. See http://www.jewishmuseum.com/fjhmspeech08.html Four rabbis preceded Rabbi Mescheloff: The first rabbi was reportedly Rabbi David Yallow followed by Rabbis Hurowitz, Axelrod and David I. Rosenbloom, see: http://www.jewishmuseum.com/historicalbuildings.html. Beth Jacob was the only synagogue in Miami Beach at the time.Rothkoff describes a major challenge to Orthodoxy at that time, which persisted in various places for several decades, particularly in Chicago (see below), of maintaining separate pews for men and women in the synagogue (Bernard Revel, pp. 163-166): \\"Revel did not permit the Yeshiva to acquiesce to a congregation's introducing mixed pews. He insisted that the mechitza (partition, divider, screen) tradition be retained in the synagogue if a Yeshiva rabbinical graduate was to occupy its pulpit. There were instances when Revel did permit graduates to be interviewed by congregations with mixed pews, but only if the house of worship already had mixed pews and he felt that 'an able, diplomatic man could bring them back to the fold.' The rabbi was only authorized to accept the position if the congregation agreed to install a mechitza, or if the rabbi felt he had a reasonable chance of correcting the deviation. While ministering to the deviating synagogue, the rabbi corresponded with Revel to inform him of his progress. If the rabbi did not succeed within a year, Revel insisted that he leave the congregation.\\" Except that it was Revel who recommended that Mescheloff take the position in Miami Beach, Revel's attitude towards Beth Jacob in this respect is undocumented. Revel died, at the age of 55, on December 2, 1940, and Soloveichik died in 1941. Perhaps they would have insisted that Mescheloff leave Beth Jacob. Perhaps they found it acceptable that he stayed longer because, although Beth Jacob had no mechitza, yet it provided separate seating areas for men and for women on the left and right sides of the synagogue, respectively, with mixed seating in the center (Rothkoff quotes a 1925 letter to Revel of a 1921 Yeshiva graduate: \\"I accepted the minimum, the most liberal interpretation of what Orthodoxy calls for in the seating of the sexes in the synagogue. The vast majority sat according to the arrangement I demanded; only an insignificant number, a mere handful, yet important \\"Chatzuphim\\" [arrogant individuals] had it their way;\\" perhaps this arrangement was acceptable to Revel under the circumstances; see p. 160). Or perhaps they found it acceptable because of the unique situation in Miami Beach, where there was only one Orthodox congregation, and Mescheloff was building the Orthodox institutions of that city - mikvah, kashruth, Jewish education. Perhaps he was allowed to stay longer because of realities created by World War II. Perhaps, too, they expected that with his skills he would be able to bring about the construction of a mechitza in Beth Jacob, only that it would take longer to do so than in other cities. There were Restrictive covenants in the land deeds of one of South Florida's biggest real estate developers in the 1920s. That is why no Jews lived north of Miami Beach's Fifth Street until the 1940s, when such limitations became unenforceable and, later, illegal.Welcome‚Ä¶ Mescheloff made a major contribution towards completing the physical design of the synagogue. He designed its nearly 80 stained-glass windows.http://www.jewishmuseum.com/tour.html; a great variety of Jews came to Miami Beach and attended the synagogue - one of the windows was dedicated to the donor, Meyer Lansky He designed the bimah - the central platform for the public Torah reading - by carving a model out of a block of soap for the architect. Mescheloff played a leading role in establishing institutions for the rapid growth of the Jewish community in Miami Beach. He was the organizer and the Rav Hamachshir - the rabbi who certified the kashrut of food products and institutions - of the Vaad Hakashruth of Miami Beach. He served as President of the Dade County Rabbinical Association, Vice President of the Rabbinical Council of America, Vice President of the Florida Rabbinical Association, Chairman of the Jewish National Fund of South Florida, President of Greater Miami Mizrachi, Chairman of the Greater Miami Zionist Youth Commission, and Vice President of the Miami Beach Zionist District (ZOA). He led many adult education courses and was responsible for a large Hebrew school. Most important was the building of a mikvah. Mescheloff led in the building of the first mikvah in Miami Beach. Those who questioned the need for a mikvah had to be won over. The mikvah was built during World War II at a time when, due to limited supplies of cement, special permits were required for building concrete structures, and such a permit had to be obtained for the mikvah. In 1939, before World War II, the Mescheloff's second child was born, a son, Efrom Zev (). It was also important to establish good relations between the Jewish community and the community at large, to overcome latent anti- Semitism. Mescheloff served as Secretary of the Association of Miami Beach Interfaith Clergy. He was featured on the radio for three years in South Florida as a member of a panel of \\"Men of Good Will\\". He spoke regularly on another station promoting the cause of Zionism and the sale of Jewish National Fund trees. When Miami Beach was taken over by the military during World War II for the training of new recruits, Rabbi Mescheloff became a civilian chaplain overnight. He was called for religious services and was flown to the men in the field where he counseled soldiers, and at home he counseled their frightened wives and parents. It was during this time that Mescheloff became a member of the delegation who sought to save the refugees on the ship, SS St. Louis. Denied entry into Havana, Cuba, the ship sought sanctuary in the United States by docking in Miami. The delegation of some of the most prominent rabbis of the U.S. could not convince officials in Miami or Washington DC, that this was a question of life or death. Sadly the ship returned to Germany and the fate of the refugees was sealed; very few survived the European Holocaust. In 1945, after World War II was over, the Mescheloff's youngest son, David Joseph (), was born. Revel had instituted the policy of inviting great European and Palestinian rabbis to give guest lectures before the yeshiva students at RIETS.Rothkoff, Bernard Revel, pp. 123-125, 155-157. Mescheloff invited many famous European rabbis, who came to Miami beach to lecture and raise funds for their yeshivot, to speak from the pulpit at Beth Jacob. He felt it was important for American Jews to experience that Torah greatness.*As I Knew Him: Memories of Rabbi Dr. Bernard Revel, yucommentator.com During the seventeen years that Mescheloff served in Miami Beach, he performed many hundreds of weddings, and, on the other hand, headed the Beth Din (Jewish ecclesiastical court) that presided over the writing of Jewish bills of divorce. In Miami Beach he came to know many highly regarded men in a more personal way, as Miami Beach became an increasingly popular winter vacation spot for visitors from the North. Chicago In 1954, Mescheloff moved to Chicago, in time to celebrate Hanukkah with his new congregation in West Rogers Park, Chicago, Congregation K.I.N.S. (Knesset Israel Nusach Sfard) of West Rogers Park.The Congregation was the product of a merger between the new, local West Rogers Park Congregation, that prayed in the Ashkenazic liturgical style, and Congregation K.I.N.S., which had been on Chicago's old \\"West Side\\" Jewish neighborhood, but which had emptied out as Jews moved out en masse to new neighborhoods in the southern and northern edges of the city and to the suburbs. K.I.N.S. had followed the Sephardic liturgical style. Rabbi Joseph Lookstein was the installing officer and guest speaker at his installation, on January 9, 1955.Chicago Jewry retained \\"traditional\\" (\\"Conservadox\\") settings, attached to Orthodoxy with several aberrations: there was no mechitza (see note 39, above), and there was a microphone activated by a non-Jew on Shabbat. The seating arrangement at West Rogers Park Congregation was like that of Beth Jacob in Miami Beach. As a result of the merger that created KINS of West Rogers Park, all daily services were held in the smaller synagogue chapel (Bet Midrash), according to the Sephardic rite, and a mechitza was installed in the chapel. Shabbat morning and Holiday services were held in the large synagogue hall, according to the Ashkenazic rite, with the above-mentioned seating arrangement. In the late 1960s, when Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik came to head the yeshiva in Chicago, he held that Orthodox Jewry had already become stronger, to the point that a rabbi could insist that a synagogue have a mechitza without having to fear the loss of congregants. Indeed, he insisted that each of the rabbis, in the group that he ordained at the Hebrew Theological College in 1968, sign an undertaking never to serve as rabbi in a synagogue without a mechitza. Many years later, in the 1990s, after Orthodox Judaism had become much stronger in Chicago and the composition of the West Rogers Park community had changed, Rabbi Mescheloff's congregation merged with a congregation headed by Rabbi Leonard Matanky, and a mechitza was installed in the large hall as well. This was a second period of major crisis for American Orthodox Jewish life. Sociologists and social scientists were proclaiming the end of Orthodoxy in America.A typical statement was \\"Orthodox Judaism seems on the wane in America. It may linger for awhile...\\", in \\"The Jew in America Since World War II\\", by Hugh H. Smythe and Jerry J. Pine, in Phylon (1940-1956), Vol. 16, No. 1 (1st Qtr., 1955), pp. 65-70, Clark Atlanta University. Its European roots and lifeline had been destroyed in The Holocaust, and it was thought to be unable to maintain itself in the face of the newfound Jewish freedom and rampant assimilation in America.Edward S. Shapiro gave a good rational explanation to the expected disappearance of Orthodoxy in America after World War II in his \\"Introduction\\" to American Jewish History - Volume 84, Number 4, December 1996, pp. 285-289, The Johns Hopkins University Press: \\"The motto on the Great Seal of the United States is \\"novus ordo seclorum\\"--a new order of the ages. The revolutionary nature of America was particularly true for Jews. For thousands of years they had lived in states in Europe and the Arab countries in which anti-Semitism was actively promoted or tacitly encouraged by the political authorities. Life in America, by contrast, was remarkable for the relative absence of official anti-Semitism. Here there were neither powerful anti-Semitic political parties or officially sanctioned barriers to the social and economic advancement of Jews, and the local and national governments protected the property and lives of Jews. As Washington noted in his famous letter of 1790 to the Newport, Rhode Island, synagogue, the policy of the United States was neither to sanction bigotry or to assist persecution. \\"The children of the stock of Abraham\\" and Christians will \\"possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities and citizenship.\\" While America was not the Promised Land, to Jews it was the land of promise, and for every Jew who settled in Palestine between 1880-1920, at least forty immigrated to the United States. Not surprisingly, it was a Jew (Irving Berlin) who composed \\"God Bless America\\" and another Jew (Emma Lazarus) who wrote \\"The New Colossus,\\" ... Mescheloff worked devotedly on behalf of Torah in his congregation.One of the early improvements he made concerned the synagogue fund-raising event held the night after Yom Kippur, \\"The Yom Kippur Night Ball\\". This was reminiscent of a particularly odious carryover from the earlier crisis in American Jewish life; see Rothkoff, Bernard Revel, pp. 6-7, 26. At first the event was rescheduled to a different date, to separate it from Yom Kippur. Later, the use of a dance as a fund-raising technique, so inappropriate for an Orthodox Jewish synagogue, was replaced by other techniques, including an art fair, inspired for many years by Magda Mescheloff, who contributed numerous art works of her own to the fund-raising event. The synagogue had a very large Hebrew and Sunday School, with many hundreds of students for over twenty years. Moses Mescheloff oversaw the school, encouraging students to continue their education in more intense Jewish educational environments. He officiated at thousands of Bar-Mitzvahs and Bat-Mitzvahs. He also performed thousands of weddings, visited thousands of sick people, comforted the bereaved, and officiated at funerals and memorial services. For twenty-eight years he conducted weekly Talmud classes, organized adult education courses at the synagogue, and was one of the lecturers. The cumulative effect of his life's work was to leave an indelible imprint on the lives of tens of thousands for whom he ministered at crucial turning points in their lives. Mescheloff also worked tirelessly for the advancement of Torah living in the general Jewish community. He made a major contribution to bringing about the renaissance of the Orthodox Jewish community in America. Through his religious Zionist work he also made a major contribution to the renaissance of Torah true Jewish life in Israel. Over the years Rabbi Mescheloff held many positions in Chicago. He served as president of the Chicago Rabbinical Council (CRC), president of the Chicago Religious Zionist Council and president of the Chicago Board of Rabbis. He was Chairman of the CRC's Publication Committee. Together with Rabbi Schachnowitz, he was co-chairman of the Joint Vaad Hakashruth of the CRC and the Mercaz Harabbonim. He was a member of Chicago's Jewish Community Relations Council, the Council for Jewish Elderly and was involved in many public causes. He was featured on the radio in a series of lectures on World literature and appeared on Chicago television programs presented by the Chicago Board of Rabbis, including several series: \\"The Jewish Court\\", \\"Some of My Best Friends\\", and \\"Sanctuary\\". Mescheloff was called upon frequently to open Chicago City Council meetings with an invocation. On one of these occasions, on May 13, 1981, the Mayor received word that Pope John Paul II had been shot. Mescheloff, still in the Council chambers, was called upon to offer prayers for his recovery. His non-sectarian prayer was then re-broadcast throughout that day. He served as an officer or a member of the Board of the Mayor's Advisory Council on Human Relations, the Chicago Commission on Race and Religion, the North Town Community Council, the North Town Inter-faith Fellowship, the Chicago Inter-religious Council for the Homeless, the Mayor's Advisory Council for the Department on Aging, and the North Town/Rogers Park Division for Chicago's Mental Health Association. Mescheloff was elected by the Hall of Fame Selection Committee and inducted by Mayor Richard M. Daley into Chicago's Senior Hall of Fame, at a full session of the City Council on May 25, 1989. Mescheloff was honored by the city of Chicago on May 1, 2002, when Vice-Mayor Alderman Bernard L. Stone unveiled a street sign in front of the entrance to Congregation K.I.N.S., \\"Honorary Rabbi Moses Mescheloff Street\\". Stone noted that \\"Not only did he have all the attributes of a rabbi ‚Äî knowledgeable, articulate ‚Äî he was an exceptionally kind and gentle man.\\"Rabbi Dr. Moses Mescheloff, longtime Chicago religious leader, dies at age 98 - Religious Events, Skokie, Bernard Stone - chicagotribune.com Mescheloff was a member of the Rabbinical Council of America (RCA) from 1935 until his death, for seventy-five years. He contributed annually to the RCA's Sermon Manual for as long as it was published. Subsequently, he contributed sermons to the RCA's holiday brochures, as well as scholarly articles for the RCA's Hadarom (in Hebrew). He also wrote scholarly articles for Oraita (in Israel), and Chadashot (CRC) and has written articles on Judaism and on Jewish life for the Chicago Sentinel, Hadassah Women and AMIT Women magazines. The Legal Encyclopedia, \\"Florida Law on the Family, Marriage and Divorce\\" includes his chapter, entitled \\"Procedure in Obtaining a Jewish Divorce\\". See a partial list of his publications below. In 1980 Mescheloff received the degree Doctor of Hebrew Literature from the graduate school of the Hebrew Theological College of Skokie, Illinois, Summa Cum Laude. He is listed in the Biographical Encyclopedia of American Jews,Glassman, Leo M. (ed.). - Biographical encyclopaedia of American Jews: 1935. New York, Maurice Jacobs & Leo M. Glassman, 1935. 606 pp., Over 2500 short biographies. \`This volume was conceived, planned and compiled as an historical record of participation by American citizens of Jewish origin in every phase of contemporary American civilization'.

After ten years, the congregation signed a life contract with Mescheloff. From 1982 he served as Rabbi Emeritus. Mescheloff worked in close cooperation and mutual respect and admiration with the two rabbis who followed him, in succession, as spiritual leaders of the congregation. They sat together at the front of the congregation during services. Rabbi Dr. Leonard Matanky has continued to lead the congregation as the central religious zionist synagogue in the Midwest, continuing the tradition of deep involvement in Jewish education and other Jewish and civic activities. When each new rabbi was away, Mescheloff would deliver sermons and teach Torah classes in his absence. Mescheloff's communal work continued apace well into his mid-nineties. He could be seen walking to the synagogue daily at a pace that tired young men who might accompany him, sitting in the Beit Midrash, attending lectures in halakha by Rabbi Gedalia Dov Schwartz, the head of the Bet Din of the RCA and the CRC, listening intently to Talmud lessons over the internet, and preparing Torah messages. Mescheloff made himself available to others for discussing Torah, academic and Jewish community issues of all types.\\"Rabbi Moses Mescheloff, rabbi emeritus of Congregation KINS, was always there to discuss scholarly topics and help me focus my ideas. He listened to most of my ideas for my monthly column before I wrote them wrote them down. See Stuhlman, Daniel, \\"Hebrew Names and Name Authority in Library Catalogs\\", D.H.L. dissertation, 2004, p.4 at http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/465/12/Stuhlman_Daniel.pdf, and see http://home.earthlink.net/~ddstuhlman/crc84.pdf. A few months before Mescheloff's ninety-ninth birthday, he took ill, and died, in Chicago, on Friday, 4 Iyyar 5768 (May 9, 2008)). He was interred in Mount Moriah Cemetery in Fairview, New Jersey, near his in-laws, Rabbi Dr. and Mrs. Schonfeld. He was survived by his wife of seventy-three years, Magda, their three children, sixteen grandchildren, and nearly sixty great-grandchildren, the great majority of whom are in Israel. The Mescheloff children followed in their parents' path: Renah (married to Rabbi Alexander Bell), Rabbi Dr. Efrom Mescheloff (married to Felice, n√©e Rosenberg), and Rabbi Dr. David Mescheloff (married to Irene, n√©e Goldschmidt). The two sons are both members of the Rabbinical Council of America, and both immigrated to Israel and established large Orthodox Jewish families there. Mescheloff's semikhah bears the signature of Rabbi Moshe Soloveitchik, who was the Rosh yeshiva of RIETS during the 1930s. Mescheloff was one of thirteen rabbis ordained in America by Moshe Soloveitchik. The semicha of Mescheloff's older son, Efrom, was signed by Soloveitchik's son, Rabbi Joseph Dov Soloveitchik, who followed his father as Rosh Yeshiva of RIETS. Mescheloff's younger son, David, received his semicha from the Hebrew Theological College of Skokie, where a younger son of Soloveitchik's, Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik, then the Rosh Yeshiva, signed his semikhah.

It was decided under the Human Rights Act 1998. Facts A girl insisted that wearing a purity ring at school was a manifestation of her religious beliefs as a Christian. Her school had a policy against jewellery, and she was told she was not allowed to wear it. She claimed that it violated her right to freedom of religion, under Art.9 ECHR. She was represented by Paul Diamond. Judgment Michael Supperstone QC held in the Administrative Court that not only was the wearing of the ring not linked to a belief in chastity before marriage, but that it was not any requirement of the Christian faith. The uniform policy, which she had accepted by going to the school, did not create any undue hardship. The policy was prescribed by law in the legitimate pursuit of creating equality and cohesion, minimising pressure from markings of difference in wealth or status.

His father and his elder brother Henry were killed at the Battle of Evesham in August 1265. The younger Simon had been slow to bring his forces from London, and had seen them and their banners captured by Prince Edward, who then used the banners to trick Simon's father. He arrived at Evesham just in time to see his father's head atop a pike. The younger Simon tried to raise a rebellion in Lincolnshire, but this petered out by Christmas. In 1266, Simon and his supporters were now stuck in Kenilworth Castle, which was previously owned by his father. Having promised to surrender the castle to King Henry III of England, Simon later changed his mind and so the King decided to siege the castle on 21 June. The siege lasted six months, making it possibly the longest siege ever conducted on the British Isles. Simon surrendered the castle to the King on 14 December. After the surrender at Kenilworth, Simon and his younger brother Guy escaped to France and Italy: in 1271 they discovered and murdered their cousin Henry of Almain (whom they blamed for the death of their father) at the church in Viterbo, for which they were excommunicated. Simon died later that year from Toscana virus at Siena, \\"cursed by God, a wanderer and a fugitive\\". Ancestors Note Alternatively Simon VII. The discrepancy in numbering arises from confusion between Simon III de Montfort (died 1181) and his son Simon de Montfort (died 1188). The latter was historically unknown, and Simon III was believed to be the father (not the grandfather) of the crusader Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester, who is therefore known as Simon IV in some sources and Simon V in others.

It was written by Enda Walsh and McQueen. It premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, winning the prestigious Cam√©ra d'Or award for first-time filmmakers. It went on to win the Sydney Film Prize at the Sydney Film Festival, the Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics, best picture from the Evening Standard British Film Awards, and received two BAFTA nominations, winning one. The film was also nominated for eight awards at the 2009 IFTAs, winning six at the event. The film stars Fassbender as Bobby Sands, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) member who led the second IRA hunger strike and participated in the no wash protest (led by Brendan \\"The Dark\\" Hughes) in which Irish republican prisoners tried to regain political status after it had been revoked by the British government in 1976. It outlines events in the Maze Prison in the period leading up to the hunger strike and its aftermath. Plot Prison officer Raymond Lohan prepares to leave for work; he cleans his wounded knuckles, checks his car for bombs, puts his uniform on, and ignores his comrades. Davey Gillen, a new IRA prisoner, arrives; he is categorised as a \\"non-conforming prisoner\\" for his refusal to wear the prison uniform. He is sent to his cell naked with only a blanket. His cellmate, Gerry Campbell, has smeared the walls with faeces from floor to ceiling as part of the no wash protest. Gerry's girlfriend sneaks a radio in by wrapping it and storing it in her vagina. Prison officers forcibly and violently remove the prisoners from their cells and beat them before pinning them down to cut their long hair and beards, grown as part of the no-wash protest. The prisoners resist, with prisoner Bobby Sands spitting into Lohan's face. He responds by punching Sands in the face and then swings again, only to miss and punch the wall, causing his knuckles to bleed. He cuts Sands' hair and beard; the men throw Sands in the bathtub and scrub him clean before hauling him away again. Later, the prisoners are taken out of their cells and given second-hand civilian clothing. The guards snicker as they hand the clothes to the prisoners who respond, after Sands' initial action, by tearing up the clothes and wrecking their cells. A large number of riot police enter the prison on a truck. The prisoners are hauled from their cells and forced to run the gauntlet between the lines of riot police, where they are beaten with batons by at least 10 men at once. Lohan and several of his colleagues then probe first their rectums and then their mouths, using the same pair of latex gloves for each man. Lohan visits his catatonic mother in a retirement home. He is shot in the back of the head by an IRA assassin and dies slumped onto his mother's lap. Sands meets Father Dominic Moran and discusses the morality of a hunger strike. Sands tells the priest about a trip to Donegal where he and his friends found a foal by a stream that had cut itself on the rocks and broken its back legs. Sands drowned the foal and tells the priest that although he got into trouble, he knew he had done the right thing by ending its suffering. He then says he knows what he is doing and what it will do to him but refuses to stand by and do nothing. Some time later, Sands is well into his hunger strike; he suffers from weeping sores, kidney failure, low blood pressure and stomach ulcers. While Sands lies in a bath, a larger orderly comes in to give his usual orderly a break. The larger orderly sits next to the tub and shows Sands his knuckles, which are tattooed with the letters \\"UDA\\". Sands tries to stand on his own and eventually does so with all his strength, staring defiantly at the UDA orderly. He then crumbles in a heap on the floor with no strength left to stand. The orderly carries him to his room. Sands' parents stay for the final days, his mother being at his side when Sands dies, 66 days after beginning the strike. A series of closing titles state that Sands was elected to the United Kingdom Parliament as MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone while he was on strike. Nine other men died with him during the seven-month strike before it was called off. 16 prison officers were killed by paramilitaries throughout the protests depicted in the film. Shortly afterwards, the British government conceded in one form or another to virtually all of the prisoners' five demands despite never officially granting political status.

In preparation for his role, Michael Fassbender went on a special diet of less than 900 calories a day for ten weeks. After meeting with a nutritionist, he settled on a diet of berries, nuts, and sardines, and underwent periodic medical checks. In an interview with The Telegraph, Fassbender said that he skipped, did yoga, and walked four and a half miles a day, but also added that he had difficulty sleeping, and stopped seeing friends. He also said that the experience made him feel \\"grateful\\" and \\"strong\\". The film is also notable for an unbroken 17-minute shot, in which a priest played by Liam Cunningham tries to talk Bobby Sands out of his protest. In it, the camera remains in the same position for the duration of the entire shot. To prepare for the scene, Cunningham moved into Michael Fassbender's apartment for a time while they practiced the scene between twelve and fifteen times a day. According to Fassbender, they did only five takes. Release Hunger premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 15 May 2008, where it opened the official sidebar section, Un Certain Regard, sparking both walkouts and a standing ovation, before screening at the Sydney Film Festival on 7 June, the Toronto International Film Festival on 6 September, the New York Film Festival on 27 September, and the Chicago International Film Festival on 19 October 2008. The film was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 31 October 2008. =Critical reception= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 90% based on 127 reviews, with an average score of 7.8/10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"Unflinching, uncompromising, vivid and vital, Steve McQueen's challenging debut is not for the faint hearted, but it's still a richly rewarding retelling of troubled times.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times spoke most positively of the piece stating, \\"Hunger is not about the rights and wrongs of the British in Northern Ireland, but about inhumane prison conditions, the steeled determination of IRA members like Bobby Sands, and a rock and a hard place.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, regarded the film highly and said: \\"Shockingly immediate and philosophically reflective, Hunger is an indelibly moving tribute to what makes us human.\\" and praised \\"... McQueen's way of showing the body itself as an arsenal, arguably the last weapon any of us have to fight back.\\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian scored the piece a maximum five stars, writing, \\"There is an avoidance of affect and a repudiation of the traditional liberal-lenient gestures of dialogue, dramatic consensus and narrative resolution. This is a powerful, provocative piece of work, which leaves a zero-degree burn on the retina.\\" while praising McQueen's work, \\"Hunger shows that McQueen is a real film-maker and his background in art has meant a fierce concentration on image, an unflinching attention to what things looked like, moment by moment.\\" Lauren Wissot of Slant Magazine said of the film, \\"Hunger, with all its visual, sonic and editing elements flowing together in harmony like a five-star, six-course meal, exemplifies the phrase [art film].\\" and that, \\"McQueen's film is a nuanced masterpiece that never flaunts its artistry, but uses it humbly to serve the all-important story.\\" Nigel Andrews of the Financial Times heralded the film and its director, Steve McQueen, \\"McQueen understands the first principle of cinema. On either side of its middle section, where the very wordiness stands ironic witness to the ultimate impossibility to explain, Hunger has the power and hieratic integrity of silent cinema.\\" Matthew De Abaitua of Film4 scored the film five out of five stars, \\"Intense, disturbing and powerful mix of vision and detail: a recreation of a terrible time combined with a vivid and distinctive artistic sensibility. Truly powerful filmmaking.\\" Ian Freer of Empire magazine praised both McQueen and Fassbender, proclaiming, \\"Anchored by Fassbender's turn, Hunger is as much about the personal as the political. The real breakthrough, though, is McQueen, who turns in a film that dazzles and challenges in equal measure.\\" Dave Calhoun of Time Out, gave the film a maximum five stars, stating \\"Imagine how most filmmakers would tell this story and then see 'Hunger': the differences are bold and powerful and restore faith in cinema's ability to cover history free from the bounds of texts and personalities. It's not an easy watch ‚Äì but it's an invigorating one. Long live McQueen.\\" Noel Murray, writing for The A.V. Club highlighted \\"Hunger may be criticized for being willfully arty, or for reducing a complex political situation to a broadly allegorical vision of martyrdom, but it's never less than visually stunning.\\" Critic J. Hoberman of The Village Voice called the film, \\"A superbly balanced piece of work\\" and a \\"compelling drama that's also a formalist triumph.\\" Hoberman went on to say, \\"I've seen Hunger three times, and with each screening, the spectacle of violence, suffering, and pain becomes more awful and more awe-inspiring.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave Hunger an A- on an A+ to F scale and stated, \\"For your art-house pleasure and discomfort, here's one of the most talked-about film-festival triumphs of 2008, a disturbingly avid re-creation of the last six weeks in the life and slow, self-imposed wasting of Irish hunger striker Bobby Sands.\\" Writing for The New York Post, Kyle Smith praised McQueen's film, \\"Regardless of politics, one must grant McQueen's substantial gifts, which bring to mind Paul Greengrass in another Northern Ireland film, Bloody Sunday.\\" Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave the film a maximum of four out of four stars, \\"Hunger -- the disturbing, provocative, brilliant feature debut from British director Steve McQueen -- does for modern film what Caravaggio did to Renaissance painting.\\" Reyhan Harmanci of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, \\"It's horrific. But Hunger displays uncommon intelligence and visual panache, transcending the goal of making the situation seem real. It feels more than real. It's art.\\" in addition to praising McQueen's work by stating \\"Steve McQueen is a well-known visual artist turned feature film director who makes you wish more moviemakers went to art school.\\" Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post was very praising of the film, writing, \\"McQueen has taken the raw materials of filmmaking and committed an act of great art.\\" and calling the piece \\"An artistic masterpiece.\\" Wendy Ide of The Times praised McQueen's directing and screenwriting talents by stating, \\"Ultimately, the one thing that can't be questioned is McQueen's bold and unflinching talent.\\" =Accolades= The film appeared on some critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008. Andrea Gronvall of Chicago Reader named it the 3rd best film of 2008, and Scott Foundas of LA Weekly named it the 3rd best film of 2008 (along with Che).

Facts Mr Copsey was working in a sand quarry near King's Lynn. The work schedule was changed to keep pace with growing production. Although changes to the timetable were approved by most other workers in the plant, in consultation Mr Copsey was not happy, and he raised objection with four others. He did not want to work Sundays. Mr Copsey was offered another job where he would not have to work Sundays. He refused that. He was also offered a generous redundancy package instead. He still refused. He then said that the change, to make him work Sundays breached his fundamental human right to freedom of religion, as a Christian. This was protected under Art.9 ECHR. He was represented by Paul Diamond. Judgment Mummery LJ in the Court of Appeal held that interference with this right was justified in the pursuit of a legitimate aim (to run an effective business). The employer had done everything to accommodate his needs, and so when he refused alternative offers and still refused to work, his dismissal was fair. He was not dismissed because he was a Christian believer, but simply because his religious requirements were not compatible with the job.
