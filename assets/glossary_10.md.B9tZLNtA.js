The asteroid 9 Metis was discovered from this observatory in 1848 by Cooper's assistant Andrew Graham using a comet seeker telecope. (Signed 29 April 1848; the discovery was first announced on 27 April) The observatory was also home to the largest refractor of the early 1830s, which had a aperture Cauchoix of Paris lens; the largest in the world at that time. The observatory also housed a number of instruments and was operated to varying degrees throughout the 19th century. The observatory is noted for its discovery of the asteroid 9 Metis in 1848 as well as a 60,000 item star catalogue of the 1850s. In the later 1800s it was operated again after a brief hiatus, and gained note for its meteorological observations and research on double stars. History The entrance gateIn 1830, Colonel Edward Joshua Cooper MP (1798‚Äì1863) eldest son of Edward Synge Cooper MP, and Ann, daughter of Henry Vansittart, Governor of Bengal, set up Markree Observatory on the grounds of Markree Castle near Collooney in County Sligo. In 1831 Cooper acquired from Robert A. Cauchoix of Paris an objective of 13.3-inches (~33.78 cm) for which he paid ¬£1200. In 1834 he mounted the lens on an equatorial mounting supplied by Thomas Grubb of Dublin. For a number of years Cooper‚Äôs big refractor was the largest in the world. He used the telescope to sketch Halley's comet in 1835 and to view the solar eclipse of 15 May 1836.History of the Cauchoix objective Later a 5-foot (1.5m) transit and a 3-foot (0.9m) meridian circle, fitted with an interchangeable 7-inch (17.75 cm) glass were added, which was the largest at that time in 1839; also in 1842 a 3-inch comet seeker was added. The observatory had a Stevenson screen, invented in 1863. \\"The Observatory of Mr Cooper of Markree Castleundoubtedly the most richly furnished private observatory knownis worked with great activity by Mr Cooper himself and by his very able assistant, Mr Andrew Graham.\\" (Royal Astronomical Society, 1851) In 1848, Cooper‚Äôs assistant, Andrew Graham, discovered the asteroid 9 Metis with a wide-field comet seeker telescope manufactured by Ertel. Graham resigned his post at Markree in 1860, but continued his research at Cambridge Observatory until his retirement in 1905. E.J. Cooper died in 1863, but the observatory remained active until the death of Edward Henry Cooper MP in 1902.  The 13+ inch Cauchoix  The Cauchoix telescope was installed inside a circular wall, but it had no dome or roof over it. The enclosure has a diameter of 16-feet across. The telescope mounting was made by Grubb of Dublin. (Grubb would make telescopes for a century and half, later known as Grubb-Parsons) The telescope objective was doublet with 13.3 inches of aperture and 25 feet focal length. The Grubb mounting had a clockwork drive and weighed almost 2.4 metric tons (2.6 US tons), which rested on a limestone pillar. The lens was ground by Cauchoix of Paris using glass blanks by Guinand. The 13.3 inch lens was completed in 1831. Guinand was a Frenchman who in the late 1700s came up with a breakthrough for making better quality and larger glass, and in time went on to teach a young Fraunhofer at Utzschinder's glassworks, and eventually started his own optical glass works. Guinand would supply glass for the Paris Observatory telescopes and also Cauchoix.

Life He studied theology at Halle and Breslau (1826‚Äì1829), and settled in Leipzig in 1832. Here he at once came into prominence with his political essays, collected under the title Das neue Jahrhundert, in two parts ‚Äî Polen (1833) and Politische Briefe (1833) ‚Äî and with the novel Das junge Europa, in three parts ‚Äî Die Poeten, Die Krieger, Die B√ºrger ‚Äî (1833‚Äì1837). These writings, in which, after the fashion of Heinrich Heine and Ludwig B√∂rne, he severely criticized the political regime in Germany, together with the part he played in the literary movement known as ‚ÄúDas junge Deutschland,‚Äù led to his being subjected to police surveillance and his works confiscated. On his return, in 1834, from a journey to Italy, undertaken in the company of Karl Gutzkow, Laube was expelled from Saxony and imprisoned for nine months in Berlin. In 1836 he married the widow of Professor Hanel of Leipzig; almost immediately afterwards he suffered a year's imprisonment for his revolutionary sympathies. In 1839 he again settled in Leipzig and began a literary activity as a playwright. Chief among his earlier productions are the tragedies Monaldeschi (1845) and Struensee (1847); the comedies Rokoko, oder die alten Herren (1846); Gottsched und Gellert (1847); and Die Karlssch√ºler (1847), of which the youthful Friedrich Schiller is the hero. In 1848 Laube was elected to the Frankfurt Parliament for the district of Elbogen, but resigned in the spring of 1849, when he was appointed artistic director of the Hofburg theatre in Vienna. This office he held until 1867, and in this period fall his finest dramatic productions, notably the tragedies Graf Essex (1856) and Montrose (1859), and his historical romance Der deutsche Krieg (1865‚Äì1866, 9 vols), which graphically pictures a period in the Thirty Years' War. In 1869 he became director of the Leipzig Stadttheater, but returned to Vienna in 1870, where in 1872 he was placed at the head of the new Stadttheater; with the exception of a short interval he managed this theatre with brilliant success until his retirement from public life in 1880. He has left a valuable record of his work in Vienna and Leipzig in the three volumes Das Burgtheater (1868), Das norddeutsche Theater (1872) and Das Wiener Stadttheater (1875). His pen was still active after his retirement, and in the five years preceding his death, which took place at Vienna on 1 August 1884, he wrote the romances and novels Die B√∂hminger (1880), Louison (1881), Der Schatten-Wilhelm (1883), and published an interesting volume of reminiscences, Erinnerungen, 1841-1881 (1882). Assessment Laube's dramas are not remarkable for originality or for poetical beauty; their real and great merit lies in their stage-craft. As a theater manager he had no equal in Germany, and his services in this capacity have assured him a more lasting name in German literary history than his writings. Works=Other novels Besides those mentioned above, other of his novels of note are: *Das Gl√ºck (1837) *Der Pr√§tendent (1842) *Die Grafin Chateaubriand (1843) Other dramas Other dramas of note include: *B√∂se Zungen (1868) *Demetrius (1872) Collected works His Gesammelte Schriften (excluding his dramas) were published in 16 vols (1875‚Äì1882); his Dramatische Werke, in 13 vols (1845‚Äì1875); a popular edition of the latter in 12 vols (1880‚Äì1892).

The organization caters to players from all leagues, including the minor leagues. The organization was started by 12 former players in Los Angeles and now has over 101,000 members. Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and other stars of the 1920's spearheaded the development of the APBPA to help former players who were in need financially or experiencing illness or injuries. History The proceeds from the 1934 Major League Baseball (MLB) All-Star Game, which was estimated at between $45,000‚Äì$50,000 (), went to the APBPA. The 1935 MLB All- Star Game in Cleveland, Ohio took in $92,692 () in proceeds for the APBPA. In 1941, the Pacific Coast League (PCL) held its first annual PCL All-Star Game and the proceeds for the game were donated to the APBPA. In 1982, the Old Timers Baseball Classic was created. The event, which was a game between two teams made up of retired baseball players, was sponsored by Cracker Jack and took place in Washington, D.C. at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium. Part of the proceeds from the game, which was attended by 29,196 people, went to the APBPA. The game became an annual event and parts of the games proceeds went to the APBPA until at least 1989. A 1986 profile of the APBPA by Los Angeles Times sportswriter Chris Dufresne detailed acts of charity by the organization and expounded upon how they distributed funds. Players were allowed to start taking assistance before their Major League Baseball Players Association pension kicked in at 45 years of age. w The APBPA takes membership dues from professional baseball players and issues membership cards. Pete Coscarart was issued an APBPA \\"Gold Card\\" which allowed him free admittance to professional baseball games. An award given out by the APBPA known as the Chuck Stevens Award, named for the organization's former secretary-treasurer, is given out annually to the best minor league baseball player from Southern California. While in past years the APBPA did not assist players who were experiencing drug addiction, the association currently offers assistance for former players with problems with drug, alcohol, and other addictions and has recently appointed a Director of Addiction Services to help former players. The current president of the APBPA is Jennifer Madison, who served as the former Executive Director of the APBPA. Known for her energy and progressive and proactive thinking, Ms. Madison has established several programs within the APBPA including: the development of a partnership with GIOSTAR Labs launching the non-profit Stem Cells for All initiative where some members have received Stem Cell Therapy; appointing Maryann Castello (Neos Zoe-New Jersey) as the Director of Holistic Health and Wellness, and Dr. Drayton \\"Smoke\\" Patterson, the first Ph.D. Psychologist to sign a Professional Minor League Player/Manager contract (Mid-America League), as the Director of Mental Health Services and Resources and an Ambassador for the APBPA. According to Roland Hemond in 2012, the APBPA has helped 3,000 professional baseball players. In 2012, the APBPA announced it would be offering long-term care insurance through LTC Financial Partners to 11,000 of its members.

Exposing the intimate parts of the body is unlawful in Islam as the Quran instructs the covering of male and female genitals, and for adult females the breasts. Exposing them is normally considered sinful. Exposing intimate parts when needed, such as going to the toilet or bathing, falls under a specific set of rules. Precisely which body parts must be covered varies between different schools of Islamic thought. The Quran admonishes Muslim women to dress modestly and cover their breasts and genitals.Martin et al. (2003), Encyclopedia of Islam & the Muslim World, Macmillan Reference, The Quran explicitly states that \\"O wives of the Prophet, you are not like anyone among women\\" (Quran 33: 32) and as such has separate rules specifically for the wives of the Prophet. Etymology In Arabic, the term 'awrah or 'awrat () derives from the root ‚Äò-w-r which means \\"defectiveness\\", \\"imperfection\\", \\"blemish\\" or \\"weakness\\". However, the most common English translation is \\"nakedness\\".Wehr Arabic-English Dictionary pg 131 In Persian and Kurdish as well as Urdu, the word 'awrat () derived from the Arabic 'awrah, had been used widely to mean \\"woman\\". Consulting Mohammad Moin's dictionary of Persian, 'awrah leads to two significations: # Nakedness # Young womanMoin Dictionary, 1994 Other derivatives range in meaning from blind in one eye, false or artificial, among others.El Guindy, Awrah, page 141 Traditionally the word 'awrat, alongside the word za'ifeh (which derives from Arabic ·∏ça'ƒ´f (), meaning weak) has been associated with femininity and women who lived under the protection of a man. In modern-day Iran, using the two words ( 'awrah and za'ifah) to refer to women is uncommon and is considered sexist language. Instead, the words zan and x√¢nom are used. In Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, the word za'if is still used in the Tajik dialect of Persian and its subdialects. In Turkish, avrat is an often derogatory term for 'woman' or 'wife'. In the Quran Muslims performing the ritual prayer. During the Salat, the awrah must be covered. The term 'awrah as it is used in the Quran is confined neither to women nor to the body. The Quranic text reveals the use of the term in various passages Surah An-Nur and Surah Al-Ahzab. The below verse is about privacy as the Quranic text states: > \\"... and let those among you who have not yet come to the age of puberty ask > your permission (before they come to your presence) on three occasions; > before the morning prayer, and while you put off your clothes for the > noonday (rest), and after the late-night prayer. (These) three times are of > privacy for you, other than these times there is no sin on you or on them to > move about, attending (helping) each other.\\"Quran 24:58-Sura Al-Nur Another passage in the Quran that uses the term 'awrah, is in Surah Al-Ahzab where it concerns fleeing from battle. It states: \\"A group of them ask the Prophet for leave, saying, \\"Our houses are 'awrah\\", even though their houses are not awrah. Their intent is to flee the battle. \\"Surah Al-Ahzab 33:13 In this case, the term 'awrah means \\"vulnerable\\".Tafsir An-Nur Volume 2 Page 45 There is another context that relates the story of creation of Adam and Eve in the Garden. In these two instances, the term saw‚Äôah is used as an equivalent to 'awrah. The text states: > \\"O ye children of Adam! We have bestowed dress upon you to cover your > nakedness...\\".Quran Sura- Al-A'raf 7:26 Another word which almost has the same meaning of 'awrah, is the word farj () the plural is furuj ().Sura Al-Anbia 91, Sura Al-Muminun 3 Another quote concerning covering the 'awrah is: > \\"O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters, and the believing women, to > draw their cloaks (veils) over their bodies. That will be better that they > should be known (as respectable woman) so as not to be annoyed. And Allah is > Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\\" -Al-Ahzab:59 (Qur'an) The Quran admonishes Muslim women to dress modestly and cover their private areas. The Quran explicitly states that \\"O wives of the Prophet, you are not like anyone among women\\" (Quran 33: 32) and as such has separate rules specifically for the wives of the Prophet. The Qur'an tells the male believers (Muslims) to talk to the wives of the Prophet Muhammad from behind a hijab (curtain or veil). This passage was as follows: The khimƒÅr is a waist-length veil with a cutout for the face. It therefore conceals the entire shape of the upper body. Women before this time were not wearing low-cut clothes but rather clothes in which the shape of the breasts could be distinguished. Part of a woman's beauty was considered to be her face, which is why the women understood the passage to mean that Allah was ordering them to cover their faces. In the following verse, the wives of the Prophet and believing women are asked to draw their jilbab (outer garments) over them (when they go out), as a measure to distinguish themselves from others (as Muslim women), so that they are not harassed. Surah 33:59 reads:Hameed, Shahul. \\"Is Hijab a Qur‚Äôanic Commandment?,\\" IslamOnline.net. October 9, 2003. In the Hadith Shaykh Tabarsi in Majma' Al-Bayan has commented on this Hadith: > Awrah refers to anything which can be easily harmed just like a bare or > exposed place. Therefore it becomes clear that the body of a woman is > referred to as vulnerable because it is like a house which contains no walls > and can be easily harmed and must be covered with the appropriate > clothing.Majma' Al Bian, Commentary upon the Quran, 33:14.#2312 Some people, especially in modern times, argue that these are not rules for all Muslim women because of the ayah of Quran 33:32. However, the ahadith clearly attest that these were considered universal directions at the time and that most of the face was considered to be part of the body that was to be covered: > \\"After Muhammad issued the command (Quran 24:31) for women to cover > themselves, the women responded by tearing up sheets [or outer garments] to > cover their faces.\\" Sahih Bukhari (60:282)https://www.sahih-bukhari.com/ (This hadith deals with an interpretation of the Quran and not the Quran itself) What did the jilbƒÅb usually cover? This is also answered in a hadith: > It was narrated from ‚ÄòAa‚Äôishah that Safwaan ibn al-Mu‚Äôattal al-Sulami al > Dhakwaani was lagging behind the army. She said, ‚ÄúHe came to where I had > stopped and saw the black shape of a person sleeping. He recognized me when > he saw me, because he had seen me before HijƒÅb was enjoined. I woke up when > I heard him saying ‚ÄòInna Lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji‚Äôoon (verily to Allaah > we belong and unto Him is our return),‚Äô and I covered my face with my > JilbƒÅb.‚Äù (Narrated by al-BukhƒÅri, kitƒÅb al maghazi ‚Äì bƒÅbu Hadƒ´th ul ifk, > 4141; Muslim, 2770https://sunnah.com/muslim) The details are important, showing that Aisha was recognizable only because Safwaan knew her before the sura of the veil. If only Muhammad's wives had covered their faces, he would have known her regardless because she would have been the only woman on that journey whose face he didn't instantly recognize, as she was the only one of his wives on that trip. Therefore, when a woman left her house, she was enjoined to cover her entire body and also most of her face. Note that though the man would not have ordinarily seen a woman's face, it was not an act of indecency that Aisha's face was seen. She was not held to blame for this later. Within the home, a head-veil alone seemed to be sufficient for a woman to be considered dressed. The most frequently cited passage was this: > \\"Asma, daughter of Abu Bakr, entered upon the Apostle of Allah > (peace_be_upon_him) wearing thin clothes. The Apostle of Allah > (peace_be_upon_him) turned his attention from her. He said: O Asma‚Äô, when a > woman reaches the age of menstruation, it does not suit her that she > displays her parts of body except this and this, and he pointed to her face > and hands.\\" Abu Dawudhttp://veil.unc.edu/religions/islam/hadith/ Asma was not mahram to Muhammad, and the fact that he did not order that her face be covered indicates face veiling was not obligatory indoors, at least, and therefore uncovering the face was not obscene even in other contexts. There are other ahadith that state that Muhammad said that the 'awrah of women included everything except the face and the hands, and possibly the feet as long as they were still in shoes. Not only was it traditionally required that everything that is 'awrah be covered, but it was also required that the 'awrah be covered in such a way that the shape beneath cannot be discerned. These requirements are usually enforced today more often concerning women's 'awrah than men's. Differences between men and women=Men Pilgrims head to the 'mountain of mercy'. In Sunni interpretations, the 'awrah of a man refers to the part of the body from the navel to the knees. The Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanafi and Hanbali schools of thought observe that the navel is included. In particular, these observations generally require that the cloth not be too thin, that it is not pale to the extent the color of the skin can be seen, that a man ensures extra covering if his genitals' shape is discernible, and that the modesty of adulthood applies once a boy becomes ten years old.Lee, Nazirah, and Zanariah Noor. \\"Islam or progress of the nation?: An assessment of the aurat issue in Malay newspapers and magazines in the 1930s.\\" Geografia- Malaysian Journal of Society and Space 12.6 (2017). Women A Yemeni woman covering her face with niqab. Some women who wear the niqab believe that a woman's face is also part of her 'awrah. A Turkish woman wearing a headscarf. Most Muslims hold that the face and the hands are excluded from 'awrah parts. Women's 'awrah is a more complicated issue and it changes according to the situation. *In ritual prayer: a woman should cover her entire body excluding her entire face and her hands to the wrist. (The Hanafis solely differ on this matter, as they consider that feet, including the ankles, also can be excluded). The part between the throat and the chin can be excluded as well. (Different scholars have different opinions on this.) A woman should cover her hair and body while performing the ritual prayer, whether she is praying in presence of her husband or she is praying alone in her chamber, as the basis for covering in prayer is different from the basis for covering in front of people. *In front of her husband: There is no restriction in Islam on what body parts a woman may show to her husband in private. The husband and wife can see any part of each other‚Äôs body especially during sexual intercourse. *In privacy: It is recommended that a person cover his or her sexual organs even when alone in private. There are exceptions when there is need, such as when bathing or using the toilet. *Among other women: The 'awrah of a woman amongst other women is the same as the 'awrah of men (from her navel to her knees). 'Awrah in front of non-Muslim women is a point of debate. Some scholars say that women should cover all but the hands and face, while according to the most preferred opinion, a Muslim woman can reveal in front of a non-Muslim woman as much as she would in front of other Muslim women.Fiqhus Sunnah * In front of a mahram (close male relative): there are three Sunni opinions: #It is from the shoulders and neck down to below the knees (inclusive) (Maliki and Hanbali opinion) (Alternate Hanafi opinion) * In front of male children: If the child understands what the 'awrah is, then it is not considered permissible for a woman to uncover her 'awrah in front of him. * In front of non-mahram men: There is a difference of opinion on which body parts a woman should cover in front of men who are not her mahram. In the contemporary world, there is a general argument that the body of a free woman (except for her face and her hands up to her wrists/forearms) is 'awrah and therefore must be covered not only during prayer but also in public and in front of all non-mahram men. The Hanafis view the feet (including the ankles) to be excluded from 'awrah as well.The Hanbali school of thought also views the face as the awrah, though this view is rejected by Hanafis, Malikis and Shafi'is.Hsu, Shiu-Sian. \\"Modesty.\\" Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an. Ed. Jane McAuliffe. Vol. 3. Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill Academic Publishers, 2003. 403-405. 6 vols. However, these views above are only the dominant view and does not represent the whole of Islam, as there are alternative views, such as the view that covering every part of a woman's body except for the face and the hands only apply during salah and ihram and the view that a woman must cover every part of her body at any time except in front of her husband. {{ Whether a woman was obligated to cover her face is more controversial. Most contemporary scholars agree that women's covering of the face was not mandated by the Quran or by the traditions of Muhammad. However, many classical jurists held that such covering was nonetheless strongly recommended, or even required in times of fitnah. Al-Razi, for example, held that by covering her face a married woman made clear that she was not available. Notably, a man is permitted and even encouraged to look at the face of a woman he is considering marrying, even in countries where he normally would not be allowed to. In the contemporary world, some Muslims insist that a woman's awrah in front of unrelated men is her entire body including her face and hands, which must be covered at all times in front of non-mahram men.Marfuqi, Kitab ul Mar'ah fil Ahkam, pg 133 The practice of covering the face is common in several Muslim countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Yemen, Oman. It is not common in other majority Muslim countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, present-day Iran, present-day Turkey, and the majority of South Asia. These differences reflect different interpretations and understanding of Sharia regarding wearing a niqab. There is a difference of opinion among scholars with regards to how much should be uncovered for a woman in front of other women and a man in front of another man. In one hadith, the prophet said in a hadith narrated by Abu said al khudri, \\"A man should not look at the private parts of another man, and a woman should not look at the private parts of another woman. A man should not lie with another man without wearing lower garment under one cover; and a woman should not be lie with another woman without wearing lower garment under one cover.\\" (Abu Dawud -- authenticated by Sheikh Naseeruddeen-al- Albani.)https://cjislam.weebly.com/awrah-for-men-among-men-and-women-among- women-4-answers.html Relation with hijab Afghan women wearing burqas, the most concealing of all Islamic garments, with mesh shielding the eyes. Some Muslim women, particularly those living in Europe or in Southeast Asia, wear the hijab headscarf. The type most commonly worn in the West is a rectangular scarf that covers the head and neck but leaves the face visible. Other styles also cover the hair, neck and shoulders completely, but the face and the hands are not covered, as they are not considered awrah for those Muslims who wear it. Female voice According to most scholars, the woman's voice is not (see quotation) awrah in principle, for according to the Hadith, women used to complain to the Prophet and ask him about Islamic matters. However, women are not allowed to speak in a soft or alluring voice. Also, according to the tradition, in the ritual prayer, a woman should invite the attention of the Imam by clapping, instead of saying \\"Subhanallah\\" which is for men. There is a difference of opinion whether or not a woman can recite the Quran when in the presence of non-mahram men. Certain scholars have concluded from the above differences that a woman's voice is also her awrah in some cases.According to this strictest opinion, the entirety of the woman is awrah. As Faqeeh Qadhi Ibn Al-Arabi said: \\"And all of the woman is awrah; her body, her voice, and it is not permissible for her to uncover that unless out of necessity, or need such as witnessing (in court), or a disease that is affecting her body‚Ä¶\\" [Ahkaam Al Qur'aan 3/1579]  Debates, deliberations and activism  Specially since modern times the concepts of awarah (Intimate parts), Haya (Modesty), various levels of seclusion of Muslim women, and about extent to which Muslim restrain their exposure of bodily aspects and association vis a vis Islamic clothing; not only were contested from non-Muslim and Ex-Muslim but also continuously been matter of discussions, deliberations, debates, movements and also been part of advice literature, within Muslim societies including that of common Muslim individuals, various traditional schools scholars , intelligentsia, numerous political dispensations and also at times contested by individuals and groups of cultural Muslims; liberals and progressives, modernists and Islamic feminists. (Also needs additional citations) In the 1930s just after Turkish reformations under Kemal Atat√ºrk, Malays (Malaysians) debated how far to stick to traditional Islamic social restraints over awrah - commonly referred as 'Aurat' is Malaysia and Indonesia\\\\- and modesty in contemporary Islamic clothing and whether western modernism is really essential and beneficial.

It has been used several times to find lost sea vessels, for example the USS Scorpion, and has played a key role in the recovery of the flight recorders in the Air France Flight 447 disaster of 2009. It has also been used in the attempts to locate the remains of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Procedure The usual procedure is as follows: # Formulate as many reasonable hypotheses as possible about what may have happened to the object. # For each hypothesis, construct a probability density function for the location of the object. # Construct a function giving the probability of actually finding an object in location X when searching there if it really is in location X. In an ocean search, this is usually a function of water depth ‚Äî in shallow water chances of finding an object are good if the search is in the right place. In deep water chances are reduced. # Combine the above information coherently to produce an overall probability density map. (Usually this simply means multiplying the two functions together.) This gives the probability of finding the object by looking in location X, for all possible locations X. (This can be visualized as a contour map of probability.) # Construct a search path which starts at the point of highest probability and 'scans' over high probability areas, then intermediate probabilities, and finally low probability areas. # Revise all the probabilities continuously during the search. For example, if the hypotheses for location X imply the likely disintegration of the object and the search at location X has yielded no fragments, then the probability that the object is somewhere around there is greatly reduced (though not usually to zero) while the probabilities of its being at other locations is correspondingly increased. The revision process is done by applying Bayes' theorem. In other words, first search where it most probably will be found, then search where finding it is less probable, then search where the probability is even less (but still possible due to limitations on fuel, range, water currents, etc.), until insufficient hope of locating the object at acceptable cost remains. The advantages of the Bayesian method are that all information available is used coherently (i.e., in a \\"leak-proof\\" manner) and the method automatically produces estimates of the cost for a given success probability. That is, even before the start of searching, one can say, hypothetically, \\"there is a 65% chance of finding it in a 5-day search. That probability will rise to 90% after a 10-day search and 97% after 15 days\\" or a similar statement. Thus the economic viability of the search can be estimated before committing resources to a search. Apart from the USS Scorpion, other vessels located by Bayesian search theory include the MV Derbyshire, the largest British vessel ever lost at sea, and the SS Central America. It also proved successful in the search for a lost hydrogen bomb following the 1966 Palomares B-52 crash in Spain, and the recovery in the Atlantic Ocean of the crashed Air France Flight 447. Bayesian search theory is incorporated into the CASP (Computer Assisted Search Program) mission planning software used by the United States Coast Guard for search and rescue. This program was later adapted for inland search by adding terrain and ground cover factors for use by the United States Air Force and Civil Air Patrol. Mathematics Suppose a grid square has a probability p of containing the wreck and that the probability of successfully detecting the wreck if it is there is q. If the square is searched and no wreck is found, then, by Bayes' theorem, the revised probability of the wreck being in the square is given by : p' = \\\\frac{p(1-q)}{(1-p)+p(1-q)} = p \\\\frac{1-q}{1-pq} < p. For every other grid square, if its prior probability is r, its posterior probability is given by : r' = r \\\\frac{1}{1- pq} > r. USS Scorpion In May 1968, the U.S. Navy's nuclear submarine USS Scorpion (SSN-589) failed to arrive as expected at her home port of Norfolk, Virginia. The command officers of the U.S. Navy were nearly certain that the vessel had been lost off the Eastern Seaboard, but an extensive search there failed to discover the remains of Scorpion. Then, a Navy deep-water expert, John P. Craven, suggested that Scorpion had sunk elsewhere. Craven organised a search southwest of the Azores based on a controversial approximate triangulation by hydrophones. He was allocated only a single ship, Mizar, and he took advice from a firm of consultant mathematicians in order to maximise his resources. A Bayesian search methodology was adopted. Experienced submarine commanders were interviewed to construct hypotheses about what could have caused the loss of Scorpion. The sea area was divided up into grid squares and a probability assigned to each square, under each of the hypotheses, to give a number of probability grids, one for each hypothesis. These were then added together to produce an overall probability grid. The probability attached to each square was then the probability that the wreck was in that square. A second grid was constructed with probabilities that represented the probability of successfully finding the wreck if that square were to be searched and the wreck were to be actually there. This was a known function of water depth. The result of combining this grid with the previous grid is a grid which gives the probability of finding the wreck in each grid square of the sea if it were to be searched. At the end of October 1968, the Navy's oceanographic research ship, , located sections of the hull of Scorpion on the seabed, about southwest of the Azores,\\"Strange Devices That Found the Sunken Sub Scorpion.\\" Popular Science, April 1969, pp. 66‚Äì71. under more than of water. This was after the Navy had released sound tapes from its underwater \\"SOSUS\\" listening system, which contained the sounds of the destruction of Scorpion. The court of inquiry was subsequently reconvened and other vessels, including the bathyscaphe Trieste II, were dispatched to the scene, collecting many pictures and other data. Although Craven received much credit for locating the wreckage of Scorpion, Gordon Hamilton, an acoustics expert who pioneered the use of hydroacoustics to pinpoint Polaris missile splashdown locations, was instrumental in defining a compact \\"search box\\" wherein the wreck was ultimately found. Hamilton had established a listening station in the Canary Islands that obtained a clear signal of what some scientists believe was the noise of the vessel's pressure hull imploding as she passed crush depth. A Naval Research Laboratory scientist named Chester \\"Buck\\" Buchanan, using a towed camera sled of his own design aboard Mizar, finally located Scorpion. The towed camera sled, which was fabricated by J. L. \\"Jac\\" Hamm of Naval Research Laboratory's Engineering Services Division, is housed in the National Museum of the United States Navy. Buchanan had located the wrecked hull of Thresher in 1964 using this technique. Optimal distribution of search effort The classical book on this subject The Theory of Optimal Search (Operations Research Society of America, 1975) by Lawrence D. Stone won the 1975 Lanchester Prize by the American Operations Research Society. Searching in boxes Assume that a stationary object is hidden in one of n boxes (locations). For each location i there are three known parameters: the cost c_i of a single search, the probability a_i of finding the object by a single search if the object is there, and the probability p_i that the object is there. A searcher looks for the object. They know the a priori probabilities at the beginning and update them by Bayes‚Äô law after each (unsuccessful) attempt. The problem of finding the object in minimal expected cost is a classical problem solved by David Blackwell. Surprisingly, the optimal policy is easy to describe: at each stage look into the location which maximizes \\\\frac{p_i a_i}{c_i}. This is actually a special case of Gittins index.

Duleek takes its name from the Irish word daimh liag, meaning house of stones and referring to an early stone-built church, St Cian√°n‚Äôs Church, the ruins of which are still visible in Duleek today. History Athcarne Castle, Co. Meath, 1820 Duleek began as an early Christian monastic settlement. St Patrick established a bishopric here about 450 AD, which he placed in the care of St Cian√°n on 24 November 489. The place was sacked several times by the Norsemen between 830 and 1149 and was also pillaged by the Normans in 1171. In April 1014 the bodies of Brian Bor√∫ and his son lay in state in Duleek on their way to Armagh. The original monastery settlement is reputed to be the place where St. Patrick and several contemporaries spent the winter period while compiling the Seanchas M√≥r - the first written compiled form of the ancient Brehon Laws of Ireland in the fifth century. The 12th century saw the reconstitution of the original monastery as St Mary's Abbey and the subsumption of the Diocese of Duleek by the Diocese of Meath. The first Anglo-Norman Lord of Meath, Hugh de Lacy, established a manor and constructed a motte castle at Duleek. About 1180 he granted St Cian√°n's Church, together with certain lands, to the Augustinians. The churchyard of the now disused Church of Ireland church occupies part of the site of the early monastery. On the opposite side of the village in the town land of Abbeyland close to the river Nanny and Duleek house there are ruins of the Grange of St.Michael. This grange was established in about 1172 by Augustinian monks from Llanthony in Monmouthshire; the lands were granted to them by the De Lacy family. The village‚Äôs four crosses and the lime tree on the village green are reminders of Duleek‚Äôs links to the struggle between William and James and to wider European unrest at the time of Louis XIV of France. One of the crosses, the Wayward Cross, was however erected in 1601 by Janet Dowdall in memory of her husband, Sir William Bathe of Athcarne Castle outside the village.Duleek Heritage Trail, Meath Tourism - Ireland, Accommodation, Holidays, Vacations, Golf, Fishing, Castles, Maps During World War II, or The Emergency, German bombers accidentally struck the village on 1 January 1941; minor damage was caused and there were no casualties.

It first flew in 1975 and remained in production until 1988 when the parent company, de Havilland Canada, was purchased by Boeing and was later sold to Bombardier. Bombardier sold the type certificate for the aircraft design to Victoria-based manufacturer Viking Air in 2006. Design and development In the 1960s, de Havilland Canada was already well known worldwide for their series of high-performance STOL aircraft, notably the very popular DHC-2 Beaver and DHC-6 Twin Otter. However, these aircraft were generally fairly small and served outlying routes, as opposed to the busier regional airliner routes which were already well served by larger, higher- performance turboprop aircraft such as the Fokker F27, Fairchild F-27, Convair 580, Convair 600, and Hawker Siddeley 748. The de Havilland Canada company personnel felt they could compete with these designs in a roundabout way. With their excellent STOL performance, their designs could fly into smaller airports located in city centres and smaller, outlying, more austere airports having runways that the other aircraft could not easily use (unpaved, unimproved). The original specification called for a 40-passenger aircraft with a fairly short range of 200 statute miles, operating from runways only . With new noise restrictions coming into effect throughout the 1970s, an aircraft tailored for this role would also have to be very quiet. Propeller thrust is a factor of blade length and chord and the speed at which it rotates. To meet these new regulations, the new design used much larger (oversized) propellers geared to rotate at a slower speed than is normally designed. Much of the problem sound from a typical propeller is generated at the tips of the blades which are rotating just beneath the speed of sound. By using overlarge propeller blades, no need exists to have the blade tip reach near the speed of sound, and the speed can therefore be reduced without sacrificing thrust. In reducing the speed, this noise is reduced substantially. The Dash 7 often landed at only 900 rpm, and took off at only 1,210 rpm. The propellers on the Dash-7 are constant-speed propellers which change the blade angle to push more or less air as needed. This can be used to change power while maintaining a constant (and lower) speed. Dash 7 flight deck In other respects, the new DHC-7 was essentially a larger, four-engine version of the Twin Otter: the general layout remained similar, with a high aspect ratio, high-mounted wing, and similar details of the cockpit and nose profile. Changes included the addition of cabin pressurization (requiring a switch to a fuselage with a circular cross-section), landing gear that folded forward into the inner engine nacelles, and a large T-tail intended to keep the elevator clear of the propwash during take-off (the Twin Otter's empennage was a cruciform arrangement). The Twin Otter incorporated \\"flaperons\\" that drooped the ailerons as part of the flaps, but these were not included in the Dash 7 due to weight and complexity. Instead, the ailerons were reduced in size to allow more flap area, and were augmented with two sets of roll spoilers, or \\"spoilerons\\". The inboard roll spoilers operate at all speeds. while the outboard roll spoilers only operate at speeds less than 130 KIAS to allow for more roll control at slower speeds. Upon touchdown, both the inboard and outboard roll spoilers extend in unison to aid in destroying lift created by the wing. Each wing also includes two ground spoilers which only extend on touchdown. Most of the trailing edge is spanned by a complex, double Fowler flap arrangement for high lift at low speed. During a typical STOL landing, flaps are selected to the 45¬∞ position, generating more lift and drag, thus allowing for steeper descents and slower approach speeds. Depending on weight, the VREF speed with flaps at 45¬∞ is between 70 and 85 knots. On touchdown, through \\"squat switches\\" in the main gear, the flaps automatically retract to the 25¬∞ position, thus reducing lift once on the runway and producing better braking performance. The flaps also retract to 25¬∞ when engine power is increased during a go-around procedure. The four-engine layout aids lift at low speeds due to the wide span of the propellers blowing air over the wing (\\"propwash\\"). When reverse thrust is selected on landing, the props reverse pitch, push air forward, and slow the aircraft very effectively along with the antiskid wheel brakes. More importantly, if an engine fails, the asymmetric thrust is much less than on a twin-engine layout, thereby increasing safety and allowing for a lower minimum control speed with an engine inoperative . Operational history Prototype DHC-7-100 at the 1978 Farnborough Air Show. DHC-7 of London City Airways making its steep approach to London City Airport as another loads before departure to Amsterdam in 1988 Mojave Airport in 2001 Development started in 1972 and the prototype first flew on March 27, 1975. Testing went smoothly, and the first delivery took place to Rocky Mountain Airways on February 3, 1978. The Dash 7 enabled Rocky Mountain Airways to operate scheduled passenger air service from Denver into the Avon STOLport in Colorado which was controlled by the airline. The Avon STOLport was located in a mountain valley in close proximity to the Vail ski resort. Another close-in ski resort airfield served by Rocky Mountain Airways with Dash 7 flights from Denver was Steamboat Springs Airport in Colorado. With a relatively short runway length of 4,452 feet and an airfield elevation of 6,882 feet, the Dash 7 was well suited for operations from this airport located in the Rocky Mountains. Flying as Continental Express via a code sharing agreement with Continental Airlines, Rocky Mountain Airways also operated the Dash 7 into the Telluride Airport located in the San Juan Mountains of southwest Colorado with this mountain airport having an airfield elevation of 9,078 feet thus making it one of the highest airports in the U.S.http://www.departedflights.com, Feb. 1, 1987 Continental Airlines system timetable The Kapalua Airport on the island of Maui in Hawaii was constructed specifically with Dash 7 operations in mind. According to state of Hawaii historical records, Hawaiian Airlines built this airfield and then initiated scheduled passenger flights with new Dash 7 turboprops on March 1, 1987. The airline owned this private airport, which is also known as Kapalua-West Maui Airport, until 1993, when it was acquired by the state of Hawaii. The 3000-foot runway length at Kapalua was well suited for Dash 7 operations. The three-letter code for the Kapalua Airport, JHM, stands for John Henry Magoon, who was president of Hawaiian Airlines when the airfield and terminal were constructed by the air carrier. Kapalua is currently served by Mokulele Airlines with Cessna 208 Grand Caravans. One hundred Dash 7 turboprops were delivered by 1984, when the production line was put on hold in favour of the Dash 8. Another 13 were delivered between 1984 and 1988, when the production lines were removed when Boeing bought the company. The last Dash 7 was bought by Tyrolean Airways. The original Series 100 represents the vast majority of the aircraft delivered, and came in two models; the DHC-7-102 passenger version and -103 combi with an enlarged cargo door. These were followed by the Series 110 which met British CAA requirements, including the -110 and -111, and finally the Series 150 which included additional fuel capacity and an improved interior in the -150 and -151. Plans were made for a Series 200 with the new PT6A-50/7 engines which improved hot-and-high power, but these plans were shelved when Boeing ended production of the design. The mixture of features on the Dash 7 met with limited commercial success. Most commuter airline turboprop operators used the aircraft as feeder liners into large airports, where the STOL performance was not considered important. In comparison to other feeder liners, the Dash 7's four engines required twice the maintenance of a twin-engine model, thereby driving up operational costs. Finally, those airports that did require a high-performance STOL operation were generally small and well served by the Twin Otters; had an airport needed a larger plane to serve its customer base, they would have built a longer runway. One exception to this was operations at London City Airport (LCY), which upon opening in 1987, was capable of handling few other aircraft types besides the Dash 7 due to its relatively short runway and steep approach. The runway at LCY was subsequently lengthened, and the approach angle reduced somewhat and since accepts airliners such as the Airbus A220, Airbus A318, British Aerospace BAe 146 and Embraer 190 types. Noise criteria remain strict in comparison with other international airports. The Dash 7 also gained a number of military orders. The first of these was for two aircraft for the Canadian Armed Forces, which needed them to transport high-ranking passengers and freight around Europe. These aircraft received the CF designation CC-132 and were delivered to 412 Transport Squadron at Canadian Forces Base Lahr, in West Germany.\\"de Havilland CC-132 Dash 7.\\" Canada's Air Force, April 6, 2004.

It is‚Äîaccording to a 2007 Chicago Tribune article‚Äî\\"the longest-running collegiate film society in the country\\" and may be the oldest film society of any kind in the United States. Formed in 1932 as a group of students who gathered to screen documentary films, it officially adopted the name International House Documentary Film Group in 1940. It has since expanded both the genres it screens and the activities it sponsors. History Doc Films began in 1932 as the Documentary Film Group, as the students involved collected money to foot the bill for screening documentaries.Educational Film Library Association, American Film Center. \\"The group first pooled funds informally to screen documentaries.\\" In 1940, it officially became the International House Documentary Film Group\\", and by 1950, when an auditorium was in use for screening films, was already being hailed as \\"probably the oldest U.S. film society\\" by Film News. Activities As the student organizers realized that they could not sustain the organization on documentaries alone, they expanded to incorporate fictional and experimental films. While the University's classes are in session, Doc Films hosts nightly screenings of films selected from one of these categories at Max Palevsky Cinema, located in Ida Noyes Hall. Doc's screening selection is eclectic. Each quarter of the academic year, students and members of the public propose series of ten films that are somehow related to each other (filmmaker, actor, language, genre, era, theme, etc.). The Programming Committee, which consists of any interested students or members of the public, then chooses among these proposals to schedule a different series for each weeknight (Sunday through Friday). Recent films, normally delayed one quarter from their nationwide release date, are shown on weekends. Occasionally, Doc screens films which have not yet been released to the general public in the area, including The Rules of the Game and Brokeback Mountain. The goings on of the theater are also completely run by volunteers, being students or interested members of the community. These volunteers sell and collect tickets, present films, and project film. Other events include showings of student films and conversations with faculty and professionals connected to the film industry. It has hosted a number of film directors, including Alfred Hitchcock, Woody Allen and John Ford.

Early life and career F√ºrstenberg vase commemorating Dalberg's election in 1787 as Coadjutor of Mainz and Worms (Collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art) Born in Herrnsheim near Worms, Germany, he was the son of Franz Heinrich von Dalberg, administrator of Worms, one of the chief counsellors of the Prince-elector and Archbishop of Mainz. Karl devoted himself to the study of canon law, and entered the church. Having been appointed in 1772 governor of Erfurt, he won further advancement by his successful administration. In 1787 he was elected coadjutor cum iure successionis of the Archbishopric of Mainz and the Bishopric of Worms, and in 1788 of the Bishopric of Constance;\\"Karl von Dalberg, Archbishop of Mainz and Prince Primate\\", The British Museum at the same time, he became titular archbishop of Tarsus in Cilicia and was ordained priest (11/11/1787) and bishop (8/31/1788). While he did succeed the respective bishops in Constance (1800) and Worms (1802), he failed to succeed in Mainz as bishop, though he did succeed in Mainz's temporal rights and also, de facto, in the pastoral ones as far as the right bank of the Rhine was concerned. As statesman, Dalberg was distinguished by his patriotic attitude, whether in ecclesiastical matters, in which he leaned to the Febronian view of a German national church, or in his efforts to galvanize the atrophied machinery of the Empire into some sort of effective central government of Germany. Failing in this, he turned to the rising star of Napoleon, believing that he had found in him the only force strong enough to save Germany from dissolution. By the Treaty of Lun√©ville in 1801, in which all territories on the left bank of the river Rhine were ceded to France, Dalberg's predecessor had to surrender Mainz and Worms; the Concordat of 1801 had reduced Mainz to a simple diocese in the province of Mechelen that conscribed the French department of Donnersberg (including the city of Worms). For Mainz, Joseph Ludwig Colmar was soon appointed as bishop. (Worms, though it had lost its city, remained an extant diocese on the right bank of the Rhine, so Dalberg could succeed there.) In the Final Recess of the Extraordinary Imperial Deputation of 1803, it was decided to compensate German princes for their losses to France by distributing the Church land among them, so Dalberg lost a couple of territories there (among other things, Constance), though (due to the prominent position of the Arch-Chancellor of the Empire, and perhaps also due to his personality and skilled diplomatics), he would be the only spiritual prince to retain at least some territory for temporal government: the Mainzian lands around Aschaffenburg, the ' (Free Imperial City) of Wetzlar (with the rank of a Countship) and the Principality of Regensburg containing the Imperial City, the bishopric, and some independent monasteries. (Regensburg was also where the Imperial Deputation had taken place.) In addition, he was designated Archbishop of the (former Salzburg suffragan) Regensburg, to which (spiritually now) the former Mainz lands on the right bank of the Rhine, and the former Mainzian suffragans were attached. This was, of course, the decision of a state authority which, in its spiritual part, could not take effect until ratified by the Pope; in any case, Regensburg's bishop, Schroffenberg, was still alive at the time. So, Dalberg did not exercise spiritual authority in the older part of the Regensburg diocese until Bishop Schroffenberg died, at which point he made himself elected vicar capitular of the diocese; finally, on February 1st, 1805, he received the papal assent and was Archbishop of Regensburg. Prince-primate of the Confederation of the Rhine After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Dalberg together with other princes joined the Confederation of the Rhine. He formally resigned the office of Arch-Chancellor in a letter to Emperor Francis II, and was appointed prince-primate of the Confederation of the Rhine by Napoleon. At that point, the ' of Frankfurt was included among his territories. Not long after, Dalberg appointed Napoleon's uncle, Cardinal Fesch, coadjutor in his archdiocese (a move for which he had no canonical rights). After the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn (1810), he was elevated by the French to the rank of Grand Duke of Frankfurt. This greatly augmented Dalberg's territories, although he had to cede Regensburg to the Kingdom of Bavaria. As Grand Duke of Frankfurt he ordered all restrictions on the Jews of Frankfurt lifted. This was opposed by the Christian town council, until 1811, when Dalberg issued a proclamation ending the requirement that Jews live in the ghetto or pay special taxes. In 1813 he ceded all his temporal offices to Napoleon's stepson Eug√®ne de Beauharnais, who had been heir apparent since 1810. Death and legacy Dalberg died in 1817 in Regensburg. Though his political subservience to Napoleon was resented by a later generation in Germany, as a man and prelate he is remembered as amiable, conscientious and large-hearted. Himself a scholar and author, Dalberg was a notable patron of letters, and was the friend of Goethe, Schiller and Wieland.

History The first Studer-designed tape recorders were branded Dynavox. After the first production series of Dynavox recorders, a new marketing company was formed in 1950 called ELA AG. Revox was adopted as the brand name for amateur recorders, while the professional machines retained the Studer name. The first Revox- branded tape recorder was the T26, in 1952, successor to the Dynavox 100. The T26 was also made available as a radio-recorder combination unit. 2500 T26 recorders were made, priced at 1395.00 Swiss francs. The A36, the first 36 series recorder. became available in 1954. Unusual features for the time were pushbutton solenoid transport operations and a direct-drive capstan with no belts or idler wheels. The B36 of 1956 was the first 3-head model, the D36 of 1960 was the first stereo model. Revox A77 (1967‚Äì1977) Revox B760 Synthesizer Tuner Revox PR99 Mk II, a 1/4 inch tape recorder. Produced from about 1985. The company moved to L√∂ffingen, West Germany, in 1966, due to labour issues in Switzerland. But the building of a second factory was started in Regensdorf, Switzerland in 1967 - to open in 1968. Linear tracking record player (1977‚Äì1982) In 1967 the 36-series tape recorders ended with the G36, and were superseded by the transistorised A77 with a servo-controlled direct drive capstan. Over 80,000 36-series recorders had been manufactured. The A77, of which more than 460,000 were built,tonbandmuseum 2003/2020, Die Revox A77 (German, with pictures of components), retrieved 2020-04-26. was complemented by an integrated amplifier (A78) and FM tuner (A76). The start of the 1980s saw the introduction of the \\"B7xx\\" series of high fidelity components, which was in turn replaced by the B2xx series in the mid 1980s. The B2xx series was versatile (the B250 amplifier offering 10 signal inputs, each with automatic sensitivity calibration) and feature-rich, all components containing microprocessors. Contrastingly, the \\"H\\" line, with \\"H\\" standing for Human, went to the opposite extreme, with minimalist control interfaces: several \\"H\\" components having only three buttons. Revox H7, Digital-Tuner of H-series In 1990 Willi Studer sold the Studer Revox Group to Motor-Columbus AG, including all subsidiary companies. In 1991, Motor-Columbus split the Studer Revox Group into Studer (Pro), Revox (HiFi) and a Manufacturing-division. Motor-Columbus sold several subsidiaries and plants. The extensive reorganization culminated in the sale of the Studer Group to Harman International Inc., in March 1994. The Revox Group was excluded and sold to private investors. On March 17, 1994, Harman International Industries completed its acquisition and acquired from Motor-Columbus AG 100% of Studer Revox AG. Harman paid 100 Swiss Francs (approximately US $70.00) for all of the issued and outstanding stock in Studer Revox. Harman assumed post-acquisition indebtedness of Studer Revox of approximately 23 million Swiss Francs (approximately US $16 million). Revox B 215, 4-motors-Cassettedeck without belts (1985-1992) The founder of Revox, Willi Studer, died on March 1, 1996. The company logo is the word \\"REVOX\\" in capitals, with a \\"V\\" larger than the other letters; when printed in fixed-size type, the mixed-case spelling \\"ReVox\\" is sometimes used, but in all older and most newer references the name is shown as \\"Revox\\". Many consider ReVox open- reel tape recorders to be high-end audio equipment. The most famous of these are the G36 (valve type), A77 (solid state with relay controls) and B77 (solid state with logic control and direct-drive). The A700 was the top of the line 1970s machine with 3-speed quartz PLL capstan, or, like the B77 which appeared in 1979, variable tape speed from 2.5 to 22.5 inches per second. Pictured to the right is the PR99 Mk2, a variant of the B77 for professional users, differing from the B77 in having balanced line in/out, and a real-time counter and auto-locator. The PR99 series was superseded by the C270 series, available also in multi-track formats (C274, C278). Cassette recorders, CD players, Televisions Revox also produced well-regarded cassette tape recorders, notably the B710 and later the B215, which used the same transport and substantially the same electronics as the more expensive Studer A710 and Studer A721, respectively. It is worth noting that the Revox H11 and C115 cassette recorders are not true Revox or Studer products, but rebadged Philips Model FC60. As such, they do not meet the exacting performance standards of the B710, B215 and H1 which are Studer designed and built. In the same fashion, the Revox B225 and B226 compact disc players were very heavily based on the Studer A725 and A727 professional CD players. Likewise, the Revox FM tuners were almost identical to the Studer professional models. A limited run of the B226 CD player was issued to celebrate Studer's 40th anniversary. Dubbed 'The Signature', it featured a black faceplate (in contrast to the then silver (anodized aluminium) B226) and used the high performance Silver Crown version of the Philips TDA1541 DAC, which later featured in non-Signature B226-S versions. Revox was one of the first manufacturers to market a plasma television set, the model E542 in 1999. Before that, they commissioned Loewe to manufacture a limited number of models of S-VHS and VHS video cassette recorders and CRT television sets branded with the Revox name. A DVD player bearing the Revox name (model S27) was built by the French company Micromega.  Current technology  modular multiroom system M51 In 2002, Revox introduced with the Re:system M51 a modular audio video system in the market. This system can provide up to 32 rooms in 4 different listening zones with music. Different modules allow the user to select which sources he would like to use in his home, available sources (modules) for the M51 and M10 are amongst others FM-tuner, SAT-radio, Internet-radio, Multiroom, Audio server and also Audio streams. Solutions are available for all imaginable application possibilities up to the control via Apple products with the corresponding Apps. The operation of Multiroom require the availability of the corresponding Multiroom module and small amplifiers of the type M219 in the remote rooms. Also the first audio server of the company, the Revox M57, was perfectly in line with the Multiroom concept. The M51 MKII is available with two different amplifiers. The analogue version performs 5 x 60 Watt sinus, the digital Class-D-amplifier 5 x 200 Watt sinus. The M-series was extended in 2006 by the M10, a 19‚Äú rack solution as central nerve and source centre and in 2010 by the M100, an audiophile Hifi-stereo amplifier with 2 x 200 Watt sinus power, FM- tuner and DVD-drive in an extremely compact housing. For the models M10 and M51, the latter is currently available in version MKII, the insertable modules are identical. For the M100 the modules, except for Multiroom, are offered as pluggable supplementations to the basic model. network receiver Joy S119 (since 2012) In the Multiroom operation the control of the rooms is effected by wall control units of the type M217/M218, by the remote controls M207 or M208 or by Apps, which are momentarily only available for the iOS-operating system. In addition to the pure Audio server M37 MKII the Multimedia server M117 was introduced in 2011. In 2012 Revox presented the new audiophile network receivers Revox Joy S120, S119 and S118. The workmanship of the devices is typically for Revox on a very high level and is characterised by the selection of precious materials like aluminium and glass. At the begin of 2020 Revox surprised with a new belt-driven turntable Studiomaster T700, which has a tone arm made of carbon fiber and a built in MC-Pre-amplifier. It is delivered with an Ortofon Quintet Bronze pick up.alpha-audio.net 2020-02-13, Revox presents Studiomaster T700 turntable, retrieved 2020--05-03.  Reel to reel revived  As of May 2016, Revox announced the re-introduction of a reel- to-reel tape player, to be released in the first quarter of 2017. Manufactured and developed in conjunction with HORCH HOUSE (a division of Lutz Precision k.s.), it will initially be a playback-only machine, with a recorder/reproducer to follow.  Loudspeakers  For more than 40 years, Revox has been producing loudspeakers. The first speaker of the brand Revox was the series 46 (1970), which was developed for the former HiFi system A77, A76 and A50. The AX- (1976), the BX- (1977) and the BR-series (1980) followed. All speakers were developed and manufactured in the Revox plant in Ewattingen / Black Forest. Numerous other speakers went along with the company in the 1980s. The most famous speakers were the Symbol B (1983) as well as the first Revox active speaker Agora B (1986). A milestone in the speaker development was the two digital active speakers Scala 4.7 (1994) and Scala 3.6 (1996). 1980 also saw the introduction of the Triton, one of the first sub-woofer / satellite systems for home high fidelity. The Triton subwoofer comprised a 200 lb cabinet designed to also act as a piece of furniture on which the entire B7xx series (including B77) could stand. The Triton system was superseded by the smaller and more compact Piccolo, and later the Power Cube, which was a Piccolo bass unit with built-in power amplifiers and optional remote control and multi-room controller. In 1987, Revox acquired the rights to manufacture the Stereolith Duetto, a single-box stereo loudspeaker. Built in the shape of a triangular prism, the Duetto was designed to complement, in acoustics and appearance, the Piccolo bass unit (passive operation) or the Power Cube (active operation). Today‚Äôs Revox range includes a very comprehensive speaker assortment. Classical three-way speakers such as the Prestige of the Re:sound G or Re:sound S series, medium and small speakers as well as a very comprehensive range of installation speakers, which come into operation especially in the multi-room field.  In popular culture  In the film Chaplin (1992), a Revox machine is being used in Charles Chaplin's sessions with his biographer. The film Diva (1981) features Revox B700 series components as playback equipment for the bootleg operatic recording of the diva. Derren Brown, in his TV Show Trick of the mind, convinces Simon Pegg that his ideal birthday present would be a BMX bike, by having a Revox B77 tape recorder playing in the room, and suggesting that the visual image of such a machine subliminally suggests a bicycle. In Deutschland 83 (2015 TV series), Revox PR99 reel to reel recorders (among other brands) are used by East German authorities to covertly record NATO operations. Robert Fripp used Revox machines to produce his Frippertronics recordings in the late 1970s onward, until he replaced the recorders with digital delays in the 1990s.

Life He was born at Heusden, in the Dutch Republic, studied at Leiden, and in 1611 became Protestant pastor of Vlijmen, whence in 1617 he returned to Heusden. In 1619, he played an influential part in the Synod of Dort, at which he was the youngest delegate. In 1634, Voetius was made professor of theology and Oriental science at the University of Utrecht. Three years later he became pastor of the Utrecht congregation. He was an advocate of a strong form of Calvinism (Gomarism) against the Arminians. The city of Utrecht perpetuated his memory by giving his name to the street in which he had lived. Utrecht controversy with Descartes In March 1642, while serving as rector of the University of Utrecht, Voetius persuaded the university's academic senate to issue a formal condemnation of the Cartesian philosophy and its local defender, Henricus Regius. According to the senate's statement, Cartesian philosophy was to be suppressed because: # it was opposed to 'traditional' (i.e. Scholastic/Aristotelian) philosophy; # young people taught Cartesian philosophy would be unable to understand the technical terminology of Scholasticism; and # it had consequences contrary to orthodox theology.. Translated in John Cottingham, Robert Stoothoff, and Dugald Murdoch, trs., , esp. pp. 393‚Äì94. Descartes countered with a personal attack on Voetius, in a letter to Jacques Dinet, which he made public in the second edition (1642) of his Meditations. Voetius was provoked into getting Martin Schoock to produce a book-length assault on Descartes and his work, the Admiranda methodus (1643). Descartes associated the quarrel with the part Voetius was playing with another controversy with Samuel Maresius, who was at least sympathetic to some Cartesian ideas. Legal and diplomatic moves followed (the protagonists were in different provinces in the Netherlands); and Maresius at the University of Groningen was able to extract some admissions from Schoock that were quite damaging to Voetius. In his long letter to Voetius (Epistola ad Voetium), Descartes mentioned Aristotelianism only twice; by contrast, the topics of theology, faith, and atheism were put on the table hundreds of times. Both Descartes and Voetius acknowledged that the issue they treated was most of all theological. Voetius pursued the faith-seeking-understanding program whereas Descartes repudiated the faith-lacking-understanding project. The primary concern of Voetius was not to preserve Aristotelianism but to keep the biblical truth that, as he put it, was received from orthodox tradition. Descartes insisted that the article of faith did not fall under the regime of human reason because faith was something one could not fully grasp with reason. He argued that whoever embraced the articles of faith for incorrect reasoning would commit a sin no less grave than those who rejected them. What Descartes desperately defended was the autonomy of human reason and its proper use. In his philosophical enterprise, faith seemed to hinder the autonomy and the use of reason. He believed that his method of doubt would provide a firm road to perfect knowledge. Voetius, however, argued that human reason was surrounded by error and sin, so that perfect knowledge was impossible for humans. He maintained that human beings would be able to learn the truth from divine revelation, which was the only principle in the pursuit of truth. Therefore, for Voetius, Cartesianism was primarily confronted with scriptural truth, not with Aristotelianism. ReferencesSources * . * Andreas J.

Biography=Education Hall, son of the literary scholar John Lesslie Hall, was born in Williamsburg, Virginia, and attended The College of William & Mary for three years before transferring to the U.S. Naval Academy where he graduated in 1913. He starred in American football for three seasons at William and Mary and four years at the Naval Academy. He excelled in three sports at the Academy and was awarded the coveted \\"Academy Sword\\" for athletic excellence. Early career As a junior officer he served in the battleships and . During World War I he trained engineering personnel on the battleship , and was engineering officer of the destroyer . During the years following the war he had sea duty, mainly in destroyers, and served ashore as a Naval Academy instructor. From the mid-1920s until 1934, Hall was successively an Aide to the Naval District commandant at Charleston, South Carolina, Executive Officer of the submarine tender , Commanding Officer of the destroyer , spent three years with the Naval Academy's physical training and athletics programs, and was a Navigation Officer on the battleship . Promoted to commander in 1934, he went to the Far East to serve in heavy cruiser , and then commanded the gunboat , and a destroyer division. During the late 1930s Hall was at the Naval War College, initially as a student, then as a member of the staff. In July 1940 he achieved the rank of captain and was given command of the battleship . This was followed by staff duty with elements of the Atlantic Fleet. World War II In mid-1942 Hall was appointed rear admiral for the invasion of Morocco, and was the chief of staff of the Western Naval Task Force during the North African landings in 1942, receiving the Distinguished Service Medal for opening ports and preventing sabotage while commander of Northwest African Sea Frontier. In February 1943, he became commander of Amphibious Force, North African Waters (Eighth Fleet), expertly cross-training army artillerymen and navy gunners so that his ships' call-fire missions could be conducted in direct support of troop advances rather than at \\"targets of opportunity.\\" His concept proved devastating to enemy forces and tank divisions as he led one of the major assault forces engaged in the Sicilian Occupation (9-12 July 1943) and the bitterly contested landings at Salerno (9-21 September 1943). These bold achievements brought him two awards of the Legion of Merit. In November 1943, he took command of the 11th Amphibious Force in the United Kingdom, earning the Army's Distinguished Service Medal for his leadership of amphibious Force \\"O\\" which landed and effectively supported the Army V Corps on the Omaha Beach sector off the coast of Normandy in June 1944. He received a second Navy Distinguished Service Medal for command of the Southern Attack Force (Task Force 55) during the Okinawa campaign. In October 1945, he became commander of Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet, receiving the rank of vice admiral a few months later. Postwar After the war he was commandant of the Fourteenth Naval District and, in 1948, commandant of the Armed Forces Staff College at Norfolk, Virginia. From August 1951 until his retirement in May 1953, he was commander of Western Sea Frontier, with additional duty as commander of Pacific Reserve Fleet. On leaving active duty, he was advanced to the rank of full admiral on the basis of his combat awards. General of the Army Dwight Eisenhower, the Allied Supreme Commander of all Allied forces on the Western Front during World War II, gave Hall the nickname \\"Viking of Assault\\". General George Patton, who was often a tough critic of fellow military leaders, heaped high praise on him. Admiral Hall died on 6 March 1978 at the age of 86. The papers of Admiral Hall can be found in the Special Collections Research Center at the College of William & Mary. Namesakes The guided-missile frigate (launched 1981) was named in his honor.

The irrigation water is transported to the valley from sources in the Sierra Nevada via the California Aqueduct. Minerals from these sources are carried in the water and concentrated by evaporation from aqueducts, canals, and fields. This has resulted in an exceptionally high accumulation of selenium and other minerals in the wetlands. Wildlife in this region suffered deformities due to selenium poisoning, drawing the attention of news media and leading to the closure of the refuge.

At least 84 people were killed. Background In 1997, Algeria was at the peak of a brutal civil conflict that had begun after the military's cancellation of 1992 elections set to be won by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). Guerrillas fighting the government took refuge in the forest of Bainem west of Algiers. The Sidi Youssef neighborhood of Beni Messous (see detailed map) stands just on the edge of this forest. Beni Messous is an outlying suburb of Algiers (see map) along the Beni Messous river, home to a large military barracks. One account indicates that a military search for guerrillas in the forest was underway when the massacre started. Massacre At about 10 pm on September 5, 1997, about 50 howling men arrived in Sidi Youssef, wielding knives and machetes, and started breaking into houses and killing those within. The victims screamed for help and banged pots and pans to alert their neighbors. Security forces did not arrive until 1 am, despite being stationed close by. The terrorists killed at least 87 people that night, according to the Associated Press; no official death toll was issued, and two political parties, FFS and HMS, claimed about 150 were killed, whereas Daikha Dridi (babelmed) reports 53. It was followed by a second night of killing the next day which reportedly left another 45 dead. Responsibility No group claimed responsibility, but militant Islamist groups such as the GIA were blamed. The Algerian government told the UN Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2000/3/Add.1) that \\"A judicial inquiry was opened, and on 7 July 1998 an anti-terrorist raid was carried out on the hideout of the eight culprits. The legal proceedings continue.\\" It is unclear how to reconcile this with what a general told the UN investigative panel that visited the site on 27 July 1998: \\"of those who had committed the atrocities only eight were still at large and one was in Serkadji prison. The leader of the terrorist group had been shot dead 10 days earlier.\\" Amnesty International has questioned the state's response, saying that \\"Beni Messous has the largest barracks and military security centre of the capital, as well as several other gendarmerie and security forces centres from which the site of the massacre is clearly visible. The army barracks of Cheraga (see map) is only a few kilometres away. Neighbours telephoned the security forces who refused to intervene saying the matter was under the mandate of the gendarmerie. They called the gendarmerie but received no reply, and the attackers left undisturbed.\\" However, the aforementioned general argued to the UN panel, with the help of a topographic map, that the army and gendarmerie had been unable to prevent the massacre, saying that \\"bombs had been set off to stop the army; and electrical power had been turned off by the attackers. The neighbouring farmers had not been able to provide help, as the terrorists had planted explosives, but they had alerted the security forces whose post divisional headquarters was a few kilometres away.\\" He added that the government had urged the main family attacked to move somewhere safer earlier, and it had refused, and reported claims that the family in question had been feeding the terrorists and had possibly become rich as a result. Aftermath Many families fled Sidi Youssef following these massacres; some took refuge in the Beni-Messous stadium and were still there in 2002. The houses where the massacre took place were demolished by mayoral decree in 2001; only scattered ruins remain, and no plaque marks the spot. Eyewitness quotes Quoted by Rachid Khiari, Associated Press, Sept. 7: : \\"We heard victims screaming and cries for help, but no one came,\\" one of those who escaped told The Associated Press. : \\"They kicked the door in, took the men, forced them outside, slit their throats,\\" one woman -- the sole survivor of her family -- told The Associated Press. \\"They came back, took out my aunt and slit her throat, after slashing open her stomach,\\" said the woman, who identified herself only by her family's name, Benbrahin. The woman escaped through a window of her home, then hid in a nearby forest until daybreak. Quoted by Daikha Dridi (babelmed 2003): : Everyone remembers that terrible night: ‚Äúit happened a bit further down, where the disaster stricken people‚Äôs town is today. That night, they were putting projectors up to light up the forest so that they could see the terrorists, when one started to hear people screaming‚Äù says Rafiq.

The two lower lenses are used for the photograph, while the third lens is used for composition. A stereo camera is a type of camera with two or more lenses with a separate image sensor or film frame for each lens. This allows the camera to simulate human binocular vision, and therefore gives it the ability to capture three-dimensional images, a process known as stereo photography. Stereo cameras may be used for making stereoviews and 3D pictures for movies, or for range imaging. The distance between the lenses in a typical stereo camera (the intra-axial distance) is about the distance between one's eyes (known as the intra-ocular distance) and is about 6.35 cm, though a longer base line (greater inter-camera distance) produces more extreme 3-dimensionality. In the 1950s, stereo cameras gained some popularity with the Stereo Realist and similar cameras that employed 135 film to make stereo slides. 3D pictures following the theory behind stereo cameras can also be made more inexpensively by taking two pictures with the same camera, but moving the camera a few inches either left or right. If the image is edited so that each eye sees a different image, then the image will appear to be 3D. This method has problems with objects moving in the different views, though works well with still life. Stereo cameras are sometimes mounted in cars to detect the lane's width and the proximity of an object on the road. Not all two-lens cameras are used for taking stereoscopic photos. A twin-lens reflex camera uses one lens to image to a focusing/composition screen and the other to capture the image on film. These are usually in a vertical configuration. Examples include would be a vintage Rolleiflex or a modern twin lens like a Mamiya C330. Nimslo quadralens lenticular Types of stereo cameras V√©rascope 40 A Kodak stereo camera A View-Master Personal stereo camera There have been many types of cameras that take stereo images, most of which are no longer manufactured. The most notable types are: * Jules Richard Verascope * Kodak Stereo Camera ‚Äì Kodak's own offering in the field of Realist format cameras which actually outsold the Realist during the five years it was available and might have eclipsed it in all time sales had it been introduced prior to the end of 1954. * Loreo 3D Lens in a Cap (Hong Kong), an accessory device, which incorporates a pair of small closely spaced lens, and a simple mirror box as an attachment for many modern SLR digital cameras. The latest version has 25mm wider angle lenses. Loreo also makes currently, a cross-view 35mm film only, 3D CAMERA, (model 321) which takes \\"deeper\\" stereo images, with a wider mirror system, sold with a folding print viewer included. * Nimslo 3D ‚Äì The first compact consumer level lenticular camera, designed to take 3D prints that are viewable without glasses or special technique. Though it didn't \\"catch on\\" and was soon discontinued, it inspired many 3 and 4 lens clones marketed well into the 1990s. * RBT ‚Äì In the modern 3D world, a several thousand dollar RBT camera was made in Germany by rebuilding two 35mm high end cameras into an integrated and unitized stereo camera. RBT announced the discontinuation of the cameras on January 1, 2011. * Stereo Realist ‚Äì The original \\"Realist Format\\" camera, first sold in 1947, which inspired many imitators who introduced cameras capable of producing the 5P stereo slides which remain fairly popular to this day. * View-Master Personal Stereo Camera ‚Äì Introduced in 1952, this camera allowed individuals to make their own personal View-Master reels, either by using the commercial processing services available at the time or by using the custom cutter and blank reel mounts. * Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W1, a digital stereo camera. In 2009, 3D technologies experienced a resurgence, including stereo cameras, with continuing developments in plenoptic camera technologies, as well as the emergence of stereo digital camera products such as the Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D series and the Minoru 3D Webcam. Since 2014, computer vision developments and increasing embedded GPU computing power have opened up new applications for stereo cameras. These can be used to calculate a depth map through advanced image processing techniques. In April 2015, Intel has revealed a camera that can fit in a smartphone to serve various depth sensing applications such as changing the focus of a photo after it has been taken, 3D scanning and gesture control. Other recent stereo cameras include the ZED Camera, Tara - Stereo Camera and the Duo 3D Sensor Digital stereo bases (baselines) There are different cameras with different stereo bases (distances between the two camera lenses) in the nonprofessional market of 3D digital cameras used for stills and video: * ? mm Inlife-Handnet HDC-810 * 10 mm Panasonic 3D Lumix H-FT012 lens (for the GH2, GF2, GF3, GF5, GF6 cams and also for the hybrid W8 cam). * 12 mm DXG-5D8 cam and the clones Medion 3D and Praktica DMMC-3D. * 15 mm Ararat Macro Beam Splitter for smartphones. * 20 mm Sony Blogie 3D. * 23 mm Loreo 3D Macro lens. * 25 mm LG Optimus 3D, LG Optimus 3D MAX (smartphones) and the Cyclopital3D close-up macro adapter (for the W1 and W3 Fujifilm cams). * 28 mm Sharp Aquos SH80F and SHI12 (smartphones) and the Toshiba Camileo z100 camcorder. * 30 mm Panasonic 3D1 camera, Camex 3D cam and LG IC330 (LG Cinema 3D camcorder). * 32 mm HTC Evo 3D smartphone. * 35 mm JVC TD1, DXG-5G2V, VTech Kidizoom 3D, GoPro HD Hero kit 3D, Nintendo 3D, Vivitar 790 HD (only for anaglyph stills and video), and AEE 3D Magicam. * 40 mm Ararat Beam Splitter for smartphones and 3D Aiptec camcorders (Aiptek I2 -also the Viewsonic clone-, Aiptek I2P, Aiptek IS2 and Aiptek IH3 3D cams). * 50 mm Loreo for full frame or non digital cams, and the 3D FUN cam of 3dInlife (also the clones Phenix PHC1, Phenix SDC821 and Rollei Powerflex 3D). * 55 mm SVP dc-3D-80 cam (parallel & anaglyph, stills & video). * 60 mm Vivitar 3D cam (only for anaglyph pictures), Camex3D(World first three-lens digital-3D-cam, 30,60mm bases)LED-light over Centerlens useless-reflexions on centerlens!) * 65 mm Takara Tomy 3D ShotCam. * 75 mm Fujifilm W3 cam. * 77 mm Fujifilm W1 cam. * 84 mm Sony Digital Recording Binoculars DEV-50 * 88 mm Loreo 3D lens for digital cams. * 105 mm Ararat13(eBay)-beamsplitter for APS-C(also FF?) and Compactcams. similar Kula3d-Deeper. * 140 mm Cyclopital3D base extender for the JVC TD1 and Sony TD10. * 200 mm Cyclopital3D base extender for the Panasonic AG-3DA1. * 214 mm Cyclopital3D base extender for the Sony Digital Recording Binoculars DEV-50. * 225 mm Cyclopital3D base extender for the Fujifilm W1 and W3 cams Use of multiple cameras Dual camera of smartphone Xiaomi Pocophone F1 Dual cameras Modern low cost digital cameras, and even DSLR cameras, can be mounted in pairs, with both triggered simultaneously. For nonmoving images this can be done by pressing both camera actuating buttons simultaneously, but this is not sufficiently accurate for moving objects. Certain camera models can accept modified programming from an image chip, and the software to trigger a slave camera from a master has been developed as open source software. A popular example of this technology is in the Samsung Galaxy S4, which allows photo capture simultaneously. Use of one camera and one lens In late 2012, Samsung announced its NX300 camera. Using just one (optional) lens, this camera can take 2D photos, 3D photos, or Full HD movies, simply by changing the mode. The optional lens is a proprietary, 45mm f/1.8 prime lens. The NX300 has two LCD screens in the optical path which are used to \\"black out\\" their respective half of the lens, sending a slightly different image to the sensor. Another method is used by Sony and Panasonic. With burst captures, the camera should be shifted sideways about 10 centimeters and the camera will choose the two best images with which to create a 3D MPO file. The depth is not as good, but can certainly allow the differentiation of what is in front and what is behind. Pentax and K√∫la 3D have made stereoadapters, sometimes called beamsplitters, for stereoscopic photography with DSLR camera lenses.

These characters take their name from the Greek personification of Time and have the ability to time travel. He is the archenemy of the Atom. Publication history The David Clinton version of Chronos first appeared in The Atom #3 and was created by Gardner Fox and Gil Kane. In 1974, Chronos was a founding member of the Injustice Gang. The Walker Gabriel version of Chronos first appeared in Chronos #1 and was created by John Francis Moore and Paul Guinan. Fictional character biography=David Clinton The archenemy of the Atom (Ray Palmer), Chronos started his career as petty thief David Clinton, who attributed his consistent incarceration to his timing, or lack thereof. To improve his timing, he studied the rhythm of time pieces and by practice he learned to synchronize each of his actions with the beat of the prison clock. By the end of his sentence he had developed an extraordinary sense of timing which he resolved to use to further his criminal career. He then adopted the colorful costume and alter ego of Chronos, the Time Thief. Clinton had acquired an unhealthy fascination with time and he developed a series of gimmick weapons and deathtraps based on time pieces (clocks with blades as hands, flying sun dials). He liked to give time related puns, such as \\"Time is golden!\\" when spraying golden gas at Green Lantern. Chronos made his debut in Ivy Town, but was defeated by the Atom when he tried to steal an atomic clock because of an idea ironically given to him by Ray Palmer. He came close to deducing the Atom's secret identity when he realized the Atom attacked him soon after Ray saw him, and succeeded in capturing the Atom and placing him inside a watch. The Atom escaped the watch while Chronos was breaking into a vault, and used a trick to make him think he was wrong. However he escaped from jail by adapting a guard's watch, making the ticks so loud they broke open his cell door. He next tried to steal a collection of historic Hungarian clocks which each had a gem hidden inside, but was again defeated. The Atom has since thwarted all of Chronos' plans. Each appearance or new crime prompted an evolution in Chronos' weaponry. His study of time led to more intricate and revolutionary inventions--lenses that prevent people from seeing certain events (e.g. his getaway vehicle or another specific object), circuitry embedded in his costume that could control the local flow of time (freezing people in time or altering his own perception of time), an hourglass of concentrated time that could speed points up briefly and even make bricks next to a bank vault crumble in a few seconds, and ultimately a fully functional time machine (before it and the designs were destroyed). One story suggests that Chronos may have been receiving help from a future version of himself, but it is unknown at what relative time frame that Chronos came from. Another story, published in World's Finest Comics #321 (1985), suggests that Chronos made the transition from a mere thief with a time gimmick to a full-fledged time traveler after becoming acquainted with the mysterious Dr. Fox (perhaps named after Gardner Fox), a criminal scientist who had never been apprehended and who was described by Chronos as \\"the greatest mind since Einstein.\\" Pre-Crisis Chronos was a member of the Crime Champions, a trio of Earth-1 villains who teamed up with a trio of Earth-2 villains to commit robberies, then escape to the other world using a vibratory device the Fiddler accidentally discovered. Chronos is able to escape Wonder Woman, Batman and Green Lantern after stealing a million dollars from the Powers City Bank. When the Earth-2 Crime Champions impersonate the Earth-1 Crime Champions, the Icicle impersonates Chronos with the help of the Wizard's Tibetan magic, and fought Batman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern, making them touch rubber, animal, and glass as part of a spell to trap the JLA. On Earth-2 Chronos tries to steal a rare clock from a lighthouse, and uses his vibratory watch to put Aquaman into a coma, but Superman is able to revive Aquaman and captures Chronos, crushing his watch. The JLA and JSA are captured again and magically placed in cages in space, but with the aid of the Green Lanterns escape and return to Earth. Chronos tries to help the Fiddler find an Earth-3 with his chronological knowledge, but is defeated by the Martian Manhunter and Black Canary. Chronos eventually stopped stealing for his own gain and began stealing to finance his time research. The Atom had always thwarted Chronos, but he had decided to turn his back on humanity and had retreated to a peaceful seclusion with a group of six-inch tall aliens in the Amazonian jungle. Chronos had more success without the Atom, but he brought himself to the attention of the Blue Beetle when he tried to blackmail one of the employees of Kord Inc. He also fought the Beetle during Darkseid's anti-hero riots. During one struggle against the Beetle, Chronos was hurled 100 million years into the past where he encountered a time-lost Captain Atom. He later met a time traveling Superman who Chronos manipulated into helping him get home. Upon his return to the present, Chronos was able to use his technology to manipulate the money markets to amass a fortune. However, Chronos's illegal endeavors were discovered and he was returned to prison. He was freed by the Calendar Man to work with the Time Foes, but was captured by the Teen Titans. Out of desperation and humiliation, Chronos took a drastic chance ‚Äî he accepted an offer from the demon Neron and exchanged his soul for the metahuman ability to manipulate time. However bargains with Neron are never fair and Chronos found that each journey through the timestream accelerated his aging. A man who should have been a healthy adult became an aged senior citizen. Clinton's efforts to bypass this flaw - passing his artificial age onto youths with a special glove of his own creation and intercepting other time travelers in an attempt to acquire their technology - brought him briefly into conflict with the Legion of Super-Heroes, in a somewhat confusing and often non-linear sequence of events. All the experiments and Neron's \\"gift\\" had taken a toll on Clinton's body and he began to lose touch with any sense of the \\"now.\\" He had trouble staying localized in time and appeared to fade away into nothingness. His disappearance was enough for him to be declared dead and speculation has suggested that he may have slipped into \\"The Void\\" of time. A funeral of sorts was held and his research was passed on to the second Chronos (Walker Gabriel). Time travel being what it is, David Clinton's legal death has not meant the end of his presence in the DC universe; he has made several appearances since, such as during the Identity Crisis, when he claimed to have traveled forward from a point in time shortly before his final disappearance. This foreknowledge of his own (suspected) demise led to a somewhat subdued, even morose, demeanor. In The All-New Atom #12, it was revealed that the wacky Anagram guy that has been testing and helping Ryan Choi (The New Atom) is none other than Chronos himself. In issue #20, he is revealed as the mastermind behind all of the strange occurrences surrounding Ivy Town since the start of the series. His vengeful goal is to destroy everything that Ray Palmer loved. He's able to do so by joining forces with Lady Chronos, a new companion and lover who once was Jia, Ryan's love interest in their college years. With Jia's intimate knowledge about Ryan, he was able to add a further layer of credibility to his ruse, faking years of correspondence and epistolary friendship between Ryan and Ray Palmer, spurring Ryan to follow in Palmer's footsteps only to disgrace him in the eyes of Ivy Town, shaming the Atom's legacy forever. With some help from the real Ray Palmer, Ryan is eventually able to overcome the couple, and prevent David and Jia from messing again with Ivy Town.The All-New Atom #25 They retreat into the timestream, where they are noticed by Starro the Conqueror who, after being thwarted in his attempts to gain total domination over time by enslaving Rip Hunter and his Time Masters, retaliates by dominating Chronos' and Lady Chronos' minds, using them to travel in time and put Booster Gold against Rip, eradicating the Time Masters.Booster Gold #25 Post-Flashpoint, David Clinton is an agent of A.R.G.U.S. who specializes in time travel. He was tasked with finding Booster Gold;Justice League International Annual #1 (October 2012) however, he had apparently failed his mission and was captured by the Outsider of the newly formed Secret Society of Super Villains. Green Arrow discovers him as a captive while pursuing Professor Ivo. Professor Ivo states that the engine that Chronos is stuck in is activated. Chronos causes a temporal neutral field to envelope the manor, causing it to freeze in place throughout time, while the Earth turns....which means that the Earth moves, not the manor. Chronos was eventually rescued by the Justice League of America.Justice League of America #5 (Aug. 2013) Chronos travels to early-Happy Harbor and intercepts the God of Superheroes, Ahl as he descends to Earth from Final Heaven. Chronos holds him hostage against the Justice League who eventually defeat him.Justice League #28-29 Walker Gabriel Chronos #1 (March 1998). Art by Paul Guinan. Walker Gabriel got possession of Clinton's research after his death. He became the second Chronos and was the lead character of a short- lived comic book series published by DC Comics, acting as both a hero and a criminal depending on circumstances, and often running afoul of the Linear Men. He was eventually revealed to be the son of a temporal theorist who had worked with Clinton and created Chronopolis, the city beyond time. The series ran for 12 issues (including a DC One Million crossover numbered 1,000,000) between March 1998 and February 1999, and concluded with Gabriel wiping himself from history, to save his mother's life. The nature of Chronopolis, however, meant he still existed despite not being born. Still, due to an unclear series of events, it appeared in fact two Walker Gabriels existed: one outside of time, one within it, but only up to the point when he removed himself out of it. After that, the timeline streamlined and only the timetraveling Chronos remained. Gabriel had many encounters with members of the Linear Men and also met Destiny of the Endless during this series. Gabriel briefly appeared in the pages of JSA (2005); there, he was killed by Per Degaton when he was struck by a car a decade before receiving his time-travel powers; however, as is the case when Degaton's adventures end in failure, his death was reversed. Gabriel most recently had a cameo in Superman Beyond 3D #1 as an inhabitant of Limbo. Lady Chronos (Jia) Jia, a young Chinese woman from Hong Kong, was the longtime sweetheart of the young and socially awkward Ryan Choi, a stereotypical nerd more interested in science than a social life. Eventually, Jia and Ryan parted, and she ended up marrying the local football jock, Alvin, a guy who at high school did his best to make Ryan's life miserable. Ryan Choi, now an American teacher and the new Atom, at Ivy University, was contacted again by Jia, claiming that her husband, who had died in unclear circumstances, had resurfaced as an undead being who was harassing and stalking her. Ryan, still carrying a torch for Jia, returned to Hong Kong to fight the menace of Alvin, and his undead gang of bullies. There Alvin revealed how Jia herself had brutally killed him, and she was far from being the helpless woman she pretended to be to rekindle her relationship with Ryan. They parted again. Sometime after that, Jia came into possession of Clinton's research, and became the third Chronos, or later Lady Chronos. Wearing a female version of the classic Clinton's outfit, she allied with Clinton in his attempt to destroy Ivy Town and ruin the Atom's reputation for good. Using her knowledge about Ryan, she helped Chronos into faking a mail correspondence with Ryan, giving him the shrinking belt he eventually used to become the Atom, but planting the seeds of his downfall, trapping part of the denizens of Ivy Town in a microverse held in strange viral constructs hidden in Ryan's bloodstream. With some help from the former Atom, Ray Palmer, Ryan dodged the bullet, but still feels responsible for Jia's wrongdoings. Jia claims that Dwarfstar, master assassin and shrinking nemesis of Ryan, is her \\"firstborn\\". Whether she's speaking literally, or metaphorically as both men got their powers by her actions, remains to be seen.The All-New Atom #25 Lady Chronos is later seen as a mind-controlled pawn of Starro the Conqueror, along with Chronos. During her battle against Booster Gold for ensuring Starro's domination of the timestream, she reveals to know with a certain degree of intimacy the future adventures of Booster and his sister Goldstar, having observed and interacted with them.Booster Gold #13 (2008) Other versions * In JLA/Avengers Chronos is among the enthralled villains defending Krona's base in #4. He is defeated by Wasp. In other media=Television Chronos as seen in Justice League Unlimited * The David Clinton incarnation of Chronos appears in the two-part Justice League Unlimited animated series episode \\"The Once and Future Thing\\" voiced by Peter MacNicol. A meek physics professor from the Batman Beyond era, he was ostracized by his peers for his theories on time travel but secretly perfected a time travel device in the form of a belt. Aware of the problems of time paradoxes, he uses the device to add to his collection of rare artifacts, stealing the items from the past at the points when they would no longer be missed (e.g. Cleopatra's comb, an early draft of the Magna Carta, etc.). However, when his wife Enid Clinton (voiced by Mindy Sterling) learns of this, she scolds him for not using the belt to make themselves rich. Eventually, her incessant hectoring drove him to retreat into the past. While trying to steal Batman's utility belt, he attracts the attention of Batman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern so he tries to escape and they follow him and are accidentally pulled into the Old West. In the time between his arrival and theirs, Clinton's time belt was stolen by local villain Tobias Manning and used it to steal future technology and take over the town. After the three League members as well as several Western heroes (consisting of Jonah Hex, Bat Lash, El Diablo and Ohiyesa Smith) defeat Manning, Clinton tricked Batman into enabling him to get the belt and retreated into his time. Now power-hungry and increasingly unstable, he makes himself \\"the undisputed master of space and time\\" while adopting his Chronos identity. After following Chronos to the Batman Beyond era, the three Leaguers discover he has become a time-traveling warlord and that his constant trips through time have severely impacted the timeline; the Titanic and the Leaning Tower of Pisa are situated alongside Gotham's architecture, among other historical figures. They also find that Chronos has allied with the third brand of the Jokerz. Chronos's irresponsible actions are causing time to collapse. After Wonder Woman was erased from existence, Batman and Green Lantern team up with the remaining roster of the JLU: Warhawk (the son of Green Lantern John Stewart & Hawkgirl), Static, Batman II and the future version of Bruce Wayne. Now fearful, Enid leads the combined Justice League to the Old West jail that Chronos had brought to the future where he slept every night (presumably because his six months in the jail cell were a vacation away from his nagging wife and far more comfortable to him). After a pitched battle where Static and Batman II are killed and Warhawk barely survived, only Batman, Green Lantern and Chronos are left incapacitated. As time begins to fall apart all around them, Chronos escapes into the timestream with the intention of going back to beginning of time so he can rewrite the history of the universe and make himself into a god. When the two heroes catch up with him, Batman inserts a disc into Chronos's belt that reverses everything that had happened just before they reach the beginning. With the timeline restored, Green Lantern and Batman return to the present day (retaining the memories of their experience but Wonder Woman does not) while Clinton himself is stuck in a permanent time-loop of the last few seconds of his life before the whole chain started, which happens to be his wife Enid berating him for all eternity (a la Groundhog Day). Although he is depicted as an arch-enemy to Ray Palmer (also appearing in the series) in the comics, they never met each other in this interpretation. * Chronos appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Sword of the Atom!\\". He has returned to attack the city causing Batman and Ryan Choi to look for Ray Palmer. By the end of the episode, Batman, Ryan Choi, and Aquaman end up fighting Chronos while Ray Palmer stays with the Kartathians. * Chronos appears as a recurring antagonist in the first season of Legends of Tomorrow, played by Dominic Purcell and Jordan Davis, with the character's voice provided by Steve Blum. He is a temporal bounty hunter, employed by the Time Masters to capture Rip Hunter, who has gone rogue and is leading a team on an unauthorized mission to prevent Vandal Savage from conquering the world. In \\"Left Behind\\", it is revealed that Chronos is an older version of Mick Rory / Heat Wave, a former member of the team. Rory had betrayed them to a band of space pirates which led to his being marooned by his former partner, Leonard Snart / Captain Cold. Found barely alive by the Time Masters, he was brought to Vanishing Point and trained by them to be their agent. When tasked to capture Hunter's team, Rory eagerly accepted. However, he is ultimately defeated by the team and imprisoned on their ship, the Waverider, in the hope of rehabilitating their former teammate. Eventually making peace with the rest of the team, Rory notes during a confrontation with another assassin for the Time Masters that he cannot be considered a traitor as he was only ever on his side rather than the Time Masters'. The Masters attempt to re-initiate Rory as Chronos when the team are recaptured, but he fakes succumbing to his brainwashing so that he can escape and take action against their enemies. * The David Clinton incarnation of Chronos appears in Justice League Action episode \\"Time Share\\", voiced by Andy Richter. He attempts to alter the past so that Batman doesn't survive his first fight with Carmine Falcone. Batman and Blue Beetle follow Chronos into the past to stop him. Upon Blue Beetle spilling his Chrono Bombs enough to slow down the past Batman, Carmine Falcone, and his men, Batman fights Chronos while Blue Beetle works to redirect the gunfire from the guns of Carmine Falcone's men. Carmine Falcone and his men being defeated by the past Batman, and the present Batman and Blue Beetle return to the present and hand Chronos over to the police. Miscellaneous * Chronos makes an appearance in issue #22 of the TV series-based Super Friends comic. * In an issue of Justice League Adventures (adapted from Justice League) titled \\"Wolf's Clothing\\", Chronos (not the latter version in Justice League Unlimited) apparently captured Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman in a single moment of time and plots to auction them off to the highest bidding villain. However, this plan was later revealed to be an elaborate 'sting' operation set up by the Justice League to capture most of their villains, with 'Chronos' actually Batman in disguise and the other League members also disguised as various villains at the auction. In another issue called \\"The Moment\\", after Chronos is released from prison due to the intervention of his future self and a recorded message from the future Superman confirming that Chronos has reformed, Flash and Atom discover that he's traveled to the past to prevent the death of his brother Bobby in a fire, but his interference (to the point that multiple versions of him keep traveling back in time to the same moment to try and change history) threatens to wreck the timestream, forcing them to bring his brother into his future to convince Chronos to move on from his death.

It has the form of a dragon with open wolf-like jaws containing several metal tongues. The hollow dragon's head was mounted on a pole with a fabric tube affixed at the rear. In use, the draco was held up into the wind, or above the head of a horseman, where it filled with air and gave the impression it was alive while making a shrill sound as the wind passed through its strips of material.  Name and etymology  Draco (Latin) and Drakon (Greek) mean \\"serpent\\", \\"dragon\\". The root of these words means \\"to watch\\" or \\"to guard with a sharp eye\\". It is a derivative of Greek drak≈çn \\"gazing\\" .  Origins  The origin of the standard is unknown and still a matter of dispute among scholars. A specific and certain origin is still difficult to be determined. Dacian, Thracian, Scythian, Sarmatian or Parthian origins have been proposed in dedicated historiography. According to Lucre≈£iu MihƒÉilescu-B√Ærliba by the 2nd century AD, i.e. after the conclusion of the Dacian Wars, the draco symbol was assimilated in the Greco-Roman world with the Dacian ethnos. According to Jon N. C. Coulston the Romans associated this standard with 1st and 2nd century Danubian barbarians. The Roman historian Arrian wrote that the Romans took the draco from the Scythians, most probably a term for the contemporary Sarmatians. It is possible that the serpent or dragon theme was the result of early cartography of the Carpathian mountain range, which resembles a dragon or serpent, facing the west with its tail the black sea. The original purpose was probably to provide wind direction for archery.  Significance  Dacian Draco on Trajan's Column Among the Dacians, the draco was undoubtedly seen by the army as a special protective symbol, while it also played an important role in the religious life of the people. The draco shows a religious syncretism between the wolf and the dragon as well as the serpent. It was supposed to encourage the Getae and to scare their enemies. * A wolf was depicted at the standard's head, symbolic animal of the Carpathian people since the phase B of Hallstatt Period (10th-8th century BC). The animal is shown in an aggressive posture similar to that of certain Hittite monsters. The religious association of the dragon with the wolf or the lion is first found around the year 1120 BC, on a stela of Nebuchadnezzar I, where an exact representation of the symbol of the Dacian dragon is found in the fourth quarter. This indicates that the Dacian draco stems from the art of Asia Minor where the religious-military symbology of dragon extended both eastward to the Indo-Iranians and westward to the Thraco-Cimmeriano-Getians/Dacians. By the time of the phase D of Hallstatt Period (8th-6th century BC), the decorative pattern of a dragon head or a serpent had become quite common in Dacia. In the La T√®ne Period (3thBC-1st century AD), it served as a standard for the Dacians. The image of the draco appears on a 4th-century BC ceramic piece discovered at Budureasca commune, Prahova county, Romania. The Dacians bearing the draco on Trajan's Column * The body of the standard, depicting a dragon- like balaur or a large snake, was seen by the Dacians as a manifestation of the sky demon or \\"heavenly dragon\\". This relates to their supreme god Zalmoxis who was a sky god (cf. also Tomaschek). In the Hallstatt Period \\"proper\\", the decorative pattern of a dragon head or a serpent became quite common in Dacia. The dragon symbol is also represented on the silver Dacian bracelets of the Classical period. The snake-shaped bracelets and other similar ornaments show not only the spread of the snake as a decorative motif but also its significance in Dacian material civilization.  Dacian Draco in warfare  Dacians marched into the battle accompanied by the howl of wolf-headed trumpets and following their sinister multicolored dragon-head standard. As intended, they made a terrifying audiovisual spectacle. The draco first appears on Trajan's Column in Rome, a monument that depicts the Dacian wars of 101‚Äì102 AD and 105‚Äì106 AD. German historian Conrad Cichorius notes that, even though Dacians carry the draco, it was called the Scythian draco in Arrian's Tactica written around 136 AD. According to Ellis Minns, the dragon standards of the Arrian were those of the Dacians. Representations of the Dacian Draco Draco is borne by Dacian cavalry crossing the Danube (Trajan's Column) Dacian Draco on Trajan's Column  Trajan's Column in Rome  On Trajan's Column (113 AD), Dacian soldiers are represented carrying a draco in 20 scenes. One depicts the draco borne by Dacian cavalry crossing the Danube by swimming with their horses. In another, the draco is planted in the center of a Dacian citadel and surrounded by the skulls of several Roman prisoners. On Trajan's Column the draco is the symbolic image of victory although it is absent from pictures on the column that illustrate Trajan's second war against the Dacians, when the Romans conquered about 18 ‚ÑÖ of Dacia territories in quest for gold to pay their legions .  Roman coins of Dacia  The draco appears on coins of Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius (r.138-161 AD), indicating that it was still the characteristic emblem in the 2nd century. In AD 250 on a coin of Decius the Roman province of Dacia holds a wolf- or hound-dragon standard. The same type also occurs on antoniniani coins of Claudius Gothicus (r.268-270) and Aurelian (r.270-275). Dacia with draco on antoninianus of Trajan Decius, AD 250-251  Arch of Galerius in Thessaloniki  The characteristic Dacian dragon emblem is carried by a group of Dacian horsemen depicted on the Arch of Galerius and Rotunda in Thessaloniki, Greece.  Funerary sculptured monument of Chester  Dacian or Sarmatian rider with draco from Deva Victrix. In display at Grosvenor Museum. A draco (considered in 1955 by R. P. Wright of Dacian or Sarmatian type) is depicted on a large stone found at Deva Victrix (Chester, UK) in the North Wall (West) in 1890. The dragon flag is represented horizontally, as held by the cavalryman but its head is not visible, because the stone is rather deteriorated. Most scholars consider the horseman is a Sarmatian, wearing a Sarmatian helmet and carrying a Sarmatian standard. According to MihƒÉilescu-B√Ærliba (2009) the depiction of the Dacian standard is certain and similar representations can be observed on the most important monuments of the Roman triumph over Dacians. A military diploma (dated to 146 AD) found at Chester mentions among the units of the released soldiers the name of cohors I Aelia Dacorum. Therefore, the horseman depicted on the tombstone at Chester could be a Dacian cavalryman, belonging to a vexillatio of cohors I Aelia Dacorum. P. A. Holder suggest that the cohort was created in 102 or a little earlier, with Dacians settled in the Empire, and it received the name of Aelia later.  Dacian Draco as adopted by the Roman army after 106 AD  The so-called Danubian Riders-God or Dacian Riders-God (object from maybe 2nd century AD, Bucharest Antiquities Museum) bears a draco. The first sculptural representation of a draco borne by a Roman soldier dates from the time of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (r.161 to 180 AD). Scholars believe that the draco was adopted by the Roman army following their conquest of the Dacians. Some scholars such as Osborne (1985) and Ashmore (1961) consider that the draco was adopted by the Romans from the Dacians. It became the standard of the cohort in the same way that the aquila or Imperial eagle was the standard of the Roman legion. The adopted standard in the Roman cavalry was borne by a draconarius. Later, the draco became an imperial ensign. The draco was specific not only to Roman occupied Dacia but also to the Sarmatian and Parthian regions. As a result, some alternative origins for the Roman army's draco have been proposed. According to Franz Altheim,Altheim Franz (1938) Die Soldatenkaiser, Frankfurt the appearance of such ensigns in the Roman army coincided with the recruitment of nomad troops from Central and Southern Asia, and it was from this region that the image passed into Iran and subsequently to Europe. Thus, based on Altheim's theory, the Dacians and Germans would then have inherited it from the Sarmatian people. Compared to those of the Dacians and Romans, the Sarmatian Draco was more Oriental in appearance with prominent ears, dog-like teeth and even fins. It did not usually have scales or the distinctive crest of the dragon-like gilded head of a late Roman standard found at Niederbieber, Germany. Its head may have been represented by the legendary Iranian simurgh -- half-wolf, half-bird. Based on the clan's totem, could have been a fish head as well. On the Trajan's Column, Sarmatian Roxalani horsemen, don't carry a Draco at all. The heads of the Dacian draco-standards represented on Trajan's column are also canine. But, they are of an entirely different type, having short, round-nosed muzzles, protruding eyes, upright ears, gaping, circular jaws and no-gill fins. MihƒÉilescu-B√Ærliba (2009) suggests that at the end of the 1st century A. D., the Romans associated the draco with Dacians. Draco was an icon symbolizing the Dacians (as was the Dacian falx).  Votive tablets  Carolingian cavalrymen from the 9th century with a draco standard Dacian Draco and weapons from Trajan's Column by Michel-Fran√ßois Dandr√©-Bardon A Dacian Draco on a 1993 Romanian 5000 lei bill A draco banner is carried by one of the Danubian Riders, native Dacian deities, on a Danubian plaque ascribed to the first two decades of the 4th century. Because of the great importance of this symbol in the religious and military life of the Dacians, some writers believe that the draco must have been directly adopted and reproduced on the so-called Danubian plaques dating to the 3rd-4th centuries. According to some researchers such as Dumitru Tudor, the presence of this military ensign on the Danubian plaques is explained simply as due to chance -- the result of a fortuitous combination of horseman and sky-god themes through the imagination of native sculptors.  Copies  The only copy left is a dragon-like gilded head of the late Roman standard found at the Niederbieber, Germany.  Legacy  The draco was generally introduced in the 4th century as a Roman standard. When Constantine placed the Christian symbol on military ensigns instead of the dragon, the name outlived the change, and the standard-bearer remained the draconarius. Sometimes the ancient symbol is found joined to the new, the dragon being placed beneath the cross. The cavalrymen of the Carolingian dynasty continued raising the draco previously adopted by the Roman Empire over their forces in the 8th, 9th, and 10th centuries. Draco probably continued in use in Sub-Roman and Anglo-Saxon Britain; the Bayeux tapestry has Harold's standard bearer holding one. The legendary King Arthur and his knights may have their origins in the Saramatian heavy cavalryman stationed in Britain, the surname \\"Pendragon\\" borne by Arthur and his father Uther may refer to draco standard. It is also possible that the story of a fight between a Red and a White Dragon related in the Historia Brittonum refers to two Draco standards carried by rival sub-Romano British factions. The Red Dragon on the modern Welsh national flag may derive from the draco carried by Roman, and presumably Romano British cavalry units stationed in Britain, i.e. the Sarmatians stationed in Ribchester. Art and literature Michel-Fran√ßois Dandr√©-Bardon included the Dacian Draco in his Costume des anciens peuples, √† l'usage des artistes The Romanian artist Adam Nicolae created the sculpture Steagul Dacic 'The Dacian Flag' that can be seen in OrƒÉ»ôtie, Romania. According to Saxon ethnographer Teutsch, Transylvanian Romanians may have inherited something of the \\"snake-cult\\" of the ancient Dacians, who are known to have had a dragon (or snake) as a \\"victory banner\\". He mentions that some doorknockers are shaped like snake heads (protective ones in this case). Furthermore, in Romanian villages in the Bra»ôov's region surveyed by Teutsch, the vaults of certain gates bear snakes carved in the shape of garlands with their ends representing the \\"sun-wheel\\".  Mythology  According to historian Vasile P√¢rvan, the Dacian war flag, representing a wolf with a serpent's body, depicted the balaur. The balaur is not identical to the other creature of Romanian myth., the zmeu. The biggest difference is that the zmeu, even if it has some lizard features, nevertheless is a human-like figure, while the balaur is the true form of the dragon. Usually, in all Romanian myths, legends and fairy tales, the balaur always has three, five, seven, nine or twelve heads. The balaur sometimes is a malefic figure, but most of the times is a neutral figure, guarding various places, objects or knowledge. Also, in various myths and lore, there will be a series of dragons that have to be defeated in order to obtain the precious objects or entrance to the guarded places, usually three dragons, with scales of iron, silver and respectively gold, or silver, gold and respectively diamond, each stronger than the previous one, the number of their heads increasing with the difficulty. Some motifs developed in the folk tradition that defines the snake as protective of the household correspond, to some extent, to the interpretation of a protective Dacian \\"Dragon\\" symbol.

The process is the opposite of sorption (that is, either adsorption or absorption). This occurs in a system being in the state of sorption equilibrium between bulk phase (fluid, i.e. gas or liquid solution) and an adsorbing surface (solid or boundary separating two fluids). When the concentration (or pressure) of substance in the bulk phase is lowered, some of the sorbed substance changes to the bulk state. In chemistry, especially chromatography, desorption is the ability for a chemical to move with the mobile phase. The more a chemical desorbs, the less likely it will adsorb, thus instead of sticking to the stationary phase, the chemical moves up with the solvent front. In chemical separation processes, stripping is also referred to as desorption as one component of a liquid stream moves by mass transfer into a vapor phase through the liquid-vapor interface. After adsorption, the adsorbed chemical will remain on the substrate nearly indefinitely, provided the temperature remains low. However, as the temperature rises, so does the likelihood of desorption. The general equation for the rate of desorption is: R = r N^x where r is the rate constant for desorption, N is the concentration of the adsorbed material, and x is the kinetic order of desorption. Usually, the order of the desorption can be predicted by the number of elementary steps involved: Atomic or simple molecular desorption will typically be a first-order process (i.e., a simple molecule on the surface of the substrate desorbs into a gaseous form). Recombinative molecular desorption will generally be a second-order process (i.e., two hydrogen atoms on the surface desorb and form a gaseous H2 molecule). The rate constant r may be expressed in the form :r=Ae^{{-E_a}/{kT}} where A is the \\"attempt frequency\\" (often the Greek letter u), the chance of the adsorbed molecule overcoming its potential barrier to desorption, E_a is the activation energy of desorption, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.  Desorption mechanisms  Depending on the nature of the absorbent/adsorbent-to-surface bond, there are a multitude of mechanisms for desorption. The surface bond of a sorbant can be cleaved thermally, through chemical reactions or by radiation, all which may result in desorption of the species.  Thermal desorption  Reductive or oxidative desorption  In some cases, adsorbed molecules are chemically bonded to the surface/material, providing a strong adhesion and limiting desorption. If this is the case, desorption requires a chemical reaction which cleaves the chemical bonds. One way to accomplish this is to apply a voltage to the surface, resulting in either reduction or oxidation of the adsorbed molecule (depending on the bias and the adsorbed molecules). In a typical example of reductive desorption, a self-assembled monolayers of alkyl thiols on a gold surface can be removed by applying a negative bias to the surface resulting in reduction of the sulfur head-group. The chemical reaction for this process would be: R-S-Au + e^- \\\\longrightarrow R-S^- + Au where R is an alkyl chain (e.g. CH3), S is the sulfur atom of the thiol group, Au is a gold surface atom and e‚àí is an electron supplied by an external voltage source.Sun, K., Jiang, B., & Jiang, X. (2011). Electrochemical desorption of self- assembled monolayers and its applications in surface chemistry and cell biology. Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry, 656(1), 223-230. Another application for reductive/oxidative desorption is to clean active carbon material through electrochemical regeneration. Electron-stimulated desorption shows the effects of an incident electron beam on adsorbed molecules Electron-stimulated desorption occurs as a result of an electron beam incident upon a surface in vacuum, as is common in particle physics and industrial processes such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM). At atmospheric pressure, molecules may weakly bond to surfaces in what is known as adsorption. These molecules may form monolayers at a density of 1015 atoms/(cm2 ) for a perfectly smooth surface,.M. H. Hablanian (1997). High- Volume Technology, A Practical Guide. Second Edition. Marcel Dekker, Inc. One monolayer or several may form, depending on the bonding capabilities of the molecules. If an electron beam is incident upon the surface, it provides energy to break the bonds of the surface with molecules in the adsorbed monolayer(s), causing pressure to increase in the system. Once a molecule is desorbed into the vacuum volume, it is removed via the vacuum's pumping mechanism (re-adsorption is negligible). Hence, fewer molecules are available for desorption, and an increasing number of electrons are required to maintain constant desorption.

After the PrizeFreeview video 'An Interview with Edmond Fischer' by the Vega Science Trust He is the oldest living Nobel laureate at age .  Early life and education  Fischer was born in the Shanghai International Settlement, China. His mother, Ren√©e Tapernoux, was born in France, and his father, Oscar Fischer, was born in Austria. His father practiced as a lawyer in Shanghai before the various consular courts in the city.Oscar Fischer's biography in Men of Shanghai and North China, p129 Fischer's maternal grandfather founded the \\"Courrier de Chine\\" in Shanghai, which is the first newspaper published in French in China; he also helped to establish \\"l'Ecole Municipale Fran√ßaise\\" in Shanghai, where Fischer attended primary school. At age 7, Fischer and his two older brothers, Raoul and GeorgeOscar Fischer's biography in Men of Shanghai and North China, p129, were sent to the Swiss boarding school La Ch√¢taigneraie, near the home town of his mother, Ren√©e Tapernoux, in Vevey. At high school he made a pact with a childhood friend, one of them would become a doctor and the other a scientist and then they could cure the ills of the world. While at high school Fischer was admitted to the Geneva Conservatory of Music, he also considered becoming a professional musician. At the completion of high school, Fischer wanted to study microbiology; however, he was advised to study chemistry. He studied at the University of Geneva during World War II, he enjoyed organic chemistry and also studied biology. He completed a PhD in organic chemistry under the supervision of Kurt Heinrich Meyer, who worked on the structure of polysaccharides, and the enzymes needed for their synthesis and breakdown. Fischer worked on alpha-amylase. Reversible protein phosphorylation Career and research After his PhD, Fischer went to the United States in 1950 for postdoctoral research. He was supposed to take up a position at Caltech, but he was also, unexpectedly, offered a position at the University of Washington, Seattle. Seattle reminded Fischer and his wife of Switzerland so they chose to settle there. Six months after his arrival in Seattle, Fischer began collaborating with Edwin G. Krebs. They worked on glycogen phosphorylase; Krebs and Fischer defined a series of reactions leading to the activation/inactivation of this enzyme as triggered by hormones and calcium, and in the process discovering reversible protein phosphorylation. Explained simply reversible protein phosphorylation works like this: a protein kinase moves a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a protein. The shape and the function of the protein is altered enabling it to take part in converting glycogen into glucose which is used for fuel for muscular contractions. When the protein has completed its role a different protein phosphatase removes the phosphate and the protein reverts to its original state. This cycle takes place to control an enormous number of metabolic processes. For the key discovery of reversible protein phosphorylation, Fischer and Krebs were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1992. Through his career, Fischer's research continued to look at the role reversible protein phosphorylation played in a variety of cellular processes.  Awards and honors  Fischer won numerous awards including the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1992. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2010. He was awarded the Werner Prize from the Swiss Chemical Society and the Prix Jaubert from the University of Geneva. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1972 and a Member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1973.

He received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research and the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize of Columbia University in 1989 together with Alfred Gilman and, together with his collaborator Edmond H. Fischer, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1992 for describing how reversible phosphorylation works as a switch to activate proteins and regulate various cellular processes. Edwin Krebs is not to be confused with Hans Adolf Krebs (1900‚Äì1981), who was also a Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning biochemist and who discovered the citric acid cycle, which is also known as the Krebs cycle. Early life and education Krebs was born in Lansing, Iowa, the third child of William Carl Krebs, a Presbyterian minister and Louise Helen (Stegeman) Krebs. The family moved frequently due to the nature of his father's work, though they settled in Greenville, Illinois when Krebs was six and remained there until his father's unexpected death in 1933. Louise Krebs decided to move her family to Urbana, Illinois, where Krebs's elder brothers were attending the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Krebs attended Urbana High School, and enrolled at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign in 1936. In his fourth year of study Krebs had decided to either pursue a higher degree in organic chemistry or study medicine. Receiving a scholarship to attend Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, he chose the latter. The School of Medicine afforded Krebs the opportunity to train as a physician as well as to gain experience in medical research. Following graduation in 1943, he undertook an 18-month residency at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis and then went on active duty as a medical officer in the Navy. Krebs was discharged from the Navy in 1946 and was unable to immediately return to hospital work; he was advised to study basic science instead. He chose to study biochemistry and was postdoctoral fellow to Carl and Gerty Cori, working on the interaction of protamine with rabbit muscle phosphorylase. At the completion of his two years' study, Krebs decided to continue his career as a biochemist. Research work In 1948 Krebs accepted a position as assistant professor of biochemistry at the University of Washington, Seattle. When Edmond H. Fischer arrived at the Department in 1953, the pair decided to work on the enzymology of phosphorylase. During the course of their study they were able to observe the mechanism by which interconversion of the two forms of phosphorylase takes place: reversible protein phosphorylation. Explained simply, in reversible protein phosphorylation a protein kinase takes a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and attaches it to a specific site on a protein, introducing both extra mass and negative charge at that site. This can alter the protein's shape and turn its function in a biological process up or down, either by changing its activity or its ability to bind to another protein. The protein can be converted back to its original state by a protein phosphatase that removes the phosphate. This cycle controls numerous metabolic processes, and plays a central role in the regulation of cell division, shape, and motility. Derangement of specific protein phosphorylation pathways is important in human disease, including cancer and diabetes. Fischer and Krebs were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1992 for the discovery of reversible protein phosphorylation, . Later life and death Krebs's interest in teaching and administration led him to leave the University of Washington to become the founding chairman of the Department of Biochemistry at the University of California, Davis. In 1977 he returned to the University of Washington as Chairman of the Department of Pharmacology. Krebs died on December 21, 2009. He is survived by his wife Virginia and three children.

It was developed as a simple front wheel driven van after World War II. A total of 473,289 were produced in 34 years in factories in France and Belgium. Design Like the 1934 Citro√´n Traction Avant, the H had a unitary body with no separate frame, front independent suspension, and front-wheel drive. For a commercial van, this combination provided unique benefits ‚Äì a flat floor very close to the ground, and standing height, with a side loading door. The distinctive corrugated bodywork used throughout the period of production was inspired by German Junkers (Aircraft) starting from the First World War until the 1930s, the three-engined Junkers Ju 52 being the last to use this construction.Gijsbert-Paul Berk, Andre Lefebvre and the Cars He Created at Voisin and Citroen , Veloce, Paris, 2009, , p.95 Henry Ford also adopted this construction for the Ford Tri-Motor passenger aircraft. The ribs added strength without adding weight, and required only simple, low-cost press tools. The flat body panels were braced on the inside by 'top hat' box sections, at right angles to the ribs. The welded floor was strong enough to support a horse. Marketing Most H Vans were sold in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. At the Slough Trading Estate assembly facility (1926-1966), Citro√´n UK built a very small number of right hand drive versions. The German market was supplied by a key competitor, the Volkswagen Type 2, and also by the more comparable DKW Schnellaster. As with the Volkswagen, the H Van could not be sold in the US as a commercial vehicle after 1964, due to the Chicken tax. Mechanical The engine, gearbox and many smaller parts are shared with other Citro√´n models. The engine and gearbox are nearly identical to those in the Traction Avant and later the DS, only mounted with the engine in front of the gearbox. The headlights were identical to those of the 2CV, while speedometers were successively borrowed from the Traction Avant and the Ami 6. While the derated Traction avant 4 cylinder engine and the unsophisticated 3 speed gearbox (non syncromesh on first gear) only gave a modest top speed of just under 100 km/h, the chassis and suspension layout provided good roadholding qualities for a van of the era, especially on the short wheelbase version: low slung chassis, with very little overhangs, combined with sophisticated totally independent suspensions (the front ones used double torsion bars instead of conventional coil springs). The 1.9 liter motor offered more usable power than the 1.2 liter motor of its competitor, the 1950 Volkswagen Type 2. Styling changes The basic design changed very little from 1947 to 1981. Vehicles left the Citro√´n factory with only three body styles: the standard enclosed van, a pick-up version, and a stripped-down body which went to non-Citro√´n coach-builders and formed the basis for the cattle- truck and other variants. The basic version had an overall length of 4.26m, but vehicles were also available in a LWB version with an overall length of 5.24m.Wouter Jansen et Fabien Sabat√®s, \\"H\\" Comme Citro√´n - Le Cube Utile, Editions Charles Massin, Paris, 1992, , p.70 In September 1963 the earlier style rear window - a narrow vertical window with curved corners - was replaced with a square window the same height but wider, 45 cm on each side. The bonnet was modified to give two additional rectangular air intakes at the lower edges, one for a heater, the other a dummy for symmetry. In early 1964, the split windscreen used since 1947 was replaced with a single windscreen, while in late 1964 the chevrons on the radiator grille, previously narrow aluminum strips similar to those on the Traction Avant, were replaced with the shorter, pointed style of chevrons as used on most Citro√´n vehicles in the last decades of the twentieth century. In November 1969 the small parking lights were discontinued, the front indicators were recessed into the wings, and the shape of the rear wings was changed from semi-circular to rectangular. Rear hinged 'Suicide' cab doors were used until the end of production in 1981, except on vehicles manufactured for the Dutch market where conventionally hinged doors were available from 1968.Wouter Jansen et Fabien Sabat√®s, \\"H\\" Comme Citro√´n - Le Cube Utile, Editions Charles Massin, Paris, 1992, , p.154 Names Citro√´n's teams worked on 8 projects and only the last one was developed, giving it its name : \\"H\\". Most Type H vans were sold as model HY. Other models include H (early versions), HX (lesser load capacity), HP (flat- bed pick-up), HZ, and HW (greater load capacity). For a time they were also sold as model 1600. When used by the police, it was called \\"panier √† salade\\" (\\"salad basket\\").

Created by writer Jim Shooter and artist Sal Buscema, he first appeared in Avengers #158, dated April 1977. Over the years he has mainly opposed the Avengers in their various incarnations. Originally a gravity researcher, Franklin Hall gains the ability to control gravity; corrupted by this power, he becomes a supervillain using the name \\"Graviton\\". He is confronted and defeated by the Avengers as he tried to destroy the facility where he did his original research. In subsequent appearances Graviton seems to struggle with control of his powers and often loses because of this. More than one storyline has depicted Graviton's apparent death, only for him to return subsequently through various means. He later becomes part of Advanced Idea Mechanics' High Council as \\"Minister of Science\\". Graviton has appeared in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes animated series. Franklin Hall appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe TV series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (portrayed by Ian Hart) in the first season. His Graviton identity (assumed by recurring character Glenn Talbot) also appeared in the series, portrayed by Adrian Pasdar, with Hall himself becoming an unseen entity trapped in the gravitonium that Talbot infused himself with.

When Graviton takes over the research facility and forbids all communications with the outside world, a fellow scientist sends a distress signal to the superhero team the Avengers. A furious Graviton then lifts the facility several thousands of feet into the sky and threatens to kill the scientist. The Avengers then arrive and attack but are all defeated when trapped in a gravity field. Graviton then proceeds to bring the facility to New York, and demands the U.N. to hand over world power or he will destroy the world's cities. At Avengers Mansion a returning Black Panther learns of their plight and joins with the thunder god Thor, having also been on leave from the team, and the two head to the facility. As Thor battles Graviton with Iron Man's help, the Panther frees the captive Avengers, but Graviton defeats them again until he is tricked into thinking a fellow scientist he cares for has committed suicide. Graviton then panics and causes the entire facility to collapse on him, forming a giant stone sphere that is dropped into a river by the Avengers.Avengers #158 ‚Äì 159 (April 1977). Marvel Comics.

Powers and abilities  Franklin Hall was a normal human until empowered by an explosion that intermingled his molecules with sub-nuclear graviton particles generated by a nearby particle generator, which gave him the ability to manipulate gravitons (the subatomic particles that carry the force of gravitational attraction) and anti-gravitons (similar particles but with opposite force and spin of gravitons). Graviton could surround any person or object, including himself, with gravitons or anti-gravitons, thereby increasing or decreasing the pull of gravity upon it. Hall was able to manipulate gravitons for various uses, including the projection of highly concussive blasts, formation of gravitational force fields and levitation, and had also been proven capable of generating gravitational fields in various objects, making them attract any nearby matter (or individuals) not heavy enough or physically strong enough to resist. By decreasing the pull of gravity beneath him, then manipulating its direction of effect, he could fly at any speed or height at which he could still breathe. However, by using his force field generation capabilities he could also breathe in space. By increasing the pull of gravity beneath his opponents, he could pin them to the ground, having made them too heavy to move, or cause sufficient gravitational stress to impair the normal functioning of the human cardiovascular system. He could also cause an inanimate object (such as a diameter rock) to radiate enough gravitons to enormously increase its own gravitational field, able to attract nearby matter and energy. By rapidly projecting gravitons in a cohesive beam, he could generate a force blast with a maximum concussive force equivalent to the primary shockwave of an explosion of 20,000 pounds of TNT. He could also create a gravitational force field around him capable of protecting him from any concussive force up to and including a small nuclear weapon. On a large scale Graviton could exert his gravitational control over a maximum distance of from his body. Thus, the maximum volume of matter he could influence at once is . He once exercised this control by lifting into the air an inverted conic frustum-shaped land mass whose uppermost area was across, and causing it to fly as though it were a blimp.All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Update #1 (2007) He could also erect a gravitational force-field of similar proportions. Graviton could formerly perform as many as four separate tasks simultaneously ‚Äì at one time, he not only lifted a wide land mass as high as cloud level above San Francisco, but at the same time also surrounded himself with a force-field, descended on a small rock, and hurled some policemen and a helicopter into orbit.Thunderbolts #28 Graviton could use his power at maximum capacity for up to eight hours before mental fatigue significantly impaired his performance, and considerably longer (up to eighteen hours) if he conserved his energy during that time. He was somehow also able to bestow the power of self-propelled flight to at least 70 people independent from his location; however he was also able to take this power away with but a thought. With time and training, his powers further advanced, even to the extent of levitating an island miles above ground level, exerting his power even while sleeping,Thunderbolts #29 somewhat reshaping mountains on the Moon,Thunderbolts #53 and demonstrating the ability to lift a small stone in China while residing in L.A., then depositing it in Australia through a victim's head just to see if he could do so.Thunderbolts #54 By separating himself from Earth's gravitational field and instead attuning himself to the incredibly stronger gravitational field of the Sun, he was able to cross the distance from Earth to the Sun almost instantaneously, where his individual force field proved strong enough to withstand the forces of the Sun itself, effectively simulating long-range teleportation.Thunderbolts #56 To return from the Sun to Earth he utilized the Sun's gravitational field as a form of slingshot device and was able to cross the distance to Earth within minutes. Hall's single most ambitious display of power was when he held almost every Marvel hero in stasis, including the Fantastic Four, some of the X-Men and such physical powerhouses as Thor, Hercules, the Hulk and Namor, and began using his powers to try reshaping the Earth in his image.Thunderbolts #57 He also had the ability to detect extra-dimensional-shifts and phased or invisible objects through his immediate awareness of gravitational fluctuationThunderbolts #17Thunderbolts #58 and while he was not able to invoke dimensional portals, he was at least able to close them. He could simulate vast superhuman strength and durability using gravitonic fields to surround his body, but he could not actually manipulate density or increase his physical strength. Aside from his powers to manipulate gravity, Hall had a PhD in Physics and was intellectually brilliant, with expertise in advanced physics, including teleportation. His greatest limitation was that he was emotionally and mentally very disturbed.  In other media = Television  Live action = Ian Hart as Dr. Franklin Hall as seen in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.. Dr. Franklin Hall appears in season one, episode three of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., \\"The Asset\\", played by Ian Hart. This incarnation is a Canadian physicist who is abducted by his former partner, Ian Quinn, so that he can finish work on a gravity manipulator powered by a gravity-manipulating substance called gravitonium. Believing the gravitonium to be dangerous, Hall attempts to destroy the device. S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson tries to save Hall, but the latter is pulled into the gravitonium. The substance reappears later that season in the episode \\"Providence\\", when Hydra agents release it before their leader John Garrett gives the gravitonium back to Quinn. Adrian Pasdar as Glenn Talbot / Graviton as seen in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.. In a flashback in the season five episode \\"Inside Voices\\", Quinn was also absorbed into the gravitonium following Garrett's defeat, and has been arguing with Hall inside the substance ever since before Hydra eventually reclaimed it. During season five, Ruby Hale, a genetically-engineered agent of Hydra, invades a subterranean Hydra facility and infuses herself with 8% of the gravitonium. She fails to control the gravity-manipulating powers that she acquires, and kills one of Hydra's leaders, Werner von Strucker. Ruby is later killed by Elena Rodriguez, and S.H.I.E.L.D. recovers the remaining gravitonium. Later, when S.H.I.E.L.D. comes under attack by Remorath warriors sent by the alien Qovas of the Confederacy, Glenn Talbot infuses himself with the remaining gravitonium, along with Hall & Quinn's consciousness trapped within it. He uses his new abilities to kill the warriors before taking Coulson to confront Qovas. Becoming increasingly narcissistic and unhinged under the corrupting influence of the gravitonium however, Talbot takes control of Qovas' ship and appropriates an alien costume. As he meets the rest of the Confederacy, madness fully takes Talbot as he murders the wisest leader to force his way into the alien group. Deliriously claiming that he can save the world from Thanos' invasion, Talbot kills his Hydra handler Hale, forces Coulson's cooperation, and kidnaps the prophetic Inhuman Robin and her mother Polly Hinton to search for more gravitonium. He is defeated by Daisy Johnson, who enhances her abilities and blasts him into space, averting an alternate timeline where he destroyed the Earth in his search for gravitonium. = Animation = Graviton appears in the two-part The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, episode \\"The Breakout\\" voiced by Fred Tatasciore. Physicist Dr. Franklin Hall was hired by S.H.I.E.L.D. to help them recreate the super- soldier serum that created Captain America, but Hall ended up causing an accident that gave himself near-limitless gravitational powers. Soon after, when it became clear that he was now dangerous, Hall was put into an unconscious state and imprisoned at the Raft by S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury. 10 years later, when a technological problem occurred at the Raft, Graviton was freed and sought to get revenge on Fury, before demonstrating his power to the world. This plot was interrupted by Thor, Wasp, Iron Man, Hulk, and Ant-Man, who as a team fought Graviton to stop him. Following the villain's defeat, the fight inspired the superheroes to stay united as \\"the Avengers\\".  Film  Graviton appears in Avengers Confidential: Black Widow & Punisher as a potential buyer for the organization Leviathan, who plan to auction stolen S.H.I.E.L.D. technology. During the final battle, he battles the Avengers, only to be defeated by Hulk and Iron Man.

It is over above sea level and dominates the surrounding area. History Borough Hill has a history of human habitation dating into prehistory. Remains have been found on the hill of two Bronze Age barrows, two Iron Age hillforts, one of which is the fourth largest found in Britain, and a later Roman villa and farming settlement. The hill is designated as a scheduled monument. In 1823, the historian and archaeologist George Baker undertook the first excavation of the site, he discovered the remains of the Roman villa. The site then underwent a full excavation in 1852 by local historian Beriah Botfield who recorded his findings. His notes, manuscripts and some of the antiquities found are now kept at the British Museum. In 1645, Borough Hill was used as a base by the Royalist army of King Charles I, in the week prior to the Battle of Naseby, in which the Royalists were defeated by Sir Thomas Fairfax's Parliamentarian army. Transmitting station In 1925 the BBC constructed a transmitting station which initially was used for long wave, and short wave broadcasting. The long wave service was moved to a new and better transmitter station located at Wychbold village near Droitwich in 1934. On 26 February 1935, the transmitter was used for an early RADAR experiment, which demonstrated the feasibility of radio detection of aircraft. This was conducted by Robert Watson-Watt and Arnold Wilkins. In 1950 the BBC constructed a mast at nearby Dodford for the BBC Third Programme, with a 150 kW transmitter located in a building near to the short wave transmitter building. This service closed in 1978 and the mast was removed in 1984. Due to the nature of short wave broadcasting, large areas of Borough Hill were occupied with towers, and masts to support large antennas. Transmissions from the short wave station could be received across the world. Many engineers were employed by the BBC to work at the station and a number decided to settle in Daventry, and to this day many former BBC staff remain in Daventry. The BBC decided to close the station and on 28 March 1992 the last transmission took place, and the transmission equipment was moved to other BBC World Service transmitters around the country. The station became an electronic service centre for the repair of BBC transmission equipment, and a local transmitter maintenance team was also based here until the late 1990s. All but one of the radio masts have been taken down, with Arqiva now operating the single remaining mast.

It is on the left bank of the River Wey, around 2 miles (3.2 km) east of the town of Woking and just south of West Byfleet; the M25 motorway is north-east of the edge of the former parish. The village sits on raised mixed heath soil, and has historical links with the abbey at Westminster, in whose possession it remained between the Norman conquest in 1066 and the Dissolution of the Monasteries nearly five hundred years later. Geography At the foot of slopes in the south of the area are agricultural flood plain pasture meadows bisected by the River Wey Navigation; the actual border is the River Wey itself (though slightly inaccurate as based on meanders as they were before 1820). Roads passing through the village include the B367 (Upshott Lane/Church Hill) and B382 (Old Woking Road). Open areas in the south and east of the village are designated Metropolitan Green Belt. History and use in the arts The current village name 'Pyrford' is derived from the Saxon dialect of Old English combined term 'Pyrianford',Pyrford History which scholarly research into Old English asserts means 'pear tree ford'. Famous residents include the poet John Donne, and Jack Brabham who used to live on Forest Road. The Rowley Bristow Hospital from 1928 to 1991 was in Pyrford in the area now occupied by St Martin's Mews and St Nicholas Crescent. Pyrford is mentioned in The War of the Worlds, by H. G. Wells, in which it is near the landing site of the third of ten Martian invasion cylinders. Leisure The River Wey Navigation, to the south-east and east of the village, marks the boundary between Pyrford and Wisley. The area has marked trails for ramblers. A public bridleway going east-west, connects the village to the canal, parallel to unpavemented Lock Lane on the far side of the golf course; following this the path connects to three others: one south via the Anchor to Wisley, to the north-east to Byfleet and to the north along the towpath to New Haw, Coxes Lock, Addlestone and a large island at Weybridge which connects with the pavement of Thames Street, in turn connected to the Thames Path. Pyrford marina by the Dodds Bridge footbridge, and with its own access road, on the Pyrford canalside enables people to hire and own boats; it faces the named public house. July 2012 saw Pyrford's inclusion in what has become the standard version of the London-Surrey cycle classic used in the Summer Olympic Games. Amenities Pyrford Common offers a large open space, car parking and a playground for children. The common is surrounded by a large wooded area. The village is served by shops such as: The Bakery (cooked breakfast, hot drinks, pastries, freshly baked bread and sweet treats), The Co-op convenience store, a wine shop, a hairdresser, a family-run butcher and a veterinarian clinic. The local school is Pyrford Church of England Primary Schoolhttp://www.pyrford.surrey.sch.uk an Academy that is part of The Newark Trust. The school is located on Coldharbour Road and has current Ofsted rating of Outstandinghttp://www.pyrford.surrey.sch.uk/_files/Ofsted/D855E38AB0F7AC7496DEC58977E19B01.pdf since last inspection in January 2013, with 480 students on roll. Owing to an old law, and covenants on land controlled by religious sects, Pyrford had no public house, but there are a few such establishments quite close by. The Anchor pub, by Lock Lane, lies on land once part of Wisley parish. The Inn at Maybury is sited alongside the junction of Old Woking Road and Maybury Hill. The third location for drinking is The Yeoman, a Harvester pub-restaurant, on the Old Woking Road in the neighbouring village of West Byfleet. Instead, two social venues in Pyrford are the Pyrford Social Club, a membership club, next to the cricket club and the Traditions golf club situated on Pyrford Road and open to the general public. These are both licensed for alcohol. Sports Pyrford has three golf courses: Pyrford Golf Course, Wisley Golf Course and Twisted Stone. It is also home to [Pyrford Cricket Club. Founded in 1858, Pyrford is one of the oldest cricket clubs in Surrey, and has achieved success in recent years. The club has been promoted 10 times in the last 10 years, and achieved an unparalleled treble promotion in 2008, with all three Saturday League sides achieving promotion from their respective divisions of the Surrey Championship. Well known former PCC players include former Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu, New Zealand wicketkeeper Gareth Hopkins and Sky Sports presenter Charles \\"Got Him\\" Colvile.

St Nicholas Church ‚Äì Click to enlarge Landmarks=St. Nicholas Church and Conservation Area The Church of St. Nicholas is less than ¬º of a mile north of Newark Priory along a medieval lane and was built around 1140 ‚Äì it is a fine example of a complete Norman church and is one of the significant minority of medieval churches in the United Kingdom in the top category of listed building. It is thought likely that Queen Elizabeth I would have worshipped at St. Nicholas Church. She reputedly donated a silver chalice to the church in 1570. Nave of St. Nicholas Church Original frescoes, painted in red ochre, were uncovered during renovations in 1869 and 1967. There are two sets of drawings from different periods Cottage in the conservation area. with subjects including scenes from Christ's Passion and an illustration of pilgrims preparing to set sail in a pilgrimage to Spain. The church grounds and the surrounding lands are designated a conservation area, having special architectural and historical importance. The area surrounding is believed by local folklore to be haunted, there are many stories involving locals and happenings.  Rowley Bristow Hospital  Rowley Bristow Hospital, an orthopaedic hospital in Pyrford, was founded in 1928. It was formed from St Martin's home for crippled boys and the St Nicholas Hospital Home. Originally named St Nicholas' and St Martin's Orthopaedic Hospital Homes and Special School of Recovery,http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/hospitalrecords/details.asp?id=1606&page;=49 it was renamed in 1948 as the Rowley Bristow Orthopedic Hospital after a well known orthopaedic surgeon, and surgical director of St Nicholas, Rowley Bristow. At its prime it was considered a centre of excellence,http://www.pyrford.com/history/pyrford.html but declined from a peak of 250 beds in 1948 to just 41 shortly before it closed in 1992.http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/hospitalrecords/details.asp?id=1606&page;=49 The orthopaedic department at St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey is now named the Rowley Bristow Orthopedic Unit.http://www.ashfordstpeters.org.uk/orthopaedics See also * List of places of worship in Woking (borough) ReferencesExternal links * Pyrford History * Parish of Wisley with Pyrford * Woking Borough Council Pyrford Plan * Pyrford Cricket Club Category:Villages in Surrey Category:Woking ","title":"Pyrford"},{"id":"1510825","text":"MFZB (abbreviation of Motherfucking Zebrahead, Bitch) is the fourth studio album released by American punk rock band Zebrahead. \\"Rescue Me\\" was released to radio on January 20, 2004.

He was born in 1817 to Khad√≠jih Kh√°num and M√≠rz√° Buzurg of Nur (in the province of Mazandaran), a Persian nobleman, and went on to be a leader in the B√°b√≠ movement, and then established the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in 1863. Bah√° ºu'll√°h's family consists of his three wives and the children of those wives. Titles of descendants One of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's titles is Sadratu'l-Muntah√°, which translates from Arabic as the tree beyond which there is no passing (a quote from Qur ºan 53:14). In this connection, Bah√° ºu'll√°h entitled his descendants with terms relating to the Sadratu'l-Muntah√°. His male descendants were given the title of AgÕühs√°n (Arabic for \\"Branches\\") which in singular form is \\"GÕühusn\\". In particular, three of his sons were given specific \\"branch\\" titles: *  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° (given name, Abb√°s): GÕühu·π£n-i-A ª·∫ìam ( \\"The Most Great Branch\\"). * M√≠rz√° Muhammad  ªAl√≠: GÕühu·π£n-i-Akbar, ( \\"The Greater Branch\\").GÕühusn-i-A ª·∫ìam and GÕühusn-i- Akbar can both be translated as \\"the great branch\\", \\"the greater branch\\" or \\"the most great branch\\". A ª·∫ìam carries a higher status in Arabic (see , or ), so Bah√° º√≠ authors and others translate  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s title as \\"Most Great\\" and Muhammad  ªAl√≠'s title as \\"Greater\\" (Taherzadeh, 2000, p. 256.). The designations of GÕühusn-i-A ª·∫ìam and GÕühusn-i-Akbar are clear. (Browne, 1918, p. 61, & p. 85 ) * M√≠rz√° Mihd√≠: GÕühu·π£n-i-Athar, ( \\"The Purest Branch\\"). His daughters were given the title of Varaqat (translated from Arabic as \\"Leaves\\"). Thus Bah√° ºu'll√°h's eldest daughter, Bah√≠yyih (given name, Fatimih), was given the title of the Greatest Holy Leaf. During Bah√° ºu'll√°h's lifetime, he referred to his eldest son, Abb√°s, by terms such as \\"Sirru'll√°h\\" (Mystery of God), or \\"Sark√°r-i-√Åq√°\\" (the Master). After the death of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, he chose the title \\" ªAbdu'l-Bah√°\\" (Servant of Bah√°). Bah√° ºu'll√°h did not give his descendants any direct right to the property of others. This contrasts with Shi ªa Islam in which sayyids were given special financial entitlements.  √Ås√≠yih  √Åsiyih was born in 1820 in the village Yalrud, Mazandaran. Her father was Mirza Isma ªil-i-Vazir, a powerful and wealthy Persian nobleman. Bah√° ºu'll√°h addressed her as Navv√°b, and the Most Exalted Leaf. She was chosen to marry the young Bah√° ºu'll√°h based on her rare physical beauty, wealth and piety. The family had pre-existing roots with Bah√° ºu'll√°h's family by virtue of their influence in the royal court which may have influenced the marriage arrangements. They married some time between 24 September and 22 October 1835 aged 15 in Tehran and she had seven of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's children, of whom only three lived to adulthood. She died in 1886 in  ªAkk√°, and is buried on Mount Carmel within the vicinity of the Shrine of the B√°b. Bah√° ºu'll√°h named her his \\"perpetual consort\\" and her son as his vicar. Bah√° º√≠s regard the children of √Ås√≠yih and Bah√° ºu'll√°h to be the Bah√° º√≠ \\"holy family\\". Her children were:   ªAbbas Effendi  Abbas Effendi Better known as  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°,  ªAbbas was born in 1844 and died in 1921. He was the oldest child of √Ås√≠yih and Bah√° ºu'll√°h. He was variously referred to by Bah√° ºu'll√°h as \\"Mystery of God\\", \\"The Master\\", \\"Perfect Exemplar\\" and \\"the Most Great Branch\\". After Bah√° ºu'll√°h died on 29 May 1892, the Will and Testament of Bah√° ºu'll√°h named  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° as Centre of the Covenant, successor and interpreter of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's writings. During his time as head of the religion, while still a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire, he met with many pilgrims and was in constant communication with Bah√° º√≠s around the world. After the 1908 Young Turks revolution freed all political prisoners in the Ottoman Empire,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° was freed from imprisonment and in 1910, with the freedom to leave the country, he embarked on a three-year journey to Egypt, Europe, and North America, spreading the Bah√° º√≠ message. On 27 April 1920, he was awarded a knighthood by the British Mandate of Palestine for his humanitarian efforts during World War I.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° died on 28 November 1921, and he is currently buried within one of the rooms at the Shrine of the B√°b.  Bah√≠yyih  Bah√≠yyih Kh√°num in 1895 Bah√≠yyih Kh√°num was born in 1846 and was the eldest daughter of Bah√° ºu'll√°h and √Ås√≠yih Kh√°num. She was entitled the Greatest holy Leaf. She was particularly dear to her father and is seen within the Bah√° º√≠ Faith as one of the greatest women to have lived. She stood by and remained faithful to the Centers of the Covenant over years of infighting within Bah√° ºu'll√°h's family that led to the expelling of many of them. She was given the position of acting head of the religion repeatedly when  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° (during periods between 1910 and 1913), and Shoghi Effendi (during periods between 1922 and 1924), were absent from the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre in Haifa. Shoghi Effendi in particular felt her support during a difficult period following the death of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. She died on 15 July 1932 and was buried in the Bah√° º√≠ gardens downhill from the Bah√° º√≠ Arc on Mount Carmel, under the Monument of the Greatest Holy Leaf raised for her at the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre.  M√≠rz√° Mihd√≠  M√≠rz√° Mihd√≠ in 1868 M√≠rz√° Mihd√≠ was born in Tehran in 1848 and was entitled the Purest Branch. He died at the age of 22 on 23 June 1870 in  ªAkk√° after a fall through a skylight while he was preoccupied in prayer. The death is significant as Bah√° º√≠s believe that Bah√° ºu'll√°h offered him the chance of being cured. However, he chose to use his life as a sacrifice so that the close imprisonment of the Bah√° º√≠s would end. M√≠rz√° Mihd√≠ was eventually buried alongside his mother in the gardens below the Bah√° º√≠ Arc on Mount Carmel in Haifa near his brother and sister.  Others  √Ås√≠yih bore at least four other children all sons, but due to their early deaths little is known about them: *K√°zim who died sometime in Persia. *S√°diq who died aged 3‚Äì4. * ªAl√≠ Muhammad who died in Mazandaran at the age of 7 in 1852. * ªAl√≠ Muhammad who was born and died in Baghdad at the age of 2.  Fatimih  Fatimih was born in 1828 in Mazandaran and was generally known as Mahd-i-'Ulya. A first cousin of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, Fatimih was married at fourteen to an influential cleric several decades older than she was. She seems to have been widowed shortly afterwards, perhaps aged sixteen. It is reported that Bah√° ºu'll√°h's aunt implored him to wed his widowed cousin and he reluctantly agreed to do so. They married in 1849 in Tehran and she had six of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's children, of whom four survived to adulthood. She was said to have been very jealous of and harboured great enmity towards  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. She died in 1904, and was later labelled a Covenant-breaker. Her children are:  Samadiyyih  Samadiyyih married Majdu'd-Din, who was the son of Aqay-i-Kalim, Bah√° ºu'll√°h's brother; Majdu'd-Din was one of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s greatest critics, and Samadiyyih and Majdu'd-Din were eventually declared Covenant-breakers. She died at age 49 in 1904/5 and her husband died at over one-hundred years of age in 1955.  Muhammad- ªAl√≠  M√≠rz√° Muhammad  ªAl√≠ M√≠rz√° Muhammad  ªAl√≠ was born in Baghdad in 1853. Bah√° ºu'll√°h called him the \\"Greater Branch\\" and when Bah√° ºu'll√°h declared  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° his successor, he set that Muhammad  ªAl√≠ was next in rank after him. Motivated by jealousy of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° he conspired to undermine his brother's leadership, but he was unable to gain extensive support from the Bah√° º√≠s. When  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° died, his will went into great detail about how Muhammad  ªAl√≠ had been unfaithful to the Covenant, labelling him a Covenant-breaker, and appointing Shoghi Effendi his successor instead. Muhammad  ªAl√≠ was described by Shoghi Effendi as the \\"Arch-Breaker of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's Covenant\\". Muhammad  ªAl√≠ died in 1937.  ·∏å√≠y√° ºu'll√°h  ·∏å√≠y√° ºu'll√°h ·∏å√≠y√° ºu'll√°h (alternate spelling: Z√≠y√°'u'll√°h) was born August 15, 1864 in Edirne (modern day Adrianople). He swayed between the two sides in his brothers' argument, and died before taking part in an act against  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, but has still been labelled a Covenant-breaker. He died on October 30, 1898. He married Thurayy√° Samandar√≠, daughter of Shaykh K√°zim-i- Samandar. The marriage was childless, and according to Samandar's memoirs, M√≠rz√° Muhammad  ªAl√≠ had prevented her from returning to him. After his death in 1898, ·∏å√≠y√° ºu'll√°h was initially buried next to his father at the Shrine of Bah√° ºu'll√°h at the Mansion of Bahj√≠. However, having been declared a Covenant- breaker, ·∏å√≠y√° ºu'll√°h's remains were disinterred in a \\"process\\" of \\"purification\\" through \\"cleansing\\" the \\"inner sanctuary\\" of the \\"most hallowed shrine,\\" the \\"Qiblih\\" of the \\"Bah√° º√≠ World\\" at the request of relatives opposed to the Covenant-breaker faction of the family.  Mirza Badi ªu'llah Effend√≠  Mirza Badi ªu'llah Effend√≠ was born in Adrianople in 1867. For much of his life he supported his brother's challenge to  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s authority as Centre of the Covenant. However, in 1903 Badi ªu'llah rejected Muhammad-  ªAl√≠, and delivered his loyalty to  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and circulated an open letter denouncing Muhammad- ªAl√≠, known as Badi ªu'll√°h's epistle; however his loyalty to  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° was short lived. He died in Israel on November 1, 1950.  Others  Mahd-i-'Ulya bore at least two other children: * ªAl√≠ Muhammad who died at the age of 2 in Baghdad. *S√°dÕühij√≠yyih KÕüh√°num who was born in Baghdad and died at the age of 2 in Constantinople.  Gawhar  Gawhar was born in Kashan to a B√°b√≠ family of the city. She was brought to Baghdad by her brother Mirza Mihdiy-i-Kashani with his intention reportedly being for her to serve the household and √Ås√≠yih Kh√°num. Bah√° ºu'll√°h married her some time around 1862. When Bah√° ºu'll√°h left Baghdad in 1863, unlike the other two wives, Gawhar remained in Baghdad. During her time in Baghdad she stayed and lived with her brother. Shortly afterwards, the Bah√° º√≠ community of Baghdad was rounded up and exiled to Mosul, and Gawhar with her brother were some of the exiles. Her brother wrote a number of times asking Bah√° ºu'll√°h to allow them to enter Akk√° and finally he accepted. Brother and sister arrived in late 1870. Gawhar may have been a maid of the first wife of Bah√° ºu'll√°h when he married her. Bah√° ºu'll√°h and Gawhar had one daughter, Fur√∫gh√≠yyih who was born in  ªAkk√°. Both mother and daughter were declared Covenant-breakers after the death of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Gawhar died sometime between 1892 and 1921.  Furughiyyih  Relatively little is known about Furughiyyih. Furughiyyih was the daughter of Bah√° ºu'll√°h and she was married to Siyyid Ali Afnan, the son of the B√°b's brother-in-law. She, her husband and her children (in particular her eldest Nayyir), all sided with Muhammad- ªAli, and were labelled Covenant- breakers. She bore four children: * Late Hussain Effendi Afnan * Nayyar Effendi Afnan * Feyzi Effendi Afnan * Hassan Effendi Afnan She died of cancer.  Plurality of wives  Bah√° ºu'll√°h had three concurrent wives, when his religion teaches monogamy, and this has been the subject of criticism. Bah√° º√≠ teachings on gender equality and monogamy post-date Bah√° ºu'll√°h's marriages and are understood to be evolutionary in nature, slowly leading Bah√° º√≠s away from what had been a deeply rooted cultural practice. Bah√° ºu'll√°h married his first wife in Tehran when they both were Muslims, and he married his second wife also in Tehran, when he, his first wife, and his new wife were all B√°b√≠s and no longer Muslims. According to the laws and tradition of Islam, which Bah√° ºu'll√°h would have been following at the time of his marriages, a man is allowed four wives. Bah√° º√≠ marriage laws were written in the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas more than ten years after his last marriage. In that book he limits the number of wives to two with no concubines and states that having only one wife would be the cause of tranquility for both partners. This was later interpreted by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° that having a second wife is conditional upon treating both wives with justice and equality, and was not possible in practice, thus establishing monogamy. This interpretation is probably influenced by the equivalent reasoning of some Muslim scholars who interpret the Quran's permissive stance on polygamy - restricted to 4 wives - as indicated in verse 4:3 to be subject of the impossible condition of absolute justice on part of the husband.  Bah√° º√≠ apologia  The general view among Bah√° ºu'll√°h's family and Bah√° º√≠s today is that all the wives were legal and equal. The question about how this conforms to religious law is addressed directly in two letters from Universal House of Justice quoting Shoghi Effendi twice: :\\"Bah√° ºu'll√°h had no concubine. He had three legal wives. As He married them before the \\"Aqdas\\" (His book of laws) was revealed, he was only acting according to the laws of Isl√°m, which had not yet been superseded. He made plurality of wives conditional upon justice;  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° interpreted this to mean that a man may not have more than one wife at a time, as it is impossible to be just to two or more women in marriage.\\" :\\"...Bah√° ºu'll√°h married the first and second wives while he was still in Tihr√°n, and the third wife while he was in Baghd√°d. At that time, the Laws of the \\"Aqdas\\" had not been revealed, and secondly, he was following the Laws of the previous Dispensation and the customs of the people of his own land.\\".Letter from Universal House of Justice: 1998, April 06, Memorandum re Wives of Bah√° ºu'll√°h Bah√° º√≠s argue that polygamy is an ancient practice and other religions did not require monogamy.Universal House of Justice, (1996), p. 449, and Letters from Universal House of Justice, October 23, 1995, June 27, 1996, and April 06, 1998. Under the Law of Moses a man could take as many wives as he chose. Most Christian groups have historically not practiced and condemned polygamy; some, however, have advocated it. In the Arabian peninsula Muhammad introduced a limit of four wives; polygamy was unlimited in pre- Islamic Arabia. The Bah√° º√≠ Faith slowly introduced monogamy to a region that considered polygamy a righteous lifestyle. Note 89 of the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas comments on the verse in question: :\\"Bah√° ºu'll√°h, who was revealing his teachings in the milieu of a Muslim society, introduced the question of monogamy gradually in accordance with the principles of wisdom and the progressive unfoldment of his purpose. The fact that he left his followers with an infallible interpreter of his writings enabled him to outwardly permit two wives in the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas but uphold a condition that enabled  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° to elucidate later that the intention of the law was to enforce monogamy.\\"Synopsis and Codification... of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, note 89 Notes References         * Further reading * *Momen, Moojan Cyprus Exiles, The: in Bah√° º√≠ Studies Bulletin, 5:3-6:1, pp. 84‚Äì113. 1991-06.

In 1948 he took over the leadership of the party temporarily (when the former leader Axel Pehrsson-Bramstorp had suffered a stroke) and was formally elected to the post in 1949. In 1951 the Centre Party entered into a coalition government with the Social Democrats, and Hedlund became Minister of the Interior. In the end, the parties could not agree about a new pension system, and after a referendum in 1957 on the matter the Centre Party and the Social Democrats went their separate ways.

Her debut was in 1987 under the guidance of her father, Mohammad Suleiman. Following her divorce from Magdy Aref in 2000, Angham took much more control over her image and musical style after that Leih Sebtaha (Why Did You Leave Her) record established her into a strong position amid the constant emerge of new voices in the Middle East music scene. After a highly publicized feud between Alam El Phan Music Records' president Mohsen Gaber and the artist, she moved to another record company, Rotana. In 2005, she released the album Bahibbik Wahashteeny (I Love You, I Miss You). It was critically acclaimed, but commercially was not as expected. After three years, Angham returned to the forefront of Arabic pop music in 2007 with her album Kolma N'arrab (Whenever We Come Closer) which sold more than 500,000 CDs across the Middle East in less than three months and was awarded a platinum certification. Life and music career=Childhood and youth Angham was born in Alexandria, Egypt, the eldest child of Mohammad Suleiman, a former violinist, music composer, orchestra chief, and singer, while her mother, Mageda Abdel Haleem, is a well- known artist. She grew up in a very religious Islamic family. The family moved to Cairo by the late 1990s, and settled down at elMohandiseen Street, an avenue reputated for having many celebrities as residents. Angham has three siblings. Her brother, Khaled, is studying music arrangements. Owing to his physical handicap, Angham kept her third sibling, Ahmad, away from the spotlight and his identity and whereabouts remain anonymous to this day. Angham began singing at around the age of sixteen, and her uncle, Emad Abdel Haleem, began teaching her how to present herself to an audience. Angham performed for the first time in public during Cairo's Radio syndicate ceremony because they were looking for new voices to artistically adopt them. She sang \\"elGennah Taht Akdamek\\" (Paradise Is Under Your Feet) as a dedication to the mothers who were present during the concert. She recalled how her father was not pleased with her performance and that his negative attitude was the major force that propelled her in a battle between her talents and her inner self to come up with better songs. On \\"Maa Hobby\\" (With Love) talk show in 2005, host Joumana Bou Eid asked Angham how she felt toward her dad after eight years of collaboration in making records. Angham replied \\"that she owe him many things and that she is lucky he is her father and an important figure in the music industry at the same time\\". The publicity of Angham's separation from her father whether on a personal or artistic level stabilized Angham's independent entrance into the industry of music. Angham with her ex-husband Fahd at the Kuwait international airport in 2005 for a short visit to Fahd's family Angham only attended high school. Upon its completion, Angham moved to Cairo's Conservatory of Music. She studied the basics of the music, improved her voice's capacities, and learned how to play on the traditional piano and Oud. However, Angham fell into a nervous breakdown when she received news about her uncle's death which happened on the same day of her first tour in Tunisia at the Carthage International Festival. Months before \\"Bet'heb Meen\\" (Who Do You love) record's release in 1999, Angham married Magdy Aref, an Egyptian businessman and music video director, from whom she gave birth to a boy named Omar. Angham's father was strongly against his daughter's choice of husband, but the artist married Magdy without her father's approval. In 2000, their divorce caused a riot in the press who criticized Angham's lack of experience in managing to keep her records unaffected by her private life. They added that she was too young for a step like it. Angham remained a single mom for four years before she finally met music arrangist Fahd and became romantically involved during the making of her 2003 record Omry Maak. In April 2004, they were married in a huge ceremony on \\"The Place\\" yacht in 2004. Their love relationship was built over many years and they were spotted together on many occasions. In 2003, the press rumored that Angham married him secretly. Likewise, her publicly viewed marriage ended this rumour. Among the invitees present at the wedding were artists Elissa, Sherine, Mohamed Hamaki, Khaled Agag, Sheriff Makkawy, and Ehab Toufic. Rotana Records company's president, Salem elHindy, and his spokesperson, Tony Semaan, attended the wedding. Angham's father and son, Omar, chose not to attend her wedding. In December 2005, Angham gave birth to Abdel Rahman. However, the marriage did not last long and Angham divorced Fahd in June 2008. 1987‚Äì1994: Debut with her father Released in 1987, Fil Rokn elBaeed elHady (In The Far Distant Corner) is Angham's first breakaway record. Her father introduced her to Sayed Naser, a businessman and record producer, who agreed on producing and financing her records and tracks. Angham was the first artist to join Sayed Naser Records company, and the youngest to be accepted. Due to her father's wide recognition in the music industry, legend artist Mohammed Abdel Wahab gave Angham the copyright of his track \\"Basbosa\\" (Cute Girl) to remake it in her new debut record. Angham was the first artist from the 1980s to be given a song from a legend artist. This record in question will be featuring the debut of a series of records that are entirely and in some, partially, musically composed by Mohammad Suleiman. Angham's lyricist, Ezzat elGendy, who was behind the success of \\"Sidi Wisalak\\" (Your Charm) in 2001 also saw his debut with Angham on the \\"La Ya elHob\\" (No Love) track. \\"Fil Rokn elBaeed elHady\\" was a pivotal success. The following year, Angham conceived Awal Gawab (The First Answer), her second record, as a homage to Egyptian soul music composer, Sayed Makkawy, and she worked with a variety of lyricists on the record. Sayed Makkawy gave her the copyrights of his song \\"Aalo Enseeh\\" (\\"They Said Forget Him\\") to add it to the record. The Awal Gawab record was released soon after her debut record but was neither critically nor commercially as successful. \\"Awal Gawab\\" and \\"Hawa elMasayef\\" (\\"Summer Love\\") were her most successful tracks on this record. During 1988, although she occasionally performed live, stage fright prevented Angham from embarking on any major tours. Her first widely seen concert appearances were mainly at the Cairo Opera House, and she said she felt that her performance proved her vocal abilities were not, as some had previously speculated, simulated using studio techniques. Four next records which were all produced by Sayed Naser Records except the last one which is produced by \\"Sawt elCahira\\" (Voice of Egypt) Records saw the light. They were a transitional phase of Angham in her adolescent years. Most of the tracks dealt with love, breakup, friendship, family and fun. These albums were titled as \\"LaLiLi Lali\\", \\"Layek\\", \\"Ettafakna\\" and \\"Bibassata Kida\\". The first two were released in the year 1989, the third in 1990 and the fourth in 1991. In 1992, she sang two songs composed by the Saudi composer, Mohammed Al-Senan, which are \\"Shayfak\\" (I See you) and \\"Ain El-Hawa\\" (The Eye of Love). The lyrics of both songs were written by Ezzat elGendy. They were produced by Alkhoyool in 1992, and they were reproduced by production label Rotana in 2002 among the famous collection musical record Mahrajan Nagham Watarab 2002 (Festival of Melodies and Oriental 2002). However, Angham's relationship with her father started to deteriorate when he discovered her intention of separating from him. He felt stress over the public's reprisal of his daughter's as a person and artist. Among the four records, it was the last one that had a phenomenal success. The latter featured the hit \\"Ya Tayeb\\" (Humble Person), which tackled the subject of humanity and stabilized Angham's position as a celebrity, becoming a name as successful as Amr Diab. In 1992, the feud between Angham and her father resulted in her working less with her father to conceive her seventh record, \\"Inta elAlam\\" (\\"You Are The World\\") which was produced by \\"Sawt elCahira\\" (\\"Voice of Egypt\\") Records. The 1993 record Ella Ana (\\"Except Me\\"), produced by Rocky Records, was the best record for Angham between 1987 and 1994. This fact was attributed to the critical and commercial success of such tracks as \\"Telephonak Kam\\" (\\"What's Your Phone Number\\"), \\"Shantet Safar\\" (\\"Luggage of Travel\\") and \\"Ella Ana\\". \\"Shantet Safar\\", alongside \\"Ya Tayeb\\", continues nowadays to be the sole old hit of Angham to survive as intensively as her 2001 hit \\"Sidi Wisalak\\" (\\"Your Charm\\"). 1995‚Äì2000: Search for expansion After her separation from her father, Angham collaborated with music composer, Ameer Abdel Mageed. He worked subsequently on \\"Baollak Eih\\" (Tell You What) record in 1995 and musically composed all its tracks. The record was produced by Laser Records owned by Mustafa Dagher. The track \\"Tekdar Aal Meshwar\\" (\\"Are You Up to the Long Journey\\") was sung in 7.6 octave voice with a rich oriental music background. \\"Law Hasseit\\" which was filmed as a music video is the first track to contain quick Latin/Spanish beats, and perhaps helped Angham gain more popular in the young demographic. The sound engineering was taken care by Ameen Akef, Hussein Aahdy, and Omro Hashem, while the record was co-produced by Angham and Adel Othman Helal. In 1996, under Laser Records' production, Angham's tenth record Akdar (I Can Make It Through) saw the light. It is entirely composed by Ameer Abdel Mageed. The record was released in a second copy featuring the unreleased track \\"elAmar\\" (\\"The Moon\\"). Angham stepped up in the light to show that she can make it through hard times and that she is in the phase of discovering who she is as an artist, far from her father's guidance. She said she is slowly finding her liberty and style, but is not there yet. International composer, Abdo Dagher, also worked with Ameer Abdel Mageed in the construction of the tracks' melodies. Angham started to experiment recording in the Lebanese dialect, but she found out that she did not master it yet. However, she rehearsed for the Gulf dialect and later on, presented her demo track to her friends. The latters were fully convinced with Angham's performance in the Gulf language, a major step and encouragement that enabled Angham to do a Gulf record. In fact, in 1996, \\"Shay Daa\\" (\\"Something Got Lost\\") was her first Gulf record which was produced by Founoun elJazeera (Islands Arts) Records. It was an instant hit in the Persian Gulf region, and the first to open more career occasions for Angham. She was no longer doing concerts in Egypt only, but also in Dubai, Qatar, Kuwait, and UAE, and other places. Angham returned to the spotlight with a very successful record Betheb Meen (\\"Who Do You Love\\") in 1997 where she worked once again with her father, but on only two songs. Upon its release, Angham silenced all rumors about her relationship with father, indicating that even though they had separated on the professional level, the link of father and daughter remained intact. Due to her first Gulf record's success, Angham embraced a second experience at the same level. \\"Khalli Bokra L'Bokra\\" (Keep Tomorrow For the Future) record released in 1998 and produced by Stars Records company was even more successful than the first one. The record contained hits like \\"Haybet Malek\\" (\\"Pride of a King\\"), \\"Ma Had Fady\\" (\\"No One Cares\\"), \\"Eedna Mbarak\\" (\\"Happy Anniversary\\"), and \\"Ghareeb\\" (\\"Strange\\"). In this record, the music of the tracks were mainly composed by Tarek Mohammad, Khaled elSheikh, and Talal Medah. \\"Ghareeb\\" track is only available in its complete version on the CD. The record Wahadaniya (\\"Lonely Woman\\"), released in 1999, produced by Sawt elCahira Records, which took back Angham under its wings after knowing her popularity grew more intense. All the tracks in this records were hits, but the most successful ones were \\"Bet'hebbaha Walla\\" (\\"Do You Love Her Or What\\"), \\"Baatly Nazra\\" (\\"Send Me A Glance\\") and \\"elAlak Had\\" (\\"Find Someone\\"). For the first time before they wed in 2004, Angham worked with Fahd, who co-arranged \\"Wahadaniya\\" (Lonely Woman) track alongside Mika. The song did not receive much acclaim because it was sung in a slang and old Egyptian accent. Angham received \\"Best Female Artist\\" in 2000 for this record. Her music video \\"Bethebbaha Walla\\", featuring Angham in an old and new look which indicated a transition period, received \\"Best Music Video\\" in 1999. 2001‚Äì2003: New image, independence and liberalism Angham and Magdy Aref separated in 2000. She said she felt trapped by her relationship with Magdy, whom she often described as controlling. Soon after the separation, Angham hired an independent publicist and a new attorney and manager. She became a phenomenal artist during this period, contributing to the inspiration of many artists who are still in the debut of their singing career. Angham's next album, 'Leih Sebtaha' (Why Did You Leave Her) which was produced by Alam El Phan Records company and released in 2001, yielded the number-one single \\"Sidi Wisalak\\" (\\"Your Charm\\"), the lyrics and music video for which presented a more overtly feminine and sensual image of her that had been previously seen. She stated that Leih Sebtaha defined the point that she attained full creative control over her music, which continued to move in a steady direction with material mostly written and composed by Bahaa elDeen Mohammad and Sheriff tagg respectively. However, she added: \\"I never thought it's that much of a departure from what I've done in the past. It's not like I went crazy and thought I was going to be the artist I am now. Personally, this album is about doing whatever I dreamt to do\\". \\"Sidi Wisalak\\", co-written by Angham and her lifetime friend, Ezzat elGendy, was a commercial success. Both \\"Sidi Wisalak\\" and \\"Magabsh Serty\\" (\\"Did He Mention Me\\") tracks boosted the sales and gave her the title of the best selling living Egyptian female artist. \\"Magabsh Serty\\" is the last song that Riyad elHamshari composed for Angham. That same year, she appeared on 3 Sharee elNoujoum (3 Stars Avenue), a televised programme. She was honored officially as \\"Egypt's Number 1 Female Artist\\" in 2001. By the following year, she had entered a relationship with music arranger, Fahd. Omry Maak (\\"My Life With You\\"), Angham's sixteenth studio album, was released in 2003 and produced by the same record company as its precedent. It comprised more R&B;, Rock 'n' Roll and ballad songs, many of them arranged by Fahd. \\"Omry Maak\\" and \\"Arrefha Beya\\" (\\"Introduce Me To Her\\") tracks reached number one in the Middle East, in a time where the industry witnessed the release of unsuccessful records from fellow Arabic artists. Media reception of \\"Omry Maak\\" was in majority enthusiastic, with the Riyad Newspaper saying the album is like \\"a state of euphoric love between the loss of human senses and the phenomena of passion in its ultimate summit\\". Omry Maak was Angham's third best selling record in her career. She accused Alam El Phan of under-promoting the record: \\"The current situation that I am living in my professional career is not positive. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. I wanted to be free from Alam El Phan\\", she replied upon the news of her separation from Alam El Phan, adding that the owner of her company refused to let her film Arrefha Beya as her second music video. There were many promises that he did not accomplish. In 2004, Angham released \\"Khaleeny Maak\\" (\\"Keep Me With You\\") single on St Valentine's Day. It was broadcast on the radio and later on released on the Internet. The track features Fahd's first singing attempt alongside the artist. 2004‚Äì2006: Personal and professional struggles Angham's popularity declined with the release of Bahibbik Wahashteeny (\\"I Love You, I Miss You\\") record in July 2005. After \\"ÿ®ÿ™ÿ≠ÿ® ŸÖŸäŸÜ\\" (Who Do You Love), Angham returned to another collaboration with Rotana Records company to produce and promote the 2005 record. She officially joined the record label in March 2004. Angham's new marriage to Fahd topped with her constant exhaustion, second pregnancy and an operation for a kidney stone prior to giving birth made it impossible for the artist to focus on the record. The lead track, \\"Bahibbik Wahashteeny\\", got good reviews, and its music video, directed by Hady elBajoury, was filmed in September 2005. In the video, Angham displayed her real pregnancy in the clip while her ex-husband appeared on the clip too briefly at the end. However, due to late production and release of the music video, the audience was unaware of the record's release in the market. Angham tried to boost the sales of the record by filming \\"ÿ®ÿ≠ÿ® ŸÜŸÅÿ≥Ÿä\\" (\\"I Love Myself\\") track as her second music video, but it brought a moderate boost to the overall sales. She began a long series of tours to help promote the record. Two days after the release of the record, she performed a successful concert in Tunisia at the Carthage International Concert alongside artist Ramy Ayash. She participated in the fourth season of Star Academy, appeared on the Maa Hobby (With Love) and \\"ÿÆŸÑŸäŸÉ ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ®Ÿäÿ™\\"(Stay Home) talk show], and \\"Saat Samee\\" (\\"An Hour of Hearing\\") on Noujoum FM radio. Angham performed at \\"ŸáŸÑÿß ŸÅÿ®ÿ±ÿßŸäÿ±\\" (\\"Welcome February\\") concert at Kuwait, alongside artist Saber elRibai, Khaled Slim and Hamoud elNaser. Angham then won \\"ÿµŸàÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ®\\" (\\"Voice Of Love\\") Award in 2006 at the Alexandria National Music Festival in its fourth round. Despite the promotion, the record became the artist's commercially least successful record in her career. 2007‚Äì2008: Return to stardom Angham's eighteenth studio album, Kolma N'arrab (Whenever We Come Closer), was released in 2007 and contained contributions from music composers such as Khaled Ezz, Tamer Ali, Ramy Gamal, Baleegh Hamdy and Sheriff Tagg. After criticisms that Angham is over-using her ex-husband to rearrange the tracks in \\"Omry Maak\\" and \\"Bahibbik Wahashteeny\\" (\\"I Love You, I Miss You\\") records, Angham collaborated with a variety of music arrangers. They include: Fahd, Tarek Madkour, Walid Fayad, Ashraf Mahrous, Tamim and Essam elSharayty. The record features a remake of \\"Ashky Lmeen\\" (Who Can I Complain To) as a tribute to Mohamed Mounir. Angham is the first female artist to include a remake in her record for a living artist. Kolma N'arrab became the best-selling record for a female artist in the Middle East in 2007. A reviewer for Almotamar (The Conference) concluded that Angham is the best-selling female artist during summer 2007, beating sales of Lebanese artists Nancy Ajram and Najwa Karam. The record earned Angham a platinum certification. Her music video, which cost US$500,000. and was directed by Ahmad elMahdy, peaked on rank one at Rotana Top 20 chart on 25 August 2007. \\"Dah Elly Indi Track\\" peaked at rank two at Radio Orient chart in France, while \\"Kolma N'arrab\\" track peaked on rank one on 6 August 2007, at \\"Eftekasat Top 10 Songs of the Week\\" chart. Angham won Best Egyptian Female Artist award in 2007 officially given to her by the Nile Entertainment channel. Angham began a series of televised appearances to promote her record. She appeared on X-Factor at Rotana, \\"Nejm elNoujoum\\" (Star of the Stars) in Kuwait, Studio 2M in Morocco and \\"Maa Hobbi\\" (\\"With Love\\") in Lebanon. She debuted her first tour with a successful performance in Cairo at the \\"Layali elTelevision\\" (Nights of the Television) concert on 14 July 2007, which took part at the Chinese Garden, amid a young demographic which surpassed 3000 in number. Kolma N'arrab has been nominated for Best Selling Record at the World Music Award 2007 alongside Amr Diab and Nancy Ajram. On 3 February 2008, she appeared for the second time on Taratata to honour Egyptian artist, Mohammad Mounir, alongside artists Zein elOmar, Hussein and Houda Haddad. She took part with Syrian singer Asala in the first live airing of \\"elArrab\\" (The Mentor) show in its first cycle, hosted by Nichan Deirharotonian. The artist recorded an episode for \\"Inta Meen\\" (\\"Who Are You\\") programme, hosted by Nadine Fallah on Abou Dhabi Channel. Angham was invited to the \\"10th Hour\\" show on Dream channel on the second January 2008. According to Elaph E-newspaper, Angham will continue her tour and her third concert around the Middle East is due to take place at the Doha's 9th Music Festival, where she will be closing the event alongside Gulf legend artist Mohammad Abdo on 29 January 2008. The concert was a phenomenal success and tabloids acclaimed Angham for her appearance. Angham's second single from the 2005 record, \\"Mabataallemsh\\" (Never Learning), was filmed as a music video under the directing of Ahmed elMahdy. The music video peaked number 1 in Rotana for three consecutive weeks, and ranked number 2 in Nadine, a Lebanese magazine. 2009: Nefsy Ahebak For two years, Angham had been working on her nineteenth studio record. The album contains contributions from lyricists Amir Teaima, Bahaa elDin Mohammed, and Mohammad Atef, composers Khaled Ezz, Mohammed Nadi, Tarek Madkour, Walid Saad, Ammar elShareei, and Mohammed Yahiya, arrangists Nader Hamdi, Issam Shrayti, Hassan elShafiei as a substitute of Fahd, and Khaled Ezz. In an interview in Kelmet elFassel\\" (Last Word), she revealed that she would be singing for the first time a Lebanese song written by Catherine Moawwad and composed by Salim Assaf. According to FilFan, the tracks' names are the following: * \\"Yah, Law Ayeesh Maak\\" (I Wish I can Live With You) * \\"Habibi Malak\\" (Darling, what is up) * \\"Nefsi Ahebak\\" (I wish I love you) * \\"Saat Keteer\\" (Many times) * \\"Delwa'ty Ahsan\\" (Now, I am better) * \\"Mahzouma\\" (Defeated) * \\"Fi Wahda Bethebak\\" (Some girl loves you) * \\"Esht Sneen\\" (For Years I've Lived) * \\"Law Nsarah Baad\\" (If We Were Honest to Each Others) * \\"Day Einak\\" (The sparkle of your eye) * \\"Mosh Fi Balak\\" (Not In Your Mind) * \\"Helwa\\" (Beautiful) The album was released on 25 June 2009. For the album, Angham recorded \\"Mahzouma\\" (Defeated) in Prague with the Philharmonic Orchestra of Prague under the direction of Issam Shrayti, for a cost of $50,000 US, becoming the first female artist to have the most expensive song in the Middle East. As for the music video, Angham's choice of directors was restricted down to either Lebanese director, Nadine Labaki, or Egyptian movie director, Khaled Merghi, who collaborated with her previously in 1999 with the video for \\"Bethebbaha Walla\\" (Do You Love Her Or What). The album was well received by critics and fans. Angham shot the video clip \\"Saat Keteer\\" under the direction of Randa Alam. This was the last album in the contract between Angham and Rotana as the former refused to renew the contract. Acting career Angham began to take professional acting lessons in 2000. She made her debut as an actress in the romantic comedy Leila Men Alf Leila (Night of a Thousand Nights) starring prominent actor Yehia elFakharany, actor/artist Ali elHajjar, Sleem Sahab band, and the Cairo Opera House ballet. It was produced by the Cairo Opera House in Egypt. Angham's first acting project was huge, but did not continue for more than two months, and was not aired on television. Angham's second acting experience was with Ali elHajjar again in the theatrical drama Rossassa fil Alb (Bullet Right in the Heart). The plot was written by Toufic Hakeem and was originally intended for theatre before it was transformed in the 1940s into a movie which starred actor/artist Mohammed Abdel Wahab and actress Rakiya Ibrahim. Angham loved both experiences, but said to Middle East Newspaper: > I benefited from these two experiences a lot, but standing on the stage is a > very tiring job, which forces the artist to leave lots of other things > including his personal and professional life as a singer to be able to fully > focus on it. This was the sole point that I did not like in the acting > experience. Rossassa fil Alb is Angham's most successful acting experience, and many movie offers came later for her. However, she did not accept them because she wanted to focus on her singing career. Among the offers she refused were Sahar elLayali (Sleepless Nights) which was nominated for Best Foreign Movie at the Academy Awards in 2003, in which the singer was supposed to act instead of actress Mona Zaki, Shiqet Maser elJadida (Heliopolis Apartment)], Aan elAshk Wel Hawa (About Love and Passion)] elShoumouaa elSawdaa (Black Candles)] where she was supposedly to remake the acting part of legend actress/artist Najat elSagheera, and Hayat Thekra (Life of Thekra) where Angham was supposedly to remake the life of assassinated Tunisian singer, Thekra. Artistry=Voice Angham has said that from childhood she was influenced by Arabic classics and soul musicians such as Mohammed Abdel Wahab, Fairuz and Umm Kulthum. Her music contains strong influences of gospel urban contemporary music, Arabic classics, R&B;, waltz and lately reggaeton. Angham is said to be able to cover all the notes from alto vocal range to six-octave vocal range. In her early years, she attempted to emulate Fairuz's simple notes, to ensure an efficient way of communication emotions. In Maa Hobby (With Love) talk show, Angham said that \\"singing in a low voice is far much more difficult than screaming in high pitch notes. There are not so many artists today that are capable of doing so.\\" Angham's vocal trademark is her ability to sing in the whistle register and to transfer true emotions through her songs.

An apple crumble is a dessert of baked chopped apples topped with rolled oats and brown sugar. In the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, the term 'crumble' refers to both desserts, but in the US and Canada the two are distinguished.Ezinearticles.com Jason McDonald, December 29 2008; CanadianLiving, July 6, 2015; Puddings and Pies, Barbara J. Grunes, 1991, , pp. 136-137 Ingredients usually include cooked apples, butter, sugar, flour, cinnamon, and often oats and brown sugar, ginger, and/or nutmeg. One of the most common variants is apple rhubarb crisp, in which the rhubarb provides a tart contrast to the apples. Many other kinds of fruit crisps are made. These may substitute other fruits, such as peaches, berries, or pears, for the apples. History Apple crisp is a relatively modern dish. It is notably absent from the first edition of the Fannie Farmer Cookbook (1896), which is a comprehensive collection of American recipes. The earliest reference to apple crisp in print occurs in 1924, with a recipe in the Everybody's Cook Book: A Comprehensive Manual of Home Cookery, Isabel Ely Lord [Harcout Brace and Company: New York] 1924 (p. 239). In 1924, apple crisp also makes an appearance in a newspaper article in the Appleton Post Crescent on Tuesday, December 9, 1924 (Appleton, Wisconsin). Its popularity further spread during World War II, when food rationing limited access to pastry ingredients used for making apple pies. Despite its relatively recent invention, apple crisp or crumble has become an American and British tradition especially during the autumn, when apples are plentiful. The dish is also very popular in Canada, especially in areas where berries and fruit are readily available. Variations of this dish are much older. For example, a recipe for apple pandowdy is in Miss Corson's Practical American Cookery, 1886. Variants An apple crisp dessert There are a number of desserts that employ apples with sweet toppings, but none of them are the same as apple crisp, making them not so much variants, but instead other related apple desserts. Apple Brown Betty (or apple pudding) consists of alternating layers of apples and sweetened buttered bread crumbs or crackers, often with a sauce. Apple cobbler (also known as apple slump, apple grunt, and apple pandowdy) is an old recipe in which the baked apples are topped with a cobbler crust formed of batter, pie crust or baking powder biscuit dough. The topping may be dropped onto the top of the apples in clumps, which have a 'cobbled' appearance, thus the name. Apple pan dowdy most commonly features a pie crust, which is broken (\\"dowdied\\") before serving: it is a pie, not a cobbler. A 'grunt' is a cobbler cooked on top of the stove and a 'slump' is fruit and biscuit dumplings which is turned upside down after being baked so that the fruit is slumped into the fruit with a fork.Grunes, p. 134 Apple crumble is a British pudding similar to the apple crisp that originated during World War II food rationing. The crumble topping is made of butter, flour, and brown sugar rolled together so that it resembles breadcrumbs. Care must be taken to balance the correct amount of crumble with the fruit, or else the filling may seep through and spoil this crust. Crumble is traditionally served with custard, but today it is sometimes served with cream or ice cream. Finally, Eve's pudding is a British dessert that is essentially a sponge cake on top of the apples. The name may originate from the biblical reference to Eve and the apple in the Garden of Eden.

They are a common type of speleothem.  Appearance  Cave popcorn trays The individual nodules of cave popcorn range in size from 5 to 20 mm and may be decorated by other speleothems, especially aragonite needles or frostwork. The nodules tend to grow in clusters on bedrock or the sides of other speleothems. These clusters may terminate suddenly in either an upward or downward direction, forming a stratographic layer. When they terminate in a downward direction, they may appear as flat bottomed formations known as trays. Individual nodes of popcorn can assume a variety of shapes from round to flattened ear or button like shapes. The color of cave popcorn is usually white, but various other colors are possible depending on the composition. Formation Button cave popcorn Cave popcorn can form by precipitation. Water seeping through limestone walls or splashing onto them leaves deposits when CO2 loss causes its minerals to precipitate. When formed in this way, the resultant nodules have the characteristics of small balls of flowstone. Cave popcorn can also form by evaporation in which case it is chalky and white like edible popcorn. In the right conditions, evaporative cave popcorn may grow on the windward side of the surface to which it is attached or appear on the edges of projecting surfaces. Alisadr Cave, Hamedan, Iran On manmade structures (outside the cave environment) Popcorn can also occur on concrete structures outside the cave environment; these are classified as calthemite coralloids. Calthemite coralloids also occur in \\"artificial caves\\" such as mines or railway or vehicle tunnels were there is a source of lime, mortar or cement from which the calcium ions can be leached. Coralloids can form by a number of different methods in caves; however, the most common form on concrete is created when a hyperalkaline solution seeps from fine cracks. Due to solution evaporation, deposition of calcium carbonate occurs before any drop can form. The resulting coralloids are small and chalky with a cauliflower appearance.

The anhydrous compound with the formula CrCl3 is a violet solid. The most common form of the trichloride is the dark green hexahydrate, CrCl3. Chromium chlorides find use as catalysts and as precursors to dyes for wool. Structure Anhydrous chromium(III) chloride adopts the YCl3 structure, with Cr3+ occupying one third of the octahedral interstices in alternating layers of a pseudo-cubic close packed lattice of Cl‚àí ions. The absence of cations in alternate layers leads to weak bonding between adjacent layers. For this reason, crystals of CrCl3 cleave easily along the planes between layers, which results in the flaky (micaceous) appearance of samples of chromium(III) chloride.A. F. Wells, 'Structural Inorganic Chemistry, 5th ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK, 1984.

The different forms exist both as solids, and in aqueous solutions. Several members are known of the series of [CrCl3‚àín(H2O)n]z+. The main hexahydrate can be more precisely described as [CrCl2(H2O)4]Cl. It consists of the cation trans-[CrCl2(H2O)4]+ and additional molecules of water and a chloride anion in the lattice.Ian G. Dance, Hans C. Freeman \\"The Crystal Structure of Dichlorotetraaquochromium(III) Chloride Dihydrate: Primary and Secondary Metal Ion Hydration\\" Inorganic Chemistry 1965, volume 4, 1555‚Äì1561. Two other hydrates are known, pale green [CrCl(H2O)5]Cl2 and violet [Cr(H2O)6]Cl3. Similar behaviour occurs with other chromium(III) compounds. Preparation Anhydrous chromium(III) chloride may be prepared by chlorination of chromium metal directly, or indirectly by carbothermic chlorination of chromium(III) oxide at 650‚Äì800 ¬∞CD.

Reactions Slow reaction rates are common with chromium(III) complexes. The low reactivity of the d3 Cr3+ ion can be explained using crystal field theory. One way of opening CrCl3 up to substitution in solution is to reduce even a trace amount to CrCl2, for example using zinc in hydrochloric acid. This chromium(II) compound undergoes substitution easily, and it can exchange electrons with CrCl3 via a chloride bridge, allowing all of the CrCl3 to react quickly. With the presence of some chromium(II), however, solid CrCl3 dissolves rapidly in water. Similarly, ligand substitution reactions of solutions of [CrCl2(H2O)4]+ are accelerated by chromium(II) catalysts. With molten alkali metal chlorides such as potassium chloride, CrCl3 gives salts of the type M3CrCl6 and K3Cr2Cl9, which is also octahedral but where the two chromiums are linked via three chloride bridges. Complexes with organic ligands CrCl3 is a Lewis acid, classified as \\"hard\\" according to the Hard-Soft Acid-Base theory. It forms a variety of adducts of the type [CrCl3L3]z, where L is a Lewis base. For example, it reacts with pyridine () to form an adduct: :CrCl3 \\\\+ 3 C5H5N ‚Üí CrCl3(C5H5N)3 Treatment with trimethylsilylchloride in THF gives the anhydrous THF complex:Philip Boudjouk, Jeung-Ho So \\"Solvated and Unsolvated Anhydrous Metal Chlorides from Metal Chloride Hydrates\\" Inorganic Syntheses, 2007, vol. 29, p. 108-111. :CrCl3.(H2O)6 \\\\+ 12 (CH3)3SiCl + 3 THF ‚Üí CrCl3(THF)3 \\\\+ 6 ((CH3)3Si)2O + 12 HCl Precursor to organochromium complexes Chromium(III) chloride is used as the precursor to many organochromium compounds, for example bis(benzene)chromium, an analogue of ferrocene: :400px Phosphine complexes derived from CrCl3 catalyse the trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene.John T.

Use in organic synthesis One niche use of CrCl3 in organic synthesis is for the in situ preparation of chromium(II) chloride, a reagent for the reduction of alkyl halides and for the synthesis of (E)-alkenyl halides. The reaction is usually performed using two moles of CrCl3 per mole of lithium aluminium hydride, although if aqueous acidic conditions are appropriate zinc and hydrochloric acid may be sufficient. :500px Chromium(III) chloride has also been used as a Lewis acid in organic reactions, for example to catalyse the nitroso Diels- Alder reaction. Dyestuffs A number of chromium-containing dyes are used commercially for wool. Typical dyes are triarylmethanes consisting of ortho- hydroxylbenzoic acid derivatives.Thomas Gessner and Udo Mayer \\"Triarylmethane and Diarylmethane Dyes\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.

He studied classics and mathematics at Oriel College, Oxford, where he was elected president of the Oxford Union. He graduated BA in 1830, MA in 1833, in the meantime enrolling as a student at Lincoln's Inn. During his time in Oxford he had received tuition from John Henry Newman, through whose influence he not only became attached to the Tractarian movement, but abandoned his plan to study for the bar, and instead took orders as an Anglican clergyman. Wilberforce served the Anglican church from 1834 (also the year of his marriage) until 1850, first as curate of Bransgrove (Bransgore), Hampshire (1834), then as vicar of Walmer (1841), and finally as vicar of East Farleigh, Kent (1843). In 1850 he followed his wife, Mary Sargent, daughter of John Sargent, into the Catholic Church. Upon his conversion, he wrote Reasons for Submitting to the Catholic Church: a Farewell Letter to his Parishioners (1851). The Catholic Defence Association was founded in Ireland the same year, and in 1852 Wilberforce became Secretary, living in Ireland for two or three years. As Secretary of the Catholic Defence Association he engaged in a correspondence on Church of Ireland proselytizing which was published as Proselytism in Ireland: the Catholic Defence Association versus the Irish Church Missions on the charge of bribery and intimidation; a correspondence between the Rev. Alex Dallas and the Rev. Henry Wilberforce (1852). In 1854 he became owner and editor of the Catholic Standard, changing the name to the Weekly Register the following year. In 1864, finding the pace of weekly editorial responsibility too demanding, he sold the Weekly Register and embarked on a more leisurely production of articles and reviews for the Dublin Review. After his death a selection of these was published as The Church and the Empires (1874), with a biographical preface by Cardinal Newman. He died in Stroud, Gloucestershire, on 23 April 1873.

Among toddlers, comfort objects may take the form of a blanket, a stuffed animal, or a favorite toy, and may be referred to by nicknames.  In child psychology  Legend: (a) mother, (b) child, (1) illusion, (2) transitional object In human childhood development, the term transitional object is normally used. It is something, usually a physical object, which takes the place of the mother-child bond. Common examples include dolls, teddy bears or blankets. Donald Woods Winnicott introduced the concepts of \\"transitional objects\\" and \\"transitional experience\\" in reference to a particular developmental sequence. With \\"transition\\" Winnicott means an intermediate developmental phase between the psychic and external reality. In this \\"transitional space\\" we can find the \\"transitional object\\". When the young child begins to separate the \\"me\\" from the \\"not-me\\" and evolves from complete dependence to a stage of relative independence, it uses transitional objects. Infants see themselves and the mother as a whole. In this phase the mother \\"brings the world\\" to the infant without delay which gives it a \\"moment of illusion\\", a belief that its own wish creates the object of its desire which brings with it a sense of satisfaction. Winnicott calls this subjective omnipotence. Alongside the subjective omnipotence of a child lies an objective reality, which constitutes the child's awareness of separateness between itself and desired objects. While the subjective omnipotence experience is one in which the child feels that its desires create satisfaction, the objective reality experience is one in which the child independently seeks out objects of desire. Later on the child comes to realize that the mother is a separate entity, which tells the child that they have lost something. The child realizes that they are dependent on others, thus losing the idea that they are independent. This realization creates a difficult period and brings frustration and anxiety with it. The mother cannot always be there to \\"bring the world\\" to the baby, a realization which has a powerful, somewhat painful, but ultimately constructive impact on the child. Through fantasizing about the object of its wishes the child will find comfort. A transitional object can be used in this process. The transitional object is often the first \\"not me\\" possession that really belongs to the child. This could be a real object like a blanket or a teddy bear, but other \\"objects\\", such as a melody or a word, can fulfill this role as well. This object represents all components of \\"mothering\\", and it means that the child itself is able to create what it needs as well. It enables the child to have a fantasized bond with the mother when she gradually separates for increasingly longer periods of time. The transitional object is important at the time of going to sleep and as a defence against anxiety. In a later stage of the development the child no longer needs the transitional object. It is able to make a distinction between \\"me\\" and \\"not-me\\", and keeping inside and outside apart and yet interrelated. This development leads to the use of illusion, symbols and objects later on in life. Winnicott related the concept of transitional object to a more general one, transitional phenomena, which he considered to be the basis of science, religion and all of culture. Transitional objects and phenomena, he said, are neither subjective nor objective but partake of both. In Mental Space, Robert Young has provided an exposition of these concepts and has generalized their role into psychic phenomena in adult life.Young, R. M. (1994). Mental Space. London: Process Press. ch. 8Young, R. M. (1989). \\"Transitional phenomena: production and consumption\\", in B. Richards, ed., Crises of the Self: Further Essays on Psychoanalysis and Politics. London: Free Association Books, pp. 57‚Äì72. Research with children on this subject was performed at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee by Richard H. Passman and his associates. Among other findings, they showed that security blankets are appropriately named ‚Äì they actually do give security to those children attached to them. Along with other positive benefits, having a security blanket available can help children adapt to new situations, aid in their learning, and adjust to physicians' and clinical psychologists' evaluations. Passman's research also points out that there is nothing abnormal about being attached to them. In the United States, about 60% of children have at least some attachment to a security object.  Therapeutic use  Emergency vehicles and police patrol cars are sometimes equipped with stuffed toys, to be given to victims involved in car accidents or traumatic shock situations in order to provide them comfort. Often charities will provide comfort objects such as blankets and quilts to survivors of disasters. After the September 11 attacks, writes Marita Sturken in Tourists of History, \\"the Oklahoma City National Memorial sent six hundred teddy bears and then the state of Oklahoma sent sixty thousand stuffed animals to New York, which were distributed to children in schools affected by 9/11, family support organizations, and New York fire stations.\\"The recent history of such comfort objects, particularly teddy bears, as well a critique of their comfort-providing function can be found in Marita Sturken, Tourists of History: Memory, Kitsch, and Consumption from Oklahoma City to Ground Zero (Durham: Duke University Press, 2007), here p. 7. Weighted blankets A weighted blanket, also known as a gravity blanket, is a blanket filled with heavy pellets. Weighted blankets have been claimed to reduce anxiety and therefore allow the wearer to fall asleep more quickly. Weighted blankets have been used in an attempt to help improve sleep quality, particularly for children with autism spectrum disorder. However there is no good evidence to support this use and the use of weighted blankets carries a risk of harm, having in one case been responsible for a child's death.  Use by adults  Adults may also use comfort objects. Many adults consider the comfort that security blankets provide as essential to their mental and emotional well- being.Do You Still Have a Security Blanket? Dr. John Grohol, PsychCentral, 13 October 2010 Additionally, according to a 2011 survey by Travelodge, about 35 percent of British adults sleep with a teddy bear.35 percent of British adults sleep with bear United Press International, 21 February 2012 Inventor Richard Kopelle created My Therapy Buddy (MTB), sometimes shortened to just Therapy Buddy, in 2002 as a self-described transitional object to benefit \\"one's emotional well-being\\". The blue creature speaks to you when you squeeze it and says any of a number of longer phrases that include the phrase \\"everything is going to be alright\\". The invention was rejected in the first season of American Inventor, but went on to become a semi-finalist in the second season. My Therapy Buddy also appeared on Shark Tank but did not receive any offers. A smaller form, Baby My Therapy Buddy or just Baby Buddy, was offered at a lower price. no more buddies were being produced. In a 2008 study, the Sony AIBO robotic pet was found to decrease loneliness in the elderly in nursing homes. The notion of a \\"comfort object\\" may be expanded to include representations of one's family, home, and culture. It is significant to the person and gives psychological strength and assistance by representing their emotional attachments. These objects can include photographs, memorabilia, music records, and even artwork made with family members. With the increase in movement away from home, and sometimes constant movement from one place to another for job opportunities or immigration, it is very common for people to carry these items with them. People may look to these objects for emotional support during transitional periods, such as assimilating to a new area, or when experiencing trauma or a significant loss.  Cross-cultural uses  Researchers have observed that the incidence of attachment behavior toward inanimate objects differs depending on the culture in which the infant was raised. It is suggested that infants' attachment to inanimate objects would be less frequent in societies in which in an infant may spend most of the day in close contact with his mother. In particular, in Western countries object attachments were indeed found to be common, with rates reaching as high as 60%. In a study conducted by Michael Hong, it was found that around 50% of American children and only around 20% of Korean children developed an attachment to a blanket or an equivalent type of primary transitional objects. A similar study by Renata Gaddini found that around 30% of urban Italian children and only 5% of rural Italian children developed attachments to comfort objects. The interpretation of multiple studies suggests that child- rearing practices influence both the incidence of infants' attachment to inanimate objects and perhaps the choice of attachment objects.  In popular culture  The term security blanket was popularized in the Peanuts comic strip created by Charles M. Schulz, who gave such a blanket to his character Linus van Pelt. Linus called it his \\"security and happiness blanket\\", in Good Grief, More Peanuts printed in 1956. However, the concept of a comfort blanket existed prior to Peanuts. In a November 1954 Review Report article, writer \\"Bev\\" wrote about her daughter: \\"Security blanket. My younger child is one year old. When she finds a fuzzy blanket or a fleecy coat she presses her cheek against it and sucks her thumb.\\" Since 1920, blankets which clipped onto sleeping infants to prevent them from rolling out of bed and keep the body covered were dubbed \\"security blanket fasteners\\". In the film The Producers, Leo Bloom is prone to panic attacks and to keep himself calm, he carries a fragment of his childhood blue blanket everywhere he goes and goes into hysterics when someone takes it from him until they give it back to him. In the German version of Sesame Street, Sesamstra√üe, one of the main characters, a big brown bear named Samson, is very fond of the smell of his security blanket which he calls 'Schnuffeltuch' (engl. 'nuzzle cloth'). In the film The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland, Elmo loves his fuzzy, blue Blanket more than anything else, to the point of not wanting to share it, as it is very special to him and setting out on an epic quest to get it back when it is stolen. In the book The Giver, \\"comfort object\\" is used as a term to refer to all stuffed animals. The comfort objects are described as being \\"imaginary creatures with funny names\\" because the dystopian community where the book takes place has no animals.

Italian war crimes have mainly been associated with Fascist Italy in the Pacification of Libya, the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Spanish Civil War, and World War II. Italo-Turkish War In 1911, Italy went to war with the Ottoman Empire and invaded Ottoman Tripolitania. One of the most notorious incidents during this conflict was the October Tripoli massacre, wherein many civilian inhabitants of the Mechiya oasis were killed over a period of three days as retribution for the execution and mutilation of Italian captives taken in an ambush at nearby Sciara Sciat. In 1912, 10,000 Turkish and Arab troops were imprisoned in concentration camps in Libya, all Turkish troops were executed. Pacification of Libya Libyan internees in the El Agheila concentration camp In 1923, Mussolini embarked upon a campaign to consolidate control over the Italian territory of Libya and Italian forces began occupying large areas of Libya to allow for rapid settlement by Italian colonists. They were met with resistance by the Senussi who were led by Omar Mukhtar. Civilians suspected of collaboration with the Senussi were executed. Refugees from the fighting were subject to bombing and strafing by Italian aircraft. In 1930, in northern Cyrenaica, 20,000 Bedouins were relocated and their land was given to Italian settlers. The Bedouins were forced to march across the desert into concentration camps. Starvation and other poor conditions in the camps were rampant and the internees were used for forced labour, ultimately leading to the death of nearly 4,000 internees by the time they were closed in September 1933. Over 80,000 Cyrenaicans died during the Pacification in all. Execution of Omar Mukhtar (16 de September, 1931). Second Italo-Ethiopian War During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Italian violations of the laws of war were reported and documented.Effie G. H.

Google books link Italian authorities claimed that these actions were in response to the Ethiopians' use of Dum-Dum bullets, which had been banned by declaration IV, 3 of the Hague Convention, and mutilation of captured soldiers.League of Nations According to the Ethiopian government, 382,800 civilian deaths were directly attributable to the Italian invasion. 17,800 women and children killed by bombing, 30,000 people were killed in the massacre of February 1937, 35,000 people died in concentration camps, and 300,000 people died of privations due to the destruction of their villages and farms. The Ethiopian government also claimed that the Italians destroyed 2,000 churches and 525,000 houses, while confiscating or slaughtering 6 million cattle, 7 million sheep and goats, and 1.7 million horses, mules, and camels, leading to the latter deaths.Barker, A. J. (1968). The Civilising Mission: The Italo-Ethiopian War 1935‚Äì6. London: Cassell. . Pages 292-293. During the 1936‚Äì1941 Italian occupation, atrocities also occurred; in the February 1937 Yekatit 12 massacres as many as 30,000 Ethiopians may have been killed and many more imprisoned as a reprisal for the attempted assassination of Viceroy Rodolfo Graziani. A 2017 study estimated that 19,200 were killed - a fifth of the population of Addis Ababa. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church was especially singled out. Thousands of Ethiopians also died in concentration camps such as Danane and Nocra. Spanish Civil War 75,000 Italian soldiers of the Corpo Truppe Volontarie fought on the side of the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War, as did 7,000 men of the Aviazione Legionaria. While they also bombed valid military targets such as the railway infrastructure of Xativa, the Italian air force partook in many bombings of civilian targets for the purposes of \\"weakening the morale of the Reds\\". One of the more notable bombings was the Bombing of Barcelona, in which 1,300 civilians were killed, with thousands more being wounded or dehoused.1931-2017., Thomas, Hugh, (2003).

Documents found in British archives by the British historian Effie Pedaliu and documents found in Italian archives by the Italian historian Davide Conti, pointed out that the memory of the existence of the Italian concentration camps and Italian war crimes committed during the Spanish Civil War had been repressed due to the Cold War. World War II The British and American governments, fearful of the post-war Italian Communist Party, effectively undermined the quest for justice by tolerating the efforts made by Italy's top authorities to prevent any of the alleged war criminals from being extradited and taken to court.Italy's bloody secret (Archived by WebCite¬Æ), written by Rory Carroll, Education, The Guardian, June 2001Effie Pedaliu (2004) Britain and the 'Hand-over' of Italian War Criminals to Yugoslavia, 1945‚Äì48.

A typical instruction was issued by the Italian prime minister, Alcide De Gasperi, reading: \\"Try to gain time, avoid answering requests.\\" The denial of Italian war crimes was backed up by the Italian state, academe, and media, re- inventing Italy as only a victim of the German Nazism and the post-war Foibe massacres. A number of suspects, known to be on the list of Italian war criminals that Yugoslavia, Greece and Ethiopia requested an extradition of, at the end of World War II never saw anything like the Nuremberg trial, because with the beginning of the Cold War, the British government saw in Pietro Badoglio, who was also on the list, a guarantee of an anti-communist post-war Italy.Oliva, Gianni (2006) ¬´Si ammazza troppo poco¬ª.

Yugoslavia Italian soldiers shooting Slovenian civilian hostages from the village Dane, Lo≈°ka dolina Prisoner in the Italian concentration camp on Rab, where they interred 15.000 Slovene and Croatian civilians, among them many women and children, and 3.500 civilians are estimated to have died in the camp In April 1941, Italy invaded Yugoslavia, occupying large portions of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Serbia and Macedonia, while directly annexing to Italy the Ljubljana Province, Gorski Kotar and Central Dalmatia, along with most Croatian islands. To suppress the mounting resistance led by the Partisans, the Italians adopted tactics of \\"summary executions, hostage-taking, reprisals, internments and the burning of houses and villages.\\" General Roatta's War against the Partisans in Yugoslavia: 1942, IngentaConnect . In May 1942 Mussolini told Mario Roatta, commander of the Italian 2nd Army, that \\"the best situation is when the enemy is dead. So we must take numerous hostages and shoot them whenever necessary.\\" To implement this Roatta suggested the closure of the Fiume province and Croatia, the evacuation of people in the east of the former frontiers to a distance of 3-4 km inland, the organization of border patrols to kill anyone attempting to cross, the mass internment of \\"twenty to thirty thousand persons\\" to Italian concentration camps, burning down houses, and the confiscation of property from villagers suspected of having contact with Partisans for families of Italian soldiers. He also mentioned the need to extend the plan to Dalmatia and for the construction of concentration camps. Roatta insisted, \\"If necessary don't shy away from using cruelty. It must be a complete cleansing. We need to intern all the inhabitants and put Italian families in their place.\\" =Italian concentration camps= Dead inmates from the Rab concentration camp, one of many Italian concentration camps for civilians from former YugoslaviaIn the Province of Ljubljana, alone, the Italians sent of 25,000 to 40,000 Slovene civilians to concentrations camps, which equaled 7.5% to 12% of its total population. The Italians also sent tens-of-thousands of Croats, Serbs, Montenegrins and others to concentration camps, including many women and children. The operation, one of the most drastic in Europe, filled up many Italian concentration camps, such as Rab, Gonars, Monigo, Renicci di Anghiari, Molat and elsewhere. Among the 10,619 civilians held in October 1942 in just the Rab concentration camp, 3,413 were women and children, with children accounting for 1,422 of the prisoners. Over 3,500 internees died at Rab alone, including at least 163 children listed by name, giving it a mortality rate of 18%.Cresciani, Gianfranco (2004) Clash of civilisations, Italian Historical Society Journal, Vol.12, No.2, p.7 Concentration camp survivors received no compensation from the Italian state after the war. =Mass killings of civilians= In early July 1942, Italian troops operating opposite Fiume, were reported to have shot and killed 800 Croat and Slovene civilians and burned down 20 houses near Split on the Dalmatian coast.Report Italians Execute 800 in Yugoslavia Later that month, the Italian Air Force was reported to have practically destroyed four Yugoslav villages and killed hundreds of civilians in revenge for a local guerrilla attack that resulted in the death of two high-ranking officers.Italians Level Slav Villages In Reprisal In the second week of August 1942, Italian troops were reported to have burned down six Croatian villages and shot dead more than 200 civilians in retaliation for guerrilla attacks.ITALIANS BURN 6 CROAT TOWNS In September 1942, the Italian Army was reported to have destroyed 100 villages in Slovenia and killed 7,000 villagers in reprisal for local guerrilla attacks.Italians Raze 100 Sloven Villages = Other anti-Partisan repressive measures = Italian poster forbidding exit from barbed-wire surrounded Ljubljana On their own, or with their Nazi allies, the occupying Italian army undertook many armed actions, including brutal offensives intended to wipe out Partisan resistance. This included Case White in Bosnia, in which German, Italian and allied quisling forces killed 12,000 Partisans, plus 3,370 civilians, while sending 1,722 civilians to concentration camps. During the Case Black offensive, German, Italian and allied troops killed 7,000 Partisans (two-thirds of the total 22,000 Partisan force were killed or wounded), and executed 2,537 civilians. Italian mass arrests of civilians in Ljubljana in 1942, many of whom were sent to concentration camps or shot as hostages In Ljubljana Province, in July 1941, the Italian army assembled 80,000 well-armed troops to attack 2,500-3,000 poorly armed Partisans, who had liberated large portions of the Province. Italian general Mario Robotti issued commands for all persons caught with arms or false identification papers to be shot on the spot, while most other men of military age were to be sent to concentration camps. All buildings from which shots were fired on Italian troops, or in which ammunition was found, or the owners showed hospitality to Partisans, were to be destroyed. Italian troops were ordered to burn crops, kill livestock and burn villages which supported Partisans. To destroy the resistance, the Italian occupiers also completely surrounded the capital city of Ljubljana with barbed wire, bunkers and control points. Civilians, particularly families of partisans and their supporters, were sent by the tens-of-thousands to Italian concentration camps, and in a meeting in Gorizia in July 1942, between Italian generals and Mussolini, they agreed to forcefully deport all 330,000 inhabitants of Ljubljana Province, if necessary, and replace them with Italians. None of the Italians responsible for the many war crimes against Yugoslavs - including Generals Roatta and Robotti, Fascist Commissar Emilio Grazioli, etc - were ever brought to trial. Greece Italian troops walk among the bodies of Greek civilians executed during the alt= A similar phenomenon took place in Greece in the immediate postwar years. The Italian occupation of Greece was often brutal, resulting in reprisals such as the Domenikon Massacre.P.

Ultimately, the Greek famine led to the deaths of 300,000 Greek civilians.Baranowski, Shelley (2010). Nazi empire: German colonialism and imperialism from Bismarck to Hitler. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 273. . Pope Pius XII, in a contemporary letter, directly blamed the Fascist Italian government for the deaths in addition to the Germans: \\"Axis authorities in Greece are robbing the starving population of their entire harvest of corn, grapes, olives, and currants; even vegetables, fish, milk, and butter are being seized... Italy is the occupying power and Italy is responsible for the proper feeding of the Greek people... after the war the story of Greece will be an indelible blot on the good name of Italy, at any rate Fascist Italy.\\"Margherita, Marchione. \\"Pope Pius XII: Architect for Peace.\\" Paulist Pr, May 2000.

(Archived by WebCite¬Æ) List of Italian war criminals This is a working list of Italian high-ranking military personnel or other officials involved in acts of war. It includes also such personnel of lower rank that were accused of grave breaches of the laws of war. Inclusion of a person does not imply that the person was qualified as a war criminal by a court of justice. As noted in the relevant section, very few cases have been brought to court due to diplomatic activities of, notably, the government of the United Kingdom and subsequent general abolition. The criterion for inclusion in the list is the existence of reliable documented sources. * Benito Mussolini: In 1936, during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Mussolini ordered the manufacturing/purchase of hundreds of tons of yperite, phosgene, and fire munitions in the form of aerial bombs and artillery and mortar shells. * Pietro Badoglio: In 1936, during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Badoglio approved, as commander in chief of the Italian army, the use of poisonous gas against enemy troops. * Rodolfo Graziani: In 1950, a military tribunal sentenced Graziani to prison for a term of 19 years (but released after a few months) as punishment for his collaboration with the Nazis, when he was Minister of Defense of the Italian Social Republic. He was a key figure in the Pacification of Libya and authorized the mass killing of Ethiopians known as Yekatit 12. * Alessandro Pirzio Biroli: The Governor of the Italian governorate of Montenegro, he ordered that fifty Montenegrin civilians be executed for every Italian killed, and ten be executed for every Italian wounded. * Mario Roatta: In 1941‚Äì1943, during the 22-month existence of the Province of Ljubljana, Roatta ordered the deportation of 25,000 people, which equaled 7.5% of the total population. The operation, one of the most drastic in Europe, filled up Italian concentration camps on the island of Rab, in Gonars, Monigo (Treviso), Renicci d'Anghiari, Chiesanuova and elsewhere. The survivors received no compensation from the Italian state after the war. He had, as the commander of the 2nd Italian Army in Province of Ljubljana, ordered besides internments also summary executions, hostage-taking, and burning of houses and villages,Giuseppe Piemontese (1946).Twenty-nine months of Italian occupation of the Province of Ljubljana, page 10.James H. Burgwyn (2004). General Roatta's war against the partisans in Yugoslavia: 1942, Journal of Modern Italian Studies, Volume 9, Number 3, pp. 314‚Äì329(16) for which after the war the Yugoslav government sought unsuccessfully to have him extradited for war crimes. He was quoted as saying \\"Non dente per dente, ma testa per dente\\" (\\"Not a tooth for tooth but a head for a tooth\\"), while Robotti was quoted as saying \\"Non si ammazza abbastanza!\\" (\\"There are not enough killings\\") in 1942.Gianni, Oliva (2007) \\"Si ammazza troppo poco\\". I crimini di guerra italiani 1940‚Äì1943, Mondadori. \\"On 1 March 1942, he (Roatta) circulated a pamphlet entitled '3C' among his commanders that spelled out military reform and draconian measures to intimidate the Slav populations into silence by means of summary executions, hostage-taking, reprisals, internments and the burning of houses and villages. By his reckoning, military necessity knew no choice, and law required only lip service. Roatta's merciless suppression of partisan insurgency was not mitigated by his having saved the lives of both Serbs and Jews from the persecution of Italy's allies Germany and Croatia. Under his watch, the 2nd Army's record of violence against the Yugoslav population easily matched the German. Tantamount to a declaration of war on civilians, Roatta's '3C' pamphlet involved him in war crimes.\\" One of Roatta's soldiers wrote home on July 1, 1942: \\"We have destroyed everything from top to bottom without sparing the innocent. We kill entire families every night, beating them to death or shooting them.\\"James Walston, a historian at The American University of Rome. Quoted in Rory, Carroll. Italy's bloody secret. The Guardian. (Archived by WebCite¬Æ), The Guardian, London, UK, June 25, 2003 As noted by Minister of Foreign Affairs in Mussolini government, Galeazzo Ciano, when describing a meeting with secretary general of the Fascist party who wanted Italian army to kill all Slovenes: * Mario Robotti, Commander of the Italian 11th Division in Slovenia and Croatia, issued an order in line with a directive received from Mussolini in June 1942: \\"I would not be opposed to all (sic) Slovenes being imprisoned and replaced by Italians. In other words, we should take steps to ensure that political and ethnic frontiers coincide.\\",Tommaso Di Francesco, Giacomo Scotti (1999) Sixty years of ethnic cleansing, Le Monde Diplomatique, May Issue. which qualifies as ethnic cleansing policy. * Nicola Bellomo was an Italian general who was tried and found guilty for killing a British prisoner of war and wounding another in 1941. He was one of the few Italians to be executed for war crimes by the Allies, and the only one executed by a British-controlled court. * Italo Simonitti, a captain in the Italian Social Republic's 4th Monterosa Alpine division, was executed for his involvement in the 1945 execution of an American prisoner. * Pietro Caruso was chief of the Fascist police in Rome while it was occupied by the Germans. He helped organize the Ardeatine massacre in March 1944. After Rome was liberated by the Allies he was tried that September and subsequently executed by the co-belligerent Italian government. * Guido Buffarini Guidi was the Minister of the Interior for the Italian Social Republic; shortly after the end of the war in Europe he was found guilty of war crimes and executed by the co-belligerent government. * Pietro Koch was head of the Banda Koch, a special task force of the Corpo di Polizia Repubblicana dedicated to hunting down partisans and rounding up deportees. His ruthless extremism was cause for concern even to his fellow fascists, who had him arrested in October 1944. When he came into Allied captivity he was convicted of war crimes and executed.

The name \\"ABLA\\" was an acronym for four different housing developments that together constituted one large site: the Jane Addams Homes, Robert Brooks Homes (including the Robert Brooks Extension), Loomis Courts, and the Grace Abbott Homes, totaling 3,596 units. It spanned from Cabrini Street on the north end to 15th Street on the south end, and from Blue Island Avenue on the east end to Ashland Avenue on the west end. Most of the ABLA Homes has been demolished for the development of Roosevelt Square, a new mixed-income community, with the renovated Brooks Homes being the only part left. For most of its existence, the ABLAs held more than 17,000 residents (though only 8,500 were officially on the lease), giving it the second largest population in the CHA. It was second only to the Robert Taylor Homes and Cabrini‚ÄìGreen in land area and had a higher occupancy than Cabrini‚ÄìGreen. History=Jane Addams and Grace Abbott Homes The Jane Addams Homes (one of the first three public housing projects in Chicago) consisted of 32 buildings of 2, 3, and 4 stories (987 units) built in 1938 by Franklin D. Roosevelt's PWA Program. They housed hundreds of families over several decades until they were vacated in 2002. They were famous for their animal sculptures in the court area. The buildings have largely been demolished. The one remaining building at 1322-24 West Taylor Street is being incorporated into plans for a new National Public Housing Museum, as part of the International Sites of Conscience. Originally made up of 7 15-story buildings and 33 2-story rowhouse buildings (1,198 units), the Grace Abbott Homes were built in 1955. In 2005, four of the high-rise buildings were demolished, and the rest were demolished by 2007. This property is planned to be redeveloped in Phases 3-6 of the new Roosevelt Square mixed-income community. Robert Brooks Homes and Extensions/Loomis Courts The Robert Brooks Homes were built in 1943 with 835 rowhouse units and was rebuilt in two phases between 1997 and 2000. The renovations reduced the housing density, resulting in 330 housing units. In 2005, the site was repurposed and became part of a new mixed-income development called Roosevelt Square. The Robert Brooks extensions were built in 1961 and were made up of three 16-story buildings (450 units). One of the three buildings, Racine, was demolished in 1998. The remaining two buildings were demolished in 2001. The Loomis Courts were built in 1951, and the 126-unit complex consisted of two seven-story buildings. Instead of coming from public housing funds, project funding came from city and state funds. In 2005, the CHA started a 2-phase rehabilitation process that preserved the property as affordable rental housing. Cross Ashland Just west of the ABLA's was a small neighborhood affectionately known as \\"'cross Ashland,\\" named for the southern twang where many residents of the downtown and the projects pronounced its location. Bordered by Ashland Ave. to the east, Western Ave. on the west, the 15th Pl. train tracks to the south and Roosevelt Rd. on the north. This area originally went as far north as Polk, pre-dating the Medical district. Many blacks and Jews lived in the area through much of the 20th century until the late sixties when most Jews, Poles, and Italians moved away. Cross Ashland also extended east all the way to Halsted. Before the ABLA homes were constructed many Blacks worked at the various rail yard companies at 15th St. before the companies all moved to foreign lands and the suburbs. They were proud to leave the oppressive south and work arduous hours to feed families and attend barbecues. In 2005 this community of roughly 10,000 in the fifties and 5,000 in the nineties was eventually brought to an end in a mass fire sale to land developers. Today the Cross Ashland area remains underdeveloped save for the new FBI building and University Police Station. Crime and Violence The housing projects were plagued by street gangs, drugs, and violent crimes. Most notably, the ABLA development was controlled by factions of the Black Gangster Disciples. In mid-1986, Break-ins by entry through bathroom medicine cabinets began occurring in the Abbott buildings. The apartments at the end of each floor bathrooms were separated by only two feet of tunnel space. Space was generally created for plumbers and janitors to have easy access to the pipes in the buildings. Ruth Mae McCoy On April 22, 1987, 52-year-old Ruth Mae McCoy was murdered by someone who entered her 11th floor Abbott apartment (1440 W. 13th St.) through her bathroom cabinet somewhere between 8:50-9:05 PM. McCoy called 9-1-1 at 8:45 that evening to report that someone in the apartment next door was coming through her bathroom cabinet. Due to the operator mostly disregarding her unintelligible responses, the call was noted as a \\"disturbance with a neighbor\\". After two more calls came through to 9-1-1 between 8:50-9:04 PM about screaming and gunshots coming from apartment 1109 (McCoy's apartment), police were dispatched and arrived ten minutes later. After their knocks went unanswered, the police attempted to enter the apartment using a key given to them by an attendant in the housing office, but left when the key failed to unlock the door. The next evening, 9-1-1 received a call from McCoy's neighbor worried and concerned about her whereabouts, considering she had seen police at her door the night before and she still had not seen McCoy. Chicago Police and CHA security guards arrived back at McCoy's apartment. After the knocks and calls for McCoy went unanswered, officers suggested breaking the door down, but were cautioned not to by CHA security guards. The following evening, a CHA official arrived at McCoy's door with a carpenter who drilled the lock on the door. McCoy was found lying on her bedroom floor shot four times; in her left shoulder, left thigh, the right side of her abdomen and right upper arm. Two men, Edward Turner, 18 and John Hondras, 21 were charged with: murder, home invasion, armed robbery, armed violence, and residential burglary. Witnesses claim that they saw the two men carrying McCoy's 19-inch color TV and rocking chair around the project in the early morning hours after her death. Due to lack of evidence, the charges against the two men were dropped after two years of the trial. The victim's daughter, Vernita McCoy, sued the Chicago Housing Authority for the cause of her mother's death in 1988.  Existing conditions  ABLA once held over 17,000 residents but due to redevelopment, only 2,100 residents remain. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Little Italy neighborhood (and inner city Chicago in general) underwent a significant period of gentrification resulting in almost all of the Chicago Housing Authority's projects being demolished or slated for redevelopment. The University Village redevelopment of the general Maxwell Street neighborhood and the expansion of the south campus of University of Illinois at Chicago also contributed to the end of ABLA. CHA Plan for Transformation The CHA's redevelopment plan for ABLA is named Roosevelt Square and includes 1,467 public housing units, of which 329 units were completed in 2000 as part of a complete rehab of the Brooks Homes and 383 off- site CHA replacement units were newly constructed. Construction of the remaining 775 on-site mixed-income units at Roosevelt Square began in 2004. ABLA's new physical design includes traditional Chicago-style buildings including single family homes and six-flat structures. In June 2005, the Chicago Park District reopened Fosco Park, a community center which includes an indoor swimming pool, gymnasium, and a new daycare facility. A Jewel/Osco supermarket opened near ABLA in January 2002. The redevelopment plan also includes an integrated \\"campus\\" green space with Smyth School and Duncan YMCA. A new fire and police station was constructed near ABLA. The \\"Vill\\" The common nickname for the ABLA homes is \\"the village,\\" or \\"the vill,\\" Due to their proximity to downtown and the UIC Medical Center/University, the ABLAs can be seen in several films and television programs: * The 80s police drama Hill Street Blues was set at a police station located two blocks east of ABLA. Stories from the show often involved situations there. * In the 1987 film Next Of Kin many scenes were filmed in and around ABLA, most notably one in which Patrick Swayze hides from his pursuers inside the Robert Brooks Extension and bribes a young child to misdirect them. * In the 2001 film Hardball, Keanu Reeves (who plays as Conor O'Neill) coaches a ragtag bunch of kids on an inner-city little league team. Almost half the film was shot at ABLA. * Several episodes of ER, Chicago Hope and Early Edition have filmed scenes in and around the ABLA homes.

A lesser-known contemporary of Ghalib and Zauq, he used \\"Momin\\" as his nom de plume. His grave is located near the parking area of Maulana Azad Medical College in Delhi. Life Momin Khan 'Momin' was born in Delhi into a Muslim family of Kashmiri origin.Abida Samiuddin, Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Urdu Literature, Global Vision Publishing House (2007), p. 342Kuldip Salill, A Treasury Of Urdu Poetry, Rajpal & Sons (2009), p.72 His father, Ghulam Nabi Khan, was a Hakeem (physician of traditional/Unani medicine). Momin Khan received training in the family profession from a young age and himself became a hakim, due to which he is often referred to in contemporary accounts as \\"Hakeem Khan,\\" Hakeem being the Urdu word for physician. However, his bent was for poetry and he soon became known more as an accomplished poet. His interest received a fillip due to the associations he unwittingly gained through marriage. In 1823, Momin married to a girl belonged to the family of zamindar (land owner). The marriage became unsuccessful, and he separated from his wife. He later married Anjuman-un-Nisa Begum, a relative of Urdu poet and Sufi saint Khwaja Mir Dard. They had a son, Ahmad Nasir Khan, and a daughter, Muhammadi Begum. Momin died after accidentally falling from the roof of his house on 24 Rajab 1268 Hijri (14 May 1852) at the age of 52.Diwan-e-Ghalib, compiled by Kalidas Gupta Riza, pg 90, Anjuman-i Taraqqi-i Urdu, Karachi (1997) Momin was something of a polymath, with several interests apart from medicine and poetry.

Momin is known for his particular Persianized style and the beautiful use of his 'takhallus'. According to legend, Mirza Ghalib (his contemporary and also a rival) offered Momin his entire diwan (collection of poetry) in exchange for a particular verse of Momin. However, most modern poets believe this claim as an 'exaggeration' which poets commonly indulged in at that time. This exaggeration was usually done to emphasise some thing.

He is an author and creator of a type of mindfulness meditation exercise, which has appeared in his books and recordings. Masters is the founder of the Oregon non-profit organization, the Foundation of Human Understanding. Early life in Britain Roy Masters was born Reuben Obermeister in London in 1928 to a Jewish family of diamond cutters. Like his father, Boris, Masters uses the common anglicisation of his original surname. Masters' father died in 1943, when Masters was 15 years old. His family could only afford education for his older brother, so Masters did not attend college.William Wolf, Healers, Gurus and Spiritual Guides (pdf), 1969, 1975, 2005, published by the Foundation of Human Understanding (Originally published by Sherbourne Press, 1969) He was sent to Brighton, England to apprentice in diamond cutting at his uncle's company, Monnickendam Ltd. Career= Diamond cutting  Masters implausible claims to have served in the Royal Sussex Regiment of the British Army during World War II; however, he was only 11 years old when the United Kingdom entered the war. Following the war, he apprenticed in diamond cutting. He pursued his trade in many places, including Amsterdam; Brussels; Belgium; and Johannesburg in 1947, where he spent two years. In 1949, Masters immigrated to the United States. In his early twenties, he traveled across America, lecturing on the topic of diamond cutting in 40 different states. He was invited to participate in radio and TV interviews on the subject, and briefly hosted a daily radio show called Story of Your Diamond. Masters met and married his wife Ann in Birmingham, Alabama, and they eventually moved to Houston, Texas. He developed an interest in hypnosis, and sold his diamond cutting business to start a new company, the Institute of Hypnosis. Lessons in hypnotism During his early years in Brighton, Masters saw a stage hypnosis presentation where the hypnotist easily induced volunteer subjects to do strange and outlandish things. Masters remembered pondering the question: \\"Why can't hypnotism be used to make people act sensibly, rather than foolishly?\\" Upon further exploration of hypnotism in the 1950s, Masters repudiated hypnotherapy, but he soon opened the Institute of Hypnosis in Houston. There, he saw as many as 30 clients a day for consultation, where he says he \\"unhypnotised\\" them instead of hypnotizing them. Masters called hypnosis a \\"duplication of life's errors\\": About his changing professions from diamond cutting, Masters said in an interview \\"I had my own business, but I left that lucrative work because I had a calling for this kind of work. I'm more interested in what I'm doing now than anything else.\\" Masters set the precedent for the legality of non-medical practice of hypnosis when he was charged with practicing medicine without a license at age 30. He was sentenced to serve 30 days in jail.  The Foundation for Human Understanding  Masters lived in Los Angeles, California, buying a house trailer and living in Venice, CA in 1961. He later profited from his investment in gold at its price highs in 1980 and purchased Tall Timber Ranch in Selma, Oregon, and relocated his family to Grants Pass, Oregon, where he moved the non-profit Foundation of Human Understanding. He produced an observational or meditation recording titled How Your Mind Can Keep You Well, which became the title of his radio show and one of his books.  Talk radio show  In 1961, Masters started a talk radio counseling show, which is currently broadcast under the name Advice Line, as a syndicated program. He hosts the show, which has been on the air continuously since its start.

Its goal was to produce Wankel engines. It followed an earlier, 1964 joint venture of both companies, the Geneva-based Comobil subsidiary, focusing on the development of the engines. Comotor engines were used by the Citro√´n M35 and by the GS Birotor. In 1969 the company purchased a large 850 000 m¬≤ plot of land at Altforweiler, half an hour to the east of Luxembourg in German Saarland in order to build a factory. The venture was hamstrung by technical, reliability, and fuel consumption issues. Although Citro√´n took a slow and calculated development path, including a two-year 'beta-program' in which 267 Citro√´n M35 prototypes were tested exhaustively by selected customers, rising fuel prices in 1973 nullified market demand for the fuel-thirsty engine. The vast sums that were invested in the Comobil and Comotor joint ventures were major contributors to the bankruptcy of both NSU and Citro√´n. Henk Van Veen of the Netherlands designed the OCR 1000 motorcycle around the Comotor engine. His company manufactured 38 of these motorcycles between 1974 and 1978.

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. Playing in the major leagues for 20 seasons between and , Valo batted .282, with 58 home runs, and 601 runs batted in (RBI), in 1,806 games, with most of his time spent as a member of the Athletics franchise, which was then located in Philadelphia and Kansas City. Early years A native of Rybn√≠k, Czechoslovakia, Valo emigrated to the United States with his family at the age of six. Career Valo played for Federalsburg of the Eastern Shore League in 1939, and for Wilmington in the Interstate League in 1940. Valo's big-league playing career was affected by three franchise relocations. Valo spent his first 13 seasons in the majors with the Philadelphia A's, then accompanied the team to Kansas City when the club moved after the 1954 season. Valo moved with the Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles after the 1957 season. And after playing for the Washington Senators in 1960, the franchise relocated and Valo found himself playing for the Minnesota Twins. He was a hustling player and an aggressive line-drive hitter who hit .300 or better five times, with a career- high .364 in 1955. As a right fielder, he was noted for his fearless manner in challenging fences, and occasionally crashed through an outfield wall in pursuit of a ball. As Valo's career moved into its final phase, he became an outstanding pinch-hitter. He used his strike zone judgment to post an on-base percentage over .400 in eight of the ten seasons (.414 from 1946 to 1955). In 1960, Valo set major-league pinch-hitting season records for games, walks and times on base. He also set a major-league career record with 91 walks as a pinch-hitter. Notable games Valo stated that he had a plate appearance for Philadelphia on September 30, 1939. If true, Valo would join Ted Williams, Mickey Vernon, and Early Wynn as the only four-decade players of the 1930s to the 1960s. The box score for the game does not list Valo ‚Äî he claimed that he was left out by the official scorer, as he was not under contract with Philadelphia at the time. On May 1, 1949, Valo became the first major league player to hit two bases-loaded triples in a game. The feat has been matched only by Bill Bruton (1959) and Duane Kuiper (1978). Valo added another bases- loaded triple that year, matching the major league record of three in a season, which was originally set by Shano Collins in 1918. Valo hit for the cycle on August 2, 1950. Later years Following his retirement as a player, Valo worked with the Indians' organization as a major league coach and minor league manager, and served as a scout for the Phillies for 13 years, until his death. He was inducted into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame in 1990. Valo died in Palmerton, Pennsylvania, at the age of 77 in 1998.

Medieval Spain Cantar de Mio Cid The Medieval period covers 400 years of different poetry texts and can be broken up into five categories.  Primitive lyrics  Since the findings of the Kharjas, which are mainly two, three, or four verses, Spanish lyrics, which are written in Mozarabic dialect, are perhaps the oldest of Romance Europe. The Mozarabic dialect has Latin origins with a combination of Arabic and Hebrew fonts.http://www.spanisharts.com/books/literature/i_lirica.htm  The epic  Many parts of Cantar de Mio Cid, Cantar de Roncesvalles, and Mocedades de Rodrigo are part of the epic. The exact portion of each of these works is disputed among scholars. The Minstrels, over the course of the 12th to the 14th centuries, were driving force of this movement. The Spanish epic likely emanated from France. There are also indications of Arabic and Visigoth. It is usually written in series of seven to eight syllables within rhyming verse.http://www.spanisharts.com/books/literature/i_epica.htm  Mester de clerec√≠a  The cuaderna v√≠a is the most distinctive verse written in Alexandrine verse, consisting of 12 syllables. Works during the 13th century include religious, epics, historical, advice or knowledge, and adventure themes. Examples of such themes include The Miracles of the Virgin Mary, Poema de Fern√°n Gonz√°lez, Book of Alexander, Cato‚Äôs Examples, and Book of Apolonio, respectively. Some works vary and are not necessarily mester de clerec√≠a, but are reflective of it. Such poems are of a discussion nature, such as Elena y Mar√≠a and Reason to Love. Hagiographic poems include Life of St. Mar√≠a Egipciaca and Book of the Three Wise Men. Mature works, like The Book of Good Love and Rhyming Book of the Palace, were not included in the genre until the 14th century.http://www.spanisharts.com/books/literature/i_clerecia.htm  Collection of verse (Cancionero)  During this movement, language use went from Galician-Portuguese to Castilian. Octosyllable, twelve syllables, and verse of arte mayor were becoming the footing of verses. Main themes derive from Proven√ßal poetry. This form of poetry was generally compilations of verses formed into books, also known as cancioneros. Main works include Cancionero de Baena, Cancionero de Estuniga, and Cancionero General. Other important works from this era include parts of Dance of Death, Dialogue Between Love and an Old Man, verses of Mingo Revulgo, and verses of the Baker Woman.http://www.spanisharts.com/books/literature/i_cancionero.htm  Spanish ballads  The romanceros have no set number of octosyllables, but these poems are only parallel in this form. Romancero Viejo consists of the oldest poems in these epochs, which are anonymous. The largest amount of romances comes from the 16th century, although early works were from the 14th century. Many musicians of Spain used these poems in their pieces throughout the Renaissance. Cut offs, archaic speech, and recurrent dialogue are common characteristics among these poems; however the type and focus were diverse. Lyrical romances are also a sizeable part of this era. During the 17th century, they were recycled and renewed. Some authors still stayed consistent with the original format. By the 20th century, the tradition still continued.http://www.spanisharts.com/books/literature/i_romancero.htm  Notable Spanish poets Early Middle Ages= * Mozarab Jarchas, the first expression of Spanish poetry, in Moz√°rabe dialect *Mester de Juglar√≠a ** Cantar de Mio Cid *Mester de Clerec√≠a ** Juan Ruiz, Arcipreste de Hita ** Gonzalo de Berceo *Troubadours *Xoh√°n de Cangas *Palla (troubadour) *Paio Soares de Taveir√≥s =Later Middle Ages= *Mac√≠as *Pero Ferrus *Juan Rodr√≠guez de la C√°mara *Alfonso Mart√≠nez de Toledo, Arcipreste de Talavera *Jorge Manrique * √ç√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza, 1st Marquess of Santillana * Juan de Mena Arabic and Hebrew poetry during the Moorish period During the time when Spain was occupied by the Arabs after the early 8th century, the Iberian Peninsula was influenced by the Arabic language in both the central and southern regions. Latin still prevailed in the north.http://www.alhewar.net/Basket/Habeeb_Salloum_Spanish_Language.htm The Jewish culture had its own Golden Age through the span of the 10th to 12th centuries in Spain. Hebrew poetry was usually in the style of Piyyut; however, under Muslim rule in Spain, the style changed. These poets began to write again in what was the ‚Äúpure language of the Bible‚Äù. Beforehand, poems were written in Midrash. This change was a result of the commitment the Arabs had to the Koran. Tempos and secular topics were now prevalent in Hebrew poetry. However, these poems were only reflections of events seen by the Jews and not of ones practiced themselves.http://medievalhebrewpoetry.org/adelmanarticle.html *The Alhambra Poets: ** Ibn al-Yayyab ** Ibn Zamrak ** Ibn al-Khatib * Ibn Sahl of Sevilla * Ibn Hazm of C√≥rdoba * Ibn Gabirol * Moses ibn Ezra * Abraham ibn Ezra * Ibn Quzman * Ibn Arabi After 1492 *Anonymous writers of the Romancero * Juan Bosc√°n * Gutierre de Cetina * Alonso de Ercilla * Santa Teresa de Jes√∫s * San Juan de la Cruz * Fernando de Herrera * Garcilaso de la Vega * Juan del Encina * Fray Luis de Le√≥n * Diego Hurtado de Mendoza * Lope de Rueda * Ausi√†s March (in Valencian) The Golden Age (El Siglo de Oro) This epoch includes the Renaissance of the 16th century and the Baroque of the 17th century.http://www.spanisharts.com/books/literature/poetrygold.htm During the Renaissance, poetry became partitioned into culteranismo and conceptismo, which essentially became rivals. :*Culteranismo used bleak language and hyperbaton. These works largely included neologisms and mythological topics. Such characteristics made this form of poetry highly complex, making comprehension difficult. :*Conceptismo was a trend using new components and resources. An example of this new extension was the Germanias. Works included comparative and complex sentences. This movement derived from Petrarchanism. During the Baroque period, Satire, Neostoicism, and Mythological themes were also prevalent. :*Satire tended to be directed to the elites, criticizing the defects of the society. This form of poetry often resulted in severe punishments being administered to the poets. :*Neostoicism became a movement of philosophical poetry. Ideas from the medieval period resurfaced. :*Mythological themes were more common in culteranismo. Not until the Generation of 1927 did these poems gain more importance. La F√°bula de Polifemo y Galatea and Las Soledades are two key works.http://www.donquijote.org/spanishlanguage/literature/history/poesia.asp * Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra * Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas * Luis de G√≥ngora y Argote established culteranismo. * F√©lix Lope de Vega Carpio * Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca * Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz Romanticism Germany and England were the large forces in this movement. Over the course of the late 18th century to the late 19th century, Romanticism spread philosophy and art through Western societies of the world. The earlier part of this movement overlapped with the Age of Revolutions. The idea of the creative imagination was rising above the idea of reason.

It is usually a short (between 20 and 40 seconds) montage of important scenes cut directly from previous episodes, usually short bursts of dialogue, which serve to lay the background for the following episode. These devices are predominantly seen on episodic series where every installment furthers the plot, but otherwise are used for plot arcs, that is, when an episode is going to pick up on a storyline initiated several episodes ago. A recap will almost always be present in an episode that picks up from a cliffhanger. Recap sequences are most prevalent in dramatic television series (though daytime serials are usually excluded) and reality programs, whereas situation comedies and other scripted genres typically use recap sequences only for two-part or in rare cases, multi-part episodes. These montages are inserted as the first thing into an episode so that viewers who had not seen the previous episodes or who do not remember what happened can understand from where the current episode will begin, also so that the viewers may decide to catch up on missed episodes, usually buying the DVDs. They usually begin with a voiceover or subtitle proclaiming, \\"Last week on... [the show's name]\\", \\"Previously on... [the show's name]\\" or \\"Last time on... [the show's name]\\". Many shows have begun to use a main character's voice for this voiceover rather than a neutral narrator (Chuck), and some series such as Boston Legal and Stargate Atlantis alternate which main character says \\"Previously on... [the show's name]\\". On the Fox show 24, the main character, Jack Bauer's voiceover \\"Previously on 24...\\" is followed by scenes from prior episodes of the current season, not necessarily from the very last episode, that concern major plot points of the current episode. This was carried over into 24: The Game, where, once a player completes a mission, all cutscenes prior to that mission can be viewed in the manner of the TV show. The playable scenes are not shown, as the player is given the opportunity to replay them to get a higher score. On the NBC show ER, main cast members rotate turns saying the phrase \\"Previously on ER...\\" which is then followed by scenes from previous episodes which are pertinent to the current episode. In some cases, the scene leading up to the previous episode's ending is shown instead of a montage. This was common on British television shows from the 1950s to 1990s, although now most adopt a recap montage. An example of this is Doctor Who, which during its original run (1963‚Äì1989) used the final scene of the previous episode to begin the next, whereas from the series relaunch (2005‚Äìpresent) the recaps are made up of a collection of short clips. Recaps are also used for several soap operas, most notably in Australia. The Australian prison soap opera Prisoner (commonly known as Prisoner: Cell Block H) used a recap sequence throughout its eight-season run. In the early years it only showed the final scene of the previous episode before the opening credits. However, in later years it began to show several select cuts from the previous episode during the recap sequence, often, a new scene would directly follow the recap before the opening credits. In the early years of Australian soaps Home and Away, Neighbours and Sons and Daughters a recap showed directly after the opening credits, which may have been confusing for viewers who would have started watching them, not realizing they were viewing a recap sequence and not a new opening scene. The layout was changed in later years as recaps for Home and Away and Neighbours started before the credits, but currently they again show after the credits in such a way not to confuse the viewer. British soap operas, apart from Hollyoaks, do not use a recap sequence, however, they may be relevant. In the English dubs of various episodic anime series that suffer editing for time or censorship reasons, recaps are sometimes extended or introduced where they didn't exist originally, to cover any shortfalls in running time. Some examples where this occurs are Robotech, the FUNimation English dub of Dragon Ball Z, and the 4Kids English-language version of One Piece. The original Japanese version of One Piece did not always have recaps, though many episodes did have recaps as the first scene following the opening credits. There is some debate as to whether these recaps should be considered as part of the episode whole. Some home video and DVD releases of shows that use recaps include them, some do not, and some seem to randomly use or omit them for different episodes within the same collection. A few also place the segment as a full chapter that can easily be skipped if the viewer is viewing the series in a marathon form.

It included ten high-rises and was named for Edward J. Jeffries, a former Detroit Recorder's Court judge, who was also father of a Detroit mayor. History The Jeffries Projects opened in 1953 as a complex of eight 14-story towers; five additional towers and low-rise apartment blocks were added in 1955. At first, the complex was popular among many Detroit residents who were eager to move into the new buildings. But by the late 1960s, the buildings had become a haven for drug dealers and an area with a high crime rate.https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/99148511/ Redevelopment The five towers built in 1955 were demolished in 1997. In April 2001, four of the towers of Jeffries West were imploded to make way for the redevelopment of the housing project. The remaining tenants of the Jeffries were moved to Freedom Place and Research Park housing complexes, approximately 8 city blocks from the Jeffries, while the redevelopment took place.Gentrification of Detroit: Will Shiny New Projects Push Out the Old Residents?, by Brandon Q. White / The Michigan Messenger, published 27 December 2007 A development by Scripps Park Associates was built on the site of Jeffries West and named \\"Woodbridge Estates\\". Woodbridge Estates includes 281 mixed-income housing rental units, 101 owner-occupancy attached and detached single-family homes, a 100-unit senior housing apartment building, plus 297 units of senior housing in the three remaining towers of the former Jeffries West. Located east of the main project stood the low-rise Jeffries East Projects consisting of 252 public housing units in rowhomes, which were demolished in 2008. The project was replaced by a development named Cornerstone completed in late 2012 developed in three phases. It included the development of 180 mixed-income rental units in 30 buildings of townhomes and duplexes, consisting of 138 public housing units and 142 affordable housing rental units. Former residents of Jeffries East in good standing with the Detroit Housing Commission were permitted to return to the next complex.

History  Teniente Esquivel Station in 1955 Earlier, in January 1955, Argentina had established the summer station, Teniente Esquivel, at Ferguson Bay on the southeastern coast. That station was evacuated in January 1956 because of a volcanic eruption on the neighboring Cook Island. The Corbeta Uruguay base was established, in 1976, by the military dictatorship governing Argentina to reinforce its territorial claims on British-held territory in the South Atlantic. The British government became aware of the base in December 1976 but sought a diplomatic solution to the issue until 1982. Early in the Falklands War, 32 special forces troops from Corbeta Uruguay were brought by the Argentine Navy ship Bah√≠a Para√≠so to South Georgia and landed at Leith Harbour on March 25, 1982. Corbeta Uruguay remained manned by Argentine personnel until June 20, 1982, when British forces, after victory over Argentina in the Falklands War, sent a task force to Thule Island to end the Argentine presence. After the Argentine garrison at Corbeta Uruguay surrendered, Thule Island was emptied and the facility left unmanned. In December 1982, it was mostly demolished by the Royal Navy after a patrolling warship (HMS Hecate) discovered that someone had taken down the Union Flag from the base flagpole and run up the flag of Argentina.Jeff Rubin.

It is often presented in a well-structured written document, but may also come in the form of a short verbal agreement or presentation. The logic of the business case is that, whenever resources such as money or effort are consumed, they should be in support of a specific business need. An example could be that a software upgrade might improve system performance, but the \\"business case\\" is that better performance would improve customer satisfaction, require less task processing time, or reduce system maintenance costs. A compelling business case adequately captures both the quantifiable and non-quantifiable characteristics of a proposed project. Business cases can range from comprehensive and highly structured, as required by formal project management methodologies, to informal and brief. Information included in a formal business case could be the background of the project, the expected business benefits, the options considered (with reasons for rejecting or carrying forward each option), the expected costs of the project, a gap analysis and the expected risks. Consideration should also be given to the option of doing nothing including the costs and risks of inactivity. From this information, the justification for the project is derived. Note that it is not the job of the project manager to build the business case, this task is usually the responsibility of stakeholders and sponsors.Building a Project‚Äôs Business Case PM Hut, 8 January 2009 Reasons for creating a business case Business cases are created to help decision-makers ensure that: * the proposed initiative will have value and relative priority compared to alternative initiatives based on the objectives and expected benefits laid out in the business case. * the performance indicators found in the business case are identified to be used for proactive realization of the business and behavioral change. Development and approval process The business case process should be designed to be: * adaptable ‚Äì tailored to the size and risk of the proposal * consistent ‚Äì the same basic business issues are addressed by every project * business oriented ‚Äì concerned with the business capabilities and impact, rather than having a technical focus * comprehensive ‚Äì includes all factors relevant to a complete evaluation * understandable ‚Äì the contents are clearly relevant, logical and, although demanding, are simple to complete and evaluate * measurable ‚Äì all key aspects can be quantified so their achievement can be tracked and measured * transparent ‚Äì key elements can be justified directly * accountable ‚Äì accountability and commitments for the delivery of benefits and management of costs are clear. Key elements of the business case report A good business case report, which brings confidence and accountability into the field of making investment decisions, is a compilation of all information collected during enterprise analysis and the business case process. The key purpose is to provide evidence and justification for continuing with the investment proposition.

The result of a review may be the termination or amendment of the project. The business case may also be subject to amendment if the review concludes that the business need has abated or changed, this will have a knock on effect on the project. Public sector projects Many public sector projects are now required to justify their need through a business case. In the public sector, the business case is argued in terms of Cost‚Äìbenefit analysis, which may include both financial and non-financial cost and benefits. This allows the business to take into account societal and environmental benefits, allowing a more comprehensive understanding of economic impacts.

It was created by American developer Eric \\"Badspot\\" Hartman, and was originally released as freeware on November 15, 2004. The game is not endorsed by, or affiliated with, the Lego brand. However, at one point, Lego was in talks with Hartman about purchasing the game. Blockland was spotlighted on The Screen Savers on February 11, 2005, drastically increasing the user base overnight. It has also been featured on Shack News. Blockland was officially released on February 24, 2007.Blockland Forum ‚Äì It's Here. February 2007 On December 16, 2013, Blockland was released on Steam after spending nearly a year on Steam Greenlight. Gameplay Blockland is an open-ended sandbox game, giving players the freedom to design and construct elaborate structures. Styled as a minifigure, players build inside of the virtual world using bricks reminiscent of toy blocks. These structures can be built in either a singleplayer or multiplayer server. Any player who buys the game is able to host a standard server, holding up to 100 players. The properties of individual bricks can be changed, such as illumination, particles, and specularity. Blockland also features NPCs, weapons, destructible vehicles, and a minigame system, enabling users to create new self-contained gameplay modes. These can range from deathmatch to full games-within-a-game, such as RPGs, or zombie survival. Blockland also features a trigger and event-based system to create basic interactive objects, such as operable light switches, missile launchers, collapsing structures, or arcade games such as Pong or Breakout. Blockland has a large community of player-created add-on content, such as gamemodes, vehicles, and specialty bricks. Shadows and Shaders Included in the game on August 9, 2012, an update called \\"Shadows and Shaders\\" (also known as Version 21) removed the game's traditional 'maps' - open-world terrain - replacing them with a flat field. GLSL shadows and shaders were added, along with customizable skyboxes, and a day/night cycle. Additionally, it provided users with the ability to make custom shader files.  History  A prototype version of Blockland known as 'Vanilla Blockland' was released on November 15, 2004. Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail wrote an article on this early version of Blockland, in which creator Eric \\"Badspot\\" Hartman claimed the game had gained 20,000 users in the ten days since it \\"became big\\", after being featured on The Screen Savers. The retail version of Blockland was completed and released on February 24, 2007. On August 8, 2012, a new version was released, removing terrain but adding more dynamic lighting to builds. The game was greenlit on Steam Greenlight on August 28, 2013. On December 16, 2013, Blockland was released on Steam after spending nearly a year on Steam Greenlight.  Modifications  Blockland features an add-on system to aid users in creating custom content, such as weapons, vehicles, effects, and gamemodes. Add-ons can range from new items to total overhaul modifications. While Blockland is not open source, all of the default vehicles and weapons in the game use the add-on system, so players can examine working examples to help them learn how to modify the game.

Picea glauca was originally native from central Alaska all through the east, across southern/central Canada to the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland. It now has become naturalized southward into the far northern United States border states like Montana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine; there is also an isolated population in the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming. It is also known as Canadian spruce, skunk spruce, cat spruce, Black Hills spruce, western white spruce, Alberta white spruce, and Porsild spruce.  Description  The white spruce is a large coniferous evergreen tree which grows normally to tall, but can grow up to tall with a trunk diameter of up to . The bark is thin and scaly, flaking off in small circular plates across. The crown is narrow ‚Äì conic in young trees, becoming cylindric in older trees. The shoots are pale buff-brown, glabrous (hairless) in the east of the range, but often pubescent in the west, and with prominent pulvini. The leaves are needle-like, long, rhombic (diamond-shaped) in cross-section, glaucous blue- green above (hence glauca) with several thin lines of stomata, and blue-white below with two broad bands of stomata. The cones are pendulous, slender, cylindrical, long and wide when closed, opening to broad. They have thin, flexible scales long, with a smoothly rounded margin. They are green or reddish, maturing to pale brown 4 to 8 months after pollination. The seeds are black, long, with a slender, long pale brown wing.

Cones open at moisture contents of 45% to 70% and specific gravities of 0.6 to 0.8 (Cram and Worden 1957, Zasada 1973, Winston and Haddon 1981). Weather affects both the initiation and pattern of seed dispersal (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990), but cone opening and the pattern of seed dispersal can vary among trees in the same stand (Zasada 1986). Even after dispersal has begun, cold, damp weather will cause cone scales to close; they will reopen during dry weather. Most seed falls early rather than late, but dispersal may continue through fall and winter (Zasada 1986),Zasada, J. 1986.

Viable seed on white spruce trees in midsummer. Can. Dep. Northern Affairs and National Resources, For. Branch, For. Res. Div., Ottawa ON, Silv. Leafl. 99. 2 p. Seed dispersal occurs mainly in late summer or early fall (Waldron 1965). White spruce seed is initially dispersed through the air by wind. Both the initiation and pattern of seed dispersal depend on the weather (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990), but these can vary among trees in the same stand (Zasada 1986). Small amounts of white spruce seed are normally dispersed beyond 100 m from the seed source, but exceptionally seeds have been found more than 300‚Äì400 m from the nearest seed source (Zasada 1986).  Root system  Nursery seedlings showing roots The root system of white spruce is highly variable and adaptable (Wagg 1964, 1967),Wagg, J.W.G. 1964.

On soils that limit rooting depth, the root system is plate-like, but it is a common misconception to assume that white spruce is genetically constrained to develop plate-like root systems irrespective of soil conditions (Sutton 1969).Sutton, R.F. 1969. Form and development of conifer root systems. Commonw. For. Bureau, Oxford, U.K., Tech. Communication No. 7. 131 p. In the nursery, or naturally in the forest, white spruce usually develops several long ‚Äúrunning‚Äù roots just below the ground surface (Mullin 1957).Mullin, R.E. 1957.

Slow-growing trees in rigorous climates are also capable of great longevity. White spruce high on the shore of Urquhart Lake, Northwest Territories, were found to be more than 300 years old (Hare and Ritchie 1972),Hare, F.K.; Ritchie, J. 1972. The boreal bioclimates. Geogr.

Its northern distribution roughly correlates to the location of the tree line, which includes an isothermic value of for mean temperature in July, as well as the position of the Arctic front; cumulative summer degree days, mean net radiation, and the amount of light intensities also figure. White spruce is generally found in regions where the growing season exceeds 60 days annually. Mixed forest with balsam fir (Abies balsamea) at the southern edge of the white spruce range in Maine on the West Peak of Mount Bigelow The southern edge of the zone in which white spruce forms 60% or more of the total stand corresponds more or less to the July isotherm of around the Great Lakes; in the Prairie Provinces its limit is north of this isotherm. During the summer solstice, day length values range from 17 hours at its southern limits to 24 hours above the Arctic Circle. One of the hardiest conifers, white spruce in parts of its range withstands mean daily January temperature of and extreme minimum temperatures as low as ; minimum temperatures of are general throughout much of the range except the southernmost and southeasternmost parts (Fowells 1965).Fowells, H.A. 1965.

On the forest‚Äìtundra and the northern tree-lines. Annales Univ. Turku A.II, Vol. 36:7‚Äì47. depicted Picea spp. as forming the northernmost limit of tree growth in North America. The arctic or northern timberline in North America forms a broad transition zone from Labrador to northern Alaska. In Labrador, white spruce is not abundant and constitutes less than 5% of the forest, with a range that coincides very closely with that of black spruce but extending slightly further north (Wilton 1964).Wilton, R.F. 1964. The forests of Labrador. Can. Dep. For., For. Res. Branch, Ottawa ON, Publ. 1066. 72 p. The range of white spruce extends westwards from Newfoundland and Labrador, and along the northern limit of trees to Hudson Bay, Northwest Territories, Yukon, and into northwestern Alaska (Fowells 1965). Although Bell (1881) was emphatic that it ‚Äúnowhere reaches the Atlantic coast [from which it recedes] further and further in going north‚Äù. Across western Canada and Alaska, white spruce occurs further north than black spruce, and, while poplar (Populus), willow, and birch may occur along streams well into the tundra beyond the limits of spruce, the hardwoods are usually no more than scrub (Hustich 1953).Hustich, I. 1953. The boreal limits of conifers. Arctic 6:149‚Äì162. Spruce characteristically occurs in fingers of tree-form forest, extending far down the northern rivers and as scattered clumps of dwarfed ‚Äúbush‚Äù spruce on intervening lands (Munns 1938, Halliday and Brown 1943).Halliday, W.E.D.; Brown, A.W.A. 1943. The distribution of some important forest trees in Canada. Ecology 24:353‚Äì373. In Manitoba, Scoggan (1957, citing a 1951 but otherwise unreferenced report by Baldwin) noted that the northernmost collection of white spruce was at latitude 59¬∞48‚ÄôN, but Bryson et al. (1965)Bryson, R.A.; Irving, W.H.; Larson, J.A. 1965. Radiocarbon and soil evidence of former forest in the southern Canadian tundra. Science 147(3653):46‚Äì48. found white spruce in the northern edge of continuous forest in central Canada at Ennadai Lake, about 60¬∞45‚Ä≤ N, 101¬∞‚ÄôW, just north of the northwest corner of Manitoba. Bryson et al. (1965) noted that the forest retained ‚Äúthe same general characteristics as when it was first described [by Tyrrell (1897)Tyrell, J.B. 1897. Geol. Surv. Can., Ottawa ON, Ann. Rep. 1896, Vol. 9. (Cited by Bryson et al. 1965, orig. not seen)] in 1896‚Äù. Collins and Sumner (1953) reported finding white spruce within 13 km of the Arctic coast in the Firth valley, Yukon, at about 69¬∞30‚Ä≤ N, 139¬∞30‚Ä≤ W, and Sargent (1922) noted that white spruce in Alaska ‚Äúreached Behring Strait in 66¬∞44‚Ä≤ N‚Äù. White spruce in the former District of Ungava, dwarfed (note seated human in white for scale, center) Climate, especially temperature, is obviously a factor in determining distributions of northern flora. Halliday and Brown (1943) suggested that white spruce's northern limit corresponds ‚Äúvery closely‚Äù with the July mean monthly isotherm of 10 ¬∞C in Ungava, but that the northern limit west of Hudson Bay was south of that isotherm. Other climatic factors that have been suggested as affecting the northern limit of white spruce include: cumulative summer degree days, position of the Arctic front in July, mean net radiation especially during the growing season, and low light intensities (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Topography, soil conditions, and glaciation may also be important in controlling northern limits of spruce (Drew and Shanks 1965).Drew, J.V.; Shanks, R.E. 1965. Landscape relationships of soils and vegetation in the forest‚Äìtundra ecotone, Upper Firth River Valley, Alaska‚ÄìCanada. Ecol. Monogr. 35:285‚Äì306. The southern limit of distribution of white spruce is more complex. From east of the main range of coastal mountains in British Columbia, the southern continuous limit of white spruce is the forest/prairie interface through Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, the northern parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin, central Michigan, northeastern New York, and Maine (Fowells 1965). Sargent (1922) and Harlow and Harrar (1950) also included Vermont and New Hampshire; and, while Dame and Brooks (1901)Dame, L.L.; Brooks, H. 1901. Handbook of the Trees of New England. Ginn, Boston MA. 196 p. excluded New York and states further west, they included Massachusetts as far south as Amherst and Northampton, ‚Äúprobably the southern limit of the species‚Äù in that area. Nisbet (1905)Nisbet, J. 1905. The Forester. Blackwood and Sons, Edinburgh and London, U.K., Vol. 1. 506 p. gave the range of white spruce as extending to ‚ÄúCarolina‚Äù, but he did not recognize red spruce as a species and presumably included it with white spruce. Towards the southern parts of its range, white spruce encounters increasingly effective ecological competition from hardwoods, some of which may reinforce their growth-rate or sprouting competitiveness with allelopathic depredation of coniferous regeneration (Tubbs 1976).Tubbs, C.H. 1976. Effect of sugar maple root exudate on seedlings of northern conifer species. USDA, For. Serv., Res. Note NC-213. 2 p. Further southward extension of the distribution is inhibited by white spruce's cold requirement.  White spruce as an exotic species  As an exotic, white spruce is widespread but uncommon. It was introduced into England (Hereman 1868)Hereman, S. 1868.

Nisbet (1905) noted that firmly-rooted white spruce served very well to stabilize windswept edges of woods in Germany. In a narrow belt of mixed Norway and white spruces over an extremely exposed hilltop crest at high elevation in northern England, the Norway spruce were ‚Äúcompletely dwarfed‚Äù whereas the white spruce had reached heights of between 3 and 4.3 m (Guillebaud et al. 1920).Guillebaud, W.H.; Steven, H.M.; Marsden, R.E. 1920. Rate of growth of conifers in the British Isles. Forestry Commission, HMSO, London, U.K., Bull. 3. 84 p. The age of the belt was not recorded, but adjoining 66-year-old stands may have been of the same vintage. White spruce has also been used as a minor plantation species in England (Selby 1842, Anon. 1879)Selby, P.J. 1842. A history of British forest-trees. Van Voorst, London. 540 p.Anon. (C.P.J.) 1879.

However, the species is held in high regard in the Belgian peat region, where it grows better than do the other spruces (Fraser 1933).Fraser, G.K. 1933. Studies of certain Scottish Moorlands in relation to tree growth. For. Commission, HMSO, London, U.K. 112 p.  Ecology  Growing in the riparian zone amid treeless bogs White spruce is a climax canopy tree in the boreal forests of Canada and Alaska. It generally occurs on well-drained soils in alluvial and riparian zones, although it also occurs in soils of glacial and lacustrine origin. The understory is dominated by feather mosses (Hylocomium splendens and Pleurozium schreberi, Ptilium crista-castrensis, and Dicranum spp.), and occasionally peat moss. In the far north, the total depth of the moss and underlying humus is normally between , although it tends to be shallower when hardwoods are present in the stand. White spruce grows in soils with pH values of 4.7‚Äì7.0, although they have been found in soils as acidic as 4.0 in subalpine fir forests in the Northwest Territories. A presence of calcium in the soil is common to white spruce found in northern New York. White spruce most commonly grows in the soil orders of Alfisols and Inceptisols. Soil properties such as fertility, temperature, and structural stability are partial determinants of the ability of white spruce to grow in the extreme northern latitudes. In the northern limits of its range, white spruce is the climax species along with black spruce; birch and aspen are the early succession species. Wildfires typically occur every 60 to 200 years, although they have been known to occur as infrequently as every 300 years. White spruce will grow in USDA Growing Zones 3-7, but is not adapted to heat and humidity and will perform poorly in a hot climate. The tree attains its greatest longevity and growth potential in Zones 3-4.  Soils  White spruce growing in the riparian zone of the Sautauriski River, Qu√©bec White spruce occurs on a wide variety of soils, including soils of glacial, lacustrine, marine, and alluvial origins; overlying basic dolomites, limestones and acidic Precambrian and Devonian granites and gneisses; and Silurian sedimentary schists, shales, slates, and conglomerates (Halliday 1937).Halliday, W.E.D.

Its occurrence on some organic soils is not characteristic, except perhaps on shallow mesic organic soils in Saskatchewan and in association with black spruce on organic soils in central Yukon (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Podzolized, brunisolic, luvisolic, gleysolic, and regosolic (immature) soils are typical of those supporting white spruce throughout the range of the species (Nienstaedt 1957). Soils supporting white spruce are most commonly Alfisols or Inceptisols (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). In the podzol region of Wisconsin, white spruce occurs on loam podzols, podzolized gley loams, strongly podzolized clays, gley-podzol clays, stream-bottom soils, and wood peat (Wilde et al. 1949). Moist sandy loams also support good growth (Harlow and Harrar 1950). On sandy podzols (Wilde et al. 1949), it is usually a minor species (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Good development occurs on moist alluvium (Seeley, cited by Nienstaedt 1957; Jeffrey 1961, 1964; Lacate et al. 1965; Viereck 1973)Jeffrey, W.W.

White spruce becomes less accommodating of soil with increasing severity of climate. The distribution of white spruce in Labrador seems to depend almost entirely on the character of the soil (Sargent 1898), and between the southwestern shores of Hudson Bay and the northeastern regions of Saskatchewan, white spruce is confined to very local physiographic features, characterized by well-drained or fertile soils (Ritchie 1956).Ritchie, J.C. 1956.

But, broadly, white spruce is able to tolerate considerable droughtiness of sites that are fertile, and no fertile site is too moist unless soil moisture is stagnant (Sutton 1968).Sutton, R.F.

Soil fertility holds the key not just to white spruce growth but to the distribution of the species. At least moderate fertility is needed for good growth, but white spruce occurs on many sites where nutrient deficiencies depress its growth more than that of black spruce, red spruce, Norway spruce, and the pines generally (Heiberg and White 1951, Lafond 1954, McLeod 1956, MacArthur 1957, Paine 1960, Swan 1960).Heiberg, S.O.; White, D.P.

Mossy forest floor under white spruce Forest floors under stands dominated by white spruce respond in ways that vary with site conditions, including the disturbance history of the site (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Composition, biomass, and mineral soil physical and chemical properties are affected. In Alaska, the accumulation of organic layers (to greater thicknesses in mature stands of spruce than those in hardwood stands on similar sites) leads to decreased soil temperatures, in some cases leading to the development of permafrost (Viereck 1970a, b, Viereck et al. 1983).Viereck, L.A.

Acidity of the mineral soil sampled at an average depth of 17 cm in 13 white spruce stands on abandoned farmland in Ontario increased by 1.2 pH units over a period of 46 years (Brand et al. 1986).Brand, D.G.; Kehoe, P.; Connors, M. (1986). \\"Coniferous afforestation leads to soil acidification in central Ontario.\\" Can. J. For. Res. 16(6):1389‚Äì1391. A considerable range of soil pH is tolerated by white spruce (Nienstaedt 1957). Thrifty stands of white spruce in Manitoba have developed on soils of pH 7.6 at only 10 cm below the surface, and pH 8.4 at 43 cm below the surface (Stoeckeler 1938, USDA Forest Service 1938);Stoeckeler, J.H.

An abundant calcium supply is common to most white spruce locations in New York state (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Chlorosis was observed in young white spruce in heavily limed nursery soils at about pH 8.3 (Stone, cited by Nienstaedt 1957). Wilde (1966) gave 4.7 to 6.5 as the approximate optimum range of pH for white spruce in Wisconsin, but optimum growth seems possible at pH levels up to 7.0 and perhaps higher (Sutton 1968). Alluvium on the floodplains of northern rivers shows pH levels from 5.0 to 8.2 (Zasada et al. 1977).Zasada, J.C.; Van Cleve, K.; Werner, R.A.; McQueen, J.A.; Nyland, E.

FMR-X-85. 275 p. while calcareous soils are favourable sites for northern outliers of white spruce (Hustich 1953). Mature stands of white spruce in boreal regions often have well-developed moss layers dominated by feather mosses, e.g., Hylocomium splendens (Hedw.) B.S.G., Pleurozium schreberi (Brid.) Mitt., Ptlium crista- castrensis (Hedw.) De Not., and Dicranum Hedw. spp. rather than Sphagnum Dill. spp. (La Roi and Stringer 1976, Viereck 1987).La Roi, G.H.; Stringer, M.H. (1976).

[Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990] The thickness of the moss‚Äìorganic layer commonly exceeds 25 cm in the far north and may approach twice that figure. The mosses compete for nutrients and have a major influence on soil temperatures in the rooting zone. Permafrost development in parts of Alaska, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories is facilitated by the insulative organic layer (Viereck 1970a, b, Gill 1975, Van Cleve and Yarie 1986).Gill, D.

Cold hardiness  Young tree with light snowcover White spruce is extremely hardy to low temperatures, provided the plant is in a state of winter dormancy. Throughout the greater part of its range, white spruce routinely survives and is undamaged by winter temperatures of , and even lower temperatures occur in parts of the range (Fowells 1965, Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Boreal Picea are among the few extremely hardy conifers in which the bud primordia are able to survive temperatures down to (Sakai and Larcher 1987).Sakai, A.; Larcher, W. (Eds.) (1987). Frost Survival of Plants. Springer-Verlag, New York NY. 321 p. Especially important in determining the response of white spruce to low temperatures is the physiological state of the various tissues, notably the degree of \\"hardening\\" or dormancy. A natural progression of hardening and dehardening occurs in concert with the seasons (Glerum 1985).Glerum, C. (1985). \\"Frost hardiness of coniferous seedlings: principles and applications.\\" p. 107‚Äì123 in Duryea, M.L. (Ed.).

While different tissues vary in ability to tolerate exposure to stressful temperatures, white spruce, as with woody plants in general, has necessarily developed sufficient winter hardiness in its various tissues to enable them to survive the minimum temperatures experienced in the distribution range. White spruce is subject to severe damage from spring frosts. Newly flushed shoots of white spruce are very sensitive to spring frost (Smith 1949, Rowe 1955, McLeod 1964).Smith, B.J.

Forest succession  Disturbed roadside blooms with early-succession fireweed; behind, late- succession Alaskan white spruce forest, Yukon Forest succession in its traditional sense implies two important features that resist direct examination (Solomon et al. 1981).Solomon, A.M.; West, D.C., and Solomon, J.A. 1981. Simulating the role of climate change and species imiigration in forest succession. p. 154‚Äì178 in West, D.C.; Shugart, H.H.; Botkin, D.B. (Eds.). Forest Succession: Concepts and Application. Springer-Verlag, New York NY. First, classical definitions generally connote directional changes in species composition and community structure through time, yet the time frame needed for documentation of change far exceeds an average lifespan (Solomon et al. 1981). The second feature that defies quantitative description is the end point or climax. Floodplain deposits in the Northwest Territory, Canada, are important in relation to the development of productive forest types with a component of white spruce (Jeffrey 1964). The most recently exposed surfaces are occupied by sandbar vegetation or riparian shrub willows and alder (Alnus incana); with increasing elevation, the shrubs give way successively to balsam poplar and white spruce forest. In contrast, older floodplains, with predominantly brown wooded soils, typically carry white spruce‚Äìtrembling aspen mixedwood forest. Interrelationships among nutrient cycling, regeneration, and subsequent forest development on floodplains in interior Alaska were addressed by Van Cleve et al. (1980),Van Cleve, K.; Dyrness, R.; Viereck, L. 1980. Nutrient cycling in interior Alaska flood plains. p. 11‚Äì18 in Murray, M.; Van Veldhuizen, R.M. (Eds.). Proc.

Rep., PNW-107. 52 p. who pointed out that the various stages in primary succession reflect physical, chemical, and biological controls of ecosystem structure and function. Thus, each successional stage has a species combination in harmony with site quality. Short-circuiting succession by planting a late successional species such as white spruce on an early successional surface may result in markedly reduced growth rates because of nitrogen insufficiency. Without application of substantial amounts of fertilizer, use would have to be made of early successional alder and its site-ameliorating additions of nitrogen. Old- growth Alaskan white spruce, Yukon Neiland and Viereck noted that ‚Äúthe slow establishment and growth of spruce under birch stands [in Alaska] may be partially due to effects of shading and general competition for water and nutrients, but may also be more directly related to the birch itself.

Forest types and ecosystems. p. 109‚Äì136 in North American Forest Lands at Latitudes North of 60 Degrees, Proc. sympos., Univ. Alaska, Fairbanks AK, Sept. 1977. On dry upland sites, especially south-facing slopes, the mature vegetation is white spruce, white birch, trembling aspen, or a combination of these species. Succession follows in one of two general patterns. In most cases, aspen and birch develop as a successional stage after fire before reaching the spruce stage. But, occasionally, with optimal site conditions and a source of seed, white spruce will invade with the hardwoods or within a few years thereafter, thereby producing even-aged white spruce stands without an intervening hardwood stage.  Associated forest cover  Taiga in the Gasp√©sie, Qu√©bec, including other species The White Spruce Cover Type may include other species in small numbers. In Alaska, associates include paper birch, trembling aspen, balsam poplar, and black spruce; in western Canada, additional associates are subalpine fir, balsam fir, Douglas-fir, jack pine, and lodgepole pine (Dyrness 1980).Dyrness, C.T. 1980.

Forest Cover Types of the United States and Canada. Soc. Amer. Foresters, Washington DC. Seral species giving way to white spruce include paper birch, aspen, balsam poplar, jack pine, and lodgepole pine. On certain river bottom sites, however, black spruce may replace white spruce (Viereck 1970a). Earlier successional stages leading to the white spruce climax are the white spruce‚Äìpaper birch, white spruce‚Äìaspen, balsam poplar, jack pine, and lodgepole pine types. The type shows little variation. The forest is generally closed and the trees well formed, other than those close to the timberline. Lesser vegetation in mature stands is dominated by mosses. Vascular plants are typically few, but shrubs and herbs that occur ‚Äúwith a degree of regularity‚Äù include: alder, willows, mountain cranberry, red-fruit bearberry, black crowberry, prickly rose, currant, buffaloberry, blueberry species, bunchberry, twinflower, tall lungwort, northern comandra, horsetail, bluejoint grass, sedge species, as well as ground-dwelling mosses and lichens. Several white spruce communities have been identified in interior Alaska: white spruce/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/sphagnum; white spruce/avens/moss; and white spruce/alder/bluejoint (Viereck 1975, Dyrness 1980).Viereck, L.A. 1975.

Important insect pests of white spruce include the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana [Clemens]), the yellow-headed spruce sawfly (Pikonema alaskensis Rohwer), the European spruce sawfly (Gilpinia hercyniae [Hartig]), the spruce bud moth (Zeiraphera canadensis), and spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis [Kirby]) (Fowells 1965, Rose and Lindquist 1985, Ives and Wong 1988).Fowells, H.A.

A number of sawflies feed on spruce trees. Among them European spruce sawfly, yellow-headed spruce sawfly, green-headed spruce sawfly and the spruce webspinning sawfly (Rose and Lindquist 1985). More than a dozen kinds of looper feed on the spruces, fir, and hemlock in eastern Canada. The full-grown larvae of the larvae vary in length from 15 mm to 35 mm. Some feed briefly in the fall and complete their feeding in the spring; others feed mainly in the summer; still others feed mainly in the late summer and fall. The fall and spring feeding group includes the dash-lined looper (Protoboarmia porcelaria indicataria Walker), the diamond-backed looper (Hypagyrtis piniata Packard), the fringed looper (Campaea perlata Guen√©e), and the false loopers (Syngrapha species). The summer feeding group includes the false hemlock looper (Nepytia canosaria Walker), occasionally occurring in large numbers and usually in conjunction with the hemlock looper (Lambdina fiscellaria fiscellaria Guen√©e), the small spruce loopers Eupithecia species, the yellowlined conifer looper (Cladara limitaria Walker), and the saddleback looper (Ectropis crepuscularia Denis and Schifferm√ºller). The late summer and fall group includes the common spruce-fir looper (Semiothisa signaria dispuncta Walker) and the similar hemlock angle (moth) Macaria fissinotata Walker on hemlock, the small spruce loopers Eupithecia species, the gray spruce looper Caripeta divisata Walker, occasionally abundant, the black- dashed hydriomena moth (Hydriomena divisaria Walker), and the whitelined looper (Eufidonia notataria Walker).  Uses  Black Hills spruce grown as bonsai Wildlife such as deer, rabbits, and grouse browse the foliage during the winter. White spruce is of major economic importance in Canada for its wood, harvested for paper-making and construction. It is also used to a small extent as a Christmas tree. The wood is also exported to Japan where, known as \\"shin-kaya\\", it is used to make go boards as a substitute for the rare kaya wood. Black Hills Spruce (Picea glauca var. densata) is used for bonsai (see image). White spruce is the provincial tree of Manitoba and the state tree of South Dakota.  Varieties  Dwarf Alberta white spruce in Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden Several geographical varieties have been described, but are not accepted as distinct by all authors. These comprise, from east to west: *Picea glauca var. glauca (typical or eastern white spruce). From Newfoundland west to eastern Alberta, on lowland plains. *Picea glauca var. densata (Black Hills white spruce). The Black Hills in South Dakota. *Picea glauca var. albertiana (Alberta white spruce). The Rocky Mountains in Alberta, British Columbia and northwest Montana. *Picea glauca var. porsildii (Alaska white spruce). Alaska and Yukon. The two western varieties are distinguished by pubescent (downy) shoots, and may be related to extensive hybridisation and/or intergradation with the closely related Engelmann spruce found further south in the Rocky Mountains. White spruce also hybridises readily with the closely related Sitka spruce where they meet in southern Alaska and northwestern British Columbia; this hybrid is known as Picea √ó lutzii.  Cultivars  reversion in one branch Numerous cultivars of various sizes, colours and shapes have been selected for use in parks and gardens. The following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. *Picea glauca ‚ÄòEchiniformis‚Äô *Picea glauca var. albertiana ‚ÄòAlberta Globe‚Äô *Picea glauca var. albertiana ‚ÄòConica‚Äô 'Conica' is a dwarf conifer with very slender leaves, like those normally found only on one-year- old seedlings, and very slow growth, typically only per year. Older specimens commonly 'revert', developing normal adult foliage and starting to grow much faster; this 'reverted' growth must be pruned if the plant is to be kept dwarf.  Chemistry  Isorhapontin can be found in spruce species such as the white spruce.  Genome  P. glauca has three different genomes; a nuclear genome, a mitochondrial genome, and a plastid (i.e. chloroplast) genome. The large (20 Gbp) nuclear genome of P. glauca (genotype WS77111) was published in 2015,Warren RL, Keeling CI, Yuen MMS, Raymond A, Taylor GA, Vandervalk BP, Mohamadi H, Paulino D, Chiu R, Jackman SD, Robertson G, Yang C, Boyle B, Hoffmann M, Weigel D, Nelson DR, Ritland C, Isabel N, Jaquish B, Yanchuk A, Bousquet J, Jones SJM, Mackay J, Birol I, Bohlmann J.

Kelly rose to fame in the early 1970s appearing in several films. Kelly played opposite Bruce Lee in the 1973 martial arts action film Enter the Dragon. He also had lead roles in 1974's Black Belt Jones as the title character and Three the Hard Way as Mister Keyes. Kelly died of cancer on June 29, 2013 at age 67. Early life His father ran a locker- rental service for Navy personnel. He began his athletic career at Bourbon County High School in Paris, Kentucky, competing in basketball, football, and track and field. He attended the University of Louisville, where he played football, but left during his freshman year after a coach referred to a Black teammate with a racial slur. Instead he began to study Shorin-ryu karate. Kelly began his martial arts career under the tutelage of Sin Kwan The (Shaolin-Do) in Lexington, Kentucky. He trained in Okinawan karate under the direction of Parker Shelton, Nate Patton, and Gordon Doversola. During the early 1970s, Jim Kelly became one of the most decorated world karate champions in the sport. In 1971, Kelly won four prestigious championships that same year, most notably, the World Middleweight Karate title at the 1971 Long Beach International Karate Championships. Kelly opened his own dojo, which was frequented by numerous Hollywood celebrities. He taught karate to actor Calvin Lockhart for a role in a thriller feature film Melinda (1972) and plays a martial arts instructor in the movie. Kelly was also a professional tennis player on the USTA Senior Men's Circuit. He played amateur tennis in the 1970s at Plummer Park in West Hollywood. Acting career As an actor, Kelly became the first black martial arts film star. He co-starred alongside Bruce Lee in the blockbuster, Enter the Dragon (1973) in a role originally intended for actor Rockne Tarkington, who unexpectedly dropped out days before shooting in Hong Kong. Producer Fred Weintraub had heard about Kelly's karate studio in the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles, went there to see him, and was immediately impressed. This appearance led to starring roles in a string of martial arts-themed blaxploitation films, among them Melinda (1972), and Black Belt Jones (1974). This was the only role in which he was the primary star; most of Kelly's film roles played up the novelty of an African-American martial arts master. He earned a three-film contract with Warner Brothers and made Three the Hard Way (1974) with Jim Brown and Fred Williamson, and Hot Potato (1976), in which he rescues a diplomat's daughter from the jungles of Thailand. After his contract ended with Warner Brothers, he starred in low- budget films Black Samurai (1977), Death Dimension (1978), and Tattoo Connection (1978). After his appearance in One Down, Two to Go (1982), Kelly rarely appeared in movies. A deleted scene from the film Undercover Brother (2002), included on the DVD extra features, shows him in a cameo appearance with Eddie Griffin. In his last film, Kelly made a cameo appearance as Cleavon Washington in Afro Ninja (2009), produced, directed by, and starring veteran stuntman Mark Hicks. Personal life and death Kelly was married two times; from 1967 until 1968 to his college sweetheart Marilyn Dishman and later to Marcia Bentley from 1980 to his death in 2013. From 1973 to 1976, Kelly dated film actress Rosalind Miles. On June 29, 2013, Kelly died of cancer at his home in San Diego, California. He was 67 years old.

Along with Don Carter, Weber is widely regarded as professional bowling's first superstar. Bowling accomplishments Weber made his first bowling headlines during the early 1950s, while working as a mailman in his native Indianapolis. In 1955 he moved to Florissant, Missouri to join the bowling team named the Budweisers (after the popular American beer brand). The team established a long-standing 5-man ABC league series record on March 12, 1958 at the National Team Match Games at Floriss Lanes in St. Louis, Missouri breaking a 1937 ABC record for a 5-man team with 3,858 pins and 138 strikes. The record wasn't broken until 1994. In 1958 Weber became a founding member of the Professional Bowlers Association, which he subsequently dominated. Weber captured his first PBA title in the 2nd tournament of the inaugural 1959 season, and won three of the PBA's first four tournaments. He went on to win 10 of the first 23 PBA tournaments, including winning seven titles in the 13-event 1961 PBA season. Only Mark Roth has won more titles in a PBA season with eight victories in 1978, but Roth's feat was accomplished over a 35-event season. During his career, Weber won titles in 30 PBA Tour events, including four major titles. All of his major titles were earned in the BPAA All-Star, which later became the U.S. Open. Weber won this tournament four times in a five-year span (1962, '63, '65 and '66). He was twice runner- up in the Firestone Tournament of Champions (1965 and 1966). He earned his final PBA Tour title at age 47 in the 1977 King Louie Open. He went on to capture six PBA Senior Tour events, amassing a total of 36 PBA titles in both categories. He was PBA Player of the Year in 1965, and earned BPAA National Bowler of the Year honors three times (in 1961, 1963 and 1965). He was named an All-American ten times, and in 1999 was ranked #2 bowler of the 20th Century by Bowlers Journal. In 2002 Weber also became the first player to win at least one PBA title in six decades (counting PBA Senior events). Bowling mostly in an era of low prize money, Weber managed to cash over $930,000 in PBA earnings.Clark, Tom. \\"Pete Weber's resurgence has PBA on edge\\" (archive), USA Today, March 1, 2002. He also enjoyed a decades-long sponsorship agreement with AMF bowling. League bowling in the United States had its heyday in the 1960s and early 1970s, partly due to the influence of pros like Weber and Don Carter. Several PBA pros like Johnny Petraglia claimed to be inspired by Dick Weber: \\"The main reason I went on Tour was Dick Weber. When I was 14, I saw him do an exhibition in Madison Square Garden. When I left I remember saying to myself: 'I know what I want to do now; I want to be like Dick Weber.'\\"Chat log of Johnny Petraglia in \\"Talk Today\\" at www.usatoday.com, 1/21/05. Both Weber and his son Pete are members of the United States Bowling Congress Hall of Fame and the PBA Hall of Fame. When Pete won his first PBA title in 1982, it marked the first time in history that a father and son had both won PBA Tour titles.1982 Greater Hartford Open at www.pba.com The feat has since been matched by Don and Jimmy Johnson, Don and Eugene McCune, and Guppy and Kyle Troup. In 1999 Dick Weber was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. The PBA ranked him 3rd on its 2008 list of \\"50 Greatest Players of the Last 50 Years.\\" Only all-time titles leaders Earl Anthony and Walter Ray Williams, Jr. ranked higher. Personal Weber was also known as a tireless ambassador of his sport, and rarely passed up an opportunity to promote it. One promotion had him bowling the highest (altitude) game ever in \\"Operation AstroBowl,\\" which took place on a Boeing 707 on January 7, 1964.Davis, Steve. \\"A Match Made in Heaven.\\" Bowlers Journal, Mar 1984:86-92 This was a joint campaign for American Airlines' Cargo Service. The aircraft used was an all-cargo Boeing 707 with a single AMF lane installed in the main cargo hold. The flight was from New York to Washington's Dulles Airport. Weber also appeared several times on Late Show with David Letterman. On February 14, 2005, Richard Anthony Weber died in Florissant, Missouri, at age 75. On the day of his death, Weber had just returned from a USBC (United States Bowling Congress) meeting in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He showed no prior sign of ill-health but experienced serious breathing problems that evening and paramedics were unable to revive him. The underlying cause of death was not known, but was ultimately due to respiratory failure. Dick Weber was survived by his wife Juanita, one daughter, and three sons including Richard Weber Jr., who would become a PBA employee and manager of the PBA's Midwest Region. Juanita, also an avid bowler who once won a state championship, passed away on April 13, 2020 at the age of 89. Media presence and tributes Weber also produced his own training video called Let's Bowl With Dick Weber. Its blurb reads: \\"Voted 'one of the best bowlers that ever lived,' Weber has held the PBA presidency and 26 PBA titles in a career that spans four decades. Weber covers all the basics: bowling accessories, proper ball weight and fit, stance, follow through, delivery and release. He even gives tips for aiming and addresses some of the common faults of new bowlers. This unique, in-depth video brings the elements of high- precision sport into your living room so you can practice these tips at the alley and begin building your bowling skills.\\" The Weber Cup, named after Dick, is a Ryder Cup-style event that pits European and American ten-pin bowlers against one another. It is held annually in England. From 2008 to 2010, the PBA had a tour stop named the Dick Weber Open. In 2011, the PBA named its all-new playoff series the Dick Weber PBA Playoffs. On April 17, 2006, the inaugural Dick Weber Tribute was held in St. Louis. Organized by Bill McCorkle, the event attracted many of bowling's top luminaries. The event was attended by over 20 members of the Weber family, representing four generations, as well as over 50 professional bowlers, including champions and members of the Hall of Fame. The highlight of the evening came when Pete Weber delivered a moving tribute. Many in the audience had never seen this side of him before. A documentary on the life and fame of Dick Weber was released on March 23, 2007, by Live Technologies, Inc. and Bill McCorkle. It consists of interviews with many current and former professional bowlers, family, and sportscasters as well as footage covering Weber's 60-year history as a professional athlete. Weber's legacy also lives on through the Bowling Proprietors Association of America (BPAA), which now gives out an annual BPAA Dick Weber Bowling Ambassador award. The most recent award winner was Lynda Barnes in 2016.

He now serves as member of the Board of Trustees to the Center for Health Care Strategies, Inc. and a member of the Advisory Board of the Peterson Center on Healthcare. He is a former Director of the Congressional Budget Office and Assistant to the President for Ronald Reagan. Crippen served on NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel. He graduated from the University of South Dakota (B.S. 1974) and Ohio State University (M.A. 1976; Ph.D. 1981). Reagan years From 1981-1985 Crippen served as chief counsel and economic policy advisor for Senate Minority Leader Howard Baker. When Baker became President Reagan's Chief of Staff in 1987, Crippen followed Baker to the White House as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy from 1987-1988 and Domestic Policy Advisor and Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy from 1988-1989. Republicans hoped that Crippen would be a strong proponent of Reagan's appropriations bills and that he could mend relations with Congress. After Reagan left office in 1989, Crippen turned to the private sector, as a principal of Washington Counsel (1996-1999), a law and lobbying firm; Merrill Lynch as an executive director; and The Duberstein Group, a public relations consulting firm, as founder and vice president. Congressional Budget Office He was Director of the Congressional Budget Office from 1999-02-01 to 2003. Republican leaders selected Crippen as a somewhat moderate candidate, drawing the ire of members of both parties, who sought a more ideological director. A 2003 Wall Street Journal article suggested that he may have lost his chance at reappointment for failing to support dynamic scoring, a practice inspired by supply-side economics. NASA and present day On July 28, 2004 NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe selected him to serve on NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP). He was also a member of the Stafford-Covey Return to Flight Task Group, which helped set policies to return the space shuttle to flight after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. In February 2005, he was briefly mentioned as a possible NASA Administrator. Crippen still works in the private sector, largely focusing on healthcare issues, and does some public speaking. In a 2005 Washington Post editorial, Crippen called for increased use of technology to reduce healthcare costs, altering the service structure by delegating more services to nurses and other hospital staff, and studying the subset of the Medicare population which uses the majority of the resources. Crippen serves on the board of directors of Eclipsys.About Us: Board of Directors In early 2011, Crippen was named executive director of the National Governors Association.

Female residents of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, competed to produce the most babies in order to qualify for an unusual bequest in a will. The race was the product of a scheme by Charles Vance Millar (1853‚Äì1926), a Toronto lawyer, financier, and practical joker, who bequeathed the residue of his significant estate to the woman in Toronto who could produce the most children in the decade following his death.Orkin, Mark M. Millar, Charles Vance, The Canadian Encyclopedia online.

Litigation over the validity of the will was resolved when the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the clause's validity. The Court further held the clause did not encompass children born out of wedlock, or stillborn. Eleven families competed in the \\"baby race.\\" Seven of them were disqualified, but eventually Judge William Edward Middleton ruled in favour of four mothers (Annie Katherine Smith, Kathleen Ellen Nagle, Lucy Alice Timleck and Isabel Mary Maclean) who each received $110,000 for their nine children ($ in dollars).

It was built by James Weir around 1830 as a two-story single-pen log structure, consisting of American chestnut logs on a limestone foundation. The log frame is covered with siding. In various times in its history, the house has served as a post office, store, inn, Civil War hospital, and library. In 1977, Samuel Gene McNeeley inherited the house from his parents, who had lived in it since 1920. In 1979 the house was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The following year, McNeeley, a physician who lived in nearby Norris, Tennessee, sold the house to the Claiborne County government, on the condition that it be used as a library or museum. A library was opened in the house in 1982 and operated until about 2000. In 2003 the library's board of directors opted to vacate the property, citing space concerns and the near-prohibitive cost of upkeep. In September 2004 the Claiborne County commissioners voted to return ownership of the house to Dr. McNeeley (who died in 2005). The house was purchased in 2007 by Eleanor Yoakum and moved to her farm south of Tazewell. It was being restored to its original condition by Verlin Singleton. The restoration was expected to be completed early in 2008, after which the house was to be open to the public by appointment only.

He came out as gay before dying from an AIDS-related illness in 1993. Neo-Nazism Nicky Crane joined the British Movement (BM) in the late 1970s, and by 1980, he had become the BM organiser for Kent. In 1980, he attacked a black family at a bus stop near Liverpool Street station. For this act, he was convicted of unlawfully fighting and making an affray, and given a suspended sentence. Crane appeared on several T-shirts and calendars produced by the Aldgate skinhead shop The Last Resort during the 1980s. In 1981, he appeared on the cover of the Oi! compilation album Strength Thru Oi! (due to his skinhead appearance, not his racist views), with his Nazi tattoos partially airbrushed out. Garry Bushell, who chose the image, later said: \\"I had a Christmas card on the wall, it had that image that was on the cover of Strength Thru Oi!, but washed out. I honestly, hand on my heart, thought it was a still from The Wanderers. It was only when the album came through for me to approve the artwork that I saw his tattoos. Of course, if I hadn't been impatient, I would have said, right, fucking scrap this, let's shoot something else entirely. Instead, we airbrushed the tattoos out. There were two mistakes there, both mine. Hands up.\\" The album was \\"hastily withdrawn\\" by Decca Records when Crane's identity and previous convictions were made public, and has since become very collectable. Also in 1981, Crane was convicted and jailed for four years for his role in a BM-organised attack on a group of black youths arriving on a train at Woolwich Arsenal railway station in 1980. He once led an attack on an anti-racist concert being held in Jubilee Gardens in London. Pictures of him storming the stage where singer Hank Wangford was performing appeared in national newspapers; although Crane was clearly identifiable, no action was taken. Released from jail in 1984, Crane soon began providing security for the white power skinhead band Skrewdriver, and remained associated with the band and its leader, Ian Stuart Donaldson, for the rest of the decade, designing two of the band's album covers and writing the lyrics for the song \\"Justice\\" on the LP Hail the New Dawn. He was jailed again in 1986 for six months following a fight on an Underground train. In 1987, he was instrumental in setting up the neo-Nazi network Blood and Honour with Donaldson. Homosexuality Crane was leading a double life as a homosexual, even serving as a steward at the London gay pride march in 1986. He was a regular at London gay clubs such as Heaven, Bolts and the Bell pub.Searchlight, September 1986 At various times, Crane had worked as a bin man, bicycle courier, and a doorman at an S&M; club. He worked for the protection agency Gentle Touch, and was able to shrug off any connection with the London gay scene as just part of his security work. He also appeared in the Psychic TV video for Unclean, and in amateur gay porn films while still a neo-Nazi activist.Sounds, 22 September 1984 In 1992, Crane admitted his homosexuality in a segment of the Channel 4 magazine show Out titled \\"Skin Complex.\\" On the programme, broadcast on 29 July 1992, Crane and various other homosexuals explained why they were attracted to the skinhead scene. He was immediately disowned by his Nazi associates, including Ian Stuart Donaldson, who said: \\"I feel more betrayed by him than anybody else. It just goes to show that nationalism and homosexuality do not fit together, because nationalism is a true cause and homosexuality is a perversion.\\" The same month, the UK newspaper The Sun ran an article on him entitled \\"Nazi Nick is a Panzi\\", and included a picture of Crane with his face snarling at camera, head shaved bald, braces worn over his bare torso, faded jeans, white-laced boots and brandishing an axe. Crane died from an AIDS-related illness 18 months later. Crane's homosexuality is a central theme of Max Schaefer's 2010 novel, Children of the Sun, which follows James, a budding screenwriter in 2003 who becomes obsessed with the now deceased Crane.

For this achievement he was appointed consul in AD 13 with Lucius Munatius Plancus as his colleague. However, years later Silius became entangled in machinations of the ambitious Praetorian prefect Sejanus and was forced to commit suicide. Due to an ambiguity in the Fasti Capitolini, experts such as Mommsen and Attilio Degrassi believed Silius' full name was Gaius Silius Aulus Caecina Largus. However, Arthur and Joyce Gordon pointed out that the form of this name, known as polyonymy, was unusual, preceding any other known example by fifty years, and suggested, based on admittedly less reliable sources, that this entry was more accurately read as two names: Gaius Silius, and Aulus Caecina Largus, the latter an otherwise unknown senator.Gordon and Gordon, \\"Roman Names and the Consuls of A.

Biography Silius was probably a son of Publius Silius Nerva. In AD 13, Silius was elected consul alongside Lucius Munatius Plancus. At the end of his tenure in office, he was appointed imperial legate of Germania Superior, under the overall command of Germanicus, and was the officer in charge of the four upper Rhine legions which did not mutiny upon the death of the emperor Augustus.Christopher Burnand, Tacitus and the Principate: From Augustus to Domitian (2011), pg. 56Pat Southern, The Roman army: a social and institutional history (2007), pg. 294 Once the mutiny was suppressed, Silius continued to serve loyally under Germanicus, participating in the Roman retaliation campaign (between AD 14 and 16) against a Germanic alliance in the aftermath of the disaster at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. His successes earned him an honorary triumph in AD 15.Smith, p. 823 The following year, Germanicus sent Silius against the Chatti with 30,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry, defeating them in the process,Ludwig Heinrich Dyck, The Roman Barbarian Wars: The Era of Roman Conquest (2011), pg. 256 after which Tiberius appointed him as a taxation auditor in Gaul.

Due to their friendship with Agrippina they became innocent victims of Sejanus' schemes.Jasper Burns, Great women of Imperial Rome: mothers and wives of the Caesars (2007), pgs. 51-52 In the Senate, Lucius Visellius Varro (consul in 24) accused Silius of being complicit in Sacrovir's revolt, and of misappropriating money from the provincial government in Gaul. Refusing to submit a plea or to defend himself, Silius declared that had he not personally kept the legions on the Rhine from avenging the murder of Germanicus, Tiberius would have lost his position as Princeps.Stephen Dando-Collins, Blood of the Caesars: how the murder of Germanicus led to the fall of Rome, (2008), pg. 97 Faced with false witnesses swearing that he had robbed the Gallic provinces, Silius committed suicide in 24, and afterwards Galla was exiled.

Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad (AM&O;) was formed in 1870 in Virginia from 3 east-west railroads which traversed across the southern portion of the state. Organized and led by former Confederate general William Mahone (1826-1895), the line linked Norfolk with Bristol, Virginia by way of Suffolk, Petersburg, Lynchburg, and Salem. The AM&O; was promoted as a trade link to the west, and further expansion was envisioned with the goal of increasing Virginia's Ohio Valley and Mississippi Valley commerce. It was heavily backed by investors from England and Scotland. The AM&O; went into receivership after the U.S. Financial Panic of 1873. After several years of continuing financial problems, Mahone's relationship with the bondholders soured, and he was removed as trustee, but was permitted to continue to lead operations. Finally, in 1881, the AM&O; was sold at auction. It was acquired by other U.S. interests based in Philadelphia who outbid Mahone. They were already building Shenandoah Valley Railroad and had a new commodity in mind: bituminous coal. The AM&O; was renamed to Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W;). Norfolk & Western Railway was expanded west into the coalfields, and later into a much large system, eventually tapping the Ohio Valley and Mississippi Valley commerce as earlier promised Virginia. The N&W; was combined with the Southern Railway, another profitable carrier, to form Norfolk Southern Corporation (NS) in 1982. Today, much of the former Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad remains in service for Norfolk Southern. The Fortune 500 company, headquartered in Norfolk, transports bituminous coal, intermodal shipping containers, automobile parts and completed vehicles, and other commodities in the 21st century global transportation markets. Most of the former AM&O; lines are still part of the NS rail network.  Predecessor lines  Three pre-civil war era railroad lines were combined to form the AM&O.; They are listed from east to west:  Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad  The Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad, organized by Dr. Francis Mallory of Norfolk was built between 1853 and 1858 by a young civil engineer named William Mahone (1826-1895). It featured an innovative and durable roadbed through a portion of the Great Dismal Swamp and an arrow-straight tangent between Suffolk and Petersburg. Mahone was named its head in 1860. South Side Railroad The oldest predecessor was the City Point Railroad a long line to Petersburg completed in 1838. In 1854, it became part of the South Side Railroad. The South Side Railroad was the middle section of the AM&O;, stretching 132 miles from City Point (part of today's City of Hopewell) to Lynchburg in 1854. Virginia and Tennessee Railroad The Virginia and Tennessee Railroad extended from Lynchburg to Bristol. It made important westward connections which reached New Orleans, Louisiana, before the war began in 1861.  William Mahone and the American Civil War  All three railroads were severely damaged during the American Civil War (1861-1865). After Virginia seceded in April 1861, William Mahone, as its president, used the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad (N&P;) to deliver a small force to Norfolk to secure the Gosport Navy Yard, an important resource for the Confederacy. After Union leaders declined a request to surrender possession, he used an N&P; train and other deception to bluff them into thinking large numbers of rebel troops were arriving, causing them to abandon the shipyard with no loss of life. He accepted a commission in the Confederate Army and during the remainder of 1861 and until May 1862, also continued as head of the N&P.; Mahone was relieved of N&P; duties in 1862 as he took on increasing responsibilities with the Confederate Army. He was active in many campaigns and was an able leader during the war, best known as the hero of the Battle of the Crater in 1864 where he rallied troops and foiled an initial Union success during the Siege of Petersburg.  Post-war, rebuilding and linking  Atlantic, Mississippi & Ohio Railroad Stock Certificate from 1871. After the end of hostilities, defeated Confederate General Robert E. Lee advised his generals to go back to work rebuilding. William Mahone did just that. He returned to his old job and quickly set about repairing the N&P.; Meanwhile, the managers of the South Side Railroad and Virginia and Tennessee Railroad also worked hard to restore service and rebuild bridges, stations, and rolling stock. The war had demonstrated the need to consolidate resources and connections, and the stockholders of the South Side Railroad elected Mahone as president of their road also before the end of 1865. It was known that the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) and other northern interests were trying to develop connections in the Shenandoah Valley which would favor Baltimore over Norfolk and other Virginia ports. Mahone could see that the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad was the key to western connections for the other two roads and he became a driving force in the linkage of N&P;, South Side Railroad and the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad (V&T;). He was president of all three by the end of 1867. However, the V&T; board was opposed to consolidation which was favored by the other two roads. Rumors indicated that the B&O; would expand its Valley line southward to meet the V&T; near Salem, Virginia. Ultimately, the B&O; did reach as far as up the valley as Lexington, Virginia, only short of reaching Salem. When Mahone could not persuade the V&T; board, he took another route to force consolidation, and worked diligently in lobbying the Virginia General Assembly, a part-owner of all three roads, to gain the legislation necessary to combine them into a single entity, and expand westward.  \\"All Mine and Otelia's\\"  Advertisement for the Atlantic, Mississippi & Ohio Railroad from 1880, one year before its merger into the Norfolk and Western Railway Mahone was finally successful, and in 1870, the Atlantic, Mississippi & Ohio Railroad (AM&O;) was organized as a new line comprising the three railroads he headed, extending 428 miles in Virginia from Norfolk to Bristol. The former general and his wife Otelia (a character in her own right) moved to Lynchburg, where the AM&O; established headquarters and shops. The letters A, M and O were said to stand for \\"All Mine and Otelia's.\\" Instead of utilizing northern financial interests, in addition to the state's investment, Mahone obtained the needed funded through bonded indebtedness from across the ocean through a British financial agent. The AM&O; did well for several years. The three former railroads initially each became divisions, and the former South Side Railroad was later consolidated with the former N&P; into a single division. Unfortunately for Mahone's dreams, before much expansion could take place, the AM&O; fell on hard times in the financial Panic of 1873 which negatively impacted almost all of the railroads. After several years of operating under receiverships, Mahone had a falling out with his agent, who claimed a breach of integrity. There are some historical indications that this may have resulted from miscommunication, interference by Mahone's many enemies, or both. In any event, the foreign bondholders requested other receivers be appointed, and one of his lieutenants, Henry Fink, was named. In early 1881, the AM&O; was sold at public auction. Mahone forces had gathered what he thought would be sufficient funds to place a winning bid, but they were outbid by a surprise entry of a principal of a Philadelphia-based financial company, a previously unidentified competitor. The new owners renamed it Norfolk and Western, possibly utilizing an earlier name proposed by citizens of Norfolk in the pre-war efforts to secure rail service. Mahone was able to arrange for a portion of the State's proceeds of the AM&O; sale to help found a school to prepare teachers to help educate black children and former slaves. The Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute near Petersburg was forerunner of Virginia State College, which expanded to become Virginia State University. A leader of the Readjuster Party, after leaving the railroad business, he became even more active in Virginia's politics and served as a Senator in the U.S. Congress from 1881-1887.  Whatever became of the former AM&O;?  Atlantic, Mississippi & Ohio Railroad, Jefferson Street Tunnel, Norfolk & Western RY main line, Lynchburg, VA The new owners were E. W. Clark & Co., a private banking firm in Philadelphia which already owned a controlling interest in the Shenandoah Valley Railroad. The latter was expanding south from Hagerstown, Maryland, and seeking a potential connection. Under the common ownership, the link was established between Lynchburg and Salem on the old AM&O; at the tiny community of Big Lick on the Roanoke River, which soon became the city of Roanoke and a major office and shops location of the N&W.; It became known as the \\"Magic City.\\" While Mahone's vision for the Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad was western trade and the transportation business, the new owners were focused on their investments in the rich, largely untapped coal reserves of southwestern Virginia and southern West Virginia. They knew older anthracite coal fields in northwestern New Jersey, southern New York, and northern Pennsylvania were playing out. Under their auspices, the former AM&O; was greatly expanded as the N&W; into the coal fields and beyond and became a system larger and far more wealthy than Mahone probably had ever dreamed. In the mid 20th century, N&W; merged with long-time rival Virginian Railway in the Pocahontas coal region and grew even more in size and profitability by mergers with other rail carriers including Nickel Plate Road and Wabash in adjacent areas to form a system serving 14 states and a province of Canada between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mississippi River and Great Lakes with more than of trackage. 100 years later after its name was changed from AM&O;, the N&W; was combined with the Southern Railway, another profitable carrier, to form Norfolk Southern Corporation (NS) in 1982. Today, much of the former Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad remains in service for Norfolk Southern, a Fortune 500 company headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia. The modern railroad transports bituminous coal, intermodal shipping containers, automobile parts and completed vehicles, and other commodities in the 21st century global transportation markets. Mahone's trackbed through the Great Dismal Swamp, the tangent, and much of the rest of the AM&O; route are still in service.

It uses manipulation and massage to achieve the treatment outcome, although techniques differ from one practitioner to another. It emerged from the shamanic tradition of the ancient Filipinos with healers considering their practice as derived from their calling from visions or from having been born by breech.  Overview  Hilot incorporates supernatural aspects, particularly in cases of practitioners who claim that their ability is given by a supernatural source such as the case of manghihilot who embarks on pilgrimage to a mountain called Banahaw to satisfy the spiritual component of their healing practice. A Hilot practitioner or albularyo (herbalist) are usually cheaper alternatives to medical doctors in the Philippines, especially in very deep rural areas. A Manghihilot employs chiropractic-like manipulation and massage for the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal ailments. They also have been known to reset dislocated and sprained joints such as the knee, ankle, fingers and metacarpal bones. An Albularyo use herbs in addition to massage. The term hilot is also applied to traditional midwives, licensed or otherwise (Panday in Meranaw).  Spiritual and physical components  Mt. Banahaw, located in Luzon, is considered a sacred mountain by manghihilots The spiritual component of Hilot treats the relationship between the body's attitude and universal energy. In other words, the goal is to bring the body back to harmony. This focuses on inner change. One way this can be achieved is through the Banahaw Devotional Technique. Tracing its origins to the fifteenth century, this technique requires the performance of orasions and sacrificial rituals to influence the body's spirit. The goal of this is to ask for forgiveness from God. Depending where the manghihilot and their patient are located, the popular location to perform this technique is in the active volcano of Mt. Banahaw, located in Luzon. Following the Banahaw Devotional Technique is the Pagpapahalaga, or the Valuing Process in which the goal is to direct inner change to outer change with the use of inner understandings. These inner understandings is presented within the following three modules: mabuti (self- honesty), makabubuti (sincerity), makapagpapabuti (consequential goodness). The Banahaw Devotonal Technique and Valuing Process are treatments for inner conflicts within the body such as stress which causes the imbalance of the four elements. The physical material component of Hilot is addressed through four modalities and this time focuses on external forces in order to restore balance between the four elements. The bio-chemical modality promotes chemical component changes through the process of breaking down foods, herbs, vitamins, and minerals. The neuro-electrical modality is the use of electricity, in the form of positive and negative ions, to break down material goods in the body. The goal of the third process, electro-magnetic field (EMF), is to cause a change in the neuro-electric field to restore the normal function of the body's cells. The final modality is the bio-mechanical process which is the modality that has chiropractic similarities. This process focuses and manipulates the interaction of bones, tendons, and muscles to restore their normal functions. The direction of treatment among all four modalities is from material components (outer) to the inner components of the body. Practicioners Practicioners of hilot are both the manghihilot and the magpapaanak: Manghihilot The manghihilot (\\"massager\\", \\"folk massage therapist\\", \\"folk chiropractor\\") uses massaging techniques to treat sprains, fractures, and other similar conditions that affect the skeletal system and the musculatory system, including ligaments. The practice treats illnesses a variety of ways based on its own universal law and natural Law (physical manipulation, herbal remedies, and dietary/life style advice). Manghihilots are either chosen by maestros or master albularyos, or through apprenticeship. Gender is not a limiting factor since they can be any gender. When chosen, their trainings include a pilgrimage to a sacred mountain to perform the oracions, or words enabling the communication with the spirit world or the panawagan. Similar to the albularyo practice, the hilot is a fusion of spiritual and medicinal practices with physical manipulation and the focus of healing the whole body being the main distinctions between the two practices. Illnesses were referred to as pilay and were defined by imbalances in the body which are explained by their enkanto, or unseen entities, elements, and manifestations in the body. This practice shares similarities with India's Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine. Magpapaanak The magpapaanak, the other \\"hilot\\", is the folk \\"midwife\\" who does prenatal visits and check- ups to pregnant mothers. Normally a woman, she delivers babies during childbirth and often performs the ritual called the suob (a form of \\"aroma therapy\\" performed while placed under a cloak).  Traditional Chinese Medicine similarities  The geopolitical position of the Philippines as either being the gateway to either enter or exit Southeast Asia has allowed the exchanging of medical knowledge between immigrants, whether they are colonial predecessors or neighboring countries. The Chinese diaspora (see also: Chinese mestizos) showed one exchange. The trade between China and the Philippines was recorded as early as the eighth century and enhanced in the sixteenth century. The activity of trade during the sixteenth century was especially active because of the Manila-Acapulco Galleons. The methods used by manghihilots is similar to the Chinese acupuncture study of the Yellow Emperor's Body, the idea that the body through fluids of energy known as a yin and yang, in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Native Filipino medicine uses the four elements (earth, water, fire, and air) to diagnose conditions while TCM views the conditions of the body through the Five Element Theory: fire, earth, wind, metal, water, and wood. Another similarity is the diagnosis of imbalance caused by engkantos, or the unseen entities within the body. For instance, the manghihilot may describe a person who is having trouble breathing air by calling that trouble engkanto sa hangin meaning air entity. This person's actual condition may be asthma according to Western medicine. In TCM, this imbalance may be explained by the imbalance set between yin and yang (the force of yin may be dominating the body and vice versa). Other similar approaches to diagnosing include herbs (not necessarily accompanied by the blessing of it shown in the Albularyo practice), taking patient history, facial diagnosis, and tongue diagnosis. Current research on the Hilot shows that it is not clear as to whether or not the Chinese medicine had a direct influence on the Hilot or the Hilot had an influence on TCM because it is not clear whether these Hilot methods were a coincidence of similarities or borrowed from Traditional Chinese Medicine since the people coming from Southern China were primarily involved in commerce. It is also not clear which Indigenous practices originated from Ayurveda. It is not known whether these merchants had medical knowledge.  Present day  The sophistication of the practice has evolved overtime and is still being practiced primarily in rural areas of the Philippines. The challenges of incorporating traditional/alternative medicine into the Philippine national health care system shows the competition against Western medicine because of the stigma of superstition and the lack of scholarly evidence to prove alternative medicine effective. There are organizations advocating for the fusion of both western medicine and alternative medicine out of the Traditional and Alternative Medicine Act (TAMA) passed in 1997 to make healthcare accessible in rural areas. The Philippine Institute of Traditional and Alternative Health Care (PITAHC) is one of the advocacy groups formed from TAMA and one of their objectives is to: \\"Encourage scientific research on and develop traditional and alternative health care systems that have direct impact on public health care\\". With this objective, the organization advocates for the continuation and legitimization of hilot. The ancient practice of the hilot has become a debate in public health policy in the Philippines.

The exception was the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of Communications, which left BOCG in 1998. The BOCG brand is still retained by the life insurance and casualty insurance operations of the Bank of China, in both Hong Kong and Mainland China. History The opening of a branch of the Bank of China in Hong Kong in 1917 marked the entry of state-owned Chinese banks into the then colony's banking sector. Other banks soon followed suit, starting with Yien Yieh Commercial Bank in 1918. By the time the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, there were 15 branches of state owned Chinese banks in Hong Kong, plus branches of nine Mainland-incorporated banks that were public- private joint ventures, namely: * Sin Hua Bank Limited (SHB) * China & South Sea Bank Limited (CSSB) * Kincheng Banking Corporation (KBC) * China State Bank Limited (CSBL) * The National Commercial Bank Limited (TNCB) * The Yien Yieh Commercial Bank Limited (YYCB) * Young Brothers Banking Corporation * Wo Sang Bank * National Industrial Bank of China In addition, the Chinese government established Po Sang Bank in 1949 and Nanyang Commercial Bank in 1950. Both of these were incorporated in Hong Kong. Centralised management In 1952, the nine public-private banks were grouped into the Joint Office of Joint Public-Private Banks. The Hong Kong branches of three of these (namely Young Brothers Banking Corporation, Wo Sang Bank and National Industrial Bank of China were closed in 1954 when their parents were scrapped, and management of the remaining six public-private banks were transferred to the Hong Kong and Macau Regional Office of the Bank of China in 1958. The Bank of China later took over management of the Hong Kong branches of Kwangtung Provincial Bank, Hua Chiao Commercial Bank and the Bank of Communications. All three were incorporated in the Mainland. 1970-1980s The Bank of China began accumulating stakes in Chiyu Banking Corporation in the 1970s. In June 1975, the Bank of China moved to increase the capital of the public-private banks. As all of the new capital were from the Chinese government, private ownership in the public-private banks were substantially reduced to less than 1%. The 14 banks were rebranded as part of the Bank of China Group in the 1980s, after a common IT platform was established. Treasury and foreign currency exchange operations were also centralised.

The 1992 follow-up Laughing on Judgement Day reached number 2, while both albums were certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). All nine singles released from the two albums reached the UK Singles Chart top 40. Luckhurst left the band in late 1992, and was replaced the following February by former Great King Rat bassist Mikael H√∂glund. The new lineup recorded only one studio album, Behind Closed Doors, which peaked at number 5 in the UK and spawned three UK top 40 singles. The 1995 compilation Their Finest Hour (And a Bit) reached number 22 in the UK and was certified silver by the BPI. H√∂glund left in 1996 and was replaced by Chris Childs, after Morley performed bass on fourth album The Thrill of It All, which reached the UK top 20. Thunder's 1998 live album Live reached number 35 on the UK Albums Chart, while the following year's fifth studio album Giving the Game Away reached number 49. The band broke up in early 2000 due to \\"outside business forces\\". After a brief hiatus, Thunder returned in 2002 and formed their own record label, STC Recordings. The band's sixth studio album Shooting at the Sun was released the following year, supported by the UK top 50 single \\"Loser\\". After three more new studio albums ‚Äì 2005's The Magnificent Seventh, 2006's Robert Johnson's Tombstone and 2008's Bang! ‚Äì Thunder decided to break up in 2009. Two years later, however, the group returned for a third active spell, scheduling a number of sporadic live shows over the following years. A tenth studio album, Wonder Days, was released on the earMusic label in 2015, giving the band their first UK top ten since 1995 when it peaked at number 9. Rip It Up followed in 2017, reaching a peak UK Albums Chart position of number 3. History=1989‚Äì1991: Early years and debut studio album On 1 January 1989, at the group's annual New Year's Day meeting, Terraplane was disbanded by vocalist Danny Bowes and guitarist Luke Morley, who decided to form a new band under the name Thunder. Later in the month, the pair recorded a number of demos at Great Linford Manor Studios in Milton Keynes with producer Andy Taylor and engineer Ben Matthews, as well as Terraplane drummer Gary \\"Harry\\" James, who was brought in after the initially planned drummer failed to attend. According to Morley, the band name was chosen as a combination of two elements: a song he had written called \\"Distant Thunder\\", and Taylor's debut solo album. Enlisting Bad Company's Steve Price to play bass temporarily (Morley played bass as well as guitar on the Linford Manor demos), the group invited a number of record labels to their rehearsals in London, and later signed with EMI in April. Mark \\"Snake\\" Luckhurst joined Thunder as the group's original bassist on 2 May 1989, having been recommended by James after the two had performed together in Hellfire Corner. The band's lineup was completed with the addition of Matthews, who had earlier played keyboards for Terraplane's last two shows and engineered Thunder's January demos. Thunder played their first live show on 13 July 1989 at the Reid's Club in Southend-on-Sea, the first date in a short run of seven UK dates dubbed \\"The Toilet Tour\\". In August the band returned to the Great Linford Manor to record their debut studio album, again working with Taylor as producer. The album was mixed at London's AIR Studios by Mike Fraser, who also engineered the record. \\"She's So Fine\\" was released as the first single from the upcoming album on 30 October, after which the band embarked on a 27-date tour of the UK and Ireland dubbed the \\"Static Discharge Tour\\", which included two shows supporting Aerosmith at the NEC Arena in Birmingham. \\"Dirty Love\\" was released in February 1990 and entered the UK Singles Chart at number 40, before peaking the following week at number 32. The band's debut album Backstreet Symphony was released on 5 March and entered the UK Albums Chart at its peak position of number 21. By 1991, it had been certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Note: User must manually define search parameter as \\"Thunder\\" and click the 'Search' button in order to yield results. Four more tracks from Backstreet Symphony were later issued as singles ‚Äì the title track, \\"Gimme Some Lovin'\\", a reissue of \\"She's So Fine\\", and \\"Love Walked In\\" ‚Äì all of which reached the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. Writing for Classic Rock magazine in 2002, journalist Dave Ling claimed that the album was \\"greeted with critical rapture\\", calling it \\"one of the all-time great hard rock debuts\\". AllMusic's Alex Henderson, however, proposed that while the record \\"wasn't lacking when it came to spirit and enthusiasm\\", it displayed Thunder as \\"[not] the most original or groundbreaking band in the world\\". Backstreet Symphony was featured at number 7 on the Kerrang! \\"Albums of the Year\\" feature for 1990, and in 2008 was voted by the magazine's readers to be the 84th best British rock album of all-time. Backstreet Symphony was promoted on a UK tour running from late February through until the end of March, after which Thunder travelled to the United States to perform a pair of shows for American media and meet with EMI's sister label Capitol Records, who had originally released the album in the US. According to journalist Mick Wall, who had been travelling with Thunder for a number of months, \\"Capitol in America were notorious at the time for not supporting acts signed to EMI in the UK\\", which resulted in the band splitting with the label shortly after their meeting. Thunder continued touring in support of their debut album, including a stint supporting Heart in April and May, and another supporting Love/Hate in July, both in Europe. On 18 August they performed for the first time at Monsters of Rock, which was headlined by Whitesnake. After splitting with Capitol earlier in the year, the band signed a US deal with Geffen Records in September, who reissued Backstreet Symphony with a new cover the following April. In June 1991, the album peaked at number 114 on the Billboard 200. Singles \\"Dirty Love\\" and \\"Love Walked In\\" reached number 10 and number 31, respectively, on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. 1991‚Äì1996: UK chart success and bassist change After continuing to promote their debut album Backstreet Symphony in various regions around the world throughout 1991, Thunder began recording their second studio album on 3 February 1992 at Outside Studios, which was later mixed at AIR Studios in June. The band worked with producer Andy Taylor again, although the album was co-produced by Luke Morley. In July 1992, the band supported Iron Maiden on a tour of South America which visited Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, before they performed at Monsters of Rock for the second time the following month, which was also headlined by Iron Maiden. Also in August, \\"Low Life in High Places\\" was released as the first single from the band's second album, reaching number 22 on the UK Singles Chart, before Laughing on Judgement Day itself was released and debuted at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart ‚Äì the band's highest album chart position to date. The album was Thunder's second release to receive a gold certification from the BPI, which it did in January 1993. Later singles \\"Everybody Wants Her\\", \\"A Better Man\\" and \\"Like a Satellite\\" all registered on the UK Singles Chart top 40 (\\"A Better Man\\" peaked at number 18, the highest UK Singles Chart position for the band to date). Thunder embarked on their Laughing All Over the World Tour on 1 October 1992, beginning with a run of 19 headline shows in the UK supported by Australian band The Screaming Jets. The band saw the year out supporting Extreme on a European tour in November, followed by a short run of dates in Japan in December. By the end of the year, Luckhurst had left the band. Morley has revealed that Luckhurst was sacked from the group, due to an incident in which the bassist threw a birthday cake at photographer Ross Halfin, after he requested for photos of only Morley and Bowes together. He was replaced the following February by Swedish bassist Mikael \\"Micke\\" H√∂glund, who was selected from a number of auditionees for the role including former Terraplane member Nick Linden, who claims he \\"got down to the last two candidates\\". The band continued touring throughout the rest of 1993, including a number of festival appearances in the summer, and later toured as their alter egos \\"Danny & the Doo Wops\\". For their third studio album (and first with H√∂glund), Thunder primarily recorded at Southern Tracks in Atlanta and Rumbo Recorders in Los Angeles, with additional sessions taking place at Jacobs Studios in Farnham, Surrey, Armoury Studios in the Canadian city of Vancouver, British Columbia, and the Record Plant in Los Angeles, where the album was also mixed. Mike Fraser, who had previously engineered and mixed Backstreet Symphony, produced the album alongside Morley. \\"Stand Up\\" was released as the album's lead single in December 1994, peaking at number 23 on the UK Singles Chart. Behind Closed Doors followed on 23 January 1995, reaching a peak position of number 5 on the UK Albums Chart and receiving a silver certification from the BPI. \\"River of Pain\\" was issued as the album's second single in February, reaching number 31 in the UK, followed by \\"Castles in the Sand\\" in April which reached number 30. In June 1995, the band won the Kerrang! Award for Best British Live Act. The Behind Closed Doors Tour commenced in Germany on 5 April 1995 and included shows in Europe, the UK and Japan, wrapping up on 1 September in Tokyo. Later that month, the band released their first compilation album, The Best of Thunder: Their Finest Hour (And a Bit), promoted by the new song \\"In a Broken Dream\\" which reached number 26 on the UK Singles Chart and topped the UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart. The album reached number 22 on the UK Albums Chart, number 3 on the UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart (behind AC/DC's Ballbreaker and One Hot Minute by Red Hot Chili Peppers), and was certified silver by the BPI. The compilation was promoted on the Their Finest Set (And a Bit) Tour, which included five shows in five UK cities between 27 September and 2 October. 1996‚Äì2002: Second bassist change and breakup Chris Childs replaced Mikael \\"Micke\\" H√∂glund on bass in 1996, and remains with the band to the current day. Morley, Matthews and James began writing new material with producer Taylor in January 1996, before entering the studio to record their fourth studio album in April. The album would be the band's first on their own B Lucky label, distributed by Castle Communications, with whom they signed in February that year. Recording took place at Rockfield Studios in Monmouthshire, Wales and saw Morley handling bass duties in addition to guitar due to the absence of H√∂glund as a result of \\"family commitments\\". The album was completed by the end of May, after which H√∂glund announced that he was to leave Thunder permanently; he was replaced in the autumn by Chris Childs, formerly of Then Jericho. The Thrill of It All was released in Japan on 1 September 1996 through JVC, but was delayed elsewhere due to Matthews's diagnosis of tendinitis, which prevented him from playing guitar. The album was eventually released outside of Japan in February 1997, reaching number 14 on the UK Albums Chart. After a Japanese run in January, the Thrill of It All UK Tour started in February and was followed by European dates in March; additional UK shows postponed due to Matthews's injury were rescheduled for April. Some UK dates were pushed back due to Bowes suffering pneumonia and laryngitis, and in July he underwent surgery on his knee which signalled a short break for the group, during which time Childs and James featured in the rock musical Carnaby Street, while Morley toured with Taylor's band The Power Station. Thunder signed with Eagle Records in November 1997, who would release the band's first live album, simply titled Live, the following February. The album reached number 35 on the UK Albums Chart and spawned the top 40 single \\"The Only One\\". Live was recorded over the course of four shows in Wolverhampton and London between 12 and 16 November 1997, and were promoted on European and UK tours (in addition to a run supporting Status Quo) in the spring of 1998. The band also returned to the studio in April 1998 to record their fifth studio album Giving the Game Away. The first preview of the album was released in the form of the single \\"Play That Funky Music\\" in June, which reached the UK Singles Chart top 40. \\"Just Another Suicide\\" (renamed \\"You Wanna Know\\" for the UK release) was issued as the second single from the album in March 1999, reaching number 49 on the UK Singles Chart, followed a week later by the album which reached the same position on the UK Albums Chart. The band toured the UK in promotion of the album through May and early June, before announcing later in the year that they were due to break up, issuing a statement which outlined that \\"After a great deal of exploration, discussion and soul searching, we have decided to split up. The reasons are many and complex, but to cut a long story short, we feel we have no choice. We must stress that this decision is due to outside business forces and not down to any personal or musical differences within the band.\\" Speaking about the decision to disband Thunder, Bowes explained that \\"It was a matter of simple economics. We were finding it increasingly hard to find a record company that would allow us to compete\\", while Morley added that \\"There was no way to expand\\". The UK Farewell Tour ran through December 1999, followed by a run in Japan the following March. The final Thunder show took place on 4 May at Dingwalls in London, and featured an acoustic set followed by a regular \\"electric\\" set. The final show was recorded for the live album They Think It's All Over... It Is Now, which was released in July 2000; the acoustic set was also later issued as They Think It's All Acoustic... It Is Now in May 2001. After Thunder's breakup, Morley released his debut solo album El Gringo Retro in March 2001, Bad Influence featuring James and Childs released their second studio album One Way Love in May 2001, James joined Magnum in February 2002, and Bowes and Morley released an album together entitled Moving Swiftly Along in May 2002, under the name \\"Bowes & Morley\\". 2002‚Äì2009: Reformation and second active spell In July 2002, it was announced that Thunder would be reuniting for a series of shows in November marketed under the Monsters of Rock brand. In a post online, Bowes confirmed the news, which had been leaked without permission, but reiterated that it would be \\"a non permanent reformation\\" which the band agreed to \\"as it gives us the ability to play again without having to commit to anything long-term\\". The band also began recording a new studio album in October, and in December formed their own record label, STC Recordings. STC stands for \\"Straight Talk Company\\", as Bowes says \\"I give you the news the same way; whether it's good or bad, I give it to you straight\\". Shooting at the Sun received a limited release online in March, and was later released throughout Europe in August by Frontiers Records. The album did not register on the UK Albums Chart, but did spawn the UK Singles Chart top 50 single \\"Loser\\". The band toured in promotion of the album throughout much of the rest of 2003, and early 2004. Thunder recorded their seventh studio album between June and August 2004, as well as playing a number of European festivals in July. The album was recorded at Chapel Studios in South Thoresby, produced by Morley and engineered and mixed by Rupert Coulson. In November the band supported Deep Purple alongside Peter Frampton on a tour of the UK, before \\"I Love You More Than Rock 'n' Roll\\" was released as a single and reached number 27 on the UK Singles Chart. The Magnificent Seventh was released in the UK on 21 February 2005 and a day later in Europe, debuting at number 70 on the UK Albums Chart and number 5 on the UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart. The album was released a month later in Japan, and in mid-April internationally on iTunes. The Magnificent Seventh Tour started in the UK in March, followed by European dates in April and June, a Japanese leg running into July, a second string of shows in Europe in December, and a return to the UK the following January. The band's eighth studio album, Robert Johnson's Tombstone, followed in October 2006, peaking at number 56 on the UK Albums Chart. The album's only single, \\"The Devil Made Me Do It\\", was the group's 18th (and to date, latest) single to reach the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. Touring for the album commenced in the UK in November, followed by European shows in March 2007, a number of festival appearances in the summer, and three dates in Japan in September. In October 2007, the band released the first in a series of extended plays (EPs) ‚Äì Six of One... ‚Äì which featured three previously unreleased studio tracks and three live recordings from the UK tour the previous November. The follow-up, ...Half a Dozen of the Other, was issued in April 2008 and also featured three studio tracks and three live recordings. The third and final EP of the trilogy, The Joy of Six, was issued alongside the band's ninth studio album Bang! on 3 November 2008. The album reached number 62 on the UK Albums Chart. In January 2009, after a short UK tour promoting Bang!, it was announced that Thunder were due to split up again. The band released a statement which explained that \\"we've found ourselves becoming increasingly busy with our various activities outside of the band, and we've come to the conclusion that there are simply not enough hours in the day to fit it all in\\", adding that they would complete scheduled tours in Europe in February and Japan in April, as well as adding a final run of UK shows in July. The final show of the UK tour, at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, was documented on the live video album At the End of the Road: Live in London, 11th July 2009 released later in the year. The band's final shows took place at Rock of Ages and Sonisphere Festival on 31 July and 1 August, respectively. 2009‚Äìpresent: Hiatus, returns and recent events After Thunder's breakup, Morley formed The Union with former Winterville frontman Peter Shoulder, while Childs also joined on bass. The band released their self-titled debut album in August 2010, which debuted at number 77 on the UK Albums Chart. Subsequent albums Siren's Song (2011) and The World Is Yours (2013) each charted in the UK top 100. Bowes and James featured on former Bad Company guitarist Dave \\"Bucket\\" Colwell's debut solo album Guitars, Beers & Tears (credited to \\"Bucket & Co.\\") ‚Äì James performed drums on the whole album, while Bowes performed vocals on the song \\"Life\\". James also continued to record and tour with Magnum, who released the studio album The Visitation in 2011 which reached number 55 on the UK Albums Chart. In February 2011, it was announced that Thunder would reunite for a performance at the High Voltage Festival on 24 July, although Bowes made it clear that \\"there's no plan to do any other recording going forwards\\", while Morley reiterated that it was a \\"one-off reunion\\". Following the festival, however, the band announced that they would perform another show on 21 December at Rock City in Nottingham, while Bowes and Matthews would also perform a short run of six \\"intimate sit down shows\\" the following February. A second show at Rock City was later added the day after the first. Both shows were documented on the live albums Rock City 12: The Baubles Are Back in Town and The Xmas Show 2011, released in 2012. Another pair of shows in December followed a year later, this time at the Manchester Academy, with the band committing to annual Christmas shows in the future. The band supported Journey and Whitesnake on tour in May 2013, as well as performing at a number of summer festivals. In May 2014, Thunder announced that they were due to record their first studio album since 2008. A statement released by a spokesperson for the band stated that \\"after what has been a rather silly amount of knob-twiddling and string-pulling, I'm happy to report that they've decided to record a new studio album\\". Responding to the question over the band's \\"change of heart\\" regarding the possibility of new material, Bowes commented that they decided to record a new album after receiving an \\"overwhelming response\\" from fans when they supported Journey and Whitesnake the previous year. Sessions for the album took place at Rockfield Studios in Wales, with Morley producing the record. Much of the album was recorded without the involvement of Matthews, who was going through treatment for throat cancer at the time. Wonder Days was released in February 2015, and became the first Thunder album to reach the UK Albums Chart top ten since 1995's Behind Closed Doors, when it peaked at number 9. The album was voted the 11th best of 2015 by Classic Rock magazine, while the publication ranked the title track as the fifth best song of the year. Thunder were also named Best British Band at Planet Rock's end-of-year awards. The band toured extensively in promotion of Wonder Days, including three UK arena shows in March alongside Reef and Tax the Heat, numerous festival appearances in the summer, a run of European shows in November (including one of the first in Paris, France following the November 2015 attacks), and five arena shows with Terrorvision and King King in February 2016. Later in the year, the group released their first career-retrospective book Giving the Game Away: The Thunder Story, written by Joel McIver. The book was launched at the Louder Than Words Festival in Manchester on 12 November 2016, where the band performed a short acoustic set and spoke with McIver live. The follow-up to Wonder Days was announced in December to be Rip It Up, which would be released the following February and supported by a UK tour starting in March. The album reached number 3 on the UK Albums Chart, marking the highest position achieved by the band since Laughing on Judgement Day reached number 2 in 1992. Thunder performed their first shows ever in Australia shortly after the album's release, before returning to Europe in April for a string of dates. On 1 December 2017 the band released the single \\"Christmas Day\\", including a re- recorded version of \\"Love Walked In\\" and acoustic recordings of \\"Low Life in High Places\\" and \\"Heartbreak Hurricane\\". In October 2018, the band announced a new album with UK tour dates scheduled for February. Please Remain Seated was released through new label BMG on 18 January 2019, with \\"twelve radically reworked re-recordings of songs from their 30 year career\\" and has been described as \\"a more quiet album, taking in influences from rock, blues, country, jazz and soul\\".

The station is owned-and-operated by The Walt Disney Company and is the flagship station of the ESPN Radio network, primarily carrying the national network lineup. The station has its studios on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and its transmitter site is located in North Bergen, New Jersey. In 2012, ESPN Radio programming, including local programming, shifted to FM via WEPN-FM (which ESPN took over under a local marketing agreement with Emmis Communications). After a transitional simulcast period, WEPN 1050 switched to ESPN Radio's Spanish-language sister network ESPN Deportes Radio, carrying its national programming, as well as local sports talk and play-by-play coverage in the language. The ESPN Deportes Radio network was discontinued on September 9, 2019; since then, time-slots previously held by ESPN Deportes Radio's national programs have since been filled by part-time simulcasts of WEPN-FM's English-language programming, as well as national ESPN Radio programming. WEPN also broadcasts most New York Islanders games. History The 1050 frequency has a long history prior to this format. Starting in the 1920s as WHN, it played a diversified format. It was renamed WMGM in the late 1940s, continuing the same format until a switch to rock & roll in the late 1950s and early 1960s. As WHN again, it played adult standards in the 1960s and country music in the 1970s and 1980s (the format it was best known for). In the late 1980s as WFAN it was the original frequency for the very successful first of its kind all-sports station. Then began a truly convoluted set of ownership, call letter, and format changes from the Spanish language WUKQ to WEVD, a low-rated brokered station in the 1990s, to today's incarnation as WEPN. WHN (1922‚Äì1948) Originally owned by the Ridgewood Times newspaper, WHN was one of the first radio stations in New York City, going on the air on March 18, 1922, at AM frequency 833. Original shows included children's programming. In March 1924, the station was sued by AT&T;, which claimed that WHN failed to pay it for a commercial broadcasting license.Doerksen, Clifford J. (2011). American Babel: Rogue Radio Broadcasters of the Jazz Age. University of Pennsylvania Press. Chapter 2. Retrieved August 21, 2018.Jaker, Bill; Sulek, Frank; Kanze, Peter (2008). The Airwaves of New York: Illustrated Histories of 156 AM Stations in the Metropolitan Area, 1921‚Äì1996. McFarland & Company. p. 83-88. Retrieved August 21, 2018. However, public opinion turned against AT&T;, with the public beginning to view AT&T; as a monopolist, and AT&T; began to fear an antitrust investigation. AT&T; backed away from its lawsuit and agreed to settle out of court, with WHN paying $1,500 for a patent license. AT&T; never again sued a broadcaster for failing to pay it for a commercial broadcasting license. The station played jazz and contemporary dance music, including Sophie Tucker, Fletcher Henderson, and Duke Ellington, as well as broadcasting Columbia University football games. In 1928 the station was bought by the Loew's Theatre Organization. During the 1920s the station's frequency changed to 830, 760, and then 1010.History Cards for WEPN, fcc.gov. Retrieved August 21, 2018. In the 1930s it broadcast the Major Bowes Amateur Hour, which was picked up by the CBS Radio Network. In 1933, WHN became a full-time station when it acquired the licenses of WRNY and WQAO-WPAP with approval by the Federal Radio Commission on January 31 and February 3, respectively. WHN made its final frequency change to 1050 in 1941. During the 1940s the programs Radio Newsreel and Newsreel Theater were prototypes for what later became the all-news radio format. The station broadcast Brooklyn Dodgers games with Red Barber as well as the New York Giants and New York Rangers with Marty Glickman. WMGM (1948‚Äì1962) On September 15, 1948, the station changed its call letters to WMGM, reflecting Loew's then-ownership of movie studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The station had a diversified format that included pop standard hits, drama, talk, and sports, and briefly featured New York talk host Barry Gray. In the mid-to-late-1950s the station switched to playing Top 40 rock and roll hits, which covered a broad spectrum of music. The '50s brand of Top 40 played by WMGM and its competitors included what might today be considered rhythm and blues and country music, in addition to popular instrumentals (Percy Faith's 1960 \\"Theme from A Summer Place\\" and Acker Bilk's 1962 \\"Stranger on the Shore\\" hit the top of the charts during this era). WMGM was overall more up-tempo than the competition, featuring artists like Elvis Presley, Fats Domino, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Frankie Lymon, the Crystals, the Tokens, Ray Charles, Dinah Washington, Brook Benton, Ricky Nelson, and Bill Haley. Playlists were narrower and more predictable than mainstream MOR stations'. WMGM's deejay lineup included morning man Ted Brown and the Redhead (Ted's then-wife Rhoda), Jerry Marshall, Peter Tripp, Norm Stevens, Dick Shepherd, Bob Lewis, Ed Stokes and Bob Callen. Among its newsreaders were Bill Edmunds, Dick DeFrietas and Aime Govin. During its Top 40 incarnation, WMGM was for a time home to New York Yankees baseball with Mel Allen, Red Barber and Phil Rizzuto. Ex-athletes Marty Glickman and Gussie Moran worked Yankees pre- and post-game shows from the studio. WMGM had a theme song incorporating the names of many of its DJs in the 1960s. The words were: > He was a US Marshal and Jerry was his name. So they called him Jerry > Marshall and widespread was his fame. He went to catch the outlaws, Bob > Callen and Ted Brown Who were roping old Dick Shephard's sheep and herding > them to town. Sing a song about Western hero men will never ride the range > again. They're on 1050 WMGM. By 1962, with 1010 WINS, 770 WABC, and 570 WMCA also playing predominantly rock and roll music, WMGM-1050 was sold by Loew's to Storer Communications, which owned mostly TV stations, but also owned WIBG, a rock and roll radio station less than away in Philadelphia. WHN again (1962‚Äì1987) Storer immediately dropped Top 40 for slow-paced standards and beautiful music, the province of much of FM radio at the time. The station was renamed WHN again on February 28, 1962, with special permission of the FCC. (Three-letter call sign sets are a rarity and have not been issued to broadcast stations since the early 1930s, let alone those on the AM band; WHN, WGH in Newport News, Virginia and KHJ in Los Angeles are the only known AM stations that have been able to revert to their original three-letter calls. The WHK callsign in Cleveland returned to its longtime home on 1420 after a few years' absence, but owner Salem Communications had kept it active on other stations it owned.) Through the 1960s, WHN became New York City's Mutual Broadcasting System affiliate. On-air hosts included Jim Ameche, and early on, the comedy team of Bob Elliot and Ray Goulding (Bob and Ray). (Morning host Ted Brown remained with WHN for only a short time of transition, heading eventually to MOR WNEW. The station played vocalists such as Nat King Cole, Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Peggy Lee, Patti Page, and Johnny Mathis, plus a heavy dose of instrumentalist groups, notably Percy Faith, Al Hirt, Ray Conniff, and Henry Mancini. The station was about 75% vocal and 25% instrumental. Ratings were respectable, but the demographic was older by a generation or two. In 1968, WHN gradually began mixing in softer songs by artists like Elvis Presley, The Everly Brothers, The Beatles, The Association, and others with their easy listening format. Still, the ratings were below average. By 1970, the station had evolved into more of a MOR format and less of an easy listening format and by 1972 evolved into more of an adult contemporary format similar to what WNEW was then doing. WHN eventually picked up New York Mets baseball (with announcers Lindsey Nelson, Bob Murphy, and Ralph Kiner), after the team's original NYC flagship, WABC 770, dropped the rights. The station became a launching pad for the radio sports broadcasting career of Marv Albert, who hosted the \\"Interwoven Scoreboard\\" after Mets games and later on reintroduced New York fans to the Knicks and Rangers on radio. Initially, Rangers games were broadcast in small doses: the last two minutes of the first and second periods, then the entire third period. The entire metropolitan area enjoyed Red Holzman's miracle 1969‚Äì70 Knicks championship run, much of which was blacked out on TV. Overall though, WHN's ratings were still low. After a lot of research, on February 26, 1973, WHN became a country music station. The New York Metropolitan Area had never been a country music hot spot, and prior to WHN, the area had only had two country music stations: WJRZ in Hackensack, New Jersey and WTHE in Mineola, New York. In the early years of WHN's country format, it featured on-air personalities such as Larry Kenney, Big Wilson and Jack Spector. Some of these were holdovers from the previous middle of the road format. As a country music station, they played artists like Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Tanya Tucker, Lynn Anderson, Kenny Rogers, Mel Tillis, Charley Pride, Mickey Gilley, Ronnie Milsap, and many more. Also, they mixed in non-country and country-pop cross-over artists that had country- friendly songs such as The Eagles, Elvis Presley, Anne Murray, Olivia Newton- John, Linda Ronstadt, and others. Over the years, as WHN evolved as a country station, on-air personalities such as Dan Daniel, Alan Colmes, Jerry Carroll and others moved in. During this era, WHN was programmed by Ed Salamon, who was inducted into the Country Radio Hall of Fame in 2006. Salamon and promotional partner Dale Pon were able to walk the line between country music like Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, and latter day Elvis Presley, Top 40 radio programming tactics, and the late 70s rock artists ‚Äìincluding The Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, Olivia Newton-John, and Kenny Rogers‚Äì who had absorbed country into their contemporary pop‚Äì and, using extensive, award winning television and transit advertising, into one of the most successful Country radio stations in history.Fred Seibert dot com In the late 1970s, Mutual Radio bought WHN from Storer. In 1980, WHN got some competition when WRVR was sold to Viacom and dropped jazz for country and became WKHK (also known as \\"Kick 106 FM\\"). As a result, ratings went down for WHN. They added New York Mets baseball to their lineup in 1983. WHN had previously carried the Mets from 1972 until 1974. In 1984, WKHK became \\"Lite FM\\" WLTW, playing a soft adult- contemporary format. Without direct competition, WHN remained country, with decent ratings. In 1985 Doubleday Broadcasting bought WHN. In 1986 Emmis Communications bought WHN. Emmis added sports talk in the evenings, but kept the country format the rest of the day until 1987. In late April 1987, Emmis announced that WHN would drop country on July 1 for an all-sports format, the first of its kind on radio. They would drop the WHN calls and become WFAN (The Fan). In May, NBC announced that Adult Contemporary WYNY 97.1 (today's WQHT) would go country on July 1. Dan Taylor signed off WHN's 25-year history at 3 p.m. that day with \\"For The Good Times\\" by Ray Price. WFAN (1987‚Äì1988) The first voice heard on WFAN was that of Suzyn Waldman with a sports update at 3:00 pm, followed by the first show, which was hosted by Jim Lampley. Waldman would report for the station, covering the Yankees and Knicks, for 14 years. Other personalities that hosted shows besides Lampley in the 1050 kHz years included Bill Mazer, Pete Franklin, Greg Gumbel and Ed Coleman. WFAN also inherited broadcast rights to the defending World Series champion New York Mets from WHN, who had held the rights for several years. Ratings were low initially but gradually improved. In early 1988 General Electric, which now owned NBC through its purchase of RCA two years earlier, announced that it would sell off the NBC Radio division. In February of that year GE made a multi-station deal with Emmis and, in New York, the WNBC and WYNY licenses were included in the sale. This ended up giving Emmis control of four frequencies: 97.1-FM, 103.5-FM, 660-AM and 1050-AM, whereas duopolies were not permitted yet by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Emmis ended up moving their Dance/R&B; \\"Hot\\" format and call letters WQHT over to the 97.1 frequency (while selling the 103.5 facility and WYNY's intellectual property over to Westwood One, that station would later become WKTU in 1996), and then moved WFAN's format and call letters from 1050 to 660 on October 7, 1988, at 5:30 pm, replacing \\"66 WNBC\\" which signed off forever. WUKQ (1988‚Äì1989) As for the 1050 license, the Spanish Broadcasting System bought it, intending to swap it with cash to The Jewish Daily Forward for their FM station, WEVD 97.9. However, Spanish Broadcasting already owned WSKQ, AM 620 in Newark, New Jersey. The deal for WEVD could not be consummated at the same time as Emmis' purchase of 660, which left Spanish Broadcasting owning two AM stations in the New York market, which (as was the case with Emmis earlier) was not permitted under FCC rules at that time. The FCC granted them a temporary waiver to run 1050 on a noncommercial basis until it could be transferred. Therefore, following WFAN's move to 660, 620 WSKQ flipped from Spanish Adult Contemporary to Spanish Oldies while the 1050 facility became \\"KQ 1050\\" WUKQ, playing Spanish Adult Contemporary music (commercial-free, to satisfy the FCC requirement). For the first few hours after the switch of WFAN to the 660 facility, WUKQ broadcast a recorded message which was continuously looped stating: > \\"This is WUKQ-AM New York, operating at 1050 Kilohertz. If you're looking > for SportsRadio 1050, we've moved... down the dial to 66 AM. Join us now for > the new SportsRadio 66 WFAN.\\" WEVD (1989‚Äì2003) The FCC approved the trade of WUKQ for WEVD on February 1, 1989. Under the deal, the Spanish AC format on 620 would move to 97.9-FM, and the station would become FM-98 WSKQ-FM. Meanwhile, WEVD's call letters and programming moved to the 1050 facility. Dating back to October 20, 1927, WEVD had been the radio station owned by the Workman's Circle (Arbeter Ring) in New York City. Its call letters were a tribute to legendary Socialist Party leader Eugene Victor Debs, who died one year earlier. This was WEVD's second existence on the AM dial, as it was originally a time-share at 1330-AM with WPOW, an arrangement that lasted until 1984. WEVD soon added an FM counterpart at 107.5-FM in 1950, which then moved to 97.9-FM in 1952. Both stations maintained the same programming through the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. The AM station was sold on March 2, 1981, for $1.1 million to Salem Communications, and changed the call letters to WNYM (today WWRV) while WEVD continued on the FM dial. By 1988, the station was mostly an outlet for leased access foreign language programming. WEVD had a brokered format with Jewish programming (in Yiddish and English), ethnic programs, talk shows, and a big band show with Danny Stiles. The station generated cash flow by selling blocks of airtime, which allowed it to be profitable despite minimal ratings. By the mid-1990s, WEVD was branded as \\"News-Talk 1050 WEVD\\", and had a talk format with a liberal emphasis on weekdays, with ethnic programming at night and on weekends. Talk hosts included Bill Mazer, former New York mayor Ed Koch, Jay Diamond, and Alan Colmes. During most of 1050's existence as WEVD, the station broadcast Mets, Jets, Knicks and Rangers games produced by WFAN, when WFAN was already broadcasting another game. WFAN game overruns are now broadcast on WBBR. In 2001, WEVD entered into a local marketing agreement with ABC/Disney and added ESPN Radio's The Dan Patrick Show to the talk lineup. Despite a public campaign to save the old format, the LMA was signed into effect. During its final day on-air as \\"News-Talk 1050 WEVD\\", the outraged public campaign was subtly extended into the station's control room, as soon-to-be terminated staffers occasionally interrupted portions of the brokered programming with audio clips, some of which contained obscenities. On September 1, 2001, Alan Colmes was the last voice heard on WEVD closing out the station by giving out his web address, playing Steam's Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye, and said the last words similar to the last words he said on 66 WNBC in 1988 saying, \\"We thank you very much, thank you for listening and for the very last time, This is News-Talk 1050 WEVD New York\\". On September 2, 2001, at Midnight, WEVD began running ESPN Radio full-time, albeit having simulcast WABC's coverage of the September 11 attacks nine days later. The first local voice on 1050 ESPN Radio was Don La Greca. WEPN (2003‚Äìpresent) The call-sign was changed to WEPN on April 28, 2003, after being sold to ABC/Disney outright for $78 million. They continued to run the station as 1050 ESPN Radio. For years, WEPN billed itself as New York City's only all-sports station, since competitor WFAN's former morning show, Imus in the Morning, was primarily a politically based talk show. However, this is now a misnomer, since Don Imus has been replaced by a sports-themed show, Boomer and Carton in the Morning. Despite the fact that it is a 50,000 watt station, it cannot be heard clearly in many parts of the New York metropolitan area, especially west of New York City and in Suffolk County on Long Island. WEPN has a highly directional signal, due primarily to the fact that there is another 50,000 watt station on 1050, CHUM a few hundred miles to the northwest in Toronto, and yet another 50,000 watt station, KYW, in Philadelphia next door on the dial at 1060 AM, along with protecting the signal of Monterrey-based XEG in Northern Mexico to the southwest. thumbAccording to Arbitron data of as early 2006, WFAN's daytime ratings were about 3 points higher on average than WEPN's, though WFAN's most- known and now-defunct Mike and the Mad Dog show had been airing since 1989, or well over a decade longer than WEPN had existed. Because of WEPN's limited signal, all Jets games once were simulcast on WABC, which reaches more of the suburbs. The station had also worked with MSG Network to find affiliates for Knicks and Rangers games outside WEPN's coverage area. Newsday Watchdog Blog 09/2007 (broken link) Early in 2008, to strengthen the reach of WEPN, ESPN reached Local marketing agreements to simulcast WEPN on WLIR in Hampton Bays, extending WEPN's reach to eastern Long Island, and on WNJE in Flemington (for New Jersey's ESPN), extending WEPN's reach into the Skylands Region and the Trenton market. WNJE broadcast the WEPN signal full-time. WLIR broke off the simulcast in the summer of 2011 when the station was sold to a religious broadcaster. WNJE ended the simulcast with WEPN on December 3, 2012. There were also partnerships with Syracuse University and the United States Military Academy to air college football games, but those usually aired on former sister stations WABC or WQEW due to scheduling conflicts. WEPN had overflow agreements with WNYM and WWRL, the former airing Knicks or Rangers games that overlapped with each other or with the Jets and the latter airing when there were two overlapping games. =Bidding for baseball= WEPN-AM was expected to bid for the radio rights for either the New York Yankees, at the time on WCBS (AM), or New York Mets, from their longtime home of WFAN. Both teams had contracts that expired at the end of the 2013 season, with the Yankees purposely extending their deal with WCBS to expire at the same time as the Mets, for better leverage. It had been reported that WEPN-AM had been looking to move to a stronger frequency to accommodate having a Major League Baseball team full-time. Yanks Re-Up with WCBS + Sterling/Waldman for 2012 Ultimately the Yankees moved to WFAN, displacing the Mets, who signed on with WOR. =ESPN Deportes Radio= Logo for ESPN Deportes Radio Nueva York 1050 AM. On April 26, 2012, Disney announced a 12-year lease of Emmis Communications' 98.7 WRKS, under which WEPN's programming would transition to FM, and the AM signal would be converted to a new Spanish-language sports format as part of the ESPN Deportes Radio network by mid-September 2012 (to coincide with National Hispanic Heritage Month). The transition began on April 30 when WRKS, now christened as WEPN-FM, began to simulcast WEPN's AM signal as 98.7 ESPN New York. WEPN broke away from the simulcast on September 7, 2012, and re- launched as promised as ESPN Deportes Nueva York. On launch, the station carried the national lineup of the network, and local morning and afternoon drive shows (Firma ESPN and Zona ESPN NY). The station also acquired Spanish- language rights to the New York Jets. On December 13, 2012, ESPN announced that it had acquired the rights to the Spanish-language broadcasts of the Mets, starting with the 2013 season. ESPN deportes Radio Nueva York 1050 AM to Broadcast New York Mets Games in 2013 On June 11, 2019, ESPN announced that it would be discontinuing the ESPN Deportes Radio network on September 8, 2019. It was stated that WEPN would switch back to an English-language sports format at this time. In September 2019, ESPN agreed to a two-year deal to carry at least 60 New York Islanders broadcasts; due to WEPN-FM's existing contracts with the Knicks and Rangers, most Islanders games are aired on 1050 AM, with select games on WEPN-FM, and previous flagship WRHU continuing to be the primary station for games not carried on either WEPN or WEPN-FM.

The atoms forming the wetting layer can be semimetallic elements/compounds or metallic alloys (for thin films). Wetting layers form when depositing a lattice-mismatched material on a crystalline substrate. This article refers to the wetting layer connected to the growth of self-assembled quantum dots (e.g. InAs on GaAs). These quantum dots form on top of the wetting layer. The wetting layer can influence the states of the quantum dot for applications in quantum information processing and quantum computation. Process The wetting layer is epitaxially grown on a surface using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The temperatures required for wetting layer growth typically range from 400-500 degrees Celsius. When a material A is deposited on a surface of a lattice-mismatched material B, the first atomic layer of material A often adopts the lattice constant of B. This mono-layer of material A is called the wetting layer. When the thickness of layer A increases further, it becomes energetically unfavorable for material A to keep the lattice constant of B. Due to the high strain of layer A, additional atoms group together once a certain critical thickness of layer A is reached. This island formation reduces the elastic energy. Overgrown with material B, the wetting layer forms a quantum well in case material A has a lower bandgap than B. In this case, the formed islands are quantum dots. Further annealing can be used to modify the physical properties of the wetting layer/quantum dot . Properties The wetting layer is a close-to mono-atomic layer with a thickness of typically 0.5 nanometers. The electronic properties of the quantum dot can change as a result of the wetting layer . Also, the strain of the quantum dot can change due to the wetting layer . NotesExternal Links *Wetting layer on arxiv.org *group website of M.

The phrase is widely used in sporting and educational contexts to express the theory that physical exercise is an important or essential part of mental and psychological well-being. History The phrase comes from Satire X of the Roman poet Juvenal (10.356). It is the first in a list of what is desirable in life: Traditional commentators believe that Juvenal's intention was to teach his fellow Roman citizens that in the main, their prayers for such things as long life are misguided. That the gods had provided man with virtues which he then lists for them. Over time and separated from its context, the phrase has come to have a range of meanings. It can be construed to mean that only a healthy mind can lead to a healthy body, or equally that only a healthy body can produce or sustain a healthy mind. Its most general usage is to express the hierarchy of needs: with physical and mental health at the root.

On air from 21 December 1952 (daily broadcasts did not take place until 11 October 1957) to 14 December 1990, Aktuelle Kamera was one of the main propaganda tools of the East German government.  Editorial line  Originally, Aktuelle Kamera was (at least by Eastern Bloc standards) fairly critical of the ruling Socialist Unity Party. This was because television was not considered part of the mass media at the time due to its limited reach. However, this changed when the television service reported accurately on the uprising in East Berlin on 17 June 1953. In the repression following the uprising, DFF's director was sacked. Afterwards, DFF/DDR-FS's newsroom was directly linked to the SED Politburo, and Aktuelle Kamera took on a similar look to its radio and newspaper counterparts. For most of the next 37 years, it had a marked pro- government bias and typically did not report on news that could potentially fuel anti-government sentiment. With few exceptions, stories promoted socialism and portrayed the West in a negative manner.  Schedule and popularity  Aktuelle Kamera's main edition was originally scheduled at 20:00 before being moved to 19:30 in the 1960s, so as not to coincide with the major West German newscasts, ZDF's heute at 19:00 and the ARD's Tagesschau at 20:00, both of which were widely watched in East Germany. The broadcast lasted 20 minutes until 1972 when it was expanded to a full half-hour. Aktuelle Kamera newscast as seen on a Rembrandt television set, made in East Germany in the 1950s-1960s. Starting in the mid-1970s, another 30-minute edition was presented on DDR2 (launched in 1969) around 21:30. Prior to that, both channels aired Aktuelle Kamera simultaneously at 19:30, then repeated the next morning when DDR1 signed on around 9:30 (later 8:30), before airing school- oriented programming, co-produced by the DDR-FS and the GDR Education Ministry. News summaries were added as the transmissions increased during the day. There was a bulletin at the end of the morning programmes (i.e. between 12:00 and 13:00) and another, the afternoon news update, at 17:00 on DDR1. DDR2's evening schedule always began with the news at 18:45 (later 17:45 and 18:55). Late newscasts didn't appear until the 1970s, when DDR1 screened a headline update following the magazine programmes, around 22:00. From the 1980s, Aktuelle Kamera's final round-up was the last scheduled programme at the end of the day. In fact, television audiences largely ignored Aktuelle Kamera, preferring to watch West German newscasts, like the ARD's Tagesschau. The East German authorities adopted the French colour standard SECAM rather than the PAL encoding used in the Federal Republic of Germany. The basic television standard remained the same. It did prevent reception in colour by native East German television sets though the majority of them were monochrome (black and white) anyway. East Germans responded by buying PAL decoders for their SECAM television sets. Eventually the government in East Berlin stopped paying attention to so-called Republikflucht via Fernsehen, or \\"defection via television\\" and from 1977 onwards permitted the sale of dual standard (PAL/SECAM) sets; the SECAM standard stopped being used in East Germany after reunification, instead using PAL as it had been in the West. Aktuelle Kamera served as an example for the Estonian newscast Aktuaalne Kaamera that was first aired in Eesti Televisioon on 11 March 1956. Aktuaalne Kaamera, even after several changes in format and Estonia becoming independent, still airs as a daily newscast there today.  Coverage during the last days of GDR  Starting in October 1989 almost a month before the fall of the Berlin Wall (9 November), Aktuelle Kamera loosened its fidelity to the party line and began presenting fair reports about the events transforming East Germany at the time. On 16 October, it showed its first pictures of the massive opposition rallies taking place every Monday in Leipzig. Within two days of its historic coverage of the Monday demonstrations in East Germany, AK broadcast highlights of the dramatic October SED plenum that saw the mass removal of the party leadership and of several members of its Central Committee. On 30 October 1989, Aktuelle Kamera on DDR2 was rebranded as AK Zwo. Three months later, long after the Berlin Wall fell but before German reunification, AK Zwo's theme and graphics were carried over to Aktuelle Kamera versions on the DFF1 (the former DDR1) on 12 March 1990. The 12:50 newscast was from then known as AK am Mittag (\\"CC at Midday\\") and the main broadcast at 19:30 became AK am Abend (\\"CC Evening\\"). News summaries received the generic name of AK- Nachrichten (simply \\"CC-News\\") or AK-Kurznachrichten. The 1990 editions featured highlights of the events on the eve of national reunification (2‚Äì3 October) and on the day itself. Fate after Reunification The last AK am Abend was anchored by Wolfgang Meyer on 14 December 1990 at 19:30, while the last newscast as Aktuelle Kamera was anchored by Petra Kusch-L√ºck at 1:00 on DFF1. The following day, DFF's newscasts were re-titled Aktuell (\\"Current\\"). East German television was reduced to one channel, after DFF1 folded, its transmitters becoming part of the Erstes Deutsches Fernsehen (now Das Erste) network. On 1 January 1992 at 0:00 (midnight), the former DFF2 was regionalised and incorporated into the ARD as the regional channel (\\"Dritte Programme\\" - \\"Third programme\\") for the \\"New L√§nder\\" under the names of Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk Fernsehen (Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia), ORB- Fernsehen (Brandenburg, later merged with Sender Freies Berlin to form Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg on 1 May 2003) and N3 (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern).  In popular culture  The 2003 film Good Bye, Lenin!, about a woman who falls into a coma before the Berlin Wall comes down and does not emerge until several months hence, features Aktuelle Kamera as a plot point. The film deals with how her children create a \\"DDR in her bedroom\\", doing such things as putting food in old jars, wearing old clothes‚Äîand showing AK tapes heavily. One of the first things protagonist Alex's friend Denis does is get tapes of old East German shows: \\"about 30 Aktuelle Kamera, 11 Der schwarze Kanal, six of Ein Kessel Buntes (shown in subtitles as \\"that variety show you mentioned\\"), and three or four of Everyday Life in the West.\\" When Alex said that his mother would notice that the news was old, his friend replied that \\"they're all the same old crap, anyway.\\" Denis, an amateur filmmaker, even goes as far to produce fake newscasts that say that West Germans were streaming into the DDR to avoid neo-Nazi groups and unemployment, not the other way round.

It is mostly a high altitude mountain tree, growing at ‚Äì altitude, rarely lower in the northwest of the range; in many areas it reaches the alpine tree line. Description  foreshortened Picea engelmannii is a medium-sized to large evergreen tree growing to ‚Äì tall, exceptionally to tall, and with a trunk diameter of up to . The bark is thin and scaly, flaking off in small circular plates 5‚Äì10 cm across. The crown is narrow conic in young trees, becoming cylindric in older trees. The shoots are buff-brown to orange-brown, usually densely pubescent, and with prominent pulvini. The leaves are needle-like, 15‚Äì30 mm long, rhombic in cross-section, glaucous blue-green above with several thin lines of stomata, and blue-white below with two broad bands of stomata. The cones are pendulous, slender cylindrical, 4‚Äì8 cm long and 1.5 cm broad when closed, opening to 3 cm broad. They have thin, flexible scales 15‚Äì20 mm long, with a wavy margin. They are reddish to dark purple, maturing pale brown 4‚Äì7 months after pollination. The seeds are black, 2‚Äì3 mm long, with a slender, 5‚Äì8 mm long pale brown wing. Distribution Engelmann spruce extends northward at higher elevations in the Cascade, Monashee, Selkirk, and possibly the Rocky Mountains, as well as the highlands surrounding the Interior Plateau. Seedling Survival Both water uptake and water stored in roots appear to be critical for the survival of subalpine Engelmann spruce saplings that are exposed above the snowpack in later winter-early spring.Boyce, R.L. and Lucero, S.A. 1999. Role of roots in winter water relations of Engelmann spruce saplings. Tree Physiol. 19:893‚Äì898. Transpiration is greatly reduced in small saplings while engulfed in snowpack. For exposed trees, the availability of soil water may be critical in late winter, when transpirational demands increase. Increased rates of transpiration in response to loss of snowpack, coupled with low sapwood water reserves and an extended period of soil frost in windswept areas, may prevent Engelmann spruce from regenerating in open areas both above and below the tree line. Cuticular damage by windblown ice is probably more important at the tree line,Hadley, J.L.; Smith, W.K. 1983. Influence of wind exposure on needle desiccation and mortality for timberline conifers in Wyoming, USA. Arctic Alpine Res. 15:127‚Äì135. (Cited in Coates et al. 1994).Hadley, J.L.; Smith, W.K. 1986. Wind effects on needles of timberline conifers seasonal influence on mortality. Ecology 67:12‚Äì19. Cited in Coates et al. 1994). but damage caused by desiccation is likely to be more important at lower elevations.  Subspecies and hybrids  Two geographical subspecies (treated as varieties by some authors, and as distinct species by others) occur: *Picea engelmannii subsp. engelmannii (Engelmann spruce). All of the range except as below. *Picea engelmannii subsp. mexicana (Mexican spruce). Two isolated populations on high mountains in northern Mexico, on the Sierra del Carmen in Coahuila (Sierra Madre Oriental) and on Cerro Mohinora in Chihuahua (Sierra Madre Occidental). Engelmann spruces of the Madrean sky islands mountains in the extreme southeast of Arizona and southwest of New Mexico also probably belong to this subspecies, though this is disputed. The Engelmann spruce hybridises and intergrades extensively with the closely related white spruce (Picea glauca), found further north and east in the Rocky Mountains, and to a lesser extent with the closely related Sitka spruce where they meet on the western fringes of the Cascades.  Uses  Engelmann spruce is of economic importance for its wood, harvested for paper-making and general construction. Wood from slow-grown trees at high altitude has a specialised use in making musical instruments such as acoustic guitars, harps, violins, and pianos. It is also used to a small extent as a Christmas tree. Predators Outbreaks of spruce beetles have destroyed millions of Engelmann spruce trees.

The highway parallels the Interstate 75 (I-75) corridor between St. Ignace and Sault Ste. Marie. The road is called Mackinac Trail after the Upper Peninsula branch of an Indian trail used before European settlers reached the area. Originally, the roadway was built as a section of US Highway 2 (US 2) before being added to the CDH system in the 1970s. H-63 serves as a two-lane alternative to the I-75 freeway across the eastern end of the Upper Peninsula. Between the northern side of St. Ignace, the roadway has connections to two state highways before running concurrently with M-48 near Rudyard. H-63 ends on the south side of Sault Ste. Marie. Route description H-63 starts a winding trail at Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75) north of St. Ignace in rural Mackinac County. From there, the highway heads northward towards the Kewadin Casino. The road then passes within viewing distance of I-75 past the Horseshoe Bay Wilderness. As it continues, H-63 has a connection to the southern terminus of M-123 with access to I-75 via a connecting road to M-123. After crossing to the west side of I-75, H-63 has access to I-75 via a connecting road to the western terminus of M-134. The CDH runs to the north and into Chippewa County. As it does so, H-63 turns away from I-75 as the latter curves northeastward. South of Rudyard and into center of the community, H-63 runs concurrently with M-48 for about . From Rudyard northward, H-63 turns northeasterly toward, and runs parallel to, I-75. At Kinross, there is an interchange between I-75 and M-80; H-63 has a brief concurrency with M-80 so that the latter can connect to all of the ramps in the interchange. The trail then crosses to the eastern side of I-75. Near Dafter, the CDH intersects M-28. Along this section, H-63 is roughly a half mile (0.8 km) away from the I-75 freeway at any given point as it continues northward to the Sault Ste. Marie area. H-63 terminates at its intersection with Business Spur I-75 (BS I-75) on the south side of the city. History The first transportation route in the area was the Mackinac Trail, used by Native Americans before the Europeans arrived in the area; the trail in the area was the Upper Peninsula branch of a longer route that also connected the modern-day Saginaw with Mackinaw City and the Straits of Mackinac. Until 1933, no roadway was built along the path of the Indian trail. After that year, US 2 was rerouted between St. Ignace and Sault Ste. Marie using the modern routing of H-63. This placed the Mackinac Trail on the state trunkline highway system for the first time. In 1962 and 1963, the state transferred the highway to county control when US 2 was rerouted to follow the completed I-75 freeway. With the transfer to local control, Mackinac Trail became a county road. Later, it was given the H-63 designation after October 5, 1970 as part of the County-Designated Highway System. The designation on the 1971 state map follows the routing used today.

The story was originally written by Maurice Hurley but went under numerous re-writes by the show's creator Gene Roddenberry. The episode was directed by Cliff Bole, and saw the return of John de Lancie as Q. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, Q returns to the USS Enterprise following his original encounter with the crew in \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\". Q transports the bridge crew to a landscape where they are attacked by humanoids and grants Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) the powers of a member of the Q Continuum, which he is forced to use to resurrect both Worf (Michael Dorn) and Wesley (Wil Wheaton). Riker promises never to use the powers again, but after a rescue mission he breaks down and grants each of the bridge crew a wish, which they refuse, with Riker subsequently rejecting his new powers. Q is recalled to the Continuum in failure. Writer Maurice Hurley requested that he be credited under the pseudonym C.J. Holland in protest against Roddenberry's re-writes, which he later regretted. The problems with the scripting of the episode changed the way the staff handled subsequent script developments for the series. Bole subsequently praised the abilities of de Lancie during the course of filming the episode. Reviewers thought that while the episode was predictable, the relationship between Q and Picard (Patrick Stewart) was praised, and \\"Hide and Q\\" received average overall scores. Plot The Enterprise is en route to Quadra Sigma to aid colonists caught in a methane explosion when Q re-appears and demands that they abandon their mission to compete in a game. He teleports Commander Riker and the bridge crew, with the exception of Captain Picard, to a barren landscape and appears in front of them whilst wearing a uniform of a Napoleonic era French marshal. He explains the rule of the game is to stay alive, and after Yar (Denise Crosby) refuses to compete, he transports her back to the bridge of the Enterprise in a \\"penalty box\\". Q returns to the bridge too, to talk Picard into setting a wager. He explains that the Q Continuum is testing Commander Riker to see if he is worthy of being granted their powers. Picard, having the utmost faith in his First Officer, takes the bet, as winning it would mean Q would get off their backs. Meanwhile, Riker and his team are attacked by what Lt. Worf reports as \\"vicious animal things\\" wearing French soldier's uniforms from the Napoleonic era and armed with muskets that fire energy bolts instead of the classic projectiles. Q returns to Riker and tells him that he has granted him the powers of the Continuum, and Riker promptly returns his crew mates to the ship but remains behind with Q to ultimately reject the powers. Q brings the crew back to the landscape, this time without their phasers and with Picard. The crew are attacked once more by the aliens, and both Worf and Wesley Crusher are killed. Riker uses the powers of the Q to return the crew again and bring both Worf and Wesley back to life. Riker makes a promise to Picard never to use the powers again and the ship arrives at Quadra Sigma. A rescue team beams down and discovers a young girl who has died. Riker is tempted to save her, but in the end he refuses to do so out of respect for his promise; however, he quickly shows signs of regret at this decision, which he expresses to the captain. Tension between Picard and his first officer grows as Riker now seems to be embracing his powers, and his behavior toward the crew begins to change. At Q's suggestion, and with Picard's blessing, Riker uses his powers to give his friends what he believes they want, turning Wesley into an adult, giving La Forge (LeVar Burton) his sight, and creating a Klingon female companion for Worf. All the recipients reject their gifts, however, with Data (Brent Spiner) even anticipating and declining Riker's attempt to make him human. Picard declares that Q has failed, and when Q attempts to go back on his word, he is forcibly recalled to the Continuum. Picard is pleased to see Q gone, and praises Riker for confirming his trust in his \\"Number One\\". Production The absence of her character in this and other episodes in season one led Marina Sirtis to believe she was being cut from the show. Writer Maurice Hurley requested that his contributions to this episode appear under the name of C.J. Holland because of the number of extensive re-writes by the show's creator Gene Roddenberry. Hurley later described the situation as a \\"misunderstanding\\" as the situation was subsequently resolved and proved to be a turning point for the series in how scripts were produced. Subsequently Roddenberry spent less time conducting detailed re-writes. Some of the elements of Hurley's original story expanded on the back story of Q's species, explaining that there were only three Qs but another hundred thousand residents on their planet who required relocation as the planet was dying. These elements didn't subsequently make it into any future episodes. The episode marked the return of John De Lancie as Q. Cliff Bole was returning as a director for the series, and knowing that de Lancie would appear as Q, Bole watched \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\" in order to maintain Q's tone. He found after shooting began that his research wasn't required as de Lancie slotted back into his previous role naturally.Nemecek (2003): p. 42 Bole later described the episode as \\"a lot of fun\\" and de Lancie as \\"a joy and a creative guy to work with\\". De Lancie would next return in the second season episode \\"Q Who\\". Meanwhile, the removal of the character of Deanna Troi from this episode alongside three other episodes made actress Marina Sirtis believe at the time that she was about to be cut from the show.Nemecek (2003): p. 28 Elaine Nalee guest starred as a female survivor, while William A. Wallace appeared as the adult Wesley Crusher. The theme of the episode, where a humanoid gains the powers of a god is a recurring theme from Star Trek: The Original Series, having featured in several episodes including the second pilot \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" and \\"Charlie X\\". The most similar episode from TOS is \\"Plato's Stepchildren\\", where the character Alexander also rejects god-like powers in a similar manner to Riker in \\"Hide and Q\\".Wagner, Lundeen (1998): p. 39 The premise would once again be revisited in the season six episode \\"True Q\\". Reception and home media release \\"Hide and Q\\" aired in broadcast syndication during the week commencing November 22, 1987. It received Nielsen ratings of 11.0, reflecting the percentage of all households watching the episode during its timeslot. This was higher than both the episodes broadcast before and afterwards. Several reviewers re-watched Star Trek: The Next Generation after the end of the series. Keith DeCandido for Tor.com thought that the plot was predictable, describing Riker being written as \\"so paint-by-numbers the color is practically dripping off the screen\\". He praised the relationship between Q and Picard, stating that de Lancie was having such \\"fun with the role that the episode itself is also fun despite its flaws\\". He gave \\"Hide and Q\\" a score of five out of ten. Zack Handlen re-watched the episode for The A.V. Club, and thought it was an example of where TNG avoided characterisation in favour of a morality play. He thought that the episode was a mess, with the highlights being Picard reciting Shakespeare and the Napoleonic monsters. He rated the episode as a C-. Star Trek: The Next Generation actor Wil Wheaton reviewed the episode for the Huffington Post after the end of the series, describing John de Lancie in his role of Q as \\"brilliant casting and masterful acting\\", and thought that overall the episode was reminiscent of the original series and had some good points. However he thought the script had the characters lecturing the viewer on occasion, based on the idea that ultimate power will lead to corruption. He gave the episode a score of B-. The first home media release of \\"Hide and Q\\" was on VHS cassette on July 1, 1992. The episode was later included in the Star Trek: The Next Generation season one DVD box set, released in March 2002, and in the Star Trek: Q DVD box set from the fan collection series of sets. It was released as part of the season one Blu-ray set on July 24, 2012.

Biography Parry was born in Gloucestershire, England, but moved to the United States with his parents in 1832, settling first in Washington County, New York. He studied medicine at Columbia University, and botany under John Torrey, Asa Gray and George Engelmann. He moved to Davenport, Iowa in 1846 where he practiced as a doctor for a short time before joining the United States and Mexican Boundary Survey (1848-1855) as surgeon and botanist. He made extensive plant collections along the U.S.-Mexico border in California, and later in Colorado, Utah and other western states, many of which proved to be new species. Important plants he discovered include the Torrey pine and Engelmann spruce, which he named in honour of his mentors. Several plants are also named after him, including the Parry Pinyon, Parry's Lily and Parry's Penstemon. In addition, the genera Neoparrya and Parryella were named in his honor.Mathias, Mildred E. 1929. Studies in the Umbelliferae II. Ann. Mo. Bot. Gard. 16:393-394, Plate 33.Gray, Asa. 1868.

It consists of four operating subsidiaries: Northern States Power-Minnesota, Northern States Power- Wisconsin, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service Co. In December 2018 Xcel Energy announced it would deliver 100 percent clean, carbon-free electricity by 2050, with an 80 percent carbon reduction by 2035 (from 2005 levels). This makes Xcel the first major US utility to set such a goal.  History  Xcel Energy was built on three companies: Minneapolis- based Northern States Power Company (NSP), Denver-based Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo), and Amarillo-based Southwestern Public Service (SPS). Southwestern Public Service Co. (SPS) dates its origins to 1904 and the Pecos Valley in New Mexico when Maynard Gunsell received an electricity franchise for the city of Roswell, New Mexico and its 2,000 residents. The financial strain of creating this new enterprise soon overwhelmed him and he sold the franchise to W.H. Gillenwater, who named his utility the Roswell Electric Light Co. He later sold the company to an investment firm in Cleveland, Ohio, which already owned the Roswell Gas Co. Northern States Power Company's timeline begins with the organization of the Washington County Light & Power Co. in 1909. When H. M. Byllesby began building his utility holding company across the Northwestern region of the US, he renamed it the Consumers Power Co. in 1910 and which was renamed the Northern States Power Co. in 1916. While the bulk of NSP's territory grew across central and southern Minnesota (starting from the Twin Cities), it acquired territory in North Dakota (centering on Fargo, Grand Forks, and Minot) and extended southwest into South Dakota (centering on Sioux Falls). NSP's system also extended east into Wisconsin, but because of utility ownership laws in that state, it was operated as an entity separate from the rest of the company. Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo) was formed in 1923 to provide an electric generating station for the Denver area. By 1924, it had acquired most of the electric companies in northern and central Colorado. Originally a subsidiary of Cities Service Company, it became an independent autonomous operation in November 1943.Public Service Company of Colorado history By this time, it served 80 percent of Colorado‚Äôs gas and electricity needs. As demand for energy continued to grow, so did PSCo. Eventually, the company merged with SPS to form New Century Energies (NCE) in 1995. Northern States Power and Wisconsin Energy Corporation had planned to merge into a new outfit that was to be called Primergy \\\\- but in 1997, the merger fell through because of the time it was taking to gain the required approvals from state and federal agencies. After the failed Primergy merger, NSP (both the Minnesota and Wisconsin companies) merged with New Century Energies to form Xcel Energy. In 2005, Xcel sold Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power to Black Hills Corporation. Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power had been a subsidiary of PSCo since the 1920s, and had become an operating company of NCE after the merger with SPS. The Cabin Creek Fire occurred on October 2, 2007 at Xcel Energy‚Äôs Hydropower Generation plant in Georgetown, Colorado. On June 1, 2011, Federal prosecutors opened their charges that Xcel Energy was criminally liable for the deaths of the five RPI workers. On June 28, the jury found Xcel Energy not guilty. On December 19, 2011, RPI Coating pleaded guilty to workplace safety violations and paid $1.55 million in a cash settlement. The company took responsibility for the deaths of five workers and the injuries to three. In December 2018, Xcel Energy became the first major US utility to pledge to go carbon-free, aiming for 80% carbon reduction by 2030, and 100% reduction by 2050. Utility industry magazine Utility Dive awarded Xcel Energy its 2018 \\"Utility of the Year\\" award for its plans for add 12 wind farms, its project with Google to develop new ways for customers to personalize energy management, and its plan to retire 50 percent of its coal-powered capacity by 2026 (and replacing it with a combination of renewable energy, efficiency, and natural gas). On May 20, 2019, Xcel Energy announced its intent to close all of its remaining coal- fired plants in Minnesota by 2030 while compensating by increasing solar production capacity by 1,400%. It also declared its plans to continue operating its Monticello nuclear plant near Monticello, Minnesota until at least 2040.  Generation portfolio  Xcel Energy currently has 13 coal plants with a capacity of 7,697 MW. Seven of those plants are operated in Colorado. Xcel Energy owns and operates three wind farms. In October 2011, Xcel Energy set a world record for electricity from wind power, with an hourly penetration of 55.6% of production from wind. Xcel Energy generates over 500 megawatts of hydroelectric power from 27 plants in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Colorado. This accounts for only four percent of their electricity generation. They also purchase large amounts of hydro-generated electricity from Manitoba Hydro. The Bay Front Power Plant in Wisconsin. Biomass electricity comes from organic fuel sources. Xcel Energy has contracts for about 110 megawatts of electricity from biomass generators. Two in northern Minnesota are fueled by forest harvest residue, such as treetops and limbs. A third facility, brought on line in 2007 in western Minnesota, generates power using turkey litter. Xcel Energy's Bay Front plant in Ashland, Wisconsin, is a three-unit generating station that has become a model for the creative use of fuels: coal, waste wood, railroad ties, discarded tires, natural gas, and petroleum coke. Two of the three Bay Front operating units already use biomass as their primary fuel. Xcel Energy recently proposed a plan to install biomass gasification technology at Bay Front. The waste-to-energy facilities use waste that would otherwise end up in landfills. The Wisconsin waste-to-energy plant burns wood waste in combination with refuse-derived fuel (RDF). Xcel Energy owns and operates two nuclear power plants: * Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant near Monticello, Minnesota * Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant near Red Wing, Minnesota and stores the spent fuel from these nuclear plants on site in independent spent fuel storage installations. (ISFSIs).  System information and transmission  Xcel Energy operates the fourth largest transmission system in the United States, spanning 10 states. In 2011, Xcel Energy‚Äôs transmission system was worth $3.3 billion. The transmission system is operated on a non-discriminatory basis under the open access requirements of the Federal Government. This means that all wholesale buyers and sellers of electricity can use the transmission system under the same terms and conditions used to serve Xcel Energy‚Äôs own retail customers. The transmission lines are utilized to carry 115,000 volts, 230,000 volts, and 345,000 volts. There is also a 500,000 volt transmission line that runs from the Dorsey Substation outside of Winnipeg, Manitoba in Canada to the Chisago Substation located in Chisago County just north of St. Paul, Minnesota.  Grid security  In 2017, Xcel Energy partnered with the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center to create a new \\"threat information sharing community\\" intended to share cyber and physical security intelligence with the energy sector. The new community is called the Energy Analytic Security Exchange (EASE). It is run by the FS-ISAC Sector Services team; FS-ISAC is an organization that gathers cyber and physical risk intelligence for the financial services industry. Additionally, the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) manages the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center, which is another resource that the energy sector uses to gather threat intelligence.  Advanced Grid in Colorado  In 2016, Xcel Energy announced the Advanced Grid Intelligence and Security (AGIS) initiative, a long-term effort related to power reliability, distributed generation, and information sharing with customers. Through the initiative, Xcel would build an \\"intelligent grid\\" in Colorado in order to improve grid security. The company filed a request for permission with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission for the program, which would cost $500 million.  Programs  Since 1998, Xcel Energy's Windsource program has allowed customers to designate that part or all of their electricity comes from a renewable energy source. In 2015, about 96,000 people were enrolled in Windsource. In 2011, more than 2.3 million electric and 261,800 natural gas customers took part in Xcel Energy‚Äôs energy efficiency programs for homes and businesses. Xcel Energy also offers customers incentives to install solar panels. At the end of 2011, more than 10,600 photovoltaic systems had been installed, with a capacity of about 121 megawatts (DC). In early 2011, Xcel Energy suspended the solar rebate program before reaching a settlement a month later with representatives of solar power companies to restore the solar incentive program until it is fully reviewed by the Public Utilities Commission. Controversies On August 1, 2002, Xcel Energy Inc. was sued because of engaging in \\"round-trip\\" energy trades that provided no economic benefit for the company, and because the company lacked the necessary internal controls to adequately monitor the trading of its power. Xcel paid $80,000,000 in a settlement. In early October 2007, a flash fire within a penstock at Xcel Energy's hydroelectric plant at Cabin Creek occurred which resulted in the death of 5 contract workers.

History In 1909 H.M. Byllesby (engineering apprentice to Thomas Edison who helped build Manhattan‚Äôs Pearl Street Electrical Station in 1881 and employee of George Westinghouse from 1885-1891) formed the Washington County Light & Power Company, a subsidiary of his utilities conglomerate, Consumers Power Company. Byllesby then bought Stillwater Gas & Electric less than two months after forming Washington County P & L. From 1912 through 1915, Byllesby linked power lines around Minneapolis, Saint Paul, Chaska, Shakopee and built business operations in Faribault, Mankato, Northfield, Coon Rapids, Rockford, Delano, Watertown, Waconia, Chaska, Shakopee, and Crookston growing his customer base from several thousand to 48,000. Northern States Power Company (NSP) was a publicly traded utility, paying a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1910.Standard & Poor's Stock Guide, various issues It was originally called the Consumers Power Company -- one of several divisions within H. M. Byllesby's vast public utility empire -- but changed its name to NSP in 1916 (possibly to avoid confusion with an identically named company in Michigan) 42 smaller companies over the next seven years. While the bulk of NSP's territory grew across central and southern Minnesota (starting from the Twin Cities), it acquired territory in North Dakota (centering on Fargo, Grand Forks, and Minot) and grew southwest into South Dakota (centering on Sioux Falls). Its territory extended east into Wisconsin as well, but due to state regulations requiring local ownership of all utilities, these operations were under a separate subsidiary: Northern States Power-Wisconsin. This latter subsidiary extended east into northern neighboring Upper Peninsula of Michigan, bounded between Lake Michigan and Lake Superior around 1995. In 1952, Northern States Power brought the Black Dog Coal-fired power plant online and in 1974 the Prairie Island Nuclear Plant began operating with a total capacity of 1,100 Meg-watts, enough to power 1 million homes. By 1986, the company had grown to be included among the S&P; 500 list of 500 of the largest companies in the United States. By that time it had accumulated nearly $1.2 billion in long-term debt. NSP served the agriculturally based region of its headquarters state of Minnesota, and also the neighboring states of North Dakota and South Dakota to the west. These territories were served through its subsidiary, NSP-Minnesota.Wisconsin Energy Corp. Form 8-K, SEC Info, Filed On 5/3/95, SEC File 1-09057, Accession Number 107815-95-8Xcel Energy Inc. Form 8-K, SEC Info, Filed On 5/3/95, SEC File 1-03034, Accession Number 898822-95-46 On May 28, 1996 NSP voted to split its stock two-for-one. It paid an annual 6.5% dividend yield. By the end of 1995, NSP had reduced its debt to US$1.5 billion. Primergy merger On May 3, 1995, Northern States Power Company and Wisconsin Energy Corporation () each filed a Securities and Exchange Commission Form 8-K to combine in a merger-of-equals transaction to form Primergy Corporation, which would be a registered public utility holding company, and to be the new parent of both NSP and of the operating subsidiaries of WEC. It would be the tenth largest investor-owned electric and gas utility company in the United States, based on market capitalization at that time of about US$6.0 billion, and with 1994 combined revenues of US$4.2 billion and with total assets of more than US$10.0 billion. Shareholders of NSP common stock would own 1.626 shares of stock of Primergy for each share of NSP stock they owned, and WEC shareholders were to receive one-for-one shares of Primergy. At that time, Richard A. Abdoo, served as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy. James J. Howard served in the same positions with Northern States Power. With the new Primergy Corporation, Howard would become Chairman and CEO, and Abdoo would serve as Vice Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer. Further, with Howard scheduled to retire in July 2000, Abdoo would then succeed him as Chairman of Primergy. Wisconsin Energy's two then-existing utility subsidiaries, Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO) and Wisconsin Natural Gas Company (WNG) were to be consolidated under a new subsidiary name, Wisconsin Energy Company. Under that name, it and Northern States Power Company would continue to operate as the two principal subsidiaries of Primergy Corp. Also, NSP-Wisconsin would merge into the operating subsidiary Wisconsin Energy Company. The headquarters of the two utilities would remain distinct and separate in their existing respective state locations--Milwaukee for Wisconsin Energy and Minneapolis for NSP. The merged company would have been headquartered in Minneapolis (with NSP as the nominal survivor), but incorporated in Wisconsin. The Primergy board of directors were to be equally split, composed of six from each company. The merger deal was expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 1996. By 1997, approvals had been granted by the state regulatory commissions in Michigan and North Dakota, but not by the commissions in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Approvals from the Securities & Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice were still pending.Wisconsin Energy Corp., Northern States Power Co. Agree to Terminate Merger Proceedings, PRNewswire, May 16, 1997 On May 16, 1997 both CEOs announced that the boards of directors of both companies had voted that day to terminate the merger plan. Howard stated that the problem was that the regulatory agencies were changing their merger policies as they were considering the companies' filing. In particular, Howard blamed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which had issued a decision earlier in the week remanding the case back to the companies, for further negotiation among themselves. \\"There is simply no end to this process in sight,\\" stated Howard. Abdoo said the decision to end the merger factored in that after two years of already waiting, the further likely wait of at least six months of delay would significantly reduce the benefits of the Primergy transaction. The delay had put the merger five months behind schedule and had reduced earnings for both utilities by a total of US$58 million to that point, costs which had not been passed on to consumers. Adding to the discomfort was a growing gap between the performance of the two companies by early 1997. Wisconsin Energy's stock had by then fallen about 13% since early 1995 when the deal had been announced, due to other ongoing problems that had developed within the company, including issues with its Point Beach Nuclear Generating Station in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. But Northern States Power's stock had risen by 6%. The case was considered to be a bellwether in the utilities industry, putting an end to the rapid pace of mergers and acquisitions that had been ongoing up to then.Primergy too strong for regulators' taste, Google cache, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, by LEE BERGQUIST, May 18, 1997  Xcel merger  However, in 1998, after the failed Primergy merger, NSP merged with New Century Energies of Denver, owner of Public Service Company of Colorado and Southwestern Public Service, to form Xcel Energy.

Despite having lived in France for most of her life, she was selected to represent the country of her birth in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005, held in Kiev, Ukraine. Early life She was born in Istanbul, Turkey. Having moved to Paris at the age of seven, G√ºlseren took a number of steps as the years progressed to remain engaged with her Turkish background. She studied at the French university INALCO, which specialises in Eastern culture, and she also gave Turkish language lessons to Parisian children. Musical career Between 1997 and 1999, she forged her experience as a singer by giving nightly performances at the Parisian cabaret venue \\"Les Trois Mailletz\\", which showcases jazz and world music. She also performed in venues across Europe, in particular returning to Turkey on many occasions. G√ºlseren tried her hand at acting when she played herself in the made-for-television Dutch film Roos and Rana, which hit screens in April 2001. The film focused on the relationship between two girls, one Dutch and the other Turkish, and how it impacts upon their families. In early 2005, G√ºlseren threw her hat in the ring in the competition to represent Turkey at the Eurovision Song Contest. After tentative plans for a public televote were dropped, the selection of the country's Eurovision entry instead rested with a seventeen-strong jury, for whom G√ºlseren's performance of \\"Rimi Rimi Ley\\" proved to be the decisive favourite. The song was uncompromisingly faithful to Turkish musical traditions ‚Äì somewhat in contrast to the country's entries in 2003 and especially 2004 ‚Äì and was criticised by 2003 Eurovision winner Sertab Erener for lacking the broad international appeal necessary to achieve a good result. However, it can also be seen as a response to the result of the 2004 contest, in which identifiably 'ethnic' songs, including the Serbia and Montenegro entry, proved to be successful vote-grabbers. Due to the impressive placing of Turkey's 2004 representatives Athena on home soil in Istanbul, G√ºlseren had the fortune of being immune from the tough battle to avoid elimination at the semi-final stage on 19 May, and instead qualified directly for the grand final on 21 May in which she finished 13th with 92 points. Turkey participated in the semi-final of the 2006 contest in Greece after finishing 13th in the 2005 contest.

Dembski, in which the author presents an argument in support of intelligent design. Dembski defines the term \\"specified complexity\\", and argues that instances of it in nature cannot be explained by Darwinian evolution, but instead are consistent with the intelligent design. He also derives an instance of his self-declared law of conservation of information and uses it to argue against Darwinian evolution. The book is a summary treatment of the mathematical theory he presents in The Design Inference (1998), and is intended to be largely understandable by a nontechnical audience. Dembski also provides a Christian theological commentary, and analysis of, what he perceives to be the historical and cultural significance of the ideas.  Overview  Dembski begins by analyzing signs from God in the Bible, and notes that such signs have specificity and complexity, which enables them to be clearly discernible. He considers this to be a general insight regarding recognition of the \\"Divine Finger\\", and states, \\"My aim in this book is to take this premodern logic of signs and make it rigorous.\\" A review of naturalistic criticisms of miracles, particularly those by Benedict Spinoza and Friedrich Schleiermacher, follows. Dembski critiques the critiques, and derides the methodological naturalism that, he says, is part of their legacy. He then focuses on the history of natural theology in Britain, recounting the teleological arguments of William Paley and Thomas Reid, and the primary reason for their demise, the Darwinian theory of evolution by natural selection. Upon introducing it, Dembski immediately criticizes it and commends the critique of Charles Hodge, who he says argued that Darwinism \\"was trying to subsume intelligent causation under physical causation.\\" Intelligent design, the central idea of the book, is then introduced. He distinguishes it from theistic evolution and, especially, purely naturalistic evolution. Explaining a motivation for it, he states, \\"Darwinism is the totalizing claim that [natural selection] accounts for all the diversity and complexity of life. The evidence simply does not support this claim.... [There] is always a temptation in science [to] think that one's theory encompasses a far bigger domain than it actually does.\\" He lists numerous phenomena that he claims have proven to be \\"utterly intractable\\" for natural selection, including the origin of life, the origin of the genetic code, and the Cambrian explosion. Then comes the technical theory. He introduces his complexity-specification criterion, which states that in order to infer design, three criteria must be met simultaneously: contingency, complexity, and specification. According to Dembski, the first rules out necessity; the latter two rule out chance. Combined with his universal probability bound of 10‚àí150, he claims that this criterion is completely accurate when applied to actual objects \\"with known underlying causal story.\\" Dembski derives what he purports to be an instance of what Peter Medawar (in 1984) identified as the law of conservation of information. However mathematician Jeffrey Shallit has rebutted this claim, stating that \\"Medawar‚Äôs 'law' is not the same as Dembski‚Äôs\\" in that Medawar \\"makes no mention of probabilities or the name Shannon\\", and that \\"Medawar‚Äôs law, by the way, can be made rigorous, but in the context of Kolmogorov information, not Shannon information or Dembski‚Äôs 'complex specified information'.\\"Shallit expert report, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District Dembski then introduces the term \\"complex specified information\\" (CSI), and claims that CSI is indicative of design. He considers whether the only known natural mechanisms of physical law and chance, alone or in combination, can generate such information, and concludes that they cannot. He argues that this is so because laws can only shift around or lose information, but do not produce it, and chance can produce complex unspecified information, or unspecified complex information, but not CSI; he provides a mathematical analysis that he claims demonstrates that law and chance working together cannot generate CSI, either. Moreover, Dembski claims that CSI is holistic (with the whole being greater than the sum of the parts, and that this decisively eliminates Darwinian evolution as a possible means of its creation. He then enumerates the possible sources of CSI in biological organisms: inheritance, selection, and infusion. He states that the first two sources are \\"unable to account for the CSI in biological systems (and specifically for the irreducible complexity of certain biochemical systems...)\\", and therefore concludes that CSI must come from infusion. He further argues that biotic infusion cannot ultimately account for CSI, and so abiotic infusion must be the source. Dembski maintains that by process of elimination, CSI is best explained as being due to intelligence, and is therefore a reliable indicator of design. He implies that his theory can be useful in several fields, including forensic science, intellectual property law, archaeology, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Dembski concludes the book with comments on what he sees as the theological implications of intelligent design. In an appendix, he offers answers to various objections to intelligent design. Reception The physicist Victor J. Stenger criticized the book as \\"stealth creationism,\\" and presenting an \\"argument from design\\" that \\"donned yet another set of clothes.\\" Stenger further noted, \\"While he insists that this argument does not depend on any specific theological assumptions, his book unabashedly promotes his interpretation that the design inferred is the work of the Christian God.\\" Some criticisms also focuses on the technical theory presented, namely, specified complexity and Dembski's statements regarding the law of conservation of information.How to Evolve Specified Complexity by Natural Means, Matt YoungThe Design Detectives , Jason Rosenhouse. Assistant Professor, Mathematics, James Madison University It has been argued that together they constitute nothing more than a re-statement of the second law of thermodynamics, which is known to permit the development of local concentrations of increased order in the universe provided that there is a counterbalancing increase in disorder elsewhere. Regarding physics, \\"When Dembski says that information cannot be generated naturally, he seems to be voicing yet another muddled version of the common creationist assertion that the second law forbids the generation of order by natural processes. Like his predecessors, he ignores the caveat \\"closed system\\" in the formal statement of the second law.\\" Dembski's reliance on such a controversial and unaccepted modelSteven Schafersman, on National Public Radio \\"Talk of the Nation\\" is also not accepted in academia.\\" Critics like Jason Rosenhouse, a mathematics professor, claim Intelligent Design contributes nothing to the discussion of evolution and intelligent design since Dembski's assertions ride on Behe's claim, and that claim is false.

Located under Market Street between Drumm Street and Beale Street near The Embarcadero, it serves the Financial District neighborhood and surrounding areas. The three-level station has a large fare mezzanine level, with separate platform levels for Muni Metro and BART below. Embarcadero opened in May 1976 ‚Äì almost two years after service began through the Transbay Tube ‚Äì as an infill station. With over 42,000 daily passenger entrances on weekdays, Embarcadero and Montgomery Street stations are the two busiest in the BART system. A major Bay Area transit hub, Embarcadero is also served by numerous bus routes of several other agencies which stop above the station and on surrounding streets. History A Muni Metro train at Embarcadero in 1993 Service at the station began on May 27, 1976, three years after the other San Francisco stations. The station was not part of the original plans for the system. As a result of increasing development in the lower Market Street area, the basic structure of the station was added into the construction of the Market Street subway, anticipating a later opening. The later opening resulted in the Embarcadero station having a much different design than the other three Market Street stations. The station was designed by chief BART architect Tallie Maule and Hertzka & Knowles & Associates in collaboration with Parsons Brinckerhoff, Tudor Construction, and Bechtel. The station cost $30 million to construct. Muni Metro service began in February 1980 and Embarcadero was originally intended to be the inbound terminus for all of the Muni Metro lines. In 1998 a new southward extension was opened along the Embarcadero and to the Caltrain station at 4th and King Streets; however, several Muni Metro lines continue to terminate at Embarcadero. On March 4, 2000, F Market & Wharves streetcar service was extended northward to Fisherman's Wharf, with new stops above Embarcadero station at Main Street (inbound) and Drumm Street (outbound). Because the station is adjacent to the Transbay Tube, brake dust and other particles from train operations coat the walls of the station. A sandblasting in 2014 revealed the original white terrazzo platform walls under the dark grime. Since before 1992, the station was serenaded by Ronald Brewington, known as the \\"Jazz Man\\". He would play saxophone for commuters, and entertain them with conversation and charm. He claimed his name was Garrick Sherrod; however, that was an identity he had stolen. The Jazz Man was actually a fugitive from Albuquerque facing capital murder charges stemming from the 1987 death of his wife Diedre. He was arrested at a BART station in 2012, and extradited to New Mexico. In 2013, he pleaded guilty to the murder and was sentenced to 16 years in prison. Artwork The bottom part of Wall Canyon Although original plans to include public art at every BART station did not come to fruition, several artworks were included in Embarcadero station. The platform walls and street entrances feature circle-based reliefs by William Mitchell. Wall Canyon, a -high colored ceramic relief by Stephen De Staebler, is partially hidden behind a staircase at the southwest end of the station. It was installed on January 1, 1977. A duotone granite portrait of Tallie Maule ‚Äì the chief architect of the original BART system ‚Äì is on the mezzanine level. A -tall, rope sculpture called Legs was installed at the northwest end of the station in 1976 or 1978. Created by Barbara Shawcroft, the orange-and-white Nomex sculpture moved with the breeze from passing Muni and BART trains. Legs soon accumulated the same dark grime as the station walls, hiding the original color. BART was required by the artist's contract to clean the sculpture but several attempts were unsuccessful. In 2013, BART included removal of Legs in its 2014 budget, which prompted a debate about whether it should be cleaned regardless of cost (which Shawcroft supported), or removed from the unsuitable environment of the station. The sculpture was removed in June 2014 and returned to Shawcroft ‚Äì a professor emerita at UC Davis School of Design ‚Äì who planned to repurpose it into other pieces. Station layout One of the six station entrances Like the three other shared Muni/BART stations in the Market Street subway, Embarcadero has three underground levels. The uppermost level is a fare mezzanine, with one Muni paid area in the middle flanked by two BART paid areas. The second level has a single island platform (of which only the center portion is used) for Muni Metro, and the third level has an island platform for BART. The station is narrower than the other three ‚Äì rather than ‚Äì because of adjacent buildings and the high water table. It has six street entrances along its length. The station contains an unused underground entrance to the 388 Market Street building. Following the 2015 addition of a canopy over an escalator at 19th Street Oakland station, which reduced escalator downtime by one-third, BART decided to add canopies to all downtown Oakland and San Francisco entrances. Construction of the Market Street entrances will begin in 2020, with completion in 2027. Connections Market and Drumm with the station entrances in the center and top left. An F Market & Wharves streetcar is running inbound on Market Street (left, just above center) and a cable car waits in the pinch tracks (lower right). Embarcadero station is located in the busy Financial District; numerous routes by several transit providers stop at or near the station.

A number of Golden Gate Transit bus routes stop near Embarcadero on Fremont Street (2, 4, 38, 44, 54, 56, 58, 72, 72X, 74, 76) and/or Pine Street (2, 4, 8, 18, 24, 24X). Other transit agencies that stop nearby include SamTrans (292, 397, 398, 713, FCX), PresidiGo (Downtown Shuttle), and Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach. Embarcadero station is the nearest Muni Metro and BART station to the Ferry Building, the primary San Francisco terminal for Golden Gate Ferry and San Francisco Bay Ferry. The Transbay Transit Center, located about to the south, is the primary San Francisco terminal for AC Transit transbay routes, WestCAT, Greyhound Lines, Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach buses, some Golden Gate Transit routes, and Muni route .

The five albums the group released were produced by Teddy Riley, Marley Marl, DJ Premier, his cousin Pete Rock, and Eddie F. Myers also released four solo albums and discovered Soul for Real and Monifah.[ allmusic Biography] Biography Dwight Arrington Myers was born on May 24, 1967 in Mandeville, Manchester, Jamaica, the son of nurse Eulahlee Lee and machine technician Clifford Vincent Myers. In the early 1970s, his family moved to Mount Vernon, New York, where he was raised. In an interview, his mother stated that he spent most of his childhood hanging out with his brother Floyd and his childhood friend Mo. Heavy D & the Boyz were the first group signed to Uptown Records, with Heavy D as the frontman and only rapper. Eddie F was his business partner in the group, DJ, and one of the producers. The other two members, T-Roy and G-Wiz were the dancers. Their debut, Living Large, was released in 1987. The album was a commercial success; Big Tyme was a breakthrough that included four hits. \\"Trouble T. Roy\\" died at age 22 in a fall on July 15, 1990, in Indianapolis. Dixon's death led to a tribute on the follow-up platinum album, Peaceful Journey. Pete Rock & CL Smooth created a tribute to Trouble T. Roy called \\"They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)\\" which is regarded as a hip hop classic. In 1989, Heavy D performed a guest rap on Janet Jackson's hit single \\"Alright\\", an early example of rap appearances on pop songs. It was also the highest peaking song which he had performed on in the Billboard Hot 100. In 1992 he appeared on Michael Jackson's single \\"Jam\\", and also gained a higher profile by singing the theme song for the television program In Living Color and also MADtv. Heavy D then began focusing on his acting, appearing in various television shows before returning to the music charts with Nuttin' But Love. After appearing in the off-Broadway play Riff Raff at Circle Repertory Company, Heavy D returned to recording with the hit Waterbed Hev. In 1997, Heavy D collaborated with B.B. King on his duets album Deuces Wild, rapping in the song \\"Keep It Coming\\". Heavy D was referred to in the song \\"Juicy\\" by the Notorious B.I.G., and appeared in his music video for \\"One More Chance\\". While still an artist at Uptown Records, Myers was instrumental in convincing Andre Harrell to originally hire Sean \\"Diddy\\" Combs for his first music business gig as an intern. He became the president of Uptown Records. During this time, Myers also developed the boy band Soul for Real, and was the executive producer and principal writer of several songs on the group's breakout album, Candy Rain. He later became senior vice president at Universal Music. As an actor, Heavy D is perhaps best known for his role in the 1999 drama film The Cider House Rules, where he plays a migrant worker. He fathered a daughter in 2000 with chef Antonia Lofaso, a contestant on the fourth season of Top Chef. Death Heavy D's final live performance was with Eddie F at the 2011 BET Hip Hop Awards on October 11, 2011, their first live televised performance together in 15 years. Myers died on November 8, 2011, in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 44. He collapsed outside his home in Beverly Hills, California, and was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. His death was initially thought to be connected to pneumonia. An autopsy report, released on December 27, 2011, stated that the cause of death was a pulmonary embolism (PE). The coroner's office found that Myers died of a PE that had broken off from a deep vein thrombosis in the leg. He also suffered from heart disease. Craig Harvey, chief of the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner, said that the blood clot that resulted in the PE was \\"most likely formed during an extended airplane ride\\". Heavy D had recently returned from a trip to Cardiff, Wales, where he performed at a tribute to Michael Jackson. Shortly after his death, MC Hammer and others paid tribute to Heavy D on Twitter. Hammer tweeted that, \\"We had a lot of great times touring together. He had a heart of gold. He was a part of what's good about the world.\\" His funeral was held at Grace Baptist Church in his hometown of Mount Vernon, New York. He was buried in Hartsdale, New York. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Heavy D & the Boyz among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

H. Davenport and Company, now defunct. Due to the popularity of the furniture at the time, the name davenport became a genericized trademark in parts of the United States. Variations It was used as a synonym for \\"sofa,\\" especially in the Midwestern United States and in northern New York state. Specifically, it is used in the Adirondack Region and the Tug Hill Plateau, especially amongst those born there before World War II. The so-called davenports of the northern New York region are often sofa versions of the locally manufactured convertible Adirondack chair. Among the younger generations, the word has come to mean a more formal sofa. In the Tug Hill and Adirondack regions in New York, a davenport may refer especially to a couch which, like a modern futon lounge, converts on pivoting hinges from a sofa to a bed. In other areas of North America, the word davenport is used for a futon-style sofa with storage under the seat area. Etymology A \\"large upholstered couch,\\" 1897, apparently named for the manufacturer. Earlier (1853) \\"a kind of small ornamental writing table.\\" The proper name is attested from 12th century, from a place in Cheshire (Old English Devennport).

Thomas Jefferson was the first president to exercise the power of impoundment in 1801. The power was available to all presidents up to and including Richard Nixon, and was regarded as a power inherent to the office. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 was passed in response to perceived abuse of the power under President Nixon. Title X of the Act removed that power, and Train v. City of New York (whose facts predate the 1974 Act, but which was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court after its passage), closed potential loopholes in the 1974 Act. The president's ability to indefinitely reject congressionally approved spending was thus removed. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 provides that the president may propose rescission of specific funds, but that rescission must be approved by both the House of Representatives and Senate within 45 days. In effect, the requirement removed the impoundment power, since Congress is not required to vote on the rescission and, in fact, has ignored the vast majority of presidential requests. Forty-three states in the U.S. give their governors authority not to spend money allocated by the state legislature. The states which deny their governor the authority are Indiana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Vermont. The Mayor of Washington, D.C. also has the impoundment power.District of Columbia Home Rule Act () History The term is derived from pound, a secured holding area. The general sense of impoundment is the items held in the pound, or the process of securing them into the pound. In that senses, the President is securing the pool of allocated funds, holding them instead of allowing them to be freely spent. The first use of the power by President Thomas Jefferson involved refusal to spend $50,000 ($ in ) in funds appropriated for the acquisition of gunboats for the United States Navy. He said in 1803 that \\"[t]he sum of fifty thousand dollars appropriated by Congress for providing gun boats remains unexpended. The favorable and peaceable turn of affairs on the Mississippi rendered an immediate execution of that law unnecessary.\\" In keeping with his efforts to reduce the size of the debt, he left the funds for the ships unspent for over a year. Many other presidents have followed Jefferson's example. From time to time, they refused to spend funds when they felt that Congress had appropriated more funds than was necessary. However, the impoundment power had limits. For example, in 1972, Richard Nixon attempted to impound funds on an environmental project which he opposed. Congress had previously overridden Nixon's veto of the project. The Supreme Court in Train v. City of New York (1975) ruled that the impoundment power cannot be used to frustrate the will of Congress under such circumstances. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 was passed as Congress felt that President Nixon was abusing his authority to impound the funding of programs he opposed. The Act effectively removed the impoundment power of the president and required him to obtain Congressional approval if he wants to rescind specific government spending. President Nixon signed the Act with little protest because the administration was then embroiled in the Watergate scandal and unwilling to provoke Congress.Budget Resolution Explainer, Rudolph Penner, Urban Institute However, the procedure set up by the Act was cumbersome. All recent presidents supported the restoration of the impoundment power, including Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Politicians such as John McCain, John Kerry, Al Gore, Pat Buchanan, Jeb Hensarling, Russ Feingold, Joe Lieberman, Judd Gregg and Paul Ryan also supported the restoration of the power. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 gave the president the power of line-item veto, which President Bill Clinton applied to the federal budget 82 times before the law was struck down in 1998 by the Supreme Court on the grounds of it being in violation of the Presentment Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Strengthening the rescission provision within the 1974 act has also been proposed as a means of curtailing excessive congressional spending.

Located under Market Street between 4th Street and 5th Street, it serves the Financial District neighborhood and surrounding areas. The three-level station has a large fare mezzanine level, with separate platform levels for Muni Metro and BART below. The fare mezzanine will also connect to the Union Square/Market Street station when it opens. The Powell-Mason and Powell-Hyde cable car lines turn around at Powell and Market adjacent to the station and Hallidie Plaza. BART service at the station began on November 5, 1973, followed by Muni Metro service on February 18, 1980. Station layout Hallidie Plaza entrance to the station The new canopy in March 2019 Like the three other shared Muni/BART stations in the Market Street subway, Powell has three underground levels. The first level is a fare mezzanine, with two Muni paid areas and two BART paid areas. The second level has a single island platform for Muni Metro, and the third level has an island platform for BART. The station has eight street entrances (one currently closed) along its length, plus two underground entrances to the fare mezzanine from the basement level of the Westfield San Francisco Centre mall. A closed passageway leads from the northeast end of the station under Market Street partway to Third Street; this was planned to be a direct entrance from the Yerba Buena Center development, but was never completed. The under- construction Central Subway, expected to open in 2021, passes under the Powell station complex. The new Union Square/Market Street station will be located north of Powell station under Stockton Street. The stations will be connected outside of fare control by a passageway; the result will be a single integrated underground complex running all the way from Union Square to Market and Fifth Streets. The Stockton/Ellis entrance to the station was closed for a planned five years on April 24, 2013, so that it could be modified to include the connection to the new station. The closure was originally planned for the previous August, but delayed after Muni determined it was not yet needed. Muni purchased the entrance from BART for one dollar. Following the 2015 addition of a canopy over an escalator at 19th Street Oakland station, which reduced escalator downtime by one-third, BART decided to add canopies to all downtown Oakland and San Francisco entrances. The canopies will protect the escalator from weather damage, improve lighting, allow the escalator to be fully closed off when the station is not open, and provide a location for real-time train arrival information displays. The Powell station entrance at Market and Ellis was chosen for early implementation; it was closed on November 6, 2017, with the new canopy opened on September 29, 2018. Construction of the Market Street entrances will begin in 2020, with completion in 2027. In September 2015, BART released a report on possible modernization of the station. A total of $93 million in potential improvements were identified, including escalator replacement and canopy construction ($25 million), a corridor to Cyril Magnin ($13.7 million), a new mid-station elevator ($6.1 million), platform screen doors ($6 million), additional platform stairs ($5.6 million), and numerous other projects. Bathrooms in underground BART stations were closed due to security concerns after the 9/11 attacks. In 2019, BART indicated plans to open a new bathroom with an attendant at Powell in 2021. In November 2019, the board issued an $11 million contract for improvements at Powell, with the bathroom expected to cost an additional $20 million. Pigeons living in the station are a nuisance, which has prompted BART to take countermeasures such as installing nets and metal screens to block their nesting spots. The pigeons are attracted by passengers littering and by nearby street food vendors.

His first musical debut was sparked by a shout-out from Nas on his song \\"One Love\\", from the critically acclaimed Illmatic album during Cormega's time in prison. Early life Cormega was born and raised in Queens, forming childhood friendships with future rappers such as Nas, Havoc and Capone. A frequent theme of his music addresses the countless number of his friends and family that have been killed by violence. Career ;1990s He was featured on Hot Day's \\"Going Straight Up\\" from his album It's My Turn. He was also featured on Blaq Poet and DJ Hot Day's track \\"Set It Off\\" from their album Without Warning in 1991. During a period of incarceration, Cormega gained some attention following a shout-out from Nas on his song \\"One Love\\", from the Illmatic album released in 1994. Following his release from jail in 1995, Cormega became determined to pursue rapping. Nas included him on a song entitled \\"Affirmative Action\\" on his album It Was Written released on July 2, 1996. The song also featured AZ and Foxy Brown, and became The Firm's first appearance. Based on his performance, he was signed to Def Jam and recorded an album called The Testament. Based on the buzz from \\"Affirmative Action,\\" Nas, his manager Steve Stoute and producers Dr. Dre and The Trackmasters joined to produce The Firm. However, Cormega was replaced with another Queensbridge artist, Nature, because either he would not sign a contract with Stoute or Stoute felt Nature was a better rapper. This led to an alleged altercation between Cormega and Nature. Cormega's dispute with Stoute also ended his friendship with Nas. Following the end of his membership in The Firm, Alex Trojano contributed in producing his album The Testament. Meanwhile, following a falling-out over creative differences with his manager Chris Lighty and Def-Jam imprint Violator Records, his debut album The Testament was indefinitely shelved. During the recording for The Testament Cormega responded to Nas' \\"One Love\\" in the form of a letter also entitled \\"One Love\\". ;2000s In 2000, he was released from his contract and he started his own record company, Legal Hustle Records. Cormega vented his disappointment with Nas and The Firm in a mixtape song titled \\"Never Personal\\". This song was never directly pointed to Nas, but the media made it look like that. In 2001, he released his new debut album, The Realness, which was acclaimed by critics. Many of the songs share a theme of betrayal. Nas responded to Cormega on his song \\"Destroy and Rebuild\\" from his album Stillmatic. Cormega retaliated with more mixtape tracks, \\"A Slick Response\\" and \\"Realmatic\\". Cormega's follow-up album, The True Meaning won the Source Magazine 's prestigious Underground Album of the Year Award. In 2004, he followed up with Legal Hustle (a compilation album showcasing his label's artists) and other talented hip-hop lyricists such as Ghostface Killah, Large Professor, AZ, Kurupt, Jayo Felony, and several others. This album is considered by some as more of a project than an actual solo album; nonetheless, it was well received. In 2005, he was able to release The Testament on his own label, which saw good reviews and sales and featured the original banned version of \\"Dead Man Walking\\" as a hidden track. In early September 2005, Cormega posted a statement on his website that he and Nas had spoken and ended their feud. On December 22, 2006 at the Nokia Theatre Times Square, Cormega appeared on stage at a Nas concert and went on to perform with Nas (and Foxy Brown as well), further evidence that their feud is over. In the mid-2000s Cormega helped produce a few albums and was featured on several songs with The Jacka and the Mob Figaz. An album collaboration with Lakey The Kid entitled My Brother's Keeper was released independently on August 22, 2006. On November 20, 2007, Cormega finally released his DVD in-the-making Who Am I?. The DVD took over four years of filming of Cormega in all aspects of his life and what others thought of Cormega, unedited. The DVD was released as a soundtrack plus DVD. Cormega intended to release an album which was to be entitled Urban Legend before T.I.'s album of the same name was released (Cormega mentions this on the Who Am I DVD, dated circa 2003); the new title is Born and Raised. The album was released October 20, 2009. The first single is called \\"Journey.\\" ;2010s Cormega has stated his desire to work with a variety of artists including Scarface, Lauryn Hill, Slick Rick, Erykah Badu as well as past collaborators M.O.P., Mobb Deep, and Tha Dogg Pound. Cormega made great efforts to increase peoples awareness of the 2010 flooding tragedy in Pakistan, adding images and video clips to his official site. Cormega's latest album, Mega Philosophy, was entirely produced by frequent collaborator Large Professor.

The location of the battle was Fort Frontenac, a French fort and trading post which is located at the site of present-day Kingston, Ontario, at the eastern end of Lake Ontario where it drains into the St. Lawrence River. British Lieutenant Colonel John Bradstreet led an army of over 3,000 men, of whom about 150 were regulars and the remainder were provincial militia. The army besieged the 110 people inside the fort and won their surrender two days later, cutting one of the two major communication and supply lines between the major eastern centres of Montreal and Quebec City and France's western territories (the northern route, along the Ottawa River, remained open throughout the war). The British captured goods worth 800,000 livres from the trading post. Background The British military campaigns for the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War in 1758 contained three primary objectives. Two of these objectives, captures of Fort Louisbourg and Fort Duquesne met with success. The third campaign, an expedition involving 16,000 men under the command of General James Abercrombie, was disastrously defeated on July 8, 1758, by a much smaller French force when it attempted the capture of Fort Carillon (known today as Fort Ticonderoga). Following that failure, many of Abercrombie's underlings sought to distance themselves from any responsibility for the disaster.Fowler, p. 153 John Bradstreet Lieutenant Colonel John Bradstreet renewed an earlier proposal to capture Fort Frontenac, a French fort and trading post on the northern shore of Lake Ontario near where it empties into the St. Lawrence River. Abercrombie, who had first rejected the idea, citing the need for troops to attack Carillon, approved Bradstreet's plan to move up the Mohawk River valley to the site of Fort Oswego (captured and burned by the French in 1756), and then cross the lake to assault Frontenac. Bradstreet assembled an army at Schenectady consisting of just 135 regular army troops and about 3,500 militia, drawn from the provinces of New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. By the time his army reached the ruins of Fort Oswego on August 21, Bradstreet had lost 600 men, primarily to desertion. The trek met with minimal opposition from French and Indian raiding parties, but the route to Oswego, which had been virtually unused since 1756, was overgrown, and some of the waterways had silted up, causing heavily laden bateaux to ground in the shallow waters.Fowler, p. 154 Bradstreet's flotilla of bateaux crossed Lake Ontario, landing without opposition about one mile (1.6 km) from Fort Frontenac on August 25. Fort Frontenac was an important trading center for Indian and French fur traders. The trade through the site was so successful that some Indians preferred to trade with the French there rather than the British outpost at Albany, New York, which provided more ready access to inexpensive British goods.Smollet, Vol. IV, Ch. IX, pg. 402, sect. VIII. The fortification, a crumbling limestone construction, was only minimally garrisoned, with about 100 French troops along with some militia and Indians under the command of Pierre-Jacques Payen de Noyan et de Chavoy, an elderly veteran of King George's War. While the fort was normally garrisoned by a larger force, the limited means available for the defense of New France had forced French military leaders to reduce its size for the defense of other parts of Canada. Noyan was alerted to the expedition's advance when Indian scouts took some prisoners, and authorities in Montreal organized reinforcements. However, these forces would not arrive before the British.Preston, p. 79 Battle A 1763 map showing the British positions The night after landing, Bradstreet's men established gun batteries and began to dig trenches toward the old fort. They also attempted, without success to board two of the French ships anchored before the fort. On the morning of August 26, the British guns opened fire. The French garrison returned fire with cannons and muskets, but made little impression on the British. The two sides continued to exchange fire on the 27th, with the British establishing gun batteries northwest of the fort, about from the fort. On the morning of the 28th, two French ships attempted to escape the harbor, but ran aground after persistent British fire against them. Following a brief council of war, Noyan raised the white flag. Aftermath With the capture of Frontenac, the British intercepted significant supplies destined for French forts in the Ohio Country. More than 60 cannons (some of them British cannons the French had captured at Fort Oswego) were found, as were hundreds of barrels of provisions. To the many provincials in Bradstreet's army, the biggest prizes were bales of furs destined for shipment downstream to Montreal. In all, the value of the captured goods was estimated to be 800,000 French livres. Since Bradstreet's orders were not to hold the fort but to destroy it, many of the provisions were burned before the army returned to Oswego, using some of the captured French ships to help carry the loot. Bradstreet released the French prisoners after Noyan promised to gain the release of an equal number of British prisoners, and the French began to make their way back to Montreal. They were met by the relief force from Montreal. The French established Fort de La Pr√©sentation (at present-day Ogdensburg, New York) as a base for supply and defense. Fort Frontenac was again lightly garrisoned in 1759, but was no longer a site of importance in the war, which ended with the fall of Montreal in September 1760. New France's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, took full responsibility for the French loss, as he had believed that the British \\"would not dare to enter [Lake Ontario] on which [the French] had vessels.\\"Fowler, p. 155 He did however force Noyan into retirement. Noyan returned to France, where he spent some time in the Bastille on charges that he misappropriated public funds, and was eventually fined six livres.Preston, p. 82 NotesReferences   External links  * Fort Frontenac - French and Indian War (U-S-history.com) * Lossing's Field Book of the Revolution (RootsWeb) * Fall of Fort Frontenac (HistoryOfWar.org) * Chartrand, Ren√©.

In the , Russell Island had a population of 2,836 people. Geography Russell Island in Redland City is the biggest of the Southern Moreton Bay Islands, situated between the mainland and North Stradbroke Island. The island is eight kilometres long (north-to-south) and nearly three kilometres wide. The channel separating it from the mainland is known as Main Channel and the channel separating it from North Stradbroke Island is known as Canaipa Passage. History A basic survey of the island was conducted by Robert Dixon in 1839. He named the island after Lord John Russell the Secretary of State for the Colonies in the 1840s. The island was first settled by Europeans in 1866, when John Campbell was granted a lease on the northern end of the island closely followed by John Willes and his family.Dorrington, Wendy: The Pioneers of Russell Island, self-published, 2003, Russell Island, QLD, Land auctions commenced in 1870. Farmers and oystermen were the first full-time inhabitants, but with the arrival of the Jackson family in 1906, a small village was created on the western side of the island called Jacksonville, that had a sawmill, pineapple canning factory, jetty and even a picture theatre. Russell Island State School opened on 24 January 1916. Russell Island is known for the infamous land scams of the early 1970s, when many of the islands farms were divided into over 20,000 blocks. At the time, the area, with a population of less than 500, did not have a local authority enforcing planning regulations. Heavily advertised and sold off by unscrupulous vendors, these blocks were often not where the unwary customers thought they were buying. It all rode on the vague promise of a bridge from the National Party government at the time. Media reports exposing the scam pointed to blocks that were underwater at high tide and the lack of public land.The Russell Island Land Fraud in Grabosky, Peter (ed.) Sutton, Adam (ed.): Stains on a white collar, The Federation Press, 1989, Annandale, NSW, . The Russell Island Public Library opened in 2001. On 12 April 2008, a public 25 metre swimming pool jointly funded by the Redland City Council, the Queensland State Government, a rates levy and nearly 20 years of donations from residents was completed. Management has been contracted to the YMCA. The first bathers hit the water during that weekend but, lacking any heating, it was closed for the winter. Sufficient solar heating for spring and autumn use was installed in 2009. Another big event for the island on Wednesday, 7 May 2008 when the $1.2 million Police Station was opened by the Queensland Police Minister, bringing Senior Constable Michael Verry to the island as its first community policeman.(27 April 2008). Lee Shipley. Bay Islands gets first Community Policeman . BayJournal. Backing up the policeman, Queensland Police make frequent visits to the island with a high-speed barge which can carry two police vehicles.(19 July 2007). In October 2011 Russell Island welcomed its new police officer Sergeant Graham Staib. New Bay police vessel named . BayJournal.  Heritage listings  Russell Island has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Canaipa Ridge Road (): Mrs Fischer‚Äôs Grave * 25-27 High Street: St Peter‚Äôs Parish HallCorduroy road * Corner Jackson Road and Esplanade (): Jacksonville (Jacksons Oval) * Weedmore Road: Corduroy road Demographics House arriving on Russell Island Russell had 1,779 permanent residents in 2006 up 35.9% since 2001. However, this changes dramatically on weekends and holidays when many of the 30% of dwellings on the island which are classified as unoccupied are visited by their owners. Fast ferries and scheduled barges straddle the distance to Redland Bay quickly for most of the day. In the , Russell Island recorded a population of 2,473 people, 50.3% female and 49.7% male The median age of the Russell Island population was 51 years, 14 years above the national median of 37. 68.8% of people living in Russell Island were born in Australia. The other top responses for country of birth were New Zealand 6.1%, England 5.7%, Scotland 1%, Philippines 1%, Germany 0.9%. 85.8% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 0.5% Hungarian, 0.4% German, 0.4% Filipino, 0.4% French, 0.3% Croatian. Facilities Russell Island has a small shopping village offering a variety of services including; Super IGA supermarket, post office, petrol station, chemist, bakery, hairdressers, Chinese restaurant, newsagent, kebab shop and takeaway food shop. It also has several real estate agencies showing houses for sale and rent. Russell Island has most of the same services as the mainland that span across the island including a police station, fire station, ambulance service, medical practice, pathologist, service station, post office, hairdresser, veterinarian, computer repair services, web designers, video hire, bottle shop, lawyer, public pool, various real estate agents, landscape/hire centre, storage sheds, car hire, cafes, motor inn and a sports/recreational complex. The two licensed clubs, an RSL and the Russell Island Bowling Club, provide entertainment and bistro facilities most nights of the week. The Redland Library service operates the Russell Island Public Library which is located at 22 High Street. A Council-built hall near the main wharf is available and, centrally located on Jackson Street, the Bay Islands Community Centre has rooms. Some church denominations meet at the hall but others use the historic St Peter's Church Hall just up High Street. In 2009 the Kennedy Farm Community Centre was revamped with Commonwealth money and is now available for small scale community activity. Resident driven plans for the 4.5 ha block include sporting facilities and a community farm. Electricians, builders and plumbers are resident on the Island, making the island somewhat self-supporting. Services include power, phone, broadband, water and garbage collection. Garbage is trucked to the mainland for disposal. The Rural Fire Brigade, State Emergency Service and the Ambulance service receive strong volunteer support. Several volunteer Justices of the Peace live on the island. A small primary school for around 180 students has an active Parents and Citizens club. In early 2010 the Bay Islands Community Centre with grants from Community Service and the Council, opened a youth drop-in centre on Jackson Road.  Education  Russell Island State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 38-64 High Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 176 students with 18 teachers (14 full-time equivalent) and 18 non-teaching staff (8 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program. Proposed name change In 2015 the Russell Island residents groups, together with the Redland City Council, have proposed to transition the island's name to its traditional Aboriginal equivalent ‚Äì Canaipa Island. The proposal is that the dual names of Canaipa Island/Russell Island will be used with the island's name reverting to its traditional name once it becomes more widely accepted. The name Canaipa was collected from Yugambeh people and identified as a Yugambeh-Bundjalung language word from the Ngaraangbal dialect spoken by the Pimpama clan meaning place of ironbark spear/digging stick, the name is used by both the Quandamooka and Yugambeh people, who assert traditional ownership. The move is motivated by the desire to improve public perceptions (and hence real estate values) which were damaged by the earlier land scams.

Located under Market Street between 7th Street and 8th Street, it serves the Civic Center neighborhood and surrounding areas. The three-level station has a large fare mezzanine level, with separate platform levels for Muni Metro and BART below. History BART service at the station began on November 5, 1973, followed by Muni Metro service on February 18, 1980. In 2005, the station name was changed to Civic Center/UN Plaza during celebrations for the 60th anniversary of the United Nations and World Environment Day. Additional fares gates to allow direction connections between Muni and BART (without having to go up to the fare mezzanine) were also proposed. Station layout and changes The closed-off entrance in 2017 Like the three other shared Muni/BART stations in the Market Street Subway, Civic Center has three underground levels. The first level is a fare mezzanine, with two Muni paid areas and two BART paid areas. The second level has a single island platform for Muni Metro, and the third level has an island platform for BART. The station has six street entrances along its length. A passageway formerly led to two additional entrances west of 8th Street and Hyde Street. One - on the north side of Market Street at Grove Street - was temporarily closed in December 2016 after a sewer pipe collapsed under the escalators. The entrance remained closed until it was permanently removed in October 2017. The remaining entrance west of 8th Street was permanently closed on November 1, 2018, as the passageway space was needed for a new electrical substation to add redundancy and capacity to support increased Transbay Tube train frequency. The six original entrances (all of which are significantly closer to the faregates) remained open. Following the 2015 addition of a canopy over an escalator at 19th Street Oakland station, which reduced escalator downtime by one-third, BART decided to add canopies to all downtown Oakland and San Francisco entrances. The canopies will protect the escalator from weather damage, improve lighting, allow the escalator to be fully closed off when the station is not open, and provide a location for real-time train arrival information displays. The Civic Center station entrance at Market and 7th was chosen for early implementation; it was closed on December 11, 2017, with the new canopy opened on October 9, 2018. Construction of the remaining Market Street entrances will begin in 2020, with completion in 2027. In May 2018, BART proposed to close off a corridor that connects the 7th Street and 8th Street sides of the station because it was frequently used for drug use. In February 2020, BART began a 12-month project to add two additional staircases to the BART platform. Connections A route 21 trolleybus at Market and Hyde in 2018 Two Muni heritage streetcar stops are located above the station: Market and 7th Street, and Market and 8th Street (inbound) / Market and Hyde (outbound). Both are served by the F Market and Wharves line. The station is also served by a number of Muni bus and trolleybus routes: *Local: , , , , , , *Rapid: , *Express: *Owl service: , , , , , , , and Several Golden Gate Transit routes (24C, 30, 54C, 70, 92, 101, 101X) stop on 7th Street adjacent to the station. Additional Muni (, , , ) and SamTrans (FCXX, 292, 397, 398) bus routes run on Mission Street, one block away. AC Transit serves Civic Center station with the 800 All Nighter route during hours that BART is not operating. Under the planned Better Market Street project, stops on the F Market and Wharves line and bus routes would be consolidated to reduce travel times. The F stops at 7th and 8th streets would be replaced by a single midblock stop.

M. Coetzee. It is among his most popular works and was the 1990 Sunday Express Book of the Year. In it, he paints a picture of social and political tragedy unfolding in a country ravaged by racism and violence. Critically acclaimed, it remains one of the most striking pieces of literature regarding South African apartheid and is still used in schools worldwide for literature studies. Plot summary This story is narrated in a letter from Mrs. Curren, the main character and a retired Classics professor, to her daughter who has previously left South Africa and migrated to the United States to make a clear stand against apartheid. Mrs. Curren lives in Cape Town during the Apartheid regime. She's just been told by her doctors that her cancer is incurable and that she's going to die soon. Upon arriving home, she turns away a homeless man, Vercueil, who is camped out near her house. He leaves, but comes back right away. Mrs. Curren gives him food and offers him work, which latter offer offends him. Later that evening, she spots the man staring at the TV through her window. Needless to say she's annoyed. In the night, however, she has a sudden painful attack, and the man helps her. They form a sort of weird friendship as Vercueil spends most of his time near her house. One day she asks him to mail a letter to her daughter. He takes a long time to agree, but eventually he mails the letter. Mrs. Curren's housekeeper, Florence, returns from a trip and brings her two daughters and her son Bheki with her. Mrs. Curren resents having Bheki in the house, but he has no other place to go. His friend, who Mrs. Curren thinks is a hoodlum, gets into a fight with Vercueil, who disappears for a bit. Around this time, policemen start hanging out near the house, apparently keeping tabs on Bheki and his friends. Tensions are rising. When Vercueil returns, he brings home a woman and they both pass out drunk in the living room. Overwhelmed with people, Mrs. Curren starts to feel that everyone is conspiring against her to take over her property before she even dies. One day Mrs. Curren witnesses the same cops who previously talked to her disrespectfully, force Bheki and his friend, John, who are on bikes, to run into a truck. John injures his head badly, and she sits in the street holding his head until the ambulance arrives. Previously insulated from racial hatred, Mrs. Cullen starts to realize that her neat little white world doesn't match the reality of police brutality against black people. She wants to demand justice from the authorities for John's injury, but Florence won't let her because she's afraid to be involved with the police. They all go to the hospital to visit Bheki's friend, but Vercueil and Mrs. Curren wait in the car because she's in too much pain. Brought to tears, she admits to him that she hasn't told her daughter about her impending death. He encourages her to tell the truth, so her daughter doesn't resent her after she's gone. At home that night, Mrs. Curren invites Vercueil to sleep on the couch. She catches herself wishing he lives there. Tragedy strikes again when Florence gets a phone call in the middle of the night saying her son is in trouble. Mrs. Curren drives Florence and her daughter to Guglethu, an unsafe place, where they meet Mr. Thabane, Florence's cousin. They drive to a part of town in chaos - fire, screaming people, and dead bodies. Faced with so much destruction and fear, Mrs. Curren essentially throws a fit and is put to shame about her privileged sensibility by Mr. Thabane who lectures her about the true meaning of comradeship. Eventually they find Bheki. He and four other black men have been murdered and left lying against a wall, their eyes and mouths full of sand. Horrified, Mrs. Curren finds a policeman and demands he do something, but he brushes her off. The next day, some women come by to pick up Florence's things, as she won't return. After all of that, Vercueil asks Mrs. Curren if she intends to kill herself that day. She says yes, so they go for a drive. She's unable to go through with it however, so Vercueil buys some liquor and tells her to get drunk. Offended, she screams at him to leave, which he does. He stays away for a while. One night Mrs. Curren wakes up to find John asking about Bheki. She tells him that his friend is dead, but the boy doesn't seem to understand. He's injured, so she looks after him for a bit. When she finds him stashing something in the floorboards one day, she calls Mr. Thabane to take John away. The next morning the police come to her house asking about John. She says that everything is fine, but John is afraid. Promising not to let anything hurt him, she tries to comfort him. In a cruel trick, an officer distracts Mrs. Curren and the others shoot John. The cops then say she can return to her home, but she can't stand the thought of it. She wanders the streets until she falls asleep under a bridge. Waking to kids groping her, she's robbed and in excruciating pain. Somehow Vercueil finds her, but she still refuses to go home. They fall asleep in the woods together before returning the next day. Her house has been trashed, and a policeman is there who interrogates her about John and Vercueil. After he leaves, she calls Mr. Thabane to warn him. From this point on, Mrs. Curren fades quickly as the cancer progresses. Her pain gets worse, and she has bizarre nightmares. Vercueil, who is caring for her now, repeatedly encourages her to commit suicide. They start sharing a bed so that she can stay warm. Their relationship is completely platonic; she just can't stay warm any more. When she wakes up extremely cold one day, she asks Vercueil if today is the day. Without a word, he climbs into bed and embraces her. Her final words are that he can't make her any warmer. Structure and genre Mrs Curren is the first- person narrator in an epistolary style. Since she addresses her daughter in her letters as \\"you\\" the reader feels directly addressed. Coetzee's novel can be interpreted as a coming-of-age novel since it is about Mrs Curren's perspective on the world and coming to terms with that. Therefore, coming-of- age is in this case not growing older but rather about development. The title is not about the Iron Age but iron represents the rough and brutal way of life Mrs Curren and the people in Cape Town live in. The first part where the term Age of Iron comes up is: Mrs Curren does indeed think that the brutality is not something a handful of people partakes in but is a very big part in the nature of the people in Cape Town. However, she does underline that just like every other era in history, this time of brutality and racism will eventually come to an end. Coetzee brings together important themes in this book: aging, death, the confessor as hero, narrative representation, the meaning of freedom, the unity of man, familial relationships and the position of the white liberal in Apartheid South Africa. * Category:1990 novels Category:Apartheid novels Category:Novels by J.

The novel follows the story of Joel Backman, a newly pardoned prisoner who had tried to broker a deal to sell the world's most powerful satellite surveillance system to the highest bidder. Plot Joel Backman is \\"the Broker,\\" a considered to be one of the most powerful lobbyists in Washington, D.C.. However, Backman's life falls apart when a deal collapses involving a hacked spy satellite that nobody knows about, and he ends up in jail. Six years later, the political wheels have turned and other power-hungry men are eager for Backman's blood. Bargains are made, and after an outgoing disgraced President grants him a full pardon at the behest of the CIA, Backman finds himself spirited out of the prison in the middle of the night, bundled onto a military plane, and flown to Italy to begin a new life. He has a new name and mysterious new \\"friends\\" who teach him to speak the language and to blend in with the people in Bologna. However, Backman soon realizes that something is not quite kosher in this new setup, in that he is under constant surveillance. In reality, the CIA is setting him up for professional assassins from China, Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia and other countries. They intend to sit back and wait to see who kills him in an effort to solve the biggest mystery to hit the US government in decades: the question of who built this seemingly impenetrable and most advanced satellite ever. It turns out to be China; despite having low satellite technology, they stole the information from the US. Backman barely survives several assassination attempts and manages to establish communication with his son, Neal. He escapes surveillance and returns to his home to contract a new deal with the US government. The CIA is told about the satellite, along with the taking of the satellite's program. In return, they agree to do what they can to get the countries targeting him to back off, though they caution him that some of them will not listen. Backman then covers his escape by pretending that he is resuming his old life, then quietly disappears and presumably returns to Italy. Literary significance and criticism The Broker made number one on the New York Times bestseller list. The book has been hailed by some critics as a return to form for Grisham, while others lament it as a superficial \\"trip to Italy\\" put into fiction form. A New York Times book review claimed that the description of an outgoing president who was \\"an idiot... but a clean one\\" seemed to be referring to President Bush, or perhaps to Bill Clinton's infamous last-minute presidential pardons in 2001. The description of the town of Bologna, Italy, in the novel is quite accurate; however, it contains a few mistakes. For instance: * The church dedicated to Saint Petronius is called \\"cathedral\\", but although it is the largest church in town, it has never been the Cathedral of Bologna, as the author himself states elsewhere in the same book. * It is explained that Bologna is nicknamed \\"the Red city\\" because it is the most deeply communist town in Italy. Actually, Bologna was nicknamed \\"la Rossa\\" (\\"the Red one\\") centuries before Marx was born, the word \\"communism\\" was invented, or the colour red was even associated with a political ideology. This nickname is because most old buildings in the town centre are red, since the earth of the local hills, when baked to make bricks, acquires this colour. * One of the Italian teachers of the main character states that only two medieval towers are still standing in Bologna and that all the others were demolished by order of the local authorities in the nineteenth century. In reality, numerous medieval towers are still standing in Bologna. Some of them are clearly visible from the places the main character visits, like Piazza Maggiore or the top of the Asinelli Tower. After the municipality had three towers demolished in 1917 to build new palaces, the decision was harshly criticised by some famous people of that time. * Another error lies in the orbital mechanics of the secret satellite system. The satellites are described as having an over-ground speed of 120 miles per hour, but are only 300 miles above the Earth's surface; this is physically impossible for low-orbit satellites, which need an over-ground speed of over 16,000 miles per hour (and an orbital speed of about 17,000 miles per hour) to maintain orbit.

Mud is a related contributing factor that impairs military maneuvering in Russia and elsewhere, and is sometimes personified as \\"General Mud\\". Russians call those muddy conditions, rasputitsa, which occur with autumnal rains and spring thaws in Russia and make transport over unimproved roads difficult. Winter as a contributing factor to military defeat third Muscovite‚ÄìLithuanian War (1507‚Äì1508). In his study of winter warfare in Russia, author Allen F. Chew concludes that \\"General Winter\\" was a 'substantial contributing factor'‚Äînot a decisive one‚Äîin the military failures of both Napoleon's and Hitler's invasions of Russia. He notes that Napoleon's army was already suffering significant attrition before winter, owing to lack of supplies, disease, desertions and casualties of war. Likewise, Hitler's Wehrmacht had already suffered 734,000 in casualties and was running low on supplies in November 1941, before the arrival of winter. Examples=Swedish invasion of 1707 In the Great Northern War, Charles XII of Sweden invaded Russia in 1707. The Russians retreated, adopting a scorched-earth policy. This winter was the most brutal of the 18th century, so severe that the seaport of Venice froze during the Great Frost of 1709. Charles' 35,000 troops were crippled, and by spring only 19,000 were left. The Battle of Poltava in late June 1709 sealed the end of the Swedish Empire. French invasion of 1812 R√©aumur) plotted on the lower graph for the return journey. ‚Äì30 degrees R√©aumur = ‚Äì37.5 ¬∞C = ‚Äì35.5 ¬∞F Bivouac of Napoleon's Army during retreat from Russia in 1812. Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e of 610,000 men invaded Russia, heading towards Moscow, in the beginning of summer on 24 June 1812. The Russian army retreated before the French and again burnt their crops and villages, denying the enemy their use. Napoleon's army was ultimately reduced to 100,000. His army suffered further, even more disastrous losses on the retreat from Moscow, which started in October. Multiple sources concur that winter and its aftermath was only a contributing factor to Napoleon's defeat and retreat. To counter claims that the French defeat resulted from winter weather, Denis Davydov published a military historical analysis, titled \\"Was it Frost that Devastated the French Army in 1812?\\", wherein he demonstrated that the French suffered casualties in battles during relatively mild weather and outlined multiple causes for their defeat. He drew on both his direct observations and on those of foreign commentators, including French authors. According to Chew in 1981, the main body of Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e, initially at least 378,000 strong, \\"diminished by half during the first eight weeks of his invasion, before the major battle of the campaign. This decrease was partly due to garrisoning supply centres, but disease, desertions, and casualties sustained in various minor actions caused thousands of losses. At the Battle of Borodino on 7 September 1812‚Äîthe only major engagement fought in Russia‚ÄîNapoleon could muster no more than 135,000 troops and he lost at least 30,000 of them to gain a narrow and pyrrhic victory almost 600 miles inside hostile territory. The sequels were his uncontested and self-defeating occupation of Moscow and his humiliating retreat, which began on 19 October, before the first severe frosts later that month and the first snow on 5 November.\\" Lieven cites the difficulty of finding food for troops and forage for horses in winter as an important contributing factor. Allied intervention in Russia, winter 1918‚Äì19 During the Northern Russian Expedition of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, both sides, the Allied forces and the Bolshevik Red Army knew or quickly learned the principles of winter warfare and applied them whenever possible. However both sides had their resources strained and at times one side or other suffered the severe consequences of underpreparedness, but Chew concluded that winter did not provide a decisive advantage to any of the combatants. German invasion of 1941 During World War II, the Wehrmacht lacked necessary supplies, such as winter uniforms, due to the many delays in the German army's movements. At the same time, Hitler's plans for Operation Barbarossa actually miscarried before the onset of severe winter weather: neither Hitler nor the General Staff anticipated a long campaign lasting into the winter, and therefore adequate preparations, such as the distribution of warm clothing and winterization of vehicles and lubricants, were not made. In fact his eastern army suffered more than 734,000 casualties (about 23% of its average strength of 3,200,000) during the first five months of the invasion before the winter started. On 27 November 1941, Eduard Wagner, the Quartermaster General of the German Army, reported that \\"We are at the end of our resources in both personnel and material. We are about to be confronted with the dangers of deep winter.\\" Also of note is the fact that the unusually early winter of 1941 cut short the rasputitsa season, improving logistics in early November, with the weather still being only mildly cold. Winter effects on warfare In his 1981 paper, Fighting the Russians in Winter: Three Case Studies, Chew draws on experiences from the Allied-Soviet War in Northern Russia during the Winter of 1918‚Äì19, the destruction of the Soviet 44th Motorized Rifle Division, and German‚ÄìSoviet War during World War II to derive winter warfare factors pertaining to military tactics, materiel and personnel: * Tactics ‚Äì Defensive positions are highly advantageous because of the ability to maintain warmth and protection, compared to attacking in winter cold. Mobility and logistical support are often restricted by snow, requiring plowing or compacting it to accommodate wide-tracked vehicles or sleds. Infantry movement in deep snow requires skis or snowshoes to avoid exhaustion. Sound carries well over crusted snow, diminishing the element of surprise. Explosives are useful for excavating foxholes and larger shelters in frozen ground. Attacking field kitchens and encampments deprives the enemy of food and shelter. Rapid removal of the wounded from the battlefield is essential to their survival in the cold. * Materiel ‚Äì Weapons and vehicles require special lubricants to operate at low temperatures. Mines are unreliable in winter, owing to deep snow that may cushion the fuse or form an ice bridge over the detonator. * Personnel ‚Äì Proper winter clothing is required to maintain body heat and to avoid such cold injuries as frostbite. Troop efficiency and survival requires either making use of available shelter or providing portable shelter. Sandy Woodward, Royal Navy task force commander during the Falklands War, which was fought before the oncoming South Atlantic winter, remarked in his memoirs, \\"I thought then, for the first time, about the arrival of General Winter. If he had been here ten days ago, he would not have been much help to the Args [Argentines], dug in on the heights with no chance of their High Command getting their air forces into the skies. But I think he would‚Äôve finished us.\\" See also * Winter War ReferencesExternal links Category:National personifications Category:Military history of Russia Category:Winter in culture Category:Climate of Russia Category:Winter in the Soviet Union Category:Fictional generals ","title":"Russian Winter"},{"id":"1511602","text":"Van Ness station is an underground Muni Metro station on the Market Street subway at the intersection of Market Street and Van Ness Avenue (U.S. Route 101) in San Francisco, California.

He has composed many British television theme tunes, including EastEnders and Howards' Way, and the music for the 1988 film The Dawning. Biography Born in Devizes and a pupil of Dauntsey's School, May won a choral scholarship to Cambridge University, graduating with a degree in modern languages. While teaching languages and music at Kingston Grammar School, he co-wrote a musical named Smike with a colleague, history teacher Clive Barnett and songwriting partner, Roger Holman. Following the publicity Smike attracted, May was contacted by the BBC, who televised the play in 1973, starring Beryl Reid and Andrew Keir. It also featured DJ Neil Fox, a pupil at Kingston Grammar, as one of the schoolboys.PEBBLE MILL SPECIAL, SIMON MAY, BBC1, 20 December 1994 The show has subsequently been staged many times by youth drama groups. While working at ATV, he was asked to compose some music for Crossroads. Stephanie de Sykes got to number 2 in the UK Singles Chart in 1974 with the subsequent \\"Born With a Smile on My Face\\", which was used within a storyline on the show. Kate Robbins performed another of May's songs for Crossroads: \\"More Than in Love,\\" which was co-written by Barry Leng and got to number 2 in the UK in 1981. He was one of the members of the vocal harmony group Rain, together with de Sykes, Alex Keenan and Chas Mill. The group recorded the theme song \\"Golden Day\\", penned by Lynsey de Paul and Barry Blue, for the TV programme \\"The Golden Shot\\" to co-incide with the return of Bob Monkhouse as its host. They also released an album produced by Len Beadle, with the title \\"Rain Featuring Stephanie De-Sykes\\" in 1974. May himself performed \\"The Summer of My Life\\", which reached number seven in the UK Singles Chart in October 1976. The song originally appeared in Crossroads, in a scene between Meg and Hugh. It was one of the best selling singles of the year, and was one of few songs to spend three weeks in a row at number seven in the UK Singles Chart. His follow-up single, \\"We'll Gather Lilacs - All My Loving (Medley)\\", flopped, reaching number 49 in May 1977. In 1986 he released an album called Simon's Way, which included his themes to EastEnders and Howards' Way, which peaked at number 59 in the UK Albums Chart. In the same year his 'Holiday Suite' theme was used for the BBC Programme 'Holiday', and was released as a single. The theme has also been used by Video 125 for three of its railway drivers-eye-view productions. He worked on his first feature film in 1988 - The Dawning. Music from the film, together with various other TV themes (including The Olympic Track and People like You) was released in 1989 on the Simon May Orchestra album Themes. He co-produced Amii Stewart's \\"Knock on Wood\\", which reached number-one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in April 1979. EastEnders Tony Holland and Julia Smith commissioned May to write the theme to EastEnders after being impressed by his work on spy-thriller Cold Warrior. Don Black put lyrics to the popular theme, and Anita Dobson (who portrayed Angie Watts in the show) reached number 4 in the UK in August 1986 with \\"Anyone Can Fall in Love\\". With Barry Rose, the theme was adapted into a hymn, \\"Glory Be\\", which was performed on Songs of Praise and released on single. Another soap storyline gave May a hit in 1986. Nick Berry (\\"Wicksy\\") topped the charts with \\"Every Loser Wins\\", which he co-wrote after plugging it in EastEnders (a storyline which Holland openly hated). In 1993 the theme itself was given an unpopular 'jazzy' update, and an updated version of the original was introduced in 1994. With Johnny Griggs, he wrote another set of lyrics for the EastEnders theme. \\"I'll Always Believe in You\\" featured lead vocals by Sharon Benson. which was based around the extended version of the 1993 theme. In 2009 he was asked to revamp the EastEnders theme again, to update the one running from 1994, making it lighter in tone and bringing back elements of the original theme missing in the previous version. However it is worth noting that one major element of all the previous themes (bar the jazzy version) is missing - the bells, which are mainly replaced with the piano. Simon wrote \\"Peggy's Theme\\" for Barbara Windsor's exit episode from EastEnders screened on 10 September 2010. The single was released on iTunes on 4 September. Post- EastEnders Lyrics were also added to May's theme to Howards' Way; Marti Webb reached number 13 with \\"Always There\\" in 1986, a year after the orchestral version of the theme (credited to May and Leslie Osborne) had reached number 21 in the same UK Singles Chart. This was the version played over the opening credits of all six series, and the second half of the closing credits of series 1. The first part of the theme was a faster, upbeat rendition (later extended and slightly updated for the season 3 credits) which merged into the more familiar version used in the opening credits. The Marti Webb version of the theme was only played over the closing credits of series 2, with an updated extended version of the first half of the original series 1 orchestral version, playing over new style credits from series 3 onwards. Mike Read wrote lyrics to May's Trainer theme. \\"More to Life\\" was performed by Cliff Richard. The theme won May his third TRIC award for Best TV Theme, after previous success with EastEnders and Howards' Way. Following their collaboration on EastEnders, Julia Smith and Tony Holland commissioned May to write the theme tune for the new Eurosoap Eldorado. May reworked a song called \\"When You Go Away\\" which he had written for his ill-fated musical Mefisto, based on Goethe's Faust, adding Spanish guitars to make it more relevant to the Eldorado project. An instrumental version of the theme was used for the opening and closing credits. However, the vocal version of the song was recorded by Johnny Griggs, and was used over the closing credits of the final episode. In 1994, New Vintage: The Best of Simon May, a compilation of some of May's work was released to coincide with his \\"A Night Away From The TV\\" UK tour. The tour was not a commercial success and some dates had to be cancelled. A Pebble Mill special documentary was produced by the BBC around this time discussing his career and the tour. He has reached number one in Belgium with \\"Fragile Not Broken\\", sung by Natalia. He worked with Simon Lockyer and John Brant on \\"Music on Screen\\", and worked as a music therapist at Unsted Park near Godalming, Surrey. May recorded his latest album The Simon May Collection with his two co-writers/co-producers Simon Lockyer and John Brant. The album was released on 13 September 2010. \\"Peggy's Theme\\" was the lead track on the album. In August 2015 Simon May released his autobiography 'Doof Doof: My Life in Music' through Austin Macauley Publishers. Two versions were released; one, a book-only version and also a CD-set, with a shorter printed autobiography. May is visiting Professor at the Faculty of Media, Arts and Society, Southampton Solent University who in 2015 conferred on him the degree of Honorary Doctor of Music.

He was further created, on 12 August 1686, Earl of Melfort, Viscount of Forth and Lord Drummond of Riccartoun, Castlemains and Gilstoun, also in the peerage of Scotland, and with a similar remainder. A supporter of King James II and VII, Melfort escaped to France on 16 December 1688, following the \\"Glorious Revolution\\" which installed William of Orange and Mary II on the English and Scottish thrones. Drummond was further created Baron Cleworth in the Jacobite Peerage of England by the exiled monarch, on 7 August 1689, and Duke of Melfort, Marquess of Forth, Earl of Isla and Burntisland, Viscount of Rickerton and Lord Castlemains and Galston in the Jacobite Peerage of Scotland 17 April 1692, all with a similar remainder to the 1685 viscountcy. The 1st Earl and titular 1st Duke of Melfort was outlawed by the de facto r√©gime in England on 23 July 1694 and was attainted by Act of Parliament on 2 July 1695, when his honours became forfeit. In 1701, after the death of James II and VII, the Duke of Melfort was granted the honours and precedence of a French peer by Louis XIV. He and his descendants used the title \\"Duc de Melfort\\" in France, but this was a French translation of their Jacobite dukedom and not a French dukedom. The dukedom was never recognised by the governments of England and later of Great Britain. On 2 July 1800 the titular 4th Duke of Melfort succeeded as heir male to the attainted Earldom of Perth and as titular 9th Duke of Perth, Marquess of Drummond, Earl of Stobhall, Viscount of Cargill and Lord Concraig, on the death of his second cousin once removed, James Drummond, Lord Perth and Baron Drummond of Stobhall, a descendant of the 1st Earl and Duke of Melfort from his first marriage, to Sophie Maitland. In 1841 the titular 6th Duke of Melfort established his right before the French Council of State and the Tribunal de la Seine to the French titles of Duc de Melfort, Comte de Lussan and Baron de Valrose (his great-grandfather the 2nd Duke of Melfort had been married in 1707 to Marie Gabrielle d'Audebert, widow of the Duke of Albemarle and only daughter of Jean d'Audebert, Comte de Lussan). The titular 6th Duke of Melfort proved to the incumbent British authorities his descent from the 1st Earl of Melfort in 1848, and by a reversal of his ancestors' attainder on 28 June 1853 became 5th Earl of Perth and Lord Drummond of Stobhall, Earl of Melfort, Viscount of Forth and Lord Drummond of Riccartoun, Castlemains and Gilstoun, Viscount of Melfort and Lord Drummond of Gillestoun and Lord Drummond of Cargill.

The J Church line, which enters and exits the Market Street subway tunnel in a portal near the station, connects to this station at two surface-level platform. The inbound stop is near the corner of Church and Market Streets, while the outbound stop is near the corner of Church and 14th Streets. The F Market & Wharves streetcar line, running along Market Street, also has stops at the intersection. The N Judah line also exits the Market Street tunnel before reaching the Church Street station and stops one block away at Church and Duboce Avenue. At both Church Street station and Castro Street station, there is only one stairway on each side of Market Street leading into the station. (All other stations on the Market Street subway have entrances spread out along the length of the station.) One of these entrances is located on the northwest corner of Market and 14th Street, and the other is on the southwest corner of Market and Church Street. As part of August 2020 changes to Muni Metro, the J became an all-surface line. The J terminates at the inbound platform on Church Street, providing an accessible transfer between the J and subway trains.

The name Morar is also applied to the northern part of the peninsula containing the village, though North Morar is more usual (the region to the south west of Loch Morar is known as Arisaig, rather than South Morar). The coastline of the area forms part of the Morar, Moidart and Ardnamurchan National Scenic Area, one of 40 such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection by restricting certain forms of development. Morar has a railway station on the West Highland Line and is by-passed by the A830, part of the Road to the Isles, between Fort William and Mallaig. The village was formed of the farms and crofts of Bourblach, Beoraid Beg and Beoraid Mor with the modern village growing up around the railway station of Morar during the 20th century. The 1911 census suggests that the village name was not yet in regular use at the time, as only the old settlement names are used in it. The area is famous for its beaches, known as the \\"White Sands of Morar\\": one, which featured prominently in the film Local Hero, as well as in Breaking the Waves, is a few miles south of the village. Nearby Loch Morar is the deepest freshwater body in the British Isles and is linked to the sea by the short River Morar. Morar was a favourite winter travel destination of the noted English composer, Sir Arnold Bax (1883‚Äì1953), during the 1930s. He worked on his Third Symphony and each subsequent symphony during his visits to the Station Hotel there. History=Early history Loch Morar, and North Morar, with Loch Nevis in the distance, and Knoydart and Skye beyond that Following raids by Vikings, the district of Morar became part of the Kingdom of the Isles, a Norwegian dependency. In practice though, by the mid 12th century, the kingdom was divided; the portion containing Morar was known as Garmoran, and ruled by the MacRory. Following the 1266 Treaty of Perth, Garmoran became a Scottish crown dependency - the Lordship of Garmoran - still ruled by the MacRory, until the sole MacRory heir was Amy of Garmoran. Most of the remainder of the Kingdom of the Isles had become the Lordship of the Isles, ruled by the MacDonalds, whose leader, John of Islay, married Amy. After the birth of three sons, he divorced Amy and married the king's niece, in return for a substantial dowry. As part of the arrangement, John deprived his eldest son, Ranald, of the ability to inherit the Lordship of the Isles, in favour of a son by his new wife; as compensation, he made Ranald the Lord of Garmoran. The northern slopes of Morar However, at the end of the 14th century, on Ranald's death, his sons were still children, and Ranald's younger brother Godfrey took the opportunity to seize the Lordship of Garmoran. Furthermore, the heirs of Ranald's other brother Murdoch now made their own claim. This led to a great deal of violent conflict involving Godfrey's family (the Siol Gorrie) and those of his brothers (which is not described in surviving records in much detail). In 1427, frustrated with the level of violence generally in the highlands, together with the insurrection caused by his own cousin, King James I demanded that highland magnates should attend a meeting at Inverness. On arrival, many of the leaders were seized and imprisoned. Alexander MacGorrie, son of Godfrey, was considered to be one of the two most reprehensible, and after a quick showtrial, was immediately executed., p. 65 As Alexander had by now inherited Godfrey's de facto position as Lord of Garmoran, and in view of Ranald's heirs being no less responsible for the violence, King James declared the Lordship forfeit. Lairdship grants Loch Morar In 1469, James' grandson (James III) granted Lairdship of the lands of Garmoran and Uist to John, the Lord of the Isles. In turn, John passed it to his own half-brother, Hugh of Sleat; the grant to Hugh was confirmed by the king in a 1493 charter. The violence that led to Alexander's execution had brought the Siol Gorrie to the brink of extinction, and after Alexander's death they played no further part in Morar's history. Ranald's heirs (Clan Ranald) disputed and fought against the charter. Following Hugh of Sleat's death, in 1498, and for reasons that are not remotely clear, his son John immediately resigned, transferring all authority to the king. In 1539 the king granted Morar to the MacDonells of Glengarry, a group who claimed descent from Ranald's son Donald. Morar from the North Over the course of the 16th century, following an inheritance dispute over the lands of MacDonalds of Lochalsh, there were several violent encounters between the MacDonells and the MacKenzies. At the end of the century, the MacKenzies now sought to complain about MacDonell behaviour in court, but the MacDonell leadership wouldn't turn up, so in 1602, the MacKenzies laid waste to Morar as punishment. This led to the MacDonells waging battle against the MacKenzies in the Battle of Morar.

April was later voiced by Renae Jacobs in the 1987 animated series, by Veronica Taylor in the 2003 animated series, and by Sarah Michelle Gellar in the 2007 film TMNT. In the 2012 animated series, April is voiced by Mae Whitman, in which she is her late teens. In film, she has been portrayed by Judith Hoag (1990), Paige Turco (1991 and 1993), Megan Fox (2014 and 2016) and by Malina Weissman as the younger version of the character in the 2014 film. Comics=Mirage Comics In the original Mirage Comics storyline for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, April O'Neil was a skilled computer programmer and assistant to a famous yet nefarious scientist, Baxter Stockman. She helped program his MOUSER robots but, after discovering Baxter was using them to burrow into bank vaults, she fled his workshop. Robots chased her into the sewer where she was promptly saved by three of the Turtles. The Turtles later successfully fended off a MOUSER invasion. After leaving her job with Baxter, April decided to open an antique shop. The shop was subsequently destroyed in a battle between the Turtles and Shredder and the Foot Clan. April and the Turtles retreated to a farm house in Northampton, Massachusetts to recover and during this time she suffered recurrent nightmares about the Foot Clan's attack.Eastman, Kevin and Peter Laird. IDW's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Color Classics #11. Jun 5, 2011, IDW. During the mid-1990s, April became romantically involved with the violent vigilante Casey Jones, and the two of them eventually raised Shadow, the child of Casey's late wife Gabrielle, as their own. In Volume 2 of the TMNT comics, April was attacked by a huge robot controlled by the brain of her former boss, Baxter Stockman, and injected with nanobots. With the help of the Utroms, the Turtles injected April with turtle versions of nanobots to stop Baxter's plan. The intervention saved April before Baxter's nanobots could reach her brain stem and kill her. The attack rendered April sterile. To deal with the emotional strain she became a female version of \\"Nobody\\", a vigilante crime fighter, until her identity was discovered by Casey Jones. With the help of Renet, a time-traveler who took April back through time, it was revealed that April was really a living drawing brought to life with the help of Kirby's crystal. She was drawn by her father before his own biological daughter Robyn O'Neil was born. Although anything that Kirby drew with pencil would vanish after a while, April's father used a pen, which might explain why April lived past thirty without vanishing. Questions of realness and morality were too much for April; she bid farewell to Shadow and Casey and travelled to Alaska to be alone with her thoughts. Although the trip helped April cope with her demons and led to her eventual return to New York, her family history remained unexplored. The Mirage Studios version of April has dark brown/black hair (though early color reprints of Volume 1 depicted her hair color as red/light brown). Most subsequent incarnations of April are redheads. In the September 1985 re- printing of issue one, artist Ryan Brown depicts April as a katana-wielding ninja warrior in his back cover pin-up. Archie Comics In the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures series produced by Archie Comics, April began as a carbon copy of her animated counterpart from the 1987 TV series, but the writers developed her into a competent warrior after training with Splinter. Because of her frequent adventures with the Turtles, she lost her job at Channel 6 and became a freelance reporter. In the winter 1994 Archie Special, April was mutated into a turtle herself. This made her the first official female turtle introduced to the series, three years before Venus de Milo's debut. Archie also published two sets of three-part April O'Neil mini-series. Dreamwave Productions The second issue of the Dreamwave Productions series (based on the 2003 animated series) focused entirely on O'Neil, consisting of a dream sequence showing how she had been pressured into a scientific career by her family despite having an interest in journalism. IDW In the continuity of the IDW comics, April is a very bright science student who interns at Baxter Stockman's genetic laboratory Stock Gen, where her father used to work before a stroke rendered him paralyzed. It is there that she first meets the Turtles and Splinter (at that time ordinary lab animals subjected to an intelligence-enhancing serum) and gives the Turtles their names. April later nearly becomes a murder victim during a nocturnal break-in by a group of ninjas (the Foot Clan), who steal the Turtles along with several samples of Stockman's secret mutagenetic projects; the attempt at her life shakes her so much that she decides to take self-defense lessons from her fellow student Casey Jones, who later introduces her to the now-mutated Turtles and Splinter. April subsequently accompanies or assists the Turtles in their adventures and battles against their enemies, in the course of which she investigates Stockman's clandestine operations and makes an important contact in the Pantheon by incurring the sympathies of one of their members, Aka. While she and Casey begin a romantic relationship, Casey's self-doubts about his ability to protect his loved ones eventually cause them to drift apart. Television=Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 series) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 - 1996) for the first seven seasons In the 1987 cartoon series, April Harriet O'Neil was introduced as a television reporter for Channel 6 News. She had a strong nature and passion for her work, frequently expressing disagreement with her employer Burne Thompson's assignments. She also fell out repeatedly with Vernon Fenwick, the director/camera operator whose enormous ego compelled him to scoop April on her stories whenever possible. April was best friends with Irma Langinstein, the receptionist at Channel 6. She lived in an apartment in New York City, though during the course of the series she was forced to relocate several times due to a variety of Turtle-related mishaps. April was reporting on a series of high-tech equipment thefts when she came under attack by a gang of street punks. Thinking quickly, she managed to squeeze into a storm drain and ran from the mob until she hit a dead end. The Turtles were nearby and defeated the punks. She was taken back to their sewer lair, where they explained their origins to her. At first, she believed them to be responsible for the equipment thefts, but they agreed to help find the true culprits if she kept quiet about the Turtles' existence. April quickly became their major link to the outside world since their unusual appearance effectively precluded them from functioning above ground without some sort of disguise. To communicate with the Turtles, she used a Turtlecom radio. April's friendship with the Turtles resulted in the opportunity to film exclusive footage of their encounters with Shredder, but despite her intimate knowledge of the details of their lives, she tended to keep her professional news reports about them impersonal and mysterious. She was a vocal champion of their cause, despite Burne Thompson's opinion that the Turtles were a menace to the city, and most episodes generally showed her attempting to convince Burne and the New Yorkers that the Turtles were not criminals. By the episode \\"Doomquest,\\" she finally succeeded in this by publicly exposing Lord Dregg's plans to take over the Earth via propaganda campaigns. April was frequently kidnapped by Shredder and used as bait in order to lure the Turtles out of hiding and destroy them. April revealed her age in the Season 3 episode \\"Leather Head - Terror of The Swamp\\". In Florida on vacation, she and the Turtles found a body of water contaminated with a mutagen that made mutants feel youthful, while physically de-aging humans into four-year-old versions of themselves. Donatello did not allow April to enter the water, to which she lamented, \\"Oh, great! I'm doomed to be a decrepit twenty-eight-year-old hag!\\" Her Aunt Agatha (\\"Aggie\\"), who appeared in the episodes \\"Case of the Hot Kimono\\" and \\"Sleuth on the Loose\\", was a detective. April was normally portrayed as a capable and independent woman. Her most important contribution to the Turtles was her access to research via the Channel 6 computers; using this information she could alert the Turtles to trouble and possible case leads. Her blue news van had classic headlights and the Channel 6 News logo on each side. April could usually be found wearing a distinctive yellow jumpsuit with white boots. By the ninth season, April worked freelance for reasons never specified, and exchanged her yellow jumpsuit for a brown leather jacket. She continued to help the Turtles even after the defeat of Shredder and his subsequent exile to Dimension X. At the young adult age of 28, April has high reflexes and deduction skills. Being a news reporter, she is able to find and gather information for the Turtles and Splinter. She is also skilled at operating a number of different vehicles. =Portrayal= April was originally voiced by Renae Jacobs. In the 25th Anniversary crossover TV special Turtles Forever, she was voiced by Rebecca Soler. Renae Jacobs auditioned for the role in Los Angeles in 1986. She developed her initial personification of O'Neil while preparing for the audition, having not read the comics. Her first day on set voice director Stu Rosen made it clear he did not approve of her for the role, and had waited to show her audition last, saying to her, \\"Every one I played, the producers said ‚ÄòNo, no, no, that‚Äôs not April,‚Äô and finally I was out of people to show them, so I pulled your audition out and played it for them and they said ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs April!‚Äô\\" Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 series) In the 2003 cartoon series, April, voiced by Veronica Taylor in English, got a costume change and her hair color was altered to a dark magenta tone for the new incarnation of the animated series produced by 4Kids Entertainment. However, her role was similar to that of the Mirage Studios character: again, she served as an assistant to Baxter Stockman until his Mouser experiments got out of control, and after the Turtles saved her she became a faithful friend, ally, and \\"big sister\\" to them. April made much more use of her scientific expertise and she often used her computer skills to aid the Turtles. She developed a closer relationship to Donatello, who shared many of her interests. In Season 7 she sometimes helped Donatello to collect Splinter's data bits. April developed a modest knowledge of combat skills after training with Splinter. Her quick thinking was often instrumental to the Turtles' survival. April is romantically attracted to Casey Jones, though their contrasting personalities often make them bicker. By the third season, the two seemed to have quite a serious romantic relationship. In the series finale, \\"Wedding Bells and Bytes\\", she and Casey finally got married. The young adult April continues to learn how to defend herself against Foot ninjas and other monstrosities by undergoing basic ninja training from the Turtles. She is quite skilled in some useful firearms, and can easily go through a laser grid with no problem at all. In the seventh and final season, she dons a yellow-and-black jumpsuit based on the TMNT film and carries a tant≈ç sword to further perfect her fighting skills. At one point, she became psionically linked with a female mermaid-like mutant who had telepathically shown her the hardships of her childhood and that the few of her kind were on the verge of extinction. In addition to her recently developed ninjutsu skills, April is incredibly intelligent, smart and resourceful in complex scientific fields; similar to her good friend Donatello. So much that she even had worked for the eccentric Baxter Stockman as his assistant. She was able to hack into the computers of Shredder's stronghold and even breach several codes. She was seen wielding a katana in the special episode \\"Turtles Forever\\". Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 series) Mae Whitman voices the teenage April O'Neil in the 2012 computer-animated series. Her shoulder-length bright orange hair is tied with a white ponytail holder which becomes undone, at times, if she is under great stress or rage. Unlike her previous counterparts, she is a sixteen-year- old teenager (as opposed to being a young adult in her late twenties) and possesses exceptionally strong psychic powers, which she eventually learns to develop more and increase drastically throughout the fourth season. This is due to her being a half human, half Kraang-mutant as her mother was abducted and experimented on by the Kraang before she was born. Her inherent psionic abilities are first hinted at in Episode 7, \\"Monkey Brains\\", when she had detected that a mutant-monkey was, in fact, a human scientist; merely saying that she \\"sometimes get a feeling about things\\", implying that she possesses extrasensory abilities as well. It even enabled her to hear far off sounds that Splinter, with his superhuman hearing, could not. Befriending the Turtles after they rescue her from the Kraang, she is a valuable and dependable ally; able to go up the surface in broad daylight when the Turtles cannot. She is later offered by Splinter to be trained in ninjutsu in order to become a full- fledged kunoichi. Her original weapon was a metal tessen fan, but later earns a special tant≈ç sword to symbolize her high status as a ninja. At one point, when they were trying stop the Kraang from bringing mutagen supplies to Shredder and her father Kirby ended up getting mutated into a bat during the mission, April found out that the Turtles cockiness had caused her father's accidental mutation as she overacts and accuses them for doing it on purpose then walked out on them. After her fall out with the Turtles, April tried to go back to her normal life and during that time she befriended Casey Jones. However, when Donnie and Casey at different times say that some things are just beyond their control, April realizes that she overreacted on the Turtles for something that was an honest accident and was wrong to be so hard on them, especially Donnie. When she and Casey came under attack by the Foot Clan, April tried to defend herself on her own but realizes that both her friends were right about things being too out of control and decided to put her grudge aside to call the Turtles, mainly Donnie, for help. After dealing with the Foot Clan and having forgiven the Turtles for their honest mistake, April was about to make amends with the them but left to go see if Casey was ok before she had the chance to apologise to them. However, April arrives at the lair to formally apologise to the Turtles for overreacting and being too hard on them. April even assured the Turtles that she knows what happen was all an accident and never wants to hold a grudge ever again then thanked Donnie for being there for her even when she didn't want him to. She is mentally capable of sensing the presence of others nearby, seeing into a person's very soul, and psionically hearing the thoughts of the Kraang. Under pressure, she emits an incredibly strong psionic wave that incapacitates those around her. At one point, she displayed the telekinetic ability to levitate several cards in midair, and became mentally linked with a fish-bird-worm mutant. In the 14-episode Outer Space saga (the first half of Season Four), April donned a yellow spacesuit that resembles her 1980s suit and used a ray gun for defense. For the second half of Season 4, it is now black with yellow stripes to indicate her high status as full-fledged kunoichi. Upon being given a small fragment of the mystical Sol Star from the ancient Aeons, her inherent psionic abilities have further developed and grew considerably much stronger; to the point of having full and far greater use of her telekinesis, mentally detect lies and discern truth from her victims, and sense incoming danger. She even began telekinetically controlling the direction of her metal tessen fan, making its targeting range more accurate from a distance. She eventually learned to erect an exceptionally strong telekinetic shield for defense, make a soft landing, and lift herself and her friends in the air by encasing them in a light yellow orb of telekinetic energy. In addition, she is now fully capable of tracking mutants, wherever they may be; another of the many more psychic and extrasensory abilities her Sol Star necklace helped her to develop. According to Splinter, her natural intuition is very near perfection, as it is one of the many powerful psionic abilities that she possesses. In the fifth and last season of the show (titled Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), April continues to be there for the Turtles and help them adjust to moving on with their lives without Splinter. Unfortunately, her innate, extraordinarily strong mental powers prove to be ineffective against the mighty demodragon, Kavaxas, as he is not of the earthly plane. She worked together with Karai in finding Bebop heading to Don Visiozo's restaurant, where a vial containing the heart of the Super Shredder was being held. Aware of the Seal of the Ancients power over Kavaxas, she attempted to use it by combing its dark magic with her own growing sensory abilities, but was unsuccessful. Intrigued by her unique human/Kraang nature, Kavaxas desired to sallow her very essence in order to obtain her increasingly powerful mental abilities for himself, despite that they are ineffective on him. As the showdown between Kavaxas and the revived Zombie Shredder grew imminent, she, Casey and the Turtles were approached by several Foot cultists, April psionically detected a change of heart from Fishface. Later, she stayed with Casey, Raphael and Donatello, to try and stop the dozens of spirits' of the departed with Donnie's new specter-destroyers. She was amazed by the sudden arrival of Splinter's spirit, who had arrived to hold off Ho Chan. Afterwards, she, the Turtles, Karai and Leatherhead, all bed their final goodbyes to Hamato Yoshi's spirit, as he returned to the afterlife. She was soon comforted by the appearance of the sunset, as she was sure that they would never see one again and remained to enjoy its everlasting beauty and warmth before heading back to the Lair. Some time later, April fought alongside the Turtles, Mona Lisa, and Karai to put an end to the rogue Salamandrian called \\"the Newtralizer\\". When he blasts with his electrical bursts, she defended herself by erecting a yellow shield out of telekinetic energy. She used her extraordinarily strong telekinesis to open the water pipes, which appeared to weaken and disorient him. When Lord Dregg later invaded, she joined Raphael, Mona Lisa and Bishop in the Turtle Mech to try and overpower his spaceship. Once confronting Dregg directly, she tried to hold him off with her tant≈ç sword but he proved too strong. In a three-part special episode, which is somehow set in a fifty-year apocalyptic future, \\"Raphael: Mutant Apocalypse\\", April is killed along with the entire human population and most mutants from being hit with a mutagen bomb that had been mysteriously triggered by an unknown adversary. For some reason, she was not able to shield herself from the massively powerful blast with her extraordinarily strong psionic/extrasensory powers whatsoever. In \\"The Curse of Savanti Romero\\", she is turned into a vampire-zombie and utilized her incredibly strong psionic/extrasensory powers against the Ninja Turtles. In \\"The Frankenstein Experiment\\", she is ordered by her \\"master\\" Dracula to seek out the Turtles and eliminate them. In the Lair, she succeeded in biting Donatello and turning him into a full vampire as well. She returns to normal at the end of \\"Monsters Among Us\\" when Mikey kills Dracula. Leonardo explains to her about their time- traveling ally Renet, that she is \\"the greatest time master that ever lived.\\" In \\"Wanted: Bebop & Rocksteady\\", April and the Turtles meets the 1987 counterparts of the Ninja Turtles, who seeks help to stop Krang and Shredder, who recruited the present Bebop and Rocksteady. In \\"The Foot Walks Again\\", April and Casey split from the Turtles, who are busy training their 1987 counterparts, to find Karai and Shinigami to stop Bebop and Rocksteady from working with Kraang and the Shredder of the 1987s dimension. In \\"The Big Blowout\\", she fought alongside all eight Ninja Turtles, Casey, Karai, Shinto witch Shinigami and three members of the Mighty Mutanimals-Slash, Leatherhead and Mondo Gecko- to put an end to Krang and Shredder, unknowingly putting an end to Bebop and Rocksteady's villainous ways in doing so. During the heated skirmish, she had saved the two Donatellos from being crushed by stopping the two rock monstrosities in their tracks telekinetically. She tried to utilize her extraordinarily strong mental powers on Krang, but he had blasted her with a purple energy ray, which seemed to have an effect on her and her strong mental and extrasensory abilities, as it knocked her unconscious. After Krang and Shredder plans for inter-dimensional annihilation were thwarted by none other than Bebop and Rocksteady, she promoted the former villains to stop robbing banks and working for super villains. Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2018) April O'Neil has been changed into a streetwise teenage girl in the 2018 cartoon, Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. She is voiced by Kat Graham. Films= Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film) In the first live-action film, April was played by Judith Hoag. She was a television reporter working for Channel 3 news under Charles \\"Chuck\\" Pennington, doing an investigative series on mysterious thefts in New York City whose culprits vanished without a trace. One night while leaving work, she is accosted by teenage thieves in league with the Foot Clan, but the Turtles appear and save her under the cover of darkness. In the aftermath, April discovers and grabs Raphael's lost sai; Raphael soon follows her to retrieve the weapon and saves her again when she is attacked by a group of Foot Ninja in the subway. During the attack, April is knocked unconscious while trying to fight them off with her purse. Unsure what to do with her, Raphael carries her to the Turtles' sewer lair. Though afraid at first, April eventually comes to regard the Turtles and Splinter as friends, even letting them stay in her apartment after the Foot Clan discovered and destroyed their sewer dwellings. Mirroring the Mirage Studios storyline, April is fired from her news job and the Foot once again attack the Turtles in the antique shop, prompting April, the Turtles, and Casey Jones to retreat to her family's farmhouse in Northampton, Massachusetts. She keeps a journal documenting their forced sabbatical in addition to drawing sketches of the Turtles. She grows extremely close to the four brothers: Michelangelo, who initially confesses to having a crush on April, later addressing her as \\"Sis,\\" indicating the role she has come to occupy in the Turtles' family. During their respite, April also develops a kind of love-hate relationship with Casey Jones. By the end of the film, she accepts her attraction to him and in the aftermath of Shredder's defeat as well as getting her job back (she had been fired earlier in the film), April asks Casey for a kiss. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze In the sequel, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze, April was played by Paige Turco. She provides the Turtles and Splinter with a place to stay after the destruction of their lair in the previous film, and helps them research the company responsible for the mutagen that transformed the Turtles into their present state. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: Turtles in Time In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: Turtles in Time, Paige Turco reprised her role as April O'Neil. In the film, April is temporarily transported to feudal Japan, forcing the Turtles to travel back in time to rescue her. TMNT April was voiced by Sarah Michelle Gellar in the 2007 CGI film TMNT. Following the continuity from the previous films, it appeared that she and Casey Jones were engaged in a genuinely close romance, living together in Casey's apartment, and working for a shipping firm. She found Leonardo in Central America at the start of the film while seeking an artifact for Max Winters. No mention was made of her past as a journalist; instead, she now appears to be involved in archaeology. April takes up several forms of ninjutsu training from Splinter, purchasing a slim black-and-yellow jumpsuit of armor from Japan, and becoming quite skilled in the use of a katana. She demonstrates her combative skills in a one-on-one fight with the far more experienced female ninja Karai. A collectible booklet packed in with her action figure for the film implies that she had become a master of the katana. The figure itself includes a katana, tonfa, and two shoulder armored pads; this outfit was replicated for the movie. In the film's alternate ending, Casey proposes marriage to April and she accepts. This scene is absent from the final cut of the movie but can be found on the DVD.  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)  Megan Fox as April O'Neil in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles April appears in the reboot Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with Megan Fox playing the role. During the film, it is revealed that not only was April's father involved in the creation of the turtles as his experiments created the mutagen that turned them into what they are now, but that the young April was responsible for the Turtles and Splinter escaping the destruction of the lab where they were created when she released them into the sewers after the lab was destroyed by her father to prevent Shredder and Eric Sacks getting access to the mutagen. It was reported there was a filmed but unused scene of a fight between April, Vernon Fenwick, Karai, and The Foot in downtown Manhattan that was cut from the finished film. Will Arnett, who played Vernon, said his character \\"comes out just at the right moment [and] hits Karai with the gurney and knocks her off balance a little bit. Then April kind of finishes her off.\\" Fox was given a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress for her portrayal of O'Neil. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows Fox reprised her role in the sequel Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. Other appearances In the two- part anime Mutant Turtles: Superman Legend, April was voiced by Emi Shinohara. April made a live-action appearance in the TMNT: Coming Out of Their Shells musical tour played by Sherie Rene Scott whose role was to incite the live audience to interact with the stage performers and encourage the Turtles when needed. Video games April has appeared in most of the TMNT video games, usually as the damsel in distress who has been captured by Shredder (or by Karai in case of SNES version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters). In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time, she kicks the story off with a brief report where Krang steals the Statue of Liberty and later appears in the game ending; she also appears onscreen in the SNES version to encourage the Turtles to fight when the player characters are idle.Allgame review of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time. URL retrieved 22nd July 2006. In Konami's series of TMNT games based on the 2003 cartoon series, April resembles her cartoon counterpart and often shows up in various cutscenes to give advice and advance the plot of the game. April appears as a playable character in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters for the NES, where her game character bears little resemblance to the 1987 cartoon likeness. In TMNT: Mutant Melee, April is again a playable character and participates in multi-player battles. She is also a playable character in Ubisoft's TMNT: Smash-Up where she is based on the ninja April from the 2007 film. She also appears in the 2014 film-based game by Activision for the Nintendo 3DS, voiced by Julie Nathanson. Action figures In the TMNT toy lines produced by Playmates Toys, April O'Neil has appeared in several action figure incarnations. The first of these had a limited production run, and lacked a blue stripe on her jumpsuit; it was replaced with a yellow-striped version with greater circulation. An alternate version was released in 1990, with a head sculpt closer to her cartoon incarnation, orange boots, and further modification. Another variation was released in 1993 packaged exclusively with the Channel 6 Newsman vehicle; this April had the same sculpt of the 1990 release although her jumpsuit is green and the boots yellow. Other notable April figures include the 1992 version, dubbed simply \\"April\\" with purple accents on her jumpsuit; \\"April, the Ravishing Reporter\\", which was the first such figure to feature rooted hair; \\"April, the Ninja Newscaster\\", who came with one of each of the Turtles' signature weapons; and \\"Mutatin' April,\\" part of the Mutations assortment in which April can transform into a humanoid cat (inspired by the original series' episode \\"The Cat Woman from Channel Six\\"). For the 2003 TV series, Playmates introduced two O'Neil figures; a standard sized April with bonus Mouser robots and a miniature April. There is also an April figure based on her appearance in the 2007 film, wearing her yellow ninja outfit. NECA released an O'Neil figure based on her original Mirage Studios appearance.

Its ports to several computer and console systems followed in 1999‚Äì2000. It is the third installment of the Heroes of Might and Magic series. The game's story is first referenced throughout Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven and serves as a prequel to Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor. The player can choose to play through seven different campaigns telling the story, or play in a scenario against computer or human opponents. The gameplay is very similar to its predecessors in that the player controls a number of heroes that command an army of creatures inspired by myth and legend. The gameplay is divided into two parts, tactical overland exploration and a turn-based combat system. The player creates an army by spending resources at one of the eight town types in the game. The hero progresses in experience by engaging in combat with enemy heroes and monsters. The conditions for victory vary depending on the map, including conquest of all enemies and towns, collection of a certain amount of a resource, or finding the grail artifact. Heroes III was released to universal acclaim and was praised by critics. The game received the expansion packs Heroes of Might and Magic III: Armageddon's Blade and Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Shadow of Death. Heroes Chronicles, a series of short introductory games based on the Heroes III engine, was also released. A special version of Heroes III titled Heroes III Complete, which included the original game and both expansion packs, was released in 2000. On December 10, 2014, Ubisoft announced an HD version of the game. The new version features updated graphics as well as widescreen compatibility and was released on January 29, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, iOS and Android. However, the expansions have not been re-released because their source code is lost.  Gameplay Gameplay consists of strategic exploration on the world map and tactical turn-based combat. As with the series in general, the player controls a number of \\"heroes\\" who act as generals and command troops comprising various types of creatures inspired by myth and legend. The player can complete or \\"win\\" a map by completing the objectives set out by the creator of the map. Objectives may include eliminating all the other factions in the game, gathering a set amount of resources, or piecing together a puzzle to find the Grail artifact. If a player loses all of their towns they will have seven game days to capture a new town. If they fail to do so they lose and the game ends. If a player loses all their heroes and towns, they will lose the game. There are two \\"layers\\" to the world map: the aboveground and the underground. There are typically subterranean gateways that lead to and from the underground. Maps are filled with a huge variety of buildings, treasures, monsters, mines and so forth that reward extensive exploration. At the very least, a player must locate mines and flag them (whereupon they provide constant resources), since these resources are required to develop towns. The player must also develop his heroes' skills, both by battling creatures (and enemy heroes) and by acquiring artifacts or visiting special locations. Heroes are given a choice of skills to upgrade upon leveling up, as well as becoming better at combat or using magic. The skills must be chosen carefully, since they are permanent and only a limited number of skills can be learned. The player's towns serve many functions, but most importantly they allow recruitment of creatures to form armies. Towns also provide funds, new spells and a fortified location to make a last stand against an invading enemy hero. To build new structures within a town requires gold and usually one or more type of resource. Wood and ore are needed for most structures, but more expensive buildings also require rarer resources (mercury, crystal, gems or sulfur). All factions require a disproportionate quantity of just one of these special resources, making the acquisition of a corresponding mine essential to victory. This same resource is also needed when hiring the most powerful creatures available to that faction. Each faction also has a handful of unique structures available only to them. If a player finds the Grail artifact, he can deliver it to a town to make that town the Grail's permanent home by creating a special structure. The Grail bestows greatly increased creature growth and weekly income, in addition to a bonus unique to the town. The eight different castles available in Heroes III are classified as good, evil, and neutral. Each town has seven basic creatures, each of which can be upgraded to a more powerful variant. Each town also features two associated hero types: one that leans more toward might (combat), and one that leans more toward magic. Plot The game's story unfolds primarily through a series of seven playable campaigns, all set upon the continent of Antagarich. During the campaigns, the story is told from alternating points of view, giving players the opportunity to play as each of the town alignments. Following the disappearance of King Roland Ironfist of Enroth prior to Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven, his wife, Queen Catherine, is left to rule the realm. In the meantime, her father, King Gryphonheart of Erathia, is assassinated. Without their beloved King, the kingdom of Erathia falls to the dark forces of Nighon and Eeofol. Queen Catherine returns home to Antagarich seeking to rally the people of her homeland and lead them against the evil that has ravaged their nation. Erathia's capital of Steadwick is sacked by the dungeon lords of Nighon and the Kreegans of Eeofol. Meanwhile, the nations of Tatalia and Krewlod skirmish at the western border, seizing the chance to expand their territory. Catherine's first task is to establish a foothold in the conquered kingdom by enlisting the aid of allies. The wizards of Bracada and the elves of AvLee answer her call, and together they push towards Steadwick and eventually retake it, quickly quelling the border war in the west. Soon after, Lucifer Kreegan, a commander in the Eeofol armies, sends an envoy to Erathia claiming that Roland Ironfist is captive within their territories. AvLee invades Eeofol, but fails to rescue Roland, who is transported to their northern holdings. Afterwards, Catherine invades Nighon, pushing the dungeon armies back to their island home. In the meantime, the necromancers of Deyja, having been responsible for the assassination of King Gryphonheart, plot to revive his corpse as a lich. They plan to use his wisdom in leading their own armies of the undead. However, King Gryphonheart's will proves too much for the necromancers even in his corrupted state, and he becomes a rogue lich. Having little other recourse, Queen Catherine is forced to ally herself with the necromancers and together they set out to destroy the lich of King Gryphonheart before he becomes too powerful. A final bonus campaign, accessible only after the main campaigns are complete, tells the story of separatists living in the Contested Lands, a war-torn border between Erathia and AvLee. Tired of the skirmishes that bring unrest to their homelands, they join together to fight for independence from the two large kingdoms. It is later implied that this rising was orchestrated by Archibald Ironfist, the antagonist of Heroes of Might and Magic II. Release The game was originally released for PC Windows on March 3, 1999. An Apple Macintosh port was released by 3DO, and a Linux port was released by Loki Software, both in late December that year. In 2000, a Game Boy Color port entitled Heroes of Might and Magic 2 was released. A straight Dreamcast port retaining the original title was also developed and completed, but it wasn't released due to technical issues that prevented the console running the game adequately.  Expansion packs  Two official expansion packs were released for Heroes III. The first of these expansions, Armageddon's Blade, introduced a ninth town alignment, the Conflux; a random scenario generator, a variety of new creatures, heroes, and structures; and six new playable campaigns. The second expansion, The Shadow of Death, was a stand-alone expansion that included Restoration of Erathia and added seven new playable campaigns and a variety of new artifacts, including Combination Artifacts. Combination Artifacts were extremely powerful items assembled by collecting a specific set of lesser artifacts. Complete edition In 2000, a bundle containing Heroes III and both expansion packs was released as Heroes of Might and Magic III: Complete. More than just bundling the original game discs, however, this release reworked the game's installation process as well as its in-game menus to reflect a unified product. Heroes of Might & Magic III ‚Äì HD Edition On January 29, 2015, about 15 years after the original release of Heroes of Might & Magic III, Ubisoft released a new high-definition version of the game compatible with PCs as well as Android and iOS tablets. The expansion packs were not included because the source code for those releases was lost. Reception=Sales Heroes of Might and Magic III entered PC Data's weekly computer game sales charts at #3 for the February 28-March 6 period. It held the position for another two weeks, before exiting the weekly top 10 in its fourth week. It was the United States' second-best-selling computer game of March 1999. PC Data, which tracked sales in the United States, reported that Heroes III had sold 185,553 copies by September 2000. The combined global sales of the Heroes series had reached 1.5 million copies by December 1999. Critical reviews Heroes III was praised by critics,Heroes of Might & Magic III: If it ain't broke, don't fix it--the Heroes series triumphantly returns from IGN. receiving an average score of 87% in GameRankings. Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"While realtime strategy withers on the vine, with many recent releases lackluster at best, HoMM reminds us that turn-based play is alive and well. In fact, it's hard to remember why people said turn-based was dead in the first place.\\" Computer Gaming Worlds Robert Coffey said that the game \\"expands upon the insanely addictive play of the previous edition, retaining the core gameplay while enhancing almost every facet of the game\\". He continued to say that the game is \\"mind-boggling in its depth\\", but criticized its uneven campaign pacing and \\"sluggish\\" connection speeds during online play. He concluded: \\"Ultimately, the rewards of Heroes of Might and Magic III far outweigh its few drawbacks. ... [This] is a game that strategy fans should absolutely be playing\\". Heroes of Might and Magic III was a finalist for Computer Games Strategy Pluss 1999 \\"Strategy Game of the Year\\" prize, although it lost to RollerCoaster Tycoon. The editors wrote that Heroes of Might and Magic III \\"keeps this series running on all cylinders.

Life He was the Almohad governor of Gab√®s and then of Tunis by 1229, having inherited this position in Tunisia from his father and then was appointed in Gab√®s by his brother. Abu Zakariya would rebel on the central authority after he heard that the Almohad caliph in Marrakesh al-Ma'mun, has overthrown and killed two of his brothers and that he cancelled the creed of Ibn Tumart. Additionally, al-Ma'mun instructed the Imams to insult Ibn Tumart in the mosques and cancelled the call to prayer in Berber. Abu Zakariya, then declared himself independent late in 1229. He subsequently captured Constantine and Bougie in 1230 and annexed Tripolitania in 1234, Algiers in 1235 and subdued important tribal confederations of the Berbers from 1235 to 1238. In 1242 he captured Tlemcen, forcing the Sultan of Tlemcen to become his vassal. In the December of that year, caliph Abd al-Wahid II, died, leaving Abu Zakariya as the most powerful ruler of Maghreb. By the end of his reign, the Marinid Dynasty of Morocco and several Muslim princes in Al-Andalus paid him tribute and acknowledged his nominal authority. A skillful general, his ability to utilize the military power of the tribesmen enabled him to establish a strong state. His Hafsid dynasty brought peace, prosperity, and stability to Tunisia.

Several members of the population of four villages were killed; the exact number of casualties has varied according to source. Background In 1998, Algeria was near the peak of a brutal civil conflict that had begun after the military's cancellation of 1992 elections set to be won by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). The arid, inaccessible, poor Ouarsenis Mountains about 150 miles west of Algiers had previously experienced little or no violence. In the 1997 elections, the inhabitants had mainly voted for the pro-government FLN and RND. On the first day of Ramadan, at about 6:15 pm, assailants, armed with axes and knives, swept down on four farming villages in the Ammi Moussa area, and killed hundreds of people as they sat down to break their fast: * at Kherarba or Ouled Kherarba or Khrouba or Khourba, 21 (official) or 176 (Libert√©) were killed; * at Sahnoun or Ouled Sahnoun or Ouled Sahnine or Ouled Sahrine or Ouled Sahnine, 29 or 113 were killed; * at El-Abadel or Al Abadel, 73 (Libert√©) were killed; * at Ouled-Tayeb or Oulad Taieb or Ben Ta√Øyeb or Douar Ouled Tayeb, 28 or 50 were killed. The attackers killed families indiscriminately in their homes, men, women, children, and babies, beheading some and butchering others. They threw babies over walls, and reportedly even butchered dogs and livestock. They left only at dawn. The assailants were dressed as ‚ÄúAfghans.‚Äù Survivors were quoted in the Algerian press as identifying the leader of the assailants as Aoued Abdallah, called \\"Cheikh Noureddine\\", a head in western Algeria of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA). It was also reported that pamphlets distributed in Algiers previously had announced \\"\\"We will arrive here soon. We have breakfasted in Algiers, we will dine in Oran. Signed - GIA\\". The massacres were followed shortly afterwards by the Wilaya of Relizane massacres of 4 January 1998; together, these events provoked a widespread exodus from the region. The Algerian government told the UN Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2000/3/Add.1) that \\"On 31 December 1997, a judicial inquiry was opened and on 8 February 1998 the examining magistrate ordered that further investigations be carried out.

The station was originally named Laguna Honda; lettering with that former name is carved on the station headhouse.

There are also a few decorative features suggestive of an Art Nouveau aesthetic, for example malachite colored accents placed over the elevator doors. The station consists of two side platforms next to the tracks far below the surface. Forest Hill Station is located deeper underground than any other Muni Metro station; so much so that, unlike other stations, most people use an elevator to reach the platform at Forest Hill. Unlike all other underground Muni Metro stations, which feature an underground concourse mezzanine on the first level down, and the platform on the second level down, Forest Hill's concourse level is in a station building on the surface. Forest Hill and Eureka Valley stations were originally constructed with low platforms, as streetcars of that era had steps to load passengers from street level. However, the six new Market Street Subway stations, as well as West Portal station, were built with high-level platforms for speedier level boarding onto the new Boeing LRVs. With Eureka Valley permanently closed, Forest Hill was left as the only low-platform station on the Muni Metro subway. Muni later modified the station with high-level platforms, elevators for handicapped access, and ventilation improvements. The $6 million project, which upgraded Forest Hill to equal the new stations while keeping its historic architecture, was completed in 1985.

According to the Constitution of Ireland, the names of the Irish state are 'Ireland' (in English) and '√âire' (in Irish). From 1922 to 1937, its legal name was 'the Irish Free State'. The state has jurisdiction over almost five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The rest of the island is Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom. Consequently, other formal and informal names have been (and are) used when it is necessary to distinguish between the territory of the state and the island as a whole. In 1948 it adopted the term Republic of Ireland as the 'official description of the state', without changing the constitutional names. The terms Republic of Ireland (ROI), the Republic, the 26 counties or the South are the alternative names most often encountered. The term \\"Southern Ireland\\", although only having legal basis from 1920 to 1922, is still seen occasionally. Until the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, British government and media declined to use the name 'Ireland', preferring 'Eire' (without accent) until 1949 and 'Republic of Ireland' thereafter. Constitutional name Article 4 of the Constitution of Ireland, adopted in 1937, provides that \\"[t]he name of the State is √âire, or, in the English language, Ireland\\".The wording of Article 4 has been criticised. Early criticisms are discussed elsewhere in this article More recently, in its report, the Constitution Review Group () in 1996 stated that Article 4 was unnecessarily complicated and should be amended to read \\"The name of the State is Ireland\\" with an equivalent change in the Irish text. Hence, the Irish state has two official names, √âire (in Irish) and Ireland (in English). For official purposes, the Irish government uses the name √âire in documents written in Irish, while using Ireland where the language of the documents is English, including in international treaties and other legal documents. The name of the state is reflected in its institutions and public offices. For example, there is a President of Ireland and a Constitution of Ireland. The name Ireland is also used in the state's diplomatic relations with foreign nations and at meetings of the United Nations,United Nations Member States, http://www.un.org/en/members/ European Union,European Union Member States, http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member- countries/index_en.htm Council of Europe,Council of Europe Member States, http://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/country-profiles International Monetary Fund,IMF Countries, http://www.imf.org/external/country/index.htm#I and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.OECD Countries, http://www.oecd.org/#countriesList The Constitution gives the Irish language formal precedence over English, and a reflection of this is that √âire is the only name of the Irish state to feature on a range of national symbols including the Seal of the President, postage stamps and Irish euro coins. In 1981 the Department of Posts and Telegraphs recommended the inclusion of the word \\"Ireland\\" along with \\"√âire\\" on stamps but the Department of the Taoiseach vetoed the idea on the basis it could cause \\"constitutional and political repercussions\\" and that \\"the change could be unwelcome\\", as the name \\"Ireland\\" was considered by Unionists in Northern Ireland to refer to all 32 counties of Ireland. The spelling \\"Eire\\", with an E rather than an √â, is not correct Irish orthography despite being preferred for many years by British government and media. Legal description An envelope from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, stating \\"No Postage Stamp necessary if posted in Republic of Ireland\\". Since 1949 the Republic of Ireland Act has provided that the Republic of Ireland (or Poblacht na h√âireann in Irish) is the legal description for the state.The Republic of Ireland Act, 1948 (Commencement) Order, 1949 (S.I. No. 27/1949) appointed 18 April 1949 (Easter Monday, the thirty third anniversary of the Irish Easter Rising) as the day the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 would come into force. However, Ireland remains the constitutional name of the state. The constitutional name Ireland is normally used. However, the legal description Republic of Ireland is sometimes used when disambiguation is desired between the state and the island of Ireland. In colloquial use this is often shortened to 'the Republic'. This distinction between description and name was and remains important because the Act was not a constitutional amendment and did not change the name of the state. If it had purported to do so, it would have been unconstitutional. The distinction between a description and a name has sometimes caused confusion. The Taoiseach, John A. Costello introduced the legislation with an explanation of the difference in the following way:Seanad √âireann ‚Äì Volume 36‚Äì15 December 1948, The Republic of Ireland Bill, 1948‚ÄîCommittee and Final Stages. Many republics reference that in their names, including the \\"French Republic\\" and the \\"Italian Republic\\" but others, such as Hungary and Ukraine do not. European Union The state joined the European Economic Community (now the European Union) in 1973. Its accession treaty was drawn up in all of the EU's then-official treaty languages (including English and Irish) and, as such, the Irish state joined under both of its names, √âire and Ireland. On 1 January 2007, Irish became an official working language of the EU.See: Council Regulation (EC) No 920/2005. Until then, Irish was a treaty language, official to the extent that the EU's founding treaties were (in addition to the other languages of the EU) drawn up in Irish and equally authentic in that language. Irish had not been an official EU working language. This did not change the name of the Irish state in EU law. However, it has meant for example that at official meetings of the EU Council of Ministers, nameplates for the Irish state now read as √âire ‚Äì Ireland, whereas previously they would simply have read as Ireland. The Inter Institutional Style Guide of The Office for Official Publications of the European Communities sets out how the names of the Member states of the European Union must always be written and abbreviated in EU publications. Concerning Ireland, it states that its official names are √âire and Ireland; its official name in English is Ireland; its country code is IE; and its former abbreviation was IRL. It also adds the following guidance: \\"NB: Do not use 'Republic of Ireland' nor 'Irish Republic'.\\"Clause 7.1.1 of the Inter Institutional Style Guide . Historical names=Ancient The Annals of the Four Masters describe how Ireland was referred to in ancient times * During the time of the Partholonians, Nemedians, Fomorians, and Firbolg, the island was given a number of names: ** Inis Ealga signifying the noble or excellent island. The Latin translation was Insula Nobilis ** Fiodh- Inis signifying the Woody island. In Latin this was Insula nemorosa ** Crioch Fuinidh signifying the Final or remote country. In Latin as Terra finalia. * Inisf√°il meaning the Island of Destiny, and Inisfalia or Insula Fatalis in Latin. This was the name used by the Tuatha D√© Danann and from this 'F√°l' became an ancient name for Ireland. In this respect, therefore, Lia F√°il, the Stone of Destiny, came to mean 'Stone of Ireland'. Inisfail appears as a synonym for Erin in some Irish romantic and nationalist poetry in English in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; Aubrey Thomas de Vere's 1863 poem Inisfail is an example. * √âriu (from which derived √âire), Banba and F√≥dla were names given by the Dananns from three of their queens. * Ierne refers to Ireland by various ancient Greek writers and many scholars have the opinion that in the poem when the Argonauts passes Neson Iernida, that is, the Island Iernis, they are referring to the island of Ireland, thus referring to Ireland longer ago than 1000 BC. * Insula Sacra or the \\"Sacred Isle\\" was how several Roman writers referred to the island on account of its being a celebrated seat of Druidism. * Ogygia meaning the most ancient land is a name used by Plutarch in the first century which may refer to Ireland. * Hibernia is first used to refer to Ireland by Julius Caesar in his account of Britain, and became a common term used by the Romans. They also used a number of other terms, namely Juverna, Juvernia, Ouvernia, Ibernia, Ierna, Vernia. Ptolemy also refers to it as Iouernia or Ivernia. * Scotia or the land of the Scots is a term used by various Roman and other Latin writers, who referred to Irish raiders as Scoti. Some of the earliest mentions are in the 5th century, St. Patrick calls the Irish \\"Scoti\\", and in the 6th century, St. Isidore bishop of Seville and Gildas the British historian both refer to Ireland as Scotia. It was a term that exclusively referred to Ireland up until the eleventh century when modern Scotland was first referred to as Scotia. But even up until the sixteenth century, many Latin writers continued to refer to Ireland as Scotia. From the twelfth to the sixteenth century, various scholars used to distinguish between Ireland and Scotland by using Scotia Vetus or Scotia Major meaning Old Scotia or the Greater Scotia for Ireland, and Scotia Minor or Lesser Scotia for Scotland. * Insula Sanctorum or the Island of the Saints and Insula Doctorum or the Island of the Learned are names used by various Latin writers; hence the modern-day quasi-poetic description of the island as the \\"Island of Saints and Scholars\\". Pre-1919 Following the Norman invasion, Ireland was known as Dominus Hiberniae, the Lordship of Ireland from 1171 to 1541, and the Kingdom of Ireland from 1541 to 1800. From 1801 to 1922 it was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Irish Republic (1919‚Äì22) Easter Proclamation of 1916 declared the establishment of the Irish Republic. The rebel state retained this name until 1922. In English, the revolutionary state proclaimed in 1916 and ratified in 1919Parliament in Ireland, the First D√°ilOireachtas.ie was known as the Irish Republic or, occasionally, the Republic of Ireland. Two different Irish language names were used: Poblacht na h√âireann and Saorst√°t √âireann, based on two competing Irish translations of the word republic: Poblacht and Saorst√°t. Poblacht was a direct translation coming from the Irish pobal, cognate with the Latin populus. Saorst√°t, on the other hand, was a compound of the words: saor (meaning \\"free\\") and st√°t (\\"state\\"). The term Poblacht na h√âireann is the one used in the Easter Proclamation of 1916. However the Declaration of Independence and other documents adopted in 1919 eschew this title in favour of Saorst√°t √âireann. A slight variant of this title, Saorst√°t na h√âireann, was also sometimes used in later days as was the Latin Respublica Hibernica.The Republic: The Fight For Irish Independence by Charles TownshendPolitics in the Republic of Ireland by John Coakley & Michael Gallagher (For an explanation continuing usage of the term Irish Republic in the United Kingdom, see Name dispute with the UK (below). Some republicans also continue to use the term because they refuse to recognise the Anglo-Irish Treaty ‚Äì see below). Southern Ireland (1921‚Äì22) Southern Ireland () was the official name given to an autonomous Home Rule region (or constituent country) of the United Kingdom. It was established under the Government of Ireland Act 1920 on 3 May 1921.3 May 1921 (SR&O; 1921, No. 533). It covered the same territory as the present day Irish state.See: Government of Ireland Act 1920 However, political turmoil and the ongoing War of Independence meant that it never fully functioned as envisaged. Southern Ireland was superseded in law on 6 December 1922 by the establishment of the Irish Free State.Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922. The term Southern Ireland does not have any official status today.John Furlong (2006). Ireland ‚Äì the Name of the State. Legal Information Management, 6, pp 297‚Äì301. Cambridge University Press. However, it is sometimes used colloquially particularly in the United Kingdom. Irish Free State (1922‚Äì37) During the negotiations on secession leading to the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Irish politicians wanted the state to be a republic, and its name to be the Republic of Ireland or the Irish Republic. However the British government refused to contemplate a republic because this would have entailed the Irish state severing the link with the British crown and ceasing to be a part of the British Empire. Instead, the parties agreed the state would be a self- governing Dominion within the British Commonwealth of Nations. The self- proclaimed Irish Republic had used Saorst√°t √âireann as its Irish name, and \\"Irish Free State\\" was derived by literal translation of Saorst√°t √âireann back into English. Article One of the treaty stated:Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorst√°t √âireann) Act, 1922 The May 1922 draft of the Constitution of the Irish Free State used only Irish forms of many names and titles, but on British insistence these were replaced with English equivalents; one exception was that references to \\"Saorst√°t √âireann\\" were amended to \\"the Irish Free State (Saorst√°t √âireann)\\". After the establishment of the Free State the Irish government often used the name Saorst√°t √âireann in documents in English as well as Irish; an exception was that postage stamps of the period used √âire. Because the Irish Free State was not a republic, since 1922 the word saorst√°t has fallen out of use in Irish as a translation of republic. When the legal description of the state was declared to be the Republic of Ireland in 1949, its official Irish description became not Saorst√°t √âireann but Poblacht na h√âireann. It appears that the \\"Irish Free State\\" name was not generally popular, The Times reporting on the Irish general election in 1932:The Times, 8 February 1932 √âire (Irish language name since 1937) As mentioned above, Article 4 of the Constitution of Ireland, gives the state its two official names, √âire in Irish and Ireland in English. Each name is a direct translation of the other. From 1937, the name √âire was often used even in the English language. In May 1937, when the President of the Executive Council, √âamon de Valera presented the first draft of the Constitution to the parliamentary committee on the Constitution, Article 4 simply provided: \\"The name of the State is √âire\\". There was no reference to Ireland at all. Opposition politicians immediately proposed that the word Ireland be substituted for the word √âire throughout the English text. They argued that Ireland was the name known by every European country; that the name should not be surrendered; that the name Ireland might instead be adopted by Northern Ireland; and that the choice of √âire might damage the status of the state internationally by drawing a \\"distinction between the state...and what has been known for centuries as Ireland\\".D√°il √âireann ‚Äì Volume 67 ‚Äì 25 May 1937, Bunreacht na h√âireann (Dr√©acht)‚ÄîCoiste Responding, de Valera stressed that the Irish text of the constitution was to be the foundation text. In light of this, he said the name √âire was more logical and that it would mean an Irish name would become accepted even in the English language.D√°il √âireann ‚Äì Volume 67 ‚Äì 25 May 1937, Bunreacht na h√âireann (Dr√©acht)‚ÄîCoiste : 'The President: ... I should prefer to keep the name as \\"Eire\\" because the whole thing is more logical but, if anybody wants to translate that in the English text as \\"Ireland,\\" I have no objection. I am anxious, however, that the Irish term should be used on the same basis as we use \\"Taoiseach.\\" Elsewhere, it is suggested that that should be \\"Prime Minister.\\" The term \\"Ceann Comhairle\\" has now come to be used instead of \\"Speaker.\\" It has come gradually into our speech and the acceptance of Irish words for our own institutions is desirable. This is one of those matters in which I should have imagined I would come in for considerable criticism from the opposite benches if I put in the word \\"Ireland\\" instead of \\"Eire.\\" ... There are two things that can be said in favour of using the word Eire. The first is that it keeps the logic of the whole system much more clear and definite. The second is that we are doing something beyond what we have done before, that is, getting Irish names accepted even in English when we speak English here.'On a later occasion de Valera was also to say that the name √âire would have helped to avoid confusion between the names of the island and the state. Although, clearly, where the Irish language was the medium of communication, the position would be the same (as √âire is both the name of the state and the island in the Irish language). He considered that issue in the D√°il (D√°il √âireann ‚Äì Volume 67 ‚Äì 25 May 1937, Bunreacht na h√âireann (Dr√©acht)‚ÄîCoiste ): 'The President: There is, for instance, the territorial area which is called Eire in Irish, and there is the State. It is easy to distinguish between the two territories if you say St√°t na hEireann or Oile√°n na hEireann.' (Note: \\"St√°t na h√âireann\\" is Irish for \\"State of Ireland\\" and \\"Oile√°n na h√âireann\\" is Irish for \\"Island of Ireland\\".) However, he said he had \\"no strong views\\" and he agreed \\"that in the English translation the name of the state [would be] Ireland\\". When de Valera subsequently tabled an amendment to give effect to this concession, he proposed Article 4's current wording: \\"The name of the State is √âire, or, in the English language, Ireland.\\" In doing so, he remarked that as \\"the Irish text is the fundamental text [it is as well] that √âire is used here and there.\\" With almost no debate, the wording was agreed to and subsequently became the law of the land.D√°il √âireann ‚Äì Volume 68 ‚Äì 9 June 1937 Committee on Finance. ‚Äì Recommittal. To the proposed wording, an opposition politician had responded that it was \\"rather a cumbersome name for the State\\". To this, de Valera replied, that \\"it was a very short name. There is the equivalent in the English language.\\" There was no further debate. The name Ireland was substituted for √âire in a number of places throughout the English text of the Constitution although the name √âire remained in the highly rhetorical preamble but nowhere else in the English text. The latter reference was probably also motivated by de Valera's wish to emphasise the pre-eminence of the Irish text, as well as by his previously stated view that such use of Irish words in English was \\"desirable\\" (\\"D√°il √âireann ‚Äì Volume 67 ‚Äì 25 May 1937, Bunreacht na h√âireann (Dr√©acht)‚ÄîCoiste ). It is sometimes said that de Valera wished to reserve the names Republic of Ireland or Irish Republic for the day when a united Ireland might be achieved. These names were not discussed in the parliamentary debates on the Constitution. However, the reason which de Valera gave in the debates for omitting any reference to the word republic throughout the constitution was that he thought the constitution would gain broader support if it did not refer to a republic.Seanad √âireann ‚Äì Volume 36‚Äì15 December 1948, The Republic of Ireland Bill, 1948‚ÄîCommittee and Final Stages . It is highly likely that practical considerations such as the possible ramifications of automatic exclusion from the British Commonwealth were also among his considerations. After the adoption of the Constitution, de Valera's government generally encouraged use of the name √âire (rather than Ireland) but not always. His government also appreciated the significance of the name Ireland. So for example, when the Irish ambassador in Berlin, Charles Bewley sought instructions concerning the new name of the State, he was advised by Joseph P. Walshe, for decades the top civil servant in the Irish Department of External Affairs that:Catriona Crowe; Ronan Fanning; Dermot Keogh; Eunan O'Halpin; and Michael Kennedy: Documents on Irish Foreign Policy: 1937‚Äì1939 Vol. 5 Ireland uses √âire as the country name on its current postage stamps. Thus, while sometimes encouraging the use of the name √âire even in English, de Valera's government insisted at other times on the use of the name Ireland. The United Kingdom disputed Irish adoption of the name \\"Ireland\\" (below). De Valera's decision to generally use the name √âire was sometimes severely criticised as a poor choice of name. Some argued that it was confusing.D√°il √âireann ‚Äì Volume 96 ‚Äì 11 April 1945 ‚Äì Ceisteanna‚ÄîQuestions Mr Cogan TD to the Taoiseach Others said the name √âire might strengthen the claim of the government of Northern Ireland to the ancient name of Ulster for their state.Seanad √âireann Debates- Volume 25 ‚Äì 14 May 1941. Senator Michael Hayes: Indeed shortly before the Second World War, the Northern Ireland government attempted to adopt the name Ulster but were rebutted by London. However, the name √âire (generally appearing as Eire in English) quickly became widely accepted in English. Nevertheless, this only fuelled more criticism of the name, as once free in the English language, it evolved ‚Äì leading to what opposition politicians stated were \\"sneering titles such as Eirish\\".D√°il √âireann ‚Äì Volume 96 ‚Äì 11 April 1945 -Ceisteanna‚ÄîQuestions These criticisms were aired at length in the Oireachtas when the Republic of Ireland Act was being debated. De Valera's use of the name √âire as well as the wording of Article 4 were sharply criticised. The Taoiseach of the day, John A. Costello said \\"that tremendous confusion ha[d] been caused by the use of that word √âire in Article 4. By a misuse by malicious people of that word, √âire, they have identified it with the Twenty-Six Counties and not with the State that was set up under this Constitution of 1937.\\"D√°il √âireann ‚Äì Volume 113 ‚Äì 24 November 1948 The Republic of Ireland Bill, 1948‚ÄîSecond Stage. Costello also added that in \\"documents of a legal character, such as, for instance, policies of insurance, there is always difficulty in putting in what word one wants to describe the State referred to. [The new description of the State, the Republic of Ireland will provide] a solution for these difficulties, and those malicious newspapers who want to refer in derogatory tones to this country as √âire and who have coined these contemptuous adjectives about it, such as \\"Eireannish\\" and \\"Eirish\\", and all the rest of it.\\" In a similar vein Costello also remarked that those \\"who may be disposed to jeer at our State, as they have done before in connection with the word \\"√âire\\", will look at this [Republic of Ireland Act] and see that in the English text‚Äîwhich is the only one they can understand‚Äî... the description of the State is \\"the Republic of Ireland\\"...I want to stop any further nonsense.\\" Costello also criticised de Valera for using the term the \\"√âire Republic..., a term of decision and scorn\\". Despite these criticisms, de Valera initially called for the proposed Irish description of the state, Poblacht na h-√âireann to also be inserted into the English text of the Act in the same way both the Irish and English names of the state are used in Article 4.D√°il √âireann ‚Äì Volume 113 ‚Äì 26 November 1948 The Republic of Ireland Bill (Resumed). However, de Valera subsequently retreated from this position and in what may be seen as an implicit acceptance of the criticisms made of the wording of Article 4 itself, de Valera accepted that it was better not to also use the Irish description in the English text.In the same D√°il debate, de Valera explained that a reason to use the Irish language description in the English text \\"would be if one wanted to bring in the use of the name Poblacht na h√âireann into ordinary speech, as the words \\"Taoiseach\\", \\"Oireachtas\\", \\"D√°il √âireann\\" have been brought into ordinary speech. Although I would like to see as many Irish words as possible come into the institutions of our State, I came to the conclusion that the Taoiseach is taking a better view. I think it is better for us in this case not to bring the Irish word into the English text; it is better to keep the English appellation, the English description, in the English text for some of the reasons the Taoiseach has mentioned.\\" Despite not changing the name, when the Republic of Ireland Act was passed, the name √âire quickly fell into disuse (except in the Irish language). However the name continues to linger on, particularly in the United Kingdom. The Constitution review group's 1967 report discusses Article 4: Historically, \\"Eire\\" was commonly used as a state- name by a variety of organisations. For example, in 1938, the \\"Irish Amateur Athletic Union\\" (IAAU) changed its name to \\"Amateur Athletic Union of Eire\\" (AAUE) and affiliated to the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) under the country name \\"Eire\\". In 1967, the AAUE merged with most of the rival NACA to form Bord L√∫thchleas na h√âireann (BL√â). BL√â requested the IAAF to change the country's name to \\"Ireland\\". This finally happened in 1981. Abbreviations Under the International Organization for Standardization's ISO 3166 standard, the two-letter code for Ireland is \\"IE\\" while the three- letter code is \\"IRL\\". The \\"IE\\" code is the basis for the choice of \\".ie\\" for Irish internet addresses.Section 31 of the Electronic Commerce Act, 2000 The IRL code features on Irish driving licences, passports and is most visible on contemporary Irish EU style vehicle registration plates.Regulation 11 of the Vehicle Registration and Taxation (Amendment) Regulations, 1999 (S.I. 432 of 1999). Under the Convention on International Civil Aviation Irish registered aircraft carry the nationality mark \\"EI\\",Regulation 11 of the Irish Aviation Authority (Nationality and Registration of Aircraft) Order, 2005 (S.I. 634 of 2005) although this abbreviation has nothing to do with the state's name. For example, the ICAO also gives \\"EG\\" and \\"EH\\" as the abbreviations for Belgium and the Netherlands. Alternative names A variety of alternative names are also used for the Irish state. Sometimes alternative names are chosen because the name \\"Ireland\\" could be confused with the name of the island the state shares with Northern Ireland. Other times alternative names are chosen for political reasons. \\"Republic of Ireland\\", the \\"description\\" of the state according to the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, is often used. In sport, the national football team plays as the \\"Republic of Ireland\\". This is because the Irish national football team was organised by the Irish Football Association, from 1882 to 1950. A new organisation, the Football Association of the Irish Free State was formed after partition to organize a new team to represent the newly formed Irish Free State. Over time the Irish Football Association came to be the body for organising association football in Northern Ireland only. However, both association football federations continued to field a team called \\"Ireland\\". Despite protests from both organisations, in 1953 FIFA decreed that neither team could be referred to as Ireland in competitions which both teams were eligible to enter. The two teams now play under the names \\"Republic of Ireland\\" and \\"Northern Ireland\\". \\"Irish Republic\\" is commonly used as a name for the state in Britain but disliked in the Republic, where \\"Irish Republic\\" refers to the revolutionary state of the First D√°il in 1919. The initialism \\"ROI\\", for \\"Republic of Ireland\\", is also often used outside official circles. Shorter colloquial names include \\"the Republic\\" or \\"the South\\". Irish republicans, and other opponents of Partition, often refer to the state as the \\"Twenty-Six Counties\\" or \\"26 Counties\\" (with Northern Ireland as the \\"Six Counties\\" or \\"6 Counties\\") and sometimes as the \\"Free State\\" (a reference to the pre-1937 state). Speaking in the D√°il on 13 April 2000, Sinn F√©in's Caoimhgh√≠n √ì Caol√°in explained it as follows: \\"Southern Irish Commonwealth\\" and \\"Southern Irish Republic\\" were names suggested by the British publication, The Spectator, in 1921.The Spectator, Volume 127, F.C. Westley, 1922, pages 224-225 These suggestions never became widely used but are noteworthy for showing how fluid names for the territory were at the time. Distinguishing the state from the island Where \\"Ireland\\" would be ambiguous, the current convention in Irish government usage is \\"island of Ireland\\" for the island and \\"the state\\" for the state. In the decades prior to the change to Articles 2 and 3, the forms \\"Ireland (32 counties)\\" and \\"Ireland (26 counties)\\" had some official use. Goods originating in Northern Ireland can be sold in the Republic as \\"Irish\\" or \\"made in Ireland\\", which some consumers find confusing or misleading. The private National Dairy Council introduced a \\"Farmed in the Republic of Ireland\\" logo in 2009, whereas Bord Bia, the statutory food labelling authority, has distinct \\"Ireland\\", \\"Northern Ireland\\", and \\"Ireland & Northern Ireland\\" logos; the \\"Ireland\\" logos incorporate an Irish tricolour as well as text.There is a separate debate about whether the flag relates only to the 26-county state or also to the entire island. The private Guaranteed Irish logo is mostly used by firms in the Republic, but there is one in Northern Ireland. Name dispute with the UK This section concerns a protracted dispute which existed between the Irish and British governments over the official names of their respective states: Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Following the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 the dispute ended and each government now accepts the official name of the other state. \\"Eire\\" and \\"√âire\\" v Ireland In 1937 the Irish Free State Government arranged for a plebiscite to approve a new Irish Constitution. Articles 2 and 3 of the new Constitution expressed a territorial claim to the \\"whole island of Ireland\\" and thus an irredentist claim to the territory of Northern Ireland. In addition, Article 4 provided that \\"the name of the state is √âire, or, in the English language, Ireland\\". This too was seen by the British Government as another anti-partitionist attempt to lay claim to the whole of the island.Undoubtedly, the Irish government's desire to unite the territory of the island influenced its choice of the name Ireland for the state. A letter as early as 12 March 1932 from Joe Walshe to President de Valera is indicative of this. In it Walshe states: \\"I believe that you can achieve the Unity of this country within seven years and that we can have our complete independence without calling this country by any particular const[itutional] name. \\"Ireland\\" shall be our name, and our international position will let the world know that we are independent\\" in Ferriter, Diarmaid, Judging Dev, Royal Irish Academy 2007 In the run up to the adoption of the new Irish Constitution which took effect on 29 December 1937, the British Cabinet considered how to respond as regards the new name. A report to Cabinet by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs reported thatI.S.C. (32) 129;CABINET. Irish Situation Committee. RELATIONS WITH THE IRISH FREE STATE. GENERAL CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs \\"[De Valera] feels strongly that the title Irish Free State was one of the things imposed on the Irish by the British in 1921\\". The same report recommended that the UK Government use \\"always the Irish term 'Eire' when referring to the State, and ourselves avoiding the use of the term 'Ireland,' except to describe the whole island as a geographical entity\\". It so happened that the Constitution would come into force when the Westminster Parliament was adjourned over the Christmas. Accordingly, the preferred course of the Prime Minister making a statement on the matter in Parliament was ruled out. Ultimately, in response to the new constitution and in consultation with all the Governments of the British Commonwealth except the Irish Government, the British government published a communiqu√© on 30 December 1937, the day after the Constitution took effect. In the communiqu√©, the British government recognised that the new constitution gave the Irish state two names Ireland or √âire. It also implicitly recognised that the two names had an identical meaning, by declaring:The Manchester Guardian, 30 December 1937 Britain accepts new name for the Free State. Full text of British Government's communiqu√© cited in Clifford, Angela, The Constitutional History of Eire/Ireland, Athol Books, Belfast, 1985, p153. The British government finessed Article 4 and ignored Articles 2 and 3: if the Irish constitution said the name of the state in the national language was √âire, then that (written as \\"Eire\\") was what the British government would call it.Note: Under the Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938 the name Eire, without the correct s√≠ne fada (accent) over the first E, was used. This practice of omitting the s√≠ne fada over the E was consistently adopted by the UK government and some Commonwealth countries. By doing so, it avoided any need to call the Irish state, in the English language, Ireland.Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan, State of the Union: Unionism and the Alternatives in the United Kingdom, 2001: 173, 181. The change of name effected by the 1937 constitution (but not the other constitutional changes), was given effect in United Kingdom law in the Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938. Under Section 1 of that Act, it was declared that (for the purposes of United Kingdom legislation) the territory \\"which was ... known as Irish Free State shall be styled as ... Eire\\".Oliver, JDB, What's in a Name, in Tiley, John, Studies in the History of Tax Law, The Chartered Institute of Taxation, 2003. The British approach of calling the state Eire was greatly assisted by the general preference of √âamon de Valera, the leader of the Irish government at the time, that the state be known as √âire, even in English. This is seen in the English-language preamble of the Constitution. However, the Irish government, even when led by de Valera, also appreciated the significance of the name Ireland and insisted on that name in some fora. For example, in 1938 Irish representatives in the Commonwealth countries gave their official titles as High Commissioner for Ireland and the League of Nations was informed that Ireland was the correct English name for the country.On Thursday 2 December 1937, the Irish Free State Government sent a Note to the League of Nations stating that the Free State would be officially known as Ireland on and after 29 December 1937, when the new constitution became law reported The Argus ‚Äì Australia ‚Äì \\"NAME OF FREE STATE TO BE CHANGED TO IRELAND\\" on 3 December 1937 A unique modus vivendi was adopted by the two States when they concluded a bilateral agreement on air services in 1946. That agreement was styled as an \\"Agreement between the United Kingdom and Ireland (Eire)\\". A parliamentary question as to why the term \\"Ireland (Eire)\\" was used rather than simply \\"Eire\\" was put in the British House of Commons. A parliamentary secretary for the Government, Ivor Thomas, explained the position as follows: The practice in other Commonwealth countries varied: At the outset at least, it appears South Africa and Canada used the name Ireland while New Zealand favoured Eire.A consideration given by the Canadians was \\"that any Canadian Government communication would normally be in English rather than in Gaelic, and that the use of the Gaelic word \\"Eire\\" in such a communication might therefore be inappropriate (just as it would scarcely be considered appropriate, in a communication written in English which mentioned the Government of Egypt, to speak of it as the Government of Misr, unless the Egyptian Government specially requested that the Egyptian form of the country's name should be used)\\": Circular dated 1 April 1949 from the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs to Heads of Post Abroad (Circular Document No.B38, 836. DEA/7545‚ÄëB‚Äë40) In 1947, the United Kingdom Home Office went further by issuing instructions to United Kingdom government departments to use Eire. Nevertheless, over time the name √âire fell increasingly out of use by both the Irish government (except in the Irish language) and internationally, in particular after the passing of the Republic of Ireland Act. Republic of Ireland v Ireland On 18 April 1949, the Republic of Ireland Act, 1948 (No. 22 of 1948), came into operation, removing the last functions of the king. Section two of the Act states, \\"It is hereby declared that the description of the State shall be the Republic of Ireland.\\" The following note of what Prime Minister Clement Attlee said at a British Cabinet meeting on 12 January 1949 illustrates some of the considerations the British government had to consider following this declaration:C.M. 1(49) ‚Äì Meeting held on 12 January 1949. C.M. 1(49). Ultimately, the British responded by passing the Ireland Act 1949 which provided that: It was the culmination of careful consideration by the Prime Minister Attlee. He put it that \\"a refusal to use the title 'Republic of Ireland' in any circumstances would involve [the UK] in continuing friction with the Eire Government: it would perpetuate the \\"inconveniences and indignities\\" which we now experience as a result of our present policy of insisting on the title 'Eire' as against Dublin's preference for 'Ireland.'\\"Memorandum by the Prime Minister, C.P. (49) 47, 4 March 1949; Catalogue Reference:CAB/129/33 Hence, the Ireland Act formally provided the name Republic of Ireland for use instead of the name Eire in British law. Later the name Eire was abolished entirely in British law under the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1981.Austen Morgan, The Belfast Agreement, 2000, p99. This has meant that the Republic of Ireland is the only name for the Irish state officially provided for in domestic UK law. Notwithstanding the Ireland Act, the British government would often continue to refer to the Irish state by other names such as the Irish Republic or Southern Ireland.Immigration and Nationality Directorate, UK Government Website, EEA Nationals . A good example of this was in the Treaty of London, 1949.Another example is some domestic UK legislation including \\"The Irish Republic (Termination of 1927 Agreement) Order 1987.\\" The UK government had been centrally involved in preparing the treaty which was signed in London and established the Council of Europe. The treaty consistently describes the Irish state as the Irish Republic. Opposition leader, √âamon de Valera, queried this. The Minister for External Affairs, Sean MacBride, responded that he agreed \\"that the description is not possibly as accurate as we would have liked it to be\\".Council of Europe‚ÄîMotion Resumed.Wednesday, 13 July 1949. Yet he also said that the term Irish Republic was used in the treaty \\"in a general sense in the way the country is described; French Republic, Irish Republic, Italian Republic, Kingdom of the Netherlands and so on.\\"Committee on Finance. ‚Äì Vote 3‚ÄîDepartment of the Taoiseach (Resumed). Thursday, 21 July 1949. However, leading opposition politician, Frank Aiken, was not satisfied with this response. Speaking in the D√°il, Aiken cited article 26 of the treaty where \\"the names of the countries are given as \\"Belgium\\", \\"Denmark\\" and \\"France\\", not \\"Republic of France\\" or \\"French Republic\\"\\" noting that \\"one would expect that the next thing one would find would be \\"Ireland\\", but instead we have \\"Belgium, Denmark, France, Irish Republic, Italy, Luxembourg\\" and so on. Aiken remarked that some British MPs wanted \\"to popularise the name Irish Republic\\". He asked the Taoiseach, John Costello to clear up \\"what exactly is the name of this State going to be in international documents, international agreements and matters of that kind.\\" Aiken expressed the view that \\"We want to keep up the name given in the Constitution, \\"Ireland\\", in order to show that our claim is to the whole island of Ireland and in international documents, in my opinion, the State should be alluded to as \\"Ireland\\" or the \\"Republic of Ireland\\".\\" The following month the Minister for External Affairs clarified at the Council of Europe that Ireland was how the state should be described. This was reported on in The Times on 8 August 1949 in the following terms:The Times, 8 August 1949 ‚Äì Statement by European Movement (made on 7 August 1949)John Davies, The Correct Name for Ireland . [See Text of Treaty of London, 1949 at Wikisource; the UK government was the depository for the Treaty.] Therefore, even with the UK's Ireland Act and its provision of Republic of Ireland as a UK \\"name\\" for the Irish state, a dispute over the names of their respective states was to continue between the UK and Irish governments. For the Irish, Republic of Ireland was still not the name of the state, merely its description. For a brief period from the coming into effect of the Republic of Ireland Act until the second half of 1950 the Irish Government was inconsistent in the way it described itself and the state: At times it described itself internationally as the Government of the Republic of Ireland;Irish Treaty Series for 1949 and 1950 At other times it continued to insist that the name of the Irish state was Ireland. From the second half of 1950, the Irish government reverted to consistently styling itself the Government of Ireland. The Irish state joined the United Nations in 1955 as Ireland over protests concerning its name by the United Kingdom. Similarly, the United Kingdom protested when the Irish state was admitted to the European Economic Community in 1973 as Ireland. Australia also for several years following the declaration of a republic refused to exchange ambassadors with Dublin on the basis of the name \\"Ireland\\" rather than \\"Republic of Ireland\\", on the basis that this would have involved recognition of a territorial claim to part of His/Her Majesty's dominions.Patrick O'Farrell, Irish-Australian diplomatic relations, Quadrant, XXXIV (1980), p. 12 A legacy of this dispute was the designation of the Irish legation in London as the \\"Irish Embassy\\", rather than the title \\"Embassy of Ireland\\" preferred by Dublin.Donal Lowry, The captive dominion: imperial realities behind Irish diplomacy, 1922‚Äì49, Irish Historical Studies, XXXVI, 142 (2008), pp. 220‚Äì21 A further Commonwealth anomaly was the title of the monarch in Canada. In 1950, following the declaration of a republic the Irish and Canadian High Commissioners were replaced by Ambassadors/Ministers Plenipotentiary, accredited on the basis of the sovereign's title in Canada still encompassing the whole of Ireland. Even in 1952, following the accession of Elizabeth II, and prior to the revised definition of the royal title in 1953, Canada's preferred format was: Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas.Rinfret, Thibaudeau (6 February 1952), Notice and Proclamations , in Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Documents on Canadian External Relations, 14-1, Ottawa: Queen's Printer for Canada. Retrieved 8 October 2009. For its part, the Irish government also disputed the right of the British state to call itself the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Irish government objected to the words \\"and Northern Ireland\\" in the name of the British state. The name also ran against the Irish state's territorial claim to Northern Ireland. The dispute over the names of their respective states was most apparent when the two states concluded bilateral treaties. For example, when the Anglo-Irish Agreement was made in 1985 between the two states, the British text of the agreement gave it the formal title \\"Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Ireland\\" whereas the Irish government's text of the very same agreement gave it the formal title \\"Agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom\\".; It is standard practice in the titles of international agreements between two contracting states for each state to put itself first in its own version (held by the other contracting state). The Government Information Bureau in 1953 issued a directive, noting that Article 4 of the 1937 Constitution gave the name as \\"√âire\\" or, in the English language, \\"Ireland\\"; they noted that whenever the name of the state was mentioned in an English language document, Ireland should be used and that \\"Care should be taken\\", the directive stated, \\"to avoid the use of the expression Republic of Ireland or Irish Republic in such a context or in such a manner as might suggest that it is a geographical term applicable to the area of the Twenty‚ÄêSix counties.\\" According to Mary Daly, this directive remained in use for a number of years. A copy was sent to Bord F√°ilte (the Irish tourist board) in 1959, reminding them not to use the title \\"the Republic of Ireland\\" on their promotional literature. In 1963, under the auspices of the Council of Europe, to revise geography textbooks, the Irish Department of Education issued guidelines to delegates on politically correct geographic terminology: \\"British Isles\\" and \\"United Kingdom\\" were deemed objectionable and that delegates insist on \\"Ireland\\" and \\"Great Britain.\\" The term \\"Republic of Ireland\\" should be avoided but that delegates were no longer to insist on \\"the Six Counties\\" in place of \\"Northern Ireland\\" in an attempt to improve relations with Northern Ireland. In February 1964, the Irish government indicated its wish to appoint an ambassador to Canberra. The one issue, however, that blocked the exchange of ambassadors had been the insistence of Australia that the letters carried by the Irish ambassador should have the royal title as \\"Elizabeth the Second, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Australia and Her Other Realms and Territories, Queen.\\" This was, according to Daly, despite the fact that the Australian Royal Style and Titles Act did not mention Northern Ireland, referring only to \\"the United Kingdom, Australia\\" etc. However, that November when Eoin MacWhite presented his credentials as Irish ambassador to Australia, a circular was issued to all Australian government departments indicating to them to use the word \\"Ireland\\" rather than \\"the Irish Republic\\". The UK was by the mid-1960s the only country not to refer to the state as Ireland. In 1985 the British command papers described the Anglo-Irish Agreement as an \\"Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Ireland\\", with the Irish official papers described it as an \\"Agreement Between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom\\". The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office referred to Ireland as the \\"Republic of Ireland\\" ‚Äì however since 2000 it has referred to the State as \\"Ireland.\\" The credentials presented by the British ambassador, Stewart Eldon, in 2003, were addressed to the President of Ireland. Republic of Ireland v Irish Republic When the Republic of Ireland Act was enacted, the United Kingdom cabinet debated whether it should use the new name in preference to \\"Eire\\". Having said that it was minded to do so and invited comment, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland (Sir Basil Brooke, Ulster Unionist) objected in the strongest possible terms, saying that the new description \\"was intended to repeat Eire's claim to jurisdiction over the whole island.\\" Attlee partly accepted this argument, saying that the [UK] bill should formally recognise the title 'Republic of Ireland' but that the description \\"The Irish Republic\\" would be employed in all official usage. Indeed, despite the Belfast Agreement, almost all British publications still follow this style (see below). In the Irish courts The name of the state‚Äîboth in English and in Irish‚Äîwas considered in one case in the Irish courts. In the 1989 Supreme Court case of Ellis v O'Dea, the court objected to the issuing of extradition warrants (in English) by the United Kingdom courts naming the state as √âire and not Ireland. Judge Brian Walsh said that while the courts of other countries were at liberty to issue such warrants in the Irish language, if they used the English language they had to refer to the state as Ireland. Walsh and Judge Niall McCarthy expressed the view that where extradition warrants did not use the correct name of the state it was the duty of the courts and of the Garda√≠ to return such warrants for rectification. Both judges also noted that the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 did not change the name of the state as prescribed in the Constitution.Casey, James, Constitutional Law in Ireland, , pp. 30‚Äì31 The following is an extract from Walsh's judgement: Good Friday Agreement The dispute between the UK and Irish governments over the names of their respective states now appears to have been resolved. The Ireland Act 1949 has not been formally repealed by the UK but has been in effect overridden. This resolution took place when the Good Friday Agreement (or Belfast Agreement) was concluded in 1998. That Agreement concerned a wide range of constitutional and other matters regarding Northern Ireland. Notably, as part of it, the Irish state dropped its legal claim to the territory of Northern Ireland. In the title of the Agreement, the two governments used their respective domestic law names, the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland. Some Unionist members of the British parliament objected strenuously to the use of the term the Government of Ireland. They proposed that the practice of referring to the Irish government as the Government of the Republic of Ireland should be continued. Their objections were not accepted. Responding for the British government in the House of Lords, Lord Dubs explained that the new practice of referring to the Irish state by the name Ireland:Hansard, House of Lords, 19 October 1998 This policy has been respected by both governments since the Belfast Agreement. A House of Lords debate, ten years later in May 2008, on Regulations governing political donations by Irish citizens and bodies to political parties in Northern Ireland, is a good example of this. During the debate Lord Rooker, a Government minister, said that the Regulations would: \\"acknowledge the special place that the island of Ireland and the Republic of Ireland occupy in the political life of Northern Ireland\\". Responding, Lord Glentoran suggested that Lord Rooker in fact \\"meant to say that [the draft Regulations recognise] the special place that Ireland occupies in the political life of Northern Ireland.\\" Agreeing with Lord Glentoran's observation, Lord Rooker responded: So far there has been no domestic British legislation explicitly providing that Ireland may be used as a name for the Irish state for the purposes of domestic British law. While the UK's Ireland Act provides for use of the name Republic of Ireland in domestic British law, that legislation is permissive rather than mandatory so it does not mean Ireland cannot be used instead. However, some legal commentators have speculated that it may be necessary for the British government to introduce legislation to also explicitly provide for use of the name Ireland for the Irish state because under domestic British law the name Ireland might be interpreted as referring to the whole island of Ireland. There is no requirement to amend domestic Irish legislation. Nevertheless, there are now a growing number of UK statutes and regulations that refer to the Irish state as simply Ireland and make no reference to the Republic of Ireland. One example is the Disqualifications Act 2000 which refers, inter alia, to the \\"legislature of Ireland\\", the \\"House of Representatives of Ireland\\" and the \\"Senate of Ireland\\". The Loans to Ireland Act 2010 refers to the state as simply \\"Ireland\\". The Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use uses simply Ireland for the country name.Country names: The Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British official use https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/country- namesCountry Names The Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use Similarly, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office do not use the term Republic of Ireland but rather apply the term Ireland when advising potential British Nationals choosing to live in Ireland.British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, GOV.UK, https://www.gov.uk/living-in-ireland In contrast, the Qualified Lawyers Transfer Regulations 1990 referred to barristers and solicitors qualified \\"in Ireland\\" and made no reference to the \\"Republic of Ireland\\"Qualified Lawyers Transfer Regulations 1990 (as amended) . but when these regulations were replaced by the Qualified Lawyers Transfer Regulations 2009, the Regulations were amended to refer to the Republic of Ireland and not Ireland. However, in her letter to President of the European Council Donald Tusk invoking Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union to give effect to Brexit, Prime Minister Theresa May used the term Republic of Ireland: British media usage The names attributed to the state by the British media are sometimes the subject of discussion in the state. The style guides of British news sources adopt differing policies for referring to the state (though notably all deprecate 'Eire' even though it was often used even in the late 20th century): ;The Times: \\"Ireland: the two parts should be called the Republic of Ireland or the Irish Republic (avoid Eire except in direct quotes or historical context), and Northern Ireland or Ulster.\\" ;The Guardian: \\"Ireland, Irish Republic. not Eire or \\"Southern Ireland\\"\\" ;The Daily Telegraph: \\"Ireland includes Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Irish Government means the one in Dublin. Use Irish Republic or the Republic according to context, but not Eire.\\" ;The Economist: \\"Ireland is simply Ireland. Although it is a republic, it is not the Republic of Ireland. Neither is it, in English, Eire.\\" ;BBC Radio: \\"Ireland is an island, comprising Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.\\" ;BBC News style guide: We should make clear within the first four pars that we are talking about the country rather than the island, so should use Republic of Ireland or the Irish Republic. Subsequent references can talk about Ireland, the Republic of Ireland or the Republic. Also, in headlines it is acceptable to use Ireland, but again the summary should emphasise that we are referring to the country. However, when writing stories that cover both parts (e.g.: The numbers of songbirds are declining throughout Ireland) we should try to make clear that we are talking about the island as a whole. Do not use either Eire or Southern Ireland.

Under the plural form S√¢nziene, the word designates an annual festival in the fairies' honor. Etymologically, the name comes from the Latin Sancta Diana, the Roman goddess of the hunt and moon, also celebrated in Roman Dacia (ancient Romania). Diana was known to be the virgin goddess and looked after virgins and women. She was one of the three maiden goddesses, Diana, Minerva and Vesta, who swore never to marry. People in the western Carpathian Mountains celebrate the S√¢nziene holiday annually, on June 24. This is similar to the Swedish Midsummer holiday, and is believed to be a pagan celebration of the summer solstice in June. According to the official position of the Romanian Orthodox Church, the customs actually relate to the celebration of Saint John the Baptist's Nativity, which also happens on June 24. S√¢nziene rituals The folk practices of S√¢nziene imply that the most beautiful maidens in the village dress in white and spend all day searching for and picking flowers, of which one MUST be Galium verum (Lady's bedstraw or Yellow bedstraw) which in Romanian is also named \\"S√¢nzi√†nƒÉ\\". Using the flowers they picked during the day, the girls braid floral crowns which they wear upon returning to the village at nightfall. There they meet with their beloved and they dance around a bonfire. The crowns are thrown over the houses, and whenever the crown falls, it is said that someone will die in that house; if the crown stays on the roof of the house, then good harvest and wealth will be bestowed upon the owners. As with other bonfire celebrations, jumping over the embers after the bonfire is not raging anymore is done to purify the person and also to bring health. Another folk belief is that during the S√¢nziene Eve night, the heavens open up, making it the strongest night for magic spells, especially for the love spells. Also it is said that the plants harvested during this night will have tremendous magical powers. It is not a good thing though to be a male and walk at night during Sanziene Eve night, as that is the time when the fairies dance in the air, blessing the crops and bestowing health on people - they do not like to be seen by males, and whomever sees them will be maimed, or the fairies will take their hearing/speech or make them mad. In some areas of the Carpathians, the villagers then light a big wheel of hay from the ceremonial bonfire and push it down a hill. This has been interpreted as a symbol for the setting sun (from the solstice to come and until the midwinter solstice, the days will be getting shorter). In cultural reference The consequences of heavens opening on S√¢nziene are connected by some to paranormal events reported during that period of each year. According to popular beliefs, strange things, both positive and negative, may happen to a person wandering alone on S√¢nziene night. Strange ethereal activities are believed to happen especially in places such as the BƒÉneasa forest (near the capital of Bucharest) or the Baciu forest (near the city of Cluj-Napoca). Mircea Eliade's novel, Noaptea de S√¢nziene (translated as The Forbidden Forest), includes references to the folk belief about skies opening at night, as well as to paranormal events happening in the BƒÉneasa Forest. In the form S√¢nziana (\\"the s√¢nzianƒÉ\\"), the word has also come to be used as a female name. It is notably used as such in Vasile Alecsandri's comedy S√¢nziana ≈üi Pepelea (later an opera by George StephƒÉnescu).

It was produced thereafter from late 1954, thru 1956 at the new Packard \\"Utica\\" Utica, Michigan facility. 1935-1948: Development Packard's Ultramatic transmission was the creation of the company's chief engineer Forest McFarland and his engineering team. The magnitude of this accomplishment is illustrated by the fact that it was the only automatic transmission developed and produced solely by an independent automaker, with no outside help. Devices like the Ultramatic were being tested and designed by Packard from 1935 on, but none satisfied the perfectionist engineer. The Ultramatic's development was halted, as was all automotive work during World War II, but resumed in earnest during 1946. Packard, during this period, was suffering greatly in competition with General Motors \\"Cadillac\\" Division, thanks to their popular self-shifting Hydra-Matic. The Hydra-Matic was available starting in 1941 and became very popular during the 1946-1948 time-frame, pushing along Packard's release of its new automatic drive. Packard at that time (1946‚Äì1949) only offered an Electromatic Vacuum Clutch option, which required manual shifting otherwise. As with most vacuum powered shifting and clutching devices, Electromatic was overall generally unreliable. Finally, in 1949, Packard's 50th Anniversary, McFarland's Ultramatic Drive became available as a $199 option. It was first offered only on the De-Luxe Packard Customs, following in 1950 by the entire lineup. 1949-1954: Ultramatic Drive The first Ultramatic Drive was a hydraulic torque converter automatic transmission with a two-speed plus reverse epicyclic geartrain, with torque converter lockup, called \\"Direct Drive\\" by Packard. The unit was fully hydraulically controlled with a \\"valve body,\\" like most early automatic transmissions before the advent of electronic control. The original Ultramatic did not switch automatically between high and low gearing ratios. The driver selected \\"high-range\\" or \\"low-range\\" ratios through the column shift lever. The intention was that in normal driving, the high (1:1) ratio would be selected at all times, and the two stage, dual turbine torque converter (actually a total of four turbines were employed) was used to reduce gearing for starting off. At a speed of (depending on rear axle ratio which affected the rate of governor pressure rise), hydraulic pressure overcame the opposing throttle pressure, as determined by carburetor linkage position, causing the Direct Shift Valve to apply the direct drive clutch. This \\"locked\\" the torque converter, giving direct mechanical drive from the engine to the rear wheels. This became the Ultramatic's definitive feature, eliminating the power-robbing slippage of the torque converter at cruising speeds. On the highway, the Ultramatic delivered the same economy and power as a manual transmission. With the exception of Borg-Warner, in their Studebaker \\"Automatic Drive\\", major automotive manufacturers did not generally employ a locking torque converter until nearly thirty years later. The low ratio was available for climbing and descending hills. When using the low ratio, the torque converter lockup happened at a slightly lower speed, and as a result of the reduction in the rate of the opposing throttle advancement, it helped to eliminate torque converter overheating issues that plagued early automatic transmissions, which because of this advancement were avoided in similar conditions with Ultramatic. Ratio selection was through a column shift, with a lighted selector quadrant on the steering column showing the range. The positions available were Parking, Neutral, High, Low and Reverse (PNHLR). After its first year, the Ultramatic Drive became available on all Packard models, and was immediately popular. It continued on, with a Packard program of modifications to improve reliability until 1954, although it was mostly trouble free from the start. In 1954, Ultramatic underwent a major upgrade to both the power transfer and hydraulic control components, which were reconfigured to give low gear starts automatically in the newly added \\"Drive\\" (D) range. Many Packard owners had complained of lackluster acceleration with the earlier Ultramatics, and had discovered that starting off in Low ratio, and switching to High while on the move gave a much brisker pickup. Ultramatic Drive, while durable, handled this manual shift from low to high poorly. To further illustrate the necessity of this feature, by 1954 both the Borg-Warner and Chevrolet Power-Glide in addition to the aforementioned Hydra-Matic and Chrysler's new PowerFlite performed ratio switches automatically as well (low- to high), while Buick's Dynaflow Drive continued using high gear starts until its demise after the 1963 model year. 1954: Gear-Start Ultramatic Drive Packard's new Ultramatic model introduced in the middle of the 1954 model year was officially called Gear-Start Ultramatic Drive, offering a new selector sequence on the column shift: 'D', for Drive, placed in between High, now represented with a simple dot, and Low (PN‚Ä¢DLR). In this new DRIVE range, it would use the low ratio and torque converter to start off, switching to the high ratio and ultimately to direct drive as the car accelerated, effectively automating what many Packard drivers had been doing manually with the older Ultramatic Drive. During 1954, and into 1955, Packard Motor Car Company, later Studebaker-Packard, went on a modernization spree of its aging facilities. It was decided by Packard President James J. Nance (1952‚Äì1956), and his manufacturing Vice-President, Ray Powers (1954‚Äì1956), that their East Grand Boulevard complex was no longer able, due to age and deterioration of that facility, to be further modified to handle the expected increase in production for the company in 1955 and beyond. A new facility was therefore planned and built for use by Packard as a transmission and engine facility in Utica, Michigan. This facility was actually built on the N/E corner of Packard Proving Ground Complex on Van Dyke Rd. The facility was sided by both 22 Mile Rd, and Mound. After completion, Packard moved the machinery, and production line for the Ultramatic, as well as its yet to be introduced V-8 engine during the summer and early fall of 1954. This facility therefore produced all 1954 \\"Gear-Start\\", 1955 \\"Twin-Ultramatic\\", and 1956 Ultramatic derivatives through the fall of 1956 when this facility was deactivated and sold as part of a corporate buyout deal with the Curtiss-Wright Company. 1955: Twin-Ultramatic Drive In 1955, Packard switched to a new V8 engine from its traditional straight-8, and launched a new evolution of its automatic transmission at the same time, the Twin-Ultramatic Drive. McFarland, his assistant John DeLorean, and their team were not satisfied with the improved pick-up of the Gear-Start Ultramatic, and modified the angle of the converter \\"pump\\" to allow a higher stall speed thus increasing the torque multiplication better suited to the torque curve of the new V8 engines. In addition, a slightly higher stall converter was produced for the sportier Caribbean model due to its use of two four-barrel carburetors. The Gear-Start's ability to start in low range and switch to high automatically was retained, but the selector quadrant indicator was altered and PN‚Ä¢DLR became PN'D'LR to better reflect the dual drive range capability of this transmission, all the better to compete with the Dual-Range Hydra-Matic. Functionality was the same; the first Drive position, to left of the 'D equated to High on the Gear-Start Ultramatic, while the second, situated to the right of D', was equivalent to the Drive position on the Gear- Start, giving the driver the option of starting in either High or Low with automatic upshifts, ending with Direct Drive engagement of the torque converter, thus the Twin- designation referred to this dual Drive capability. The Twin-Ultramatic suffered many \\"teething problems\\" when introduced, which did significant damage to Packard's reputation for quality and reliability. However, over the years it's become clear that Packard's initial Twin Ultramatic problems were not out of line with any other new contemporary designs and the engineering department's program of running changes and updates greatly increased its functionality, excepting driver abuse through excessive application of the higher torque V8's power potential. Lower-powered models in the Packard range and those sold to American Motors suffered fewer problems. Exacerbating the difficulties, Packard was hemorrhaging experienced dealerships, which meant that many 1955 Packards were not being maintained to the previous high standards. 1956: Ultramatic and Touchbutton Ultramatic The column-mounted push button selector box for the Touchbutton Ultramatic in a 1956 Caribbean. The year 1956 saw a further development of the transmission in a major redesign of a majority of all individual transmission components, including re-calibration of the shift pattern producing an improvement of shift control. In addition there was a nomenclature change which reverted to the plain name of Ultramatic Drive. This year also saw the selector quadrant undergo yet another change to become: PNHDLR in order to further clarify the two drive ranges and accommodate the soon to be released push button control pod. In addition General Motors threatened lawsuits regarding dual \\"Drive\\" ranges, because of their \\"Dual-Range Hydra-Matic Drive\\" of 1953, and beyond that used this dual drive range selector pattern. In addition to the numerous upgrading, small but important changes to shift linkages, better build quality, and stricter tolerances restored Packard levels of reliability to the 1956 transmission. Also new that year was an aluminum transmission casing, making the Ultramatic lighter than its competition, including the Chrysler pushbutton PowerFlite. Future transmissions from all manufacturers were to follow Packard's lead. Packard decided to offer a \\"Pushbutton Transmission Control\\" for the 1956 series called \\"Touch Button Ultramatic\\". The new control, was standard from the factory only on the 1956 Packard Caribbean Convertible, and hardtop. No other models had this control standard. \\"Touch Button Ultramatic\\" was therefore, a $52 option for: \\"The Patrician\\" (sedan), \\"The Four Hundred\\" (hardtop), and later after introduction in early 1956, the Packard Executive (sedan, and hardtop) . It was also available in all Packard \\"Clipper\\" (sedan and hardtop) models as well. The mechanism was built to Packard specifications by Auto-Lite, a major Packard supplier. On a thick arm off the side of the steering column extended to the driver's right about , replacing the regular automatic shift lever, was a rectangular pod with six buttons for selection. The bottom row of buttons offered Park, Reverse and Drive, while the top row contained the Neutral, Low and High buttons. The system was electrically actuated, rather than Chrysler's very reliable mechanical pushbuttons, and was troublesome from the beginning. The electric shift motor, essentially a modified starter motor, proved insufficient to move the car out of Park on a steep hill, and would pop the circuit breaker; electrical contact problems, wiring problems and other issues were prevalent even when new, and worsened with age. When the contract was cancelled after Packard production ceased, Auto-Lite destroyed the tooling, making spare parts for the system unobtainable. Although true Packard production ceased after the 1956 model year, Studebaker-Packard Corporation continued to have service obligations to Packard owners, and the 1955 Twin-Ultramatic and the 1956 Touchbutton Ultramatic were a recurring problem. Historical perspective Packard's successful development of its own automatic transmission was quite unique, as no other independent (non-Big Three) automaker managed such a feat. The company's worsening financial situation throughout the 1950s, however, prevented them from keeping up with the transmission development of the larger companies. Packard's attempts to update the Ultramatic, in 1954, 1955 and 1956, were not sufficiently tested enough to iron out the problems of the new design. These problems, damaged the company's once sterling reputation for Quality. Some automotive historians, who have written documented histories on Packard, have/had argued that Packard should have dropped the Ultramatic after 1954, and purchased a more modern transmission design from another manufacturer, such as Hydra-Matic. Such opinions fail to consider that Packard's use of a locking torque converter was not only up to date, but ahead of its time. And despite the problems, the transmissions worked beautifully when certain factors were ideal. In addition, the only truly new modern transmission in the 1950s, that was not a repeat of anyone else, (which did not appear until 1956) was the Dual Coupling Hydra-Matic but that had serious teething problems of its own similar to Packard, and their Ultramatic. In retrospect Packard's Gear-Start Ultramatic (1954), Twin Ultramatic (1955), and Ultramatic Drive (1956), most serious design flaw; was the low to high shift transition. Adding a poorly timed high clutch application and low band release over much of the allowable up-shift range resulted in many premature high clutch failures. This situation resulted in an unusual sensitivity to individual driving habits determining useful clutch life. Therefore, while the transmission was designed to physically accept a high torque V8, its control system needed further development. Packard had valid plans for upgrading the Ultramatic Drive further for 1957 and beyond, to address the problems noted.This plan however, was eclipsed when needed restructuring/financing for Studebaker-Packard did not materialize. Surviving Ultramatic transmissions Packard enthusiasts have kept many units in service since the company's demise. Better modern transmission fluids, aftermarket transmission coolers, and improved rebuild parts combine to improve the reliability of the factory originals.

Early career Adachi was born into an impoverished family, originally descended from samurai, in Ishikawa Prefecture in 1890 (the 23rd year of the reign of Emperor Meiji, which is why his father, who had been a professional officer in the Japanese military, chose the kanji for \\"23\\" to represent his given name \\"Hataz≈ç\\"). Too poor to afford the military preparatory schools necessary for a career in the Imperial Japanese Navy, as a youth he tested into the fiercely competitive Tokyo Cadet Academy, which enabled him to enter the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, from which he graduated from the 22nd class in 1910. Adachi served with the 1st Imperial Guards Division, and then graduated from the 34th class of the Army War College in 1922. Unlike many Army officers of his day, Adachi avoided involvement in the political factions which plagued the Japanese Army in the 1930s. After serving in a number of staff and administrative positions within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff, Adachi was assigned to the Railway Guard unit of the Kwangtung Army, responsible for the security of the South Manchuria Railway in 1933. Career=Second Sino-Japanese War Adachi was promoted to colonel in 1934, and was given command of the IJA 12th Infantry Regiment in 1936. During the Shanghai Incident of July 1937, Adachi also gained a reputation of leading his troops from the front, where the fighting was the thickest. He was injured by a mortar barrage in September, which permanently damaged his right leg. He was promoted to major general in 1938, and promoted to commander of the IJA 26th Infantry Brigade. Adachi had a reputation as a \\"soldier's general\\", sharing the miserable living conditions of his troops and welcoming open discussion with his officer and staff.Budge, Pacific War Online Encyclopedia Promoted to lieutenant general in August 1940, he was commander of the IJA 37th Division at the Battle of South Shanxi. In 1940, he became a Chief of staff of the North China Area Army from 1941‚Äì1942, during the height of its scorched earth campaigns against the Chinese forces. Pacific War On 9 November 1942, Adachi was appointed commander in chief of the newly formed 18th Army on Rabaul and the north coast of New Guinea from 1942‚Äì1945.Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II The 18th Army contained the IJA 20th Division and IJA 41st Division, both of which arrived safely. However, the IJA 51st Division, including Adachi and his senior staff, came under Allied air attack while en route from Rabaul to Lae, in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea. All eight transport ships and four destroyers were sunk with the loss of 3,664 men, and only 2,427 men of the division were rescued. With the defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy in the Solomon Islands campaign, and with landings of US forces led by Douglas MacArthur at Aitape and Hollandia from 22‚Äì27 April 1944, isolated the vast majority of Adachi's forces. His forces, suffering from malaria, heat exhaustion and malnutrition were rendered ineffective for the remainder of the war, despite Adachi's efforts to achieve some form of self-sufficiency by planting crops and giving priority in rations to the sick. As ammunition began to run low, many of Adachi's commanders resorted to banzai charges against the Allied beachhead at Aitape rather than surrender. By the end of the war in September 1945, most of his forces had been annihilated. Of Adachi's original 140,000 men, barely 13,000 were still alive when the war ended. He surrendered to the Australian 6th Division at Cape Wom, by Wewak, New Guinea.

At the end of the war, Adachi was taken into custody by the Australian government and charged with war crimes in connection with mistreatment and arbitrary execution of prisoners of war. Although not personally involved in any of the atrocities mentioned, Adachi insisted on absorbing command responsibility for the actions of his subordinates during the military tribunal. On 12 July 1947 he was sentenced to imprisonment for life.

The station was temporarily closed from June 25 to August 24, 2018, during the Twin Peaks Tunnel shutdown. West Portal is a bottleneck for Muni Metro trains in all directions, as automobiles blocking train traffic momentarily can cause cascading delays. During the shutdown, new switches and a new control panel were installed to improve manual operation of the intersection. In 2019, parking control officers were assigned to direct traffic through the unsignaled intersection, which reduced delays by 40%. As part of August 2020 changes to Muni Metro, the K and L were through-routed as an all-surface line, with frequent S Shuttle service between West Portal and Embarcadero.

Prior to 1973 it was an independent city, incorporated in 1915, but amalgamation with the town of Hespeler, Ontario, the town of Preston, Ontario and the village of Blair formed the new municipality of Cambridge. Parts of the surrounding townships were also included. The first mayor of Cambridge was Claudette Millar. There was considerable resistance among the local population to this \\"shotgun marriage\\" arranged by the provincial government and a healthy sense of rivalry had always governed relations among the three communities. Even today, many residents refer to their area of Cambridge as being Galt or Preston or Hespeler. Each unique centre has its own history that is well documented in the Cambridge City Archives. No current population data is available for the former Galt since the Census reports cover only the full area of Cambridge. The former Galt covers the largest portion of the amalgamated municipality, making up the southern half of the city. It is located on the Grand River and has a very long history as an industrialized area. The former Preston and Blair are located on the western side of the city, while the former Hespeler is in the most northeasterly section of Cambridge. History Old Post Office in Galt (Cambridge) built in 1886, renovated in 2016. (2010 photo) In the late 1700s, developers began to buy land around the Grand River from the Six Nations Indians who were led by Joseph Brant. One speculator, William Dickson, a wealthy immigrant from Scotland, bought of land along the Grand River in 1816; this was later to become Galt and the Dumfries Townships. Dickson divided the land and advertised in Scotland for immigrants; many were attracted and arrived in what is now Galt, primarily from Roxboroughshire and Selkirkshire. Dickson sold lots to these new settlers. The centre of the planned community was at the junction of Mill Creek and the Grand River, then called Shade's Mills. Absalom Shade, a carpenter from Pennsylvania was hired in 1816 by William Dickson to manage his lands in Dumfries Township. He later operated a general store, a mill and a distillery in Shade's Mills, which later became Galt. In 1819, he built a small bridge over the Grand River to serve customers on the other side; it lasted until 1832. Shade also supplied food and built roads for the Canada Company. He helped establish the Grand River Navigation Company to help transport goods along the river and the Gore Bank in Hamilton. Shade also helped develop railroads in the area and was among those who built Galt's Trinity Anglican Church in 1844.https://www.kitchenerpost.ca/living-story/6224443-trinity-anglican- church-dates-back-to-galt-s-founding/ A new streetcar system, the Galt, Preston and Hespeler electric railway, (later called the Grand River Railway Company) would begin operation in 1894, connecting Preston and Galt. In 1911, the line reached Hespeler, Berlin (later called Kitchener) and Waterloo; by 1916 it had been extended to Brantford/Port Dover. The electric rail system ended passenger services in April, 1955. Dickson decided to name the Post Office Galt, in honour of John Galt of the Canada Company which was developing this entire area. Primarily agricultural in early years, Galt had attracted industry by 1840 and became the largest town in the Grand River area until the early 1900s. Galt was incorporated as a village in 1850, as a town in 1857 and as a city in 1915. Throughout that entire period, it continued to grow based on a large industrial base. The Canadian Gazetteer of 1846 discussed the community's water power which was essential to power the local industries which were making the area prosperous. At the time the population was about 1000, most originally from Scotland. There were five churches, a weekly newspaper, a fire department, a public library, a bank and a curling club. The post office received mail every day. Industries already in operation included \\"two grist mills (each containing four run of stones), two saw mills, two foundries, two carding machines and cloth factories, one brewery, two distilleries, one tannery...\\" A foundry had also opened on Grand Avenue, initially as Dumfries Foundry which would later become Goldie & McCulloch, a major manufacturer of safes, wood working machinery and engines powered by steam or by gasoline. It would continue as a major operation under several other owners until 2000.http://vintagemachinery.org/mfgindex/detail.aspx?ID=382http://www.southworks.ca/about.htm The largest of the early schools in the community, the Galt Grammar School, opened in 1852 with William Tassie as headmaster starting in 1853 at the site of what later became the Galt Collegiate. The school gained widespread recognition and attracted students from across North America. By 1872, it had been recognized as a Collegiate Institute. Galt incorporated as a town on January 1, 1857, with Morris C. Lutz elected as the first mayor. By 1858, a \\"Town Hall and Market House\\" had been built with an \\"Italianate\\", particularly Tuscan, influence. In later years, the Town Hall became the City Hall and was extensively modified. Galt was incorporated as a city in 1915. The population in 1869 was 4000 and the community was said to be one of the principal manufacturing locations in Ontario.https://archive.org/stream/provinceontario00mcevgoog#page/n164/mode/2up, page 164 The railway reached Galt in 1879, increasing the opportunities of exporting local goods and importing others. In 1889, the former Dickson Mill on the Grand River was converted to a hydro electric plant which operated until July 1911 when a power grid from Niagara Falls reached the community.https://www.therecord.com/living-story/7142935-flash-from-the-past- industry-crowds-the-grand-river-in-galt/ An interurban streetcar connected Galt to Hespeler and nearby Preston. In the early 1870s, the Credit Valley Railway planned to implement several lines running west and north from Toronto and in 1873, built freight and passenger buildings in Galt. By 1879, the company had installed a bridge crossing the river and in December completed a preliminary test run with a train; it was successful. The CVR venture was not long-lived however, and in 1883, the line was taken over by the Canadian Pacific Railway which built a brick passenger building that still stands.https://www.therecord.com/living-story/8035119-flash-from-the-past- private-moment-goes-public-in-galt-rail-yard/ Not long after Galt had become part of Cambridge, in May 1974, flooding on the Grand River filled city streets with water to a depth of about four feet. In some areas of the downtown core, the depth was 17.4 feet, smashing windows and carrying goods along the streets. Approximately 75 businesses were affected, with virtually none covered by relevant insurance. The flood caused an estimated $5 million in damage. Government The local government is the Cambridge City Council consisting of a mayor and eight councillors, each representing a ward. The mayor is Katheryn McGarry (2018-2022 term) and formally (2014-2018 term) was Doug Craig. Region of Waterloo Headquarters in Kitchener Cambridge is also represented on the higher-tier Waterloo Regional Council which consists of the Regional Chair, the Mayors of the seven cities and townships, and eight additional Councilors - four from Kitchener and two each from Cambridge and Waterloo. Ken Seiling has held the position of Regional Chair since 1985. Cambridge is represented in Ottawa by Bryan May (Liberal), the federal member of Parliament who defeated the previous incumbent MP (Gary Goodyear, Conservative ‚Äì 2004 to 2015) in the October 2015 election. The MPP for Cambridge is Belinda Karahalios of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, who was first elected to this position in 2018. Municipal services Galt was an independent city in Waterloo County, Ontario until 1973 when amalgamation created the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. At that time, Galt was amalgamated into the new city of Cambridge. The Region handles many services, including Police, waste management, community health, transit, recreation, planning, roads and social services. The Region consists of the cities of Cambridge, Kitchener, and Waterloo, and the townships of Woolwich, Wilmot, Wellesley, and North Dumfries. Public transportation Since 2000, local and regional transit throughout the Region of Waterloo has been provided by Grand River Transit (GRT), which was created by a merger of the former Cambridge Transit and Kitchener Transit. The Grand River Transit 200 iXpress bus in downtown Galt in 2015. Within Cambridge, the route has since been replaced by the 302 ION Bus. GRT operates a number of routes in Cambridge, four of which travel outside of the city: presently the 52, 61, and 72 buses run to southern Kitchener. The Ainslie St. Transit Terminal in Galt was the southern terminus of GRT's original iXpress route (later rebranded as the 200 iXpress after the addition of more routes), which ran through all three cities in the Region of Waterloo before terminating in the north at the Conestoga Mall terminal (later renamed Conestoga station) in Waterloo. The route was launched in 2005 as a part of the Regional Growth Management Strategy, which called for greater densification of urban cores, and was considered an intermediary step while more long-term rapid transit plans were still maturing. In June 2009 Regional Council voted to approve a plan to construct a light rail line, which has been named the Ion rapid transit. The first phase would run from Conestoga Mall in the north of Waterloo, to Fairview Park Mall in the south of Kitchener, while the second phase of the line would run from Fairview Mall to the Galt area of Cambridge. Mayor Doug Craig was a determined opponent of the plan, arguing that an expanded express bus system would be just as effective but much less expensive. By late February 2017, the Kitchener-Waterloo portion was well into the final phase of construction, but plans for the Cambridge section of the LRT were still in the very early stage. Public consultations were just getting started at the time. Three routes had been agreed on in 2011, with eight \\"endorsed\\" stops: at Fairway, Sportsworld, Preston, Pinebush, Cambridge Centre Mall, Can-Amera, Delta and Ainslie Street Terminal. Three others were still being considered. As the launch of light rail service approached, Grand River Transit began to lay the groundwork for the transition from iXpress to Ion service by renaming the 200 iXpress to the 200 iXpress/ION Bus Rapid Transit. On Monday, 24 June 2019, three days after the launch of Ion light rail between Conestoga station in Waterloo and Fairway station in Kitchener, the 200 iXpress route was discontinued. Its southern section running through Cambridge was replaced with the 302 ION Bus route, terminating in the north at Fairway station, with riders able to continue on the light rail system as a linear transfer. As of June 2019, the Region of Waterloo planned for the 302 ION Bus to ultimately be replaced by an extension of the light rail line to Galt. Education Galt Collegiate Institute, one of the oldest public high schools in Ontario. Public English-language schooling is provided by the Waterloo Region District School Board, which operates 26 elementary and five secondary schools in Cambridge. The most notable high school is the 150-year-old Galt Collegiate Institute and Vocational School. Publicly funded Catholic education is available through schools operated by the Waterloo Catholic District School Board. The University of Waterloo School of Architecture campus is located in Cambridge in the Riverside Silk Mill, also known as the Tiger Brand Building. Inside there is a theatre, a fitness room, and the gallery \\"Design at Riverside\\", which is one of two publicly funded galleries dedicated to architecture in Canada. The School of Architecture is home to 380 students who live, study, and learn within the Cambridge community.

(Photo: Archives of the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, University of Miami) Cesare Emiliani (8 December 1922 ‚Äì 20 July 1995) was an Italian-American scientist, geologist, micropaleontologist, and founder of paleoceanography, developing the timescale of marine isotope stages, which despite modifications remains in use today. He established that the ice ages of the last half million years or so are a cyclic phenomenon, which gave strong support to the hypothesis of Milankovitch and revolutionized ideas about the history of the oceans and of the glaciations. He was also the proponent of Project \\"LOCO\\" (for Long Cores) to the U.S. National Science Foundation. The project was a success providing evidence of the history of the oceans and also serving to test the hypotheses of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics. Cesare Emiliani was honored by having the genus Emiliania erected as home for the taxon huxleyi, which had previously been assigned to Coccolithus. He was further honored by receiving the Vega Medal of the Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography (SSAG) (Swedish: Svenska S√§llskapet f√∂r Antropologi och Geografi) in 1983, and the Alexander Agassiz Medal of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 1989 for his isotopic studies on Pleistocene and Holocene planktic foraminifera. In his later years, he dedicated a great deal of time to promoting a calendar reform based on the Holocene calendar (HE) concept to eliminate the BC‚ÄìAD chronology gap caused by the lack of a year 0.  Biography  Cesare Emiliani was born in Bologna, Italy. His parents were Luigi and Maria (Manfredini) Emiliani. Emiliani studied geology at the University of Bologna in post-war Italy and earned his first doctorate in Geology (micropaleontology) also at Bologna in 1945. After graduation he worked as a micropaleontologist with the Societ√† Idrocarburi Nazionali in Florence from 1946‚Äì48. In 1948 he was offered and accepted the Rollin D. Salisbury Fellowship in the Department of Geology at the University of Chicago where he subsequently obtained his second Ph.D. in Geology (isotopic paleoclimatology) in 1950. From 1950 to 1956 he was Research Associate in Harold Urey‚Äôs Geochemistry Laboratory in the Enrico Fermi Institute for Nuclear Studies at the University of Chicago. In 1957 Cesare Emiliani was working on Foraminifera (microscopic protists whose remains are greatly abundant in the fossil record) and was particularly interested in great climate changes known to have occurred during the Pleistocene Age. He was sure these tiny shells deposited in the ubiquitous ooze that coats the sea bottom held important clues. For that reason he was looking at the time for a place to work where there were ships and trained personnel to help him to obtain core samples of the deep-sea sediments for his studies. An interview with Dr. Walton Smith convinced Cesare that the University of Miami‚Äôs Institute of Marine Science, later to become the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, was the right place to conduct his research and thus he moved there that same year. In 1967 he was named Chairman of the Division of Geology and Geophysics at the Institute. At that time he organized the department of Geological Sciences on the main campus of the University of Miami and remained its Chairman until his retirement in 1993. He died in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, in 1995, and was survived by his wife Rosita (4 November 1923 ‚Äì 27 December 2010) and two children, Mario and Sandra, and four grandchildren, Michael, Julia, Joey, and Dante. Memorial tributes were written by colleagues Barbara Lidz and William Hay and Eloise Zakevich.  Works = Popular  *Emiliani, Cesare. (1992).

Pallava Civil War  During the invasion of the Chola country, the Pandya king Varagunavarman II became an ally of Nripatunga, the eldest son of the Pallava King Nandivarman III. When Nandivarman died in 869 CE differences arose between Nripatunga and his stepbrother Aparajita, probably owing to the latter's ambition to rule the kingdom on his own right. Both sides looked for allies. Nripatunga continued to have Varaguna Pandya by his side while Aparajita allied with the Ganga king Prithvipathi I and with Aditya Chola I. The rival armies met at Thirupurambiyam near Kumbakonam c. 885 CE. The armies of Pandyas and Nripatunga Pallava were routed by Aparajita Pallava and Aditya I Chola. But Some Inscriptions purely clarified Nirpatunga Was not alive during the war. So it is the war between Pallvas and Pandiyas to establish Legal Supremacy  Ascendancy  Although the victor of the Thirupurambiyam battle was Aparajita, the real gains went to Aditya I Chola. This battle ensured the end of Pandya power in the south. Pandya Varagunavarman renounced his throne and followed an ascetic life. The grateful Aparajita not only allowed Aditya I Chola to keep the territories won by Vijayalaya Chola, but also to add new territories from the defeated Pandyas.  Invasion of the Pallava country  During 903 CE, the 32nd year of his reign, Aditya I Chola, not satisfied with his subordinate position, planned and carried out an attack on his erstwhile overlord, the Pallava king Aparajita. In the battle that ensued, Aditya pounced upon Aparajita when he was mounted on an elephant and killed him. That spelt the end of the Pallava rule in Tondaimandalam (north Tamil Nadu) and the whole of the Pallava kingdom became Chola territory. This marked the effective end of the once great Pallava empire in the history of South India. The conquest of the Tondaimandalam earned for Aditya I the epithet \\"Tondainadu pavina Rajakesarivarman\\" (‡Æ§‡Øä‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡Øà‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æü‡ØÅ ‡Æ™‡Ææ‡Æµ‡Æø‡Æ© ‡Æá‡Æ∞‡Ææ‡Æö‡Æï‡Øá‡Æö‡Æ∞‡Æø‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Øç‡ÆÆ‡Æ©‡Øç) - \\"Rajakesarivarman who overran Tondainadu\\".

Aditya‚Äôs contributions to Temples Aditya I is known to have built a number of temples 108 for Shiva along the banks of the Kaveri. The Kanyakumari inscription gives us the information that Aditya I was also known by the surname Kodandarama. There is a temple near the town of Tondaimanarrur called Kodandarameshvaraa, also mentioned in its inscriptions by the name Adityesvara. This seems to have been built by Aditya I. He also revised Annamalaiyar sanctum in Thiruvaannamalai during 872900. Aditya also was the patron of Sureswara and prabhakara who were pupils of kumarila bhatta a favourite student of Adisankaracharya. The author of that work do confirm that they settled in the banks of Kaveri (Sibishu kaveriteere meaning in the country of cholas (Sibi is an ancestor of Cholas)) and were employed by Manukula Adityan (Aditya Chola).  Death and Succession  In an inscription AdityaI is distinguished by the epithet in Tamil(‡Æ§‡Øä‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡Øà‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Æ∞‡ØÇ‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡Æ§‡ØÅ‡Æû‡Øç‡Æö‡Æø‡Æ© ‡Æâ‡Æü‡Øà‡ÆØ‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Øç Thondaimaanaruur thunjina udaiyaar). \\"The king who died at Tondaimanarrur\\". AdityaI died in 907 CE at Tondaimanarrur. His son Parantaka I built a Shiva temple over his ashes. AdityaI was survived by his queens Ilangon Pichchi and Vayiri Akkan alias Tribhuvana Madeviyar. Besides these two queens, AdityaI also had a mistress named Nangai Sattaperumanar as evidenced from an inscription. AdityaI had a long and victorious reign during which he laid the foundation of the future greatness of the Chola empire.

A member of the northern U√≠ N√©ill kindred of the Cen√©l nE√≥gain, √Åed was the son of Niall Caille. Background From the death of √Åed All√°n in 743 until the overthrow of M√°el Sechnaill mac Domnaill by Brian Boru in 1002, the succession to the High Kingship of Ireland alternated between northern and southern branches of the U√≠ N√©ill with the north represented by members of the Cen√©l n√âogain, √Åed's paternal kindred, and the south by the Clann Cholm√°in, his mother's kin.Byrne, p. 265, appendix 1, list 1 & appendix 2, tables 2, 3 & 5\\\\. The single exception to this system was the reign of Congalach Cnogba. Francis John Byrne describes this as \\"a fragile convention, marked by watchful jealousy rather than friendly accord.\\"Byrne, p. 265. During the reign of M√°el Sechnaill mac Ma√≠l Ruanaid, who succeeded √Åed's father as High King, the balance of power between north and south which had ensured the alternating succession appeared to be tipping in favour of the southern Clann Cholm√°in kindred. The weakness of the Kings of Munster following the death of the powerful Feidlimid mac Crimthainn in 847 led to repeated attacks on Munster by M√°el Sechnaill in the 850s and a submission by the kings of Munster in 858. In 859, Osraige was made subject to the U√≠ N√©ill, and this led to open warfare between M√°el Sechnaill and √Åed.Byrne, pp. 263‚Äì266; Charles-Edwards. Origins and family √Åed was the son of Niall Caille and Gormlaith. His mother, Gormflaith ingen Donncadha, is called \\"Gormlaith of the dazzling white complexion\\" by the Banshenchas. His maternal grandfather was Donnchad Midi, his paternal grandfather √Åed Oirdnide. His father, his mother's brother, Conchobar mac Donnchada, and both of his grandfathers had been counted as High Kings of Ireland. The names of three of √Åed's wives are recorded, although the order of his marriages is perhaps uncertain. His first wife may have been Gormlaith Rapach, \\"the harsh\\", daughter of Muiredach mac Eochada, king of Ulster. The Banshenchas say that Domnall mac √Åeda was her son, and Eithne, who married Flann Sinna, may have been her daughter. √Åed's second wife, Land ingen D√∫ngaile (sister of Cerball mac D√∫nlainge, king of Osraige) was the widow of his predecessor as High King, M√°el Sechnaill mac M√°ele Ruanaid, a grandson of Donnchad Midi. His third known wife was M√°el Muire, probably the daughter of Cin√°ed mac Ailp√≠n, the king of the Picts in Britain. She was the mother of Niall Gl√∫ndub. On √Åed's death she married his successor Flann Sinna. Other children of √Åed included Domnall Dabaill (ancestor of Domnall Ua Lochlainn); a son named M√°el Dub, reputed a saint; and M√°el D√∫in, who ruled Ailech as √Åed's deputy until his early death in 867. Early years Following the death of Neill Caille in 845, √Åed's uncle M√°el D√∫in mac √Åeda assumed the kingship of Ailech. When √Åed succeeded him is not recorded, but it might have been in 855. √Åed is mentioned for the first time in the annals this year, as the Annals of Ulster records that he > made a foray against the Ulaid, and he left behind dead Coinnec√°n son of > Colm√°n and Flaithbertach son of Niall, and a large number besidesAnnals of > Ulster 855.3 Presumably Flaithbertach was his own brother, and this foray was made to secure √Åed's position as king of Ailech. √Åed came into power at a critical period in the history of Ireland. Raids by Norse Vikings had taken place for half a century, and the Norse settlements now seemed to have become permanent establishments, more than just bases for raids. They also now had an effective leadership under Amla√≠b Conung and √çmar. At this time, both the contemporary annalists as well as modern historians refer to them not just as Vikings, foreigners or pagans, but also Norse-Irish or Norse-Gaels. √Åed Findliath has been described as one of the Irish high-kings who most effectively fought the Norse expansion in Ireland. He did indeed win some crucial battles against the Norse-Gaels; the first recorded victory is in 856, at the battle of Glenn Foichle,AU 856.5 Gall-Gaeidhelu here translated Norse-gael. Gall literally denotes stranger or foreigner, but is used in the annalistic records of this period only in the meaning of Norse foreigners. Viking raiders are generally referred to as pagans or heathens six years prior to him becoming high-king. The reigning High-King at the time, Mael Sechnaill, seemed more concerned with the internal Irish power struggle, particularly in Munster, than with engaging the Norse. There is, however, one reference in 856 to him fighting against \\"pagans\\" (Vikings) with the support of the Norse-Gaels.AU 856.2 Against Gennti supported by Gall-Ghoidhelaib This could be interpreted as an alliance between the Norse settlers and the established Irish society against marauders. In 858, M√°el Sechnaill finally managed to establish control over Munster, and in 859 he also made a peace settlement with Cerball mac D√∫nlainge, king of Osraige (forced upon him by Cerball, who had allied himself with Amla√≠b and √çmar and ravaged M√≠de). M√°el Sechnaill now turned his attention to the north, where the growing power of √Åed Findliath had become a threat against him as head of U√≠ N√©ill. In 860 he brought an army consisting of forces from all of the southern part of Ireland to Armagh. While they were camped there, √Åed Findliath attacked. The outcome of the battle seem to have been some sort of draw.AU 858.4, 859.2‚Äì3 og 860.1 By now it was √Åed Findliath who sought an alliance with the Norse in Dublin. In 861 as well as 862 he plundered M√≠de in co-operation with Norse forces; in 862 he also had the support of Flann mac Conaing, king of Brega.AU 861.1 862.2 Neither Amla√≠b nor √çmar is mentioned on these occasions, but the annalistic entry of 862 reads \\"the Norse kings\\": riga Gall.  King of Tara  M√°el Sechnaill mac M√°ele Ruanaid died 20 November 862, and he was on that occasion described in the Annals of Ulster as ri h-Erenn uile, king of all Ireland. That was a title that would never be used to refer to √Åed Findliath, even though he assumed the kingship of Tara following M√°el Sechnaill's death, and has also been counted in the lists of High Kings of Ireland. His kingship was disputed throughout his 17-year-long reign, and he did not even have support from the southern clans of U√≠ N√©ill. The annals show that the Taillten Fair was not held in six of those 17 years, which is a strong indication of unrest. The Norse of Dublin had, by the beginning of √Åed's reign, become an important, if not very trustworthy, ally in the struggle for power in M√≠de. M√°el Sechnaill's successor as head of Clann Cholmain and king of M√≠de, Lorc√°n mac Cathail, allied himself with Amlaib, √çmar and Auisle against Flann of Brega. Flann was a former ally of Dublin, and still √Åed's most important ally in the central part of Ireland. Lorc√°n and his Norse allies plundered Brega in 863, and in 864 Conchobar mac Donnchada, king of Lagore (southern Brega) and presumably an ally of Flann against Lorc√°n, was captured and drowned near Clonard on Amlaib's order. √Åed led a host to M√≠de, captured Lorc√°n and blinded him. √Åed now had some notable victories against the Norse. He defeated the Vikings at Lough Foyle in 866 and uprooted their settlements. In 866 Amla√≠b and Auisle left Ireland with the larger part of the Norse forces, and, in co-operation with the Norse-Gaels from present-day Scotland, they attacked the Picts.AU 866.1 Gallaib Erenn & Alban √Åed seized this opportunity, plundering and burning all the Norse bases (longphorts) in the northern part of Ireland.AU 866.4 the Norse bases are referred as Longportu Gall In 868 √Åed again was confronted by a coalition of his Irish rivals and the Norse-Gaels. According to the Annals of Ulster he defeated \\"the U√≠ Ne√≠ll of Brega, and the Laigin, and a large force of the foreigners\\" in a battle at a place called Cell Ua nDaigri. Flann of Brega was killed in this battle. This battle has been depicted as a decisive victory over the Norse. Amlaib and √çmar were, however, very active in Ireland during the following years and seem to have suffered little harm to their ambition or strength. It is probably more accurate to regard this battle as a victory over the southern U√≠ Ne√≠ll and Leinster. In 870 √Åed followed up his victory from 868 by invading Leinster with the support of his new ally Cerball of Osraige, and then invaded Leinster again in 874.AU 868.4, 870.2, 874.3 √Åed Findliath died on 20 November 879, at Druim Inasclainn:https://archive.org/stream/historyofkilsara00lesl#page/n211/mode/2up in the territory of Conaille. On that occasion he was described as \\"king of Tara\\" (rex Temorie), although a poem from the annals refers to him as \\"over- king of the Irish\\" (airdri Gaidhel).AU 879.1 He was buried at either Armagh or Dromiskin.https://archive.org/stream/historyofkilsara00lesl#page/170/mode/2up NotesReferences  Byrne, Francis John, Irish Kings and High- Kings.

Production began in late 1953; despite the launch of Chrysler's three-speed TorqueFlite automatic in 1956, the simple and durable PowerFlite remained available on Plymouths and Dodges through the 1961 model year, after which it was discontinued. Chrysler was the last of Detroit's Big Three automakers to introduce a fully automatic transmission, some 14 years after General Motors had introduced Oldsmobile's Hydramatic automatic transmission and nearly three years after Ford's Ford-O-Matic. Packard's Ultramatic debuted in 1949, and Studebaker's Automatic Drive was introduced in 1950. The PowerFlite was simple in its construction and operation, with fewer parts than competing transmissions. It was also quite durable, being used behind every Chrysler Corporation engine from the lowly Plymouth Six to the Imperial's Hemi V-8. Unlike most other automatic transmissions, PowerFlite did not feature a \\"Park\\" range, making it necessary to use the handbrake whenever the car was parked. All Chrysler products at the time had a parking brake independent from the vehicle's wheel brakes, a single brake drum mounted on the driveshaft, just behind the transmission. This had the (intended) effect of locking both rear wheels in the same way that the \\"Park\\" setting did in other transmissions. When first introduced, PowerFlite was controlled by a single lever mounted on the steering column. The shift quadrant sequence was R-N-D-L, which differed from the more common P-N-D-L-R on other makes. In most other makes, it was necessary to pass through all forward ranges to put the car in reverse, and then back through some of those ranges to drive forward. Chrysler promoted the greater safety of the PowerFlite pattern; because forward and reverse settings were separated by neutral and it was necessary to move the lever only one notch to the left or right to put the car in motion, so an accidental overshift past D would result in a harmless shift to low gear rather than an unintended engagement of reverse. Many years later, when the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began regulating vehicle controls and displays, the Chrysler pattern (with the Park setting added, becoming P-R-N- D-L), became mandatory for the safety reasons originally stated by Chrysler. In 1955, Chrysler moved the shift lever to the dashboard in a vertical slot with \\"R\\" at the top and \\"L\\" at the bottom. In 1956, Chrysler switched to pushbutton transmission controls, which remained the only PowerFlite shift mechanism. The PowerFlite was reverse engineered and copied by the Sovietshttps://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/heritage_zis_zil in the Soviet Union and an adapted counterfeit ersatz was for instance utilized and fitted into the ZIL-111 limousine, which was used by member of the Soviet politbureu as a representative fleet vehicle.http://www.carsonelove.com/favorite-cars-of- the-soviet-unionhttps://fee.org/articles/soviet-communism-was-dependent-on- western-technology/ References External links  * \\"Chrysler Drops Clutch Pedal With New Automatic Transmission.\\" Popular Mechanics,August 1953, p. 81\\\\.

It is one mile (1.6 km) east of the A49 road. The park is known for its follies. Park Today the park consists of of follies and landscaped parkland grounds and rocky outcrops, based around the ruins of the medieval Red Castle. The park was created as the gardens for Hawkstone Hall. Hawkstone Hall itself was established by Richard Hill of Hawkstone (1655‚Äì1727), also known as 'The Great Hill', circa 1707, whilst the follies, estate and reputation were mainly established by his nephew and heir Sir Rowland Hill, 1st Baronet Hill of Hawkstone (1705‚Äì1783) and Sir Richard Hill, 2nd Baronet (1733‚Äì1808) in the 18th century. The park then fell foul of a century of neglect and decay until an ongoing programme of restoration was started in 1990, enabling it to be re- opened in 1993. It is now scheduled as Grade-1 listed on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. It takes a 2.5-hour hiking tour to completely see each folly and their landscapes (a reasonable level of physical fitness and mobility is required and there are many steps, ascents and descents). At some times of the year, not all site trails are accessible. Attractions include a red brick tower, once lime washed and still called the White Tower, the Monument standing over high commemorating Sir Rowland Hill who was the first Protestant Mayor of London, the Cleft which is spanned by the Swiss Bridge, the Grotto which may have originated as a 5th-century copper mine and the Arch atop of Grotto Hill, plus various caves, tunnels through the rock, walkways, viewpoints and trails winding through Rhododendron plantations. The Park was used to represent parts of Narnia in the BBC's TV adaptation of C. S. Lewis's books for the battlegrounds in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in 1988 and Prince Caspian a year later. Hawkstone is currently combined with an adjacent hotel (formerly a lodge of the hall) marketed in association with the Principal Hayley Group, golf course. Hawkstone Hall, nearby, is a Catholic retreat, open to the public in August, courtesy of English Heritage roof repair funds.  History =Castle The site of the Red Castle is closed to the public as it is unsafe. It takes up the top of Red Castle Hill (the westerly outcropping hill of the park grounds), a crag overlooking the golf course and Weston to its South East. Red Castle, the first castle at Hawkstone Park, was built in 1227 by Henry de Audley (Alditheley), Sheriff of Shropshire and Staffordshire. This Norman enclosure castle was built of sandstone on a natural outcrop of rock, flanked on all sides by wide valleys. The castle has been known by various names: Red Castle; Rubree; Radeclif, Redcliffe, Redde, Castle Rous, and Hawkstone. About the same time (1227-1232) Henry also built Heighley Castle at Madeley, Staffordsire, and made it the family caput. Subsequent generations of Audleys were also known as, Lords of Heleigh Castle, and expanded from there. The \\"Red Castle\\", as it became known, was held by the family until the early 16th century initially as their main Shropshire stronghold. Repairs were undertaken in 1283. It was in use in 1322, but by around 1400 it seems no longer occupied. When Leland visited the castle in around 1540 he described it as ruinous. John Tuchet, 4th Baron Audley (1371‚Äì1408) inherited the title via his sister, then survived the uprising of Owain Glynd≈µr and the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403, where he fought against Henry \\"Hotspur\\" Percy. His son James Tuchet, 5th Baron Audley (1398‚Äì1459) was killed by Sir Roger Kynaston, whilst leading the House of Lancaster at the Battle of Blore Heath in 1459. The Audleys forfeited the title when James Tuchet, 7th Baron Audley (c. 1463‚Äì1497) led a rebellion against King Henry VII of England in 1497 and was executed. The Audley title was restored to John Tuchet, 8th Baron Audley in 1512. Manor house Hawkstone Hall The Hall stands on the site of an earlier Manor House. The manor was purchased, together with Soulton, by Sir Rowland Hill and Thomas Leigh from Thomas Lodge in 1556, under long leases (until 1610) for the quiet enjoyment by his brother Edward Lodge.The National Archives, Discovery Catalogue piece description 'Bargain and sale (1556)', 215/31 (Shropshire Archives). Eventually the lands passed via Sir Andrew Corbet of Moreton Corbet to Sir Rowland Hill, 1st Baronet Hill of Hawkstone (1705‚Äì1783), who lived nearby at Shelvock Manor. He was the great, great, great, grandson of Sir Rowland Hill, the first Protestant Lord Mayor of the City of London and Member of Parliament for the City of London in 1533, and who had owned Hawkstone and nearby Soulton. The manors of Hawkstone and Soulton were sold in 1556 by Thomas Lodge to Sir Rowland Hill and Thomas Leigh under long leases (until 1610) for quiet enjoyment by his brother Edward Lodge.The National Archives, Discovery Catalogue piece description 'Bargain and sale (1556)', 215/31 (Shropshire Archives). Hall Richard Hill (1655‚Äì1727), 'The Great Hill', traveller and diplomat, had made a fortune by 'lucrative arithmetick' (sic), raised the family into the aristocracy, and established the existing Hawkstone Manor House as the family seat, He started partial demolition of the house in 1701 replacing it with the Hall, completing it circa 1707. Sir Rowland Hill, 1st Baronet (1705‚Äì1783), landscaped the Red Castle and extended the estate, with walks over the four natural hills and a wide range of follies that included a hermit to dispense wisdom to visitors. Sir Richard Hill, 2nd Baronet (1733‚Äì1808) took over on his father‚Äôs death in 1783, published a guide for visitors and built the 'Hawkstone Inn' to accommodate them. He engaged landscape gardener William Emes to build a vast manmade lake, the Hawk River and his follies included a 'ruined' Gothic architecture Arch on Grotto Hill, the urn, a tribute to an English Civil War ancestor, the Swiss Bridge, and the obelisk with an internal staircase, topped by a statue of the original Sir Rowland Hill. Hawkstone Park had become one of Britain‚Äôs top attractions by the time he died in 1808. It maintained this status under his brother Sir John Hill, 3rd Baronet (1740‚Äì1824). The Citadel Sir Rowland Hill, 4th Baronet Hill of Hawkstone, 2nd Viscount Hill (1800‚Äì1875) inherited, spent and lost a large fortune. He created two new drives, one at vast expense through a rock cutting, and even considered completely relocating the hall across the park. In 1824-5 he built a dower house known as The Citadel in Gothic Revival style. His extravagance and bad management caused a descent into a mess that was inherited by his son in 1875. Rowland Clegg-Hill, the 3rd Viscount Hill (1833‚Äì1895) was bankrupt by the time of his death in 1895, forcing the sale of the contents of the hall and then the split up of the estate by 1906. The hall was purchased by George Whitely, later Baron Marchamley of Hawkstone, Liberal Whip. He had extensive restoration and reconstruction done by Wm. Tomkinson and Sons of Liverpool, managed by H.P. Dallow, which included shortening in length and reducing in elevation, the wings of the house. The chapel wing was reconstructed as a games room with a dance floor, and the other wing was converted to servants accommodation. The hall and lake became a religious retreat in the 1920s, while the hotel and a large part of the park later became a golf course. During World War II, parts of the park were used as a prisoner of war camp. Hawkstone Park is now largely restored, and once again open to the public. It is protected as a Grade I historic park, as rated by English Heritage. Dr. Johnson visited and wrote of... :\\"its prospects, the awfulness of its shades, the horrors of its precipices, the verdure of its hollows and the loftiness of its rocks ... above is inaccessible altitude, below is horrible profundity.\\" (1774). Erasmus Darwin also visited, and notes the outcrops of copper-bearing rocks... :\\"at Hawkstone in Shropshire, the seat of Sir Richard Hill, there is an elevated rock of siliceous sand which is coloured green with copper in many places high in the air.\\" (1783). Golf course Hawkstone Park has two 18-hole golf courses, set in and around the parkland. Sandy Lyle was tutored in golf by his father Alex, who was the resident golf professional at Hawkstone.

They are known for their athleticism, versatility and good disposition. The breed makes excellent show ponies. History A Connemara Pony has a short head. The Connemara region in County Galway in western Ireland, where the breed first became recognised as a distinct type, is a very harsh landscape, thus giving rise to a pony breed of hardy, strong individuals. Some believe that the Connemara developed from Scandinavian ponies that the Vikings first brought to Ireland. Another source was likely the Irish Hobby, a now-extinct breed established prior to the 13th century. Legend, however, says that galleons from the Spanish Armada ran aground in 1588, and the Andalusians on board were set loose. The Spanish horses bred with the native stock, refining the local ponies. For additional strength and stamina, Arabian blood was added in the 18th century. They were also crossed with Hackneys and Thoroughbreds. Too much crossbreeding began to dilute the pony bloodlines, so the Connemara Pony Breeders' Society, worked to preserve the breed type. The stud book was established in 1926. Today, Connemaras are bred worldwide in Ireland and Britain, as well as on the European continent, North America, Australasia, and South Africa. The Connemara Pony Breeders Society was established in 1923 and set out to ensure the \\"preservation and improvement of the Connemara Pony\\" as the native breed of Ireland.History - Welcome to Connemara Pony Breeders Society The society runs an annual pony show and has been doing so since its founding. The annual show allows the assembly of the largest collection of Connemara Ponies worldwide and is used to buy and sell ponies from Ireland and abroad.History - Welcome to Connemara Pony Breeders Society Characteristics Connemara stallion The original breed standard is set by the Connemara Pony Breeders' Society of Ireland, and also used by the British Connemara Pony Society. The adults are usually in height, with a strong back, loins, and hindquarters, deep and broad through the ribs, and with a riding-type well laid-back shoulder and well-placed neck without undue crest, giving a good length of rein. The head should be of pony type, broad between the eyes, which should be large and appear kind, and with a deep but refined jaw and clearly defined cheekbone. The ears should be of pony type (relatively short). The legs should be relatively short from the knees and hocks to the ground, with a strong, muscular upper leg, strong and well-defined knees and hocks, and well-shaped hard feet, which are of a medium size. The action should be free, active, and easy. Permitted colours are grey, black, brown, bay, dun,The dun gene does not exist within the Connemara population, so \\"dun\\" refers specifically to buckskin coloration on ponies, particularly in their native Ireland and in the UK roan, chestnut, palomino, and cream. Pinto colouring (piebald and skewbald) is not accepted. The Connemara Pony should be intelligent with a good temperament, suitable for adults and children; it should be hardy with good endurance; it should be sure-footed, sound, and able to jump. If a Connemara Pony is to be passed as grade 1 on inspection by the Connemara Pony Breeder's Society, it must meet the breed standard; if it does not meet this specification, then it will be given a grade 2 or 3 on inspection.

The building is Canada's oldest house of government. Standing three storeys tall, the structure is considered one of the finest examples of Palladian architecture in North America. History Governor's House, built 1749 on the site of Province House Site of First Legislative Assembly Plaque, Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society, Scotia Square, Halifax, Nova Scotia. Province House was built on the same location as the previous Governor's House, erected by Edward Cornwallis in 1749. (Cornwallis' table remains in the bedroom of Province House.) Province House was opened for the first time on February 11, 1819. One of the smallest functioning legislatures in North America, Province House originally housed the executive, legislative and judicial functions of the colony, all in one building.Nova Scotia House of Assembly, \\"Province House\\". Nova Scotia House of Assembly, 1997. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia held its sessions in Province House (in what is today the legislative library). Most notably, Joseph Howe, a journalist and later Premier of Nova Scotia, was put on trial on a charge of criminal libel on March 2, 1835, at Province House. Howe had published an anonymous letter accusing Halifax politicians and police of pocketing ¬£30,000 over a thirty-year period, and outraged civic politicians had subsequently seen to it that Howe was charged with seditious libel. The presiding judge called for Howe's conviction, but Howe's passionate speech in his own defence swayed the jury and the jurors acquitted him in what is considered a landmark case in the struggle for a free press in Canada.Kesterton, W. H. (1967) A History of Journalism in Canada. Toronto: McClelland and Stewart Limited, pp. 21‚Äì23. On January 20, 1842, English author Charles Dickens attended the opening of the Nova Scotia Legislature. He said that it was like looking at Westminster through the wrong end of a telescope. During 1848, Province House was the site for the first form of responsible government in the British Empire outside the United Kingdom. The building is located in downtown Halifax on a block bordered by Hollis, Granville, George and Prince streets. Led by the efforts of Joseph Howe, the Anti-Confederation Party won a resounding majority in the first election held after Nova Scotia joined the Confederation of Canada on July 1, 1867. Province House was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1996, in recognition of its status as the longest serving legislative building in Canada, and the role it played in the development of responsible government and freedom of the press in the country. It is also a Provincially Registered Property under provincial heritage legislation.  Legislative Assembly  Province House is the home of the House of Assembly, Nova Scotia's elected legislative assembly. In 1908 and 2008, there were significant official celebrations in Nova Scotia and Canada to mark the 150th and 250th anniversary of the birth of parliamentary democracy (i.e., representative government) in Canada, which started in Nova Scotia. The first event was marked by the creation of the Dingle Tower and the second by a year-long celebration the birth of parliamentary democracy in Canada. The celebration was entitled Democracy 250. On October 2, 1758, the Nova Scotia House of Assembly met for the first time in a modest wooden building at the corner of Argyle and Buckingham streets in Halifax. It was an assembly of twenty-two men, who came together to deliberate as a parliament on questions affecting the colony. With voting limited to Protestant, free-land holding males, it was a modest beginning, and their influence with the British-appointed Governor was questionable. It was the first elected assembly of its kind in what eventually became Canada. On January 31, 1837, Simon d'Entremont and Frederick A. Robicheau became the first Acadians elected to the House of Assembly (Joseph Winniett, whose mother was Acadian, was elected to the Assembly in 1761). (Two months later, on March 24, 1837, black men in Canada were given the right to vote.The Spirit of Democracy Black Cultural Centre of Nova Scotia. Retrieved October 17, 2010.) in 1893, Edith Archibald and others made the first official attempt to have a suffrage bill for women property holders passed in Nova Scotia, which was passed by the legislature but quashed by Attorney General James Wilberforce Longley (who opposed unions and female emancipation for the twenty years he was in office).Timeline of Women's History, Canada On April 26, 1918, as a result of the Local Council of Women of Halifax (LCWH), the House of Assembly passed The Nova Scotia Franchise Act, which gave women the right to vote in Nova Scotia's provincial elections, the first province to do so in Atlantic Canada. (A month later Nova Scotian and Prime Minister of Canada Robert Borden ‚Äì whose wife Laura Bond was former president of the LCWH ‚Äì used his majority to pass women's suffrage for the whole country.) Almost forty-three years later, on February 1, 1961, Gladys Porter was the first woman elected to the Assembly. In 1993, Wayne Adams is elected the first Black member of the Assembly. The Nova Scotia legislature was the third in Canada to pass human rights legislation (1963).

The first important trial in the court was against Richard John Uniacke Jr. for killing William Bowie in the last lethal duel in Nova Scotia (1819). The Supreme Court chamber was the site of Joseph Howe's 1835 trial for seditious libel. On March 2, 1835, newspaper editor Joseph Howe defended himself at trial in the present-day library for seditious libel by civic politicians in Nova Scotia. Many scholars consider Howe's success in this case a landmark event in the evolution of press freedom in Canada.Kesterton, pp. 21‚Äì23.  The Red Chamber  The Red Chamber was formerly the meeting place of the Nova Scotia Council and later the Legislative Council, the upper house of Nova Scotia's legislature.

The somewhat nonsensical Yiddish title is variously translated as Not Me, Not You, Not Cock-a-Doodle-Doo or Neither This, Nor That, nor Kukerikoo; Lulla Rosenfeld says it had an alternate title The Struggle of Culture with Fanaticism.

The plot centered on a cobbler who becomes a rabbi. Jacob Adler wrote of it that \\"this thin idea had been dressed out with so much stolen music that it was shameful to hear\\", but Lulla Rosenfeld, writing from a distance of over a century, argues that its combination of a \\"serious theme with an amusing nonsense plot\\" was emblematic of early Yiddish theater. \\"This emphasis on education, progress, enlightenment,\\" she writes, \\"is found nowhere else in the popular comedy and melodrama of the nineteenth century.

For professional matches a patch is usually worn on the left breast bearing the insignia of the organization sanctioning the fight. The referee may also wear a patch on his left sleeve bearing the flag of his home country. This is especially common in matches between fighters from two countries.

It was acquired by the German pharmaceutical company Merck in 2006. The company was founded as the Serono Pharmacological Institute by Cesare Serono in 1906 in Italy. A key step in its development was the discovery of a method of extracting urinary gonadotropins by Dr Piero Donini. Serono was incorporated in 1987 and the holding company, Ares-Serono S.A., changed its name to Serono S.A. in May 2000. Serono develops and markets pharmaceuticals in the fields of reproductive health, multiple sclerosis, growth & metabolism and dermatology. The eight biotechnology products are available in four core therapeutic areas: neurology for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, reproductive health for treatments of infertility, dermatology, where Serono has launched biologics in Europe for moderate-to-severe psoriasis, and growth and metabolism for treatments for HIV-associated wasting and growth deficiencies. The Company also conducts research in oncology and autoimmune diseases. Through the acquisition in 1997 of GBRI from GlaxoWelcome, becoming its Geneva based research institute named SPRI, and the Manteia Predictive Medicine spin-off, Serono also nursed the emergence of now a commercial leading massive parallel sequencing technology. Sale to Merck KGaA 36% of Serono was sold to Merck KGaA in Sept. 2006 for ‚Ç¨10,6 Billion; Merck KGaA paid CHF 1,100 for each share. The new entity, which merges Serono with Merck's Ethicals division, is called Merck Serono. Its headquarters was in Geneva, within the new Serono facilities. The US operations remain near Boston and was renamed here EMD Serono due to trademark issues with Merck & Co./MSD. The process of merging started in January 2007 after various business regulatory reviews and phases were complete. Until that time, Serono and Merck KGaA operated as separate entities. The new, combined entity, Merck Serono is the size of other large biotechs. In 2011, a decision was made to close the Geneva headquarters and move the headquarters to Darmstadt, Germany resulting in job losses to most of the employees in Geneva. Facilities Serono operated in 44 countries, with manufacturing facilities in eight countries and sales in over 90 countries. Main manufacturing sites were in Switzerland, Italy, Spain and France; a fifth facility in Israel was closed in 2004 owing to its obsolescence. Research and development facilities were maintained in Geneva, Switzerland, Boston, USA, and Ivrea, Italy. It employed over 4,750 people with worldwide revenues of USD 2,586.4 million (2005). It had eight biotechnology products on the market, and more than 25 ongoing preclinical and clinical development projects at the end of 2005. Serono Headquarters and the Geneva research site moved to a brand new campus (Horizon Secheron) in the heart of Geneva in 2006. This facility and the Headquarters were closed by Merck KGaA in 2013. The building was sold back to Berterelli family. Lawsuit In 2005, Serono agreed to a $704 million settlement with the Department of Justice to resolve civil and criminal allegations that the company engaged in a fraudulent scheme to promote the drug Serostim for off-label uses and paid out illegal kickbacks for prescribing the drug in violation of the False Claims Act.#05-545: 10-17-05 SERONO TO PAY $704 MILLION FOR THE ILLEGAL MARKETING OF AIDS DRUG The settlement is, to date, the ninth largest pharmaceutical settlement in U.S. history.

In Germany and Switzerland it is equivalent to a combined primary (Grundschule and Primarschule, respectively) and lower secondary education (Hauptschule or Sekundarschule), usually comprising a mandatory attendance over a period of nine years. In Austria, Volksschule solely is used for primary school from Year One to Year Four. In the Nordic countries they are referred to as Folkskolen and in Finnish, in a direct translation, as Kansakoulu; these schools covered the first years of primary education, from the ages of 7 to 11 or 12. History In medieval times, church schools were established in the Holy Roman Empire to educate the future members of the clergy, as stipulated by the 1215 Fourth Council of the Lateran, later adopted by the sunday schools of the Protestant Reformation. First secular schools followed during the pietism movement from the late 17th century onwards and were further promoted by the advocates of the Enlightenment. In 1717 King Frederick William I of Prussia decreed the compulsory education of children from the age of five to twelve. They had to be able to read and write and were obliged to memorise the Protestant catechism. In 1763 King Frederick the Great enacted a first Prussian general school law, elaborated by the theologian Johann Julius Hecker. Similar Volksschulen were established in the Electorate of Saxony and in the German-speaking parts of the Habsburg Monarchy, backed by Johann Ignaz von Felbiger, through a system of state-supported primary one-room schools. Attendance was supposedly compulsory, but a 1781 census reveals that only one fourth of school-age children attended. At the time, this was one of the few examples of state-supported schooling. Sending one's children to school was binding by law only from 1840 in the Austrian Empire.

Budgie worked with other musicians including John Cale, Leonard Eto (formerly of the Kodo Drummers) and John Grant. In 2013, Spin rated him at No. 28 in their list of \\"The 100 Greatest Drummers of Alternative Music\\", writing: \\"Post-punk introduced a lot of amazing drummers, but none more influential than Budgie.

It was conceived to commemorate the Canadian Centennial of 1967 and the Quebec Conference, 1864, one of the key meetings leading to the Canadian Confederation of 1867. Designed by Polish-Canadian architect Victor Prus, construction began in 1966 under Premier Jean Lesage but was stopped by the Union Nationale government of Daniel Johnson. Construction resumed in late 1967 but the theatre was not officially opened until January 16, 1971. The theatre has two venues: *Salle Louis Fr√©chette, with 1875 seats, is named after the 19th-century French-Canadian writer Louis-Honor√© Fr√©chette. *Salle Octave Cr√©mazie, with 506 seats, is named after the 19th-century Canadian poet, Octave Cr√©mazie, who was known as \\"the father of French-Canadian poetry\\". Since October 1972, the Conservatoire de musique du Qu√©bec √† Qu√©bec has been located in the Grand Th√©√¢tre's complex. In 1991, the theatre complex housed 49 classrooms, 70 teaching and practice studios, and a multi-media centre with a recording studio and electroacoustic lab. The complex is also home to a library which in 1991 included more than 60,000 documents of books, scores, monographs, periodicals, and recordings in various media formats. The theatre was used for the 1985 Shamrock Summit when Prime Minister Brian Mulroney entertained U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Organizations which use the theatre include the Orchestre symphonique de Qu√©bec, the Th√©√¢tre du Trident, and the Op√©ra de Qu√©bec.

ShawwƒÅl stems from the verb shƒÅla () to 'lift or carry', generally to take or move things from one place to another, so named because a female camel normally would be carrying a fetus at this time of year. Fasting during ShawwƒÅl The first day of ShawwƒÅl is Eid al-Fitr. Some Muslims observe six days of fasting during ShawwƒÅl beginning the day after Eid ul-Fitr since fasting is prohibited on this day. These six days of fasting together with the Ramadan fasts, are equivalent to fasting all year round. The reasoning behind this tradition is that a good deed in Islam is rewarded 10 times, hence fasting 30 days during Ramadan and 6 days during ShawwƒÅl is equivalent to fasting the whole year in fulfillment of the obligation. Islam online. The Shia scholars do not place any emphasis on the six days being consecutive while among the Sunnis the majority of Shafi\`i scholars consider it recommended to fast these days consecutively. They based this on a hadith related by Tabarani and others wherein Muhammad is reported to have said, \\"Fasting six consecutive days after Eid al-Fitr is like fasting the entire year.\\" Other traditional scholarly sources among the Hanafiyya and Hanbaliyya do not place an emphasis on consecutive days, while the strongest opinion of the Malikiyya prefers any six days of the month, consecutively or otherwise.

The land to the west is pre-illinoian, while the land to the east of this ridge is Illinoian glacial till. Geological investigation of wells drilled in Yarmouth led to the discovery of a paleosol on top of the pre-illinoian surface and buried under the terminal moraine.

The film consists of four stories in which human characters struggle to connect in a world of robot babies and android office workers. Plot The film is divided up to four short stories: My Robot Baby A young Marcia hides in the closet from her parents' fighting due to a mistake she has made. Marcia apologizes when her mother finds her in the closet; her mother tells Marcia to never fall in love, get married, and have children. Twenty-five years later, Marcia is married to Ray and they are looking towards adopting a child. After going to an adoption clinic, they apply for an adoption trial where they take care of a robotic baby before they can adopt a human child. Marcia begins to struggle when she is alone to take care of the robot baby, as she becomes flustered with what to do when the baby cries. Marcia brings the robot baby to her father, a handyman, and sees if he can tamper with the electronics of the robot. However, Marcia‚Äôs father worries that the doctors of the adoption clinic will detect the alteration of the robot. Nonetheless, Marcia persists on getting the baby reprogrammed and leaves the baby to her father while Marcia goes to work. As Marcia comes home to the robot baby now automated, she attempts to talk to the baby. However, the robot baby goes berserk and attacks Marcia. Marcia finds the robot baby in the closet, then remembers her young self hiding in the closet as her own mother was angry. Marcia then cries and is able to hug her robot baby, finding closure to her past. The Robot Fixer Bernice witnesses her son, Wilson, in a severe accident that left him in a coma. Upset, she heads to Wilson's apartment and cleans up the place with her daughter, Grace. Bernice finds Wilson's old toy robot collection and attempts to find the missing parts through yard sales and hobby shops. Throughout the search, Bernice remembers flashbacks of how little she really knows of Wilson, as the young Wilson would play with his robot toys and not hear Bernice's callings. As Bernice learns that Wilson will inevitably die, Bernice scrambles to find the last robot, specifically, a missing wing from the only \\"girl\\" robot her son's collection. (In a flashback, Bernice remembers carelessly vacuuming up the now missing wing). She finds the complete female robot shop at a local hobby shop, only to find it is not for sale, as it is very rare. In an act of desperation, she steals the wing, attaches it to Wilson's toy, and pretends to fly it through the air, perhaps as a way to accept that her son is now truly gone, and is making his way toward heaven. To apologize for the theft, she sends all of Wilson's toys to the shop/collector, but keeps the angel like female robot as a way to stay connected to her son, even thought she now finally accepts his death. Machine Love An office worker android, Archie, arrives at a workplace to do computer work. As he attempts to make acquaintance with people in the office workplace, he is rejected and shunned because he is a robot. Bob, the technician in charge of Archie, forgets to turn off Archie one night, letting him wander about the empty office complex after he finishes his work. He spots another office worker android across the street and stares at her all night. This becomes a reoccurring event for Archie, as Bob keeps forgetting to turn off Archie. As morning arrives, the workers are angry that Archie is not doing his work as he is low on power. Bob is then forced to turn Archie off, but Archie signals to Bob that he wants to meet the other office worker android across the street. As the two robots meet, they talk to each other and interact in a sexual manner. Clay John, an old sculptor, is told that he has only one year left to live. The doctors have recommended him to merge his consciousness into the digital world so he can live forever. He goes home and talks about his life expectancy to his wife (who has died in the past and is now a virtual hologram). The following day, John's son asks him to merge his consciousness in order for John to assist him, but John refuses as he wants to keep using his physical senses to make sculptures. John visits his wife in virtual space to ask her where she is, to which she responds multiple locations. John, unable to accept life after death through virtual reality, dies.

Themes=Authenticity as Ideology The characters in Robot Stories all have ideological developments, which they accept in some form. In Robot Baby, Marsha forgives herself from the past by accepting the robot baby as a child that she can care for. Her revelation that she is becoming what she feared from her past was the climax of her change, leading to her discovery of her true identity. In The Robot Fixer, Bernice notes how she never had a strong connection with her son due to their contrasting ideologies. It led her to rediscover who her son really is and to bring the relationship closer as her son nears death. Machine Love provides Archie a way to connect with others when others would not connect with him due to his ‚Äúrace‚Äù as a robot. By finding another robot working at a different corporation, Archie would finally be able to communicate without rejection. Clay allows John to decide the meaning of life in a world where consciousness can be permanently stored. As a sculptor, John is unable to cope with the fact that life without a physical body was not authentic life as the emotions of his wife have slowly become artificial to him while physical activities can no longer be a challenge. Hence, he finds that eternal consciousness is not worth living for. Reception The film received largely positive reviews and has a \\"certified fresh\\" score of 72% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 43 reviews with an average rating of 6.6 out of 10, the consensus being that \\"Although its 4 stories vary in quality, Robot Stories is still worth a look for Twilight Zone fans\\". Wesley Morris from The Boston Globe in his review said \\"In Robot Stories, technology hasn't colonized human life, it's finding ways to make living (and loving) better\\". The San Francisco Chronicle in their glowing review of the film said that \\"This is a science fiction film, but like all excellent movies in the genre, the focus never strays from the human heart.\\" The TV Guide review awarded it with 3 1/2 out of 4 stars and wrote that the film is \\"ostensibly about artificial life forms, each of these four short, expertly crafted stories offers a poignant perspective on what it means to be human.\\" The Christian Science Monitor's review of Robot Stories said that it was \\"Four stories with automatons as important characters...The last is the most touching, but all are skillfully made.\\" Robot Stories received much praise for both the direction of the film and the director Greg Pak's talent himself. Variety magazine said \\"Greg Pak understands the short form well, mercifully avoiding blatant O'Henry twists while pulling off neat reversals of expertly set-up genre expectations\\" and Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times wrote of Pak's directing in his review saying that \\" The most startling aspect of Robot Stories is not the mix that the director built from spare parts left on the curb but the evolving dramatic acumen of its maker; he's a talent with a future.\\" ReferencesExternal links   * Greg Pak's Pakbuzz.com * Greg Pak Interview with Asian Media Watchdog Category:2003 films Category:2003 independent films Category:2000s science fiction comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:American science fiction comedy-drama films Category:Japanese-American films Category:American anthology films Category:English-language films Category:Films shot in New York City Category:American independent films Category:American robot films Category:2003 comedy films Category:2003 drama films ","title":"Robot Stories"},{"id":"1511826","text":"Blind Shaft () is a 2003 film about a pair of brutal con artists operating in the illegal coal mines of present-day northern China. The film was written and directed by Li Yang (ÊùéÊù®), and is based on Chinese writer Liu Qingbang's short novel Shen Mu (Sacred Wood). Plot Most coal mines in China are worked by migrant workers who are forced to endure back-breaking, dangerous work in order to send money home. Some of them have additional schemes of their own. Song Jinming (played by Li Yixiang) and Tang Zhaoyang (Wang Shuangbao) are professional con artists, running an intricate scam they have perfected through repeated practice. They find a naive young man looking for work, and convince him that they have arranged three lucrative coal mining jobs for themselves and a relative. The relative has not arrived in time, leaving a gap which they generously offer to the victim, on the condition that he pretend to be the missing relative. After a few days of working in the mine, they murder the victim, and by making the murder look like an accident, they use his death to extort compensation money from the mine's management. After introducing the scam, the film follows the pair as they repeat it on a new victim, sixteen- year-old Yuan Fengming (played by Wang Baoqiang). Tensions arise as Song begins to have reservations, touched by the victim's youth and innocence and his uncanny resemblance to their first victim of the film, while Tang remains focused on making money for himself and his own family.

There are two basic types of repeal, a repeal with a re-enactment (or replacement) of the repealed law, or a repeal without any replacement. Removal of secondary legislation is normally referred to as revocation rather than repeal in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Under the common law of England and Wales, the effect of repealing a statute was \\"to obliterate it completely from the records of Parliament as though it had never been passed.\\"Kay v. Goodwin (1830) 6 Bing. 576, per Tindal C.J. This, however, is now subject to savings provisions within the Interpretation Act 1978. In parliamentary procedure, the motion to rescind, repeal, or annul is used to cancel or countermand an action or order previously adopted by the assembly. Partial or full repeals A partial repeal occurs when a specified part or provision of a previous Act is repealed but other provisions remain in force. For example, the Acts of Union 1800, providing for the union between the formerly separate kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland as the United Kingdom, was partially repealed in 1922, when (as a consequence of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty), twenty-six of the thirty-two counties of Ireland were constituted as the Irish Free State, and ceased to form part of the United Kingdom. A full repeal occurs where the entire Act in question is repealed. Repeal with or without re-enactment A typical situation where an Act is repealed and re-enacted is where the law in the area is being updated but the law being repealed needs to be replaced with one suitable for the modern era. Re-enactment can be with or without amendment, although repeal and re-enactment without amendment normally occurs only in the context of a consolidation bill (a bill to consolidate the law in a particular area). For example, the repeal of the Poor Laws in England in 1948 reflected their replacement by modern social welfare legislation. A repeal without replacement is generally done when a law is no longer effective, or it is shown that a law is having far more negative consequences than were originally envisioned. If a campaign for the repeal of a particular law gains particular momentum, an advocate of the repeal might become known as a \\"repealer\\". The Repeal Association in 19th-century Ireland advocated Irish independence through repeal of the Acts of Union 1800. Many repeals without replacement are the result of significant changes in society. Major examples include: *The old Jim Crow laws or blue laws in the US *The Corn Laws in England, repealed in 1846 after a passionate campaign. *Repeal of Prohibition in the United States. Enacted by the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, prohibition of alcoholic beverages proved to be so ineffective that it had to be repealed by the Twenty-first Amendment. This is the only constitutional amendment to have ever been repealed in the United States. *The massive Statute Law Revision Act 2007 in the Republic of Ireland, through which 3,225 Acts were repealed, dating back over eight centuries to 1171 and the earliest laws enacted by England when it began its invasion of Ireland. The statutes repealed include a number of Acts of significant historical interest, including an Act of 1542 providing that the Kings of England shall be Kings of Ireland. This Act is the largest single repealing statute in the history of Ireland. Express or implied repeal The repeal of a statute may be either express or implied.Vauxhall Estates, Ltd. v. Liverpool Corporation [1932] 1 KB 733 Express repeal occurs where express words are used in a statute to repeal an earlier statute. They are now usually included in a table in a schedule to the statute, for reasons of convenience. In the United States, when a bill is passed by the House and Senate and signed by the president, or Congress overrides a presidential veto, the various provisions contained within the newly enacted law are rearranged according to their policy content and cataloged in the United States Code‚Äîa compilation of the general and permanent federal laws of the United States. To repeal any element of an enacted law, Congress must pass a new law containing repeal language and the codified statute's location in the U.S. Code (including the title, chapter, part, section, paragraph and clause). In this way, Congress (and the president) must follow the same rules and procedures for passing any law. When statutes are repealed, their text is simply deleted from the Code and replaced by a note summarizing what used to be there. Once deleted, the repealed statute no longer has the force of law. All repeals of parts of the US Code are, therefore, express repeals. Implied repeal occurs where two statutes are mutually inconsistent. The effect is that the later statute repeals the earlier statute pro tanto (in so far as it is inconsistent). As past and future parliaments are equally sovereign, later parliaments can carry out implied repeal of earlier statute by passing an inconsistent statute, but inconsistency needs to be established before implied repeal can occur.Ellen Street Estates v. Minister of Health [1934] 1 KB 590 Repeals with or without savings Repeals can be with or without savings. A repeal without savings eliminates the repealed statute completely. A repeal with savings preserves the effect of the repealed statute for limited purposes, such as acts already done or in hand, or regulations made under the repealed Act are continued in force. In England and Wales, sections 15 to 17, and section 19(2), of the Interpretation Act 1978 set out general savings and similar provisions exist in the law of Ireland and other common law countries.  Parliamentary procedure =Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR) In meetings of a deliberative assembly, the motions to rescind (or \\"repeal\\" or \\"annul\\") and amend something previously adopted are used to change action that was taken. They are two forms of the same incidental main motion and they follow the same rules. A motion to postpone an event or action previously scheduled is a particular case of the motion to amend something previously adopted. Under Robert's Rules of Order, the rules for this motion protect against instability arising from small variations in attendance from one meeting to the next. For this reason, the requirements for changing a previous action are greater than those for taking the action in the first place. A motion to rescind, repeal, annul or amend something already adopted requires a two-thirds vote, a majority vote with previous notice, or a vote of a majority of the entire membership, any one of which would suffice. Demeter's Manual imposes a similar requirement. When this motion is used in a committee, RONR requires a two- thirds vote unless all committee members who voted for the motion to be rescinded or amended are present or have received ample notice; in which case a majority vote is required. The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure (TSC) Under The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure, a repeal or amendment of something already adopted requires only the same vote (usually a majority) and notice that was needed to adopt it in the first place. (TSC) This book states, \\"As a general rule, fewer than a majority should not be authorized to decide anything, and more than a majority should not be required for most decisions\\"; the book further states that the problem with situations in which a supermajority is required is that \\"the minority, not the majority, controls.\\"TSC, p. 130 Legislative use In legislative bodies, the motion to rescind is used for much the same purpose as the motion to reconsider; many court decisions treat the two motions as one motion. However, in legislative contexts, it is not the same as a motion to repeal. The difference between rescind and reconsider is that the motion to rescind is ordinarily applied to actions that have been taken and are already in effect. It has been described as being in the nature of a motion to amend by striking out the entire proposal and leaving nothing remaining. It is not in order when the question can be reached by a motion to reconsider. Once legislation has been actually enacted, it is too late to rescind. The vote required to rescind is the same as would be required to repeal the act which it sought to rescind (usually a majority).  Rescind and expunge from the minutes  The motion to rescind and expunge from the minutes is used to express the strongest disapproval about action previously taken by a deliberative assembly. Using Roberts Rules of Order Newly Revised, this motion requires a vote of a majority of the entire membership. Using The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure, the motion to expunge requires a majority vote (of those voting). The secretary does not erase the expunged motion, but draws a line around it, marks it \\"expunged by order of this assembly,\\" gives the date of the expunging, and signs the notation. The expunged motion is not included in any minutes published thereafter.

The Flyer is a Romanian folklore roving spirit who makes love to maidens by night. He is sometimes called zmeu, another dragon-like creature, with more human-like aspects. It has a tail of fire and is a wolf-headed dragon. The \\"zburƒÉtor\\" or \\"sburƒÉtor\\" can also refer to a demon that takes the shape of a young handsome man, visiting women in their sleep, like the incubus. Dimitrie Cantemir wrote about the myth concerning it in Descriptio Moldaviae (1714‚Äì1716). The \\"zburator\\" appears as \\"a ghost, a young, handsome man who comes in the middle of the night at women, especially recently married ones and does indecent things with them, although he cannot be seen by other people, not even by the ones who waylay him\\".

Plot Teenager Angela (Chlo√© Winkel), who is skilled at drawing, meets and falls in love with an attractive Japanese DJ. Encouraged by him, she goes to Japan to work at an exclusive club for rich businessmen, who like to meet with young blonde women. From the start, the film is surreal with unique characters, clear and sharp cinematography, and slow panning camera work. Manga drawings are also used to enhance the plot and ambiance. Angela seeks work at the aforementioned club and, after having been begrudgingly let in, she is met with derision by the other girls working there. However, despite having spurned some of the other girls, she soon proves to be a favorite among the patrons by pretending to be a Lolita-style 15-year-old to please the businessmen. The plot has a sinister undertone of the possibility of murder of a girl, Larissa, whom Angela has replaced. As the film goes on, we learn Larissa was possibly murdered, not by Japanese men in search of sick sexual fantasy fulfillment, but at the envious and jealous hands of her workmates. In the last scenes we learn Larissa lives and, furthermore, this is when Angela is heralded with the contract to be a Manga artist.

During the day it was operated by Bates broadcasting students studying under former KJR DJ Lee Perkins. It was powered at 3,500 watts, enough to cover Tacoma and adjacent communities but not the larger Seattle radio market. From 1978 to 1984, KTOY aired educational programs during the day, with Top 40 hits in the afternoon and evening. Starting at midnight on Friday and lasting until 6:00 p.m. Sunday, KTOY broadcast hip hop music and urban contemporary under the slogan \\"Giving You The Music of Tomorrow, Today.\\" During 1983-1984, the late night hip-hop program's slogan was \\"R&B;'s best in the Pacific Northwest.\\" By 1985, the urban format was no longer the entire weekend.

The 122nd episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 17, 2004. In the episode, the boys produce their own morning news show on the school's closed-circuit television station and are immediately caught up in an intense competition for ratings. Plot Stan, Cartman, Kyle, Butters, Jimmy and Token are taping \\"Super School News\\", a newscast airing on South Park Elementary's closed-circuit television system. Cartman and Jimmy play the leading roles as head anchors, Butters is the entertainment and celebrity reporter, Stan is a field reporter, Token is the meteorologist, and Kyle does sports. However, after their news program airs, their teacher Mr. Meryl tells them that they did horribly in the ratings, trailing far behind Craig's home video show, \\"Animals Close-Up With a Wide-Angle Lens\\", which they consider pointless and banal. (The footage is accompanied by the tune Yakety Sax.) The news team then pledges to make a program that will be a ratings booster and gain the attention of all students. They rename the show \\"Sexy Action School News\\" and add flashy elements (in a parody of various infotainment shows), including random \\"Panda Madness Minutes\\" in which the newscasters spontaneously dance with pandas. However, nothing seems to work; although they beat Craig's original series, they fall far behind his new show, \\"Animals Close-Up With a Wide-Angle Lens Wearing Hats\\". To get ideas, the boys decide to get high on cough medicine. They begin to experience weird hallucinations and start wandering through South Park behaving strangely. They eventually retire to their ideas room, and watch Craig's show with stoned expressions, and find it awesome. When they come around, their notepads contain nothing useful. Then Stan realizes that the video they were watching all night while under the influence of cough medicine‚Äîand concluded was the 'greatest show ever'‚Äîwas Craig's show. They realize that Craig's show gets such good ratings because most of the school must be high on cough medicine. They then decide to produce a special report that gets cough medicine banned from school. Soon after, the ratings drop and Craig's show is cancelled, as the children are no longer high and therefore no longer enjoy the show. To emphasize the importance of good ratings, the AV teacher then suspends Craig from school and requests the removal of his testicles. Satisfied with their results, the \\"Sexy Action School News\\" team discovers the curse of a successful show: each subsequent episode has to be just as good. Back in the writer's room, they come up with nothing and eventually decide to just \\"bail\\". Production With the 2008 DVD release of the eighth season, many of the audio commentaries revealed that much of the lack of ideas was because Team America: World Police, Trey Parker and Matt Stone's concurrent film, had just been through a long, grueling post-production which left the staff low on energy: Home release \\"Quest for Ratings\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Parks eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 29, 2006.

Following his death, he was succeeded in his position at the FTUWKC by his younger brother Chea Mony. Vichea was shot in the head and chest early in the morning while reading a newspaper at a kiosk in Daun Penh district, Phnom Penh. He had recently been dismissed by the INSM Garment Factory (located in the Chum Chao District of Phnom Penh) as a reprisal for helping to establish a trade union at the company. He also had close affiliations with the opposition Sam Rainsy Party. Investigation Chea Vichea's monument in Phnom Penh, Sihanouk Blvd, statue A few days after Vichea's killing, and facing mounting criticism for their failure to act, Cambodian authorities arrested two men and charged them with the murder. The first, Born Samnang, was arrested in Prey Veng Province and transferred to Phnom Penh overnight. He initially admitted to the killing but then publicly retracted, claiming to have been tortured into confessing. Multiple eyewitnesses have placed Born Samnang in a different part of the country at the time of the murder. The second suspect, Sok Sam Oeun, has consistently denied any involvement and also has alibis placing him in a party with friends at the time of the murder. The criminal investigation was done by Phnom Penh's Tuol Kork district police and plagued by irregularities. Officers focused on threatening and rounding up those who provided alibis for the suspects, while witnesses were intimidated.' On 22 March 2004, the case's Investigating Judge, Hing Thirith, threw out the charges against the two men, citing a lack of evidence against them and weak credibility of the police investigation . The next day, Hing Thirith was removed from his position at the Phnom Penh Municipal Court, and his decision to drop charges was subsequently overturned on 1 June 2004 by the Appeals Court Presiding Judge Thou Mony . The trial took place more than a year after the murder while Born Samnang and Sok Sam Oeun remained in custody in Phnom Penh, despite a Cambodian legal limitation that no one be detained without trial for longer than six months. The case has been taken up by both national and international organisations, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and ILO. Trial opposition. On 1 August 2005, the Phnom Penh Municipal Courts delivered a judgment which was highly criticized by both local and international organizations, who deemed it unfair and politically biased rather than based on independent and reasonable judgment. Sok Sam Oeun and Born Samnang were judged guilty after a trial where no witnesses testified against the accused and no forensic evidence was brought to court. Both individuals were sentenced to 20 years in prison and ordered to pay $5,000 compensation each to the family of the victim. Chea Vichea's family turned down the compensation, stating that they did not believe the two convicted were the real murderers.

The building is located at the intersection of Richmond and Great George Streets in Charlottetown; it is Canada's second-oldest seat of government.  History  The cornerstone was laid in May 1843 and it commenced operation for the first time in January 1847. The entire structure was built for a cost of ¬£10,000 and was designed by Isaac Smith. Smith was a self-trained architect from Yorkshire, who also designed the residence of the Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island. It was built by Island craftsmen during a time of prosperity for the colony. Its architectural lines include Greek and Roman influences, common to public buildings in North America built during this era. From September 1‚Äì7, 1864, Province House had an important role in helping Prince Edward Island host the Charlottetown Conference which resulted in Canadian Confederation. In 1973, Parks Canada approached the government of Prince Edward Island with a proposal for joint management and restoration of the structure in recognition of its important role in Canadian history. Under the ensuing agreement, both parties agreed to a 99-year period of joint management. Parks Canada paid for a $3.5 million (CAD) restoration from 1979‚Äì1983 which involved part of the building being restored to the 1864 period. The provincial legislature occupies one end of the building, whereas the restored Confederation Chamber displays the room where the Charlottetown Conference meetings occurred. Confederation Chamber within Province House, August 2011 On April 20, 1995, a powerful pipe bomb exploded beneath a wooden wheelchair ramp on the north side of Province House, destroying glass in windows and causing some minor structural damage. Several passersby were injured and the explosion occurred only five minutes after an entire class of school children on a tour of the building had passed through the area. The bombing occurred only one day after the Oklahoma City bombing and is considered to be a copycat action. Responsibility was claimed by a group calling itself Loki 7; however, a subsequent police investigation and criminal court case blamed a single individual, Roger Charles Bell. In 2015, Province House was closed for repairs and conservation work. The legislature moved to the adjacent Hon. George Coles Building, where it is expected to remain for several years. Province House National Historic Site Province House was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1973. It is one of only three provincial legislative buildings, along with Province House in Halifax and the Saskatchewan Legislative Building in Regina, to be so designated. Province House is also designated under the provincial Heritage Places Protection Act. Visitors can tour the 1860s period rooms, which include displays about the Charlottetown Conference, the building and the Provincial Legislative Assembly. An audio-visual presentation about the Conference is available, titled \\"A Great Dream\\". Monuments and memorials In front of the Legislature on Grafton Street is the Charlottetown Veterans Memorial consisting of three soldiers. The bronze memorial by G. W. Hill commemorates the dead from the two World Wars and the Korean War. A Boer War Memorial by Hamilton MacCarthy was erected to honour the members of the Royal Canadian Regiment on the side of legislature.

His father attained the grade of major in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War and his grandfather, James Lovell, was an active member of the Whig organization in Boston before the Revolution, and was a member of the Continental Congress from 1777 to 1782. He was one of the prime movers in the scheme to supplant General Washington as commander-in-chief by General Horatio Gates. He was an original member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati. Life Lovell obtained his early education in the Boston schools, after which he entered Harvard College, where he graduated in 1807. He began the study of medicine with Dr. William Ingalls of Boston and graduated from the Harvard Medical School in 1811, with the first class to receive the degree of M. D. With the practical certainty of a second war with Britain, Congress passed an act on January 11, 1812 (2 Stat. 671), increasing by thirteen regiments the military forces of the country, and providing a surgeon and two surgeon's mates for each regiment. On May 15, 1812, Lovell was appointed major and surgeon, 9th US Infantry Regiment. With an unusually thorough medical education, he early became an outstanding medical officer. When, late in 1812, the troops were moved to the Canada‚ÄìUS border, general hospitals were established at Plattsburgh, New York, and at Burlington, Vermont, Lovell was detached from his infantry regiment and placed in command of the Burlington Hospital. During this time, while the hospitals as a whole came under severe criticism the Burlington Hospital was held up as a model of what a hospital should be. Lovell attracted attention not only as a skilled practitioner but as an officer of marked executive ability. In recognition of his exceptional service he was selected for appointment to the grade of hospital surgeon on June 30, 1814. During the latter part of the war his longest service was in the hospital at Williamsville, New York, which received the casualties for the operations along the Niagara River. In 1817, Lovell, then chief medical officer of the Northern Department, addressed to Major General Jacob Brown, the department commander, a letter dealing with the Sick Report of the Northern Division for the Year ending June 30, 1817, in which he discussed not only the cause of disease in the army, but also gave his views upon the duties of medical officers and their responsibility for the sickness occurring among the troops. Army reorganization During the winter and spring of 1818, Congress was engaged on a bill for the reorganization of the staff of the army. This bill, passed April 14, 1818 (3 Stat. 426), repealed certain previous legislation in regard to the medical department and carried the following section: :Section 2. And be it further enacted, That there shall be one Surgeon General, with a salary of two thousand five hundred dollars per annum, one assistant surgeon general with the emoluments of a hospital surgeon  and that the number of post surgeons be increased not to exceed eight to each division. Pursuant to this legislation, Lovell was appointed Surgeon General to date from April 18, 1818, with Hospital Surgeons Tobias Watkins and James C. Bronaugh, assistants, one for each of the two divisions of the army. Apothecary General Le Barron was retained in his old position. Though only in his thirtieth year, his services in the hospitals on the northern frontier during the war and his appreciation of the needs of the service as evidenced by his reports made Lovell the logical choice for head of the service. Thus was established for the first time a permanent medical department organization. For the first time a career medical officer was made chief of the service. All of the former chiefs had been appointed to meet the emergency of war, real or expected, with an organization to serve the forces in the field. Again, for the first time was bestowed upon the service chief the title of surgeon general, which has survived to the present day. Immediately following Lovell's appointment the following order was issued by the War Department: :All reports, returns and communications connected with the Medical Department will hereafter be made to the Surgeon General's Office in Washington. :All orders and instructions relative to the duties of the several officers of the Medical Staff, will be issued through the Surgeon General, who will be obeyed and respected accordingly. :The Assistant Surgeon Generals will forthwith commence the inspections of the Medical Department in their respective divisions agreeably to the instructions they receive from the Surgeon General. Lovell saw as an early duty the revision of the Medical Regulations. The regulations of December 1814 had been superseded by those of April 24, 1816, but these were defective in that they were not adapted to the new organization or to the provisions of the order quoted above. The result was the Regulations of the Medical Department, September 1818. In his first report to Secretary of War Calhoun in November 1818, he dwelt upon the difficulty of obtaining from medical officers compliance with orders, particularly in regard to reports and returns. In reply the Secretary called upon him for recommendations for the improvement of the medical service. Lovell began his recommendations with the statement that the first requisite was to make the position of a medical officer such that he would place some value upon the retention of his office, at that time held in low esteem. Recruitment of officer personnel was difficult and the retention of suitable men even more so. He asked an increase in the number of medical officers and an increase in their pay and allowances. With officers with a sense of responsibility he promised appreciable economies in medical supplies. He recommended further that the Apothecary General be authorized to make all purchases of medical supplies and that purchasing officers be bonded for the proper application of public funds. Though no immediate legislation ensued, the changes advocated were all brought about during Lovell's term of office. On March 2, 1821 (3 Stat. 615), Congress passed an act reducing the army and reorganizing the staff corps. Section 10 defined the future medical staff as follows: :And be it further enacted, That the medical department shall consist of one surgeon general, eight surgeons with the compensation of regimental surgeons and forty-five assistant surgeons with the compensation of post surgeons. Thus was abolished the old system of titles which had stood since the Revolution, with the substitution of a new system which was to last for nearly ninety years, though military rank and titles came in 1847. This reorganization brought about the discharge of the Apothecary General and his assistants. In 1825 a new edition of the Medical Regulations was issued. It was essentially the same as that of 1818, except as to phraseology to conform to the new designations of the medical officers. The office of Assistant Surgeon General was changed to that of Medical Director of Department and the duties of the Apothecary General and his assistants were assigned to officers detailed to the purveying department. An important addition was a paragraph calling for the examination by a board of three medical officers of all applicants for the position of assistant surgeon. This provision was not put into effect until after the issue by the War Department of General Orders, No. 58, July 7, 1832, which defined the requisites for appointment. Thus was initiated the foremost factor in the high professional standing of the corps to the present day. An act of Congress of June 30, 1834 (4 Stat. 714), confirmed the provisions for entrance examinations and fixed the pay and allowances of medical officers relative to those of other officers of the service. A dangerous crisis developed in 1830, when, in the midst of agitation for retrenchments, Secretary of War Eaton suggested the abolition of the office of Surgeon General. In a letter to Congress in support of his administration, Lovell was so far successful that he not only saved his own office but obtained an increase in the number of officers in the corps. Societies During the 1820s, Lovell was a member of the prestigious society, Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, who counted among their members former presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams and many prominent men of the day, including well-known representatives of the military, government service, medical and other professions. Black Hawk War During Lovell's term of office occurred the Black Hawk War and the beginning of the long continued struggle with the Seminoles of Florida. In 1832, incident to the trouble with the Sacs and Foxes in Illinois and Wisconsin, troops were sent to that section by way of Buffalo and the Great Lakes. Cholera broke out on two boats en route from Buffalo to Chicago. The troops were debarked in the vicinity of Detroit and put into camp. Nearly four hundred cases developed with eighty-eight deaths. The Seminole War began on December 28, 1835, when the Indians, under Osceola, ambushed and destroyed two companies of the 4th Infantry under command of Major Dade. The anxieties incident to furnishing medical service for the troops collecting for the punitive campaign weighed heavily upon Lovell. He established a medical supply depot at Tampa and a general hospital at St. Augustine. He asked for an increase of medical officers and a small addition was authorized on July 4, 1835. The report of June 4 with its request for additional officers was his last important act. Death His wife, to whom he was deeply attached, died about this time and the double burden of anxieties was too much for an always delicate constitution. He died in Washington on October 17, 1836, near the end of his forty-eighth year. Lovell's death, preceded by a few months by that of his wife, Margaret Mansfield Lovell, left an orphaned family of eleven children. A son, Mansfield Lovell, graduated from West Point and became a major general and corps commander in the Confederate army during the Civil War. Service as Surgeon General Less than thirty years of age and with but six years of service when he became Surgeon General, Lovell's eighteen years' tenure of office were marked by constant improvement in the efficiency of the service and in the status of the officers of the corps. With a wholesome pride in his office and in the service which he represented, he strove to foster that same pride throughout the corps and to render the military establishment conscious of its obligations to the medical service. Quite beyond the medical department he rendered conspicuous service to every branch and department of the army. More than any other person he was responsible for the abolition of the whiskey ration which was making drunkards throughout the army. He was largely instrumental in the passage by Congress of a bill by which unsuitable and inefficient officers could be eliminated from the army by action of a board of officers. From his personal observations he was able to make recommendations which brought about notable improvements in the ration and clothing of the soldier. One of his first acts as Surgeon General was to require from all army posts quarterly reports by the medical officers on weather conditions and on the incidence and causes of diseases. The compilations of these reports have high historic value. The weather reports thus begun were the beginning of the present Weather Bureau. A notable service by Lovell was the encouragement and official assistance which he gave to Surgeon William Beaumont in the study of gastric physiology. Lovell's office began the collection of medical literature which was to become the Library of the Surgeon General's Office, later called the Army Medical Library, the Armed Forces Medical Library, and finally transformed in 1956 into the National Library of Medicine. In 1842, the officers of the medical corps testified to their appreciation of Lovell's services to them and to their personal esteem for him by the erection of a handsome monument over his grave in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington. Legacy During the American Civil War Lovell General Hospital in Portsmouth, Rhode Island was named after him. Lovell General Hospital at Fort Devens, Massachusetts was also named after him.

Fannie Merritt Farmer (23 March 1857 ‚Äì 16 January 1915) was an American/Canadian culinary expert whose Boston Cooking-School Cook Book became a widely used culinary text. Education Fannie Farmer was born on 23 March 1857 in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, to Mary Watson Merritt and John Franklin Farmer, an editor and printer. Although she was the oldest of four daughters, born in a family that highly valued education and that expected young Fannie to go to college, she suffered a paralytic stroke at the age of 16 while attending Medford High School. Fannie could not continue her formal academic education; for several years, she was unable to walk and remained in her parents' care at home. During this time, Farmer took up cooking, eventually turning her mother's home into a boarding house that developed a reputation for the quality of the meals it served. At the age of 30, Farmer, now walking (but with a substantial limp that never left her), enrolled in the Boston Cooking School at the suggestion of Mrs. Charles Shaw. Farmer trained at the school until 1889 during the height of the domestic science movement, learning what were then considered the most critical elements of the science, including nutrition and diet for the well, convalescent cookery, techniques of cleaning and sanitation, chemical analysis of food, techniques of cooking and baking, and household management. Farmer was considered one of the school's top students. She was then kept on as assistant to the director. In 1891, she took the position of school principal.  Cookbook fame  Fannie published her best-known work, The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book, in 1896. Her cookbook introduced the concept of using standardized measuring spoons and cups, as well as level measurement. A follow-up to an earlier version called Mrs. Lincoln's Boston Cook Book, published by Mary J. Lincoln in 1884, the book under Farmer's direction eventually contained 1,850 recipes, from milk toast to Zigaras √† la Russe. Farmer also included essays on housekeeping, cleaning, canning and drying fruits and vegetables, and nutritional information. The book's publisher (Little, Brown & Company) did not predict good sales and limited the first edition to 3,000 copies, published at the author's expense. The book was so popular in America, so thorough, and so comprehensive that cooks would refer to later editions simply as the Fannie Farmer Cookbook, and it is still available in print over 100 years later. Farmer provided scientific explanations of the chemical processes that occur in food during cooking, and also helped to standardize the system of measurements used in cooking in the USA. Before the Cookbook's publication, other American recipes frequently called for amounts such as \\"a piece of butter the size of an egg\\" or \\"a teacup of milk.\\" Farmer's systematic discussion of measurement ‚Äî\\"A cupful is measured level ... A tablespoonful is measured level. A teaspoonful is measured level.‚Äîled to her being named \\"the mother of level measurements.\\" Farmer left the Boston Cooking School in 1902 and created Miss Farmer's School of Cookery. She began by teaching gentlewomen and housewives the rudiments of plain and fancy cooking, but her interests eventually led her to develop a complete work of diet and nutrition for the ill, titled Food and Cookery for the Sick and Convalescent which contained thirty pages on diabetes. Farmer was invited to lecture at Harvard Medical School and began teaching convalescent diet and nutrition to doctors and nurses. She felt so strongly about the significance of proper food for the sick that she believed she would be remembered chiefly by her work in that field, as opposed to her work in household and fancy cookery. Farmer understood perhaps better than anyone else at the time the value of appearance, taste, and presentation of sickroom food to ill and wasted people with poor appetites; she ranked these qualities over cost and nutritional value in importance. Later life During the last seven years of her life, Farmer used a wheelchair. Despite her immobility, Farmer continued to lecture, write, and invent recipes; she gave her last lecture 10 days before her death. The Boston Evening Transcript published her lectures, which were picked up by newspapers nationwide. Farmer also lectured to nurses and dietitians, and taught a course on dietary preparation at Harvard Medical School. To many chefs and good home cooks in America, her name remains synonymous today with precision, organization, and good food. In 1915, age 57, Fannie Farmer died of complications of a stroke, and was interred in Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 2018, The New York Times published a belated obituary for her.

Dynaflow was the trademarked name for a type of automatic transmission developed and built by General Motors Buick Motor Division from late 1947 to mid-1963. The Dynaflow, which was introduced for the 1948 model year only as an option on Roadmaster models, received some severe early testing in the M18 Hellcat tank destroyer, which were built in Buick's Flint, Michigan assembly plant during World War II. It was also used in the 1951 Le Sabre concept car.Flory, J. \\"Kelly\\", Jr. American Cars 1946-1959 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2008), p.1021. History=Original version The Dynaflow was an automatic transmission used in various forms in Buick cars by the General Motors Corporation from 1947 until 1963. The transmission initially used a five-element torque converter, with two turbines and two stators, as well as a planetary gearset that provided two forward speeds plus reverse. In normal driving, Dynaflow started in high gear (direct drive), relying on the converter's 3.1:1 torque multiplication, Ref. 1963 Buick Service Manual to accelerate the vehicle. Low gear, obtained via the planetary gearset, could be manually engaged and held up to approximately , improving acceleration. The transmission was incapable of automatic shifting, requiring the driver to move the shift lever from low to drive to cause an upshift. Buicks equipped with the Dynaflow transmissions were unique among American automobiles of the time in that the driver or their passengers would not detect the tell-tale interruption in acceleration that resulted when other automatic transmissions of the time shifted through their gears. Acceleration through a Dynaflow was one smooth (if inefficient and slow) experience. It was because of this slow acceleration that the Dynaflow transmission was nicknamed \\"Dynaslush.\\" The Dynaflow was an inherently inefficient design due to its sole reliance on the torque converter in normal driving. Exacerbating the situation was the dual stator arrangement, which wasted more power than the simpler three element converters used with other automatic transmissions, such as Chrysler's TorqueFlite. The multiple stators increased turbulence in the converter, even when operating in the coupling phase. Design rationale During the Dynaflow era, many of Buick's unique engineering features ranked smoothness above most other design and marketing objectives. Dynaflow's non- shifting design was demonstrably smoother than the rough shifting automatics then available. Moreover, Buick's torque tube \\"live axle\\" rear suspension design, which incorporated a rigid drive shaft with just one single universal joint (\\"U-joint\\") at the front end of the driveshaft, was said to amplify the harshness of contemporary automatic shifting transmissions. Dynaflow's non- shifting design addressed this characteristic of Buick's driveline. Torque tube rear suspension was a simple design that enabled Buick to use soft coil springs while its competitors, including its corporate cousins, used harsher, firmer leaf spring, Hotchkiss drive rear suspension. Dynaflow's smooth but inefficient five element torque converter which fed power through a non- shifting direct drive (plus one manually selectable \\"Low gear\\" of 1.8:1) was the conceptual polar opposite from the Hydra-Matic used by its sister GM divisions Oldsmobile, Cadillac and then Pontiac. The contemporary Hydra-Matic, the world's first large scale successful automatic transmission, used a simple two element fluid coupling ‚Äî a more efficient device than a torque converter but which provided no torque multiplication ‚Äî to feed power to its fully automatic four speed planetary gearbox. Hydra-Matic's high number of gear ratios for the day compensated lack of a torque converter by including an exceptionally low first gear of 4:1. Other contemporary automatics followed the middle ground by using two or three automatic shifting gear ratios along with a relatively simple three element torque converter. Three element torque converters continue to be the norm ‚Äî albeit \\"tighter\\", more efficient and less torque multiplying torque converters ‚Äî even as the number of discrete gear ratios in modern 21st Century automatics continues to increase to as many as ten. The Dynaflow's gearbox section was derived from Chevrolet‚Äôs Powerglide, a two speed fully automatic planetary transmission incorporating a conventional three element torque converter. Two speed automatics with three element torque converters were common for lower priced cars of the day and in the Chrysler PowerFlite as used in the entire Chrysler Corporation lineup through 1956. Performance Dynaflow‚Äôs inefficiency earned Buick a reputation as a ‚Äúgas hog‚Äù even when compared to heavy, powerful luxury cars of the 1950s and early 1960s. But at the time, gasoline was cheap and Buicks were upscale cars, so the \\"gas hog\\" reputation was not a serious sales deterrent. Manually \\"downshifting\\" from the direct drive ‚ÄúDrive range‚Äù to the 1.8:1 ‚ÄúLow range‚Äù enabled Buick's ‚Äútorque monster‚Äù engines to provide very good acceleration, though frequent ‚Äúdownshifting‚Äù took a serious toll on transmission reliability. Arguably, a Buick ‚Äúfamily car‚Äù wouldn't fare well during the teenage son's weekly ‚Äúdate night Friday‚Äù outings. Engine RPM seemed to be more a function of accelerator pedal position than of actual road speed. \\"Flooring\\" the accelerator pedal would cause the engine speed to flare (even though there is no automatic downshift and no torque converter lockup to disengage). As the car would accelerate, RPM would further climb, but by a disproportionately smaller amount. Even more strangely, manually downshifting (see above) with the gas pedal already \\"floored\\" would not increase RPM in proportion to the 1.8:1 drop in gear ratio. The Dynaflow aural experience was similar to that of a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) (though modern electronically controlled CVT's address this throttle position dependent engine speed (and sound) characteristic by artificially inserting stepwise ratio changes instead of a truly continuous or constant rate change in order to simulate more driver-satisfying genuine shifts). 1953 redesign In 1953, Buick redesigned the Dynaflow, calling it the \\"Twin Turbine Dynaflow\\". The converter now incorporated two turbines and a planetary gear set, with a single stator. The first turbine was linked to the ring gear and the second to the planets, which gave a 2.5:1 torque multiplication which was now partly mechanical. This resulted in better efficiency, especially at highway speeds, and a higher level of performance and no penalty regarding the trademark smoothness. Buick also incorporated a variable-pitch stator in 1955 for greater flexibility. While these changes improved the transmission's overall performance and efficiency, the Dynaflow still was no match for other designs that utilized three element converters with automatic shifting. 1956 Redesign In 1956 a second stator was designed into the torque converter at the outer diameter of the turbines. This provided a Stall Ratio of 3.5:1 making the performance comparable to other automatic transmissions of the time. This design continued until the end of production of the Twin Turbine Drive in 1963. However, the Triple Turbine ended production in the end of the 1960 model year, leaving the original Dynaflow Twin Turbine the only automatic available in full-size Buicks. 1958 redesign A final version appeared in 1958 incorporating three turbines that Buick named the \\"Flight Pitch Dynaflow\\". Buick made this transmission standard on its top of the line Roadmaster 75 and Limited models and optional on all others. This version was further refined for 1959 and renamed the \\"Triple Turbine\\" but was offered only as an option on all models (Buick dropped the \\"Dynaflow\\" name after 1958). This unit was similar to the Twin Turbine, but had a variable pitch stator that increased converter's torque multiplication to 3:1. The stator element of the torque converter has two blade positions, controlled by the driver via the accelerator pedal to offer a 'passing gear' and extra response at any speed from heavy throttle application. In normal driving the stator blades are arranged at 'cruise' angle, with improved efficiency and response at light throttle. Opening the throttle changes the angle of the stator vanes hydraulically to 'performance angle', which permits the converter to achieve stall about 1000 rpm higher than in 'cruise'. In this situation oil is redirected to strike the next- lowest drive turbine, which effectively lowers the drive ratio, and allows engine speed to flare to a speed where output is greatest. A few identifying features: the older Twin Turbine model was fitted with a rear pump, which meant the vehicle could be push-started (considered desirable at the time). Also, the Twin Turbine would allow engagement of low gear up to , and had a shift quadrant that read P-N-D-L-R. In contrast, the Triple Turbine unit did not have a rear pump, and could not be push started. It would allow engagement of low gear up to , and had a shift quadrant that read P-R-N-D-G (where \\"G\\" stood for \\"grade retard\\"). The grade retard feature was not designed as a low or forward acceleration gear and was meant to be used only on long declines to generate a degree of engine braking. The Triple Turbine was cancelled after 1959 due to technical problems and poor sales with only the Twin Turbine being produced until 1963. In the late 1950s the Buick division of GM collaborated with Darby Buick of Sarasota, Florida to investigate potential marine uses of the Dynaflow transmission. The test boat was a 21-foot Correct Craft. The engine was a 364 CID Buick with a four barrel Rochester carburetor of nominal 300 gross hp. The boat could attain a speed of about 60 mph (96 km/h), which was considerable for the time, but the transmission suffered from two problems. First, the torque in reverse was excessive, although this could have been alleviated with different gear ratios. Second, the state of \\"Park\\" in a car necessitated a stopped drivetrain. Without the locked-in-place tires of a car, it was difficult to put the transmission into the equivalent of \\"Park.\\" Termination In 1964, the Dynaflow was discontinued in favor of the more efficient Super Turbine 300 two-speed and Super Turbine 400 three-speed transmissions, Super Turbine 400 being Buick's trade name for the Turbo- Hydramatic. One feature of the Dynaflow, the variable-pitch torque converter stator, colloquially the \\"Switch-Pitch\\", lived on in versions of the Turbo- Hydramatic (Super Turbine 400) fitted to full-size Buicks, full-size Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs built from 1965‚Äì1967, as well as the Buick Super Turbine 300 and Oldsmobile Jetaway from 1964‚Äì1967. Cadillac Dynaflow The early 1950s Cadillacs were normally equipped with Hydramatic transmissions. In 1953 the General Motors Hydramatic Plant burned to the ground, leaving Cadillac without a source of transmissions. Buick Dynaflow transmissions were hastily adapted to Cadillac mount points, and some 19,000 1953 Model 62 Cadillacs, and some 28,000 Cadillacs of all models, were equipped with Dynaflow transmissions. Several thousand 1953 Oldsmobiles were also equipped with Dynaflow. Dynaflow in popular culture *Dynaflow was referred to in an episode of The Honeymooners called \\"The Deciding Vote\\" (which first aired on December 10, 1955). In it, Ed Norton (Art Carney) tries to explain the troubles with the vacuum cleaner purchased as a wedding anniversary gift by Ralph Kramden (Jackie Gleason) thus: \\"The armature sprocket is causing interference; which, in turn, causes the combustion line to interfere with the flow and the dynaflow.\\" This was a subtle sponsor plug/inside joke, as Buick was the sponsor of the show in the 1955‚Äì56 season. *Ray Charles' second hit record, \\"It Should Have Been Me\\" (1954), uses the Dynaflow as a sign of wealth and class in the lyric, \\"...It should have been me, driving that Dynaflow!\\" The song was written by Memphis Curtis. *Malvina Reynolds' song, \\"The Day the Freeway Froze\\", (1959) mentioned the Dynaflow in the lyric, \\"And a little VW superbug was winged by a Dynaflow.\\" *Progressive bandleader Stan Kenton entitled a recorded composition of his \\"Dynaflow.\\" *Blues singer Johnny Shines performed in the 1960s \\"Dynaflow Blues,\\" his electric version of Robert Johnson's acoustic \\"Terraplane Blues,\\" which uses automotive metaphors for sexual relations. *French Canadian singer Robert Charlebois refers to a \\"Buick Dynaflow\\" in his song \\"Dolor√®s\\" from 1968. *Tony Soprano references \\"Dynaflows\\" while berating an aged Michele \\"Feech\\" La Manna in an episode (Season 5 Episode 4) of The Sopranos. *In Hyannis, Massachusetts there is a street named Dynaflow Drive.

Fanny Farmer was started in Rochester, New York by Frank O'Connor in 1919, and grew to over 400 stores before being bought and consolidated. O'Connor had previously started the Laura Secord Candy Shops in Toronto, Canada in 1913. The company was named in honor of culinary expert Fannie Farmer, who had died four years earlier; she had nothing to do with the candy stores, and her recipes were not being used. \\"The spelling of the first name was altered to avoid confusion.\\" However, as a marketing device, it suggested reflected glory: high standards of quality. Fanny Farmer stores shared a look that was similar to that of Fannie May.Compare, John D. Hayes was president of the company for many years, from its earliest years through the 1950s. He was a shrewd businessman, and guided the company through some difficult times. During the Depression, candy sales were dropping until he slashed retail prices, and kept the company in business. During World War II, he self-imposed rationing on company stores in the US, to ensure adequate supplies of candy for the armed forces overseas. He was named 1955 \\"Candy Man of the Year\\" by the candy industry. He was also blind. In 1962, a proxy fight allowed a group of stock market investors from New York City & New England, without experience in the candy industry, to gain control of the Fanny Farmer company. They pushed for continuous expansion of the company, spending heavily to open more retail stores, despite facing increasing retail competition. This expansion by new management financially stressed the company. In 1992, the Archibald Candy Company acquired the brand \\"Fanny Farmer\\" and its 200 retail stores in the northeastern United States as a sister brand to its own Fannie May candies (sold primarily in the Midwest and mid-Atlantic United States). Alpine Confections purchased both brands in 2004 after Archibald filed for bankruptcy, and merged Fanny Farmer into Fannie May. An errant path of merger and acquisitions, whereby the company became the largest chain of candy retailers in the country but without adequate financing and a viable corporate strategy, was blamed for the bankruptcy. In its iteration at 1-800-Flowers, the successor corporation sold Fannie May and Fanny Farmer products.

Breitenstein's Verlags-Buchhandlung. It is subtitled with \\"Versuch einer modernen L√∂sung der Judenfrage\\" (\\"Proposal of a modern solution for the Jewish question\\") and was originally called \\"Address to the Rothschilds\\", referring to the Rothschild family banking dynasty, as Herzl planned to deliver it as a speech to the Rothschild family. Baron Edmond de Rothschild rejected Herzl's plan, feeling that it threatened Jews in the Diaspora. He also thought it would put his own settlements at risk. It is considered one of the most important texts of early Zionism. As expressed in this book, Herzl envisioned the founding of a future independent Jewish state during the 20th century. He argued that the best way to avoid antisemitism in Europe was to create this independent Jewish state. The book encouraged Jews to purchase land in Palestine, although the possibility of a Jewish state in Argentina is also considered. Herzl popularized the term \\"Zionism\\", which was coined by Nathan Birnbaum. The nationalist movement culminated in the birth of the State of Israel in 1948, but Zionism continues to be connected with political support of Israel. Summary After centuries of various restrictions, hostilities and frequent pogroms, the Jews of Europe have been reduced to living in ghettos. The higher class is forced to deal with angry mobs and so experiences a great deal of discomfort; the lower class lives in despair. Middle-class professionals are distrusted, and the statement \\"don't buy from Jews\\" causes much anxiety among Jewish people. It is reasonable to assume that the Jews will not be left in peace. Neither a change in the feelings of non-Jews nor a movement to merge into the surrounds of Europe offers much hope to the Jewish people: \\"The Jewish question persists wherever Jews live in appreciable numbers. Wherever it does not exist, it is brought in together with Jewish immigrants. We are naturally drawn into those places where we are not persecuted, and our appearance there gives rise to persecution. This is the case, and will inevitably be so, everywhere, even in highly civilised countries‚Äîsee, for instance, France‚Äîso long as the Jewish question is not solved on the political level.\\"Herzl, Der Judenstaat, cited by C.D. Smith, Israel and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 2001, 4th ed., p. 53 The book concludes: Herzl opposed the efforts already made by Zionist groups to settle Jews in Ottoman-controlled Palestine by arguing that \\"important experiments in colonization have been made, though on the mistaken principle of a gradual infiltration of Jews. An infiltration is bound to end badly. It continues till the inevitable moment when the native population feels itself threatened, and forces the government to stop a further influx of Jews. Immigration is consequently futile unless we have the sovereign right to continue such immigration.\\"(Quoted from The Jewish State, translated by Sylvie d‚ÄôAvigdor, Nutt, London, 1896, and reprinted by Dover, 1988, p. 95.) As pointed out by Michael Stein, in this passage Herzl accurately predicted what would actually happen forty years later: the influx of Jews into Mandatory Palestine in the 1930s did make the native Arab population feel threatened, leading to the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt ‚Äì which did force the British Government to announce in the White Paper of 1939 a stop to the further influx of JewsMichael Stein, \\"Collected Essays in the History of Zionism\\", Tel Aviv, 1954, pp. 46‚Äì47. For that reason, Herzl, both in Der Judenstaat and in his political activity on behalf of Zionism, concentrated his efforts on securing official legal sanction from the Ottoman authorities ‚Äì to no avail. In practice the Zionist Movement would resort, after Herzl's death, to the method he opposed: \\"a gradual infiltration of Jews\\". The instrument envisioned by Herzl was \\"The Jewish Company\\" ‚Äì \\"partly modeled on the lines of a great land- acquisition company. It might be called a Jewish Chartered Company\\" ‚Äì i.e. following in the footsteps of the numerous Chartered Companies which had a major role in the outward expansion of various European powers since the 16th century. The Jewish Company envisioned by Herzl would have charge of both of the properties of all Jews in their present countries and of the lands and properties in the coming Jewish State; it would dispose of the former and provide every Jew with equivalent properties in the new land. Herzl clearly stipulated that \\"the Jewish Company will be founded as a joint stock company subject to English jurisdiction, framed according to English laws, and under the protection of England\\" ‚Äì the City of London being at the time recognized as the financial capital of the world. For the Herculean tasks envisioned for it, Herzl estimated that the company's capital should be about a thousand million marks (about ¬£50,000,000 or $200,000,000). In fact, the Zionist Movement ‚Äì both in Herzl's time and later ‚Äì could not come anywhere close to such gigantic figures. Under Herzl's direction there was created a few years later the Jewish Colonial Trust ‚Äì indeed located in London and incorporated under British law, but with the modest capital of 250,000 Pounds, about half of one percent of the envisioned Jewish Company. Even so, the \\"Colonial Trust\\" and its affiliate, the Anglo Palestine Company had a key role in the actual implementation of the Zionist Project, and eventually became Bank Leumi, one of Israel's main banks.

During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Sawm is observed between dawn and nightfall when the evening adhan is sounded. Ramadan is the ninth month of the Muslim lunar calendar and fasting is the fourth of the five pillars of Islam.  Introduction  Fasting is not for only Muslims, it has been practiced for centuries by religions such as Christianity, Judaism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Taoism, among others. It is stated in the Quran that Allah says \\"O you who believe, fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may develop God-consciousness.\\" (Quran 2:183). Some societies in North America fasted to serve as penance for sin and avert catastrophes. Incas of Peru and Native Americans of Mexico observed fasts to appease their gods. Former nations such as Assyrians and the Babylonians observed fasting as a form of penance. Jews observe fasting as a form of purification and penitence on the Day of Atonement or Yom Kippur annually. Food and drinks are not permitted on this day. Fasting took a different form in the West such as hunger strike which is a form of fasting, used in modern times as a political weapon which was made popular by the leader of India's struggle for freedom,(Mohandas Gandhi). He undertook fasts to compel his followers to obey his precept of non violence. Early Christians during the first two centuries, associated fasting with purification and penitence. The Christian church made fasting as a voluntary preparation for receiving the sacraments of Baptism and Holy Communion and for the ordination of priests. Later, they were made compulsory and other days were subsequently added. The Lenten fast was expanded in the 6th Century to 40 days where one meal was allowed on each day. Fasting was retained by most Protestant churches and was made optional in some cases after the Reformation. However, stricter Protestants condemned both the festivals of the church and their traditional fasts. The Roman Catholics fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday as their fast may involve partial abstinence from food and drink or total abstinence. In the Quran In the Quran, the practice of fasting is mentioned. In verse 2:183, Quran expresses situations in which a Muslim is allowed to abstain from fasting and introduces alternative solutions such as feeding needy people. Also, it is emphasized in verse 2:183-185 that it is not necessary for people who are traveling or sick to be fasting. It can be postponed until \\"another equal number of days.\\" According to verse 5:95, among other things, fasting may be used to make up for certain sins, such as killing an animal during a state of ihram. The Quran verse 2:185 also states that the Quran was revealed in the month of Ramadan. Another verse 97:1 in the Quran states that it was revealed \\"on the Night of Power,\\" where Muslims observe in one of the last 10 nights of Ramadan. Definition Fasting is primarily an exercise of devotion to willingly renounce oneself, for a definite period of time, from all bodily appetites in order to form spiritual discipline and self-control. Muslims are prohibited from eating or drinking from dawn (fajr) to dusk (maghrib). It is considered time to begin fasting when a person standing outside can tell a white thread from a black thread, i.e the light of sun rise and the darkness of the night. Conditions=Intention (niyyah) \\"The intention (niyyah) means resolving to fast. It is essential to have the intention the night before, night by night, in Ramadaan.\\"Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa‚Äôimah, vol. 10, p. 246. For fasting, the intention is necessary. General conditions Throughout the duration of the fast itself, Muslims will abstain from certain provisions that the Quran has otherwise allowed; namely eating, drinking and sexual intercourse.This is in addition to the standard obligation already observed by Muslims of avoiding that which is not permissible under Quranic or shari'a law (e.g. ignorant and indecent speech, arguing and fighting and lustful thoughts). Without observing this standard obligation, sawm is rendered useless and is seen simply as an act of starvation. The fasting should be a motive to be more benevolent to the fellow-creatures. Charity to the poor and needy in this month is one of the most rewardable worships. If one is sick, nursing or travelling, one is considered exempt from fasting. Any fasts broken or missed due to sickness, nursing or travelling must be made up whenever the person is able before the next month of Ramadan. According to the Quran, for all other cases, not fasting is only permitted when the act is potentially dangerous to one's health ‚Äì for example, those who are sick, elderly, or on a journey, and women who are menstruating, pregnant, or nursing are permitted to break the fast, but this must be made up by paying a fidyah which is essentially the iftaar and suhur for a fasting person who requires such financial help. Muslim scholars have stated that observing the fast is forbidden for menstruating women. However, when a woman's period has ceased, she must bathe and continue fasting. Any fasts broken or missed due to menstruation must be made up whenever she can before the next month of Ramadan. Women must fast at times when not menstruating, as the Quran indicates that all religious duties are ordained for both men and women. The reason for this is because the Quran refers to menstruation as \\"Say: It is a discomfort(Menstruation)\\" According to Nouman Ali Khan an Islamic speaker in the United States the reason for this prohibition is because of the pain associated with it. A Muslim woman may still do dhikr (remembrance of Allah) and make dua (supplication to Allah) during this time. Fasting is obligatory for a person if they fulfill five conditions: #They are a Muslim. #They are accountable (Islamic past the age of puberty). #They are able to fast. #They are settled (not traveling). #There are no impediments to fasting such as sickness, extreme pain from injury, breastfeeding, or pregnancy. Breaking the fast and the consequences During Ramadan, if one unintentionally breaks the fast by eating or drinking, then they must continue fasting for the rest of the day and the fast remains valid. For those who intentionally break the fast by eating or drinking, they have to make up for that and also repent. For breaking fast by having sexual intercourse, the consequences are: # Free a slave, and if that is not possible, # Fast for two consecutive Hijri (moon) months, and if that's not possible # Feed or clothe sixty people in need. During voluntary fasts, if one unintentionally breaks the fast then they may continue for the rest of the day and the fast remains valid. If one intentionally breaks the fast there is no sin on them, because it is only voluntary.Majmoo‚Äô al-Fataawa, 20Narrated by al-Daaraqutni, no. 24; classed as hasan by al-Haafiz in al-Fath, 4/210 Breaking oaths and consequences If an oath is given and circumstances dictate that it must be broken (or if the one giving the oath deliberately breaks it), one must offer expiation (kaffara) by freeing 60 slaves, or feeding or clothing sixty needy people with the average of what is needed for one's own family, or if neither of those can be done then a fast for three days is prescribed instead.  Beginning and ending  Ending the fast at a mosque In accordance with traditions handed down from Muhammad, Muslims eat a pre-dawn meal called suhur. All eating and drinking must be finished before the adhan for fajr, the pre-dawn call to prayer. Unlike the zuhr and maghrib prayer, which have clear astronomical definitions (afternoon and after-sunset), there are several definitions used in practice for the timing of \\"true dawn\\" (al-fajr al-·π£ƒÅdiq), as mentioned in the hadith. These range from when the center of the sun is 12 to 21 degrees below the horizon which equates to about 40 to 60 minutes before civil dawn. There are no restrictions on the morning meal other than those of Islamic dietary laws. After completing the suhur, Muslims recite the fajr prayer. No food or beverage can be taken after suhur. Water can enter the mouth, but not be swallowed, during wudu. The meal eaten to end the fast is known as iftar. Muslims break the fast with dates and water before maghrib prayer, after which they might eat a more wholesome meal.  Spiritual aspect  Fasting has been prescribed to all Muslims as a form of religious obligation for overcoming their lust and desires within a reasonable limit so that one can control oneself and prevent becoming a slave to their appetites. The Qur‚Äôan states that if humans cannot prevent themselves from desires then they cannot achieve salvation. ‚ÄúAs for him who fears to stand before his Lord and restrains himself from low desires, Paradise is surely the abode‚Äù (Verse 79: 40-41). Muslims abstain from a permissible norm of daily life due to the command of Allah so it strengthens one‚Äôs self-control and increases consciousness of the Lord. It is not prescribed as a punishment upon people or to inflict burdensome practices. It is a moral and spiritual training whose underlying idea is to teach moderation and spiritual discipline so that human temptations do not surpass the moral disciplines implemented in Islam. Furthermore, fasting is mandatory for only a definite period of time and does not promote total renunciation from the appetite of the flesh. Eating, drinking, and sexual intercourse become permissible for a human at the end of the fast. Therefore, Islamic fasting aims at promoting proper limits within its natural bounds.  Harmful effects  Islamic fasting, as a time-restricted eating habit that inverts the normal human day-night-routine for the observants, can have deleterious health effects on sleep patterns and the general health. Fasting in Ramadan has been shown to alter the sleep patterns and the associated hormone production. Statistical comparison of thousands of school children, part of whom were born without the month of Ramadan during pregnancy and part of whom where Ramadan coincided with the pregnancy, has revealed significantly lower intelligence, lower cognitive capability, and lower growth in adolescence if the mother observed Ramadan fasting during pregnancy. Children whose mother fasted during Ramadan also have a higher incidence of several chronic diseases, e.g. Type 2 Diabetes.https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/28597/1/dp0926.pdf The education departments of Berlin and the United Kingdom have tried to discourage students from fasting during Ramadan, as they claim that not eating or drinking can lead to concentration problems and bad grades. Ramadan fasting has also been associated with loss of workplace productivity by 35 to 50%. Many of the purported health benefits associated with Ramadan fasting only take into account the abstinence from food while ignoring the lack of water intake, which can have a harmful impact even in healthy individuals. In many cultures, it is associated with heavy food and water intake during Suhur and Iftar times, which may do more harm than good. Ramadan fasting is safe for healthy people provided that overall food and water intake is adequate, but those with medical conditions should seek medical advice if they encounter health problems before or during fasting. The fasting period is usually associated with modest weight loss, but weight can return afterwards. A review of the literature by an Iranian group suggested fasting during Ramadan might produce renal injury in patients with moderate (GFR <60 ml/min) or severe kidney disease but was not injurious to renal transplant patients with good function or most stone-forming patients. Ramadan fasting can be potentially hazardous for pregnant women as it is associated with risks of inducing labour and causing gestational diabetes, although it does not appear to affect the child's weight. It is permissible to not fast if it threatens the woman's or the child's lives, however, in many instances pregnant women are normal before development of complications.Islamic Studies Maldives Days=Month of Ramadan Fasting in the month of Ramadan is considered Fard. Days of Oath If you swear or make an oath, for example: \\"If I graduate with a good mark, I will fast for three days for God\\" then common belief dictates that one should fulfil this. This type of fasting is considered obligatory. Breaking such an oath is considered sinful. Days for voluntary fasting Muslims are encouraged, although not obliged, to fast days throughout the year: the ninth and tenth, or tenth and eleventh of Muharram, the first month of the year. The tenth day, called Ashurah, is also a fast day for the Jews (Yom Kippur), and Allah commanded the Muslims to fast. such as: * any 6 days in the lunar or \\"Islamic\\" month of Shawwal (the month after Ramadan (Hijri) * Fasting on Mondays and Thursdays is desirable if possible. * The White Days, the 13th, 14th, and 15th day of each lunar month (Hijri) * the Day of Arafah (9th of Dhu'I-Hijja in the Islamic (Hijri) calendar) * As often as possible in the months of Rajab and Sha'aban before Ramadan * First 9 days of Dhu al-Hijjah in the Islamic calendar (but not for any who are performing Hajj (the pilgrimage) Days when fasting is forbidden Although fasting is considered a pious act in Islam, there are times when fasting is considered prohibited or discouraged according to the majority of the sunni scholars: * Eid al-Adha and three days following it, because Muhammad said \\"You are not to fast these days. They are days of eating and drinking and remembering God\\", reported by Abu Hurairah. * Eid al-Fitr * It is also forbidden to single out Fridays and only fast every Friday, as 'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. al-'As said that he heard Muhammad say \\"Verily, Friday is an eid (holiday) for you, so do not fast on it unless you fast the day before or after it.\\" * Fasting every day of the year is considered non-rewarding; Muhammad said: \\"There is no reward for fasting for the one who perpetually fasts.\\" This Hadith is considered authentic by the Sunni scholars. Fasting is also prohibited on the 11th, 12th, and 13th of Dhul Hijjah - Days of Tashreeq The Quran contains no other prohibition regarding the days of fasting. In polar regions Nothing was said directly about the polar region and fasting. But there is Hadith about Al-Masih ad-Dajjal that proves that fast as prayers have to be estimated and done every 24 hours, this is the opinion of the Council of Senior Scholars in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Map showing the dates of midnight sun at various latitudes (left) and the total number of nights. These concerns are because at polar latitudes, summer solstices feature the midnight sun and winter solstices have polar night. These natural phenomena occur because the earth's axis tilts toward the sun in summer and away from the sun in winter, causing the poles to be exposed to the sun's rays for six months each, non-stop. The reason most of the earliest Muslims did not experience these phenomena during Islam's early days is because they did not live in polar regions, but in the Subtropics, where the Sun can be directly overhead and does set at night. In Tafsir Maarif ul Qur'an it is said that the Quran states that \\"(During Ramadan) eat and drink until the white thread of dawn appear to you distinct from its black thread.\\" This results that fasting is a duty for Muslims only when days and nights are producing otherwise fasting is not necessary.Maarif ul Qur'an page#450 So the Muslims of Svalbard have to fast only when days and nights are prominent by the sun. If Ramadan comes in June/December (when days and nights are not prominent by the sun in Svalbard, Norway) they may leave fasting and then complete their fasting in March/September (when days and nights are prominent by the sun in Svalbard, Norway). In Islamic law it is called Qadha. God says in the Quran: \\"God intends every facility for you; He does not want to put you to difficulties. (He wants you) to complete the prescribed period, and to glorify Him in that He has guided you; and perchance ye shall be grateful.\\" See also *Ancillaries of the Faith *Fidyah and Kaffara Notes References  External links  * Fasting & Ramadan: Complete Interactive Online Guide * Scholarly Articles on the Law of Fasting in Islam * Fasting in the Quraan * Comprehensive Article and Book Collection on fasting and Ramadhan * Esoteric view on sawm - fasting in Ramadan * Islamic holidays and observances * Time of start and end of sawn per city * Health in Ramadan * How Fasting Helps with Self-Control * How to spend Ramadan * Fasting Six Days of Shawwal: Necessary? * Sawm ‚Äì The Fast of Ramadan Category:Fasting ","title":"Fasting in Islam"},{"id":"1511938","text":"Tsugaru City Hall J≈çmon period Dog≈´ statue found in Tsugaru is a city located in Aomori Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 31,723 in 13,570 households,Tsugaru City official statistics and a population density of 130 persons per km¬≤.

It stars Guillaume Canet and Marion Cotillard. Plot The film begins where a little girl, Sophie, is being bullied by other children. Only a bus driver and a boy, Julien, help her collect her books that the others have thrown into a puddle. To cheer Sophie up, Julien gives her a small tin box, a gift from his fatally ill mother. Because it is important to him, he asks her to lend it back to him from time to time. As Julien wants the box back at the moment he gave it to her, Sophie demands proof of how important it is to him. Julien disengages the handbrake of the bus without hesitation, and the bus full of children rolls down a hill. Their game has begun: the box changes its owner after each completed dare. Between the son of wealthy Belgian parents and the daughter of poor Polish immigrants a lasting friendship develops. As children, they misbehave in school, wreak havoc on a wedding, and request silly tasks of each other. As teenagers, their romantic relationships with others suffer as a result of their dares. Meanwhile, the two friends ignore any consequences or punishment during their game. While they are always looking for the next kick, a love is slowly evolving between the protagonists. Not wanting to admit it, they divert their attention from it by even more extreme dares. As young adults, Julien tells Sophie that he wants to get married, only later revealing that he means to someone else. The climax is reached when Sophie interrupts Julien's wedding, after which he is cast out by his father and Sophie is nearly killed during another game. Julien returns to marry his wife, and Sophie declares that they will not see each other for ten years. Ten years pass, and Julien is married with two children. Sophie has also married her husband, a famous soccer star. A successful Julien admits that he has not forgotten Sophie, though he assumes that she has forgotten him. On the night of Julien's tenth wedding anniversary, Sophie sends a message to him, indicating that the game is back on. Julien and Sophie meet for a brief moment in the midst of another dare, yet it is enough to remind Julien that their game is \\"better than life itself.\\" After a dramatic accident, Julien and Sophie finally reunite, despite the protestations of their spouses. The film has two alternate endings, which are shown consecutively. In the first, Julien and Sophie decide as an ultimate dare to finally share their dream together, their \\"dream of an eternal love\\" ‚Äì the pair embrace while they stand in a construction pit that is about to be filled with concrete. The couple kiss as they are pulled beneath the cement, and both drown in the sludge. The other ending has the now aged Julien and Sophie spending time together in a garden and carrying on playing their game with milder dares. However, the opening scene of the film (an overhead view of a building site and a pit filled with concrete in which the upper side Julien's tin box rests partially sunk) replays, suggesting that the two friends actually did bury themselves and drown beneath the concrete.

He has been campaigning a nationalist and separatist movement in Pakistan for over four decades. He is the head of the Shahizai Mangal tribe. He was born in 1929 in Wadh, and became the first Chief Minister of Balochistan during Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's premiership from 1 May 1972 to 13 February 1973. It was reported that Sardar Ataullah Khan Mengal was one of many candidates considered for the position of President of Pakistan after the resignation of Pervez Musharraf.Top contenders for office of president  Joining National Awami Party  In 1958, Ataullah Mengal along with chief of Marri tribe Khair Bakhsh Marri joined the National Awami Party (Wali) of Khan Wali Khan and developed a close friendship with Wali Khan over the next decade. Ghaus Bux Bizenjo and Gul Khan Nasir already were members of NAP.. In the 1970 general election, National Awami Party swept the provinces of Balochistan and North-West Frontier Province, thus forming governments in each of them. In Balochistan, Ataullah Mengal was made the first chief minister of the province.  Chief Minister of Balochistan  Ataullah Mengal is from an ancestry of powerful feudal sardars. He won the provincial seat from his native wadh district (khuzdar) and was installed as the chief minister on 1 May 1972, the day the martial law was lifted from the country. In his short time as Chief Minister he pushed through many initiatives, in which the province's first university, medical college and board of secondary education were set up as well as the first industrial city of the province, in Hub, Lasbela District.  Dismissal of NAP-led government  Despite Mengal's best efforts, the NAP government was plunged into several crises which culminated with his governments dismissal. As there was a provision that employees in the federating provinces would return to their province of origin after the dissolution of the One Unit. Most of the officers insisted on leaving this was despite the fact, Sardar Ataullah Mengal as chief minister moved a resolution in the Balochistan Assembly to do away with the domicile category and suggested that those who had spent several generations in the province should be treated as locals (Rahman 2006). Shaeed Sardar Arif Aziz Muhammed Hassani was also there. Shaheed Sardar Arif Aziz Muhammed Hassani was also the member of NAP. and after that he joined the Baloch National Movement that was the main history. It was later on alleged that the officers were incited to leave through the efforts of PPP supporters and the then Chief Minister of Punjab Ghulam Mustafa Khar. Unable to exercise any effective authority, Ataullah Mengal turned to the Baloch Student Organisation to assist in security.  Discovery of London Plan  The policing crisis also gave way to a subsequent intra tribal conflict that broke out, which again the Baloch nationalists believe was fomented by the then Interior Minister Abdul Qayyum Khan. However, the final straw was the discovery of arms in the Iraqi embassy in Islamabad and Nawab Akbar Bugti's declaration of the London Plan, that alleged that NAP-led governments in Balochistan and NWFP was seceding to gain independence from Pakistan. Hence, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's government used the pretext of arms shipment from Iraq to insurgents and dismissed the Balochistan provincial government in 1973 and declared Presidential Rule. Ataullah Mengal and his colleagues, including Ghaus Bux Bizenjo and Khair Bakhsh Marri were arrested along with other NAP leaders.  Hyderabad tribunal  Mir Gul Khan Nasir (Left), Ataullah Mengal (Middle) and Mir Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo (Right) in a historic group photo taken in Mach Jail A commission, later known as Hyderabad tribunal, was set up by the PPP-led government and was used to convict the NAP leaders, despite its dubious legality and now discredited work. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the then Prime Minister of Pakistan, also suppressed the insurgency in Balochistan by using the air force and with the co-operation of the regime of the Shah of Iran. Some tribals, however, did not join the revolt and collaborated with the government in suppressing their co-tribals. Among the tribals who collaborated with the government and the Pakistani military-intelligence establishment were the Jamalis, led by the family of Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali, who became the premier during General Pervez Musharraf's regime. After the ouster of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's government by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, negotiations for the winding up of the Hyderabad tribunal and the release of all detainees was initiated leading to their eventual release in 1979.  Differences with NAP leaders  By this time a clear divide between NAP leader Wali Khan and Baloch leaders Ataullah Mengal and Ghaus Bux Bizenjo. Mengal and many other Baloch nationalists increasingly believed that the Army was responsible for a brutal military operation and that they should be opposed by force, whereas Wali Khan felt more personal bitterness towards Ali Bhutto as he felt Bhutto had ordered his assassination on more than one occasion. This divide turned into a total split when Ataullah Mengal allied himself with Khair Bakhsh Marri and attempted to take over the National Democratic Party (a successor to the then banned NAP). Sherbaz Khan Mazari, president of the National Democratic Party and a champion for the Baloch cause tried to reconcile these differences but did not succeed. When this attempt failed Ataullah Mengal left the party. After Bhutto was deposed in a military coup by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1977, Rahimuddin Khan was appointed the province's governor and martial law administrator, beginning a tenure characterised by hostility towards the sardars. Mengal subsequently went into exile and took sanctuary in the United Kingdom that year, where he established contact with the authorities of the erstwhile Soviet Union through the regime in Kabul and received financial and logistics support from Moscow.  Founding of Sindhi Baloch Pushtoon Front  Ataullah Mengal participated in the founding of Sindhi Baloch Pushtoon Front in London on 31 March 1985.  Return to Pakistan and founding of BNP  Sardar Ataullah Mengal returned to Balochistan in 1995, after which he formed the Balochistan National Party, which emerged as the largest political party in the province. Mengal's youngest son, Sardar Akhtar Mengal served as the Chief Minister of Balochistan in 1997, during the premiership of Nawaz Sharif. Mengal's son, Akhtar, was involved in a standoff with Pakistani police at his Karachi house in April 2006 after his bodyguards kidnapped three government employees who he accused of attempting to kidnap his children.Schmidle, Nicholas.

The site is located northwest of Washington D.C. in Glen Echo, Maryland. The United States National Historic Site protects 9 acres (0.04 km¬≤) of land at her Glen Echo home including the 38-room former residence of Barton. The site is managed by the George Washington Memorial Parkway. The first national historic site dedicated to the accomplishments of a woman, it preserves the early history of the American Red Cross and the last home of its founder. Clara Barton spent the last 15 years of her life in her Glen Echo home (1897-1912), and it served as an early headquarters of the American Red Cross as well. The National Park Service has restored eleven rooms, including the Red Cross offices, parlors and Clara Barton's bedroom. Visitors to Clara Barton National Historic Site can gain a sense of how Barton lived and worked surrounded by all that went into her life's work. Visitors to the site are led through the three levels on a guided tour emphasizing Barton's use of her unusual home. In 2005, 12,529 visitors toured the site. Description The large frame house was partially constructed from lumber salvaged from emergency buildings built by the Red Cross at Johnstown, Pennsylvania in the wake of the Johnstown Flood of 1889. The lumber of the dismantled buildings was brought to Washington via the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal to avoid flooding the local market in Johnstown. The lumber was stored on a lot owned by Barton in Washington D.C. until early in 1891 when construction began on land donated by Edwin and Edward Baltzley, who were developing a Chautauqua assembly at Glen Echo. The house was designed by Dr. Julian B. Hubbell, the first field agent of the American Red Cross. Hubbell oversaw the construction work performed by Baltzley's construction team. The original structure included a massive stone front in a style in keeping with the rest of the Chautauqua buildings. In 1897, when Barton moved into the house permanently, the central part of the stone facade was dismantled, creating flanking stone towers. The addition of pointed roofs accentuated the effect on the deep, narrow house. In spite of its massive size, the house is sparely detailed and furnished for utility. The interior is designed as if it were a Mississippi River steamboat. The house contains 36 rooms and 38 closets, with three tiers of rooms facing a central gallery lighted by clerestory windows of colored glass. The Clara Barton House was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.

It is a form of pollination control,Seed corn Iowa State University. Retrieved October 12, 2009. employed to cross-breed, or hybridize, two varieties of corn. Fields of corn that will be detasseled are planted with two varieties of corn. Every corn plant has both male and female parts, so if both varieties of corn were left intact, some of the resulting seeds would have non-hybrid parents. Removing the tassels from all the plants of one variety leaves the grain that is growing on those plants to be fertilized by the tassels of the other, resulting in a hybrid. In addition to being more physically uniform, hybrid corn produces dramatically higher yields than corn produced by open pollination, as well as other desirable traits, such as disease, drought, and weather resistance. With modern seed corn the varieties to hybridize are carefully selected so that the new variety will exhibit specific traits found in both the parent plants. The detasseling process usually involves the use of both specialized machines and human labor. Machine detasseling Nearly all detasseling is done in two steps; the field is first detasseled by machine and then detasseled manually. Machine detasseling itself is typically a two step process. Initially a detasseling machine called a \\"cutter\\" goes through the rows of corn to be detasseled and cuts off the top portion of the plant. This is done to make the field more uniform so that a \\"puller\\" machine can then come through the corn field when the tassels have started to emerge past the cut leaves and pull the tassel out of the plant. It typically takes 24 to 48 hours to have the tips of the tassels emerge enough to get a good pull without grabbing the leaves of the plant after the initial cut. The pullers work by catching the top of the tassel between two rollers moving at a high speed. This removes the majority of the tassels. Detasseling machines typically remove 30 to 90 percent of the tassels in a seed corn field. This is far less than the 99.7 percent that need to be removed to produce the uniformity of seed desired by farmers. The main problems for the machines are that they are unable to adapt quickly to height differences in plants and they throw tassels into the air where they can become lodged in other corn plants and inadvertently allow pollination. It is desirable that the pulled tassel ends up on the ground to prevent this problem. Manual detasseling Whether or not a field of seed corn is initially detasseled by machines, eventually people are employed to detassel the plants that the machines missed and to remove any tassels that the machines left in the leaves of other corn plants. This is done either by having \\"detasselers\\" walk through the corn field removing the tassels or by having detasselers ride through the corn field on a detasseler carrier. Detasseler carriers are typically employed when the corn is too tall to be detasseled from ground level. Each carrier can hold from eight to twelve detasselers. Detasseling work is usually performed by teens; as such, it serves as a typical rite of passage in rural areas of the Corn Belt of the Midwestern United States. For many teens in these areas it is their first job. Exact starting dates depend on the specific area of the country and the growing conditions of any given year. The detasseling \\"season\\" typically lasts from two to four weeks with work days varying from just a few hours to over 10 hours depending on the growing season. Wages for detasselers vary greatly; some detasselers earn minimum wage while others earn over $12.00 per hour. Individual wages depend on the seed corn company, the detasseling contractor, the experience of the detasseler and even the individual field conditions such as the number of plants per acre, percentage of the tassels pulled by a detasseling machine or the height of the corn. The manner by which wages are determined can also vary greatly between detasseling contractors. Some pay a straight hourly wage, others pay on a piece rates basis where detasselers are paid an amount for every row, panel or acre detasseled. Other contractors use a rating system to determine detasseler wages for a given day. In addition to employing a large teenage workforce, some areas of the country employ migrant workers as detasselers. Migrant workers wages are usually paid on a piece rates basis. During the 1980s in some areas of the U.S. detasseling work shifted from being primarily local teenagers to primarily migrant farm workers. History=Early 20th century Detasseling was used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the \\"ear-row\\" method of corn breeding. In this method alternating rows of corn are detasseled and the seed from the detasseled rows is saved for planting the following season. However, ear-row breeding did not result in large yield increases and was largely abandoned after a few years. Around 1910 experimental corn breeders became excited by the possibility of improving corn yields by crossing two high yielding varieties. Again, this was accomplished by planting the varieties in alternating rows and detasseling one of the varieties. This method of seed production also proved disappointing and was also abandoned. However, the modern hybridization process, where one inbred line of corn is crossed with another, developed from this early work in cross breeding. In 1908, George Harrison Shull described heterosis, also known as hybrid vigor. Heterosis describes the tendency of the progeny of a specific cross to outperform both parents. In 1917 a process was developed that would make this hybridization commercially viable. In 1933 less than 1% of the corn produced in the United States was produced from hybrid seed; by 1944 over 83% was. This hybrid seed is produced by crossing two inbred lines by planting a row of one inbred variety followed by several rows of a second variety. The tassels of the second variety were removed by hand so that the second variety could be pollinated by the first. Late 20th century Hybrid corn was detasseled manually until the mid-1950s when a cytoplasm was discovered that would cause one of the inbred lines to be male sterile while the hybridized seed corn it produced would regain male fertility. This gene allowed seed corn companies to greatly reduce their labor costs by producing seed corn without the need for manual detasseling. By the mid-1960s nearly all seed corn was produced with this gene. This situation changed in 1971 with an outbreak of the fungus southern corn leaf blight. The cytoplasm used to produce male sterility was highly susceptible to this fungus. At the time approximately 90% of hybrid corn used in the United States contained this gene. About 15% of the corn crop was lost to infection and for the next few years male sterility was abandoned and nearly all seed corn was again detasseled manually. In the mid-1970s machines were developed to help reduce the large labor costs associated with manual detasseling and as a response to a shrinking rural teen labor force. In the 1980s male sterile varieties were reintroduced that were not susceptible to southern corn leaf blight, however the reliance on a single sterile variety seen in the 1960s has not been repeated. Today corn hybridization is accomplished by a combination of machine and manual detasseling as well as male-sterile genes. Seed corn fields Seed corn fields are planted in a repetitive pattern known as a \\"panel\\", \\"block\\", \\"frame\\", \\"bay\\" or \\"set\\" depending on the area of the country. There are two main planting patterns for these panels. A panel may be planted in a 6:2 pattern where six \\"female\\" rows, the rows to be detasseled, are followed by two \\"male\\" or \\"bull\\" rows, the rows that will be used to pollinate the detasseled rows. Panels are also commonly planted in a 4:1 ratio with four female rows followed by a single male row. Other, less common, patterns are also used including 4:2 and 4:1:6:1. In all cases the pattern is continued throughout the corn field. All or portions of seed corn fields may be surrounded by extra rows of male plants if it is likely that wind may carry foreign pollen into the seed corn field.

In its simplest form, it relates the expectation of a sum of randomly many finite-mean, independent and identically distributed random variables to the expected number of terms in the sum and the random variables' common expectation under the condition that the number of terms in the sum is independent of the summands. The equation is named after the mathematician Abraham Wald. An identity for the second moment is given by the Blackwell‚ÄìGirshick equation. Basic version Let be a sequence of real-valued, independent and identically distributed random variables and let be a nonnegative integer-value random variable that is independent of the sequence . Suppose that and the have finite expectations. Then :\\\\operatorname{E}[X_1+\\\\dots+X_N]=\\\\operatorname{E}[N] \\\\operatorname{E}[X_1]\\\\,. Example Roll a six-sided dice. Take the number on the die (call it ) and roll that number of six-sided dice to get the numbers , and add up their values. By Wald's equation, the resulting value on average is :\\\\operatorname{E}[N] \\\\operatorname{E}[X] = \\\\frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}6\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}6 = \\\\frac{441}{36} = \\\\frac{49}{4} = 12.25\\\\,.  General version  Let be an infinite sequence of real-valued random variables and let be a nonnegative integer-valued random variable. Assume that: :. are all integrable (finite-mean) random variables, :. for every natural number , and :. the infinite series satisfies ::: \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\operatorname{E}!\\\\bigl[X_n 1_{{N\\\\ge n}}\\\\bigr]<\\\\infty. Then the random sums :S_N:=\\\\sum_{n=1}^NX_n,\\\\qquad T_N:=\\\\sum_{n=1}^N\\\\operatorname{E}[X_n] are integrable and :\\\\operatorname{E}[S_N]=\\\\operatorname{E}[T_N]. If, in addition, :. all have the same expectation, and :. has finite expectation, then :\\\\operatorname{E}[S_N]=\\\\operatorname{E}[N]\\\\, \\\\operatorname{E}[X_1]. Remark: Usually, the name Wald's equation refers to this last equality. Discussion of assumptions Clearly, assumption () is needed to formulate assumption () and Wald's equation. Assumption () controls the amount of dependence allowed between the sequence and the number of terms; see the counterexample below for the necessity. Note that assumption () is satisfied when is a stopping time for the sequence . Assumption () is of more technical nature, implying absolute convergence and therefore allowing arbitrary rearrangement of an infinite series in the proof. If assumption () is satisfied, then assumption () can be strengthened to the simpler condition :. there exists a real constant such that for all natural numbers . Indeed, using assumption (), :\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\operatorname{E}!\\\\bigl[X_n1_{{N\\\\ge n}}\\\\bigr]\\\\le C\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\operatorname{P}(N\\\\ge n), and the last series equals the expectation of [Proof], which is finite by assumption (). Therefore, () and () imply assumption (). Assume in addition to () and () that :. is independent of the sequence and :. there exists a constant such that for all natural numbers . Then all the assumptions (), (), () and (), hence also () are satisfied. In particular, the conditions () and () are satisfied if :. the random variables all have the same distribution. Note that the random variables of the sequence don't need to be independent. The interesting point is to admit some dependence between the random number of terms and the sequence . A standard version is to assume (), (), () and the existence of a filtration such that :. is a stopping time with respect to the filtration, and :. and are independent for every . Then () implies that the event is in , hence by () independent of . This implies (), and together with () it implies (). For convenience (see the proof below using the optional stopping theorem) and to specify the relation of the sequence and the filtration , the following additional assumption is often imposed: :. the sequence is adapted to the filtration , meaning the is -measurable for every . Note that () and () together imply that the random variables are independent. Application An application is in actuarial science when considering the total claim amount follows a compound Poisson process :S_N=\\\\sum_{n=1}^NX_n within a certain time period, say one year, arising from a random number of individual insurance claims, whose sizes are described by the random variables . Under the above assumptions, Wald's equation can be used to calculate the expected total claim amount when information about the average claim number per year and the average claim size is available. Under stronger assumptions and with more information about the underlying distributions, Panjer's recursion can be used to calculate the distribution of . Examples=Example with dependent terms Let be an integrable, -valued random variable, which is independent of the integrable, real-valued random variable with . Define for all . Then assumptions (), (), (), and () with are satisfied, hence also () and (), and Wald's equation applies. If the distribution of is not symmetric, then () does not hold. Note that, when is not almost surely equal to the zero random variable, then () and () cannot hold simultaneously for any filtration , because cannot be independent of itself as is impossible. Example where the number of terms depends on the sequence Let be a sequence of independent, symmetric, and }-valued random variables. For every let be the œÉ-algebra generated by and define when is the first random variable taking the value . Note that , hence by the ratio test. The assumptions (), () and (), hence () and () with , (), (), and () hold, hence also (), and () and Wald's equation applies. However, () does not hold, because is defined in terms of the sequence . Intuitively, one might expect to have in this example, because the summation stops right after a one, thereby apparently creating a positive bias. However, Wald's equation shows that this intuition is misleading. Counterexamples=A counterexample illustrating the necessity of assumption () Consider a sequence of i.i.d. random variables, taking each of the two values 0 and 1 with probability ¬Ω (actually, only is needed in the following). Define . Then is identically equal to zero, hence , but and and therefore Wald's equation does not hold. Indeed, the assumptions (), (), () and () are satisfied, however, the equation in assumption () holds for all except for . A counterexample illustrating the necessity of assumption () Very similar to the second example above, let be a sequence of independent, symmetric random variables, where takes each of the values and with probability ¬Ω. Let be the first such that . Then, as above, has finite expectation, hence assumption () holds. Since for all , assumptions () and () hold. However, since almost surely, Wald's equation cannot hold. Since is a stopping time with respect to the filtration generated by , assumption () holds, see above. Therefore, only assumption () can fail, and indeed, since :{N\\\\ge n}={X_i=-2^{i} \\\\text{ for } i=1,\\\\ldots,n-1} and therefore for every , it follows that :\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\operatorname{E}!\\\\bigl[X_n1_{{N\\\\ge n}}\\\\bigr] =\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty 2^n\\\\,\\\\operatorname{P}(N\\\\ge n) =\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty 2=\\\\infty. A proof using the optional stopping theorem Assume (), (), (), (), () and (). Using assumption (), define the sequence of random variables :M_n = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\\\operatorname{E}[X_i]),\\\\quad n\\\\in{\\\\mathbb N}_0. Assumption () implies that the conditional expectation of given equals almost surely for every , hence is a martingale with respect to the filtration by assumption (). Assumptions (), () and () make sure that we can apply the optional stopping theorem, hence is integrable and Due to assumption (), :T_N=\\\\biggl\\\\sum_{i=1}^N\\\\operatorname{E}[X_i]\\\\biggr \\\\le \\\\sum_{i=1}^N\\\\operatorname{E}[X_i]\\\\le CN, and due to assumption () this upper bound is integrable. Hence we can add the expectation of to both sides of Equation () and obtain by linearity :\\\\operatorname{E}[S_N] =\\\\operatorname{E}[T_N]. Remark: Note that this proof does not cover the above example with dependent terms.  General proof  This proof uses only Lebesgue's monotone and dominated convergence theorems. We prove the statement as given above in three steps.  Step 1: Integrability of the random sum  We first show that the random sum is integrable. Define the partial sums Since takes its values in and since , it follows that :S_N=\\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\inftyS_i\\\\,1_{{N=i}}. The Lebesgue monotone convergence theorem implies that :\\\\operatorname{E}[S_N]=\\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty\\\\operatorname{E}[S_i\\\\,1_{{N=i}}]. By the triangle inequality, :S_i\\\\le\\\\sum_{n=1}^iX_n,\\\\quad i\\\\in{\\\\mathbb N}. Using this upper estimate and changing the order of summation (which is permitted because all terms are non-negative), we obtain ]=\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\operatorname{E}[X_n\\\\,1_{{N\\\\ge n}}],}} where the second inequality follows using the monotone convergence theorem. By assumption (), the infinite sequence on the right-hand side of () converges, hence is integrable.  Step 2: Integrability of the random sum  We now show that the random sum is integrable. Define the partial sums of real numbers. Since takes its values in and since , it follows that :T_N=\\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\inftyT_i\\\\,1_{{N=i}}. As in step 1, the Lebesgue monotone convergence theorem implies that :\\\\operatorname{E}[T_N]=\\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty T_i\\\\operatorname{P}(N=i). By the triangle inequality, :T_i\\\\le\\\\sum_{n=1}^i\\\\bigl!\\\\operatorname{E}[X_n]\\\\bigr,\\\\quad i\\\\in{\\\\mathbb N}. Using this upper estimate and changing the order of summation (which is permitted because all terms are non-negative), we obtain By assumption (), :\\\\bigl!\\\\operatorname{E}[X_n]\\\\bigr\\\\operatorname{P}(N\\\\ge n) =\\\\bigl!\\\\operatorname{E}[X_n1_{{N\\\\ge n}}]\\\\bigr \\\\le\\\\operatorname{E}[X_n1_{{N\\\\ge n}}],\\\\quad n\\\\in{\\\\mathbb N}. Substituting this into () yields :\\\\operatorname{E}[T_N]\\\\le\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\operatorname{E}[X_n1_{{N\\\\ge n}}], which is finite by assumption (), hence is integrable.  Step 3: Proof of the identity  To prove Wald's equation, we essentially go through the same steps again without the absolute value, making use of the integrability of the random sums and in order to show that they have the same expectation. Using the dominated convergence theorem with dominating random variable and the definition of the partial sum given in (), it follows that :\\\\operatorname{E}[S_N]=\\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty\\\\operatorname{E}[S_i1_{{N=i}}] =\\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty\\\\sum_{n=1}^i\\\\operatorname{E}[X_n1_{{N=i}}]. Due to the absolute convergence proved in () above using assumption (), we may rearrange the summation and obtain that :\\\\operatorname{E}[S_N]=\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\sum_{i=n}^\\\\infty\\\\operatorname{E}[X_n1_{{N=i}}]=\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\operatorname{E}[X_n1_{{N\\\\ge n}}], where we used assumption () and the dominated convergence theorem with dominating random variable for the second equality. Due to assumption () and the œÉ-additivity of the probability measure, :\\\\begin{align}\\\\operatorname{E}[X_n1_{{N\\\\ge n}}] &=\\\\operatorname{E}[X_n]\\\\operatorname{P}(N\\\\ge n)\\\\ &=\\\\operatorname{E}[X_n]\\\\sum_{i=n}^\\\\infty\\\\operatorname{P}(N=i) =\\\\sum_{i=n}^\\\\infty\\\\operatorname{E}!\\\\bigl[\\\\operatorname{E}[X_n]1_{{N=i}}\\\\bigr].\\\\end{align} Substituting this result into the previous equation, rearranging the summation (which is permitted due to absolute convergence, see () above), using linearity of expectation and the definition of the partial sum of expectations given in (), :\\\\operatorname{E}[S_N]=\\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty\\\\sum_{n=1}^i\\\\operatorname{E}!\\\\bigl[\\\\operatorname{E}[X_n]1_{{N=i}}\\\\bigr]=\\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\underbrace{T_i1_{{N=i}}}_{=\\\\,T_N1_{{N=i}}}]. By using dominated convergence again with dominating random variable , :\\\\operatorname{E}[S_N]=\\\\operatorname{E}!\\\\biggl[T_N\\\\underbrace{\\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty1_{{N=i}}}_{=\\\\,1_{{N\\\\ge1}}}\\\\biggr]=\\\\operatorname{E}[T_N]. If assumptions () and () are satisfied, then by linearity of expectation, :\\\\operatorname{E}[T_N]=\\\\operatorname{E}!\\\\biggl[\\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\operatorname{E}[X_n]\\\\biggr]=\\\\operatorname{E}[X_1]\\\\operatorname{E}!\\\\biggl[\\\\underbrace{\\\\sum_{n=1}^N 1}_{=\\\\,N}\\\\biggr]=\\\\operatorname{E}[N]\\\\operatorname{E}[X_1]. This completes the proof.

Newer versions (with different music) were recorded right up through the 19th century. Francis James Child recorded several versions in his Child Ballads (catalogued as number 26). A Scots language ballad called \\"Twa Corbies\\" (\\"Two Ravens\\" or \\"Two Crows\\") has lyrics based on \\"The Three Ravens\\" with a similar general story, but with a darker twist. Twa Corbies is sung to a different melody. The ballad takes the form of three scavenger birds conversing about where and what they should eat. One tells of a newly slain knight, but they find he is guarded by his loyal hawks and hounds. Furthermore, a \\"fallow doe\\", an obvious metaphor for the knight's pregnant (\\"as great with young as she might go\\") lover or mistress (see \\"leman\\") comes to his body, kisses his wounds, bears him away, and buries him, leaving the ravens without a meal. The narrative ends with \\"God send euery gentleman / Such haukes, such hounds, and such a Leman\\". Text of the ballad The lyrics to \\"The Three Ravens\\" are here transcribed using 1611 orthography. They can be sung either straight through in stanzas of four lines each, or in stanzas of two lines each repeating the first line three times depending on how long the performer would like the ballad to last. The second method appears to be the more canonical, so that is what is illustrated below. The refrains are sung in all stanzas, but they will only be shown for the first. :There were three rauensIn printed text of the time, u and v were often used interchangeably. sat on a tree, :downe a downe, hay downe, hay downe,The refrain consists of nonsense words that create a vocal musical interlude between lines of the stanza. See Puirt a beul. :There were three rauens sat on a tree, :with a downe, :There were three rauens sat on a tree, :They were as blacke as they might be. :With a downe, derrie, derrie, derrie, downe, downe. :The one of them said to his mate, :Where shall we our breakfast take? :Downe in yonder greene field, :There lies a Knight slain under his shield, :His hounds they lie downe at his feete, :So well they can their Master keepe, :His Hawkes they flie so eagerly, :There's no fowle dare him come nieNie: Variant of nigh. :Downe there comes a fallow Doe, :As great with yong as she might goe, :She lift up his bloudy head, :And kist his wounds that were so red, :She got him up upon her backe, :And carried him to earthen lake,Lake: Pit. :She buried him before the prime,Prime, Euen-song: see Canonical hours. :She was dead her self ere euen-song time. :God send euery gentleman, :Such haukes, such hounds, and such a Leman.Leman: Sweetheart or mistress The Twa Corbies Written heavily in the Scots language, \\"The Twa Corbies\\" probably dates from the 18th century and was first published in Walter Scott's Minstrelsy in 1812. Child (I, 253) quotes a letter from Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe to Walter Scott (August 8, 1802): \\"The song of 'The Twa Corbies' was given to me by Miss Erskine of Alva (now Mrs Kerr), who, I think, said that she had written it down from the recitation of an old woman at Alva.\\".See Malcolm Douglas's post in the mudcat.org thread on the subject, which gives more detailed references. It has a more dark and cynical tone than the Three Ravens, from which its lyrics were clearly derived. There are only two scavengers in ‚ÄúThe Twa Corbies‚Äù, but this is the least of the differences between the songs, though they do begin the same. Rather than commenting on the loyalty of the knight's beasts, the corbies tell that the hawk and the hound have forsaken their master, and are off chasing other game, while his mistress has already taken another lover. The ravens are therefore given an undisturbed meal, as nobody else knows where the man lies, or even that he is dead. They talk in gruesome detail about the meal they will make of him, plucking out his eyes and using his hair for their nests. Some themes believed to be portrayed in \\"Twa Corbies\\" are: the fragility of life, the idea life goes on after death, and a more pessimistic viewpoint on life. The loneliness and despair of the song are summed up in the final couplets; :O'er his banes [bones], when they are bare, :The wind sall [shall] blaw for evermair There are a few different versions of this anonymously authored poem. The full text of at least one version of the poem is as follows: :As I was walking all alane,alone :I heard twatwo corbiescarrion crows making a mane;moan :The taneone unto the t'other say, :‚ÄòWhere sall we gang and dine to-day?‚Äô :‚ÄòIn behint yon auld failturf dyke, :I wotknow there lies a new slain knight; :And naebody kensknows that he lies there, :But his hawk, his hound, and lady fair. :‚ÄòHis hound is to the hunting gane,gone :His hawk to fetch the wild-fowl hame,home :His lady's taentaken another mate, :So we may mak our dinner sweet. :‚ÄòYe'll sit on his white hause-bane,breast bone :And I'll pikepeck out his bonny blue een;eyes :Wi ae lock o his gowdenwith a lock of his golden hair :We'll theekfeather our nest when it grows bare. :‚ÄòMonymany a one for him makes mane,a moan :But nane sall kennone shall know where he is gane; :Oerover his white banes,bones when they are bare, :The wind sall blawshall blow for evermair.evermore‚Äô This ballad was one of 25 traditional works included in Ballads Weird and Wonderful (1912) and illustrated by Vernon Hill.

The novel was one of the favourites of J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis. *Dorothy L. Sayers quotes the last two lines of the ballad in her mystery novel Clouds of Witnesses. *There is a story, The 3 Ravens, in Jim Henson's HBO special The Storyteller which, despite its title, is based on the German fairy tale The Six Swans. *The ballad was selected for use in the 2017 period film My Cousin Rachel, following a commission for a \\"dark\\" English folk tune sung at a Christmas feast for an early-1800s farmstead. *A recording of the song features in the credits for the 2014 Channel 4 period drama New Worlds, which is set in England during the 1680s. *The song, in a version by John Harle, features in Simon Schama's A History of Britain, particularly in the episodes \\"The Body of the Queen\\", \\"The British Wars\\" and \\"The Two Winstons\\". Translations and adaptations in other languages Both \\"The Three Ravens\\" and \\"Twa Corbies\\" have been translated to other languages, typically all sung to the same melody as Twa Corbies, or that of the Breton song called An Alarc'h (The Swan). Known versions include: * Danish: Ravnene (The Ravens), a translation of Twa Corbies (i.e. the cynical lyrics, sans the final stanza) by Danish folklorist Svend Grundtvig (1824‚Äì1883) *Hebrew: ◊©◊ú◊ï◊©◊î ◊ë◊†◊ô ◊¢◊ï◊®◊ë (Three sons of a raven), translated by Nathan Alterman, and a more popular translation ◊©◊ú◊ï◊©◊î ◊¢◊ï◊®◊ë◊ô◊ù (Three ravens) by Yaakov Shabtai. * Finnish: Kaksi korppia is a translation of \\"Twa Corbies\\" by Finnish band Tarujen Saari. * Frisian: De twa roeken, translated by Klaes Bruinsma, sung by Doede Veeman on his LP \\"Frustraasjebloes\\". * German: Die drei Raben, a quite literal translation of The Three Ravens, by Theodor Fontane (1819‚Äì1898). Die zwei Raben by the same author, is the best known German version of Twa Corbies. * the German medieval/rock crossover group Schelmish wrote a German version of The Three Ravens lyrics, also titled Rabenballade (Raven's Ballad). * also, the German group Subway to Sally wrote the song Kr√§henfra√ü (Food for the Crows), also based on the Twa Corbies version and using a very similar melody, but with even more sinister lyrics. This version places the story in our times, replaces the knight with a soldier, and adds a new stanza in the end, loosely translating to \\"the bare bones will be clean / and preserved for a long time / and announce shining from the dirt / what a soldier's purpose is\\" (namely: the song title). * the German Neo-Medieval group Die Streuner has their own version titled \\"Rabenballade\\", with a rather emotional melody and cynical lyrics: Not only do the dogs stop guarding their master, they eat his flesh the next day. The falcons (not mentioned to be his own) are simply \\"no longer seen\\" and the maid \\"already that evening doesn't sleep alone\\". *the Czech folk music group Spiritu√°l kvintet adapted the melody of The Three Ravens to record a song V√°lka r≈Ø≈æ√≠ . However, the theme has been completely changed, as the new lyrics concerned the Wars of the Roses between Yorks and Lancasters. *the Czech folk music group Asonance adopted the Twa Corbies in very lyric translation, quite similar to original. *the Czech folk metal group Hakka Muggies used the tune in song Havrani (lit. Ravens). The lyrics however follow a story of two Scottish outlaw brothers, so the ravens are rather metaphorical. * the Czech group Jeƒçmen playing irish folk used the tune and text from Asonance to make a funny version about two chickens trying to survive after they've eaten all the barley and their master cannot make whisky. * Norwegian: Ravnene (The Ravens), a translation very similar to the Danish version. The Norwegian folk rock group Folque performed this song on their debut album, and used a tune very similar to Steeleye Span's version. * Russian: The great Russian poet Aleksandr Sergeyevich Pushkin published in 1828 partial translation of the French translation of Sir Walter Scott's Border Poems. It includes the poem entitled \\"–®–æ—Ç–ª–∞–Ω–¥—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–µ—Å–Ω—è\\" (Scottish Song), which has become known to almost every literate Russian-speaking person. Pushkin's translation contains only the first half of the poem, ending with \\"and the mistress awaits for her lover, not the killed one, but the alive one\\", thus making a dark hint the central point of the story. Many composers of the time wrote musical interpretations of the poem . * the Russian folk band Sherwood recorded a Russian-language version of Twa Corbies in their album \\"Sweet Joan\\" (2010) using own translation. * Basque: Bi beleak is a translation of \\"Twa Corbies\\" from the basque poet Jon Mirande, sung by the basque singer Imanol Larzabal. *The Polish folk band Odpust Zupe≈Çny recorded a Polish-language version 'Ballada o dw√≥ch krukach' (Ballad of two ravens).

Points are earned on purchases at participating merchants and can be redeemed against flights with specific airlines.  History  The Air Miles concept was created by Sir Keith Mills, and began operating in the UK in November 1988. British company Loyalty Management Group (LMG) operated the program and licensed the rights to it in other countries to other operators. LMG was later acquired by Canadian firm Groupe Aeroplan, now Aimia, which retains the intellectual property associated with the Air Miles name and logo internationally, and is the majority partner in the Air Miles program in the Middle East. In all other countries in which Air Miles programs operate, Aimia is the licensor and is not involved in program operation. In Canada, Air Miles competes directly with Aimia's former program, Aeroplan. Similarly the former Air Miles program in the UK had no affiliation with the Nectar program operated by Aimia.  Air Miles Canada  Currently owned and operated by LoyaltyOne, whose parent company is Alliance Data, the Air Miles reward program was launched in Canada in 1992, and is Canada's largest coalition loyalty program. In 1998, Air Miles Canada was acquired by Alliance Data Systems. In 2008, Alliance Data Loyalty Services became known as LoyaltyOne. Air Miles Canada has more than 100 sponsors, including Bank of Montreal, American Express, retail partners such as Rona, Inc., Staples, Shell Canada, Safeway, Metro, Sobeys and Sobeys Liquor, the Lawtons and Jean Coutu pharmacy chains, the Eastlink cable company, and online partners such as Amazon and eBay. Consumers collect Air Miles reward miles from sponsors, which can be redeemed for 1,200 reward choices, such as travel, entertainment, home electronics and gift cards. Consumers get the best value for their Air Miles when they use them for travel. There are more than ten million active collector accounts across Canada: approximately two-thirds of Canadian households participate in Air Miles. In April 2009, Air Miles Canada launched My Planet, an initiative to help people trade in their Air Miles for environmentally conscious products and services. Initially, My Planet offered collectors over 140 \\"green\\" redemption items, including public transit passes, organic cotton linens, and electric scooters. In September 2009, the program was extended to stores and point of purchase. Air Miles Canada has received awards for marketing, customer care/call centres, human resources, training and leadership.  2016 points cancellation  In 2011, Air Miles Canada announced that points earned by Canadian collectors would expire after five years. All points collected from inception to the end of 2011 would expire at midnight on 1 January 2017. The announcement went generally unnoticed at the time. In 2016, as the deadline for redeeming points came closer, the media began to report on Canadian collectors struggling to redeem their points, frustrations with customer service, accusations that reward offers were being manipulated to discourage redemptions and that merchandise was being hidden from some customers. On 1 December 30 days before the expiry deadline, LoyaltyOne reversed the policy, citing an impending Private Members Bill in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario that would ban the expiration of points in the Province of Ontario. It is estimated Air Miles intended to gain an estimated $180 to 250 million, due to the expiration of points (CAD), for the balance sheet of its parent company, US-based Alliance Data. The cancellation resulted in a US$242 million charge against fourth quarter 2016 earnings.  Air Miles Middle East  In the Middle East region, Air Miles is operated by Rewards Management Middle East. It is owned by Aimia (formerly Groupe Aeroplan). It operates a single program across the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain. Air Miles offers all of its members a wealth of rewards and unique offers and experiences. Since the launch in 2001, over 1.4 million members have enrolled from across the UAE, Qatar and Bahrain. Members collect Air Miles on everyday shopping from a huge range of partners including HSBC, Spinneys, Sharaf DG, Damas, Chilli's, African & Eastern and many more. Members who are HSBC credit cardholders are credited Air Miles for credit card transactions.  Air Miles Netherlands  Air Miles was first brought to the attention of potential business partners in the Netherlands by Keith Mills, Liam Cowdrey and Philip Beard during 1993, by way of an introduction from a senior ABN AMRO bank executive who had come across Air Miles during his international travels. In early 1994, Robert Gierkink was hired away from Air Miles Canada to lead an Amsterdam-based start-up team consisting of Todd Almeida, Frank Fisser, Fred Metman and Renee Belloni. ABN AMRO, Albert Heijn, Shell, Vroom & Dreesmann and KLM were contractually confirmed as anchor partners during the summer and the Air Miles programme launched via a massive advertising campaign in October 1994. The programme enjoyed immediate success, with millions of Dutch households enrolling into the programme before year's end. More than a dozen additional retailers also joined the Air Miles programme just prior to --- or within a year --- following the launch. These included Praxis, Etos, Gall & Gall, Blokker, Hunkemoller, Videoland and several others. Similar to other Air Miles programmes, Air Miles in the Netherlands originally included flights. But it also added a handful of other travel and leisure rewards. The initial rewards were KLM, Center Parcs, NS (Dutch Rail), Stena Line, Efteling and Noorder Dierenpark Emmen. In 1998, the reward programme was expanded to include a wide-ranging catalogue of merchandise redemption options. The programme's popularity later waned starting in 2004, when ABN AMRO ceased its participation. Albert Heijn subsequently limited its issuance of Air Miles just to private-label products to allow for greater product discounting via its Bonus Card programme. At Shell gas stations, customers can choose between Air Miles or stamps. Currently Air Miles has over 3.8 million active users, making it the largest loyalty program in the Netherlands. Air Miles Netherlands has announced that their points will expire after the 5 year mark for its customers starting in 2018.  Former programs = Air Miles United Kingdom  Both sides of a typical UK paper Air Miles voucher Air Miles in the UK was created in the mid-1980s by Alan Deller, Commercial Director of British Caledonian Airways and the partners of advertising agency Mills, Smith & Partners ‚Äì initially Keith Mills, Brian Smith, William Kershaw, Nick Tomlin, Peter Badham and Geoffrey Bean and later Liam Cowdrey. Together they formed the Air Miles Travel Promotions Limited in 1986 and sold 51% of the UK operation to British Airways soon after. They produced the consumer launch campaign \\"Stop dreaming. Start Collecting\\", gaining a database of three million Air Miles collectors in the first three months. Keith Mills later founded the Nectar loyalty card. Operations in the UK commenced in November 1988. In 2007, the United Kingdom Air Miles business had eight million customers. Airmiles could be collected through Lloyds TSB Airmiles Duo credit card accounts, Shell petrol stations, Tesco supermarkets (50 airmiles for every ¬£2.50 in Tesco ClubCard vouchers), Southern Electric, travel products, package holidays purchased from Air Miles and over 100 online retailers. The British program had an online shopping portal including retailers such as eBay and Currys. Airmiles could be redeemed for flights with British Airways and other airlines, Eurostar and ferry crossings, cruises, hotel accommodation, car hire, travel insurance, package holidays, spa and golf breaks and leisure activities. It was based in Crawley. Air Miles was a subsidiary of British Airways, but the airline also operated a different scheme for its frequent flyers called BA Miles. In September 2011 Air Miles announced that it would be rebranding to Avios and that taxes and charges would then be chargeable, quoting ¬£497 for a return flight to Sydney; many previous users expressed regret and anger over this. The Airmiles scheme was combined with BA Miles and ended at midnight 14 November.  Air Miles United States  An Air Miles program was launched in the United States in 1992 by Loyalty Management Group. Participating companies included Lenscrafters, General Cinema, AT&T; Corporation, and Citibank. Unlike its Canadian counterpart, the U.S. program was unsuccessful and suspended operations in May 1993.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed June 30, 2011 long and joins the Kennebec River at Merrymeeting Bay in Maine before its water empties into the Gulf of Maine on the Atlantic Ocean. Its drainage basin is in area. The name \\"Androscoggin\\" comes from the Eastern Abenaki term /al…ôss√≠k…ënt…ôkw/ or /als√≠k…ënt…ôkw/, meaning \\"river of cliff rock shelters\\" (literally \\"thus-deep-dwelling-river\\"); or perhaps from Penobscot /al…ôsstk…ët…ôk ∑/, meaning \\"river of rock shelters\\". The Anglicization of the Abenaki term is likely an analogical contamination with the colonial governor Edmund Andros.Dean R. Snow, \\"Eastern Abenaki\\", in Handbook of North American Indians, ed. Bruce G. Trigger (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, 1978), 15:146. Course The Androscoggin flowing past Lewiston, Maine The Androscoggin begins in Errol, New Hampshire, where the Magalloway River joins the outlet of Umbagog Lake. The river flows generally south but with numerous bends past the towns of Errol and Milan and the city of Berlin before turning east at the town of Gorham, New Hampshire, to cut across the northern end of the White Mountains and enter Maine. Continuing east, the river passes the towns of Bethel, Rumford, and Dixfield before turning south at the town of Livermore Falls and leaving the mountains behind. The river passes through the twin cities of Lewiston and Auburn, turns southeast, passes the community of Lisbon Falls and reaches tidewater just below the final falls in the town of Brunswick. Merrymeeting Bay is a freshwater estuary where the Androscoggin meets the Kennebec River nearly inland from the Atlantic Ocean. Water quality The Androscoggin was once heavily polluted by a variety of textile mills, paper mills, and other industries located along its banks, and helped inspire the Clean Water Act. The river has benefited greatly from environmental work and the departure of certain types of industry from the region. As a result, the amount of contaminated wastewater being released into the river has greatly decreased. However, several mills still release chemical waste into the river, albeit in much smaller amounts. From the 1940s through the 2000s, the Androscoggin was so polluted that some environmental groups listed it as one of the 20 most polluted rivers in the United States. The pollution became so severe that until very recently, one stretch required oxygen bubblers to prevent fish from suffocating. As of May 2007, environmental groups had a lawsuit pending, in an attempt to force the paper mills located along the river to clean their waste streams. Most companies have agreed to slow the amount of wastewater discharge, but only a few have completely stopped, with other companies citing cost as a prime factor for continued pollution. On April 15, 2020, a large explosion occurred at the Verso Paper Mill, located on the river. It is unknown what impacts, either negative or positive, the explosion and the mill's indefinite closing will have on water quality.https://wgme.com/news/local/reports-of-explosion-at-jay- millhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/paper-mill-explosion-jay-maine-today/ Streamflow The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) maintains four river flow gauges on the Androscoggin River. All four are below one or more dams. The first is at Errol, New Hampshire (), where the watershed is . Flow here has ranged from 16,500 to 0 ft¬≥/s (467 and 0 m¬≥/s) (zero flow when dam closed). The mean annual flow between 1905 and 2005 is 1,919 ft¬≥/s (54.3 m¬≥/s). The second is near Gorham, New Hampshire (), where the watershed is . Flow here has ranged from 21,900 to a mean daily low of 795 ft¬≥/s (620 and 22.5 m¬≥/s) (lows when dam closed). The mean annual flow between 1905 and 2005 is 2,512 ft¬≥/s (71 m¬≥/s). The third is at Rumford, Maine (), where the watershed is . Flow here has ranged from 74,000 to 625 ft¬≥/s (2,094 and 17.7 m¬≥/s). The mean annual flow between 1905 and 2005 is 3,801 ft¬≥/s (107.6 m¬≥/s). The fourth is at Auburn, Maine (), where the watershed is . Flow here has ranged from 135,000 to 340 ft¬≥/s (3,820.5 and 9.6 m¬≥/s). Recreation=Angling The Androscoggin River is a popular fishing destination for anglers. The upper section of the river offers good fly fishing for brook, rainbow and brown trout. Landlocked salmon can also be caught in the far northern portions of the river near Errol, New Hampshire. As the river progresses south and east of the White Mountains, the river widens some and the water quality becomes more acidic. As a result of these changes, the trout and salmon fisheries vanish almost entirely in the central and lower portions of the river. However, these sections often contain trophy smallmouth bass fisheries. Northern pike also inhabit the lower sections, with quality specimens being reported for this species as well. Other species found in the lower portions include redbreast sunfish, yellow perch and white suckers. Paddling Paddling near the Free-Black Bridge in Brunswick, Maine The Androscoggin River Watershed Council, a local nonprofit, has been working to establish a water trail along the entire length of the river. The trail will provide improved portages and access sites for paddling, fishing, and boating. There are currently over 40 mapped public access sites to the river. The Androscoggin Riverlands State Park in Maine is a popular area for paddling. It consists of along the western shoreline of the river just east of Turner. History Stereoscopic image \\"Under the bridge at Berlin Falls\\", by the Bierstadt Brothers The ancient name for the river was Pescedona, which is Abenaki for \\"a branch\\". According to the USGS, variant names for the Androscoggin River include Amasagu'nteg, Amascongan, Ambrose Coggin, Ammeriscoggin, Ammoscoggin, Amos Coggin, Amoscommun, Anasagunticook, Anconganunticook, Andrews Coggin, Andros Coggan, Andros Coggin, Androscoggen, Andrus Coggin, Aumoughcaugen, and Ameriscoggin River.

After a series of flagrant violation against basic human rights a feeling of incertitude regarding the direction the country is emerging, sometimes comparing the situation to a newborn Burma. In its report on Cambodia, Human Rights Watch stated that \\"Authorities continue to ban or disperse most public demonstrations. Politicians and journalists critical of the government face violence and intimidation and are barred from equal access to the broadcast media. In addition, the judiciary remains weak and subject to political influence. Sex trafficking in Cambodia of women and children through networks protected or backed by police or government officials is rampant. The government continues to turn a blind eye to fraudulent confiscation of farmers‚Äô land, illegal logging, and widespread plundering of natural resources.‚Äù The current state of the country could be described as a semblance of pluralistic democracy. In July 2004, the royalist opposition party FUNCINPEC formed a coalition government with the Cambodian People Party (CPP) after a political deadlock of more than a year. More recently, Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) members have been targeted for criminal prosecutions, after seeing the parliamentarian immunity of several SRP members lifted by a criticized closed-door hand vote with members of the parliament. The NGO Human Rights Watch offers this assessment of the current state of affairs in Cambodia: > Prime Minister Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge commander, has been in power > since 1985. His rule has relied on security force violence and politically > motivated persecution of opposition members, activists, and human rights > workers. Security forces commit killings and torture with impunity. > Authorities regularly restrict the right to peaceful assembly by suppressing > protests and banning nonviolent gatherings and processions. The politically > powerful have carried out forced evictions and illegal land grabs for > decades. Government officials and judges are mired in corruption. Garment > industry workers, primarily women, are subject to sexual discrimination and > other rights abuses. Historical background Human rights in Cambodia may be seen in the context of both its traditions deriving primarily from Indian culture and its absolute rule of god-kings, and Buddhism, the main religion within Cambodian society. In more modern times, the country has been greatly influenced by French colonialism and a half century of radical change from constitutional monarchy, to a presidential regime under Lon Nol, a radical Marxism-Leninism under the Khmer Rouge, a Vietnamese occupation under the communist party People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), and finally the restoration of constitutional monarchy under a United Nations administered transition (UNTAC), a result of the Paris Agreement signed in 1991. Under the Khmer Rouge, extensive violations of human rights were committed.Ben Kiernan. 2008. The Pol Pot regime: race, power, and genocide in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, 544 pages The Paris Agreement required that the Constitution include \\"basic principles, including those regarding human rights and fundamental freedoms ...\\" The Paris Agreement also required Cambodia ‚Äúto take effective measures to ensure that the policies and practices of the past shall never be allowed to return.\\" The Constitution of 1993 does indeed contain a chapter on \\"The Rights and Obligations of Khmer Citizens\\" consisting of twenty articles (Articles 31-50), seventeen of which relate to rights and three to duties. In compliance with the requirement of the Paris Agreement that the constitution provide that \\"[a]ggrieved individuals will be entitled to have the courts adjudicate and enforce these rights\\" and that \\"[a]n independent judiciary will be established, empowered to enforce the rights provided under the constitution\\", the Constitution stipulates that Khmer citizens have the right to denounce, make complaints or file claims against the state of state agents, the settlement of which should be determined by the courts. Since the adoption of the Constitution in 1993, the UN appointed a Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Human Rights in Cambodia and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights opened a Cambodian office. These institutions alongside local and international human rights groups have documented a wide range of human rights violations, with limited results, in terms of reform and redress. Issues=Freedom of expression and assembly Violations of freedom of expression, including lack of access to the media, are endemic. More recently, what was decried as a campaign against freedom of expression marked an accelerating backward slide in Cambodia's efforts to promote human rights values. There are severe restrictions on freedom of assembly, granted by the Cambodian Constitution, is also being perceived by local organizations as a deliberate campaign to repress Cambodian civil society to grow and voice their concern. On 14 March 2018, the UN expert on the human rights situation in Cambodia Professor Rhona Smith of United Kingdom, \\"expressed serious concerns about restrictions on the media, freedom of expression and political participation ahead of a national election in July, calling on the Government to choose the path of human rights.\\" She urged the authorities to lift the ban on 118 politicians participating in politics.\\"Cambodia at a crossroads‚Äù:\\" UN expert calls on Government to choose path of human rights ‚ÄúCambodia at a crossroads‚Äù: UN expert calls on Government to choose path of human rights Soy Sros, a Cambodian woman who makes bags for international fashion brands like Michael Kors and Kate Spade, worked at the Superl factory in Kampong Speu Province. On 4 April 2020, Soy was sent to prison for a Facebook post in which she wrote about her concerns that workers from her factory would be laid off in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. She was interrogated by several police for more than 48 hours. \\"There were several policemen in the interrogation room, and they asked me if I wanted attention, or to be famous, whether I was trying to incite somebody,\\" Soy said. \\"They called me names, offended my dignity as a woman.\\" Soon after, Soy was thrown into the Kampong Speu prison. Superl's initial charges against Soy claimed that she had posted fake news and defamed the factory. But the court that was looking into her case also charged her with two criminal offenses, provocation and discrimination. If Soy were found guilty, she faced up to three years in prison and a fine of up to six million riels (approximately US$1,500). She was jailed for two months. Weak Judiciary System Efforts to establish an independent judiciary have been considerable for over a decade but have not yet achieved hoped-for results. The judiciary remains corrupt, inefficient, and mostly controlled by the ruling party CPP. Flagrant violations of human rights by state agents have been identified but prosecutions have been rare. Arbitrary arrests are also practiced by the CPP government using a politically controlled court as a mean to strengthen its grip on power. In 2006 the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ruled that 'the detention of Sam Rainsy Party MP Cheam Channy is in violation of both Cambodian and international law'. Women's Rights Gender roles in Cambodia are strict and domestic violence against women is a very serious problem. But for several years, the Cambodian Ministry of Women's Affairs has shown a considerable commitment in the fight against gender-specific and domestic violence, even making it a national Millinnium Development Goal. LGBT Rights Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Cambodians suffer from discrimination and abuse; including violence, workplace discrimination, and social and familial exclusion.'Coming Out in the Kingdom', Cambodian Center for Human Rights, 9 December 2010. In 2010, the Cambodian Center for Human Rights established the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) Project to empower LGBT people throughout Cambodia to advocate for their rights and to improve respect for LGBT people throughout Cambodia.SOGI Project, website of the Cambodian Center for Human Rights.'Not easy to be out in the Kingdom', Phnom Penh Post, 10 May 2010. \\"There‚Äôs not very much information out there at all ... I don‚Äôt think anyone really knows what the general everyday situation is for the gay community in Cambodia, and I think that‚Äôs because they‚Äôve been afraid to speak out‚Äù - Rupert Abbott.'Human Rights for Everyone', press statement, Cambodian Center for Human Rights et al, 16 May 2010. In December 2010, the Cambodian Center for Human Rights published a ground breaking report on the situation of LGBT people in Cambodia. Same-sex sexual acts are not a criminal offence in Cambodia. However, there is no anti-discrimination legislation, or other sanctions for those who violate the rights of LGBTI people. Further, marriage is limited strictly to opposite-sex couples. This definition is also used in the Law on Marriage and Family, where article 3 reads: ‚Äòmarriage is a solemn contract between a man and a woman‚Äô, and in article 6 ‚Äùmarriages are prohibited between persons of the same sex‚Äù. The Constitution extends its rights and freedoms to every citizen, regardless of ‚Äòrace, colour, sex‚Ä¶ or other status‚Äô ‚Äì a phrasing that can be used in favour of LGBTI persons‚Äô rights, given its intent to provide equality regardless of personal characteristics. With widespread corruption and a long road ahead for Cambodia to become a constitutional state, LGBTI persons face the same type of difficulties as other citizens, where rule of law is weak. In addition, they are also targets of extortion related to their LGBTI identities The most common situation where LGBTI persons face poor attitudes from authorities is when police target lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) individuals for financial gain. There are two provisions: ‚ÄòHuman trafficking law‚Äô and ‚ÄòCommune and village safety policy‚Äô. The police have used these to arrest people (mostly transgender and gay men) under false charges and claim a payment (between US$10 and 30) not to keep them overnight. Transgender sex workers are frequently abused by the police. UNDP reports that local authorities and police sometimes use various laws to limit the rights of LGBTI people; for example through forced separation of same-sex couples, as per parental request, or linking of LGBTI people with drug use or sex work Issues related to LGBTI persons‚Äô living conditions and rights are overall absent from political and media discourse in Cambodia. There are a few cases where LGBTI matters have made it to the public agenda, with officials both speaking in favour and against LGBTI rights. There is no legal group yet to protect LGBT who are victims of legal abuses as well as human right violations. October 2014 a lesbian couple got married but police and commune officials stop them from getting married while their both family still continued and committed to make the marriage happened in cultural way. Article in Khmer http://kohsantepheapdaily.com.kh/article/106818.html#.VDzqBB_UM98.facebook Forced evictions Human rights activists are increasingly worried that [forced eviction]s in Cambodia are spiralling out of control. An Amnesty International report shows how,amnesty.org contrary to Cambodia's obligations under international human rights law, those affected by evictions have had no opportunity for genuine participation and consultation beforehand. Information on planned evictions and on resettlement packages has been incomplete and inaccurate, undermining the rights of those affected to information, and to participate in decisions which affect the exercise of their human rights, in particular the right to adequate housing. The lack of legal protection from forced eviction, and lack of regulation of existing standards has left an accountability gap which increases the vulnerability of marginalized people, particularly those living in poverty, to human rights abuses including forced evictions. Other Other serious and persistent human rights problems include unresolved political murder, abuse of unionists and opposition politicians. Amongst several unresolved assassinations, the murder of union leader Chea Vichea received strong international coverage by major human rights and labour organizations, and the United Nations. Land confiscations, arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, forced child labor, trafficking in women and children, discrimination and domestic violence against women, and abuse of children are also affecting Cambodians. Current Issues Current issues of particular concerns are the forcible repatriation of Vietnamese Montagnard asylum seekers by the Cambodian government and an alarming number of land issues throughout the country. Across Cambodia, authorities routinely detain alleged drug users, homeless people, \\"street\\" children, sex workers, and people perceived to have disabilities in a \\"haphazard system of detention centers around the country\\". Some of those detention centres are ostensibly for drug treatment, while others are ostensibly for \\"social rehabilitation\\". In addition to Prey Speu, the Ministry of Social Affairs also has authority for the Phnom Bak centre in Sisophon town, Banteay Meanchey province, and manages a drug detention centre with the military on a military base in Koh Kong town, Koh Kong province. There are \\"a further six drug detention centers\\" in Cambodia \\"that each year hold at least 2,000 people without due process\\". Events of 2013. Amnesty International and the Cambodian Center for Human Rights, located in Cambodia, also raised 'impunity' as a concern. \\"Impunity for perpetrators of human rights abuses and lack of an independent judiciary remained serious problems,\\" Amnesty's 2012 Annual Report said. Since June, NGOs reported that authorities \\"abused at least 30 prisoners ‚Äì 29 while in police custody and one in prison. Kicking, punching and pistol whipping were the most common methods of reported physical abuse, but electric shock, suffocation, caning and whipping with wires were also used.\\" The US State Department report says \\"politicized and ineffective judiciary is one of the country's key human rights abuses.\\" That report says \\"the government generally does not respect judicial independence, and that there has been widespread corruption among judges, prosecutors and court officials.\\" \\"Human Rights Watch documented how guards and staff at informal detention centers \\"whip detainees with rubber water hoses, beat them with bamboo sticks or palm fronds, shock them with electric batons, sexually abuse them, and punish them with physical exercises intended to cause intense physical pain.\\" Informal detainees held in extra judicial centres have been forced to work on construction sites, including in at least one instance to help build a hotel. There are documented cases in Cambodia of people committing murder and then paying state officials so as not to be prosecuted. \\"Impunity enjoyed by the rich and powerful helps explain a lack of public trust in Cambodia's judicial and law enforcement institutions.\\"Doyle, Kevin (7 December 2014) Cambodia's culture of impunity: What price for a life?.

Even after their daughter is no longer a virgin, parents may continue to sell their daughters into sex slavery. According to ABC News, it was during a brutal and lawless period, following the fall of the Khmer Rouge, that child sex slavery began to flourish. Other slaves in Cambodia are forced to make bricks.

Built in Bayonne, France, the original P√©lican was launched in January 1693. A 500-ton ship fitted with 50 guns and commanded by Captain Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, she ran aground on the shores of Hudson Bay a few days after a heroic battle in 1697, badly damaged by the encounter and by a fierce storm. In five short months the ship's place in history had been assured, as the victor in the greatest naval battle in the history of New France. History=Nine Years' War Upon learning that the English were planning to maintain control of Hudson Bay, French King Louis XIV assembled a fleet of warships, consisting of the P√©lican, the Palmier, the Wesp, and the Profond. The goal was to recapture Fort Bourbon, as the French called York Factory, Manitoba, the heart of the fur trade. P√©lican set sail from France on 8 April 1697. On the morning of 5 September 1697 in present-day Canada, temporarily separated from her sister ships, she came face to face with three English ships - the Hampshire, the Dering, and the Hudson Bay - which were carrying supplies to the nearby fort. Although they were outnumbered, the crew of the P√©lican engaged in battle and triumphed. The ship, however, was fatally damaged in the battle. With holes below the waterline, P√©lican had to be abandoned; it was run aground on 8 September. The P√©licans victory, later known as Battle of Hudson's Bay, was certainly due in large part to the leadership of Captain Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville. In addition to setting an example of courage and valour for his crew, he fought a remarkable strategic battle - with the result that the Hampshire sank, the Dering retreated, and the Hudson Bay was captured complete with its cargo.  Le P√©lican (1992)  Three centuries later, an authentic replica of the Pelican was built in La Malbaie, Quebec. Construction began in 1987, but the project encountered many problems. In 1991, the architect Fran√ßois Cordeau was removed from the project management. The concept was then changed quite a bit. The wooden hull gave way to steel, up to the waterline. AML Naval Shipyard remade the ship's bottom. All sorts of other important changes reinforced the vessel. The ship was completed in 1992. For two years, the Pelican II was in the Old Port of Montreal as a museum but it was sold to a Louisiana company in 1995. The ship was placed in the port of New Orleans from 1995 to 2002. It was then moved to Donaldsonville, Louisiana, farther up the Mississippi River, where it became the property of the Fort Butler Foundation. It sank once in 2002 and was refloated. It was struck by a tugboat in 2004, and the city decided not to raise the ship. On 19 January 2008, a barge towboat struck P√©lican II again. Fuel leaking from the towboat caused the river to be closed to boat traffic. Half of the hull of the ship was made of metal, so that lifting her out of the water became a problem. Today not much is left of the ship except for a marker.

The population in 2011 was 1,123,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of .Eurostat It contains the localities Ch√£ das Machadas, Lomba dos Homens, Lombinha and Mosteiros. History It was only around 1480, that the first people began to settle this part of the island, mostly by the maritime access, for many years. The community of Mosteiros was built on ancestral fishing for many years, even as its territory was cultivated by farmers. The name Mosteiros, meaning monastery in the Portuguese language, refers to nearby islets: the largest of these islets is shaped like a church.DRAC (2010), p.30 As Gaspar Frutuoso noted: :\\"Between the large islet and ponta Ruiva, by the cliffs, until the promontory of Escalvados, there are some large depressions and well made fumaroles, in the form of a church, or monasteries, or of both things, that older settlers called the monasteries [Mosteiros], situated on the faj√£ that ran from the peak in Sete Cidades\\". The parochial church, dedicated to Our Lady of the Conception, was constructed at various stages and remotes the beginning of the 17th century. Today, these activities have been complemented by tourist- related activities. Geography Mosteiros is located in the northwestern part of the island of S√£o Miguel, connected by the Estrada Regional 1-1¬™ roadway to Ponta Delgada in the southeast and Ribeira Grande in the northeast. The main village is located on a faj√£ at the tip of the island, surrounded by coastal cliffs that reach . The parish is primarily recognizable by a group of islets that lie offshore: two small islets to the northwest, and a group in the southwest, including one further west and two smaller islets, slightly east of the large islet. The development of the community has been highlighted by the construction of two triatos or imp√©rios, associated with Cult of the Holy Spirit: the Imp√©ro da Grota (located in the garden near the main Church) and the Imp√©rio das Lombas (raised over the old structure). In addition, several reparations were completed on the school Escola Comendador √Çngelo Jos√© Dias, the seat of the parish, philharmonic band and extension of the ETAR (sewage and drainage). The Jardim da Eira Velha, a greenspace in the community was also elaborated, overlooking the sea and fishing port, in addition to the changing rooms of the football field. The conclusion of the Caminho da Pedra Queimada, which connects the Rua das Pens√µes to the regional roadway (at Lomba dos Homens) was part of an attempt to improve the community's access. This was also the case with the paving and extensions of the Caminho do Concelho, which connects the Ramal dos Mosteiros to Pico de Mafra. Another solution defended by the parish council was the opening of a new road along the cliffs to the top of Rua das Vinhas until Rua Nova, a solution that has the foresight of providing new residential homes. Economy Agriculture dominates in the interior, with herding of dairy cattle and the cultivation of some fruits and vegetables. Culture The festivities in honour of the patron saint occur on the third Sunday of August.

The group is part of the Redland City with a permanent population of 6,153 as of the (was 4,240 as of the ). However, nearly one-third of all dwellings on the islands were unoccupied, suggesting a high proportion of \\"second homes\\" are maintained by people elsewhere on the night of the census. Demography and development The four inhabited Bay Islands in 2016 were: *Karragarra, population 204 *Lamb, population 432 *Russell, population 2836 *Macleay, population 2681 The four inhabited Bay Islands in 2006 were: *Karragarra, population 125 *Lamb, population 373 *Russell, population 1,776 *Macleay, population 1,957 Tiny Perulpa Island is joined by a causeway to Macleay and is generally regarded as part of Macleay. In 2007, after a national A Current Affair television news segment, the islands received an enormous amount of interest as having the cheapest land in Australia. Russell and Macleay have most basic services such as supermarkets, restaurants, primary schools, doctors, police, ambulance, fire brigade, SES, clubs and pubs. Lamb Island has a kiosk with basic supplies and convenience items. Karragarra has no shops at all, which is preferred by the residents. Originally subdivided in the early 1970s, a bridge was promised by the then government. This never eventuated and residents are now feeling the pressure of transport to the mainland for some shopping trips, as mainland parking has become very scarce. The Bay Islands enjoy a quiet, relaxed lifestyle with many retirees, pensioners and more recently, an influx of younger families looking for some safety and security, away from the hustle and bustle of the mainland. The inhabited Southern Moreton Bay Islands are not part of the Southern Moreton Bay Islands National Park, which is also located within Redland City. Heritage listings Lamb Island has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Lucas Drive: Lamb Island Pioneer Hall * Mango Trees on Tina Avenue which were planted over 100 years ago * Jetty Shed which has been restored by the local island community group and was used for loading local produce onto the merchant boats Macleay Island has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Cliff Terrace: Industrial Ruins, Macleay Island Transportation The islands have a frequent scheduled vehicle barge provided by Stradbroke Ferries and fast passenger ferries services provided by Bay Islands Transit, leaving from Redland Bay. Passenger services from Redland Bay to the islands were added to the TransLink network in 2013, allowing passengers to use go cards to ride the ferries. The spectacular Canaipa Passage between North Stradbroke and Russell is a favourite destination for private boats Telecommunications The Four Islands are served by two telephone exchanges. Macleay and Lamb Islands are served by the Macleay Island Exchange, while Karragarra and Russell Islands are served by Russell Island Exchange. The exchanges do not have direct backhaul to the mainland, but are instead connected via Microwave to other larger exchanges. Call Handling is done by the Woolloongabba Exchange. ADSL Internet has been available to the Islands from 2004/2005 and are capable of ADSL2+ Speeds. Wireless Broadband is available, however several residents report poor reception in some bushy areas. This was combated on Macleay Island by having the Radio Masts raised slightly. Due to the small-size of the exchange footprint on Russell and Karragarra Islands, some residents are not able to receive ADSL, this is due to the copper line's length being beyond maximum standards (5 km). Mainly people living off Centre Road and Canaipa Road. Residents have lobbied Telstra to install Roadside Cabinets at some of the worst affected areas, so that they can receive Internet services, but have been repeatedly ignored. Most residents outside the Exchange Footprint for ADSL have to resort to Wireless Broadband, and in many cases Satellite Internet. This also applies to Macleay and Lamb Islands as well. Foxtel Digital PayTV is available via satellite. The National Broadband Network became available on the islands in June 2020, in both fibre to the curb and fibre to the node, depending on the street.

Early life and entry into the family business Hulman was born in 1901 in Terre Haute. He was educated at St. Benedict's School at Terre Haute, Lawrenceville School in New Jersey and Worcester Academy in Massachusetts. Hulman participated in the high hurdles and the pole vault at Worcester. He served with the American Red Cross Ambulance Corps during World War I at the age of 17. Upon graduation from Yale's Sheffield Scientific School in 1924, Hulman returned to Terre Haute to work for Hulman & Company, the family business run by his father Anton Hulman, Sr. However, Anton, Sr. told his managers, \\"Don't give Tony a place in the business. Let him work for it.\\" Despite this, Tony rose far and fast. By 1926, he was the company's sales manager, and by 1931, at the age of 30, succeeded his father as company president. Clabber Girl Hulman's first project was developing a 10-year plan for an ad campaign that would take Clabber Girl's top product, baking powder, to national prominence. Salesmen traveled around the country posting billboards along the roadside and going door-to-door inviting women to try Clabber Girl, which successfully boosted product sales. An original billboard that reads \\"Five Minutes to Terre Haute, Home of Clabber Girl Baking Powder\\" and has a clock at the top is still visible along US 40 outside of Terre Haute, Indiana and is considered a local landmark. Indianapolis Motor Speedway Roadway sign located at a rest stop on Interstate 70 in Indiana depicting the Anton \\"Tony\\" Hulman Jr. Memorial Way Hulman is probably best known for buying the dilapidated Indianapolis Motor Speedway from a group led by World War I flying ace Eddie Rickenbacker immediately after World War II, seeing it as a way to promote Clabber Girl. Influenced by three-time Indy 500 winner Wilbur Shaw (who became the track's president in the early years of the Hulman regime), Hulman made numerous improvements to the track in time for the race to be held in 1946. Following Shaw's death in a plane crash on October 30, 1954, Hulman stepped into his soon-to-be-familiar role as the \\"face\\" of the Speedway. He followed the tradition of launching the Indianapolis 500 with the command, \\"Gentlemen, start your engines!\\" Into the 1970s, despite the fact he'd given the command so many times before, he would always practice it extensively beforehand, and on race day, he would invariably pull a card containing the famous words: \\"Gentlemen, start your engines!\\" from the pocket of his suit as he stepped to the microphone. Luke Walton, who with Wilbur Shaw had founded the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network, was for many years a sportscaster and worked annually with Hulman (and later with Mrs. Hulman) to ensure each word was delivered with the proper emphasis. Family and philanthropy Hulman married Mary Fendrich, the daughter of Fendrich Cigar Company owner John H. Fendrich, in 1926. Their first child, a daughter named Mary, died just hours after her birth in 1930. In 1934, the couple's second daughter, also named Mary, but better known as \\"Mari\\", was born. Mari would later give Tony and Mary four grandchildren. Their sole grandson, Anton Hulman \\"Tony\\" George, would carry on the family's racing and business traditions. The Hulmans were well known in Indiana for their philanthropy and dedication to higher education; Terre Haute's Rose Polytechnic Institute received gifts of millions of dollars over the years. The Hulmans' generosity led the board of Rose Polytechnic to rename the school Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in the couple's honor in 1971. Indiana State's Hulman Center arena (opened in 1973) and Hulman Memorial Student Union (completed in the mid-1990s) for the couple carry the Hulman name in recognition of the family's donations for their construction. Mari Hulman George established a Center for Equine Studies at Saint Mary-of-the- Woods College, west of Terre Haute. Terre Haute's Hulman Links public golf course is situated on over of land donated by Hulman in the early 1970s; however, the course was not completed until after his death. Death The 1977 \\"500\\" would be memorable for many for two reasons. A. J. Foyt won his fourth \\"500\\" that day, and Foyt asked Hulman to accompany him in the pace car for the victory lap. The pair were photographed smiling and waving to the fans. It was the first time Hulman had ever taken a victory lap with the winner, and he would not live to do so again. At 76 years old, Hulman appeared to be in good health; he was always busy maintaining his business interests in Indianapolis and Terre Haute. In mid-October 1977, he hosted the annual Speedway press dinner. A few days later, though, he and his close friend, Hoosier sportscaster Chris Schenkel, were the grand marshals for the Fall Festival parade in nearby Martinsville, Indiana, where Hulman refused Schenkel's offer of his coat in the cool autumn weather. On the night of October 27, 1977, Hulman died of heart failure caused by a ruptured aortic aneurysmHulman, Voice of Indy, Dies on the operating table in St. Vincent's Hospital in Indianapolis. He is buried in Calvary Cemetery today, along with other members of his family. Award He was inducted in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of AmericaTony Hulman at the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1991. He is a member of the Indiana Football Hall of Fame. He was inducted in the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1990. Other business interests Hulman went on a buying spree beginning in the 1930s, purchasing a string of Coca-Cola bottling plants across Indiana (which were later consolidated to Indianapolis), utility companies, newspapers, radio and television stations including Terre Haute's WTHI, WTHI-FM and WTHI-TV, and a great deal of real estate. In recent years, however, as the family has concentrated primarily on the Speedway and racing-related businesses, they have slowly begun to divest themselves of some of Hulman's real estate holdings and \\"non-core\\" businesses, such as Wabash Valley Broadcasting, their radio and television holding company, which was sold to Emmis Communications in 1997. Emmis sold WTHI-TV and several of their other television stations to LIN TV Corporation in 2005. Wabash Valley Broadcasting was originally started by Terre Haute, IN. attorney Raymond J. Kearns, whom was the president of WVB. Shortly after Wabash Valley Broadcasting was incorporated, Anton \\"Tony\\" Hulman, Jr. became a stockholder. The company (Wabash Valley Broadcasting) started radio station WTHI-AM, which went on air January 1948 as an ABC affiliate. Hulman later headed a small group of men who purchased the holdings of all original shareholders. Hulman & Co. then sold Wabash Valley Broadcasting to Emmis Broadcasting in a $90 million deal, Wabash Valley Broadcasting consisted of television station WTHI, radio stations WTHI-FM, WTHI-AM and WWVR-FM as well as television station WFTX in Fort Myers, FL. One such property that the family owned for years that became the subject of much speculation and scorn was the land occupied by the former Terre Haute House hotel, which stood at the northeast corner of Seventh Street and Wabash Avenue in Terre Haute (the historic former \\"Crossroads of America\\" junction of U.S. Highways 40 and 41). Hulman purchased the hotel in 1959 and closed it to the public in 1970. Noted for the rich and famous (as well as infamous) who stayed there during the hotel's early years, the hotel was the target of numerous attempts at revitalization between 1970 and 2005, with the city of Terre Haute taking a purchase option on the property in 2004 in an effort to finally make something happen. None came to fruition, and in the fall of 2005, the Hulman family (through Terre Haute Realty Corp.) sold the hotel and two other historic buildings to a limited liability corporation, Seventh & Wabash, LLC, owned by Terre Haute developer, Greg Gibson, who demolished the structures for redevelopment. A new hotel, the Hilton Garden Inn ‚Äì Terre Haute House, opened in the fall of 2007. Namesake grandson carries on the Speedway tradition Hulman's grandson, Anton Hulman \\"Tony\\" George, is the former president and CEO of the Speedway and the Indy Racing League. Tidbits and trivia * The call letters for Hulman's WTHI television and radio stations have been, on occasion, said to stand for \\"With Tony Hulman's Interest,\\" although it seems more likely that the letters stand for Terre Haute, Indiana. * Most of the construction and improvement projects at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway during the Hulman years were \\"handshake deals,\\" done without a contract. Hulman preferred to do it that way, always pointing out that he wasn't in it for the money; he just wanted to deliver the best racing experience possible. * He was a member of Theta Chi fraternity during his time at Indiana State University * Hulman joined a number of other successful businessmen by appearing in magazine advertisements for Lord Calvert Canadian Whisky under its slogan \\"for men of distinction.\\" The ad became the foundation for a 1956 collage by Jess Collins called \\"Lord Pervert,\\" which mocks Whittaker Chambers. * A portion of Interstate 70 east of Indianapolis, Indiana has been designated the \\"Anton Tony Hulman Jr. Memorial Way\\".

He also plays jazz, progressive rock, and world fusion.  Early life and background  Prasanna grew up in Chennai, India and fell in love with the guitar at age of five after hearing his neighbor play. He received his first guitar when he was ten years old and would try to play Tamil and Hindi film songs and imitate the sounds of his sister's Carnatic singing with the instrument. Prasanna's interest in Western pop music developed when his father's colleague gave him some cassette tapes with songs by the Bee Gees, ABBA, Toto, Peaches and Herb, and the Pointer Sisters. While still in high school he began making a reputation as a guitarist with local band XIth Commandment. During his years studying naval architecture at Indian institute of Technology, Madras (where he also met his wife Shalini), he toured India with his rock bands (The Haze and then Shakuni & the Birds of Prey), covering songs by Santana, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Rush, Steely Dan, Jethro Tull, and the Scorpions and compositions like \\"Peaceful\\" and \\"Blues for Saraswati\\". Prasanna's musical development led him to blues and jazz. After working as a software consultant, he gave up a career in engineering and IT and moved to Boston to attend Berklee College of Music where he majored in Jazz and Classical Composition.

It is number 38 in order of height, and one of the easier hikes of the Adirondack Forty-Sixers. It is named after Noah Porter, one of the first to climb it, later president of Yale University. It is often climbed to with Cascade Mountain. While it lacks the pseudo-alpine open summit of Cascade, there are nevertheless wide views available from the summit, particularly of the Johns Brook Valley to the east (which Porter blocks from Cascade); it is often less crowded than Cascade. A yellow-blazed trail leaves the trail to Cascade about short of that mountain's summit, and leads down into the mountain pass between the two peaks about to Porter's summit. It is also possible to follow this trail from its other terminus, over neighboring Blueberry Mountain from Keene Valley, although that involves a greater vertical ascent and a longer trip. The trailhead to Blueberry Mountain and subsequently Porter Mountain is accessible from a parking lot next to Marcy Airfield on route 73.

The van was produced by Citro√´n between 1939 and 1941. In May 1941 an upgraded version, the Citro√´n TUC replaced the TUB, but by the end of that year the last of these vans had probably been produced. The TUB is the first commercial vehicle ever equipped with a lateral sliding door. Origins Pierre Michelin and Pierre-Jules Boulanger were parachuted in to take charge of Citro√´n by Michelin following their acquisition of the bankrupt auto-maker in December 1934. During the Summer of 1936 Boulanger received the results of an extensive investigation of customer requirements that he had commissioned. The exercise had been undertaken in preparation for the development of a van of approximately capacity - slightly more than the load that could be accommodated by a simple car based van. Boulanger accumulated a fat dossier of photographs, statistics, sketches and comments. From this he laid down a specification which, characteristically, was both simple and demanding. In order to maximise available load space, the new van must position the driver as far forwards as possible on the chassis. It should be possible to stand up in the vehicle, and the load area should be directly accessible from the driving seat, without any need to get out of the vehicle. In addition to conventionally positioned doors at the back, the load area of the new van should have a door on the pavement side in order to facilitate loading and unloading. The decision had already been taken to base the new van on the running gear of the company's recently introduced front-engined front-wheel drive Citro√´n Traction, which would make it easier to meet Boulanger's brief because, in the absence of any under-floor drive shaft, the floor of the load space could be kept low. The van The Citro√´n product development department had the first prototype running by the Autumn of 1937, and on 12 May 1939 the van was homologated for sale in the French market. Although low floored vans with the driver set well forwards and sliding side-door on the pavement side would have become relatively mainstream twenty years later, in the 1930s the radical new van was quite unlike anything else available. The van took its 4-cylinder engine, initially of 1628 cc, from the company's Traction 7C. In the car the engine sat comfortably just behind the front wheels, but in the van most of the engine's weight, along with the driver's feet, was ahead of the front wheels. The driver's cab was raised sufficiently to allow most of the mechanical elements to be installed beneath it, although the engine itself intruded from the front into the central portion of the cab. The floor of the load area was just 42 cm (16 inches) above ground level, and it was possible for anyone less than 175 cm tall to stand in it without needing to stoop. Access from the driver's seat to the load area behind was excellent, especially since on the right side of the driver's cab there was normally no second seat fitted. The side door on the pavement side was a sliding door, and in this respect another radical innovation in contemporary terms. The sliding door on the right of the load area was fashioned from light-weight low cost materials. On each side of the load area, the upper side portions of the van's sides consisted tarpaulin-material curtains, incorporating little windows of flexible plastic. Again, the emphasis was on avoiding complexity, saving weight and minimising cost. On the left-side, there being here no side door, the curtain ran the full length of the load area and could be rolled up and fixed to the roof edge, revealing a load space in excess of 6 cubic meters. The overall result was a structure which combined extreme practicality with extreme simplicity. The spare wheel and battery were stored in a locker on the left side of the van, accessible from the outside but completely sealed off from the load area. Production of the van's bodywork was entrusted to a coach building firm called Fernand Gen√®ve. The engine was the 1,628 cc four-cylinder water-cooled unit which by now powered the 7C version of the manufacturer's Traction passenger car, which also provided the van's three-speed manual transmission and front torsion-bar suspension and (still innovative) front-wheel drive drive-train. The van's rear suspension came from a very simple leaf-spring arrangement. The carrying capacity was a little greater than had initially been envisaged by Boulanger, which presumably led to a firming of the rear suspension settings. The light weight of the van's body, the lack of weight balance resulting from positioning the engine and driver at the extreme front of the vehicle and the very rudimentary nature of the rear suspension meant that drivers quickly learned that without the weight of a load in the van, it was excessively prone to tail slide. The hydraulic braking system also came from the Traction, though the drum brakes were the slightly larger ones from the 1911 cc Traction 11 version. The 1628 cc TUB went on sale on 5 June 1939, less than four weeks after its homologation. It was priced at 36,000 francs at a time when the base versions of the passenger cars from which it was derived were priced slightly above 26,000 francs. The TUB replaced by the TUC In September 1939 France declared war on Germany, and on 13 February 1940 a replacement version of the van appeared, described as the 11-T s√©rie U. The \\"11\\" in the van's name referred to its promotion to the 11CV taxation class which resulted from an increased engine size, now of 1,911 cc. However, since the new vehicle was clearly an improved version of the Citro√´n TUB, respect for alphabetical logic ensured that it quickly became known as the Citro√´n TUC. The maximum load capacity was unchanged at but there were numerous detailed improvements including, now, the fitting of a second windscreen wiper to match the one on the driver's side of the screen. This may have been the point at which a small protruding ridge appeared beneath the front panel, apparently as a half- hearted acknowledgement that most motor vehicles of this size featured a front bumper. In any event, despite the German invasion in May/June 1940, the TUB continued in production until the Spring of 1941, and the TUC replaced it on the production lines only in May 1941. By now raw materials for civilian product and fuel for civilian transport were rapidly disappearing. Very few TUC vans were actually produced, and production of them formally ceased in December 1941. About 100 models were transformed by Fenwick in 1941‚Äì1942 to be powered by an electric engine. Commercial Probably only about 1,740 of the vans were produced, most of them being the earlier 1628 cc TUB version which may appear a poor return for the effort that Citro√´n committed to the project. Nevertheless, when normal life began to return after the war Citro√´n were quick off the mark in 1946 with the Citro√´n H which was in many ways a slightly larger and less aggressively light-weight version of the TUB. The commercial success of the long-running H van owed much to its 1939 predecessor.

Bauman (born April 4, 1937) is an American lawyer and politician. He is a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Maryland's 1st congressional district (1973‚Äì1981). Bauman was a prominent conservative advocate in the House, legal counsel for The Sovereign Society, and author of financial books. Early life and career Robert Edmund Bauman was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, to an unwed single mother. When a teenager, Bauman moved to Easton, Maryland, where he attended Easton High School until 1953. In 1955, he graduated from the Capitol Page School at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.. He obtained a B.S. in international affairs from the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in 1959, and a J.D. degree from Georgetown University Law Center in 1964. He was admitted to the Maryland Bar in 1964, was later admitted to the District of Columbia bar, and entered into private practice as a lawyer. Representative Bauman, politically known as \\"Bob Bauman,\\" served as a delegate to the Republican National Conventions of 1964, 1972, 1976 and 1980. He was also a member of the Federal Hospital Council of the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare from 1970 to 1973. In 1970, he was elected to the Maryland Senate, where he served as a member from 1971 to 1973. A Roman Catholic, he was married to Carol Dawson, a co-founder of Young Americans for Freedom, with whom he had four children. United States Congress Bauman was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Republican in an August 1973 special election. He replaced William O. Mills, who had committed suicide the previous May. Political positions In Congress, Bauman established a reputation as a staunch conservative, often criticizing the state of morality in the United States. He was a founding member of several conservative activist groups, including the Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) and the American Conservative Union (ACU), and he served both as national chairman. Bauman was also known for his exceptional knowledge of parliamentary procedure and was considered a rising star in the Republican Party in the late 1970s. Scandal On October 3, 1980, while he was running for re-election, Bauman was charged for soliciting sex from a 16-year-old male prostitute. After the charges were made public, Bauman said he was suffering from alcoholism and entered himself into a court-supervised rehabilitation program, which, upon successful completion, resulted in the charges being dropped. Bauman stated he would continue his re- election campaign, and apologized to voters for his indiscretions. Bauman was defeated by Democrat Roy Dyson on November 4, 1980. Dyson was not considered a serious contender for the seat before the charges were filed against Bauman. In 1982, Bauman again ran for the nomination for the House seat he had lost, but withdrew from the race before primary election day. Post-congressional activities Bauman serves as legal counsel for the Sovereign Society, a group dedicated to promoting offshore banking and investment, that funneled clients to the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca to help them avoid paying taxes to the United States government. \\"Our [the Sovereign Society] philosophy is not promoted by tax evasion but tax avoidance,\\" Bauman said in an interview. \\"We serve as a conduit for people who want certain things offshore.\\" Bauman is the author of numerous books on offshore and tax haven issues. He also wrote an autobiography, The Gentleman from Maryland: The Conscience of a Gay Conservative, which was published in 1986.

It is Perry's debut feature film, and the first entry in the Tyler Perry film franchise. Directed by Darren Grant, the film was released in the US on February 25, 2005. It is the only Tyler Perry scripted film not directed by Tyler Perry. It was filmed almost entirely in Fairburn, Georgia. The sequel, Madea's Family Reunion, was released on February 25, 2006. Plot Helen (Kimberly Elise) and Charles McCarter (Steve Harris) have money, success, and a fine home. Their lives are perfect ‚Äì on the surface. Charles, an attorney, is distant, verbally abusive, and has been having multiple affairs, while Helen is unemployed, bored at home, and desperately trying to make her marriage work. On the evening of their 18th wedding anniversary, Helen arrives home to find all her belongings in a U-Haul, and that Charles is kicking her out for Brenda (Lisa Marcos), his young mistress and the mother of his two sons. Helen kicks the driver, Orlando (Shemar Moore), out of the truck and visits her intimidating grandmother, Madea (Tyler Perry). Madea takes Helen in and helps her get back on her feet, to the dismay of Madea's brother, Joe (also Tyler Perry). Joe's son, Brian (also Tyler Perry), acts as Madea and Helen's attorney after Charles and Brenda catch the pair breaking into and vandalizing Charles's mansion. Because Madea is a repeat offender, Judge Mablean Ephriam places her under house arrest and sets a $5,000 property or cash bond for Helen. Brian kicks his addict wife, Debrah (Tamara Taylor), out of their home. This causes him to have a strained relationship with his daughter, Tiffany (Tiffany Evans), who wants to join the church choir. Fearing that Tiffany will turn to drugs like her mother, Brian does not allow her until Madea convinces him otherwise, encouraging him to also fix his relationship with Debrah. Helen cultivates a relationship with Orlando. Meanwhile, career criminal Jamison Milton Jackson (Gary Anthony Sturgis) asks Charles to be his defense attorney in his trial for shooting an undercover cop during a drug deal and to possibly bribe the judge $300,000 to rule in his favor. This forces the revelation that Charles received most of his money through drug deals and buying off judges. In court for divorce, Helen lets Charles keep all the money and property, provided he pay Brian's attorney fees and continue paying for her mother, Myrtle Jean's (Cicely Tyson) stay in a nursing home since he made her place her there; Charles agrees to both terms. In the shooting case, despite Charles' efforts, the jury finds Jamison guilty. As Jamison is being led out of the courtroom, he snatches the bailiff's gun and shoots Charles in the back for failing to get him acquitted. Orlando proposes to Helen, but before she can respond, she sees the shooting on the news and goes to the hospital with Brian. They run into Brenda upon arriving. The doctor says Charles might be paralyzed for life and asks if they should resuscitate him if things deteriorate. Brenda chooses to let Charles perish, but Helen, still Charles's legal wife, tells the doctor to do everything they can for him. Charles recovers, returns home with Helen, and resumes his verbal abuse of her. But Helen takes the opportunity to retaliate for years of neglect and verbal and emotional abuse. Brenda is revealed to have emptied Charles's bank account during his hospitalization and left with their boys. Their maid, Christina, has left as well because Charles has no money to pay her. In addition, all of Charles's friends, associates, and connections have turned their backs on him now that he has been left crippled and penniless. Helen and Orlando argue when he learns she has moved back in with Charles to look after him. He leaves in anger. Charles realizes his mistakes and apologizes to Helen, realizing that she was the only one who showed any true care for him. He becomes a kinder man, while she helps him recover. He regains his ability to walk one day in church, where Debrah, now clean and sober, reconciles with Brian. Charles hopes to start over with Helen, but during a family dinner, she gives him her wedding ring and signed divorce papers and tells him she will always be his friend. She finds Orlando, asks him to propose again, and accepts when he does.

Reception=Critical response Professional film critics were mostly negative in their evaluation of Diary of a Mad Black Woman. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 16% based on 114 reviews. The site's consensus reads \\"Tyler Perry's successful play can't make the move to the screen; this mix of slapstick, melodrama and spirituality lacks a consistent tone.\\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 36% based on reviews from 30 critics, which the site considers \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audience polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \\"A+\\" grade, on a scale from A-F. Roger Ebert gave the film one out of four stars, arguing that the Madea character \\"is not remotely plausible [and] not merely wrong for the movie, but fatal to it.\\" Ebert also wrote that Elise, Tyson and Harris offered effective performances and that \\"[t]here's a good movie buried beneath the bad one.\\"Ebert, Roger (2005) Diary of a Mad Black Woman, accessed 23 February 2013 Box office On its opening weekend, the film arrived at #1 with $21.9 million. The film grossed an estimated $50.6 million in the United States and Canada with an additional $19,000 internationally for an estimated worldwide total of $50.7 million. Controversy In early 2008, playwright Donna West filed suit against Perry, contending that he stole material from her 1991 play, Fantasy of a Black Woman. Veronica Lewis, Perry's attorney, said there was no need for her client to appropriate the work of others. On December 9, 2008, the case was tried before Judge Leonard Davis in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The jury returned an 8‚Äì0 verdict in favor of Perry. Difference from the play * Helen and Charles have been married for 18 years in the movie, but in the play they were married for 20 years. * In the play, during their divorce, Helen keeps the house and $2,000 a month, but in the movie he throws her out of the house with no money for herself. * When Charles got paralyzed in the play, Helen didn't want to see him and said that he got what he deserved. In the movie, she and Brian went to see him. * The characters in the play, Angelo, Willie, and Daddy Charles don't exist. Daddy Charles may exist but was put in a home prior to the movie. Joe and Miltred acted similarly. * In the movie, Myrtle was put in a home prior to the movie, but in the play she hasn't been put in a home and she visits Helen now and then (due to her being played by Tamela Mann in the play version) * In the play, Charles and Helen make amends and get back together after he heals from his injury and learns the error of his ways. In the movie, although she forgave him, they amicably split for good and she accepts Orlando's proposal. In the play, however, Orlando and Helen's relationship didn't grow as strong.

It is comparable to the American Grammy Award. The Edison award itself is a bronze replica of a statuette of Thomas Edison, designed by the Dutch sculptor Pieter d'Hont.Edison van beeldhouwer D'Hont onder de hamer. rtvutrecht.nl. 21 March 2014 It is one of the oldest music awards in the world; first presented in 1960 at the inaugural Grand Gala du Disque.Edisons . edisons.nl Edisons In 1960, the Committee for Collective Gramophone Campaigns (CCGC) organized the Edison awards for recordings in various categories. The first Edisons ‚Äì named after the inventor of the phonograph, Thomas Edison ‚Äì were awarded at the inaugural Grand Gala du Disque, a showcase for the awards featuring national and international performers. Each year, Edisons were awarded at two separate events, the Grand Gala du Disque Classique for classical music and the Grand Gala du Disque Populaire for popular music. There were two main categories: International artists and domestic (Dutch) artists, in various musical styles such as pop, vocal, jazz, instrumental, children and (in the early years) a separate award for French-language music. The winners were decided by judges. The 1963 Grand Gala du Disque Populaire, which overran by almost two hours, saw Marlene Dietrich, Sarah Vaughan and Charles Aznavour accepting an Edison. In 1965, the winners included Esther Ofarim, Oliver Nelson, Louis van Dijke, the Beatles and Joan Baez. Pianist Vladimir Horowitz and composer-conductor Igor Stravinsky won awards at the Grand Gala du Disque Classique.Karlheinz Stockhausen, Anneliese Rothenberger and Edo de Waart with their Edison awards at the Grand Gala du Disque Classique on October 3, 1969.The award itself has also gone through many changes. In the 1960s and early 1970s grew to a (then) record number of 24 categories in 1969. In later years, the number of awards was inconsistent and several categories did not last longer than a couple of years. From 1974‚Äì1976 no Edisons were awarded and in 1977 only Dutch artists were awarded a prize. In 1980, the Classical and Popular were jointly awarded. While the award lost much of its prestige in the 1980s due to lack of media coverage and interest from record companies ‚Äì the number of categories continued to grow to a record number of 35 in 1991. The choices became more progressive, as several award winners were virtually unknown to the general public. In 1991, for instance, no awards were given to best selling and critically lauded albums like Nirvana's Nevermind or U2's Achtung Baby, but instead lesser known artists like The Riverdogs, Michael Lee Firkins, rapper Paris and instrumentalist Jean Marc Zelwer got the prizes. By the end of the 1990s, the Edison experienced another overhaul, as the prize was split into the Edison Pop and Edison Jazz/World awards (there had always been a separate Edison Classical Award ceremony). It also began to focus more on Dutch artists and a number of new categories were introduced, such as 'Best album', 'Best video', 'Best single' and 'Best newcomer'. Each year also featured one or two awards which were directly voted for by the television audiences. Interest in the Edison has gone up in recent years, although no awards were given in 2006 and 2007. These days, the award is focused on Dutch product only, with several categories such as 'Best male artist', 'Best female artist', 'Best newcomer', 'Best theatre/vocal artist', etc. There is also an annual lifetime achievement award for an artist with a distinguished career. The 2011 ceremony, held on 2 October and which featured eight categories, was not televised.  Award winners  From 1960 to 2011, over 750 Edison awards were handed out. The list of artists with most Edison wins is dominated by Dutch artists with relatively young careers. This is mainly because from the late 1990s, it has become much easier to win multiple awards in one year, which in the early days of the award was virtually impossible. * Marco Borsato ‚Äì 13 wins, from 1995 to 2011, including a lifetime achievement award in 2011 and five wins in the 'Best male artist' category. * Anouk ‚Äì 9 wins, from 1998 to 2011, including three Edisons in her debut year (1998) and five awards in the 'Best female artist' category.Anouk. edisons.nl * Herman van Veen ‚Äì 8 wins, from 1970 to 2010, including a lifetime achievement award in 2010, two awards in the children's category and four in the 'Best male vocal' category. * Bl√∏f ‚Äì 7 wins, from 2000 to 2009, including five awards for 'Best group'. * Ilse DeLange ‚Äì 6 wins, from 1999 to 2011, including four times as 'Best female artist'.

The first opportunity for traffic that instead continues onto the boulevard to leave it is east on Page Street.Google Maps street view, accessed November 2007 Before the Loma Prieta earthquake, the freeway continued beyond Fell Street and then curved northeast, with the northbound side ending at a ramp to Golden Gate Avenue and Franklin Street, and the southbound level touching down to the northwest at Turk and Gough Streets. Until 2007, this land remained mainly undeveloped, filled primarily by parking lots. However, the parcels were sold off to developers in the 2010s and as of 2020, most of it has been converted into a mix of affordable and market-rate housing., Retrieved 03 April 2020 History=Plans and original freeway Map from the 1948 Transportation Plan for San Francisco (downtown at the bottom) The 1948 Transportation Plan for San Francisco, prepared by De Leuw, Cather and Company, included the Central Freeway. This elevated roadway would begin at the Bayshore Freeway ‚Äì the approach to the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge ‚Äì near Division Street and head west and north around the periphery of downtown San Francisco. This portion would include junctions with the Mission Freeway (south and southwest along Mission Street to Daly City) at the southwest corner and the Panhandle Freeway (west through the Panhandle into Golden Gate Park) along the west side. After swinging northeast and back north to the east side of Van Ness Avenue (continuing as a double-decked structure between Van Ness Ave. and Polk Street), a pair of ramps would split to the east, taking downtown traffic to and from the one-way pair of Bush and Pine Streets. At Clay Street, the freeway would descend to meet the rising terrain, ending at Broadway just east of Van Ness Avenue as a single level depressed roadway. A short tunnel would curve northwest to a portal in Van Ness Avenue north of Broadway, taking traffic onto Van Ness Avenue towards the Golden Gate Bridge. Along with the Embarcadero and Broadway Tunnel, which were listed for rebuilding as ground-level expressways rather than the freeway (Embarcadero Freeway) that was later partially built and demolished, the Central Freeway would have provided a full traffic distributor loop around downtown. Map of the Central Freeway (red and purple) The route was also included in the 1955 city master plan, by then extending north beyond the former Broadway terminus to the proposed Golden Gate Freeway near Lombard Street.Transportation Section of the Master Plan of the City and County of San Francisco, 1955, OCLC 51930208 (map with route numbers added) The first piece, connecting the Bayshore Freeway with Mission Street, opened March 1, 1955,California Highway and Public Works, March‚ÄìApril, 1955 at about the same time as the Bayshore. The part of the Central Freeway to the one-way pair of Golden Gate Avenue and Turk Street opened in April 1959,John King, San Francisco Chronicle, An urban success story: Octavia Boulevard an asset to post-Central Freeway area, January 3, 2007California Highways and Public Works, March‚ÄìApril, 1960 and became part of U.S. Route 101 (and Legislative Route 2) via this one-way pair to the old route on Van Ness Avenue.California Highway Transportation Agency, map of San Francisco, 1963 In January of that year, as one of the opening events in the freeway revolts, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed Resolution 45-59, removing the remainder of the Central Freeway and most other proposed freeways from the city's highway plan.Tillo E. Kuhn, Public Enterprise Economics and Transport Problems, University of California Press, 1962, p. 200 Interstate 80, which had been assigned to the Central Freeway southeast of the proposed Panhandle Freeway, was truncated by the Federal Highway Administration in August 1965 and by the state in 1968. There was a plan promulgated in February 1962 to relieve traffic congestion on the Golden Gate Bridge by constructing a \\"San Francisco- Tiburon Bridge\\" from Van Ness Ave. at Aquatic Park in San Francisco north across the Golden Gate Strait to Tiburon to connect with the Redwood Highway, which would have been anchored on Angel Island. Had this bridge actually been constructed, it would have probably been eventually necessary to construct the proposed northern section of the Central Freeway from Turk Street north to Aquatic Park in order to adequately funnel traffic to it.Proposed Tiburon Bridge: left Truncation In 1989, the Loma Prieta earthquake damaged the northern part of the elevated roadway, and in 1992 Caltrans removed the freeway north of Fell Street and rerouted U.S. 101 to exit at Mission Street and onto the portion of Van Ness Avenue between the Central Freeway and Turk Street/Golden Gate Avenue. That year the Board of Supervisors banned any new freeway construction north of Market Street; a city task force recommended its replacement with a surface boulevard in 1995. Caltrans closed the double-deck freeway north of Mission Street for rebuilding in late 1996. A fight began between the primarily Chinese American residents of western San Francisco (the Richmond District and the Sunset District), who favored the Caltrans plan to rebuild it because it provided easy access for prospective customers to get to their businesses in the Richmond and Sunset districts, and the primarily White and Black Hayes Valley local residents, who regarded the freeway as urban blight, and were supported by Mayor Willie Brown. Caltrans reopened the northbound (lower) deck to Fell Street in 1997, but did not put a route designation on that deck; several initiatives were passed to remove the lower deck. The final compromise took a two-way freeway down to ground level at Market Street, where Octavia Boulevard ‚Äì a widened Octavia Street on the former freeway right-of-way ‚Äî would continue to Fell Street.Preservation Institute, San Francisco, CA: Central Freeway, accessed November 2007 The completed project opened on September 9, 2005. However, the South of Market neighborhood actually got a wider freeway, closer to ground level, in the space where the double-decked road had been. The newer section of the Central Freeway between Mission Street and Market Street still remains unsigned, but is maintained by Caltrans. Between early 2010 and 2013, when it was partially redeveloped for housing, a 2.2-acre site between Laguna, Oak, Fell, and Octavia Streets in Hayes Valley that had been ramps for the elevated freeway was temporarily converted into Hayes Valley Farm. With a grant from the Mayor's Office of Economic and Workforce Development, raised beds using cardboard as mulch were constructed on the road bed and potted fruit trees and bee hives added.

The quintet's members included Don Bradley, Carl Fisher, Dave Govan, James Johnson and Ricky Owens. The group initially began recording as The Jay Hawks, and had a hit in 1956 with \\"Stranded in the Jungle\\" (US #18). After a few lineup changes, the group hit again in 1961 with the song \\"The Watusi\\" (US #25); concurrently, they had a hit under the name The Marathons with \\"Peanut Butter\\", a rewritten version of The Olympics' \\"Hully Gully\\" with new lyrics by Hidle Brown Barnum and Martin Cooper (#20). The group recorded a couple of Northern Soul classics since their initial hit on Atlantic Records in 1963.

At this time, Owens became a member of the Temptations, although he was let go after his first few engagements. Owens and the other Vibrations regrouped and continued, eventually become a nightclub act in the mid-1970s, before officially dissolving the group in 1976. Ricky Owens died in 1996. David Govan died in 2009, and James Johnson is also deceased.

Eastern and southern Taiwan are the northern end of the Philippine Mobile Belt. Located next to an oceanic trench and volcanic system in a tectonic collision zone, Taiwan has evolved a unique environment that produces high-temperature springs with crystal-clear water, usually both clean and safe to drink. These hot springs are not only clean and potable but also commonly used for spas and resorts. History Closer view of hot springs on Seven Star Mountain located in Yangmingshan The first mention of Taiwan's hot springs came from a 1697 manuscript, , but they were not developed until 1893, when a German businessman discovered Beitou and later established a small local spa. Under Japanese rule, the government constantly promoted and further enhanced the natural hot springs. The Japanese rule brought with them their rich onsen culture of spring soaking, which had a great influence on Taiwan. In March 1896, from Osaka, Japan opened Taiwan's first hot spring hotel, called . He not only heralded a new era of hot spring bathing in Beitou, but also paved the road for a whole new hot spring culture for Taiwan. In the Japanese onsen culture, hot springs are claimed to offer many health benefits. As well as raising energy levels, the minerals in the water are commonly suggested to help treat chronic fatigue, eczema or arthritis. During Japanese rule, the four major hot springs in Taiwan were in modern-day Beitou, Yangmingshan, Guanziling and Sichongxi. However, under Republic of China administration starting from 1945, the hot spring culture in Taiwan gradually lost momentum. It was not until 1999 that the authorities again started large- scale promotion of Taiwan's hot springs, setting off a renewed hot spring fever. In recent years, hot spring spas and resorts on Taiwan have gained more popularity. With the support of the government, the hot spring has become not only another industry but also again part of Taiwanese culture. Taiwan has one of the highest concentrations (more than 100 hot springs) and greatest variety of thermal springs in the world varying from hot springs to cold springs, mud springs, and seabed hot springs.

Binjai is connected to Medan (the provincial capital), about 22 km to the east, by the Sumatra highway that goes to Banda Aceh, and effectively forms a part of Greater Medan. The \\"Kota\\" population was 181,904 in the 1990 Census, 224,516 in the 2000 Census, 246,154 in the 2010 Census,http://hariansib.com/?p=136255 and 264,440 in the 2015 Census.Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2018. In 2010, a further 42,325 inhabitants lived in Binjai District of Langkat Regency, outside the city limits but immediately north of the city. History The origin of Binjai when it established itself as a city is unknown. Historically the Binjai area was situated between two Malay kingdoms, Deli and Langkat. Binjai grew from a small village on the edge of the Bingai River. According to both oral and written accounts of the history of the area, the city of Binjai grew from a small village located on the edge of the Bingai river, approximately where the Pekan Binjai village is located today. Traditional ceremonies were held to lay the foundations of the small village in the shade of a large Binjai Tree at the edge of the Bingai river, which flows into the Wampu River, which is navigable for a large portion of its length. Around the tree were built several houses, which were gradually enlarged, until finally a village hall was built. A lively port also developed, visited by barges from Stabat, Tanjung Pura and Strait of Malacca. Over time, the Binjai tree gave its name to the growing city. Geography Binjai is located between the Mencirim, Bangkatan and Bingai rivers. On average, it is 28 m above sea level. As the crow flies, Binjai is only 8 km from Medan, although Kabupaten Deli Serdang separates the two. However, the route of the Sumatara Highway increases the effective distance between the two cities to 22 km. The two nearby rivers, the Bingai and Mencirim Rivers satisfy the needs of the city for clean water, which is distributed by the local water company. However, there are many citizens on the outskirts of the city who rely on wells for their water supply. Government Binjai city is divided into 5 districts (kecamatan): Binjai Timur, Binjai Kota, Binjai Selatan, Binjai Barat and Binjai Utara, which are further divided into 37 villages (kelurahan). The mayoral office is located in the Town Hall, at Jenderal Sudirman Road No. 6. In 2009, Muhammad Idhaham, Msi was elected to this position for the period 2009‚Äì2014. Formerly, Binjai was the location for the headquarters of the Langkat Police Force, which had responsibility for policing both the city of Binjai and Kabupaten Langkat. However, in 2001 the police force was split, with the creation of a Binjai police force, while the headquarters for the Langkat Police Force moved to Stabat. Directly in front of the town hall is the Lapangan merdeka (Freedom Square), a civic open space, as well as the Pendopo Umar Baki, a building used for a variety of official and unofficial functions. Demographics Binjai is a multi-ethnic city, with Javanese, Batak, Chinese, Indian and Malay citizens. This complex ethnic mix gives Binjai a rich cultural and religious life. The total population for the city of Binjai was 254,440 at the 2015 Census.Badan usat Statistik, Jakarta, 2018. Along with Deli Serdang Regency, the city functions effectively as a suburb of Medan. The majority of the population are Islamic, mainly of Javanese and Malay origin. The largest mosque is located in Kapten Machmud Ismail Street. The Christian population is next largest, and is mainly made up of Sumatran Christians, while the majority of Buddhists are of Chinese origin. There is one Hindu temple in Binjai, located on Ahmad Yani Street, and the Hindu population are mainly made up of ethnic Indians. Economics and commerce Rambutans from Binjai The commercial centre is located in the heart of the city. The industrial area is in the north, while farming is concentrated in the east, south and west of the city, with the west being the main area for animal husbandry. There is a 3 km¬≤ business park in the Kelurahan Cengkeh Turi. There is also oil and gas exploration occurring in the Tandam Hilir region, to the north of the city. In 1999, 29% of economic activity consisted of trade in goods and services, while the industrial sector contributed 23% of economic activity. The per capita income for Binjai was 3.3m rupiah, below the average for North Sumatera Province as a whole, which stood at 4.9m rupiah. The most important agricultural sector is rambutan production, which covered 4.25 km¬≤ with a production capacity of 2,400 tons per year. At present, the industry consists solely of the sale of fresh rambutan fruit; there is plenty of scope to modernise this industry, for instance by the introduction of canning processes and more sophisticated marketing. There are four traditional markets in Binjai serving buyers and sellers from both Binjai and kabupaten Langkat. These are: Tavip, Kebun Lada, Brahrang and Rambung markets. There are also several modern shopping centres, including Suzuya, Mini Market Tahiti, Toserba Ramayana, the Ramayana Mall, Asia King and Binjai Supermall. Jenderal Sudirman Street and Ahmad Yani Streets are the main shopping avenues, while the biggest and food court in Binjai is Bangkatan with Chinese and Indonesian food as specialities. Education As of 2005, there are 154 primary schools, 37 middle schools, 9 Islamic middle schools, 31 high schools and 10 Islamic high schools, 4 academy and 5 university. There are approximately 78,000 children attending these 241 schools. Transport Binjai Station The major forms of public transport within the city are becak, a three-wheeled motorised vehicle, and small minibusses called \\"Sudako\\". Aside from road transport out of the city, there is also a train connecting Binjai with Medan; the continuing line to Kuala, Langkat is disused and no longer functional. The nearest airport is Medan's Kuala Namu International Airport, while a direct toll-road connection to the nearest port is currently under construction. Other items of interest An important icon for the city is the Struggle of 1945 Statue, which welcomes visitors from outside the city. Binjai also used to have as historic water fountain built by the Dutch, which was used a water source for the local population, however, this was demolished and replaced by shops several years ago. Binjai is also an important transit point for visitors to Bukit Lawang, in the Gunung Leuser National Park, an important site for the conservation of the red orangutan. Bukit Lawang is located 68 km west of Binjai. Binjai is also the site of a nationally important military cemetery. There are three large hospitals serving the needs of the population of Binjai. These are Korem Hospital, Binjai Public Hospital, and PTP IX Hospital.

When two adjacent vowel sounds occur in the same syllable, the result is instead a synaeresis. Preference Some languages do not have diphthongs, except sometimes in rapid speech, or they have a limited number of diphthongs but also numerous vowel sequences that cannot form diphthongs and so appear in hiatus. That is the case of Japanese, Bantu languages like Swahili, Lakota, and Polynesian languages like Hawaiian and MƒÅori. Examples are Japanese () 'blue/green', Swahili 'to purify', and Hawaiian 'to rise up', all of which are three syllables. Avoidance Many languages disallow or restrict hiatus and avoid it by deleting or assimilating the vowel or by adding an extra consonant. Epenthesis A consonant may be added between vowels (epenthesis) to prevent hiatus. That is most often a semivowel or a glottal, but all kinds of other consonants can be used as well, depending on the language and the quality of the two adjacent vowels. For example, some non-rhotic dialects of English often insert to avoid hiatus after non-high word-final or occasionally morpheme-final vowels.\\"Voice and Speech in the Theatre\\" Contraction In Greek and Latin poetry, hiatus is generally avoided although it occurs in many authors under certain rules, with varying degrees of poetic licence. Hiatus may be avoided by elision of a final vowel, occasionally prodelision (elision of initial vowel) and synizesis (pronunciation of two vowels as one without a change in spelling). Marking=Diaeresis In Dutch and French, the second of two vowels in hiatus is marked with a diaeresis (or ). That usage is occasionally seen in English (such as co√∂perate, da√Øs and re√´lect) but has never been common, and over the last century, its use in such words has been dropped or replaced by the use of a hyphen except in a very few publications, notably The New Yorker.diaeresis: December 9, 1998. The Mavens' Word of the Day. Random House.Umlauts in English?. General Questions. Straight Dope Message Board. It is, however, still common in loanwords such as na√Øve and No√´l and in the proper names Zo√´ and Chlo√´. Other ways In German, hiatus between monophthongs is usually written with an intervening h, as in \\"to pull\\"; \\"to threaten\\". In a few words (such as ), the h represents a consonant that has become silent, but in most cases, it was added later simply to indicate the end of the stem. Similarly, in Scottish Gaelic, hiatus is written by a number of digraphs: . Some examples include \\"river\\"; \\"day\\"; \\"condition\\". The convention goes back to the Old Irish scribal tradition, but it is more consistently applied in Scottish Gaelic: (> ). However, hiatus in Old Irish was usually simply implied in certain vowel digraphs (> ), (> ). Correption Correption is the shortening of a long vowel before a short vowel in hiatus.

He served in the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat from January 1975 until December 1980. He was convicted of accepting a bribe in the FBI's Abscam operation. Biography Jenrette was born in Conway, South Carolina in 1936 and grew up in Loris, South Carolina. He graduated from Loris High School, in 1954. He then earned a B.A. at Wofford College in 1958. After graduating from law school at the University of South Carolina, worked as a city attorney, then a judge, as he attempted to reach higher office. South Carolina House of Representatives Jenrette was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1964, where he represented his native town of Myrtle Beach. He retired from the state house to run for a seat in the U.S. House in 1972. U.S. House of Representatives Jenrette defeated seventeen- term Congressman John L. McMillan in the primary, but lost the general election to Republican Edward Lunn Young. Undaunted, Jenrette again ran for the same seat in 1974. In part because of the extreme unpopularity of Republican Richard Nixon and the Watergate scandal, Jenrette won. Jenrette, a liberal, seemed out of place representing his rather conservative waterfront congressional district. However, he was locally well-known, and the South Carolina Republican Party was not especially well-organized at the time in that part of the state. Jenrette easily defeated Young again in 1976 and was unopposed in 1978. Jenrette is most famous for two things during his days as a Congressman. First, he allegedly had sex with his then-wife, Rita Jenrette, behind a pillar on the steps of the Capitol Building during a break in a late night session of Congress. (The comedy group \\"Capitol Steps\\" take their name from this escapade.) Abscam Second, he was charged with and convicted of accepting a $50,000 bribe in the FBI sting operation known as Abscam which was conducted in 1980. He was recorded saying he'd been given a cash bribe by an associate.  December 10, 1983  EX-REP. JENRETTE GETS TWO YEARS IN ABSCAM CASE  UPI UPI ARCHIVES  OCT. 7, 1980  Rep.

These devices have been given the generic name \\"finfets\\" because the source/drain region forms fins on the silicon surface. The FinFET devices have significantly faster switching times and higher current density than planar CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) technology. FinFET is a type of non-planar transistor, or \\"3D\\" transistor. It is the basis for modern nanoelectronic semiconductor device fabrication. Microchips utilizing FinFET gates first became commercialized in the first half of the 2010s, and became the dominant gate design at 14 nm, 10 nm and 7 nm process nodes. History After the MOSFET was first demonstrated by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng of Bell Labs in 1960, the concept of a double-gate thin-film transistor (TFT) was proposed by H.R. Farrah (Bendix Corporation) and R.F. Steinberg in 1967. A double-gate MOSFET was later proposed by Toshihiro Sekigawa of the Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL) in a 1980 patent describing the planar XMOS transistor. Sekigawa fabricated the XMOS transistor with Yutaka Hayashi at the ETL in 1984. They demonstrated that short-channel effects can be significantly reduced by sandwiching a fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (SOI) device between two gate electrodes connected together. The first FinFET transistor type was called a \\"Depleted Lean-channel Transistor\\" or \\"DELTA\\" transistor, which was first fabricated in Japan by Hitachi Central Research Laboratory's Digh Hisamoto, Toru Kaga, Yoshifumi Kawamoto and Eiji Takeda in 1989. The gate of the transistor can cover and electrically contact the semiconductor channel fin on both the top and the sides or only on the sides. The former is called a tri-gate transistor and the latter a double-gate transistor. A double-gate transistor optionally can have each side connected to two different terminal or contacts. This variant is called split transistor. This enables more refined control of the operation of the transistor. Indonesian engineer Effendi Leobandung, while working at the University of Minnesota, published a paper with Stephen Y. Chou at the 54th Device Research Conference in 1996 outlining the benefit of cutting a wide CMOS transistor into many channels with narrow width to improve device scaling and increase device current by increasing the effective device width. This structure is what a modern FinFET looks like. Although some device width is sacrificed by cutting it into narrow widths, the conduction of the side wall of narrow fins more than make up for the loss, for tall fins. The device had a 35 nm channel width and 70 nm channel length. The potential of Digh Hisamoto's research on DELTA transistors drew the attention of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which in 1997 awarded a contract to a research group at UC Berkeley to develop a deep sub-micron transistor based on DELTA technology. The group was led by Hisamoto along with TSMC's Chenming Hu. The team made the following breakthroughs between 1998 and 2004. *1998 N-channel FinFET (17 nm) Digh Hisamoto, Chenming Hu, Tsu-Jae King Liu, Jeffrey Bokor, Wen-Chin Lee, Jakub Kedzierski, Erik Anderson, Hideki Takeuchi, Kazuya Asano *1999 P-channel FinFET (sub-50 nm) Digh Hisamoto, Chenming Hu, Xuejue Huang, Wen-Chin Lee, Charles Kuo, Leland Chang, Jakub Kedzierski, Erik Anderson, Hideki Takeuchi *2001 15 nm FinFET Chenming Hu, Yang‚ÄêKyu Choi, Nick Lindert, P.

Ameen They coined the term \\"FinFET\\" (fin field-effect transistor) in a December 2000 paper, used to describe a non-planar, double-gate transistor built on an SOI substrate. In 2006, a team of Korean researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and the National Nano Fab Center developed a 3 nm transistor, the world's smallest nanoelectronic device, based on gate-all-around (GAA) FinFET technology. In 2011, Rice University researchers Masoud Rostami and Kartik Mohanram demonstrated that FINFETs can have two electrically independent gates, which gives circuit designers more flexibility to design with efficient, low-power gates. Commercialization The industry's first 25 nanometer transistor operating on just 0.7 volt was demonstrated in December 2002 by TSMC. The \\"Omega FinFET\\" design, named after the similarity between the Greek letter \\"Omega\\" and the shape in which the gate wraps around the source/drain structure, has a gate delay of just 0.39 picosecond (ps) for the N-type transistor and 0.88 ps for the P-type. In 2004, Samsung demonstrated a \\"Bulk FinFET\\" design, which made it possible to mass-produce FinFET devices. They demonstrated dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) manufactured with a 90nm Bulk FinFET process. In 2011, Intel demonstrated tri-gate transistors, where the gate surrounds the channel on three sides, allowing for increased energy efficiency and lower gate delay‚Äîand thus greater performance‚Äîover planar transistors. Commercially produced chips at 22 nm and below have utilised FinFET gate designs. Intel's \\"Tri-Gate\\" variant were announced at 22nm in 2011 for its Ivy Bridge microarchitecture.Intel 22nm 3-D Tri-Gate Transistor Technology These devices shipped from 2012 onwards. From 2014 onwards, at 14 nm (or 16 nm) major foundries (TSMC, Samsung, GlobalFoundries) utilised FinFET designs. In 2013, SK Hynix began commercial mass-production of a 16nm process, TSMC began production of a 16nm FinFET process, and Samsung Electronics began production of a 10nm process. TSMC began production of a 7 nm process in 2017, and Samsung began production of a 5 nm process in 2018. In 2019, Samsung announced plans for the commercial production of a 3nm GAAFET process by 2021. Commercial production of nanoelectronic FinFET semiconductor memory began in the 2010s. In 2013, SK Hynix began mass-production of 16nm NAND flash memory, and Samsung Electronics began production of 10nm multi-level cell (MLC) NAND flash memory. In 2017, TSMC began production of SRAM memory using a 7 nm process.

Millhouses is a neighbourhood in the City of Sheffield, England. It is located in Ecclesall ward; in the south-western portion of the city on the northwest bank of the River Sheaf. Its origins lie in a small hamlet that grew around the Ecclesall Corn Mill.Vickers, Old Sheffield Town, p. 71 It has a population (2006 estimate) of 4,424. The agriculture and industries of this area are now largely gone, leaving Millhouses as a mostly residential area. Local amenities include three schools, a park, three pubs, three supermarkets, three churches and numerous small shops.  Geography  Millhouses is set in of the part of the Sheaf valley known as Abbeydale.Harvey, Abbeydale and Millhouses, pp. 7‚Äì8 It is bordered to the southeast by the River Sheaf and Hutcliff Wood, to the west by Ecclesall Woods, Millhouses Lane and Button Hill, and to the north by Carter Knowle Road and Bannerdale Road. Running directly alongside the River Sheaf is the long and thin Millhouses Park. The main road through the area is the A621 Abbeydale Road/Abbeydale Road South. The Midland Main Line also runs through Millhouses. Residential development was in a fan-shape focussed on the junction of Abbeydale Road and Millhouses Lane. Most houses in the area were built in the 1920s although there are some that date from the late 19th century.  History  In ancient times this area was part of the Barnsdale Forest that, together with Sherwood Forest, made up the forest of the Robin Hood legends. The River Sheaf marked the boundary between the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. In fact the earliest historical record of this area refers to the submission of the Northumbrian army to Egbert of Wessex at nearby Dore in 829.\\"Ecclesall\\", in Vickers, Old Sheffield Town, pp. 58‚Äì64 In the late 12th century Robert Fitz Ranulf gave land for the establishment an abbey, just south of Millhouses at Beauchief. Over time most the area now covered by Millhouses had been given to the abbey by the De Ecclesall family. (wikisource)Pixton, B., (2000) North Midland: Portrait of a Famous Route, Cheltenham: Runpast Publishing One of the gifts to the monks was the Ecclesall Corn Mill. This mill existed at least as early as 1280 and considerable remnants of it can still be seen at the north end of Millhouses Park. Millhouses remained mostly agricultural until the 19th century, although two cutlery works had been established in the area: Moscar Wheel, which may originally have been a corn mill, was making cutlery by 1496, and Bartin Wheel was built as a cutler's wheel in 1631. In 1805 a turnpike road was built from Sheffield to Bakewell (now Abbeydale Road), this passed through the area and led to some growth, but it was only with the extension of the Midland Main Line through the valley in 1870 (with a railway station at Millhouses) and the subsequent arrival of trams in 1902 that Millhouses began to develop as an affluent residential suburb. As well as a railway station, an engine shed was built in 1901. This closed in the 1962, but the shed building is still in use as an industrial site and the shed's sidings are now Tesco supermarket's Park and Ride. Noteworthy buildings in Millhouses include the Grade II listed parish church, Holy Trinity, which was constructed in 1937, and the former Millhouses police station building that dates from 1893. The Robin Hood and Wagon and Horses public houses are amongst the neighbourhood's older surviving buildings, both dating from earlier than 1822. Millhouses Park Millhouses Park Boating Lake Between Abbeydale Road South and the River Sheaf lies a mile-long public park, with a mixture of green spaces, planted areas and leisure facilities. These include tennis courts, a boating lake and a cafe serving gourmet food.

Biography Karg-Elert was born Siegfried Theodor Karg in Oberndorf am Neckar, Germany, the youngest of the twelve children of Johann Jacob Karg, a book dealer, and his wife Marie Auguste Karg, born Ehlert (sic). According to another account, however, his father was a newspaper editor and publisher . The family finally settled in Leipzig in 1882, where Siegfried received his first musical training and private piano instruction. At a gathering of composers in Leipzig, he presented his first attempts at composition to the composer Emil von Reznicek, who arranged a three-year tuition-free scholarship at the Leipzig Conservatory. This enabled the young man to study with Salomon Jadassohn, Carl Reinecke, Alfred Reisenauer and Robert Teichm√ºller. From August 1901 to September 1902 he worked as a piano teacher in Magdeburg. It was during this period that he changed his name to Sigfrid Karg-Elert, adding a variant of his mother's maiden name to his surname, and adopting the Swedish spelling of his first name. Having returned to Leipzig, he started devoting himself to composition, primarily for the piano (encouraged by Edvard Grieg, whom he greatly admired); and in 1904 he met the Berlin publisher Carl Simon, who introduced him to the harmonium. From then on until his death he created one of the most significant and extensive catalogs of original works for this instrument. Encouraged by the organist Paul Homeyer, he reworked several of these harmonium compositions for organ, before composing his first original organ piece, 66 Chorale Improvisations, Op. 65 in 1909. In 1910 Karg-Elert married Luise Kretzschmar (1890‚Äì1971); four years later their daughter Katharina was born. After having served as a regimental musician during World War I, Karg-Elert was appointed instructor of music theory and composition at the Leipzig Conservatory in 1919. The cultural climate in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s was very hostile to the internationally oriented, French-influenced Karg-Elert; and although his works were admired outside Germany, especially in the U.K. (the Organ Music Society of London held a ten-day festival in his honour in 1930) and in the United States, in his home country his music was almost completely neglected. All this led to him accepting an invitation for an organ concert tour of America in the spring of 1932. The tour proved to be a disastrous mistake, musically . He was suffering from the diabetes which would soon kill him, and his limited powers as an organist compared unfavourably to the virtuoso standard of organ performance (set by the likes of Marcel Dupr√© and Louis Vierne) to which American audiences had grown accustomed. After his return to Leipzig, his health started deteriorating rapidly. He died there in April 1933, aged 55. His grave is in the S√ºdfriedhof in Leipzig. The popularity of his compositions declined for a period after World War II, before a successful revival in the late 1970s; today his works for the organ are frequently included in recitals. Music Karg-Elert regarded himself as an outsider. Notable influences in his work include composers Johann Sebastian Bach (he often used the BACH motif in Bach's honour), Edvard Grieg, Claude Debussy, Max Reger, Alexander Scriabin, and early Arnold Schoenberg. In general terms, his musical style can be characterised as being late-romantic with impressionistic and expressionistic tendencies. His profound knowledge of music theory allowed him to stretch the limits of traditional harmony without losing tonal coherence. His favourite instrument to compose for was the Kunstharmonium, a versatile French creation that allowed him the range of colors he preferred. He composed primarily for small ensembles or solo instruments like organ, piano and harmonium . Notable works * 66 Chorale improvisations for organ (including no 59 \\"Nun danket alle Gott\\") Op 65 * Passacaglia in E-flat minor for harmonium or organ * Cathedral Windows for organ * Symphony in F minor op. 143 for organ (orchestral version by Franklin St√∂ver) * 33 Stylistic Studies for harmonium * Jugend for clarinet, horn & piano * 30 Caprices for flute solo * Sonata for clarinet solo * 20 Chorale Preludes and Postludes for organ * 25 Caprices and an Atonal Sonata for saxophone The 30 Caprices for flute were written specifically for a friend of Karg-Elert's, a flautist bound for service in the war. These short exercises were designed to challenge linear one-staff thinking and in short, keep the friend from becoming bored. They are now a standard set of technical, dynamic, and phrasing exercises for young flute students all over the world.

Born in Chester, he first came to public notice during the 1970s as the singer and drummer with British comedy showband the Black Abbots, later forging a prominent solo career as a television comedian with his own weekly show on British television. Continuing his musical career as a solo artist, Abbot released several charting singles and albums. Latterly his career has continued with a shift into more mainstream serious acting in television shows, series and stage productions. Career As a drummer/backing singer, Abbot joined the Black Abbots (founded by Robert Turner) in Chester during the mid-1960s and released several singles to modest chart success on minor labels in the early 1970s. The band only signed their first major recording contract in 1977, putting out a series of comedy singles and one live album (Abbot now taking lead vocals) before disbanding in 1980. Subsequently he appeared as a comedian, winning the 'Funniest Man On Television' award five times. Abbot appeared on the television show The Comedians under his birth name (Russ Roberts). From 1980 onward, he released some albums as a solo artist and appeared in several TV series. The most successful of his music singles, \\"Atmosphere\\", did well in the UK top 10, peaking at No. 7 in 1985. Russ Abbot's Madhouse and The Russ Abbot Show showcased his talents as an all-round entertainer, attracting millions of viewers. This show was especially popular among younger viewers, prompting two annuals to be published in 1982‚Äì83. These annuals featured comic strips based on popular characters, plus some publicity photos of Abbot in a variety of guises, including his well-known James Bond satire featuring characters named Basildon Bond and Miss Funnyfanny (based on the fictional MI6 spy duo James Bond and Miss Moneypenny). In January 1993, Abbot hosted an Elvis special of Stars in Their Eyes; this was originally to be presented by Leslie Crowther, who had suffered serious injuries in a car crash in his Rolls-Royce in October 1992. Abbot was brought in as a temporary host, and this was the only episode he hosted. Crowther was unable to return, and died in 1996; he was replaced by Matthew Kelly, who then hosted the show until 2004. as . From 2000, Abbot played the lead role in the British National Tour of Doctor Dolittle. Taking a break over the Christmas period, Abbot stepped down for Phillip Schofield to take the part but returned to the tour subsequently. In 2003, his \\"See You Jimmy\\" character (called C. U. Jimmy) came third in the Glasgow Herald's poll to find the most Scottish person in the world, behind Iain and Jimmy Krankie. Abbot's theatre roles include Alfred P. Doolittle in My Fair Lady (starring Amy Nuttall) at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and on tour; The Narrator in The Rocky Horror Show; Grandpa Potts in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang at the London Palladium and Fagin in Oliver! both in 1998 and 2009. From July 2007, he took over the role of Roger De Bris in the UK tour of Mel Brooks' The Producers. In 2008, Abbot appeared as the Tin Man in the stage production of The Wizard of Oz at the Mayflower Theatre, Southampton. In 2008, the BBC announced that Abbot would be joining the cast of Last of the Summer Wine for the show's 30th series. He played Luther 'Hobbo' Hobdyke, who was the leader of a group consisting also of Entwistle, played by Burt Kwouk and Alvin, played by Brian Murphy. In 2008, he guest-starred in The Sarah Jane Adventures episode 'Secrets of the Stars' as a character called Martin Trueman, an astrologer who was possessed by the Ancient Lights. On 8 August 2009, Abbot appeared in an episode of Casualty playing a pet shop owner. This marked Abbot's second Casualty role ‚Äì he previously appeared as a different character in a 1999 episode. He appeared on Harry Hill's TV Burp parodying the character he played in Casualty. In 2009, when Rowan Atkinson fell ill during the original run of Cameron Mackintosh's West End revival of Oliver!, Abbot stepped into the role of Fagin for the second time. He again took the role after Griff Rhys Jones left the show on 12 June 2010. Between 2014 and 2016 he co-starred in the BBC sitcom Boomers.

Initially released for the Commodore 64 in 1985, it was ported to other computers over the next several years. A Sega Genesis cartridge was published in 1991. HardBall! was followed by sequels HardBall II, HardBall III, HardBall IV, HardBall 5, and HardBall 6. Gameplay Play is controlled with a joystick or arrow keys and an action button. One of the four cardinal directions is used to choose the pitch, and again to aim it towards low, high, inside (towards batter), or outside (away from batter). The same directions are used to aim the swing when batting. When fielding after a hit, the defensive player closest to the ball will flash to show it is the one currently under control. The four directions are then used to throw to one of the four bases. Hardball! was one of the first baseball video games to incorporate the perspective from the pitcher's mound, similar to MLB broadcasts. There are also managerial options available. The player has a selection of pitchers to choose from. Each team member has his own statistics that affect his performance, and can be rearranged as desired. Prior to HardBall!s release, there were managerial baseball games available, such as MicroLeague Baseball but HardBall! was the first to integrate that aspect with the arcade control of the game action itself. Reception Hardball! was Accolade's best-selling Commodore game as of late 1987. Its sales had surpassed 250,000 copies by November 1989. Info rated Hardball! four-plus stars out of five, stating that it \\"is easily the best baseball simulation we have seen to date for the 64/128\\" and praising its graphics. ANALOG Computing praised the Atari 8-bit version's gameplay, graphic, and animation, only criticizing the computer opponent's low difficulty level. The magazine concluded that the game \\"is in a league of its own, above all other Atari sports games‚Äîsimulations included\\". In an overview of statistics-oriented baseball games, Computer Gaming World stated that Hardball \\"would probably be disappointing to anyone other than an avid arcade fan\\". Compute!'s Apple Applications stated that the Apple II and Macintosh versions had \\"almost everything you could want from a baseball simulation\\", with good support for playing as manager, player, or statistician and \\"exceptionally clear and precise graphics\\". The magazine concluded that \\"Hardballs realism is outstanding‚Äîat a level unmatched by other baseball software to date\\". The game was reviewed in 1988 in Dragon #132 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. Entertainment Weekly picked the game as the #11 greatest game available in 1991, saying: \\"With its oversaturated colors, ultrarealistic sound effects (when the umpire shouts 'Play ball!' it sounds as if he‚Äôs in the room), and detailed managerial options, HardBall! is the closest you may ever get to playing in a real major-league ballpark.\\" Legacy The game appears in the opening scene of the 1987 film The Princess Bride, being played by Fred Savage.

He is a recipient of the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for History for The Radicalism of the American Revolution (1992). His book The Creation of the American Republic, 1776‚Äì1787 (1969) won a 1970 Bancroft Prize. In 2010, he was awarded the National Humanities Medal. Early life and education Wood was born in Concord, Massachusetts, and grew up in Worcester and Waltham. He graduated summa cum laude from Tufts University in 1955 and has served as a trustee there. After serving in the United States Air Force in Japan, during which time he earned an A.M. at Harvard University, he entered the Ph.D. program in history at Harvard, where he studied under Bernard Bailyn, receiving his Ph.D. in 1964. Career Wood has taught at Harvard University, the College of William and Mary, the University of Michigan, Brown University, and in 1982‚Äì83 was Pitt Professor at Cambridge University. In addition to his books (listed below), Wood has written numerous influential articles, notably \\"Rhetoric and Reality in the American Revolution\\" (1966), \\"Conspiracy and the Paranoid Style: Causality and Deceit in the Eighteenth century\\" (1982), and \\"Interests and Disinterestedness in the Making of the Constitution\\" (1987). He is a frequent contributor to The New York Review of Books and The New Republic. A recent project was the third volume of the Oxford History of the United States ‚Äì Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789‚Äì1815 (2009) ‚Äì a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. Contributing to the anthology Our American Story (2019), Wood addressed the possibility of a shared American narrative. He focused on the idea of equality as \\"the most radical and most powerful ideological force\\" that the American Revolution unleashed. \\"This powerful sense of equality is still alive and well in America, and despite all of its disturbing and unsettling consequences, it is what makes us one people.\\" Wood was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1988.https://www.amacad.org/person/gordon-stewart-wood In popular culture Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich publicly and effusively praised Wood's The Radicalism of the American Revolution (1992). Wood, who met Gingrich once in 1994, surmised that Gingrich may have approved because the book \\"had a kind of Toquevillian touch to it, I guess, maybe suggesting American exceptionalism, that he liked\\". He jokingly described Gingrich's praise in an interview on C-SPAN in 2002 as \\"the kiss of death for me among a lot of academics, who are not right-wing Republicans.\\" Wood was mentioned in the 1997 film Good Will Hunting. In one scene, Matt Damon's character mentions Gordon Wood while standing up to a Harvard student who is bullying Ben Affleck's character at a bar. He accuses the Harvard student of shallowly reiterating ideas he has encountered in his coursework, telling him that soon he would be \\"regurgitating Gordon Wood, talking about [...] the pre-Revolutionary utopia and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization.\\" Wood said of the scene, \\"That‚Äôs my two seconds of fame! More kids know about that than any of the books I have written.\\" This scene was later parodied by the television show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, in which the character Charlie Kelly attempts to \\"pull a Good Will Hunting\\" and asks \\"does no one know who Gordon Wood is?\\" Personal life Wood married the former Louise Goss on April 30, 1956. They have three children: Christopher, Elizabeth and Amy. Their son, Christopher Wood, is a professor of German at New York University and their daughter, Amy, is a professor of history at Illinois State University, and Elizabeth is an administrator at Milton Academy.

TSA is a fluent aphasia similar to Wernicke's aphasia (receptive aphasia), with the exception of a strong ability to repeat words and phrases. The person may repeat questions rather than answer them (\\"echolalia\\"). In all of these ways, TSA is very similar to a more commonly known language disorder, receptive aphasia. However, transcortical sensory aphasia differs from receptive aphasia in that patients still have intact repetition and exhibit echolalia, or the compulsive repetition of words. Transcortical sensory aphasia cannot be diagnosed through brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), as the results are often difficult to interpret. Therefore, clinicians rely on language assessments and observations to determine if a patient presents with the characteristics of TSA. Patients diagnosed with TSA have shown partial recovery of speech and comprehension after beginning speech therapy. Speech therapy methods for patients with any subtype of aphasia are based on the principles of learning and neuroplasticity. Clinical research on TSA is limited because it occurs so infrequently in patients with aphasia that it is very difficult to perform systematic studies. TSA should not be confused with transcortical motor aphasia (TMA), which is characterized by nonfluent speech output, with good comprehension and repetition. Patients with TMA have impaired writing skills, difficulty speaking and difficulty maintaining a clear thought process. Furthermore, TMA is caused by lesions in cortical motor areas of the brain as well as lesions in the anterior portion of the basal ganglia, and can be seen in patients with expressive aphasia. Affected brain areas Damage to the inferior left temporal lobe, which is shown in green, is associated with TSA Transcortical sensory aphasia is caused by lesions in the inferior left temporal lobe of the brain located near Wernicke's area, and is usually due to minor hemorrhage or contusion in the temporal lobe, or infarcts of the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA). One function of the arcuate fasciculus is the connection between Wernicke‚Äôs and Broca‚Äôs area. In TSA Wernicke‚Äôs and Broca‚Äôs areas are spared, meaning that lesions do not occur in these regions of the brain. However, since the arcuate fasciculus, Wernicke's area, and Broca's area are secluded from the rest of the brain in TSA, patients still have intact repetition (as information from the arcuate fasciculus is relayed to Broca‚Äôs area), but cannot attach meaning to words, either spoken or heard. Characteristics Transcortical sensory aphasia is characterized as a fluent aphasia. Fluency is determined by direct qualitative observation of the patient‚Äôs speech to determine the length of spoken phrases, and is usually characterized by a normal or rapid rate; normal phrase length, rhythm, melody, and articulatory agility; and normal or paragrammatic speech. Transcortical sensory aphasia is a disorder in which there is a discrepancy between phonological processing, which remains intact, and lexical-semantic processing, which is impaired. Therefore, patients can repeat complicated phrases, however they lack comprehension and propositional speech. This disconnect occurs since Wernicke‚Äôs area is not damaged in patients with TSA, therefore repetition is spared while comprehension is affected. Patients with intact repetition can repeat both simple and complex phrases spoken by others, e.g. when asked if the patient would like to go for a walk, he or she would respond \\"go for walk.\\" Although patients can respond appropriately, due to the extent of their TSA, it is most likely that they do not comprehend what others ask them. In addition to problems in comprehension, transcortical sensory aphasia is further characterized based on deficits in naming and paraphasia. Verbal comprehension Impaired verbal comprehension can be the result a number of causes such as failure of speech sound discrimination, word recognition, auditory working memory, or syntactic structure building. When clinically examined, patients with TSA will exhibit poor comprehension of verbal commands. Based on the extent of the comprehension deficiency, patients will have difficulty following simple commands, e.g. ‚Äúclose your eyes.‚Äù Depending on the extent of affected brain area, patients are able to follow simple commands but may not be able to comprehend more difficult, multistep commands, e.g. ‚Äúpoint to the ceiling, then touch your left ear with your right hand.\\" Verbal commands as such, that require the patient to cross over the midline of their body are typically more taxing than commands that involve solely the right or left side. When increasing the complexity of verbal commands comprehension is often tested by varying the grammatical structure of the command to determine whether or not the patient understands different grammatical variations of the same sentence. Commands involving the passive voice or possessive, e.g. \\"If the snake killed the mouse, which one is still alive,\\" usually result in comprehension problems in those who can understand simple questions. Naming Naming involves the ability to recall an object. Patients with TSA, as well as patients with all other aphasia subtypes, exhibit poor naming. Clinical assessment of naming involves the observer first asking the patient to name high frequency objects such as clock, door, and chair. TSA patients who name common objects with ease generally have difficulty naming both uncommon objects and specific parts of objects such as lapel, or the dial on a watch. Paraphasia Patients with TSA typically exhibit paraphasia; their speech is fluent but often error- prone. Their speech is often unintelligible as they tend to use the wrong words, e.g. tree instead of train or uses words in senseless and incorrect combinations. Diagnosis=Clinical assessment Sensory aphasia is typically diagnosed by non-invasive evaluations. Neurologists, neuropsychologists or speech pathologists will administer oral evaluations to determine the extent of a patient‚Äôs comprehension and speech capability. Initial assessment will determine if the cause of linguistic deficiency is aphasia. If the diagnosis is then confirmed, testing will next address the type of aphasia and its severity. The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination specializes in determining the severity of a sensory aphasia through the observation of conversational behaviors. Several modalities of perception and response are observed in conjunction with the subject‚Äôs ability to process sensory information. The location of the brain lesion and type of the aphasia can then be inferred from the observed symptoms. The Minnesota Test for Differential Diagnosis is the most lengthy and thorough assessment of sensory aphasia. It pinpoints weaknesses in the auditory and visual senses, as well as reading comprehension. From this differential diagnosis, a patient‚Äôs course of treatment can be determined. After treatment planning, the Porch Index of Communicative Ability is used to evaluate prognosis and the degree of recovery. Imaging fMRI is a measure of the increase in blood flow to localized areas of the brain that coincide with neural activity and is used to image brain activity related to a specific task or sensory process. It is a commonly used method for imaging brain activity in aphasia patients. Sensory aphasia cannot be diagnosed through the use of imaging techniques. Differences in cognition between asymptomatic subjects and affected patients can be observed via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, these results only reveal temporal differences in cognition between control and diagnosed subjects. The degree of progression during therapy can also be surveyed through cognition tests monitored by fMRI. Many patients‚Äô progress is assessed over time via repeated testing and corresponding cerebral imaging by fMRI. Management Due to advances in modern neuroimaging, scientists have been able to gain a better understanding of how language is learned and comprehended. Based on the new data from the world of neuroscience, improvements can be made in coping with the disorder. Therapists have been developing multiple methods of improving speech and comprehension. These techniques utilize three general principles: maximizing therapy occurrences, ensuring behavioral and communicative relevance, and allowing patients to focus on the language tools that are still available in his or her repertoire. Many of the following treatment techniques are used to improve auditory comprehension in patients with aphasia: * Using common words * Using concrete nouns is more effective than using adjectives, adverbs, or verbs * Using action verbs that are easily imagined * Concise and grammatically simple sentences as opposed to lengthy sentences * Speaking slowly, repeating oneself several times when conversing with aphasic patients * Using gestures A relatively new method of language therapy involves coincidence learning. Coincidence learning focuses on the simultaneous learning of two or more events and stipulates that these events are wired together in the brain, strengthening the learning process. Therapists use coincidence learning to find and improve language correlations or coincidences that have been either damaged or deleted by severe cases of aphasia, such as transcortical sensory aphasia. This technique is important in brain function and recovery, as it strengthens associated brain areas that remain unaffected after brain damage. It can be achieved with intensive therapy hours in order to maximize time where correlation is emphasized. Through careful analysis of neuroimaging studies, a correlation has been developed with motor function and the understanding of action verbs. For example, leg and motor areas were seen to be activated words such as \\"kick\\", leading scientists to understand the connection between motor and language processes in the brain. This is yet another example of using relationships that are related in the brain for the purpose of rehabilitating speech and comprehension. Of huge importance in aphasia therapy is the need to start practicing as soon as possible. Greater recovery occurs when a patient attempts to improve their comprehension and speaking soon after aphasia occurs. There is an inverse relationship between the length of time spent not practicing and level of recovery. The patient should be pushed to their limits of verbal communication in order for them to practice and build upon their remaining language skills. One effective therapy technique is using what are known as language games in order to encourage verbal communication. One famous example is known as \\"Builder's Game\\", where a 'builder' and a 'helper' must communicate in order to effectively work on a project. The helper must hand the builder the tools he or she may need, which requires effective oral communication. The builder succeeds by requesting tools from the assistant by usually using single word utterances, such as 'hammer' or 'nail'. Thus, when the helper hands the tool to the builder, the game incorporates action with language, a key therapy technique. The assistant would then hand the builder the requested tool. Success of the game occurs when the builder's requests are specific to ensure successful building. Ultimately, regardless of therapy plan or method, improvement in speech does not appear overnight; it requires a significant time investment by the patient as well as a dedicated speech therapist seeking to ensure that the patient is focusing on the correct speech tasks outside of the clinic. Furthermore, the patient must collaborate with friends and family members during their free time in order to maximize the efficacy of the treatment.

Several games are based upon the James Bond films and developed and published by a variety of companies, centering on Ian Fleming's fictional British MI6 agent, James Bond. The intellectual property is owned by Danjaq. History=Early era (1983‚Äì1994) In 1983, Parker Brothers released the first James Bond video game, James Bond 007, for multiple consoles. Since 1983, there have been numerous video games based on the films, Ian Fleming's novels, and original scripts created by the developer or publisher of the game. Mindscape, Domark, Interplay, and THQ all created James Bond games. The video games were somewhat profitable in the 1980s and early 1990s, featuring a mixture of styles including side-scrolling action and text adventure. Nintendo era (1995‚Äì1998) The popularity of the James Bond video game series did not rise quickly until 1997's GoldenEye 007 by Rare for the Nintendo 64. GoldenEye 007 expanded on the plot of the film GoldenEye and is a first-person shooter with a multiplayer mode. The game received very positive reviews and sold over eight million copies. In 1998, Nintendo released James Bond 007 for the Game Boy developed by Saffire. The game features a story including characters from multiple James Bond films, such as Oddjob and Jaws. It also incorporates gambling minigames, such as Baccarat and Blackjack. Electronic Arts era (1999‚Äì2005) Electronic Arts took over the license from MGM Interactive when a video game based on Tomorrow Never Dies was in development in 1998. Taking the initial concepts for the video game adaptation, developer Black Ops Entertainment handled the final form of the title and the game saw the light of day in 1999 on PlayStation and met mixed reviews from critics, albeit becoming a financial success. The following entry was to be based on The World Is Not Enough, consisting of several versions released on multiple platforms, including one on Nintendo 64 developed by Eurocom, a version for PlayStation developed by Black Ops Entertainment, and GameBoy Color by 2n Productions, with all three meeting different results in spite of being commercially successful. Unlike the former two versions ‚Äì first-person shooters ‚Äì the GameBoy Color version is played from a top-down perspective. In 2001, EA released Agent Under Fire for Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube, featuring an original storyline and lacking the likeness of then Bond actor Pierce Brosnan. The game added the elements of \\"rail\\" shooting and driving segments to a first-person shooter. The game sold nearly 5 million copies, making it the second-most successful game in the series, while only receiving mixed reviews. There are no differences between the console versions. In 2002, Nightfire was released, coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the film franchise and retaining Brosnan's likeness for the Bond character. It was developed by Eurocom for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox consoles, with a PC port by Gearbox Software and a Mac port by Aspyr. The computer versions are substantially different from the console versions, featuring different missions, a modified story line, and online play. In 2003, the game also had a Game Boy Advance version by JV Games, which also differs from both the console versions and PC versions. In 2004, EA released Everything or Nothing, developed by EA Redwood, for the PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox. Unlike the two previous installments, Everything or Nothing is a third-person shooter with driving missions, and it stars the voices and likenesses of Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe and John Cleese, among others. It was written by the scriptwriter of GoldenEye and Tomorrow Never Dies, screenwriter Bruce Feirstein, with a plot connected to the Roger Moore Bond film A View to a Kill. It was released to mostly positive reviews, the game also had a Game Boy Advance version by JV Games, which differs from the console versions. Later that year, GoldenEye: Rogue Agent was released on the same platforms with the exception of the Game Boy Advance version. A first-person shooter loosely connected to the Bond franchise a spin-off, it stars a former MI6 spy known as \\"GoldenEye\\", who works for Auric Goldfinger against Dr. Julius No. The game was panned for its misleading title and poor storyline. The game was released on PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and Nintendo DS. EA listed 007 Racing and GoldenEye: Rogue Agent as spin-offs, out of their canonical order they have built. 2005 saw the release of From Russia with Love, based on the 1963 film of the same name. It stars Sean Connery as James Bond, and the other characters had the same likeness of the original cast. The game is a third- person shooter in the same style as Everything or Nothing, with expansions in the story and certain details changed (such as trading SPECTRE for OCTOPUS, due to legal problems). The game received positive reviews, and was released on GameCube, Xbox, PS2 and PSP. Electronic Arts announced in 2006 a game based on then-upcoming Casino Royale, but it ended up being cancelled, because it would not be ready by the film's release in November. This fact, which would lead MGM to lose millions in licensing fees, along with EA's commitment to move away from movie franchise games and focus more on internal intellectual properties, led the company to abandon the Bond franchise in May 2006. Activision era (2006‚Äì2013) Shortly after Electronic Arts abandoned the license, in May 2006, Activision acquired non-exclusive rights to develop and publish James Bond games, which were to become exclusive in 2007. Activision's first game was Quantum of Solace, which was based on the 2008 film of the same name as well as the previous film Casino Royale. It was developed by Treyarch for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and PC; Eurocom for PlayStation 2 and Vicarious Visions for the Nintendo DS. The game was released on 31 October 2008 and received mixed reviews, with the PlayStation 2 version receiving the best reviews. At E3 2010, Nintendo revealed GoldenEye 007, a remake for the Wii of the 1997 game. Developed by Eurocom, using their Dead Space: Extraction game engine, the game updated the story of the movie, with a script by Bruce Feirstein and the current Bond actor Daniel Craig as 007. It was released in November 2010 in all regions and received positive reviews from critics. Approximately a year later, an enhanced port of the game entitled GoldenEye 007: Reloaded was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The port featured HD graphics, new missions and PlayStation Move support on the PS3 version. Activision's third Bond game, Blood Stone was released on the same day as GoldenEye 007 in November 2010. Developed by Bizarre Creations, the game returned to being a third person shooter, featured an original story and starred Daniel Craig, Judy Dench and Joss Stone, the latter of which also sang on the game's theme song \\"I'll Take it All\\". It was released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PC and DS and received mixed reviews from critics. Developer Bizarre Creations was closed down by Activision in early 2011 just a few months after the game's release. On 19 April 2012, Activision announced plans for a game titled 007 Legends to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the James Bond film franchise. The game was described as a \\"greatest hits compilation\\", retelling six film narratives with an overarching storyline to connect them together. The missions were revealed to be based upon Goldfinger, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Moonraker, Licence to Kill and Die Another Day. On 9 November 2012, Activision added the last mission to the game, released as a downloadable content, which was based on Skyfall. The game was released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PC and Wii U and received negative reviews from critics. Developer Eurocom shut down soon after the game's release in December 2012. On 4 January 2013, Activision and Steam's online stores removed online availability and pages for Quantum of Solace, Blood Stone, and 007 Legends without explanation or warning, only to confirm three days later that the James Bond game license was revoked. A month later, Activision themselves declared that they would be backing away from licensed games in a formal statement. Future On 7 January 2014, president and co- founder of Telltale Games, Kevin Bruner has expressed an interest in making a future James Bond game if he were afforded the chance. He stated that \\"I'm a giant James Bond fan and I'm always frustrated by games that make him a mass murderer.\\" When he was asked which license he would adapt next if money and licensing hurdles were not a factor. \\"He's a super-spy, and that's a different skillset. The films make him less of a mass murderer, and there's not much killing in the books ‚Äì more spying and intrigue.\\" A rumour surfaced in June 2017 that Telltale was working on a video game entitled 007 Solstice. However, its status proved unlikely when Telltale filed for bankruptcy and closed down in November 2018. On 21 January 2016, president of Curve Digital, Dominic Wheatley expressed his interest alongside the company in the series, saying \\"I'd be very happy to have a James Bond licence. We could do a cracking game around that,\\" adding that these opportunities are overlooked by the bigger firms, since Electronic Arts and Activision have their own IPs and no longer want to \\"promote someone else's brand.\\" Cancelled games ;Octopussy (1983) Shortly after James Bond 007 was released in 1983 by Parker Brothers, another video game was announced, titled Octopussy, based on the film of the same name. The game was planned for release on the Atari 2600 System, Mattel Intellivision, and compatible systems. Set for release in the summer of 1983, it was cancelled for unknown reasons shortly after it was announced by Parker Brothers. ;GoldenEye 007 (1997; 2008) A racing version of GoldenEye 007 was announced for the Virtual Boy. The game was cancelled in 1996. A revamped version of the Nintendo 64 game GoldenEye 007 by Rare was scheduled for release on Xbox 360's Live Arcade on 27 February 2008, but Microsoft (who acquired Rare and their intellectual properties in 2002) couldn't get the publishing rights from the intellectual property owners, Danjaq, LLC, resulting in the cancelation of the project. It was rumored that Nintendo (the publisher of the original title) or Activision (who had exclusive rights to publish video games based on the James Bond franchise at the time) may have been involved in the project's cancellation, but no sources confirm the rumor. ;Tomorrow Never Dies: The Mission Continues (1998) The original VHS release of Tomorrow Never Dies featured a brief trailer with Desmond Llewelyn which highlighted a game that would \\"start where the film ends\\". Footage shows Bond skiing, scuba diving and driving in third person and on a first-person shooting mission. The game was to come out on PlayStation and PC in the fall of 1998 and was being made by MGM Interactive, not EA; EA was not involved in Bond until November of that year. Because MGM's motion picture division had licensed exclusive James Bond console rights to Nintendo (for GoldenEye 007 for the Nintendo 64), MGM had to buy some of their rights back from Nintendo in order to make the game. A Tomorrow Never Dies game was released on 16 November 1999, distributed by EA, but with notable differences from the 1998 attempt. The game was a third-person shooter with no scuba diving level. The story follows the plot of the film, not the continuation that had been planned. A level in the game sees Bond skiing down a mountain and killing a Japanese terrorist named Sotoshi Isagura (who had featured very briefly in the film), while on another stage Bond has a driving mission in Switzerland. These were not from the film and may have survived from the 'continuation' story. ;The World Is Not Enough (2000) A game based on the 1999 film The World Is Not Enough film and using the Quake III Arena engine for the PC and PlayStation 2 was cancelled in favor for Agent Under Fire. Electronic Arts thought, by 2001, that too much time has passed since the release of the film, and that fans would be no longer interested in the product as talks of the succeeding film in the series, Die Another Day, were taking place. ;007 Racing sequel (2001) A PlayStation 2 sequel to 007 Racing was rumoured to be in development. ;Bond6 (2005) EA Games began conceptual work on the game in 2003, under the working title of Bond6. The game was originally meant to be released in 2005, set to star Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. A video game adaptation of From Russia with Love began development when Brosnan announced that he was stepping down from the role, which ended plans for Bond6. The opening level planned for the former was retooled for the latter, and CGI work intended for the game was reused in television commercials for GoldenEye: Rogue Agent. ;Casino Royale (2006) A game was in development based on the film of the same name. Daniel Craig, in character as Bond, was going to give his voice and likeness to the video game. It was set to release on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms. The game was 15% developed when the project was cancelled, as Electronic Arts would not finish it by the film's release in November 2006. Later, unfinished development screenshots from the Venice level were uncovered. Activision's debut in the series, Quantum of Solace, combines the storylines of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. ;Blood Stone sequel (2011) In December 2010, some screenshots and a video were leaked online that depicted a new James Bond game, which shared similar gameplay to its predecessor, Blood Stone. Reportedly, the project had been in development by Raven Software, but was postponed six months prior to the leak, at which point the game was believed to be back in development. However, the game was ultimately cancelled due to Blood Stone's poor sales. ;Skyfall (2012) In January 2012, it was announced that a video game based on Skyfall would be released by Activision. Ultimately, a downloadable level based on Skyfall was released for Activision's 007 Legends, although a full game was not released. Other games=Mobile and smartphone games Since 2002, games featuring the Bond character and the 007 trademark have been published and distributed on mobile phones. The first two are based on action sequences from Die Another Day, one of them is titled Hover Chase and the other is Ice Racer. Both were published by Vodafone. With the official reboot of the film franchise in 2006, Sony Online Entertainment released a side-scroll action game based on Casino Royale developed by Glu Mobile, following a storyline inspired by the film. Similarly, an identical tie-in based on Quantum of Solace was released in 2008 by the same team. The same year, Sony Online Entertainment Los Angeles developed and published an arcade fighting game to coincide with the aforementioned film, entitled Top Agent. In 2014, it was reported that Glu Mobile was working on another mobile game bearing the James Bond license. A year later, its title was revealed as World of Espionage, a point-and-click game retelling several previous storylines from the film series, debuting an early access mode in July 2015 and releasing a full version of the game in November later that year. The game, after being universally panned for its uninspired content, was removed from the online mobile stores in December 2016 and Glu Mobile pulled the plug on the title. Fanmade remakes With the popularity laid by GoldenEye 007 in 1997 on the Nintendo 64, fans of the video game have made many attempts to remake or recreate the title with updated makeovers on current engines over time. But, only one project succeeded. Entitled GoldenEye: Source, the game entered development in 2005 and officially saw its international release in 2010, five years after being in beta mode hosted by the Source engine. It is a total conversion mod based on the multiplayer mode from the aforementioned title. A different team initiated similar attempts in 2013 to port the multiplayer mode from Nightfire (2002) to the Source engine, hoping to release it on Steam under the title Nightfire: Source. The project, as of today, remains in development. To commemorate the video game's 25th anniversary, another project based on GoldenEye 007 entered development in 2017 on Unreal Engine 4, with the aim of releasing it sometime in August 2022, based on the title's single-player campaign. However, in August 2020, the team received a cease and desist letter from Danjaq, forbidding the remake and stripping its use of any licensed asset related to the property, including James Bond and related characters. The project was reborn as Spies Don't Die ‚Äì an original experience \\"inspired by 90s first- person shooters\\". Appearance in other media Downloadable content featuring a pack of cars used in the James Bond films is available in Forza Horizon 4, officially branded and licensed by Danjaq, LLC.

Adler, Zigmund Feinman, Zigmund Mogulesko, Rudolf Marx, Mr. Krastoshinsky and David Kessler, 1888 David Kessler (1860 ‚Äì 1920) was a prominent actor in the first great era of Yiddish theater. As a star Yiddish dramatic performer in New York City, he was the first leading man in Yiddish theater to dispense with incidental music.  Early life  Born and raised in Chi≈üinƒÉu (then part of Imperial Russia, now the capital of independent Moldova), as an adolescent he improvised chaotic amateur plays in the stable of his father's inn, using fragments of what he had seen in the performances of Broder singers. A medical student named Geller apparently wrote him a more structured play, Mechtze the Matchmaker, which he and his friends put on.  Early career  At 16, he tried out for Israel Rosenberg's theater troupe when they passed through town for a month. He was offered a position as an extra, but his father forbid him to go on the road. Three years later he joined a different small travelling troupe, and spent three years travelling through Europe with that troupe, first in Russia and then in Romania. He moved to London in 1886, then immigrated to the United States in 1890,Leftwich, Joseph (2007). \\"David Kessler\\". Encyclopaedia Judaica. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA.

In one of the first Yiddish- language productions of Shakespeare, he played the title role in Othello, opposite Jacob Adler's Iago. He was responsible for bringing Bertha Kalich to America.  American Yiddish Theatre  In New York Kessler resumed his career. In 1891 he acted under Jacob Adler in Jacob Gordin's first play \\"Siberia\\". Later he appeared in other Gordin plays, including \\"God, Man, and Devil\\". Others of his outstanding roles were in Sholem Asch's \\"God of Vengeance\\", David Pinski's \\"Yankel the Smith\\", and Leon Kobrin's \\"Yankel Boile\\". He appeared at all the principal Lower East Side theatres in the Yiddish Theater District: the Thalia Theatre, the People's Theatre, and the Windsor Theatre. In 1899 he was awarded the Thalia Theatre in a divorce settlement from his wife Jennie.David Kessler Divorce Suit The New York Times Kessler's Thalia Theatre was located at 46-48 Bowery between Bayard and Canal Streets, across the street from the Windsor Theatre in Manhattan.Museum of Family History He was listed as being the Lessee and Manager; Sigmund Mogulesko is the Regisseur and B. Young is the theatre manager. In 1913 he established the David Kessler Theater, which ranked equally with Adler's and Boris Thomashefsky's theaters, and produced many plays by the leading Yiddish writers.Jewish Virtual Library In 1918 he starred in 'Mish Mash' with Nellie Casman at Edelstein's People's Theater.Zalmen Zylbercweig, Leksikon fun Yidishn teater, Book four, p 3651 The New York Times called him, \\"One of the leading Yiddish actors in the United States . . .\\" He was the manager of Kessler's Second Avenue Theatre.

He is a multi-instrumentalist, also playing mandolin, drums, piano, and harmonica. He has also released various solo albums and various recordings with his group The Well (1989-1995.) Koppes lives on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland where he also produces albums and conducts seasonal 'song writing' and 'performance for demo recording' short courses at Nambour TAFE, as well as offering private tuition in guitar, drums and song writing. His daughters are Tatiana 'O' Koppes and Neige Koppes who have their own band, Rain Party (formerly they played with The Kicks aka Bright Red). Sometimes incorrectly thought to be of Greek ancestry, Koppes actually has a mixed European ancestry: \\"My father's ancestry is Dutch, and there's southern French and Portuguese possibly. And my mother's ancestry is northern German but she says there's a Danish ancestor. The problem is she's got brown eyes and my grandmother had brown eyes and that's just not a Teutonic thing . Once she said we might have Gypsy blood...I've come to think I've got that spirit.\\" Robert Dean Lurie. No Certainty Attached: Steve Kilbey and the Church. Portland OR: Verse Chorus Press, 2009, p. 49 Early years Whilst growing up in Canberra in a musical family the sounds of the Hammond organ originally captivated him, and so began his journey as a musician. \\"I started playing drums with an interest in The Shadows, and then Jimi Hendrix's Mitch Mitchell really inspired me with his jazz style. I think Santana had the same effect and the guitar playing seeped in to me as well, although, musically I think of Pink Floyd as my template for a band\\". Peter was 12 when he became the drummer at school in a rock band called Bacchus Marsh. He then learned guitar from the members of this early group. Later, with another band called Timelord he played guitar, rehearsing in a local church hall. Steve Kilbey, who would later become his colleague in The Church, had a glam rock band called Beyond Beavers that would play there too. An invitation came in 1974 to replace one of the two drummers with Steve's band after they witnessed a drum solo he played on his drummer's kit. Peter joined, but the singer left and they became Precious Little, with Steve on vocals. Soon after, he reverted to guitarist as they transmuted into Baby Grande, with the addition of guitarist Dave Scotland and friend Joe Lee on bass. This two and a half year collaboration eventuated in some recordings, but he left to go to college studying electronics and engineering. After 12 months he decided to sell up and go to England/Europe for a year with a guitar, whence he began writing folk songs. Significant time was spent in Stockholm, Berlin, and London as well as on a tug boat on the waterways of Holland. An Eastern musical influence that appeared on his 1992 album Water-Rites may have been as a result of 2 weeks spent in Morocco. The Church On his return in March 1980, Koppes came to Sydney and formed a three-piece band, Limazine, in Sydney with Nick Ward on drums and began performing. Supposedly, the name was chosen as it was unclaimed, but later allusions to spiritual interests by Kilbey hint that it was less coincidental and it has been stated in Robert Dean Lurie's book on Steve Kilbey that the name comes FROM a line in the David Bowie song \\"Moonage Daydream\\". Initially, only Koppes was a fully proficient musician, Kilbey was an erratic bass guitarist and Willson-Piper was searching for his guitar style. It was not long before Koppes again teamed up to play music with Steve Kilbey who had recently moved too. Following an invitation to play a support from a manager/promoter friend, they formed The Church. Included was ex-Limazine drummer Nick Ward, aka Nigel Murray on drums, who was a less-than-favourite school colleague of Steve. Together they arranged and completed Steve's song ideas, and made a demo tape utilising studio time at a friend's 4 Track studio to record backing tracks that would later be overdubbed at home using Steve and Nick's recorders. At this time, Marty Willson-Piper (originally from Liverpool, United Kingdom) arrived in Australia and joined on guitar, and the band was renamed The Church. He attended a show with a friend of Koppes and was asked to join the band because he could play guitar, looked like he belonged in the band, and the music needed another player to develop it further. Willson-Piper contributed to the demo, and with Peter spent a week arranging his parts for some live shows. At the same time Koppes had garnered interest from publisher Chris Gilbey, of The Beatles' publishing company Northern Songs who then witnessed the first and only rehearsal with Willson- Piper before the gigs, however he missed the first show and the second was cancelled due to the band not wanting to risk being unable to pay for the PA and lights. Koppes then announced to Chris that the band couldn't continue and was disbanding. Gilbey said he would sign the band anyway, paying them a stipend, putting them in a rehearsal studio, recording an album. Gilbey found them an agent, leading to a record release with EMI. The Church achieved early chart success in Australia with songs such as 'The Unguarded Moment' and 'Almost With You' that were also released internationally. The band also gained recognition for its distinctive jangling harmony guitar style which was originally instigated by Koppes and sometimes mistakenly attributed solely to 12 string electric guitar. Soon after recording the second album The Blurred Crusade however, Koppes became disenchanted with several non-musical aspects of the band and intended to depart. He was convinced to return to participate in an Australian tour to promote the album which was then followed by a US visit with Kilbey to meet Capitol Records who were interested in signing the band. Thereafter Koppes continued with The Church to tour internationally, recording several more albums, though he recommenced writing and recording his own songs. His song 'As You Will' was included as a B/side and extra CD track for the band's Heyday album and some of the demos were released in 1987 as an EP called 'When Reason Forbids - A Requiem' and the album 'Manchild And Myth' on an independent Australian label. Later Rykodisc would combine them for release in the USA where the record attracted favourable notice in Billboard magazine's 'Recommended' section. In 1988, The Church had strong chart success in the USA and Australia with 'Under The Milky Way' and its corresponding album Starfish (album) which included a song written earlier by Koppes called 'A New Season\\". Pressures and extended absences may have brought about the split in Koppes's marriage, a topic which features in some songs on his second album 'From The Well' recorded and released soon after. At the time, Steve also invited Koppes to write and record some songs for his double solo album Remindlessness and he contributed \\"Danielle\\" and \\"Soul Sample\\". The Church then recorded Gold Afternoon Fix, which featured Koppes's song \\"Transient\\". This soon became a fan favourite and a much loved inclusion in their live set. This was followed by the album ‚ÄòPriest=Aura'. Koppes has been a continuous (as well as founding) member of The Church except for the four-year period 1992-1996. Due to mounting frustrations with artistic constraints on his input, Peter again felt disconnected from the band. Koppes' decision to leave The Church reflected two main factors; the band earned zero dollars for the two-week tour of Australia after all expenses had been paid, and secondly, he continued to feel shut out of the creative process - a long-standing complaint that stretched back at least as far as the Seance (album) days, if not further.Robert Dean Lurie. No Certainty Attached: Steve Kilbey and The Church. Portland OR: Verse Chorus press, 2009, p. 219 After recording the Priest=Aura album with the band, Koppes departed, leaving Steve Kilbey and Marty Willson- Piper the only remaining members. Temporary (drummer Jay Dee Daugherty lingered for a while but not for long. Kilbey and Willson-Piper recorded Sometime Anywhere as The Church even though they were at that time a duo. Koppes pursued his interest in his solo band The Well with ex-Flowers/Icehouse keyboardist Anthony Smith, and bassist Jim Leone of the Celibate Rifles. This band also included recently removed drummer of The Church, Richard Ploog, who had earlier invited Koppes to record and perform with Celibate Rifles' Damien Lovelock's solo project The Wigmen. They also performed some of Koppes's songs from his first album when they played live. Solo albums, The Well, collaborations with Margot Smith As well as his contributions to The Church, Koppes has also released several solo albums, and albums with his group The Well (1989-1995), which largely occupied his time on hiatus from The Church. The Well featured former Church drummer Richard Ploog on drums, Anthony Smith (inaugural keyboardist for Flowers/Icehouse) and Jim Leone of The Celibate Rifles on bass. The Well played live and recorded songs that were released as an EP called Iridescence and later the fan favourite solo album Water Rites. There was still contact with Steve Kilbey, who asked Koppes to play guitar on some songs for albums he was producing, Australian artists Margot Smith's Adored and Lifetime, Stephen Cummings' Everything Breaks Your Heart, and Canadian Mae Moore's Full Circle. Koppes collaborated on songwriting with singer Margot Smith, and played in her live band. (Steve Kilbey and Tim Powles also co-wrote, played and/or produced some of Smith's material on her first two albums Sleeping with the Lions (1993) and Taste (1998). Smith died in 2011; her third album Inhumaninane was released posthumously. The Church: Back in the Fold Koppes returned to The Church as a guest player on the album Magician Among the Spirits in 1996. In 1997 Koppes participated in what would become a new incarnation of the Church - under the title of The Refo:mation, Koppes, Kilbey and new drummer Powles (who had debuted on Sometime Anywhere) recorded the album Pharmakoi/Distance-Crunching Honchos with Echo Units. This reunification of sorts led to a suggestion that The Church reform for a tour to raise interest and funds for recording another album. This it did, producing Hologram of Baal released in 1998, marking Koppes' return to the Church fold. During this same period Koppes's Immersion Music record label was set up in partnership with mentor Sebastian Chase of MGM Distribution, to represent his previous solo catalogue and new solo release 'Love Era/Irony'. Included, was an album by Margot Smith called 'Taste' which featured Peter, Steve Kilbey and Tim Powles. The Church, reinvigorated, has since released many more lauded albums including the A Box Of Birds covers album, and After Everything Now This. On the Parallel Universe album, Peter sang the psychedelic 'Reward', on Forget Yourself the sublime 'Appalatia', on Uninvited, Like the Clouds he sings the epic 'Never Before', and on Untitled #23 vinyl edition, the very memorable 'LLC ' (an anagram for Little Love Central). In 2002, Peter released his 5th solo album 'Simple Intent'. He was involved in various stints including co-writing and recording the song \\"Moon Over Water\\" with Sydneysider New Folk artist David Lane in 2003, and as session guitarist on various tracks of Australian Hip Hop artist Figg Kidd's 2003 major label album, 'What Is Figg Kidd?'. Since relocation to the Sunshine Coast in Queensland Australia in 2004 Koppes has developed a song writing relationship with fellow local/international singer/songwriter Michelle Bradford-Jones. They produced soundtrack material and anthem song 'Journey of Friends ' for a fund raising cancer benefit documentary commemorating the Smiling For Smiddy Foundation. Not announced officially until mid 2020 was Koppes' departure again from The Church in mid 2019 following cancellation of the rest of the year's touring due to the drummer's severe foot injury sustained on last date of that USA tour. Since then he has produced and played on songs by emerging young local female singer songwriter Mayah whose 2019 debut single 'Endless Mistakes' achieved almost 500,000 streams within a year and second single 'Butterflies (the rush inside)' released in early 2020 achieved 40,000 in 6 months. Live streams of 3 performances were made together during the Corona Virus 19 pandemic. In July 2020 an EP released by Emma Tomlinson, also a Sunshine Coast, female, singer- songwriter, featured Koppes on finger style nylon guitar and Ebow electric guitar for the highlight track 'Silver Lightning'. They have also appeared live together on occasions such as Emma's sold out show for Noosa Alive Festival in 2019. Significantly in September 2020 following 2 singles and an EP, was the 'Lone Drifters?' album release by his new recording ensemble Syncretism with guitarist Dave Scotland, previously a fellow member of the Canberra glam rock band Baby Grande founded in the 70's with Steve Kilbey of The Church. Dave Scotland remained largely unknown except as a very celebrated guitarist by those who have heard his extraordinary playing, left-handed on a right-handed guitar. The modern sounding album is a co-production of Dave's songs and Koppes' lyrics, rich with their guitars and effects.

Its boundaries are not well-defined, but are generally considered to be Webster Street on the east, Golden Gate Avenue on the north, Divisadero Street on the west, and Fell Street on the south. Alamo Square Park, the neighborhood's focal point and namesake, consists of four city blocks at the top of a hill overlooking much of downtown San Francisco, with a number of large and architecturally distinctive mansions along the perimeter, including the \\"Painted Ladies\\", a well-known postcard motif. The park is bordered by Hayes Street to the south, Steiner Street to the east, Fulton Street to the north, and Scott Street to the west. Named after the lone cottonwood tree (\\"alamo\\" in Spanish), Alamo Hill, was a watering hole on the horseback trail from Mission Dolores to the Presidio in the 1800s. In 1856, Mayor James Van Ness created a park surrounding the watering hole, creating \\"Alamo Square\\". Attractions and characteristics Alamo Square Park includes a playground and a tennis court, and is frequented by neighbors, tourists, and dog owners. On a clear day, the Transamerica Pyramid building and the tops of the Golden Gate Bridge and Bay Bridge can be seen from the park's center. The San Francisco City Hall can be seen directly down Fulton Street. The area is part of the city's fifth Supervisorial district and is served by several Muni bus lines, including the 5, 21, 22, and 24. In 2016 it was closed for a $4.3 million renovation lasting seven months. Architecture The Alamo Square neighborhood is characterized by Victorian architecture that was left largely untouched by the urban renewal projects in other parts of the Western Addition. The Alamo Square area contains the second largest concentration of homes over in San Francisco, after the Pacific Heights neighborhood. Alamo Square from the air A row of Victorian houses facing the park on Steiner Street, known as the \\"Painted Ladies\\", are often shown in the foreground of panoramic pictures of the city's downtown area. A number of movies, television shows and commercials have been filmed in or around Alamo Square. The park features heavily in the 1978 horror film The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and the 2012 romantic comedy The Five-Year Engagement.Chamings, Andrew Wallace. 2013. The Lower Haight in Film The opening sequence of the American sitcom Full House (1987-1995) features a romp in Alamo Square Park with the famous row of Victorians in the background. Alamo Square facing south There are many architecturally significant mansions on the perimeter of the park, including the William Westerfeld House, the Archbishop's Mansion, the residences of the Russian and German Imperial consuls in the early 1900s, and the mansions on the block diagonally across from the Painted Ladies. In 1984, the Alamo Square Historic District was created by the Board of Supervisors, stating: Demographics The demographics of the neighborhood are characteristic of other urban neighborhoods that have undergone gentrification: many young people and upper- middle-class homeowners, in addition to a diverse older population. Divisadero Street, which divides Alamo Square from North Panhandle, is home to a number of small businesses including a growing collection of hip and popular restaurants and bars, catering to the young tech professionals who are contributing to the booming San Francisco startup economy, and who value Alamo Square's weather, conveniently central location and easy access to transportation options. Efforts on the part of Alamo Square and North Panhandle residents and merchants have led to restrictions on chain stores on the corridor. Neighborhood groups include the Alamo Square Neighborhood Association and the Haight-Divisadero Neighborhood Merchants Association.

Extent  The Broad Fourteens region is located off the coast of the Netherlands and south of the Dogger Bank, roughly between longitude 3¬∞E and 4¬∞30'E and latitude 52¬∞30'N and 53¬∞30'N. The area is known to the Dutch and German navies as the Breeveertien. Geologically it is comparable to the Long Forties, another submerged plateau that has related origins.  Naval battles  The area has been the scene of many naval engagements throughout history.

It allows people to sign in using just one identity to various systems run by federations of different organizations or institutions. The federations are often universities or public service organizations. The Shibboleth Internet2 middleware initiative created an architecture and open-source implementation for identity management and federated identity-based authentication and authorization (or access control) infrastructure based on Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). Federated identity allows the sharing of information about users from one security domain to the other organizations in a federation. This allows for cross- domain single sign-on and removes the need for content providers to maintain user names and passwords. Identity providers (IdPs) supply user information, while service providers (SPs) consume this information and give access to secure content. History The Shibboleth project grew out of Internet2. Today, the project is managed by the Shibboleth Consortium. Two of the most popular software components managed by the Shibboleth Consortium are the Shibboleth Identity Provider and the Shibboleth Service Provider, both of which are implementations of SAML. The project was named after an identifying passphrase used in the Bible (Judges ) because Ephraimites were not able to pronounce \\"sh\\". The Shibboleth project was started in 2000 to facilitate the sharing of resources between organizations with incompatible authentication and authorization infrastructures. Architectural work was performed for over a year prior to any software development. After development and testing, Shibboleth IdP 1.0 was released in July 2003. This was followed by the release of Shibboleth IdP 1.3 in August 2005. Version 2.0 of the Shibboleth software was a major upgrade released in March 2008. It included both IdP and SP components, but, more importantly, Shibboleth 2.0 supported SAML 2.0. The Shibboleth and SAML protocols were developed during the same timeframe. From the beginning, Shibboleth was based on SAML, but, where SAML was found lacking, Shibboleth improvised, and the Shibboleth developers implemented features that compensated for missing features in SAML 1.1. Some of these features were later incorporated into SAML 2.0, and, in that sense, Shibboleth contributed to the evolution of the SAML protocol. Perhaps the most important contributed feature was the legacy Shibboleth AuthnRequest protocol. Since the SAML 1.1 protocol was inherently an IdP-first protocol, Shibboleth invented a simple HTTP-based authentication request protocol that turned SAML 1.1 into an SP-first protocol. This protocol was first implemented in Shibboleth IdP 1.0 and later refined in Shibboleth IdP 1.3. Building on that early work, the Liberty Alliance introduced a fully expanded AuthnRequest protocol into the Liberty Identity Federation Framework. Eventually, Liberty ID-FF 1.2 was contributed to OASIS, which formed the basis for the OASIS SAML 2.0 Standard. Architecture Shibboleth is a web-based technology that implements the artifact and attribute push profiles of SAML, including both Identity Provider (IdP) and Service Provider (SP) components. Shibboleth 1.3 has its own technical overview, architectural document, and conformance document that build on top of the SAML 1.1 specifications. Shibboleth 1.3 In the canonical use case: # A user first accesses a resource hosted by a web server (the service provider) that has Shibboleth content protection enabled. # The SP crafts a proprietary authentication request that is passed through the browser using URL query parameters to supply the requester's SAML entityID, the assertion consumption location, and optionally the end page to return the user to. # The user is redirected to either their home IdP or a WAYF (Where Are You From) service, where they select their home IdP for further redirection. # The user authenticates to an access control mechanism external to Shibboleth. # Shibboleth generates a SAML 1.1 authentication assertion with a temporary \\"handle\\" contained within it. This handle allows the IdP to recognize a request about a particular browser user as corresponding to the principal that authenticated earlier. # The user is POSTed to the assertion consumer service of the SP. The SP consumes the assertion and issues an AttributeQuery to the IdP's attribute service for attributes about that user, which may or may not include the user's identity. # The IdP sends an attribute assertion containing trusted information about the user to the SP. # The SP either makes an access control decision based on the attributes or supplies information to applications to make decisions themselves. Shibboleth supports a number of variations on this base case, including portal-style flows whereby the IdP mints an unsolicited assertion to be delivered in the initial access to the SP, and lazy session initiation, which allows an application to trigger content protection through a method of its choice as required. Shibboleth 1.3 and earlier do not provide a built-in authentication mechanism, but any Web- based authentication mechanism can be used to supply user data for Shibboleth to use. Common systems for this purpose include CAS or Pubcookie. The authentication and single-sign-on features of the Java container in which the IdP runs (Tomcat, for example) can also be used. Shibboleth 2.0 Shibboleth 2.0 builds on SAML 2.0 standards. The IdP in Shibboleth 2.0 has to do additional processing in order to support passive and forced authentication requests in SAML 2.0. The SP can request a specific method of authentication from the IdP. Shibboleth 2.0 supports additional encryption capacity. Attributes Shibboleth's access control is performed by matching attributes supplied by IdPs against rules defined by SPs. An attribute is any piece of information about a user, such as \\"member of this community\\", \\"Alice Smith\\", or \\"licensed under contract A\\". User identity is considered an attribute, and is only passed when explicitly required, which preserves user privacy. Attributes can be written in Java or pulled from directories and databases. Standard X.520 attributes are most commonly used, but new attributes can be arbitrarily defined as long as they are understood and interpreted similarly by the IdP and SP in a transaction. Trust Trust between domains is implemented using public key cryptography (often simply TLS server certificates) and metadata that describes providers. The use of information passed is controlled through agreements. Federations are often used to simplify these relationships by aggregating large numbers of providers that agree to use common rules and contracts. Development Shibboleth is open- source and provided under the Apache 2 license. Many extensions have been contributed by other groups. Adoption Federations have been formed in many countries around the world to build trust structures for the exchange of information using SAML and Shibboleth software. Many major content providers support Shibboleth-based access. In February 2006, the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) of the Higher Education Funding Councils of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland announced that it would move from the Athens authentication system to an access-management system based on Shibboleth technology. Since then it has updated its position and is endorsing a federated access management solution rather than Shibboleth itself.

At , McLaren Park is the third largest park in San Francisco by area, after Golden Gate Park and Presidio. The park is surrounded mostly by the Excelsior, Crocker-Amazon, Visitacion Valley, Portola and University Mound neighborhoods. History John McLaren Park was once a part of Rancho Ca√±ada de Guadalupe la Visitaci√≥n y Rodeo Viejo, an 1840 land grant which included much of present-day San Bruno Mountain, the city of Brisbane, Guadalupe Valley, and Visitacion Valley. The then-governor of Mexico (including present-day California), Juan Bautista Alvarado granted what is now known as John McLaren Park to the local authorities in 1840. Daniel Burnham's proposed plan for San Francisco from September 1905. In 1905, subdivisions of the land grant were drawn up and Daniel Burnham issued the Burnham Plan for San Francisco, which recommended that the land where John McLaren and Bayview Parks are today should be reserved for park use, as residents in the southern part of the City were considered inadequately served by access to park space. Burnham's Report called for several parks near Visitacion Valley, including one he named Visitacion Park, which would become Bayview Park and Candlestick Point State Recreation Area; and one he named University Mound Park, which occupied part of the land that would later become John McLaren Park. In the wake of the 1906 earthquake and fire, rather than implement Burnham's plan, city officials expediently rebuilt the city using the grids that had been previously laid out. The Board of Supervisors adopted Resolution No. 26241, New Series on October 4, 1926 (approved Oct 15) directing the purchase of for a park planned to be named Mission Park,The Master Plan of San Francisco (1944), p. 2 with plans for an 18-hole golf course, equestrian trails, playing fields, and a possible relocation of the City Zoo. The Board would rename the planned park in honor of John McLaren's service to the city on November 29, 1926, and McLaren celebrated the dedication of the park in 1927, during a December tree- planting ceremony Boy Scouts participated in the planting of three separate plantings called ‚ÄúMemorial Redwood Groves.‚Äù. The widow of Luther Burbank donated ten four-year-old walnut trees to the children of the City. These trees, the first to be planted at McLaren Park, were intended to serve as the nucleus of a planned orchard of fruit and nut-bearing trees. However, a bond measure to raise funds for the full area of the park failed to pass in the November 1928 election, and the San Francisco Board of Supervisors would scale back the planned park size while acquiring properties from 1928 to 1946. In 1932, the Park Commission recommended a reduced park size of .The Master Plan of San Francisco (1944), p. 1 Additional recommendations for final park size in 1944 varied from , and the land acquired by the time the Master Plan was published in November 1944 was at a total cost of . Several areas in the original 550-acre proposed park area were used to build the School and Convent of the Good Shepherd of San Francisco (the school, which was operated from 1932‚Äì1977, was later known as University Mound High School and served 'delinquent' girls), the Lick Home (later known as the University Mound Ladies Home, which opened as the Lick Old Ladies Home in a different location in 1884 and housed \\"elderly women of modest means\\" until 2014), the University Mound reservoirs, the Sunnydale Housing Project, and the Crocker Amazon Playground. The Works Progress Administration was responsible for the construction of a scenic drive in the 1930s. At that time, the park also featured a stable and equestrian trails, but horseback riding within the park was later discontinued due to the difficulty of maintaining a separate set of equestrian trails. The current park boundaries were established in 1946. A City Planning Department report, issued in 1950, recommended construction of a segment of the planned Crosstown Freeway, which was built as Mansell Street between Brazil Avenue and San Bruno Avenue; however, once Interstate 280 was completed, the Crosstown Freeway was cancelled. The park expanded to its present size in 1958 through land purchases. Many of the present-day playgrounds, golf course, and hiking trails were added between 1950 and 1980. A draft master plan was prepared in 1983, updated in 1988, and issued in 1996, following a 1987 bond passed by San Francisco voters to allocate $2.4 million for major park improvements.John McLaren Park Master Plan (1997), p. 4. The park is currently the second- largest park in the City. Public safety During a period of minimal City investment in the 1980s and 1990s, McLaren Park acquired a checkered reputation as a dangerous place with numerous crimes threatening visitor safety and a dumping ground for bodies. But in the new millennium, and as part of the City's focus on the Southern part of the city, plus its active community advocates, volunteer programs and municipal investment have added several new amenities and increased public usage. Perhaps due to its past infamy and resulting discouragement of visitors, the park boasts the largest grasslands left in San Francisco. In recent years the park has seen many positive improvements, and, as happens in Golden Gate Park, has had a few murders occurring in its less-frequented areas. The increased activity, staffing, investment and oversight, including having an on-site Park Ranger station and the Park Service Area staff present, have led to a positive and safer park experience. Amenities and features Coffman Pool, McLaren Park's first recreation facility, was constructed in the southeast corner of the park in 1958. A master plan for the park was published in 1959 which called for the creation of more recreational facilities, including a 9-hole golf course (later named the Gleneagles Golf Course), overnight campsites, picnic areas, trails, a nursery, two lakes, and parking areas. Construction of the facilities included in the 1959 Master Plan (The Gleneagles Golf Course, McNab Lake, Louis Sutter, Herz, and Mansfield-Burrows Playground, the Wilde Overlook, and the amphitheater‚Äîlater to be renamed the Jerry Garcia Amphitheater) began in the 1960s, and also included new trails, picnic and parking areas, community gardens, and an irrigation system. Before 1978, McLaren Park only had eight picnic tables. Later construction contracts included the addition of more picnic tables and large group picnic areas. Similarly, before 1977, the park only had of improved trails, including sidewalks; of trails were added by 1997, mostly following contour lines to limit path grades and the park could be fully circumnavigated by foot.John McLaren Park Master Plan (1997), p. 17 Even in San Francisco, a city considered hilly, McLaren Park stands out with some of the hilliest terrain in the City. Only 19% of its area consists of slopes of 0-10% grade, considered easily buildable. Slopes of 10-25% grade occupy half its area, and slopes over 25% grade occupy the remaining area (more than one-third of the total area). The original 1926 proposed park of had approximately 40% of its area with gentle slopes. Gleneagles Golf Course The 9-hole golf course was completed in 1961. It occupies and is operated by a leaseholder.John McLaren Park Master Plan (1997), p. 16 Herz Playground Herz Playground, near Coffman Pool in the southeastern corner of the park, was completed in 1965. Jerry Garcia Amphitheatre The San Francisco Recreation Department constructed a multi-purpose outdoor amphitheatre in the center of McLaren Park in 1970 and named it the McLaren Park Amphitheatre; it officially opened in 1971 with \\"excellent acoustics\\" for the 700 seats. In 1997, it was noted the amphitheatre had not seen many shows, possibly because of the limited stage, storage facilities, dressing rooms, and parking. The first \\"Jerry Day\\" celebration on stage in the amphitheater was held in 2003, celebrating the birthday of the Excelsior District native and Grateful Dead musician Jerry Garcia with birthday cake and \\"Cherry Garcia\\" ice cream served to concertgoers. In July 2005, the San Francisco Recreation and Park Commission passed a resolution officially renaming the venue the Jerry Garcia Amphitheatre. Garcia had grown up not far from the park, at 87 Harrington Street. The amphitheater was officially re-dedicated on 29 October 2005 during a ceremony featuring performances by Jefferson Starship, Jefferson Galactic Family Reunion, Mystery Cats, Grapefruit Ed Acoustic, The Little Wheels Band, Jerry Rigged, Michael John Ahern, David Gans and Ben Fong-Torres. La Grande Tank La Grande Tank is the prominent blue water tank on the western edge of the park, visible from Interstate 280 and the Excelsior neighborhood. It was built in 1956 and stands tall. During the seismic upgrades performed in 2006, money was set aside to improve what became the Philosopher's Way trail. Louis Sutter Playground Louis Sutter Playground, near McNab Lake in the northeastern corner of the park, was completed in 1965. Mansell Street Mansell Street was a four-lane divided road running east‚Äìwest across McLaren Park, roughly dividing it into northern and southern halves. It was completed in 1963 and had been used as a shortcut to Candlestick Point and occasional street-racing dragstrip, but it was reconstructed as a two-lane road during the Mansell Street Corridor Improvement Project, a construction job lasting one year. One side of the road was rebuilt as a dedicated pedestrian and bicycle path, and crosswalks with bright flashing beacons were added to major intersections, allowing foot traffic between the north and south halves of the park. Mansell Street through McLaren Park is significantly wider than the city streets it connects with on the western and eastern edges of the park. It was designed and constructed as a segment of the planned Crosstown Freeway which never came to fruition in the wake of the San Francisco Freeway Revolts. Mansfield-Burrows Playground Mansfield-Burrows Playground, near La Grande Tank in the northwestern corner of the park, was added in 1978. Philosopher's Way A loop trail around the perimeter of the park called Philosopher's Way was dedicated on 5 January 2013. The trail, funded as a public art set-aside by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, offers views of Mount Diablo, Mount Tamalpais, Angel Island, and the Pacific Ocean on a clear day. It was co-designed by artists Peter Richards and Susan Schwatzenberg and features fourteen stone markers by mason George Gonzalez intended as \\"musing stations\\" to stimulate contemplation. Wilde Reservoir Overlook The Wilde Reservoir Overlook, on the eastern edge of the park at the intersection of Mansell Street and Visitacion Avenue, was completed and opened to the public in 1981.John McLaren Park Master Plan (1997), p. 8 The Wilde Reservoir was used to store tap water for the City of San Francisco, but after its abandonment, was used as a nocturnal dumping ground for trash. The old walls of the reservoir were retained as a viewing platform and a tall tower was built in the center of it. However, the tower was padlocked and has been closed to the public since the late 1990s. Yosemite Marsh In the northeast corner of the park is Yosemite Marsh, a habitat for native species that include the forktail damselfly and flowering quillwort. Named a \\"significant natural resource area\\" by the city in 1995, the marsh marks the origin of Yosemite Creek, a body of water that flows through underground culverts towards Candlestick Point. ref name=\\"Kamiya\\"> Gallery File:Blue water tower (2276712148).jpgLa Grande Tank in the northwestern corner of the park.

She was named for Pearl Harbor, where World War II began for the United States. Pearl Harbor was laid down on 27 January 1995, by the Avondale Shipyards, New Orleans, La.; launched on 24 February 1996; and commissioned on 30 May 1998. As of September 06, 2018, Pearl Harbor is homeported to NS San Diego, California, and assigned to Commander Amphibious Squadron 1 (COMPHIBRON 1). Service history On 4 May 2008 the ship departed San Diego for assignment in the Persian Gulf as part of the Peleliu amphibious assault group. On 21 July 2008, Pearl Harbor was run aground on a shoal off of Kuwait without damage. Following the incident, Commander Xavier F. Valverde was relieved of command by Rear Admiral Kendall Card, commander of Expeditionary Strike Group 3, and reassigned to shore staff duty in Bahrain. Captain Mike Slotsky, deputy commodore of Destroyer Squadron 9 in Everett, Washington, was assigned to oversee the ship temporarily. San Diego Union-Tribune, \\"Commander Is Reassigned After Ship Runs Aground\\", 29 July 2008. On 20 May 2010 the ship departed on a WESTPAC deployment as a part of the Peleliu Amphibious Readiness Group, where she participated in relief efforts following devastating floods in Pakistan in September 2010. Following her aid to Pakistani victims, she sailed south to Somalia where she conducted counter-piracy operations and lent aid to over 60 Somali refugees for over a month. She returned to her homeport of San Diego, California on 17 December 2010. On 14 November 2011 the ship departed on a WESTPAC deployment as part of the Makin Island Amphibious Readiness Group. She returned to San Diego on 22 June 2012. From May through August 2013, Pearl Harbor deployed independently in support of Pacific Partnership 2013, providing humanitarian aid to the island nations of Samoa, Tonga, New Caledonia, Marshall Islands, Kiribati, and Soloman Islands. On 15 April 2014, the ship entered an Extended Docking Phased Maintenance Availability (EDPMA) to complete her midlife overhaul. After numerous extensions due to unplanned growth work, Pearl Harbor completed her extensive overhaul in May 2016. The ship participated in Southern California Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) in July 2016 where it supported amphibious operations in conjunction with Australian, Canadian, Japanese, and German coalition partners under command of CDR Judd Krier.

The U.S. Navy sent a single cruiser, , to capture the island of Guam, then under Spanish control. However, the Spanish garrison on the island had no knowledge of the war and no real ability to resist the American forces. They surrendered without resistance and the island passed into American control. The event was the only conflict of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War on Guam. Background Guam had been under Spanish control since 1668. By the time of the war, however, Guam had been neglected and there were only small amounts of Spanish military presence. The last message the authorities on Guam had received from Spain was dated April 14, 1898, a month before war was declared. Henry Glass, captain of the cruiser Charleston, was en route from California to Manila when in Honolulu he was joined by three transport ships, City of Peking, City of Sydney, and Australia.Patrick McSherry, The Capture of Guam, Spanamwar.com Then in the Pacific he opened his sealed orders that read, > Upon the receipt of this order, which is forwarded by the steamship 'City of > Pekin' to you at Honolulu, you will proceed, with the 'Charleston' and the > 'City of Pekin' in company, to Manila, Philippine Islands. On your way, you > are hereby directed to stop at the Spanish Island of Guam. You will use such > force as may be necessary to capture the port of Guam, making prisoners of > the governor and other officials and any armed force that may be there. You > will also destroy any fortifications on said island and any Spanish naval > vessels that may be there, or in the immediate vicinity. These operations at > the Island of Guam should be very brief, and should not occupy more than one > or two days. Should you find any coal at the Island of Guam, you will make > such use of it as you consider desirable. It is left to your discretion > whether or not you destroy it. From the Island of Guam, proceed to Manila > and report to Rear-Admiral George Dewey, U.S.N., for duty in the squadron > under his command. Australia and City of Sydney departing from San Francisco, on their way to the Philippines The message created intense excitement and enthusiasm amongst the American sailors. Many of them immediately went to the ship's library and eagerly scrutinized charts, geographies, histories, and encyclopaedias for information.Walker p.3 While the sailors were in the ship's library learning information about the island of Guam, Captain Glass altered the direction of the cruiser towards the new destination. The sailors on the transports were stirred when they noticed the change in direction, and rumors started instantly. Some thought the expedition was to hoist the American flag over the Caroline Islands and remain there until reinforcements arrived for a stronger descent upon Manila. Others guessed that the Charleston was sailing to some mysterious Spanish island, complete with impregnable fortifications, a formidable force of Spanish soldiers, and vast quantities of coal. The rumors stopped the next day, when the expeditions's objectives were wigwagged to the transports.Walker p.5 Along with the sealed orders were warnings of possible Spanish man of wars in San Luis d'Apra, the main port of Guam, and notification of it being protected by a heavy battery of guns. The existence of the powerful coastal defences were verified by reputable travelers who had visited the island within 1896 or 1895. Definite information of the size of the Spanish garrison was not given, and in the absence of direct knowledge, the captain of the cruiser had to assume that there might be more than a thousand fighting men on the island who were thoroughly familiar with the terrain. Glass held a conference on the Australia, and invited General Anderson, Commander William C. Gibson, naval officer in charge of the transports, and the captains of the three troop carriers were invited to participate in the discussions. Also present at the meeting was T. A. Hallet, third officer of Australia and a former whaling captain, who had been to the Mariana Islands many times. Hallet told the group that on his last visit to Guam, San Luis d'Apra was strongly fortified. Fort Santa Cruz and the battery on Point Orote, he stated, were efficiently manned and equipped. After a complete appraisal of all the known and unknown factors in the impending battle, the officers completed the arrangements for the attack on Guam. It was soon noticed by the troops that the Charleston expected a fight, since the cruiser began firing subcaliber ammunition at boxes tossed from the City of Peking. This mild training continued until the afternoon of June 15, when the American cruiser started circling and firing service charges at pyramidal cloth targets set adrift from the cruiser herself. The range was about , and the gun crews, which were composed largely of the green recruits under the command of Second Lieutenant John Twiggs Myers, were shooting accurately enough to cause Captain Glass to smile pleasantly. By the time the convoy crossed the 180th meridian, the officers and men felt they were ready for the enemy.Walker p.6 Capture On June 20, Captain Glass arrived off the shore of Guam, and he noticed that the only ship in the harbor was a Japanese ship that was trading copra. Many of the men on USS Charleston were disappointed that there were no Spanish ships to engage. As the cruiser proceeded on its way, a small group of curious inhabitants gathered on the shores of Piti, a landing place down the bay. These locals were aware of the presence of the American vessels, for they had been sighted early that morning. All of the important citizens of Guam were there with the exception of the governor, Don Juan Marina. The chief officials present were a lieutenant commander of the navy and captain of the port, Don Francisco Guti√©rrez, Don Jos√© Romero, naval surgeon, and Captain Pedro Duarte Andurra of the marine corps, and Jos√© Sixto, civil paymaster. Among the prominent civilians at the beach were Francisco Portusach, the leading merchant of Guam, and his brother Jos√© Portusach. While the gathering was looking curiously at the cruiser and the three transports, Charleston fired 13 rounds at the old Spanish fortress from three of her guns. There was no return fire, and there was no apparent damage to the fort.Walker p.7 Pedro Duarte turned to his companions and said that the ship must be saluting the fort, so he hurriedly dispatched a messenger to Agana, the capital, which was about away, requesting the governor to send artillery to Piti to return the salute. The captain of the port, the naval surgeon, and a native Chamorro named Jos√© Paloma got into a boat furnished by Francisco Portusach and went out to welcome the visitors. Jos√© Portusach went along with the party to act as interpreter. When they finally got aboard the deck of Charleston, Glass immediately informed them that war had been declared between the U.S. and Spain. The Spanish officials were amazed when they heard this and the news that they were now prisoners of war, because no dispatches or mail had arrived since April 9 to enlighten them. They were then paroled for the day when they promised to return to Agana to inform the governor of the war and notify him to appear on board the American ship immediately. The party then went below deck into the captain's cabin to discuss the surrender of the island.Walker p.8 As they were going below, Francisco Portusach sailed across the bow of the Charleston in a whaleboat with the American flag at the topmast. A loud voice from the ship called, \\"Frank, come on board.\\" Portusach looked up to the deck and saw Captain Hallett, a man whom he had known years before. The skipper of the whaleboat then went to the lee side of the cruiser and clambered aboard. When he reached the deck, he was surprised to find a reporter with whom he was acquainted, a representative of the San Francisco Chronicle. While the reporter and the old whaling captain were talking about old times, Lieutenant William Braunersreuther, the navigator, walked up to Portusach and demanded to know by what right he was hoisting the American flag at the topmast of the little boat. The Guam merchant merely grinned and replied the flag was being flown legally. The lieutenant promptly requested proof, and Portusach produced American naturalization papers from an inside coat pocket and handed them to the doubting Braunersreuther who looked at them and said, \\"Well! Twenty-second of October, 1888, Chicago, Cook County, State of Illinois.\\" The navigator examined the document more thoroughly and requested Portusach to accompany him to visit Glass. The \\"welcoming party\\" had just departed for shore, so the two men entered the captain's cabin, and the lieutenant handed the naturalization papers to Glass who looked at them for a few moments. He had already heard from Jos√© Portusach that Francisco possessed some lighters and boats, so he greeted the merchant by inquiring if it was possible to obtain the use of two lighters and a boat to transfer coal from City of Peking to the bunkers of Charleston and offered to pay for the service. Portusach agreed to furnish the boats without compensation since he felt an obligation, as the only United States citizen on the island, to aid his country in time of war. City of Peking, City of Sydney, and Australia passing through the Golden Gate Francisco Portusach returned to Piti where his brother was waiting for him, and was informed that the Spanish officers were under arrest, but had been paroled with the understanding that they would deliver themselves on board Charleston so they might be taken to Manila as prisoners of war. Francisco then ordered his head boatman, Tiburcio de los Santos, and several of his men to deliver the lighters and boats to Charleston early in the morning. The two brothers got into their buggy and started for Agana. On the road home they met several soldiers who were struggling with two small artillery pieces which had been turned back by Captain Duarte since it was not necessary to salute the American cruiser. When they arrived home, a letter was waiting for Francisco from Governor Marina which said: \\"If you give any assistance to the American men of war, you will be executed tomorrow morning at the beach.\\" After reading the note, Guam's leading merchant laughed. His wife, an American woman he had married in San Francisco, asked what was in the message, and became apprehensive when he told her. Jose warned him to be careful, especially when he learned that boats had already been promised to the Americans. His brother replied that the boats would be delivered in the morning regardless of the threatening message.Walker p.9 Later that afternoon, Francisco Portusach, despite the display of bravado, was worried, so he returned to Charleston with the threatening note from Marina and showed it to Glass. They had conferred less than half an hour when the governor's secretary came back to the cruiser with a letter which said: > Agana, June 20, 1898. > Mr. Henry Glass, > Captain of the North American Cruiser Charleston: > By the captain of the port in which you have cast anchor I have been > courteously requested, as a soldier, and, above all, as a gentleman, to hold > a conference with you, adding that you have advised him that war has been > declared between our respective nations, and that you have come for the > purpose of occupying these Spanish islands. It would give me great pleasure > to comply with his request and see you personally, but, as the military laws > of my country prohibit me from going on board a foreign vessel, I regret to > have to decline this honor and to ask that you will kindly come on shore, > where I await you to accede to your wishes as far as possible, and to agree > as to our mutual situations. Asking your pardon for the trouble I cause you, > I guarantee your safe return to your ship. Very respectfully, > JUAN MARINA > The Governor By this time, Glass suspected that the governor was perpetrating a trick. An ultimatum was prepared for delivery to the governor of Guam and arrangements were made for a presentation of it on the following morning. At 08:00 the next morning, Lieutenant Braunersreuther was waiting to take command of a landing party composed of the Marine guard of Charleston, the Marines from City of Peking, and two companies of the Oregon volunteer regiment on Australia. He had specific instructions to go ashore and capture the governor, his officers, and any armed forces on the island. The men had difficulty in getting the boats ready, so the lieutenant left without them in a small boat, merely taking with him Ensign Waldo Evans, four sailors, and two newspaper reporters, Douglas White and Sol Sheridan. He landed at the harbor of Piti under a flag of truce and there he was met by Governor Marina and his staff. After formal introduction, Braunersreuther handed the governor this ultimatum from Captain Glass: \\"Sir: In reply to your communication of this date I have now, in compliance with the orders of my government, to demand the immediate surrender of the defenses of the Island of Guam, with arms of all kinds, all officials and persons in the military service of Spain now in this island. This communication will be handed you tomorrow morning by an officer who is ordered to wait not over one half hour for your reply.\\"Walker p.10 village of Piti Then Braunersreuther called the governor's attention to the fact that only 30 minutes were allowed for a reply, and casually reminded him of the three transports loaded with troops and the formidable war vessel in the harbor. Marina and his advisers went into a nearby boatshed for consultation. Twenty- nine minutes later, they reappeared and handed the lieutenant a sealed envelope addressed to the commanding officer of Charleston. The captain's emissary, amid vigorous protestations from the governor, broke the seal and read the message which contained a notification of the surrender of the island of Guam. He then said, \\"Gentlemen, you are now my prisoners; you will have to repair on board the Charleston with me.\\" The governor protested, claiming that he had not expected such action. He accused the lieutenant of treachery, as the Americans had come ashore under a flag of truce, before making the Spaniards prisoners of war. Braunersreuther replied that he had merely been instructed to deliver a letter and since he was now in possession of an offer of complete surrender, the Americans were permitted to make any demand they wished. The Spanish officials were allowed to write letters to their families. Afterward, Marina and his staff were taken to City of Sydney after sending an order to Agana for the Spanish soldiery and native militia to be at Piti landing no later than four o'clock that afternoon. Braunsreuther then returned to the ships, obtained the marine guard, and returned to shore. There, according to agreement, the Spanish soldiers were lined up awaiting surrender. Lieutenant John Twiggs Myers, later known for his command during the Boxer Rebellion, marched the Marines through the boathouse and lined them up so that the Spanish and native troops were between the Americans and the ocean. The 54 Spanish regulars and two lieutenants were disarmed, placed in a sampan, and transported to City of Sydney. Aftermath Glass went ashore and raised an American flag over the fortifications while the bands aboard Australia and City of Peking played \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\". His orders included destroying the island's forts, but Glass decided that they were in such disrepair that he left them as they were. Francisco Portusach and his workers finally completed transferring the coal from City of Peking to Charleston on June 22. Afterward, Glass took him to his cabin, and appointed him Governor of the island, until the arrival of proper American authority. After saying goodbye to the natives, Charleston and the three transports left the harbor at 16:00, and later joined George Dewey's fleet at Manila.Walker p.11 NotesReferences * , , .

Madras Music Academy is one of the earliest established music academies in South India. Before the concept of infrastructure was introduced to India in the early 1920s, it was a gathering for elite musicians simply called (and is still more commonly referred to as) Music Academy () It plays an important role in encouraging and promoting primarily the Carnatic Music Indian art form. It played a vital role in the revival of the Indian classical dance form of Bharatnatyam in the 1930s when it faced near extinction due to a negative connotation caused by conservative societal standards. They also run a music school called the Teachers college of Carnatic Music which has many eminent musicians on its faculty. Musicians such as Tiger Varadachariar, Appa Iyer, Valadi Krishnaiyer and Mudicondan Venkatarama Iyer adorned the chair of Principal of the prestigious Teacher's College. History In 1927, the Indian National Congress held the All India Music Conference in Madras. At the end of the conference it was decided that an organisation be formed that helped the cause of music. The prime reason for this conference was E. Krishna Iyer who had played a vital role in reviving the south Indian dance art form‚ÄîBharatanatyam. The Academy was formally inaugurated on 18 August 1928 by C. P. Ramaswami Iyer, in the Y.M.I.A. Auditorium before a large and distinguished gathering. Annual music conferences are held every December to collect all information regarding music, maintain the library and publish a journal. They also help to bring to public notice aspiring musicians and scholars by conducting competitions and other presentations. For a decade, E. Krishna Iyer worked as the Secretary of the Madras Music Academy. The first Music Festival was held in December 1927 which is before the inauguration of the Music Academy. Since then, it had become a part of the Madras Music Academy's Activities to conduct several expositions and concerts on Carnatic Music every December. This later came to be popularly known as the Margazhi Season or is even referred to as the Music Season amongst Carnatic enthusiasts. This soon became the norm for all sabhas in Madras to conduct several concerts each day during the season. There were several sabhas before the formation of the Music Academy like the Parthasarathy Swami Sabha in Triplicane which was formed as early as 1900. However, it was the Madras Music Academy that set the trend of conducting the music festival during December. Dr U. Rama Rao was the founder President of the Academy and Basheer Ahmed Sayeed, the founder Vice-President. There have been six others in that post. The present President is Sri N. Murali. Before the present building (T. T. Krishnamachari Auditorium) was constructed, the annual conferences and programmes were held in various locations around the city. The building During the first few years, the Academy conducted its activities provisionally in George Town and later moved to Mylapore. In 1955, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation stone for the music academy building that exists today on TTK Road in Mylapore. On 20 December 1962, Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wodeyar Bahadur, the then Governor of Madras. There are two buildings for the Music Academy: # The T.T. Krishnamachari Hall # The Kasturi Srinivasan Hall The T.T. Krishnamachari Hall is the first building that was built in 1955. It has a seating capacity of 1600. The Kasturi Srinivasan Hall was built in 1982. It houses a small auditorium for conferences and concerts, a library, a committee room and a recording and demonstration room. It was here that T. N. Rajarathnam Pillai's tapes and audio CDs were produced. Kasturi Srinivasan's nephew's son, N. Murali, the Joint Managing Director of The Hindu, is the present President of the Academy. Awards, recognition and contributions *Sangeetha Kalanidhi: The Music Academy, since 1929 has been recognising and rewarding people who contributed to the field of Carnatic music by honouring them with the title Sangeetha Kalanidhi.

The label is in Portland, Oregon. History Chainsaw began life as a zine published by Donna Dresch in the late 1980s. Musicians and writers featured in the zine included Lois Maffeo, Jena von Br√ºcker, Juliana Lueking, Candice Pederson, G.B. Jones and Larrybob. Chainsaw was one of the seminal queercore zines that, along with J.D.s and Homocore, helped define the movement. \\"In 1991...Chainsaw developed from a zine into a record label. This began simply enough when she made a compilation cassette of her favourite bands and started to sell these while on tour with Fifth Column\\", writes Amy Spencer in DIY: The Rise of Lo-Fi Culture. In 1994 Chainsaw began to release LPs and singles, beginning with the release of The Fakes (featuring members of Bikini Kill, The Need and Nation of Ulysses ), the Frumpies and the first Team Dresch LP, Personal Best. This was followed by a co-release with Candy Ass Records, the double LP/CD compilation, Free to Fight. \\"The label established itself as a vital element of the queercore scene...\\" says Spencer, as Chainsaw then began to release records by a variety of queer mainly women artists. Of note is the fact that many bands, such as Sleater-Kinney, have been able to put out their initial recordings on the label. As well, the website for Chainsaw, and in particular its message board, have fostered a sense of community and provided a vehicle for expression by queers and music fans.

In Brazil, it refers to one of the four sub-regions of the Northeast Region of Brazil (similar to the specific association of \\"outback\\" with Australia in English). Its borders are not precise. it is a region that is well-known in Brazilian culture, with a rich history and much folklore. Including the famous book of Brazilian literature called Os Sert√µes written by the Brazilian author Euclides da Cunha Originally the term referred to the vast hinterlands of Asia and South America that Portuguese explorers encountered. In Brazil, it referred to backlands away from the Atlantic coastal regions where the Portuguese first settled in South America in the early sixteenth century. A Brazilian historian once referred to colonial life in Brazil as a \\"civilization of crabs\\", as most settlers clung to the shoreline, with few trying to make inroads into the sert√£o. In modern terms, \\"sert√£o\\" refers to a semi-arid region in northeastern Brazil, comprising parts of the states of Alagoas, Bahia, Pernambuco, Para√≠ba, Rio Grande do Norte, Cear√°, Maranh√£o, Piau√≠, Sergipe, and Minas Gerais. Geographically, the sert√£o consists mainly of low uplands that form part of the Brazilian Highlands. Most parts of the sert√£o are between and above sea level, with higher elevations found on the eastern edge in the Planalto da Borborema, where it merges into a sub-humid region known as agreste, in the Serra da Ibiapaba in western Cear√° and in the Serro do Periquito of central Pernambuco. In the north, the sert√£o extends to the northern coastal plains of Rio Grande do Norte state, while to the south it ends gradually in the northern part of Minas Gerais. Two major rivers cross the sert√£o, the Jaguaribe and further east the Piranhas, and the larger S√£o Francisco River is in part in the sert√£o. Smaller rivers dry up after the end of the rainy season. The term sert√£o is also used in Portuguese to refer to the Brazilian hinterland in general, regardless of region. It is this sense that corresponds to sert√£o music, m√∫sica sertaneja, roughly \\"country music\\". To avoid ambiguity, the region in the northeast is sometimes called the sert√£o nordestino, while the Brazilian hinterland may also be called the sertania, the land of sert√µes. Climate and vegetation Because the sert√£o lies just south of the equator, temperatures are nearly uniform throughout the year and are typically tropical, often extremely hot in the west. However, the sert√£o is distinctive in its low rainfall compared to other areas of Brazil. Because of the relatively cool temperatures in the South Atlantic Ocean, the intertropical convergence zone remains north of the region for most of the year, so that most of the year is very dry. Although annual rainfall averages between and over most of the sert√£o and on the northern coast at Fortaleza, it is confined to a short rainy season. This season extends from January to April in the west, but in the eastern sert√£o it generally occurs from March to June. However, rainfall is extremely erratic and in some years the rains are minimal, leading to catastrophic drought, while in others rains are extremely heavy and floods occur. This variability has caused extreme famines among subsistence farmers in the region, exacerbated by the extreme imbalance of land ownership throughout the sert√£o. The worst of these famines, between 1877 and 1879, was said to have killed over half the region's population. In its natural state, the sert√£o was covered by a distinctive scrubby caatinga vegetation, consisting generally of low thorny bushes adapted to the extreme climate. Several species of tree in the caatinga, such as the cashew, have become valuable horticultural plants. Most of the sert√£o vegetation is now substantially degraded as a result of centuries of cattle ranching or clearing for cotton farming. Parts of the sert√£o are recognized as a biodiversity hot- spot because of its unique flora.

Biography Nothing is known of Dan Michael except what can be gathered from his work and from the fact that Northgate is still the name of an area of the city of Canterbury in Kent, England. His only known work is a literal translation in the Kentish dialect of a French treatise entitled La Somme des Vices et des Vertus (also known as Le Miroir du monde or Le Livre des commandemens, &c.;), which was written in 1279 by Laurentius Gallus, a Dominican friar and confessor to Philip III of France. This work was translated into Flemish, Catalan, Spanish and Italian, and appears in no less than six English translations. Dan Michel's autograph manuscript is preserved in the British Library as Arundel MS 57, which states that the work was completed in the year 1340 on the eve of the apostles Simon and Jude by Dan Michel of Northgate, a brother of the cloister of St Augustine of Canterbury. The value of the book is chiefly philological as an authenticated and dated example of the southern dialect. The Ayenbite of Inwyt was edited for the Roxburghe Club by the Rev. Joseph Stevenson in 1855, and for the Early English Text Society by Richard Morris in 1876.

The chelae are large and powerful, and specially adapted to the crab's feeding behaviour, the crushing and eating of molluscs. Distribution and habitat Calappa hepatica is found in the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific region, its range extending from the Red Sea to Hawaii, French Polynesia, Cocos Island and northern Australia. Its typical habitat is on the sandy or shelly sand seabed, often in reef habitats, and seagrass meadows, at depths down to about . Ecology During the day, Calappa hepatica remains buried in sand with only the area round the eyes protruding. It emerges at night to hunt for prey, and can rebury itself in the substrate efficiently and fast if danger threatens. It is a predator, and largely feeds on bivalve and gastropod molluscs, as well as hermit crabs. It has a specially adapted right chela which it uses to break open the shell of its prey; for this purpose it has a large accessory tooth located at the base of the hinged part of the claw, which is located opposite a flat plate on the fixed part, the two working together like a vice. After breaking open the shell, it uses its left pincer, which is longer and more pointed than the right, to pick out the soft tissues.

The series was developed by Ryoichi Kimizuka and stars Y≈´ji Oda, Toshir≈ç Yanagiba, Eri Fukatsu, Chosuke Ikariya, Miki Mizuno, and Y≈´suke Santamaria. In 1998 and 1999, an English-subtitled version of the series was broadcast in the United States on the International Channel, under the title The Spirited Criminal Investigative Network. The series spawned three television films and a stage play, along with six theatrically released films that were produced following the end of the show. The first of the theatrical films, Bayside Shakedown, was released in 1998, and the sixth and final film, Bayside Shakedown The Final, was released in 2012. The first Bayside Shakedown film was a major box office hit in Japan, earning 10.1 billion yen (84 million U.S. dollars), and was the third highest grossing live-action film in Japanese box office history. The second film in the series, Bayside Shakedown 2, earned over $165 million at the box office, making it the highest-grossing live-action Japanese film on domestic screens. Story summary Bayside Shakedown takes place in the fictional Wangan Precinct of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. Unlike most police dramas which tend to focus on action and car chases, Bayside Shakedown is largely concerned with the bureaucratic issues of the police department that are very present in many other sectors of Japanese society. The series depicted police work as office politics under a slightly different environment, complete with bureaucratic red tape, lethargic civil servants, bosses more interested in playing golf and saving face than solving crimes, interference from politicians, and conflict between police headquarters and the local officers. The officers depicted in Bayside Shakedown are only permitted to carry firearms during major emergencies. Fuji TV used the fictional \\"All officers are to be armed\\" (Êã≥ÈäÉÊê∫Â∏ØÂëΩ‰ª§ Kenj≈´ Keitai Meirei) order, which the portrayed bureaucracy is often reluctant to hand down. (In reality, it is compulsory for a uniformed officer to be armed, and plainclothes officers are required to be armed if they expect to be exposed to any danger.) The main character of the series is a young detective named Shunsaku Aoshima (played by Y≈´ji Oda). Originally a corporate salesman, Aoshima decided to join the police department out of heroic idealism, expecting a life of adventure and excitement. Once inside, he is completely underwhelmed by the reality of police work, finding it dishearteningly similar to corporate employment. Throughout the series, he strives against the obstacles of bureaucratic indifference to help people and pursue his ideals of what a police officer should be, often with humorous results.

Dick was writing at the time of his death in 1982. He had already been paid an advance for the book by the publisher and was working against a deadline. After his death, his estate approached other writers about the possibility of someone completing the novel based on his notes, but that proved to be impossible, as he had never formally outlined the story. Dick viewed the novel as his Finnegans Wake. The idea was inspired partly by an entry in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica on Beethoven that referred to him as the most creative genius of all time, partly by traditional views of what constitutes the human heaven (visions of lights), and finally by the Faust story. However, Andrew M. Butler's alternative plot summaries seem to suggest that he might have become fascinated by Dante's Divine Comedy as a form of theophany. In his final completed work, The Transmigration of Timothy Archer, his narrator, Angel Archer, shows similar appreciation for Dante's masterpiece, which suggests that this argument may have some merit. Claims about possible content Nearly all that is known about one interpretation of the projected plot came from a discussion that Dick had with his journalist friend Gwen Lee on January 10, 1982, which Lee transcribed and later published. By contrast, Andrew M. Butler cites multiple sources for his own contentions about the possible plot, which are cited below. They include references within Greg Rickman's The Last Testament (1985), Lawrence Sutin's In Pursuit of VALIS (1991), and the interview collection What if Our World is Their Heaven? (2006), cited above. Both are shown to be correct in The Selected Letters of Philip K Dick Volume 6: 1980 -1982, where one can read Dick's own description of the story and what he wanted to do with it. The plot was to express what he believed was an evolutionary step in humanity, using an interpretation of Joachim de Fiore, where he believed that one age of humanity used the left side of the brain, another the right, and the future would combine the two leading to a greater understanding of what is real. Moreover, the use of Dante was to demonstrate how hell, purgatory and heaven can all be experiences of life, showing how the world is experienced according to the left, right and whole of the brain. Possible plot summaries The novel dealt with one Ed Firmley, a composer of scores for B-movie grade sci-fi films and a race of alien humanoids that had evolved without the development of sound as a basis of communication. The shamans of this alien race would on occasion have visions of Earth and its many sounds. Due to their unique evolution without sound the holy men were incapable of describing these experiences to the rest of their race. They just knew that the place they saw was their heaven. Meanwhile their race was modeled around sight and light, encompassing much more of the electromagnetic spectrum than the limited human vision. In fact, from their perspective, humans were capable of sight but nearly blind, such as a mole appears to a human. Their language involved the telepathic projection of color patterns in precise gradations and following mathematical formulas. A spaceship carrying members of this race arrives on Earth and they mug Ed Firmley, a famous composer they quickly discover, as a cover-up for plugging a bio-chip into his head. This bio-chip is a digitized form of one of the aliens with a link back to the ship ‚Äì essentially allowing everyone to experience Ed Firmley by proxy. The bio-chip is supposed to be passive, serving only as a means of relaying the mystic experience of sound to an entire race. Soon the alien presence in the bio-chip becomes bored of Firmley‚Äôs music, which is bland, schmaltzy schlock, and the pop music that he constantly listens to. As a consequence of this boredom, the bio-chip turns from being passive to active, controlling what Firmley listens to as well as feeding him mathematical formulas that he begins to use as the basis of his compositions. His career, from a financial perspective, dwindles, but he becomes a respected avant-garde artist. The active role the bio-chip takes in the relationship begins frying Firmley‚Äôs brain. At this point the aliens make themselves known and offer to remove the chip, but Firmley refuses. He sees himself as an artist whereas before, he was of no consequence, doing what he did simply for money. Firmley decides to give up his body to be transformed into a bio-chip which is in turn implanted into an alien brain. This will also lead to the eventual death of the alien host, but it offers Firmley a chance of experiencing their world of lights, our heaven. However, Andrew M. Butler offers several alternative summaries which contradict the Lee/Dick interview cited above. A god-like being, Ditheon, fuses the Torah and Jesus Christ into a single being and takes over an individual. A scientist travels through the events of Dante's Divine Comedy, and a Beethoven-like composer is writing a film score, while pursued by aliens. A scientist creates a theme park that is related to the events of his youth, whereupon a sentient artificial intelligence imprisons him within it, as a youth. He has to travel through Dantean realities (and artist, political activist and gay social networks in the Berkeley of the 1940s and 1950s) to return home and resume his life as an old man. Alternatively, Dante's Divine Comedy is a portal to alternate subjective realities that represent three ways of perceiving the world. \\"The owl in daylight\\" is a phrase Dick heard on television. It means \\"not to understand\\", or \\"to be blind\\". Tessa Dick version Dick's former wife Tessa wrote her own version of The Owl in Daylight, which was self- publishedhttps://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/16/philip-k-dick-widow- owl-daylight in January 2009. The novel uses little to none of the material that Philip K. Dick was working on at the time of his death, though it does bear many similarities. She remarked, \\"I attempted to express the spirit of Phil's proposed novel, without using his plot or the one character that he had created ... Phil had written very little about this novel ... It was very sketchy and did not even name any characters ... The Owl in Daylight is my concept of what Phil's novel should be.\\" At the request of the Philip K. Dick Estate, Mrs. Dick voluntarily removed her novel from publication, making copies rare and hard to come by. ReferencesSources  Category:Novels by Philip K.

The river basin spreads across . The Taku is a very productive salmon river and its drainage basin is primarily wilderness. During the 18th and early 19th centuries, the Taku Indians controlled the trade routes on the river and compelled natives of the Interior to use them as middle-men, instead of allowing trade directly with white settlers.Muir, J., Travels in Alaska (Houghton Mifflin Company, 1915) The Hudson's Bay Company established a trading post called Fort Durham, also known as Fort Taku, near the mouth of the Taku River in the early 1840s to take advantage of the natural trade route. However, by 1843, Fort Durham had been abandoned as unprofitable.\\"Background - Native Culture,\\" Historic Preservation Program, Juneau History, City and Borough of Juneau, Alaska (Juneau Public Libraries, 2003). Although a major river, the Taku's name does not extend to its headwaters. Its name begins at the confluence of the Inklin and Nakina Rivers, which is the location of the tiny community of Inklin. The Inklin's name also only extends upstream to the confluence of the Nahlin and Sheslay Rivers, which the Nakina's main tributaries are the Sloko and Silver Salmon Rivers. One account of its name is that \\"Taku\\" is the Tlingit language word for \\"salmon\\" but the Taku Tlingit name for themselves T'aaku Kw√°an translates as \\"Geese Flood Upriver Tribe\\"\\".Map of T'aaku kwaan territories There are also two kwaans of the Tlingit people inland in British Columbia, the √Åa Tlein Kw√°an (\\"Big Lake Tribe\\", today organized as the Taku River Tlingit First Nation) and the Deisleen Kw√°an (\\"Big Sinew Tribe\\", today organized as the Teslin Tlingit Council); the territory of the former includes those areas of the Taku basin in British Columbia. Tributaries In addition to the Inklin and Nakina Rivers, from which it is formed, other tributaries of the Taku proper include the Tulsequah River. Economic value The Taku River is an important contributor to the economies of Southeast Alaska and British Columbia, especially for its commercial, sport and personal-use fisheries. A detailed report released in 2004 by the McDowell Group The Taku River Economy: An Economic Profile of the Takue River Area notes $5.4 million in total U.S. commercial harvest and processing output, including 80 jobs and $1.4 million in labor income. British Columbia added over $750,000 more. Fishwheel on the Taku River, May 1908 Other activities, including commercial air, guided river excursions, hunting and property taxes added still more to the general regional economy. the report mentioned above estimated \\"the annual economic impact from all activities on the Taku River to be $26.7 million,\\" most of it, about $18 million, from commercial air activity directly related to tourism. The Taku is the Southeast Alaska's top salmon-producing river. Data from the Alaska Department of Fish & Game Taku River Salmon Stock Assessment notes that nearly 2 million wild salmon return to the river annually, including up to 100,000 Chinook salmon (king salmon), 350,000 sockeye salmon (red salmon) and 400,000 coho salmon (silver salmon), 50,000 chum salmon(dog salmon), and 1 million pink salmon (humpy salmon). Beyond its bounty of salmon, the Taku is home to eight other fish species, including steelhead, bull trout, Dolly Varden char, rainbow trout, lake trout, Arctic grayling, whitefish and Southeast Alaska's largest population of cutthroat trout. In addition, hooligans (eulachon), crab, shrimp and halibut are harvested at or near the river's mouth. That marine wealth supports major sport, commercial and tribal fisheries in Alaska and British Columbia. Flooding history Periodically, the Taku River reaches flood stage (43 ft) or above. Records of the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction ServiceAdvanced Hydrologic Prediction Service (AHPS), a branch of the National Weather Service, show that in the last two decades the river crested above six times. The highest level reached in that period was on June 25, 2004. As of Aug. 12, 2009, the highest registered level for 2009 occurred on July 24 when the river crested at . More information is available at the AHPS website. Also see * http://takuriver.com/takuriverfloods.htm The Taku River fills Tulsequah Lake during peak flow, causing lake outburst events most years. As the lake swells the water can float or melt the glacier enough to trigger sudden releases. Habitat protection efforts Past mining activity and the potential for future mining on the Canadian side of the border led the State of Alaska to take recent habitat protection steps. In January 2009, the Alaska Department of Natural Resources' Division of Coastal and Ocean Management approved a request from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to designated the entire U.S. portion of the Taku River as \\"important habitat,\\" a designation that put the stretch of river within the purview of protective provisions in Alaska law that require those applying for certain river use permits \\"avoid, minimize, or mitigate significant adverse impacts to the special productivity of the habitat.\\" In February, the director of the division rescinded the designation for a portion of the U.S. river below the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border.

In 1980, the entire river was designated \\"wild\\" and added to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The designation means that the Tinayguk is unpolluted, free-flowing and generally inaccessible except by trail and that its watershed is essentially primitive. The river's name means Moose in Inupiat. In 1930, forester Robert \\"Bob\\" Marshall recommended it as an alternative to West Fork, a local name that Marshall considered over-used. Boating Although whitewater enthusiasts sometimes run the river in small rafts or inflatable canoes or kayaks, it is remote, hazardous, and difficult to reach. It is a small one-channel river that drops over its first and an average of over the rest of its course. The upper reaches are rated Class III (difficult) on the International Scale of River Difficulty, while the rest of the river varies between Class II (medium) and Class III.

Managed by the Bureau of Land Management, the wild segment of the river is fished for king and silver salmon, Arctic grayling, and char. Other forms of recreation along the river include boating and camping in summer and snowmobiling, dog mushing, ice fishing, hunting, and trapping in winter. For part of its length, the Iditarod Trail runs along the Unalakleet. History The river's name is Inupiat for \\"place where the east wind blows.\\" Historically, the river provided a good connection between native coastal settlements and those in the interior along the Yukon River. The route, including what is called the Kaltag Portage, was the shortest connection between the Yukon and Norton Sound. Eskimos have lived near the Unalakleet for many centuries. House pits in the region date to 200 B.C. In the 1830s, after the Russian-American Company established trading posts at St. Michael and Unalakleet, Lieutenant Lavrenty Zagoskin of the Imperial Russian Navy filed the first non-native reports about the Unalakleet. In 1898, herders from Lapland settled along the river, where they established reindeer herds. Shortly thereafter, prospectors seeking gold on the nearby Seward Peninsula traveled over the Kaltag Portage and downriver to the coast. Subsequent changes included a telegraph line and associated cabins along the river and establishment of a mail route.

The label was run out of San Francisco and began as an extension of Matt Wobensmith's fanzine, Outpunk. Outpunk ran for seven issues, from 1992 till 1997, with contributions from queer punks such as Anonymous Boy, interviews with queercore bands and a split issue with Gary Fembot. He released two records in 1992, the 7\\" single compilations There's A Faggot In The Pit and There's A Dyke In The Pit. At this time there were few actual queercore bands in existence, so some of the artists that appeared were politically motivated punk bands that supported the queercore movement. There's A Dyke In The Pit features Bikini Kill, Lucy Stoners, 7 Year Bitch and the first song released by Tribe 8, stalwarts of the queercore scene. Outpunk's next compilation was the Outpunk Dance Party compilation LP/CD, which introduced many new queer bands to the public. Among them was Randy 'Biscuit' Turner of Big Boys new band Swine King, Pansy Division, Sister George, Sta-Prest and Mukilteo Fairies. After this, Outpunk began to release many singles and LPs by queercore artists from the US, Canada and UK. Wobensmith was also writing a column for Maximum RocknRoll zine, which extended the range of people being introduced to queer punk music while addressing issues such as homophobia in the punk community. In DIY: The Rise Of Lo-Fi Culture, Amy Spencer writes, \\"Matt Wobensmith...feels that a person's self-identification as gay shouldn't form the basis of their whole personality. 'Gay people often sacrifice the cultures they come from just to belong to something.' This sacrifice of a radical culture, whether as an artist, punk or anarchist, is what the queercore movement has always battled against.\\" Wobensmith ended the label in the late 90s, and began a new label called Queercorps, which was short-lived. He spoke about the reasons behind this in an interview included in the book We Owe You Nothing: Punk Planet, The Collected Interviews, edited by Daniel Sinker, originally appearing in Punk Planet zine. Subsequently he ran the label A.C.R.O.N.Y.M., which specialized in gay hip hop music acts. Outpunk records and CDs are much sought after by collectors, since most were produced in limited runs and are rare and hard to find. As of 2009, he runs the vintage zine store Gotebl√ºd in San Francisco.

He is best remembered for his decade long backing of Bobby Bland, although in his own right, Brown recorded over a dozen albums between 1967 and 2006. Career Brown was born in Jackson, Mississippi, United States, and was presented with his first guitar as a teenager while recovering from a bout of meningitis. By 1955, after performing backing duties for both Sonny Boy Williamson II and Jimmy Beasley, Brown had a two year long stint backing Johnny Otis. This led to work with Etta James, where he swapped his Gibson Les Paul for an ES-175 to give him a richer and fuller tone to his guitar work, that set him apart from his contemporaries. The stress of constant touring led him to Los Angeles, California, to resume work with Otis, spending an extended residency at the Club Sands. Further session duties saw Brown back Bobby Darin and Bill Cosby among others, as well as performing on T-Bone Walker's Funky Town. ABC Records producer Bob Thiele offered Brown the chance to record his own material, and Brown released Chicken Fat in 1967. One of his most celebrated tracks is the 11+ minute guitar solo, \\"Eighteen Pounds of Unclean Chitluns\\", which is on I'd Rather Suck My Thumb (1970), and was reissued as the lead track (and title) on a BluesWay Records collection released in 1973. For many years in the 1980s and 1990s, Brown was a prominent member of the house band at Antone's Night Club in Austin, Texas. Brown was nominated for a Juno Award in both 2001 and 2002.

About 50 people were killed. Background In 1997, Algeria was at the peak of a civil conflict that had begun after the military's cancellation of 1992 elections set to be won by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). Two major Islamist guerrilla groups, Armed Islamic Group (GIA) and AIS, and several minor ones, were fighting the government. Larbaa was a major center for the FIS's armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS), which the GIA had recently declared war on; Mustapha Kartali, a former GIA chief who had split from him in 1995 and become head of the AIS's Katibat Errahamane brigade, was based in the area. Massacre On the afternoon of 27 July 1997, the electricity went out. That night, a number of guerrillas armed with shotguns, knives, and sabres (30 according to The Economist, 100 according to Liberte) stormed into the area by night and started breaking into homes and cutting the residents' throats, killing men, women, and babies, and burning some victims alive. They also blew up their houses. About 50 people (most papers reported 47; Le Matin reported 58) were killed. The massacre was presumed to be the work of the GIA. According to Robert Moore of The Observer as quoted by Ahmed Bouzid in Zmag: \\"in the village of Larbaa the attack took place 300 yards from a large barracks.\\" The New York Times confirms that \\"the electricity had been cut in the town before the assault and the attack occurred close to an army barracks\\" (Roger Cohen, \\"Despite freeing of a militant, no letup in Algerian strife\\", The New York Times, 2 August 1997, as cited by Algeria-Watch).

It is a scent hound and is currently recognised by the Kennel Club as a Vulnerable Native Breed with around 600 animals worldwide.native dog breeds 'at risk of extinction', BBC News Ancestry The first recorded Otterhounds known to resemble the current breed are in the North-West of England in the first half of the 19th century ‚Äì for example, the Hawkstone Otter Hunt and Squire Lomax's Otterhounds. In the second half of the 19th century, French Griffons were outcrossed, including one-eighth Wolf cross/Griffon Vendeen from the Comte de Canteleu in Normandy.Lee, Rawdon B, 1893, History and Description of the Modern Dogs of Great Britain and Ireland, Sporting Division In the early 20th century the Griffon Nivernais was crossed into the breed, and one particular dog, Boatman, a Grand Griffon Vend√©en/Bloodhound cross, became an ancestor for several kennels.Cunliffe, J, 2003, Otterhound: Special Rare Breed Edition, Kennel Club Books Appearance The Otterhound is a large, rough-coated hound with an imposing head. Originally bred for hunting, it has great strength and a strong body with long striding steps. This makes it able to perform prolonged hard work. The Otterhound hunts its quarry both on land and in water and it has a combination of characteristics unique among hounds; most notably an oily, rough, double coat and substantial webbed feet. They have a nose that can track in the mud and water for over 72 hours Otterhounds generally weigh between . They have extremely sensitive noses which make them inquisitive and perseverant in investigating scents. Consequently, they need particular supervision when outdoors. They are friendly dogs with a unique bass voice which they use frequently. Hunting mink hunter with an otterhound Otter hunting dates back to the early medieval period, with references it is found as early as 1360. The otterhound, however, can only be traced back as a distinct breed as far as the early 1800s. The otter is one of the largest and most intelligent carnivorous mammals in Europe. To be equal to the otter, an Otterhound was said to need \\"a Bulldog's courage, a Newfoundland's strength in water, a Pointer's nose, a Retriever's sagacity, the stamina of a Foxhound, the patience of a Beagle, and the intelligence of a CollieLeighton, R, 1910, Dogs and All About Them, Cassel and Company Ltd, London\\". In 1978, due to the dramatic decline in otter numbers, the otter was placed on the list of protected species in Britain, and otter hunting therefore ceased. It was never banned in Britain, the otter hunts stopped hunting voluntarily, as it was they who realised that otter numbers were dropping dramatically and brought it to the attention of the authorities. By 1977, nine registered packs of otterhounds were still in existence. A few hunts switched to hunting mink or coypu, but many of the original otterhound packs ceased to exist altogether. Hounds were often passed to newly founded minkhound packs. The Pembroke and Carmarthenshire Minkhounds are the only pack today with a pure otterhound pack. As the dogs had been selectively bred for their hunting capabilities, only a few of the bloodlines were suitable for breeding into companion animals.  Health  The average lifespan of the breed is a little over 10 years. A quarter will live 12 to 15 years. At least one hound is known to have lived to be 16 years old. The Otterhound enjoys considerable exercise, but can also be a couch potato. They can be good family dogs but need to be kept in a secure property since they can jump fences up to 5 feet high, but rarely try. In spite of the small gene pool, the Otterhound is generally a healthy breed, but is subject to many of the same complaints as all large, rapidly growing dogs. Common problems that can occur are elbow and hip dysplasia, a malformation of the elbow and hip joints. These are not always painful, but can cause lameness and impair mobility, and result in arthritis. Badly affected hounds should not be bred from, but most Otterhounds have a poor hip and elbow score. The problem can be reduced by making sure that young Otterhounds do not jump down from high places, go up and down the stairs or walk too much on very hard surfaces while bones are still growing. This enables the muscles around the sockets to strengthen and develop, providing more support. Otterhounds have a predisposition to ear problems (as can any breed with this type of ear) and a predisposition to gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), due to their deep chest. Epilepsy and seizures are also known to affect the breed, and can be hereditary. There is ongoing research into the causes of epilepsy in Otterhounds. For reasons currently unknown, epilepsy in Otterhounds in the United States does not appear to be fatal, while epilepsy found Otterhounds from the United Kingdom is frequently untreatable, and is usually fatal. Endangered breed An Otterhound, published in 1859 Otterhound 1879 There are an estimated 599 otterhounds in the world. It is considered to be the most endangered native breed in Britain, with only 41 new registrations in 2016. This is partly because otterhounds have never been numerous, and even in the early 20th century, when otter hunting as a sport was at the height of its popularity, the number of dogs was still small. They are on the list of Vulnerable Native Breeds as identified by the UK Kennel Club, and great efforts are being made to save the breed.\\"The puppies rarer than giant pandas\\", The Daily Telegraph, 5 March 2007, page 9 References=Bibliography * * External links * Category:FCI breeds Category:Scent hounds Category:Rare dog breeds Category:Dog breeds originating in England Category:Companion dogs Category:Vulnerable Native Breeds Category:Hunting with hounds ","title":"Otterhound"},{"id":"1512549","text":"Henry Khunrath Pancoast (February 26, 1875 ‚Äì May 20, 1939) was an American radiologist after whom a type of lung tumor is named (Pancoast tumor).

In the 1990s, and definitively in 2010, BS 8110 was superseded by EN 1992 (Eurocode 2), which is more accurate, economical and adequate to structural design and construction although parts of the standard have been retained in the National Annex of the Eurocode. 08110 Category:Reinforced concrete Category:Structural engineering standards ","title":"BS 8110"},{"id":"1512570","title":"List of carcinologists"},{"id":"1512585","text":"James City Shire was formed in the British colony of Virginia in 1634. During the 17th century, shortly after establishment of Jamestown in 1607, English settlers explored and began settling the areas adjacent to Hampton Roads. On, November 18, 1618, the Virginia Company of London, proprietor of the colony, gave instructions on the formation of a laudable government for the Colony to Sir George Yeardley when he departed from London to become full governor of Virginia. As directed, in 1619, Governor Yeardly established four large corporations, termed citties (sic), which were designated to encompass the developed portion of the colony. These were Kecoughtan (later renamed Elizabeth Cittie), James Cittie, Charles Cittie, and Henrico Cittie. In 1634, by order of Charles I, King of England, eight shires or counties with a total population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants were established in the colony of Virginia. The area included what is now Surry County (across the James River), part of Charles City County and some of New Kent County. James City Shire, as well as the James River and Jamestown took their name from King James I, the late father of the king. About 1642-43, the name of the James City Shire was changed to James City County. It is considered one of the 5 original shires of the Virginia colony to be extant essentially in the same political form (county) in 2005. Williamsburg became an independent city from James City County in 1884. However they share a school system, courts, and some constitutional officers.

The cast included James Hampton, Christopher Connelly and Slim Pickens. It was written by William Bickley, Joe Camp, and Michael Warren, directed by Joe Camp, and produced by Mulberry Square Productions. Plot Howard Clemmons tells his grandchildren about his adventures as a young U.S. Cavalry Lieutenant in 1854. Clemmons had no seniority, power or talent for the army and was therefore chosen to lead an experimental project using camels as cavalry mounts in the southwest U.S. Clemmons remembers arriving at Fort Val Verde, Texas, where Sgt. Uriah Tibbs, is expecting Arabian horses. When Tibbs explains that he and his men competed for the privilege of being in the project, Clemmons declines to tell him the ‚ÄúArabians‚Äù are actually camels. Clemmons then reports to the fort's commander, Col. Seymour Hawkins, who is more interested in his cannon practice than Clemmons's camel project. Later, Clemmons inspects the troops, including Nathaniel R. Higgins, who informs Clemmons that he re-enlisted so he could ride an Arabian horse. Although Clemmons wants to tell the men the truth, he is interrupted when a cook throws dishwater out the door and soaks him. When Clemmons and Tibbs later discuss the project at the saloon, they are accosted by Sgt. Naman Tucker, who is outraged his troopers did not receive the Arabian horses. A drunken Clemmons slides under the table as the two sergeants fight. The next day, the camels arrive, but the troops ride their horses back to the fort in disgust, leaving Clemmons to deal with the camels. Hi Jolly, an Arab camel trainer, reports to Clemmons and as they herd camels through town, horses stampede in fright, ladies scream and dogs bark in fear. A wagon overturns, and a barrel splits open covering Col. Hawkins's daughter, Jennifer, in molasses. Hawkins berates Clemmons for the damage and plans to cancel the project, but Clemmons declares that the orders came from Jefferson Davis, the Secretary of War. That night, Jennifer sneaks into Clemmons's room, pours a small crock of molasses over his head, and declares them even before inviting him to afternoon tea. The next day, Hi Jolly gives his first lesson in camel care as Tucker rides up and insults Tibbs's men. Clemmons warns Tucker that if he insults the camel corps again, Clemmons will put him on report and transfer him into the camel project. To the cheers of Tibbs's men, Tucker apologizes and rides away. As Hi Jolly congratulates his comrade on raising the men's morale, Clemmons faints. Over time, the soldiers continue their camel training, but the lessons do not go well. When the men finally learn to mount the camels, the animals run wild, dumping them in the dirt and water troughs. That night, the men bet Tucker he cannot lasso a camel. When Tucker lands the rope around the camel's neck, the beast runs in panic, dragging Tucker behind. The next morning, the camel returns, still dragging Tucker, bleeding and bruised. As weeks pass, the men become proficient with their camels and Clemmons romances Jennifer. He is ordered to capture a Native American renegade and Clemmons and his men pursue the outlaws, but they are thrown off their camels at a river. Later, Hi Jolly explains that camels are afraid of water; if Clemmons had dismounted and demonstrated the water was shallow, the camels would have crossed. That night, Jennifer takes a stroll with Clemmons, who tells her Col. Hawkins is cancelling the camel project. When Clemmons whines that he is a failure, Jennifer scolds him for being too cowardly to fight for his career. The next morning, Clemmons proposes a 300-mile race to the town of Dos Rios between his camels and Tucker's horses. When Hawkins declines, Clemmons deceitfully claims that the camel experiment is the President's pet project. Sometime later, Hi Jolly is injured in a barroom brawl and cannot ride. Before the race, Jennifer gives Clemmons a thick book on camels and kisses him. Col. Hawkins fires a cannon and the race is on. Tucker's horses outpace Clemmons's camels, but within a few days, Clemmons's men catch up. However, Clemmons learns from Corporal Leroy that Tucker and his men are captured by an outlaw named Bad Jack Cutter at Dagger's Point. Clemmons insists on rescuing Tucker and his men. Along the way, Clemmons and Tibbs capture two other outlaws, steal their clothes and horses, then ride into town in disguise to meet Bad Jack, agreeing to join his gang. Later, they find Tucker and his men in jail and try to pull out the window bars using a horse. When the horse fails, a camel demolishes the entire jail. Tucker and his men run, leaving Tibbs and Clemmons to face the outlaws alone. A gunfight ensues but Clemmons's men ride in on camelback, rescuing their leaders, and ride off before the outlaws can get to their horses. That night, Clemmons discovers they have lost the camel carrying all but one of their water barrels. Although Clemmons believes they can find water in the mountains, Tibbs insists they follow the map to the next waterhole. After two days of riding, they discover the hole is dry, and they are out of water. Tibbs wants to ride back to a river, but Clemmons convinces Tibbs to let him try to reach the mountains, ordering Tibbs to head to the river if he does not return by sunset. Clemmons finds water, but as he ties the barrel onto his camel, a shot rings out. Black Jack exchanges gunfire with Clemmons as the camel runs away. After sundown, the camel reaches Tibbs and his men. The men drink their fill, then realize Clemmons is missing. The next morning, Black Jack realizes Clemmons is out of ammunition. He climbs down the rocks and shoots Clemmons in the chest but as he celebrates, Tibbs and the men capture him. Much to Tibbs's surprise, Clemmons is saved by the book Jennifer gave him; it was inside his jacket and stopped Bad Jack's bullet. Later, Clemmons's troop races past Tucker and his men's exhausted horses outside Dos Rios. As Clemmons celebrates his victory, a telegram arrives from Washington, D.C., reporting that Congress has approved construction of the transcontinental railroad and the camel project is therefore unnecessary. Clemmons is ordered to turn the camels loose, but Tibbs and the men protest, concerned that the camels will perish in the American desert. As Clemmons finishes telling the story to his grandchildren, his wife, Jennifer, announces that dinner is ready. Clemmons goes outside to ring the dinner triangle, but Hi Jolly, Higgins and Tibbs report that one of the camels is in labor. As the four old men walk to the barn, Higgins wonders if they could move the camels closer to the house because he is tired that ‚Äúeach day he must walk a mile for a camel.‚Äù Cast * James Hampton as Lieutenant Howard Clemmons * Christopher Connelly as Sergeant Uriah Tibbs * Slim Pickens as Sergeant Naman Tucker * Denver Pyle as Colonel Seymour Hawkins * Gino Conforti as Hi Jolly * Mimi Maynard as Jennifer Hawkins * Jack Elam as Bad Jack Cutter * Lee de Broux as Fitzgerald * Herb Vigran as Smitty * Jesse Davis as Mariachi Singer * Frank Inn as Cook * Larry Swartz as Corporal LeRoy * Mike Travis as Arthur Logan * Tiny Wells as Nathaniel R.

(2000) The Santa Fe Convention of the Open Archives Initiativ . D-lib Magazine, 6(2).Tansley, Robert & Harnad, Stevan (2000) Eprints.org Software for Creating Institutional and Individual Open Archives. D-lib Magazine, 6(10)Harnad, S. (2005) The Implementation of the Berlin Declaration on Open Access . D-lib Magazine, 11(3).Crow, R. (2006) The Case for Institutional Repositories: A SPARC Position Paper . Discussion Paper. Scholarly Publication and Academic Resources Coalition, Washington, D.C. An institutional repository can be viewed as \\"a set of services that a university offers to members of its community for the management and dissemination of digital materials created by the institution and its community members.\\" For a university, this includes materials such as monographs, eprints of academic journal articles‚Äîboth before (preprints) and after (postprints) undergoing peer review‚Äîas well as electronic theses and dissertations. An institutional repository might also include other digital assets generated by academics, such as datasets, administrative documents, course notes, learning objects, or conference proceedings. Deposit of material in an institutional repository is sometimes mandated by that institution. Some of the main objectives for having an institutional repository are to provide open access to institutional research output by self-archiving in an open access repository, to create global visibility for an institution's scholarly research, and to store and preserve other institutional digital assets, including unpublished or otherwise easily lost (\\"grey\\") literature such as theses, working papers or technical reports. Origins Digital institutional repositories are document servers enabling researchers to archive their research output. Worldwide institutions are starting to implement digital institutional repositories for digital formats of research. Scholarly output can be born-digital, in which no digitalisation is necessary before the research is included in a digital repository. A digital institutional repository accessible through the Internet can improve the visibility, usage and impact of research conducted at an institution. The origin of the notion of an institutional repository are twofold: * Institutional repositories are partly linked to the notion of digital interoperability, which is in turn linked to the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) and its Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI- PMH). The OAI in turn had its roots in the notion of a \\"Universal Preprint Service\\", since superseded by the open access movement. * Institutional repositories are partly linked to the notion of a digital library‚Äîi.e., collecting, housing, classifying, cataloguing, curating, preserving, and providing access to digital content‚Äîanalogous with the library's conventional function of collecting, housing classifying, curating, preserving and providing access to analog content. In 2003 the function of an institutional repository was coined by Clifford Lynch in relation to universities. He argued that: > \\"... a university-based institutional repository is a set of services that a > university offers to the members of its community for the management and > dissemination of digital materials created by the institution and its > community members. It is most essentially an organizational commitment to > the stewardship of these digital materials, including long-term preservation > where appropriate, as well as organization and access or distribution.\\" Besides archiving research output institutional repositories can perform the functions such as knowledge management, research assessment and showcasing an institution's research output. The content of an institutional repository depends on the focus of the institution. Higher education institutions conduct research across multiple disciplines, thus research from a variety of academic subjects. Examples of such digital institutional repositories include the MIT Institutional Repository. A disciplinary repository is subject specific. It holds and provides access to scholarly research in a particular discipline. While there can be disciplinary repositories for one institution, disciplinary repositories are frequently not tied to a specific institution. The PsyDok digital repository for example holds German language research in psychology. SSOAR is an international social science full text-server. Open access repositories :See also: Open access by country Institutional repositories that provide access to research to users outside the institutional community are one of the recommended ways to achieve the open access vision described in the Budapest Open Access Initiative definition of open access. This is sometimes referred to as the self-archiving or \\"green\\" route to open access. Developing an institutional repository An institutional repository has been understood as a means to ensure that the published work of scholars is available to the academic community even after increases in subscription fees or budget cuts within libraries. The majority of research scholars do not provide free access to their research output to their colleagues in an organization. Institutional repositories provide scholars with a common platform so that everyone in the institution can contribute scholarly material to promote cross-campus interdisciplinary research. The development of an institutional repository redefines the production and dissemination of scholarly material within an academic community. The contents available on the institute‚Äôs website usually are removed after a few weeks. An institutional repository can provide a platform to manage institutional information, including web content. Institutional repositories have a number of benefits, including access to resources, visibility of research, and presentations of the contents.Bhardwaj, Raj Kumar. \\"Institutional Repository Literature: A Bibliometric Analysis.\\" Science & Technology Libraries ahead-of-print (2014): 1-18 If an institution has decided to invest in a repository numerous resources exist to help librarians and other repository managers frame and answer such questions, including \\"A Librarian's Process for Building an Institutional Repository\\",Stezano, Leo (March 2016). A Librarian‚Äôs Process for Building an Institutional Repository. Elsevier Library Connect https://libraryconnect.elsevier.com/sites/default/files/ELS-LC_IR_process.pdf Software The major institutional repository software platforms use a common open standard called OAI-PMH. This standard makes it not just possible to collect and move research output from one platform to another. While a majority of the institutions run institutional repository software on local servers, among new adopters, there is a strong preference towards cloud-based services. A survey commissioned by Duraspace found that 72% of respondents indicated that their institutional repository is a hosted service. Institutions are choosing cloud-based solutions because such providers \\"enable institutions to easily get started with a hosted software service, with no need to provision local hardware, software, staff, or other infrastructure nor is there any specific technical skill or expertise required\\". Also important to the decision to go hosted may be the understanding that a hosted institutional repository solution \\"frees a library from both hardware and software support, allowing staff resources to be directed to other publishing service functions such as consulting and workflow design.\\" Aggregators The Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR) states in its manifesto that \\"Each individual repository is of limited value for research: the real power of Open Access lies in the possibility of connecting and tying together repositories, which is why we need interoperability. In order to create a seamless layer of content through connected repositories from around the world, open access relies on interoperability, the ability for systems to communicate with each other and pass information back and forth in a usable format. Interoperability allows us to exploit today's computational power so that we can aggregate, data mine, create new tools and services, and generate new knowledge from repository content.\\" Interoperability is achieved in the world of institutional repositories using protocols to which repositories should conform, such as OAI-PMH. This allows search engines and open access aggregators, such as BASE, CORE and Unpaywall, to index repository metadata and content and provide value-added services on top of this content. The Digital Commons Network aggregates by discipline some 500 institutional repositories running on the Bepress Digital Commons platform. It includes more that two million full-text objects.

Some fast food chains, such as this Rally's located near New Orleans, LA, have two drive-throughs. mailboxes in USA. A drive-through or drive-thru (a sensational spelling of the word through), is a type of take-out service provided by a business that allows customers to purchase products without leaving their cars. The format was pioneered in the United States in the 1930s by Jordan Martin,Robert J. Sickels (ed), The 1940s, Greenwood Press, 2004, p. 107. but has since spread to other countries. The first recorded use of a bank using a drive-up window teller was the Grand National Bank of St. Louis, Missouri in 1930. The drive-up teller allowed only deposits at that time. Orders are generally placed using a microphone and picked up in person at the window. A drive-through is different from a drive-in in several ways - the cars create a line and move in one direction in drive-throughs, and normally do not park, whereas drive-ins allow cars to park next to each other, the food is generally brought to the window by a server, called a carhop, and the customer can remain in the parked car to eat. However, during peak periods, to keep the queue down and avoid traffic flow problems, drive-throughs occasionally switch to an \\"order at the window, then park in a designated space\\" model where the customer will receive their food from an attendant when it is ready to be served. This results in a perceived relationship between the two service models. Drive-throughs have generally replaced drive-ins in popular culture, and are now found in the vast majority of modern American fast-food chains. Sometimes, a store with a drive- through is referred to as a \\"drive-through\\", or the term is attached to the service, such as, \\"drive-through restaurant\\". or \\"drive-through bank\\". Drive- throughs typically have signs over the drive-through lanes to show customers which lanes are open for business. The types of signage used is usually illuminated so the \\"open\\" message can be changed to a \\"closed\\" message when the lane is not available. Drive-through restaurants A typical Australian McDonald's drive-through with speaker. The intercom and menus at a British McDonald's restaurant. Edinburgh, Scotland. A drive-through restaurant generally consists of: *A speaker and microphone for customers to place their orders *A speaker and microphone or wireless headset system for employees to hear the customer's order (when a speaker is used) *A trigger pad beneath the concrete to activate the microphone and headset, possibly augmented with a CCTV camera *One or more free-standing signs listing the menu items, called a menu board *Newer drive-throughs feature a LCD or LED display within the speaker system in order to show the full order and total cost to avert order errors through miscommunication. At many brands of restaurants, a secondary display featuring the total is placed directly next to the order window. This is to ensure that the customer will know if the cashier intentionally overcharges them. *Windows where employees interact with customers by processing the customer's payment and giving them their order. Most drive- throughs have either one window serving both functions, or two windows with the first being used for payment and the second used for retrieving the order. *Most restaurants have marked parking spaces just beyond the last window. If there is a significant delay in an individual customer's order (e.g. a special order), an employee may direct that customer to park in this area, clearing the drive-through lane for the next customer and preventing knock-on delays to other customers. When the order is ready, an employee hand-delivers the order to the customer. This service therefore occasionally has some similarities to drive-in service, but only during peak periods. Some businesses are built only for drive-through service, like this espresso shop. A drive-through only Tim Hortons location in Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada Drive-through designs are different from restaurant to restaurant; however, most drive-throughs can accommodate four to six passenger cars or trucks at once (called the queue). Most drive-through lanes are designed so the service windows and speaker are on the driver's side of the car, for example, in left-hand traffic (right-hand drive) countries such as the UK, Ireland, Australia, India and New Zealand, the windows will be on the right side of the drive-through lane, and vice versa in right-hand traffic (left-hand drive) countries such as North America and mainland Europe. There are a few drive-through lanes designed with the service windows on the passenger side, but these lanes are disfavored as they cannot be used easily by cars with only a driver. History In 1921, Kirby's Pig Stand introduced the drive-in restaurant, in which carhops delivered meals. In 1931, a California Pig Stand franchise introduced a drive- through service that bypassed the carhops. By the 1970s, drive-through service had replaced drive-in restaurants in the United States. The first McDonald's drive-through was created in 1975 in Sierra Vista, Arizona, near Fort Huachuca, a military installation, to serve military members who were not permitted to get out of their cars off-post while wearing fatigues. The original McDonald's was closed down and demolished in May 1999 and a new McDonald's replaced it. In 1981, Max Hamburgers opened Northern Europe's first drive-in in Pite√•. The first drive-through restaurant in Europe, a McDonald's drive-through, opened at the Nutgrove Shopping Centre in Dublin, Ireland in 1985. In the US, drive-throughs account for 70 percent of McDonald's business and the average drive through order is fulfilled in under three and one half minutes. Outside of the US, McDonald's drive-throughs are variously known as \\"McAuto\\", \\"McDrive\\" and \\"AutoMac\\". In 2010, the Casa Linda, Texas, franchise of McDonald's opened a drive-through/walk-up only store with no indoor seating although it has a small patio with tables. In McDonald's in the UK, all McDonald's are going under an EOTF transformation (Experience of the Future), where all McDonald's with Drive-Thru's will have a third window. This would be where at the second window, the presenter would tell customers to pull up to the third window (if they've got a larger order and have longer to wait), this is known as the \\"fast forward window\\". This reduces waiting times for customers. Drive-through banking BNB in Bolivia, an example of drive- through banking A drive-through shared by a bank and a coffee shop. In 1928, City Center Bank, which became UMB Financial Corporation, president R. Crosby Kemper opened what is considered the first drive-up window. Shortly after the Grand National Bank in St Louis opened up a drive-through, including a slot to the side for night time deposits. Westminster Bank opened the UK's first drive-through bank in Liverpool in 1959, soon followed by Ulster Bank opening Ireland's first in 1961 at Finaghy. In recent years, there has been a decline in drive-through banking due to increased traffic congestion and the increased availability of automated teller machines and telephone and internet banking. However, many bank buildings now feature drive-through ATMs. Drive-through grocery shopping Harold Willis and his father, Robert Willis, first incorporated a dairy and eggs drive through service in Redlands, California, in the early 1940s, supplying milk and eggs quickly and efficiently to driving customers; this utilized a dairy conveyor belt that Harold Willis had invented. Some supermarkets offer drive-through facilities for grocery shopping. In the UK, this service was first announced by Tesco in August 2010. In the United States, Crafty's Drive-Buy Grocery Store in Virginia started offering the service. In 2012, the Dutch chain Albert Heijn introduced a \\"Pick Up Point\\" where one can collect groceries bought online. Other examples McDonald's first two-lane drive-through was at the Rock N Roll McDonald's in Chicago. *Alcoholic beverages at a drive-through liquor store (called a \\"Beer Through\\", a \\"Cruise Through\\", a \\"Brew Thru\\" in the U.S. eastern Mid-Atlantic coast, or a \\"Pony Keg\\" in certain areas; generally illegal in the Northeast and West) * Postal services at a drive-through mailbox *Coffee at a drive- through coffee shop *Dairy products at a drive-through dairy store (notably the Skinner Dairy shops of North-East Florida or Dairy Barn in Long Island) *Prescriptions at a drive-through pharmacy *Marriage (primarily at special drive-through marriage chapels in Las Vegas in the United States) *Funeral home where mourners can drive by, view and make offerings to the remains of their loved ones through windows. *Pennsylvania State Representative Kevin P.

Non-car usage=Pedestrian Pedestrians sometimes attempt to walk through the drive-through to order food after the seated section of a fast-food restaurant has closed. Many establishments refuse drive-through service to pedestrians for safety, insurance, and liability reasons.See Chude v. Jack in the Box, 185 Cal. App. 4th 37 (2010). In this case, Jack in the Box successfully invoked the California Personal Responsibility Act of 1996 against an uninsured driver who spilled hot coffee on herself in the drive-through, then suffered second- degree burns because the wall of the restaurant prevented her from opening her car door and escaping the hot coffee on her car seat. Under the Act, plaintiff's lack of vehicle insurance barred her from recovering noneconomic damages, which form the bulk of damages in many U.S. personal injury cases. The Court of Appeal reasoned that the burn injury was reasonably related to the operation of a motor vehicle because Jack in the Box, in accordance with its strict policy, would not have served her if she had approached the drive- through window on foot; and because her injuries were exacerbated by the fact she was sitting in a car. Cyclists are usually refused service with the same justification given. However, in the summer of 2009, Burgerville gave use of the drive-through window to bicyclists. Similar issues can arise in rural areas for people on horseback or in a horse-drawn carriage.https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-13548984 On 20 July 2013, a woman was fined for taking her horse inside a McDonald's restaurant in Greater Manchester, United Kingdom after being refused service at the drive- through. The horse ended up defecating inside the restaurant which caused distress to other customers. In May 2016, Scott McGee filed a United States federal class action lawsuit pursuing action against McDonald's due to the company being unwilling to serve people who are visually impaired when only the drive thru lane is open. , the matter is still in litigation. On May 24, 2018, a law came into effect in Portland Oregon requiring multi-modal access to drive-throughs. The new zoning law states, \\"When a drive-through facility is open and other pedestrian-oriented customer entrances to the business are unavailable or locked, the drive-through facility must serve customers using modes other than a vehicle such as pedestrians and bicyclists.\\" Walk-up windows McDonald's walk-up window (left) at a location in New York City Some establishments provide a walk-up window instead when a drive-through may not be practical. However, the walk-up windows should not be confused with small establishments that customers are lined up for services such as mobile kitchens, kiosks or concession stands. These walk-up windows are value-added services on top of the full services provided inside the stores. The walk-up windows generally provide similar customer experience with the drive-throughs by allowing customers to receive services from the exterior of the facilities through a window. There are many reasons for the owners to provide such services. An example is when McDonald's entered a new market in Russia where the majority of families did not own cars, the owners developed the walk-up windows as an alternative. Another reason is to have a drive-through experience in the locations that are not feasible to construct a drive-through lane such as in city centers. Some establishments may want to use walk-up windows to attract certain customer demographics such as younger customers who need quick service during late night. Another reason is to offer extended service hours and maintain a safe environment for employees, such as a bulletproof walk-up window in high-crime areas. Ski-through McDonald's first opened a ski-through called McSki in the ski resort of Lindvallen, Sweden in 1996.

He later had a highly successful term as the coach of the Australian team. He is also known as Bobby or Simmo. Simpson played as a right-handed batsman and semi-regular leg spin bowler. After ten years in retirement, he returned to the spotlight at age 41 to captain Australia during the era of World Series Cricket. In 1986 he was appointed coach of the Australian team, a position he held until being replaced by Geoff Marsh in July 1996. Under Simpson's tutelage, the team went from a struggling team, losing a succession of Test series, to the strongest team in world cricket. Some of the team's greatest achievements in his time as coach were winning the 1987 World Cup, regaining The Ashes in England in 1989, and overcoming the previously dominant West Indies on their home grounds in 1995. He also coached county cricket in England, with Leicestershire and Lancashire.  Early years  Born to Scottish immigrants from Falkirk, Simpson grew up in the inner-western Sydney suburb of Marrickville. His father Jock was a printer and played soccer for Stenhousemuir in the Scottish League,Haigh, p. 190. his grandfather Harry played briefly for Stoke, and the 1910s England international player Jock Simpson was also a relative.Falkirk FC - 100 Club - John Simpson, Falkirk Football Historian, 29 November 2010 Simpson was encouraged as a schoolboy by his two elder brothers Bill and Jack, who played in first division Sydney Grade Cricket for many years. He began his own career as a fast bowler and batsman who played in any position. He showed early leadership skills, captaining Marrickville West Primary School and later Tempe Intermediate High School. He captained 14-year-olds at the age of 12.Robinson, p. 265. In his early years, Simpson was also a talented golfer, baseballer and soccer player, and was known for being a confident and tenacious competitor. He raised money to buy his first set of golf clubs by collecting lost balls from Marrickville Golf Course and selling them second hand. Even at a young age, Simpson was known as an unrelenting competitor. He appealed loudly against brother Jack for leg before wicket (lbw) in a club match in spite of a loud edge; the umpire did not hear the favour and upheld the appeal. In a match in 1956, Simpson appealed for lbw against John Shaw after he had been hit in the head by a low bouncer from Pat Crawford, whereas his teammates were busy coming to the aid of the injured batsman. Simpson said \\"I was a naturally ambitious person anyway and never had any doubts I could go further. It sounds cocky but I always believed in my own talents.\\" At 12, he was selected for New South Wales in the Under-14 Competition. He switched to leg spin at the age of thirteen, and a week after turning 15 he was playing for Petersham's First XI in Sydney Grade Cricket after hitting string of centuries in the under-16 competition.Cricinfo Simpson had his first taste of first-class cricket as a slips fieldsman, having previously fielded on the boundary. Coming on as 12th man, Keith Miller casually pointed him to the slips, which in that era was against convention, as substitutes were expected to not field in close catching positions. He took two diving catches to establish his position in the cordon. First-class debut He was still 11 days shy of his seventeenth birthday when he was selected to make his Sheffield Shield debut as a middle order batsman for New South Wales against Victoria in the 1952‚Äì53 season. He had played only 12 first grade matches prior to this. When he arrived to meet his teammates, Australian vice-captain Arthur Morris asked him where his nappies were.Haigh, p. 191. At the age of 16 years and 354 days,Haigh, p. 28. this made him the second youngest cricketer to be capped for New South Wales, just three months older than teammate Ian Craig when he made his debut. He scored 44 and 8, without being dismissed in either innings. According to Haigh, \\"Great protectiveness was felt towards such a boy among men.\\" From the last ball of a drawn match, Simpson attempted to run two, but his misjudgment saw him caught short by half the pitch. Nevertheless, umpire Hugh McKinnon turned down the appeal, and after Victorian captain Sam Loxton reacted angrily, the arbiter said \\"it's the last ball of the game and his first match\\". Simpson took his maiden wicket during the match, catching Test player Ian Johnson from his own bowling. Simpson then scored 69 in the next match against South Australia, his only other innings and match for the season. The 1953‚Äì54 season was a purely domestic one, with no international team touring. New South Wales were the strongest state at the time with many Test players and won the first of nine consecutive Sheffield Shield titles, and Simpson found it difficult to break into the team at full strength. He played two matches at the start of the season, and two more at the end of the summer; New South Wales won all of these fixtures except the first, which was drawn. Simpson had few opportunities with the bat because of the strong batting line-up; he was only required to bat six times and his two highest innings of 58 and 42 were ended when New South Wales reached their target, leaving him unbeaten. He ended with 147 runs at 36.75, and had more success with the ball, taking 14 wickets at 27.85. Simpson's bowling was prominent in the last two matches; he took 5/37 in the second innings against Western Australia, bowling four of his victims, and then took 4/38 and 2/83 against South Australia as New South Wales won both matches. The following season in 1954‚Äì55, Simpson had more chances in the New South Wales middle order as the Test players were often playing for Australia against the touring English cricket team. However, he failed to make the use of this, scoring only 123 runs in the first seven innings and was in and out of the team. He then struck form against Victoria, scoring 104 of New South Wales' 234. This was pivotal in a low-scoring match as Victoria made only 86 and 158 and helped New South Wales to a nine-wicket win. Simpson's final match of the season was against the Englishmen. He made six in the first innings as both teams made 172. In the second innings, Simpson reached 98, when light drizzle began to fall and English captain Len Hutton decided to engage in mind games by ordering his men to leave the ground even though the umpires had not adjourned the match. When the visitors returned to the field, Simpson feared another rain delay would stop him reaching his century, so he charged English spinner Johnny Wardle and was stumped. Nevertheless, he helped his state to inflict a rare defeat on Hutton's men; they had won the Tests convincingly 3‚Äì1 and had otherwise not been beaten on the tour. The end-of-season run-scoring pushed Simpson's tally for the season to 331 at 33.10; he bowled only in the first two matches of the summer, totalling 1/58. At the start of the 1955‚Äì56, Simpson was hit in the nose by a bouncer, forcing him to have two operations.Robinson, p. 266. However, he missed only one Shield match against Victoria and played in the remainder of New South Wales' matches, despite the presence of the Test players for the full season, which was purely domestic. Simpson failed to make the most of his opportunities with the bat; in 11 completed innings, he reached 20 on nine occasions, but failed to convert the starts into big scores. His best scores was 79 and 57, and he was dismissed between 20 and 43 seven times. He ended the season with 406 runs at 36.90, and had little success with the ball, taking two wickets at 97.50 at the expensive economy rate of 5.73. Simpson was overlooked for selection for the 1956 tour of England, much to the surprise of English skipper Peter May. Australia lost its third consecutive Ashes tour and in doing so suffered two successive innings defeats, something that it had not suffered for 68 years. Simpson was under pressure to hold his place in the team, so he moved to Western Australia at the end of the 1955‚Äì56 season. At the age of 20, he changed professions from accounting with the Sydney Water Board to journalism, having been given a newspaper editorial post with the Daily News in Perth.Perry, p. 236. During the time, he lived in the house of Fremantle Cricket Club President Bob Ballantine.  Early international career  Simpson sweeps in the nets. After the 1956 Ashes series, captain Ian Johnson and vice-captain Keith Miller both retired, creating more openings in a struggling national team.Harte, pp. 450‚Äì452. After a slow start for his adopted state, Simpson hit form in December, registering a sequence of 75, 97, 26, 96 and 112 not out, the latter two scores coming in a match against Queensland. Towards the end of the season, Simpson was selected for Lindwall's XI for a match against Harvey's XI. These matches were typically used as a selection trial for the 22 strongest players in the country. Simpson failed to make significant impact, scoring 35 and 10, and he ended the season with 572 runs at 47.66. He had another ineffective summer with the ball, taking two wickets at 95.50. Simpson was one of many young players‚Äîeight of whom were uncapped‚Äîselected in an Australian side which toured New Zealand under Ian Craig in 1956‚Äì57. Australia was in a rebuilding phase and Test selection was at stake.Haigh, p. 104. He scored 263 runs at 43.83 in the first-class matches, including two half- centuries. Simpson played in all three matches against New Zealand, and scored 47, 67, 26 not out, a duck and 8 not out. His 67 was the top-score in the first innings of the second representative match. In the following season, Simpson was selected for the Test tour of South Africa in 1957‚Äì58. Ian Chappell suggests that Simpson was included \\"mainly for his catching.\\" The young Australian team was derided as the worst to leave Australian shores. In the tour matches leading up to the Tests, Simpson performed consistently. He scored 103 against Transvaal and 53 not out against Eastern Province, and totaled 304 runs at 60.66 in seven matches ahead of the Tests. Although his form during the Tests was poor, Simpson added 150 against Griqualand West and scored 671 runs at 47.92. This earned Simpson his debut against South Africa in the First Test at Johannesburg. He compiled 60 in the first innings before being trapped leg before wicket by Hugh Tayfield. He took three catches and scored 23 not out in the second innings. He struggled in the remaining four Tests, with only 53 more runs in the remaining five innings to end with 136 runs at 22.67 in the Tests. His catching form was exceptional, yielding 13 catches in the five Tests and playing a factor in his retention in the team. In all Simpson took 26 catches in 16 matches.Haigh, p. 114. He took two wickets at 64.50 in the first-class matches, and managed 6/61 in a non-first- class match against the South African Country Districts. Unsatisfied with these performances, he sought the advice of vice-captain Neil Harvey, who advised him that he was playing too square on while defending on the back foot. After his unconvincing performances with the bat in the South African Tests, Simpson needed runs at the start of the 1958‚Äì59 season to retain his position in the national team for the Ashes series against England. His first two matches of the season were for Western Australia and a Western Australia Combined XI against the Englishmen, and he scored 60 and 17. In three further Shield matches, he continued his habit of not converting starts into larger scores, registering scores of between 31 and 67 in all six innings with three half-centuries. Up to this point, he had scored 364 runs at 52.00, and Simpson was selected for the Australian XI match against May's Englishmen, effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests. He failed in both innings with two and a duck, and the hosts were crushed by 345 runs. Simpson was overlooked for selection for the First Test at Brisbane against England. Norm O'Neill, who had scored 1,003 runs at 83.75 in the previous season,Cashman, p. 229. while Simpson was in South Africa, took his middle-order position.Perry, p. 237. Peter Burge failed in the First Test, resulting in Simpson's recall for the Second Test at Melbourne. Simpson made a duck in his only innings as Australia won by eight wickets and was subsequently omitted for the remainder of the series. At the time, Australia had three all rounders who were capable with the bat:Ken Mackay, Richie Benaud and Alan Davidson. This meant that Australia needed only five specialist batsmen and in the Fifth Test of the series, only four were used in order to accommodate an extra bowler. Simpson was facing heavy competition for a Test position. Simpson scored 91 runs in four innings in the remainder of the season, which was not enough for him to force his way back into the Test team. It was another sparse summer with the ball for Simpson, who took two wickets at 41.50. In the Southern Hemisphere winter in 1959, Simpson played a season in the Lancashire League in England as Accrington's professional player, receiving a 950-pound contract. He scored 1,444 runs at 103.14, returning a better statistical analysis than Gary Sobers, and took 47 wickets at 20.82. Simpson's top-score of 122 not out came against Ramsbottom and added another triple-figure score against Bacup, and his season included 11 consecutive fifties including a century, seven of which were unbeaten. In all, he scored two centuries and 14 fifties in 26 innings. He took five-wicket hauls three times with a best of 6/40 against Nelson. Despite this, Simpson was not selected for the squad for the series against India and Pakistan on the 1959‚Äì60 tour of the Indian subcontinent. He started the season with a campaign with a Commonwealth XI in South Africa. In three matches, Simpson continued to suffer problems in converting his starts into large scores. He made 204 runs at 40.80; all his scores were between 31 and 58. He had more success with the ball than in previous seasons, taking five wickets at 19.20. Simpson returned to Australia, he had a productive period in the Sheffield Shield for Western Australia, rectifying his prior problem of not capitalising on his starts. On the advice of Harvey, he reinvented himself as an opening batsman in an attempt to exploit the opportunity opened by the retirement of Test opener Jimmy Burke. At the start of the 1959‚Äì60 Australian season, he scored 98 and took a total of 2/77 in a drawn match against Victoria. In the next match, Simpson broke through for his maiden double- century, posting 236 not out in Western Australia's 4/487 declared against New South Wales. In contrast, Simpson's native state could manage a match total of only 382 in an innings defeat, as he took 1/17 and 5/45. Simpson then made his second double-century in as many innings, posting 230 not out in an innings win against Queensland, more than 57% of his team's runs. His innings of 79 in the draw against South Australia was his lowest score of the season and ended the summer with 98 and 161 not out against New South Wales, carrying his bat in the second innings of a defeat and again scoring the majority of his state's runs for the match. Simpson reflected that \\"I spent two years turning myself into an overnight success.\\" These efforts yielded a total of 902 runs at 300.66, and nine wickets at 38.66. He was selected for a non-Test tour of New Zealand by Australia's Second XI, as the first-choice team was still in the subcontinent. Playing as an opener, he scored 418 runs at 69.66 in four representative matches. This included an unbeaten 129 in the third match that guided Australia to an eight-wicket win. During this period, Simpson transformed into a less flamboyant and more solid player who eschewed the hook shot and swayed backwards to avoid short balls. He also took 10 wickets at 27.60 in the international matches, including 4/80 in the second innings of the second fixture. Just prior to the next Australian season, Simpson was selected for the International Cavaliers team that toured South Africa and Rhodesia. He played in four matches and scored 428 runs at 71.33, including a 178 against Transvaal and 128 against the South African Invitation XI. He took nine wickets at 35.44, including 4/110 against Natal.  Consolidation =1960‚Äì61 Season In the first match of the new Australian season, Simpson scored 87 out of Western Australia's modest 140 against the touring West Indies. After the visitors collapsed for 97, Simpson then added 221 not out and took a total of 2/69 to help defeat the Caribbeans. He was then selected for an Australian XI in a virtual Test trial against the West Indies, but made only a duck and 17 and took a total of 1/103. In the last two matches before the Tests, against South Australia, Simpson's batting tapered off with 120 runs in four innings, but he was in fine form with the ball, taking a total of 11/206. Nevertheless, as a result of his strong domestic form, Simpson was recalled to the Test team for the 1960‚Äì61 home series against the West Indies, as an opener partnering Colin McDonald. He had a consistent series, scoring 449 runs at 49.44. Simpson figured prominently in the First Test at Brisbane, which was the first Tied Test in history. He scored his highest score to date, 92 in the first innings and took match figures of 3/43, in his first success bowling display at Test level. His first Test wicket was Joe Solomon, hit wicket in the first innings, before removing the batsman again in the second innings. Australia were set 233 for victory and Simpson made a duck. The hosts collapsed to 6/92 before a 134-run stand took them to 6/226 before another late flurry of wickets led to a tie. Simpson continued his all-round form in the next two Shield matches, taking 11 wickets in total, including a 106 and a match total of 7/87 in a ten-wicket win over Victoria. He followed this with 49 and 27* as Australia took the series lead with a seven-wicket win in the Second Test in Melbourne. Simpson then scored 70 and 149 for the Tasmania Combined XI in a loss to the West Indians, scoring more than half of the team's runs. After failing to pass 20 as the series was leveled in the Third Test, Simpson contributed 85 in a Fourth Test draw in Adelaide. Simpson saved his best performance for the deciding Test in Melbourne, scoring 75 in the first innings to complement match figures of 3/106. He removed the tourists' leading batsman Garry Sobers in both innings, caught behind by Grout, ending with a total of 3/106 from 36 overs. He had to bowl heavily as captain and front-line leg spinner Richie Benaud was increasingly troubled by a chronic shoulder injury. Australia was set 258 for victory in the second innings with the series poised at 1‚Äì1. Simpson's captain Richie Benaud instructed him to immediately attack West Indian spearhead Wes Hall at the start of run chase. Hall bowled at extreme pace and Simpson was aiming to seize the initiative. He struck four consecutive boundaries and took 18 runs from the first over, hooking and driving. Simpson reached 27 in 14 balls and Hall was withdrawn from the attack, resulting in an ovation from the crowd. Simpson's start enabled Australia to reach 1/57 at stumps before completing a two wicket victory after a middle-order stumble, completing a 2‚Äì1 series win. Simpson scored 92, the top score for the match, and finished with 445 runs at 49.44 for the series.Cricinfo ‚Äì Statsguru ‚Äì RB Simpson ‚Äì Tests ‚Äì Innings by innings list He returned to his native state of New South Wales after 60‚Äì61, after four seasons for Western Australia, in which he produced 2470 runs at 79.67. Playing for an assortment of teams in three warm-up matches before heading off for his first Test tour of England, Simpson struck 71, 108, 78 and 30, and took five wickets at 53.60. 1961 Tour of England During the 1961 tour to England, he began his celebrated opening partnership with Bill Lawry, when the Victorian broke into the Australian team. Initially, Simpson was moved into the middle-order so that Lawry could open with McDonald.Perry, p. 238. This occurred after Lawry scored heavily in the tour matches ahead of the Tests, scoring several centuries, whereas Simpson failed to make the most of his starts. In his first six county matches, Simpson reached double figures six times in ten innings. He passed 25 on all six occasions, but only passed fifty once, scoring a 72 against Yorkshire. Simpson struck form in his last two matches before the Tests. Against the Marylebone Cricket Club, which fielded several Test players, he struck an unbeaten 92 in an unbroken 186-run opening stand with Lawry in the second innings to set up a match-winning declaration, and took a total of 4/105 with his leg spin. He then broke through for his maiden first-class ton on English soil, striking 148 in an innings win over Oxford University. He ended the lead-in matches with 569 runs at 52.72 and 17 wickets at 30.05 including 4/13 and 3/56 against Surrey and Lancashire. With Benaud continuing to be hampered by his shoulder, Simpson would often bowl heavily throughout the English summer. Simpson started well on his return to the Test middle-order scoring 75 in Australia's only innings of 9/516 in the drawn First Test at Edgbaston. He did not bowl in the first innings, but after Benaud's shoulder gave way in the second innings, Simpson sent down 34 overs as a makeshift lead spinner. He struggled against the hosts' batsmen, taking 1/87 and removing Ted Dexter for 180 as the English amassed 4/401 to stave off defeat. With Benaud still injured, he took five wickets in the next two county fixtures, totalling 56 overs. He continued to make starts without going on to complete big scores, compiling three innings between 35 and 65. Simpson was unable to pass 20 in the next two Tests, which were shared. In the Second Test at Lord's in the absence of Benaud, Simpson took 1/32 from 19 overs in the second innings, removed Ray Illingworth caught at leg slip from a googly immediately after stand-in captain Harvey moved himself to the position.Robinson, p. 166. In between these Tests, he struck a 103 against Lancashire. In the Third Test at Headingley, Simpson made two and three and went wicketless as England levelled the series with an eight-wicket win. He was prominent in the Fourth Test when he started his pairing with Lawry at the top of the order at Old Trafford. An Australian victory would result in a 2‚Äì1 lead and the retention of the Ashes. Their first Test stand together was not successful; Simpson fell for four as Australia made only 190. After taking 4/23 in the English first innings,Perry, p. 239. removing Ken Barrington for 78 and cleaning up the tail with three more wickets, despite which England had a first-innings lead of 177. He scored 51 in the second innings in a century stand with Lawry‚Äîthe first by either team in the seriesPollard, pp. 64‚Äì65.‚Äîwhich allowed Australia to reach set a winning target on the last day. Early on, England appeared destined for the target, as Dexter plundered 21 from Simpson's first four overs. However, the English batsman fell and Simpson did not concede a run in his remaining four overs.Haigh, pp. 170‚Äì171. He claimed the wicket of Fred Trueman as England collapsed to be all out for 201 on the final afternoon to cede the Ashes. After the triumph at Old Trafford, Simpson had a run of heavy-scoring in the county matches before the final Test, scoring 116, 132 and 6, and 160, ending unbeaten in all but the last innings, against Glamorgan, Warwickshire and Yorkshire. He added a further 3/21 and 3/48 in the last of these matches, although the hosts still managed to hang on for a draw. Aside from the effort at Manchester, Simpson's Test series was otherwise unproductive, with 191 runs at 23.88 and seven wickets at 32.71. He finished with 40 in a drawn Fifth Test at the Oval. After the Tests, Simpson continued his habit of not converting his starts into large totals, making five consecutive scores between 20 and 62 before scoring 121 in his final first-class innings of the season against TN Pearce's XI. He was also punished by opposition batsmen in the last three matches in England, conceding a century in an innings three times, including a 1/139 from only 15 overs in the second innings against Pearce's XI. 1961‚Äì62 Season The 1961‚Äì62 season was purely domestic and Simpson returned to his native state as they completed a ninth consecutive Sheffield Shield win. New South Wales won six of their eight matches, of which Simpson played in all. He recorded solid results without being spectacular, with an unbeaten 110 in addition to five half- centuries, although two of these were not out. He saved his best performance for the two wins over arch-rivals Victoria. He scored 110 and took a total of 4/99 in the first match. In the second match, he contributed in each innings. After taking 3/66 as Victoria batted first, he scored 95 to help New South Wales take a 63-run lead. Simpson then took 3/31 in the second innings and made an unbeaten 67 as his native state cantered to a ten-wicket win. He removed Lawry twice in the two matches. Apart from the ten wickets against the Victorians, Simpson had little success with the ball totalling 13 wickets at 42.30. He aggregated 636 runs at 48.92 for the Shield campaign. At the end of the season, Simpson was part of an International XI that toured New Zealand and played against local teams as well as outfits from Pakistan and India. In five matches, he hit three centuries, including two 167s, and three half- centuries, all of which were undefeated to end with 663 runs at 132.60. His bowling was less successful, with 11 wickets at 46.63 1962‚Äì63 Season Simpson started the 1962‚Äì63 season looking to rectify the disparity between his prolific run-scoring at first-class level and his modest returns in the international arena. He started the Australian summer in fine form, scoring a century in each of his four games ahead of the Tests against Dexter's touring Englishmen. Three of these centuries‚Äî109 and 66 not out, 130 and 9, and 110‚Äîcame in matches against the English visitors. His bowling against the tourists was not as effective totalling 4/239. Simpson started solidly in the international matches, scoring twin half centuries in the drawn First Test in Brisbane, although he was punished with the ball, registering 1/100 from 25 overs. After Australia went 1‚Äì0 down in Melbourne, Simpson totalling 52 and going wicketless, Simpson produced a match-winning all round performance in the Third Test in front of his home crowd in Sydney to help Australia level the series. On a dry surface where almost the entire square was devoid of grass, Simpson took his Test best innings haul of 5/57, removing specialist batsmen Colin Cowdrey and Geoff Pullar after they had been set, and then cleaning up the tail to restrict England to 279. He then scored 91 to help Australia accumulate a first-innings lead of 40. England were then dismissed in their second innings for 104, leaving a victory target of just 65. Simpson made an aggressive unbeaten 34, with English captain Ted Dexter plundered for 27 runs in his three overs. A storm hit the ground and stayed for two days just after Australia reached the target, which could have washed out the match and saved England.Benaud, p. 204. As the last two Tests were drawn, this was the difference between Australia retaining and losing the Ashes. Simpson was not prominent in the last two matches. He scored 71 in the second innings of the Fourth Test but made 32 and two ducks in the other innings, and took a total of 2/163 in the last two Tests, conceding more than four runs per over. He ended the series with 401 runs at 44.56 and eight wickets at 46.13. Simpson continued to be prolific away from the Tests, scoring 205 against Western Australia in a Shield match. Simpson took a total of 22 wickets for the season.  Captaincy  New South Welshmen and senior Test players Neil Harvey and Alan Davidson retired at the end of the 1962‚Äì63 season,Cashman, pp. 73, 119. with Simpson being elevated to the vice-captaincy of both NSW and Australia (under Richie Benaud) at the start of the 1963‚Äì64 season. In his first innings of the season, Simpson made his highest first-class score of 359, against Queensland, scoring more than half of his team's 661 in an innings win. Playing for a Western Australia Combined XI against the touring South Africans at Perth, Simpson and Benaud combined for a 237-run partnership in the second innings, with Simpson making 246, having scored only four in the first innings. In the next match for New South Wales against Western Australia, Simpson hit an unbeaten 247 as Benaud's men amassed 1/425 declared. Up to this point he had scored 856 runs at 285.33 for the season in four innings. In the second innings, he was dropped down the order to allow other players an opportunity, and he was not required to bat as New South Wales reached their target of 262 with nine wickets in hand. However, Simpson's form peaked ahead of the Tests. He made 41 in his next four innings in tour matches against the South Africans ahead of the Tests, including three scores of no more than one. The First Test against South Africa at Brisbane was drawn and is remembered for the no-balling of Ian Meckiff, which ended his career as Benaud refused to bowl him again.Cashman, p. 211. Simpson scored 12 and 34 and took a solitary wicket. After the game, Benaud injured himself in a grade match so Simpson captained NSW for the first time and scored 135 against Victoria. A few days later in the Second Test at Melbourne, with Benaud still absent, Simpson led Australia for the first time. Simpson's appointment to the top job raised eyebrows in some quarters, as he had a reputation for being abrasive, and others had been more successful and experienced at domestic level. Lawry had led Victoria to the Sheffield Shield in 1962‚Äì63 and Western Australia's Barry Shepherd had also been praised for his aggressive and bold leadership.Haigh, p. 192. At the time Simpson had scored only 1246 runs at 32.78 and taken 22 wickets at 39.40 in 23 Tests and had not scored a century. Simpson was leading an inexperienced team with Benaud, Harvey and Davidson all gone; only Wally Grout and himself remained from the Tied Test team three years earlier. He scored a duck and 55 not out, being at the crease as Australia scored the winning runs to take a 1‚Äì0 lead in the series. Benaud then informed the Board of Control that he would be retiring at season's end, so it was arranged for Benaud to return to the team and play under Simpson to give the latter experience for the forthcoming tour of England. Australia lost the Fourth Test heavily by ten wickets, the other two matches were drawn, and the series finished 1‚Äì1.Benaud pp. 208‚Äì211 Simpson scored half-centuries in both the Third and Fourth Tests and ended the series with 361 runs at 40.11 average. His combination with Lawry consistently propelled Australia to solid starts, posting at least 50 in each of their opening stands. However, he continued to be plagued by an inability to convert his starts into large scores at the highest level of competition. He passed 25 in 8 of his 10 innings for the series, but could only manage three fifties. As a captain, Simpson was less willing to bowl, taking only two wickets for the Test series, and only four wickets in seven first-class matches since taking up the top job. Despite his heavy scoring at first-class level, Simpson was yet to hit a Test century when he arrived with his team in England in 1964. After making a slow start to the tour and not passing 31 in his first four innings, Simpson struck form after the first week of May. He passed 50 in seven consecutive innings, making 125 against Somerset, 138 and 55 against Surrey, 57 against Glamorgan, 95 against Cambridge University, and 105 and 52‚Äîboth not out‚Äîin a nine-wicket win over the MCC. He augmented this with 4/48 against Surrey. The first three Tests continued Simpson's frustrating personal run in Test cricket. He made 50 in the First Test at Trent Bridge, but did not pass 30 in the next two Tests, twice falling after reaching 20. Australia led 1‚Äì0 after winning the Third Test at Headingley. Arriving for the Fourth Test at Old Trafford, Australia required only to draw to retain the Ashes, because a win for England in the final Fifth Test would yield a 1‚Äì1 series draw.Perry, p. 233. Simpson hit form in the three county matches leading up to the Test at Manchester, scoring 117 against Leicestershire and scoring fifties in the last three innings. He had also taken eight wickets in four innings. On a flat, batsman-friendly pitch, Simpson won the toss and elected to bat. Having scored more than 40 first-class centuries, he was still looking for his first Test ton. Simpson's plan was to bat as long as possible to ensure that defeat would be avoided and the Ashes retained. Simpson and Lawry gave Australia an ideal start with a solid opening partnership, which yielded 201 runs, before Lawry was run out for 106. Simpson then slowly progressed through the 90s before reaching his first Test century. Speaking of his relief at reaching the milestone, Simpson recalled \\"I don't know of any player who was on the international scene as long as I without scoring a century. I was feeling a bit silly about it by this stage.\\"Perry, p. 234. Simpson continued on his quest of batting England out of the game. Following the dismissal of Ian Redpath (19), Norm O'Neill (47) and Peter Burge (34), Brian Booth went about building the sixth-wicket partnership on the second day. Simpson combined in another double century stand, 219, before Booth was out for 98. Simpson was 265 at the close of play, and resumed Australia's innings. This time, he was in an aggressive mood, scoring a further 46 runs in 40 minutes before being dismissed for 311. Australia declared at 8/656. Simpson's 13-hour innings was the longest by an Australian at first-class level. He joined Don Bradman as the second Australian to have made a Test triple century in England. Bob Simpson became only the second man in cricket history to score a triple ton as his first Test century, the other being Sir Garfield Sobers. Later in December 2016, an Indian cricketer Karun Nair, joined this elite club when he scored 303 not out, as his maiden century against England at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai Simpson's safety-first approach was severely criticised. The Daily Mail called it the \\"murder of Test cricket\\": at one stage, six journalists in the press box were seen to be sleeping while he was batting. Simpson defended his tactics, asserting that with a series lead, batting England out of the match was the best way to retain the Ashes.Cricinfo ‚Äì Eleven featherbed fixtures The tactic paid off as the match ended in a high- scoring draw and the Ashes were retained.Perry, p. 235. Another draw in the Fifth Test at The Oval, in which Simpson scored 24, ensured that Australia won the series 1‚Äì0. Despite a persistent thumb injury, Simpson scored 458 runs at 76.33 in the five Tests, and 1,714 runs (including five centuries) for the tour. Apart from their double century effort at Old Trafford, Simpson and Lawry passed 50 for the opening wicket on only one occasion. Simpson took his career-best innings bowling figures during the tour, claiming 5/33 against Glamorgan. During the tour, Simpson drew attention for a possible breach of the Australian Cricket Board's rules on players writing about cricket. Simpson had been given permission to write in London's Daily Express, but his columns were syndicated in Australian newspapers. However, the board cleared Simpson of any wrongdoing.Haigh and Frith, p. 135. Australia then made a brief tour of the subcontinent during their return voyage, playing three Tests against India and one against Pakistan. These were played consecutively, with no other tour matches. Simpson continued his consistent performances, scoring 292 runs at 48.67 with three half-centuries in a 1‚Äì1 drawn series against India. His best performance was at the drawn Third Test at Eden Gardens in Calcutta where he scored 67 and 71 and took 4/45. India levelled the series with a narrow two- wicket win in the Second Test after Australia won the First by 139 runs. On the spinning tracks of India, Simpson bowled himself more often, ending with six wickets at 25.17, including a 4/45 in the first innings of the Third Test, as well as taking eight catches. At Karachi, Simpson struck 153 and 115 against Pakistan in a drawn Test to become the third captain to hit two centuries in the same Test. He ended the calendar year of 1964 with 1,381 Test runs, setting a world record aggregate. In 1964‚Äì65, Simpson led Australia on a tour of the Caribbean, which was marred by controversies over umpiring standards and the legality of West Indian Charlie Griffith's bowling action. To make life more difficult, some of the grounds had no sightscreens, making it even harder to see the ball. Griffith also dragged his foot, bringing him around a metre closer to the batsman before releasing his balls at extreme pace. Simpson initially struggled against Griffith, failing to pass 30 in the first three Tests as Australia conceded a 0‚Äì2 lead. He scored only 87 in five innings, but had success with the ball, capturing 4/83 in the second innings of the Second Test at Trinidad. Adjusting his technique, Simpson scored 201 in the Fourth Test at Barbados, where he set an Australian record opening stand of 382 with Lawry. The match was drawn, but Australia managed a consolation win in the Fifth Test, to which Simpson contributed 72 and 34 not out. His average for 399 runs was 49.88 and he took 11 catches. Simpson made his displeasure regarding Griffith known to the Australian board, and this was relayed to the West Indian administrators.Haigh and Frith, p. 140.  International twilight  Simpson's appearances during the 1965‚Äì66 Ashes series were intermittent. He missed the First Test due to a broken wrist,Perry, p. 240. which ended in a draw under the leadership of Booth. He returned for the Second Test at Melbourne, scoring a half-century in both innings of a drawn match. Chickenpox forced him to miss the Third Test, which Australia lost by an innings.Perry, p. 245. It was the first time that Australia had lost by an innings since 1956, and the selectors responded by dropping four players including Booth. On his return for the Fourth Test at Adelaide Simpson made 225, making 244 runs in 255 minutes with Lawry, the highest opening stand by Australia against England and still the highest against England in Australia. Australia claimed a decisive innings victory to level the series and a draw in the Fifth Test allowed Australia to retain the Ashes. Simpson topped the batting averages with 355 runs at 88.75 average. In 1966‚Äì67, Simpson's captaincy was widely criticised when Australia were soundly defeated 1‚Äì3 during the tour of South Africa. The series started well for Simpson as he scored 65, 48, 153 and 18 and took eight wickets in the first two Tests at Johannesburg and Cape Town. The series was level after the two matches. However, Australia's performances fell away thereafter, and Simpson 's 94 in the Third Test at Durban was his only other contribution above 40. For the second time, Simpson was ardent in his criticism of the local umpiring during a major tour. During the 1967‚Äì68 series against India, Simpson's all- round performances were exceptional. He scored 55 and 103 in the First Test at Adelaide, then scored 109 and took 4/49 in the Second Test at Melbourne. Australia won both Tests, the second by an innings. After deciding that he would retire at the end of the season, Simpson was omitted for the Third Test so that other players could have international experience before the 1968 tour of England. Simpson returned to the team for the Fourth Test at Sydney in front of his home crowd. In his international farewell, he played under the captaincy of Lawry. Simpson recorded his best Test match figures of 3/39 and 5/99, and claimed five catches in another Australian victory. His final series yielded 294 runs (at 58.80 average), 13 wickets at 16.38 and seven catches.  Retirement and comeback  Retired from Test cricket, Simpson toured England in 1968 as a member of the press gallery and later worked in public relations. He looked after promotion and marketing earnings for cricketers in an era where they struggled to survive financially.Perry, p. 241. During the 1975‚Äì76 season, he had organised for both Australian and West Indian players to market shampoo and deodorant, and he helped to find sponsors for the Australian team.Haigh and Frith, p. 177. He also called for the revival of the Cavaliers XI concept to boost the popularity of cricket.Haigh and Frith, p. 183. He wrote a book titled Captain's Story, in which he expressed his anger against bowlers that he believed to have bowled with an illegal action. His former teammate Meckiff took issue with the contents and sued for libel. After five years of litigation, Simpson settled out of court and apologised to Meckiff. When Test cricket was devastated by the breakaway World Series Cricket in 1977, Simpson made a comeback after a decade in retirement to captain New South Wales and Australia at the age of 41. All of Australia's first-choice players had defected apart from Jeff Thomson. Simpson had been playing for Western Suburbs in Sydney Grade Cricket but had not been playing at first- class level for a decade. Bob Simpson's career performance graph. His first assignment was a five Test series against India, and Simpson began where he left off a decade earlier. He top-scored with 89 in the second innings of the First Test in Brisbane, before scoring 176 and 39 as Australia won in Perth. Simpson failed to pass double figures in the Third Test in Melbourne, and made 30s in both innings in Sydney, as the Indians won two consecutive Tests to level the series. Simpson responded with 100 and 51 in the deciding Fifth Test in Adelaide as Australia scraped to a 3‚Äì2 series victory. Simpson totalled 539 runs at 53.90 and took four wickets. He then led Australia on a tour of the West Indies, then the strongest team in the world. He made only one half century, 67 in the Third Test in Georgetown, Guyana. It was the only Test that Australia won in a 3‚Äì1 series loss. He had a disappointing series scoring 199 runs at 22.11 and taking seven wickets at 52.28. Simpson wanted to continue playing Tests as Australia hosted Mike Brearley's Englishmen in 1978‚Äì79. His players wanted him to continue, but the Australian Cricket Board voted him out and installed Graham Yallop as the skipper. During his comeback, he had accumulated his 60th first-class century against Barbados during the Caribbean tour and become the oldest Australian to score a Test century on home soil.Perry, p. 242. Simpson retired after the tour at the age of 42. He had scored 5,317 runs for New South Wales at 53.17. In Sydney Grade Cricket, he scored 10,111 runs at 61.65 and took 186 wickets at 23.62.  Playing style  In his prime Simpson was known for his technical correctness. At slightly below average height, his noted ability to bat for long periods was attributed to his high fitness and concentration levels. He had a wide array of shots, in particular off the back foot. Along with Bill Lawry, he formed an opening partnership that was regarded as one of the finest in Test history. Simpson was fast between the wickets, and the pair were especially well known for their understanding, as exemplified by their fluency in rotating the strike with quick singles. Simpson's stance was easy and his style attractive, the result of a change of technique in the late 1950s when he turned from playing too square-on to side-on. Simpson found that it made all the difference to him in dealing effectively with the in-dipper and going-away balls. Standing 179 cm and weighing , Simpson was most effective as an attacking batsman. Simpson was best known for his straight-drive and powerfully hit square-cut, as well as an on-drive taken from his toes. He rarely played the hook shot, regarding it as risky, and used the pull shot in moderation. Early in his career, Simpson had a square-on stance but converted to a more side on position, finding it easier to deal with swing bowling. As a bowler, Simpson had a heavy dependence on the leg-break, noting that his overuse of the googly often lead to erratic performance. He was regularly used at Test level as an occasional leg spin bowler, averaging more than one wicket per Test, and twice taking five wickets in an innings. He totalled 349 wickets at 38.07 in 247 first- class matches, including six five wicket hauls. A fine slips fielder, he was regarded as the best of his era,Perry, p. 243. and was fast enough to catch flies with his hands. He took 110 catches, setting a world record in Tests, at nearby two catches per Test, a rate higher than any other non-wicketkeeper. As Australia's Test captain, Simpson was described by Gideon Haigh as having \\"flint in his fibre\\" and a \\"drill sergeant among skippers\\". Simpson had a strong belief in discipline, work ethic and the subordination of the individual to the needs of the team. When he later returned as coach of the Australian team when it was going through a barren run in the mid-1980s, he gained a reputation for being a disciplinarian coach who raised fitness and fielding standards to a higher level. His methods sometimes caused conflict with players, but by his retirement in 1996, Australia had regained its position as the world's leading Test nation.  Coaching career  thumb In 1986, Simpson took over as coach of an Australian team which was young, demoralised and regarded as soft.Perry, p. 320. A considerable turnover of players due to constant failure in the past eighteen months had seen the likes of Steve Waugh, David Boon, Dean Jones, Craig McDermott and Geoff Marsh all make their debuts under captain Allan Border. Prior to his first series, the tour of New Zealand, Australia had not won a series for two years. In that period they managed three wins, 11 losses and eight draws. His appointment bore little initial fruit. They won none of their eleven Tests in 1986, and lost three. By the end of the 1986‚Äì87 Australian season, Australia had only won two of their last 22 Tests, and none of their last 14. They had gone three years without winning a Test series. The 1987 Cricket World Cup heralded the start of more prosperous times for Australian cricket. Rank outsiders, Australia defeated hosts India by one run in the opening match, and New Zealand twice by three and 17 runs respectively. They capitalised on these hard fought wins to take five victories from their six-round robin matches. They then defeated Pakistan by 18 runs after inducing a late collapse in the semifinal, and then claimed the title by seven runs with a similar late surge over England in the final. The success spilled into the Test arena, with the 1987‚Äì88 home season yielding saw Australia's first Test series victory for four years, with a 1‚Äì0 series victory over New Zealand. The season was completed with one-off Tests against England and Sri Lanka respectively, which ended in a draw and win respectively. The 1988‚Äì89 season began with a tour of Pakistan. Australia were unable to end the 29 year streak without a win on Pakistani soil, 1‚Äì0. Simpson and Border were criticised for their outspoken criticism of the umpiring and doctored pitches.Perry, p. 323. It was typical of the hard nosed approach they had brought to the team, with Border being given the epithet \\"Captain Grumpy\\".Cashman, p. 323. Simpson was unable to guide his team past the dominant West Indies, who toured Australia in 1988‚Äì89 and took a 3‚Äì1 Test series victory, but he was able to regain the Ashes with a 4‚Äì0 result on the 1989 tour, which also saw opener Mark Taylor establish himself as a Test match player; Taylor later became captain under Simpson.Cashman, pp. 30, 291. The 1989‚Äì90 Australian season saw further growth, as the Australia played one, two and three Tests against New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Pakistan respectively. Simpson's men won a Test each against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, while the others were drawn. It was the first Australian season in six years where they were undefeated. The 1990‚Äì91 season saw another comfortable Ashes series win, 3‚Äì0. Early 1991 saw a five Test tour of the West Indies, the first since the heavy 3‚Äì0 defeat in 1983. Australia had improved, managing a 2‚Äì1 loss.Christison, p. 35. The 1991‚Äì92 Australian season saw a heavy 4‚Äì0 win in a five Test series over India,Christison, p. 36. but was marred by Australia's ignominious 1992 Cricket World Cup campaign on home soil. The pre-tournament favourites, they were eliminated in the group stages, coming fifth. The 1992‚Äì93 saw another tour to Australia by the West Indies, the only team against which Simpson was yet to record a series victory as coach. After taking a 1‚Äì0 series lead into the Fourth Test, Simpson's team lost by one run, failing to seal the Frank Worrell Trophy. This left the series to be decided in the Fifth Test at the WACA Ground in Perth, a ground at which the West Indies had then never lost a Test match. Australia were unable to regroup and succumbed to the pace of the West Indies, whose fast bowling was enhanced by the bouncy surface of the pitch. Australia collapsed from 1/58 in the first innings to be dismissed for 119, with Curtly Ambrose taking a spell of 7/1. Australia were crushed by an innings within three days, and victory over the Caribbeans again eluded them. 1993 saw a return to England for another Ashes tour. Australia won the series 4‚Äì1, and returned home to claim the Trans Tasman Trophy with a comfortable 2‚Äì0 victory over New Zealand at home in late 1993. This was followed by two drawn series, home and away against South Africa, the first competition between the teams post- apartheid. At the end of the 1993‚Äì94 Border retired. The four previous seasons had seen the team strengthening introductions of Mark Waugh, Shane Warne, Michael Slater and Glenn McGrath in each of the respective seasons. The Waugh brothers, along with Taylor, Slater and Boon were to be the core of Australia's batting lineup which was to re-establish the nation at the top of international cricket in the following years. Warne revived leg spin, believed to be the dying art, and was to become the leading wicket-taker in Test history, while McGrath became the leading wicket-taking fast bowler in Test history. With Taylor taking over as captain, Australia headed to Pakistan in late 1994. Despite having the ascendancy for most of the First Test, they lost by one wicket, and after two high scoring draws in which they held the initiative, Australia suffered a 1‚Äì0 series loss, still unable to win a match in Pakistan since 1959.Piesse, pp. 25‚Äì29. Australia then took a 3‚Äì1 home Ashes series victory in 1994‚Äì95,Piesse, pp. 41‚Äì55. and then finally reclaimed the Frank Worrell Trophy with a 2‚Äì1 series win in the Caribbean in mid-1995, thereby establishing themselves as the leading Test team in the world.Piesse, pp. 64‚Äì75. After the match, Taylor took the winning cricket ball to Simpson, who at the time was recovering from a blood clot in his leg. After 2‚Äì1 and 3‚Äì0 series win over Pakistan and Sri Lanka at home in 1995‚Äì96,Piesse, pp. 225‚Äì226. Simpson made his coaching swan song at the 1996 Cricket World Cup on the Indian subcontinent,Piesse, pp. 96‚Äì98. where Australia overcame a forfeit to Sri Lanka in the group phase due to a Tamil Tiger bombing. After narrow wins over New Zealand and the West Indies in the quarter and semifinals, they lost in the final to Sri Lanka.Piesse, pp. 95‚Äì96. Coaching legacy Simpson inherited an Australian cricket team which had not won a series for three years, and had gone fourteen Tests without a victory. It was a team plagued by a lack of direction with unsettled personnel. His appointment saw Australia win the World Cup within one year, and steady improvement in Test results. Instilling Simpson along with Border had transformed it into one of the strongest teams in international cricket by the 1990s, and with the defeat of the West Indies in 1995, was regarded as the leading Test team in the world. The core group of players cultivated by Simpson went on to make strengthen Australia into the overwhelmingly dominant cricketing nation in the decade after his retirement. Under Taylor, Australia consolidated its position with a home series victory against the West Indies in 1996‚Äì97 and home and away wins over South Africa in 1997‚Äì98 before breaking a 39-year drought with victory in Pakistan. In 1999, Steve Waugh became captain on Taylor's retirement and in his five years as captain set a world record of 41 Test victories, including a world record of 16 consecutively. In 2004, Ricky Ponting, who made his international debut in Simpsons's last season, became captain and whitewashed Sri Lanka in an away series 3‚Äì0 and Adam Gilchrist, who filled in for Ricky Ponting for the first three matches of a four test series against India, sealed the series with an unassailable 2‚Äì0, lead with Australia eventually defeating India 2‚Äì1 on the subcontinent. It sealed Australia's first series win in India for 35 years, described as the \\"Final Frontier\\", and meant that Australia had defeated every other nation in each of their most recent home and away series against them. Since the 1999 Cricket World Cup, Australia has had an unbeaten streak of 28 World Cup matches and an unprecedented winning percentage of greater than 75% in Tests. With the retirement in 2007 of Warne and McGrath, the driving force between Australia's domination of the subsequent era with more than 1,200 Test wickets between them, the generation of players established under Simpson's watch came to an end.  Later coaching career  thumb He coached Lancashire for two years, ending in September 2001.Cricinfo ‚Äì Bobby Simpson to leave Lancashire Earlier, he had coached Leicestershire. His insistence on hard work was less successful in England, and was often speculated to be due to a difference in psychology in the two countries.Cricinfo ‚Äì Battles lost upstairs In late 2004, Simpson accepted a three-year contract to act as a cricket advisor to Rajasthan in the Ranji Trophy. He had served as a consultant to the Indian cricket team in the late 1990s.Cricinfo ‚Äì Simpson to work as cricket advisor with Rajasthan In the early 2000s, Simpson was part of the International Cricket Council's committee for dealing with throwing. In 2004, he condemned the ICC, claiming that it was soft on illegal bowling actions and that the number of illegitimate bowlers was at an all-time high. He asserted that officials were reluctant to crack down on high-profile bowlers with dubious actions, saying that it was encouraging young players to mimic their actions.Cricinfo ‚Äì Simpson slams proliferation of chuckers Simpson was a traditionalist coach, tending to emphasise the fundamentals of batting, bowling and fielding. He has criticised the 21st century style of coaching, which has increasingly used computer technology, biomechanics and science to recommend playing techniques, stating that it had verged into \\"computers for computers' sake\\".Cricinfo ‚Äì The fundamentalist He also coached the Netherlands national cricket team, overseeing a successful ICC Trophy campaign which saw them qualify for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Simpson called for the Netherlands to be incorporated into the English domestic league so that they could gain more experience. Honours Simpson was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1965 and inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. He was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2006 and the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in 2013.

Early years Yang was born in Beijing in 1977, and began playing the guitar when she was seven. Three years later, she started studying under Chen Zhi, the Chairman of the China Classical Guitar Society. She made a public debut at the First China International Guitar Festival, where she met with an immediate acclaim. At her debut, one of the most respected luthiers, Masaru Kohno, presented her a guitar, Pepe by Aria; it was her first foreign-made guitar. The next achievement that she made was a second prize at the Beijing Senior Guitar competition; at that time, she was only eleven. As a schoolgirl, Yang rapidly achieved an international reputation, playing extensively in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Spain, and Australia, and giving concert tours in Taiwan, Japan and Portugal. At twelve, she played in Tokyo for the first time, and was given a special award by the Guitar Alliance of Japan. Masaru Kohno, this time, took Yang to his studio and asked her to take any guitar with her. She played the Kohno guitar, made of cedar and jacaranda, regularly over the next five years. During her Madrid debut at age 14, the composer Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo was among the audience; in 1995, after John Williams listened to her performance in Beijing, he was so impressed that he loaned two of his own Greg Smallman guitars to her conservatory, for her and other top students to play. Further education After completing her secondary schooling, Yang went on to complete her studies in Beijing, becoming the first guitarist to enter a music school in China, and obtaining a Bachelor of Arts from the prestigious Central Conservatory of Music. She then become the first guitarist from China to study in the United Kingdom and the first guitarist ever to receive an international scholarship from the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music for her postgraduate programme at the Royal Academy of Music in London. She moved to London in 2000, studying under Michael Lewin, John Mills and Timothy Walker and further establishing her international career with many solo recitals and concert performances in the UK and Europe. She graduated with distinction in 2002, achieving a Recital Diploma and receiving the Royal Academy of Music Principal's prize for exceptional all-round studentship. Awards Yang has won numerous prizes in music competitions including the Stotsenberg International Classical Guitar Competition, the San Francisco International Guitar Competition and the Young Concert Artist International competition in the United States, and the Darwin International Guitar Competition in Australia. She was awarded first prize in the Ivor Mairants Guitar Award by the City of London's Worshipful Company of Musicians, and won the Dorothy Grinstead Prize for a recital at Fairfield Hall, Croydon. Performances Yang has already given recitals or concerts in many countries, including the United Kingdom, the U.S., Germany, France, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, Australia, China, Japan and Singapore. Concert appearances have included playing Rodrigo's \\"Fantasia para un Gentilhombre\\" with the BBC Concert Orchestra and \\"Concierto de Aranjuez\\" with the Royal Academy of Music Symphony Orchestra at Duke's Hall. She has featured on radio as part of the BBC Proms London Composer Portrait series, and performed at 54 concerts for the \\"Night of the Proms Tour\\" in 2003/2004. In January 2011 she appeared in Ireland for the first time, at the National Concert Hall in Dublin. Recordings Si Ji (Four Seasons) contains a number of compositions by Chinese composers, some of which imitate the sounds of traditional Chinese musical instruments. Romance de Amor comprises primarily Spanish repertoire. Reception * \\"But the star of the evening was the Chinese guitarist Xuefei Yang.

It is situated 15 km north-west of Vredenburg and 145 km north of Cape Town, at Cape Columbine between Saldanha Bay and St Helena Bay. The town covers an area of 194.8 hectare and has approximately 1883 inhabitants. The origin of the name remains unknown. Many people believe that the name, which means ‚ÄòOur Father‚Äô in Latin, refers to prayers said by Catholic Portuguese seamen when they became shipwrecked. It appears as St. Martins Paternoster on an old map of Pieter Mortier. Other people believe it refers to the beads that the Khoi tribe wore that were called Paternosters. Economy and tourism Paternoster is a sought after tourist destination and is known for lobster and the white-washed fishermen‚Äôs cottages. The remarkable coastline of jagged cliffs and white boulders makes this one of the most beautiful beaches on the West Coast of South Africa. The area is a pillar in the South African commercial fishing industry. The town itself has a lobster factory and a newly erected Kabeljou farm, whilst the local people catch and sell herring, or draw mussels from the rocks. In the greater area are several more commercial activities, including deep sea fishing, snoek catching, abalone farming, oyster farming, canning of pilchards and mussel farming. The oyster farm in the lagoon of the neighbouring town of Langebaan is currently the largest in South Africa. The West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii was enjoyed by the first Portuguese navigators. By 1902 a full-blown lobster industry was in operation, canning and exporting lobster to France in particular. The West Coast lobster industry generates millions each year and employs large numbers of the local people. In the 1930s the first Redro factory was erected in Paternoster. Redro fish paste was developed by the Stephan family in an effort to compete with the already popular Peck‚Äôs Anchovette of Britain. It flew off the shelves when first released and enjoyed nearly three decades of uncompromising sole monopoly in the savoury spread market and is now owned by Pioneer Food Group. The Cape Bokkoms has been well known in this region and has been a cheap and practical source of protein for centuries. The unique method of preparing and drying fish has grown with leaps and bounds, often for export, in response to the growing demand for the product from South Africa. Climate The climate is mostly known for its infrequent rainfall, dry countryside and high offshore winds. The area receives most of its rainfall during winter and has a Mediterranean climate. The climate supports the growth of the famous wild flowers that the West Coast is renowned for. Activities in the area *The area has an array of interesting sea life and wildlife to observe. Activities include whale, dolphin, seal and penguin watching as well as bird watching with over 225 bird species in the area. *Sporting activities range from kayaking, kitesurfing, snorkelling, scuba diving, kite flying, hiking, and for the brave ‚Äì swimming in the cold West Coast water! *During spring the area is transformed into a floral paradise, with wild flowers growing everywhere forming the South-Western fringe of the famous flower carpets of Namaqualand. *Visitors can pay a visit to the Cape Columbine nature reserve. The reserve covers an area of 263 hectare along the rocky stretch of coastline. The bay, which is part of the reserve, has many picnic spots and braai facilities. *Cape Columbine light house is the last manually controlled lighthouse in South Africa. The lighthouse was built in 1936 on Castle Rock. The light cast a beam which is visible from about 50 km and is usually the first South African lighthouse seen by ships coming from Europe.

His work linked many diverse musical influences, from the Hungarian tradition of Bart√≥k and Kod√°ly, to Schoenberg and serial music, to jazz, folk song, and lighter music. Early life Seiber was born in Budapest. His mother, Berta Patay was a reputed pianist and teacher, so the young Seiber gained considerable skill with that instrument first. At the age of ten, he began to learn to play the cello. After attending grammar school, where he was regarded as \\"outstanding\\" in mathematics and Latin according to the almanacs of the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, he studied the cello and composition from 1918 to 1925, and composition with Zolt√°n Kod√°ly from 1921 to 1925. For his degree, he wrote his String Quartet No. 1 (in A minor). Career He toured Hungary with Zolt√°n Kod√°ly, collecting folk songs, and built on the research of Kod√°ly and B√©la Bart√≥k. He developed an interest in medieval plainchant. In 1925, Seiber accepted a teaching position at a private music school. In 1926, he took a position to play the cello in the orchestra of a ship from to North and South America. This was where became acquainted with jazz. In 1928 he became director of the jazz department at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, which offered the first academic jazz courses anywhere.See article and references here: Timeline of jazz education His text book Schule f√ºr Jazz-Schlagzeug was written in 1929, as a practical summary of his theoretical requirements. Two of his articles of great importance were published in the journal Melos: \\"Jazz als Erziehungsmittel\\" (1928) and \\"Jazz-Instrumente, Jazz-Klang und Neue Musik\\" (1930). After the jazz department was closed by the Nazis in 1933, Seiber left Germany. He returned to Hungary but did not settle there; he worked as a music referent in the Soviet Union for two years, but his employment was ended after that. Seiber emigrated to England in 1935 and settled in London after his marriage in Caterham. He became a British subject the same year. He taught composition and cello privately while working as a consultant for the subsidiary of Schott in London and composed film music. Michael Tippett invited him to be a professor of composition at Morley College in London, and from 1942 he was on the staff there; he became a teacher of composition, music aesthetics, and music theory. His students included Peter Racine Fricker, Don Banks, Anthony Milner, Hugh Wood, Karel Janovick√Ω, Malcolm Lipkin, John Exton, Wally Stott (who later became Angela Morley) and Barry Gray. During this period, he created and trained his choir, the Dorian Singers. His friendships and work associations embraced many soloists, including Tibor Varga, Norbert Brainin, guitarists Julian Bream and John Williams, percussionist Jimmy Blades, folk singer Bert Lloyd, and tenor Peter Pears. He was a founder member of the Society for Promotion of New Music, actively promoting new music throughout his life. He was married to ballet dancer Lilla Bauer, another Hungarian √©migr√©. In 1960 he was invited to do a lecture tour in South Africa, but he died there in Kruger National Park as the result of a car accident. Kod√°ly dedicated his choral work titled Media vita in morte sumus to the memory of his former student. Music Seiber's music is eclectic in style, showing the influences of Bart√≥k, Kod√°ly, Schoenberg, serialism, jazz, and folk song, and his output includes film and lighter music.Wood, Hugh and Cooke, Mervyn. 'Seiber, M√°ty√°s (Gy√∂rgy)' in Grove Music Online His output includes Ulysses (1947), a cantata on words by James Joyce (he recorded another Joyce-related work, Three Fragments from \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\", for Decca shortly before his death); a clarinet concertino; scores to animated films, including Animal Farm (1954); a setting of the Scottish \\"poet and tragedian\\" William McGonagall's work, The Famous Tay Whale (written for the second of Gerard Hoffnung's music festivals); three string quartets; and choral arrangements of Hungarian and Yugoslav folk songs. The Seiber Centenary: 2005 and Beyond by Julia Seiber Boyd ICSM Online Journal 09 August 2005 He also wrote one opera, Eva spielt mit Puppen (1934),Opera Glass and the ballet The Invitation. His composition for violin, Fantasia concertante was recorded by Andre Gertler. His two comic operas, A Pal√°gyi Pekek and Balaton, were composed for the Hungarian theatre in London, the \\"Londoni P√≥dium\\". A Pal√°gyi P√©kek, (libretto, Gy√∂rgy Mikes) (1943), was the first collaboration of M√°ty√°s Seiber and George Mikes. Balaton, (libretto, Gy√∂rgy Mikes) (1944), as George Mikes has reported, was aired during the war by the BBC and, after the end of the war even made it to Budapest. Seiber used a pseudonym for his jazz works and popular music: G. S. Mathis or George Mathis (a rearrangement of his name using Anglicised forms); under this name he wrote for John Dankworth. In 1956 he was awarded the inaugural Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically for \\"By the Fountains of Rome,\\" which was a hit that year in the UK Single Charts, making it to the Top Twenty.

As prices fall, a given nominal money supply will be associated with a larger real money supply, causing interest rates to fall and in turn causing investment spending on physical capital to increase. This implies that insufficient demand in the product market cannot exist forever, because insufficient demand will cause a lower price level, resulting in increased demand. There are two cases in which the Keynes effect does not occur: in the liquidity trap (when the LM curve is horizontal and thus changes in the real money supply do not affect interest rates), and when expenditure is inelastic with respect to (unresponsive to) interest rates (when the IS curve is vertical). The Patinkin-Pigou real balance effect suggests that due to wealth effects of changes in the price level upon spending itself, insufficient demand cannot persist even in the two cases in which the Keynes effect does not operate.

Gary Gygax, co-creator of Dungeons & Dragons, was an admitted fan of the Fuzzy Knights and wrote a promo for the trade-paperbacks (see below). Production The first online strip appeared on Noah's personal website on December 8, 2002. Not long after, it was given a print strip within the Knights of the Dinner Table magazine itself, starting with issue 75. The Fuzzy Knights Online strips moved to the Kenzer & Company website on April 8, 2003 with updates twice a week. The Fuzzy Knights cast and crew started production in facilities in Tokyo, Japan but in late 2004 made the move to a new studio in London, England. After a brief hiatus due to the move to London, the Fuzzy Knights kicked off a new storyline with a live action mockumentary, Fuzzy Knights 2: The L.A.R.P.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gePsfscMI7k The stand-alone story arc known as Tabletop Campaigns, finished its run on January 26, 2007 with episode 114. The original Tournament War storyline began reruns in February 2007 using a four panel per page format to save space on the servers. After an extended hiatus the L.A.R.P. storyline resumed production in the summer of 2008. Characters The main stars of the strip were four stuffed animals. Mossfoot, the adventurous green teddy bear, is leader and Game Master for the group. Violet, the violet and sometimes violent teddy bear, is Mossfoot's girlfriend. The others stars are Target, the black cat who hates LARPs (Live Action Role-Playing), and Ben Bunny, who speaks with a Scottish accent that occasionally slips into Jamaican. Collectively they call their role-playing group the Fuzzy Knights and they have had several adventures away from the gaming table. Many other living \\"fuzzies,\\" as the characters are called, inhabit the Fuzzy Knights world and most of them seem to be drawn toward role- playing games as well. The first story arc of the series involves fuzzies gathering from around the world for a HackMaster tournament that ends up turning into a war against an insane hamster toy named HamaEstra and his army of robots that appear to be arts & crafts projects made by kindergarteners. Trade paperbacks In December 2003 the Fuzzy Knights' first 22 online strips were reprinted in a trade paperback called Tails From The Table that included liner notes from the creator and bonus strips. Volume two of the series went on sale at Gen Con Indy in August 2005. Even though the strips are reproduced in a smaller size and a black & white format, they enable new readers to catch up with the backstory up to the beginning of the Tournament War. In January 2006 the first trade-paperback was reissued in PDF format. Fuzzy Knights RPG In 2005, an original role-playing game set in the Fuzzy Knights universe was produced by the series creator and went on sale as a PDF download at the Kenzer & Company website.

It is the 44th largest city of Pakistan by population. Jhelum is known for providing many soldiers to the British Army before independence, and later to the Pakistan armed forces - due to which it is also known as City of Soldiers or Land of Martyrs and Warriors. Jhelum is a few miles upstream from the site of the ancient Battle of the Hydaspes between the armies of Alexander and King Porus. A city called Bucephala was founded nearby to commemorate the death of Alexander's horse, Bucephalus. Other notable sites nearby include the 16th-century Rohtas Fort, the Tilla Jogian complex of ancient temples, and the 16th-century Grand Trunk Road which passes through the city. According to the 2017 census of Pakistan, the population of Jhelum was 190,425. The name of the city is derived from the words Jal (pure water) and Ham (snow), as the water that flows through the river originates in the Himalayas.The District Jhelum There are a number of industries in and around Jhelum city, including a tobacco factory, wood, marble, glass and flour mills. Etymology Anjum Sultan Shahbaz recorded some stories of the name Jhelum in his book Tareekh-e-Jhelum as: History=Ancient The Rajput, Gujjars, Jats and Ahirs,Arrian, Anabasis Alexandri, v. 8, 20, 29; Curtius Rufus, Historiae Alexandri Magni, viii. 12‚Äì14, ix. 1, x. 1 who now hold the Salt Range and its northern plateau respectively, appear to have been the earliest inhabitants of Jhelum. The next major point in the history of the district was the Battle of the Hydaspes between Alexander and the local ruler, . Abisares (or Abhisara; in Greek ŒëŒ≤ŒπœÉŒ±œÅŒ∑œÇ), called Embisarus (EŒº OŒ≤ŒπœÉŒ±œÅoœÇ) by Diodorus,Diodorus, Bibliotheca, xvii. 90 was an Indian people king of abhira descent beyond the river Hydaspes, whose territory lay in the mountains, sent embassies to Alexander both before and after the conquest of Porus in 326 BC, although inclined to espouse the side of the latter. Alexander not only allowed him to retain his kingdom, but increased it, and on his death appointed his son as his successor. The Gakhars appear to represent an early wave of conquerors from the west, and who still inhabit a large tract in the mountain north to tilla range. Gakhars were the dominant race during the early Muslim era and they long continued to retain their independence, both in Jhelum itself and in the neighbouring district of Rawalpindi. Medieval In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin. In 1005 he conquered the Shahis in Kabul and followed it by the conquests of Punjab region including Jhelum. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region. The Mughals were Persianized Turks who claimed descent from both Timur and Genghis Khan and strengthened the Persianate culture of Muslim India. Being very few in number,main families of Mughal Barlas, the descent of Ameer-i- Taimoor settled in Mong Rasool and afterward scattered to village chak Nazar, Shamaspur, Aima Afghana, khardiyala, Chak sikander, Malhar Muglain, Mota Garbi, Bimber, they adopted a policy of converting the local jats and Gakhars mandatory as recorded in the Baburnama. Thus it is credited to the Mughals, who were largely responsible for the conversion of the jatts to Islam.^ a b c Robert L. Canfield, Turko-Persia in historical perspective, Cambridge University Press, 1991. pg 20: \\"The Mughals ‚Äì Persianized Turks who invaded from Central Asia and claimed descent from both Timur and Genghis ‚Äì strengthened the Persianate culture of Muslim India.\\" With the collapse of the Mughal Empire after the death of Aurangzeb, the Durrani empire had occupied the plains but were quickly ousted by the Sikhs. Later periods After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikh invaded and occupied Jhelum District. In 1849 Jhelum passed with the rest of the Sikh territories to the British. In 1857 the 14th Native Infantry stationed at Jhelum town mutinied, and displayed a vigorous defence against a force sent from Rawalpindi to disarm them, but decamped for the night following the action, with the main body being subsequently arrested by the Kashmiri authorities, into whose territory they had escaped.A Sikh-era fort in Jhelum City British Raj During British rule, Jhelum was connected by the North-Western Railway to other cities in the Indian Empire, 1,367 miles from Calcutta, 1,413 from Bombay, and 849 from Karachi. The population according to the 1901 census of India was 14,951. According to the Imperial Gazetteer of India: Marble lectern in memory of 35 British soldiers During the Mutiny of 1857, 35 British soldiers of the Regular 24th Regiment of Foot were killed at the Battle of Jhelum by mutineers from the Honourable East India Companies 14th Bengal Native Infantry (roughly 500 of the soldiers mutinied with roughly 100 of the Sikh soldiers remaining loyal). Among the dead was Captain Francis Spring, the eldest son of Colonel William Spring.The London Gazette, 19 May 1858 http://www.london- gazette.co.uk/issues/22141/pages/2492/page.pdf A lectern inside St. John's Church Jhelum shows the names of those 35 soldiers. St. John's Church is located in the Jhelum Cantonment, Pakistan beside the river Jhelum. It was built in 1860 and remains a landmark in the city. It was built as a Protestant church, and was in use throughout the British period. For the past forty years it has been closed to the public and in poor condition, however it has since been renovated and reopened and is now maintained. The British soldier William Connolly won a Victoria Cross for his bravery during this battle. Mirza Dildar Baig, also known as Khaki Shah, took part in the mutiny at Jhelum and was later celebrated by Indian Nationalists. He was captured and arrested with the remaining mutineers by authorities in Kashmir and later hanged near the river Jhelum. His grave is in a shrine in Jhelum Dildarnagar, and a small town in Uttar Pradesh is also named after him. The railway bridge on the river Jhelum was built in 1873 by the British engineer William St. John Galwey. He also made the great Empress Bridge over the river Sutlej.

He was an associate of Billy the Kid and member of his gang. Early life Bowdre was born in Wilkes County, Georgia. When he was three years old, he and his parents moved to Mississippi. By 1854, young Charlie started working in his father's farm, and as he grew up became an adept farmer. Much of what Bowdre did between the year in which his last sister was born (1863) and 1874, remains a mystery. It is believed, however, that he abandoned the family's farm to become a wanderer. Records show that by 1874, he had arrived at Lincoln County, New Mexico. Bowdre became friends with Doc Scurlock during this time, and the two men opened a cheese factory on the Gila River. He also joined Scurlock on several posses during this period, pursuing cattle thieves and rustlers, on several occasions taking part in the lynching of those captured. On July 18, 1876, Bowdre, Scurlock, Frank Coe, George Coe, and Ab Saunders stormed the very weak Lincoln jail, freeing cattle rustler Jesus Largo from the custody of Sheriff Saturnino Baca, taking Largo outside of town and hanging him. No charges were ever filed for the event. On August 5, 1877, he and a companion were arrested for \\"shooting up\\" the town of Lincoln while intoxicated. Lincoln County War With the outbreak of the Lincoln County War in 1878, Bowdre sided with the Tunstall-McSween side, and he met Billy, Jose Chavez y Chavez and the rest of the Kid's associates, including Richard M. Brewer and Jim French, George Coe and Frank Coe. During the conflict, he was known to have been present with his fellow Regulators when William Morton, Frank Baker, and William McCloskey were killed along the Blackwater Creek on March 9, 1878. Bowdre was shot by Buckshot Roberts during the Gunfight of Blazer's Mills on April 4, 1878, and in turn shot Roberts. Bowdre would be charged with killing Buckshot Roberts during the Blazer's Mills Gunfight. He was also present in the July 15‚Äì19, 1878 Battle of Lincoln. After the Lincoln County War Bowdre worked as a cowboy on the ranches of Thomas Yerby and Pete Maxwell as the war went on, as well as being an active participant. Bowdre married a twenty-five-year-old Mexican woman, Manuela Herrera, some months before his death. Manuela was a sister to Doc Scurlock's wife, Mar√≠a Antonia Miguela Herrera, known as Antonia. The fact that he was recently married when he died perhaps suggests that he would have been less likely to have been involved in the gang's activities during the few weeks that passed between his marriage and his death. By December 1880, Charlie Bowdre was ready to quit riding with Billy the Kid and surrender for the murder of Buckshot Roberts, but he still joined the rest of the gang on a mission to ambush Pat Garrett in Fort Sumner. A gun battle ensued, but Bowdre and most of the Kid's gang members escaped alive. On December 23, however, the gang was holed up in a rock house at Stinking Springs, New Mexico. At dawn, Bowdre emerged to feed the horses and was riddled with rifle slugs by Garrett's posse, which had surrounded the building in the night. Later that day, Billy the Kid and his partners gave up. After being riddled with bullets he fell back into the doorway where, at the urging of Billy the Kid to \\"take a few of them with you when you die\\", Bowdre made a valiant exit. Unfortunately, he was already too weak and near death at that point and couldn't get his gun out of his holster. In the last seconds of his life he stumbled and fell towards Garrett repeating the phrase, \\"I wish...I wish...\\" His remains were returned to his wife, and he was interred next to Tom O'Folliard, another member of Billy's gang. They were joined later by Billy himself, after he was killed in July, 1881. Portrayals Charlie Bowdre was played by James Congdon in the 1958 film The Left Handed Gun, by Ron Soble in the John Wayne film Chisum, and by Charles Martin Smith in Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (1973). In the 1988 film Young Guns, he is portrayed by actor Casey Siemaszko. The circumstances of his death were the basis of a scene in Young Guns II, however, in the movie Doc Scurlock, played by Kiefer Sutherland, is the one who meets his fate outside the hut, and not Bowdre. Actor Chris Bylsma was cast as Bowdre in the film The Kid directed by Vincent D'Onofrio.

By the mid-1970s, Roberto had struck a deal with Playboy Enterprises, and was asked by his father to consult the Ministry of Justice given the military dictatorship in place had a censorship policy on the press. Minister Armando Falc√£o vetoed the publication, saying that \\"no publication under the name Playboy in Brazil, no matter its content.\\" Seeing a loophole, Roberto submitted the already done preprint for issue 1 under the name A Revista do Homem (Men's Magazine), and got approved. The first issue of Homem got on newsstands in August 1975,Ris√©rio, Manuel. \\"Playboy VS Censura: 1975 ‚Äì 1980 \\". Playboy, August 2010. and the magazine was allowed to use its trademark name only as of 1978. The Brazilian edition follows the general guidelines of the original magazine in the United States, featuring the trademark sections of the magazine, such as the monthly interview, the 20 Questions interview and the centerfold pictorial featuring the \\"Miss of the month\\", which most of the time, but not always, coincides with the month's \\"star\\" (cover). But the Brazilian installment has some sections of its own, such as Coelhinhas (Bunnies), which features unknown models photographed by freelance photographers (not affiliated with the magazine), and Click, which features candid pictures of celebrities of all calibers in seemingly revealing situations. The magazine in Brazil also makes a much heavier use of celebrities to attract its target public, especially telenovela actresses and TV hostesses. This strategy is facilitated by the Brazilian general perception of the Playboy magazine as a tasteful medium for nude pictorials, as opposed to other adult magazines published in the country. This perception also attracts young models looking to use the exposition to launch their careers. Playboy also makes extensive use of circumstantial celebrities, such as stage assistants from TV shows or women who took part recently in TV reality shows. In that aspect, the Brazilian version of the reality show Big Brother, created by Dutch production company Endemol and produced in Brazil by Globo TV, has been the main source of models for the magazine. Between May 2002 (about two months after the first season concluded on Globo) and August 2007, 13 female participants from that reality show have posed for the magazine, always on the cover; and two of them (Sabrina Sato and Antonela Avellaneda) posed twice, for a total of 15 covers on the magazine. Playboy has not, however, monopolized the nude or revealing pictorials featuring former participants of the TV show, since a few of the participants ultimately chose to appear in other adult publications, such as SEXY Magazine and the lad magazine VIP the last one, also from Abril). In a few of those cases, however, Playboy was not interested in signing on the former participants because it had been revealed that they had already posed for competing publications prior to participating in the reality show on Globo TV. The record holders for most covers are actress and former model Luma de Oliveira, and dancer Scheila Carvalho, with a total of five covers each (Luma: September 1987, March 1988, March 1990, May 2001 and January 2005; Scheila: February 1998, September 1999, November 2000, December 2001, April 2009).\\"√Ålbum de fotos - Campe√£s de capas da Playboy - Scheila Carvalho, Luma de Oliveira, Mulher Melancia - Abril.com\\" .

The resort included a 31-floor tower, inspired by the design of the Space Needle tower in Seattle. Frank Caroll, the project's original owner, purchased the property in 1961. Fremont Construction began work on the tower that September, while Caroll opened the adjacent Landmark Plaza shopping center and Landmark Apartments by the end of the year. The tower's completion was expected for early 1963, but because of a lack of financing, construction was stopped in 1962, with the resort approximately 80 percent complete. Up to 1969, the topped-off tower was the tallest building in Nevada until the completion of the International Hotel across the street. In 1966, the Central Teamsters Pension Fund provided a $5.5 million construction loan to finish the project, with ownership transferred to a group of investors that included Caroll and his wife. The Landmark's completion and opening was delayed several more times. In April 1968, Caroll withdrew his request for a gaming license after he was charged with assault and battery against the project's interior designer. The Landmark was put up for sale that month. Billionaire Howard Hughes, through Hughes Tool Company, purchased the Landmark in 1969 at a cost of $17.3 million. Hughes spent approximately $3 million to add his own touches to the resort before opening it on July 1, 1969, with 400 slot machines and 503 hotel rooms. In addition to a ground-floor casino, the resort also had a second, smaller casino on the 29th floor; it was the first high-rise casino in Nevada. Aside from the second casino, the five-story cupola dome at the top of the tower also featured restaurants, lounges, and a night club. During the 1970s, the Landmark became known for its performances by country music artists. The resort also played host to celebrities such as Danny Thomas and Frank Sinatra. However, the resort suffered financial problems after its opening and underwent several ownership changes, none of which resulted in success. The Landmark entered bankruptcy in 1985, and ultimately closed on August 8, 1990, unable to compete with new megaresorts. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority purchased the property in September 1993, and demolished the resort in November 1995, to add a 2,200-space parking lot for its convention center. In 2019, work was underway on a convention center expansion which includes the former site of the Landmark.  History  Frank Caroll, also known as Frank Caracciolo, was a building developer from Kansas City. In 1960, he and his wife Susan decided to construct a hotel-casino and shopping center in Las Vegas. Frank Caroll received a gaming license that year. In 1961, the Carolls purchased of land at the northwest corner of Convention Center Drive and Paradise Road in Paradise, Nevada, approximately half a mile east of the Las Vegas Strip and across from the Las Vegas Convention Center. Aside from a gas station, the property was vacant. Construction (1961‚Äì68)Commencement= The Landmark was initially planned as a 14-story hotel with a casino, although the floor count increased as the project progressed. Fremont Construction, owned by Louis P. Scherer of Redlands, California, began construction of the tower at the end of September 1961, under a $1.5 million contract. Frank Caroll's company, Caroll Construction Company, also worked on the tower. At the start of construction, the tower was to include 20 stories, while completion was planned for early 1963. The tower was built on a five-foot-thick base of concrete and steel, measuring 80 feet in diameter and resting on a base of caliche that descended 30 feet into the ground. Consolidated Construction Company was the concrete subcontractor for the tower. By December 1961, Caroll had opened the two-story Landmark Plaza shopping center, built out in an L-shape at the base of the tower. The Landmark Apartments, with 120 units, were also built near the tower and operational by the end of 1961. In 1962, a bar known as Shannon's Saloon and a western music radio station, KVEG, began operating in the Landmark Plaza. In addition to studios, KVEG also had its offices in the shopping center. By February 1962, the tower was planned to include 31 floors, making it the tallest building in Nevada. While plans for a separate hotel structure were being made, work began by pouring concrete on a continuous 24-hour schedule. The concrete pour was done with a slip forming method. With 21 floors expected to be added to the tower over a 12-day period, it was expected to reach the 24th floor by the end of the month. In March 1962, at the request of Caroll, Clark County Commissioners removed a restriction which specified that gaming licenses could only be issued for ground-level casinos, as Caroll wanted to open a casino on the second floor of the Landmark's shopping center. That month, Caroll received a $450,000 loan from Appliance Buyers Credit Corporation (ABCC), a subsidiary of RCA-Whirlpool. Construction had reached the 26th floor by the end of April 1962. Upon completion of the floor, work was to begin on the tower's bubble dome. By June 1962, ABCC loaned an additional $300,000 to Caroll, who reached his $3 million loan limit with the company. Caroll ultimately owed ABCC a total of $3.5 million. In August 1962, the Landmark tower was designated as a civilian fallout shelter, with the capacity to hold 3,500 people after its completion. That month, work was underway on the steel framework base for the tower's glass bubble dome. By September 1962, the Landmark tower was nearing completion and had become the tallest building in Las Vegas and the state, being visible from 20 miles away. By that time, many stores in the Landmark Plaza had closed due to falling debris that included welding sparks, steel, tools, rivets, and cement. A construction delay occurred in September 1962, when shipments of steel for the tower's dome were deemed inadequate and crews had to wait for new shipments. Construction was progressing rapidly on the tower's dome during October 1962, with steel and concrete still being added to the tower. Completion was still scheduled for early 1963. The Aluminium Division of Apex Steel Corporation Limited was contracted to install a $40,000 aluminum undershine on the tower's dome, to provide a maintenance-free and clean-looking appearance for viewers on the ground. Crews used scaffolding and hoists to reach the area where aluminum sheets needed to be placed. Each day, it took crews 18 minutes to be lifted up. Due to delays arising from strong winds, it took crews two months for the aluminium to be attached. =Delay= In December 1962, construction of the tower was stopped when ABCC denied further funding and alleged that the Carolls had defaulted on payments. The 31-story tower had been topped off and the resort was approximately 80 percent complete, with $5 million already spent on the project. The tower's planned opening was delayed until April 1963, but it did not occur as scheduled. In May 1963, ABCC was planning a sale of the apartments, shopping center, and unfinished tower for the following month. The Carolls sought to halt the sale, and filed a $2.1 million damage suit against ABCC, alleging that the company stopped construction and refused to pay the contractors. An injunction against foreclosure was granted in June 1963, but was later dissolved in August 1964. In October 1964, a sale of the tower was approved for later that month, after being requested by ABCC, which was still owed $3.5 million by Landmark Plaza Corporation. Up to that time, the tower had been appraised several times and was valued between $8 million and $9 million. Ownership subsequently changed, as did the resort's design plans. In August 1965, Maury Friedman was working on a deal with RCA Victor to convert the Landmark's tower and apartment buildings into office space. By the following month, Inter-Nation Tower, Inc. ‚Äì a Beverly Hills-based corporation ‚Äì was negotiating with RCA-Whirlpool to develop the tower and adjacent land as an international market place, an idea that was supported by local retailers and resorts. In December 1965, architect Gerald Moffitt said the Landmark's design had gone through many revisions and that his design plans had been impounded by a court; a spokesman said there were no plans to resume construction in the near future. It was estimated that an additional six months were needed to complete the tower. The unfinished tower became an eyesore for visitors to the nearby convention center. During its vacancy, people noted that the building appeared to be tilted, similar to the Leaning Tower of Pisa; experts stated that this was an illusion caused when the building was viewed with nearby power poles, which were tilted rather than the building itself. Local residents nicknamed it the \\"Leaning Tower of Plaza\\", the \\"Leaning Tower of Las Vegas\\", and \\"Frank's Folly.\\" Moffitt said, \\"It doesn't tilt. There is only three-eights of an inch difference in diameter from top to bottom.\\" In May 1966, early negotiations were being held with a prospective buyer of the Landmark. =Resumption= In July 1966, new design plans were filed with the county for the completion of the tower. Scherer planned to acquire additional property for use as a parking lot to accommodate the redesigned project. In August 1966, the Central Teamsters Pension Fund provided a $5.5 million construction loan for the project. By that time, ownership had been transferred to Plaza Tower, Inc., made up of several investors, including the Carolls and Scherer, whose construction company was awarded a $2.5 million contract to finish the Landmark tower. Because of legal problems involved with the project, the acquisition of title required over 5,000 hours of legal work and the settlement of more than 40 lawsuits. Construction was underway again in early September 1966, with completion expected in early 1967. The shops and taverns in the Landmark Plaza were closed, and the shopping center and gas station were demolished, so the land around the tower could be used to construct a casino, a hotel lobby, offices, and new shops. The adjacent Landmark apartments were to be converted into hotel rooms for the new resort. In November 1966, Caroll planned to install two slot machines inside the Landmark Coffee Shop, which sold food to construction workers from inside a temporary structure that was to become the site of a permanent building eventually. Caroll's plans were denied as his gaming license did not apply to the coffee shop. At the time, Caroll was also accused by sheriff Ralph Lamb of being uncooperative with police officers who were searching for a hoodlum at the Landmark Apartments. The Landmark had been scheduled to open on September 15, 1967, but its opening was further delayed because of construction problems. In October 1967, a new opening date of November 15 was announced, with an official grand opening to be held on December 31, 1967. In early November 1967, Scherer was awarded a $2.2 million contract for the final construction phase of the Landmark. Construction crews worked 24 hours a day for each day of the week during the final phase to have the 650-seat dinner showroom theater ready for the planned New Year's Eve opening. Also included in the final phase were clothing and jewelry shops, as well as a recreation area with swimming pools and a 20-foot waterfall. By the time of its planned New Year's Eve opening, the tower was nearly complete, with an opening now scheduled for mid-January 1968. In December 1967, two groups ‚Äì Plaza Tower Inc., the property's landlord group; and Plaza Tower Operating Corporation, the casino operating group ‚Äì submitted a request for a gaming license to the Nevada Gaming Control Board, which investigates licensees and top casino employees prior to issuing gaming licenses. The Landmark's opening did not occur as scheduled. During February and March 1968, the Landmark was declared as being completed, although it was stated the following year that some construction work remained unfinished. At the time of its stated completion in 1968, a total of 200,000 hours had been spent working on the project, which used 100,000 yards of concrete and 100 tons of steel. The tower occupied of the property, and remained as the tallest building in the state. Further developments (1968‚Äì69)Gaming license= In February 1968, an updated list of top casino employees was submitted to the gaming control board, which had up to 90 days to make a decision regarding the issuance of a gaming license. An opening date of mid-April 1968 was considered possible. In March 1968, the Nevada Gaming Control Board recommended against the issuance of a gaming license due to \\"inadequate financial capabilities and resources of the operating corporation and of its principal investor\\", referring to Caroll. However, the Nevada Gaming Commission had the Gaming Control Board reevaluate the license application. On April 5, 1968, the Las Vegas media was given a tour of the Landmark. During the event, Caroll beat the Landmark's interior designer, Leonard Edward England, for allegedly flirting with Caroll's wife. Caroll was arrested on April 17, 1968, on charges of assault and battery against England. On April 22, 1968, Caroll withdrew his request for a gaming license, a decision that was approved two days later. The company then planned to receive new financing and to eventually submit a new gaming application. Approximately 600 people were expected to be employed at the Landmark upon its opening. The Landmark was put up for sale in April 1968, and the charges against Caroll were dropped two months later on the condition that he not renew his gaming license application. =Financial problems= In May 1968, the Teamsters Pension Fund filed a notice of breach on the trust deed, alleging that Caroll, Plaza Tower Inc. and Plaza Tower Operating had been defaulting on loan payments since October 1967. In late August 1968, the Las Vegas-based Supreme Mattress Company filed a lawsuit stating that it had only received $4,250 in payments for $25,505 worth of bedding material that was sold to the Landmark in December 1967. On August 29, 1968, a joint petition was filed to declare the Landmark bankrupt. The petition was filed by Vegas Valley Electric, Inc., a plumbing contractor, and Landmark architects George Tate and Thomas Dobrusky. By that time, the Teamsters Union Pension Fund agreed to delay its foreclosure until the property was sold. Simultaneously, Sylvania Electric Company had intended to foreclose on the property because of an unpaid $3.7 million bill relating to electronic equipment installed in the Landmark. The joint petition prevented Sylvania from taking over ownership of the property. =Plane crash= On the night of August 2, 1968, 39-year-old Everett Wayne Shaw, a mechanic depressed by the break-up of his month-long marriage, stole a Cessna 180 plane as part of an apparent suicide attempt. Shaw flew the plane toward the Landmark tower and pulled up just before hitting it. The plane brushed the top of the tower before crashing into the Las Vegas Convention Center across the street, approximately away. Shaw was killed in the crash, which did not harm anyone else. Plane debris was found on the Landmark's roof and at its base, but the crash was not believed to have caused any damage to the building. =Sale negotiations and Howard Hughes= In July 1968, there were five firms interested in purchasing the Landmark, which was expected to sell for $16 million to $17 million. One of the firms, Olla Corporation, withdrew consideration of a purchase later that month, while an announcement of the resort's sale was expected within several days. Several companies made purchase offers that were ultimately rejected, including Rosco Industries Inc., based in Los Angeles. On October 12, 1968, Caroll denied a report that the Landmark would be leased to Royal Inns of America, Inc. and operated without a casino. At the time, negotiations were underway with three corporations interested in purchasing the resort. Howard Hughes, pictured in 1938, purchased the Landmark in 1969 On October 23, 1968, billionaire Howard Hughes reached an agreement to purchase the Landmark through Hughes Tool Company for $17.3 million, after previously denying reports in March 1968 that he was interested in purchasing the project. As part of the sale agreement, Hughes' Hotel Properties, Inc. would accept responsibility for approximately $8.9 million owed to the Teamster Union, as well as approximately $5.9 million in other debts and a balance of $2.4 million to Plaza Tower, Inc. At the time of the agreement, Hughes also owned five other hotel-casinos in Las Vegas. The United States Department of Justice launched an antitrust investigation into Hughes' proposed purchase, after previously investigating his attempt to purchase the Stardust Resort and Casino. As part of the investigation, the Department of Justice attempted to determine if there were other prospective buyers for the Landmark. By December 1968, negotiations were underway with several interested firms, including a $20 million offer from Tanger Industries, a holding company based in El Monte, California. =Hughes purchase and opening preparations= On January 17, 1969, the Department of Justice approved Hughes' plan to purchase the Landmark as his sixth Las Vegas resort. Later that month, a $1.5 million lawsuit was filed against Hughes Tool Company by Pennsylvania resident James U. Meiler and New York brokerage firm John R. Roake and Son, Inc. Meiler and the brokerage firm stated that they were entitled to a $500,000 brokerage fee for previously arranging a sale of the Landmark to Republic Investors Holding Company, before Hughes Tool Company agreed to purchase it. The lawsuit alleged that Hughes Tool Company \\"purposely and intentionally caused a restraining of interstate commerce\\". At the end of January 1969, Hughes spokesmen stated that some construction on the resort was never finished; that some maintenance systems had not yet been installed; and that some repairs were needed. Hughes also planned to have some of the hotel rooms refurbished. Because of the additional work, the resort was not expected to open until at least July 1, 1969. Approximately 1,000 to 1,100 people were expected to be employed at the Landmark. The Landmark was the only casino that Hughes had taken over before it was opened. As a result, Hughes was heavily involved in details regarding the project. Hughes spent approximately $3 million to give the interior a lavish design and to add other touches to the resort, while the exterior of the Landmark buildings was left unchanged. In March 1969, Hughes applied for approval to operate the Landmark's gambling operations, with a tentative opening date of July 1, 1969. Hughes planned to operate the casino through his Nevada company, Hughes Properties Inc., which was overseen by Hughes executive Edward H. Nigro. Hughes planned for the resort to include 26 table games and 401 slot machines. Hughes' purchase of the Landmark was not complete at that time, and his representatives stated that the sale would not be completed unless gambling and liquor licenses were issued by the state. In April 1969, Hughes received approval from the Gaming Control Board and from the state. Hughes planned to personally oversee planning for the Landmark's grand opening; Robert Maheu, who had worked for Hughes since the 1950s, said \\"I knew from that point on that I was in trouble. He was completely incapable of making decisions.\\" Across the street from the Landmark, Kirk Kerkorian was planning to open his International Hotel on July 2, 1969. Hughes and Maheu ‚Äì who never met each other in person due to Hughes' reclusive lifestyle ‚Äì had intense arguments about the Landmark's opening date that lasted for months. Maheu believed the Landmark should open on July 1, but Hughes did not want to commit to an exact date for various reasons. Hughes had wanted the Landmark's grand opening event to be better than Kerkorian's, but was concerned that the opening night would not go as planned. Hughes also did not want the opening date to be publicly announced too soon in the event that it should be delayed; Hughes wrote to Maheu: \\"With my reputation for unreliability in the keeping of engagements, I dont [sic] want this event announced until the date is absolutely firmly established.\\" Additionally, Hughes wrote to Maheu: \\"I would hate to see the Landmark open on the 1st of July and then watch the International open a few days later and make the Landmark opening look like small potatoes by comparison.\\" Maheu became concerned, as it was difficult to plan the grand opening without knowing the date. As the tentative opening date approached, Hughes became concerned about other events scheduled for July 1969 ‚Äì such as the Apollo 11 moon landing ‚Äì which might distract from the publicity of the Landmark's opening. By mid-June 1969, Hughes had still not given a definite opening date, which was still tentatively scheduled for July 1, although Hughes had wanted the Landmark to open sometime after the International Hotel. Weeks before the tentative opening, Hughes obsessively made repeated changes to the guest list for the resort's opening night. Regarding who should be invited, Hughes had complex specifications for Maheu to follow. Maheu ultimately had to decide the guest list himself. On June 16, 1969, Sun Realty filed a claim against Plaza Tower, Inc., thus delaying Hughes' purchase of the Landmark and threatening its planned opening. Sun Realty alleged that it was owed a $500,000 finder's fee for locating Hughes as a buyer. The case was dismissed on June 25, 1969. On June 30, 1969, Sun Realty appealed the decision but was denied that day as it was unable to post a bond that would pay the $5.8 million worth of claims filed by approximately 120 other creditors after Plaza Towers Inc. entered bankruptcy. Hughes' $17.3 million acquisition of the Landmark, through Hughes Tool Company, was completed on July 1, 1969, a day after Hughes issued checks to three different entities to complete the purchase: $2.5 million to Plaza Towers; $5.8 million to fully pay unsecured creditors; and $9 million to pay off the Teamsters Union. Opening and operation (1969‚Äì1990) The Landmark opened on the night of July 1, 1969, a day before the International Hotel. The resort was first unveiled to 480 VIP guests prior to the public opening, which was scheduled for after 9:00 p.m. Apollo 10 astronauts Thomas P. Stafford and Eugene Cernan attended the grand opening, and were the first people to enter the new resort. Other guests included Cary Grant, Dean Martin, Jimmy Webb, Phil Harris, Tony Bennett, Sammy Cahn, Steve and Eydie, and Wilt Chamberlain. Nevada governor Paul Laxalt, as well as senators Alan Bible and Howard Cannon, were also at the opening. Three members of the Los Angeles Rams were also in attendance: Jack Snow, Lamar Lundy, and Roger Brown. Local, national and international media were also present for the grand opening, which was described by the Las Vegas Sun as resembling a Hollywood premiere. A closed- circuit television camera filmed the festivities in the Landmark on opening night, with the footage being shown live to guests at Hughes' other hotels, the Sands and the Frontier. Hughes ‚Äì who lived in a secluded penthouse at his nearby Desert Inn hotel-casino ‚Äì did not attend the grand opening. For opening night, comedian Danny Thomas was the first to perform in the Landmark's theater-restaurant showroom. Hughes had earlier suggested a Rat Pack reunion or a Bob Hope-Bing Crosby reunion as the opening act, both of which were considered unlikely to happen. Television advertisements for the resort stated: \\"In France, it's the Eiffel Tower. In India, it's the Taj Mahal. In Las Vegas, it's the Landmark.\\" Dick Parker, executive vice president for the Landmark, had stated during the previous year that the International and the nearby Las Vegas Convention Center would not harm the Landmark's business. The Landmark reportedly lost $5 million in its first week of operations, and despite its close proximity to the convention center, the resort failed to make a profit during the subsequent years of its operation. In October 1969, Sun Realty filed a damages lawsuit against Hughes Tool Company and Plaza Tower, Inc, alleging that the two companies conspired to avoid paying the realty company its $500,000 finder's fee. Aside from the finder's fee, Sun Realty also sought an additional $5 million in punitive damages. In February 1971, the Nevada supreme court rejected the lawsuit, which had sought $3 million by that time. In December 1971, Hughes paid a little over $1 million to purchase of adjacent land located west of the Landmark. Hughes had previously leased the property, which he had been using as a parking lot for the resort. In January 1973, ownership of the Landmark was transferred to Hughes' Summa Corporation, formerly Hughes Tool Company. That year, the Landmark was valued at $25 million in a property appraisal. By 1974, William Bennett and William Pennington made an offer to buy the Landmark, but Hughes raised the price several times, from $15 million to $20 million; they bought the Circus Circus resort instead. In January 1976, the Landmark began offering foreign-language gaming video tapes to its German, Japanese, and Spanish hotel guests, who frequently limited themselves to playing slot machines rather than table games because of language barriers. Summa general manager E. H. Milligan said, \\"As far as we know, we are the first hotel in Las Vegas to present this service in this manner.\\" The hotel and casino briefly closed in March 1976, as part of a hotel worker strike consisting of nearly 25,000 employees, affecting 15 Las Vegas resorts. The strike lasted two weeks before ending in late March. Hughes died of kidney failure the following month. James Wadsworth, general manager for the Landmark, resigned on January 9, 1977, so he could rejoin his private law firm. Perry Lieber, a Summa employee who once served as the Landmark's general manager, was chosen to replace Wadsworth. By May 1977, Summa was financially struggling; that month, the brokerage firm of Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith recommended that Summa sell its various holdings, including the Landmark. According to the brokerage firm, the Landmark \\"has proven highly inefficient for hotel/casino operations and, in the opinion of Summa Corporation's management, does not warrant further investment.\\" =Gas leak and fire= On July 15, 1977, shortly after 4:00 a.m., a water pipe burst in the tower's subbasement, two floors below ground level. Two feet of water flooded the basement room and shorted out the main power panel, thereby cutting out electricity for the resort shortly before 5:00 a.m. An auxiliary power generator provided lighting for the resort. However, telephones, air conditioning, and four of the tower's five elevators were left non-functional because of the main power failure. Carbon monoxide, freon and methane, all originating from the auxiliary generator, infiltrated the tower through ventilation ducts, forcing an evacuation of the building. Between 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m., crews from the Southwest Gas Corporation inspected the building with firemen and found no further traces of gas, allowing guests and employees to re-enter the building. A second evacuation was ordered at 2:30 p.m. after another power failure, which rendered the elevators inoperable once again. During the outage, 21 table games remained open with the use of emergency lights, while a bar gave away free drinks. Power was restored at 6:45 p.m., although telephones remained inoperable. Guests were given the option to stay at one of Summa's other hotel properties. Despite the incident, hotel executives stated that the resort maintained 95-percent occupancy. An investigation into the cause of the gas leaks could not begin that day due to the presence of fumes in the basement. During the incident, a news reporter and a cameraman for the local KLAS-TV news channel ‚Äì also owned by Summa ‚Äì were beaten and forced out of the hotel lobby by Landmark guards who were armed with clubs and flashlights. Damaged in the altercation was the recording unit for a $37,000 camera owned by KLAS. Other local news crews were allowed to stay at the property to cover the incident. Orders to remove KLAS were given to the guards by hotel management, which had been irritated by recent KLAS news stories that related to Summa's properties, including a story stating that negotiations were underway to sell the Landmark to an Arabian investor. A total of 138 people were hospitalized after inhaling the poisonous gases; they were treated at four local hospitals. Among the hospitalized were nearly 100 hotel guests, and several firemen and ambulance drivers; most of the patients were released from the hospitals within three days of the incident. A 55-year-old man was the sole casualty in the incident. An investigation into the cause of the gas leaks concluded on July 19, 1977, and found that a defective exhaust line on one of the emergency generators was responsible. The line had been installed during the hotel's construction. John Pisciotta, director of the Clark County Building Department, did not believe that he or anyone else would be able to determine how the line became damaged. Summa brought in the company which installed the system to have it repaired. On October 23, 1977, at 3:44 p.m., a two-alarm fire was reported in a hotel room on the 22nd floor, after a bartender in the 27th floor lounge smelled smoke. The entire room had caught on fire from a cigarette. The fire was extinguished with help from 45 firefighters, who put it out within five minutes of their arrival. However, the fire led to heavy smoke infiltrating the entire hotel and ground-floor through elevator shafts. The entire hotel was evacuated, and hundreds of guests and employees were allowed to return inside at approximately 5:15 p.m., after smoke had been cleared from the resort's interior. The 22nd through 27th floors had moderate smoke damage. Five hotel guests were treated for smoke inhalation, but none required hospitalization. =Prospective buyers= During October 1977, Summa was in negotiations with several prospective buyers for the Landmark, which had approximately 1,200 employees at the time. One interested buyer was a group of Chicago investors led by an attorney. Summa was also in negotiations to sell the Landmark for $12 million to Nick Lardakis, a tavern owner who lived in Akron, Ohio. Simultaneously, Summa was holding discussions with the Scott Corporation ‚Äì a group of downtown Las Vegas entrepreneurs led by Frank Scott ‚Äì which wanted to purchase the resort at a price of nearly $10 million. Lardakis' acquisition of the Landmark was rejected that month as he was unable to raise the necessary funds to make the purchase; according to Summa, Lardakis' terms were \\"unrealistic.\\" The Chicago group made a $12 million offer, but Summa's board of directors favored the offer by Scott Corporation, which had no down payment and included a 20-year payout period, while the Chicago group was opposed to a long-term mortgage arrangement with Summa. The Chicago group noted that Summa officials repeatedly declined to let the group examine the Landmark's 1973 property appraisal. Other $12 million offers came from Las Vegas heiress JoAnn Seigal and Beverly Hills management consultant Charles Fink. Seigal also complained that Summa would not provide her with a property appraisal to base her negotiations. The Beverly Hills-based Acro Management Consultants offered $16 million for the Landmark, the highest of five bids up to that time. Summa spokesman Fred Lewis said that Acro's bid was considered \\"more of an inquiry\\" than a serious offer, a belief that was disputed by Leonard Gale, vice president of Acro. Gale acknowledged that the Landmark was \\"the biggest lemon in Las Vegas\\", but was confident it could become a successful property under Acro's ownership. After weeks of negotiations, Summa announced that no decision had been made on a sale of the Landmark, reportedly due to disagreements within the company. William Lummis, a cousin of Hughes, had been named chairman of the Summa board earlier in the year. Lummis wanted to sell all of Summa's non-profitable properties, while chief operating officer Frank William Gay, citing the purported desires of Hughes, wanted to expand and modernize such properties. The Landmark was considered the weakest of Summa's six gaming and hotel properties in Nevada, as it had never made a profit up to that time. Summa officials held a meeting on November 3, 1977, but the company made no decision on selling the Landmark, which lost an average of $500,000 per month. By that time, the Scott Corporation stated that it would likely withdraw its offer to purchase the Landmark because of inability to obtain long-term financing. In December 1977, it was stated that if the Landmark remained a Summa property, then the company would add six outdoor tennis courts to the resort, as well as 10 indoor courts that would be usable by all Summa hotel guests in the Las Vegas area. In January 1978, Summa announced that the Landmark would be sold to the Scott Corporation, with the sale price reportedly ranging between $10 million and $12 million. Up to that time, the resort had reportedly lost $15 million since its opening, despite numerous attempts to increase business. Experts believed that the Landmark suffered financially as a result of its low room-count (486 guest rooms at the time) and its location across the street from the Las Vegas Hilton (formerly the International), which was the world's largest hotel at the time. Frank Scott owned downtown Las Vegas' Union Plaza Hotel, which had become one of the city's most successful casinos, and he said the same management principles used at the Union Plaza would be applied to the Landmark. Scott intended to change the name of the resort, with \\"The Plaza Tower\\" as the favorite among several names under consideration at that time. Scott planned to take over operations once the sale received approval from Summa, county and state gaming officials, and courts that were handling Hughes' estate. Because higher offers were subsequently made for the Landmark, the Scott Corporation's offer was rejected by a judge who was monitoring the Hughes estate. =Wolfram/Tickel ownership= A group of midwestern investors ‚Äì led by Lou Tickel and Zula Wolfram, and including Gary Yelverton ‚Äì purchased the Landmark from the Summa Corporation in February 1978, at a cost of $12.5 million. The purchase was financed using money that Wolfram's husband, Ed Wolfram, embezzled from his brokerage firm, Bell & Beckwith. Faye Todd, the Landmark's Entertainment Director and a Corporate Executive Assistant, primarily oversaw the Landmark's operations for the Wolframs, who lived in Ohio. The Wolframs were high rollers who frequently stayed at the Desert Inn resort when visiting Las Vegas. Todd met the Wolframs while working for the Desert Inn as Special Events Coordinator, and she became close friends with Zula Wolfram, who had been planning to purchase a Las Vegas hotel with her husband. Tickel, a former magistrate judge and a resident of Salina, Kansas, previously owned several other hotels. The group was confident that the Landmark would overcome its financial problems, and they planned to add a 750-room hotel tower to the property within two years. The sale was completed on March 31, 1978, under the new ownership of Zula Wofram, and Lou and Jo Ann Tickel. However, the new owners were unable to find someone with a gaming license and sufficient funds to continue operating the casino ahead of the sale's completion. The investment group had yet to apply for gaming and liquor licenses, and the Summa Corporation declined to continue operating the casino, citing a lack of interest. The Landmark's casino, which had 272 employees, was closed on April 1, 1978, due to the lack of gaming licenses. The owners began a search for a suitable licensed individual who could temporarily operate the casino until they could receive their own gaming license. The hotel, restaurants, and shops remained open, with 700 other employees. The casino reopened on June 2, 1978, after a one-year gaming license had been granted to Frank Modica, a Las Vegas gaming figure who would temporarily operate the casino on the owners' behalf. The casino's bingo parlor remained closed as it was undergoing renovations. In October 1978, Tickel, Wolfram, and Yelverton were approved by the Nevada Gaming Control Board and the Nevada Gaming Commission to be licensed as the landlords of the Landmark. At the time, Ed Wolfram was listed as a financial adviser on the licensing plan. As of April 1979, Jesse Jackson Jr. was the Landmark hotel manager, and was the only such manager in the Las Vegas hotel industry to be black. Gary Baldwin, a former investigator for the Nevada Gaming Control Board, was the Landmark's general manager and casino manager as of July 1979. That month, the gaming control board recommended that Baldwin be approved in his request to receive five- percent of pretax operating profits from the Landmark. The Tickels remained as co-owners of the Landmark until 1980, following Wolfram's approval to purchase their interest in the resort. In 1982, architect Martin Stern Jr. was hired to design a large expansion of the Landmark. Revenue for the Landmark exceeded $26 million that year, although the resort lost $500,000 during the month of November 1982. Up to that time, the Landmark had lost an average of $3 million every year since its opening. Federal investigators shut down Wolfram's firm on February 7, 1983, after they discovered $36 million of money missing in six accounts that were managed by him and his wife, ultimately leading to the discovery of his embezzlement. Lawyer Patrick McGraw, trustee for Bell & Beckwith, was approved later that month to operate the Landmark until it could be liquidated. The expansion designed by Stern was cancelled, and Ed Wolfram was convicted of embezzling later that year, after admitting to using money from his firm to pay for various businesses ventures, with the Landmark being the most expensive. Zula Wolfram, who had owed $5 million to Summa since her purchase of the Landmark, was forced to sell her majority share in the resort. =Morris ownership= The Landmark was entangled in a Toledo bankruptcy court in July 1983, at which point Bill Morris, a Las Vegas lawyer, made plans to purchase the resort. Morris, also a member of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA), had previously owned the Holiday Inn Center Strip hotel-casino, as well as the Riverside Resort in nearby Laughlin. Morris had also previously represented Plaza Tower, Inc. at the time that Hughes completed his purchase of the resort. Morris intended to eventually expand the resort to 1,100 hotel rooms. Yelverton and his wife stated that they had been sold a five-percent interest in the Landmark in 1979, but that the document was never filed with the county recorder's office. In August 1983, the Yelvertons filed a state suit to prevent the sale to Morris, stating that they would not be compensated for their interest if the sale proceeded. At the time, Gary Yelverton was the Landmark's casino manager. The Nevada Gaming Control Board delayed approval of Morris' purchase until his offer could be updated to include what Zula Wolfram owed to Summa. Morris purchased the Landmark for $18.7 million, and took over ownership on October 30, 1983. The struggling resort had a profitable month in November 1983 under its new management. Morris worked 18 hours a day to ensure the Landmark's success. He said the Landmark had \\"never really been given a fair chance,\\" citing the absence of \\"on-hands management on a day-in, day-out basis\\" as one reason for its lack of success. Morris also believed that previous operators tried to make the Landmark \\"do something it was not meant to do\\" by competing with \\"superstar productions,\\" whereas he believed the resort's location made it more ideal for serving attendees of the Las Vegas Convention Center. The Landmark remained open while Morris spent nearly $3.5 million on a renovation, which was underway in late 1983. Morris said the Landmark would compete against rivals with its \\"budget prices and good service.\\" He intended to capitalize on the resort's location with a planned expansion that would feature three 15-story towers with 1,500 hotel rooms, accompanied by a large domed family entertainment center. The expansion was to be built west of the Landmark on of vacant land that Morris had purchased along with the resort. The expansion did not occur, and the Landmark struggled throughout the 1980s. By the middle of 1985, Morris was negotiating a $28 million loan to pay for improvements and fire safety updates for the Landmark. Clark County officials considered taking action against the resort because of its failed compliance with fire safety standards. On July 29, 1985, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a $2.1 million lien against the property, because of Morris' failure to pay withholding and payroll taxes for the resort's employees for the previous six months. Two days after the lien was filed, the Landmark filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to prevent the IRS from seizing assets such as casino cage money. The resort remained open despite the bankruptcy filing, and the casino had enough money to remain operational. The Landmark had debts totaling $30.6 million, while it had $30.6 million in assets. Morris blamed the bankruptcy on McGraw, alleging that he derailed a $28.8 million refinancing of the Landmark 24 hours prior to the finalization of the loan. Morris said operations would continue as normal despite the bankruptcy filing. The Nevada National Bank requested in early 1986 that the bankruptcy be converted to a liquidation proceeding to pay off creditors, stating that the Landmark's bankruptcy reorganization plan could not succeed. Morris said he would have to cancel his reorganization plan and lay off 700 to 800 Landmark employees if a bankruptcy court did not allow the resort to abandon its union labor contracts. Part of Morris' reorganization plan involved cutting employee wages by 15 percent, including his own yearly salary of $145,000. The pay cut would give the Landmark an additional $6,500 per month, which would allow the resort to make its mortgage payments. Morris hoped to increase the hotel's room count after the resort's eventual emergence from bankruptcy, with additional financing from a national franchise hotel chain. He hoped that the Landmark would be out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy by March 1, 1986, although it would ultimately remain in bankruptcy for the rest of its operation. In January 1987, a small fire broke out in the resort's showroom, located next to the casino. Five employees were evacuated, and there were no injuries. Customers in the casino were unaware of the fire, which was quickly extinguished by the local fire department. The fire was determined to have likely been caused by an arsonist. In July 1987, the Landmark began offering poker tournaments in its Nightcap Lounge each weekday night. To help bring in customers, two cash drawings were held during each tournament. Morris and bank company Drexel Burnham Lambert began a search in 1989 for a new owner to take over the Landmark. At the end of the year, a U.S. bankruptcy court judge gave Morris until 1990 to find a buyer or refinancing. Otherwise, the Landmark would be liquidated to pay off creditors, in accordance with a court order. On January 2, 1990, the Landmark was ordered into Chapter 7 bankruptcy after a judge ruled that the creditors would not be able to receive compensation under the reorganization plan. Between $43 million and $46 million was owed to various creditors. Morris' gaming license expired that month after the resort failed to pay $500,000 in taxes and penalties. Richard Davis, a Las Vegas- based real estate agent, was appointed by the bankruptcy court that month to temporarily operate the resort. On February 21, 1990, the Nevada Gaming Commission extended the gaming license and allowed the resort to stay open for at least two additional weeks while its financial problems were analyzed by state experts. At that time, the hotel had $562,000 in cash, including $175,000 in revenue that had accumulated in the prior six weeks. The Landmark continued to struggle, although the introduction of various casino programs helped improve revenue. A U.S. bankruptcy court judge approved a request for the Landmark to be sold seven weeks later in a public auction scheduled for August 6, 1990. The request was made by Davis, who cited numerous failed attempts to sell the resort. More than 200 prospective buyers had inquired about the Landmark, but only five to ten of them were considered as having serious interest in the resort. In July 1990, two Denver businessmen, David M. Droubay and Martin Heckmaster, offered $35.5 million to purchase the bankrupt resort. Morris was dissatisfied with the offer, stating that the property had been appraised as high as $70 million. Closure (1990‚Äì95) On August 6, 1990, the bankruptcy hearing failed to attract a buyer for the Landmark. Ralph Engelstad and Charles Frias, who both held substantial interest in the resort, had made $100,000 deposits which allowed them to bid at the hearing, but they did not do so and left the hearing without commenting. Droubay and Heckmaster were ineligible to bid as they did not make a deposit. At the request of Davis' attorney, a U.S. bankruptcy judge granted permission to close the Landmark. Gaming operations began shutting down that afternoon, within an hour of the failed hearing. Slot machine and hotel operations were scheduled to shut down later in the week. With 498 rooms at the time, the Landmark was unable to compete with new megaresorts, and was fully closed on August 8, 1990. Morris, upset about the failed auction, said, \\"Sometimes it comes down to good luck and bad luck. I had nothing but bad luck. Someone is going to come in and run the Landmark and look like a genius.\\" Forrest Woodward, who managed the casino for Davis, said, \\"This is just an obsolete gaming property that no one's interested in, considering the debt,\\" which included $48 million; a portion of that was $10 million in unsecured claims. Davis' attorney predicted the Landmark would be closed for 100 days or more while creditors pursued a foreclosure sale. A week after the closure, Davis received permission from the U.S. bankruptcy court to abandon the property as trustee, due to the cost of maintaining security at the closed resort. Davis' attorney said it would cost between $60,000 and $200,000 each month to maintain the property. Creditors would be left to pay bills relating to the property until a foreclosure sale could take place. In December 1990, the property was purchased through a foreclosure sale by Lloyds Bank of London for $20 million. Lloyds Bank made the purchase in order to protect a $25 million loan it had made to Morris in 1988. By March 1993, the Landmark's contents had been liquidated through a sale conducted by National Content Liquidators. By July 1993, representatives of Lloyds Bank had approached the LVCVA about the possibility of purchasing the Landmark. LVCVA was interested in the proposal, with plans to use the Landmark's 21-acre property either for a parking lot or expansion. LVCVA purchased the Landmark in September 1993, at a cost of $15.1 million. During 1994, board members of LVCVA debated on whether to restore the Landmark or demolish it. It was ultimately decided that the Landmark would be demolished, after only three LVCVA board members voted to save the building. Among those voting in support was Lorraine Hunt, who later said that the Landmark \\"was iconic and part of the history of Las Vegas. Had they kept it, it could have been the office for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.\\" =Demolition= LVCVA paid $800,000 for asbestos removal in the tower. Central Environmental Inc. was hired to remove the asbestos, while AB- Haz Environmental, Inc. was the asbestos removal consultant. In mid-1994, AB- Haz Environmental began removing asbestos insulation from the Landmark. The removal, scheduled for completion in August 1994, took nearly six months. In October 1994, it was announced that the Landmark would be demolished the following month to make way for a 21-acre parking lot, to be used by the Las Vegas Convention Center. Demolition of the tower was delayed until December 1994, before being delayed again to January 1995, to allow for the removal of additional asbestos. By that time, the Clark County Health District had proposed penalties against the asbestos companies. By February 1995, AB-Haz had twice declared the Landmark to be asbestos-free and safe for demolition, although Clark County officials discovered that some hotel floors still contained 90 percent of the asbestos. Up to that time, LVCVA had already paid a total of $1 million to the asbestos companies to have the asbestos removed from the hotel and an adjacent apartment complex, allowing for their demolition. The Clark County Air Pollution Control Division recommended a $450,000 fine against AB-Haz for failure to remove the asbestos, while LVCVA would have to spend an additional $1 million for further asbestos removal. AB- Haz was ultimately cited for violating air emission standards during the asbestos removal, and signed a settlement in which the company agreed to pay an $18,000 fine. Central Environmental was removing asbestos from the tower as of August 1995. Because of previous delays, officials for LVCVA had given up on setting a demolition date until all the asbestos was removed. In October 1995, LVCVA paid Iconco Inc. $740,000 to remove remaining asbestos from the resort, hoping to have it demolished in time for ConExpo to be held on the property's new parking lot in March 1996. Controlled Demolition, Inc. (CDI) was hired to implode the tower. No blueprints could be found for the tower, which CDI president Mark Loizeaux considered unusual. Demolition crews discovered secret stairwells in the tower, and Loizeaux said, \\"We have learned everything as we have gone in. It was a very strange structure, very unique.\\" A week before the Landmark tower was demolished, crews removed the remaining asbestos from the low-rise structures and subsequently tore them down. Crews then spent the final days of demolition by drilling in the tower to weaken and prepare it ahead of its planned implosion. Less than 100 pounds of dynamite was placed in certain locations throughout the tower's first four floors. A restored Landmark sign, located on the property of the former resort (2013) At 5:37 a.m. on November 7, 1995, the Landmark tower was demolished through implosion. An estimated 7,000 people arrived to witness the implosion. Upon detonation, the tower's northwest half was brought down, followed by the second half, which caved in on itself, followed by a black cloud of dust ascending 150 feet into the air. Most of the material from the demolished structure was to be recycled and used in other construction projects. The 31-story tower was the tallest reinforced concrete building ever demolished in North America, and the second tallest building in the world to be demolished. Demolition and related expenses cost $3 million. Frank Wright, curator of the Nevada State Museum and Historical Society, said \\"I kind of hate to see it come down,\\" stating that the Landmark tower still represented what the then- upcoming Stratosphere tower represented: \\"the biggest and the tallest.\\" The property was to become occupied by 2,200 parking spaces, expected to be ready by March 1996. One of the Landmark's ground-level signs, with gold and blue cursive neon lettering, was restored by the Neon Museum and installed at the parking lot. As of 2017, the property contains 2,948 parking spaces for the Las Vegas Convention Center. In 2019, work was underway on an expansion of the convention center. It will be built on the former sites of the Landmark and the nearby Riviera. Architecture The Landmark's design was inspired by Seattle's Space Needle tower The Landmark tower was designed by architects Gerald Moffitt and Ed Hendricks. The uniquely designed Landmark tower was the first of its kind to be built in Nevada; its design was inspired by the Space Needle located in Seattle, Washington. When construction stopped in 1962, the project consisted of of floor space, and included two basements that were 30 feet deep. The tower's height measured 297 feet, while its diameter measured 60 feet. The tower's dome measured 141 feet in diameter. In 1966 ‚Äì the year that construction resumed ‚Äì architects George Tate and Thomas Dobrusky were hired to design new portions of the resort, including the ground-floor casino. Height The Landmark tower was billed as having 31 floors, although it skipped floors 13 and 28. The Landmark tower was the tallest building in the state from 1962 to 1969. In 1967, a revolving letter \\"L\\" neon sign was installed at the top of the tower. Excluding its rooftop sign, the tower stood , seven feet taller than the Mint hotel in downtown Las Vegas. Conflicting numbers have been given for the tower's total height. According to Scherer, the sign measured , and the tower measured , including the sign. At the time of opening, the Landmark tower was billed as having a height of . By that time, the new 30-story International Hotel had become the tallest building in the state at . When it was demolished, the tower reportedly stood . According to Emporis, the tower stood from the ground to its roof, while the tip raised the height to a total of . Features When the Landmark opened, it had a total of 400 slot machines. The ground-floor casino was , while a second casino, consisting of , was located in the dome on the 29th floor; it was the first high-rise casino in the state. At the time of opening, the ground-floor casino featured red and black colors, while the upper casino used orange coloring and wood. The hotel contained 476 rooms and 27 suites for a total of 503, a small number in comparison to other Las Vegas resorts, which commonly had 1,000 rooms. The tower included 157 hotel rooms, while the remaining units were located on ground level. The tower used an octagonal floorplan, and the rooms in the tower used a layout that had them shaped like pie slices. By 1977, the room count had increased to 524, before ultimately being lowered to 498 at the time of the Landmark's closure in 1990. The Landmark's interior designer was Las Vegas resident Leonard Edward England, who designed the ground floor to include a colorful and primitive Incan theme, which gradually changed to a Space Age theme on subsequent floors. The interior included $200,000 light fixtures, glowing, red-colored Incan masks, and a burnished metal wall sculpture representing a Cape Kennedy launch. The interior also included 65 tons of black and white polished marble, and carved mahogany woodwork from Mexico. In addition, the interior featured murals depicting the eight Wonders of the World, which included the Landmark tower. After Hughes agreed to purchase the resort, he had an island built in the middle of the hotel's 240-foot swimming pool, which cost $200,000 and was the longest in the world. The Landmark's pool included waterfalls and three carpeted bridges leading to its center island, which featured palm trees. For the hotel, Hughes replaced 72-inch beds with 80-inch beds and had color televisions built into the walls of each room ahead of the resort's opening. The Landmark's second floor was used for offices. The tower's dome included five floors, although floors 26 and 30 were used by employees for maintenance equipment, elevator equipment, and dressing rooms. The shape and strength of the tower's bubble dome was maintained by perlite concrete and steel girders. The Landmark included a high-speed exterior glass elevator ‚Äì located on the tower's west side and facing the Las Vegas Strip ‚Äì which took people up to the five-story cupola dome. Elevator Services was hired to install the Landmark's exterior elevator, capable of moving 1,000 feet per minute, allowing people to go from the ground floor to the 31st floor in 20 seconds. It was the fastest elevator in the Western United States. Hughes biographer Michael Drosnin stated that the elevator was prone to constant malfunctions, and that the Landmark's air- conditioning system \\"never really worked.\\" The dome provided wraparound views of the city, and was capable of holding over 2,000 people. The dome included lounges and a night club, as well as the high-rise casino on the 29th floor. At the time of the Landmark's opening, the showroom and the Cascade Terrace coffee shop were located on the first floor, while a steak and seafood gourmet restaurant known as Towers Restaurant was located on the 27th floor and a Chinese restaurant known as the Mandarin Room was located on the 29th floor. A 1995 photo of the tower, modified to depict its operational appearance in the 1980s In April 1971, plans were announced for a $750,000 expansion that would include luxury suites on the 29th floor, the highest in Las Vegas at the time. Also planned was the remodeling of the casino and lobby, and the expansion of a coffee shop. The Skytop Rendezvous, a piano bar and dance floor on the top floor of the tower, was reopened as a discotheque on February 3, 1975, specializing in middle of the road music. The Landmark was the only major hotel in the state to have a discotheque. When Morris' renovation began in December 1983, the tower contained 150 rooms, a number that was expected to be reduced as the rooms would be enlarged and upgraded to first class standards. Other plans included changes to the coffee shop, new casino carpeting, and redesigning and renaming the 27th-floor restaurant as Anthony's Seafood and Prime Rib Room. The renovation was financed by Valley Bank of Nevada. The Love Song Lounge operated on the top floor during the mid-1980s, before and after Morris' renovation, and offered dancing. During 1985 through 1987, the resort also operated the Sunset Room on the 27th floor, offering piano-bar music and fine dining, with an emphasis on steaks and seafood. The Poolside Room operated on the ground level. The Nightcap Lounge opened at the Landmark in 1986, and offered comedy acts. Reception In 1962, the Los Angeles Times called the $6 million project, \\"By far the most spectacular project\\", out of several Las Vegas resorts that were under construction; the newspaper further wrote that the Landmark was \\"destined to become the Mark Hopkins of Las Vegas.\\" The following year, the Reno Evening Gazette opined that the Landmark had \\"the most unusual exterior architecture in Nevada.\\" In 1966, Billboard wrote that the mushroom-shaped Landmark tower had \\"the most spectacular design\\" of all recent high-rise structures in the city. In 1993, architecture critic Alan Hess noted the simplicity of the Landmark and the nearby International Hotel when compared with previous Las Vegas casinos, writing, \\"As singular, self-contained forms, they showed none of the complexity of the different pieces and sequential additions that made the original Strip visually and urbanistically richer.\\" In 2002, Geoff Carter of Las Vegas Weekly wrote that the demolished Landmark was \\"Vegas' coolest building and a veritable shrine to 1960s 'Googie' architecture.\\" Performances Peggy Lee performed at the Landmark during the year of its opening. In its early years, the Landmark became well known for its performances by country singers, including Kay Starr, Jimmy Dean, Patti Page, Bobbie Gentry, and Danny Davis with his Nashville Brass band, as well as a four-week show starring Ferlin Husky and Archie Campbell. Frank Sinatra also performed at the Landmark, and Bobby Darin made one of his final appearances there. In 1974, the Landmark launched Red McIlvaine's Star Search, a variety show featuring people from across the United States. The following year, The Jim Halsey Company began Country Music USA, a show at the Landmark that featured a different country music headliner every two to three weeks. The show was usually sold out. Roy Clark and Mel Tillis made their debuts in Country Music USA, as did Freddy Fender. The Oak Ridge Boys made their Las Vegas debut in Country Music USA. Leroy Van Dyke performed in the show, with Fender as his opening act. Van Dyke performed again at the Landmark later in the 1970s, with Sons of the Pioneers as his opening act. Other artists who performed in Country Music USA included Barbara Fairchild, Johnny Paycheck and Tommy Overstreet, as well as Jody Miller, Roy Head, and Hank Thompson. Country Music USA ran for two years, until 1977. Spellcaster, an 80-minute family oriented show featuring country- western singer Roy Clayborne, debuted at the Landmark in 1982. Spellcaster, a production show with dancers and showgirls, featured Clayborne singing 15 songs. Spellcaster was named after one of the Wolframs' racing horses, and was produced through Zula Wolfram's Las Vegas production company, Zula Productions. The show was designed and directed by Larry Hart, a 1979 Grammy Award winner, and it ran for approximately eight months. At the time of Spellcaster's debut, Danny Hein and Terri Dancer also began performing in the resort's Galaxy Lounge. Hein and Dancer had four different shows consisting of various costumes and set decorations, and were accompanied by a five-person band of musicians who backed up the duo. In the late 1980s, the Landmark's showroom hosted minor acts and was considered small in comparison to other Las Vegas resorts. The Landmark hosted magician Melinda Saxe in a family-friendly magic show, initially known as '88 Follies Revue and renamed Follies Revue '89 the following year before concluding its run. In 1990, the main showroom featured Spellbound, a magic show consisting of two illusionist teams. Dick Foster was the show's director and producer. In popular culture  The unfinished tower briefly appears in the 1964 film, Viva Las Vegas. In 1971, Sean Connery and stuntmen rode atop the Landmark's exterior elevator as part of filming for scenes in the James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever; the tower was among other Las Vegas resorts that stood in as the fictional Whyte House hotel-casino. In the 1980s, the Landmark appeared in the television series Vega$ and Crime Story. In October 1994, the exterior entrance of the Landmark was lit up for one night so it could be used for outdoor shots as the fictional Tangiers casino, featured in the 1995 film, Casino. The Landmark's implosion was filmed for use in director Tim Burton's 1996 film, Mars Attacks!. In the film, the Landmark is portrayed as the fictional Galaxy Hotel, which is destroyed by an alien spaceship. Burton had stayed at the hotel a few times and was upset by the decision to demolish it, so he wanted to immortalize it in his film. A scale model of the Landmark tower was also made for the production of Mars Attacks!. The demolition of the Landmark also appears during the closing credits of the 2003 film, The Cooler. The Lucky 38, a fictional tower casino featured in the 2010 video game Fallout: New Vegas, partially resembles the Landmark.

It features cameos from noted basketball figures Bob Knight, Rick Pitino, Nolan Richardson, Bob Cousy, Larry Bird, Jerry Tarkanian, Matt Painter, Allan Houston, Dick Vitale, Jim Boeheim, Dan Dakich and Bobby Hurley, as well as actor Louis Gossett, Jr. Plot Pete Bell, a college basketball coach for the Western University Dolphins in Los Angeles, is under a lot of pressure. His team isn't winning as often as it once did and his successful program needs to attract new star players and fast. But the brightest stars of the future‚Äîthe so-called \\"blue-chip\\" prospects‚Äîare secretly being paid by other schools. This practice is forbidden in the college game, but Pete is desperate after a losing season. A school booster, greedy \\"friend of the program\\" Happy, will stop at nothing to land these star high school players for Western's next season and gets the okay from the coach to do so. This includes giving a new car to the gigantic Neon Boudeaux, a house and job to the mother of Butch McRae and a tractor to the father of farmboy Ricky Roe, as well as a bag filled with cash. With sportswriter Ed suspecting a scandal, Pete continues to be contaminated by selfish demands from the players and a dirty association with the booster. His estranged wife, a former guidance counselor, agrees to tutor Neon, who has below average grades, but she feels betrayed when Pete lies to her about the new athletes receiving illegal inducements to attend the school. Pete comes to realize that one of his senior players, Tony, a personal favorite, had \\"shaved points\\" in a game his freshman season, conspiring to beat a gambling point spread after carefully reviewing a video of the freshman season game depicting Tony's unusual behavior. Pete is disgusted at what he and his program have become. Western University has a big nationally televised game coming up versus Indiana, the #1 team in the country, coached by Bob Knight. After winning the game, Pete cannot bear the guilt of having cheated. At a press conference, he confesses to the entire scandal and resigns as head coach. Leaving the press conference and the arena, Pete walks past a small playground with kids playing basketball‚Äîhe approaches, then helps coaching them. An epilogue later reveals that the university would be suspended from tournament play for three years. Pete did continue to coach, but at the high school level; Tony graduated and played pro ball in Europe; Ricky Roe got injured and returned home to run the family farm, and Neon and Butch dropped out of college, but both now play in the NBA.

Nolte actually shadowed Bob Knight during many games in 1992 to research the role. Knight appears in the film as himself but has no scripted lines. French Lick is the hometown of Larry Bird, who plays a scene with Nolte at the outdoor court of Bird's home. This was actually the same court (located on the property that Bird had purchased in the early 1980s) that was used in a Converse television commercial in 1984 starring Bird and Magic Johnson. In a scene showing Nolte driving to French Lick, local radio station WSLM 98.9 FM can be heard in the car. In the final version, this scene was edited out. Blue Chips features several famous players and coaches playing themselves, Jerry Tarkanian, Rick Pitino, Matt Painter, and Jim Boeheim among them. Legendary Boston Celtics point guard and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame member Bob Cousy has a role as the athletic director of the college where Pete Bell is coach. Blue Chips was Friedkin's first film for Paramount Pictures since 1977's Sorcerer, the production of which had strained his relationship with the studio for years. His next three films would also be released by Paramount. Some attributed this to his relationship with the head of Paramount Sherry Lansing.Friedkin p.409 Reception The film earned mixed reviews from critics. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post panned the film, writing, \\"The ostensible subject here is the big business of college athletics, and, just as The Program tried to do with college football, the film's purpose is to expose the corruption behind the scenes of so-called amateur athletics that have transformed the sport into a desperate money grab. But, like The Program, this strident, unconvincing bit of movie muckraking uses our national sports mania to decoy us into sitting through a dreary lecture about ethics and moral corner-cutting. What's most surprising here is that the assembled talent‚Äîfrom the worlds of basketball and movies‚Äîis so impressive and, still, the work is so tired. As the coach who exchanges his soul for a winning program, Nick Nolte struts and bellows in a desperate attempt to bring his character to life, and though he works up quite a lather, all he gets for the effort is sweat stains.\\" Blue Chips currently holds a 37% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 27 reviews. Shaquille O'Neal was nominated for a Razzie Award for \\"Worst New Star\\". The film ranked #6 on Complex Magazine's Best Basketball Movies list. Box office The film debuted at No. 3. Friedkin later admitted the film was \\"weak at the box office. It's hard to capture in a sports film the excitement of a real game, with its own unpredictable dramatic structure and suspense. I couldn't overcome that.\\"Friedkin p.412  Year-end lists  *Dishonorable mention ‚Äì Glenn Lovell, San Jose Mercury News References *Friedkin, William, The Friedkin Connection, Harper Collins 2013 *http://www.nwitimes.com/sports/basketball/college/indiana- university/chesterton-s-nover-plays-the-chips-that-were-dealt- him/article_4fadc80f-df0b-5c6f-a8c5-dd7fbf81c9a5.html External links  * Category:1994 films Category:1990s sports drama films Category:American basketball films Category:American films Category:American sports drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by William Friedkin Category:Films set in Indiana Category:Films shot in Chicago Category:Films shot in Indiana Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:1994 drama films ","title":"Blue Chips"},{"id":"1512836","text":"Louis George Alexander (15 January 1932 ‚Äì 17 June 2002) (commonly referred to as L.

He created the blueprint for the Survive self-study series (1980‚Äì83, reissued 1989) for modern languages and published courses in the field of computer-assisted language learning. In 1986-88 he was adviser to the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate for the Cambridge Certificate in English for International Communication. He was a writer of EFL course materials from the 1960s onwards. Alexander consistently supported the cause of the relatively untrained non-native speaking teacher of English. Louis Alexander died of leukemia on 17 June 2002 in Chamb√©ry, Savoie, France. Legacy Tim Rix, former chairman of the Longman Group, praised Alexander as having \\"particular abilities and knowledge\\", combined with a \\"use of linguistics\\", which \\"meshed perfectly well with the requirements of ELT [English language teaching]\\" in his time. Alexander had an immense influence on English language teaching in China. In recognition of this, a statue was raised in his honour in the grounds of the \\"Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press..., one of China‚Äôs largest schoolbook publishers\\".Xia Xu, \\"Learning Text by Heart and Language Education: The Chinese Experience\\", in: Theory and Practice in Language Studies, Vol. 3, No. 1, pp. 41-50, January 2013.

Thus this book came into being, and its name, Ben-Oni, 'Son of Sadness,' should indicate its origin.\\" (Reinganum, Aaron; Hoeck, Johann Daniel Albrecht [1825]: Ben-Oni oder die Vertheidigungen gegen die Gambitz√ºge im Schache [Son of sorrow or Defenses against Gambits in Chess]. Frankfurt am Main [Germany]: Hermann. Old Benoni: 1.d4 c5  The Old Benoni starts with 1.d4 c5. The Old Benoni may transpose to the Czech Benoni, but there are a few independent variations. This form has never attracted serious interest in high-level play, though Alexander Alekhine defeated Efim Bogoljubow with it in one game of their second match, in 1934. The Old Benoni is sometimes called the Blackburne Defense, after Englishman Joseph Henry Blackburne, the first player known to have used it successfully. Czech Benoni: 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e5  In the Czech Benoni, also known as the Hromadka Benoni, after Karel Hrom√°dka, Black plays 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e5. The Czech Benoni is more than the Modern Benoni, but also more passive. The middlegames arising from this line are characterized by much maneuvering; in most lines, Black will look to break with ...b7‚Äìb5 or ...f7‚Äìf5 after due preparation, while White may play Nc3‚Äìe4‚Äìh3‚ÄìBd3‚ÄìNf3‚Äìg4, in order to gain space on the and prevent ...f5.http://www.chesscafe.com/shop/1166_excerpt.pdf Modern Benoni: 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6  The Modern Benoni, 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6, is the most common form of Benoni apart from the Benko Gambit. Black's intention is to play ...exd5 and create a , whose advance will be supported by fianchettoed bishop on g7. The combination of these two features differentiates Black's setup from the other Benoni defenses and the King's Indian Defense, although transpositions between these openings are common. The Modern Benoni is classified under the ECO codes A60‚ÄìA79. Snake Benoni: 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 Bd6  The Snake Benoni refers to a variant of the Modern Benoni where the bishop is developed to d6 rather than g7. This opening was invented in 1982 by Rolf Olav Martens, who gave it its name because of the sinuous movement of the bishop‚Äîin Martens's original concept, Black follows up with 6...Bc7 and sometimes ...Ba5‚Äîand because the Swedish word for \\"snake\\", orm, was an anagram of his initials. Normunds Miezis has been a regular exponent of this variation. Aside from Martens's plan, 6...0-0 intending ...Re8, ...Bf8 and a potential redeployment of the bishop to g7, has also been tried. White appears to retain the advantage against both setups. ECO The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO) has many codes for the Benoni Defense.

The French Navy does not use the term \\"destroyer\\" for its ships; hence some large ships, referred to as \\"frigates\\", are registered as destroyers. She is the second French vessel named after the 19-20th century politician and Navy Minister, Georges Leygues. She is the tender for the helicopter cruiser Jeanne d'Arc. Service history In 1981, Georges Leygues and the fleet escort Gu√©pratte, cruising in front of an Allied fleet during training sessions, detected a Soviet submarine, which they chased for 19 hours. A rare instance of submarine warfare occurred, the Soviet submarine tried running at and diving under the sonar of Georges Leygues to try to avoid detection, before she was forced to surface, being formally identified as a Victor class submarine by the on-board Lynx WG13. The same year, Georges Leygues intervened when the Iranian ship Tabarzin was captured by a commando hostile to the new regime, and sailed to France. The commando reached France and requested political refugee status, while the ship was returned to Iran. In 1987, France and Iran having broken off diplomatic relations, Georges Leygues escorted commercial ships in the Persian Gulf. In 1992, Georges Leygues took part in Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. In 1999, she was partially modified to accommodate student officers, and started tending the cruiser Jeanne d'Arc in the context of the training voyages of the French Naval Academy. The same year, after catastrophic flooding occurred in Mozambique the two ships were re-routed to deliver humanitarian aid.

Early life and education Harris was born in Fulham, London and became a chorister at Holy Trinity, Tulse Hill. At the age of 14, he took up a \\"flexible\\" position as assistant organist at St David's Cathedral in Wales under Herbert Morris, followed at 16 by a scholarship to the Royal College of Music. His teachers there were Sir Walter Parratt, Charles Wood, and Henry Walford Davies.Palmer, Christopher. Harris, Sir William H(enry) in Grove Music Online Career Harris was organist at St Augustine's Church, Edgbaston from 1911 to 1919 and concurrently assistant organist at Lichfield Cathedral. During this time he also taught at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire in collaboration with Granville Bantock. A move to Oxford in 1919 saw him take up organist positions successively at New College and in 1929 Christ Church, Oxford. While at Oxford, he conducted the Oxford Bach Choir (1925-1933) and was instrumental in founding and conducting the Opera Club, which put on the pioneering production of Monteverdi's Orfeo staged by Jack Westrup in 1925.Cooke, Mervyn. 'Harris, Sir William Henry', in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography In 1933 he was appointed organist at St George's Chapel, Windsor in succession to Charles Hylton Stewart.Henderson, John and Jarvis, Trevor. Sir William Henry Harris, Organist, Choir Trainer and Composer, RSCM Press, 2018 There, he was at his most productive: composing for the Three Choirs Festival, conducting at both the 1937 and 1953 coronations, and producing two orchestral pieces premiered at The Proms: the overture Once Upon a Time (1940) and the Heroic Prelude (1942).BBC Proms Archive Bruce Nightingale, who became senior chorister at Windsor during the wartime years, describes \\"Doc H\\" as having \\"a fat, usually jolly face with a few wisps of hair across an otherwise bald head.\\" Although choir practice was normally conducted in a \\"benign atmosphere,\\" Nightingale recounts that Harris would occasionally complain of a \\"batey practise\\" and, on the rare occasions he considered a performance mediocre, would scold the choirboys in a loud stage whisper from the organ loft. Harris was involved in the musical education of the teenage Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret Rose, who spent the wartime period at Windsor Castle. Every Monday he would direct madrigal practice in the Red Drawing Room at Windsor, where the two Princesses sang alongside four of the senior choristers with the lower voices augmented by Etonians, Grenadier Guards and members of the Windsor and Eton Choral Society. Jars of Argentinian honey, sent to Windsor by overseas subjects, were donated by the Princesses to the Choir School as a treat for the choristers.Nightingale, Bruce. Seven Rivers To Cross: A Mostly British Council Life, The Radcliffe Press (1996) Between 1923 to 1953 Harris served as a professor of organ and harmony and the Royal College of Music. He was also president of the Royal College of Organists (1946‚Äì8), and director of musical studies at the Royal School of Church Music (1956‚Äì61). He was appointed KCVO in 1954.Obituary The Times, 8 Sept 1973 Harris married Kathleen Doris Carter in 1913 and they had two daughters. After retirement from St George's Windsor in 1961 the couple went to live in Petersfield, Hampshire. Kathleen had suffered from deafness since 1925, but in the early 1960s her hearing was partially restored. She died in 1968. Harris had reached the age of 90 at his death five years later.William Henry Harris biography, Naxos Compositions Harris is best remembered today for his Anglican church music, though during his lifetime he was mainly known for his achievements as a choir-trainer. His most famous works are two anthems for unaccompanied double choir, Faire is the heaven (1925), a setting of Edmund Spenser's poem \\"An Hymne of Heavenly Beautie\\", and Bring us, O Lord God (first heard in Windsor on 29 October 1959), a setting of a poem by John Donne; and Strengthen ye the weak hands (1949) for choir and organ. The late anthem Evening Hymn (1961), a setting of Thomas Browne's 'The Night is Come', is particularly notable for its intense and expressive ending (on the words 'when I shall never sleep again, but wake forever') set \\"in a cool, clear C major with the hint of a sharpened fourth\\".Sampson, Alastair: William Henry Harris, Anthems, notes to Naxos CD 8.570148 (2006) His Communion Service in F was frequently sung in a great many Anglican parish churches up until the 1970s. The canticles Harris in A and Harris in A minor are still sung at Evensong in a number of Anglican cathedrals. The hymn tune Alberta (often used for the words Lead, Kindly Light), and various Anglican psalm chants remain familiar. Harris also composed cantatas and organ pieces. His largest composition, the 1919 choral- orchestral cantata The Hound of Heaven (a setting of the religious allegory by Francis Thompson), has been almost completely forgotten.Erpelding, M.A. The danger of the disappearance of things: William Henry Harris' The Hound of Heaven, University of Iowa dissertation, 2014 A second cantata, Michael Angelo's Confession of Faith (to a poem by Morna Stuart, after Wordsworth), was composed for the Three Choirs Festival in 1935. The organ works span seventy-four years, from the 1899 Andante in D to the Prelude in G (1973), which was later played at the funeral of Princess Diana.

Early life He was born into a millionaire brewing family on 4 August 1904. His father, Charles Nall-Cain, was created a baronet in 1921 and Baron Brocket of Brocket Hall in 1933. After his death a year later, Arthur succeeded to his titles. Nall-Cain was educated at Eton College and Oxford University, where he captained the golf team. He became a barrister and a Hertfordshire County Councillor. Career He was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool Wavertree at a by-election in 1931, and was a close associate of Neville Chamberlain. After his father died, Nall-Cain was required to leave the House of Commons as he was elevated to the House of Lords. Brocket inherited two grand houses: Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire and Bramshill Park, in Hampshire. In the 1930s, he bought the Knoydart estate in Lochaber, Scotland, and became an infamous absentee landlord, opposing the rights of crofters and dismissing and evicting workers, preferring the estate for shooting and fishing. He eventually owned 13,000 acres (53 km¬≤) in England and 62,000 in Scotland. Nazi sympathiser Brocket became known in society as a Nazi sympathiser. He became a committed member of the Anglo-German Fellowship, and his homes were used for entertaining supporters of Germany. So identified was Brocket with the cause of Nazi Germany that he attended Hitler's 50th birthday celebration in 1939, and was a close friend of Joachim von Ribbentrop. According to Neville Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary, the Earl of Halifax used Brocket as a conduit to convey the views of the British government to the leading German Nazis. After the outbreak of World War II, Brocket continued to work for an understanding between Britain and Germany. He urged a negotiated peace settlement and tried to arrange talks with Hitler. He had a contact with Hermann G√∂ring through a Swedish intermediary called Bengt Berg. Brocket worked closely with the historian Arthur Bryant, who shared his views and helped bring the negotiations to the attention of the Foreign Office. However, Brocket was informed that the proposal to grant Germany control over Poland and Czechoslovakia was not acceptable to the British government. Later life After the War, in 1948, some returning soldiers (the so-called Seven Men of Knoydart), who had fought the Nazis, decided to stake their claim to a portion of the Knoydart estate in a land raid, but they were taken to court by Brocket and dispossessed. Brocket sold the Knoydart estate shortly afterwards. In 1949, he bought the Carton House estate in Ireland. Personal life In 1927, Brocket married Angela Beatrix Pennyman, younger daughter of Rev. Preb. William Geoffrey Pennyman of Ormesby Hall in Yorkshire.Montague-Smith, P.W.

Conversely, if the process requires differencing to be made stationary, then it is called difference stationary and possesses one or more unit roots. Those two concepts may sometimes be confused, but while they share many properties, they are different in many aspects. It is possible for a time series to be non-stationary, yet have no unit root and be trend-stationary. In both unit root and trend-stationary processes, the mean can be growing or decreasing over time; however, in the presence of a shock, trend-stationary processes are mean-reverting (i.e. transitory, the time series will converge again towards the growing mean, which was not affected by the shock) while unit-root processes have a permanent impact on the mean (i.e. no convergence over time). Formal definition A process {Y} is said to be trend-stationary if :Y_t = f(t) + e_t, where t is time, f is any function mapping from the reals to the reals, and {e} is a stationary process. The value f(t) is said to be the trend value of the process at time t. Simplest example: stationarity around a linear trend Suppose the variable Y evolves according to :Y_t = a \\\\cdot t + b + e_t where t is time and et is the error term, which is hypothesized to be white noise or more generally to have been generated by any stationary process. Then one can useNelson, Charles R. and Plosser, Charles I.

The residuals from this regression are given by :\\\\hat{e}_t = Y_t - \\\\hat{a} \\\\cdot t - \\\\hat{b}. If these estimated residuals can be statistically shown to be stationary (more precisely, if one can reject the hypothesis that the true underlying errors are non-stationary), then the residuals are referred to as the detrended data,http://www.duke.edu/~rnau/411diff.htm \\"Stationarity and differencing\\" and the original series {Yt} is said to be trend-stationary even though it is not stationary. Stationarity around other types of trend=Exponential growth trend Many economic time series are characterized by exponential growth. For example, suppose that one hypothesizes that gross domestic product is characterized by stationary deviations from a trend involving a constant growth rate. Then it could be modeled as :\\\\text{GDP}_t = Be^{at}U_t with Ut being hypothesized to be a stationary error process. To estimate the parameters a and B, one first takes the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of this equation: : \\\\ln (\\\\text{GDP}_t) = \\\\ln B + at + \\\\ln (U_t). This log- linear equation is in the same form as the previous linear trend equation and can be detrended in the same way, giving the estimated (\\\\ln U)_t as the detrended value of (\\\\ln \\\\text{GDP})_t , and hence the implied U_t as the detrended value of \\\\text{GDP}_t, assuming one can reject the hypothesis that (\\\\ln U)_t is non-stationary. Quadratic trend Trends do not have to be linear or log-linear. For example, a variable could have a quadratic trend: :Y_t = a \\\\cdot t + c \\\\cdot t^2 + b + e_t. This can be regressed linearly in the coefficients using t and t2 as regressors; again, if the residuals are shown to be stationary then they are the detrended values of Y_t.

Regan, the brand's manager as of March 2010, explained that Reynolds is \\"a huge part of Altamont\\" and \\"what it is is basically his [Reynolds] brainchild.\\" Over time, the brand has expanded beyond skateboarding, and a large team of contributors in the fields of music and art are also involved as of October 2013. STI Lab Sole Technology is home to the Sole Technology Institute (STI Lab), a research and development facility that conducts biomechanical skate shoe research. The lab's research has led to numerous developments: The STI Foam footbed, an insole designed to relieve pressure; Flo2, a heat reducing tongue; and System G2, a shock-absorbing gel cushion. The facility has also been responsible for other technological advancements in footwear. Headquarters In addition to the Sole Technology Institute, the head office of Sole Technology houses a retail store and showrooms. The entrance of the premises has been described as the skateboarder's version of Ancient Rome's pantheon.

The term is broadly inclusive as it encompasses marks which do not fall into the conventional set of marks (e.g. those consisting of letters, numerals, words, logos, pictures, symbols, or combinations of one or more of these elements), and therefore includes marks based on appearance, shape, sound, smell, taste and texture. Non-conventional trademarks may therefore be visible signs (e.g. colors, shapes, moving images, holograms, positions), or non-visible signs (e.g. sounds, scents, tastes, textures). Trends and issues Certain types of non- conventional trademarks have become more widely accepted in recent times as a result of legislative changes expanding the definition of \\"trademark\\". Such developments are the result of international treaties dealing with intellectual property, such as the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which sets down a standardised, inclusive legal definition. Single colour trademarks, motion trademarks, hologram trademarks, shape trademarks (also known as three-dimensional trademarks or 3D trademarks), and sound trademarks (also known as aural trademarks), are examples of such marks. In the United Kingdom, colours have been granted trademark protection when used in specific, limited contexts such as packaging or marketing. The particular shade of turquoise used on cans of Heinz baked beans can only be used by the H. J. Heinz Company for that product. In another instance, BP claims the right to use green on signs for petrol stations. In a widely disputed move, Cadbury's (confectioners) has been granted \\"the colour Purple\\". In the United States, it is possible, in some cases, for color alone to function as a trademark. Originally, color was considered not a valid feature to register a trademark Leshen & Sons Rope Co. v. Broderick & Bascom Rope Co., 201 U.S. 166 (1906). Later, with the passage of the Lanham Act the United States Supreme Court in the case of Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., 514 U.S. 159, 165, 115 S.Ct. 1300, 1304, 131 L.Ed.2d 248 (1995) would rule that under the Lanham Act, subject to the usual conditions, a color is registrable as a trademark. The right to exclusive use of a specific color as a trademark on packaging has generally been mixed in U.S. court cases. Specific cases denying color protection include royal blue for ice cream packages (AmBrit Inc. v. Kraft, Inc., 812 F.2d 1531 (11th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1041 (1987)); a series of stripes or multiple colors on candy packages (Life Savers v. Curtiss Candy Co., 82 F.2d 4 (7th Cir. 1950)); green for farm implements (Deere & Co. v. Farmhand Inc. (560 F. Supp. 85 (S.D. Iowa 1982) aff'd, 721 F.2d 253 (8th Cir. 1983)); black for motors (Brunswick Corp. v. British Seagull, Ltd., 35 F.3d 1527 (Fed. Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 1426 (1994)); and the use of red for one half of a soup can (Campbell Soup Co. v. Armour & Co., 175 F. 2d 795 (Court of App. 3d Cir., 1949)). A successful case granting color protection involved the use of the color red for cans of tile mastic Dap Products, Inc. v. Color Tile Mfg., Inc. 821 F. Supp. 488 (S.D. Ohio 1993), and a green-gold color for dry cleaning pads (Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., 514 U.S. 159, 165, 115 S.Ct. 1300, 1304, 131 L.Ed.2d 248 (1995)). Although scent trademarks (also known as olfactory trademarks or smell trademarks), are sometimes specifically mentioned in legislative definitions of \\"trademark\\", it is often difficult to register such marks if consistent, non-arbitrary and meaningful graphic representations of the marks cannot be produced. This tends to be an issue with all types of non- conventional trademarks, especially in Europe. United States practice is generally more liberal; a trademark for plumeria scent for sewing thread was registered in 1990. In Europe, a written description, with or without a deposited sample, is not sufficient to allow the mark to be registered, whereas such formalities are acceptable in the United States. However, even in the United States \\"functional\\" scents that are inherent in the product itself, such as smell for perfume, are not accepted for registration. One example of a shape trademark recognized in Europe is the protection granted to Toblerone, a company which manufactures chocolate bars with a distinctive triangular shape. Presenting further difficulties are entirely new types of marks which, despite growing commercial adoption in the marketplace, are typically very difficult to register, often because they are not formally recognised as a \\"trademark\\". Examples of such marks are motion trademarks (also known as animated marks, moving marks, moving image marks or movement marks). Many web browsers feature a moving image mark in the top right hand corner of the browser screen which is visible when the browser is in the process of resolving a website. Decisions on non-conventional trademarks=Owens-Corning Owens-Corning was issued a trademark for the color pink used to color its fiberglass batting insulation product. The decision was based upon the fact that the company had been emphasizing the pink color of its insulation for decades, had licensed use of the Pink Panther cartoon character in its ads, the color was a non- functional aspect of the product (fiberglass is normally tan or yellow), and Owens Corning had spent over US$50 million advertising its insulation product. In re Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 774 F.2d 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Sieckmann In Dr. Ralf Sieckmann vs Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt (case C-273/00), a judgement of the European Court of Justice issued on December 12, 2002, the ECJ held in relation to trademarks in the European Community that: *Article 2 of Council Directive 89/104/EEC (of 21 December 1988 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks) must be interpreted as meaning that a trade mark may consist of a sign which is not in itself capable of being perceived visually, provided that it can be represented graphically, particularly by means of images, lines or characters, and that the representation is clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective. *In respect of an olfactory sign, the requirements of graphic representability are not satisfied by a chemical formula, by a description in written words, by the deposit of an odour sample or by a combination of those elements.

It was a junior-level feeder formula that used small single seater Formula Three chassis. Its final official title was the Cooper Tires British Formula 3 International Series. Notable former champions included Jim Clark, Jackie Stewart, Emerson Fittipaldi, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna, Mika H√§kkinen, Rubens Barrichello, Takuma Sato, and Daniel Ricciardo. History The first Formula Three championship to take place in the UK was the Autosport F3 championship held in 1951, which was won by Eric Brandon. By 1954, it had evolved into a national-level series and was organised by the British Racing and Sports Car Club (BRSCC).British F3 Champions From motorsportsetc.com. Retrieved on 4 September 2007. This was the 500cc period of Formula Three, which was active in the UK and other countries until 1959, at which point Formula Three was adapted into Formula Junior. In this period, there were often two or three series running concurrently and a single national series had yet to be firmly established.Formula 3 Story From clarinet.fi. Retrieved 5 September 2007. The FIA reintroduced Formula Three in 1964 using a one-litre engine formula, and there were two F3 championships held in the UK that year. This was not the last occasion of two or more F3 championships running concurrently in the post-1964 era: from 1970 to 1973, there were three regional series (the Lombard North, John Player, and Forward Trust championships) and there were normally two series between then and 1978, with many drivers running in both. From 1979 onwards, there would be a single championship as the BARC and BRDC combined their series into the Vandervell British F3 Championship, which was later renamed for sponsorship reasons to the Marlboro British F3 Championship and then the Lucas British F3 Championship. In 1974, the engine capacity was raised to two litres, which remained the engine formula all the way until the championship's demise some 40 years later. In 1984, the series adopted a B class for competitors with older chassis, which helped grid sizes to grow rapidly in the 1980s, renamed in 2000 as the Scholarship class and later the National class. In 2004, the organisation of the series was taken over by SRO, which began to run the series alongside the British GT Championship. Five years later, the series declined an invitation to join the support bill of the British Touring Car Championship, which attracted larger crowds than the British F3/GT meetings run by SRO. However, rising costs in the late 2000s as a result of the arrival of big-spending engine manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen and hosting rounds abroad, combined with the revival of an FIA-backed European Formula 3 Championship in 2012, starved the British series of grid numbers, which were down to the mid-teens by 2012. Facing a shortfall of entries in 2013, the calendar was cut from 10 to just four meetings in a bid to save the series. The following year saw the calendar back up to seven meetings, but grids remained small, with some races attracting as few as five cars. In October 2014, it was announced that the 2014 season would be the final season of the British Formula Three Championship after a planned merger with the German Formula Three Championship fell through. Equipment Like most Formula Three championships, competitors in British F3 were permitted to use any eligible chassis, but in practice few competitors deviated from the Dallara after the Italian marque's arrival in 1993. Since then, TOM'S, Mygale and Lola have been among those to take on the might of the Italian marque, largely without success. Prior to Dallara's domination, Ralt and Reynard were the pacesetting chassis, with March being the chassis of choice for much of the 1970s. Two engine manufacturers ‚Äì AMG-Mercedes (tuned by H.W.A) and Volkswagen ‚Äì were represented on a full-time basis at the time of the series' demise. The Mugen-Honda engine (tuned by Neil Brown Engineering) was the dominant powerplant of the 1990s and the early-to-mid 2000s, prior to the arrival of Mercedes in 2006, although other manufacturers, including Toyota, Vauxhall/Opel, Renault and Mitsubishi also enjoyed success in the past. All entrants in the series had to use control tyres from a single supplier. Since 1982, these were manufactured by Avon Tyres, which from the 2009 season onwards were re-branded as Cooper Tires, as Cooper became the championship's official title sponsor.

It consists of two parts. The first part itself consists of two sections and was aired on 1 November 1989, on BBC, under the title A Promise Fulfilled. Part one Pietro Badoglio's use of mustard gas and his ordering of bombing of Red Cross-operated hospitals is shown in the first section. The emphasis is placed upon Italian war crimes committed during the Italian invasions of Ethiopia. The Italian revenge massacres after an attempted assassination of the Italian governor of Ethiopia are shown. Italian war crimes committed against Slovene and Croatian civilians on the Italian- occupied territory of Kingdom of Yugoslavia are shown in the second section of the first part. The Rab concentration camp witnesses and atrocities in the Croatian village of Podhum near Rijeka are shown. Part two The second part, called A Pledge Betrayed, aired on 8 November 1989, exposes British (and American) hypocrisy, which prevented extradition of 1,200 Italian war criminals (the most wanted were Pietro Badoglio, Mario Roatta and Rodolfo Graziani), for whom Yugoslavia, Greece and Ethiopia provided full documentation of their crimes. The documentary's cynical conclusion is Churchills quote about \\"the better tomorrow with a new world order.\\" Historical truth If Italian officers were prosecuted by the (British controlled) court at all, they were accused only of the death of the British prisoners of war, but not of the death of the civil population in occupied territories. It was on 9 September 1943, the day of Allies' invasion of the Italian mainland, when anti-fascist Nicola Bellomo then commander of the XII MVSN Zone, formed a makeshift Italian force and counterattacked Germans that tried to occupy the port of Bari . In this successful defence action, general Nicola Bellomo was wounded. As an anti-fascist, general Bellomo may have been considered a threat to the Badoglio government. Nicola Bellomo, as a gesture of military honour, preferred not to escape from the prison when the door was intentionally left open, after he was sentenced to death. Non-prosecution of Italian war criminals Yugoslavia, Greece and Ethiopia requested extradition of 1,200 Italian war criminals who were however never prosecuted because the British and American governments with the beginning of cold war saw in Pietro Badoglio a guarantee of an anti-communist post-war Italy.Effie G.

(Archived by WebCite¬Æ) After in the 1950s two Italian film-makers were jailed for depicting the Italian invasion of Greece, the Italian public and media were forced into the repression of collective memory, which led to historical amnesia and eventually to historical revisionism.Alessandra Kersevan (2008) Foibe - Revisionismo di stato e amnesie della repubblica.

The town is on the West end of Lough Derg and is best known for its harbour. The Scarriff Market House is easily recognisable, and it is therefore often used to represent the town.Official Scariff Website (top-left), Scariff News, October 2007 (top- right, example - see the archive for more examples). Location The name \\"Scarriff\\" comes from the Irish \\"scarbh\\", which may mean either a shallow, a rocky shore or a rough ford. All of these are appropriate to the early town, which lies at a crossing on the River Graney upstream from its mouth on Lough Derg. In 1831 the town of Scarriff had 120 houses, as well as oil and flour mills. There was one main street running up from the river. The small market town is popular with anglers who fish the Graney, the Shannon and Lough O'Grady, which is two miles west of the town. The town of Scariff is in the Catholic parish of Scariff and Moynoe. Parish churches are the Sacred Heart in Scariff and St Mary's in Clonusker. Scarriff is on the route of the East Clare Way, walking trail. Tuamgraney and Inis Cealtra are nearby. History Little is known of the Scariff area in pre-Christian times. However, the presence of the remains of a wedge tomb at Cappabane tells us that the area has been inhabited for at least 4,000 years. The name Scariff is derived from the Gaelic \\"Scairbh\\" which means a rocky ford or crossing place. Long before the present town came into being the area was of great strategic importance to those who held the territory about and to those who sought to hold it - the presence of the great river Shannon on the one hand and the mountainous terrain on the other rendered this Scairbh a most important crossing point on a journey north or south. The National School about a minute away from the town centre is the school for nearly all the children in the parish. The Camogie and Hurling teams are hugely successful with both getting to the semi- finals of the Feile Na nGael. The name Scariff is first mentioned in 1315 in connection with a battle fought there during the civil wars of the period. The chipboard factory now occupies the site of the conflict. By the end of the fourteenth century, the Scariff area was under the control of the O'Grady clan. To maintain their dominance three castles or fortified houses were built, one at Tuamgraney (which still stands), one near the bridge at the Scairbh which no longer exists and a third, smaller building, at Moynoe. The earliest account of Scariff castle is from 1564. In 1633 Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, bought ten quarters of land north of the Graney River, including the castle and ironworks of Scarriff. These lands were combined with the old Moynoe parish to form the Scariff parish. Today Scariff and Moynoe is a parish of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe. Scariff as a town developed around the castle and its growth was helped by the presence of a smelting furnace which operated there. It is shown on a map of the Down survey in 1655. The town grew gradually in the following centuries, its fortunes generally in line with those of the country as a whole. In penal times Mass was celebrated at the Mass Rock at Cappabane. Scariff suffered greatly during the Famine in the 19th century. A workhouse was built in 1841 at Drewsboro to provide some relief for the poor, and was opened in May 1842 to accommodate 600 persons. After the famine started in 1845 starving and destitute locals flocked to the workhouse. By 1846 the local graveyard was full with inmates from the workhouse and a new graveyard had to be opened outside Tuamgraney. The following year the workhouse ran out of food, water and clothing for the inmates, who were dying from fever and starvation at the rate of a dozen a day, along with those who were caring for them. The matron, her children and the parish priest, among other carers, died of fever. Even after the famine passed, in 1851, the workhouse had 3,212 inmates. The population in the Workhouse Union district in 1851 was reduced during the famine by more than 50% to 23,057. The East Clare Brigade of the IRA burned the remains of the workhouse down in 1921.Clare Champion, 4 August 2006 The 20th century however saw the town begin to prosper. New roads were built. It had a bank, a Police station, flour mills and a Market House reflecting its growing importance as a market town. As well as improved road connections, the Dock provided vital trade links and Scariff enjoyed its position as the business centre of north- east Clare. Two of the more prominent buildings - the workhouse and the Police station - were destroyed in the War of Independence. A large chipboard factory can now be found in Scarriff,Scariff News, April 2007. but the town no longer has a bakery and the dock no longer operates as in former times.

The French Navy does not use the term \\"destroyer\\" for its ships. Thus, some large ships, referred to as \\"fr√©gates\\" in French, are registered as destroyers. And additionally, some minor ships, referred to as \\"avisos\\" in French, are registered as frigates. She is the third French vessel named after the 18-19th century politician and admiral Louis-Ren√© Levassor de Latouche Tr√©ville. Service history In November 2006 and again in June 2010, Latouche-Tr√©ville visited London on diplomatic duties, and was moored alongside the Second World War cruiser, . In the summer of 2009, she was filmed in stormy seas as part of the documentary Oceans. A video showing the ship in towering seas was set to the Naval Hymn, Eternal Father, Strong to Save (William Whiting, 1860). Latouche-Tr√©ville departing from Portsmouth Naval Base, UK, 21 September 2009. In the autumn of 2009, while attached to an international force of NATO vessels, Latouche-Tr√©ville visited Portsmouth Naval Base in the United Kingdom with vessels of the Dutch, Norwegian, Spanish and Turkish navies. On 15 October 2012, the frigate was moored at Leith Docks in Scotland. On 18 April 2015, she escorted a replica of the 18th century sailing ship as it departed La Rochelle, France on her maiden voyage across the Atlantic to Yorktown, Virginia in the United States. She returned to Brest with the ship on 10 August. In May 2015, Latouche-Tr√©ville was among a dozen surface vessels and four submarines that took part in NATO's annual \\"Dynamic Mongoose\\" exercise. Amid flaring tensions with Russia, the two-week event in Norwegian waters saw ships under NATO command conducting a variety of anti- submarine warfare operations. On 4 June 2015, she was moored again at Leith Docks in Scotland. On 9 January 2020, she suffered damage in a storm soon after departing from Brest, and returned to port the next day with her top mast missing. The incident also destroyed an electronic warfare pod and damaged the starboard SYRACUSE system.

Like most other colleges in the university, the college is named after a region of the traditional county of Lancashire. The college takes its name from the Lonsdale area, the valley of the River Lune. History quadrangle, given to Bowland College in 2004 The College was originally located in what is now Bowland North to the north of Alexandra Square. The college was designed in tandem with Bowland and was in fact designed as a mirror image of it.Origins and growth In 2004 the college moved, along with Cartmel College to some of the newly built buildings to the south of the main campus in Alexandra Park. Its original buildings were transferred to the other founding college, Bowland, and became known as Bowland North.

The popularity of WCW in 1996 and 1997 allowed for the creation of a new show, which became WCW Thunder. Thunder was taped on Tuesday nights and then aired on Thursday, a change for WCW as producer Eric Bischoff was very keen on its primary show WCW Monday Nitro being aired live every week (as opposed to rival WWF Raw is War, which, at the time, was live every other week). The rights to WCW Thunder now belong to WWE, who purchased WCW properties in 2001. The trademark for \\"WCW Thunder\\" was renewed by WWE in 2018. As of November 2019, all 156 episodes of Thunder are available to stream on the WWE Network. History=Creation The popularity of World Championship Wrestling's primary show, WCW Monday Nitro on TNT, led Ted Turner to create a new show, which would eventually be named Thunder, that would air Thursdays on TBS. According to the Wrestling Observer, WCW originally named the program Thursday Thunder, but dropped \\"Thursday\\" from the title to distinguish it from a similarly named program on ESPN and to provide TBS more programming flexibility if they were to move the broadcast to a different day of the week. WCW executive vice-president Eric Bischoff was originally reluctant to produce another two-hour weekly television show for a variety of reasons. First, Time Warner (WCW's parent company) was under a hiring freeze which prevented Bischoff from bringing in additional production people to run the show.Bischoff, p. 255 Second, he felt WCW did not have enough talent to produce another show and risked overexposing them and making storylines less significant. Third, according to Bischoff, TBS refused to pay the cost of producing Thunder which was between $12 million and $15 million per year.Bischoff, p. 257 Bischoff eventually decided that he could make the new show work and help pay for it by expanding revenue from increased house show business.Bischoff, p. 258 Bischoff was also given permission to sign Bret Hart, specifically as a high-profile talent to perform on Thunder.Bischoff, pp. 261, 271 WCW Thunder originally debuted as a live weekly show, but the schedule was changed by Bischoff in August 1998 due to complaints by wrestlers over travel demands. Tapings were expanded to four hours, with the first two hours being broadcast live and the last two hours taped to air the following week. WCW Thunder debuted on January 8, 1998 and drew a 4.02 Nielsen rating. The first match to take place in Thunder featured Chris Adams against Randy Savage with Miss Elizabeth. Adams pinned Savage after a chairshot from Lex Luger. The match decision was reversed by WCW Commissioner/Chairman of Executive Committee James J. Dillon. WCW Thunder debuted for viewers in England on October 3, 1998 on broadcast cable network TNT Europe. TV commercials for Thunder featured top ring talents such as Hulk Hogan saying \\"Observe this, brother!\\" and The Giant with \\"This forecast definitely calls for pain!\\" In 1998, WCW Thunder consistently had one of the highest Nielsen ratings on cable, at one time rivaling the audience size of a Thursday night NFL broadcast on ESPN. The Wrestling Observer reported the December 3, 1998 WCW Thunder show had a 3.7 rating head-to-head against the NFL game, which drew a 4.5 rating. WCW Thunder's success in 1998 included ticket sales, as a number of live events sold out and grossed gates over $100,000. The WCW Thunder at the Fargodome in Fargo, North Dakota on April 16, 1998 drew 15,362 people and grossed $274,393 in ticket sales, which were both records highs for that market. 2000‚Äì2001 WCW Thunder switched from Thursday evenings to Wednesday evenings on January 12, 2000. Since WWF SmackDown! debuted on UPN in the same timeslot as Thunder, WCW had been trailing the WWF in the ratings on Thursdays as well as on Mondays, as this was during the time WCW's ratings began their steady decline that would eventually lead to the company's demise. On October 9, 2000, WCW moved the Thunder tapings to Monday nights, the same night as Nitro. After the live Nitro broadcast ended, the Thunder taping would commence. This practice continued until March 19, 2001, when Thunder taped its last episode. Bryan Alvarez and R. D. Reynolds wrote in their book, The Death of WCW, the reasoning behind the tapings was attendance at Thunder events had dropped considerably over the previous twenty-one months.Reynolds, R.D.; Alvarez, Bryan. \\"The Death of WCW\\", ECW Press 2004. Towards the end of the show's run, WCW Thunder was the anchor of a TBS programming block known as \\"iWatch Wednesdays\\", which was tied to the website TBS Interactive. After installing a web browser plugin, users had access to forums, games and contests related to the TBS programs, including Thunder. Final broadcast In an attempt to save WCW, Bischoff attempted to purchase the company with Fusient Media Ventures. However, although Bischoff's offer had been accepted, recently appointed Turner Broadcasting executive Jamie Kellner announced shortly after his arrival that Thunder and all WCW programming was immediately canceled on TBS. Bischoff's group then withdrew their offer, as it was contingent on keeping WCW programming on some outlet. WCW's trademarks and certain assets (such as its video library and the contracts of 24 wrestlers), though not the company itself (which still exists as a Time Warner-owned legal entity under the name Universal Wrestling Corporation), were bought by the WWF, its long-time competitor. Reception Veteran industry journalist Wade Keller said that the introduction of Thunder could be called \\"the beginning of the end\\" for the now-defunct WCW, adding that the program's debut \\"is probably as good of a turning point as you could pick out\\". Wrestling Observer subscribers voted WCW Thunder the worst weekly television show in 1999 and 2000.

In the modern artform, conductors tend to hoist batons for indicating melodic curves and ornaments. History Early music (vocal church music), as far back as the 5th century, required some central direction from a leader in the coordination of singers in their delivery of melodic lines of mostly free rhythm. Traced back to early Egyptian performances through hieroglyphic documentation (etchings in stone depicting a leader employing hand signals to indicate pitch and rhythm details for wind instrument players), this form of conducting seems to predate Guido of Arezzo's designation of joints of the fingers for indicating pitches, and seems to have offered more than limited pitch instruction. These early leaders, or cheironomers, though possessing none of the modern conducting skills developed in the 17th century, using a form of choreographed hand signals, adeptly controlled the movement of the melodic lines, producing incredibly well-synchronized performances. Cheironomy, though not a commonly used term in today's reference to conducting, serves, as it did in early music, as the model for the motions necessary to direct some modern music which require individualized direction to specific players, within less metrically structured musical compositions. It is still in use in the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church (despite a decline of chant in the late twentieth century), of some Middle Eastern sects and in synagogues to direct the singing of liturgical songs (Hebrews probably learned cheironomy from Egyptians), and, more rarely, in some ancient Western religions. The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians comments that the method is particularly developed in traditions lacking a written notation, including Vedic, Byzantine and Roman chants. Jewish religious cheironomy can also be found as mnemonic signs in printed Hebrew Bibles, appearing above, below and amidst the text to be sung, to guide the cantor in his rendition of Biblical readings: see Cantillation.

Manchukuo was a puppet state set up by the Empire of Japan in Manchuria which existed from 1931 to 1945. The Manchukuo regime was established four months after the Japanese withdrawal from Shanghai with Puyi as the nominal but powerless head of state to add some semblance of legitimacy, as he was a former emperor and an ethnic Manchu.  Government  Manchukuo was proclaimed a monarchy on 1 March 1934, with former Qing dynasty emperor Puyi assuming the Manchukuo throne under the reign name of Emperor Kang-de. An imperial rescript issued the same day, promulgated the organic law of the new state, establishing a Privy Council, a Legislative Council and the General Affairs State Council to \\"advise and assist the emperor in the discharge of his duties\\". The Privy Council was an appointive body consisting of Puyi's closest friends and confidants, and the Legislative Council was largely an honorary body without authority. The State Council was therefore the center of political power in Manchukuo.  Political parties and movements  During his administration, the Kangde Emperor, in an interview with foreign journalists, mentioned his interest in forming a political party with Confucian doctrines.

The character first appeared in Thor #132 (September 1966) and was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby. Kurt Russell portrayed the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), where the character is reimagined as a Celestial and Peter Quill's father. Publication history Ego the Living Planet was initially introduced in The Mighty Thor #132 (September 1966), and was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby. Ego was created by Kirby during a phase in which he was fascinated with the expanse of the universe. Ego, the alien Kree, and The Colonizers immediately followed the creation of Galactus, thus establishing Marvel Comics' own \\"space age mythology\\". Reprinted in As Kirby recalled in 1969, shortly after the character's debut, Ego's genesis came when: The reader's first glimpse of Ego on the last page of Thor #132 is a full-page splash panel photo collage with Ego's human features superimposed on a bulbous, chaotic planetoid. Kirby had been using photo collages for several years; this image has been called \\"his most effective and freakish to date.\\" Ego returned as a protagonist in Thor #160‚Äì161 (Jan.‚ÄìFeb. 1969), and made a guest appearance in #201. His origin is explored in Thor #228. Following appearances in Fantastic Four #234‚Äì235 (Sept.‚ÄìOct. 1981) and Rom #69 (Aug. 1985), Ego had a recurring role in Silver Surfer vol, 3 #4‚Äì22 (1987‚Äì1989). The character returned in the 1991 Thor annual and issues #448‚Äì450 (June‚ÄìAug 1992). Ego played a prominent role in the company-wide crossover storyline \\"Maximum Security\\", appearing in Avengers #35 (Dec. 2000); Maximum Security: Dangerous Planet (Oct. 2000); Iron Man #34‚Äì35 (Nov.‚ÄìDec. 2000); X-Men Unlimited #29 (Dec. 2000); Gambit #23 (Dec. 2000) and Maximum Security #1‚Äì3 (Dec. 2000Jan. 2001). The character returned in Nova vol 4 #20‚Äì30 and Astonishing Thor #1‚Äì5 (Nov 2010July 2011). Ego the Living Planet also appeared in the Oni Press Color Special. Fictional character biography= 1960s  Ego once told Thor that his existence was the result of a scientist merging with a planet when that planet's sun went nova.Thor #228. Marvel Comics. Ego began absorbing space vessels and even planets to survive, and planned to produce armies of Anti-bodies to conquer worlds across the universe. This behavior attracted the attention of the Rigellian Colonizers, who feared that the nearby Ego would consume their home world. They recruited the Thunder God, Thor, to defeat Ego. Accompanied by a Rigellian Recorder, Thor encountered Ego and stunned him with a powerful storm. Feeling humiliated by his defeat, Ego vowed never to leave the Black Galaxy and renounced his plans of conquest.Thor #132‚Äì133 (Sept.‚ÄìOct. 1966). Marvel Comics. Several months later, a weakened Galactus invaded Ego's space and sought to replenish his energy by consuming Ego. Thor aided Ego in battling Galactus and drove Galactus off. In gratitude, Ego allowed its surface to become the new home of the Wanderers; a group of various alien races whose planets had been the very first to be devoured by Galactus billions of years ago.Thor #160‚Äì161 (Jan.‚ÄìFeb. 1969). Marvel Comics.  1970s  The Rigellian Tana Nile took a sample of Ego's form, in the hope that this could be used to fertilize sterile worlds being considered for habitation.Thor #201. Marvel Comics. However, this act drives Ego insane, and it soon gives in to its primordial urges and absorbs the Wanderers, which causes Thor to side with a returning Galactus. Assisted by ally, Hercules and Galactus's herald, Firelord, Thor holds Ego off until Galactus attaches a massive starship engine to Ego's south pole, which drives the planet constantly through space and thereby prevents it from being a threat to other planets and populated sections of the universe.Thor #227‚Äì228 (Sept.‚ÄìOct. 1977). Marvel Comics.  1980s  Years later, Ego gains control of the engine and tracks Galactus to Earth, seeking vengeance. Unable to locate him, Ego attacks Earth. He causes massive destruction, which is later undone by a reality-altering mutant. The Fantastic Four attempted to defeat Ego by removing the power cell from one of the attached propulsion engines, which the Thing attempts to throw into Ego's \\"brain\\". In response, an angered Ego attempts to counter with his remaining engines but, with one engine now deactivated, the other propels the now-out- of-control planet into the Sun, its gravitational pull breaking apart Ego's substance.Fantastic Four #234‚Äì235 (Sept.‚ÄìOct. 1981). Marvel Comics. Ego, however, slowly reforms from a few surviving particles and repairs the propulsion unit. Ego then digests a number of Dire Wraiths to replenish its energy reserves, and battles the Spaceknight Rom.Rom #69 (Aug. 1985). Marvel Comics. Ego later joins the Elders of the Universe in a plan to destroy Galactus. Ego is sidelined before the confrontation when he is defeated by the Silver Surfer.Silver Surfer vol. 3, #4 (Oct. 1987).

While Ego seeks a similar entity to itself, the Stranger has arranged for Alter-Ego to hate Ego, intending to learn through their battle if freedom or captivity breeds a stronger will. Alter-Ego is wounded and loses mass when Ego is forced to attack it in self-defense, but Thor intervenes before Ego can strike a killing blow. The remaining fragments of Alter-Ego become a moon of Ego, and the two begin to travel together as a family.Astonishing Thor #1‚Äì5 (Nov. 2010July 2011). Marvel Comics.

Galactus, changed into the Life- Bringer by the Ultimates, encounters Ego after regaining his strength after a battle with the new universal construct Lagos. Ego attacks Galactus as he journeys to his inner brain at the center of the planet, however loses control of his constructs, which realize that Galactus is not a threat. Ego then reveals that before his creation by the Stranger, his consciousness was that of a man named Egros, similar to Galactus' former self Galan. After formally meeting one another and putting aside their past animosities, Galactus uses his Life-Bringer abilities to form a body for the rest of Ego, who now calls himself Ego-Prime. Ego-Prime then joins Eternity Watch, a group Galactus has put together to deal with the First Firmament, the first iteration of all that is, who had chained Eternity.The Ultimates 2 #8 Powers and abilities The living planet named Ego has been called a \\"bioverse\\". Every part of its substance, including the atmosphere, is alive as much as it is controlled by the consciousness of Ego. It often transforms its surface to appear as a giant face to address powerful beings and can shape its terrain to suit the circumstances. Ego can use its substance to display plant-like growth, manipulate its own weather for heavy winds or storms, and the ground to generate earthquakes, volcanoes, geysers, and canyons, create a protective shield of solid clouds to defend from space attacks, extrude tentacles that reach out into space, and produce vast numbers of Antibodies, which are powerful, non-sentient humanoids that it mentally commands. Ego can also transform its surface into a dead world or a beautiful paradise to lure unwary space travelers to its surface, whom it promptly consumes. It has various internal features similar to a biological lifeform, like large tunnels that have been compared to arteries and its consciousness is inside a giant, brain- like organ deep below its surface. Ego can raise its internal temperature to burn life forms inside, has digestive organs to absorb living beings, and an immune system that lets him release the previously mentioned Antibodies to attack intruders on or below its surface. Reprinted in It can also control its own radiation and magnetic fields to hide from scanning technology. Ego can generate vast psionic energies that rival a hungered Galactus at their peak. It can project energy blasts to obliterate starships or planets,Maximum Security #1. Marvel Comics. read minds and scan their biological structure,Thor #133. Marvel Comics. and communicate to sentient beings using telepathy. If its energy reserves are depleted, Ego can restore them by devouring planets, tapping into stars, or digesting large numbers of living beings. Its psionic abilities are also how it controls its biosphere. Additionally, Ego is exceptionally intelligent, although as its name suggests, it harbors an extreme superiority complex and can be emotional if thwarted. For a while, Ego was propelled through space via the engine Galactus implanted on its south pole, but eventually gained control of it through its vast mental powers, allowing it to travel through hyperspace at enormous speeds. However, the device was later removed,Fantastic Four #234‚Äì235 (Sept ‚Äì Oct 1981). Marvel Comics. and it does not need the engine to travel anymore. Other versions=Amalgam Comics In the Amalgam Comics published jointly by Marvel Comics and DC Comics, Oa the Living Planet, an amalgamation version of Ego and DC's Planet Oa, was featured under the Amalgam Comics imprint in Iron Lantern #1, where he is the source of power for the Green Lantern Corps. Another version of Ego in the Amalgam universe appeared in Thorion of the New Asgods as Ego- Mass, an amalgamation of Ego and the Source Wall. Exiles Ego appears in Exiles #53 (December 2004). Set in the universe of Earth-4162, Ego implants the Seeds of Awareness in the Earth in an attempt to create another living planet.

After finding his son, he explains that he came into existence millions of years ago and has learned to use his cosmic powers to manipulate matter, using this ability to form an entire planet around himself, as well as many resources and a human body to interact with other sentient beings. However, being bored of immortality and disappointed with a universe full of inferior life, Ego decides to remake all worlds in the universe into extensions of himself, a plan that requires planted seedlings and the power of another Celestial to activate them. To achieve this, Ego mates with various species until a suitable offspring would be conceived to help put his plan into action. The only suitable child turns out to be Peter Quill, although he rebels when Quill learns that Ego killed Quill's mother to eliminate the distraction she would have posed to his plan. In the end, Quill and the Guardians of the Galaxy destroy Ego.

Motivation Kalman filters are an important filtering technique for building fault-tolerance into a wide range of systems, including real-time imaging. The ordinary Kalman filter is generally optimal for many systems. However, an optimal Kalman filter is not stable (i.e. reliable) if Kalman's observability and controllability conditions are not continuously satisfied (Kalman, 1960). These conditions are very challenging to maintain for any larger system. This means that even optimal Kalman filters may start diverging towards false solutions. Fortunately, the stability of an optimal Kalman filter can be controlled by monitoring its error variances if only these can be reliably estimated (e.g. by MINQUE). Their precise computation is, however, much more demanding than the optimal Kalman filtering itself. The FKF computing method often provides the required speed-up also in this respect.  Optimum calibration  Calibration parameters are a typical example of those state parameters that may create serious observability problems if a narrow window of data (i.e. too few measurements) is continuously used by a Kalman filter (Lange, 1999). Observing instruments onboard orbiting satellites gives an example of optimal Kalman filtering where their calibration is done indirectly on ground (Olsson el al, 2001). There may also exist other state parameters that are hardly or not at all observable (estimable) if too small samples of data are processed (analysed) at a time by any sort of a Kalman filter.  Inverse problem  The computing load of the inverse problem of an ordinary Kalman recursion is roughly proportional to the cube of the number of the measurements processed simultaneously. This number can always be set to 1 by processing each scalar measurement independently and (if necessary) performing a simple pre-filtering algorithm to de-correlate these measurements. However, for any large and complex system this pre-filtering may need the HWB computing. Any continued use of a too narrow window of input data weakens observability of the calibration parameters and, in the long run, this may lead to serious controllability problems totally unacceptable in safety-critical applications. Even when many measurements are processed simultaneously, it is not unusual that the linearized equation system becomes sparse, because some measurements turn out to be independent of some state or calibration parameters. In problems of Satellite Geodesy (Brockmann, 1997), the computing load of the HWB (and FKF) method is roughly proportional to the square of the total number of the state and calibration parameters only and not of the measurements that are billions.  Reliable solution  Reliable operational Kalman filtering requires continuous fusion of data in real-time. Its optimality depends essentially on the use of exact variances and covariances between all measurements and the estimated state and calibration parameters. This large error covariance matrix is obtained by matrix inversion from the respective system of Normal Equations. Its coefficient matrix is usually sparse and the exact solution of all the estimated parameters can be computed by using the HWB (and FKF) method. The optimal solution may also be obtained by Gauss elimination using other sparse-matrix techniques or some iterative methods based e.g. on Variational Calculus. However, these latter methods may solve the large matrix of all the error variances and covariances only approximately and the data fusion would not be performed in a strictly optimal fashion. Consequently, the long-term stability of Kalman filtering becomes uncertain even if Kalman's observability and controllability conditions were permanently satisfied. Description The Fast Kalman filter applies only to systems with sparse matrices (Lange, 2001), since HWB is an inversion method to solve sparse linear equations (Wolf, 1978). The sparse coefficient matrix to be inverted may often have either a bordered block- or band-diagonal (BBD) structure. If it is band-diagonal it can be transformed into a block-diagonal form e.g. by means of a generalised Canonical Correlation Analysis (gCCA). Such a large matrix can thus be most effectively inverted in a blockwise manner by using the following analytic inversion formula: :\\\\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\\\end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} A^{-1}+A^{-1}B(D-CA^{-1}B)^{-1}CA^{-1} & -A^{-1}B(D-CA^{-1}B)^{-1} \\\\ -(D-CA^{-1}B)^{-1}CA^{-1} & (D-CA^{-1}B)^{-1} \\\\end{bmatrix} of Frobenius where : A = a large block- or band-diagonal (BD) matrix to be easily inverted, and, : (D-CA^{-1}B) = a much smaller matrix called the Schur complement of A. This is the FKF method that may make it computationally possible to estimate a much larger number of state and calibration parameters than an ordinary Kalman recursion can do. Their operational accuracies may also be reliably estimated from the theory of Minimum-Norm Quadratic Unbiased Estimation (MINQUE) of C. R. Rao (1920- ) and used for controlling the stability of this optimal fast Kalman filtering (Lange, 2015).  Applications  The FKF method extends the very high accuracies of Satellite Geodesy to Virtual Reference Station (VRS) Real Time Kinematic (RTK) surveying, mobile positioning and ultra-reliable navigation (Lange, 2003). First important applications will be real-time optimum calibration of global observing systems in Meteorology, Geophysics, Astronomy etc. For example, a Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) system can now forecast observations with confidence intervals and their operational quality control can thus be improved. A sudden increase of uncertainty in predicting observations would indicate that important observations are missing (observability problem) or an unpredictable change of weather is taking place (controllability problem). Remote sensing and imaging from satellites are partly based on forecasted information. Controlling stability of such feedback between these forecasts and the satellite images calls for the theory of optimal Kalman filtering. No suboptimal solution would do a proper job as the public safety is here at stake. The computational advantage of FKF is marginal for applications using only small amounts of data in real-time. Therefore, improved built-in calibration and data communication infrastructures need to be developed first and introduced to public use before personal gadgets and machine-to-machine (M2M) devices can make the best out of FKF.

He went to the Farnham School of Art (now the University for the Creative Arts). After leaving school, he was a press photographer for a year and then joined a design company as a sculptor. Half of his time is spent on commissions and the other half on his gallery sculpture. He is well known for his major outdoor pieces, such as the Young Mozart in Chelsea and the Jersey Liberation sculpture. His sources of inspiration have been Jacob Epstein, Auguste Rodin, Henry Moore, Oscar Nemon and Kenneth Armitage. But the most powerful influences in his life are his wife Jean and son Jamie who work with him. Philip Jackson describes his art in the following words: Honours Jackson was appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in the 2009 Queen's Birthday Honours List. On 1 April 2008, Jackson was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of West Sussex. His work on the RAF Bomber Command Memorial won him the 2013 Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Sculpture.

It is so named due to the history of black lacquer being associated in the West with products from Japan.Niimura, Noriyasu; Miyakoshi, Tetsuo (2003) Characterization of Natural Resin Films and Identification of Ancient Coating . J. Mass Spectrom. Soc. Jpn. 51, 440. JOI:JST.JSTAGE/massspec/51.439 Its high bitumen content provides a protective finish that is durable and dries quickly. This allowed japan black to be used extensively in the production of automobiles in the early 20th century in the United States. It can also be called japan lacquer and Brunswick black. Used as a verb, japan means \\"to finish in japan black.\\" Thus japanning and japanned are terms describing the process and its products. Ingredients Japan black consists mostly of an asphaltic base dissolved in naphtha or turpentine, sometimes with other varnish ingredients, such as linseed oil. It is applied directly to metal parts, and then baked at about 200¬∞C (400¬∞F) for up to an hour. Automobile use Japan black's popularity was due in part to its durability as an automotive finish. However, it was the ability of japan black to dry quickly that made it a favorite of early mass-produced automobiles such as Henry Ford's Model T. The Ford company's reliance on Japan black, led Henry Ford to quip \\"Any customer can have a car painted any colour that he wants so long as it is black\\". While other colors were available for automotive finishes, early colored variants of automotive lacquers could take up to 14 days to cure, whereas japan black would cure in 48 hours or less. Thus variously colored pre-1925 car bodies were usually consigned to special orders, or custom-bodied luxury automobiles. The development of quick-drying nitrocellulose lacquers (pyroxylins) which could be colored to suit the needs of the buying public in the 1920s led to the disuse of japan black by the end of the 1920s. In 1924, General Motors introduced \\"True Blue\\" Duco (a product of DuPont) nitrocellulose lacquer on its 1925 model Oakland automobile marque products. Ford's formulations Ford used two formulations of japan black, F-101 and F-102 (renamed M-101 and M-102 after March 15, 1922). F-101, the \\"First Coat Black Elastic Japan\\", was used as the basic coat applied directly to the metal, while F-102, \\"Finish Coat Elastic Black Japan\\", was applied over the first layer. Their compositions were similar: 25‚Äì35% asphalt and 10% linseed oil with lead and iron-based dryers, dissolved in 55% thinners (mineral spirits, turpentine substitute or naphtha). The F-101 also had 1‚Äì3% of carbon black added as a pigment. The asphalt used in the Ford formulations was specified to be Gilsonite. This has long been used in formulations of paint for use on ironwareSee Pontypool japan as it increases the elasticity of the paint layer, allowing it to adhere to steel subjected to vibration, deformation and thermal expansion without cracking or peeling.

Bruceploitation is an exploitation film subgenre mostly seen in the 1970s after Lee's death in 1973. History When Bruce Lee died on July 20, 1973, he was Hong Kong's most famous martial arts actor. When Enter the Dragon became a box office success worldwide, many Hong Kong studios feared that a movie without their most famous star in it would not be financially successful. So some studios decided to play on Lee's sudden international fame by making movies that vaguely sounded like Bruce Lee starring vehicles, with actors who looked like Lee‚Äîchanging their screen names to sound similar to ‚ÄúBruce Lee\\", such as Bruce Li and Bruce Le. Actors After Bruce Lee's death, many actors assumed Lee-like stage names. Bruce Li (Èªé(L√≠)Â∞èÈæç from his real name Ho Chung Tao (‰ΩïÂÆóÈÅì)), Bruce Chen, Bruce Lai (real name Chang Yi-Tao), Bruce Le (ÂëÇ(L«î)Â∞èÈæç from his real name Wong Kin Lung), (ÈªÉÂª∫Èæç)), Bruce Lie, Bruce Liang (also known as Bruce Leung), Saro Lee, Bruce Ly (real name Binhslee), Bruce Thai, Brute Lee, Myron Bruce Lee, Lee Bruce, and Bruce Lei/Dragon Lee (real name Moon Kyoung-seok) were hired by studios to play Lee-styled roles. Bruce Li appeared in Bruce Lee Against Supermen where he stars as Kato, assistant of the Green Hornet, a role originally played by the real Bruce Lee. Additionally, when some Japanese karate and Korean taekwondo films were dubbed into English for U.S. release, the protagonists were given new Lee-like stage names. Such was the case with Jun Chong (credited as Bruce K. L. Lea in the altered and English-dubbed Bruce Lee Fights Back from the Grave) and Tadashi Yamashita (credited as Bronson Lee in the altered English-dubbed Bronson Lee, Champion). Jackie Chan, who started his movie career as an extra and stunt artist in some of Bruce Lee's movies, was also given roles where he was promoted as the next Bruce Lee as Chan Yuen Lung (with Yuen Lung's stage name borrowed from his fellow Fortunes brother Sammo Hung), such as New Fist of Fury (1976). It was only when he made some comedy-themed movies for another studio that he was able to gain box-office success. In 2001, actor Danny Chan Kwok-kwan sported Lee's look in the Cantonese comedy film Shaolin Soccer. The role landed him to play Lee in the biographical television series The Legend of Bruce Lee. Films and television Some of the films, such as Re-Enter the Dragon, Enter Three Dragons, Return of Bruce, Enter Another Dragon, Return of the Fists of Fury or Enter the Game of Death, were rehashes of Bruce Lee's classics. Others told Lee's life story and explored his mysteries, such as Bruce Lee‚Äôs Secret (a farcical rehash starring Bruce-clone Bruce Li in San Francisco defending Chinese immigrants from thugs), Exit the Dragon, Enter the Tiger (where Bruce Li is asked by Bruce Lee to replace him after his death), and Bruce‚Äôs Fist of Vengeance. Other films used his death as a plot element such as The Clones of Bruce Lee (where clones of Bruce Lee portrayed by some of the above actors are created by scientists) or The Dragon Lives Again (where Bruce Lee fights a plethora of fictional characters in Hell such as James Bond and Dracula and finds allies amongst others such as Popeye and Kwai Chang Caine). Others, such as Bruce Lee Fights Back from the Grave, featured Lee imitators but with a plot having nothing to do with Bruce Lee. One of Lee's fight choreographers, actor-director Sammo Hung, famously satirized the phenomenon of Bruceploitation in his 1978 film, Enter the Fat Dragon. Elliott Hong's They Call Me Bruce? satirized the tendency for all male Asian actors (and by extension, male Asians in general) to have to sell themselves as Bruce Lee-types to succeed. One notable film is Fist of Fear, Touch of Death released in 1980. While the real Lee does appear in the movie, it is only through dubbed stock footage.SykoGrafix -Fist of Fear, Touch of Death The movie passes itself off as non-fiction, but is indeed fictional. The plot involves a martial arts tournament where the prize is recognition as Lee's successor. This in intertwined with what the movie passes off as the life story of Bruce Lee. The film says that Lee's parents did not want him be an martial artist and he ran away from home to become an actor (In real life, they encouraged his careers). The film conflates China and Japan by stating Lee's martial art was Karate (a Japanese art) instead of Kung Fu (a Chinese art) and that his great-grandfather was a samurai (impossible as samurai are found in Japan, not China).http://www.sykografix.com/articles/article39/index.html Comic books and animation The comic book medium also gave birth to several characters inspired by Bruce Lee, most notably in Japanese comics or manga. Paul Gulacy was inspired by Bruce Lee when he drew Marvel Comics's Shang-Chi. Manga and anime In Tetsuo Hara and Buronson‚Äôs influential sh≈çnen manga and anime series Hokuto no Ken, known to Western audiences as Fist of the North Star, the main character Kenshiro was deliberately created by them based on Bruce Lee, combined with influences from the film Mad Max. Kenshiro‚Äôs appearance resembles that of Lee, as well as mannerisms inspired by Lee, such as his fighting style and battle cries. Additionally, in Hokuto no Ken‚Äôs prequel Souten no Ken, the main character is Kenshiro‚Äôs uncle, named Kenshiro Kasumi, who is also modeled after Lee‚Äôs physique and mannerisms in the same way as his nephew. Akira Toriyama's influential shonen manga and anime series Dragon Ball was also inspired by Bruce Lee films, such as Enter the Dragon (1973). The title Dragon Ball was inspired by Enter the Dragon as well as later Bruceploitation knockoff kung fu movies which frequently had the word \\"Dragon\\" in the title. Later, when Toriyama created the Super Saiyan transformation during the Freeza arc, he gave Goku piercing eyes based on Bruce Lee's paralyzing glare. In Masashi Kishimoto‚Äôs Naruto manga, the characters Might Guy and Rock Lee were modeled by him after Bruce Lee. Video games Datasoft Inc. released the game Bruce Lee in 1984. EA Sports UFC includes Bruce Lee as an unlockable character, though it came with the approval of his daughter Shannon. For video game franchises, Super Street Fighter II character Fei Long was designed as a homage to Bruce Lee as well. The character Liu Kang in the Mortal Kombat franchise was also modeled after Bruce Lee. The Tekken franchise followed suit with Marshall Law, and just once had him substituted by introducing his son Forest Law. One notable game that features Bruce Lee is The Dragon, released in 1995 by Ramar International (also called Rinco) and Tony Tech in Taiwan.http://fuji.drillspirits.net/dragon The game is for the Famicom (better known as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in the west) but is not licensed by Nintendo or the Bruce Lee estate. The game's plot is loosely based on the plots of Lee's films and most levels are given titles from them.http://fuji.drillspirits.net/dragon The game mixes fighting parts with platforming parts and is also noted for stealing graphics from Mortal Kombat (including using Liu Kang to represent Lee), being one of the few Famicom/NES games to have two languages (English and Arabic) available in game and one of the few in Arabic at all.http://fuji.drillspirits.net/dragon The game's official Arabic title as shown on the title screen is ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÜŸäŸÜ (\\"Al- Tinneen\\") and the box also gives the game the Chinese title of ÊùéÂ∞èÈæç (\\"L«ê Xi«éol√≥ng\\", Bruce Lee's name in Chinese) and the alternate title of Lee Dragon.http://fuji.drillspirits.net/dragon Many other video games have characters based on Lee, although he is rarely credited. Video game characters synonymous with Lee are usually spotted by fighting techniques and signature ‚Äújumping stance\\", physical appearances, clothing, and iconic battle cries and yells similar to those of Lee. Examples include fighting game characters such as Maxi in the Soulcalibur series and Jann Lee in the Dead or Alive series. End of a trend Bruceploitation ended when Jackie Chan made a name for himself with the success of the kung fu comedies Snake in the Eagle‚Äôs Shadow and Drunken Master. These films established him as the \\"new king\\" of Hong Kong martial arts cinema. Another factor in the end of Bruceploitation was the beginning of the Shaw Brothers film era in the late 1970s, which started with movies such as Five Deadly Venoms. Since the end of the trend, Bruce Lee's influence on Hong Kong action cinema remained strong, but the actors began establishing their own personalities, and the films began to take on a more comedic approach.Bright Lights Film Journal, An Evening with Jackie Chan by Dr. Craig Reid, issue 13, 1994 . Retrieved 1 April 2006. Rebirth Bruceploitation has continued in the United States in a muted form since the 1970s. Films such as Force: Five, No Retreat, No Surrender, and The Last Dragon used Bruce Lee as a marketing hook, and the genre continues to be a source of exploration for fans of the late Little Dragon and his doppelgangers. Fist of Fear, Touch of Death told a fictional life story of the star. Michael Worth in 2017 began an effort to shine more light on the subject, beginning with helping to produce the first official documentary on the subject with Severin Films. His decade-long writing is set to be the first book on the subject, set for release in 2018 and featuring interviews with many key players. A series of new scanned film prints are also in the works for 2018 and 2019. In May 2010, Carl Jones published the book Here Come the Kung Fu Clones. It focuses on a particular Lee-a-like, Ho Chung Tao, but it also explores the best and worst actors and films that the genre has to offer. In the third season of the 2012 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series, the character of Hun (originally a muscle-bound Caucasian from the 2003 cartoon series) makes his debut, with his appearance and behaviour closely patterned after Bruce Lee. The first Spanish book on the genre by Ivan E. Fernandez Foj√≥n, Bruceploitation. Los clones de Bruce Lee, will be published by Applehead Team Creaciones in November 2017. Stewart Home‚Äôs book Re-Enter The Dragon: Genre Theory, Brucesploitation & the Sleazy Joys of Lowbrow Cinema (Ledatape Organisation, Melbourne 2018) ‚Äúis cleaning up the territory and sharpening the contours of the category of Bruceploitation which as he sees it has not been worked out rigorously enough by early pioneers.‚Äù This book appeared after Home made and exhibited an art film meditation on the subject of Bruceploitation for Glasgow International in 2016.

The division was originally formed as an infantry division in 1934. In 1937 it was motorized and named the 13th Motorized Infantry Division which participated in the campaigns against Poland (1939) and western Europe (1940). Following the Fall of France in June 1940, the division was reorganized as the 13th Panzer Division. It participated in Operation Barbarossa (the invasion of the USSR) in 1941 and the advance on the Caucasus in 1942. The division suffered heavy losses in the retreats of 1943 and 1944. It was partially refitted in Hungary, where it was encircled and destroyed by Allied forces in the winter of 1944-1945. The formation was reformed as Panzer Division Feldherrnhalle 2 in the spring of 1945 and surrendered in May 1945. During the invasion of Poland, the troops of the division committed war crimes, including reprisal killings, using civilians as human shields and destroying a medical column. Operational history  The 13th Motorized Infantry Division participated in the invasion of Poland, as part of the southern thrust, and the Battle of France, advancing through Belgium towards Calais and on to Lyon.Mitcham, p. 112 The 13th Panzer Division was formed in Vienna in October 1940 from the 13th Motorized Infantry Division and was immediately sent to Romania but was not part of the Balkan campaign. It served in Operation Barbarossa as part of Panzer Group 1 (Army Group South), and it contributed to the successful encirclements of the Soviet forces at Kiev. At the end of 1941, it was positioned at Rostov; however, it was forced to retreat due to fierce Soviet counter-attacks.Mitcham, p. 113 In 1942 and 1943, the division formed part of the First Panzer Army (Army Group A); it was involved in the battles for the Caucasus oil fields and at the Kuban Peninsula after the Battle of Stalingrad. In the fall of 1943, it was withdrawn to Western Ukraine, where it fought defensive battles near the river Dniepr. The offensive of the Soviet Army pushed the Germans to their starting positions of June 1941. The 13th Panzer Division was attached to Army Group South Ukraine, which had orders to stop the Soviets from capturing the Romanian oil fields. The division was reformed in July and it received modern equipment, including the Panther G tank and the Jagdpanzer IV. The Red Army offensive of August 1944 resulted in the deaths or imprisonment of most of the division. In the Battle of Debrecen, the division helped to annihilate three Soviet corps; however, it was encircled in Budapest at the end of 1944 and destroyed in January 1945.Mitcham, p. 114 In the spring of 1945, the division was reformed under the name Feldherrnhalle 2. The last engagements with the Soviets were fought on the Austro-Hungarian border. The Division surrendered in Austria in May 1945.

After graduation in 1956, he played college football at the University of Utah, where he was a two-way starter at halfback and cornerback for the Utes under head coaches Jack Curtice and Ray Nagel. NFL career=Player Despite his skill and adaptability, Wilson's small size (he was only six feet tall) resulted in him not being selected until the 7th round of the 1960 NFL draft by the Chicago Cardinals. The draft was held in November 1959, and the franchise moved to St. Louis before the start of the 1960 season. Shortly before Wilson's signing, defensive coordinator Chuck Drulis crafted a play that called for the free safety to take part in a blitz. The play was code-named \\"Wildcat\\", but Drulis didn't think he had anyone with the skills and athleticism to run it until Wilson's arrival. Drulis was impressed enough with Wilson that he persuaded the Cardinals to convert him to free safety. When the Cardinals first ran the safety blitz, the pressure was severe since most teams did not (and still do not) expect a defensive back to take part in a pass rush. This single play also helped to set up today's defenses where a blitz can come from anywhere. Wilson became so identified with the play that \\"Wildcat\\" became his nickname. Wilson was named All-Pro six times in his career and represented the Cardinals on eight Pro Bowl teams. During 1966, he had at least one interception in seven consecutive games, en route to a 10-pick season that led his league. Fellow Idahoan Jerry Kramer, a guard for the Green Bay Packers and author of Instant Replay, called Wilson \\"the finest football player in the NFL.\\" Kramer described Wilson's play during an October 30, 1967 game, \\"...he fired up their whole team ... (h)is enthusiasm was infectious.\\"Kramer, J. (1968). Instant Replay: The Green Bay diary of Jerry Kramer. New York: The World Publishing Company, p. 173. Wilson is renowned for not only playing, but intercepting a pass, with casts on both hands due to broken wrists. On the September 18, 2006 edition of SportsCenter, Mike Ditka challenged Terrell Owens' toughness by not playing for 2‚Äì4 weeks due to a broken finger. He cited Wilson's interception with casts on both hands as proof of a tougher football player. He ended his career with 52 career picks for 800 yards and five touchdowns. Wilson retired after the 1972 season. He is one of the few players to have played in the NFL for at least 10 years without having taken part in an official playoff game. The closest he came to postseason play was in 1964, when the Cardinals played in and won the Playoff Bowl, a postseason third-place game. It was one of only five winning seasons the Cardinals had during his 13-year career. Executive Following his retirement as a player, Wilson was named secondary coach and director of scouting. He stepped down as secondary coach after the 1973 season. In 1977, he was named general manager, a post he would hold (under various titles) for the next 17 years. He also served as interim head coach in 1979 after the dismissal of Bud Wilkinson. Wilson added the title of vice president in 1988, after the team's move to Arizona. He stepped down as GM in 1993, but remained as vice president until his retirement after the 2002 season. Honors Wilson was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, making him one of the few Hall of Famers to have never played in the postseason. In 1999, he was ranked number 43 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, making him the highest-ranked player to have played a majority of his career with the Cardinals. The team has also retired his uniform number 8. In 2007, NFL Network ranked him ninth on its list of the \\"Top 10 Draft Steals\\" in NFL history. Wilson was named to the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1994 and was named to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team in 2019. Personal life Wilson was married to Nancy Wilson for over forty years and had two children. He died on September 17, 2020 in Scottsdale, Arizona.

It has also been marketed as a potential light attack aircraft. Development of the aircraft began in 1991 and the maiden flight was conducted on 25 April 1996. In 2002, it won a Russian government tender for training aircraft and in 2009 the aircraft entered service with the Russian Air Force. As an advanced training aircraft, the Yak-130 is able to replicate the characteristics of several 4+ generation fighters as well as the fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57. It can also perform light-attack and reconnaissance duties, carrying a combat load of 3,000 kg. Development Yak-130 at the Zhukovsky Airfield, 1999 In the early 1990s, the Soviet government asked the industry to develop a new aircraft to replace the Czech-made Aero L-29 Delf√≠n and Aero L-39 Albatros jet trainers. Five design bureaus put forward proposals. Among them were the Sukhoi S-54, Myasishchev M-200, Mikoyan MiG-AT, and Yakovlev Yak-UTS. In 1991, the other proposals were dropped and only the MiG-AT and Yak-UTS remained. The air forces of the newly independent Russia estimated that its requirement would be about 1,000 aircraft. Development of Yak-UTS started in 1991 and the design was completed in September 1993. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, Yakovlev was compelled to look for a foreign partner. After having entered discussions in 1992, in 1993 it agreed with the Italian company Aermacchi to jointly develop the plane, which now became Yak/AEM-130; Aermacchi would be responsible for the project's financial and technical support. The first prototype, dubbed Yak-130D, was built by Sokol at Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, and was publicly unveiled in June 1995. The aircraft made its first flight on 25 April 1996 from Zhukovsky Airport at the hands of Yakovlev chief test pilot Andrey Sinitsyn. In 2000, differences in priorities between the two firms had brought about an end to the partnership, with each developing the aircraft independently. The Italian version was named M-346; Yakovlev received US$77 million for technical documents of the aircraft. Yakovlev would be able to sell the aircraft to countries such those in the Commonwealth of Independent States, India, Slovakia and Algeria. Aermacchi would be able to sell to NATO countries, among others. In March 2002, Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Mikhailov said that the Yak-130 and the MiG-AT had been chosen as the Russian Air Force's new trainers. The Yak-130, however, was said to be superior as it could serve the dual role of a trainer and combat jet. On 10 April 2002, it was announced that Yak-130 had been chosen as the winner of the tender for trainer aircraft for basic and advanced pilot training, beating the MiG-AT. By then, the Russian Air Force had ordered 10 Yak-130s, and the total cost of research and development, which included the construction and testing of the four pre-production aircraft, had amounted to some $200 million, 84% of which was financed by Yakovlev and the rest by the Russian government. However, it was reported that as much as $500 million had been spent in as early as 1996. Plans to develop a light-attack aircraft based on the Yak-130 came to a halt in the late 2011. Dubbed Yak-131, the aircraft failed to meet critical pilot safety requirements put forward by the Russian Air Force. The air force had instead shifted focus to a replacement based on the Sukhoi Su-25, which was slated to enter service by 2020. Design The underside of a Yak-130 Yak-130 is an advanced pilot training aircraft, able to replicate characteristics of Russian 4th and 5th generation fighters. This is possible through the use of open architecture digital avionics compliant with a 1553 Databus, a full digital glass cockpit, four-channel digital Fly-By-Wire System (FBWS) and Instructor controlled and variable FBWS handling characteristics and embedded simulation. The type also has a Head-up display (HUD) and a Helmet-Mounted-Sighting-System (HMSS), with a double GPS/GLONASS receiver updating an Inertial Reference System (IRS) for highly accurate navigation and precision targeting. The developer estimates that the plane can cover up to 80% of the entire pilot flight training program. flares In addition to its training role, the aircraft is capable of fulfilling Light Attack and Reconnaissance duties. It can carry a combat load of , consisting of various guided and un-guided weapons, auxiliary fuel tanks and electronic pods. According to its chief designer Konstantin Popovich, during a testing phase that ended in December 2009, the plane was tested with \\"all airborne weapons with a weight of up to 500 kg that are in service in the Russian Air Force\\". Yak-130 has nine hard points: two wingtip, six under-wing and one under-fuselage. Yak-130 at MAKS 2005 air show The aircraft's twin engines are mounted under extended wing roots, which reach as far forward as the windscreen. Two Ivchenko Progress AI-222-25 Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) produce a combined total of 49 kilonewtons (11,000 pound- force) of thrust. An upgraded, \\"-28\\" engine is also on offer, increasing the thrust to . At a normal Take-Off Weight of , a Thrust-to-Weight ratio of 0.70 is achieved with the \\"-25\\", or 0.77 with the \\"-28\\" engines. This compares with 0.65 for the BAE Systems Hawk 128 and 0.49 for the Aero Vodochody L-159B. Maximum internal fuel capacity is . With two external combat fuel tanks the figure increases to . Maximum true airspeed is Mach 0.93 (572 knots), service ceiling is 12,500 metres (41,000 feet) and load factors are from ‚àí3 to +9 g. Typical Take-Off speed and distance in a \\"clean\\" configuration are and 550 m (1,800 ft), whilst landing figures are and , respectively. Cross wind limit is . The Yakovlev Yak-130 is equipped with the FBWS controlled engine intake blanking doors, in order to prevent the aircraft's engines from sustaining Foreign object damage when operating from unpaved runways and grass strips. The large canopies are sideways hinged. Combat training suite on the Yak-130 includes simulated and real firing systems with air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, bomb dropping, gun firing and on-board self-protection systems. Operational history Yak-130 at MAKS-2011 Yak-130 prototype completed its maiden flight, registered as RA-43130, on 25 April 1996 at Zhukovsky airfield. On 30 April 2004, the first pre-series Yak-130, assembled at the Sokol plant in Nizhny Novgorod, performed its maiden flight. The plane was put on display for the first time at the Paris Air Show in June 2005. It was followed by three more pre-series aircraft. In December 2009, the aircraft completed state trials and was accepted for service in the Russian Air Force.

He played as a cornerback for the Denver Broncos and the Oakland Raiders in the National Football League (NFL). Following his playing career, Brown remained with the Raiders as an assistant coach. He served as the head football coach at California State University, Long Beach in 1991, the final season before the school's football program was terminated. Brown was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1984. At the time of his death he was on the Raiders' administrative staff. Playing career Brown played college football at Grambling State University and was not drafted by any professional team after leaving school in 1963. He was signed by the Houston Oilers of the American Football League (AFL), but was cut from the team during training camp. He was then signed by the AFL's Denver Broncos and became a starter by the middle of his rookie season. He won All-AFL honors in his second season and played in the AFL All-Star Game. In 1967, Brown was traded within the Western Division to the Oakland Raiders and spent the remainder of his playing career there. He served as defensive captain for 10 of his 12 years with the team. He was named to five AFL All-Star games and four NFL Pro Bowls. He was also named All-AFL three times and All-NFL four times. Perhaps Brown's most memorable moment as a Raider came late in Super Bowl XI, when he intercepted a Fran Tarkenton pass with under six minutes remaining and returned it a Super Bowl-record 75 yards for a touchdown. NFL Films immortalized Brown's play with a film clip of Brown running with the ball, appearing to be running straight to the camera. His record stood for 29 years, until it was broken by Kelly Herndon's non-scoring 76-yard interception return from the end zone in Super Bowl XL. Brown retired after the 1978 season, and finished his Raiders career with 39 interceptions, tied for first all-time on the team. He finished his sixteen seasons in professional football with 54 interceptions, which he returned for 472 yards and two touchdowns. He also recovered three fumbles. Brown was selected to the American Football League All-Time Team and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on July 28, 1984, his first year of eligibility. In 1999, he was ranked number 50 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, making him the highest-ranking Raiders player. Coaching career Brown served as a defensive backfield coach for the Raiders from 1979 to 1988. He was also the last head football coach at Long Beach State before the program was discontinued. Brown had succeeded George Allen, who had died just after the end of the 1990 season. He earned a master's degree at the same school in 1991, and later coached at Jordan High School in Los Angeles in 1994. In 1995, he returned to the Raiders as the Director of Staff Development.

Important in science, microtomes are used in microscopy, allowing for the preparation of samples for observation under transmitted light or electron radiation. Microtomes use steel, glass, or diamond blades depending upon the specimen being sliced and the desired thickness of the sections being cut. Steel blades are used to prepare sections of animal or plant tissues for light microscopy histology. Glass knives are used to slice sections for light microscopy and to slice very thin sections for electron microscopy. Industrial grade diamond knives are used to slice hard materials such as bone, teeth and plant matter for both light microscopy and for electron microscopy. Gem quality diamond knives are used for slicing thin sections for electron microscopy. Microtomy is a method for the preparation of thin sections for materials such as bones, minerals and teeth, and an alternative to electropolishing and ion milling. Microtome sections can be made thin enough to section a human hair across its breadth, with section thickness between 50 nm and 100 Œºm. History A diagram of a microtome drawn by Cummings in 1770. In the beginnings of light microscope development, sections from plants and animals were manually prepared using razor blades. It was found that to observe the structure of the specimen under observation it was important to make clean reproducible cuts on the order of 100 Œºm, through which light can be transmitted. This allowed for the observation of samples using light microscopes in a transmission mode. One of the first devices for the preparation of such cuts was invented in 1770 by George Adams, Jr. (1750‚Äì1795) and further developed by Alexander Cummings. The device was hand operated, and the sample held in a cylinder and sections created from the top of the sample using a hand crank. In 1835, Andrew Prichard developed a table based model which allowed for the vibration to be isolated by affixing the device to the table, separating the operator from the knife.Gilbert Morgan Smith: The Development of Botanical Microtechnique. In: Transactions of the American Microscopical Society 34, Nr. 2. 1915, S. 71‚Äì129, (PDF-Version of the article) Occasionally, attribution for the invention of the microtome is given to the anatomist Wilhelm His, Sr. (1865), In his Beschreibung eines Mikrotoms (German for Description of a Microtome), Wilhelm wrote: Other sources further attribute the development to a Czech physiologist Jan Evangelista Purkynƒõ. Several sources describe the Purkyne model as the first in practical use.Detlev Ganten: Handbuch der molekularen Medizin (Handbook of molecular medicine), Springer, , (Google-Books)Werner Gerabek, Bernhard D. Haage, Gundolf Keil, Wolfgang Wegner (2005): Enzyklop√§die Medizingeschichte (Encyclopaedia of medical history), Walter de Gruyter, , (Google-Books) The obscurities in the origins of the microtome are due to the fact that the first microtomes were simply cutting apparatuses, and the developmental phase of early devices is widely undocumented. At the end of the 1800s, the development of very thin and consistently thin samples by microtomy, together with the selective staining of important cell components or molecules allowed for the visualisation of microscope details.Werner Lin√ü, Werner Linb, Jochen Fangh√§nel: Histologie: Zytologie, allgemeine Histologie, mikroskopische Anatomie. (Histology: Cytology, general Histology, microscopial anatomy) Walter de Gruyter, 1998, (Google-Books) Today, the majority of microtomes are a knife-block design with a changeable knife, a specimen holder and an advancement mechanism. In most devices the cutting of the sample begins by moving the sample over the knife, where the advancement mechanism automatically moves forward such that the next cut for a chosen thickness can be made. The section thickness is controlled by an adjustment mechanism, allowing for precise control. Applications Microtome (C. Reichert, Vienna, 1905‚Äì1915). The most common applications of microtomes are: * Traditional Histology Technique: tissues are fixed, dehydrated, cleared, and embedded in melted paraffin, which when cooled forms a solid block. The tissue is then cut in the microtome at thicknesses varying from 2 to 50 Œºm. From there the tissue can be mounted on a microscope slide, stained with appropriate aqueous dye(s) after removal of the paraffin, and examined using a light microscope. * Frozen section procedure: water-rich tissues are hardened by freezing and cut in the frozen state with a freezing microtome or microtome-cryostat; sections are stained and examined with a light microscope. This technique is much faster than traditional histology (5 minutes vs 16 hours) and is used in conjunction with medical procedures to achieve a quick diagnosis. Cryosections can also be used in immunohistochemistry as freezing tissue stops degradation of tissue faster than using a fixative and does not alter or mask its chemical composition as much. * Electron Microscopy Technique: after embedding tissues in epoxy resin, a microtome equipped with a glass or gem grade diamond knife is used to cut very thin sections (typically 60 to 100 nanometer). Sections are stained with an aqueous solution of an appropriate heavy metal salt and examined with a transmission electron microscope. This instrument is often called an ultramicrotome. The ultramicrotome is also used with its glass knife or an industrial grade diamond knife to cut survey sections prior to thin sectioning. These survey sections are generally 0.5 to 1 Œºm thick and are mounted on a glass slide and stained to locate areas of interest under a light microscope prior to thin sectioning for the TEM. Thin sectioning for the TEM is often done with a gem quality diamond knife. Complementing traditional TEM techniques ultramicrotomes are increasingly found mounted inside an SEM chamber so the surface of the block face can be imaged and then removed with the microtome to uncover the next surface for imaging. This technique is called Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy (SBFSEM). * Botanical Microtomy Technique: hard materials like wood, bone and leather require a sledge microtome. These microtomes have heavier blades and cannot cut as thin as a regular microtome. * Spectroscopy (especially FTIR or Infrared spectroscopy) Technique: thin polymer sections are needed in order that the infra-red beam will penetrate the sample under examination. It is normal to cut samples to between 20 and 100 Œºm in thickness. For more detailed analysis of much smaller areas in a thin section, FTIR microscopy can be used for sample inspection. A recent development is the laser microtome, which cuts the target specimen with a femtosecond laser instead of a mechanical knife. This method is contact-free and does not require sample preparation techniques. The laser microtome has the ability to slice almost every tissue in its native state. Depending on the material being processed, slice thicknesses of 10 to 100 Œºm are feasible. Sectioning intervals can be classified mainly into either: *Serial sectioning: obtaining a continuous ribbon of sections from a paraffin block and using all for slides. *Step sections: collected at specified depths in the block. Types=Sledge  A sled microtome A sledge microtome is a device where the sample is placed into a fixed holder (shuttle), which then moves backwards and forwards across a knife. Modern sled microtomes have the sled placed upon a linear bearing, a design that allows the microtome to readily cut many coarse sections. By adjusting the angles between the sample and the microtome knife, the pressure applied to the sample during the cut can be reduced. Typical applications for this design of microtome are of the preparation of large samples, such as those embedded in paraffin for biological preparations. Typical cut thickness achievable on a sledge microtome is between 1 and 60 Œºm. Rotary  A rotary microtome of older construction This instrument is a common microtome design. This device operates with a staged rotary action such that the actual cutting is part of the rotary motion. In a rotary microtome, the knife is typically fixed in a horizontal position.Klaus Henkel: Das Schneiden mit dem Mikrotom . Mikrobiologische Vereinigung M√ºnchen e. V., 2006, accessed 15 February 2009 Principle of sample movement for making a cut on a rotary microtome In the figure to the left, the principle of the cut is explained. Through the motion of the sample holder, the sample is cut by the knife position 1 to position 2, at which point the fresh section remains on the knife. At the highest point of the rotary motion, the sample holder is advanced by the same thickness as the section that is to be made, allowing the next section to be made. The flywheel in many microtomes can be operated by hand. This has the advantage that a clean cut can be made, as the relatively large mass of the flywheel prevents the sample from being stopped during the sample cut. The flywheel in newer models is often integrated inside the microtome casing. The typical cut thickness for a rotary microtome is between 1 and 60 Œºm. For hard materials, such as a sample embedded in a synthetic resin, this design of microtome can allow good \\"semi-thin\\" sections with a thickness of as low as 0.5 Œºm. Cryomicrotome A cryomicrotome For the cutting of frozen samples, many rotary microtomes can be adapted to cut in a liquid-nitrogen chamber, in a so- called cryomicrotome setup. The reduced temperature allows the hardness of the sample to be increased, such as by undergoing a glass transition, which allows the preparation of semi-thin samples. However the sample temperature and the knife temperature must be controlled in order to optimise the resultant sample thickness. Ultramicrotome A ribbon of ultrathin sections prepared by room-temperature ultramicrotomy, floating on water in the boat of a diamond knife used to cut the sections. The knife blade is the edge at the upper end of the trough of water. An ultramicrotome is a main tool of ultramicrotomy. It allows the preparation of extremely thin sections, with the device functioning in the same manner as a rotational microtome, but with very tight tolerances on the mechanical construction. As a result of the careful mechanical construction, the linear thermal expansion of the mounting is used to provide very fine control of the thickness. These extremely thin cuts are important for use with transmission electron microscope (TEM) and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM), and are sometimes also important for light-optical microscopy. The typical thickness of these cuts is between 40 and 100 nm for transmission electron microscopy and often between 30 and 50 nm for SBFSEM. Thicker sections up to 500 nm thick are also taken for specialized TEM applications or for light-microscopy survey sections to select an area for the final thin sections. Diamond knives (preferably) and glass knives are used with ultramicrotomes. To collect the sections, they are floated on top of a liquid as they are cut and are carefully picked up onto grids suitable for TEM specimen viewing. The thickness of the section can be estimated by the thin- film interference colors of reflected light that are seen as a result of the extremely low sample thickness. Vibrating  The vibrating microtome operates by cutting using a vibrating blade, allowing the resultant cut to be made with less pressure than would be required for a stationary blade. The vibrating microtome is usually used for difficult biological samples. The cut thickness is usually around 30‚Äì500 Œºm for live tissue and 10‚Äì500 Œºm for fixed tissue. A variation on the vibrating microtome is the Compresstome microtome,. The Compresstome uses a specimen syringe or \\"lipstick-like\\" tube to hold the tissue. The tissue specimen is completely embedded in agarose (a polysaccharide), and the tissue is slowly and gently pressed out of the tube for the vibrating blade to cut. The device operates in the following way: the end of the specimen tube where the tissue emerges is slightly narrower than the loading end, which allows gentle \\"compression\\" of the tissue as it comes out of the tube. The slight compression prevents shearing, uneven cutting, and vibration artifacts from forming. Note that the compression technology does not damage or affect the tissue being sectioned. There are several advantages of the Compresstome microtome: 1) the agarose embedding provides stability to the entire specimen on all sides, which prevents uneven slicing or shearing of tissue; 2) the compression technology gently compresses tissue for even cutting, so that the blade doesn't push against the tissue; 3) faster sectioning than most vibrating microtomes; and 4) it cuts tissue from older or more mature animals well to provide healthier tissues. Saw  The saw microtome is especially for hard materials such as teeth or bones. The microtome of this type has a recessed rotating saw, which slices through the sample. The minimal cut thickness is approximately 30 Œºm and can be made for comparatively large samples. Laser  A conceptual diagram of laser microtome operation The laser microtome is an instrument for contact-free slicing.Holger Lubatschowski 2007: Laser Microtomy, WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, Biophotonics, S. 49‚Äì51 (PDF ). Prior preparation of the sample through embedding, freezing or chemical fixation is not required, thereby minimizing the artifacts from preparation methods. Alternately this design of microtome can also be used for very hard materials, such as bones or teeth, as well as some ceramics. Dependent upon the properties of the sample material, the thickness achievable is between 10 and 100 Œºm. The device operates using a cutting action of an infrared laser. As the laser emits a radiation in the near infrared, in this wavelength regime the laser can interact with biological materials. Through sharp focusing of the probe within the sample, a focal point of very high intensity, up to TW/cm2, can be achieved. Through the non-linear interaction of the optical penetration in the focal region a material separation in a process known as photo-disruption is introduced. By limiting the laser pulse durations to the femtoseconds range, the energy expended at the target region is precisely controlled, thereby limiting the interaction zone of the cut to under a micrometre. External to this zone the ultra-short beam application time introduces minimal to no thermal damage to the remainder of the sample. The laser radiation is directed onto a fast scanning mirror-based optical system, which allows three-dimensional positioning of the beam crossover, whilst allowing beam traversal to the desired region of interest. The combination of high power with a high raster rate allows the scanner to cut large areas of sample in a short time. In the laser microtome the laser-microdissection of internal areas in tissues, cellular structures, and other types of small features is also possible. Knives A diamond knife blade used for cutting ultrathin sections (typically 70 to 350 nm) for transmission electron microscopy. The cutting edge of a disposable blade for a microtome under a microscope. The selection of microtome knife blade profile depends upon the material and preparation of the samples, as well as the final sample requirements (e.g. cut thickness and quality). Design and cut types Profiles of microtome knives. Generally, knives are characterized by the profile of the knife blade, which falls under the categories of planar concave, wedge shaped or chisel shaped designs. Planar concave microtome knives are extremely sharp, but are also very delicate and are therefore only used with very soft samples. The wedge profile knives are somewhat more stable and find use in moderately hard materials, such as in epoxy or cryogenic sample cutting. Finally, the chisel profile with its blunt edge, raises the stability of the knife, whilst requiring significantly more force to achieve the cut. For ultramicrotomes, glass and diamond knives are required, the cut breadth of the blade is therefore on the order of a few millimetres and is therefore significantly smaller than for classical microtome knives. Glass knives are usually manufactured by the fracture of glass bars using special \\"knife-maker\\" fracturing devices. Glass knives may be used for initial sample preparations even where diamond knives may be used for final sectioning. Glass knives usually have small troughs, made with plastic tape, which are filled with water to allow the sample to float for later collection. Diamond blades may be built into such an existing trough, allowing for the same collection method. Sectioning Prior to cutting by microtome, biological materials are usually placed in a more rigid fixative, in a process known as embedding. This is achieved by the inflow of a liquid substance around the sample, such as paraffin (wax) or epoxy, which is placed in a mold and later hardened to produce a \\"block\\" which is readily cut. The declination is the angle of contact between the sample vertical and knife blade. If the knife blade is at right angles (declination=90) the cut is made directly using a pressure based mode, and the forces are therefore proportionally larger. If the knife is tilted, however, the relative motion of the knife is increasingly parallel to sample motion, allowing for a slicing action. This behaviour is very important for large or hard samples The inclination of the knife is the angle between the knife face and the sample. For an optimal result, this angle must be chosen appropriately. The optimal angle depends upon the knife geometry, the cut speed and many other parameters. If the angle is adjusted to zero, the knife cut can often become erratic, and a new location of the knife must be used to smooth this out. If the angle is too large, the sample can crumple and the knife can induce periodic thickness variations in the cut. By further increasing the angle such that it is too large one can damage the knife blade itself.

It was the first Soviet aircraft to be equipped with an afterburning turbojet, the Klimov RD-10F that was derived from the German Jumo 004 engine. Only two examples were built as it was rejected for service by the Soviet Air Force. Development and description In April 1946, the Council of People's Commissars ordered several design bureaux (OKB ‚Äì Opytnoye Konstruktorskoye Buro), included that of Alexander Yakovlev, to develop a single-seat jet fighter to be equipped with a single Lyulka TR-1 turbojet engine. The aircraft should have a maximum speed of at sea level and a speed of at an altitude of . It should be able to climb to that altitude in 3.8 minutes or less and should have a maximum range of no less than . Yakovlev and his team were well aware that any derivative of their earlier Yak-15 and Yak-17 fighters, then under development, could not reach the required speed because of their thick wings and chose to begin a \\"clean-slate\\" design. Preliminary work used the same \\"pod-and-boom\\" layout as had been used in the earlier Yakovlev designs, although the cockpit was located in front of the engine. The TR-1 engine was plagued by delays and Yakovlev devoted most of his efforts to designs that used the RD-10.Gordon & Kommissarov, pp. 212‚Äì18 By late June, Yakovlev had decided to use a more aerodynamically efficient \\"tubular\\" layout with the engine buried in the center of the fuselage. After it became clear that neither the TR-1, nor the imported British Rolls-Royce Nene or Rolls-Royce Derwent engines would be available to power the prototypes, Yakovlev settled on the newly available afterburning version of the RD-10. The first prototype was ordered to a very demanding schedule and was completed on 29 November 1946.Gordon & Kommissarov, pp. 218‚Äì21 The Yak-19 had an flattened oval-shaped, metal semi-monocoque fuselage with the single-seat cockpit and its teardrop-shaped canopy positioned just forward of the axial-flow RD-10F turbojet engine. Its air intake was in the nose and the afterburner was positioned at the rear of the fuselage, just below the tail structure. Fitted with tricycle landing gear, the main landing gear retracted inwards into the fuselage while the nose gear retracted forwards. The laminar-flow, two-spar, straight wing was mounted in the middle of the fuselage. It was equipped with modified Fowler flaps and Frise ailerons. The rudder was split into two sections by the horizontal stabilizers; the upper portion was fabric-covered while the lower half was metal-skinned. The pilot was protected by a bulletproof windscreen, a forward armor plate and an armored seat back. In addition, he was provided with an ejection seat. The Yak-19 was equipped with four fuel tanks in the fuselage that had a total capacity of of fuel. It was armed with two Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon, each with 70 rounds.Gordon & Kommissarov, pp. 221‚Äì23 Testing The day after the first prototype was completed, it was trucked to Khodynka Field to begin taxiing trials. On 12 December it caught fire when a defective fuel gasket blew out; the repairs took a fortnight. Immediately before its maiden flight, a pair of experimental 23 mm Shpitalny Sh-3 autocannon replaced the NS-23s. It first flew on 8 January 1947 with Lieutenant Colonel Mikhail Ivanov, at the controls, although he was not the primary test pilot. The Yak-19 was grounded from 2 March to 18 May as it awaited a new engine. On 21 May, the afterburner was tested in flight for the first time. While the fighter was the first Soviet aircraft to be equipped with an afterburner, it was not the first one to use one in flight as the Aircraft 156 had done so over a month earlier. The second prototype first flew on 6 June and was almost identical with the first prototype. Changes included five degrees of dihedral to the horizontal stabilizer, a slightly revised vertical stabilizer and plumbing for a pair of drop tanks underneath the wingtips. This increased the fighter's total fuel load to .Gordon & Kommissarov, pp. 223‚Äì25 During the manufacturer's flight tests, the Yak-19 became the first Soviet aircraft to exceed 900 km/h. Major Sergei Anokhin was the primary test pilot and reported that the aircraft had pleasant and predictable flying characteristics and presented no difficulties for the average pilot. Before the testing was completed, Anokhin led the jets participating in the flypast at Tushino Airfield on 3 August.Gordon & Kommissarov, p. 225 State acceptance tests began on 17 October, using the second prototype, and finished on 30 January 1948. The group of military test pilots concluded that the afterburner was unreliable and the aircraft was difficult to control in roll. Other complaints were focused on the cockpit; it was deemed was too small and lacked sufficient armor and heating or ventilation. They decided that the Yak-19 could not be recommended for service. Rather than modify the aircraft to address these problems, Yakovlev chose to cancel it entirely in favor of designs using the more-powerful () Rolls-Royce Derwent-derived Klimov RD-500, like his Yak-23 and Yak-25 fighters then under development.Gordon & Kommissarov, pp. 227‚Äì29 Specifications (Yak-19) right See alsoNotesBibliography * Gordon, Yefim & Kommissarov, Dmitry.

An immense double fugue, it was universally condemned by contemporary music critics. A reviewer writing for the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung in 1826 described the fugue as \\"incomprehensible, like Chinese\\" and \\"a confusion of Babel\\".Solomon (2003), p. 35 However, critical opinion of the work has risen steadily since the early 20th century and it is now considered among Beethoven's greatest achievements. Igor Stravinsky described it as \\"an absolutely contemporary piece of music that will be contemporary forever.\\"Stravinsky and Craft (1963), p. 24. The composition originally served as the final movement of Beethoven's Quartet No. 13 in B major, Op. 130, written in 1825; but his publisher was concerned about the dismal commercial prospects of the piece and wanted Beethoven to replace the fugue with a new finale. Beethoven complied, and the Grosse Fuge was published separately in 1827 as Op. 133. It was composed when Beethoven was almost completely deaf, and is considered to be part of his set of late quartets. It was first performed in 1826, as the finale of the B quartet, by the Schuppanzigh Quartet. Music analysts and critics have described the Grosse Fuge as \\"inaccessible\\",B.H.

History of the composition Beethoven originally wrote the fugue as the final movement of his String Quartet No. 13, Op. 130. His choice of a fugal form for the last movement was well grounded in tradition: Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven himself had previously used fugues as final movements of quartets. But in recent years, Beethoven had become increasingly concerned with the challenge of integrating this Baroque form into the Classical structure. \\"In my student days I wrote dozens of [fugues] ... but [imagination] also wishes to exert its privileges ... and a new and really poetic element must be introduced into the traditional form,\\" Beethoven wrote.Alexander Wheelock Thayer: Ludwig van Beethovens Leben. quoted in Husarik (2012), p. 54. The resulting movement was a mammoth work, longer than the five other movements of the quartet together.The fugue is 741 measures long; the total number of measures in the other movements is 643. The fugue is dedicated to the Archduke Rudolf of Austria, his student and patron. Karl Holz, violinist and confidant of Beethoven in his last years. Holz was second violinist in the Schuppanzigh String Quartet, which debuted the Grosse Fuge. Holz was charged with the task of convincing Beethoven to separate the fugue from the rest of the quartet, Op. 130. At the first performance of the quartet, other movements were received enthusiastically, but the fugue was not a success. Many musicians and critics in Vienna's music periodicals denounced the fugue.Solomon (2003), p. 35 Composer and violinist Louis Spohr called it, and the other late quartets, \\"an indecipherable, uncorrected horror\\".Service (2008) Despite the contemporary criticism, Beethoven himself never doubted the value of the fugue. Karl Holz, Beethoven's secretary, confidant and second violinist of the Schuppanzigh Quartet that performed the work, brought Beethoven the news that the audience had demanded encores of two middle movements. Beethoven, enraged, was reported to have growled, \\"And why didn't they encore the Fugue? That alone should have been repeated! Cattle! Asses!\\"Solomon (1977) p. 447 However, the fugue was so roundly condemned by critics and audience alike that Beethoven's publisher, Matthias Artaria (1793‚Äì1835), decided to try to convince Beethoven to publish it separately. Artaria tasked Holz with persuading Beethoven to separate the fugue from the rest of the quartet. Holz wrote: > Artaria ... charged me with the terrible and difficult task of convincing > Beethoven to compose a new finale, which would be more accessible to the > listeners as well as the instrumentalists, to substitute for the fugue which > was so difficult to understand.

Some historians have speculated that he likely did it for the money (Beethoven was extremely bad at managing his personal finances and was often broke), while others believe it was to satisfy his critics, or simply because Beethoven came to feel the fugue stood best on its own.For the differing opinions on this, see Solomon (1977), p. 449, Marliave (1928), p. 257, Winter and Martin (1994), p. 239. The fugue is connected to the other movements of Opus 130 by various hints of motifs, and by a tonal link to the preceding Cavatina movement (the Cavatina ends on a G, and the fugue begins with the same GBitloch (2012)). The replacement final movement is relatively light in character and completely uncontroversial. Beethoven composed this replacement in late 1826, and it was the last complete piece of music he was to write. In May 1827, about two months after Beethoven's death, Matthias Artaria published the first edition of Op. 130 with the new finale, the Grosse Fuge separately (with the French title Grande Fugue) as Op. 133, and a four-hand piano arrangement of the fugue as Op. 134.Lockwood (2006), pp. 459‚Äì461 General analysis Dozens of analyses have attempted to delve into the structure of the Grosse Fuge, with conflicting results. The work has been described as an expansion of the formal Baroque grand fugue,Kirkendale (1963) as a multi- movement work rolled into a single piece,Rosen (1972), Levy (2008) and as a symphonic poem in sonata form.Radcliffe (1978) Stephen Husarik has suggested that the relationships between the keys of the different sections of the fugue mirror what he describes as the wedge-like structure of the eight-note motif that is the main fugal subject, the \\"contour [that] is a driving force behind the Grosse Fuge\\".Husarik (2012) But Leah Gayle Weinberg writes: \\"The Grosse Fuge has been and continues to be a problematic subject of scholarly discussion for many reasons; the most basic is that its very form defies categorization.\\" Main motif The central motif of the fugue is an eight- note subject that climbs chromatically upward: : { \\\\relative c { \\\\time 6/8 \\\\key bes \\\\major g2. gis f' e gis, a fis' g } } A similar motif appears in Act II, measures 44‚Äì47, of the \\"Dance of the Blessed Spirits\\" from Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice (1774), and also in Haydn's String Quartet in G, Op. 33, No. 5. ii, mm. 27‚Äì29.Husarik, p. 255 Another similar subject, with syncopated or gapped rhythm (called Unterbrechung in German), appears in a treatise on counterpoint by Johann Georg Albrechtsberger,Kirkendale, p. 18. who taught Beethoven composition. Joseph Kerman suggests that Beethoven modeled the motif after J. S. Bach's fugue in B minor from The Well-Tempered Clavier.Kerman (2008), p. 167. Its subject is shown below: : { \\\\relative c' { \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 96 \\\\time 4/4 \\\\key b \\\\minor r8 fis( d b) g'( fis) b( ais) e( dis) c'( b) fis( eis) d'( cis!) bis( cis( a fis) gis2\\\\trill } } Whatever the origin of the motif, Beethoven was fascinated by it. He used it, or fragments of it, in a number of places in the late quartets, most notably in the first movement of his Op. 132 string quartet. The opening is shown below: : { << ew StaffGroup << ew Staff << \\\\tempo \\"Assai sostenuto\\" \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\key a \\\\minor \\\\time 2/2 R1 R dis2(\\\\pp e c'\\\\< b\\\\>) gis'(\\\\pp a b c) c\\\\<( b\\\\>) dis,(\\\\pp e4_\\\\markup { \\\\italic cresc. } f) \\\\bar \\"\\" } >> ew Staff << \\\\clef treble \\\\key a \\\\minor \\\\time 2/2 ew Voice \\\\relative c' { R1 r2 b(\\\\pp a gis) \\\\<( gis'\\\\>) d(\\\\pp c f! ) a\\\\<( gis\\\\>) f4(\\\\pp fis gis_\\\\markup { \\\\italic cresc. } ) } >> ew Staff << \\\\clef alto \\\\key a \\\\minor \\\\time 2/2 ew Voice \\\\relative c' { R1 a2(\\\\pp gis) c( b dis,\\\\< e)\\\\> b(\\\\pp c) d,( c) fis,(\\\\< gis)\\\\> a(\\\\pp gis4)_\\\\markup { \\\\italic cresc. } } >> ew Staff << \\\\clef bass \\\\key a \\\\minor \\\\time 2/2 ew Voice \\\\relative c { gis2\\\\pp( a f' e) R1 R1 f2(\\\\pp e gis, a) dis,\\\\<( e\\\\> c')\\\\pp b4_\\\\markup { \\\\italic cresc. } b } >> >> >> } In the course of the Grosse Fuge, Beethoven plays this motif in every possible variation: fortissimo and pianissimo, in different rhythms, upside down and backwards. The usual practice in a traditional fugue is to make a simple, unadorned statement of the subject at the outset, but Beethoven from the very beginning presents the subject in a host of variations.  Other motifs  In stark contrast to this simple chromatic motif is the second subject of the fugue, which leaps dramatically in huge intervals ‚Äì tenths and twelfths: : { \\\\relative c' { \\\\set Score.currentBarNumber = #31 \\\\time 4/4 \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\partial2 r8. d16\\\\ff f'8[ r16 f] f8[ r16 d,] f'8[ r16 f] f8[ r16 d,] aes8[ r16 aes] aes8[ r16 g] g8[ r16 f] f8[ r16 es] es8[ r16 d] es8[ r16 es,] es'8[ r16 es] es8[ r16 es,] g'8[ r16 g] g8[ r16 f] f8[ r16 es] es8[ r16 d] d8 } } The third motif is a lilting melody that serves as the theme of the andante section of the fugue: : { \\\\relative c { \\\\set Score.currentBarNumber = #167 \\\\time 2/4 \\\\key ges \\\\major \\\\bar \\"\\" r8 bes16(_\\\\markup { \\\\italic sempre \\\\dynamic pp } aes) aes( ges des' ces) ces( bes es des) des( ces des bes) des( ces es des) des( ces des bes) bes( aes ges f es des es ces) bes8 } } A fourth element ‚Äì not so much a motif as an effect ‚Äì is the trill. Beethoven also uses trills extensively, simultaneously creating a sense of disintegration of the motifs, leading to a climax. : { #(set-global-staff-size 19) << ew StaffGroup << ew Staff << \\\\set Score.currentBarNumber = #700 \\\\clef treble \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\time 6/8 \\\\bar \\"\\" \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 a!2.~ a4.(\\\\< bes4)! r8 \\\\mark #13 r4. f4.~\\\\<\\\\startTrillSpan f4( e16\\\\stopTrillSpan f) d4! r8 r4. a'~\\\\< a( bes4)! r8 r4. f4.~\\\\<\\\\startTrillSpan f4( e16\\\\stopTrillSpan f) d4! r8 } >> ew Staff << \\\\clef treble \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\time 6/8 ew Voice \\\\relative c' { f4.( es) c'!\\\\<( bes4!) r8 r4. c,~\\\\<\\\\startTrillSpan c4( bes16\\\\stopTrillSpan c) d4! r8 r4. c'~\\\\< c( bes4!) r8 r4. c,~\\\\<\\\\startTrillSpan c4( bes16\\\\stopTrillSpan c) d4! r8 } >> ew Staff << \\\\clef alto \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\time 6/8 ew Voice \\\\relative c { f4.( c') es(\\\\< d4)! r8 r4. a!~\\\\<\\\\startTrillSpan a4( g!16\\\\stopTrillSpan a) bes4! r8 r4. es~\\\\< es( d4)! r8 r4. a~\\\\<\\\\startTrillSpan a4( g16\\\\stopTrillSpan a) bes4! r8 } >> ew Staff << \\\\clef bass \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\time 6/8 ew Voice \\\\relative c, { f2.~\\\\startTrillSpan f4(\\\\< e16\\\\stopTrillSpan f) bes4! r8 R2.

The D'Indy analysis is considered the classic analysis. which starts with a dramatic fortissimo unison G, and statement of the main fugal subject in the key of G major:Musical examples are from the recording of the Fugue by the Merel quartet (Mary Ellen Woodside and Julia Schr√∂der, Violins, Ylvali Zilliacus, Viola' Rafael Rosenfeld, Cello), live in performance at Tonhalle Z√ºrich, 3/7/2013. : { << ew StaffGroup << ew Staff << \\\\tempo Allegro \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\time 6/8 \\\\grace { g16 g' } g'2.~\\\\f g4.\\\\fermata g,4.~\\\\ff g2.~ g gis\\\\sf f'\\\\sf e\\\\sf gis,\\\\sf a4 r8 fis'!4 r8 \\\\afterGrace g!4\\\\trill { fis16 g } r8 r4.\\\\fermata } >> ew Staff << \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\grace { s16 s } 2.~\\\\f 4.\\\\fermata g4.~\\\\ff g2.~ g gis\\\\sf f'\\\\sf e\\\\sf gis,\\\\sf a4 r8 fis'!4 r8 \\\\afterGrace g!4\\\\trill { fis16 g } r8 r4.\\\\fermata } >> ew Staff << \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef alto \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\grace { s16 s } 2.~\\\\f 4.\\\\fermata g4.~\\\\ff g2.~ g gis\\\\sf f'\\\\sf e\\\\sf gis,\\\\sf a4 r8 fis'!4 r8 \\\\afterGrace g!4\\\\trill { fis16 g } r8 r4.\\\\fermata } >> ew Staff << \\\\relative c { \\\\clef bass \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\grace { s16 s } 2.~\\\\f 4.\\\\fermata g4.~\\\\ff g2.~ g gis\\\\sf f'\\\\sf e\\\\sf gis,\\\\sf a4 r8 fis'!4 r8 \\\\afterGrace g!4\\\\trill { fis16 g } r8 r4.\\\\fermata } >> >> >> } This statement of the subject disintegrates into a trill, and silence. Beethoven then repeats the subject, but in a completely different rhythm, in diminution (meaning at double the tempo), twice, climbing up the scale; and then, again silence, and again the subject, this time unadorned, in a dramatic drop to pianissimo in the key of F major. Second statement of motif This leads to a statement of the third fugal subject, with the first subject in the bass: Third motif introduced Thus, Beethoven, in this brief introduction, presents not only the material that will make up the entire piece but also the spirit: violent shifts of mood, melodies disintegrating into chaos, dramatic silences, instability, and struggle. First fugue Following the overture is a strictly formal double fugue in the key of B major that follows all the rules of a Baroque fugue: an exposition and three variations, showcasing different contrapuntal devices. But this is anything but a tame Baroque fugue: it is violent and dissonant, pitting awkward leaps of the second subject in iambic rhythm against the main subject in syncopation, at a constant dynamic that never falls below forte. The resulting angular rhythmic confusion and displaced dissonances last almost five minutes. First, Beethoven restates the main subject, broken up by rests between each note: Syncopated statement of motif Then begins a double fugue, two subjects, played one against the other. The second subject in the first violin, and the first subject, syncopated, in the viola. Then the second violin and cello take up the same thing. First fugue, exposition The first variation, following the rules of fugue, opens in the subdominant key of E. Beethoven adds to the chaos with a triplet figure in the first violin, played against the quaternary rhythm of the second subject in the second violin and the syncopated main subject in the viola. First fugue, first variation The second variation, back in the key of B, is a stretto section, meaning that the fugal voices enter one right after the other. To this, Beethoven adds a countersubject in dactylic rhythm (shown in red below). : { #(set-global-staff-size 16) << ew StaffGroup << ew Staff << \\\\set Score.currentBarNumber = #109 \\\\clef treble \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 \\\\bar \\"\\" \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 \\\\mark #3 d4 r r2 r8. g,,16 bes8[ r16 bes] aes8 r a r bes, bes'~\\\\ff bes r r bes~\\\\f bes r r b~\\\\f b r r g'~\\\\f g r r8 } >> ew Staff << \\\\clef treble \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 ew Voice \\\\relative c { d4 r r8. g,,16 bes8[ r16 bes] a8[ r16 bes] d8[ r16 d] ces8 r c r \\\\override NoteHead.color = #red bes f16( es d8-.) d16( c bes8-.) aes'16( g f8-.) es16( d c8-.) d16( es d8-.) es16( f g8-.) r16 c,, es'8[ r16 es] es8 } >> ew Staff << \\\\clef alto \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 ew Voice \\\\relative c { d8 r16 d' f8[ r16 f] es!8 r e r f8 r16 f, f8[ r16 e] f8 r es8 r d4 r r2 r2 r8 aes16( g f8-.) es16( d c-.) } >> ew Staff << \\\\clef bass \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 ew Voice \\\\relative c { d4 r r2 r2 \\\\clef tenor r8. d16 f'8[ r16 f] f8[ r16 d,] f'8[ r16 f] f8[ r16 d,] aes8[ r16 aes] g8[ r16 g] g8[ r16 f] es8[ f16( es] d8-.) c16( b c8-.) } >> >> >> } In the third variation, Beethoven presents a variation of the second subject in the triplet rhythm of the countersubject of the first variation, with the main subject syncopated in eighth notes, in diminution (that is, the subject is played at twice the speed). First fugue, third variation This last variation grows increasingly chaotic, with triplets breaking out in the inner voices, until it ultimately collapses ‚Äì each instrument finishing on a different part of the measure and ending inconclusively on a final fermata, leading to the next section in the key of G. Meno mosso e moderato This section (\\"less forceful and at a moderate pace\\") is a complete change of character from the formal fugue that preceded it and the one that follows it. It is a fugato, a section that combines contrapuntal writing with homophony. \\"After the strenuousness of the B Fugue [first section], the effect is of an almost blinding innocence,\\" writes Joseph Kerman.Kerman (1979), p. 287 Analysts who see the fugue as a multi-movement work rolled into one view this as the traditional Andante movement.See, for example, Kinderman (1995) or Kirkendale (1963) It opens with a statement of the third subject, against a pedal tone in the viola, and continues with the third subject in the second violin, against the main subject cantus firmus in the viola. Opening of fugato section The counterpoint becomes more complex, with the cello and first violin playing the main subject in canon while the second violin and viola pass the third subject between them. : { #(set-global-staff-size 14) << ew StaffGroup << ew Staff << \\\\set Score.currentBarNumber = #193 \\\\bar \\"\\" \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key ges \\\\major \\\\time 2/4 f16( es f ges aes8) r r4 \\\\override NoteHead.color = #red d,( es ces'! bes es, e des'! c e, f) \\\\override NoteHead.color = #black des'16( c des bes) } >> ew Staff << \\\\clef treble \\\\key ges \\\\major \\\\time 2/4 ew Voice \\\\relative c' { f16( ges f es) es( des aes' ges) ges( f ces' bes) aes( ges aes f) aes( ges f es) f8 r bes, r bes'16( a bes g) bes( g f e) g8 r c r des16( c des bes) bes( a g f) bes( a bes g) } >> ew Staff << \\\\clef alto \\\\key ges \\\\major \\\\time 2/4 ew Voice \\\\relative c { des'16( bes aes ges) ges( f f' es) aes,8 r r4 r aes16( ges aes f) aes( ges f es) g8 r g' r bes,16( a bes g) bes( a g f) bes( a bes g) g( c bes a) e4( } >> ew Staff << \\\\clef bass \\\\key ges \\\\major \\\\time 2/4 ew Voice \\\\relative c, { r4 \\\\override NoteHead.color = #red des( d ces'! bes d, es des'! c e, f2) \\\\override NoteHead.color = #black f2( } >> >> >> } Despite the growing complexity of the fugal writing, Beethoven instructs the players sempre piano ‚Äì always quiet. Leonard Ratner writes of this section, \\"[This] comes as a wonderful change of color, offered with the silkiest of textures, and with exquisite moments of glowing diatonism.\\"Ratner (1995), p. 288 The polyphony gradually dissipates into homophony, and from there into unison, finally tapering into a dying, measured sixteenth-note tremolo, when the next section bursts in in the key of B. Conclusion of fugato section Interlude and second fugue Beethoven shifts gears: from G to B, from to , from pianissimo to fortissimo. The fortissimo descends immediately to piano, for a short interlude before the second fugue. This interlude is based on the main subject in diminution, meaning in double time. On top of this, Beethoven adds a lilting, slightly comic melody; analysts who see the fugue as a multi-movement work consider this section the equivalent of a scherzo.See Kinderman (1995) or Kirkendale (1963) Interlude before second fugue In this interlude, Beethoven introduces the use of trill (hinted at at the end of the Meno mosso section). The music grows in intensity and shifts into A major, for a new learned fugue. In this fugue, Beethoven puts together three versions of the main subject: (1) the subject in its simple form, but in augmentation (meaning half the speed); (2) the same subject, abbreviated, in retrograde (that is, played backwards); and (3) a variation of the first half of the subject in diminution (that is, double time). Together, they sound like this: : { #(set-global-staff-size 17) << ew StaffGroup << ew Staff << \\\\set Score.currentBarNumber = #280 \\\\bar \\"\\" \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key aes \\\\major \\\\time 6/8 R2.

Kerman writes of this fugal section, \\"The piece seems to be in danger of cracking under the tension of its own rhythmic fury.\\"Kerman (1979), p. 283 In the second episode of this fugue, Beethoven adds in the triplet figure from the first variation of the first fugue: Second fugue, first variation The trills become more intense. In the third episode, in the dominant key of E major, Beethoven uses a leaping motif that recalls the second subject of the first fugue: Second fugue, second variation The fourth episode returns to the key of A. The cello plays the main subject in a way that harks back to the overtura. More elements of the first fugue return: the syncopation used for the main subject, the tenth leaps from the second subject, the diminuted main subject in the viola. Second fugue, third variation Thematic convergence and coda This leads back to a restatement of the meno mosso e moderato section. This time, though, instead of a silky pianissimo, the fugato is played forte, heavily accented (Beethoven writes on every sixteenth-note group), march-like. Analysts who see the fugue as a variation of sonata-allegro form consider this to be part of the recapitulation section. In this section, Beethoven uses another complex contrapuntal device: the second violin plays the theme, the first violin plays the main subject in a high register, and the viola plays the main subject in inversion ‚Äì that is, upside down.Kirkendale, p. 21. : { #(set-global-staff- size 16) << ew StaffGroup << ew Staff << \\\\set Score.currentBarNumber = #493 \\\\bar \\"\\" \\\\tempo \\"Meno Mosso e moderato\\" \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key aes \\\\major \\\\time 2/4 r4 d\\\\sf es\\\\sf des'!\\\\sf c\\\\f g\\\\f aes\\\\f ges'\\\\f f\\\\f a,\\\\f bes\\\\f aes'!\\\\f g\\\\f } >> ew Staff << \\\\clef treble \\\\key aes \\\\major \\\\time 2/4 ew Voice \\\\relative c { bes16( aes c bes) bes( aes bes' aes) aes(\\\\sf g c bes) bes(\\\\sf aes g f) f(\\\\f es aes c,) f(\\\\f es f des) des(\\\\f c bes aes) aes(\\\\f ges f es) es(\\\\f des c des) ges'(\\\\f f ges es) es(\\\\f des c bes aes\\\\f g! aes f) f(\\\\f es d! es) } >> ew Staff << \\\\clef alto \\\\key aes \\\\major \\\\time 2/4 ew Voice \\\\relative c' { 8\\\\f r f4\\\\sf es\\\\sf g,\\\\sf aes\\\\f bes\\\\f aes\\\\f c,\\\\f des\\\\f c'\\\\f bes\\\\f d,!\\\\f es\\\\f } >> ew Staff << \\\\clef bass \\\\key aes \\\\major \\\\time 2/4 ew Voice \\\\relative c { aes8\\\\f r r4 r16 aes aes aes aes aes,, aes aes aes8 r r4 r16 c,,, es' es es c, es' es des,8 r r4 r16 des f' f f d, f' f es,8 r } >> >> >> } A series of trills leads back to the home key of B, and a restatement of the scherzo section. Recapitulation of scherzo section There follows a section that analysts have described as \\"uneasy hesitation\\"D'Indy in Cobbett (1929), p. 104. or \\"puzzling\\" and \\"diffused\\".Winter and Martin (1994), pp. 243‚Äì4 Fragments of the various subjects appear and disappear, and the music seems to lose energy. A silence, and then a fragmentary burst of the opening of the first fugue. Another silence. A snippet of the meno mosso. Another silence. And then a fortissimo restatement of the very opening of the piece, leading to the coda.Most analysts consider this unison the beginning of the coda, though Beethoven himself, in the autograph copy, writes \\"Coda\\" at bar 493 (key change to B). Fragments of preceding sections, before the coda From here the music moves forward, at first haltingly, but then with more and more energy, to the final passage, where the first subject is played in triplets below the soaring violin line playing a variant of the second subject. Finale  Understanding the Grosse Fuge  Analyses of the Grosse Fuge help to understand the structure and contrapuntal devices of this mammoth piece. But, writes musicologist David B. Levy, \\"Regardless of how one hears the piece structurally, the composition remains filled with paradoxes that leave the listener ultimately dissatisfied with an exegesis derived solely from a structural perspective.\\"Levy (2007) Since its composition, musicians, critics and listeners have tried to explain the tremendous impact this piece has.For a summary of attempts at understanding the fugue, see Kirkendale, pp 14 ‚Äì 18. Lithograph of Beethoven on his deathbed, by Josef Danhauser \\"[It] is one of the great artistic testaments to the human capacity for meaning in the face of the threat of chaos. Abiding faith in the relevance of visionary struggle in our lives powerfully informs the structure and character of the music,\\" writes Mark Steinberg, violinist of the Brentano String Quartet. \\"More than anything else in music ... it justifies the ways of God to men,\\" writes musicologist Leonard Ratner.Ratner (1995). Ratner attributes this quote to J. W. N. Sullivan's book Beethoven: His Spiritual Development (1927); however, the quote (a paraphrase from John Milton's Paradise Lost) does not appear in Sullivan. But beyond a recognition of the hugeness and almost mystical impact of the music, critics fail to agree on its character.For a review of the divergent opinions on the fugue, see also Kirkendale, pp 14‚Äì18. Robert S. Kahn says \\"it presents a titanic struggle overcome.\\"Kahn (2010) Daniel Chua, on the contrary, writes, \\"The work speaks of failure, the very opposite of the triumphant synthesis associated with Beethovenian recapitulations.\\"Chua (1995), p. 240 Stephen Husarik, in his essay \\"Musical direction and the wedge in Beethoven's high comedy, Grosse Fuge op. 133\\", contends that in the fugue, Beethoven is actually writing a parody of Baroque formalism. \\"The B Fuga of op.133 stumbles forward in what is probably the most relentless and humorous assertion of modal rhythms since 12th century Notre Dame organum.\\"Husarik (2012), p. 58 Kahn disagrees: \\"... the comparison to comic music is surprising. There is nothing comic about the Grosse Fuge ....\\"Kahn (2010) In many discussions of the piece, the issue of struggle is central. Sara Bitloch, violinist of the Elias String Quartet, says this sense of struggle informs her group's interpretation of the fugue. \\"Every part has to feel like it's a huge struggle ... You need to finish the Grosse Fuge absolutely exhausted.\\"Bitloch (2012) She calls the piece \\"apocalyptic\\". Arnold Steinhardt of the Guarneri String Quartet calls it \\"Armageddon ... the chaos out of which life itself evolved\\".Steinhardt, in Miller (2006), p. 40 One way to express the impact of the fugue is through poetry. In her poem \\"Little Fugue\\", Sylvia Plath associates the fugue with death, in a melange of hazy associations with the yew tree (a symbol of death in Celtic Britain), the Holocaust, and the death of her own father:Sylvia Plath, Collected Poems (1981) Turtleback Books The poet Mark Doty wrote of his feelings on listening to the Grosse Fuge:Mark Doty, \\"Grosse Fuge\\" in Atlantis (1995) Harper Perennial, Reception and musical influence After the first performance as the original finale to the op. 130 quartet in 1826, the fugue is not known to have been performed in public again until 1853 in Paris by the Maurin Quartet.Winter and Martin (1994), p. 239 One hundred years after its publication, it still had not entered the standard quartet repertoire. \\"The attitude of mind in which most people listen to chamber music must undergo a radical change\\" to understand this piece, wrote Joseph de Marliave more than a century after its publication.de Marliave (1928), p. 220 \\"This fugue is one of the two works by Beethoven‚Äîthe other being the fugue from the piano sonata, Op. 106‚Äîwhich should be excluded from performance.\\" As late as 1947, Daniel Gregory Mason called the fugue \\"repellent\\".Kerman (1979), p. 294 By the 1920s, some string quartets were including the fugue in their programs.Winter and Martin (1994), p. 239 Since then, the fugue has steadily gained greatness in the eyes of musicians and performers. \\"The Great Fugue ... now seems to me the most perfect miracle in music,\\" said Igor Stravinsky.Kirkendale, p. 14. \\"It is also the most absolutely contemporary piece of music I know, and contemporary forever ... Hardly birthmarked by its age, the Great Fugue is, in rhythm alone, more subtle than any music of my own century ... I love it beyond everything.\\" Pianist Glenn Gould said, \\"For me, the 'Grosse Fuge' is not only the greatest work Beethoven ever wrote but just about the most astonishing piece in musical literature.\\"Page, p. 459 Some analysts and musicians see the fugue as a first assault on the diatonic tonal system that prevailed in Classical music. Robert Kahn sees the main subject of the fugue as a precursor of the tone row,Kahn (2010), p. 155 the basis of the twelve-tone system developed by Arnold Schoenberg. \\"Your cradle was Beethoven's Grosse Fuge,\\" artist Oskar Kokoschka wrote to Schoenberg in a letter. Composer Alfred Schnittke quotes the subject in his third string quartet (1983). There have also been numerous orchestral arrangements of the fugue, including by conductors Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler and Felix Weingartner. Performance challenges Performers approaching the Grosse Fuge face a host of technical and musical challenges. Among the technical difficulties of the piece are difficult passagework, complex cross-rhythms that require exact synchronization, and problems of intonation, where the harmonies pass from dissonance to resolution.For a description of some of the technical difficulties of the piece, see Rehearsal Notes at IMSLP, or . Once mastering the technical difficulties, there are many interpretive issues to resolve.For a discussion of some of the musical issues posed by the fugue, see . One of these is whether the fugue should be played as the finale of Opus 130, as originally written, or as a separate piece.For further discussion of this see Solomon (1978) p. 448, , Griffiths (1983), p. 106. Playing the fugue as the final movement of Opus 130, rather than the light, Haydnesque replacement movement, completely changes the character of the quartet, analysts Robert Winter and Robert Martin note.Winter and Martin (1994), p. 238. The word \\"Haydnesque\\" is theirs. Played with the new finale, the preceding movement, the \\"Cavatina\\", a heartfelt and intense aria, is the emotional center of the piece. Played with the fugue as the finale, the Cavatina is a prelude to the massive and compelling fugue. On the other hand, the fugue stands alone well. \\"Current taste is decisively in favor of the fugal finale,\\" conclude Winter and Martin.Winter and Martin (1994), p. 238. A number of quartets have recorded Opus 130 with the fugue and the replacement finale on separate disks. A second issue facing performers is whether to choose a \\"learned\\" interpretation ‚Äì one that clarifies the complex contrapuntal structure of the piece ‚Äì or one that focuses primarily on the dramatic impulses of the music.Bitloch. Also see Arnold Steinhardt in Miller (2006), p. 40, . \\"Beethoven had taken a form that is basically an intellectual form, where the emotions take second place, compared to the structure, and he has completely turned that around, writing one of the most emotionally charged pieces ever,\\" says Sara Bitloch of the Elias Quartet.Bitloch \\"As a performer that's a particularly difficult balance to find ... Our first approach was to find a kind of hierarchy in the themes ... but we found that when we do that we're really missing the point of the piece.\\"  Tied eighth notes  After deciding on the overall approach to the music, there are numerous local decisions to be made about how to play particular passages.For discussion of specific interpretive issues in the fugue, see also , Rehearsal Notes (IMSLP), Winter and Martin (1994), pp. 239‚Äì244. One issue concerns the peculiar notation that Beethoven uses in the syncopated presentation of the main subject ‚Äì first in the overtura but later throughout the piece. Rather than writing this as a series of quarter notes, he writes two tied eighth notes.Grosse Fuge, International edition, measures 26‚Äì30. : { \\\\relative c' { \\\\time 4/4 \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\tempo Allegro \\\\set Score.currentBarNumber = #26 \\\\bar \\"\\" r4 bes8(\\\\pp bes) r4 bes8( bes) r4 b8(_\\\\markup { \\\\italic sempre \\\\dynamic pp } b) r4 aes'8( aes) r4 g8( g) r4 b,8( b) r4 c8( c) a'[( bes]) bes[( bes]) a( a) r4\\\\fermata } } Musicologists have tried to explain what Beethoven meant by this: David Levy has written an entire article on the notation,Levy (2007) and Stephen Husarik looked to the history of Baroque ornamentation for an explanation.Husarik, Speck. p. 261. Husarik contends that the slur suggests a dissonant Baroque vocal figure known as \\"trilletto\\" which is removed and redistributed to another voice part at the end of Grosse Fuge in order to resolve long term dissonance. Performers have interpreted it in various ways. The Alban Berg Quartett plays the notes almost as a single note, but with an emphasis on the first eighth note to create a subtle differentiation. Eugene Drucker of the Emerson String Quartet plays this as two distinct eighth notes. Mark Steinberg of the Brentano String Quartet sometimes joins the eighth notes, and sometimes separates them, marking the difference by playing the first eighth without vibrato, then adding vibrato for the second. Arrangement for piano four hands Manuscript of the Grosse Fuge arranged by Beethoven for piano four hands In early 1826, the publisher of the Op. 130 String Quartet, Mathias Artaria, told Beethoven there were \\"many requests\\" for a piano four-hand arrangement of the Grosse Fuge.Solomon (1977), p. 449 This was well before any known discussion of publishing the fugue independently of the quartet; considering the negative reaction to the fugue, Solomon speculates this was likely a ploy by Artaria to persuade Beethoven to separate the piece from the Op. 130 quartet. Artaria asked Beethoven to prepare the piano arrangement, but Beethoven was not interested, so Artaria instead engaged Anton Halm to prepare it. When Beethoven was shown Halm's work, he was not satisfied and immediately made his own note-for-note arrangement of the fugue. Beethoven's arrangement was completed subsequent to the C minor String Quartet, Op. 131, and was published by Artaria as Op. 134.Cooper (2008), p. 364 Beethoven‚Äôs objection to Halm‚Äôs arrangement was that it tried to make it easier for the players. ‚ÄúHalm enclosed a note saying that for the sake of convenience he had to break up some of the lines among the hands. Beethoven wasn‚Äôt interested in convenience.‚Äù Swafford. J. (2014, p.901) Beethoven: Anguish and Triumph. London, Faber. Rediscovery of manuscript In 2005, Beethoven's 1826 autograph of his piano four-hands transcription of the Grosse Fuge resurfaced in Pennsylvania.Wakin (2005)CBC article (2005) The manuscript was authenticated by Dr. Jeffrey Kallberg at the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Stephen Roe, head of Sotheby's Manuscript Department. The manuscript had been missing for 115 years. It was auctioned by Sotheby's on 1 December 2005, and bought for GBP 1.12 million (US$1.95 million) by a then- unknown purchaser, who has since revealed himself to be Bruce Kovner, a publicity-shy multi-billionaire who donated the manuscript ‚Äì along with 139 other original and rare pieces of music ‚Äì to the Juilliard School of Music in February 2006. It has since become available in Juilliard's online manuscript collection. The manuscript's known provenance is that it was listed in an 1890 catalogue and sold at an auction in Berlin to a Cincinnati, Ohio, industrialist, whose daughter gave it and other manuscripts including a Mozart Fantasia to a church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1952. It is not known how the Beethoven manuscript came to be in the possession of the library. The most striking change in the piano duet version occurs at the start. \\"Beethoven had tampered in an interesting way with the first bars of the Fugue's introductory section. The quartet version begins with loud unison G's, spread over three octaves and one and a half bars. In his initial draft of the piano arrangement, Beethoven replicated the original. Then, apparently, he decided that the Gs needed more strength and weight. The manuscript shows that he squeezed in two extra tremolando bars, expanding the moment in time. He also added octaves above and below, expanding it in space.\\"Alex Ross at \\"Great Fugue: Secrets of a Beethoven manuscript\\", originally published in The New Yorker, 6 February 2006Grosse Fuge piano duet arrangement bars 1-10Grosse Fuge piano duet arrangement bars 1-10According to pianist Peter Hill, Beethoven transferred the Fugue from string quartet to piano \\"with obvious care. Revisiting the Fugue in this way may well have caused Beethoven to rethink the possibilities of what he had composed, to conclude that the Fugue could (and perhaps should) stand alone.\\" Hill concludes, \\"What Beethoven created for the Grosse Fuge transcended the immediate purpose. Instead, he re-imagined a masterpiece in another medium, different from the original, but equally valid because equally characteristic of its creator.\\" Hill, P.

Early life in New York Croswell was born in Newburgh, New York, the only son of John and Sallie (n√©e Hicks) Croswell. His father, who was of Scots-Irish extraction, was a paper maker, and carried on business in New York City. His ancestors on his mother's side were of Knickerbocker descent. Some members of the Croswell family were connected with notable events in New York and Connecticut, including Harry Croswell, a pro-Federalist newspaper editor, convicted of libel against President Thomas Jefferson in a landmark case in New York.Harry Croswell Web SiteThe Founders' Constitution Volume 5, Amendment I (Speech and Press), Document 28The Reverend Harry Croswell and Black Episcopalians in New Haven, 1820‚Äì1860 by Randall K. Burkett When Croswell was seven years old his mother and younger sister died of fever. A few months later his father accidentally drowned in the Hudson River. Charles was taken in to live with the family of his mother's brother, Daniel Hicks. Early life in Michigan In 1837, when Croswell was 12, the Hicks family moved to Adrian, Michigan. At 16, he began studying to be a carpenter‚Äîhis uncle's trade‚Äîand pursued that vocation for four years. According to one biography, he \\"worked at it very diligently ... maintaining himself, and devoting his spare time to reading and the acquirement of knowledge.\\" Croswell began to study the law in 1846. That same year, he was appointed Deputy Clerk of Lenawee County. His uncle, Daniel, had been the first Register of Deeds for Lenawee County. In 1847, Hicks went to fight in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. After returning from the war, Hicks went to Sault Ste. Marie to be a collector of the port there and soon after died from yellow fever, which he had contracted in Mexico. After this, Charles bought the house in Adrian that he had helped to build from his aunt for $1,700. Early political career In 1848, Croswell ran on the Whig ticket for the position of County Clerk, but was defeated. In 1850, he was elected as a Whig to be Register of Deeds for the county in 1850 and was re-elected in 1852. In 1854, he took part in the formation of the Republican Party, where he was a member and Secretary of the convention held at Jackson, Michigan. In 1855 he formed a law partnership with Thomas M. Cooley, who later became Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court. This partnership continued until 1859, when Cooley moved to Ann Arbor. In 1862, Croswell was appointed the City Attorney of Adrian, and in the same year was elected mayor. In the general election in the fall of 1862, he was elected from the 10th District to the Michigan Senate. He was re-elected from the 10th District in 1864 and from the 8th District in 1866. During this whole period he was President pro tempore and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. In 1867, Croswell was elected a member of the Constitutional Convention to revise the Michigan Constitution, and selected as the presiding officer. In 1868, he was chosen an elector on the Republican Presidential ticket, casting, with his associates, the vote of the State of Michigan for Grant and Colfax. In 1872 he was elected from the Lenawee County 4th District to the Michigan House of Representatives, and made Speaker of the House. He also, for several years, served as Secretary of the State Board of Corrections and Charities, repeatedly visiting nearly all the poor-houses and jails of the state. Governorship In 1876 he was nominated by the Republican Party, for Governor of Michigan, and was elected by a majority of 23,434 over his Democratic competitor. He was re-nominated in 1878, and succeeded by a majority of 47,777 over his highest opponent. During his administration the public debt was greatly reduced; a policy adopted requiring the state institutions to keep within the limit of appropriations; laws enacted to provide more effectually for the punishment of corruption and bribery in elections; the State House of Correction at Ionia and the Eastern Asylum for the Insane at Pontiac were opened, and the new capitol building at Lansing was completed and occupied. During his second term, he presided at the dedication of the capitol building and helped prevent great destruction of a riot in Jackson. In 1887, Davisville, a small town in Michigan's Thumb, was renamed Croswell in his honor.  Personal life  Croswell married Lucy M. Eddy, the daughter of Adrian pioneer Morton Eddy, on February 4, 1852. They had five children, only three of whom survived past childhood. Lucy Croswell died of spinal apoplexy on March 19, 1868, while her husband was at the state Republican convention in Detroit. She left behind one son and two daughters: Charles Morton, Harriet (Hattie), and Lucy Elizabeth. In 1880, Croswell married Elizabeth Musgrave, who was twenty-five years his junior. A daughter by his second wife was born three months after his death. Retirement and death Croswell grave Croswell returned to Adrian in 1881 after two terms as governor. He was active in retirement, serving as president of the Lenawee County Savings Bank. He also began buying shares in the Adrian Union Hall Company, which operated the town's largest event hall; he eventually became its majority owner and in 1883 installed his son, C.M. Croswell Jr., as its manager. The theater is still in operation and now known as the Croswell Opera House. One afternoon in December 1886, he sat down by the stove in the offices of the Lenawee County Savings Bank and complained of a chill. This was the beginning of an illness that was to claim his life. He died on December 13, 1886, at the age of 61. Croswell was buried at Oakwood Cemetery in Adrian. Three months after Croswell's death, his widow gave birth to a daughter, who was named Sallie Hicks Croswell, after Croswell's mother. Elizabeth later remarried to become Elizabeth Merrill and donated the Croswell home in Adrian to the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The home serves as the chapter offices. The house in Adrian, Michigan where he lived before his governorship was listed as a Michigan State Historic Site in 1958 and later listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Governor Charles Croswell House in 1972.

He was born in Australia, raised in New Zealand and has dual British-New Zealand citizenship. He was the first British officer to face criminal charges for disobedience after challenging the legality of the war against Iraq. On 5 October 2005 he was charged with five counts of disobeying a lawful command between 1 June and 12 July 2005. Four of these relate to him refusing to carry out preparatory training with the final charge relating to his refusal to deploy to Iraq. In October 2005 his solicitor, Justin Hugheston-Roberts, told the Sunday Times \\"He is not arguing that he is a conscientious objector. He is arguing that the war is manifestly unlawful.\\" Kendall-Smith was found guilty on all five charges of disobeying orders, sentenced to a penalty of eight months in prison and ordered to pay ¬£20,000 costs. Pre-trial hearing In a statement to the court martial at a pre- trial hearing in Aldershot, on 15 March 2006, Kendall-Smith said: \\"I am a leader. I am not a mere follower to whom no moral responsibility can be attached.\\" Philip Sapsford, QC, defending, told the court martial: \\"The flight lieutenant is entitled to advance before this tribunal that the use of force in Iraq was unlawful in international law,\\" essentially reasoning that Kendall-Smith should be allowed to argue that any participation in the war effort was therefore unlawful. Sapsford added that the defence team was prepared to produce expert evidence to show that UN Resolution 1546, relied upon by the UK and US governments to justify the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, was no defence in international law. Sapsford also said he was considering calling former SAS soldier Ben Griffin, who recently resigned because of his objections to the war, to give evidence. Prosecutors argued that the legal questions surrounding the invasion of Iraq were irrelevant and that the case should centre only around the official orders given to Kendall-Smith. Prosecutor David Perry argued that at the time Kendall-Smith refused to deploy, the invasion itself was over and British forces were in Iraq with the authority of U.N. Security Council resolutions passed after Saddam's fall. A ruling on 22 March 2006, by the judge advocate Jack Bayliss, concurred. Bayliss dismissed Kendall-Smith's argument, ruling that he must face trial by court martial and would not be allowed to argue that the order to deploy was illegal. Obviating Kendall-Smith's argument that any participation in the war effort was unlawful on the basis of an illegal invasion, Bayliss asserted that British forces had full justification under UN resolutions 1511 and 1546 to be in Iraq at the time the charges were filed against Kendall-Smith in June and July, 2005. The judge advocate also rejected Kendall-Smith's claim that by serving in Iraq he could be complicit in a crime of aggression. Such a crime \\"cannot be committed by those in relatively junior positions such as that of the defendant. If a defendant believed that to go to Basra would make him complicit in the crime of aggression, his understanding of the law was wrong,\\" Bayliss said. Court-martial A court-martial in Aldershot sat from 11 to 13 April 2006. Kendall-Smith was found guilty on all five charges of disobeying orders, and sentenced to a penalty of eight months in prison and ordered to pay ¬£20,000 costs.

Il-14 was also manufactured in East Germany by VVB Flugzeugbau, in Czechoslovakia as the Avia 14. The Ilyushin Il-14 was typically replaced by the Antonov An-24 and Yakovlev Yak-40. Design and development The Il-14 was developed as a replacement for the widespread Douglas DC-3 and its Soviet built version, the Lisunov Li-2. A development of the earlier Ilyushin Il-12, (that first flew in 1945), the Il-14 was intended for use in both military and civil applications. The Il-12 had major problems with poor engine-out behaviour. Also, it had less payload capability than was originally planned (although the Il-12 was intended to carry 32 passengers, in service it only carried 18, which was uneconomical). An Avia 14T of CSA displayed at the 1957 Paris Air Show The development into the Il-14 was a vast improvement over the Il-12, with a new wing and a broader tailfin. It was powered by two 1,400 kW (1,900 hp) Shvetsov ASh-82T-7 radial piston engines. These changes greatly improved aerodynamic performance in engine-out conditions. Total production of the Il-14 was 1,345 aircraft: 1,065 in Moscow (Moscow Machinery Plant Nr.30) from 1956 to 1958 and Tashkent (Factory Nr.84) from 1954 to 1958. Licensed production of 80 in East Germany by VEB Flugzeugwerke Dresden (FWD) from 1956 to 1959 and 203 in Czechoslovakia by Avia, Prague, from 1956 to 1960. It was rugged and reliable, and thus was widely used in rural areas with poor quality airfields. The type was also used by the East German aircraft industry as a test aircraft for the horizontal stabilizer of the Baade 152.

Early years Chowdiah, was born in Tirumakudalu Narsipur village on the banks of the river Kaveri near Mysore. He became a disciple of Mysore Royal Court musician, Ganavisharadha Bidaram Krishnappa in 1910 and underwent a very rigorous and disciplined training until 1918 in the gurukula system. In his early years, he played the four stringed violin, and by 1927 he became an extremely well known violin accompanist. Those were the days when there was no sound amplification equipment and it was rather difficult for listeners who sat in the back rows of music halls to hear him playing the violin. Chowdiah realised this shortcoming and launched upon increasing the sound of the violin. He improvised the violin by adding three more strings such as Tara Shadja ‚Äì Mandra Shadja, Madhya Panchama ‚Äì Mandra Panchama and Madhya Shadja Mandra Shadja. After practising incessantly, he began to use this new seven stringed violin in all his concerts. He experimented, innovated and practised to achieve perfection, all without the knowledge of his Guru (teacher). In one of the vocal concerts of his Guru Bidaram Krishnappa in Mysore, Chowdiah accompanied him using his new seven stringed violin. Krishnappa perceived the sound emanating from the violin was louder than usual. He stared at his disciple and his violin and noted that there were three additional strings. He angrily asked him '‚Äòwhat is this contraption?'‚Äô and had an outburst. Chowdiah, in all humility said that he added three more strings and evolved this seven stringed violin so that the sound of the violin could be heard even in the back rows of the concert hall. He was afraid of the Guru's outburst. Veena Seshanna who was also present in the audience, was aware of the seven stringed violin. He was pleased with Chowdiah's accomplishment at innovating the violin, and told Bidaram Krishnappa that Chowdiah must be allowed to play that violin. Sometime later, Chowdiah accompanied his master again in another concert using this new violin and his master was pleased with it. Thus Chowdiah brought about a revolution, in the field of music. Career With his devoted practice, Chowdiah became a very great violinist. The name Chowdiah and the violin were synonymous with each other. With Bidaram Krishnappa's encouragement, courage and mastery, Chowdiah, earned fame, affection and respect from all his great contemporaries. All musicians desired to have him as their violin accompanist. It is said that the brilliant vocalist G. N. Balasubramaniam would request sabha secretaries, who wanted to arrange his concert, that they should talk to Chowdiah's first to make sure he is available to accompany on violin. By devoted practice, application, grit and learning, Chowdiah rose to Himalayan heights in the world of Carnatic music. As a guru Chowdiah would not sit with his disciples during fixed hours a standard practice in those days. As a guru he taught many of his disciples for about 8‚Äì10 years. He would enforce a sense of discipline that required the shishyas wake up early in the morning everyday and practice akara sadhana. His disciples were expected to practice Sarale in six tempos. Only one raga had to be practised in any given month, for up to four hours a day. This kind of practice was the means of developing voice culture and the deep knowledge of swaras (i.e. notes), essential to gain vast vidwath. Disciples had to practice varnams in three tempos and sing them to his satisfaction. This was the discipline that Chowdiah inherited from his guru, Bidaram Krishnappa, and he diligently passed on the same to his disciples. Chowdiah had many disciples. The list included the likes of R. K. Venkatarama Sastry (violin), V. Ramarathnam (vocal), Kandadevi S Alagiriswamy (1925‚Äì2000; violin), Palghat Mani Iyer (violin), Chennai V. Sethuramaiah (violin) and others. Later, Ramanujam, Madurai Venugopal, Chinnappa, H. R. Seetharama Shastri and others became disciples of Chowdiah. As a guru Chowdiah was very affectionate towards his disciples. Chowdiah was known for his hospitality and he always hosted many musicians when they visited Mysore. He would house them in a house that was located next to his residence in Mysore. He had cooks and servants dedicated to meeting the needs of his guests. He always took care of his personal chores himself and would get really upset if he found any of his students folding his clothes, etc. He also introduced his disciples to almost all famous musicians of his times and he insisted that, they learn the many nuances of the art of music from them. On his concert tours, he would always take select disciples and gave them additional opportunities to meet the giants of music, and interact with them. He was in great demand and used to be on concert engagements most of the time. After each concert where he accompanied the great masters, he would sit with his disciples, review the concerts and demonstrate the salient points by singing. Whenever his disciples accompanied him on his concert tours, he would make sure that his students were well taken care of, and would work with sabhas to arrange the concerts of his disciples ahead of main concerts and accompany his disciples on violin. The respect and support he received in Tamil Nadu was amazing. The hotel proprietor's in many cities and states would invite him and his disciples and host them free of cost. The top officials and leaders of the town would compete with each other to extend him a warm welcome and request him to stay at their homes. Crowds would swell on the news of Chowdiah arriving in town. Such was Chowdiah's reputation; he had captured the hearts and minds of both ordinary listeners and knowledgeable artists and connoisseurs of carnatic music. Achievements Chowdiah designed the seven-stringed violin to ensure that the accompanist could match the vocalist (the need for this was felt especially in the early and mid-20th century when no amplification devices were available). He was known as Pitilu Chowdiah ‚Äì Pitilu (fiddle) being the word for violin in South Indian languages such as Kannada . As he hailed from Tirumakudalu Narasipura near Mysore, so he is also known as Mysore T. Chowdiah. Chowdiah founded the Ayyanar College of music, in Mysore to fulfill his guru Bidaram Krishnappa's dream of opening an institution of learning and advanced studies in music at \\" Prasanna Seetha Rama Mandira\\". Mr. K. Puttu Rao, a senior advocate of the city, was the secretary of Bidaram Krishnappa's Prasanna Seetha Rama Mandiram at that time, and he offered all the necessary support to set up the institution. Chowdiah started the institution with his disciple Ramarathnam as the vice-principal of Ayyanar College of Music, Mysore. Hundreds of students have been trained in vocal, violin, veena and flute at the Ayyanar College of Music. The college also trained many blind students who were provided the Government of India scholarships. Well known students of Mysore Ramarathnam from this school include late N. Nanjunda Swamy (vocal music), late Dr B.R. Shyamachar (flute), Late C.M. Madhuranath (flute), Late T. R. Srinivasan (vocal music), Late B. Srinivasa Iyengar (veena and vocal), Late Rangaswamy Iyengar (violin), K. J. Venkatachar (vocal and violin), G. R.Jaya, Indira, Lalita, Padma and others. The students of this college were trained to appear for junior, senior, and proficiency examinations in flute, violin, veena and vocal music. Chowdiah, the Principal often visited the college of music and would listen, observe, supervise and give suggestions to students and the administrators. Chowdiah composed many varnas, kirthana's and thillanas. In the early days every one had seen vidwans like Musuri Subramanya Iyer, GNB, Maharajapura Vishwanatha Iyer participate in films. Motivated by this, Chowdiah produced a movie called Vani, for which he was also the music director. Those days there was a well known dramatist Hiranniah who, acted in the film and also helped Chowdiah with lyrics and scripts for songs in the movie \\"Vani\\". The lyrics for these songs consisted of dramatic tunes and, were not of the standard for compositions in carnatic music. So, this motivated Chowdiah to start composing. He has composed nearly 50 compositions in Sanskrit and Kannada including varna's, kirthana's and thillanas. All of these have been edited and brought out in the form of a book \\"Chowdiah's Compositions\\" by Prof. Mysore V. Ramarathnam, which were published by University of Mysore. He was awarded the Sangeetha Kalanidhi title by Madras Music Academy in 1957. He also received the Sangeetha Kalasikhamani award conferred on him by The Indian Fine Arts Society in 1958. To honour the memory of his Guru, he completed the Bidaram Krishnappa Rama Mandira in Mysore as Bidram Krishnappa died before realising his dream on which he had spent all his fortune. Death Chowdiah died on 19 January 1967 at the age of 72. While he remains as a shining star in the hearts and minds of true connoisseurs' of carnatic music, his life and career and his contribution to carnatic music is alive and well throughout the world of carnatic music.

High Raise is not one of the most spectacular mountains in the district; however, with a height of 762 metres (2,500 ft) it is the highest point in the central fells of Lakeland. High Raise is in fact commonly regarded as the most central mountain in the district and this position gives a fine viewpoint to admire the surrounding mountains and beyond. All of England's 3,000-foot (914 m) mountains (Skiddaw, Helvellyn and the Scafells) can be well seen from the summit while the more distant views include the Three Peaks in the Yorkshire Dales (37 miles / 60 km) and Morecambe Bay (25 miles / 40 km). Summit The summit itself, which is also known as High White Stones due to a smattering of grey boulders in the vicinity of the highest point, has an Ordnance Survey column and a large cairn which also doubles as a wind shelter; a ruined fence also crosses the summit plateau.Mark Richards: The Central Fells: Collins (2003): The view is extensive as befits the central location with all major fell groups visible. The only disappointment is the Langdale Pikes, which seen from behind lack most of their distinctiveness. No lakes are seen other than short sections of Bassenthwaite Lake and Derwentwater. Ascents Ascents of High Raise are usually done from Stonethwaite in Borrowdale or the New Dungeon Ghyll Hotel in Great Langdale, although routes are also viable from Grasmere and Thirlmere. The Stonethwaite approach gives the walker a chance to climb the neighbouring fell of Ullscarf, while the route from Great Langdale allows visits to the splendid Langdale Pikes either before or after climbing High Raise. Topography The fell is the meeting-point of many ridges. The main watershed of the Central Fells can be thought of as a 'L' shape with High Raise, the highest point, standing at the corner. The northern ridge continues over Ullscarf and High Seat towards the low fells above Keswick. South- eastward the spine continues over Blea Rigg and Silver How, terminating at Loughrigg Fell above Grasmere and Rydal Water. To the east there are a number of subsidiary ridges, diverging from Sergeant Man. This rocky top is a part of High Raise, but is considered by many writers as a separate fell because of its appearance. Beyond lie Calf Crag, Gibson Knott, Helm Crag, Steel Fell and Tarn Crag. South of High Raise lie its most famous offspring, the Langdale Pikes. These picturesque craggy heights form the parapet of High Raise's southern plateau, standing atop the valley wall and the centrepiece of many views. Geology High White Stones is an outcrop of the Lincomb Tarns Formation. This consists of dacitic welded lapilli-tuff and volcaniclastic sandstone. These rocks are overlain by till over the rest of the summit area.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 series maps: Sheet 38: BGS (1998) References Category:Marilyns of England Category:Hewitts of England Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Nuttalls ","title":"High Raise (Langdale)"},{"id":"1513392","text":"Aconit is a second-line multi-mission stealth frigate of the French Navy.

Intended to replace the Antonov An-24, it first flew in 1990. A total of 20 Il-114s have been built. Production of the Il-114 was temporarily suspended in July 2012, with the sixth and last aircraft delivered to Uzbekistan Airlines on 24 May 2013. In 2016, the company stated that production would be restarted with all-Russian parts, with a new first flight in 2019 and the first aircraft in commercial service in 2021. The decision to end production adheres to the Uzbek government's decision to convert the Tashkent factory to other production lines (namely structural units, household purpose products, spare parts for cars and agricultural equipment), despite Russian interest in keeping the production line and a reportedly high demand prospect for the aircraft. This has translated in an October 2013 announcement by a plant representative, that production is to be resumed after the factory solved financial matters and also due to the interest of a \\"Russian party\\". Design and development In June 1986, the Ilyushin OKB began work on a replacement for the Antonov An-24, large numbers of which remained in service with Aeroflot. The Soviet Ministry of the Aviation Industry set down requirements for the An-24 replacement, including the ability to carry 60 passengers over a range of at a speed of , while using much less fuel than its predecessor and retaining the ability to operate out of poorly equipped airfields with unpaved runways.Postlethwaite 1990, pp. 100‚Äì101.Duffy 1997, pp. 242‚Äì243.Gordon, Komissarov and Komissarov 2004, p. 352. Development of the new aircraft was expected to be relatively simple, with the first flight programmed to take place in 1989, with service entry in 1992. Ilyushin's design, the Il-114, is a low-wing, twin-turboprop monoplane, with an airframe constructed mainly of metal, with composite materials used for non-structural parts. The aircraft is powered by two Klimov TV7-117S turboprop engines, driving six-bladed propellers. The undercarriage is a retractable nosewheel undercarriage, while double-slotted trailing edge flaps are fitted to the wings.Postlethwaite 1989, p. 30. Unlike previous Soviet airliners, which had a large flight crew, the Il-114 is flown by a crew of two, who are provided with electronic flight instruments.Postlethwaite 1990, p. 104. Up to 64 passengers are accommodated in the aircraft's cabin, with passengers' baggage carried in compartments at the front and rear of the cabin, rather than under the cabin floor.Postlethwaite 1990, p. 107. The first prototype made its maiden flight from Zhukovsky Airfield on 29 March 1990.Jackson 2003, p. 368. Development was slowed by technical problems (including delays with the TV7-117 engines), and by organisational and financial problems associated with the breakup of the Soviet Union, with the Il-114 to be built at the Tashkent Aviation Production Association in soon-to- be independent Uzbekistan. The second prototype did not fly until 24 December 1991. This second prototype crashed, killing seven of nine people aboard, on 5 July 1993, causing the Russian government to withdraw funding from the Il-114, although the OKB continued development with its own money.Duffy 1997, p. 243.Gordon, Komissarov and Komissarov 2004, pp. 354‚Äì355. The Il-114 finally received airworthiness certification on 26 April 1997.Duffy 1997, p. 244. Operational history Ilyushin Il 114 at the MAKS Airshow, 23 August 2009 Uzbekistan Airways Ilyushin Il-114 at Dyubin 2012 RADAR Ilyushin Il-114 at Dvurekov Il-114-100 of Uzbekistan Airways in 2008 Since Vyborg was forced to shut down in July 2010, Uzbekistan Airways was the sole operator of the type until May 2018. As of May 2018, no further orders had been placed for the Ilyushin 114. In the winter of 2013-2014 the aircraft was scheduled for the following routes: * Together with the Airbus A320 for flights between Tashkent and Karshi, Navoi, Nukus as well as Urgench. * Together with the Boeing 757 for flights between Tashkent and Termez. * Together with the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 757 for flights between Tashkent and Bukhara Though the aircraft is not scheduled for other flights, following ad hoc changes it is also (though rarely) flown to other destinations in Uzbekistan. This also includes international connections: though these are no longer scheduled for the Ilyushin 114, the aircraft is sometimes used ad hoc on flights between Tashkent and Ashgabad as well as Bishkek. Uzbekistan Airways frequently changed aircraft prior to flights in order to allow for optimal usage of aircraft space in relation to actual demand. From 2005, an Il-114 was converted into a flying testbed by Agat and Radar-MMS. With a capability to loiter for 14 hours, Agat and Radar-MMS have turned it into an advanced- technology MPA demonstrator. Il-114 RA93001 aircraft demonstrated the transmission of telemetry and targeting data in real time using a wide-band secure datalink using the Kasatka rescue and targeting complex during IMDS‚Äô2015 maritime show. This Il-114 has a FLIR under the nose, a magnetometer in the tail section, a semi-automatic sonobuoy dispenser, and two pylons under the fuselage for sensor pods or Kh-35 anti-ship missiles. On the right side of the fuselage, a GSh-2-23 twin-barrel 23-mm rapid fire cannon pod can be installed, with conformal metric-band antennas on both sides. This aircraft has two radars, one (KS-9) working in metric waveband (range up to 50 km) and the other (KS-1 or Zarya) in centimetric waveband (range 300 km). An additional antenna is in an underbelly dome for 360-degree coverage. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Russia is looking to modernize the Il-114. It will replace the Ukraine-made An-140T that was selected before, to refresh the Russia Air Force's medium transport aircraft fleet of An-26s and An-72s. Ilyushin is also offering the Maritime Patrol version of the aircraft to the Russian navy that can patrol for up to ten hours. It can be armed with 1.5 tons of sonobuoys and depth charges, with modern search-and-attack radar, magnetic anomaly detector and a thermal imager. The Il-114MP is intended to supplement and may then replace the ageing Il-38. President Putin has ordered a study into resuming Ilyushin Il-114 turboprop production at the Aviakor plant in Samara, southeast of Moscow, with results of the assessment due in September 2014. Possible improvements can include updated engines and avionics, rear cargo ramp/door, structural strengthening, digitization of engineering drawings. China may be interested in the modernized Il-114. The Russian naval service chief Maj. Gen. Igor Kozhin announced that the Russian navy is looking for ‚Äúa modern and suitable universal platform‚Äù to replace the aging Il-20/Il-38 MPA fleet. Selection will be made in the period of 2015-16. A Maritime Patrol version of the Il-114 twin-turboprop airliner most likely will be a candidate. According to Georgy Antsev, general director and designer for Morinformsystem-Agat, ‚ÄúIn my view, the Il-114 is the best choice for the Russian navy‚Äù. Companies promoting the Il-114 as an MPA include Agat, Ilyushin, Radar-MMS and others. Il-114-300 Ilyushin Company chief designer Sergey Gromov announced that they will develop a version of the Il-114 aircraft fitted with ski and wheel landing gear for the Arctic Region. The development program will produce three Il-114 aircraft by 2020 with Gidromash/Hydromash JSC (Nizhny Novgorod). It will be designated Il-114-300 and will be produced using only Russian-produced components. Four versions of Il-114-300 would be developed including a passenger version by 2019; Cargo and Arctic versions derived from the passenger version, and a Maritime Patrol Aircraft, whose prototype was showcased at Army-2015 forum. Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) expected that the Russian government would decide later on in 2015 whether to allow the state-backed aerospace group to build a new 50-to-70-seat passenger version of the Ilyushin Il-114. At Moscow's MAKS airshow on 26 August 2015, UAC president Yuri Slyusar said he favors building the new Il-114-300 model but awaits the Kremlin's endorsement. In December 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that production of the aircraft will be at the Nizhny Novgorod plant Sokol, starting in 2019-2020. Until 2025, almost 56 billion rubles from the state budget will finance the construction of 100 Il-114 planes. However, UAC president Yury Slusar announced at the Paris Air Show on 20 June 2017 that the production site was changed to the MiG production center in Lukhovitsy, close to Moscow. It is expected that the plant can produce 12-18 Ilyushin Il-114 regional aircraft per month to supply Russian airlines that will need around 60-80 turboprops with 50-60 seats over the next 10 to 15 years, said Slusar. At the Paris Air Show in June 2017, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC;) and Ilyushin Joint Stock Co. was signed for P&WC; to provide two PW127H engines to restart the Ilyushin Il-114-100 regional turboprop aircraft program. The Il-112V, being developed from the Il-114 airliner, will replace Russia's aging fleet of Antonov An-26s, as the LVTS (Russian acronym for Lightweight Military-Transport Aircraft). The Ilyushin Il-112V tactical airlifter for the Russian air force was forecast to make its maiden flight in the summer of 2017, according to Yuri Slyusar, president of the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), but it was subsequently delayed. On 9 November 2015, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin reiterated that the Ilyushin Il-114 will be produced in the Sokol plant in Nizhny Novgorod. In July 2017, it was announced that Russia's United Aircraft Corp. (UAC) had signed a letter of intent with State Transport Leasing Co. for 50 Ilyushin Il-114-300s. Although the delivery schedule was not disclosed, the manufacturer and lessor are expected to sign a preliminary agreement on terms and conditions before the end of 2017. In 2017, the Kremlin injected ‚ÇΩ9.6 billion ($ million) into the Il-114-300 and for three years from 2018, UAC plans to invest ‚ÇΩ billion ($ million) for the Il-114-300.

Overview Boasian anthropology was based on the four-field model of anthropology uniting the fields of cultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology, physical anthropology, and archeology under the umbrella of anthropology. It was based on an understanding of human cultures as malleable and perpetuated through social learning, and understood behavioral differences between peoples as largely separate from and unaffected by innate predispositions stemming from human biology‚Äîin this way it rejected the view that cultural differences were essentially biologically based. It also rejected ideas of cultural evolution which ranked societies and cultures according to their degree of \\"evolution\\", assuming a single evolutionary path along which cultures can be ranked hierarchically, rather Boas considered societies varying complexities to be the outcome of particular historical processes and circumstances‚Äîa perspective described as historical particularism. Another important aspect of Boasian anthropology was its perspective of cultural relativism which assumes that a culture can only be understood by first understanding its own standards and values, rather than assuming that the values and standards of the anthropologist's society, can be used to judge other cultures. In this way Boasian anthropologists did not assume as a given that non-Western societies are necessarily inferior to Western ones, but rather attempt to understand them on their own terms. From this approach also stemmed an investment in understanding and protecting cultural minorities, and in critiquing and relativizing American and Western society through contrasting its values and norms with those of other societies. Boasian anthropology in this way tended to consider political activism, through scientific education about society, a significant part of the scientific project.Handler, R. (1990).

John Benjamins Publishing The program of research and public education activities pursued by Boas, his former students, and their associates‚Äîeventually including most of the field of anthropology as practiced in the United States‚Äîencompassed a number of discrete areas of inquiry and activity. These include many anthropological specializations and neighboring inter-disciplines, such as those known today as museum anthropology, folkloristics, linguistic anthropology, Native American studies, and ethnohistory. Boasian anthropologists Boas had a large group of students who dominated the first generation of professional anthropologists in the United States, and went on to found many of the earliest anthropology departments in the country.Frank, G.

In the late 20th century earlier Boasian anthropology was also critiqued for its acceptance of race as a valid biological category,Visweswaran, K. (1998). Race and the Culture of Anthropology.

Kr√∏yer (1881) Heinrich Hirschsprung by P.S. Kr√∏yer (1899) Heinrich Hirschsprung (7 February 1836 ‚Äì 8 November 1908) was a Danish tobacco manufacturer, arts patron and art collector most known for founding the Hirschsprung Collection in Copenhagen, a museum dedicated to Danish art from the 19th and early 20th century. Heinrich and his brother Bernhard Hirschsprung (1834-1909) took over A.M. Hirschsprung & S√∏nner after their father in 1858. Family and business life Heinrich Hirschsprung was born in Copenhagen into a family of German-Jewish descent. His father, Abraham Marcus Hirschsprun (1793-1871), had been born in Friedberg near Frankfurt am Main in 1783 but moved to Denmark where he opened a small tobacco business in Copenhagen's Hotel D'Angleterre in 1826. Two years later, in 1827, he married Petrea Hirschsprung n√©e Hertz (1804‚Äì1891), and they had six children. Hirschsprung's disease is named after their pediatrician son Harald Hirschsprung (1830‚Äì1916) who first described it. Heinrich and his brother Bernhard took over their father's shop in 1858 and under their leadership the business, now specializing in cigar making, grew rapidly. In 1866, they bought a piece of unused land at Gammelholm, an area which had been a naval site until 1859. There they built a modern factory for manufacturing cigars. It was designed by young architect Ove Petersen in a Historicist style which ses inspired by Italian Renaissance architecture. Heinrich married Pauline Elisabeth Jacobson (1845 - 1912) on 26 June 1864; she was the daughter of wholesaler Daniel Simon (1791‚Äì1858) and Friederiche Jacobson n√©e Gerhardt (1811‚Äì1855). Heinrich and Pauline had five children: Ellen, Ivar, √Öge, Robert, and Oskar. They had their first apartment on H√∏jbro Plads in Copenhagen and subsequently a house on Bredgade. They also had country homes in the north of Sj√¶lland as well as in Italy. Art collection and artist friends Hirschsprung began his art collection in 1866, with the purchase of a painting by Julius Exner (1825‚Äì1910). His collection expanded over the years with additional purchases of paintings by contemporary Danish artists. It was a modern collection of examples from the Skagen Painters, the Funen Artists) (Fynboerne) and Symbolists. Hirschsprung was a great supporter, both personal and economic, of P.S. Kr√∏yer who met him through Frants Henningsen, (1850‚Äì1908), a mutual friend at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts (Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi). Hirschsprung admired Kr√∏yer‚Äôs artistic talent and skills, and he purchased the first paintings from him in 1874 ‚Äî four watercolors from Hornb√¶k. They continued a lifelong friendship. Hirschsprung helped finance Kr√∏yer‚Äôs travels and foreign residence during the years 1877-1881, giving him the economic support needed to develop his artistic skills. Kr√∏yer was a friend of the entire family. He carried on a personal correspondence with Pauline and made a number of family portraits of Heinrich, Pauline and their children. In addition to P.S. Kr√∏yer, their homes were gathering places for such other contemporary artists as authors Holger Drachmann (1846‚Äì1908), Herman Bang (1857‚Äì1912) and Henrik Pontoppidan (1857‚Äì1943) and painters Wilhelm Marstrand (1810‚Äì1873), Frederik Vermehren (1823‚Äì1910), Otto Bache (1839‚Äì1927), Kristian Zahrtmann (1843‚Äì1917), and Frants Henningsen (1850‚Äì1908). The Hirschsprung Collection (Den Hirschsprungske Samling) was established by Pauline and the museum opened in 1911 with 45 paintings, 13 pastels, 205 drawings, 14 watercolors, 12 busts, 55 sketchbooks as well as P.S. Kr√∏yer‚Äôs letters and documents. The collection has grown since then, and the museum continues to this day in a beautiful park setting near central Copenhagen, around the corner from the National Gallery (Statens Museum for Kunst).

These channels may conduct many different ions, but are named for chloride because its concentration in vivo is much higher than other anions. Several families of voltage-gated channels and ligand-gated channels (e.g., the CaCC families) have been characterized in humans. Voltage-gated chloride channels display a variety of important physiological and cellular roles that include regulation of pH, volume homeostasis, organic solute transport, cell migration, cell proliferation and differentiation. Based on sequence homology the chloride channels can be subdivided into a number of groups.  General functions  Voltage-gated chloride channels are important for setting cell resting membrane potential and maintaining proper cell volume. These channels conduct or other anions such as . The structure of these channels are not like other known channels. The chloride channel subunits contain between 1 and 12 transmembrane segments. Some chloride channels are activated only by voltage (i.e., voltage-gated), while others are activated by , other extracellular ligands, or pH.  CLC family  The CLC family of chloride channels contains 10 or 12 transmembrane helices. Each protein forms a single pore. It has been shown that some members of this family form homodimers. In terms of primary structure, they are unrelated to known cation channels or other types of anion channels. Three CLC subfamilies are found in animals. CLCN1 is involved in setting and restoring the resting membrane potential of skeletal muscle, while other channels play important parts in solute concentration mechanisms in the kidney. These proteins contain two CBS domains. Chloride channels are also important for maintaining safe ion concentrations within plant cells.  Structure and mechanism  The CLC channel structure has not yet been resolved, however the structure of the CLC exchangers has been resolved by x-ray crystallography. Because the primary structure of the channels and exchangers are so similar, most assumptions about the structure of the channels are based on the structure established for the bacterial exchangers. A cartoon representation of a CLC chloride channel. The arrows indicate the orientation of each half of the individual subunit. Each CLC channel is formed from two monomers, each monomer containing the antiparallel transmembrane domain. Each monomer has its own pore through which chloride and other anions may be conducted. Each channel or exchanger is composed of two similar subunits‚Äîa dimer‚Äîeach subunit containing one pore. The proteins are formed from two copies of the same protein‚Äîa homodimer‚Äîthough scientists have artificially combined subunits from different channels to form heterodimers. Each subunit binds ions independently of the other, meaning conduction or exchange occur independently in each subunit. A cartoon representation of a CLC channel monomer. Two of these subunits come together to form the CLC channel. Each monomer has three binding sites for anions, Sext, Scen, and Sint. The two CBS domains bind adenosine nucleotides to alter channel function Each subunit consists of two related halves oriented in opposite directions, forming an ‚Äòantiparallel‚Äô structure. These halves come together to form the anion pore. The pore has a filter through which chloride and other anions can pass, but lets little else through. These water-filled pores filter anions via three binding sites‚ÄîSint, Scen, and Sext‚Äîwhich bind chloride and other anions. The names of these binding sites correspond to their positions within the membrane. Sint is exposed to intracellular fluid, Scen lies inside the membrane or in the center of the filter, and Sext is exposed to extracellular fluid.[4] Each binding site binds different chloride anions simultaneously. In the exchangers, these chloride ions do not interact strongly with one another, due to compensating interactions with the protein. In the channels, the protein does not shield chloride ions at one binding site from the neighboring negatively charged chlorides. Each negative charge exerts a repulsive force on the negative charges next to it. Researchers have suggested that this mutual repulsion contributes to the high rate of conduction through the pore. CLC transporters shuttle H+ across the membrane. The H+ pathway in CLC transporters utilizes two glutamate residues‚Äîone on the extracellular side, Gluex, and one on the intracellular side, Gluin. Gluex also serves to regulate chloride exchange between the protein and extracellular solution. This means that the chloride and the proton share a common pathway on the extracellular side, but diverge on the intracellular side. CLC channels also have dependence on H+, but for gating rather than Cl‚àí exchange. Instead of utilizing gradients to exchange two Cl‚àí for one H+, the CLC channels transport one H+ while simultaneously transporting millions of anions. This corresponds with one cycle of the slow gate. Eukaryotic CLC channels also contain cytoplasmic domains. These domains have a pair of CBS motifs, whose function is not fully characterized yet. Though the precise function of these domains is not fully characterized, their importance is illustrated by the pathologies resulting from their mutation. Thomsen's disease, Dent's disease, infantile malignant osteopetrosis, and Bartter's syndrome are all genetic disorders due to such mutations. At least one role of the cytoplasmic CBS domains regards regulation via adenosine nucleotides. Particular CLC transporters and proteins have modulated activity when bound with ATP, ADP, AMP, or adenosine at the CBS domains. The specific effect is unique to each protein, but the implication is that certain CLC transporters and proteins are sensitive to the metabolic state of the cell.  Selectivity  The Scen acts as the primary selectivity filter for most CLC proteins, allowing the following anions to pass through, from most selected to least: SCN‚àí, Cl‚àí, Br‚àí, NO, I‚àí. Altering a serine residue at the selectivity filter, labeled Sercen, to a different amino acid alters the selectivity.  Gating and kinetics  Gating occurs through two mechanisms: protopore or fast gating and common or slow gating. Common gating involves both protein subunits closing their pores at the same time (cooperation), while protopore gating involves independent opening and closing of each pore. As the names imply, fast gating occur at a much faster rate than slow gating. Precise molecular mechanisms for gating are still being studied. For the channels, when the slow gate is closed, no ions permeate through the pore. When the slow gate is open, the fast gates open spontaneously and independently of one another. Thus, the protein could have both gates open, or both gates closed, or just one of the two gates open. Single-channel patch-clamp studies demonstrated this biophysical property even before the dual-pore structure of CLC channels had been resolved. Each fast gate opens independently of the other and the ion conductance measured during these studies reflects a binomial distribution. H+ transport promotes opening of the common gate in CLC channels. For every opening and closing of the common gate, one H+ is transported across the membrane. The common gate is also affected by the bonding of adenosine nucleotides to the intracellular CBS domains. Inhibition or activation of the protein by these domains is specific to each protein.  Function  The CLC channels allow chloride to flow down its electrochemical gradient, when open. These channels are expressed on the cell membrane. CLC channels contribute to the excitability of these membranes as well as transport ions across the membrane. The CLC exchangers are localized to intracellular components like endosomes or lysosomes and help regulate the pH of their compartments. Pathology Bartter's syndrome, which is associated with renal salt wasting and hypokalemic alkalosis, is due to the defective transport of chloride ions and associated ions in the thick ascending loop of Henle. CLCNKB has been implicated. Another inherited disease that affects the kidney organs is Dent's Disease, characterised by low molecular weight proteinuria and hypercalciuria where mutations in CLCN5 are implicated. Thomsen disease is associated with dominant mutations and Becker disease with recessive mutations in CLCN1.  Genes  * CLCN1, CLCN2, CLCN3, CLCN4, CLCN5, CLCN6, CLCN7, CLCNKA, CLCNKB * BSND - encodes barttin, accessory subunit beta for CLCNKA and CLCNKB  E-ClC family  Members of Epithelial Chloride Channel (E-ClC) Family (TC# 1.A.13) catalyze bidirectional transport of chloride ions. Mammals have multiple isoforms (at least 6 different gene products plus splice variants) of epithelial chloride channel proteins, catalogued into the Chloride channel accessory (CLCA) family. The first member of this family to be characterized was a respiratory epithelium, Ca2+-regulated, chloride channel protein isolated from bovine tracheal apical membranes. It was biochemically characterized as a 140 kDa complex. The bovine EClC protein has 903 amino acids and four putative transmembrane segments. The purified complex, when reconstituted in a planar lipid bilayer, behaved as an anion- selective channel. It was regulated by Ca2+ via a calmodulin kinase II- dependent mechanism. Distant homologues may be present in plants, ciliates and bacteria, Synechocystis and Escherichia coli, so at least some domains within E-ClC family proteins have an ancient origin.  Genes  * CLCA1, CLCA2, CLCA3, CLCA4  CLIC family  The Chloride Intracellular Ion Channel (CLIC) Family (TC# 1.A.12) consists of six conserved proteins in humans (CLIC1, CLIC2, CLIC3, CLIC4, CLIC5, CLIC6). Members exist as both monomeric soluble proteins and integral membrane proteins where they function as chloride- selective ion channels. These proteins are thought to function in the regulation of the membrane potential and in transepithelial ion absorption and secretion in the kidney. They are a member of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) superfamily.  Structure  They possess one or two putative transmembrane Œ±-helical segments (TMSs). The bovine p64 protein is 437 amino acyl residues in length and has the two putative TMSs at positions 223-239 and 367-385. The N- and C-termini are cytoplasmic, and the large central luminal loop may be glycosylated. The human nuclear protein (CLIC1 or NCC27) is much smaller (241 residues) and has only one putative TMS at positions 30-36. It is homologous to the second half of p64. Structural studies showed that in the soluble form, CLIC proteins adopt a GST fold with an active site exhibiting a conserved glutaredoxin monothiol motif, similar to the omega class GSTs. Al Khamici et al. demonstrated that CLIC proteins have glutaredoxin-like glutathione-dependent oxidoreductase enzymatic activity. CLICs 1, 2 and 4 demonstrate typical glutaredoxin-like activity using 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide as a substrate. This activity may regulate CLIC ion channel function.  Transport reaction  The generalized transport reaction believed to be catalyzed chloride channels is: :Cl‚àí (cytoplasm) ‚Üí Cl‚àí (intraorganellar space)  CFTR  CFTR is a chloride channel belonging to the superfamily of ABC transporters. Each channel has two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide binding domains. ATP binding to both nucleotide binding domains causes changes these domains to associate, further causing changes that open up the ion pore. When ATP is hydrolyzed, the nucleotide binding domains dissociate again and the pore closes.  Pathology  Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene on chromosome 7, the most common mutation being deltaF508 (a deletion of a codon coding for phenylalanine, which occupies the 508th amino acid position in the normal CFTR polypeptide). Any of these mutations can prevent the proper folding of the protein and induce its subsequent degradation, resulting in decreased numbers of chloride channels in the body. This causes the buildup of mucus in the body and chronic infections.

Influenced by thrash metal as well as bands and artists such as Black Sabbath, Alice Cooper, Celtic Frost, Carcass and Darkthrone, they recorded their demo Hymns of the Needle Freak with their manager and producer Keith Falgout in 1993. The strength of the demo earned them a deal with Rotten Records, an independent label. They released When the Kite String Pops produced by Spike Cassidy in 1994, followed two years later by their second and final effort Paegan Terrorism Tactics (also produced by Keith Falgout). Neither gained them mainstream success, but both albums earned a high degree of underground acclaim. In 2005, another album composed of their demos, Demos: 1993‚Äì1996, was released. Break-up and subsequent projects After two studio albums, Acid Bath's career came to an abrupt end on January 23, 1997, when bass guitarist Audie Pitre and his parents were killed by a drunk driver who had run a stop sign. Kelly Pitre, Audie's brother, was the only one of four family members to survive the incident, escaping with only a broken rib and a mild neck fracture. While rumors of another album circulated after the band's end, nothing new surfaced. The supposed album was named Killer Rat Poison. Tommy Viator played keyboards on this album. Sammy Duet has only given out copies to a few close friends because he used some of the riffs for Goatwhore's earlier material.Acid Bath Setch's Unofficial Site . DialSpace fan page. Tommy Viator played drums on Disincarnate's album Dreams of the Carrion Kind with the well-known death metal guitarist James Murphy. Dax Riggs and Mike Sanchez went on to perform in the band Agents of Oblivion, releasing one self-titled album in 2000 and disbanding shortly thereafter. Starting in 2000, Riggs was also the frontman for the swamp rock band Deadboy & the Elephantmen, before he began releasing material under his own name in 2007. Sammy Pierre Duet was once a member of Crowbar, but has since left the band. He is now a member of the blackened death metal band Goatwhore and Ritual Killer and his doom metal band with Kelly Pitre (the brother of Audie) Vual. Sammy Duet has remained an open satanist since his days in Acid Bath. Audie formed a metal band in 1995, blending black metal vocals with the heavy sound of multiple bassists with no guitars, known as Shr√ºm. Tommy Viator and Joseph Fontenot were also members of Shr√ºm. Shr√ºm utilized two distorted low-end basses, and Fontenot would alternate between playing a distorted high-end bass and a clean bass. Fontenot later played bass for Devourment for two years. Joseph Fontenot is now a drill sergeant in the U.S. Army. In 2014, rumors started that Acid Bath were reuniting with a new vocalist because, Jimmy Kyle reached out to vocalist of Slipknot, Corey Taylor, with a very vague message stating \\"Acid Bath is in search of a vocalist. Please send Mp3, demo, videos or any music links performing Acid Bath songs.\\" However, these rumors were dismissed by other band members stating that \\"There is no ACID BATH without [late bassist] Audie Pitre, so there will never be ‚Äònew‚Äô ACID BATH material.\\" and that \\"Currently, most of the surviving members of ACID BATH ‚Äî Jimmy, Mike, and myself ‚Äî have been considering the possibility of doing some shows in the future, as an ACID BATH tribute band, but nothing has been set in stone, and it is still just an idea.\\" Musical style and legacy Acid Bath is best known for blending extreme, death metal-influenced sludge metal with a mixture of death growls and melancholic goth/grunge-style vocals and acoustic guitar passages, as well as use of sampling and spoken word poetry. The band sampled sound clips from controversial movies including Blue Velvet and A Clockwork Orange. Dax Riggs' vocals were processed, which produced an industrial feel; some other instruments have been processed through industrial effects in their recordings (such as the snare drum on the second half of \\"New Death Sensation\\"). One of Acid Bath's most trademark sounds was the way in which they crafted multiple tempo changes and worked them into the song structure. Their experimentation drifted into diverse territory. The song \\"Scream of the Butterfly\\" is an acoustic blues song with the drummer with double bass drum patterns toward the end of the song. The song \\"The Bones of Baby Dolls\\" experiments with folk musicianship, and the song \\"Dead Girl\\" was described as a country song by Dax Riggs. Dax Riggs' lyrics are frequently poetic, often displaying an obsession with death, drug use, mental illness, dark humor, Louisiana-based regional culture, and continuous references to animism as well as paganism, nihilism, and misanthropy. He has claimed these inspirations are culled from comic books, namely those authored by Frank Miller, Alan Moore, and Clive Barker, and has also expressed admiration for ANSWER Me! and Boiled Angel. Allmusic's William York has stated that the song \\"Venus Blue\\" could have been a radio hit \\"if not for the graphic lyrics\\".[ \\"Paegan Terrorism Tactics > Overview\\"]. AllMusic.com. Another facet of their presentation which may not have endeared them to popular sentiment was the use of art by John Wayne Gacy and Dr. Jack Kevorkian. Due to the controversy surrounding Kevorkian's artwork For He Is Raised on the album, Paegan Terrorism Tactics was initially banned from Australia.\\"Acid Bath radio interview on 106.7 The End\\". YouTube.com. User:thelostcollection (Dax Riggs). The ban has since been lifted. The cover of the band's 1994 extended play simply entitled Edits featured the artwork of Richard Ramirez. The cover of their 1996 compilation entitled Radio Edits featured the artwork of Kenneth Bianchi. Their song \\"Di√§b Soul√©\\" (\\"Drunken Devil\\" in Cajun-French) starts out with an audio sample of Jim Jones of the People's Temple screaming. Their song \\"Toubabo Koomi\\" is Cajun-French for the \\"Land of White Cannibals\\". Despite only releasing two albums, as well as a number of radio edits and an official bootleg DVD, Acid Bath gained a strong underground following (especially in Louisiana) owing to the unique, experimental nature of their music.

Because standard shuffling techniques are seen as weak, and in order to avoid \\"inside jobs\\" where employees collaborate with gamblers by performing inadequate shuffles, many casinos employ automatic shuffling machines to shuffle the cards before dealing. These machines are also used to reduce repetitive motion stress injuries to a dealer. Shuffling machines have to be carefully designed, as they can generate biased shuffles otherwise: the most recent shuffling machines are computer-controlled. The randomness or otherwise of cards produced from automatic shuffling machines is the subject of considerable interest to both gamblers and casinos. Shuffling machines come in two main varieties: continuous shuffling machines (CSMs), which shuffle one or more packs continuously, and batch shufflers or automatic shuffling machines (ASMs), which shuffle an entire single pack in a single operation. Batch shufflers are more expensive, but can avoid the problems associated with some continuous shufflers, whereby the shuffling operation only slowly changes the state of the deck, and new cards may be taken before shuffling has sufficiently randomized the pack, allowing some players to \\"shuffle track\\" cards through the shuffling process. A widely reported, but unpublished, study by Persi Diaconis and Susan Holmes in 2000 resulted in the redesign of many shuffling machines. SIAM News later published a reasonably detailed discussion of its results.  Early mechanical card shufflers  Patents regarding card shuffling devices started to appear in the United States around the end of the 19th century. It is unclear whether these devices were converted to commercial products or were discarded. These machines were often complex with many mechanical parts to achieve card retrieval, shuffling and distribution with pseudo-randomness. In 1878, Henry Ash proposed an apparatus to shuffle cards. His device was a box with an open top where the operator would place the deck. The operator would then slightly shake the box to make the cards fall through a comb at the bottom of the box. About half of the cards would fall into the lower compartment while the rest were still in the upper compartment. The operator would take these upper cards, pack them together and do the same with the lower cards. The two packs would be placed upon each other to form a new deck and the operation could be repeated for better shuffling. In 1887, Silvanus Tingley and Charles Stetson patented their \\"card shuffling apparatus\\". The device was composed of two card-holding boxes where the packs were held by springs. The device simulated a riffle shuffling by extracting the cards through a slot at the bottom of each box and placing them in a pile in the middle. The operator would turn a crank which was connected to gears and finally disks covered with rubber that were in contact with cards. This feeding mechanism ensured that the final stack was composed of cards \\"randomly\\" coming from the left or right chamber. The main difference with the next machines is that only one card would be ejected from a box during one turn. In 1892, William H. Ranney filled a patent for a \\"card shuffling and dealing mechanism\\". The apparatus was basically an inclined box which was fixed to the border of the playing table. The cards were inserted from the top of the case and were trapped inside a receptacle hold by a lever. The operator would turn a crank which would slowly lower the bottom wall of the inclined receptacle. At this point, the device relied upon the friction force between the cards to achieve some kind of randomness. One card would start to slide as a result of the steepness and would attract a few cards with it. The number of cards being released at each turn would typically vary between one and five cards. The cards fell into another receptacle and the operator would turn the whole device to distribute the cards to another player. This rotation activated a roller which would distribute the bottom card out of the box. One year later, William Ranney proposed another version of his device where the original deck was split in half and cards would fall from one or both halves at once. In 1897, two brothers, the Crooks, proposed a more complex machine which was similar to a slot machine displaying five cards. This device did not distribute cards to players but was just displaying a random sequence of cards. However, it used a shuffling mechanism that relied upon a rotating triangular frame where each side contained the same device. Only one mechanical side could operate and display cards at a moment and the operator would rotate the whole drum to perform another shuffling. A shuffling box would be split into five compartments using what they called \\"partition fingers\\". A complex pins mechanism would then mix the cards between the compartments and the new result would be displayed. John Bowen proposed in 1899 a compact \\"card shuffling machine\\" where the unshuffled pack was enclosed between two horizontal plates. The principle of this apparatus was similar to Tingley and Stetson's machine. The top plate could move and was called the follower, the bottom plate was fixed. The operator would press the deck using a vertical handle which was connected to the follower, and he would turn a crank that activated two rollers which were above and under the deck. In front of the deck, a bar would block most cards except those on top of the pack as well as those at the bottom. The rollers were pressing against the cards and with their respective rotation, would throw them into a receptacle. At each step, cards could come from the top or the bottom of the deck and the number of cards which were ejected was not constant. Variable friction between the rollers and the cards themselves ensured some randomness as in Ranney's machine. Fred C Rollings in 1899 invented a device with a rotating table where cards were spread around the center using a detent with variable pressure. In 1901, Benjamin Bellows filled a patent for his device which used \\"gravity alone for all movements of the cards\\" by dividing guiding them through moving compartments. Various mechanisms were proposed during the following years with different combinations of rollers, card-holding boxes, combs and pins systems. Most of these machines were manually run by turning a crank which would activate the inner gears and rollers. Randomness could be improved by increasing the number of shuffling turns performed by the operators or by increasing the number of boxes, combs or partitioning chambers in the machines. Some devices were simple boxes with combs that would simulate a manual shuffling like riffle shuffling. In 1925, Charles and William Gunzelmann filed a patent for a simple rhombus-shaped apparatus where the cards were inserted in an upper chamber. Shaking the device would make the cards fall into a lower compartment; the shuffling was ensured by two small wings in the middle of the box that would distribute the cards. The operator would then turn the box upside down and repeat the operation. A glass windows permitted seeing that all cards had fallen into the compartment.  Improving randomness using mechanical tricks  After 1930, inventors focused on the design of machines that could directly deal the cards, an idea that was already present in Ranney's machine back in 1892. In 1932, a dealing table was patented by Laurens Hammond. This was one of the first machines to use electricity to power the necessary shuffling and dealing mechanism. His patent description provides interesting insights regarding the problems related to previous machines: if the cards were worn or bent, the shuffling could fail. He also criticized the randomness of previous shuffling methods and pointed out the risk of predicting the final sequence. The patent also contains mathematical explanations regarding the inner state of his machine. A motor drove a rotating frame that would distribute 13 cards to each player. The machine was going through 53 cycles to distribute the 52 cards. During each cycle, a selector plate with 52 notches rotated by one step. There were four possible depths for the notches and a lug touching the notches would determine which player would receive the card. Each card was taken from the top of deck and sent to the corresponding player's receptacle using a conveyor track. The first cycle was used to rotate the plate and ensured that the distribution would start with a new sequence. One property of the machine is that the same player could be served during two or three consecutive cycles. To increase randomness, the author proposes to use a set of different selector plates or to use another deck being shuffled while people are playing. The machine was fast enough to shuffle a whole deck in a few seconds. If only one plate was used, the same dealing sequence would appear after 52 deals (there were 52 possible starting points on the plate; the starting point was not randomly chosen as the plate always rotated by one step in the same direction during each cycle). The problem of ensuring randomness using mechanical means was hard to resolve. In the early 1930s, Robert McKay proposed an ingenious machine containing a chamber with 52 balls of different diameters (for each player, there were 13 balls with the same size). Like in a lottery machine, the balls would be shaken and randomly chosen by driving them one by one into a wheel with 52 slots. This wheel would then rotate, slot by slot, and a rod in contact with the ball would \\"detect\\" its diameter. A distribution mechanism could then use the diameter information and take the appropriate action to deal the card to the correct player. Together with the lottery machines, the shuffling devices continued to evolve. In 1934, Ralph Potter invented an electromechanical machine that would read perforated cards and generates random sequences. The data would be then used to power up lamps on the gaming table. These lights symbolized cards and roulette values. Players pressed on buttons to indicate their choices to the machine. To some extent, his device was one of the first attempts to make a computerized pseudo-random generator and game console. During the rest of the 1930s, many inventions tried to address the dealing problem, mainly by using rotating frames that would distribute cards to each player around the table. Rotating parts were common in the shuffling machines; designers often used gears and plates with notches or holes whose purposes were similar to the sequence-generator plate of Hammond's machine. These shufflers shared some similarities with the machines used in cryptography such as Enigma. This German encryption device used during World War II contained rotors that stepped each time a key was typed and produced an encrypted version of the letter. Both domains must fulfill mathematical requirements regarding randomness to avoid known patterns, repeated sequences and other kind of statistical weaknesses or biases.  After World War II  After World War II, engineers tried to generate random sequences using electrical devices. Signals from electrical noise sources (like a hot cathode gas discharge tube or a resistor) would typically be sent through filters and amplifiers to output one or several random streams. Such device is described in a 1940 patent by Newby et al.. Most patented machines continued to be based on old mechanical designs that did not provide as much randomness as noise sources but were more practical. According to the patents filled during the 1950s and 1960s, designers created simple devices where a basic shuffling operation was repeated several times (by feeding the output deck back into the machine) instead of having one complex pass implying many tricky mechanical operations ending up with a poor shuffling and lower reliability. Some of them tried to reproduce what was manually done during riffle shuffling with cards interleaving each others. Cards picking using rollers in contact with the top or bottom of the deck were still heavily used at that time.  Computerized shufflers  bridge In 1969, Thomas Segers patented his \\"electronic card dealer\\" which was not working with real cards but simulating random selections. Thanks to lights, players could see the result. According to the patent, the design contains multivibrators, logical- and gates and a tube oscillator. The inventor also indicates that transistors could have been used in the circuit. In 1974, David Erickson and Richard Kronmal proposed a shuffler based upon a logic circuit with binary gates. The deck was placed in a holder and cards were extracted one by one, sent into a downward slope channel containing some flaps that would be activated or deactivated, depending upon which stack should be fed. The flap forwarded the card into the proper container and was moved by a coil controlled by the pseudo-random generator. Synchronization was important and several methods were used to ensure that the card would follow the correct path. Until the 1980s, there were not many innovations. In 1985, Edward Sammsel proposed a machine that extracted the cards from the bottom of two deck holders and put them in a second compartment. Another extractor would eject the card that was taken by the dealer. The order in which the two cards were taken from the holders was driven by a logic circuit whose main parts were a counter and a decoder. Photosensors detected how many cards were present in each compartment and if the card was taken by the dealer. In this case, another card would be processed from the initial holders.

The department's first assignment was a campaign for Natural Gas Companies, People's Natural Gas, and other local natural gas companies. The agency received national attention in 1951 when it orchestrated a sponsorship for client Westinghouse of the first nationally televised NCAA football game. As the firm's billings grew in the late 1950s, it opened offices in New York City and Washington D.C.. It acquired west coast-based agency Botsford Constantine & McCarty, forming Botsford-Ketchum in 1969. It continued acquiring other agencies throughout the 1970s and 80s, expanding internationally in Europe and Asia. George Ketchum died in September 1975. The agency changed its name to Ketchum Communications Inc. in 1981. Its major divisions became known as Ketchum Advertising, Ketchum Public Relations, and Ketchum Directory Advertising. Ketchum Public Relations moved its headquarters to New York from Pittsburgh in 1982. The agency won its first global account (with FedEx) and its first pan-European account (with Whirlpool) in 1994. In 1996, Ketchum handled the Torch relay for the Atlanta Olympics. Omnicom Group acquired Ketchum in 1996. At the time, Ketchum was the 25th-largest American agency. In 1998, Ketchum merged with British consumer agency Life PR. Ketchum sold Ketchum Advertising in 1999; the \\"Ketchum\\" name has referred solely to the PR practice since that time. In the 2000s, Ketchum acquired several firms and opened others, including the acquisition of New York management consulting firm Stromberg Consulting in 2001, the launching of influencer marketing and community building firm Emanate in 2006, and the acquisitions of clinical trial patient recruitment agency MMG in 2008, Moscow- based Maslov PR in 2010, Indian agency Sampark PR in 2011, Capstrat in North Carolina in 2012, and German lifestyle and social media PR agency Brandzeichen in 2013. Ketchum took a majority stake in Newscan's China operations in 2011, expanded Ketchum Sports & Entertainment practice into Brazil in 2012, and acquired ICON International Communications in Singapore in 2013. In the US, Ketchum partnered with luxury and lifestyle agency Harrison & Shriftman in 2011, and launched music marketing service Ketchum Sounds in 2012. In 2009, Ketchum merged with Europe-based Pleon in one of the industry's largest mergers. Ketchum merged with South Korea-based firm InComm Brodeur in 2013. Rob Flaherty became CEO of Ketchum in 2012. In 2016, Ketchum created \\"Cultivate\\", a new branch to help companies and organizations in organic food markets. In November 2017, Ketchum announced that then Partner and President Barri Rafferty would assume the role of president and chief executive officer, effective January 1, 2018. Rafferty is the first woman to lead a top five global public relations firm.  Major work  Ketchum's major clients include MasterCard, Chase, IBM, IKEA, Philips, and Pfizer. In 1985, Ketchum launched the Acura line of cars for American Honda Motor Company. Ketchum also worked on the rebranding of Orville Redenbacher's popcorn in the 1990s to appeal to a younger demographic, developed Doritos' 2006 crowdsourced \\"Crash the Super Bowl\\" contest, which won a Golden World Award from the International Public Relations Association, and created a campaign for Delta Air Lines during US Airways' 2008 bid to take over the airline after it had filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. US Airways later dropped the bid and the campaign won a Silver Anvil. The agency has also worked with Kodak in 2010, the Committee to Preserve Olympic Wrestling (CPOW)'s campaign to keep wrestling in the Olympic program, and Wendy's on the launch of the Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger in 2013, for which they were nominated as a 2014 Shorty Award finalist. In 2011, Ketchum faced backlash for a promotion for ConAgra, in which the agency hosted a dinner for food bloggers that was billed as serving food prepared by George Duran, but diners were served ConAgra frozen foods instead. Ketchum filmed each dinner and hoped to use footage of diners' reactions for promotional purposes. However, many bloggers felt tricked by the switch. Ketchum apologized and ConAgra offered reimbursement for any incurred expense to the attendees.  Crisis management  Ketchum has a team of approximately 50 crisis management executives in the US and offers a suite of related services, including Mobile RepProtect, University RepProtect for higher education, Cyber RepProtect for data security, and Game Plan for sports teams and brands. In 2011, Pennsylvania State University hired Ketchum to handle crisis communications following the Jerry Sandusky scandal in 2011. Ketchum worked with Malaysia Airlines during the search for and response to missing plane MH370 in 2014. The agency also provided crisis counseling to Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield in 2015 during the largest data breach in the US insurance industry's history.  American government work  Ketchum has fulfilled multiple contracts for the United States government, including for the Department of Education, Department of Health & Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service, and the US Army. In 2015 the agency worked with the Library of Congress to provide support for the National Book Festival. In 2004, Ketchum was accused of \\"covert propaganda\\" for a series of news stories for HHS that used actors playing journalists reporting on drug benefits without informing viewers of the government connection, for which it was found to be in violation of a federal propaganda ban by the Government Accountability Office. In 2005, the Ketchum received similarly critical coverage after the Education Department directed the agency to pay for coverage that praised President Bush's No Child Left Behind Act. The final investigation by the FCC did not find Ketchum to be at fault, but it did issue a citation for Armstrong Williams, who was paid by Ketchum to promote the NCLB Act, and fined two broadcasting companies.  Russian government work  In 2006, Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin's press attach√©, hired Ketchum to work on the 32nd G8 summit held in Saint Petersburg, to improve Russia's reputation in the West after its state-controlled energy company, Gazprom, cut off natural gas supplies to Ukraine. From 2006 to 2015, Ketchum represented the Russian Federation in the US and Europe for events including the G20 Summit, World Economic Forum, and 2014 Sochi Olympics, media and op-ed outreach. In 2013, Ketchum pitched an op-ed from Russian president Vladimir Putin on the Syrian Civil War to The New York Times. According to The Holmes Report the assignment \\"attracted plenty of mainstream media scrutiny in the US, most of it negative\\" due to the countries' political relationship. In January 2015, Politico magazine reported that Ketchum had received more than $60 million from the Kremlin for their work from 2006 to 2014. The contract between the Russian and Ketchum ended in March 2015.  Awards  As of 2016, Ketchum has won more Silver Anvils from the Public Relations Society of America than any other agency.

Designed by architect Hugh Taylor and interior design by Jac Lessman, it was the fifth resort to open on the Strip, the first four being El Rancho Vegas, The New Frontier, the still-operating Flamingo, and the now- defunct El Rancho (then known as the Thunderbird). It was situated between Desert Inn Road and Sands Avenue. The Desert Inn opened with 300 rooms and the Sky Room restaurant, headed by a chef formerly of the Ritz Paris, which once had the highest vantage point on the Las Vegas Strip. The casino, at , was one of the largest in Nevada at the time. The nine-story St. Andrews Tower was completed during the first renovation in 1963, and the 14-story Augusta Tower became the Desert Inn's main tower when it was completed in 1978 along with the seven-story Wimbledon Tower. The Palms Tower was completed in 1997 with the second and final renovation. The Desert Inn was the first hotel in Las Vegas to feature a fountain at the entrance. In 1997, the Desert Inn underwent a $200 million renovation and expansion, but after it was purchased for $270 million by Steve Wynn in 2000, he decided to demolish it and build a new hotel and resort and casino. The remaining towers of the Desert Inn were imploded in 2004. Today, the Wynn and Encore are now where the Desert Inn once stood. The original performance venue at the Desert Inn was the Painted Desert Room, later the Crystal Room, which opened in 1950 with 450 seats. Frank Sinatra made his Las Vegas debut there on September 13, 1951 and became a regular performer. The property included an 18-hole golf course which hosted the PGA Tour Tournament of Champions from 1953 to 1966. The golf course is now a part of the Wynn resort. History Young women at the hotel pool in 1955 The hotel in 1956 The hotel was situated at 3145 Las Vegas Boulevard South, between Desert Inn Road and Sands Avenue. The original name was Wilbur Clark's Desert Inn. Wilbur Clark, described by Frank Sinatra biographer James Kaplan as a \\"onetime San Diego bellhop and Reno craps dealer\\", originally began building the resort with his brother in 1947 with $250,000, but ran out of money. Author Hal Rothman notes that \\"for nearly two years the framed structure sat in the hot desert sun, looking more like an ancient relic than a nascent casino\\". Clark approached the Reconstruction Finance Corporation for investment, but it was struggling financially. In 1949, he met with Moe Dalitz, the head of the notorious Cleveland gang, the Mayfield Road Mob, and Dalitz agreed to fund 75% of the project with $1.3 million, and construction resumed. Much of the financing came from the American National Insurance Company (ANICO), though Clark became the public frontman of the resort while Dalitz remained quietly in the background as the principal owner. The resort would eventually be renamed Desert Inn and was called the \\"D.I.\\" by Las Vegas locals and regular guests. The Desert Inn opened formally on April 24, 1950, at a two-day gala which was heavily publicized nationally. Journalists from all of the major newspapers and magazines were invited, and the hotel paid $5,700 to cover air tickets. 150 invitations were sent out by Clark to VIPs with a credit limit of $10,000. About half the attendees at the opening were from California and Nevada. At the opening show in the Painted Desert Room were performers such as Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Vivian Blaine, Pat Patrick, The Donn Arden Dancers, Van Heflin, Abbott and Costello, and the Desert Inn Orchestra, led by Ray Noble. In attendance were a number of mafiosi, including Black Bill Tocco, Joe Massei, Sam Maceo, Peter Licavoli, and Frank Malone in a gala which Barbara Greenspun believed marked the beginning of heavy involvement of the mafia in the development of Las Vegas. Sidney Korshak was one of its early investors. The Desert Inn became known for its \\"opulence\\" and top-notch service. The first manager of the Desert Inn had previously worked as the manager at the Clift Hotel in San Francisco. Lew and Edie Wasserman were frequent guests of the hotel. During the 1950s, the hotel often hosted the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Winston Churchill, Adlai Stevenson, Senator John F. Kennedy, and former President Harry S. Truman. In the mid 1940s and early 1950s the city and its Chamber of Commere worked to keep the Vegas nickname of the \\"Atomic City\\" going to attract toursists. After the Desert Inn opened, so called \\"bomb parties\\" famously took place in the hotel's panoramic Sky Room, where patrons could view the detonations from a relatively safe distance while drinking Atomic Cocktails. In 1959, Lawrence Wien, owner of New York City's Plaza Hotel purchased the hotel, but signed a management deal for Clark to remain as manager. In the early 1960s, the mafia- financed casino hotels of the Las Vegas Strip and Nevada came under close scrutiny by the FBI, and they placed increased pressure on the Nevada Gaming Control Board to force the mobsters out of Las Vegas. After Sam Giancana was spotted on the premises of Frank Sinatra's Cal Neva Lodge & Casino at Lake Tahoe, his gambling license was removed by the Board and he was forced to sell up and forfeit his share in the Sands Hotel and Casino. The Desert Inn faced similar scrutiny by the FBI, attracting controversy at the same time for the involvement of Dalitz and his mobster associates, but simultaneously called for the prosecution of the FBI for illegal wiretapping. In 1964, Clark sold his remaining share in the hotel to Dalitz and business associates Morris Kleinman, Thomas McGinty and Sam Tucker. He died of a heart attack the following year. The bell captain of the Desert Inn, Jack Butler, remembered Clark: \\"Wilbur was the greatest guy. Without him this town never would've got off the ground. Everyone came into the club just to see him and he was all over the postcards. He was the only boss who would agree to have his picture taken\\". The Desert Inn's most famous guest, businessman Howard Hughes, arrived on Thanksgiving Day 1966, renting the hotel's entire top two floors. After staying past his initial ten-day reservation, he was asked to leave in December so that the resort could accommodate the high rollers who were expected for New Year's Eve. Instead of leaving, Hughes started negotiations to buy the Desert Inn. On March 27, 1967, Hughes purchased the resort from Dalitz for $6.2 million in cash and $7 million in loans. This was the first of many Las Vegas resort purchases by Hughes, including the Sands Hotel and Casino ($14.6 million) and the Frontier Hotel and Casino ($23 million). However, Hughes refused to include the PGA Tour Tournament of Champions in the deal, so Dalitz moved the tournament to his Stardust Resort and Casino in 1967 and 1968. The reclusive Hughes continued to live in his penthouse suite at the Desert Inn for four years, never leaving his bedroom. Usually unclothed, he spent his time \\"negotiating purchases and business deals with the curtains drawn and windows and doors sealed shut with tape\\", and did not allow anyone from the hotel staff to come in and clean his room. On the eve of Thanksgiving 1970, he was removed from his room on a stretcher and flown to the Bahamas. After Hughes's death in 1976, the hotel remained under the Summa Corporation, which completed the extensive renovation that he had ordered. Summa sold the hotel to Kirk Kerkorian and the Tracinda Corporation in 1986, and it became known as the MGM Desert Inn. Kerkorian sold it to ITT-Sheraton in 1993 for $160 million. Modern history The Desert Inn in its last years from 1997‚Äì2000 (order of buildings from left to right: Palms Tower, St. Andrews Tower, and Augusta Tower) In 1992, Frank Sinatra celebrated his 77th birthday at the hotel in an event which generated much media attention. Dick Taylor, the CEO of public relations firm Rogers & Cowan recalled: \\"We had the stars assemble in the casino's presidential suite and then took them in limos to the entrance of the hotel, where the press and hundreds of fans were gathered, like a Hollywood movie premiere. The stars were interviewed on the red carpet and in they went to the famed Crystal Room. It was a very big deal.\\" The golf course, which was retained with the opening of Wynn Las Vegas The property was sold to ITT Sheraton in 1993 for $160 million and renamed the Sheraton Desert Inn.http://www.a2zlasvegas.com/hotels/history/h-di.html Four years later, in 1997, ITT Sheraton undertook a $200 million renovation of the Augusta Tower and St. Andrews Tower and expansion, with the building and completion of the Palms Tower. The resort was returned to its historic name, The Desert Inn, dropping the Sheraton name, and was placed in the ITT Sheraton Luxury Collection division. ITT Sheraton itself was sold the following year to Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide. Due to losing money, Starwood immediately put The Desert Inn up for sale, and contracted a sale to Sun International Hotels Ltd. on May 19, 1999 for $275 million. The sale to Sun International fell through the following March, however. Also in 1999, Sinatra's and the Rat Pack's estate managers, Sheffield Enterprises Inc., sued the Desert Inn, claiming an infringement of rights in their use of Sinatra's name and persona in its advertising and sales, including the words \\"Frank\\", \\"Ol' Blue Eyes,\\" \\"the chairman of the Board\\" and \\"The Rat Pack\\". Sinatra's estate specifically objected to their use in \\"billboard advertising, marquees, alcoholic beverages and wine menus, and on the front and back of tee-shirts and caps at its gift shop\\" and alleged photographs of Sinatra and his signature on the walls behind the bar near the entrance to the Starlight Lounge of the Desert Inn. The Desert Inn celebrated its 50th anniversary on April 24, 2000. Celebrations were held for a week and a celebrity golf tournament was held with the likes of Robert Loggia, Chris O'Donnell, Robert Urich, Susan Anton, Vincent Van Patten and Tony Curtis. As part of the festivities, a time capsule was buried in a granite burial chamber on April 25, to be reopened on April 25, 2050. Three days later, on April 27, Steve Wynn purchased the resort from Starwood for $270 million. Wynn closed the Desert Inn at 2:00 a.m. on August 28, 2000. On October 23, 2001, the Augusta Tower, the Desert Inn's southernmost building, was imploded to make room for a mega resort that Wynn planned to build. Coming a month after the September 11 attacks, the implosion was marked with less fanfare than previous Las Vegas demolition spectacles due to its similarity to the collapse of the Twin Towers. Originally intended to be named Le R√™ve, the new project opened as Wynn Las Vegas. The remaining two towers, the St. Andrews Tower and Palms Tower were both temporarily used as the Wynn Gallery, spanning to display some of Wynn's art collection. The St. Andrews Tower and Palms Tower were finally imploded on November 16, 2004. Architecture and features The initial hotel, a $6.5 million property set in 200 acres, was designed by Hugh Taylor who was hired after Wilbur Clark and Wayne McAllister could not agree on the design. Interiors were by noted New York architect Jac Lessman. The property conveyed the image of a \\"southwestern spa\\" that was \\"half ranch house, half nightclub\\". It was built of \\"cinder blocks but trimmed with sandstone and finished throughout the inside with redwood\\". The logo of the hotel was a Joshua tree cactus. The driveway into the hotel passed under an \\"old-fashioned ranch sign\\" bearing the name Wilbur Clark's Desert Inn in scripted letters. The Desert Inn was the first hotel in Las Vegas to feature a fountain at the entrance. A \\"Dancing Waters\\" show involved the fountain jets choreographed to music. The interior of the hotel was finished in redwood with flagstone flooring. The public space included a registration area, a casino, two bars, a coffee shop, a restaurant, various commercial shops and services, and a broadcasting station for K-RAM radio. Guest rooms were located in wings situated behind the main building, surrounding the figure-eight swimming pool. The hotel originally had 300 rooms, each outfitted with air conditioning with individual thermostats. The lounge was located in a three-story, glass-sided tower at the front of the hotel known as the Sky Room, which was the largest structure on the Strip at the time of its construction and commanded views of the mountains and desert all around, as well as overlooked the \\"Dancing Waters\\" feature. The Sky Room restaurant was headed by a chef formerly of the Ritz Paris. The original performance venue at the Desert Inn was the 450 seat Painted Desert Room, later the Crystal Room, which opened in 1950 with 450 seats. Charles Cobelle created the handpainted murals, and a \\"band car\\" was used to move the orchestra within the showroom. Next door was a restaurant, the Cactus Room. The Kachina Doll Ranch was a supervised play area for guests' children. The hotel had a ladies salon and health club from the outset. Another performance venue at the hotel was the Lady Luck Lounge. The hotel in 1970 The hotel first underwent renovation in the early 1960s, during which the St. Andrews Tower was built in 1963. In the 1970s, the hotel underwent a $54-million renovation under Howard Hughes, which resumed under the responsibility of the Summa Corporation after his death in 1976. The 14-story Augusta Tower became the Desert Inn's main tower when it was completed in 1978. The seven-story Wimbledon Tower contained duplex suites, and resembled a modern version of a Mayan pyramid. It overlooked the golf course and was built at the same time, bringing the total room count to 825. By 1978, most of the 1950s structures on the property had been replaced with modern buildings and the property was renamed the Desert Inn and Country Club. It featured full country club amenities open to guests of the hotel, including a club house, driving range, pro shop, restaurant and lounge at the golf club; 10 tournament-class outdoor tennis courts; and a spa. Three restaurants were added: the \\"small, intimate\\" Monte Carlo Room, the \\"gourmet\\" Portofino Room, and the Ho Wan Chinese restaurant. At the time of its sale to ITT-Sheraton in 1993, the Desert Inn had the largest frontage of any casino hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, measuring feet. In 1997, the Desert Inn underwent a $200 million renovation and expansion by Steelman Partners, giving it a new Mediterranean-looking exterior with white stucco and red clay tile roofs. The room count was reduced to 715 to provide more luxurious accommodations. The nine-story Palm Tower was completed, the lagoon-style pool was added, and notable changes were made to the Grand Lobby Atrium, Starlight Lounge, Villas Del Lago, and new golf shop and country club. The seven-story lobby, fully built in marble, was also a major part of the renovation. Casino At its opening in 1950, the casino, at , was one of the largest in Nevada at the time. The windowless room included \\"five crap tables, three roulette wheels, four black jack tables and 75 slot machines\\", together with a sportsbook. Hundreds of coin-operated gambling machines ‚Äì including slot machines, video poker, 21, and keno ‚Äì were installed during the 1978 renovation. The casino acquired a reputation for attracting the high rollers. On January 27, 2000, the Megabucks jackpot record for Las Vegas was broken when $34,955,489 was won by an anonymous gambler at the Desert Inn, playing a bank of six Megabucks machines near the hotel's coffee shop. Golf course and country club (L. to r.) Ed Sullivan, Red Skelton and Wilbur Clark playing golf at the hotel in June 1959 The 18-hole, par-72 Desert Inn Golf Club opened in 1952. Initially, Dalitz had pushed the idea of opening a golf course next to the hotel with an entrance off the Strip, which would be accessible to other hotels and boost the city's profile as a resort destination. When other hotel owners rejected this idea, Dalitz built the course on the hotel premises. He also opened an outdoor dining area, to accommodate golfers and swimmers who might prefer a more informal atmosphere. The course hosted the PGA Tour Tournament of Champions from 1953 to 1966, attracting professional golfers such as Sam Snead, Arnold Palmer, and Jack Nicklaus. Allard Roen was director of the tournament for many years, and was instrumental in breaking down the racial barrier on the Strip. He broke the all-white club convention by permitting Sammy Davis, Jr. to play on the course. From 1958 it hosted the Golf Cup Golf Tournament, the largest tournament in the world for amateur golfers. State Historical Marker in front of the relocated Morelli House According to the Las Vegas Sun, the course \\"held the distinction of being the only golf course in the United States to have annually hosted three championship tour events ‚Äì the PGA Tour's Las Vegas Invitational, the Las Vegas Senior Classic and the LPGA Las Vegas International\\". The Panasonic Las Vegas Invitational, now the Las Vegas Invitational, returned to the Desert Inn in 1983, and became known as the wealthiest PGA event in the world. It has since been won by the likes of Fuzzy Zoeller, Curtis Strange, Greg Norman, and Paul Azinger. The Las Vegas Senior Classic event at the Desert Inn was added to the Senior PGA Tour in 1986, and has since been won by Bruce Crampton (1986), Al Geiberger, who equaled the course record at the time of 62 (1987), Larry Mowry (1988) and Lee Trevino (1992). Wilbur Clark was the first to build a home on the golf course in the 1950s. Additional homes were added to the Desert Inn Country Club Estates from the 1960s on. During his ownership of the hotel, Howard Hughes built 100 residential units on the property. After Steve Wynn purchased the resort in 2000 and announced that the real estate was too valuable to leave as a golf course, homeowners were forced to sell their properties to Wynn and his property developer Irwin Molasky. Molasky bought homes closest to the golf course for $2 million each, and homes on the perimeter of the resort for $900,000 to $1.2 million each. The Junior League of Las Vegas convinced Wynn to save one house from demolition and moved it to a lot in downtown Las Vegas to serve as its headquarters. This was the Morelli House, designed by architect Hugh Taylor for Antonio Morelli, a \\"rare example of modernist architecture in Las Vegas\\". The house was subsequently listed on the City and State historic registers. Performances The Hello America Revue in the Crystal Room of the Desert Inn, 1967 Almost every major star of the latter half of the 20th century played at the Desert Inn. Frank Sinatra made his Las Vegas debut at the Desert Inn on September 13, 1951. He later said of it: \\"Wilbur Clark gave me my first job in Las Vegas. That was in 1951. For six bucks you got a filet mignon dinner and me\\". No√´l Coward performed at the Inn on one occasion for an entire month. In 1954, after a performance at the Desert Inn, Betty Hutton announced one of her several retirements. In 1958, Tony Martin was signed to a five-year deal at $25,000 per week, making him the highest paid performer in Las Vegas. Eddie Fisher was heckled by a disguised Elizabeth Taylor during a 1961 performance, in a year which saw Dinah Shore booked for her fourth performance and debut Vegas performances at the Desert Inn by both Benny Goodman and Rosemary Clooney. In 1979, Jet magazine noted that Wayne Newton was \\"enthroned\\" at the Desert Inn as king of entertainment idols\\", earning $10 million a year, which made him the highest-paid nightclub performer of all time. Other performers in its famous \\"crystal showroom\\" over the years included Patti Page, Ted Lewis, Joe E. Lewis, Bobby Darin, Jimmy Durante, Tony Bennett, Paul Anka, Dionne Warwick, Louise Mandrell, and more. Louis Prima and Keely Smith recorded their 1960 Dot Records LP On Stage live at the Desert Inn. Bobby Darin's famous album Live! At the Desert Inn was recorded at the hotel in February 1971. In 1992, a week-long celebration of Frank Sinatra's 77th birthday at the Desert Inn was held and later in January it was announced that Sinatra, Liza Minnelli, Paul Anka, Shirley MacLaine, Dean Martin, Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme had all signed a two-year engagement agreeing to perform at least five weeks annually. Film and television Classic image of Wilbur Clark's Desert Inn, 1955 Portions of Ocean's 11 were shot at the Desert Inn. It is one of the five Las Vegas hotels robbed on New Year's Eve by the characters played by Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and others in the film. Orson Welles' film F for Fake covers, among other topics, the scandal of a fake biography of Howard Hughes, and the billionaire's Desert Inn residence is illustrated by Welles. In the 1985 film Lost in America, Julie Hagerty's character Linda Howard loses the couple's \\"nest egg\\" at the Desert Inn, leading to a memorable scene in which Albert Brooks' character David Howard tries to convince the Casino manager (Garry Marshall) to give them their money back. David, an ad man, proposes a campaign centered around the generosity of the casino in his case, replete with a jingle: \\"The Desert Inn has heart... The Desert Inn has heart.\\" The opening scene to the 1993 film Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit took place in the Grand Ballroom of the Hotel. The Desert Inn saw its last commercial use in the 2001 film Rush Hour 2, shortly before it was imploded. It was converted into the \\"Red Dragon\\", an Asian-themed casino set. The hotel served as the primary backdrop for the TV show Vega$ which aired on ABC from 1978 to 1981. The 1980s Aaron Spelling soap opera Dynasty included footage of the hotel, and use of the Presidential Suite. The hit 1980s NBC TV series Remington Steele filmed its 60th Las Vegas-set episode at the inn, where both the exterior and interior are shown regularly throughout the episode. Legacy The closure of the Desert Inn in 2000 and subsequent demolition was unpopular with many as it seemed to mark the end of old Las Vegas. Historian Michael Green stated: \\"To a lot of people outside of Las Vegas, these two places (the Desert Inn and the Sands) really meant Las Vegas. These were the places that represent the images of Las Vegas, in a far greater way than the Dunes, the Aladdin, the Hacienda and the Landmark\\". Robert Maheu, Howard Hughes's head of Nevada operations and publicist for many years, remarked that the \\"Desert Inn was the gem of Las Vegas\\". The hotel remained popular with locals until the end, as the heavily tourism-driven modern Las Vegas emerged in the 1990s. Desert Inn Road Desert Inn Road, an east‚Äìwest Las Vegas Valley roadway, still exists.

Rogers, was an American surveyor now best remembered for his discovery of the Rogers Pass in British Columbia, Canada. He also has the distinction of having Rogers Pass in the U.S. state of Montana named after him, following his description of the pass in 1887.  Early life  Born in Orleans, Massachusetts in 1829, he attended Brown University, but transferred after one year to Yale University, where he obtained a degree in Engineering. Rogers served with the U.S. Cavalry during the Indian Wars, attaining the rank of major during the 1862 Dakota Sioux uprising.  CPR surveys  His initial engineering experience was primarily on the American prairies surveying for the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. Nevertheless, James Jerome Hill of the Canadian Pacific Railway hired Rogers in April 1881 to find a rail route through the Selkirk and Rocky Mountains. Rogers carefully studied the reports of earlier surveyors, particularly those of Walter Moberly from 1865. Moberly's assistant Albert Perry had previously described the approach to a potential pass from the Columbia River along the Illecillewaet River. In later years, Moberly claimed the pass should have been named Perry's Pass. Rogers was a tough task master and was disliked by many of those who worked under him. They suffered under basic and meagre food supplies while being driven to continue on. One party avoided starvation by sheer luck when they were able to quickly canoe downstream. On May 28, 1881, his birthday, Rogers found a pass through the mountains. He approached from the west up the Illecillewaet River but he failed to reach the pass by a mere because of the lack of food supplies and was forced to turn back west. It was not until the following year that he was able to approach the pass from the east, along the Beaver River. On July 24, 1882, he managed to reach the same pass that he had only observed in the distance the previous year. In gratitude, the Canadian Pacific named the pass for him and presented Rogers with a cheque for $5,000. Rogers initially refused to cash the cheque, preferring rather to display it in a frame. It was not until Van Horne promised him a gold watch as a souvenir that he consented to cash the cheque.  Post Rogers Pass  In 1887, while surveying again for James J. Hill, but this time for the Great Northern Railway, he was searching for a pass over the continental divide and located Rogers Pass in Montana. Though the Great Northern eventually selected Marias Pass, to the north of Rogers Pass, as the continental divide pass for their transcontinental rail route, the Great Northern named Rogers Pass in Montana for the surveyor. Rogers Pass in Montana became the route of Montana Highway 200, the highway route between Great Falls and Missoula, Montana. His surveying career was curtailed after he was badly injured falling from his horse while surveying the right-of-way for the Great Northern Railway near Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. He died 4 May 1889 at Waterville, Minnesota, where he spent retirement at the home of his brother. Although some sources report that he died as a result of his injuries, others indicate that he suffered from cancer of the stomach.

It is the sixth-oldest, all-male, college Greek-letter organization founded in North America (only Kappa Alpha Society, Sigma Phi, Delta Phi, Alpha Delta Phi, and Psi Upsilon predate). It is popularly and informally known as \\"DU\\" or \\"Delta U\\" and its members are called \\"DUs\\". Although historically found on the campuses of small New England private universities, Delta Upsilon currently has 76 chapters/colonies across the United States and Canada. A number of its buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2013, Business Insider named Delta Upsilon one of the \\"17 Fraternities with Top Wall Street Alumni\\". Notable members include President of the United States James A. Garfield, president of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos, Canadian prime minister Lester B. Pearson, Linus Pauling, Joseph P. Kennedy, Lou Holtz, Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., Charles Evans Hughes, Les Aspin, and others. Forty-two brothers of the fraternity have sat in the United States Congress, three in the Parliament of Canada, one in the Imperial House of Peers of Japan, and six on the Queen's Privy Council for Canada. Its members have received six Nobel Prizes, five Olympic gold medals, one Pulitzer Prize, four Medals of Honor, one Lenin Peace Prize, one Presidential Medal of Freedom, seven investitures into the Order of Canada, and one investiture each into the Order of St Michael and St George, the Order of Merit, and the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. In 2018, the fraternity adopted policies to reduce risk. As of August 1, 2018, hard alcohol was banned from all chapter houses. As of August 1, 2020, chapter houses must be \\"substance free\\" (including wine, beer, and drugs), except for chapters that obtained waivers through 2022, based upon good behavior. History=Founding and early history Delta Upsilon's mother chapter was founded in 1834 in the West College building (pictured) at Williams College. Delta Upsilon was founded in 1834, when thirty freshman, sophomore, and junior students at Williams College met in the Freshman Recitation Room at the West College building to form what was then called \\"the Social Fraternity\\". The move was in response to the establishment of Kappa Alpha and Sigma Phi at the college and, unlike those fraternities, the Social Fraternity was avowedly anti-secret. Its founding came at the tail-end of the anti-Masonic hysteria that had recently swept the United States, though the idea that it was part of the popular backlash to Freemasonry has generally been rejected (a mysterious fire in 1841 destroyed the records of the first meeting of the Social Fraternity, erasing much of the organization's early history). Growth of the Social Fraternity (whose members were informally called the \\"Oudens\\") was exponential. By 1838 two-thirds of all students at Williams belonged to the society which engaged in militant agitation against the other two fraternities. One particularly violent incident occurred in 1839 when Oudens assaulted the Kappa Alpha house, driving its occupants to the top of Consumption Hill. More refined conflict took the form of pamphlets and debate. An 1855 debate proposed by Kappa Alpha against the Oudens was called-off after the Social Fraternity appointed James Garfield, an Ouden well known for his rhetorical skills, to represent them. In November 1847 Williams' Social Fraternity met with similar societies that had recently been formed at Union College, Hamilton College, and Amherst College and formed the \\"Anti-Secret Confederation\\". A second meeting of the Anti- Secret Confederation (A.S.C.) in 1852 saw fraternities from Wesleyan University, Case Western Reserve University, Colby College, and the University of Vermont join. At the 1862 convention, the fraternity's mother chapter, Williams, declared the purposes of the fraternity had been corrupted and, over the objections of the other chapters, withdrew. Two years later it dissolved itself. A chapter would eventually be restored. However, Williams being the first chapter and, therefore, self-chartering, this would come in the form of a new chapter and not the revival of the original. It was permanently erased when Williams College banned all fraternities in 1962. K≈çjir≈ç Matsukata (bottom right), the son of Prince Matsukata, was initiated into Delta Upsilon at Rutgers University in 1885. The March 1864 convention of the A.S.C. saw the organization formally change its name to Delta Upsilon, standardize insignia and ritual throughout all its member chapters, and establish a centralized administrative structure. Abandoning \\"anti-secrecy\\" In 1879, Delta Upsilon formally disavowed its policy of anti-secrecy, instead adopting a program of what it described as \\"non-secrecy\\". According to Delta Upsilon, the reason for this change was because it had been absolutely victorious in its battle against secrecy, \\"the character of the secret societies so altered, that hostility toward them decreased\\". This explanation has been more skeptically received by some, with one period observer caustically noting that Delta Upsilon \\"reveals very little more of what it does than the latter [secret fraternities]\\". Others commented that chapter meetings were closed to all but initiated members and the fraternity was now practicing selective pledging and initiation, in contrast to its earliest days at Williams. Therefore, it was proffered, the description of the fraternity as a \\"private\\" society rather than a \\"non-secret\\" one might be more accurate. The Harvard Crimson, meanwhile, poetically attributed the official change of position as due to \\"the sheer exhaustion of those that heretofore have maintained a vigorous tilt at the windmill for exercise's sake, on finding that the windmill stands the attack much better than they\\". Writing in 2013, Benjamin Wurgraft of the New School for Social Research commented that Delta Upsilon's changes made it \\"nothing more than another fraternity‚Äîa rival for pledges rather than a force for unity\\". Chief Justice of the United States Charles Evans Hughes served as president of Delta Upsilon and oversaw its incorporation. 20th century Delta Upsilon members from the University of Washington chapter attend a rush party aboard the SS Tacoma in 1916. At the turn of the century the fraternity's growth plateaued due, in part, to opposition from a group of chapters to what was seen as the lessening of the fraternity's standards through colonization. In 1898, Delta Upsilon joined the recent trend of fraternity expansion into Canada by chartering a chapter at McGill University in Montreal. However, most expansion in this period came in the form of the annexation of established local fraternities. Zeta Chi at Baker University was one local which unsuccessfully petitioned for annexation by Delta Upsilon. In 1909, Charles Evans Hughes led the incorporation of the fraternity. By 1920 the fraternity had grown to 44 chapters. Gen. John Arthur Clark, the celebrated former commander of the Seaforth Highlanders and a Member of Parliament from Vancouver, was elevated to \\"international president\\", the fraternity's penultimate office, in 1944, holding it for three consecutive terms. Clark became the first Canadian to hold the Delta Upsilon presidency. In the 1950s, former Delta Upsilon international president Horace G. Nichol served as president of the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC). He was recognized for his work leading the NIC with the NIC Gold Medal in 1959. The turbulence the Greek system experienced in the middle 20th century began for Delta Upsilon in 1956. That year's sitting of the Undergraduate Convention was dissolved by emergency action of DU leadership to \\"prevent open dissension\\" in the wake of the election of an African-American as president of the Brown University chapter. The election had been denounced by a number of the fraternity's new southern chapters. Stained glass at McGill University's Redpath Library shows St. George coated in the tabard of Delta Upsilon. It commemorates 23 McGill members of Delta Upsilon killed in World War I. By 1986 Delta Upsilon had 88 active chapters, increasing to a high of 92 in 1991. During the 1990s chapters at Rutgers University, Cornell University, Oklahoma State University, the University of Nebraska and Union College were closed or placed on probation after it was revealed pledges at those houses had been branded, paddled, and forced to eat garbage, among other things. 21st century Beginning in 2009 the Fraternity implemented a series of changes that radically reshaped the organization. The fraternity closed a quarter of its chapters for poor performance, including risky behaviors, poor grades, and weak service records. Then it opened a similar number of new chapters under the close guidance of the national organization. The fraternity doubled its staff, from 11 to 22 and added new employees with advanced degrees in higher education or nonprofit management. The fraternity placed an emphasis on the number of members attending educational programming, including international service work and today more than half of undergraduate members participate in at least one educational program per year. Among the chapters targeted for closure was one of the fraternity's longest enduring chapters, the 120-year-old Technology chapter at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Though the shuttering of the Technology chapter was for what fraternity officials would only describe as inappropriate behavior, The Tech reported an investigation by Delta Upsilon had allegedly uncovered a prohibited \\"secret ritual\\" that had been performed by the chapter for the preceding 70 years. Officers of the Technology chapter, which one account described had a \\"growing distance from [the] international fraternity\\", rejected the charges, though acknowledged they had effectively stopped participating in the fraternity's programs. In denying an appeal for restoration of the chapter, Delta Upsilon headquarters explained that they had \\"been working in coordination with university staff\\" but had been unable to reach a solution by which the chapter could continue at MIT. On March 28, 2009, Delta Upsilon established its 152nd chapter, and the second of the 21st century, at Webster University in St. Louis, Missouri. The initiation was significant as it was the first time in more than a century that Delta Upsilon established a chapter at a school where no previous fraternities and sororities existed. Secessionist chaptersDelta Psi= In 1854 the University of Vermont chapter, which was named Delta Psi, severed its connections with the Anti-Secret Confederation. The cause of separation is lost to history with Delta Upsilon's own records recording that the exit of Delta Psi is \\"from causes unknown to us\\". A Delta Psi historian later claimed the withdrawal was due to the expenses the fraternity was incurring sending delegates to the meetings of the Anti-Secret Confederation. It has also been speculated that Delta Psi felt local pressure in maintaining the A.S.C.'s militant stance against secret ritual; after separating from the A.S.C. it began to undertake secret work. (Delta Upsilon has maintained that it does not consider members of Delta Psi during the period it was affiliated with the A.S.C. to also be members of Delta Upsilon, the separation being so total that the \\"action removed all its members from membership in the Delta Upsilon fraternity\\".) Delta Psi continued as a very successful local fraternity for 150 years after leaving Delta Upsilon. During this period, DU avoided attempts to colonize the University of Vermont. In 2014, ten years after the collapse of Delta Psi, Delta Upsilon entered the Burlington campus for the first time since its split with Delta Psi, chartering a colony. =D.U. Club and Oak Club= Delta Upsilon's first Harvard chapter revolted, disaffiliated, and ultimately merged with the Fly Club, whose clubhouse is pictured. A more recent colonization attempt proved similarly disastrous. When the fraternity incorporated in 1909 it adopted a new constitution. The Harvard chapter immediately set-forth its views that the new constitution had been illegitimately enacted and had overly vested control in the professional leadership, undermining the ability of the chapters to democratically express themselves. Though a number of other chapters initially signaled support for the Harvard position, a proposed amendment to the new document failed. In 1915 the Harvard chapter stopped paying dues to the fraternity. A further shot across the bow of the international fraternity came when Harvard requested headquarters stop sending copies of the Delta Upsilon Quarterly because they \\"littered up the house\\". Open revolt came when the international fraternity tried to impose discipline on Harvard. Harvard responded by declaring it didn't recognize the authority of DU headquarters as Delta Upsilon had ceased to exist in 1909. Delta Upsilon sued its rebellious chapter whose leaders included toy heir F.A.O. Schwarz Jr. Following the courtroom triumph of the DU headquarters, it expelled the rebellious members and initiated a hand-picked pledge class to continue the chapter. Its victory was short-lived, though, as the recreated chapter itself voted to disaffiliate from Delta Upsilon. The secessionist group legally reconstituted itself as \\"the D.U. Club\\", taking the chapter roll book with them, and existed as a successful finals club for many decades on the Harvard campus. In 1995, the D.U. Club closed after an assault of a football recruit occurred at its clubhouse. The D.U. Club's alumni board voted to merge its alumni with the Fly Club. After several decades of patient waiting for the D.U. Club to pass, Delta Upsilon chartered yet another chapter at Harvard. The new chapter was installed in 1999, four years after the D.U. Club had merged with the Fly Club. It unraveled faster than its predecessors, however. In 2005 the six-year-old Delta Upsilon chapter voted to disaffiliate from the fraternity. It has continued under the name \\"Oak Club\\" and currently claims more than 100 alumni who, it says, embody \\"many of the original DU principles\\". =Kappa Delta Upsilon= Delta Upsilon's chapter at Brown University, which was organized in 1868, disaffiliated in 1967, reforming as a local known as Kappa Delta Upsilon (so named because it was the tenth chapter of Delta Upsilon and Kappa is the tenth letter of the Greek alphabet). The decision came after a decade of strained relations with the DU headquarters, originating in its decision to declare an emergency and dissolve the 1956 sitting of the Undergraduate Convention, a move it said was necessary to \\"prevent open dissension\\". (The preceding year, the Brown DU chapter had elected an African-American as chapter president causing the fraternity's new southern chapters to threaten a boycott of the convention.) Almost 20 years later, in 1986, the Brown chapter rejoined Delta Upsilon. Terry Bullock, then Delta Upsilon international president, wrote of the return of Brown that \\"there is no greater joy than the reconciliation of a family estranged for many years\\". The joy was short-lived, however, as the chapter again voted to disaffiliate in 1991, reverting to the name Kappa Delta Upsilon. In 1996 Kappa Delta Upsilon was banned from campus for 5 years due to the circumstances surrounding a fire in its basement. It has yet to reestablish itself. \\"Four Founding Principles\\" The Fraternity's Four Founding Principles originated in the Preamble to the early Constitution of the Anti-Secret Confederation. They remained unchanged until the 1891 Convention undertook a complete revision of the Constitution, article-by-article. In the new revision, the old Preamble was completely stricken and the following text was added to Article 1, Section 2: \\"The objects of this Fraternity shall include the promotion of friendship, the exertion of moral influence, the diffusion of liberal culture, and the advancement of equity in college affairs. It shall be non-secret.\\" This version remained with minor changes until around 1923, when the first printed example of the current version was published in that year's edition of the Manual of Delta Upsilon. The \\"Four Founding Principles\\" are currently: the Advancement of Justice, the Promotion of Friendship, the Development of Character, and the Diffusion of Liberal Culture. Symbols=Badge An illustrated representation of the badge, which also forms part of the crest of the arms. A newly initiated brother of the Boise State University chapter of Delta Upsilon receives the fraternity's badge in 2011. The current Delta Upsilon badge was submitted to the fraternity's 1858 convention by a \\"badge committee\\", chaired by Edward Gardner. It features the Greek letter Delta superimposed on an Upsilon. The arms of the Upsilon each have a word of the Fraternity motto engraved on them in Greek letters, the left arm ŒîŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒ±, the right arm Œ•œÄŒøŒ∏Œ∑Œ∫Œ∑. The Associate Member Pin, also known as the Pledge Pin, consists of a gold Delta on blue enamel with a gold Upsilon in the center. Coat of arms The coat of arms were assumed following incorporation. It is blazoned as Or, a balanced scale proper on a chief Azure, seven mullets of the first, four, and three. The crest is a monogram of the Greek letter Delta surcharged upon the letter Upsilon bearing the motto in Greek letters between two scrolls, the dexter charged with the number \\"1834\\", the sinister charged with the number \\"1909\\". The supporters are the heraldic banners of the arms of the Undergraduate Convention (Or, an oak tree proper on a mount in base Vert, on a chief Azure annulets (in fesse) co-joined) and the arms of the Assembly of Trustees (Azure, a chevron between five coronets, Or two, one and two). Colors The colors of the Fraternity were approved as \\"Old Gold and Sapphire Blue\\" by the 1881 Convention. In 1866, the Convention first adopted \\"Chrome and Blue\\" as the official colors. These were altered to simply \\"Gold and Blue\\" in 1879, before taking on their current form in 1881. Flag The current version of the Fraternity Flag was established in 1911 and consists of three vertical bars, blue, gold, and blue. The gold section is charged with the fraternity's badge. A flag of a solid gold field charged with a visual representation of the pledge pin is used by colonies. A Delta Upsilon member wearing the fraternity ribbon with badge. Hat band The fraternity's by- laws formerly prescribed a puggaree to band a boater hat that is black silk with the middle third occupied by alternating stripes of gold, blue, and gold. The hat band was initially only sold through the head office, however, in 1922 Delta Upsilon began licensing a small number of hatter shops, primarily in Manhattan and New England, to produce and sell the puggaree for $1 if the customer first displayed their badge to the clerk as a mark of identification. Motto The Fraternity's motto is \\"Dikaia Upotheke\\" which the fraternity translates from Ancient Greek‚Äî\\"ŒîŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒ± Œ•œÄŒøŒ∏Œ∑Œ∫Œ∑\\"‚Äîto mean \\"Justice, Our Foundation\\". The motto was adopted in 1858. Until this time, the motto of the Williams Chapter, \\"Ouden Adelon\\", meaning \\"Nothing Secret\\", was used. Ribbon The design of the ribbon is similar to the interior stripes of the hat band, but with colors reversed. It is 36-inches in length with open ends, designed to be crossed and fastened by the badge. Seal The seal of the fraternity, which is in the custody of the international headquarters in Indianapolis, is affixed to chapter charters and membership certificates. It is described in the fraternity's constitution as the shield of the coat of arms set in a circular band on which is inscribed \\"Delta Upsilon Fraternity 1834‚Äì1909\\". Songs Cover of the sheet music to the 1896 publishing of the Delta Upsilon March melody to Hail, Delta Upsilon The fraternity hymn is \\"Hail, Delta Upsilon\\". The \\"Delta Upsilon Ode\\" is also used for special occasions; its melody and lyrics were penned by Edward La Wall Seip of Delta Upsilon's Lafayette College chapter. \\"Tis the Plan of Delta U\\" by John Briggs and Joel Slocum, from the fraternity's Rochester University and Colby College chapters respectively, tells of the expansion of Delta Upsilon into Canada (poetically termed \\"Our Lady of the Snows\\") leading to the hearts of Americans and Canadians being \\"linked together at the shrine of Delta U\\". The traditional air \\"Down Among the Dead Men\\" is used as a toasting song at formal dinners with slightly modified lyrics penned by Joyce Kilmer in which those who deny the ritual toast to \\"our beloved Delta U\\" are condemned to lay \\"down among the dead men\\". The \\"Delta Upsilon Sweetheart Song\\" is a courting song used in different ways by different chapters. At Ohio University, for instance, it is performed at the chapter's spring cotillion and it has also been played at the weddings of members. A more extensive volume of fraternity songs is indexed in the fraternity's songbook Songs My Brothers Taught Me. Organization The University of Illinois Delta Upsilon house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Chapters Delta Upsilon is currently organized into 68 active chapters, of which four are in Canada and the remainder in the United States. The United States chapters are divided into five provinces, each overseen by a governor appointed by the international president. The Canadian chapters are grouped into what the fraternity calls \\"the Canadian conference\\". Chapters are named after the school at which they are sited, with the exception of the now-defunct City College of New York chapter which was called the Manhattan chapter. This map shows the expansion of active undergraduate chapters of Delta Upsilon from 1834 to 2014 in the United States (Canada not reflected here). Governance The Undergraduate Convention and the Assembly of Trustees meet annually. They form the bicameral legislature of the fraternity and make, repeal, and adopt fraternity law. An indirectly elected board oversees the operations of the fraternity between meetings of the two chambers and hires an executive-director who manages the full-time secretariat which, according to the fraternity, currently employees 21 persons. Headquarters The Butler Memorial Headquarters Building is located in Indianapolis, Indiana. Completed in 1971, it is located on a road with eight other fraternity and sorority headquarters (prior to this, the fraternity was headquartered in New York city). The building was financed with a bequest from Lester E. Cox, a University of Pennsylvania chapter alumnus who left half his estate to the fraternity. It is named in honor of Wilford A. Butler, who served as the fraternity's executive director from 1963 to 1987. The chapter house of the Iowa State University chapter of Delta Upsilon is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the headquarters building is a display of all TIME Magazine covers on which Delta Upsilon members have appeared. According to the fraternity, the reproduction of early covers of the magazine was authorized by TIME editor-in-chief Hedley Donovan, a member of Delta Upsilon's University of Minnesota chapter. The fraternity's headquarters stores its archives and records from 1942 to the present. Older records are in the custody of the Manuscripts and Archives Division of the New York Public Library. Publications The Delta Upsilon Quarterly began publication in 1882 as the fraternity's official magazine. In 1906 the Alpha Tau Omega Palm declared it was, among all fraternity journals, second in quality only to the Kappa Sigma Caduceus. The Cornerstone: Delta Upsilon's Guide to College and Beyond is the fraternity's membership manual. It includes not only information on the history and principles of the fraternity, but also guidelines on dress, speech, manners, and formal etiquette. Notable members Former President of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos Calder√≥n, is a Delta Upsilon member from the fraternity's University of Kansas chapter The fraternity's membership roster includes United States President James A. Garfield (Williams 1856), Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court Charles Evans Hughes (Colgate and Brown 1881), United States Senator-Vermont Justin S. Morrill (Middlebury 1860), former Commander in Chief of the US Central Command Tommy Franks (Texas 1963), author Stephen Crane (Lafayette and Syracuse 1894), author Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. (Cornell 1944), former Chairman and CEO of Walt Disney Co. Michael D. Eisner (Denison 1964), and Nobel Prize recipients Charles Dawes (Marietta 1884), Christian B. Anfinsen (Swarthmore 1937), and Edward C. Prescott (Swarthmore 1962). Notable Canadian DUs include Prime Minister and Nobel Prize recipient Lester B. Pearson (Toronto 1919), actor Alan Thicke (Western Ontario 1967), Alberta premier E. Peter Lougheed (Alberta 1959), Ontario premier John P. Robarts (Western Ontario 1939), and Minister of Foreign Affairs David Emerson (Alberta 1964). The former President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos Calder√≥n (Kansas 1973), was initiated into Delta Upsilon as an undergraduate student at the University of Kansas and credits the fraternity in helping form his political ideals. Delta Upsilon member Linus Pauling (Oregon State 1922) is a member of a small group of individuals who have been awarded more than one Nobel Prize. Two Delta Upsilon fraternity members, Alfred P. Sloan (Technology 1895) and Charles F. Kettering (Ohio State 1904), joined together in 1945 to found the Sloan-Kettering Institute, which is now part of the world's oldest and largest private cancer research facility, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Another Delta Upsilon member, Thomas Rowe Price, Jr. (Swarthmore 1919) popularized growth stock investing and founded the multibillion-dollar investment firm T. Rowe Price, based in Baltimore, Maryland. Controversies In 2018, the chapter of Delta Upsilon at the University of Washington in Seattle had its charter revoked for beating pledges and forcing them into servitude of senior undergraduate members. The charter revocation followed its earlier suspension from the university's Interfraternity Council. In April 2019, a document was anonymously leaked containing unofficial \\"minutes\\" written by members of the Swarthmore College local Phi Psi fraternity between 2013 and 2016.

She was designed by Sir John Henslow as part of the middling class of 74s, and was the only ship built to her draught. Whereas the common class carried 28 18-pounder guns on their upper gun decks, the middling class carried 30, and only ten 9-pounder guns on their quarterdecks instead of the 12 of the common class. She fought at Trafalgar under the command of Captain Israel Pellew, brother of Sir Edward Pellew. Pellew's captain of marines took the surrender of the overall commander of the French-Spanish fleet, Admiral Villeneuve, aboard the French ship Bucentaure (80 guns). However, he was not able to deliver Villeneuve's sword to the Conqueror as she had passed on to engage another ship and it was received by the captain of Mars. Villeneuve, who spoke English, is alleged to have asked to whom he was surrendering. On being told it was Captain Pellew of the Conqueror, he replied \\"I am glad to have struck to the fortunate Sir Edward Pellew.\\" When he was informed that the Conqueror's captain was Sir Edward's brother, he said, \\"His brother? What, are there two of them? Hƒólas!\\" On 2 February 1812, Conqueror was driven ashore on the coast of England between Sheerness and Chatham, Kent, during a storm. Conqueror was broken up in 1822.

Plot All the fairies in Fairy World celebrate Timmy Turner's Fairy- versary, a magical event that only occurs when a godchild is able to keep his/her fairies a secret for an entire year. After receiving numerous magical gifts, Jorgen Von Strangle gives Timmy a magical muffin that allows anyone who eats it to have a \\"rule-free\\" wish. Timmy then asks how he got Cosmo and Wanda as his godparents. Wanda shows through a flashback that his parents lied to an 8-year old Timmy and tricked him into hiring Vicky as his babysitter. Upset, Timmy inadvertently wishes that his parents could tell the truth. Mr. and Mrs. Turner begin to feel guilty and they start counting the many times they have lied to Timmy. Timmy takes the muffin to school, but is followed by Mr. Crocker who detects the magic within the muffin. Crocker attempts to retrieve the muffin, but only manages to get it out of Timmy's possession. During muffin day at lunch, Timmy sees Crocker frantically searching for the muffin, which leads Timmy to initiate a food fight. The muffin ends up in the paws of Bippy, a monkey that Timmy sets free, and he takes a bite of the muffin. Suddenly, the whole world is transformed, leaving monkeys the rulers of Earth. To make matters worse, Timmy was being chased by leopards after he loses his Godparents when Jorgen announces to all fairies that Da Rules say they have to be Godparents of the \\"dominant species\\" on Earth: monkeys. Bippy ends up getting Cosmo and Wanda as godparents. Timmy, who still remembers Cosmo and Wanda, follows Bippy to try to get him to unwish everything. Timmy returns to Mr. Crocker's class, who is now ranting about Apes using fairies to take over the world. Mr. Crocker is taken by the apes to a place off-limits to Humans. With Crocker gone, Timmy enters the Crocker Cave and steals a magic detector. He uses the magic detector to track down Bippy, whom he finds with the Fairy- versary muffin along with Cosmo and Wanda. Timmy almost succeeds in retrieving the muffin, but is captured by the Apes and brought to the human testing center along with Francis and Mr. Crocker, who suggests the apes to take Timmy instead since he's planning on hosting a party. Timmy is taken to a surgical room where his skull is about to be drilled into when Bippy showed up to rescue him. Bippy manages to fight off the apes at first, but is eventually overwhelmed. Luckily, due to Cosmo's 'paraphrasing' of Bippy's wish (which Cosmo claims could just as easily have been for another banana), everything is unwished moments before Timmy was about to be harmed. Timmy discovers that Bippy lost the muffin during the scuffle, and immediately after the world is returned to normal, Crocker finds the muffin, takes a bite, and wishes he could catch a fairy. He obtains a butterfly net (one of the few items a fairy's magic has no effect on) and captures Wanda. Cosmo is devastated and Bippy flees. Timmy realizes that the first thing Crocker will do with his newfound power is rub it in the face of his students, so he rushes back to his school. With his new-found power, Crocker appears in a power armor suit, which has Wanda trapped in a scepter and the Fairy-versary muffin within the chest cavity. He terrorizes his students by turning them into ice statues (he wanted to turn them into ash), turning Sanjay and Chester's heads into toilets when they asked to go the bathroom, and then chases Timmy off as he transforms the world and makes himself the all-powerful magical leader. Timmy arms himself with the various gifts he got from his Fairy-versary party, and goes to confront Crocker. Crocker abuses Wanda's magic by having the citizens bow down to him and make them eat shrimp puffs. Timmy, disguised as a masked hero, engages Crocker in a magical duel. Crocker has the upper hand, until Cosmo returns with \\"5-second massive pecs\\" and pummels him. However, Cosmo lets his guard down, and he too is captured. Timmy and Crocker fight through time and space before Timmy's cover is blown. Crocker decides to threaten Timmy's parents realizing he cannot destroy him with magic. Returning home, Timmy (now locked in chains due to Crocker) sees his parents under the mercy of Crocker and surrenders. Timmy and his parents reconcile. Left with no other choice, Timmy reveals that Cosmo and Wanda are his fairy godparents, breaking the sacred cardinal law of Da Rules. This results in Cosmo and Wanda breaking free of Crocker's control, and are sent back to Fairy World. With Crocker now powerless, Mr. and Mrs. Turner start pummeling him, knocking the muffin out of his possession. Timmy grabs and eats the rest of the muffin, and wishes for his godparents to return. After poofing away the chains binding Timmy, Timmy then wishes for everything to be back to normal. Back at school, Crocker attempts to convince everyone that fairies exist and that they will all bow down to him, but no one believes him. Crocker is then injected with medicine and sent to a mental institution. Jorgen shows up in Timmy's room and says that, even though everything is fixed, he still broke Da Rules. Before he can take Cosmo and Wanda away, Timmy throws the Forget-Me-Knob (a magical item that was used in the beginning to keep Timmy's parents away from the party) at Jorgen's head, who forgets what he was doing. Cosmo and Wanda then trick him into \\"assigning\\" Timmy as their godchild to which Jorgen agrees. Timmy reminds them that he \\"just got fairy godparents\\", so Cosmo and Wanda reenact their first meeting with Timmy.

The first-to-file system is used in all countries. There is an important difference between the strict nature of the FTF under the European Patent Office (EPO) and the FITF (First inventor to file) system of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The USPTO FITF systemZuhn: \\"USPTO Issues First-Inventor-to- File Examination Guidelines and Final Rule\\" affords early disclosers some \\"grace\\" time before they need to file a patent, whereas the EPO does not recognise any grace period, so early disclosure under the FITF provisions is an absolute bar to later EPO patent.  First to file  In a first-to-file system, the right to the grant of a patent for a given invention lies with the first person to file a patent application for protection of that invention, regardless of the date of actual invention.  First to disclose  The concept of a grace period, under which early disclosure does not prevent the discloser from later filing and obtaining a patent, must be distinguished here from the FTI system.Kravets: \\"First-To-File Patent Law Is Imminent, But What Will It Mean?\\" Germany and the UK formerly had a concept of grace period.Report from the European Commission to The European Parliament and European Council \\"An assessment of the implications for basic genetic engineering research of failure to publish, or late publication of, papers on subjects which could be patentable as required under Article 16(b) of Directive 98/44/EC on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions\\" Both FTI and grace period systems afforded the early discloser protection against later filers. The FTI system allowed non-disclosers to overturn established parties, whereas the grace system only protects early disclosers. The US moved to a grace system on 16 March 2013, which has been termed \\"first- to-disclose\\" by some writers.  First to invent  Canada, the Philippines, and the United States had been among the only countries to use first-to-invent systems, but each switched to first-to-file in 1989, 1998 and 2013 respectively. Invention in the U.S. is generally defined to comprise two steps: (1) conception of the invention and (2) reduction to practice of the invention. When an inventor conceives of an invention and diligently reduces the invention to practice (by filing a patent application, by practicing the invention, etc.), the inventor's date of invention will be the date of conception. Thus, provided an inventor is diligent in actually reducing an application to practice, he or she will be the first inventor and the inventor entitled to a patent, even if another files a patent application, constructively reducing the invention to practice, before the inventor.2138.05 \\"Reduction to Practice\\" [R-5] \\\\- 2100 Patentability However, the first applicant to file has the prima facie right to the grant of a patent. Under the first-to-invent system, when two people claim the same invention, the USPTO would conduct an interference proceeding between them to review evidence of conception, reduction to practice and diligence. Interference can be an expensive and time-consuming process.  Canada's change to first-to-file  Canada changed from FTI to FTF in 1989. One study by researchers at McGill University found that contrary to expectations \\"the switch failed to stimulate Canadian R&D; efforts. Nor did it have any effects on overall patenting. However, the reforms had a small adverse effect on domestic-oriented industries and skewed the ownership structure of patented inventions towards large corporations, away from independent inventors and small businesses.\\" Lo and Sutthiphisal: \\"Does it Matter Who Has the Right to Patent: First-to-Invent or First-to-File? Lessons from Canada\\", April 2009, NBER Working Paper No. w14926  USA change to first-inventor-to-file (FITF)  The America Invents Act, signed by Barack Obama on 16 September 2011,16 Sept 2011 whitehouse.gov press release re signature of AIA switched U.S. right to the patent from the previous \\"first-to-invent\\" system to a \\"first-inventor-to-file\\" system for patent applications filed on or after 16 March 2013.USPTO: \\"America Invents Act: Effective Dates\\" Many legal scholarsGlenn and Nagle: \\"Article I and the First Inventor to File: Patent Reform or Doublespeak?\\", in IDEA‚ÄîThe Intellectual Property Law Review, Volume 50, Number 3 (2010)Simon: \\"The Patent Reform Act's Proposed First-To-File Standard: Needed Reform or Constitutional Blunder?\\", in The John Marshall Review of Intellectual Property Law, 2006Selective compilation of papers on FTF constitutionality published between 2001-2009 (9 papers) have commented that such a change would require a constitutional amendment. Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the US Constitution gives Congress the power to \\"promote the Progress of ... useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to ... Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective ... Discoveries.‚Äù These scholars argue that this clause specifically prohibits a first-inventor-to-file system because the term \\"inventor\\" refers to a person who has created something that has not existed before. The change has not been short of detractors. For example, the IEEE stated in its submission to the House Judiciary Committee, charged with the study of the Patent Reform Act of 2007, that \\"We believe that much of the legislation is a disincentive to inventiveness, and stifles new businesses and job growth by threatening the financial rewards available to innovators in U.S. industry. Passage of the current patent reform bill language would only serve to relax the very laws designed to protect American innovators and prevent infringement of their ideas.\\" Proponents argue that the FITF aligns the U.S. with the rest of the world, according to the original U.S. patent system, and brings more certainty, simplicity and economy to the patent process, all of which allow greater patent participation by startups.

They are typically formed by highly viscous, possibly silica-rich lava, erupting from localized vents followed by relatively slow cooling. Lunar domes are wide, rounded, circular features with a gentle slope rising in elevation a few hundred meters to the midpoint. They are typically 8‚Äì12 km in diameter, but can be up to 20 km across. Some of the domes contain a small craterlet at the peak. Some of the domes have been shown to consist of the same materials as the lunar maria. Thus they could be created by some mechanism that differs from the mare-forming flows. It is thought that these domes are formed from a smaller magma chamber that is closer to the surface than is the case for a mare. This results in a lower pressure, and so the lava flows more slowly. The magma wells up through a crack in the surface, but the flow eventually concentrates through one primary vent. This concentration can then result in a vent crater at the peak of the dome. The cluster of lunar domes at the Marius Hills was considered as a possible landing site of Apollo 15. There are concentrations of lunar domes near the craters Hortensius, and T. Mayer, across the top of Mons R√ºmker, and in Mare Fecunditatis. Solitary lunar domes are also found, including Kies Pi (œÄ), Milichius Pi (œÄ), Mons Gruithuisen Gamma (Œ≥) and Delta (Œ¥), and domes near the craters Gambart C, Beer, and Capuanus. Omega Cauchy (œâ) and Tau Cauchy (œÑ) form a pair of domes near the crater Cauchy. Likewise near Arago are the domes Arago Alpha (Œ±) and Arago Beta (Œ≤). There are two domes south of Mons Esam. The IAU does not currently have rules that establish the naming of lunar domes, but the practice in the professional literature and in lunar sciences is to name the dome with the name of the nearest crater followed by a number that denotes the order of discovery.

Alcubierre is known for the proposed Alcubierre drive, a speculative warp drive by which a spacecraft could achieve faster-than-light travel. Personal life Alcubierre was born in Mexico City. His father, Miguel Alcubierre Ortiz, a Spanish refugee, arrived in Mexico shortly after the Spanish civil war with his own father, Miguel Alcubierre P√©rez.https://www.heraldo.es/noticias/ocio-cultura/2009/04/28/las-siete-vidas- miguel-alcubierre-46212-1361024.html Alcubierre has three younger siblings, among them is historian Beatriz Alcubierre Moya.https://www.aacademica.org/beatriz.alcubierre From elementary throughout high school, Alcubierre attended Colegio Ciudad de M√©xico. At the age of 13, his father bought for him a small telescope, and, together with Sci-Fi shows, as Star Trek, motivated him to pursue a scientific career.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k78_F-cYIhQ&t;=24 At the age of 15, after having read Patrick Moore and David Hardy's Challenge of the Stars, Alcubierre decided that he wanted to become an astronomer. He knew that in order to achieve this he would have to study physics first.http://www.fundacionunam.org.mx/rostros/miguel-alcubierre-el-fisico- fanatico-de-la-ciencia-ficcion/ Academic life Alcubierre obtained a Licentiate degree in physics in 1988 and a MSc degree in theoretical physics in 1990, both at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). At the end of 1990, Alcubierre moved to Wales to attend graduate school at Cardiff University, receiving his PhD degree in 1994 through study of numerical general relativity.Biography Miguel Alcubierre Moya - website of the Instituto de Ciencias Nucleares After 1996 he worked at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam, Germany, developing new numerical techniques used in the description of black holes. Since 2002, he has worked at the Nuclear Sciences Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), where he conducts research in numerical relativity, employing computers to formulate and solve the physical equations first proposed by Albert Einstein. The solitary wave solutions proposed by Alcubierre for the Einsteinian field equations may possibly prove general relativity consistent with the experimentally verified non-locality of quantum mechanics. This work militates against the idea that quantum non-locality would ultimately require abandoning the mathematical structure of general relativity. On June 11, 2012, Alcubierre was appointed Director of the Nuclear Sciences Institute at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). On June 14, 2016, after a four-year term as Director of the Nuclear Sciences Institute at UNAM, Miguel Alcubierre was re-elected by the Governing Board of UNAM as Director of the Nuclear Sciences Institute for another four-year period. May 1994 paper Alcubierre is best known for the proposal of \\"The Warp Drive: Hyper-fast travel within general relativity\\" that was published in the science journal Classical and Quantum Gravity. In this, he describes the Alcubierre drive, a theoretical means of traveling faster than light that does not violate the physical principle that nothing can locally travel faster than light. In this paper, he constructed a model that might transport a volume of flat space inside a \\"bubble\\" of curved space. This bubble, named as Hyper-relativistic local-dynamic space, is driven forward by a local expansion of space-time behind it, and an opposite contraction in front of it, so that theoretically a spaceship would be placed in motion by forces generated in the change made by space-time. Media appearances Miguel Alcubierre made a special appearance on the TV productions How William Shatner Changed the World and Michio Kaku's Sci Fi Science: Physics of the Impossible, in which his warp bubble theory was discussed. Alcubierre has been invited twice to interviews on radio station Radio Educaci√≥n XEEP (1060 AM), first on February 18, 2011, and later on March 4th 2011, on the technology-related talk show Interfase, where he explained his views on the current state of scientific and technology research in Mexico, and gave a brief introduction to his warp drive model and how it came to be.

In 1996 he was accused of espionage for revealing the perils of decaying nuclear submarines, and in 2000 he became the first Russian to be completely acquitted of a charge of treason in the Soviet or post-Soviet era. Whistleblower and espionage accusations Nikitin started to co-operate with Norwegian environmental Bellona Foundation in 1994. He was arrested in February 1996 by Russian FSB and charged with treason through espionage for his contributions to a Bellona report on the nuclear safety within the Russian Northern Fleet. On 30 August, Amnesty International declared him a prisoner of conscience and began an international campaign for his release. After having spent ten months in pre-trial detention in Saint Petersburg he was released on the order of Mikhail Katushev, the then deputy Russian Prosecutor General, in December 1996. The charges were however, not dropped. Nikitin first stood trial in October 1998, when the Saint Petersburg City Court rejected the evidence against him. But rather than acquitting him, the Court sent the case back to the FSB for additional investigation. The Supreme Court of Russia confirmed this decision in February 1999, and the FSB filed new charges in July 1999. The second trial started at the Saint Petersburg City Court in November 1999, and ended on 29 December with a full acquittal. The prosecution appealed to the Supreme Court, but the acquittal was confirmed and reached legal force on 17 April 2000. Nikitin was defended by a group of attorneys in law, including Yury Schmidt, Ivan Pavlov, Victor Drozdov, Henri Reznik and others. The prosecution was, however, not willing to call it a day. On 30 May 2000 the Prosecutor General requested the governing body of the Russian Supreme Court, the Presidium, to re-open the case. The basis for the request was that ‚ÄúNikitin's rights had been violated throughout the proceedings against him, and that these violations had to be repaired‚Äù (sic). The Presidium rejected the request on 13 September 2000. Nikitin is still engaged in environmental and human rights issues in Russia. He is the head of Bellona Foundation‚Äôs Saint Petersburg branch, and is engaged in environmental and nuclear safety projects, as well as in human rights cases. In 1997, Nikitin was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize from the Goldman Environmental Foundation, but as a result of treason charges against him, he was prevented from attending the Prize ceremony.

At its widest, it can refer collectively to the three traditional branches of government ‚Äì the Executive branch, Legislative branch and Judicial branch. The term is also used colloquially to mean the Executive and Legislature together, as these are the branches of government responsible for day-to-day governance of the nation and lawmaking. At its narrowest, the term is used to refer to the Executive Branch in form of the Cabinet of Indonesia as this is the branches of government responsible for day-to-day governance. History=Liberal democracy era An era of Liberal Democracy () in Indonesia began on August 17, 1950 following the dissolution of the federal United States of Indonesia less than a year after its formation, and ended with the imposition of martial law and President Sukarno's decree regarding the introduction of Guided Democracy on July 5, 1959. It saw a number of important events, including the 1955 Bandung Conference, Indonesia's first general and Constitutional Assembly elections, and an extended period of political instability, with no cabinet lasting as long as two years. Guided Democracy era Guided Democracy () was the political system in place in Indonesia from 1959 until the New Order began in 1966. It was the brainchild of President Sukarno, and was an attempt to bring about political stability. Sukarno believed that Western-style democracy was inappropriate for Indonesia's situation. Instead, he sought a system based on the traditional village system of discussion and consensus, which occurred under the guidance of village elders. Transition to the New Order Indonesia's transition to the \\"New Order\\" in the mid-1960s, ousted the country's first president, Sukarno, after 22 years in the position. One of the most tumultuous periods in the country's modern history, it was the commencement of Suharto's 31-year presidency. Described as the great dhalang (\\"puppet master\\"), Sukarno drew power from balancing the opposing and increasingly antagonistic forces of the army and Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). By 1965, the PKI extensively penetrated all levels of government and gained influence at the expense of the army.Ricklefs (1991), pp. 271-283 On 30 September 1965, six of the military's most senior officers were killed in an action (generally labelled an \\"attempted coup\\") by the so-called 30 September Movement, a group from within the armed forces. Within a few hours, Major General Suharto mobilised forces under his command and took control of Jakarta. Anti-communists, initially following the army's lead, went on a violent purge of communists throughout the country, killing an estimated half million people and destroying the PKI, which was officially blamed for the crisis.; Ricklefs (1991), pages 280‚Äì283, 284, 287‚Äì290; Friend (2003), page 107-109, 113. The politically weakened Sukarno was forced to transfer key political and military powers to General Suharto, who had become head of the armed forces. In March 1967, the Indonesian parliament (MPRS) named General Suharto acting president. He was formally appointed president one year later. Sukarno lived under virtual house arrest until his death in 1970. In contrast to the stormy nationalism, revolutionary rhetoric, and economic failure that characterised the early 1960s under the left-leaning Sukarno, Suharto's pro- Western \\"New Order\\" stabilised the economy but continued the policies of Pancasila. New order era The New Order () is the term coined by the second Indonesian President Suharto to characterise his regime as he came to power in 1966. Suharto used this term to contrast his rule with that of his predecessor, Sukarno (dubbed the \\"Old Order,\\" or Orde Lama). The term \\"New Order\\" in more recent times has become synonymous with the Suharto years (1966‚Äì1998). Immediately following the attempted coup in 1965, the political situation was uncertain, but the Suharto's New Order found much popular support from groups wanting a separation from Indonesia's problems since its independence. The 'generation of 66' (Angkatan 66) epitomised talk of a new group of young leaders and new intellectual thought. Following Indonesia's communal and political conflicts, and its economic collapse and social breakdown of the late 1950s through to the mid-1960s, the \\"New Order\\" was committed to achieving and maintaining political order, economic development, and the removal of mass participation in the political process. The features of the \\"New Order\\" established from the late 1960s were thus a strong political role for the military, the bureaucratisation and corporatisation of political and societal organisations, and selective but effective repression of opponents. Strident anti-communism remained a hallmark of the regime for its subsequent 32 years. Within a few years, however, many of its original allies had become indifferent or averse to the New Order, which comprised a military faction supported by a narrow civilian group. Among much of the pro- democracy movement which forced Suharto to resign in the 1998 Indonesian Revolution and then gained power, the term \\"New Order\\" has come to be used pejoratively. It is frequently employed to describe figures who were either tied to the Suharto period, or who upheld the practises of his authoritarian regime, such as corruption, collusion and nepotism (widely known by the acronym KKN: korupsi, kolusi, nepotisme).Stop talk of KKN . The Jakarta Post (24 August 2001). Reform era Map showing the parties/organisations with the largest vote share per province in Indonesia's elections from 1971 to 2014 The Post-Suharto era in Indonesia began with the fall of Suharto in 1998 during which Indonesia has been in a period of transition, an era known in Indonesia as Reformasi (English: ReformUS Indonesia Diplomatic and Political Cooperation Handbook, Int'l Business Publications, 2007, , page CRS-5Robin Bush, Nahdlatul Ulama and the Struggle for Power Within Islam and Politics in Indonesia, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 2009, , page 111Ryan Ver Berkmoes, Lonely Planet Indonesia, 2010, , page 49). A more open and liberal political-social environment ensued following the resignation of authoritarian President Suharto, ending the three decades of the New Order period. A constitutional reform process lasted from 1999 to 2002, with four constitutional amendments producing important changes.Denny Indrayana (2008), pp. 360-361 The Indonesian political system before and after the constitutional amendments Among these are term limits of up to 2 five-year terms for the President and Vice-President, and measures to institute checks and balances. The highest state institution is the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), whose functions previously included electing the president and vice-president (since 2004 the president has been elected directly by the people), establishing broad guidelines of state policy, and amending the constitution. The 695-member MPR includes all 550 members of the People's Representative Council (DPR) (the House of Representatives) plus 130 \\"regional representatives\\" elected by the twenty-six provincial parliaments and sixty- five appointed members from societal groupsDenny Indrayana (2008), pp. 361-362 The DPR, which is the premier legislative institution, originally included 462 members elected through a mixed proportional/district representational system and thirty-eight appointed members of the armed forces (TNI) and police (POLRI). TNI/POLRI representation in the DPR and MPR ended in 2004. Societal group representation in the MPR was eliminated in 2004 through further constitutional change.Denny Indrayana (2008), pp. 293-296 Having served as rubberstamp bodies in the past, the DPR and MPR have gained considerable power and are increasingly assertive in oversight of the executive branch. Under constitutional changes in 2004, the MPR became a bicameral legislature, with the creation of the Dewan Perwakilan Daerah (DPD), in which each province is represented by four members, although its legislative powers are more limited than those of the DPR. Through his appointed cabinet, the president retains the authority to conduct the administration of the government.Denny Indrayana (2008), pp. 265, 361, 441 A general election in June 1999 produced the first freely elected national, provincial and regional parliaments in over forty years. In October 1999 the MPR elected a compromise candidate, Abdurrahman Wahid, as the country's fourth president, and Megawati Sukarnoputri -- a daughter of Sukarno, the country's first president -- as the vice-president. Megawati's PDI-P party had won the largest share of the vote (34%) in the general election, while Golkar, the dominant party during the Soeharto era, came in second (22%). Several other, mostly Islamic parties won shares large enough to be seated in the DPR. Further democratic elections took place in 2004 and 2009. Branches=Executive branch President Joko Widodo Indonesian Democratic Party ‚Äì Struggle 20 October 2014 } The president and vice-president are selected by vote of the citizens for five-year terms. Prior to 2004, they were chosen by the People's Consultative Assembly. The last election was held on 17 April 2019. The President of Indonesia is directly elected for a maximum of two five-year terms and is the head of state, commander-in-chief of the armed forces and responsible for domestic governance and policy-making and foreign affairs. The president appoints a cabinet, members of which do not have to be elected members of the legislature.Denny Indrayana (2008), pp. 361, 443, 440 Legislative branch The legislative building complex People's Representative Council The MPR is the legislative branch of Indonesia's political system. The MPR is composed of two houses: the DPR, which is commonly called the People's Representative Council, and the DPD, which is called the Regional Representative Council. The DPR parliamentarians are elected through multi-member electoral districts, whereas 4 DPD parliamentarians are elected in each of Indonesia's 34 provinces. The DPR holds most of the legislative power because it has the sole power to pass laws. The DPD acts as a supplementary body to the DPR; it can propose bills, offer its opinion and participate in discussions, but it has no legal power. The MPR itself has power outside of those given to the individual houses. It can amend the constitution, inaugurate the president and conduct impeachment procedures. When the MPR acts in this function, it does so by simply combining the members of the two houses.Denny Indrayana (2008) Judicial branch The Indonesian Supreme Court () is the highest level of the judicial branch. Its judges are appointed by the president. The Constitutional Court rules on constitutional and political matters (), while a Judicial Commission () oversees the judges.Denny Indrayana (2008), p266 - 267 State Auditor The Audit Board of Indonesia () is the high state body that responsible to check the management and accountability of state finances conducted by the Central Government, Local Government, other State Institutions, Bank Indonesia, State- and municipally-owned enterprises, Public Service Boards, and institutions or other entities that manage state finances.

Since the 19th century, the term The Makars has been specifically used to refer to a number of poets of fifteenth and sixteenth century Scotland, in particular Robert Henryson, William Dunbar and Gavin Douglas, who wrote a diverse genre of works in Middle Scots in the period of the Northern Renaissance. The Makars have often been referred to by literary critics as Scots Chaucerians. In modern usage, poets of the Scots revival in the 18th century, such as Allan Ramsay and Robert Fergusson are also makars. Since 2002, the term \\"makar\\" has been revived as the name for a publicly funded poet, first in Edinburgh, followed by Glasgow, Stirling and Dundee, and in 2004 the position of The Scots Makar, in the sense of a Scottish poet laureate, was introduced by the Scottish Parliament. Etymology Middle Scots (plural ) is the equivalent of English maker. The word functions as a calque (literal translation) of Ancient Greek term () \\"maker; poet\\". The term is normally applied to poets writing in Scots although it need not be exclusive to Scottish writers. William Dunbar for instance referred to the English poets Chaucer, Lydgate and Gower as .For example in The Lament (ll.50‚Äì1): :The noble Chaucer of makaris flour, :The Monk of Bery, and Gower, al thre. The Makars in history The work of the Makar of the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries was in part marked out by an adoption in vernacular languages of the new and greater variety in metrics and prosody current across Europe after the influence of such figures as Dante and Petrarch and similar to the route which Chaucer followed in England. Their work is usually distinguished from the work of earlier Scottish writers such as Barbour and Wyntoun who wrote romance and chronicle verse in octosyllabic couplets and it also perhaps marked something of a departure from the medieval alliterative or troubador traditions; but one characteristic of poetry by the Makars is that features from all of these various traditions, such as strong alliteration and swift narration, continued to be a distinctive influence. Rosslyn Chapel; built in the century of the makars, the famed intricacy of its carving shares much in spirit with the aureation in their language. The first of the Makars proper in this sense, although perhaps the least Scots due to his education predominantly in captivity at the English court in London, is generally taken to be James I (1394‚Äì1437) the likely author of the Kingis Quair. Apart from other principal figures already named, writing by makars such as Richard Holland, Blind Hary and Walter Kennedy also survives along with evidence that suggests the existence of a substantial body of lost work. The quality of extant work generally, both minor and major, demonstrates a thriving poetic tradition in Scotland throughout the period. Henryson, who is generally seen today as one of the foremost makars, is not known to have been a court poet, but the Royal Palace of Dunfermline, the city in which he was based, was one of the residences of the Stewart court. A high point in cultural patronage was the Renaissance Court of James IV (1488‚Äì1513) now principally associated in literary terms with William Dunbar. The pinnacle in writing from this time was in fact Douglas's Eneados (1513), the first full and faithful translation of an important work of classical antiquity into any Anglic language. Douglas is one of the first authors to explicitly identify his language as Scottis. This was also the period when use of Scots in poetry was at its most richly and successfully aureate. Dunbar's Lament for the Makaris (c.1505) contains a leet of makars, not exclusively Scottish, some of whom are now only known through his mention, further indicative of the wider extent to the tradition. Qualities in verse especially prized by many of these writers included the combination of skilful artifice with natural diction, concision and quickness () of expression. For example, Dunbar praises his peer, Merseir in The Lament (ll.74-5) as one :... :\\"who wrote such vivid love poetry, quick and concise, using exalted diction...\\" Some of the Makars, such as Dunbar, also featured an increasing incorporation of Latinate terms into Scots prosody, or aureation, heightening the creative tensions between the ornate and the natural in poetic diction. The new plane of achievement set by Douglas in epic and translation was not followed up in the subsequent century, but later makars, such as David Lyndsay, still drew strongly on the work of fifteenth and early sixteenth century exponents. This influence can be traced right through to Alexander Scott and the various members of the Castalian Band in the Scottish court of James VI (1567‚Äì1603) which included Alexander Montgomerie and, once again, the king himself. The king composed a treatise, the Reulis and Cautelis (1584), which proposed a formalisation of Scottish prosody and consciously strove to identify what was distinctive in the Scots tradition. Written in the Language of the Scottis Nation, p.64 (online source) The removal of the Court to London under James after 1603 is usually regarded as marking the eclipse of the distinctively Scottish tradition of poetry initiated by the Makars, but figures such as William Drummond might loosely be seen as forming a continuation into the seventeenth century. The Makars have often been referred to by literary critics as Scots Chaucerians. While Chaucer's influence on fifteenth-century Scottish literature was certainly important, the makars drew strongly on a native tradition predating Chaucer, exemplified by Barbour, as well as the courtly literature of France.Kinsley, James. William Dunbar: Poems Oxford clarendon Press, 1958. (Introduction, p.xiii) In the more general application of the term which is current today the word can be applied to poets of the Scots revival in the eighteenth century, such as Allan Ramsay and Robert Fergusson. In recent times, other examples of poets that have seemed to particularly exemplify the traditions of the makars have included Robert Garioch, Sydney Goodsir Smith, George Campbell Hay and Norman MacCaig among many others. Modern usage=\\"The Scots Makar\\" A position of national laureate, entitled The Scots Makar, was established in 2004 by the Scottish Parliament. The first appointment was made directly by the Parliament in that year when Edwin Morgan received the honour to become Scotland's first ever official national poet. He was succeeded in 2011 by Liz Lochhead. Jackie Kay was announced as the third holder of this post in 2016. Before Kay was appointed, it was suggested that the role might now only be referred to as the National Poet for Scotland, because of concerns that the word makar had to be explained outside of Scotland. Kay states that she argued for retaining the Makar name, which is still used. The city Makars In 2002 the City of Edinburgh, Scotland's capital, instituted a post of makar, known as the Edinburgh Makar. Each term lasts for three years and the first three incumbents were Stewart Conn (2002), Valerie Gillies (2005), and Ron Butlin (2008, 2011). The current incumbent (as of 2020) is Alan Spence. The previous Edinburgh makar was Shetlandic dialect advocate Christine De Luca. Other cities to create Makar posts include Glasgow (Liz Lochhead), Stirling (Magi Gibson), Aberdeen (Sheena Blackhall) and Dundee (W.N. Herbert). Community Makars In 2011, the community of Craigmillar in Edinburgh instituted the first Community Makar, as a three-year post. It is currently held by Diane Heron, until 2014. She is assisted in her duties by the Coort Jester, Heather Turner for the same term. American poet John Berryman seems to use the word in this sense in The Dream Songs #43 and #94.

It was soon supplemented by an implementation of CP/M's multitasking 'big brother', MP/M-86 2.0 since September 1981. This turned a PC into a multiuser machine capable of supporting multiple concurrent users using dumb terminals attached by serial ports. The environment presented to each user made it seem as if they had the entire computer to themselves. Since terminals cost a fraction of the then-substantial price of a complete PC, this offered considerable cost savings, as well as facilitating multi-user applications such as accounts or stock control in a time when PC networks were rare, very expensive and difficult to implement. CP/M-86 1.1 (with BDOS 2.2) and MP/M-86 2.1 were merged to create Concurrent CP/M-86 3.0 (also known as CCP/M-86) with BDOS 3.0 in late 1982. One of its designers was Francis \\"Frank\\" R. Holsworth. Initially, this was a single-user operating system supporting true multi- tasking of up to four (in its default configuration) CP/M-86 compatible programs. Like its predecessors it could be configured for multi-processor support (see f.e. Concurrent CP/M-86/80) and also added \\"virtual screens\\" letting an operator switch between the interactions of multiple programs. Later versions supported dumb terminals and so could be deployed as multiuser systems. Concurrent CP/M-86 3.1 (BDOS 3.1) shipped on 21 February 1984. AdaptationsConcurrent CP/M-86 with Windows= In February 1984 Digital Research also offered a version of Concurrent CP/M-86 with windowing capabilities named Concurrent CP/M with Windows for the IBM Personal Computer and Personal Computer XT. =Concurrent CP/M-86/80= This was an adaptation of Concurrent CP/M-86 for the LSI-M4, LSI Octopus and CAL PC computers. These machines had both 16-bit and 8-bit processors, because in the early days of 16-bit personal computing, 8-bit software was more available and often ran faster than the corresponding 16-bit software. Concurrent CP/M-86/80 allowed users to run both CP/M (8-bit) and CP/M-86 (16-bit) applications. When a command was entered, the operating system ran the corresponding application on either the 8-bit or the 16-bit processor, depending on whether the executable file had a .COM or .CMD extension. It emulated a CP/M environment for 8-bit programs by translating CP/M system calls into CP/M-86 system calls, which were then executed by the 16-bit processor. Concurrent DOS In August 1983, Bruce Skidmore, Raymond D. Pedrizetti, Dave Brown and Gordon Edmonds teamed up to create PC-MODE, an optional module for Concurrent CP/M-86 3.1 (with BDOS 3.1) to provide basic compatibility with PC DOS 1.1 (and MS-DOS 1.1). This was shown publicly at COMDEX in December 1983 and shipped in March 1984 as Concurrent DOS 3.1 (a.k.a. CDOS with BDOS 3.1) to hardware vendors. Simple DOS applications, which did not directly access the screen or other hardware, could be run. For example, although a console program such as PKZIP worked perfectly and offered more facilities than the CP/M-native ARC archiver, applications which performed screen manipulations, such as the WordStar word processor for DOS, would not, and native Concurrent CP/M (or CP/M-86) versions were required. While Concurrent DOS 3.1 up to 4.1 had been developed in the US, OEM adaptations and localizations were carried out by DR Europe's OEM Support Group in Newbury, UK, since 1983. Digital Research positioned Concurrent DOS 4.1 with GEM as alternative for IBM's TopView in 1985. Concurrent PC DOS Concurrent DOS 3.2 (with BDOS 3.2) in 1984 was compatible with applications for CP/M-86 1.x, Concurrent CP/M-86 3.x and PC DOS 2.0. It was available for many different hardware platforms. The version with an IBM PC compatible BIOS/XIOS was named Concurrent PC DOS 3.2. Concurrent DOS 68K and FlexOS 68K Efforts being part of a cooperation with Motorola since 1984 led to the development of Concurrent DOS 68K in Austin, Texas, as a successor to CP/M-68K written in C. One of its main architects was Francis \\"Frank\\" R. Holsworth (using siglum FRH). Concurrent DOS 68K 1.0 became available for OEM evaluation in early 1985. The effort received considerable funding worth several million dollars from Motorola and was designed for their 68000/68010 processors. Like the earlier GEMDOS system for 68000 processors it initially ran on the Motorola VME/10 development system. Concurrent DOS 68K 1.20/1.21 was available in April 1986, offered for about to OEMs. This system evolved into FlexOS 68K in late 1986. Known versions include: * Concurrent DOS 68K 1.0 (1985) * Concurrent DOS 68K 1.1 * Concurrent DOS 68K 1.20 (April 1986, 1986-05-27) * Concurrent DOS 68K 1.21 (1986) Concurrent DOS 286 and FlexOS 286 In parallel to the Concurrent DOS 68K effort, Digital Research also previewed Concurrent DOS 286 in cooperation with Intel in January 1985. This was based on MP/M-286 and Concurrent CP/M-286, on which Digital Research had worked on since 1982. Concurrent DOS 286 was a complete rewrite in the C language based on a new system architecture with dynamically loadable device drivers instead of a static BIOS or XIOS. One of its main architects was Francis \\"Frank\\" R. Holsworth. The operating system would function strictly in 80286 native mode, allowing protected mode multi- user, multitasking operation while running 8086 emulation. While this worked on the B-1 step of prototype chip samples, Digital Research, with evaluation copies of their operating system already shipping in April, discovered problems with the emulation on the production level C-1 step of the processor in May, which would not allow Concurrent DOS 286 to run 8086 software in protected mode. The release of Concurrent DOS 286 had been scheduled for late May, but was delayed until Intel could develop a new version of the chip. In August, after extensive testing E-1 step samples of the 80286, Digital Research said that Intel had corrected all documented 286 errata, but that there were still undocumented chip performance problems with the prerelease version of Concurrent DOS 286 running on the E-1 step. Intel said that the approach Digital Research wished to take in emulating 8086 software in protected mode differed from the original specifications; nevertheless they incorporated into the E-2 step minor changes in the microcode that allowed Digital Research to run emulation mode much faster (see LOADALL). These same limitations affected FlexOS 286 version 1.x, a reengineered derivation of Concurrent DOS 286, which was developed by Digital Research's new Flexible Automation Business Unit in Monterey, CA, since 1986. Later versions added compatibility with PC DOS 2.x and 3.x. Known versions include: * Concurrent DOS 286 1.0 (1985) * Concurrent DOS 286 1.1 (1986-01-07) * Concurrent DOS 286 1.2 (1986) * FlexOS 286 1.3 (November 1986) * FlexOS 286 1.31 (May 1987) Concurrent DOS XM and Concurrent DOS 386 Digital Research Concurrent DOS XM Release 6.0 Digital Research Concurrent DOS 386 Release 2.0 The OEM Support Group was relocated into Digital Research's newly created European Development Centre (EDC) in Hungerford, UK in 1986, which started to take over further development of the Concurrent DOS family since Concurrent DOS 4.11, including siblings like DOS Plus and successors. Developed in Hungerford, UK, versions 5 and 6 (Concurrent DOS XM, with XM standing for Expanded Memory) could bank switch up to 8 MB of EEMS to provide a real-mode environment to run multiple CP/M-86 and DOS programs concurrently and support up to three users (one local and up to two hooked up via serial terminals). In 1987, Concurrent DOS 86 was rewritten to become Concurrent DOS 386, still a continuation of the classical XIOS & BDOS architecture. This ran on machines equipped with the Intel 80386 and later processors, using the 386's hardware facilities for virtualizing the hardware, allowing most DOS applications to run unmodified under Concurrent DOS 386, even on terminals. The OS supported concurrent multiuser file access, allowing multiuser applications to run as if they were on individual PCs attached to a network server. Concurrent DOS 386 allowed a single server to support a number of users on dumb terminals or inexpensive low-specification PCs running terminal emulation software, without the need for expensive workstations and then-expensive network cards. It was a true multiuser system; several users could use a single database with record locking to prevent mutual interference. Concurrent DOS 6.0 represented also the starting point for the DR DOS family, which was carved out of it.

MDOS), starting with version 5.0 (with BDOS 6.5) in 1991. Multiuser DOS suffered from several technical limitations that restricted its ability to compete with LANs based on PC DOS. It required its own special device drivers for much common hardware, as PC DOS drivers were not multiuser or multi-tasking aware. Driver installation was more complex than the simple PC DOS method of copying the files onto the boot disk and modifying CONFIG.SYS appropriately it was necessary to relink the Multiuser DOS kernel (known as a nucleus) using the SYSGEN command. Multiuser DOS was also unable to use many common PC DOS additions such as network stacks, and it was limited in its ability to support later developments in the PC-compatible world, such as graphics adaptors, sound cards, CD-ROM drives and mice. Although many of these were soon rectified for example, graphical terminals were developed, allowing users to use CGA, EGA and VGA software it was less flexible in this regard than a network of individual PCs, and as the prices of these fell, it became less and less competitive, although it still offered benefits in terms of management and lower total cost of ownership. As a multi-user operating system its price was higher than a single-user system, of course, and it required special device drivers, unlike single-user multitasking DOS add-ons such as Quarterdeck's DESQview. Unlike MP/M, it never became popular for single-user but multitasking use. When Novell acquired Digital Research in 1991 and abandoned Multiuser DOS in 1992, the three Master VARs DataPac Australasia, Concurrent Controls and Intelligent Micro Software were allowed to license the source code of the system to take over and continue independent development of their derivations in 1994. Known versions include: * DR Multiuser DOS 5.00 (1991), 5.01 * Novell DR Multiuser DOS 5.10 (1992-04-13), 5.11 * Novell DR Multiuser DOS 5.13 (BDOS 6.6, 1992) All versions of Digital Research and Novell DR Multiuser DOS reported themselves as \\"IBM PC DOS\\" version 3.31.

REAL/32 IMS REAL/32 Version 7.6 Intelligent Micro Software Ltd. (IMS) of Thatcham, UK, acquired a license to further develop Multiuser DOS from Novell in 1994 and renamed their product REAL/32 in 1995. Similar to FlexOS/4690 OS before, IBM in 1995 licensed REAL/32 7.50 to bundle it with their 4695 POS terminals.

LBA and FAT32 support was added with REAL/32 7.90 in 1999. On 19 April 2002, Intelligent Micro Software Ltd. filed for insolvency and was taken over by one of its major customers, Barry Quittenton's Itera Ltd. This company was dissolved on 2006-03-28. As of 2010 REAL/32 was supplied by Integrated Solutions of Thatcham, UK, but the company, at the same address, was later listed as builders. REAL/NG REAL/NG was IMS' attempt to create the \\"Next Generation\\" of REAL/32, also named \\"REAL/32 for the internet age\\". REAL/NG promised \\"increased range of hardware from PCs to x86 multi-processor server systems\\". Advertised feature list, as of 2003: * Runs with Red Hat 7.3 or later version of Linux * Backward compatible with DOS and REAL/32 * Max 65535 virtual consoles, each of these can be a user. * No Linux expertise required * Administration/setup/upgrade by web browser (local and remote) * Supplied with TCP/IP Linux-/Windows-based terminal emulator for the number of users purchased * Print and file sharing built in * Drive mapping between Linux and REAL/NG servers built in * User hardware support * Increased performance * Vastly increased TPA * Multi-processor support * Improved hardware support * Built-in firewall support * Very low cost per seat * Low total cost of ownership * Supplied on CD * Supplied with a set of Red Hat CDs By 10 December 2003, IMS made \\"REALNG V1.60-V1.19-V1.12\\" available, which, based on the Internet Archive, seems to be the latest release. By 2005, the realng.com website was mirroring the IMS main website, and had no mention of REAL/NG, only REAL/32. Application software While the various releases of this operating system had increasing ability to run DOS programs, software written for the platform could take advantage of its features by using function calls specifically suitable for multiuser operation. It used pre- emptive multitasking, preventing badly-written applications from delaying other processes by retaining control of the processor. To this day, Multiuser DOS is supported by popular SSL/TLS libraries such as wolfSSL. The API provided support for blocking and non-blocking message queues, mutual- exclusion queues, the ability to create sub-process threads which executed independently from the parent, and a method of pausing execution which did not waste processor cycles, unlike idle loops used by single-user operating systems. Applications were started as \\"attached\\" to a console. However, if an application did not need user interaction it could \\"detach\\" from the console and run as a background process, later reattaching to a console if needed. Another key feature was that the memory management supported a \\"shared\\" memory model for processes (in addition to the usual models available to normal DOS programs). In the shared memory model the \\"code\\" and \\"data\\" sections of a program were isolated from each other. Because the \\"code\\" contained no modifiable data, code sections in memory could be shared by several processes running the same program, thereby reducing memory requirements. Programs written, or adapted, for any multitasking platform need to avoid the technique used by single-tasking systems of going into endless loops until interrupted when, for example, waiting for a user to press a key; this wasted processor time that could be used by other processes. Instead, Concurrent DOS provided an API call which a process could call to \\"sleep\\" for a period of time. Later versions of the Concurrent DOS kernel included Idle Detection, which monitored DOS API calls to determine whether the application was doing useful work or in fact idle, in which case the process was suspended allowing other processes to run. Idle Detection was the catalyst for the patented DR-DOS Dynamic Idle Detection power management feature invented in 1989 by Roger Alan Gross and John P. Constant and marketed as BatteryMAX.

A Hell 54, a licensed German copy of the C-52 The (Hagelin) C-52 and CX-52 were cipher machines manufactured by Crypto AG starting 1951/1952. These pin-and-lug type cipher machines were advanced successors of the C-38/M-209. The machine measures . The device is mechanical, but when combined with an electric keyboard attachment, the B-52, the resultant system is termed the BC-52. The B-52 is larger, measuring . The Hell 54 was a licensed copy of the C-52 by German company Hell.  Structure and operation  Both C and CX models are equipped with six pinwheels. In the C-52 version, these six wheels are chosen from a possible set of 12, with the number of pins on each wheel being 25, 26, 29, 31, 34, 37, 38, 41, 42, 43, 46, and 47. The C model had a fixed stepping system with a large wheel cycle due to the mutually prime factors in the pin counts. The CX-52 version has 6 pinwheels with 47 pins each and a flexible wheel movement system. The lug cage of both models contains 32 movable bars: 27 of the bars are used for encryption and the remaining 5 bars control the stepping of the pinwheels. The early CX models used the control bars also for encryption but due to complications in creating acceptable lug settings later CX models used these bars only for controlling of the wheel stepping. The stepping of the CX wheels was controlled by adjustable lugs on the control bars. The C-52 and CX-52 were very flexible machines that could be produced in various ways, creating a unique machine with unique cryptographic characteristics for each customer. There were special detachable wheel movement bars and their position on the drum could change, interchangeable print wheels, custom pinwheel labels, versions with One-time Tape reader instead of wheels, versions that only enciphered numbers, and many other details that influenced the enciphering process.  Breaking and compromising  There is some speculation that the CX-52 might have been broken by communist signals intelligence services of East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Poland.

H. F. Lee, was the second son of General Robert E. Lee and Mary Anna Custis. He was a planter, a Confederate cavalry General in the American Civil War, and later a Congressman from Virginia. Early life Lee was born at Arlington House in Arlington, Virginia, and named for William Henry Fitzhugh, his mother's uncle. At an early age, his father began to call him Rooney; what prompted him to use this nickname is not known, but it stuck as a way to differentiate him from his cousin Fitzhugh Lee. Rooney Lee attended Harvard University, where he befriended Henry Adams, who wrote about his relationship with Lee in chapter four of his autobiography, The Education of Henry Adams. Rooney Lee, about 8 years old, with his father Robert E. Lee Lee followed in his father's footsteps after graduation, entering the United States Army in 1857 as a second lieutenant. He served with the 6th U.S. Infantry under Albert Sidney Johnston, and participated in the Utah War against the Mormons. In 1859, he resigned from the U.S. Army to operate his White House Plantation, on the south shore of the Pamunkey River, in New Kent County, Virginia. Civil War With the outbreak of the Civil War, Lee was commissioned as a captain in the Confederate Army cavalry and was soon promoted to major. He initially served as a cavalry commander for Brig. Gen. William Loring in the mountains of western Virginia during his father's Western Virginia Campaign. Loring's forces were transferred to the lower Shenandoah Valley and the command of Stonewall Jackson in late 1861, and occupied the town of Romney in early 1862. Lee was soon after assigned to the command of Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart, who was leading the cavalry forces for Joseph E. Johnston's Army of Northern Virginia, in the Peninsula Campaign. After joining Stuart, Rooney Lee's regiment participated in Stuart's first ride-around the Union army, as well as the subsequent Seven Days Battles around Richmond. During this time, Rooney's nearby White House plantation was burned to the ground, and his son Robert died of typhoid fever. During the Northern Virginia Campaign, Rooney played a leading role in Stuart's well-crafted attack on General John Pope's supply base at Catlett's Station on August 22, 1862, capturing a paymaster's safe full of Yankee greenbacks.https://www.civilwarwomenblog.com/charlotte-lee/ His cavalry regiment was assigned to the brigade of Brig. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee, his cousin, for the Maryland Campaign. Following the Battle of South Mountain, Lee was knocked unconscious after a horse fell from under him, and was unable to participate in the Battle of Antietam.https://www.civilwarwomenblog.com/charlotte-lee/ Upon his recovery, he temporarily commanded Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry brigade in Stuart's Chambersburg Raid; his conduct earning him promotion to Brigadier General. He then commanded the 3rd Brigade of Stuart's Cavalry Division at the Battles of Fredericksburg mere weeks after the death of his infant daughter.https://www.civilwarwomenblog.com/charlotte-lee/ During the Battle of Chancellorsville the following year, Lee was detached from Stuart's cavalry to defend against Stoneman's 1863 Raid. At the beginning of the Gettysburg Campaign, Lee was shot in the thigh during combat at Brandy Station. He spent the next two weeks recovering at Hickory Hill, Virginia, before being captured by Union forces. As a prisoner of war, he was sent to Fort Monroe for several months, before being shipped to New York, where he was held until returned to the Confederate Army on February 25, 1864, in exchange for Union Brig. Gen. Neal S. Dow. In April 1864, Lee was promoted to major general and commanded a division in the Cavalry Corps during the battles of The Wilderness; Todd's Tavern; Spotsylvania Court House; and North Anna in the Overland Campaign. With the death of Jeb Stuart, Rooney Lee's role increased. Lee's cavalry division patrolled the extreme right of the Confederate lines during the Siege of Petersburg, defending against the Wilson-Kautz Raid at Staunton River Bridge, Sappony Church and First Ream's Station. His division was then sent north to briefly aid in the defense of Richmond at the Second Battle of Deep Bottom, before supporting General Wade Hampton III's Beefsteak Raid, and then returning to Petersburg for the Battle of Boydton Plank Road. By last year of the war, Rooney Lee had risen to second-in-command of the Confederate cavalry in Virginia; General Hampton having been transferred to South Carolina to raise troops, and Lee's cousin, Fitzhugh, promoted to overall command. Lee's cavalry division screened the Confederate evacuation of Petersburg, notably at the Battle of Namozine Church during the Appomattox Campaign. He surrendered along with his father at Appomattox Court House with only 3000 officers and men, one-tenth the size of the command during the Petersburg Campaign.https://www.civilwarwomenblog.com/charlotte-lee/ Postbellum career Lee returned to White House Plantation and planting after the war. Nearby, his younger brother Rob lived at Romancoke Plantation across the river in King William County. After their mother died in 1873, Rooney inherited Ravensworth Plantation, the old Fitzhugh family property (near present-day Springfield) in Fairfax County with of land. He moved there with his family from White House. In 1875 Rooney was elected to the Virginia Senate, serving until 1878. He was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives in 1887. He served in the House until his death at Ravensworth in 1891. He is interred in the Lee Chapel at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, with his parents and siblings. Marriage and family Lee married twice, first in 1859 to Charlotte Georgiana Wickham, daughter of George and Charlotte Carter Wickham and a descendant of the attorney John Wickham and his wife. They had two children, Robert Edward Lee, born March 11, 1860 and died June 30, 1862 and Charlotte Carter Lee, born October 19, 1862 and died December 6, 1862. Charlotte Carter Wickham Lee died December 26, 1863. On November 28, 1867, he married Mary Tabb Bolling. They had two sons, who both lived to adulthood: Robert Edward Lee III, born February 11, 1869 at Petersburg, and George Bolling Lee, born August 30, 1872 at Lexington. Lee's mother, Mary Anna Randolph Custis, was the only surviving child of George Washington Parke Custis and Mary Lee Fitzhugh. George was the grandson of Martha Dandridge and step-grandson of President George Washington. Lee was also a descendant of Charles II of England through Lady Charlotte Lee (granddaughter of Barbara Villiers), who married the 4th Baron Baltimore, and possibly, a descendant of George I, through Benedict Swingate Calvert (grandson of Lady Charlotte Lee), the illegitimate son of 5th Baron Baltimore and of an unknown mother, who was supposed to be Melusina von der Schulenburg, illegitimate daughter of the King.

He commanded the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac during the Gettysburg Campaign, including the largest predominantly cavalry battle of the war, Brandy Station. In 1864, he was transferred to the Trans- Mississippi Theater, where he defeated Confederate General Sterling Price in two key battles, including the Battle of Mine Creek, the second largest cavalry battle of the war, effectively ending the war in Missouri. He was the son of Stephen Pleasonton and younger brother of Augustus Pleasonton. Early life Pleasonton was born in Washington, D.C., on July 7, 1824.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 431. He was the son of Stephen and Mary Hopkins Pleasonton. Stephen was well known at the time of Alfred's birth. During the War of 1812, as a U.S. State Department employee, he saved crucial documents in the National Archives from destruction by the British invaders of Washington, including the original Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. As Fifth Auditor of the U.S. Treasury, Stephen Pleasonton was de facto superintendent of lighthouses of the United States from 1820 to 1852. His conservative approach and emphasis on economy held back advancements in lighthouse construction and technology and led to deterioration of some lighthouses. Since he had no technical knowledge of the field, he delegated many responsibilities to local customs inspectors. In 1852, the U.S. Congress decided reform was needed and established the Lighthouse Board to take over fiscal and administrative duties for U.S. lighthouses.Holland, Jr., Francis Ross. America's Lighthouses. Courier Corp., 2012. ( New York: Dover Maritime, 1988) . pp. 26‚Äì35. Retrieved May 18, 2015. Alfred's much older brother, Augustus, attended the United States Military Academy and served as Assistant Adjutant General and paymaster of the state of Pennsylvania; his career direction obviously affected his younger brother's and both boys were assured nomination to the Academy by their father's fame from the War of 1812. Alfred graduated from West Point on July 1, 1844, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Dragoons (heavy cavalry). He was stationed first at Fort Atkinson, Iowa. He followed his unit for frontier duty in Minnesota, Iowa, and Texas. He was promoted to second lieutenant with the 2nd U.S. Dragoons on November 3, 1845. With the 2nd Dragoons, he fought in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and received a brevet promotion to first lieutenant for gallantry in the Battle of Palo Alto and the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, Texas, in 1846.Taaffe, Stephen R. Commanding the Army of the Potomac. Lawrence, KS: University of Kansas Press, 2006. . p. 100. He was promoted to first lieutenant on September 30, 1849. He served as regimental adjutant from July 1, 1854, to March 3, 1855. Pleasonton was promoted to captain on March 3, 1855. Civil War=Peninsula to Chancellorsville At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Captain Pleasonton traveled with the 2nd Dragoons from Fort Crittenden, Utah Territory, to Washington D.C. Despite active politicking on his part, attempting to capitalize on the faded political connections of his father (who had died in 1855), Pleasonton did not earn the rapid promotions of some of his colleagues. He was transferred to the 2nd U.S. Cavalry Regiment on August 3, 1861. He was promoted to major on February 15, 1862. He fought without incident or prominence in the Peninsula Campaign, providing Army of the Potomac commander Major General George McClellan with little accurate or valuable information. On May 1, 1862, Pleasonton was nominated by President Abraham Lincoln for promotion to the grade of brigadier general of volunteers to rank from July 16, 1862, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on July 16, 1862. President Lincoln formally appointed Pleasonton to the grade on July 18, 1862. He then commanded a brigade of cavalry in the Army of the Potomac. George Custer (left) on horseback in Falmouth, Virginia General Alfred Pleasonton and staff in Warrenton, Virginia General Pleasonton in Warrenton, Virginia On September 2, 1862, Pleasonton assumed division command in the cavalry. He was wounded in the right ear by the concussion of an artillery shell at the Battle of Antietam on September 17. Ever ambitious, Pleasonton was displeased that he was not promoted to major general of volunteers for his actions, claiming erroneously that his division, and particularly the horse artillery assigned to him, had had a decisive effect on the battle. He did receive a brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel in the regular army, probably based solely on the inflated claims of his battle report, which were not substantiated by the reports of other generals. At the Battle of Chancellorsville, Pleasonton continued his practice of self- promotion.Historian Stephen Taaffe characterized Pleasonton as \\"a notorious publicity hound who exaggerated his accomplishments...\\" Taaffe, 2006, p. 100. He claimed that he temporarily halted an attack by Stonewall Jackson's Corps and that he was able to prevent the total destruction of the Union XI Corps on May 2, 1863. He was persuasive enough that the commander of the Army of the Potomac, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, told President Abraham Lincoln that Pleasonton \\"saved the Union Army\\" at Chancellorsville. Battle reports, however, indicate that Pleasonton's role was considerably less important than he claimed, involving only a small detachment of Confederate infantry on Hazel Grove.Longacre, Edward G. The Cavalry at Gettysburg: A Tactical Study of Mounted Operations during the Civil War's Pivotal Campaign, 9 June‚Äì14 July 1863. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1986. . p. 47. Nevertheless, his claims earned him an appointment to the grade of major general of volunteers on and to rank from June 22, 1863,Eicher, 2001, p. 704President Lincoln sent Pleasonton's nomination as major general to the U.S. Senate on December 23, 1863, and the Senate confirmed the appointment on February 29, 1864. and when the inept Cavalry Corps commander, Maj. Gen. George Stoneman, was relieved after Chancellorsville, Hooker named Pleasonton as his temporary replacement. Pleasonton could not accept even this elevated role gracefully. He wrote to Gen. Hooker \\"I cannot...remain silent as to the unsatisfactory condition in which I find this corps...the responsibility of its present state...does not belong to me.\\" Gettysburg Pleasonton's first combat in his new role was a month later in the Gettysburg Campaign. He led Union cavalry forces in the Battle of Brandy Station, the largest predominantly cavalry battle of the war. The Union cavalry essentially stumbled into J.E.B. Stuart's Confederate cavalry and the 14-hour battle was bloody but inconclusive, although Stuart was embarrassed that he had been surprised and the Union horsemen had a newfound confidence in their abilities. Subordinate officers criticized Pleasonton for not aggressively defeating Stuart at Brandy Station. Gen. Hooker had ordered Pleasonton to \\"disperse and destroy\\" the Confederate cavalry near Culpeper, Virginia, but Pleasonton claimed that he had only been ordered to make a \\"reconnaissance in force toward Culpeper\\", thus rationalizing his actions. In the remainder of the Gettysburg Campaign up to the climactic battle, Pleasonton did not perform as a competent cavalry commander and was generally unable to inform his commander where the enemy troops were located and what their intentions were. The Army of Northern Virginia, under Gen. Robert E. Lee, was able to slip past Union forces through the Shenandoah Valley and north into Pennsylvania. During this period, he attempted to exercise political influence by promoting the nephew of a U.S. Congressman, Captain Elon J. Farnsworth, a member of his staff, directly to brigadier general. Pleasonton also promoted Captain Wesley Merritt and First Lieutenant George Armstrong Custer to brigadier general. Pleasonton corresponded with the congressman and complained about his lack of men and horses in comparison to Jeb Stuart's; he also politicked to acquire the cavalry forces of Maj. Gen. Julius Stahel, who commanded the cavalry in the defenses of Washington. The machinations worked. Stahel was relieved of his command and his troopers were reassigned to Pleasonton. Hooker was enraged by these activities and it was probably only his own relief from command on June 28, 1863, that saved Pleasonton's career from premature termination. In the Battle of Gettysburg, Pleasonton's new commander, Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, understood Pleasonton's reputation (and his father's) and kept him on a short leash. For the three days of the battle, Pleasonton was forced to remain with Meade at army headquarters, rather than with the Cavalry Corps headquarters nearby, and Meade exercised more direct control of the cavalry than an army commander normally would. In postwar writings, Pleasonton attempted to portray his role in the battle as being a major one, including predicting to Meade that the town of Gettysburg would be the decisive point and, after the Confederate defeat in Pickett's Charge, that he urged Meade to attack Gen. Lee and finish him off. He conveniently made these claims after Meade's death, when dispute was impossible. On the other hand, however, Pleasonton cannot be blamed for the unfortunate cavalry action on July 3, when Meade ordered the division of Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick to attack the right flank of the Confederate army, which resulted in a suicidal assault against entrenched infantry and the futile death of Brig. Gen. Elon Farnsworth. After Pleasonton was removed the field, Meade was impressed with his performance from headquarters as an acting chief of staff during the battle.Taaffe, 2006, p. 128.Longacre, 1986, p. 273. Trans-Mississippi Photo of Union Cavalry General Pleasonton taken in Falmouth, Virginia, 1864 Pleasonton was transferred to the Trans-Mississippi Theater and commanded the District of Central Missouri and the District of St. Louis on July 4, 1864. He performed well and over a period of four days, defeated Gen. Sterling Price at the Westport, the Battle of Byram's Ford, the Battle of Mine Creek, and the Marais des Cygnes, ending the last Confederate threat in the West. He was injured by a fall in October 1864. In 1864 and 1865, he instituted a policy of amnesty, granting parole to Confederate prisoners on condition they go up the Missouri River to the Dakota and Montana Territories. This resulted in preventing many of the remnants of Price's army from becoming bushrangers, like Quantrill, and also resulted in Missouri Confederates migrating to the goldfields of the Montana Territory.\\"The Gold Frontier\\", Dan Cushman, Stay Away Joe Publishers, 1973, p. 172, 173 On April 10, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Pleasonton for appointment as a brevet brigadier general in the regular army for the campaign in Missouri, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on May 4, 1866 (and July 14, 1866, after changes in the date of rank for brevet appointments for non-field service).Eicher, 2001, p. 736. On July 17, 1866, President Johnson nominated Pleasonton for appointment as a brevet major general in the regular army for his overall conduct in the war, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on July 23, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 708. Postbellum career Alfred Pleasonton postbellum After the war, although Pleasonton had achieved the honorary rank of brevet major general in the regular army, he was mustered out of the volunteer service with the permanent rank of major of cavalry. Because he did not want to leave the cavalry, Pleasonton turned down a lieutenant colonelcy in the infantry, and soon became dissatisfied with his command relationship to officers he once outranked. Pleasonton resigned his commission in 1868, and was placed on the Army's retired list as a major in 1888. As a civilian, he worked as United States Collector of Internal Revenue and as Commissioner of Internal Revenue under President Ulysses S. Grant, but he was asked to resign from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (now the Internal Revenue Service) after he lobbied Congress for the repeal of the income tax and quarreled with his superiors at the Treasury Department. Refusing to resign, he was dismissed. He served briefly as the president of the Terre Haute and Cincinnati Railroad. In an 1895 interview with sculptor James Edward Kelly, Pleasonton claimed he had been offered command of the Army of the Potomac. (A subsequent interview with Gen. James F. Wade indicated that this offer came in a meeting in Washington some time after Gettysburg.) Pleasonton told Kelly that he \\"wasn't like Grant. I refused to pay the price.\\" He claimed that the terms offered were: \\"The war must not be ended until the South was crushed; slavery abolished; and the President reelected.\\"Styple, pp. 126, 131. Pleasonton, always more of a bureaucrat than an ideologue or strong leader, only wanted to defeat the South's military capabilities so that they could not threaten the rest of the states, but was not convinced that \\"crushing\\" the rebels, ending slavery, or reelecting Lincoln was worth the cost.Considering Pleasonton's junior rank compared to other available Eastern Federal general officers, his failures commanding cavalry in the East, and his history of self-serving fabrication, Pleasonton's post-war claim that he turned down command of the Army of the Potomac must be treated to with great skepticism. Longacre, Edward G. Lincoln's Cavalrymen: A History of the Mounted Forces of the Army of the Potomac. Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 2000. . p. 248. See also, Longacre, 1986, pp. 47‚Äì49, 273. As an example, at page 90, Longacre (1986) wrote: \\"On 12 June he [Pleasonton] resorted to a blatant lie, telling the army leader [Major General Joseph Hooker] that he had placed pickets as far west as Chester Gap in the Blue Ridge Mountains a defile Confederate infantry was passing through the same day!\\" Alfred Pleasonton died in his sleep in Washington, D.C., on January 17, 1897, and is buried in the Congressional Cemetery there, alongside his father. Before his death, Pleasonton requested that his funeral be devoid of all military honors and even refused to be buried in his old uniform because he felt the Army passed him over after the Civil War. The town of Pleasanton, California, was named for Alfred in the late 1860s; a typographical error by a U.S. Postal Service employee apparently led to the spelling difference. The city of Pleasanton, Kansas, despite its different spelling, has begun an annual festival named for Pleasonton.Fort Scott Tribune article. On the huge Pennsylvania Memorial at the Gettysburg Battlefield stands a statue of General Pleasonton. However, it is possible that this represents Alfred's brother, Augustus, a native of Pennsylvania, who was a general in the Pennsylvania militia at the time of the battle.Gettysburg Daily article on Pennsylvania Monument states it is Alfred Pleasonton. Custer, p. 20, presents the alternative view: \\"The statue has been regarded for years as honoring Alfred Pleasonton, but he was born in Washington, D.C., and had no ties to Pennsylvania. It is far more likely the statue is to honor his brother Augustus who, like the other generals featured on the monument, was Pennsylvania-born and played a vital role in the defense of the state.\\" See also * List of American Civil War generals (Union) FootnotesNotesReferences * Custer, Andie. \\"The Knight of Romance\\".

To support her children, Jos√© Carlos' mother, moved first to Lima, then to Huacho, where she had more relatives who helped her make a living. Jos√© Carlos had a brother and a sister: Julio C√©sar and Guillermina. In 1902, as a young schoolboy, he badly injured his left leg in an accident and was moved to a hospital in Lima. Despite a four-year-long convalescence, his leg remained fragile and he was unable to continue his studies. This was the first of a series of health problems that plagued him throughout his life. Although he was unable to continue formal schooling, Mari√°tegui read widely and taught himself French.Krauze, \\"Mari√°tegui\\", p. 91. Though he hoped to become a Roman Catholic priest, at the age of fourteen he started working at a newspaper, first as an errand boy, then as a linotypist, then eventually as a writer. The linotypist he assisted, Juan Manuel Campos, introduced him to an anarchist intellectual, Manuel Gonz√°lez Prada. Gonz√°lez Prada had made a name for himself in a denunciation of the corruption and incompetence of Peru's rulers, and especially the condition of Peruvian peasants due to the monopolization of land by a small group of gamonales (landowners), an analysis that influenced Mari√°tegui's later writings.Krauze, \\"Mari√°tegui\\", p. 92. Mari√°tegui worked in daily journalism for La Prensa and also for the magazine Mundo Lime√±o. In 1916, he left his first employer to join a new daily, El Tiempo, which had a more leftist orientation. Two years later he launched his magazine, only to find that the owners of El Tiempo refused to print it. This led him to break with El Tiempo and launch a newspaper called La Raz√≥n, which became his first major venture in left-wing journalism. In 1918, \\"nauseated by Creole politics,\\" he wrote in an autobiographical note, \\"I turned resolutely toward socialism\\". The newspaper led by Mari√°tegui waged a vigorous defense of the campaign then underway for reform of the universities and went on to become a tribunal for the defense of the young labor movement. La Raz√≥n supported a strike for the eight-hour day held in May 1919, along with lowering the cost of subsistence goods. The paper‚Äôs aggressive radicalism brought it into conflict with the Legu√≠a government, and it was rumored that the ruling circles gave Mari√°tegui a choice: exile or jail.Krauze, \\"Mari√°tegui\\" p. 97. In any event, Mari√°tegui left for Europe in 1920, traveling through France, Germany, Austria and eventually living in Italy for two years. In France, he met with Georges Sorel. He was rather taken with the voluntarist, unorthodox Marxism of Sorel, which he saw the qualities of in the rise of Lenin and the Bolsheviks. During his time in Italy, he married an Italian woman, Anna Chiappe,Chang-Rodr√≠guez, \\"Jos√© Carlos Mari√°tegui\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 3, p. 522. with whom he had four children. He was in Italy during the Turin factory occupations of 1920, and in January 1921 he was present at the Livorno Congress of the Italian Socialist Party, where the historic split occurred that led to the formation of the Communist Party. By the time he left the country in 1922, Benito Mussolini was already on his way to power. In his writings from that period, Mari√°tegui observed that fascism was a response to deep social crisis, that it based itself on the petty bourgeoisie of town and country, and that it relied heavily on a cult of violence. According to him, fascism was the price that a society in crisis paid for the failures of the left. Upon his return to Peru in 1923, he began giving in lectures to the Student Federation in the People‚Äôs University and writing articles about the European situation. He also began using Marxist methods to study Peru. Mari√°tegui also came into contact with and allied himself with V√≠ctor Ra√∫l Haya de la Torre, leader of the populist movement American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA). In October 1923, Haya de la Torre was deported by the Legu√≠a government, leaving Mari√°tegui as the editor of the magazine Claridad. The fifth issue of the publication in March 1924 was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin. September 1926 cover of Amauta In 1924, Mari√°tegui nearly died, and his injured leg had to be amputated. In 1926, he established the journal Amauta to serve as a forum for discussions of socialism, art, and culture in Peru and all of Latin America. In 1927, he was arrested and confined to a military hospital, and later subject to house arrest. He briefly considered relocating to Montevideo or Buenos Aires. In 1928, Mari√°tegui became alienated from the APRA, and he set about establishing the Socialist Party, which formally constituted in October of that year, with Mari√°tegui as general secretary (it later became the Communist Party of Peru). That year, he published his best-known work, Seven Interpretative Essays on Peruvian Reality, in which he examined Peru's social and economic situation from a Marxist perspective. It was considered one of the first materialist analyses of a Latin American society. Beginning with the country‚Äôs economic history, the book proceeds to a discussion of the \\"Indian problem\\", which Mari√°tegui locates firmly within the \\"land problem\\". Other essays are devoted to public education, religion, regionalism and centralism, and literature. Also in the same work, Mari√°tegui blamed the latifundistas, or large land- owners, for the stilted economy of the country and the miserable conditions of the indigenous peoples in the region. He observed that Peru at the time had many characteristics of a feudal society. He argued that a transition to socialism should be based on traditional forms of collectivism as practiced by the Indians. In a famous phrase, Mari√°tegui stated \\"the communitarianism of the Incas cannot be denied or disparaged for having evolved under an autocratic regime.\\" In 1929, Mari√°tegui participated in the establishment of the General Confederation of Peruvian Workers (CGTP), which then sent a delegate to Montevideo for the Constituent Congress of the Latin American Trade Union Conference. Mari√°tegui died on April 16, 1930, in Lima of complications from his earlier affliction. His house at Jir√≥n Washington in the center of Lima was later turned into a museum.  Influence  In different ways, organizations like Shining Path, and the T√∫pac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, and the Peruvian Communist Party all look towards Mari√°tegui and his writings. Mari√°tegui's ideas have recently seen a major revival due to the rise of leftist governments all over South America, in particular in Bolivia was in 2005 Evo Morales became that country's first-ever indigenous president since the Conquest 500 years earlier (second in Latin America following Mexico's Benito Ju√°rez). The rise of popular indigenous movements in Ecuador and Peru have also sparked a renewed interest in Mari√°tegui's writings concerning the role of indigenous peoples in a Latin American revolution. The previous ruling party in Peru, the Peruvian Nationalist Party, claims Mari√°tegui as one of its ideological founders.  Quotes  * Italian fascism represents, clearly, the anti-revolution or, as it is usually called, the counter-revolution. The fascist offensive is explained and is realized in Italy, as a consequence of a retreat or a defeat of the revolution. * I am self-taught. I once registered in Arts in Lima, but only in the interest of taking an erudite Augustine‚Äôs Latin course. And, in Europe, I freely attended some courses, but without ever deciding to lose my extra- collegiate, and perhaps anti-collegiate, status.Jos√© Carlos Mari√°tegui, Autobiographical Note. January 10, 1927. * Peru is a semi-feudal and semi- colonial country at the same time. Though this may seem like a paradox, this is a fact and has to be changed. * The fight is long and tough, but together we can make it. Mari√°tegui is also responsible for coining the phrase, about Marxism, sendero luminoso al futuro (\\"the Shining Path to the future\\"). This phrase later became the name of the Shining Path Maoist organization in Peru as a means of differentiating them from other Communist groups (they preferred to be called the Communist Party of Peru).
